          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:07.015\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:07.015 --> 00:00:10.212\nIn this segment,\nwe're gonna take a look at the MTA exam,\n\n3\n00:00:10.212 --> 00:00:12.380\nthe Microsoft Technology Associate.\n\n4\n00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.511\nRight?\nIs that right, Don, the MTA?\n\n5\n00:00:14.511 --> 00:00:16.225\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's absolutely right.\n\n6\n00:00:16.225 --> 00:00:18.401\nThe MTA,\nthe Microsoft Technology Associate,\n\n7\n00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:21.970\nis designed to be a entry point into\nthe world of Microsoft certifications.\n\n8\n00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.910\nIf you're just getting started in IT the\nMTA is a great place to get started out.\n\n9\n00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.575\nIt's not gonna hit you with crazy over the\ntop objectives that you have no chance of\n\n10\n00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:32.260\nlearning.\n\n11\n00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.890\nIt's gonna to start you off with\nthe basics, the fundamentals.\n\n12\n00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.850\nAnd that makes it a very\nvaluable certification to get,\n\n13\n00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.910\nespecially if you're a career changer.\n\n14\n00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.653\nWell in this series, we're gonna be\ncovering the MTA specifically designed for\n\n15\n00:00:43.653 --> 00:00:45.057\nmobility and devices.\n\n16\n00:00:45.057 --> 00:00:46.763\nAnd what does that mean?\n\n17\n00:00:46.763 --> 00:00:48.442\nRight?\nCuz there's a lot of different MTAs that\n\n18\n00:00:48.442 --> 00:00:48.982\nare out there.\n\n19\n00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:53.257\nWell this one is the one that focuses\non desktops, laptops, tablets,\n\n20\n00:00:53.257 --> 00:00:56.537\ncellphones, the devices that\nend users make use of and\n\n21\n00:00:56.537 --> 00:01:01.051\ntypically the devices that you guys\nare used to out there in the real world.\n\n22\n00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:04.612\nBecause if you're not an IT then you\nprobably haven't worked with servers,\n\n23\n00:01:04.612 --> 00:01:08.550\nyou haven't probably worked with\ndatabase systems and email servers.\n\n24\n00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.740\nYou probably have used a computer.\n\n25\n00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.040\nWell, you're watching this video.\n\n26\n00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.130\nRight?\nSo you at least have that knowledge.\n\n27\n00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.440\nAt that's the type of person\nthat this is targeted for.\n\n28\n00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.490\nAnd in a workplace,\nwhen you just transition in IT,\n\n29\n00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.170\nyou're typically gonna be starting\nas help desk, or desktop support.\n\n30\n00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.750\nRight?\nThat's kind of the entry level\n\n31\n00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.020\nposition in IT.\n\n32\n00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.880\nSo, you need to be able to\nknow how to identify and\n\n33\n00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.460\nresolve issues on a Windows machine,\nhow to do it on a tablet,\n\n34\n00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.340\nhow to integrate somebody's iPad\ninto your Windows environment.\n\n35\n00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.260\nAll right, these are things that you've\ngot to know how to do out there in\n\n36\n00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.940\nthe real world to be a valuable employee,\nand that's what the MTA helps to certify.\n\n37\n00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.100\nNow, there is more than one MTA that\nwe need to need to be aware of.\n\n38\n00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.430\nRight?\nLet's take a look at Microsoft's web\n\n39\n00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.100\npage, real quick.\n\n40\n00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.937\nCuz they do a great job of explaining what\nthe MTA is, who it's designed for, but\n\n41\n00:01:50.937 --> 00:01:52.984\nalso highlighting the different tracks.\n\n42\n00:01:52.984 --> 00:01:56.563\nThere's a track for IT infrastructure,\na track for database administrators,\n\n43\n00:01:56.563 --> 00:01:57.836\nand a track for developers.\n\n44\n00:01:57.836 --> 00:01:58.400\nRight?\n\n45\n00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.740\nDevelopers are the people who create\napplications, they're programmers.\n\n46\n00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.620\nDatabase, that's for people who are gonna\nbe running database servers where we\n\n47\n00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.370\nhave large collections of\ninformation that are searchable and\n\n48\n00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.600\nenabled to retrieve information from.\n\n49\n00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.100\nBut IT infrastructure.\n\n50\n00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.750\nThat's our normal IT worker, the person\nwho is supporting servers, workstations,\n\n51\n00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.470\nrouters, switches, the infrastructure\nthat makes the Internet work.\n\n52\n00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.220\nAnd the infrastructure that makes\nyour business or your home work.\n\n53\n00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.720\nRight?\n\n54\n00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.820\nSomebody's got to know\nhow to make that run.\n\n55\n00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.160\nThese are the people who do it,\nIT infrastructure.\n\n56\n00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.330\nAnd so when we look at the MTA exams,\n\n57\n00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.970\nthere's several different exams\nbased on which track you choose.\n\n58\n00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.050\nIf you go database, you could go\ndeveloper, or if you go IT infrastructure.\n\n59\n00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.040\nIn IT infrastructure you'll see\nthere's five different exams\n\n60\n00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.440\nbased on what it is you\nwanna specialize in.\n\n61\n00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.550\nNow to get the MTA,\nyou don't have to take all five exams.\n\n62\n00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.770\nYou just have to pass one of them.\n\n63\n00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.520\nSo pick the area that you're strong in.\n\n64\n00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.260\nIn this series,\nwe're gonna be doing Mobility and\n\n65\n00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.290\nDevice Fundamentals because\nthat's the most common one.\n\n66\n00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.220\nThat's the one that most people\nare gonna want to start off with.\n\n67\n00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.960\nAnd from there you might choose\nto specialize in other things.\n\n68\n00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.880\nRight?\n\n69\n00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.120\nSo for example, Daniel,\nwho'd be doing server administration?\n\n70\n00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.120\n>> Server administration?\n\n71\n00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.240\nThat will definitely fall under\npeople that wanna become sysadmins.\n\n72\n00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.280\nThey wanna work on the server environment.\n\n73\n00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.821\nThey're gonna eventually probably become\nan MCSA and hopefully one day an MCSC.\n\n74\n00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:19.750\nSo they can take care of those large\ninfrastructure, and even design and\n\n75\n00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.150\ndevelop those things, so\n\n76\n00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.720\nthat's probably where you'd want to start\noff if that was the goal you had in mind.\n\n77\n00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.230\nOther than that though you would just,\nlike Don said,\n\n78\n00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.510\npick your specialty,\nwant to get into security?\n\n79\n00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.890\nJump in that security track.\n\n80\n00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.824\nIf you wanted to just get your\nfeet wet in device mobility?\n\n81\n00:03:33.824 --> 00:03:36.866\nThat's where we're at today, that's\nthe one you'd want to jump on on that.\n\n82\n00:03:36.866 --> 00:03:39.553\n>> Yep, and when you take a look\nat Server Administrator or\n\n83\n00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:41.612\nyou take a look at Security Fundamentals,\n\n84\n00:03:41.612 --> 00:03:45.330\nthese are typically people that\nalready have an exposure to IT.\n\n85\n00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.650\nThey've been working in desktop support or\nsomething and\n\n86\n00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.660\nthey wanna move up to the next tier.\n\n87\n00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.600\nThey wanna move over to that\nsysadmin side or whatever.\n\n88\n00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.240\nAnd so start moving in to\nsome of these other ones.\n\n89\n00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.700\nRight?\nNetwork fundamentals,\n\n90\n00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.810\nif you're dealing with networking,\nTCP/IP-based networks, IPv6,\n\n91\n00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.650\nthat kind of stuff falls in there,\nbut mobility and\n\n92\n00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.940\ndevice fundamentals,\nthat's the one we're gonna tackle.\n\n93\n00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.860\nNow, I mentioned you only have to\npass one exam to get your MTA, so\n\n94\n00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.570\nyou can pass any one of these,\nand you get it.\n\n95\n00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.270\nThe other thing is, if you wanna move\nonto the MCSA like Daniel mentioned,\n\n96\n00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.260\nthe MTA is not a prerequisite.\n\n97\n00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.610\nSo if you already have this knowledge,\nyou are not forced.\n\n98\n00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.110\nYou are not obliged to take this exam.\n\n99\n00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.700\nYou can skip it.\nYou can just move right past and\n\n100\n00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.470\ngo straight to the MCSA if you want.\n\n101\n00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.204\nBut if you're just getting started in IT,\nthe MSCA is really hard.\n\n102\n00:04:26.204 --> 00:04:26.940\nAll right?\n\n103\n00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.250\nIt takes a lot of work and\nI'm not saying the MTA is easy,\n\n104\n00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.610\nI'm just saying that the MTA is\ndesigned for somebody getting started.\n\n105\n00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.560\nThe MCSA is not, it's designed for\nsomebody that's already in there.\n\n106\n00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.300\nSo, make sure you place\nyourself in the right position.\n\n107\n00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.580\nIf you're already started,\nif you're already in IT,\n\n108\n00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.740\nthe MTA might be a little boring for you.\n\n109\n00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.050\nIt might be beneath your skill set.\n\n110\n00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.411\nIt looks good on the resume, so\nmaybe that's what you're looking for.\n\n111\n00:04:47.411 --> 00:04:49.454\nBut, don't feel obliged to do it.\n\n112\n00:04:49.454 --> 00:04:52.720\nAll right, now let's look at\nthe 368 exam specifically.\n\n113\n00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.580\nIf we jump into that exam, you'll see\nthat there's a couple of basics here.\n\n114\n00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.300\nIt's $115, so it's not an expensive exam.\n\n115\n00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.970\nThat's US dollars, it's different for\ndifferent countries.\n\n116\n00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.910\nAnd you can take the exam at\na number of different places.\n\n117\n00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.550\nAny Certaport location,\nwhich a lot of colleges,\n\n118\n00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.775\ncommunity colleges, secondary schools,\na lot of them are Certaport locations.\n\n119\n00:05:11.775 --> 00:05:15.340\nBut if there aren't any of those,\nyou can use Pearson View.\n\n120\n00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.500\nPearson View has testing\ncenters all over the world.\n\n121\n00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.730\nThey're a third party provider.\n\n122\n00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.430\nThey provide tests for\nall sorts of different exams.\n\n123\n00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.190\nAnd if you go to their site,\nyou can actually do a center search for\n\n124\n00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.130\na location.\n\n125\n00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.590\nDaniel, what's a city we can use?\n\n126\n00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.120\n>> Let's try Gainesville, Florida.\n\n127\n00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.710\n>> All right.\n\n128\n00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.830\nWe can take up Gainesville, Florida.\n\n129\n00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.640\nAnd we'll just do a quick search here.\n\n130\n00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.470\nAnd you can search anywhere in the world.\n\n131\n00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:37.680\nRight?\nParis, France, whatever.\n\n132\n00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.650\nAnd it's gonna give you a list of all\nthe different locations that are out\n\n133\n00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.490\nthere that are Pearson View Centers.\n\n134\n00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.010\nSo we can go and take that exam.\n\n135\n00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.341\nSo as far as taking the exam,\nthey've really removed an obstacle there.\n\n136\n00:05:47.341 --> 00:05:49.190\nRight?\nIt's pretty easy to find a location to go\n\n137\n00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.520\nand take the exam.\n\n138\n00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.090\nThe hard part is what you need to\nknow before you go and take the exam.\n\n139\n00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.590\nRight?\n\n140\n00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.070\nSo fortunately Microsoft posts their\nexam objectives right here, and\n\n141\n00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.090\nthis is what we've\nstructured our show off of.\n\n142\n00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.300\nSo our show is going to basically go\nthrough from start to finish tackling\n\n143\n00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.200\nall of these objectives to make sure that\nyou guys have the information you need to\n\n144\n00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.520\nbe successful.\n\n145\n00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.230\nSome of these might be areas you\nalready know, some might be areas that\n\n146\n00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:13.080\nare completely new to you, so\nthis is your chance to get that exposure.\n\n147\n00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.761\nAll right,\n\n148\n00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:18.543\nwell the first exam objective area is\njust understanding device configurations.\n\n149\n00:06:18.543 --> 00:06:19.380\nAll right?\n\n150\n00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.850\nAnd what this boils down to is,\n\n151\n00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.170\nif I give you a Windows computer,\ndo you know how to do a basic setup on it?\n\n152\n00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:30.060\nThings like changing the screen saver time\nout, changing power management settings,\n\n153\n00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.280\nsetting up device encryption,\nall the things we do when we get\n\n154\n00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.700\na brand new computer and we wanna make\nit our own, kinda customize it our way.\n\n155\n00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.475\nThose are the things that we\nneed to be familiar with.\n\n156\n00:06:38.475 --> 00:06:40.330\nRight?\nAnd this is end-user stuff,\n\n157\n00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.320\nthings that most end users are already\ndoing if you've had exposure to it.\n\n158\n00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.790\nSo basic device configurations and\ngetting those in place.\n\n159\n00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.010\nThe next objective Is understanding\ndata access and management.\n\n160\n00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.860\nWe have a lot of data on our computers.\n\n161\n00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.390\nRight?\nDocuments, pictures,\n\n162\n00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.100\nmusic files, whatever.\n\n163\n00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.010\nWe need to make sure that\nthose are secured, so\n\n164\n00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.400\nthat only the people we want\nto have access do have access.\n\n165\n00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.400\nRight?\nWe need to kinda keep that trimmed down.\n\n166\n00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.110\nSo in this section we cover things\nlike how to apply file permissions,\n\n167\n00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.550\nhow to restrict access, how to share\nthe files and folders on the network.\n\n168\n00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.070\nRight?\nWe wanna make sure that people can get to\n\n169\n00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.210\nthat information, but\nthat it's done in a secure manner.\n\n170\n00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.410\nThe third objective is Device Security.\n\n171\n00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.260\nNow I kind of already mentioned\nsecurity with device access.\n\n172\n00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.420\nBut here,\nit goes beyond just files and folders.\n\n173\n00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.160\nHere, we talk about things\nlike the Windows Firewall and\n\n174\n00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.060\nhow we can control access over\nthe network and protect our machine.\n\n175\n00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.730\nWe're talking about\nmulti-factor authentication.\n\n176\n00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.160\nWe wanna stop people from\nlogging in to our computer,\n\n177\n00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.706\nunless they have the valid\ncredentials to get in there.\n\n178\n00:07:38.706 --> 00:07:41.144\nAnd we wanna protect our system\nin the event that it gets stolen.\n\n179\n00:07:41.144 --> 00:07:42.120\nRight?\n\n180\n00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.580\nI wanna know that if somebody steals\nmy laptop, that my data is still safe,\n\n181\n00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:46.530\neven though I lost my laptop.\n\n182\n00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:49.880\nAnd so, those are some of the things that\nwe take a look at in device security.\n\n183\n00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:54.220\nThen, we've got an important section,\nbecause more and\n\n184\n00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.440\nmore services are moving this way.\n\n185\n00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.290\nWe're gonna talk about Cloud Services.\n\n186\n00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:00.284\nNow the cloud is a term that gets\nthrow on around quite a bit and\n\n187\n00:08:00.284 --> 00:08:02.238\nit means a number of different things.\n\n188\n00:08:02.238 --> 00:08:05.210\nBut what we're gonna do is take a look\nat it from the standpoint of a normal\n\n189\n00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.230\nend user, and\nwhat cloud services mean to them.\n\n190\n00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:07.990\nRight?\n\n191\n00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:11.290\nSo what are some cloud applications they\ncan use, how they can leverage things,\n\n192\n00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.169\nlike Windows Azure or Microsoft Intune.\n\n193\n00:08:14.169 --> 00:08:16.300\nRight?\nDifferent features like that and\n\n194\n00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.490\nhow we can implement those for a business.\n\n195\n00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.270\nAnd then lastly, this one,\nEnterprise Mobility.\n\n196\n00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:28.020\nEnterprise Mobility is basically saying,\nit used to be that if you had a computer\n\n197\n00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:31.460\nfor a company, the company provided\nthe computer, it was a company machine.\n\n198\n00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.035\nBut in today's world,\nwe have a lot of bring your device.\n\n199\n00:08:34.035 --> 00:08:35.410\nRight?\nPeople bring their own stuff,\n\n200\n00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:37.610\ntheir own cellphone,\ntheir own tablet, their own laptop,\n\n201\n00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.040\nand they wanna connect it\nto a business computer.\n\n202\n00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.300\nSo how do we do that safely and\n\n203\n00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:44.820\nsecurely where we can still manage it and\nkeep our environment safe?\n\n204\n00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.990\nHow do we manage our own mobile devices?\n\n205\n00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.050\nAnd how do we manage the ones that\nour employees are bringing in?\n\n206\n00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:53.550\nSo we get a chance to take a look\nat some of the obstacles there and\n\n207\n00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:57.610\nsome of the solutions that we have, like\nwork folders and Azure remote apps and\n\n208\n00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:01.630\ntechnologies that can let us safely\nparticipate in that type of environment.\n\n209\n00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:06.390\nSo those are the five main objective\nareas inside of the MTA exam.\n\n210\n00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:08.330\nThey cover some really good stuff.\n\n211\n00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.960\nAnd Microsoft is not looking for\nyou to be an expert.\n\n212\n00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.446\nYou're not supposed to be a super wizard\nwith 20 years of industry experience.\n\n213\n00:09:14.446 --> 00:09:15.267\nYou're getting started.\n\n214\n00:09:15.267 --> 00:09:16.090\nRight?\n\n215\n00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:19.280\nSo a lot of these are just making sure\nthat you're familiar with the topic.\n\n216\n00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.780\nNot necessarily how to implement and\ncreate that structure.\n\n217\n00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.820\nFor that,\nthat's where we jump into the MCSA and\n\n218\n00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.780\nwe start tackling how do we actually build\nall this great stuff that we talked about.\n\n219\n00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.150\nSo that's basically it for\nthe exam objectives.\n\n220\n00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:35.610\nWe talked a little bit about the exam\ncost as well as where you can take it.\n\n221\n00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.310\nAnd we talk about the MTA\ncertification in general.\n\n222\n00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:41.150\nAt this point you guys should have pretty\ngood picture of what we're gonna cover.\n\n223\n00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.978\nSo if this sounds interesting, if it\nsounds exactly like what you're looking\n\n224\n00:09:44.978 --> 00:09:47.530\nfor, then you're in the right place,\nstay tuned,\n\n225\n00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:49.564\nwe've got our episode starting up next.\n\n226\n00:09:49.564 --> 00:09:56.309\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.387 --> 00:00:19.464\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nhere with me today is Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n4\n00:00:19.464 --> 00:00:20.289\nHow's it going today, Don?\n\n5\n00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:21.369\n>> It's going great, Daniel.\n\n6\n00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.066\nGlad to be back on the show,\nand excited to kick off\n\n7\n00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:28.420\nthe Microsoft Technology Associate for\nthe Mobility and Devices exam.\n\n8\n00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.010\nThis is, I know the exam\ntitle's a little misleading,\n\n9\n00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.290\nbut it's the Windows 8 exam really, right.\n\n10\n00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.360\nThe Windows desktop operating system.\n\n11\n00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.210\nAnd so we're gonna kick things off\nright at the very beginning with\n\n12\n00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.810\njust getting logged into Windows.\n\n13\n00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.516\nHow Windows handles our user accounts\nwhen we work with the system.\n\n14\n00:00:43.516 --> 00:00:46.828\nSo that's what we've got on the agenda\ntoday, and it should be a pretty good run.\n\n15\n00:00:46.828 --> 00:00:50.259\nAll right, well let's start off just by\ntalking about one of the big differences\n\n16\n00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:52.190\nthat Microsoft introduced with Windows 8.\n\n17\n00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.010\nBack in Windows 7,\nwhen you logged into Windows,\n\n18\n00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.450\nyou logged in with what's\ncalled a local user account.\n\n19\n00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.690\nEvery Windows machine has at\nleast one local user account.\n\n20\n00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.552\nThat's a user that exists right\nthere on that machine, and\n\n21\n00:01:04.552 --> 00:01:07.083\nnot on any other machine that's out there,\nright.\n\n22\n00:01:07.083 --> 00:01:09.715\nSo I might log in to my\ndesktop as Don Pezet.\n\n23\n00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.660\nBut then I go to Daniel's laptop and\n\n24\n00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.480\nI can't log in,\ncuz my user account doesn't exist there.\n\n25\n00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.390\nDaniel has an account there,\nbut I don't, right.\n\n26\n00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.460\nAnd if he comes to my laptop, I don't have\nan account for him here either, right.\n\n27\n00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.180\nThat's the idea behind a local account.\n\n28\n00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.510\nIt's just local to your\nindividual machine.\n\n29\n00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.460\nBut right now, there's a big push\nto go towards cloud services.\n\n30\n00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.580\nAnd with cloud services, it's kind of\nneat because you can have a user account\n\n31\n00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.880\nthat isn't tied just to your machine.\n\n32\n00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.640\nBut is instead tied, well, to the cloud.\n\n33\n00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.720\nSo that you could login on any\nmachine with that cloud account.\n\n34\n00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.770\nAnd there's a couple of other\nneat little benefits and\n\n35\n00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.860\nthings that we'll talk\nabout a little bit later.\n\n36\n00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.840\nBut, for the local account, that's\nthe one that you're guaranteed to have.\n\n37\n00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.070\nEverybody's gonna have at\nleast one local account.\n\n38\n00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.584\nIt's created during the installation\nof Windows, and you're gonna have it.\n\n39\n00:01:54.584 --> 00:01:56.750\nNow you might not know that.\n\n40\n00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.970\nYou might have purchased a laptop\nfrom Dell or a desktop from HP or\n\n41\n00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.730\nAsus or whoever, Lenovo,\nwhoever it is that you bought from.\n\n42\n00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.370\nAnd when you turn on that PC,\nit might fire up and\n\n43\n00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.089\ngo right to the Windows desktop,\nand you're ready to work, okay.\n\n44\n00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.638\nA lot of hardware vendors will\nset up a default account for you.\n\n45\n00:02:13.638 --> 00:02:16.728\nBut you can always go back in and create\nyour own accounts, add more people or\n\n46\n00:02:16.728 --> 00:02:19.596\nremove people, you can do all sorts\nof neat things there, all right.\n\n47\n00:02:19.596 --> 00:02:20.981\nSo let me show you that process and\n\n48\n00:02:20.981 --> 00:02:24.140\nhow we manage these user\naccounts inside of Windows.\n\n49\n00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.780\nI've got a desktop fired up here,\nthis is a Windows 8 machine, and\n\n50\n00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.780\nit's just a base install of Windows 8,\nnothing too fancy on it.\n\n51\n00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.100\nAnd if I swipe up or hit my up arrow\non the keyboard, I get my login screen.\n\n52\n00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.800\nNow, when I look at this login screen,\nsee how its got my name right here?\n\n53\n00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.540\nJust Don Pezet, that's it, and\nit's asking for a password.\n\n54\n00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.890\nI don't have a photo loaded for my account\nyet, so I just have a person's face there,\n\n55\n00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.190\na stick man, whatever, and\nI can get logged in, right.\n\n56\n00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.400\nIf you installed Windows yourself, it\nasked you for a password at that time, and\n\n57\n00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.770\nso you can provide that password and\nyou get logged in.\n\n58\n00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.920\nI'm logging in with a local account.\n\n59\n00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.620\nNow, how do I know it's a local account?\n\n60\n00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.350\nWell, I know it's local\ncuz all I saw was a name.\n\n61\n00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.790\nWIth a cloud account, right, an account\nthat's hosted out there on the Internet,\n\n62\n00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.040\nyou're usually going to have an address\nthat looks more like an email address.\n\n63\n00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.956\nSo it'll be something, name at and\na domain, donpezet@hotmail.com,\n\n64\n00:03:13.956 --> 00:03:15.991\nsomething like that, right.\n\n65\n00:03:15.991 --> 00:03:17.460\nThat's what you're gonna see.\n\n66\n00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.370\nBut on a local account,\nyou'll typically just see your name.\n\n67\n00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.240\nJust like I did right there,\nthat's kind of the typical environment.\n\n68\n00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.660\nNow, I keep saying typical,\nyou actually can change the way they look.\n\n69\n00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.260\nSo you could have a local account\nthat did look like a cloud account.\n\n70\n00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.060\nSo it's not necessarily set in stone\nthat that's the way that it works.\n\n71\n00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.523\nBut, it's usually a pretty\ngood assumption, right.\n\n72\n00:03:35.523 --> 00:03:36.840\nNow when we log in to Windows,\n\n73\n00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.810\nwe know who we're logged in as if\nwe look at our start menu, right.\n\n74\n00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.380\nSo, I can see Don Pezet right there,\nthere's that same kind\n\n75\n00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.300\nof stick man figure cuz I haven't loaded\na photo from my account yet, right.\n\n76\n00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.390\nNow if I wanna take a look at\nwhat accounts are actually local,\n\n77\n00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.320\nI wanna be certain, I don't wanna guess.\n\n78\n00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.140\nI wanna know,\nis this account local or not, right.\n\n79\n00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.990\nWe can take a look at the local\naccount database right inside of our\n\n80\n00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.240\nWindows Control Panel.\n\n81\n00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.780\nSo there's a few different ways to\nget to it, but we can jump in and\n\n82\n00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.550\ntake a look at our local user accounts.\n\n83\n00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.330\nAnd the reason why most of\nus are gonna care about this\n\n84\n00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.470\nis because you may need\nmore than one user account.\n\n85\n00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.350\nHaving more than one user account\non your system can be really handy\n\n86\n00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.700\nif you share your computer.\n\n87\n00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.070\nNow I'm kinda stingy with my laptop,\nI really don't share it with anybody.\n\n88\n00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.250\nBut Daniel,\ndo you share yours with anybody?\n\n89\n00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.010\n>> Yeah Don, I don't share this\ncomputer out specifically.\n\n90\n00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.860\nBut we do have a home PC where my wife and\nmyself, we share that, and\n\n91\n00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.480\nwe have an account for each one of us.\n\n92\n00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.670\nThat way I'm not stomping\nall over her settings,\n\n93\n00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.470\nshe's not stomping all over mine.\n\n94\n00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.375\nI have the browsers and\nthe home pages that I like, and\n\n95\n00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:39.331\nI have my desktop background the way\nI like it, font size all that stuff.\n\n96\n00:04:39.331 --> 00:04:43.408\nAnd that all comes from being able to\nlogin as myself, and my wife gets the same\n\n97\n00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:47.712\nkind of creature feature as well, so\nit's kind of nice to have multiple logins.\n\n98\n00:04:47.712 --> 00:04:49.130\n>> Yeah, and those personal settings,\n\n99\n00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.310\nthat's really what\nmultiple logins are for.\n\n100\n00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.980\nIf you don't need personal settings,\nyou could just share the same account, and\n\n101\n00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.500\nthen you don't worry about\nuser accounts at all.\n\n102\n00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.860\nI know a lot of people set their\ncomputers to automatically login.\n\n103\n00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.800\nThey never even see their account,\nwhich is not the greatest idea but\n\n104\n00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.740\nyou can do it.\n\n105\n00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.520\nBut let's say for me,\naccessing the desktop is really important.\n\n106\n00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.489\nSo I start moving my desktop icons around,\nand\n\n107\n00:05:08.489 --> 00:05:11.240\nmaybe I resize that one\nto be a larger icon.\n\n108\n00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.251\nAnd Mail is less important for me,\nso I resize it to make it smaller.\n\n109\n00:05:15.251 --> 00:05:18.195\nSo, as we start changing things and\nmanipulating it,\n\n110\n00:05:18.195 --> 00:05:20.950\nwe're making the environment\nconvenient for us.\n\n111\n00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.370\nWe're making the computer\nwork the way we want it to.\n\n112\n00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.940\nBut if you share the computer\nwith other people,\n\n113\n00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.280\nit may not work the way that they want it\nto, right, so they want separate settings.\n\n114\n00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.430\nYou also might want privacy.\n\n115\n00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.980\nI might have documents that I don't\nwant to share with somebody, and so\n\n116\n00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.370\nI want my own separate account so\nthat we can keep those things separate.\n\n117\n00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.250\nOr, you might have children.\n\n118\n00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.680\nIf you have children that\nare gonna be using your computer,\n\n119\n00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.300\nWindows has parental controls\nthat you can enable.\n\n120\n00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.293\nAnd with parental controls, you can\nrestrict things like Internet access and\n\n121\n00:05:47.293 --> 00:05:50.120\nother abilities that\nthey have on the machine.\n\n122\n00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.800\nAnd you don't want to restrict your\naccount, you want to restrict theirs, so\n\n123\n00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.050\nyou use separate accounts for\nthat, all right.\n\n124\n00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.350\nSo to manage user accounts in Windows,\n\n125\n00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.010\nwe're gonna have to jump\ninto our control settings.\n\n126\n00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.640\nSo I'm gonna start by\nbringing up my charms bar.\n\n127\n00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.270\nNow if you haven't worked with Windows\n8 a lot, the way we get to that is\n\n128\n00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.350\non a touchscreen, you swipe in\nfrom the right side of the screen.\n\n129\n00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.660\nIf you don't have a touchscreen,\n\n130\n00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.100\nyou can just move your mouse over\nto the right side of your screen.\n\n131\n00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.560\nAnd if you let it float there for\na second, the charms bar will appear, so\n\n132\n00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.210\nyou just have to be a little patient.\n\n133\n00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.360\nOr you can hit Windows\nkey+C on your keyboard.\n\n134\n00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.900\nAll three methods will get you\ninto this charms bar right here.\n\n135\n00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.470\nAnd once we're in the charms bar,\nwe're gonna jump into settings.\n\n136\n00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.520\nAnd inside of your settings,\nyou'll see a few options.\n\n137\n00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.710\nThe one I want is hidden way down here\nat the bottom, Change PC settings.\n\n138\n00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.550\nSo I'm gonna hit that, and then we'll\njump into our primary PC settings.\n\n139\n00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.010\nNow from here, we're looking for\nuser accounts.\n\n140\n00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.690\nAnd so you'll see PC and devices,\nand then accounts right here.\n\n141\n00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.570\nAnd this is where we can see what\naccount we're logged in as, and\n\n142\n00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.970\nwe can see other accounts, all right.\n\n143\n00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.850\nNow notice on my account,\nif I had any doubt, this resolves it.\n\n144\n00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.880\nIt tells me this is a Local Account.\n\n145\n00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.810\nSo if we're not sure if it's local,\nnow we know.\n\n146\n00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.480\nOr if it's a cloud account,\nit would tell us that right here.\n\n147\n00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.290\nIn fact, it's encouraging me\nto switch to a cloud account.\n\n148\n00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.360\nIt's saying sign in with\na Microsoft account,\n\n149\n00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.100\nbecause there's certain\nbenefits that you get.\n\n150\n00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.567\nI'm gonna talk about those later,\nall right.\n\n151\n00:07:07.567 --> 00:07:10.747\nBut as far as a local account,\nI can see my account right here and\n\n152\n00:07:10.747 --> 00:07:13.447\nwe could even create an account picture or\nwhatever,\n\n153\n00:07:13.447 --> 00:07:16.270\nif we wanted to start customizing that for\nus.\n\n154\n00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.640\nBut if I want to create more accounts for\nmy family,\n\n155\n00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.730\nthen I can go over here to other accounts\nand we can start adding more in, right.\n\n156\n00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:26.060\nSo maybe I do want Daniel to have\nan account on here, so I can punch it in.\n\n157\n00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.281\nIf he has a cloud account,\nwe can use that, right,\n\n158\n00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:29.842\nthere's that convenience again.\n\n159\n00:07:29.842 --> 00:07:33.268\nOr way down here,\nI can create a child's account, or\n\n160\n00:07:33.268 --> 00:07:36.430\nI can sign in without a Microsoft account.\n\n161\n00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.246\nThat is another local account.\n\n162\n00:07:38.246 --> 00:07:40.110\nSo if I want another local account,\n\n163\n00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:43.040\nchoose to sign in without\na Microsoft account, all right.\n\n164\n00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.660\nNow it's gonna tell me about\nsome of those benefits, right.\n\n165\n00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.432\nWhy I might want to go to a Microsoft\naccount versus a local account.\n\n166\n00:07:48.432 --> 00:07:51.372\nBut I'm gonna stick with local for\nright now, and I'm gonna go and\n\n167\n00:07:51.372 --> 00:07:52.221\nget that created.\n\n168\n00:07:52.221 --> 00:07:56.871\nSo I'll create an account for Daniel and\nget this punched in the system.\n\n169\n00:07:56.871 --> 00:08:01.267\nI'm just putting a user name and\na password, a super secure password.\n\n170\n00:08:01.267 --> 00:08:03.007\nAnd we'll get that put in place.\n\n171\n00:08:03.007 --> 00:08:05.140\nAnd it's asking me again if he's a child.\n\n172\n00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.771\nRight, well, at heart.\n\n173\n00:08:06.771 --> 00:08:08.280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Daniel, I imagine.\n\n174\n00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.220\nBut no, this would be if I wanna have\nthose parental controls in place,\n\n175\n00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.919\nI could turn those on,\nI'm gonna leave that off.\n\n176\n00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.170\nAll right,\nnow I got another account, right.\n\n177\n00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:18.850\nI've got that Daniel Lowrie account.\n\n178\n00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:23.260\nAnd when I go to log in to the system,\nhis account is separate from mine.\n\n179\n00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.050\nRight, two different accounts.\n\n180\n00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:30.610\nIf I jump back to my desktop, this is\nthe default Windows 8 desktop right here.\n\n181\n00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:33.240\nNothing too fancy, just these orange bars,\n\n182\n00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:38.180\nand if I change that wallpaper,\nI'm gonna personalize this a little bit.\n\n183\n00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:41.870\nLet's go with something crazy here, right.\n\n184\n00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:42.740\nSome kind of blue lines.\n\n185\n00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.290\nThat's profound.\n\n186\n00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:45.770\nI imagine it's art.\n\n187\n00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:46.763\n>> Very transcendental.\n\n188\n00:08:46.763 --> 00:08:48.330\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] I feel at peace\n\n189\n00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:49.568\nwith my computer now.\n\n190\n00:08:49.568 --> 00:08:52.280\n>> [LAUGH] Serenity Now\n>> So now that I've got that set,\n\n191\n00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.480\nthat's kinda how I want it.\n\n192\n00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.940\nAnd you guys saw on the Start menu,\nhow I moved it so\n\n193\n00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:00.090\nthe Desktop was the first icon, and\nMail was more, that's how I want it.\n\n194\n00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:03.710\nBut we can switch and\nlog in as Daniel, and\n\n195\n00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.480\nit should be the way that he wants it,\nokay?\n\n196\n00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.190\nNow to switch to Daniel, I can click on\nmy user name here in the Start menu, and\n\n197\n00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:15.780\nif I go to Sign out, I can sign out\nas me and then sign in as Daniel.\n\n198\n00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.820\nOr I can just choose Daniel\nright here from the list.\n\n199\n00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.630\nAnd this will do what's\ncalled fast user switching.\n\n200\n00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:22.290\nOkay?\n\n201\n00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.950\nWhen you do fast user switching,\nyou don't actually log out.\n\n202\n00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:30.700\nI'm still logged into the computer,\nbut now Daniel's logging in also.\n\n203\n00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.530\nAnd since this is the first\ntime he's logging in,\n\n204\n00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.500\nI'm seeing the New Profile Wizard.\n\n205\n00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.995\nIt actually goes through a process in the\nbackground where it builds what's called\n\n206\n00:09:37.995 --> 00:09:38.960\na use profile.\n\n207\n00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.560\nAnd the profile is where\nall your stuff is stored.\n\n208\n00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.710\nYour documents, your Internet Explorer\nfavorites, what wallpaper you chose,\n\n209\n00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:48.750\nany preferences you have in the system,\n\n210\n00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.760\nthey're all stored as\npart of your profile.\n\n211\n00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.130\nAnd Daniel will have\na separate profile from me.\n\n212\n00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:56.730\nAnd when it finally logs in,\nhere we go, it just logged in,\n\n213\n00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.610\nwe'll see he's got the default profile.\n\n214\n00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:02.840\nHe sees that orange background, with\nthe pyramids, and if he goes to the Start\n\n215\n00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:08.460\nmenu, he sees Mail is nice and big,\nand Desktop is small down here, right?\n\n216\n00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:12.410\nIt's all back to the default,\nthese are his settings, but\n\n217\n00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:16.510\nif I switch back to me,\nmy settings are still there.\n\n218\n00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:17.410\nI can switch back to me.\n\n219\n00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:21.820\nAnd here I am, and the settings\nare back to the way that I want them.\n\n220\n00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:26.170\nAll right, that's the neat part about\nhaving more than one user account.\n\n221\n00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:28.700\nNow, I mentioned fast user switching.\n\n222\n00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.800\nFast user switching is pretty cool\nbecause you technically don't log out.\n\n223\n00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:33.540\nAll right.\n\n224\n00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:38.018\nLet's say, for example, that I am writing\na document, so maybe I'm in WordPad.\n\n225\n00:10:38.018 --> 00:10:40.870\nAnd I 'm writing some kind of document.\n\n226\n00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:47.550\nThis is a really important document,\nright, and I don't wanna lose my work.\n\n227\n00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:48.980\nBut I'm working on it and I get up and\n\n228\n00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.720\nI walk away from the computer for\na little while.\n\n229\n00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.790\nAnd Daniel walks up and he says,\noh, I want to use the computer.\n\n230\n00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.750\nWell, he doesn't want to use it logged in\nas me, he wants to use it logged in as\n\n231\n00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.770\nhim so that everything's\nthe way that he likes it.\n\n232\n00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:01.345\nHe's going to log me out, right.\n\n233\n00:11:01.345 --> 00:11:05.145\nWell, if he goes to log me out,\nright, he can come up here, and\n\n234\n00:11:05.145 --> 00:11:05.925\nhe can choose Sign out.\n\n235\n00:11:05.925 --> 00:11:07.805\nAnd it's gonna sign me out.\n\n236\n00:11:07.805 --> 00:11:09.885\nBut, what's gonna happen\nto my Word document?\n\n237\n00:11:11.205 --> 00:11:13.025\nWell, I never saved it.\n\n238\n00:11:13.025 --> 00:11:14.105\nI created it and I didn't save it.\n\n239\n00:11:14.105 --> 00:11:15.345\nSo here we go this warning, right?\n\n240\n00:11:15.345 --> 00:11:17.185\nThe app is preventing\nyou from signing out.\n\n241\n00:11:17.185 --> 00:11:19.075\nYou're gonna lose your data\ncuz you never saved it.\n\n242\n00:11:19.075 --> 00:11:21.055\nDo you wanna Sign out anyway?\n\n243\n00:11:21.055 --> 00:11:22.500\nOr Cancel?\n\n244\n00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.680\nWell, Daniel, do you know if this\ndocument is important to me?\n\n245\n00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.010\n>> I have no clue.\n\n246\n00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:28.080\nI didn't look at it.\n\n247\n00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.760\nI just wanted to come over and\nuse the computer.\n\n248\n00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.510\nI might just think you just had\na program open and hit Sign out anyway.\n\n249\n00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:34.100\n>> That's right.\nAnd so,\n\n250\n00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:37.195\nif you do Sign out anyway,\nit just closed my WordPad document.\n\n251\n00:11:37.195 --> 00:11:40.485\nAnd sure, he can come in an log in now,\nand he can jump in here and\n\n252\n00:11:40.485 --> 00:11:44.815\nstart running stuff and using the computer\nand thinks everything's fine, right?\n\n253\n00:11:44.815 --> 00:11:46.155\nAnd then later, woops.\n\n254\n00:11:46.155 --> 00:11:51.140\nLater, I come back and\nI try to get to my stuff, right,\n\n255\n00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:55.220\nso I come up to the computer and\nI see Daniel logged in here and so\n\n256\n00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:59.090\nhe's using the computer, so I say all\nright, well me switch over to me, right.\n\n257\n00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:04.010\nSo I'm gonna go bring my Start menu up,\nI'll go up here and I'll switch to me.\n\n258\n00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:07.230\nNow, when I switch to me,\nI was logged out.\n\n259\n00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:09.770\nSo any programs that I was running,\nare gone.\n\n260\n00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:11.650\nAnd my Word document is now gone.\n\n261\n00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:13.000\nI lost my data, right?\n\n262\n00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:17.475\nBut if I do something, like here,\nI'll launch Internet Explorer.\n\n263\n00:12:17.475 --> 00:12:19.510\nAnd maybe I'll get back into WordPad.\n\n264\n00:12:21.065 --> 00:12:23.545\nAnd I'll create an all new\nsuper important document.\n\n265\n00:12:26.325 --> 00:12:27.665\nAll right.\nSo I got another super\n\n266\n00:12:27.665 --> 00:12:28.860\nimportant document here.\n\n267\n00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:30.450\nAnd I'm working.\n\n268\n00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.470\nIf Daniel had instead\nused fast user switching\n\n269\n00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:35.000\nthis would be a lot different, right?\n\n270\n00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.140\nIf he came up and said oh,\nDon's logged in, but you know what,\n\n271\n00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.880\nI'm just gonna fast user\nswitch right over to Daniel.\n\n272\n00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.470\nNow he's going to switch\nover to his account.\n\n273\n00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:44.500\nAnd here he is.\n\n274\n00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:45.170\nHe's in the account.\n\n275\n00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:46.370\nHe can start working.\n\n276\n00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:48.970\nAnd when I come back I can say,\nhey Daniel I wasn't done with my stuff,\n\n277\n00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:50.040\nI need to work on this.\n\n278\n00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.090\nWe can fast user switch right back to me.\n\n279\n00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:59.370\nAnd when we jump back to my account, now\nhere I am and there's my WordPad document.\n\n280\n00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:00.650\nThere's my Internet Explorer window.\n\n281\n00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:03.120\nAll that stuff is still\nrunning in the background,\n\n282\n00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.600\nit was just held for me, right?\n\n283\n00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.520\nFast user switching is really cool on\na shared computer like this, right,\n\n284\n00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.180\nwhere you've got people who\nmight leave documents open.\n\n285\n00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:13.820\nSo there's kinda two different ways\nto switch between user accounts,\n\n286\n00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.650\nand the user accounts\ndon't cost any money.\n\n287\n00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:17.330\nYou can create as many as you need.\n\n288\n00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.980\nCreate them for your husband or\nwife, your kids, your neighbors,\n\n289\n00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:24.700\nwhoever it is that might be using\nthat computer alongside with you.\n\n290\n00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:25.630\nMake that set up.\n\n291\n00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:28.650\nGet those kind of accounts put in place\nand now you can share the system,\n\n292\n00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:29.440\nall right?\n\n293\n00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:33.425\n>> I was gonna say, with log in power\ncomes great responsibility, right Don?\n\n294\n00:13:33.425 --> 00:13:36.320\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, the more you share your computer,\n\n295\n00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.870\nobviously, different people\ncan do different things and\n\n296\n00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:40.580\nstart to mess up the computer.\n\n297\n00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:44.590\nSure things like your wallpaper\nare kept separately from each user, but\n\n298\n00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:47.450\nthere's some settings that are a little\nmore global that actually apply to\n\n299\n00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:48.820\nthe whole system.\n\n300\n00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:53.780\nAnd so, it's possible if somebody, let me\ngive you an example, maybe Daniel logs in,\n\n301\n00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:58.280\nand he decides he hates Microsoft Word,\nso he uninstalls Microsoft Word.\n\n302\n00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:02.260\nWell if he does that, everybody looses\nMicrosoft Word, he just uninstalled it.\n\n303\n00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:03.170\nRight?\n\n304\n00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:06.600\nVersus if he just deleted the icon\neverybody else still has the icon.\n\n305\n00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.240\nRight?\n\n306\n00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.650\nSo we have to be careful with\ncertain system wide type changes.\n\n307\n00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:14.500\nBut other things, your Documents folder,\nyour wallpaper, your preferences,\n\n308\n00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.660\nInternet Explorer bookmarks,\nall that is part of your user profile and\n\n309\n00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:18.740\nit's not shared between the users.\n\n310\n00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:21.180\nAll right.\nNow let's talk a little bit about\n\n311\n00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.740\nthe Microsoft account.\n\n312\n00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:25.270\nOne of the things that I always get\nfrustrated with when I get a brand new\n\n313\n00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:28.310\ncomputer is,\nI love getting a new computer.\n\n314\n00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:32.150\nI love the faster hardware, but I hate\nthat it takes me two or three days to get\n\n315\n00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:36.470\nthat computer put back the way that I\nwant it, to get all the settings put back\n\n316\n00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:40.080\nin place, to reinstall my software,\nto do all these crazy things.\n\n317\n00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:44.580\nWell, if you have a cloud account,\nyour preferences, your wallpaper,\n\n318\n00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.520\nyour My Documents folder, all of\nthat stuff gets stored in the cloud,\n\n319\n00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.950\nout there in the Internet.\n\n320\n00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:52.420\nAnd so when you log in on a new\ncomputer with your cloud account,\n\n321\n00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:55.130\nstuff just synchronizes down,\nand you have it, right?\n\n322\n00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:58.500\nAnd so it makes getting set up on a new\ncomputer far more easy, and if you got\n\n323\n00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:02.740\nmore than one computer, you can use the\nsame account on more than one computer.\n\n324\n00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:05.702\nAnd now, you can be editing\na document on one computer, and\n\n325\n00:15:05.702 --> 00:15:09.750\nthen the next day you sit down on another\ncomputer, and it's got your same document.\n\n326\n00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:13.330\nIt's ready to go, ready to work with,\nall synchronized through the cloud.\n\n327\n00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:16.460\nIt's a great benefit of having\na Microsoft account, really it is.\n\n328\n00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.810\nIt's a good thing.\nThe other thing is if you get locked-out\n\n329\n00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:20.870\nof your account,\nyou can go to Microsoft's website and\n\n330\n00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.980\nyou can reset your password and\ngain access.\n\n331\n00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:26.080\nIf you lose the password for\na local account, you're kinda out of luck,\n\n332\n00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.950\nunless somebody made one of those\nrecovery disks, which, I can tell you,\n\n333\n00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:30.550\nvery few people actually do.\n\n334\n00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:33.720\nSo it is just a really good thing.\n\n335\n00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.590\nYou get a lot of benefits out\nof having that cloud account.\n\n336\n00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:39.670\nWell, let's say you're like me and\nyou set this computer up and\n\n337\n00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:40.850\nyou did a local account.\n\n338\n00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:44.370\nAnd you decide I really want\nto use that cloud account.\n\n339\n00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:46.891\nWell, you guys saw the option\nwhen I went into my settings.\n\n340\n00:15:46.891 --> 00:15:51.438\nIf I jump back into my charms bar, and\nthen from my charms bar I jump down to\n\n341\n00:15:51.438 --> 00:15:56.286\nSettings and go back down here to\nChange PC settings, all right, it's gonna\n\n342\n00:15:56.286 --> 00:16:00.941\npull me right back here, and I can go\nto Accounts and I can find my account.\n\n343\n00:16:00.941 --> 00:16:04.287\nAnd here it gives me the option\nto connect a Microsoft account.\n\n344\n00:16:04.287 --> 00:16:05.368\nSo when you install Windows,\n\n345\n00:16:05.368 --> 00:16:08.760\nyou can actually choose the Microsoft\naccount right during the installation.\n\n346\n00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:09.480\nRight?\n\n347\n00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:13.460\nBut after the fact, you can easily\nreconnect the local account to the cloud.\n\n348\n00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:16.640\nSo you don't have to do it at\ninstall time, you can do it later.\n\n349\n00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.840\nNow on my account,\nsee I don't have an account picture?\n\n350\n00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:24.556\nAnd if I take a look at my desktop\nwallpaper it's these blue lines and\n\n351\n00:16:24.556 --> 00:16:30.041\nI didn't even bother at looking at things\nlike my documents folder and stuff.\n\n352\n00:16:30.041 --> 00:16:32.558\nIf I go into my documents folder,\nwell I guess I have\n\n353\n00:16:32.558 --> 00:16:36.710\na couple little documents kind of laying\naround here on this local machine.\n\n354\n00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:38.570\nDo I have any pictures?\n\n355\n00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:39.460\nNo pictures, right?\n\n356\n00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:43.260\nSo I don't have much on this\nmachine because it's a new machine,\n\n357\n00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.860\nI just got logged in, so\nthere's not really anything there.\n\n358\n00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:47.600\nBut when I synchronize my cloud account,\n\n359\n00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.540\nit's going to start pulling\nthose settings down.\n\n360\n00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:53.160\nSo, I'm gonna to get here and\nget disconnected.\n\n361\n00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.810\nNow, when I got to connect,\nit asks for my local user password, so\n\n362\n00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:56.920\nI've got to provide that.\n\n363\n00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.980\nI'll punch in that current password.\n\n364\n00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:00.250\nAnd I'll hit Next.\n\n365\n00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:03.810\nAnd then it's going to ask me to\nsign into my Microsoft account.\n\n366\n00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:05.330\nThis is your cloud account.\n\n367\n00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:06.690\nYou probably already have one.\n\n368\n00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:09.210\nDaniel, how did you get your\nfirst Microsoft account?\n\n369\n00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:12.020\n>> Oh, well,\nyou know I got bugged by Microsoft.\n\n370\n00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:14.390\nDon't you want to sign in\nwith that Microsoft account?\n\n371\n00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.460\nIf you don't have one,\nyou can register for one right now.\n\n372\n00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:17.350\nIt's like hey, you know what?\n\n373\n00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:18.580\nThis looks like a pretty good idea.\n\n374\n00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:22.901\nI'll go ahead and register one, so I just\nsigned up for a free outlook.com account.\n\n375\n00:17:22.901 --> 00:17:24.470\n>> Mm-hm, and\nthat's how a lot of people get it.\n\n376\n00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:26.540\nIf you have a Hotmail account or\nan outlook.com account,\n\n377\n00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.030\nthose are Microsoft accounts.\n\n378\n00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:31.490\nIf you have an MSN account,\nthose are accounts with Microsoft.\n\n379\n00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:32.920\nIf you don't have one, you can create one.\n\n380\n00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:36.010\nIt's free, right down here,\nyou can choose to create a new account.\n\n381\n00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:38.760\nAnd when you create the account\nit basically needs to\n\n382\n00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.310\ntie to an email address somewhere.\n\n383\n00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:42.670\nBecause it needs to be able to\nsend you confirmation emails and\n\n384\n00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:44.180\npassword reset emails.\n\n385\n00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.730\nSo that's the key part is\nthis email address, and\n\n386\n00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:49.930\nyou can pick from a Microsoft email\naccount if you don't have one.\n\n387\n00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:52.730\nThey'll set one up for you and\nnow you'll have email, right?\n\n388\n00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:55.380\nOr you can choose to use\nyour existing email.\n\n389\n00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.320\nYou might already have an email account\nset up with Google, or Yahoo, or\n\n390\n00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.190\nsomebody else.\n\n391\n00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:03.500\nAnd so you can choose to use your favorite\nemail, and punch in an address right here.\n\n392\n00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.240\nSo you might have bob@aol.com and\n\n393\n00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:08.000\nyou could punch that in\nwith your other settings.\n\n394\n00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.700\nAnd it'll create a Microsoft account\nthat's tied to that address,\n\n395\n00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:11.930\nand that's kind of a neat thing.\n\n396\n00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:12.800\nAll right.\n\n397\n00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.160\nNow, I've already got one,\nso let me go back here.\n\n398\n00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.160\nAnd I'm gonna log in with\na Hotmail account that I have.\n\n399\n00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.870\nSo, I'll just punch that in.\n\n400\n00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:22.070\nAnd then I need to give my password.\n\n401\n00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:25.470\nNow, when you provide your password here,\non a local account,\n\n402\n00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:27.380\nyou just have a username and password, but\n\n403\n00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:31.060\non a cloud account, it supports\nsome additional security features.\n\n404\n00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:35.710\nFor example, multi-factor authentication,\nand that's how I have my account set up is\n\n405\n00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:40.690\nI don't need just a username and\npassword, I also need a passkey.\n\n406\n00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:44.640\nA number that's being generated\nby an application on my phone.\n\n407\n00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:48.470\nAnd so\nI'm going to do a television faux pa and\n\n408\n00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:49.730\nlook at my cellphone during the show.\n\n409\n00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:53.430\nSo I'm going to look down here to get\nmy current code and punch that in so\n\n410\n00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:56.360\nthat it will be able to\nauthorize this computer.\n\n411\n00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.820\nSo I'll provide that code and\nget it logged in.\n\n412\n00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.400\nIf you've ever seen multi-factor\nauthentication, it's pretty cool because\n\n413\n00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.780\nthat code right there is what's\ncalled a one-time password.\n\n414\n00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:05.750\nI just used it.\n\n415\n00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:07.240\nSome of you guys out there\nmight be thinking oh, shoot,\n\n416\n00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.140\nI just saw Don's code on the video.\n\n417\n00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.340\nI'm gonna go use that.\n\n418\n00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:13.030\nWell unfortunately I just used it,\nso it's not good anymore.\n\n419\n00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:17.330\nAnd within 60 seconds It'll be a new code,\nit changes every 60 seconds.\n\n420\n00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:18.960\nLike a very secure password.\n\n421\n00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.240\nThat's another advantage\nof using a cloud account,\n\n422\n00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.930\nis you can get account security like that,\nit's pretty impressive.\n\n423\n00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.400\nHere's it's informing me about\nsynchronizing my photos, my documents,\n\n424\n00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.370\nmy PC settings.\n\n425\n00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:32.210\nThese are all things that are going\nto come along with me using\n\n426\n00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:33.110\nthat Microsoft account.\n\n427\n00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:35.810\nNow, I'm going to choose switch.\n\n428\n00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:39.890\nIt's not going to tell me, but it's\na good idea to log out, and log back on,\n\n429\n00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:41.060\nonce you do this.\n\n430\n00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:44.730\nI've got it connected to\na Microsoft account now.\n\n431\n00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:48.150\nAnd so it's starting to synchronize\nthose settings in the background, and\n\n432\n00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:50.870\nit can take a moment depending\non how many settings you have.\n\n433\n00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:55.070\nBut over the next few minutes we'll see\nmy settings start to come back in, and\n\n434\n00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:58.160\nmy documents start to\nsynchronize back down.\n\n435\n00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.880\nNow while we're waiting on that,\nI'm gonna log out real quick.\n\n436\n00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.700\nAnd log back in just so\nI make sure I've got a clean account.\n\n437\n00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:07.270\nAnd I want to show you guys\nthe Windows control panel,\n\n438\n00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.500\nwhile we're waiting on this to sync.\n\n439\n00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.020\nNow, the Windows control panel,\nwhat is that?\n\n440\n00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:17.210\nI've shown you guys kind of adjusting\nwhere icons are on the start menu and\n\n441\n00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:20.320\nI've you guys adjusting\nother little settings, and\n\n442\n00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.140\nI said those are all part of your profile.\n\n443\n00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.470\nWhat's being synchronized down,\nthese settings.\n\n444\n00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:27.820\nWell there's a lot more settings\nthat are out there, and\n\n445\n00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:31.230\nthe number one place to go and\nfind them is the control panel.\n\n446\n00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:35.745\nThe control panel has a ton of data inside\nof it that will allow you to configure and\n\n447\n00:20:35.745 --> 00:20:37.365\ncustomize your computer.\n\n448\n00:20:37.365 --> 00:20:39.695\nOh, actually I said I was gonna wait for\nthe sync to happen,\n\n449\n00:20:39.695 --> 00:20:41.125\nit looks like it's already going on.\n\n450\n00:20:41.125 --> 00:20:43.755\nYou guys might have noticed my\ndesktop wallpaper was different.\n\n451\n00:20:43.755 --> 00:20:47.070\nNice little balloons now, and\nI've got a profile picture.\n\n452\n00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:47.840\nI didn't set that.\n\n453\n00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.430\nWhere did that come from?\n\n454\n00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:50.550\nIt came from my cloud account, right?\n\n455\n00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:54.920\nSo now I've nice little cloud picture,\nwhatever, thing there, I've got that.\n\n456\n00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.000\nAlso, I've got mail.\n\n457\n00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.380\nSee how I've got mail?\n\n458\n00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:01.540\nIt set up my Hotmail account in here so\nI can read and get emails.\n\n459\n00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.810\nThis is a live tile,\nI start to see that, too, right?\n\n460\n00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:07.820\nIf I let me,\nit thinks that it's a live tile.\n\n461\n00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:08.825\nThere we go, see?\n\n462\n00:21:08.825 --> 00:21:11.255\nBilling@Microsoft.com, need\nto read that one.\n\n463\n00:21:11.255 --> 00:21:12.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, anyhow,\n\n464\n00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:16.130\nthese things are kind of coming up and\nnow I can start to take advantage of that,\n\n465\n00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:18.600\nI didn't have to set it up,\nit did it for me.\n\n466\n00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:22.800\nAgain, the whole advantage of going to\na cloud system like this is to make sure\n\n467\n00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:28.570\nthat we have something that's easy to use,\nand simple to move between PCs.\n\n468\n00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:31.130\nAnd in fact, it should have brought\nmy files down with it, right?\n\n469\n00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:35.137\nSo if I, whoops,\nif I give us all a seizure by [LAUGH]\n\n470\n00:21:35.137 --> 00:21:37.486\n>> By switching desktops as fast as I can.\n\n471\n00:21:37.486 --> 00:21:40.795\nIf I jump here to my OneDrive,\nI can see I've got documents.\n\n472\n00:21:40.795 --> 00:21:42.345\nAnd there's my to-do list.\n\n473\n00:21:42.345 --> 00:21:44.035\nNow if I go back to my\nOneDrive I can go to pictures.\n\n474\n00:21:44.035 --> 00:21:45.065\nAnd here's some pictures.\n\n475\n00:21:45.065 --> 00:21:48.090\nI've gotta little ITProTV\nbehind the scenes picture.\n\n476\n00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:49.250\nLet's see.\nThere we go.\n\n477\n00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:50.760\nAnd what else do I have?\n\n478\n00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.430\nLooks like me testing a cable.\n\n479\n00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:55.430\nSo these all came down as\npart of my cloud account.\n\n480\n00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:58.340\nAnd so now this brand new computer\nI've never logged into before,\n\n481\n00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:59.220\nis already setup for me.\n\n482\n00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.220\nIt's already got my stuff.\n\n483\n00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.270\nIt's ready to rock.\n\n484\n00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:02.270\nIt's pretty cool.\n\n485\n00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:03.300\nOkay?\n\n486\n00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.550\nNow that Windows control\npanel I mentioned.\n\n487\n00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:10.510\nWell, if we bring up our start screen and\njust type control,\n\n488\n00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:13.370\nit'll be one of the first icons that\ncomes up on that control panel.\n\n489\n00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:16.335\nAnd you can jump into it, and\nyou'll see tons of settings.\n\n490\n00:22:16.335 --> 00:22:21.595\nThese settings,\nsome of them pertain to just you.\n\n491\n00:22:21.595 --> 00:22:24.895\nOther pertain to the system as a whole,\nall right?\n\n492\n00:22:24.895 --> 00:22:27.405\nAnd so when you make a change that\naffects the system as a whole,\n\n493\n00:22:27.405 --> 00:22:28.657\nthat's not part of your profile.\n\n494\n00:22:28.657 --> 00:22:30.962\nThat's not something that\nsynchronizes up to the cloud.\n\n495\n00:22:30.962 --> 00:22:35.092\nBut when you make changes that just\npertain to you, like your wallpaper, well,\n\n496\n00:22:35.092 --> 00:22:37.662\nthat is gonna synchronize up to the cloud.\n\n497\n00:22:37.662 --> 00:22:40.922\nSo when you start browsing through here\nit's kind of a mixture of those settings\n\n498\n00:22:40.922 --> 00:22:42.641\nand you can find what you need can need.\n\n499\n00:22:42.641 --> 00:22:44.091\nSometimes it can be a little challenging.\n\n500\n00:22:44.091 --> 00:22:45.651\nIt divides it up by categories.\n\n501\n00:22:45.651 --> 00:22:48.841\nSo if I want to find something\nlike how to change my wallpaper.\n\n502\n00:22:48.841 --> 00:22:50.201\nWell, where do I go?\n\n503\n00:22:50.201 --> 00:22:51.691\nI've got all sorts of stuff here.\n\n504\n00:22:51.691 --> 00:22:54.630\nWhich one of these would be wallpaper?\n\n505\n00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:56.190\nAppearance and personalization?\n\n506\n00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:57.300\nProbably, right.\n\n507\n00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.790\nSo if we go in there we can\nstart to see other items.\n\n508\n00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:01.610\nAnd actually we saw them back here, right?\n\n509\n00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:02.910\nChange desktop background.\n\n510\n00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:04.180\nIt's right here under it.\n\n511\n00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:06.270\nSo these are the most popular tasks.\n\n512\n00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:09.070\nMicrosoft's identified which\nones people use the most and\n\n513\n00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:10.280\nthen lists them right there.\n\n514\n00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.260\nBut if you go appearance and\n\n515\n00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:14.950\npersonalization you can see there's even\nmore options that weren't showing there.\n\n516\n00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:16.780\nAnd these are all things we can customize,\n\n517\n00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:20.260\nthe majority of which do\nsynchronize up with your account.\n\n518\n00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:23.695\nA quicker way to find these, let's say\nI want to adjust power management.\n\n519\n00:23:23.695 --> 00:23:24.285\nOkay?\n\n520\n00:23:24.285 --> 00:23:26.175\nBut where is power\nmanagement in this list?\n\n521\n00:23:26.175 --> 00:23:28.215\nWell, it's not anywhere.\n\n522\n00:23:28.215 --> 00:23:31.125\nIt's not on any of these items, so\nthat means it's buried under something.\n\n523\n00:23:31.125 --> 00:23:32.615\nMaybe it's under Hardware and Sound?\n\n524\n00:23:32.615 --> 00:23:34.855\nWe go under there and sure enough,\nthere's Power Options.\n\n525\n00:23:34.855 --> 00:23:36.580\nNow, how did I know it was there?\n\n526\n00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:37.530\nI memorized it, right?\n\n527\n00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:38.730\nI mean, that's how you know.\n\n528\n00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:39.700\nBut if you don't know,\n\n529\n00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:43.030\nif you don't have it memorized,\nyou got this search box up top.\n\n530\n00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:47.050\nIf I'm looking to configure the sleep\nsettings, or here's my favorite, right?\n\n531\n00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:49.610\nMy computer has a power button\nright on the top of it, right?\n\n532\n00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:53.860\nA lot of laptops do, and I've got a\ntoddler at home and he will walk right up.\n\n533\n00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:55.165\nAnytime I'm using the computer, and\n\n534\n00:23:55.165 --> 00:23:57.300\nthere's something about that\npower button that draws them.\n\n535\n00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:00.071\nAnd he'll hit it and the computer\ngoes to sleep and I hate that.\n\n536\n00:24:00.071 --> 00:24:02.587\nSo I might want to change\nwhat that button does.\n\n537\n00:24:02.587 --> 00:24:04.500\nWell, I don't know where\nto find that in here.\n\n538\n00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.713\nWell, you can just type button.\n\n539\n00:24:06.713 --> 00:24:09.780\nAnd it's gonna show you everything\nthat pertains to a button.\n\n540\n00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:10.620\nLike this one.\n\n541\n00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:12.260\nChange what the power buttons do.\n\n542\n00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:13.990\nThat's exactly what I wanted, right?\n\n543\n00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:15.690\nAll I had to know was one word, right?\n\n544\n00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:17.985\nOne noun.\nAnd that got me to where I wanted to be.\n\n545\n00:24:17.985 --> 00:24:19.825\nIf I wanted to find sleep settings.\n\n546\n00:24:19.825 --> 00:24:22.565\nWhat happens when you close\nthe lid to your laptop?\n\n547\n00:24:22.565 --> 00:24:25.475\nI could type lid, right?\n\n548\n00:24:25.475 --> 00:24:28.320\nAnd there we go change\nwhat closing the lid does.\n\n549\n00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.120\nMakes it super easy to\nfind these settings and\n\n550\n00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:33.140\nthen you can jump in there and\ncustomize it.\n\n551\n00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:38.400\nSo the lid setting is in here, and\nif I scroll down it should show up and,\n\n552\n00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:42.260\nactually you know what,\noh it's because I've got screen lock here.\n\n553\n00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:43.680\nSo some settings, like this one,\n\n554\n00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:45.610\nsays change settings that\nare currently available.\n\n555\n00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:49.818\nI have to be an administrator to change\nit, that means it's a system-wide setting.\n\n556\n00:24:49.818 --> 00:24:51.974\nSystem-wide settings you\nhave to be an administrator.\n\n557\n00:24:51.974 --> 00:24:54.090\nYou'll see a warning like this one.\n\n558\n00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:58.540\nAnd if I change that, there we go, now I\nget my power button settings right here so\n\n559\n00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:01.190\nI can change what happens when\nsomebody pushes the power button.\n\n560\n00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:03.960\nAnd I might say, look,\nif I'm plugged in, don't do anything.\n\n561\n00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.430\nIf I'm on battery, don't do anything.\n\n562\n00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:07.650\nMake the power button\ndo absolutely nothing.\n\n563\n00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:11.130\nAnd if I want the computer to go to sleep,\nit's either going to have to hit a timer\n\n564\n00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:12.850\nor I'm going to have to\ntell it to go to sleep.\n\n565\n00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:14.420\nRight, via the power menu.\n\n566\n00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.370\nBut don't let that button do it.\n\n567\n00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:17.720\nAnd changing the lid?\n\n568\n00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.690\nWell, when you look here,\nI've got define power buttons and\n\n569\n00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:21.900\nturn on password protection.\n\n570\n00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.430\nI didn't actually go to\nthe right place for the lid.\n\n571\n00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:26.570\nSo I'm gonna save that change.\n\n572\n00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:29.230\nAnd then I'm gonna edit my power profile.\n\n573\n00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:31.970\nAnd the lid functionality is actually\nin here, so we have to kinda have to\n\n574\n00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:36.240\ndig a little deeper and\nwe'll find what closing our lid does.\n\n575\n00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.643\nAnd here we go, power buttons and lid.\n\n576\n00:25:38.643 --> 00:25:40.533\nAnd, oh!\n\n577\n00:25:40.533 --> 00:25:42.874\n[LAUGH] I forgot, this machine\ndoesn't know it's a laptop, so\n\n578\n00:25:42.874 --> 00:25:45.580\nit doesn't know it that it has a lid,\nit knows that it has a power button.\n\n579\n00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:46.780\nThat's why I'm not seeing the lid option.\n\n580\n00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:48.120\nSo, there we go.\n\n581\n00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.210\nBut you can jump in and\ncustomize these options,\n\n582\n00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:53.450\nthe key takeaway here,\nthe control panel has a ton of settings.\n\n583\n00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:56.020\nIt's hard to find them.\n\n584\n00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:59.270\nUse the search field, the search field\nwill help you find what you need.\n\n585\n00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:03.160\n>> Never underestimate the power of\nthe search and help functions people.\n\n586\n00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.510\nThey will help you out\nmore than you realize.\n\n587\n00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:06.750\n>> Absolutely.\n\n588\n00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:10.390\nNow one negative about the control panel,\nit's not really touch optimized.\n\n589\n00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:13.750\nSo if you're on a touch screen tablet\nit can be a little difficult to use.\n\n590\n00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:16.510\nFortunately, Microsoft's\nincorporated a lot of these settings\n\n591\n00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:18.340\ninto the touch interface.\n\n592\n00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:21.170\nSo, for example,\nif you were to bring up your start menu.\n\n593\n00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:24.360\nWe can go to the charms bar and\naccess some of these same settings.\n\n594\n00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:28.140\nIf I bring up my charms bar,\nand I go to settings,\n\n595\n00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:31.820\ndown at the bottom I've got that Change\nPC Settings that we went to earlier.\n\n596\n00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:36.390\nIf I go there, what we'll see are a bunch\nof different options across the left side\n\n597\n00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:39.380\nand there's a link for the control panel\nright here at the bottom and if I click\n\n598\n00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:43.230\nthat it will take me to the actual control\npanel but that's not what I want, right?\n\n599\n00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:48.099\nWhat I want is if I go right back into\nchange PC settings, all these options\n\n600\n00:26:48.099 --> 00:26:52.300\nup here, all these options are really just\nsubsets of what's in the control panel but\n\n601\n00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:57.120\ntouch optimized so I can jump here\nan manage my one drive settings or\n\n602\n00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.080\nmy search and app functionality.\n\n603\n00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:03.620\nI can go to PC and devices and\nhere I can adjust my display.\n\n604\n00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:07.550\nWe've got power and sleep options right\nhere so I can adjust those same settings.\n\n605\n00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:10.300\nAnd this is touch optimized, right?\n\n606\n00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:13.820\nNow, every setting you see here is\navailable in the control panel.\n\n607\n00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:16.190\nThe control panel has 100% of the options.\n\n608\n00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:18.457\nThis, more like 50%.\n\n609\n00:27:18.457 --> 00:27:20.200\nOkay, they improved that in Windows 10.\n\n610\n00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.700\nIn Windows 10, it's more like 90%.\n\n611\n00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:25.460\nThe majority of it's in the touch\ninterface, but in Windows 8,\n\n612\n00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:27.470\nyou may find yourself still\ngoing to the control panel,\n\n613\n00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:30.220\nbecause certain options are there\nthat aren't present here.\n\n614\n00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:31.200\nBut these are easier to get to.\n\n615\n00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.160\nOnce you're in here you can come in\nhere and start to adjust all sorts\n\n616\n00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:37.080\nof different things as well as view\ninformation about your system.\n\n617\n00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.760\nSo that's all done.\n\n618\n00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.040\nRight through the touch UI.\n\n619\n00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.940\n>> And Don, that's gonna be the majority\nof what people are going for anyway,\n\n620\n00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:47.390\nthey put them right there, make it easy\naccess, so you barely should have to\n\n621\n00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:50.750\ngo to the control panel, unless you're\ndoing some major administrative work.\n\n622\n00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:51.880\n>> That's absolutely correct.\n\n623\n00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:55.090\nAll right, well, Daniel,\nthat's about all I've got on this one.\n\n624\n00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:57.750\nWhat we've seen are the different\ntypes of accounts.\n\n625\n00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:00.089\nRight?\nLocal accounts versus cloud accounts and\n\n626\n00:28:00.089 --> 00:28:02.156\ntheir settings are a little bit different.\n\n627\n00:28:02.156 --> 00:28:05.359\nRight, a local account's setting\nare stored right here on this machine, and\n\n628\n00:28:05.359 --> 00:28:06.410\nnowhere else.\n\n629\n00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:08.110\nA cloud account's stored\nout there in the cloud.\n\n630\n00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:09.680\nThat's why I was able to log in.\n\n631\n00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:12.360\nAnd quickly get this machine set\nup the way that I wanted it to.\n\n632\n00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:13.550\nAnd then those settings.\n\n633\n00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:15.470\nThe settings are spread\nout between two devices.\n\n634\n00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:18.460\nThe control panel and the touch interface.\n\n635\n00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:21.610\nAnd so throughout the rest of this series\nyou're gonna see us configuring things and\n\n636\n00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:22.790\nwe'll be going to those two places.\n\n637\n00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:25.840\nWe'll be going to the control panel or\nwe'll be going to the touch interface\n\n638\n00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.540\nTo go in and find those different\nsettings and adjust them.\n\n639\n00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:30.310\nSo you'll see a lot more\nof those down the road.\n\n640\n00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:33.290\nBut in this episode I just wanted to\ngive you guys an introduction to those,\n\n641\n00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:34.690\nkinda show you how it works.\n\n642\n00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:40.020\nAnd wet our beak a little bit as we get\ninto the world of Windows 8 itself.\n\n643\n00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.430\nThink that's about it.\n\n644\n00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:42.900\nDaniel, can you think\nof anything I left out?\n\n645\n00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:45.210\n>> No, you did a great job,\nthose were awesome demonstrations.\n\n646\n00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:48.550\nHopefully you viewers at home\nare loving this was excellent stuff.\n\n647\n00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:52.230\nHope you enjoyed this episode, we're\ngonna go ahead and sign off for ITProTV.\n\n648\n00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:54.530\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n649\n00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:55.166\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n650\n00:28:55.166 --> 00:28:56.768\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n651\n00:28:56.768 --> 00:29:02.960\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:17.921\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.921 --> 00:00:20.261\nHere with me today is my\ngood friend Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:20.261 --> 00:00:21.180\nHow's it going, Don?\n\n6\n00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.210\n>> It's going great, Daniel.\n\n7\n00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.840\nI'm excited to be back on the show and\n\n8\n00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.390\nwe're gonna be jumping more into our\nWindows operating systems configurations.\n\n9\n00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.870\nSo I think our official title for\nthis one is Configure Desktop Settings.\n\n10\n00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.330\nIn our first episode,\nwe talked about how to configure things.\n\n11\n00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.619\nRight?\nWe saw the control panel,\n\n12\n00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:37.909\nwe saw the settings options.\n\n13\n00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:40.580\nBut we didn't actually really\nconfigure much, right?\n\n14\n00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.940\nWe saw where to go, but now we wanna\nactually see some of the things we can\n\n15\n00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.420\ncustomize, so let's talk about that.\n\n16\n00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.350\nLet's talk about the most\ncontroversial one first.\n\n17\n00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.920\nRight?\n\n18\n00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.250\nWindows 8 introduced the modern UI.\n\n19\n00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.290\nThe start menu that we had\nin previous Windows is gone,\n\n20\n00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.700\nand has been replaced by\na full screen user interface,\n\n21\n00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.570\nthis is designed to be touch friendly,\nthis guy right here.\n\n22\n00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.450\nSo if you just got a brand\nnew Windows 8 machine,\n\n23\n00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.080\nit probably looks something like this.\n\n24\n00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.760\nNow I have to say probably\nbecause a lot of these buttons\n\n25\n00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.230\nare more than just a button.\n\n26\n00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.510\nThey're what I call live tiles.\n\n27\n00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.450\nAnd so the tiles are actually\nupdating to reflect something new.\n\n28\n00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.490\nSo you'll see over here I'm\ngetting some ads for some games,\n\n29\n00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.490\nI've got some news items, and\nsome a Sports information,\n\n30\n00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.660\nyou have Tom Brady is back and\njust as good as ever.\n\n31\n00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.300\nGood to know.\n\n32\n00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.684\nNow, if you're watching this episode live,\nthat's true, but if you're watching\n\n33\n00:01:27.684 --> 00:01:30.375\nthis episode a year from now,\nTom Brady might be on the injury list.\n\n34\n00:01:30.375 --> 00:01:31.897\nWho knows, right?\n\n35\n00:01:31.897 --> 00:01:33.460\nSo these live tiles are pretty neat.\n\n36\n00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.840\nRight?\nIt's a dynamic interface, and\n\n37\n00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.210\nthese nice big buttons\nare very touch friendly.\n\n38\n00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.130\nBut we might wanna customize this.\n\n39\n00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.680\nRight?\nWe might wanna change it around and\n\n40\n00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.772\nit's very easy to do.\n\n41\n00:01:42.772 --> 00:01:46.295\nRight?\nThe modern UI is very touch friendly.\n\n42\n00:01:46.295 --> 00:01:49.090\nSo on a touch screen you can hold and\ndrag on these, but\n\n43\n00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.590\neven with a mouse you can come in and\ncustomize these and\n\n44\n00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.205\nyou can take an item and\ndrag it and move it around.\n\n45\n00:01:56.205 --> 00:01:58.740\nRight?\nSo we can kinda change the way that works.\n\n46\n00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.580\nAnd as we work with these\nitems you'll see that there is\n\n47\n00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.390\nthings that you use a lot and\nthere's things that you don't use a lot.\n\n48\n00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.610\nAnd so with a mouse, if you right\nclick on an item, you can choose to\n\n49\n00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.910\nunpin it from start, which will\nbasically remove it from the screen.\n\n50\n00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.650\nYou can take something away.\n\n51\n00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.130\nAnd you can even uninstall,\nyou can open or you can resize.\n\n52\n00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.520\nThere's some of these icons that\nwe might want to be bigger or\n\n53\n00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.750\nsmaller based on whether or\nnot we actually use them a lot.\n\n54\n00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.420\nRight?\nLike here we got finance and\n\n55\n00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.970\nI can see stocks and how they're doing.\n\n56\n00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.960\nWell, maybe that's good news,\nmaybe it's bad news.\n\n57\n00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.400\nI might not want it to be a larger size.\n\n58\n00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.330\nSo, I can take it and make it smaller.\n\n59\n00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.930\nI can make it medium, I can make it large.\n\n60\n00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.300\nRight now, it's what's called a wedge.\n\n61\n00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.700\nIf I go large,\nsee it's gonna make it bigger, and\n\n62\n00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.600\nnow we can read that a little easier.\n\n63\n00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.030\nRight?\nSo we can kinda change and\n\n64\n00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.540\ncustomize these, and\nmake them the way we want.\n\n65\n00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.040\nNow you can also take them and\nturn the live tile off.\n\n66\n00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.170\nIf you get annoyed by all of that,\nyou can just right click on it and\n\n67\n00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.550\nchoose Turn Live Tile Off,\nAnd there it goes.\n\n68\n00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.540\nIf you're on a touch screen,\nyou can just hold your finger on it.\n\n69\n00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.730\nIf you hold press,\n\n70\n00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.950\nyou'll get that menu that comes up just\nlike my right click did right there.\n\n71\n00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.000\nAnd now I have a not so live title.\n\n72\n00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.510\nRight?\n\n73\n00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.460\nAnd now we can go in and use our system\nthe way we want or we can change it.\n\n74\n00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.310\nKinda do whatever it is that we want.\n\n75\n00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.319\nRight?\nSo kinda neat,\n\n76\n00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.523\ndifferent ways that we can configure\nthese just as far as the overall layout.\n\n77\n00:03:16.523 --> 00:03:20.043\nBut there's even more that we can\ncustomize as far as our start menu is\n\n78\n00:03:20.043 --> 00:03:22.930\nconcerned if we jump into\nour System Settings, right?\n\n79\n00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.970\nSo, to do that we need to\nget into our terms bar,\n\n80\n00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.040\nyou'd swipe in from the right\non a touch screen or\n\n81\n00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.245\nyou can float your mouse over there and\nit'll pop up automatically.\n\n82\n00:03:31.245 --> 00:03:33.370\nRight?\nAnd so once we're in our terms bar you\n\n83\n00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.390\ncan jump down to settings and\ninside of settings you've got\n\n84\n00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.990\ntwo options here that really pertain\nto the modern UI Personalize and Tiles.\n\n85\n00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.722\nIf I go to Personalize, well,\n\n86\n00:03:44.722 --> 00:03:47.800\nhere I can see where I can\nchange the background image.\n\n87\n00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.714\nThe first time I saw this option Daniel,\n\n88\n00:03:49.714 --> 00:03:52.257\nI didn't even realize there\nwas a background image.\n\n89\n00:03:52.257 --> 00:03:55.642\n>> It never even registered because you\nfocus on the tiles, but there's this\n\n90\n00:03:55.642 --> 00:03:59.840\nbackground image and mine's purple for\nwhatever reason and it's got swirly lines.\n\n91\n00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.730\nYou got all sorts of\nchoices you can pick from,\n\n92\n00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.470\nwe can go robots or\nI don't even know what that is.\n\n93\n00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.230\nWe have some crazy little\nanimals staring at us.\n\n94\n00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.764\nLet's go with that one.\n\n95\n00:04:07.764 --> 00:04:09.027\n>> Yeah, try to cool it up a little bit.\n\n96\n00:04:09.027 --> 00:04:09.749\n[LAUGH]\n>> Or maybe not.\n\n97\n00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:10.900\nIt might drive me crazy.\n\n98\n00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.450\nAnd you might like one of these images,\nlike this green one.\n\n99\n00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.210\nI like the image, but\nI want it to be blue.\n\n100\n00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:19.770\nAnd so we've got over here where you can\nkind of adjust the background colors, and\n\n101\n00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.320\npick something that's maybe\na little more to your liking.\n\n102\n00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.200\nAnd you can set the background color\nas well as the accent color to try and\n\n103\n00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.691\nget it to not be completely obnoxious or\nwhatever.\n\n104\n00:04:30.691 --> 00:04:33.047\nRight?\nSo you got a couple of different things\n\n105\n00:04:33.047 --> 00:04:36.439\nyou can customize and\ntailor to make the machine yours, right?\n\n106\n00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:38.000\nTo make it the way that you want.\n\n107\n00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.320\nAnd that was all under\nthe personalize menu.\n\n108\n00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.730\nBut then if we go to Tiles, here's where\nwe can customize a little bit more.\n\n109\n00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.210\nOkay, now, the options we're seeing\nhere are pretty straightforward.\n\n110\n00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.790\nRight?\n\n111\n00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.010\nWe've got clear personal\ninfo from my tiles.\n\n112\n00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.730\nAnd as you start doing\nthings in certain apps,\n\n113\n00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.621\nthe live tiles will\nupdate to reflect that.\n\n114\n00:04:56.621 --> 00:04:57.219\nRight?\nA great\n\n115\n00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:59.867\nexample is if you have Solitaire or\nMinesweeper installed.\n\n116\n00:04:59.867 --> 00:05:00.624\nRight?\n\n117\n00:05:00.624 --> 00:05:03.070\nTwo critical business\napplications in Windows.\n\n118\n00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.590\nIf you got those things installed,\nand you start playing, and\n\n119\n00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.270\nyou get a high score, the live tiles\nwill actually show your high score.\n\n120\n00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.410\nMaybe you don't want that.\n\n121\n00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.340\nSo you can choose to clear that out and\nit'll wipe it out.\n\n122\n00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.730\nYour high score's still there.\n\n123\n00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.170\nIt's still there in\nMinesweeper if you go in it,\n\n124\n00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.730\nbut the live tile won't reflect\nit anymore, so we can reset that.\n\n125\n00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.290\nThe other two options here let\nus turn on some hidden things.\n\n126\n00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.640\nOkay?\nThe first one is show more apps\n\n127\n00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.760\nin apps view.\n\n128\n00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.890\nOkay?\n\n129\n00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.250\nWhat's the apps view?\n\n130\n00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.870\nWell, when you're looking at your\nscreen here, this is the modern UI.\n\n131\n00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.192\nAnd it's not showing every\nprogram that's on your computer.\n\n132\n00:05:35.192 --> 00:05:38.365\nAll right, you might have other\napplications that don't show up here\n\n133\n00:05:38.365 --> 00:05:40.157\non the start menu, or on the modern UI.\n\n134\n00:05:40.157 --> 00:05:44.036\nSo, what we can do, is you can go\ndown here to this little down arrow.\n\n135\n00:05:44.036 --> 00:05:46.575\nRight?\nOn a touch screen, you can just swipe up,\n\n136\n00:05:46.575 --> 00:05:49.455\nbut on a mouse based computer\nyou can hit that down arrow.\n\n137\n00:05:49.455 --> 00:05:51.368\nAnd it's gonna show you more apps, and so\n\n138\n00:05:51.368 --> 00:05:54.376\nyou'll see other applications\nthat are here on your system, and\n\n139\n00:05:54.376 --> 00:05:57.504\nyou might have installed something,\nlike I installed WireShark.\n\n140\n00:05:57.504 --> 00:05:58.233\nRight?\n\n141\n00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:01.493\nI installed WireShark, I know I installed\nit, well, I can't see it here, but\n\n142\n00:06:01.493 --> 00:06:03.016\nit didn't show up on the start menu.\n\n143\n00:06:03.016 --> 00:06:05.331\nRight?\nWhen I was just on my regular start menu,\n\n144\n00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:07.650\nthere's no wireshark icon here.\n\n145\n00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:12.477\nSo I can go down here to the apps list,\nand I can find Wireshark in here and\n\n146\n00:06:12.477 --> 00:06:16.037\nI can pin it to my Start Menu so\nit will be there for me.\n\n147\n00:06:16.037 --> 00:06:17.091\nRight?\n\n148\n00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:17.803\nWhere'd it go?\n\n149\n00:06:17.803 --> 00:06:19.067\nOh, there it is.\nIt's in the Ws,\n\n150\n00:06:19.067 --> 00:06:21.500\nthat whole alphabet thing kinda helps.\n\n151\n00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.240\nSo I'll go and pin that to start,\nand now, there's WireShark.\n\n152\n00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.820\nAnd I can take that and move it based on\nwhether I use it a lot or whatever and\n\n153\n00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.490\nI can take it and maybe I do.\n\n154\n00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.988\nMaybe I use the heck out of it.\n\n155\n00:06:31.988 --> 00:06:34.800\nSo I wanna keep it as a medium icon, or\nI might want to make it a small one.\n\n156\n00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.660\nMaybe I only use it every now and\nthen and so\n\n157\n00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.590\nI want it to be small like\nthese guys right here.\n\n158\n00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.690\nSo you can kinda customize and tweak that.\n\n159\n00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:41.730\nAll right?\n\n160\n00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.410\nNow, the option that we saw over here\n\n161\n00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:50.060\nunder tile said show more apps in\nthe app view, what does that mean?\n\n162\n00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.960\nIt's already showing me\nthe apps in the apps view.\n\n163\n00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.740\nBut it's actually hiding some.\n\n164\n00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.090\nIt's hiding some default systems apps\nthat you wouldn't normally need and\n\n165\n00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.300\nwe can turn that on and\nnow it'll show those hidden apps too.\n\n166\n00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.930\nAnd these usually have to deal with\nsystem and configuration options but\n\n167\n00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.174\nyou'll see there's a few other things\nthat most people just never use and\n\n168\n00:07:06.174 --> 00:07:08.240\nso Microsoft hid them by default.\n\n169\n00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.152\nAnd the other one here is\nshow administrative tools.\n\n170\n00:07:10.152 --> 00:07:10.780\nAll right?\n\n171\n00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.101\nThe administrative tools, or\n\n172\n00:07:12.101 --> 00:07:15.520\neven more advanced configuration options\nthat a home user really never needs.\n\n173\n00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.414\nBut if you're an enterprise administrator,\nif you're supporting hundreds or thousands\n\n174\n00:07:19.414 --> 00:07:22.899\nof desktops, there are some options that\nare in there that are pretty useful, and\n\n175\n00:07:22.899 --> 00:07:24.132\nso you can turn those on too.\n\n176\n00:07:24.132 --> 00:07:25.030\nAll right?\n\n177\n00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:29.430\nAnd now if I go back you'll see my UI\nhere hasn't really changed all that much.\n\n178\n00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.800\nRight?\nI added WireShark to it and\n\n179\n00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.050\nif I kinda scroll around\nhere this hasn't changed.\n\n180\n00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:39.800\nBut if I go down here,\nsee how it says 21 new apps installed?\n\n181\n00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.360\nIt didn't just install 21 apps it's\njust there were 21 that were hidden.\n\n182\n00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.500\nAnd so those are now revealed.\n\n183\n00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.500\nAnd so when I come in here\nI'll see all these new ones.\n\n184\n00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.206\nHere's Administrative Tools and all\nthe administrative tools that were hidden\n\n185\n00:07:51.206 --> 00:07:53.778\nunderneath it before,\nwhich I guess there was 21 of.\n\n186\n00:07:53.778 --> 00:07:57.582\nAnd we might see a few other things creep\nup in here that might have been hidden\n\n187\n00:07:57.582 --> 00:07:58.842\nthat are now showing up.\n\n188\n00:07:58.842 --> 00:08:00.962\nAll right, so\nthat's what those options do and\n\n189\n00:08:00.962 --> 00:08:03.048\nallows us to customize\nthis a little bit more.\n\n190\n00:08:03.048 --> 00:08:07.178\nAll right, so those are some changes we\ncan make to the start menu to kinda get it\n\n191\n00:08:07.178 --> 00:08:08.312\nthe way that we want.\n\n192\n00:08:08.312 --> 00:08:10.877\nAll right, we try to make it\nwhere it's supporting us and\n\n193\n00:08:10.877 --> 00:08:12.221\nhelping the way that we work.\n\n194\n00:08:12.221 --> 00:08:14.688\nAll right, some of the other things\nthat we might want to change.\n\n195\n00:08:14.688 --> 00:08:17.850\nRight?\nThat was just the modern UI here.\n\n196\n00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.060\nI might have a certain preference for\nmy modern UI.\n\n197\n00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.610\nI might want this background and\nthese icons and this is the way I want it.\n\n198\n00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:26.410\nBut I might share my\ncomputer with someone else.\n\n199\n00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:28.553\nAnd they want something\ncompletely different.\n\n200\n00:08:28.553 --> 00:08:29.200\nRight?\n\n201\n00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.910\nThey want that crazy creepy\nanimal background and\n\n202\n00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:35.850\ndifferent programs,\nmaybe it's one of your kids and so\n\n203\n00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.610\nyou want a kid to be able to log in and\nhave a kid experience.\n\n204\n00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:43.090\nThey don't care about stocks and\nsports news, they want the kid experience.\n\n205\n00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:46.910\nBut I can't customize this menu cause\nit's customizing it for me too.\n\n206\n00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:51.150\nSo instead what I can do is\nI can create user profiles.\n\n207\n00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:52.870\nAnd user profiles are tied\nto user accounts.\n\n208\n00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:56.030\nSo basically you create separate\nuser accounts on your system.\n\n209\n00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:59.560\nAnd when a user logs in they can get\ntheir own personalized experience, and\n\n210\n00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.470\nsomeone else can log in and\nthey get their personalized experience.\n\n211\n00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:05.500\nAll right, so\nto do that is not a terribly hard thing.\n\n212\n00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.650\nWhat we need to do is\njump into our charms bar,\n\n213\n00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:10.060\nso I'm gonna just bring that guy back up.\n\n214\n00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:14.812\nAnd then I'm gonna go right down here to\nsettings, and way down at the bottom,\n\n215\n00:09:14.812 --> 00:09:16.833\nwe'll go to change PC settings.\n\n216\n00:09:16.833 --> 00:09:17.680\nAll right?\n\n217\n00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.710\nAnd once we're in here, you'll see a menu\nitem for accounts and if you bought your\n\n218\n00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.760\ncomputer from Dell or HP or whatever\nyou like, you'll only have one account.\n\n219\n00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.710\nAnd you'll see that's exactly how I am,\nI have Don Pezet, that's my local account.\n\n220\n00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:29.298\nI don't have any more.\n\n221\n00:09:29.298 --> 00:09:34.080\nOkay, but on the left side we can go\nto other accounts and you can add more.\n\n222\n00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.870\nSo you can create accounts for family or\n\n223\n00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.960\nif this is a work computer that's shared\neach employee can have their own account.\n\n224\n00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.910\nWe can add those in and get them created.\n\n225\n00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:45.460\nOkay, now there's two types of accounts\nhere, the normal account that I'm about to\n\n226\n00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.120\ncreate, and then there's\nwhat's called a Signed Access,\n\n227\n00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.980\nand those are really restrictive\naccounts that don't save their changes.\n\n228\n00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.060\nSo when they log out everything gets lost.\n\n229\n00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.030\nWe don't normally use those.\n\n230\n00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:57.980\nThey're like for\nKiosk applications or school apps.\n\n231\n00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.162\nBut for most of us,\nwe're gonna go to add an account and\n\n232\n00:10:00.162 --> 00:10:01.449\nwe're gonna put in an account.\n\n233\n00:10:01.449 --> 00:10:05.541\nNow, it's gonna default to wanting\nto do a Microsoft account, right?\n\n234\n00:10:05.541 --> 00:10:08.510\nSo put in an email address and so on.\n\n235\n00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:10.680\nBut you don't have to\nuse a Microsoft account.\n\n236\n00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.100\nYou can choose to sign in\nwithout a Microsoft account.\n\n237\n00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.401\nAnd it's gonna create a user account\nright here on this computer.\n\n238\n00:10:16.401 --> 00:10:20.354\nAll right, in addition,\nyou can add a child's account.\n\n239\n00:10:20.354 --> 00:10:23.786\nAll right, so here's where we can add in\nthat special account and have a separate\n\n240\n00:10:23.786 --> 00:10:26.980\nprofile that's configured properly for\na child with restricted access.\n\n241\n00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.750\nWe can restrict what hours they're\nallowed to access the Internet,\n\n242\n00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.250\nwhat programs are allowed to run,\nand so on.\n\n243\n00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:32.030\nIt's all right in there.\n\n244\n00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:33.920\nI'm gonna create a normal account,\nthough, here.\n\n245\n00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.150\nI'll choose to sign in\nwithout a Microsoft account.\n\n246\n00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:39.090\nAnd it's just reminding me of how great\na Microsoft account would be if I had one,\n\n247\n00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:41.740\nbut I'm gonna continue\nwith a local account.\n\n248\n00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:42.320\nRight.\n\n249\n00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.630\nAnd I'll create an account here for,\nwe'll do John Doe.\n\n250\n00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:49.650\nAnd we'll give John\na super secure password.\n\n251\n00:10:52.414 --> 00:10:54.282\nAnd we'll get his account created.\n\n252\n00:10:54.282 --> 00:10:56.830\nOkay, now it's asking me again\nif it's a child's account,\n\n253\n00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:59.778\nhere's another chance to go in and\nturn on that family safety feature.\n\n254\n00:10:59.778 --> 00:11:02.804\nBut for mine I'll just create\na regular account for John Doe.\n\n255\n00:11:02.804 --> 00:11:05.684\nAll right?\nNow, my computer has two profiles,\n\n256\n00:11:05.684 --> 00:11:09.644\na profile for me, Don Pezet,\nand a profile for John Doe, and\n\n257\n00:11:09.644 --> 00:11:12.890\nI can switch back and forth between them.\n\n258\n00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:14.480\nSo I'm logged in right now as Don Pezet.\n\n259\n00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.110\nIf I pull up my Start menu, I see that.\n\n260\n00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:16.720\nRight?\n\n261\n00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:22.600\nBut if I click on Don Pezet, I can\nsign out, or I can switch to John Doe.\n\n262\n00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.370\nIf I switch to John Doe,\n\n263\n00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:27.680\nall my programs are still running in\nthe background they're still there.\n\n264\n00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.680\nAny unsaved data,\nit's all still in the background.\n\n265\n00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.830\nI'm still logged in.\n\n266\n00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:32.460\nBut now I can login as John.\n\n267\n00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.370\nAnd I'm gonna see this.\n\n268\n00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:35.930\nHi, we're setting things up for you.\n\n269\n00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:38.180\nIt's building John's profile.\n\n270\n00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.820\nAnd John is gonna have a default profile.\n\n271\n00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.120\nOne that's set up with\nthe defaults from Microsoft.\n\n272\n00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.160\nIt's not gonna have the blue\nbackground that I set up, or\n\n273\n00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.830\nthe additional Start\nmenu items that I added.\n\n274\n00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.670\nIt's just gonna be customized to him.\n\n275\n00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:52.489\nSo separate user accounts are really\nhandy for that on a shared computer.\n\n276\n00:11:52.489 --> 00:11:55.100\nNow if it's not a shared computer,\nyou don't really care about that, right?\n\n277\n00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.190\nBut if it is a shared computer,\nit's definitely useful.\n\n278\n00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:58.700\n>> Yeah, Don, I see this all the time.\n\n279\n00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:02.100\nA lot of people call up, and\nthey're saying, I'm Having trouble with\n\n280\n00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:05.570\nmy computer and you realize,\nyou got three or four people logging on.\n\n281\n00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:10.370\nThey're adding start menu items,\nthey're installing software,\n\n282\n00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:12.140\nand people are like where's\nall this coming from?\n\n283\n00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:15.830\nWell that's because they don't realize\nthe power of having multiple profiles.\n\n284\n00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:18.980\nJust being able to separate,\nthis is me and this is you and\n\n285\n00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:22.610\nnever the twin shall meet is a very,\nvery handy item to have.\n\n286\n00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:24.180\nThat way I can see, well, okay,\n\n287\n00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:27.200\nDon's logged in,\neverything that he likes is there.\n\n288\n00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.420\nHe has resolutions that he likes,\nhe has backgrounds that he likes,\n\n289\n00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:34.070\nhe has fonts that he likes and\nit all shows up as soon as he logs in.\n\n290\n00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:37.750\nIf I come along, I've logged on out,\nI've logged in as myself, I get all of\n\n291\n00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:41.540\nthe things that I like because maybe\nhe likes things that I don't like.\n\n292\n00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.162\nI'm a wild fan about\nthe crazy animal background.\n\n293\n00:12:44.162 --> 00:12:47.500\nI wanna have it, I've gotta have it,\nand if I don't have it I feel weird, so\n\n294\n00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.540\nI can go in and set that and\nmake sure that is happening.\n\n295\n00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.210\nThis is something that most people\ndon't even realize they can take\n\n296\n00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:53.310\nadvantage of this.\n\n297\n00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:56.580\nSo if you're talking to somebody and\nthey're saying, hey you know I really\n\n298\n00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:59.090\nhate that I got to share this computer,\nsay, its not a big deal create\n\n299\n00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:02.315\na separate profile and everybody can have\ntheir own settings the way they like it.\n\n300\n00:13:02.315 --> 00:13:03.615\nIt's a very handy feature.\n\n301\n00:13:03.615 --> 00:13:04.895\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n302\n00:13:04.895 --> 00:13:08.415\nAll right now, I've logged in here as John\nDoe and we can see that instead of having\n\n303\n00:13:08.415 --> 00:13:11.555\nthe blue background that I had and\nall the other crazy things,\n\n304\n00:13:11.555 --> 00:13:15.747\nthe adjustments that I made here, he sees\nthe purple background with the wavy lines.\n\n305\n00:13:15.747 --> 00:13:17.457\nHis live tiles are set, so\n\n306\n00:13:17.457 --> 00:13:21.427\nhis stock ticker is still a live tile,\nversus mine that's not.\n\n307\n00:13:21.427 --> 00:13:23.387\nAnd it's that separate profile.\n\n308\n00:13:23.387 --> 00:13:25.827\nSo he can operate the way\nthat he wants to, and\n\n309\n00:13:25.827 --> 00:13:27.718\nthen we can switch right back to me.\n\n310\n00:13:27.718 --> 00:13:30.108\nSee how it says I'm still\nsigned in on the background.\n\n311\n00:13:30.108 --> 00:13:34.818\nI can switch to me, punch in my password,\nand now I've got my blue background,\n\n312\n00:13:34.818 --> 00:13:37.420\nI've got my Wire Shark pinned,\neverything is back the way I want it.\n\n313\n00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:38.675\nRight?\nSo those are user profiles and\n\n314\n00:13:38.675 --> 00:13:39.672\nthey're pretty important.\n\n315\n00:13:39.672 --> 00:13:44.060\n>> Now Don, is there any advantage to,\nwe saw that you can be able to sign out.\n\n316\n00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.169\nRight?\nOr you could do the switch users.\n\n317\n00:13:46.169 --> 00:13:48.089\nIs there an advantage to\nusing one over the other?\n\n318\n00:13:48.089 --> 00:13:51.371\n>> So\nit all comes down to preference really.\n\n319\n00:13:51.371 --> 00:13:54.264\nSo when you log out, right?\n\n320\n00:13:54.264 --> 00:13:55.149\nLet's start with that, right?\n\n321\n00:13:55.149 --> 00:14:00.450\nSo if I'm running five programs and\nI log out, those five programs close.\n\n322\n00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:01.660\nThey all close down.\n\n323\n00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:03.260\nIf I had unsaved data, I lose it.\n\n324\n00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.700\nRight?\nIf I've saved my data, it's fine,\n\n325\n00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:05.950\nit just closes.\n\n326\n00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:07.110\nAnd now somebody else can log in.\n\n327\n00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:08.710\nAll right?\n\n328\n00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:10.600\nIf I just switch users,\n\n329\n00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.140\nwhen you switch users your programs\nstay running in the background.\n\n330\n00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.020\nI might be eating up a ton of memory.\n\n331\n00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.810\nI might have ten programs up,\nI'm eating up a ton of ram.\n\n332\n00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:21.150\nWe switch over to John, and\nnow John has a slow computer\n\n333\n00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:23.350\nbecause all my stuff's still\nrunning in the background.\n\n334\n00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.950\nOkay?\n\n335\n00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:28.070\nSo, on a positive side, using switch\nusers allows you to keep all of\n\n336\n00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:31.690\nyour applications running, quickly\nmove back and forth, and life is good.\n\n337\n00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:34.986\nOn a negative side, you can have some\nperformance issues because the users\n\n338\n00:14:34.986 --> 00:14:38.088\nare kinda competing for resources if\nthey leave a bunch of stuff open.\n\n339\n00:14:38.088 --> 00:14:42.984\nIf you log out, all your stuff closes, the\nother user logs in and now it's just them,\n\n340\n00:14:42.984 --> 00:14:44.810\nthey have exclusive access.\n\n341\n00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:49.610\nSo preference, performance, that's kind\nof what's gonna make that determination.\n\n342\n00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:53.410\nAll right, now what we've been\ncustomizing here is the modern UI, right?\n\n343\n00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:57.070\nThe start screen,\nwhich is great on a touch enabled system.\n\n344\n00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:59.850\nBut if you're not on\na touch enabled system then\n\n345\n00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:01.430\nyou're probably not gonna\nuse this that much.\n\n346\n00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.370\nYou're gonna jump down\nto the desktop view.\n\n347\n00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:04.290\nThis guy, right here.\n\n348\n00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:06.470\nAll right?\nAnd it can be customized, too, right?\n\n349\n00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:09.170\nThere's a lot of stuff that we can\nadjust here when you're in your regular\n\n350\n00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:10.340\ndesktop view.\n\n351\n00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.400\nAnd so you'll see,\nif you just right click on your desktop,\n\n352\n00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.370\nyou've got things like screen\nresolution and personalize.\n\n353\n00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:18.210\nAnd if we jump under personalize.\n\n354\n00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:20.234\nYou can adjust your theme,\nyour backgrounds.\n\n355\n00:15:20.234 --> 00:15:21.950\nRight?\nThese are the settings that we've had in\n\n356\n00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:23.260\nWindows for years.\n\n357\n00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.530\nThey're all still there for\nthe desktop too.\n\n358\n00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:29.373\nSo just be aware that there's really\ntwo separate sets of settings, one for\n\n359\n00:15:29.373 --> 00:15:32.986\nwhen you're in desktop mode and\none for when you're in modern UI mode.\n\n360\n00:15:32.986 --> 00:15:35.125\nAll right, and a lot of them overlap.\n\n361\n00:15:35.125 --> 00:15:37.080\nRight?\nSo, let's take screen resolution.\n\n362\n00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.710\nSo if I take a look at\nmy screen resolution.\n\n363\n00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:41.370\nI'll just right-click on the desktop and\ngo to screen resolution.\n\n364\n00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:44.329\nYou can see I'm set to 1366 by 768.\n\n365\n00:15:44.329 --> 00:15:48.414\nMaybe I don't want that,\nmaybe I want to be 1280 by 720.\n\n366\n00:15:48.414 --> 00:15:48.930\nRight?\n\n367\n00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:52.100\nWell, I can come in and\nadjust that and get right here, so\n\n368\n00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.955\nI can choose what resolution\nI want on this system.\n\n369\n00:15:54.955 --> 00:15:55.698\nAll right?\n\n370\n00:15:55.698 --> 00:15:59.110\nI can do the same thing from\nthe monitoring line, from here.\n\n371\n00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:01.421\nI can go to my Charms bar.\n\n372\n00:16:01.421 --> 00:16:03.260\nI can jump over to settings.\n\n373\n00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:08.310\nAnd then from here we can\ngo into change PC settings.\n\n374\n00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:10.480\nThis one's kind of buried a little deep.\n\n375\n00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.470\nWe gotta kinda dive into it here.\n\n376\n00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:14.080\nAnd when we go in to change PC settings.\n\n377\n00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.930\nOh, I'm still in Accounts from\nearlier in the episode, so\n\n378\n00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:17.120\nI gotta hit back on that one.\n\n379\n00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.450\nWe can go in here and\nfind our PC and Devices.\n\n380\n00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:23.110\nAnd inside of PC and\nDevices we can find display.\n\n381\n00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:26.170\nAnd right here,\nI can adjust my resolution.\n\n382\n00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.690\nNow that was a lot of\nsteps to get there right?\n\n383\n00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:32.440\nIt took a while to get there, but it is\navailable, it is there in a way that's\n\n384\n00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.800\na little more touch friendly,\nyou know swipe and tap to get there.\n\n385\n00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.530\nVersus on the desktop you got to\nright click to access that menu, so\n\n386\n00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:41.240\njust different modes of accessing.\n\n387\n00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.140\nBe aware that with Microsoft,\nthere's often times four or\n\n388\n00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:47.360\nfive different ways to achieve\nthe same goal and they're all right,\n\n389\n00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.840\nit's really just which\none you prefer to use.\n\n390\n00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.840\nBut you'll see overlap like this where you\ncan come in and adjust your resolution,\n\n391\n00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.620\nyou can adjust a lot\nof different settings.\n\n392\n00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:57.770\nIn both manners, from the desktop or\nfrom a hard drive.\n\n393\n00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:59.880\nAll right, another thing I wanna mention.\n\n394\n00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:05.500\nIf you're dealing with a work computer,\non a work computer it might be joined to\n\n395\n00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.370\nwhat's called\na Microsoft Active Directory.\n\n396\n00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:12.260\nAnd a Microsoft Active Directory is\na way to centrally manage computers.\n\n397\n00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:16.270\nAnd so when you log in on a computer, a\nlot of your settings might already be set\n\n398\n00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:18.780\nfor you even though you're not\nusing a Microsoft account, and\n\n399\n00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.750\nthat's because a system administrator\nmight have already set them.\n\n400\n00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:25.380\nYou won't see this on a home computer, but\non a work computer in a business where\n\n401\n00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.970\nthey have an active directory,\nthe people who run the IT department,\n\n402\n00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:33.310\nthey can push settings out to the business\ncomputers so that they're preconfigured.\n\n403\n00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:35.198\nNot just so\nthat they're preconfigured, but so\n\n404\n00:17:35.198 --> 00:17:38.201\nthat they can lock the settings to stop\nyou from unconfiguring them, right?\n\n405\n00:17:38.201 --> 00:17:41.981\nThey might have a wallpaper they want\ndisplayed that has the company logo,\n\n406\n00:17:41.981 --> 00:17:44.324\nand they don't want you to change it,\nright?\n\n407\n00:17:44.324 --> 00:17:48.295\nSo when you come in to change your\nwallpaper on a system, when you go to\n\n408\n00:17:48.295 --> 00:17:53.380\npersonalize or whatever, you might see\nthat option and not be able to change it.\n\n409\n00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:58.320\nSo when we go into our personalize,\nthis option might be grayed out, or\n\n410\n00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.820\nsame thing on our desktop view.\n\n411\n00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.790\nIf I go here, and I choose personalize,\nthese might be grayed out,\n\n412\n00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:06.160\nI might not be able to change them.\n\n413\n00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.950\nThat means that a system\nadministrator has set those and\n\n414\n00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:10.190\nyou don't have permission to change them.\n\n415\n00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:11.590\nThat does happen, okay.\n\n416\n00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.570\nWhat they're using are what\nare called group settings.\n\n417\n00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:18.330\nGroup settings are defined in\na group policy object or a GPO.\n\n418\n00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.630\nDon't worry too much about\nthe details on that.\n\n419\n00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:23.530\nYou'll see that if you go on\nto do the MCSA certification,\n\n420\n00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:25.110\nyou'll get exposed to a lot of that.\n\n421\n00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:29.140\nBut the way group policies work, is it\nlets an administrator define a system of\n\n422\n00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:32.950\nsettings, and\nthen push it out to hundreds, thousands,\n\n423\n00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:35.120\ntens of thousands of computers,\nin one stroke.\n\n424\n00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.950\nSo if I want to change the wallpaper on a\nthousand computers, I don't have to go to\n\n425\n00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:42.830\neach one individually and change it,\nI can just change it in one place,\n\n426\n00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:46.860\nthe group policy, and then just push\nthat setting out to all the computers.\n\n427\n00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.870\nSo if you're on a work computer and\nsome of these options aren't available for\n\n428\n00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:52.300\nyou to change,\nit's because you don't have permission.\n\n429\n00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.091\nIt's because they've been locked, and\n\n430\n00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:56.196\nthey're probably locked\ndue to a group policy.\n\n431\n00:18:56.196 --> 00:18:57.555\nAnd you can actually see that,\n\n432\n00:18:57.555 --> 00:18:59.964\nif you wanna mess around with\nit on your home computer.\n\n433\n00:18:59.964 --> 00:19:04.671\nOn your start menu, if you just type\ngroup in the little search box,\n\n434\n00:19:04.671 --> 00:19:06.970\nedit group policy will come up.\n\n435\n00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:10.280\nIt's a hidden item,\nwe don't see it in the normal start menu.\n\n436\n00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:16.690\nBut edit group policy, and what it\nwill bring you is a kind of small and\n\n437\n00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:21.950\nhard to read screen that lists tons and\ntons and tons of settings.\n\n438\n00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:24.360\nDaniel, do you have any idea\nhow many settings there are?\n\n439\n00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:28.050\n>> Oh there's like,\nI think over 4,000 if I'm not mistaken.\n\n440\n00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:28.570\n>> It's a lot.\n\n441\n00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:29.490\n>> Yeah, it's a lot.\n\n442\n00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:32.190\n>> And with each version\nof Windows they add more.\n\n443\n00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:36.660\nSo when Windows 2000 came out,\nthere were almost 1000 settings.\n\n444\n00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:40.850\nAnd then when Windows XP came out,\nwhen Windows Vista came out,\n\n445\n00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:44.860\nWindows 7, Windows 8, with each version\nof Windows they add more and more.\n\n446\n00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:45.530\nAnd it is over 4,000.\n\n447\n00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:48.900\nI don't know the exact number now, but\nit is a massive amount of settings.\n\n448\n00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.700\nBut it's everything.\n\n449\n00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.530\nEvery setting to do with your computer,\n\n450\n00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:56.080\neven settings that don't show up in\nthe start menu or in the control panel.\n\n451\n00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.530\nThey just aren't even there, right?\n\n452\n00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.510\nWhere you can go in here and\ncustomize them.\n\n453\n00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:01.440\nSo really impressive settings for\n\n454\n00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.850\nadministrators and if you drill\ndown inside of one of these things,\n\n455\n00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:09.770\nyou'll find stuff like, in the last show\nwe talked about power management right?\n\n456\n00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:11.970\nAnd so I went into the control panel and\n\n457\n00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:14.760\nI used the power management\ntools to adjust that.\n\n458\n00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:19.660\nWell, for a business, doing something\nas simple as setting a sleep timer for\n\n459\n00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:22.300\na thousand computers can actually have\na noticeable difference on the power bill.\n\n460\n00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:23.540\nThey can save some money.\n\n461\n00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:27.040\nAnd so, they might not want their\nemployees to be able to disable sleep,\n\n462\n00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.310\nlike I did in that show.\n\n463\n00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:31.820\nSo, we might choose to put those\nsettings here in a group setting and\n\n464\n00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:32.990\npush it out, right?\n\n465\n00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:36.470\nSo, if we browse through here,\nit's really hard to find things in here,\n\n466\n00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:39.570\nso I actually wrote this down before\nthe show so I'd know where to find it.\n\n467\n00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:43.890\nIf I go into computer configuration,\nand then administrative templates, and\n\n468\n00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:49.130\nthen in there browse down to system,\nand inside of system I'm looking for\n\n469\n00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:51.600\npower management, there it is.\n\n470\n00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.490\nRight in here I'll see all my\npower management settings and\n\n471\n00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:59.280\nthey're kind of hard to read because\nthis particular application is not\n\n472\n00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.540\noptimized for the high resolution\nscreens that we have now, and\n\n473\n00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:06.610\nstuff like that, so if it looks small\nin the video, it's small in real life.\n\n474\n00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:08.390\nThis just kinda how it is.\n\n475\n00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:11.660\nBut if you look at it, you've got\nthings like your sleep settings,\n\n476\n00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:13.410\nyour button settings, right?\n\n477\n00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:15.670\nWhat to do when someone\ncloses the lid of the laptop.\n\n478\n00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:17.400\nThose settings are all in here.\n\n479\n00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:21.710\nAnd they can define those, and\nthey can say \"set the lid switch action\n\n480\n00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:25.740\nwhen it's plugged in\" and set the lid\nswitch action when it's on battery.\n\n481\n00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:30.590\nAnd they define it once, and it pushes out\nto all the machines across the company,\n\n482\n00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:35.480\nand now we get the benefit od\nhaving great energy savings, or\n\n483\n00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:38.760\nwhatever it is that we're trying to\nachieve, a consistent wallpaper or\n\n484\n00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:42.200\nIncreased security by doing\na lock screen on a screen saver.\n\n485\n00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:46.796\nThose kind of settings we can\npush out all in one fell swoop.\n\n486\n00:21:46.796 --> 00:21:51.382\nAll right, well as far as doing basic\ncustomization, you guys have seen where we\n\n487\n00:21:51.382 --> 00:21:55.234\ngo in and change things,\nseeing several different options there.\n\n488\n00:21:55.234 --> 00:21:58.660\nThere's one more thing I want to talk\nabout here, before we wrap this one up,\n\n489\n00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.380\nand that's shortcuts.\n\n490\n00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:01.320\nOkay?\n\n491\n00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.980\nYou've noticed, as I moved through a lot\nof these settings that some of them took\n\n492\n00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:08.500\na lot of clicks,\nthat took a lot of navigating to get to,\n\n493\n00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:12.140\nlike adjusting screen resolution\nvia the touch interface.\n\n494\n00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:14.870\nBecause I had to go to my Charms bar.\n\n495\n00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:16.320\nI had to go to Settings.\n\n496\n00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.310\nI had to do all these different things\n\n497\n00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:22.790\njust to finally get to\nthat one little setting.\n\n498\n00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:26.060\nAnd it takes eight clicks,\nI guess that was five clicks.\n\n499\n00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:28.090\nSo it takes about five\nclicks to get there and\n\n500\n00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:30.060\nactually get to the setting that I want.\n\n501\n00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:35.680\nWell, Windows is packed full of shortcut\ncommands that you can use to save time,\n\n502\n00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.100\nor use to make life\na little bit easier on you.\n\n503\n00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:42.790\nNow, if you're on a tablet, if you're on\na touch interface, the shortcuts don't\n\n504\n00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:46.740\nhelp you, right, cuz all you have is\ntouch and so you rely on this mechanism.\n\n505\n00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:50.150\nBut if you're on a desktop, if you have a\nkeyboard, right, or if you're on a tablet\n\n506\n00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:54.590\nwith a keyboard, the keyboard shortcuts\ncan really save you some time, right?\n\n507\n00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:55.890\nLet me show you a couple.\n\n508\n00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:57.980\nThere are several that people\nare already used to, right,\n\n509\n00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:59.510\nlike using the Windows key.\n\n510\n00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:01.760\nOn your keyboard you have a button\nthat has the Windows logo on it.\n\n511\n00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.270\nWhen you hit that it\nbrings up the Start Menu.\n\n512\n00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:07.950\nThat's an example of a keyboard shortcut,\nthat's a really simple one.\n\n513\n00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:08.880\nBut there's others,\n\n514\n00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:14.290\nlike being able to switch between running\napplications where you can do Alt+Tab.\n\n515\n00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:17.920\nIf you hit Alt+Tab on your keyboard, if\nyou have more than one application open.\n\n516\n00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.300\nSo like I've got\nInternet Explorer here and.\n\n517\n00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.480\nMaybe I open up my file explorer, right?\n\n518\n00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.330\nSo I've got these\ndifferent programs running.\n\n519\n00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:29.950\nI can use Alt + Tab to move\nbetween the applications.\n\n520\n00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:33.830\nI'm holding my Alt key, and\nI'm hitting Tab while I hold Alt.\n\n521\n00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:35.950\nand you'll see I get a preview\nof each application,\n\n522\n00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:38.470\nand I can find the one\nthat I'm looking for.\n\n523\n00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:43.600\nAnd it works for desktop apps as well\nas modern UI apps that are full-screen.\n\n524\n00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.856\nAnd I can flip easily in between\nthem to get at what I want.\n\n525\n00:23:46.856 --> 00:23:48.350\nSo Alt+Tab.\n\n526\n00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:52.335\nThere's also Windows key+tab,\nwhich shows like a 3D representation.\n\n527\n00:23:52.335 --> 00:23:53.553\nI don't know, it's all flash.\n\n528\n00:23:53.553 --> 00:23:58.583\nAlt+tab is the easier one\ncause you get the nice icons.\n\n529\n00:23:58.583 --> 00:24:00.487\nLet me show you my favorite shortcut.\n\n530\n00:24:00.487 --> 00:24:02.080\nI have a problem with\nremembering shortcuts.\n\n531\n00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:06.680\nSo if you can't remember shortcuts and\nyou wanna get somewhere, well,\n\n532\n00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.650\nthe shortcuts don't help you\nif you can't remember them.\n\n533\n00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:10.135\nThere is a nice one for administrators.\n\n534\n00:24:10.135 --> 00:24:13.197\nFor people like you, people who are gonna\nbe supporting desktop computers.\n\n535\n00:24:13.197 --> 00:24:19.265\nIf you hit Windows Key+X, Windows Key+X\nbrings up a neat little menu.\n\n536\n00:24:19.265 --> 00:24:23.838\nAnd this menu is designed for people that\nare administrators, people who are doing\n\n537\n00:24:23.838 --> 00:24:28.945\nsupport, where they put all the common\nsupport tools you need, right here.\n\n538\n00:24:28.945 --> 00:24:33.225\nWe've got things like shut down, access\nto desktop, run a program, search and\n\n539\n00:24:33.225 --> 00:24:34.270\nfind data.\n\n540\n00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:36.050\nYou've got your Control Panel.\n\n541\n00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:38.560\nSuper quick access to the Control Panel,\nright here.\n\n542\n00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:41.720\nYou've got other things,\nlike your Power Options.\n\n543\n00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.837\nI can jump right to the Power Options,\nright here.\n\n544\n00:24:43.837 --> 00:24:48.782\nWindows Key+X gives you this neat\nmenu that is just super useful.\n\n545\n00:24:48.782 --> 00:24:50.970\nSo if you're gonna be out\nthere supporting computers.\n\n546\n00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:51.830\nThat's a good one to remember.\n\n547\n00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:53.440\nWindows Key+X.\n\n548\n00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:56.000\nBut it's not the only one by far.\n\n549\n00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.180\nThere's tons of keyboard shortcuts.\n\n550\n00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:01.160\nLet me show you a couple other popular\nones that you might use to make your\n\n551\n00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.230\ncommutes a little easier.\n\n552\n00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:04.360\nThe charms bar.\n\n553\n00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.560\nSo, it kinda blends together.\n\n554\n00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:07.940\nI don't remember if it was\nearlier this episode or\n\n555\n00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:11.530\nanother episode where I was having a\nproblem getting the charms bar to appear.\n\n556\n00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:15.120\nOn a touch screen,\nyou swipe in from the right.\n\n557\n00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.590\nBut I'm not on a touch screen.\n\n558\n00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:21.400\nSo instead, for me, I move my mouse\nto the right side of the screen, and\n\n559\n00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.190\neventually that charm bar will appear.\n\n560\n00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:24.210\nThere we go.\n\n561\n00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:26.270\nAnd I mess that up nine times out of ten.\n\n562\n00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:30.778\nAnd the reason is you're supposed to send\nyour mouse up kinda to the top right, and\n\n563\n00:25:30.778 --> 00:25:34.170\nthen it appears, but\nit's kinda transparent.\n\n564\n00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:36.890\nAnd then, if you move your\nmouse back it kinda disappears.\n\n565\n00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:39.400\nAnd so it's kinda challenging\nto get that to work.\n\n566\n00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:44.640\nSo an easier way to get your charms\nbar to pop up, is Windows Key+C.\n\n567\n00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:48.004\nWindows Key+C will bring that\ncharms bar right up, you'll see it,\n\n568\n00:25:48.004 --> 00:25:50.560\nit's not transparent,\nit's up, and that's it.\n\n569\n00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:53.870\nSo Windows Key+C, I just remember C for\ncharms, and that'll take you there.\n\n570\n00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.300\nAnd there's other settings, well,\nlet's take a look at that charm bar.\n\n571\n00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:02.450\nSo, for the charms bar, most of the time\nwhen I go to it, I'm going to Settings.\n\n572\n00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:05.350\nI never use some of these\nother ones like Start.\n\n573\n00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:06.780\nWell, I've gotta Windows key for that.\n\n574\n00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:07.370\nThat's what I use.\n\n575\n00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:10.740\nBut if you're on a touch screen tablet,\nyou might not have it, you'd use it a lot.\n\n576\n00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.120\nOr Search.\n\n577\n00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:15.110\nIf I'm on a touch screen,\nI need that Search button to bring up\n\n578\n00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:18.260\nthe search field, so I can start\ntyping with my on screen keyboard.\n\n579\n00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:21.020\nBut if you had a keyboard,\nyou can just start typing right here,\n\n580\n00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:25.070\nyou don't have to press anything,\nand it automatically does search.\n\n581\n00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:28.160\nSo, some of the charms bar\nitems are useful, some aren't.\n\n582\n00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:31.240\nAnd nine times out of ten, when I go\nto the charms bar, I'm looking for\n\n583\n00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.380\nthis bottom option down here.\n\n584\n00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:33.420\nI'm looking for Settings.\n\n585\n00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:34.900\nThis guy.\n\n586\n00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:38.610\nAnd when I go to Settings, that's what's\ntaking me where I really wanna go.\n\n587\n00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:43.330\nWell, I can do Windows Key+I and\njump right to that same screen.\n\n588\n00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:44.740\nSkip the charms bar completely.\n\n589\n00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.690\nWindows Key+I will take you right here.\n\n590\n00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:48.420\nAnd now I can get to those\nsettings that I was looking for.\n\n591\n00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:49.600\nSo that's in another shortcut for us.\n\n592\n00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:55.550\nThe other thing to remember is just\nas far as shortcuts are concerned,\n\n593\n00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:58.358\nremember to customize your Start menu.\n\n594\n00:26:58.358 --> 00:27:04.310\nThis Start menu in its default form is\nnot really geared towards what you do.\n\n595\n00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:05.930\nYou understand what you do.\n\n596\n00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:08.610\nSo, if you have programs that\nyou use every single day,\n\n597\n00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:12.790\nif I know I'm gonna go to desktop mode\nevery single day rearrange this thing.\n\n598\n00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:16.090\nTake the Desktop mode and\nput it right there at the top left and\n\n599\n00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:19.260\nI'm gonna resize it and make it bigger,\nI'm gonna get large, pow.\n\n600\n00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:22.010\nThere's this giant button, this is\nthe Desktop, so now I can quickly and\n\n601\n00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:22.990\neasily get to it.\n\n602\n00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:26.791\nAnd if I'm running Wireshark every\nsingle day, I can take Wireshark and\n\n603\n00:27:26.791 --> 00:27:28.485\nmove it up here and get it set up.\n\n604\n00:27:28.485 --> 00:27:32.289\nAnd you can even create little groups\nto divide up your applications,\n\n605\n00:27:32.289 --> 00:27:36.736\nthere's a way down in the bottom right\ncorner of my screen, it's hard to see, but\n\n606\n00:27:36.736 --> 00:27:38.935\nthere's a little minus sign down here.\n\n607\n00:27:38.935 --> 00:27:42.702\nAnd if you hit that minus sign it\nzooms out and what it's doing is,\n\n608\n00:27:42.702 --> 00:27:48.240\nit's allowing you to take applications and\ntheir groups and kind of move them around.\n\n609\n00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.980\nAnd so you can kinda change the order that\nstuff is in and group them together so\n\n610\n00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.980\nthat like applications are together.\n\n611\n00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:56.930\nMaybe I have a bunch of network utilities.\n\n612\n00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:59.160\nI want all the network\nutilities in their own group.\n\n613\n00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.610\nAnd so I might drag Wireshark,\n\n614\n00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:02.960\nI'm just gonna keep dragging it all\nthe way over here to the right.\n\n615\n00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.260\nAnd see that white bar that just appeared?\n\n616\n00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:08.000\nThat means that when I drop it,\nit's now in its own group.\n\n617\n00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.208\nIt's got a separate group\nfrom everybody else.\n\n618\n00:28:10.208 --> 00:28:17.349\nAnd if I hit that minus button again and\nzoom out I can right-click on that group.\n\n619\n00:28:17.349 --> 00:28:18.301\nOops.\n\n620\n00:28:18.301 --> 00:28:20.403\nOh, actually you know it's\nnot right-click is it?\n\n621\n00:28:20.403 --> 00:28:24.499\nWe can hold our finger on a touch screen\nis what does it, and it will allow us to\n\n622\n00:28:24.499 --> 00:28:28.230\nrename that group and change its name,\nwhich is kind of a nice thing.\n\n623\n00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.140\nWithout a touchscreen we\ndo it from the main here.\n\n624\n00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:34.600\nSo if I just right-click above the group,\nI've got name groups and\n\n625\n00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:35.690\nthere I get that option.\n\n626\n00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:39.050\nAnd so I'll just say Network Utilities.\n\n627\n00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:41.370\nSo I can remember these are gonna\nbe my Network Utilities.\n\n628\n00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:43.142\nAnd that didn't really fit, did it?\n\n629\n00:28:43.142 --> 00:28:45.302\nSo I'll just call it Net Tools then.\n\n630\n00:28:45.302 --> 00:28:45.882\nThat'll fit.\n\n631\n00:28:45.882 --> 00:28:46.485\nThere.\n\n632\n00:28:46.485 --> 00:28:49.090\nDepending on your resolution, you may\nbe able to get more or less letters.\n\n633\n00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:51.970\nMy resolution is pretty low right now,\nso Net Tools.\n\n634\n00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:54.600\nAnd you can name each of the groups,\nhowever you want them to be named so\n\n635\n00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.129\nyou can remember that.\n\n636\n00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:00.130\nAnd then once it's done now when I\nsee that group it's got that name.\n\n637\n00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:04.320\nAnd I can move the group so\nthat it's in-between these guys.\n\n638\n00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.160\nThere we go.\n\n639\n00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.460\nAnd so now I've got kinda my\ndefault Microsofty stuff and\n\n640\n00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:10.150\nthen I got my Net Tools there,\nI might have other things.\n\n641\n00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:11.540\nI might never use One Note.\n\n642\n00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:13.840\nSo I might unpin that,\nget rid of it, again,\n\n643\n00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:16.470\njust kind of customizing this,\nmaking it work for me.\n\n644\n00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:22.520\nOne thing I like to do is whatever\napplication I use the most, put it first.\n\n645\n00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:29.100\nBecause what happens is when you press\nthe Windows key, whatever application\n\n646\n00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:33.350\nis first is selected by default, so\nit's kind of a keyboard shortcut I use is.\n\n647\n00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:37.450\nTo run my most common application I\ncan hit Windows key and then Enter.\n\n648\n00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:40.771\nWindows Key+Enter will just run the first\napplication that is in your Start menu.\n\n649\n00:29:40.771 --> 00:29:43.952\nSo, for me it took me to the Desktop,\nbut if I move Wireshark there.\n\n650\n00:29:43.952 --> 00:29:46.089\nSo make a Wireshark first.\n\n651\n00:29:46.089 --> 00:29:51.530\nNow, I can hit Windows Key+Enter,\nand it's gonna launch Wireshark.\n\n652\n00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:53.680\nSo that's gonna fire up,\nand then we'll have it.\n\n653\n00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.940\nSo think about how you use the computer\nand customize it to match.\n\n654\n00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:58.040\nThat's pretty important.\n\n655\n00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.230\n>> Awesome stuff, Don.\n\n656\n00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:00.650\nVery cool demonstration, here.\n\n657\n00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:03.520\nWell, you are starting to see\nhow customizing your desktop.\n\n658\n00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:07.540\nCustomizing the way that the operating\nsystem will work, can be very beneficial.\n\n659\n00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:08.782\nI love that Alt+Tab key.\n\n660\n00:30:08.782 --> 00:30:12.788\nWhen I found out that I could do that,\nand switch between the.\n\n661\n00:30:12.788 --> 00:30:14.537\nI was trying to get that high\nscore on Minesweeper and\n\n662\n00:30:14.537 --> 00:30:17.035\nnow I'm at the spreadsheet that\nI was supposed to be working on.\n\n663\n00:30:17.035 --> 00:30:18.065\nIt was an amazing thing.\n\n664\n00:30:18.065 --> 00:30:20.955\nNot that we're trying to teach\nyou how to not be productive.\n\n665\n00:30:20.955 --> 00:30:22.735\nDon't get us wrong,\nthat's not what we're here to do.\n\n666\n00:30:22.735 --> 00:30:25.920\nHopefully, we're trying to teach you how\nto use these Windows operating systems.\n\n667\n00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.450\nA little bit more efficiently.\n\n668\n00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:30.060\nThat being said Don,\nI think we've had a pretty good show here.\n\n669\n00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:31.200\nDid we miss anything?\n\n670\n00:30:31.200

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.980\nI'll be your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n4\n00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.520\nHere with me is none other than Mr.\nDon Pezet himself.\n\n5\n00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.450\nHow's it going today Don?\n\n6\n00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.340\n>> It is going great Daniel.\n\n7\n00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.120\nExcited to be back on this show, and\nwe're going to be wrapping up our\n\n8\n00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.640\ndevice configuration section\nthat we've been working on.\n\n9\n00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.690\nIn this episode, we're going to be\ntaking a look at Windows updates.\n\n10\n00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.290\nAnd really a couple of different\ntypes of updates beyond that.\n\n11\n00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.000\nBut, a real important topic,\n\n12\n00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.360\nespecially with some of the things that\nare going on in the news these days.\n\n13\n00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.000\nKeeping your system up to date\nis just insanely important.\n\n14\n00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.970\nI mean,\nyou can't overstate it enough, right?\n\n15\n00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.760\nWhen you install Windows, it's fine.\n\n16\n00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.410\nBut really, it doesn't take long for\n\n17\n00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.430\nexploits to be detected\nout on the internet,\n\n18\n00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.228\nhackers start taking advantage of it,\nand your system can get compromised.\n\n19\n00:00:54.228 --> 00:00:56.604\nSo we've gotta make sure we\nkeep our system up to date, and\n\n20\n00:00:56.604 --> 00:00:58.314\nthat's what we're gonna look at today.\n\n21\n00:00:58.314 --> 00:01:02.224\nNow, for an average home user, ideally\nwhat we want to do is set up our machine\n\n22\n00:01:02.224 --> 00:01:05.910\nto automatically do Windows updates so\nwe don't have to worry about it.\n\n23\n00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.330\nIt's a thing of the past, right.\n\n24\n00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.330\nYou just let it run and it does its thing.\n\n25\n00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.010\nFor a business user,\n\n26\n00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.890\nwe need to make sure that our Windows\nupdates are running reliably.\n\n27\n00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.650\nWe need to know that our\nmachines are updated.\n\n28\n00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.050\nIf you're the help desk technician for\na company with 1,000 computers,\n\n29\n00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.635\nyou want to make sure that all 1,000\ncomputers are getting patched, right,\n\n30\n00:01:21.635 --> 00:01:23.019\nthat they're getting updated.\n\n31\n00:01:23.019 --> 00:01:25.640\nOn a desktop, if you're a home user,\nit's just your one machine,\n\n32\n00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.990\nit's far easier, right.\n\n33\n00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.000\nSo there's different levels of difficulty,\nI guess, for getting this configured.\n\n34\n00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.130\nFor most home users though, Windows Update\nis automatically configured.\n\n35\n00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.930\nNow let's back up a little bit here.\n\n36\n00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.860\nWhen I say, when Windows Update\nis automatically configured,\n\n37\n00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:40.520\nwhat do I mean, right?\n\n38\n00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.190\nWhat does that mean is happening?\n\n39\n00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:49.011\nWell by default, every day at 3 AM your\ncomputer is set to reach out to Microsoft.\n\n40\n00:01:49.011 --> 00:01:51.538\nAnd it reaches out to Microsoft and\nsays hey Microsoft,\n\n41\n00:01:51.538 --> 00:01:53.670\nhave there been any changes to Windows?\n\n42\n00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.300\nHave you released any updates\nto the Windows operating system?\n\n43\n00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.500\nAnd Microsoft will either respond back and\nsay yeah, here's some updates or\n\n44\n00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.430\nnope, everything's fine,\nyou're up to date, and that's it, right.\n\n45\n00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.000\nAnd so\nit'll pull updates if they're available.\n\n46\n00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.520\nNow, what do I mean when I say updates?\n\n47\n00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.350\nWell there's a lot of different reasons\nwhy Microsoft can release updates.\n\n48\n00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.988\nAnd you'll hear different words\nlike hot fixes, patches, updates,\n\n49\n00:02:14.988 --> 00:02:17.241\nroll up packs, all these different words.\n\n50\n00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:22.320\nBut at the end of the day, what they mean\nis that something is wrong in Windows.\n\n51\n00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.740\nSomething is broken.\n\n52\n00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.540\nAnd you might never have noticed it.\n\n53\n00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.080\nYou might not have seen it a single time.\n\n54\n00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.510\nIt might not affect your normal\nuse of Windows, but it is broken.\n\n55\n00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.000\nAnd Microsoft fixes it, and\nthey push just a change to the software.\n\n56\n00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.450\nUsually it's one or\ntwo files that have to get replaced\n\n57\n00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.080\nthat update Windows to perform\nthat new function better.\n\n58\n00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.530\nSometimes it's something\nreally big though.\n\n59\n00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.550\nIt can be something like a new\nversion of Internet Explorer.\n\n60\n00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.760\nYou might be running Internet Explorer 10.\n\n61\n00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.922\nAnd Internet Explorer 11 comes out,\nand so they push that as an update.\n\n62\n00:02:52.922 --> 00:02:55.320\nAnd so one day,\nyou fire on your computer and\n\n63\n00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.750\nall of a sudden you got a new\nversion of Internet Explorer.\n\n64\n00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.580\nNow, why do we do these updates, right?\n\n65\n00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.680\nDaniel, you know.\n\n66\n00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.010\nI mean, how prevalent\nare Internet attacks these days?\n\n67\n00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.620\n>> Oh man,\nthe Internet is the Wild Wild West.\n\n68\n00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.010\nThat is no joke.\n\n69\n00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.920\nThese updates are that important is that\neven Microsoft has a schedule where they\n\n70\n00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.726\nmake sure that they go through at least\nonce a month, test all their software and\n\n71\n00:03:15.726 --> 00:03:18.900\nmake sure that if anything is wrong,\nthey fix it and they push that out.\n\n72\n00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.390\nThey call it Patch Tuesday.\n\n73\n00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.920\nSo anybody that's a system administrator,\nthey know that term and\n\n74\n00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.960\nthey recognize it right off the bat.\n\n75\n00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.200\nBut they're basically what\nDon was talking about.\n\n76\n00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.530\nBecause the Internet is so full of bad\nguys out there trying to do things like\n\n77\n00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.300\nsteal your identity, or just straight\nup break into your computer and\n\n78\n00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.460\nsteal data off of that, or\nuse it for crimes itself.\n\n79\n00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.340\nYour computer could be used as\na weapon in an Internet type crime.\n\n80\n00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.960\nYou don't wanna allow that to happen,\nright?\n\n81\n00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.710\nWe don't want to proliferate\nmore Internet crime.\n\n82\n00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.420\nWe have enough of it as it is.\n\n83\n00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.420\nSo that's why we're glad\nthat Microsoft does this,\n\n84\n00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.120\nthey push out these updates, make sure\nto fix all those little security holes.\n\n85\n00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.100\nAlso, they add nice new features.\n\n86\n00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.920\nLike Don said, new version of\nInternet explorer comes out it's got\n\n87\n00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.540\ncool new features and\nstuff that you might want to use.\n\n88\n00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.312\nYou'll get that as well, but mainly we're\nreally focusing in on that security\n\n89\n00:04:06.312 --> 00:04:09.037\nbecause of how dangerous it\nis out there on the Internet.\n\n90\n00:04:09.037 --> 00:04:12.450\n>> Yeah, and just remember, there might be\na feature that's broken in Windows, but\n\n91\n00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.870\nyou don't use the feature.\n\n92\n00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.510\nSo what do you care, right?\n\n93\n00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.790\nWell you might not care,\nbut the attacker might.\n\n94\n00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.650\nAnd a hacker out there on the Internet\nmight know about that broken feature and\n\n95\n00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.120\nknow how they can take advantage of\nit to take control of your computer.\n\n96\n00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.290\nAnd then all of a sudden, your\ncomputer starts relaying spam email or\n\n97\n00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.110\nsomething like that, and\nthat's what the attackers are doing.\n\n98\n00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.159\nSo just because it doesn't affect you\ndoesn't mean you shouldn't patch.\n\n99\n00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:35.100\nIt's really really important.\n\n100\n00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.890\nWhen you receive spam email,\n\n101\n00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.730\nspam email rarely comes from a dedicated\nspam email server somewhere.\n\n102\n00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.690\nNormally, it's an attacker\nwho's taken control of\n\n103\n00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.090\nthousands of machines on the Internet and\nis relaying their email through them\n\n104\n00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.400\nunbeknownst to the people\nthat own those machines.\n\n105\n00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.350\nSo you might have some kind old lady\nwho just now learning computers,\n\n106\n00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.050\ndoesn't really know,\nnot doing updates, and is relaying\n\n107\n00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.080\nmillions of spam emails a day, doesn't\neven know that it's happening, right.\n\n108\n00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.180\nThat's the kind of horror\nstory that's out there.\n\n109\n00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.750\nSo all we have to do is make sure we\nkeep the system up to date, right.\n\n110\n00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.700\nThe easiest way to do that\nis through Windows updates.\n\n111\n00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.581\nI mentioned that it's set by default,\n\n112\n00:05:13.581 --> 00:05:16.608\nyour computer is gonna check in\nat 3 AM every morning, right.\n\n113\n00:05:16.608 --> 00:05:18.660\n3 AM in your local time zone.\n\n114\n00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.550\nSo whatever time zone you're in,\nit's 3 AM for\n\n115\n00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.910\nyou that you're gonna reach out and check.\n\n116\n00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.780\nNow, that's great for desktops that\nwe might leave on all of the time.\n\n117\n00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.440\nIt's not so great for laptops that we\nusually shut off at night, right, so\n\n118\n00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.080\nthey're not running at 3 AM.\n\n119\n00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.280\nSo we might want to adjust that check\nin time to be something a little\n\n120\n00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.010\nmore friendly with our schedule.\n\n121\n00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.520\nOr if it misses a check in, it just\ndoes it the next computer boots up,\n\n122\n00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.440\nso it'll check.\n\n123\n00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.785\nBut that can get a little\nfrustrating too sometimes,\n\n124\n00:05:44.785 --> 00:05:45.910\ncuz you're in a hurry to do things.\n\n125\n00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.160\nSo, these are settings we\nmight want to customize, so\n\n126\n00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.032\nlet me show you how to do that.\n\n127\n00:05:49.032 --> 00:05:51.893\nAll right, so\nI'm gonna jump into my charms bar, and\n\n128\n00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:54.323\nI'm gonna go right down\nhere into Settings.\n\n129\n00:05:54.323 --> 00:05:58.212\nAnd inside of the ,Settings I'm gonna\ngo all the way down here to the bottom\n\n130\n00:05:58.212 --> 00:05:59.446\nto change PC settings,\n\n131\n00:05:59.446 --> 00:06:03.380\nright, that hidden away little item\nto jump into our PC settings, right.\n\n132\n00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.045\nSo what you're gonna see is this\nscreen right here, PC settings.\n\n133\n00:06:06.045 --> 00:06:09.645\nNow, when I went to this screen first,\nit wasn't there, right, it was in PC and\n\n134\n00:06:09.645 --> 00:06:10.485\ndevices.\n\n135\n00:06:10.485 --> 00:06:13.745\nAnd that's because this screen\nremembers what you left off on, right,\n\n136\n00:06:13.745 --> 00:06:15.225\nwhere you were before.\n\n137\n00:06:15.225 --> 00:06:18.875\nSo when you come to it, you might be\ninside one of these sub-items, and\n\n138\n00:06:18.875 --> 00:06:20.805\nyou'll know it if you have\nthis back arrow like I did.\n\n139\n00:06:20.805 --> 00:06:23.545\nSo I can just hit back, and\nget right to my PC settings.\n\n140\n00:06:23.545 --> 00:06:27.355\nIf I had left it at PC settings,\nwhen I came back here, right, so\n\n141\n00:06:27.355 --> 00:06:32.020\nif I do the Charms Bar > Settings,\ngo up to, or\n\n142\n00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.060\ndown to change PC settings, and see how\nit took me to PC settings this time?\n\n143\n00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.985\nSo it's all about where\nyou left it off at right.\n\n144\n00:06:38.985 --> 00:06:42.310\nBut once you're in here, down here\nat the bottom, we've got update and\n\n145\n00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.570\nrecovery, all right.\n\n146\n00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.360\nAnd that's where we go to\nadjust Windows update, and\n\n147\n00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.030\nyou'll see my PC is not\nconfigured to get updates.\n\n148\n00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.610\nNow, after I just told you guys\nhow important Windows updates are,\n\n149\n00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.080\nwhy am I not doing updates?\n\n150\n00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.740\nKind of hypocritical of me, isn't it?\n\n151\n00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:57.370\n>> Good job, Don.\n\n152\n00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:57.925\n>> Yeah, I know.\n\n153\n00:06:57.925 --> 00:07:00.090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well the reason I have updates turned\n\n154\n00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:04.370\noff is because of the show\n>> If you aren't doing your updates,\n\n155\n00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.180\nit gives you pop up messages,\nyou get little warning bubbles,\n\n156\n00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.410\nyou get all sorts of stuff letting you\nknow, hey you need to do the updates.\n\n157\n00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:12.994\nAnd I don't normally want those\npopping up during the show, so\n\n158\n00:07:12.994 --> 00:07:14.760\nI've turned off the updates, all right.\n\n159\n00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.709\nThat doesn't mean you're\nnot doing updates,\n\n160\n00:07:16.709 --> 00:07:19.260\nit means you're not doing\nautomatic updates, right?\n\n161\n00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.490\nSo I'm not getting those.\n\n162\n00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.860\nI could still be applying\nthe updates myself.\n\n163\n00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.840\nBut I'm not doing them automatically.\n\n164\n00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.930\nIdeally, we want it to be automatic.\n\n165\n00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.840\nAnd so you can just hit turn\non recommended settings.\n\n166\n00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.500\nAnd that's gonna set it the way\nthat Microsoft wants it set, okay.\n\n167\n00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.090\nAnd the way that Microsoft wants it set is\nthat you are going to check in every day\n\n168\n00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.600\nat 3 AM and do the updates.\n\n169\n00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.395\nIt's reaching out right now and checking\nfor updates because I just turned it on,\n\n170\n00:07:42.395 --> 00:07:42.951\nall right.\n\n171\n00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:46.981\nIf you already had it turned on, what\nyou'll see here is a screen that lets you\n\n172\n00:07:46.981 --> 00:07:51.461\nknow whether you're up to date, or whether\nyou've got updates waiting to install.\n\n173\n00:07:51.461 --> 00:07:53.497\nOkay, so, mine's gonna update\nhere in just a second, and\n\n174\n00:07:53.497 --> 00:07:54.943\nit'll show updates waiting to install.\n\n175\n00:07:54.943 --> 00:07:57.682\nNow For this machine,\nit's probably got a lot of updates, so\n\n176\n00:07:57.682 --> 00:08:00.470\nwe'll probably have to wait a bit for\nthat to happen.\n\n177\n00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:04.550\nWhile we're waiting on it, let's go down\nhere to choose how updates get installed.\n\n178\n00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:08.404\nThis is important because we've got\nsome choices as to what happens.\n\n179\n00:08:08.404 --> 00:08:12.270\nSo, every day it's gonna check in for\nnew updates.\n\n180\n00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:15.460\nAnd if it finds them, what happens next?\n\n181\n00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:16.710\nWell, that's what this option defines.\n\n182\n00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:21.914\nMicrosoft categorizes their\nupdates into three categories.\n\n183\n00:08:21.914 --> 00:08:23.090\nThat was redundant.\n\n184\n00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:26.450\nBut [LAUGH] anyhow, so\nyou have important updates,\n\n185\n00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:30.920\nyou have recommended updates,\nand you have Microsoft update.\n\n186\n00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.440\nWell, the first one is important updates.\n\n187\n00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.000\nThe user wants to fix security flaws.\n\n188\n00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.360\nThe user wants to fix critical\nflaws in Windows that Microsoft\n\n189\n00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.090\nreally thinks is important for\nyou to apply.\n\n190\n00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.770\nAt a minimum, you want these.\n\n191\n00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.060\nThese are the ones that\nare gonna keep you safe.\n\n192\n00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.978\nBut sometimes Microsoft\nrolls out a new feature.\n\n193\n00:08:48.978 --> 00:08:51.278\nHere's a great new shiny\nversion of Internet Explorer.\n\n194\n00:08:51.278 --> 00:08:52.577\nDo you need it?\n\n195\n00:08:52.577 --> 00:08:54.202\nNot necessarily.\n\n196\n00:08:54.202 --> 00:08:57.150\nSo, that's a recommended update.\n\n197\n00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.390\nThey recommend you go to the newest\nbrowser, but you don't have to.\n\n198\n00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:00.690\nYou can stay with the old one.\n\n199\n00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:01.730\nAnd so, we can choose.\n\n200\n00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.330\nDo we want those recommended updates or\nnot?\n\n201\n00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.270\nIf we don't want them,\nwe can turn them off and\n\n202\n00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.240\nnow, we just have to manually choose\nto install those when we want them.\n\n203\n00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.390\nBut it will still see they're available,\nbut we'll have to tell it to install it.\n\n204\n00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:15.172\nNow we can choose when we wanna\nmove forward with those things.\n\n205\n00:09:15.172 --> 00:09:16.460\nAnd then Microsoft update.\n\n206\n00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:21.560\nBy default, Windows update only\nupdates Microsoft Windows.\n\n207\n00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.420\nThat's why it's called Windows update.\n\n208\n00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:27.560\nMicrosoft update updates\nall Microsoft products.\n\n209\n00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.130\nSo not just Windows, but\nMicrosoft Office, like Word, Excel,\n\n210\n00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:35.180\nPowerPoint, OneNote, it even does like\nserver applications for the server guys.\n\n211\n00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.040\nIt updates really anything from Microsoft,\nand so\n\n212\n00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.790\nwe can choose to receive\nthose the same way.\n\n213\n00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:42.590\nIt's a great way to make sure that\nour applications stay updated.\n\n214\n00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.060\nThat's an area a lot of\npeople forget about.\n\n215\n00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.770\nThey don't update their applications,\nand you end up with a vulnerable system.\n\n216\n00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:50.600\nYour operating system is protected,\nbut your applications aren't.\n\n217\n00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.990\nSo we gotta keep those up to date too.\n\n218\n00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.990\nOn the important updates,\nyou've got a few choices here.\n\n219\n00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:57.970\nNever check.\n\n220\n00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:58.540\nI don't want them.\n\n221\n00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:59.770\nJust don't do it.\nDon't do updates.\n\n222\n00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:01.110\nThat's what I'm set to right now.\n\n223\n00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.710\nOr what I was a second ago.\n\n224\n00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:06.200\nYou can also say,\nInstall updates automatically.\n\n225\n00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.890\nThat's the recommended setting.\n\n226\n00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:10.900\nAnd what that means is, your system\nis gonna be sitting there at 3 AM.\n\n227\n00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:11.630\nIt's gonna check in.\n\n228\n00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:12.620\nIt's gonna get those updates.\n\n229\n00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.450\nAnd it's gonna go ahead and install them.\n\n230\n00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:15.300\nLet's just install it.\n\n231\n00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:16.140\nIt's 3 AM.\n\n232\n00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:16.920\nNobody's using the computer.\n\n233\n00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.149\nLet's just do it.\n\n234\n00:10:19.149 --> 00:10:24.380\nBut, what if I'm guilty of like\nleaving my applications running and\n\n235\n00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:25.740\nnot saving my data?\n\n236\n00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.990\nWell, it's gonna install these updates and\nit's gonna reboot my computer.\n\n237\n00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:29.320\nI don't want it to reboot.\n\n238\n00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.160\nSo if I wanna control\nwhen the reboot happens,\n\n239\n00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:38.578\nthen you can choose download updates, but\nlet me choose whether to install them.\n\n240\n00:10:38.578 --> 00:10:40.058\nNow at 3 AM, it will download the updates,\n\n241\n00:10:40.058 --> 00:10:41.701\nthey're sitting right\nthere on your computer.\n\n242\n00:10:41.701 --> 00:10:44.725\nAnd it's up to you to pick\nwhen you want to install them.\n\n243\n00:10:44.725 --> 00:10:47.659\nAnd the most common way is when you go to\nshut down, it'll add the option to shut\n\n244\n00:10:47.659 --> 00:10:49.810\ndown and install updates, and\nso it can do it right then.\n\n245\n00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:53.763\nSo you control when those\nupdates are getting installed.\n\n246\n00:10:53.763 --> 00:10:56.292\nAnd then you've got check for updates, but\n\n247\n00:10:56.292 --> 00:10:59.790\nlet me choose whether to even\ndownload them or install them.\n\n248\n00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:02.988\nSo now it's not even gonna download it,\nit's just gonna know that they're in\n\n249\n00:11:02.988 --> 00:11:06.040\nexistence, and that you need to do them,\nand that's all we get.\n\n250\n00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.980\nNow why do we do that?\n\n251\n00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:11.690\nMaybe you're on a cellular modem card, and\nyou don't wanna burn up your data plan.\n\n252\n00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:14.850\nSo you want it to tell you the updates\nare available, but not download them yet.\n\n253\n00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:17.390\nYou'll deal with that when you're\non a more reliable network.\n\n254\n00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:18.510\nSo you can specify that.\n\n255\n00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.440\nThere's other ways to control\nthat on cellular cards, but\n\n256\n00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.100\nthis will be one of them.\n\n257\n00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.260\nBut that automatic,\nthat's the one that we really want.\n\n258\n00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.225\nThat's the one that's usually\ngonna take care of us.\n\n259\n00:11:26.225 --> 00:11:29.700\nAnd we can go ahead and apply that and\nthose are now my settings.\n\n260\n00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.250\nSo mine's still checking for updates.\n\n261\n00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:34.730\nIf you haven't patched your system in a\nwhile, like if you do a brand new install\n\n262\n00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:39.150\nof Windows 7, there's something like 120\nupdates that you have to go through to get\n\n263\n00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:43.050\nit done, this Windows 8 machine probably\nhas a good 60 or 70 that it'll have to do.\n\n264\n00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:46.790\nAnd it'll punch through and,\noh is my system up to date?\n\n265\n00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.520\nHow is that even possible?\n\n266\n00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.960\nApparently, I've done a good job\nkeeping my system up to date.\n\n267\n00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.270\nSo it's telling me it found no\nnew updates today, it's okay,\n\n268\n00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:55.660\nthere's nothing new and that's that.\n\n269\n00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.990\nAnd if I go to View Details, I can see any\nupdates that have already been installed.\n\n270\n00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.320\nAnd so it's gonna lay those out.\n\n271\n00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.040\nOr if it found updates,\nit'll give me details there.\n\n272\n00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.860\nBut here I'm seeing all the updates that\nare already installed and, sure enough,\n\n273\n00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.610\nI'm pretty well patched.\n\n274\n00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:08.860\nThere's a lot of updates here.\n\n275\n00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:12.170\nWay down here at the bottom,\nI have some optional ones, though.\n\n276\n00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:14.570\nThese are ones that they're\nnot even recommended.\n\n277\n00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:18.005\nThey're just optional I can get\nthem if I want, like Skype for\n\n278\n00:12:18.005 --> 00:12:20.665\nWindows which is blocked out for\nsome reason.\n\n279\n00:12:20.665 --> 00:12:22.955\nAnd Silverlight,\nI can choose to install that if I want.\n\n280\n00:12:22.955 --> 00:12:27.955\nBut all of these other updates\ninstalled on their own, so I'm up and\n\n281\n00:12:27.955 --> 00:12:29.440\ngoing, and we're in business.\n\n282\n00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.930\nSo, that's kinda how this works for\nour basic Windows updates.\n\n283\n00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:36.190\nBut that's not the only type of\nupdate that we need to be aware of.\n\n284\n00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:39.580\nThere are some other ones\nlike hardware updates.\n\n285\n00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.540\nYou might have device drivers for\nyour system.\n\n286\n00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:46.965\nWhen you take a laptop like mine, it's got\na display adapter that renders the screen,\n\n287\n00:12:46.965 --> 00:12:51.465\nits got a sound card that renders\nthe audio, its got keyboard touchpad,\n\n288\n00:12:51.465 --> 00:12:53.650\nits got all these different\nhardware components.\n\n289\n00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:55.940\nAnd those hardware components\nare kind of important, for\n\n290\n00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.360\nus to interact with the computer.\n\n291\n00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.090\nThey have drivers, and\nthe drivers get updates.\n\n292\n00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:04.810\nSo sometimes those hardware vendors\npartner with Microsoft, and\n\n293\n00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:06.800\nyou can get those updates\nthrough Microsoft.\n\n294\n00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.060\nAnd so you might see an update for\nyour network card, but\n\n295\n00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.620\na lot of vendors don't do that.\n\n296\n00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.640\nSo don't forget to update\nyour hardware drivers.\n\n297\n00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.890\nYou might need to go to Dell, or HP, or\n\n298\n00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:17.980\nwhoever does you bought your\nlaptop through, Lenovo, whoever.\n\n299\n00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.950\nAnd they'll have updates for\nyou to download and install, there, too,\n\n300\n00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:21.870\non the driver side.\n\n301\n00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.160\nSo those are some of the other\nupdates that are available.\n\n302\n00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.130\nBut sometimes they do come through\nWindows update, and you do have it there.\n\n303\n00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.860\nThe other thing worth mentioning,\n\n304\n00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:35.230\nis there's another type\nof update in Windows 8.\n\n305\n00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:36.950\nSo it's new one that was introduced.\n\n306\n00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:40.670\nThis Windows update that I just showed you\nguys, that's been in Windows for awhile.\n\n307\n00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:42.530\nYou remember, Daniel,\nwhen was that first introduce?\n\n308\n00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.455\n>> I wanna say XP.\n\n309\n00:13:44.455 --> 00:13:51.264\n>> [CROSSTALK] So\nthat feature's been around a long time,\n\n310\n00:13:51.264 --> 00:13:56.303\nbut what about these new modern UI apps?\n\n311\n00:13:56.303 --> 00:14:00.150\n>> Our modern UI apps, these apps\nthat are part of our start screen.\n\n312\n00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:03.240\nThese guys are a little bit different,\nthey're not like normal programs.\n\n313\n00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.310\nBecause normally,\nwe get them from the Microsoft store.\n\n314\n00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:08.300\nI'm not going to a website downloading and\ninstalling them,\n\n315\n00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:12.930\nI'm going to the Microsoft store and\ninstalling them, and where is my icon for\n\n316\n00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:13.820\nthe Microsoft store?\n\n317\n00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:17.580\nHave I, oh, actually I think it's\nthis big advertisement, right here.\n\n318\n00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.480\nSo here's the Microsoft store, for me.\n\n319\n00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.060\nAnd if I jump into the Microsoft store,\nI can go and browse for apps, and\n\n320\n00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.640\nfind them and download them.\n\n321\n00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.760\nWell, the cool thing\nabout the Windows store,\n\n322\n00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.890\nis that it can update your apps for you.\n\n323\n00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:32.930\nSo, if you download your app here from the\nstore, and a new version of it comes out.\n\n324\n00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:34.810\nThe store can download the update.\n\n325\n00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:37.210\nI install third party software myself,\nright, so\n\n326\n00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.480\nlike on this machine I installed\na program called Wireshark.\n\n327\n00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.171\nWireshark, I went to their website,\nwireshark.org, I download it and\n\n328\n00:14:43.171 --> 00:14:44.350\nI installed it.\n\n329\n00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:47.420\nIf a new version comes out,\nI don't know about it.\n\n330\n00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:50.790\nSo I have to go and find out about\nthe update, and install it myself.\n\n331\n00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:54.000\nOr if I run the program, I think it does\nits own little check, and it'll tell me\n\n332\n00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.090\nthere's a new version, but that doesn't\nhappen until I run the program.\n\n333\n00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:00.917\nSo I might be months out-of-date just\nbecause I haven't run the program, and\n\n334\n00:15:00.917 --> 00:15:01.560\nI don't know it.\n\n335\n00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:06.710\nBut with the Windows store,\nit's actually checking your app status for\n\n336\n00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:10.920\nyou in the background, and so\nit can do updates here too.\n\n337\n00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:13.010\nAnd the way to see that If\nyou're on a touch screen,\n\n338\n00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:15.160\nyou can swipe down from the top.\n\n339\n00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.920\nBut on a regular desktop,\nif you just right-click up here\n\n340\n00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.580\ntowards the top of the screen,\nyou'll get the pop-down.\n\n341\n00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:22.990\nSo, this is what you'd see\nif you swipe down also.\n\n342\n00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:27.210\nAnd in here, it's designed so\nyou can kind of browse and find apps, but\n\n343\n00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:29.230\nyou've also got the Your apps button.\n\n344\n00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:33.220\nAnd when you choose that, it will show\nthe apps that you've installed from\n\n345\n00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.940\nthe Windows store, and\nyou can see I haven't installed any.\n\n346\n00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:36.990\nI'm not signed in.\n\n347\n00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.220\nBut you'll see the apps\nthat you've installed, and\n\n348\n00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:42.430\nif there's an update available\nyou can click Update.\n\n349\n00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:44.840\nAnd it knocks out and\njust gets it done and taken care of and\n\n350\n00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.940\nit'll do that on its own\nin the background too.\n\n351\n00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:51.160\nSo it's a different type of update that\nhappens for these apps right here.\n\n352\n00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:55.603\nThese ones that are kind of built into\nthe system that are right here and\n\n353\n00:15:55.603 --> 00:15:57.951\nget updates pretty routinely also.\n\n354\n00:15:57.951 --> 00:16:01.318\nOne last thing,\nI wanna mention on Windows updates.\n\n355\n00:16:01.318 --> 00:16:04.702\nIf you're in a business environment,\nand so you've got\n\n356\n00:16:04.702 --> 00:16:09.357\nsystem administrators that are managing\nhundred of thousands of computers,\n\n357\n00:16:09.357 --> 00:16:14.730\nthere's actually another product out there\ncalled the Windows Server Update Service.\n\n358\n00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:18.160\nWSUS is what it is.\n\n359\n00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.990\nAnd it allows a company to set up\ntheir own Microsoft Update server.\n\n360\n00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:27.610\nSo when I went into Windows Updates here,\nwhen I went into my settings and\n\n361\n00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:31.660\ndug down into my PC Settings and\nwent into Update, went in here.\n\n362\n00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.370\nThis is reaching out to Microsoft,\nreaching out to the servers that are out\n\n363\n00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:37.030\nthere in Microsoft's data center and\nlooking for updates.\n\n364\n00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:40.240\nA company can set up their own server, and\n\n365\n00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.250\nyou can reach out and\ncheck with your company instead.\n\n366\n00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:44.990\nNow, why would we do that?\n\n367\n00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:47.920\nSometimes companies need to have\ncontrol of what updates you get.\n\n368\n00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.510\nThere might be an update that comes\nout that breaks a program you run.\n\n369\n00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.360\nYou see that with the new versions\nof Internet Explorer a lot.\n\n370\n00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.030\nYou might have a program that runs\ngreat in Internet Explorer 10, and\n\n371\n00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:58.910\nthen in Internet Explorer 11 it doesn't.\n\n372\n00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:01.210\nThe website doesn't render or\nwhatever, it's broken.\n\n373\n00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:04.580\nSo a company might choose to\nwithhold Internet Explorer 11.\n\n374\n00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:07.740\nWell, they need to do that\nacross the whole company.\n\n375\n00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:12.320\nSo, in an enterprise environment they\ncan actually change these settings and\n\n376\n00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.840\nmake it mandatory across their PCs.\n\n377\n00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.810\nSo, if you come into these settings and\n\n378\n00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:19.830\nthis says the settings are managed\nby a system administrator.\n\n379\n00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:22.545\nOr controlled by your organization,\nand it won't let you change anything,\n\n380\n00:17:22.545 --> 00:17:24.020\nthat's a great example of that, right?\n\n381\n00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:28.050\nThat you can't change it, because your\ncompany is controlling it, all right?\n\n382\n00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:31.160\nOn your home computer,\nyou have full control, it's your computer.\n\n383\n00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.170\nBut on a work computer you probably won't.\n\n384\n00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:37.120\nExpect to see that, where you can't go\nin and change these options, all right?\n\n385\n00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:40.210\nAnd that's because they\nneed to ensure that\n\n386\n00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:42.470\nthousands of computers\nare all kept up to date.\n\n387\n00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:47.335\nNot worried about one computer,\nthey're worried about thousands, and so,\n\n388\n00:17:47.335 --> 00:17:49.777\nmandatorily setting those settings.\n\n389\n00:17:49.777 --> 00:17:50.775\nThat's a terrible sentence.\n\n390\n00:17:50.775 --> 00:17:53.318\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, forcing those settings out,\n\n391\n00:17:53.318 --> 00:17:56.340\nthere we go,\nis the best way to guarantee that for\n\n392\n00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.165\na company, so\nyou may see that out and about.\n\n393\n00:17:59.165 --> 00:18:01.736\n>> Oh, yeah, I've definitely had\nmy fair share of that business,\n\n394\n00:18:01.736 --> 00:18:03.246\nespecially when it came to browsers.\n\n395\n00:18:03.246 --> 00:18:06.261\nIn a company Don and\nI both have worked for in the past,\n\n396\n00:18:06.261 --> 00:18:09.860\nthere was a lot of website\nusage with third party vendors.\n\n397\n00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:10.830\nNow, third party vendor,\n\n398\n00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:14.590\na new version of maybe Internet Explorer\nwould come out, right?\n\n399\n00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:16.650\nAnd we would push that new\nversion of Internet Explorer.\n\n400\n00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:19.700\nWe knew that all our\nin-house apps worked fine.\n\n401\n00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.620\nBut their third party vendors,\nthey had yet to upgrade,\n\n402\n00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.660\nmake sure all their apps would work.\n\n403\n00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.730\nSo what would happen, people would call\nand say I'm trying to get to such and\n\n404\n00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:30.310\nsuch a website, and\nit's not working correctly.\n\n405\n00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:32.500\nThings aren't being displayed properly.\n\n406\n00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.810\nAnd we would try to figure out,\nmaybe there's a setting we can move.\n\n407\n00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:38.030\nBut really it all boiled down\nto is they were not up to\n\n408\n00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:41.760\ndate as we were with our apps, so\nwe would have to roll them back.\n\n409\n00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.210\nAnd we'd have to make a separate group to\nput them in and say, okay, they don't need\n\n410\n00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:50.720\nto be forced into the new version of this\nsoftware because it causes them problems.\n\n411\n00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.860\nIt can be a bit of an administrative\nnightmare for us as admins, but\n\n412\n00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:57.280\nit's just one of those things you\ngotta live with and it does happen.\n\n413\n00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.940\nSo, yeah, Don is correct.\n\n414\n00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:03.524\nEvery now and then a update will,\nquote unquote, break things.\n\n415\n00:19:03.524 --> 00:19:06.934\nBut it's probably not, I mean it\ndoes happen, it does break things.\n\n416\n00:19:06.934 --> 00:19:10.970\nBut when that happens, it's rare, it's\nnot something that happens all the time.\n\n417\n00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:12.840\nI did see a lot of people that thought,\n\n418\n00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.640\nI'll just stop doing updates\nbecause it breaks everything.\n\n419\n00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.830\nWell, that is not the best policy.\n\n420\n00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:18.740\nCan they break stuff?\n\n421\n00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.040\nYes, it does happen from time to time.\n\n422\n00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:24.750\nBut us as your administrators, or you\nas one day you may become one was well,\n\n423\n00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:27.140\nyou go in, you find out what the problem\nis, you get things get fixed.\n\n424\n00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:30.000\nMicrosoft will then release probably\na new patch that fixes what\n\n425\n00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.758\nwas broken with the old patch.\n\n426\n00:19:31.758 --> 00:19:35.320\n[LAUGH] It's a never-ending circle with\nthe patching, that's for sure, right, Don?\n\n427\n00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.030\n>> Yeah, and it generates support tickets.\n\n428\n00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:39.865\nNow you get your whole team involved so\nit's an actual cost to the company.\n\n429\n00:19:39.865 --> 00:19:41.692\nSo we definitely want to be aware that.\n\n430\n00:19:41.692 --> 00:19:46.234\nIt's a real issue,\nthat companies are going to have.\n\n431\n00:19:46.234 --> 00:19:47.555\nIn the background you hear, Daniel,\n\n432\n00:19:47.555 --> 00:19:49.661\nI'm trying to sign in with my\nMicrosoft account real quick so\n\n433\n00:19:49.661 --> 00:19:51.710\nI can kinda show them that app\nscreen that was empty for me.\n\n434\n00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:53.590\nHere we go, let me show you guys this.\n\n435\n00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:57.710\nSo I just signed into the Windows Store\nwith my own account so\n\n436\n00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:58.980\nI could see some apps.\n\n437\n00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:03.120\nAnd so here you can see apps that\nI've either installed before or\n\n438\n00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.440\npurchased before.\n\n439\n00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.100\nAnd so, as you look through here you'll\nsee the different apps that are a part of\n\n440\n00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.330\nit, and whether they're available or not.\n\n441\n00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.260\nAnd well,\na lot of these are saying not available,\n\n442\n00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:13.890\nwhich is probably cuz I haven't\nlogged out and logged back in yet.\n\n443\n00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:15.420\nBut if there's an update available,\n\n444\n00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.710\nit'll actually show up right here\nin the very beginning so you know.\n\n445\n00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:19.630\nAnd there'll be an Update All button.\n\n446\n00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:22.400\nYou just hit that and it knocks thorough\nthat update and get's it take care of.\n\n447\n00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.880\nSo, a lot of different excuses for\n\n448\n00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:28.180\nnot doing updates, a lot of people put the\nupdates off, they wait for it to happen,\n\n449\n00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:30.050\nand that's just a recipe for disaster.\n\n450\n00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:33.325\nSo you wanna make sure you get in\nthere and you do those updates.\n\n451\n00:20:33.325 --> 00:20:36.635\nGet the system put back the way it\nneeds to be, the way that it's fixed.\n\n452\n00:20:36.635 --> 00:20:37.865\nAnd now you're protected and you're safe.\n\n453\n00:20:37.865 --> 00:20:40.315\nYou'll have the best\nexperience with your computer.\n\n454\n00:20:40.315 --> 00:20:40.935\n>> All right, Don.\n\n455\n00:20:40.935 --> 00:20:43.102\nWell, we've talked a lot\nabout updates today.\n\n456\n00:20:43.102 --> 00:20:46.650\nObviously the importance of them,\nwe can't harp on that enough.\n\n457\n00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:50.382\nAlways a good policy to, if you can,\njust set it to that automatic update,\n\n458\n00:20:50.382 --> 00:20:51.817\nlet the system do it for you.\n\n459\n00:20:51.817 --> 00:20:54.019\nAutomation, it's why we have\ncomputers anyway, right Don?\n\n460\n00:20:54.019 --> 00:20:54.826\n>> Yep, absolutely.\n\n461\n00:20:54.826 --> 00:20:57.007\n>> All right,\nwell hopefully we haven't missed anything.\n\n462\n00:20:57.007 --> 00:20:57.652\nYou have anything else you wanna add here?\n\n463\n00:20:57.652 --> 00:20:58.822\n>> No that's it.\n\n464\n00:20:58.822 --> 00:21:01.530\n>> All right, well hopefully you guys\nout there have enjoyed this episode\n\n465\n00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:03.428\n>> We thank you for watching, signing for\n\n466\n00:21:03.428 --> 00:21:05.737\nITProTV, I've been your\nhost Daniel Lowrie.\n\n467\n00:21:05.737 -->

your\n\n3\n00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:19.750\nhost, Daniel Lowry,\nhere with me is none other than Don Pezet.\n\n4\n00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.120\nHow's it going today Don?\n\n5\n00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.570\n>> It is going great Daniel,\nexcited to be back on the show, and\n\n6\n00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.600\ntoday we're gonna be looking at\nstorage inside of Windows 8.\n\n7\n00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.490\nYou know when you get a new computer and\nyou're getting logged in,\n\n8\n00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:31.250\ngetting things setup.\n\n9\n00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.960\nOne of the big things we have to\nbe concerned about is storage.\n\n10\n00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.710\nWhere we're going to put our stuff.\n\n11\n00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.570\nBecause while a lot of stuff is\ngoing into the cloud these days,\n\n12\n00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.170\nthere's still plenty of things\nwe work on on our own system.\n\n13\n00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.290\nSo, if you're writing documents,\ngathering email,\n\n14\n00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.710\ntaking photos,\nWhere do you put all that stuff?\n\n15\n00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.850\nPut it on the storage\ninside of your system.\n\n16\n00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.860\nAnd fortunately in the Windows 8 world and\njust the Windows world in general there\n\n17\n00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.285\nare a ton of different storage solutions\nthat are available for you out there.\n\n18\n00:00:57.285 --> 00:00:59.420\nWe;re going to take a look\nat a few of them right here.\n\n19\n00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.210\nAll right now when you buy\na machine today storage becomes\n\n20\n00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.530\ndirt cheap compared to back in the day.\n\n21\n00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.270\nDaniel when you guys started, what was\nthe size of your first hard drive?\n\n22\n00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.581\nI think the size of my first\nhard drive was 4.3 Gigs.\n\n23\n00:01:12.581 --> 00:01:14.360\n>> 4.3 gigs.\n\n24\n00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.835\nMine was 20 megs, and either way,\n\n25\n00:01:17.835 --> 00:01:20.860\n4.3 gigs today,\nhow fast would you burn through that?\n\n26\n00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.210\n>> Oh, in a heartbeat.\n\n27\n00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.160\n>> You really did, you ate up storage,\nwhen you bought a computer,\n\n28\n00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.860\nyou always wanted to get as\nmuch storage as you could.\n\n29\n00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.860\nWell today, storage has become so cheap,\nthat pretty much every computer has like\n\n30\n00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.760\na terabyte of storage in it,\nand yet tons of it available.\n\n31\n00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.080\nAnd so, we don't worry so\nmuch about the amount that what we have.\n\n32\n00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.980\nWhat we worry more about is how we\nprotect our data, and don't lose it.\n\n33\n00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.510\nSo we always need to\nkeep that in mind that\n\n34\n00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.280\nwe don't just want to have\none copy of our data.\n\n35\n00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.610\nIt's usually ideal to have\nmore than one copy of data.\n\n36\n00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.660\nAnd so, we're going to talk\nabout that in this episode too.\n\n37\n00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.710\nIn fact, there's probably so\n\n38\n00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.020\nmuch that we'll have to do a two-parter\non this to get through it all.\n\n39\n00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.840\nBut we want to basically have\nan understanding of how Windows treats\n\n40\n00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.310\nstorage, and\nthen what we can do to make it better or\n\n41\n00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.190\nin some cases already making it better for\nus.\n\n42\n00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.320\nAll right, now if you're sitting on a\ntypical Windows 8 machine, you log in for\n\n43\n00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.635\nthe first time when you're fired up,\nwhat was our storage look like?\n\n44\n00:02:13.635 --> 00:02:17.585\nWell, Windows typically expects\nyou to have a hard drive, right?\n\n45\n00:02:17.585 --> 00:02:18.865\nPretty much every body has a hard drive.\n\n46\n00:02:18.865 --> 00:02:20.845\nNow the hard drive might be\none of the spinning drives or\n\n47\n00:02:20.845 --> 00:02:23.990\none of the solid state digital, the SSDs.\n\n48\n00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.490\nThose are super fast but super expensive.\n\n49\n00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.180\nIt's up to your wallet which\none your computer has, right?\n\n50\n00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.800\nBut either way,\nWindows sees it the same way.\n\n51\n00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.200\nWindows will take your hard drive and\nit assigns a drive letter to them.\n\n52\n00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.100\nJust a letter from the alphabet to\nidentify each storage location, and\n\n53\n00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.180\nyour hard drive is\ntypically the primary one.\n\n54\n00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.440\nWhich it gives the letter C, right.\n\n55\n00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.290\nSo you'll see C colon, that'll be\nthe drive letter for your main hard drive.\n\n56\n00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.080\nNow why do they start with C?\n\n57\n00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.030\nWell the letters A and\n\n58\n00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.020\nB used to be used back in the day\nwhen we had floppy disks, right?\n\n59\n00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.880\nAnd I said that my first\nhard drive was 20 megs,\n\n60\n00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.690\nthat wasn't actually my first computer.\n\n61\n00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.520\nMy first computer didn't have a hard drive\nat all and you just used floppy disks.\n\n62\n00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.910\nAnd so if you were like me you had one\nfloppy disk and that was your A drive, but\n\n63\n00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.730\nfor people who really had money\nthey had two floppy disks and\n\n64\n00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.220\nthat was their A and B drives.\n\n65\n00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.160\nAnd so with hard drives like we see today,\nthat's why they start with the letter C.\n\n66\n00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.000\nAnd so each of your hard drives\nwill have that drive letter.\n\n67\n00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.840\nAnd so\nif I take this Windows 8 machine and\n\n68\n00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.840\nI jump into my PC kind of\nlayout here in my explorer.\n\n69\n00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.040\nI'll see that C drive sitting right there.\n\n70\n00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.040\nRight?\nThat's a local hard drive on my system.\n\n71\n00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.410\nNow you might also see a DVD drive,\nright I've got one here it's a letter D.\n\n72\n00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.990\nNow, some people think D stands for\nDVD it doesn't.\n\n73\n00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.220\nIt's just the next letter in the alphabet.\n\n74\n00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.950\nIf I had more hard drives when this\nsystem booted up the first time,\n\n75\n00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.190\nthen my DVD drive might be drive E for\nthat matter.\n\n76\n00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.740\nWho knows what it'll end up as.\n\n77\n00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:49.720\nSo these are just letters.\n\n78\n00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.410\nBut if you're like me,\nyou might even have more computers.\n\n79\n00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.820\nSo see how I've got an E, an F,\n\n80\n00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.630\na G, an H, I've got all these other hard\ndrives that are attached to this system.\n\n81\n00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.040\nSo, each one is getting a drive letter,\nand\n\n82\n00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.290\nthat's expanding the amount\nof available storage.\n\n83\n00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.300\nNow, on a new install of Windows,\n\n84\n00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.430\nyour C drive is gonna contain the\noperating system, all of your programs,\n\n85\n00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.300\nall of your documents,\nyour user profile, all your settings.\n\n86\n00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.260\nEverything is on the C Drive and\nevery other hard drive is ignored.\n\n87\n00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.080\nIt's up to you to make use of them.\n\n88\n00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.540\nSo if I want to store a ton of photos and\n\n89\n00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.650\nI don't have enough room on my\nC Drive I have to remember to save them\n\n90\n00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.300\nto that E Drive or F Drive or\nwhatever else it is that I have, right?\n\n91\n00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.120\nThis is all considered local storage.\n\n92\n00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.490\nIt's stored on a hard drive\nright here in this computer.\n\n93\n00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.020\nRight?\n\n94\n00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.240\nSo if I have a bunch of photos\nstored on my F drive and\n\n95\n00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.500\nthen I go to Daniel's computer and\nI want to access my photos, can I do it?\n\n96\n00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.620\nNot easily.\n\n97\n00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.230\nThere are a few ways you can make it work,\nbut it's not easy.\n\n98\n00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.660\nThe data is here on my computer,\nall right?\n\n99\n00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.650\nAnd we'll see in another episode\nhow to make it work where we can\n\n100\n00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.120\nshare that if we need to.\n\n101\n00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.750\nBut, there is another option.\n\n102\n00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.500\nWe don't have to use storage\nright here on our own machine.\n\n103\n00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.590\nWe can use cloud storage, right?\n\n104\n00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.500\nWe could use storage that's\nout on the Internet.\n\n105\n00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.760\nAnd when you use cloud storage like that,\nlike Microsoft OneDrive,\n\n106\n00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.350\nthat's their main product for it.\n\n107\n00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.170\nIf you use Microsoft OneDrive,\nall of your documents,\n\n108\n00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.220\nall of your files, they're actually\nstored out there on the Internet.\n\n109\n00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.000\nAnd then your computer downloads them.\n\n110\n00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.970\nAnd if you log in on five computers,\nall five computers download that data.\n\n111\n00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.640\nNow, your data's in five different places,\nright.\n\n112\n00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.700\nThere's some cool parts to that, right.\n\n113\n00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.390\nThe really cool part is\nif I lose my laptop.\n\n114\n00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.020\nWhat happens if somebody steals my laptop?\n\n115\n00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.460\nWell, I've lost my data,\nI've lost these drives.\n\n116\n00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.210\nIf that was the only copy\nof my data I'm out of luck.\n\n117\n00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.080\nBut with a cloud service, I can just\nlog on, on any other computer and\n\n118\n00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.810\nthere's my data.\n\n119\n00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.960\nIt's available, it's right there,\nit's part of the cloud.\n\n120\n00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.260\nSo, when we start looking at our\ncomputers and we look at the storage,\n\n121\n00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.280\ndon't automatically assume that\nyou have to have local storage.\n\n122\n00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.550\nIf you need a ton of photo storage,\nyou don't necessarily need to buy more\n\n123\n00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.050\nhard drives for your computer,\nyou get to go and use cloud service.\n\n124\n00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.610\nMicrosoft gives OneDrive service away for\nfree.\n\n125\n00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.540\nYou can go and sign up for\nOneDrive and I think.\n\n126\n00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.200\nDo you know what it is Daniel,\nis it 20 gigs that you get?\n\n127\n00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.890\n>> I believe it is.\n\n128\n00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.330\nI believe it's 20 gigs.\n\n129\n00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.660\n>> Let's go to their\nwebsite we'll find out.\n\n130\n00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.690\nSo they give that away if you need more,\nyeah, then you gotta pay, right?\n\n131\n00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.250\nBut otherwise,\nthey're giving that access away for free.\n\n132\n00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.970\nSo right here you can see,\nkeep all your data in one place.\n\n133\n00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.200\nSign up if you don't have an account now,\nthey will give you some storage.\n\n134\n00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.100\nYou can save your photos, and so on.\n\n135\n00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.180\nThis is something they're\nmaking a big push for,\n\n136\n00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.960\nbecause it really does help\nyou to store your data.\n\n137\n00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.840\nI mean,\nthat's really one of the nice things.\n\n138\n00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.340\nOh it's 15.\n\n139\n00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.610\n>> 15 gigs.\n>> 15 gigabytes for free.\n\n140\n00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.810\nNow for your user settings and your\ndocuments, that's probably enough space.\n\n141\n00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.270\nBut if you've got a big photo collection,\n\n142\n00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.810\nyou're probably going\nto blow through that.\n\n143\n00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.350\nSo, they've got options where you\ncan pay to get more storage and\n\n144\n00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.370\nhave access to that too.\n\n145\n00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:40.840\nBut they're giving this away for free.\n\n146\n00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.470\n>> I'll tell you Don,\n15 gigs is nothing to sneeze at.\n\n147\n00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.530\nI've got a 16 gig memory card,\nI do amateur photography.\n\n148\n00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:52.180\nI could shoot 2-300 photos,\nit does come close to filling that up.\n\n149\n00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.270\n>> Well, I know in that scenario,\nthat's great.\n\n150\n00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.030\nIn mine, a few years ago,\nI decided to rip all of my audio CDs,\n\n151\n00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.036\nand I ripped them all to MP3.\n\n152\n00:07:00.036 --> 00:07:02.300\nNothing crazy, nothing FLAC or\nanything crazy like that,\n\n153\n00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:07.980\njust regular MP3's and my CD collection\nended up being about 30 gigs in size.\n\n154\n00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:12.000\nSo if I want my music to be available on\nall my PC's this 15 gigs is not going\n\n155\n00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.560\nto be enough.\n\n156\n00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.780\nI might need to pay more\nobviously they can fit under it,\n\n157\n00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.340\nit's a great service you get for free.\n\n158\n00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.160\nAnd Microsoft runs promos all the time,\nwhere they give out extra storage too.\n\n159\n00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.662\nSo there's different ways to bump that up,\nbut they do have different plans for it.\n\n160\n00:07:22.662 --> 00:07:26.048\nNow OneDrive is really\ngeared toward the end user.\n\n161\n00:07:26.048 --> 00:07:28.500\nIf you're an end user and you wanna\nstore that data out there in the cloud,\n\n162\n00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.000\nit works out great.\n\n163\n00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.990\nIf you are a business though,\nOneDrive has some limitations.\n\n164\n00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.740\nRight?\nFor example, it's really designed for\n\n165\n00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.130\none person to be accessing it,\nnot more than one person.\n\n166\n00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.030\nAnd it's got share functionality in it,\nbut\n\n167\n00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:44.410\nit's not exactly the same as giving\nsomebody true access to the files.\n\n168\n00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.100\nSo for businesses, they might chose\nto setup a file server, right?\n\n169\n00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.410\nA dedicated server that hosts their files.\n\n170\n00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.128\nOr they might choose to use\nsomething like Azure storage.\n\n171\n00:07:52.128 --> 00:07:55.947\nMicrosoft Azure, that's their hosted\nserver environment that they have.\n\n172\n00:07:55.947 --> 00:07:59.105\nIt's a lot more than just hosted servers,\nbut But that's the key piece.\n\n173\n00:07:59.105 --> 00:08:01.787\nAnd they have Azure storage where\nyou can pay by the gigabyte.\n\n174\n00:08:01.787 --> 00:08:04.000\nYou pay for what you use, and\nyou can store it up in the Cloud, too.\n\n175\n00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.020\nSo they got solutions for the end-user,\nas well as solutions for the business.\n\n176\n00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.400\nAnd you'll find as you start to\nuse other Microsoft products,\n\n177\n00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.568\nlike if you use OneNote or Office 365,\nit'll give you even more storage.\n\n178\n00:08:16.568 --> 00:08:19.688\nThere's a thing going on right now,\nI don't think it's going on,\n\n179\n00:08:19.688 --> 00:08:23.191\nI think it's a permanent deal,\nwhen you sign up for Office 365 service,\n\n180\n00:08:23.191 --> 00:08:25.020\nyou get one terabyte of Cloud storage.\n\n181\n00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:25.961\nThat's a lot, right?\n\n182\n00:08:25.961 --> 00:08:28.247\nThat's a ton for\neither of our scenarios, Dan.\n\n183\n00:08:28.247 --> 00:08:32.610\nSo, that kind of option is out there if\nyou want to leverage Cloud storage, right.\n\n184\n00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.677\nIt's definitely something you\nshould think about, right.\n\n185\n00:08:34.677 --> 00:08:37.280\nNow, why do I say that it's\nsomething you should think about?\n\n186\n00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.607\nWell, I gave you guys the example of,\nwhat if somebody steals my laptop?\n\n187\n00:08:41.607 --> 00:08:42.303\nI'm gonna lose my data.\n\n188\n00:08:42.303 --> 00:08:45.966\nIf my data is just local to this\nmachine and somebody steals my laptop,\n\n189\n00:08:45.966 --> 00:08:47.406\nI just lost it all, right?\n\n190\n00:08:47.406 --> 00:08:50.367\nHaving it out there on the one drive,\nI can go and get it, and\n\n191\n00:08:50.367 --> 00:08:52.212\nwe'll be back in business, rIght?\n\n192\n00:08:52.212 --> 00:08:57.900\nBut, what if it's not being\nsynchronized up to the Cloud?\n\n193\n00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.246\nIt's just right here on the machine,\nand I've got a desktop.\n\n194\n00:09:00.246 --> 00:09:02.463\nA desktop stays at home,\nno one is going to steal that.\n\n195\n00:09:02.463 --> 00:09:03.729\nI'm not going to lose my desktop.\n\n196\n00:09:03.729 --> 00:09:04.344\nIt's sitting there at home.\n\n197\n00:09:04.344 --> 00:09:07.606\nWell, hard drives fail, right?\n\n198\n00:09:07.606 --> 00:09:10.706\nSpinning hard drives and SSDs,\nthey both have fail rates.\n\n199\n00:09:10.706 --> 00:09:13.920\nMost SSDs are only rates for three years.\n\n200\n00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.960\nA lot of spinning hard drives these\ndays only come with a one year warranty.\n\n201\n00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.651\nThat shows you the confidence that\nmanufacturer has in that device.\n\n202\n00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:20.788\nIt's only gonna last a year, right?\n\n203\n00:09:20.788 --> 00:09:23.167\nSo, some of them have\nthree year warranties.\n\n204\n00:09:23.167 --> 00:09:24.759\nBut either way, beyond three years,\n\n205\n00:09:24.759 --> 00:09:27.161\nvery few devices have more\nthan a three-year warranty.\n\n206\n00:09:27.161 --> 00:09:30.000\nSo, that's kind of their limitation.\n\n207\n00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.070\nSo, are you replacing your\nhard drive every three years?\n\n208\n00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:34.820\nDaniel, do you replace your\nhard drive every three years?\n\n209\n00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.340\n>> Heck, no, I don't, that sucker.\n\n210\n00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.423\nI'm keeping it around\nas long as it'll spin.\n\n211\n00:09:38.423 --> 00:09:39.490\n>> Me, too, right?\n\n212\n00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:43.250\nDon't fix something that isn't broke,\nI'm going to run it until it runs out.\n\n213\n00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.940\nWell, what happens when it runs out?\n\n214\n00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:46.640\nIt fails.\n\n215\n00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.572\nAnd if that's the only copy of your data,\nyou lose it.\n\n216\n00:09:49.572 --> 00:09:52.591\nSo, we need to have some\nkind of back up plan.\n\n217\n00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:57.849\nSo, in Windows 8, there's actually two\ndifferent types of local storage, right.\n\n218\n00:09:57.849 --> 00:10:02.220\nThis C drive that I'm showing\nyou guys right here, this guy,\n\n219\n00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:07.870\nthis is what's called, it's a dumb name,\nit's JBOD, just a bunch of disks.\n\n220\n00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:09.820\nIt's the dumbest acronym ever,\n\n221\n00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:13.170\nand all it means is that it's\na stand-alone hard drive.\n\n222\n00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:15.191\nIt's just a hard drive all by itself.\n\n223\n00:10:15.191 --> 00:10:17.791\nAnd, if that hard drive fails,\nI lose everything on it, right?\n\n224\n00:10:17.791 --> 00:10:19.137\nIt's gone, and that's it, right?\n\n225\n00:10:19.137 --> 00:10:21.611\nThat's how a typical hard drive works.\n\n226\n00:10:21.611 --> 00:10:25.977\nAnd that's the default type of storage for\nWindows 8.\n\n227\n00:10:25.977 --> 00:10:29.133\nThey assume you've only got one drive,\nright.\n\n228\n00:10:29.133 --> 00:10:33.470\nBut, there's a new type of storage\navailable in Windows 8 called\n\n229\n00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:34.636\na Storage Space.\n\n230\n00:10:34.636 --> 00:10:39.176\nAnd a storage space says, hey,\nyou might have more than one hard drive.\n\n231\n00:10:39.176 --> 00:10:41.672\nSo, wouldn't it be nice\nif I took your data and\n\n232\n00:10:41.672 --> 00:10:43.598\nstored it in two different places?\n\n233\n00:10:43.598 --> 00:10:45.839\nAll right.\nSo, now if I have two hard drives, or\n\n234\n00:10:45.839 --> 00:10:48.818\nfive hard drives, or ten hard drives,\nwhen I write data to it,\n\n235\n00:10:48.818 --> 00:10:51.818\nWindows will automatically store\nit on two different drives.\n\n236\n00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:56.149\nAnd that way, if one drive fails,\nI've got another drive available, right?\n\n237\n00:10:56.149 --> 00:10:59.656\nThat's got my data on it, and\nI can now survive that failure.\n\n238\n00:10:59.656 --> 00:11:03.673\nRegular drives like this one\ngives you zero redundancy.\n\n239\n00:11:03.673 --> 00:11:05.669\nThere's no redundancy on that drive,\n\n240\n00:11:05.669 --> 00:11:08.153\nunless I couple it with a Cloud servers,\nright?\n\n241\n00:11:08.153 --> 00:11:09.829\nStorage spaces, on the other hand,\n\n242\n00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:13.517\ncan give you redundancy right here on\nthe machine without leveraging the Cloud.\n\n243\n00:11:13.517 --> 00:11:14.654\nMaybe you've got private data and\n\n244\n00:11:14.654 --> 00:11:16.268\nyou don't want to stick it in the Cloud,\nright?\n\n245\n00:11:16.268 --> 00:11:17.708\nOr maybe, you just don't trust Microsoft.\n\n246\n00:11:17.708 --> 00:11:19.449\nHey, I don't want to\ntrust them with my data.\n\n247\n00:11:19.449 --> 00:11:20.993\nI want to keep it right here.\n\n248\n00:11:20.993 --> 00:11:23.571\nMaybe you don't have\nan internet connection.\n\n249\n00:11:23.571 --> 00:11:24.568\nMaybe you don't have the bandwidth.\n\n250\n00:11:24.568 --> 00:11:26.302\nIf you have a terabyte of data,\n\n251\n00:11:26.302 --> 00:11:30.455\nsure it's great that the Cloud services\noffer you a terabyte of storage.\n\n252\n00:11:30.455 --> 00:11:31.871\nBut have you ever uploaded\na terabyte of data?\n\n253\n00:11:31.871 --> 00:11:33.834\nIt take's a little while.\n\n254\n00:11:33.834 --> 00:11:37.373\n>> I only have a 350 mb data cap,\nso I'm kind of in trouble.\n\n255\n00:11:37.373 --> 00:11:40.172\n>> So it would take you months!\n\n256\n00:11:40.172 --> 00:11:42.435\n[CROSSTALK] That's not\ngoing to work right?\n\n257\n00:11:42.435 --> 00:11:47.930\nAnd so, those are all big challenges\nwith synchronizing up to the Cloud.\n\n258\n00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:51.745\nSo, if you want fast replication that\ndoesn't need bandwidth, that doesn't need\n\n259\n00:11:51.745 --> 00:11:55.739\nanother connection, that doesn't require\nthird parties, Storage Spaces can do it.\n\n260\n00:11:55.739 --> 00:11:57.342\nLet me show you how these things work.\n\n261\n00:11:57.342 --> 00:12:00.744\nFirst off,\nyou need to have at least two hard drives.\n\n262\n00:12:00.744 --> 00:12:03.088\nSo, when you look at my system,\nhow many hard drives do I have?\n\n263\n00:12:03.088 --> 00:12:06.907\nWell, you can't really\ntrust what you see here.\n\n264\n00:12:06.907 --> 00:12:09.287\nLooking at it,\nit looks like I've got five hard drives.\n\n265\n00:12:09.287 --> 00:12:13.699\nMaybe, maybe not.\n\n266\n00:12:13.699 --> 00:12:18.199\nWhen you look at a hard drive, the default\nfor Windows is to take the whole hard\n\n267\n00:12:18.199 --> 00:12:21.605\ndrive and make it one big drive,\ngive it one drive letter.\n\n268\n00:12:21.605 --> 00:12:24.125\nBut we can do what's called Partitioning.\n\n269\n00:12:24.125 --> 00:12:25.631\nYou can take a drive and\ndivide it up into volumes and\n\n270\n00:12:25.631 --> 00:12:26.761\neach volume get's its drive letter.\n\n271\n00:12:26.761 --> 00:12:30.786\nSo when I look at E, F, G, H,\n\n272\n00:12:30.786 --> 00:12:37.345\nthat look like four hard drives, right?\n\n273\n00:12:37.345 --> 00:12:41.125\nBut in actually, in the back-end,\nit's one hard drive.\n\n274\n00:12:41.125 --> 00:12:44.960\nIt's one hard drive divided\ninto four pieces, all right?\n\n275\n00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.360\nSo don't trust what you see here.\n\n276\n00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.070\nThis doesn't tell me how\nmany hard drives I have.\n\n277\n00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:53.038\nTo really see how many hard drives I have,\nI need to go into disk management,\n\n278\n00:12:53.038 --> 00:12:53.662\nall right?\n\n279\n00:12:53.662 --> 00:12:55.069\nTo get into disk management,\n\n280\n00:12:55.069 --> 00:12:59.090\nthe easiest way to do it is to bring up\nyour start menu or your start screen.\n\n281\n00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:01.010\nI'm just pressing the Windows\nkey to get there.\n\n282\n00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:03.425\nAnd if you just type computer or this PC,\n\n283\n00:13:03.425 --> 00:13:07.130\nthere's a couple of different\nthings you can type, system.\n\n284\n00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:10.024\nWhat we're looking for\nis this icon here that says, This PC.\n\n285\n00:13:10.024 --> 00:13:12.785\nSo, I just type computer and\nThis PC came up.\n\n286\n00:13:12.785 --> 00:13:17.710\nAll right, you want to right-click on This\nPC and you'll see an option for Manage.\n\n287\n00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:22.491\nThis is going to take us into whats\ncalled the Computer Management Screen.\n\n288\n00:13:22.491 --> 00:13:25.475\nInside of computer management, I probably\ncould have just typed computer management,\n\n289\n00:13:25.475 --> 00:13:26.980\ntoo, but I'm a lazy typer.\n\n290\n00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.273\nSo once we're inside\na computer management,\n\n291\n00:13:29.273 --> 00:13:32.388\nyou'll see all sorts of stuff\nthat applies to your computer and\n\n292\n00:13:32.388 --> 00:13:35.348\nthe one that I care about,\ndisk management, this screen.\n\n293\n00:13:35.348 --> 00:13:38.981\nWe'll show you how many hard\ndrives you have for real.\n\n294\n00:13:38.981 --> 00:13:40.607\nSo, this is the one that we can trust.\n\n295\n00:13:40.607 --> 00:13:44.670\nWe can't trust the output\nof our explorer screen.\n\n296\n00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:49.172\nAnd when I look in here,\nI see my E, F, G, H drives.\n\n297\n00:13:49.172 --> 00:13:50.333\nI see all those hard drives.\n\n298\n00:13:50.333 --> 00:13:54.512\nAnd looking down here,\nI can see disk zero, that's my C drive.\n\n299\n00:13:54.512 --> 00:13:57.799\nMy entire C drive is\nright here on disk zero.\n\n300\n00:13:57.799 --> 00:14:01.285\nAnd I've got disk one,\nand it's got E, F, G, H.\n\n301\n00:14:01.285 --> 00:14:05.300\nIt's got four drives\non one physical drive.\n\n302\n00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:09.450\nAll right, so these are volumes or\npartitions inside of disk one.\n\n303\n00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.960\nBut then, I've got disk two,\ndisk three, disk four.\n\n304\n00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.592\nI've got a couple more disks,\nand they are not being used.\n\n305\n00:14:16.592 --> 00:14:18.694\nSee how they say unallocated.\n\n306\n00:14:18.694 --> 00:14:22.420\nI've attached them to my computer,\nbut I'm not actually using them, yet.\n\n307\n00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:26.164\nNow, if I were to come in here,\nI could take this empty space,\n\n308\n00:14:26.164 --> 00:14:30.198\nand I could right-click and\nchoose to create a new simple volume.\n\n309\n00:14:30.198 --> 00:14:32.770\nAnd when I create a new\nsimple volume on it,\n\n310\n00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:36.566\nit's going to let me create a volume and\ngive it a drive letter.\n\n311\n00:14:36.566 --> 00:14:40.530\nAnd now, I'll be able to use it, and\nby default, it will fill this whole drive.\n\n312\n00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:45.210\nSo this is a 512 gig drive,\nI'd have 512 gigs of storage.\n\n313\n00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:48.485\nBut remember what my lead in is\nbecause I've kinda wandered off topic,\n\n314\n00:14:48.485 --> 00:14:49.310\nstorage spaces.\n\n315\n00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:52.288\nIf I create a simple volume here and\nI give it a drive letter,\n\n316\n00:14:52.288 --> 00:14:53.900\nI can put data on it.\n\n317\n00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:57.000\nBut if this drive fails,\nI've just lost all that data.\n\n318\n00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.080\nSo, wouldn't it be nice if I could write\ndata to this drive, and Windows would be\n\n319\n00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:07.140\nsmart enough to say, I'm going to put\na second copy on this next drive, right?\n\n320\n00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.220\nWe can do that.\n\n321\n00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:12.539\nWe can incorporate more than one drive\ninto a storage space and get that created,\n\n322\n00:15:12.539 --> 00:15:13.630\nget it put in place.\n\n323\n00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:16.847\nAnd now, we store duplicates of our data,\nand it's really, really neat.\n\n324\n00:15:16.847 --> 00:15:18.111\nAnd it's pretty easy, too.\n\n325\n00:15:18.111 --> 00:15:20.744\nAnd when you have three drives,\nif I put one file here,\n\n326\n00:15:20.744 --> 00:15:23.963\nit's not copying it to both,\nit just copies it to one or the other.\n\n327\n00:15:23.963 --> 00:15:27.063\nSo, it kind of balances it out\nto store your data twice, right?\n\n328\n00:15:27.063 --> 00:15:29.285\nSo, if I wanna get that set up, well,\n\n329\n00:15:29.285 --> 00:15:33.250\nthere's a nice little wizard that'll\nactually set this up for us.\n\n330\n00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:37.469\nIf we come back to our Start screen,\nwe can just type in storage, and\n\n331\n00:15:37.469 --> 00:15:42.444\nStorage Spaces will come right up, or\nyou can touch Storage Spaces if you want.\n\n332\n00:15:42.444 --> 00:15:46.411\nBut this is the new feature that we've got\nthat's going to allow us to set up all\n\n333\n00:15:46.411 --> 00:15:47.205\nthese drives.\n\n334\n00:15:47.205 --> 00:15:50.427\nAnd I'm going to jump in there, and\nit's basically going to tell me right now,\n\n335\n00:15:50.427 --> 00:15:51.930\nI don't have storage spaces set up.\n\n336\n00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:53.172\nMy screen is blank.\n\n337\n00:15:53.172 --> 00:15:55.645\nAnd so, it's offering to create\nwhat's called a Storage.\n\n338\n00:15:55.645 --> 00:15:56.609\nPool.\n\n339\n00:15:56.609 --> 00:15:58.048\nI wanna know what's a pool?\n\n340\n00:15:58.048 --> 00:16:01.030\nA pool is a collection\nof physical hard drives.\n\n341\n00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:04.410\nSo for storage spaces to work, it has to\nhave access to some physical hard drives.\n\n342\n00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:05.770\nHere's the tricky part.\n\n343\n00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:08.710\nThey have to be unused hard drives.\n\n344\n00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:11.790\nSo when I go back here, see how\nthese hard drives are sitting here?\n\n345\n00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:13.370\nI haven't done anything with them?\n\n346\n00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:14.120\nI can use these.\n\n347\n00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.680\nThese three drives are primed and\nready to go.\n\n348\n00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:23.100\nBut I couldn't use this one cuz it's\nalready got partitions on there.\n\n349\n00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:23.640\nAll right.\n\n350\n00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:26.430\nSo I would have to delete\nall these partitions\n\n351\n00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:27.870\nbefore I could add it into the store.\n\n352\n00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:29.830\nCuz or I'd have to delete at least one.\n\n353\n00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:31.650\nIt's gotta have at least some room.\n\n354\n00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:32.970\nIt doesn't have to have\nthe whole drive but\n\n355\n00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:35.780\nit's gotta have at least some room\nto be able to leverage that drive.\n\n356\n00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:38.440\nAll right, and\nthen I'll be able to add it to the pool.\n\n357\n00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:42.070\nThe other cool thing is, if our pool\nfills up, if we fill it with data,\n\n358\n00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:43.580\nwe can always add more drives later.\n\n359\n00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.210\nYou can add more drives to\nthe pool after the fact, and\n\n360\n00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:47.360\nit'll balance across the drives.\n\n361\n00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.370\nIt's really smart technology.\n\n362\n00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:54.790\nThe C drive, on the other hand, where\nmy operating system is, I can't use it,\n\n363\n00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:58.520\nand I can't delete that partition cuz\nthat's where my operating system is.\n\n364\n00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.590\nSo you cannot use storage\nspaces on your boot drive.\n\n365\n00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:05.570\nAll right that means that while storage\nspaces will make your data redundant\n\n366\n00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:08.050\nit is not a substitute for back ups.\n\n367\n00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:11.440\nYou still need to have\na back up of your C drive\n\n368\n00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.540\nbecause if it fails you are going\nto restore it from back up.\n\n369\n00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.140\nIt cannot come from storage spaces.\n\n370\n00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.670\nBut all of your data can.\n\n371\n00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:19.300\nSo just be aware that is\na limitation that we have with it.\n\n372\n00:17:20.632 --> 00:17:22.720\nAll right, so I want to go ahead and\nuse this stuff.\n\n373\n00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.600\nSo I'm going to jump back to my wizard,\nand\n\n374\n00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.920\nI'm going to create a new\npool in storage space.\n\n375\n00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.770\nSo the new pool,\nthat's the part that happens first.\n\n376\n00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:31.940\nIt's going to ask me what\ndrives I want to use.\n\n377\n00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:33.510\nSo it's listing my drives.\n\n378\n00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:34.950\nSee how it's only showing three of them?\n\n379\n00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:37.160\nIt's showing discs two, three, and four.\n\n380\n00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.730\nIt's not showing discs zero and\none because they're in use.\n\n381\n00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:41.730\nIt won't show drives that are in use.\n\n382\n00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:43.340\nAnd they're hidden right down here.\n\n383\n00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:45.020\nSo these are unformatted drives.\n\n384\n00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:48.920\nAnd I go down here to formatted drives,\nand now I can see disk one.\n\n385\n00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.290\nI still don't see disk zero cuz\nthat's where the operating system is.\n\n386\n00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:52.190\nI can't touch it.\n\n387\n00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:55.300\nBut this one is here, and\nit's offering to format it for me.\n\n388\n00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.790\nThat would be a good time wouldn't it?\n\n389\n00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:58.005\nI'm not gonna do that.\n\n390\n00:17:58.005 --> 00:18:02.260\n[LAUGH] I'll stick with these three\ndrives, and I'll hit create pool.\n\n391\n00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.710\nAll right, now I've got a pool of\nhard drives that are available for\n\n392\n00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:06.330\nstorage spaces.\n\n393\n00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.760\nNow I can start to actually\ncreate the storage space.\n\n394\n00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.050\nNow you can have more\nthan one storage space.\n\n395\n00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.020\nIf we wanna separate out our data.\n\n396\n00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.560\nWhy would we wanna separate data?\n\n397\n00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.880\nIn this day and age,\nI usually don't to be honest with you,\n\n398\n00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.650\nbut maybe you want to have limited\nstorage for certain things.\n\n399\n00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:27.910\nI want to make sure that my videos\nhave a certain amount of space and\n\n400\n00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:30.630\nmy music has a certain amount of space,\nand they don't compete with each other.\n\n401\n00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:33.760\nSo I might choose to create more\nthan one storage space for that, or\n\n402\n00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.920\nI might want to set\ndifferent redundancy levels.\n\n403\n00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.830\nMaybe I want my music to be redundant but\nmy videos not.\n\n404\n00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:43.470\nMaybe my photos I'm\nbacking up to the cloud so\n\n405\n00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:44.820\nI don't need them to be redundant.\n\n406\n00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.110\nI can save some space by\nnot making them redundant.\n\n407\n00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:50.050\nBut then my music's not going to\nthe cloud, so I want that to be redundant.\n\n408\n00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:53.590\nSo you can pick and choose settings if\nyou have more than one storage space.\n\n409\n00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:56.580\nIf you've only got one storage space\nthey all share the same setting and\n\n410\n00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:57.290\nthat's that.\n\n411\n00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:59.660\nSo if that's what you want,\none storage space is the easy way to go.\n\n412\n00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:03.660\nNow the computer will see\nthe storage space as a hard drive.\n\n413\n00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.690\nSo it's asking me that right here.\n\n414\n00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:07.165\nWhat name do I want to give it?\n\n415\n00:19:07.165 --> 00:19:08.835\nI'll just call my storage space.\n\n416\n00:19:08.835 --> 00:19:11.335\nWhat drive letter do I want it to have?\n\n417\n00:19:11.335 --> 00:19:14.065\nAnd what file system do I want it to have?\n\n418\n00:19:14.065 --> 00:19:16.815\nNow I'm gonna talk about these\nfile systems in a little bit, but\n\n419\n00:19:16.815 --> 00:19:18.977\nyou have two choices here, NTFS and RIFF.\n\n420\n00:19:18.977 --> 00:19:21.757\nMost people are gonna want NTFS for now.\n\n421\n00:19:21.757 --> 00:19:24.277\nIn the future,\nREFS will be the one to choose.\n\n422\n00:19:24.277 --> 00:19:25.827\nAnd again,\nwe'll talk about those in part two.\n\n423\n00:19:26.997 --> 00:19:29.267\nThen it's asking for my resiliency, right.\n\n424\n00:19:29.267 --> 00:19:30.607\nWhat resiliency type do I want?\n\n425\n00:19:30.607 --> 00:19:32.007\nAnd look at these choices.\n\n426\n00:19:32.007 --> 00:19:34.147\nThe default is a two way mirror.\n\n427\n00:19:34.147 --> 00:19:38.347\nAny data you write here will be\nstored twice, so it's kind of like a,\n\n428\n00:19:38.347 --> 00:19:39.927\nwhich raid level's a mirror, RAID one?\n\n429\n00:19:39.927 --> 00:19:40.897\n>> RAID one, yes.\n\n430\n00:19:40.897 --> 00:19:43.990\n>> So, it's like a RAID one array for\nhard drives, okay.\n\n431\n00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:45.770\nWith a hard drive on a rated control,\n\n432\n00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:48.550\nyou used to rate one to\nmirror one drive to another.\n\n433\n00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:52.770\nThe difference here is, with raid one,\nif I take two drives and\n\n434\n00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:53.970\nput them in a mirror.\n\n435\n00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:55.700\nThat's it.\nThose two drives can only be used for\n\n436\n00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:56.280\none mirror.\n\n437\n00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.555\nThey're mirroring the same data and\nthat's it.\n\n438\n00:19:58.555 --> 00:20:00.575\nStorage spaces are different though.\n\n439\n00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:03.475\nI could have data mirrored and\nhave more than\n\n440\n00:20:03.475 --> 00:20:06.795\none storage space on the same physical\ndrive, and it'll mirror them just fine.\n\n441\n00:20:06.795 --> 00:20:08.655\nSo it's a lot more flexible\nthan the traditional mirror.\n\n442\n00:20:10.205 --> 00:20:11.095\nYou'll see my options here though.\n\n443\n00:20:11.095 --> 00:20:12.440\nSimple no resiliency.\n\n444\n00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.688\nThat means data will be stored once.\n\n445\n00:20:13.688 --> 00:20:18.630\nWe've got two-way mirror, data will\nbe stored twice, three-way mirror,\n\n446\n00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:21.590\ndata will be stored three times,\nthat's if you absolutely have to be sure.\n\n447\n00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:25.400\nNow, some people say this is paranoia,\nbut let me give you a scenario.\n\n448\n00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.090\nOkay.\n\n449\n00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:29.010\nYou're sitting there one day and\nall of a sudden a hard drive fails.\n\n450\n00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:31.900\nYou see that red light come on or you hear\nthe clunking noise in your computer that\n\n451\n00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.250\nlets you know that hard drive is dead.\n\n452\n00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:37.010\nAnd you go, whew I am glad I\nhave two copies of that data.\n\n453\n00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:37.960\nOkay.\n\n454\n00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.950\nWell, the drive just failed.\n\n455\n00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:41.340\nHow many copies of\nthe data do you have now?\n\n456\n00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:45.900\nOne, how long is it gonna take\nyou to get a new hard drive?\n\n457\n00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:50.690\nMaybe you hop in the car that moment and\nrun right to the store, buy a hard drive,\n\n458\n00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:52.170\nbring it back, and install it.\n\n459\n00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:55.490\nOr maybe you say, I'm gonna go online and\nsee if I can get a deal and\n\n460\n00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:56.720\nthree days later I'll have a drive.\n\n461\n00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:01.870\nWell, over the next three days what\nhappens if you have another drive failure?\n\n462\n00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:05.800\nYour redundancies gone,\nyou just lost data.\n\n463\n00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.100\nThat's the danger.\n\n464\n00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.700\nSo we kind of say it like paranoia,\nbut it isn't paranoia.\n\n465\n00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:14.270\nIf you choose a three way mirror,\nyou could lose one drive and then you can\n\n466\n00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:16.690\ntake your time ordering the other drive,\nit will be here in three days great.\n\n467\n00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:20.940\nAnd if another drive fails,\nyou're okay you had three way, right?\n\n468\n00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:22.770\nAnd then you get your new drive in and\nyou replace it.\n\n469\n00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:27.240\nSo if you absolutely have to be sure, the\nthree way mirror, that's the way to go.\n\n470\n00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.030\nAnd then last we've got one called parody.\n\n471\n00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:32.400\nNow I'll tell you guys parody\nis not a great option.\n\n472\n00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:38.080\nWith parody instead of storing an entire\ncopy of your files twice, it stores like\n\n473\n00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:41.650\na digital signature of your data, it's\nreally a simple mathematical operation.\n\n474\n00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:45.020\nSo, it adds up the bits\nof data across that,\n\n475\n00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.910\nI don't want to get too complex on this,\ncuz we don't need to know it for the exam.\n\n476\n00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:50.470\nBut at the end of the day it\nends up storing one bit for\n\n477\n00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:52.300\neach bit of your regular data.\n\n478\n00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:55.180\nAnd it's just a zero or one, so\nit knows kind of what's stored.\n\n479\n00:21:55.180 --> 00:22:00.210\nAnd it takes less space than doing\nan actual second copy of your data.\n\n480\n00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:03.280\nSo, by doing that,\nwe can get more room out of our drive.\n\n481\n00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.970\nThe problem is to do that,\nit has to do a mathematical operation and\n\n482\n00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:07.580\nit's doing it in software.\n\n483\n00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:11.180\nAnd any time you do something in software\nlike that, it means it's slower.\n\n484\n00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:14.930\nSo if we choose parity, it's gonna slow\ndown our disc operations on the drive.\n\n485\n00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:17.870\nNot a giant amount, but it is gonna\nslow it down enough to be annoying if\n\n486\n00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:20.090\nyou're doing something like video editing.\n\n487\n00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:24.125\nSo if you want parity you're really better\noff doing a hardware raid controller.\n\n488\n00:22:24.125 --> 00:22:25.965\nWhich a lot of motherboards,\na lot of laptops,\n\n489\n00:22:25.965 --> 00:22:28.245\nthey have that built into them\nif you got more than one drive.\n\n490\n00:22:28.245 --> 00:22:30.135\nIt's not useful if you\nonly have one drive.\n\n491\n00:22:30.135 --> 00:22:33.365\nAll right, I'm going to go ahead and\nchoose a two way mirror, right.\n\n492\n00:22:33.365 --> 00:22:38.260\nNow, as I choose these options you might\nnotice down here, my storage sizes.\n\n493\n00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:39.040\nOkay.\n\n494\n00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.340\nI've got three 512 gig drives.\n\n495\n00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:46.150\nSo, if I do no redundancy,\nI end up with 1.49, or basically one and\n\n496\n00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:48.220\na half- terabytes of storage.\n\n497\n00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:49.500\nThat's the pool it's about to create.\n\n498\n00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.910\nIf I choose a two way mirror,\nit's gonna store my data twice.\n\n499\n00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:57.520\nSo what happens to my one and\na half terabytes?\n\n500\n00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.400\nIt gets divided in half.\n\n501\n00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.050\nSo now I'm down to 760 gigs of storage.\n\n502\n00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:04.250\nAnd if I do a three way.\n\n503\n00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:07.090\nWell, I get 0 gigs of storage.\n\n504\n00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:07.690\nIt dies out.\n\n505\n00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:08.530\nWhy is that?\n\n506\n00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:10.200\nWell, I don't have enough space.\n\n507\n00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.380\nThey're telling me I don't have\nenough room to do three and\n\n508\n00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.210\nstill have a reasonable\namount of data available.\n\n509\n00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:14.970\nSo I need more.\n\n510\n00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:16.770\nI'd need a fourth drive to do that.\n\n511\n00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:17.480\nAll right?\n\n512\n00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:22.200\nBut with two-way I can do it, and I just\nloose a decent amount of my data, right?\n\n513\n00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:26.380\nI can also choose parody, and you'll see\nwhere I only loose a third of that data.\n\n514\n00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.750\nAnd so\nI still have one terabyte available, so\n\n515\n00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:32.540\nparody takes less space than\nthe two-way mirror, okay?\n\n516\n00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:34.350\nSo I need to choose what's best for\nme, but\n\n517\n00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:36.810\nI am gonna loose some storage\nby doing this two-way mirror.\n\n518\n00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:37.940\nAll right.\n\n519\n00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:39.160\nI'll go ahead and choose to create it now.\n\n520\n00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.180\nNotice what it says about the size.\n\n521\n00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:41.452\nThis is the maximum.\n\n522\n00:23:41.452 --> 00:23:44.185\nI can set it to be smaller,\nmaybe I just want to create a 500GB drive,\n\n523\n00:23:44.185 --> 00:23:47.164\nthat'll leave some extra room,\ni could create another storage space with.\n\n524\n00:23:47.164 --> 00:23:51.889\nBut you can actually set it to be Bigger\nthan the pool capacity, all right.\n\n525\n00:23:51.889 --> 00:23:54.660\nI can set it to three terabytes.\n\n526\n00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:57.070\nNow why would they let me\nset it to three terabytes,\n\n527\n00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:59.970\nif I don't actually have three terabytes\nand I can't make it redundant?\n\n528\n00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:03.530\nWell, as it starts to fill up,\nI might wanna come and\n\n529\n00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:05.360\nadd more hard drives later on.\n\n530\n00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:09.680\nAnd you can add hard drives to the pool\nand now it can grow to three terabytes.\n\n531\n00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.750\nAnd I don't have to change my system,\nI just add the drives.\n\n532\n00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:15.291\nAnd it will do it automatically, right,\nso that's kind of a neat feature.\n\n533\n00:24:15.291 --> 00:24:19.719\nVersus if I set it to that\n766 it was defaulting to, or\n\n534\n00:24:19.719 --> 00:24:23.689\n670, whatever it was defaulting to, right?\n\n535\n00:24:23.689 --> 00:24:27.291\nThen at that point, if I add more drives,\nI'm gonna have to go and\n\n536\n00:24:27.291 --> 00:24:31.040\nexpand that partition, and\nthat's gonna require some work.\n\n537\n00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.560\nSo we can set it to be bigger.\n\n538\n00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.140\nI'll set mine to, well, I don't wanna\ndo three terabytes, that's too big.\n\n539\n00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.780\nLet's just say it's one terabyte,\n\n540\n00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:39.930\nwhich is bigger than the actual\nspace that's available.\n\n541\n00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:43.676\nAll right, now if I actually eat up\nall that space, it's going to act\n\n542\n00:24:43.676 --> 00:24:47.292\nlike the drive is full even though\nit thinks that its got more room so\n\n543\n00:24:47.292 --> 00:24:49.372\nit is smart enough to recognize that.\n\n544\n00:24:49.372 --> 00:24:52.343\nBut we can create it and put it in place,\nor, you know, if I want to put it back to\n\n545\n00:24:52.343 --> 00:24:55.335\nthe default, I think I can just switch\noff, it's not going to remember is it?\n\n546\n00:24:55.335 --> 00:24:56.676\nAll right, let me just drop it back.\n\n547\n00:24:56.676 --> 00:25:00.459\nAll right, so now I'm back,\nI'm healthy, things should be good,\n\n548\n00:25:00.459 --> 00:25:05.419\nactually it's saying my specified maximum,\noh 766 terabytes is pretty impressive,\n\n549\n00:25:05.419 --> 00:25:09.950\nlet me change that back down to gigabytes,\nwe'll get that created.\n\n550\n00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:14.980\nAll right, it's gonna build the storage\nspace for me and it's gonna format it.\n\n551\n00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:19.380\nAnd now that it's done, when I browse\nto my explorer, what do I see?\n\n552\n00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:22.180\nA 760 gig iDrive, all right.\n\n553\n00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:25.240\nAs an end user,\nthat's a normal hard drive to me.\n\n554\n00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.290\nI don't treat it any different,\nit's my iDrive.\n\n555\n00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:29.530\nI can browse through,\nI can put data in there.\n\n556\n00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:32.800\nAnd any time I write data in there,\nWindows in the background is saying,\n\n557\n00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.130\nlet me make a second copy of this.\n\n558\n00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:35.470\nIt's making a duplicate.\n\n559\n00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:38.040\nAnd that way if one hard drive fails,\nI'll survive.\n\n560\n00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:41.420\nAnd if hard drive fails, I'll still have\nmy iDrive, and I can browse right into it,\n\n561\n00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.510\nit'll still be 760 gigs,\nI'll can still get at my data.\n\n562\n00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:48.360\nRight, the end user doesn't\nnecessarily see this anymore, but\n\n563\n00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.310\nwe get the benefit of it.\n\n564\n00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.975\nAnd you can monitor the health right\nback here in the storage spaces panel,\n\n565\n00:25:52.975 --> 00:25:54.940\nI'll see my storage space is healthy.\n\n566\n00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:58.675\nLooks like everything is up, and I can see\nthe physical discs that are involved in it\n\n567\n00:25:58.675 --> 00:26:02.325\nif one of them has failed I'll see\nwhich one and be able to take action.\n\n568\n00:26:02.325 --> 00:26:06.685\nSo all that's right there, storage spaces\nare a type of local storage just like\n\n569\n00:26:06.685 --> 00:26:09.103\na regular hard drive,\nthey're just redundant.\n\n570\n00:26:09.103 --> 00:26:11.256\nAnd they're kind of\nMicrosoft proprietary too so\n\n571\n00:26:11.256 --> 00:26:14.948\nwe're really just gonna work inside of\nthe Microsoft environment but that's fine,\n\n572\n00:26:14.948 --> 00:26:18.191\nif you're on a Windows system you can\nuse these, it really does work well.\n\n573\n00:26:18.191 --> 00:26:21.883\n>> I love the fact that you can have\nall those drives in one spot but\n\n574\n00:26:21.883 --> 00:26:24.513\nit only shows up as one\ndrive to the end user.\n\n575\n00:26:24.513 --> 00:26:28.501\nYou have that whole experience of,\noh did I put that on the F drive or\n\n576\n00:26:28.501 --> 00:26:31.610\nthe I drive or the J drive,\nI don't remember.\n\n577\n00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:35.150\nSo, taking that large capacity,\nputting it on One Drive.\n\n578\n00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:38.270\nAnd of course if you have the redundancy\nbuilt in there, it's also a nice feature.\n\n579\n00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:39.230\nHaving that One Drive,\n\n580\n00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:43.055\nI've noticed with my users, they tend\nto appreciate that a little more.\n\n581\n00:26:43.055 --> 00:26:44.010\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n582\n00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.280\nEven if you have to pay to\nget that extra storage,\n\n583\n00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:50.170\nI appreciate One Drive just because\nMicrosoft worries about that redundancy.\n\n584\n00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:52.580\nIf a drive fails,\nthey're the ones who have to fix it.\n\n585\n00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:54.280\nIt's not me going and ordering a drive.\n\n586\n00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.270\nThey take care of it.\n\n587\n00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:56.510\nThere's a benefit to that, and\n\n588\n00:26:56.510 --> 00:27:00.280\nif it costs you a few bucks a year,\nit's worth it to me not to worry about it.\n\n589\n00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:03.910\nBut, if you've got data that can't go to\nthe cloud, just huge volumes of it or\n\n590\n00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:04.890\nit's private data or\n\n591\n00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:08.240\nwhatever, something like Storage Spaces\ncan really solve that problem for you.\n\n592\n00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.580\nSo, great options that are available for\nus there.\n\n593\n00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:11.190\nRight?\n\n594\n00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:15.760\nNow, on one of the slides, I had a chance\nto pick what file system I wanted to use.\n\n595\n00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.870\nAnd, I want to talk about each of\nthose because they are on the exam,\n\n596\n00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:18.940\nthey're important to know.\n\n597\n00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:22.010\nBut we're kinda out of time for this\nsegment, so I'll tackle that in part two.\n\n598\n00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:25.360\nThere's a few other bits and pieces\nabout storage that we want to address.\n\n599\n00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:29.030\nBut this is probably a good spot for\nus to kind of wrap this up.\n\n600\n00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:32.500\nBut definitely stay tuned for part two,\nwhere we'll jump into those files systems,\n\n601\n00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:36.590\nand kinda see what the differences between\neach one, and how they handle their data.\n\n602\n00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:38.090\n>> All right, excellent stuff Don.\n\n603\n00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:39.645\nThanks for watching everyone.\n\n604\n00:27:39.645 --> 00:27:41.565\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTv,\n\n605\n00:27:41.565 --> 00:27:43.056\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n606\n00:27:43.056 --> 00:27:43.915\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n607\n00:27:43.915 --> 00:27:45.018\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n608\n00:27:45.018 --> 00:27:52.090\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.323 --> 00:00:18.006\nI'll be your host Daniel Lawry.\n\n4\n00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:20.084\nHere with me, as always, Mr Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:20.084 --> 00:00:21.110\nHow's it going Don?\n\n6\n00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.190\n>> It is going great Daniel.\n\n7\n00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.540\nI'm excited to be back on the show.\n\n8\n00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.500\nAnd jumping in to part two\nof our storage episode.\n\n9\n00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.990\nFor those of you who have been hanging\non to the edge of your seat after that\n\n10\n00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.340\ncliffhanger, the exciting\nconclusion is here.\n\n11\n00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.295\nSo fret no more.\n\n12\n00:00:34.295 --> 00:00:37.130\n[LAUGH] If you haven't watched it,\nthe previous episode.\n\n13\n00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.630\nWe got a chance to take a look at local\nstorage, cloud storage, and, well storage\n\n14\n00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.280\nspaces all inside of Windows 8, different\nways of storing your data on the system.\n\n15\n00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.278\nAnd one thing that we touched on super\nbriefly, but really didn't get into,\n\n16\n00:00:50.278 --> 00:00:53.420\nwere the different file\nsystems that were available.\n\n17\n00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.820\nSo, inside of Windows,\nwhen you use a hard drive,\n\n18\n00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.040\nwe have to tell Windows how we want\nto store the data on the drive.\n\n19\n00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.820\nIf you think about it, a file is\nbroken up into ones and zeros, right?\n\n20\n00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.130\nThere are like binary bits inside of it,\nright?\n\n21\n00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.160\nAnd so every file, you might see a\npicture, or you might see a document, but\n\n22\n00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.920\na computer sees a string of ones and\nzeroes.\n\n23\n00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.770\nAnd it has to write those ones and\nzeroes to the hard drive.\n\n24\n00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.720\nAnd the hard drive is\nusually magnetic media.\n\n25\n00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.780\nIt could be SSD,\nwhich is a little different, but\n\n26\n00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.250\nit's usually magnetic media.\n\n27\n00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.610\nAnd so it's got to write these ones and\n\n28\n00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.820\nzeros to that media so\nthat it can go and recall.\n\n29\n00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.680\nWell, in order for it to find\nwhere your data is, in order for\n\n30\n00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.290\nit to retrieve the data and get it back\nfor us, it has to have a way to locate it.\n\n31\n00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.850\nIt has to have a way to know how\nthe data is written to the disk\n\n32\n00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.350\nso it can get it back.\n\n33\n00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.154\nAnd over the years, different operating\nsystem vendors have found different ways\n\n34\n00:01:47.154 --> 00:01:51.974\nto do it, so on a Windows machine, data is\nstored one of a couple of different ways.\n\n35\n00:01:51.974 --> 00:01:53.940\nIn the Linux world,\nyou've got a good eight or\n\n36\n00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.470\nnine different file systems\nthat can be used there.\n\n37\n00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.840\nIn the Apple world, you have two or three\ndifferent file systems that can be used.\n\n38\n00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.140\nAnd they're all different,\nthey're all separate.\n\n39\n00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.680\nSo, Windows can't necessarily\nread an Apple drive, and\n\n40\n00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.370\nan Apple machine can't necessarily\nread a Linux drive, and so on.\n\n41\n00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.500\nBut there are a lot that are compatible,\nwhere they can read each others drives,\n\n42\n00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.130\nand that's pretty cool stuff.\n\n43\n00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.240\nSo, we wanna make sure we take advantage\nof the right file system for us, so\n\n44\n00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.360\nwhen you get a new hard drive and you go\nto format is, to get it ready, right?\n\n45\n00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.670\nWe need to make some choices.\n\n46\n00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.346\nNow, that word format,\na lot of people throw that word around and\n\n47\n00:02:27.346 --> 00:02:29.107\ndon't necessarily know what that means.\n\n48\n00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:32.020\nWhen we say we format a drive,\nwhat pops in to your mind?\n\n49\n00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.960\nWell, people think of erasing the drive.\n\n50\n00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.930\nWell, I wanna format it,\nthat means I'm want to erase it.\n\n51\n00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.180\nAnd that would be true, right?\n\n52\n00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.860\nIf you format a drive you\nare going to erase it.\n\n53\n00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.700\nBut what you're really doing\nwhen you format a drive,\n\n54\n00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.060\nis you're laying on it\nwhat's called a file system.\n\n55\n00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.449\nAnd the file system is usually\nmade of two parts, okay?\n\n56\n00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:51.394\nThe first part is your data, your data,\n\n57\n00:02:51.394 --> 00:02:54.945\nwhen you save that document,\nyou save that picture, you save whatever,\n\n58\n00:02:54.945 --> 00:02:59.170\nit's gotta be written to the hard drive\nsomewhere, that's your data, right?\n\n59\n00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.850\nAnd so\nthat's going on top of this file system.\n\n60\n00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.310\nAnd on the other part,\nis the information about your file.\n\n61\n00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.528\nEvery file has information.\n\n62\n00:03:08.528 --> 00:03:09.420\nIt's something, right?\n\n63\n00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.250\nIt has a file name at a minimum,\nyou can't have a file without a file name.\n\n64\n00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.906\nSo you got a file name.\n\n65\n00:03:13.906 --> 00:03:14.570\nIts got a size,\n\n66\n00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.590\nits got a date that it was modified,\nits got a date that it was created.\n\n67\n00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.120\nThese are things that we\nneed to know about a file.\n\n68\n00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.626\nOn some advanced file systems,\n\n69\n00:03:23.626 --> 00:03:27.097\nyou have all sorts of crazy things\nlike permissions or metadata, right?\n\n70\n00:03:27.097 --> 00:03:31.500\nThink about a MP3 where it has who\nthe artist was and the album and all that.\n\n71\n00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.210\nThat's information about your file.\n\n72\n00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.800\nSome file systems can store that data,\nsome file systems can't.\n\n73\n00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.420\nSo in the example of music, most file\nsystems don't know if you have music or\n\n74\n00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.220\nnot and so that music metadata is\nstored in the music file itself.\n\n75\n00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.310\nBut, a file name.\n\n76\n00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.870\nEvery file has a file name.\n\n77\n00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.800\nSo when you create a file system,\nit creates a special little place,\n\n78\n00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.340\nlike a database, usually it's right\nat the beginning of the drive.\n\n79\n00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.160\nAnd it says, I'm gonna create\na list of all the file names that\n\n80\n00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.690\nare on this system.\n\n81\n00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.194\nAnd if you have directories, like folders,\nthose folders aren't real, they don't\n\n82\n00:04:05.194 --> 00:04:08.703\nactually exist anywhere inside of the hard\ndrive, they're just kind of references.\n\n83\n00:04:08.703 --> 00:04:12.337\nAnd it says, I'm gonna say there's\nthis folder, and inside of it,\n\n84\n00:04:12.337 --> 00:04:14.020\nthere's these files.\n\n85\n00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.020\nAnd each file has a pointer\n\n86\n00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.900\nto somewhere on the hard drive\nwhere the actual data is stored.\n\n87\n00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.020\nSo, how is that structured,\nhow is that database structured,\n\n88\n00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.660\nhow is the data written to the hard drive?\n\n89\n00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.980\nHow do we find it retrieve it and\nchange it?\n\n90\n00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.340\nThat's what your file system dictates.\n\n91\n00:04:30.778 --> 00:04:33.431\nNow, to kinda understand\nwhere we are today,\n\n92\n00:04:33.431 --> 00:04:37.989\nwe're gonna need to jump back in time a\nbit, kinda go back to the beginning of how\n\n93\n00:04:37.989 --> 00:04:42.982\nfile systems were way back in the 1980s\nwhen Microsoft really started to push DOS.\n\n94\n00:04:42.982 --> 00:04:47.444\nIn early versions of DOS and Windows,\nwe just had one file system and\n\n95\n00:04:47.444 --> 00:04:50.809\nthat was it, and\nit was called the FAT file system,\n\n96\n00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:54.510\nwhich stand for\nFile Allocation Table, right?\n\n97\n00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.798\nMicrosoft named it after that database.\n\n98\n00:04:56.798 --> 00:04:58.740\nThe database is the file allocation table,\n\n99\n00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.420\nit's a table that was all the files and\ntheir allocated space, right?\n\n100\n00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.210\nThe files, that's the file names,\nand then their allocated space.\n\n101\n00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.372\nThat's where on the hard drive we\ncan go to find the industry of\n\n102\n00:05:08.372 --> 00:05:09.171\nthe data, all right?\n\n103\n00:05:09.171 --> 00:05:12.660\nSo they created this table and\nthis structure.\n\n104\n00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.730\nAnd they said,\nokay we're gonna release this.\n\n105\n00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.000\nThis one's actually open.\n\n106\n00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.580\nSo that any vendor can support it.\n\n107\n00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.050\nAnd Apple did and Linux does too.\n\n108\n00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.900\nThey all support FAT.\n\n109\n00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.150\nFAT's very compatible.\n\n110\n00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.390\nAnd they can read that table, find that\ndata, retrieve it, write new data to it.\n\n111\n00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.814\nFull compatibility,\nit's a good file system, all right?\n\n112\n00:05:27.814 --> 00:05:32.380\nBut it's got a couple little problems,\nall right?\n\n113\n00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.220\nThe first problem with that,\nis that it's not very resilient.\n\n114\n00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.280\nIt has no redundancy in it whatsoever.\n\n115\n00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.430\nIf you lose power on your system, and\n\n116\n00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.820\nyou're in the middle of writing a file to\nthe hard drive, that file's now corrupt.\n\n117\n00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.160\nThat's it, it's corrupt.\n\n118\n00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.448\nSo you gotta make sure you save and\n\n119\n00:05:47.448 --> 00:05:49.970\nclose all your files before\nyou turn off the computer.\n\n120\n00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.060\nIt's not very good about that,\nit can get corrupt pretty easy.\n\n121\n00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.309\nSo, with FAT systems,\nyou've gotta back them up a lot, right?\n\n122\n00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:58.250\nYou gotta be safe with your data.\n\n123\n00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.950\nIt's not very resilient.\n\n124\n00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.460\nThe other limitation though\nis just the table itself.\n\n125\n00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.970\nThe file allocation table.\n\n126\n00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.930\nWhen Microsoft built that table,\nthis was a different time, right?\n\n127\n00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.117\nThat can be 80s, you might've\nheard me mention in an episode,\n\n128\n00:06:12.117 --> 00:06:13.497\nmy first hard drive.\n\n129\n00:06:13.497 --> 00:06:14.739\nI had an IBM PC Junior.\n\n130\n00:06:14.739 --> 00:06:16.016\nIt had a 20 megabyte hard drive in it.\n\n131\n00:06:16.016 --> 00:06:20.672\nThat 20 megabyte hard drive at the time,\nto me, that was massive.\n\n132\n00:06:20.672 --> 00:06:23.411\nDo you know how many floppy\ndrives will fit on 20 megabytes?\n\n133\n00:06:23.411 --> 00:06:26.270\nThat's like, what is it, 12 floppy discs?\n\n134\n00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.190\n>> Yeah, it's quite a few.\n\n135\n00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.730\n>> And, back then, I was jonesing just\nto have two floppy drives in my system.\n\n136\n00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.661\nBut to be able to store 12 floppy\ndisks right there in one drive,\n\n137\n00:06:33.661 --> 00:06:35.550\nthat blew my mind, right?\n\n138\n00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.250\nAnd so, that's the type of data\nwe were dealing with back then.\n\n139\n00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.720\n20 megabytes.\n\n140\n00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.730\nLet's put this in kinda terms\nthat we can reference today.\n\n141\n00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.470\nSo, Daniel, if you were to take a,\n\n142\n00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:53.330\nlet's say you were to go to iTunes or\ndoes Microsoft sell music anymore?\n\n143\n00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.171\n>> Yeah, I don't know.\n\n144\n00:06:54.171 --> 00:06:55.751\n>> It's a Microsoft show, we should\nprobably talk about a Microsoft product.\n\n145\n00:06:55.751 --> 00:06:58.012\n>> Whatever-\n>> A Microsoft product that sells music,\n\n146\n00:06:58.012 --> 00:06:58.792\nwe'll go there [LAUGH].\n\n147\n00:06:58.792 --> 00:07:00.231\n>> If you go to Zoom.\n\n148\n00:07:00.231 --> 00:07:03.224\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Anyhow, so if you go and\n\n149\n00:07:03.224 --> 00:07:07.956\nbuy an MP3 online, what do think\nthe average size of an MP3 is these days?\n\n150\n00:07:07.956 --> 00:07:10.180\n>> Oh, it's probably three or four megs.\n\n151\n00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.270\n>> Three or four megs?\n\n152\n00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.834\nLet's go even a little higher.\n\n153\n00:07:11.834 --> 00:07:12.577\nLet's just say five megs.\n\n154\n00:07:12.577 --> 00:07:14.560\n>> Okay.\n>> Maybe get the high quality one.\n\n155\n00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.568\nEasy math, right?\n>> Yeah.\n\n156\n00:07:15.568 --> 00:07:16.787\n>> Five, [LAUGH] it's easier than three.\n\n157\n00:07:16.787 --> 00:07:19.829\nSo let's say your average MP3\nis five megs in size, okay?\n\n158\n00:07:19.829 --> 00:07:23.640\nA 20 megabyte hard drive,\nI can hold four songs.\n\n159\n00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.340\nThat's pretty awesome, isn't it?\n\n160\n00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.953\nNo, it's a terrible hard drive, right?\n\n161\n00:07:26.953 --> 00:07:28.068\nIt's super small, right?\n\n162\n00:07:28.068 --> 00:07:30.170\nBut I want to put it in\ntoday's perspective.\n\n163\n00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:33.290\nBack then,\nthat was a massive amount of data.\n\n164\n00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.790\nAnd so, when they created this\ntable structure, they created it so\n\n165\n00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.230\nthat it can handle data large enough for\n\n166\n00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:43.840\nsomething that was considered\nan insane size back then, okay?\n\n167\n00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.590\nUnfortunately, an insane size back\nthen was four gigabytes, okay?\n\n168\n00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:49.590\nFour gigabytes.\n\n169\n00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:53.065\nNow, if I had a 20-megabyte drive, right?\n\n170\n00:07:53.065 --> 00:07:58.580\n1 megabyte, it takes 1,000\nmegabytes to equal a gigabyte.\n\n171\n00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.254\nAnd they're gonna give me 2,000 megabytes,\nbasically.\n\n172\n00:08:02.254 --> 00:08:04.400\nOr I'm sorry, 4,000 megabytes.\n\n173\n00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.927\nFour gigs of data in\na file allocation table.\n\n174\n00:08:06.927 --> 00:08:10.750\nThe idea of having a four gigabyte\nhard drive back then was unheard of.\n\n175\n00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.920\nAnd so the thought that\ntable would be good enough.\n\n176\n00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.910\nBut today, one DVD,\na crappy DVD is four gigs.\n\n177\n00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:21.638\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> A quality DVD is nine gigs of data.\n\n178\n00:08:21.638 --> 00:08:22.316\nRight?\n\n179\n00:08:22.316 --> 00:08:25.920\nA Blu-ray disc is going to\nbe 30 to 40 gigs of data.\n\n180\n00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.690\nSo, back then four gigs was massive.\n\n181\n00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:29.409\nToday it's not.\n\n182\n00:08:29.409 --> 00:08:35.780\nSo FAT, that file system, had a limitation\nof a four gigabyte partition size.\n\n183\n00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.430\nSo if I have a drive letter that refers\nto a drive it can't be any larger\n\n184\n00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:41.150\nthan four gigabytes.\n\n185\n00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:46.330\nAnd then the files inside of it,\nthey had a limit too, two gigabytes.\n\n186\n00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.490\nI couldn't have one file\nover two gigabytes in size.\n\n187\n00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:50.650\nNow back then,\n\n188\n00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:55.150\nthey didn't think anybody would have\nany files over two gigabytes in size.\n\n189\n00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:59.420\nWell, if we rip an mp3,\nit's gonna be five megabytes.\n\n190\n00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.270\nSo it's gonna fit in that range.\n\n191\n00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:06.210\nBut if I have a DVD, or\ndownload software from the internet, or\n\n192\n00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.100\nwhatever, there's plenty of times where it\nwould be greater than two gigs in size.\n\n193\n00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.860\nIf you work in video editing or\nanything like that,\n\n194\n00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:17.375\nyou'll have these large files, FAT can't\nhandle that, file allocation table can't.\n\n195\n00:09:17.375 --> 00:09:21.215\nSo over the years,\nMicrosoft recognized that limitation.\n\n196\n00:09:21.215 --> 00:09:25.265\nAnd so they released a new\nfile system to replace it, and\n\n197\n00:09:25.265 --> 00:09:27.235\nit was called FAT32, right?\n\n198\n00:09:27.235 --> 00:09:32.365\nFAT32 is file allocation table, but they\nincreased the address space inside of that\n\n199\n00:09:32.365 --> 00:09:35.250\ntable to 32 bits, so\nit became a 32-bit file system.\n\n200\n00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:38.470\nAnd when that happened, that made it\nwhere it could handle bigger stuff.\n\n201\n00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:39.590\nRight?\n\n202\n00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:41.340\nBut it's kinda the same as FAT.\n\n203\n00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:45.360\nThey made it big enough for files that\nwere considered gigantic at the time.\n\n204\n00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.980\nAll right?\n\n205\n00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.770\nSo with FAT32 which is still pretty\nwidely used today because it's so\n\n206\n00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:50.860\ncompatible, right?\n\n207\n00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:55.290\nFAT32, again, it can be read by Linux,\nby Apple stuff, by Windows, right?\n\n208\n00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.050\nVery flexible, very compatible.\n\n209\n00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:58.880\nSo a lot of people do like to use it.\n\n210\n00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:03.700\nYou see SD cards, if you buy an SD card\ntoday, odds are it's formatted FAT32,\n\n211\n00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.100\nthat's how most of them\nship from the factory\n\n212\n00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:09.250\njust because it is compatible\nwith everything, right?\n\n213\n00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.280\nBut it's got limitations.\n\n214\n00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.920\nSo on FAT,\nwe had a four gig partition size, or\n\n215\n00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:20.600\nfour gig hard drive size basically,\nwe had a two gig file size limitation.\n\n216\n00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:27.020\nWith that 32 those numbers bump up a bit,\nright, to a two terabyte partition size.\n\n217\n00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.950\nRight.\nPretty big, two terabytes,\n\n218\n00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.920\nthat's gonna be a pretty\ngiant chunk of data.\n\n219\n00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:37.690\nA gigabyte is a thousand megabytes,\na terabyte is a thousand gigabytes, okay?\n\n220\n00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:41.680\nSo that's the type of data we're looking\nat here, a thousand gigabytes of data\n\n221\n00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.190\ninside of that terabyte drive,\nthat's a lot of space.\n\n222\n00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.831\nMost computers, like my computer right\nhere only has a 512 gig drive in it,\n\n223\n00:10:47.831 --> 00:10:50.276\nI don't even have a terabyte\ndrive in this machine.\n\n224\n00:10:50.276 --> 00:10:54.225\nSo that's pretty big,\nFAT32's gonna last forever, right?\n\n225\n00:10:54.225 --> 00:10:56.570\nBut FAT32 had a limitation also.\n\n226\n00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:01.520\nIndividual files can't be over 4 gigs, all\nright, it's got that four gig file setup,\n\n227\n00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.340\nwe had two gigs under FAT,\nfour gigs under FAT32, right?\n\n228\n00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.920\nNow I work with files\nover four gigs in size,\n\n229\n00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.390\nI don't have a two terabyte hard drive.\n\n230\n00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:12.180\nI don't have a one terabyte hard drive,\nbut I do have files over four gigs.\n\n231\n00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:15.578\nI have virtual machines that\nexceed that by quite a bit.\n\n232\n00:11:15.578 --> 00:11:18.677\nAnd so FAT32 is not so suitable.\n\n233\n00:11:18.677 --> 00:11:21.285\nIt's also relatively unstable,\nlike on a laptop it's a bad idea,\n\n234\n00:11:21.285 --> 00:11:24.300\nbecause you loose power or\nsomething, you get disk corruption.\n\n235\n00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.600\nSo FAT32 has got it's weaknesses,\nall right.\n\n236\n00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:29.570\nBut those are kind of the original\nfile systems for Microsoft.\n\n237\n00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:32.560\nAnd you still see those\nsupported even in Windows 8,\n\n238\n00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.580\nbecause of things like SD cards and\nother systems.\n\n239\n00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:39.990\nNow let's talk a little\nbit about the replacement.\n\n240\n00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:44.900\nSo the replacement came around in\nthe mid 1990s, and that was NTFS, right?\n\n241\n00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:50.630\nNow, NTFS, the name is a little bit weird,\nbecause it was created for Windows NT,\n\n242\n00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:52.470\nand Windows NT stood for\nWindows New Technology.\n\n243\n00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:55.380\nAnd back in the 90s it was new technology.\n\n244\n00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:59.040\nToday, 20 years later,\n30 years later not new so much.\n\n245\n00:11:59.040 --> 00:11:59.812\n>> Feeling its age.\n\n246\n00:11:59.812 --> 00:12:00.727\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so\n\n247\n00:12:00.727 --> 00:12:05.270\nthe acronym's kind of pointless, but\nit's the New Technology File System, NTFS.\n\n248\n00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:07.190\nAnd it was introduced back in Windows NT,\n\n249\n00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:10.150\nwhich most of you guys have\nprobably never run, but\n\n250\n00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:14.580\nwe saw it kinda enter the mainstream\nwith Windows 2000 and Windows XP.\n\n251\n00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:17.250\nSo Windows XP defaulted to NTFS.\n\n252\n00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:21.340\nWindows Vista, Windows 7,\nWindows 8 they all default to NTFS.\n\n253\n00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.630\nEven Windows 10 defaults to NTFS.\n\n254\n00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:28.150\nSo for most of you guys watching the show,\nyou're probably running NTFS, all right?\n\n255\n00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:30.790\nAnd NTFS did two things for us, all right?\n\n256\n00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:33.120\nFirst off, it's a lot more resilient.\n\n257\n00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.610\nIf it loses power in the middle of\nwriting data, you might actually end up\n\n258\n00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:39.170\nwith some file corruption, but\nyou won't end up with drive corruption.\n\n259\n00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:42.450\nIt's a lot more stable, right,\nit can scale a lot larger.\n\n260\n00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:44.470\nIt's just a lot more reliable.\n\n261\n00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.085\nAnd so Microsoft rolled it out on\ntheir server products first and\n\n262\n00:12:47.085 --> 00:12:49.260\nthen it kind of worked over\nto our desktops, right.\n\n263\n00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.570\nBut it's perfectly suited for\ndesktops too.\n\n264\n00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:59.460\nIt, on a second note, brings larger\nfile sizes, larger partitions and files.\n\n265\n00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:02.780\nSo with NTFS, this is where it\nstarts to get a little weird.\n\n266\n00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:07.010\nYour maximum drive size is 16 exabytes.\n\n267\n00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:07.718\nAll right?\nOr EBs.\n\n268\n00:13:07.718 --> 00:13:08.329\n>> I have eczema.\n\n269\n00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:11.280\n[LAUGH]\n>> The drives itch.\n\n270\n00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.140\nSo it's 16 exabytes.\n\n271\n00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:17.950\nNow, most of you have heard of gigabytes,\nmost of you have heard of terabytes, but\n\n272\n00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:19.605\nexabytes are something you\nprobably haven't heard of.\n\n273\n00:13:19.605 --> 00:13:20.395\nRight?\nSo let's try and\n\n274\n00:13:20.395 --> 00:13:21.565\nput this into some kind of reference.\n\n275\n00:13:22.705 --> 00:13:27.450\nI said that, let's see,\nwhat's a good way to reference this?\n\n276\n00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:32.220\nSo if I have, well, it's 16 exabytes, or\n\n277\n00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:36.940\none exabyte is a thousand terabytes.\n\n278\n00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:43.750\nSo if I have a 16 exabyte system,\nI could store 16,000 terabytes of data.\n\n279\n00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:45.190\nThat's a lot of data, all right?\n\n280\n00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:48.670\nThere's very few people in this world\nthat have that much data right now.\n\n281\n00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:51.390\nI'm not sure if anybody\nhas 16 exabytes of data.\n\n282\n00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:52.880\nIt's massive, okay?\n\n283\n00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.330\nIt's a massive amount of data.\n\n284\n00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:57.586\nIf you go back to that example of\nan MP3 being five megabytes in size,\n\n285\n00:13:57.586 --> 00:13:58.950\n16 exabytes is huge.\n\n286\n00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:01.630\nAnd so Microsoft did the same\nthing they did before.\n\n287\n00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:05.665\nThey picked a file size that was\nconsidered massive for the time.\n\n288\n00:14:05.665 --> 00:14:08.760\nAnd at this time, 16 exabytes,\nthat's pretty big, right.\n\n289\n00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.010\nBut it won't always be, right.\n\n290\n00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:13.400\nComing down the line,\nwe're gonna get into a situation,\n\n291\n00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.690\nprobably in another ten years,\nwhere 16 exabytes, we're laughing at it.\n\n292\n00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:19.630\nWe're like, agh,\nmy cell phone's only got 16 exabytes.\n\n293\n00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:20.770\nI should of got the better one.\n\n294\n00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:22.110\nAnd then you gotta upgrade.\n\n295\n00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.030\nI shouldn't of got the cheap phone.\n\n296\n00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.010\nSo, that'll happen, right?\n\n297\n00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.600\nAnd so we have to remember that with NTFS.\n\n298\n00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.590\nIt's great now.\n\n299\n00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:32.480\nIt'll go huge, right, but\nit does have that limitation.\n\n300\n00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.900\nSo 16 exabytes for\n\n301\n00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:39.150\nthe drive size and then individual file\nsizes they get to be a little bit big.\n\n302\n00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:43.050\nWe get, let's see, it is, I gotta\ncheat here a little bit on this one.\n\n303\n00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:48.150\nOh, it is, I had to cheat because\nthere's no file system limit.\n\n304\n00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.320\nWhen you create a file,\nit can be as big as you want.\n\n305\n00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.530\nIt's limited by the drive size.\n\n306\n00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:55.120\nSo if I have 16 exabyte drive,\n\n307\n00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.420\nI could have one file that\nwas 16 exabytes in size.\n\n308\n00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.200\nThat's pretty impressive, right?\n\n309\n00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.800\nMassive.\nSo they kind of got rid of that file size\n\n310\n00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:02.330\nlimitation.\n\n311\n00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.130\nThat's a big difference with NTFS.\n\n312\n00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:05.810\nSo, 16 exabytes.\n\n313\n00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:09.630\nAnd, even Microsoft will say,\nif you truly have 16 exabytes of storage,\n\n314\n00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:10.890\nthey haven't really tested it that far.\n\n315\n00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:12.920\nIt's kind of like a theoretical\nmaximum for them.\n\n316\n00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.020\nBut I think they've tested\nit up to two exabytes.\n\n317\n00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:18.240\nSo, either way,\nit's a huge amount of data.\n\n318\n00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:24.240\nNow the biggest problem with NTFS,\nit is not very compatible.\n\n319\n00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.395\nMicrosoft created it,\nthey wanted it just for them.\n\n320\n00:15:26.395 --> 00:15:30.430\nThey've said other people could license\nit, but no nobody has licensed it.\n\n321\n00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:32.030\nNobody wants to pay Microsoft for it.\n\n322\n00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:38.220\nSo Apple and Linux systems, they can\nread NTFS, but they can't write to it.\n\n323\n00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.490\nThey can't write to it because\nthey haven't licensed it and\n\n324\n00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:42.940\nthat would be them using the technology\nand it would corrupt the disc.\n\n325\n00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:43.630\nRight?\n\n326\n00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:44.820\nOr they'd have to pay licensing.\n\n327\n00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:45.810\nOne or the other.\n\n328\n00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:46.410\nSo they don't.\n\n329\n00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:50.760\nSo Apple and Linux, they can read NTFS but\nthey can't write to it.\n\n330\n00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.930\nWindows machines can read and\nwrite to it all day long.\n\n331\n00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:54.410\nRight?\nIt's a great file system.\n\n332\n00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:56.380\nIt's what most of us\nare going to default to.\n\n333\n00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:57.050\nRight.\n\n334\n00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:02.592\nNow, what happens when the day\ncomes that 16 exabytes is nothing?\n\n335\n00:16:02.592 --> 00:16:05.618\n16 exabytes is tiny, and\nwe're complaining cuz our cell phones, and\n\n336\n00:16:05.618 --> 00:16:08.505\nI'm saying hey Daniel,\ncan I borrow your 16 exabyte thumb drive?\n\n337\n00:16:08.505 --> 00:16:12.324\nAnd you give it to me, and I hook it up\nAnd he's telling me about the deal he got\n\n338\n00:16:12.324 --> 00:16:15.336\non them for $12 a piece on Amazon,\nor whatever, right?\n\n339\n00:16:15.336 --> 00:16:17.660\nWhen that day comes,\nwe need something bigger.\n\n340\n00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:21.330\nAnd Microsoft is already working\non that something bigger.\n\n341\n00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:24.135\nYou'll see little hints of it\nspread throughout Windows, but\n\n342\n00:16:24.135 --> 00:16:25.885\nit's not ready for prime time yet.\n\n343\n00:16:25.885 --> 00:16:26.945\nBut it is on the MTA exam.\n\n344\n00:16:27.985 --> 00:16:32.765\nThey have a new file system called\nthe Resilient File System, or ReFS.\n\n345\n00:16:34.345 --> 00:16:39.010\nReFS, the Resilient File System\nis the replacement for NTFS.\n\n346\n00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:43.250\nAnd what it's designed to do\nis to scale much larger and\n\n347\n00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:45.780\nto have resiliency or\njournaling built into it.\n\n348\n00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:47.260\nNow, what is journaling?\n\n349\n00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:52.300\nJournaling says, when I write to the hard\ndrive, I don't write to the actual file.\n\n350\n00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.150\nI write to a different place and\n\n351\n00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:58.210\nonly when I'm 100% done do I\nactually write to the file.\n\n352\n00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:00.380\nSo that means if I lose power\nhalf way through a write,\n\n353\n00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:02.780\nthe original file's still intact.\n\n354\n00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:04.030\nSo when I bring it back up,\n\n355\n00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:06.790\nI don't have disk corruption\nwhich is what FAT32 got us.\n\n356\n00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:10.290\nOr NTFS got that sorry, but\nalso don't have file corruption.\n\n357\n00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:11.900\nIt gives me full resiliency.\n\n358\n00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:15.460\nReFS is very protective of that and it has\nsome other technologies built into it to\n\n359\n00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:19.570\nprovide redundancy and other things, so\nReFS is very powerful from that respect.\n\n360\n00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:27.830\nAnd they've sized it for data that's\nconsidered absurd for the future.\n\n361\n00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:32.457\nAnd so basically it's,\nthis is where it gets really odd.\n\n362\n00:17:32.457 --> 00:17:38.296\nA maximum volume size of one yottabyte,\na yottabyte, a yb.\n\n363\n00:17:38.296 --> 00:17:42.456\nNow, you might familiar with gigabyte or\ngbs,\n\n364\n00:17:42.456 --> 00:17:47.150\nterabytes, tbs, exabytes ebs, a yottabyte.\n\n365\n00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:52.210\nNow, for each of these,\na terabyte is 1000 gigabytes.\n\n366\n00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.970\nAn exabyte is 1000 terabytes.\n\n367\n00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:01.480\nBut a yottabyte is far\nbigger than 1000 exabytes.\n\n368\n00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:09.280\nA yottabyte is actually 1 billion,\nbillion with a b, 1 billion terabytes.\n\n369\n00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:09.920\nMassive.\n\n370\n00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.917\nOr 1 million exabytes.\n\n371\n00:18:11.917 --> 00:18:14.494\nIt's huge.\n\n372\n00:18:14.494 --> 00:18:18.800\nAnd what they're saying is, ten years\nfrom now, a yottabyte is gonna be\n\n373\n00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:22.551\nconsidered an insane amount of data,\nand ReFS is ready for it.\n\n374\n00:18:22.551 --> 00:18:25.740\nSo that's gonna be the final\nsystem of the future.\n\n375\n00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:30.234\nNow, as far as individual file size,\nthere's no limit, it can be\n\n376\n00:18:30.234 --> 00:18:34.120\nas large as your yottabyte array is or\nwhatever, that you've built for ReFS.\n\n377\n00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:41.434\nSo there's no file size limit, but\nthe volume size is limited to 1 yottabyte.\n\n378\n00:18:41.434 --> 00:18:42.212\nOh, you know what?\n\n379\n00:18:42.212 --> 00:18:45.149\nSorry, let me correct myself.\n\n380\n00:18:45.149 --> 00:18:46.739\nI need to make sure this is accurate.\n\n381\n00:18:46.739 --> 00:18:49.479\nOn NTFS, there's no file size limit.\n\n382\n00:18:49.479 --> 00:18:50.956\nIt's limited to your volume.\n\n383\n00:18:50.956 --> 00:18:53.776\nBut there is actually\na file size limit in ReFS.\n\n384\n00:18:53.776 --> 00:18:55.435\nIt's just really gigantic.\n\n385\n00:18:55.435 --> 00:18:58.128\nIt's 16 exabytes.\n\n386\n00:18:58.128 --> 00:19:01.835\nSo you have one yottabyte\nas the maximum volume size.\n\n387\n00:19:01.835 --> 00:19:05.489\n16 exabytes as the maximum\nindividual file size.\n\n388\n00:19:05.489 --> 00:19:08.531\nSo if you have 1 file,\nyou gotta cap it off at 16 exabytes.\n\n389\n00:19:08.531 --> 00:19:09.877\nA massive amount of data.\n\n390\n00:19:09.877 --> 00:19:12.993\n>> Well, I know I'm gonna run out of\nthat super soon, it's a really big deal,\n\n391\n00:19:12.993 --> 00:19:13.929\nthey should fix that.\n\n392\n00:19:13.929 --> 00:19:14.637\nIt's so frustrating.\n\n393\n00:19:14.637 --> 00:19:16.807\n>> Yeah, so\nbasically that's the solution there,\n\n394\n00:19:16.807 --> 00:19:19.036\nthat's what they've come up with for\nthe future.\n\n395\n00:19:19.036 --> 00:19:22.203\nNow when we're working in Windows,\nwhat does this mean to us, well,\n\n396\n00:19:22.203 --> 00:19:25.434\nit might not mean much, but if you ever\ngo to write a file to a hard drive.\n\n397\n00:19:25.434 --> 00:19:27.242\nAnd the file's 3 gigs in size and\nyou look and\n\n398\n00:19:27.242 --> 00:19:29.775\nthe hard drive has got plenty of\nspace on it and it won't write.\n\n399\n00:19:29.775 --> 00:19:31.680\nAnd says the driver's full.\n\n400\n00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.950\nIt might be that you're\ntrying to write a 3 gig file\n\n401\n00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:37.200\nto a file system that\ndoesn't support 3 gigs.\n\n402\n00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.910\nSo we need to understand\nthe files that are available.\n\n403\n00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.690\nLet me show you what it's like\nhere in the disc manager.\n\n404\n00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:45.153\nSo, I'm in my computer\nmanagement screen here, and\n\n405\n00:19:45.153 --> 00:19:48.124\nI've got one hard drive that I've\ndivided up into four pieces.\n\n406\n00:19:48.124 --> 00:19:50.004\nSee, how I've got FAT?\n\n407\n00:19:50.004 --> 00:19:53.430\nFat 32, NTFS and ReFS.\n\n408\n00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:56.380\nSo, I got these different guys\nkind of floating about here.\n\n409\n00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.660\nAll on one physical hard drive\nI've just created partitions.\n\n410\n00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:04.620\nWhen you create a drive inside of Windows,\nit defaults to NTFS.\n\n411\n00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:05.630\nThat's the one that it wants.\n\n412\n00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:08.410\nBut you can choose other ones.\n\n413\n00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:11.970\nBut the options kind of change\nbased on the size of your drive.\n\n414\n00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:15.198\nSo, for example,\nI've got this storage space down here.\n\n415\n00:20:15.198 --> 00:20:17.009\nIt's 768 gigs.\n\n416\n00:20:17.009 --> 00:20:20.849\nIf I try and format that,\nwhen I go to format it,\n\n417\n00:20:20.849 --> 00:20:25.554\nI get a couple of choices,\nNTFS and ReFS, and that's it.\n\n418\n00:20:25.554 --> 00:20:27.492\nI don't get any other choices.\n\n419\n00:20:27.492 --> 00:20:29.059\nWhy is that?\n\n420\n00:20:29.059 --> 00:20:34.179\nWell, at this size, well, actually this\none is limited because of storage spaces.\n\n421\n00:20:34.179 --> 00:20:37.848\nBut, it's too big for\nsome of the other file systems.\n\n422\n00:20:37.848 --> 00:20:42.538\nIf I take this drive here, this is\na 100 gig drive, it's only a 100 gigs.\n\n423\n00:20:42.538 --> 00:20:48.660\nIf I go to format that,\nI can choose between well, NTFS and ReFS.\n\n424\n00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:49.820\nThose are the two that I can choose,\n\n425\n00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:53.050\nand if you're trying this at home,\nReFS won't show up by default.\n\n426\n00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:54.900\nYou actually have to edit\na Registry key to turn that one,\n\n427\n00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.660\nbecause it's not ready for prime time.\n\n428\n00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:59.200\nMicrosoft doesn't really want\nyou running it right now.\n\n429\n00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.850\nYou can, but\nyou have to basically turn it on.\n\n430\n00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:04.332\nI'll put the steps to turn it on in\nthe show notes, so you can have it.\n\n431\n00:21:04.332 --> 00:21:07.211\nYou don't need to know that for the exam.\n\n432\n00:21:07.211 --> 00:21:09.325\nBut if I take a look at some\nof these smaller drives,\n\n433\n00:21:09.325 --> 00:21:10.612\nlike here's a 32 gig drive.\n\n434\n00:21:10.612 --> 00:21:15.012\n32 gigs,\nthat falls under the limit of FAT32.\n\n435\n00:21:15.012 --> 00:21:17.195\nWell, actually let me\nvisit that real quick.\n\n436\n00:21:17.195 --> 00:21:19.691\nBecause when I talk about FAT32\nwhat did I say the limit was?\n\n437\n00:21:19.691 --> 00:21:24.618\nI said the limit was 2 terabytes, but I\ndidn't see FAT32 with formatting this one,\n\n438\n00:21:24.618 --> 00:21:28.618\nbut on this one when I go to format it,\nthere's FAT32 in my choices.\n\n439\n00:21:28.618 --> 00:21:30.708\nWhy do I see it here and\nnot on the other ones?\n\n440\n00:21:30.708 --> 00:21:34.075\nWell, that's because\nMicrosoft made the decision.\n\n441\n00:21:34.075 --> 00:21:39.141\nIn software, they said they don't want\nyou formatting a disk over 32 gigs,\n\n442\n00:21:39.141 --> 00:21:40.229\nwith that 32.\n\n443\n00:21:40.229 --> 00:21:43.595\nThey want you to switch up to NTFS,\nthat's what they want you to use.\n\n444\n00:21:43.595 --> 00:21:45.348\nBut you still can do it.\n\n445\n00:21:45.348 --> 00:21:48.122\nYou can download third party utilities\nthat will let you format the disk,\n\n446\n00:21:48.122 --> 00:21:49.969\nyou can actually do it\nfrom the command line too.\n\n447\n00:21:49.969 --> 00:21:54.568\nWhere you can format a larger disk all\nthe way up to 2 terabytes as FAT32 if\n\n448\n00:21:54.568 --> 00:21:55.229\nyou want.\n\n449\n00:21:55.229 --> 00:21:56.238\nBut here in the UI it limits it.\n\n450\n00:21:56.238 --> 00:21:58.675\nSo that's why FAT32 wasn't\nshowing up on the other guys.\n\n451\n00:21:58.675 --> 00:22:01.303\nBut I see it here because the drive is\n\n452\n00:22:01.303 --> 00:22:04.991\nunder the 32 gig limit\nthat Microsoft imposed.\n\n453\n00:22:04.991 --> 00:22:09.066\nIf I go to an even smaller drive,\nthis one is 4 gigs.\n\n454\n00:22:09.066 --> 00:22:15.056\nIf I go to format it,\nnow I get FAT in addition to FAT32.\n\n455\n00:22:15.056 --> 00:22:20.720\nSo now I'm getting a drive that's able to\nhave more options because it's smaller.\n\n456\n00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.000\nIt's within the limits of FAT.\n\n457\n00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.060\nSo, Microsoft is actually checking for\nus, what's compatible.\n\n458\n00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:29.350\nCan you use this file system on\nthat particular type of disk?\n\n459\n00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:31.290\nAnd sometimes you can,\nsometimes you can't.\n\n460\n00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:33.900\nFor example, NTFS, NTFS has\n\n461\n00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:39.420\nlike something like 4 megabytes in data\nthat it eats up with just its table alone.\n\n462\n00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:43.180\nAnd so if you're trying to format a drive\nthat's under 4 megabytes, NTFS won't work.\n\n463\n00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.480\nWell, who has something that's\nunder 4 megabytes today?\n\n464\n00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:50.480\nIf you had a floppy disk, you can't format\na floppy disk NTFS, but FAT32 works.\n\n465\n00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.180\nSo it's actually checking for\nthat four and\n\n466\n00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:54.140\nonly showing us the file\nsystems that we need.\n\n467\n00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:59.059\nNow, the trick for\nan end user is once a disk is formatted,\n\n468\n00:22:59.059 --> 00:23:01.851\nhere in Explorer, they all look the same.\n\n469\n00:23:01.851 --> 00:23:05.362\nI named them so I'd remember what they\nwere, so I knew which one is FAT32 and\n\n470\n00:23:05.362 --> 00:23:08.116\nwhich one isn't, but\nwhen you come in here and look at them,\n\n471\n00:23:08.116 --> 00:23:09.593\nlike if I go into this FAT drive.\n\n472\n00:23:09.593 --> 00:23:11.967\nHere, this is my E drive and\nI've got a file in it,\n\n473\n00:23:11.967 --> 00:23:14.017\nI can start working with the copying data.\n\n474\n00:23:14.017 --> 00:23:17.198\nI've got a 2 gig file sitting\nright here on this FAT drive, and\n\n475\n00:23:17.198 --> 00:23:19.253\nthat's cuz FAT can handle a 2 gig file.\n\n476\n00:23:19.253 --> 00:23:22.594\nBut if I go into some of my other\ndrives like my FAT32 drive,\n\n477\n00:23:22.594 --> 00:23:24.175\nI've got a 4 gig file here.\n\n478\n00:23:24.175 --> 00:23:28.768\nAnd if I were to try and copy that and\nput that on to my FAT32 drive, I'm sorry,\n\n479\n00:23:28.768 --> 00:23:30.839\nFAT drive, what's gonna happen?\n\n480\n00:23:30.839 --> 00:23:32.105\nWell, the files too big.\n\n481\n00:23:32.105 --> 00:23:33.658\nIt's not gonna be able to write that,\n\n482\n00:23:33.658 --> 00:23:36.190\nit's gonna exceed what this\nfile system can handle.\n\n483\n00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:39.920\nAnd so when you go to place it, it's\ngonna say there's not enough free space.\n\n484\n00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.950\nThere might actually be enough free space,\nbut\n\n485\n00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:44.300\nit can't handle the file size that large.\n\n486\n00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.980\nThat's what it bumps into and\nyou start getting errors like these.\n\n487\n00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:49.780\nSo that's why it's important that as\nadministrators that we understand the file\n\n488\n00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:51.545\nsystems, so we know when we can see it.\n\n489\n00:23:51.545 --> 00:23:55.253\nNow, on mine, I named them so\nI could remember it just for the show.\n\n490\n00:23:55.253 --> 00:23:59.420\nBut in real-life land an easy way to\nfigure out is if you just right-click\n\n491\n00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:03.510\non a drive and choose Properties, it'll\ntell you how it's formatted right there.\n\n492\n00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:09.090\nSo this drive, this one, might be called\nSales, and this one might be called\n\n493\n00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:13.640\nMarketing, and I might have others that\nare called Human Resources, or whatever.\n\n494\n00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.920\nAs I store data for my company.\n\n495\n00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:20.190\nAnd so, here they are, and\njust however we named them.\n\n496\n00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:21.230\nNotice how I typed those.\n\n497\n00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.660\nI typed them lower case, but\nthen it went capitalized.\n\n498\n00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:27.610\nAnd that's because FAT and\nFAT32 don't store case for a label.\n\n499\n00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:30.340\nBut things like NTFS do.\n\n500\n00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:34.280\nSo, if I type this out like that.\n\n501\n00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.500\nIt's not gonna make it capitalized.\n\n502\n00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.130\nIt's different features for\ndifferent file systems.\n\n503\n00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:39.080\nWe have to kinda be aware of that.\n\n504\n00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:42.310\nBut now, I don't know which\none is formatted which way.\n\n505\n00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:46.758\nAnd so I can just pull up the properties\nand I'll see it right there, NTFS.\n\n506\n00:24:46.758 --> 00:24:51.158\nSo to the exam, we need to be aware of\nthe four different file system types.\n\n507\n00:24:51.158 --> 00:24:55.437\nFAT, FAT32, NTFS, and ReFS.\n\n508\n00:24:55.437 --> 00:24:58.814\nWe need to know that FAT and\nFAT32 are the old way.\n\n509\n00:24:58.814 --> 00:25:02.215\nAnd that we'll probably only use FAT32\non removable media that we're moving\n\n510\n00:25:02.215 --> 00:25:04.306\nbetween systems because\nof its compatibility.\n\n511\n00:25:04.306 --> 00:25:07.673\nBut that it's got that 32 gig\nlimit in software in Windows.\n\n512\n00:25:07.673 --> 00:25:09.287\nYou need to know that.\n\n513\n00:25:09.287 --> 00:25:12.095\nAnd then, NTFS,\nthat's the one we wanna use.\n\n514\n00:25:12.095 --> 00:25:15.648\nOn all of our systems, for operating\nsystems, removal media, wherever you can,\n\n515\n00:25:15.648 --> 00:25:17.750\nuse NTFS,\nthat's where you get the full power.\n\n516\n00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:21.129\nBut in the future, ReFS is coming.\n\n517\n00:25:21.129 --> 00:25:25.050\nKnow that it's not ready yet, but it will\nbe the next file system that comes along,\n\n518\n00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:26.747\nand that's what we're gonna see.\n\n519\n00:25:26.747 --> 00:25:28.684\nSo those are the takeaways\nthat we need to know for\n\n520\n00:25:28.684 --> 00:25:30.393\nthe exam on those different file systems.\n\n521\n00:25:30.393 --> 00:25:31.369\n>> Awesome stuff, Don.\n\n522\n00:25:31.369 --> 00:25:34.692\nNow, I would say that that's not\njust good news for the exam, but\n\n523\n00:25:34.692 --> 00:25:38.451\nalso good stuff that you need to\nmemorize just as you're getting into IT.\n\n524\n00:25:38.451 --> 00:25:40.028\nThis is stuff that's very applicable.\n\n525\n00:25:40.028 --> 00:25:44.153\nYou are gonna run into those people that\nhave something that has been formatted\n\n526\n00:25:44.153 --> 00:25:48.295\nFAT32 and they're trying to copy over\na file that's way too large for that.\n\n527\n00:25:48.295 --> 00:25:50.242\nAnd they're gonna call your desk, and say,\n\n528\n00:25:50.242 --> 00:25:53.164\nI don't know why this file isn't\ncoming out, plenty of space, and\n\n529\n00:25:53.164 --> 00:25:56.907\nit's not making it over and you're like,\nlet's check that formatted file system and\n\n530\n00:25:56.907 --> 00:26:00.135\nsee how you've got it set up,\nmaybe you're running into a problem there,\n\n531\n00:26:00.135 --> 00:26:02.725\ndefinitely had my share of those\nactions from time to time.\n\n532\n00:26:02.725 --> 00:26:03.990\n>> Absolutely.\n\n533\n00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:07.264\n>> Don, well,\nhave we covered all our bases on this one?\n\n534\n00:26:07.264 --> 00:26:07.950\n>> Yeah, that's it.\n\n535\n00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:09.912\nThat's we don't need a part\nthree on this one, I promise.\n\n536\n00:26:09.912 --> 00:26:11.269\n>> [LAUGH] Well, excellent.\n\n537\n00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:13.371\nHopefully, you guys have\nenjoyed this episode.\n\n538\n00:26:13.371 --> 00:26:14.369\nThanks for watching.\n\n539\n00:26:14.369 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.256\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:18.256 --> 00:00:21.098\nHere with me today,\nwell it's none other than Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:21.098 --> 00:00:22.112\nHow's it going today, Don?\n\n6\n00:00:22.112 --> 00:00:23.096\n>> It's going great, Daniel.\n\n7\n00:00:23.096 --> 00:00:26.194\nReady to jump right back into\nthe world of Microsoft MTA, and\n\n8\n00:00:26.194 --> 00:00:29.374\ntoday we're gonna be taking\na look at file and print sharing.\n\n9\n00:00:29.374 --> 00:00:33.551\nFile and print sharing is pretty important\nbecause very few people have just one\n\n10\n00:00:33.551 --> 00:00:36.666\ncomputer these days and\neven if you just have one computer,\n\n11\n00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:39.561\nit's very unlikely that you\ndon't know anyone else.\n\n12\n00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:42.041\nYou're on an island, you're by yourself,\nyou just have a computer.\n\n13\n00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:45.640\nAlmost everybody has to exchange\ninformation to share data between your\n\n14\n00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.357\ncomputer and other computers that\nare out there is very, very common, and\n\n15\n00:00:49.357 --> 00:00:52.120\nso that's what we're gonna take a look at.\n\n16\n00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.780\nHow can we get information from\none computer over to another\n\n17\n00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:56.710\nin a Windows network?\n\n18\n00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.650\nAnd you'll see there's actually several\ndifferent ways that we can do it.\n\n19\n00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.680\nNow this is something that people use,\n\n20\n00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.290\nwell, originally it was\nused in businesses.\n\n21\n00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.890\nThat's where a lot of\nthis stuff came from.\n\n22\n00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.750\nBack in the 1970s and 1980s, businesses\nstarted getting more than one computer and\n\n23\n00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.330\nthey needed to share information\nbetween the computers, but\n\n24\n00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.300\nit's grown to every\naspect of our lives now.\n\n25\n00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.840\nSo, in your home,\nyou might have a laptop and a desktop and\n\n26\n00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.750\nyou've got some photos on your laptop and\nyou just wanna get them over to\n\n27\n00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.820\nyour desktop and\nyou want to do it quickly and easily.\n\n28\n00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.870\nWell, what are some of\nthe ways that we can do that?\n\n29\n00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.680\nI I'll tell you the most common way.\n\n30\n00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.150\nIf I go out there and ask somebody like,\n\n31\n00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.010\nhey Daniel can you send me\nsome photos that you took.\n\n32\n00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.070\nWell the first option most\npeople think of is email,\n\n33\n00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.860\nI'll just attach it to an email and\nsend it to you, right.\n\n34\n00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.523\nBut email really wasn't designed\nto carry large amounts of data.\n\n35\n00:01:42.523 --> 00:01:44.863\nSo, Daniel,\nyou do the amateur photography thing,\n\n36\n00:01:44.863 --> 00:01:47.050\nwhat's the average size\nof a photo that you take?\n\n37\n00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.959\n>> The average size of a photo I\ntake is usually around 22 megs.\n\n38\n00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:52.065\n>> 22 megs.\n\n39\n00:01:52.065 --> 00:01:56.300\n>> Most email servers have\na maximum email size of 10 megs.\n\n40\n00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.310\nRight, very common.\n\n41\n00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.780\nSo if you're sending a Word document, if\nyou're sending a PDF, it's under 10 megs,\n\n42\n00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.580\nit'll work fine, but if it's bigger\nthan that, it's hit or miss.\n\n43\n00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.862\nSome servers have higher limits but\na lot have smaller.\n\n44\n00:02:05.862 --> 00:02:08.941\nSo for Daniel to send even one of his\nhigh-res photos that's not really\n\n45\n00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:09.671\ngonna work out.\n\n46\n00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:13.107\nAll right, other options are available,\nthings like OneDrive.\n\n47\n00:02:13.107 --> 00:02:14.180\nRight, Microsoft OneDrive, right.\n\n48\n00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.650\nI can put files up in OneDrive, and\n\n49\n00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.250\nI could share them with other people\nfrom there, from the cloud, right.\n\n50\n00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.500\nBut, what if I didn't want\nto get a cloud involved.\n\n51\n00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.190\nDaniel's computer is right here,\nmy computer is right here,\n\n52\n00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.750\nwe should be able to share data between\neach other right over the network.\n\n53\n00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.590\nWe're both on the same network.\n\n54\n00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.870\nHow can we share that data.\n\n55\n00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.920\nWell, Windows has a whole infrastructure\nbuilt into it to handle that because,\n\n56\n00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.340\nwell, Windows was doing network\nbefore we had wireless networks,\n\n57\n00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.505\nbefore we had before we had the internet,\nbefore we had OneDrive and all that stuff.\n\n58\n00:02:41.505 --> 00:02:44.935\nWe had an underlying share structure\nthat just let you share information and\n\n59\n00:02:44.935 --> 00:02:48.305\nresources between PCs on the same network,\nall right.\n\n60\n00:02:48.305 --> 00:02:52.625\nI say PCs but Apple, Linux or Mac OS and\nLinux, it works with them, too.\n\n61\n00:02:52.625 --> 00:02:55.610\nThere's a lot of flexibility and\ncompatibility there, all right.\n\n62\n00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.530\nSo, let me kind of run you through\na scenario here on my laptop,\n\n63\n00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.950\nand show what we might have.\n\n64\n00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.390\nSo here I am on my Windows 8 machine,\nand I've got some data.\n\n65\n00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.520\nRight?\nIf I go into my documents folder,\n\n66\n00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.020\nlet me just find my documents\nfolder here real quick,\n\n67\n00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.090\nI've got this folder called security.\n\n68\n00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.440\nAnd in it I've been writing\nup some security notes.\n\n69\n00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.520\nSo, I've got some little cipher strength\nnotes, and a simple cipher written up.\n\n70\n00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.230\nAnd these are things that I\nwant to share with another\n\n71\n00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.080\ncomputer on my network, all right?\n\n72\n00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.960\nThis other computer is maybe one I'm going\nto actually use to do a presentation.\n\n73\n00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.480\nSo I need to get some data over there.\n\n74\n00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.110\nOr it's a friend of mine, and I need\nto share this information with them.\n\n75\n00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.193\nI want them to have access to it.\n\n76\n00:03:32.193 --> 00:03:35.334\nWell, by default, they're not\nreally going to have access to it.\n\n77\n00:03:35.334 --> 00:03:37.650\nAll right,\nlet me show you what happens by default.\n\n78\n00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.090\nIn Windows, you can see other\ncomputers on your network.\n\n79\n00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.120\nWhen you browse into Windows Explorer,\nright,\n\n80\n00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.820\nit's just hitting this folder\ndown here on the task bar,\n\n81\n00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.220\nwhen you go into Windows Explorer right\nover here on the left side you've got all\n\n82\n00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.265\nthese different items like this PC and\nat the very bottom I've got network.\n\n83\n00:03:53.265 --> 00:03:56.985\nAnd that's gonna show me other computers\nthat are out there on my network, and\n\n84\n00:03:56.985 --> 00:03:58.145\nI'm gonna see this folder as empty.\n\n85\n00:03:58.145 --> 00:04:00.731\nThat's what we see by default\nbecause network discovery and\n\n86\n00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:03.977\nfile sharing are turned off, it's a nice\nbig ribbon that kind of warns you so\n\n87\n00:04:03.977 --> 00:04:05.830\nyou don't have to guess.\n\n88\n00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.810\nWell, all I have to do is turn that on and\n\n89\n00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.660\nnow my computer's going to\nstart watching the network for\n\n90\n00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.300\nother computers out there and I'm going\nto start telling other people about me.\n\n91\n00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.750\nWell, that's me right there, DONPEZET-PC,\nso I see myself It's kinda a funny thing,\n\n92\n00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.260\nbut you do see yourself and\n\n93\n00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.240\nnow I'm looking for other computers that\nare out there and I didn't find anybody.\n\n94\n00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.650\nWell, if there's another\nWindows machine on the network,\n\n95\n00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.370\nthey probably need to do that same thing.\n\n96\n00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.340\nIf I jump over here,\nI've got another machine.\n\n97\n00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.420\nAnd, this is a Windows 7 machine.\n\n98\n00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.280\nRight?\nI wanted to show you guys how this works.\n\n99\n00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.640\nWhoops.\nBetween different OSs here.\n\n100\n00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.440\nSo, I've got a Windows 7 machine.\n\n101\n00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.960\nAnd if this person is, this is Jane Doe.\n\n102\n00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.290\nAnd if Jane Doe fires up\nher Windows Explorer and\n\n103\n00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.080\ngoes to network, it's not much different.\n\n104\n00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.787\nShe sees that file and\nsharing is turned off.\n\n105\n00:04:48.787 --> 00:04:51.815\nSo she can turn that on and now,\nshe's gonna start scanning the network.\n\n106\n00:04:51.815 --> 00:04:53.500\nNow, she already sees me.\n\n107\n00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.860\nBecause I turned on file sharing, right?\n\n108\n00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.230\nNow, she's turned it on,\nand she shows up too.\n\n109\n00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.750\nRight?\n\n110\n00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.640\nSo, from over here, well, it'll take mine\na minute before it actually sees it.\n\n111\n00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.260\nBut eventually, we'll scan the network and\nwe'll find hers.\n\n112\n00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.890\nThere it is.\n\n113\n00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.280\nAnd we see Jane.\n\n114\n00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.640\nSo now we see each other's computers\non the network, that was pretty easy.\n\n115\n00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.580\nWell, we've only achieved half the battle,\nall right?\n\n116\n00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.080\nWe see the other person, but\nthere's not anything they're sharing.\n\n117\n00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.330\nI wanna share that security folder, right.\n\n118\n00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.720\nWell, if Jane comes in here and\n\n119\n00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.830\ndouble clicks on my computer,\nit's gonna ask for username and password.\n\n120\n00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.380\nShe has to have access to my system\nto be able to get in there, okay.\n\n121\n00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.060\nWell, how do I give her access?\n\n122\n00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.320\nWell there's a few different ways.\n\n123\n00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.320\nThe honest to goodness expected way is,\n\n124\n00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.610\nI need to create her a user\naccount on my computer.\n\n125\n00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.310\nIt's saying she has a user account, but\n\n126\n00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.020\nthat user account is only\ngood on her computer.\n\n127\n00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.650\nIt's not good on mine.\n\n128\n00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.580\nSo when she tries to access my computer,\nI don't know who she is.\n\n129\n00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.650\nI'm not gonna allow her access.\n\n130\n00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.980\nSo there's a few steps we have\nto go through to provide that.\n\n131\n00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.090\nAnd even if she did have\nan account on mine,\n\n132\n00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.180\nlike if she logged in as me for example.\n\n133\n00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.990\nWell, she's not going to see any folders,\n\n134\n00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.460\nbecause nothing is shared by\ndefault with these other users.\n\n135\n00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.090\nWe have to tell windows\nwhat we want to share.\n\n136\n00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.430\nI have to tell that I want to share this.\n\n137\n00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.050\nSecurity folder, all right.\n\n138\n00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.020\nWell, to do that, well,\nactually, let me show you that.\n\n139\n00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.900\nI wanna show you guys\nthat where it's empty and\n\n140\n00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.200\nshe doesn't actually see anything.\n\n141\n00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.690\nRight?\nSo I'm just gonna cancel that.\n\n142\n00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.790\nSo I'm gonna jump over to my computer.\n\n143\n00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.110\nAnd on my computer, what I can do\nis I can do one of two things, but\n\n144\n00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.750\nthe best thing to do is create her a user\naccount and then I can make a choice.\n\n145\n00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.720\nIf she's willing to tell me her password,\nI can create a username and\n\n146\n00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.180\npassword for her on my system that\nmatch the ones on her system.\n\n147\n00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.300\nIf they match, she'll be able to\nbrowse and access resources here and\n\n148\n00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.100\nit won't ask her to log in because\nher username and password match.\n\n149\n00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.700\nAll right?\nBut,\n\n150\n00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.684\nif she doesn't want to tell\nme her password, that's fine!\n\n151\n00:06:48.684 --> 00:06:50.130\nRight, that's good security practice.\n\n152\n00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.110\nYou're not supposed to tell\nsomebody your password.\n\n153\n00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.060\nI can create a user account and\npassword for her here that don't match.\n\n154\n00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.380\nAnd when she accesses, she'll just have\nto provide that other password, and\n\n155\n00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.160\nshe could choose to save it, so\nshe doesn't have to remember it past that.\n\n156\n00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.590\nBut, she'll have to\nenter it at least once.\n\n157\n00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.780\nNow, if we want to create user accounts on\ncomputer, we saw that in another episode.\n\n158\n00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.450\nI showed you guys the nice\nfriendly Windows 8 way.\n\n159\n00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.860\nI want to show you another way\nto do it that is the way I like.\n\n160\n00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.253\nIf you take over here in your\nmenu where it says this PC,\n\n161\n00:07:15.253 --> 00:07:17.340\nyou can right click on that and\nchoose manage.\n\n162\n00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.190\nAnd when you go into\nthe management screen for\n\n163\n00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:24.740\nyour computer, you've got local users and\ngroups right here.\n\n164\n00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.500\nAnd we can create user accounts, and I\nneed to create a user account for Jane, so\n\n165\n00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.560\nI'm going to make a Jane Doe account.\n\n166\n00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.330\nThat will be her username, her full name.\n\n167\n00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.190\nThen I'll put in a password for her and\n\n168\n00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:38.910\nI'm going to say she\ndoesn't have to change it.\n\n169\n00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:42.710\nIf I left that checked she could login and\nthe first time it would make her change\n\n170\n00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:46.530\nthe password and she could put in whatever\nshe wanted, she could make them match.\n\n171\n00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:47.910\nBut I'm just going to hard set it.\n\n172\n00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:49.796\nAnd I'll set it never to expire.\n\n173\n00:07:49.796 --> 00:07:53.766\nAll right, so\nnow Jane has an account on my computer.\n\n174\n00:07:53.766 --> 00:07:56.641\nNow, I knew Jane's password so\nI set it to be the same, and\n\n175\n00:07:56.641 --> 00:08:00.604\nwhen she browses over to my computer it's\nnot even gonna ask her for a password.\n\n176\n00:08:00.604 --> 00:08:04.779\nShe browses right to my computer, now I\nsaid nothing was shared out by default,\n\n177\n00:08:04.779 --> 00:08:07.848\nbut I see this users folder Well,\nwhat's that all about?\n\n178\n00:08:07.848 --> 00:08:11.600\nIf I browse into users I see Don Pezet,\nif I browse over there I see desktop.\n\n179\n00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.070\nIf I browse into there I see nothing.\n\n180\n00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.540\nWhy am I seeing this data?\n\n181\n00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:19.600\nWhat happens is there are some basic\nsettings you put in place to share out\n\n182\n00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.840\nresources between users on the system,\nand they're very, very limited.\n\n183\n00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.300\nSee, I don't see anything.\n\n184\n00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.860\nThere's nothing in there.\n\n185\n00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.010\nIt looks like there's photos there,\n\n186\n00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.110\nI recognize that there's\na user on the system.\n\n187\n00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.220\nBut I can't actually see their data.\n\n188\n00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.280\nIt's up to that user to then go and\n\n189\n00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.340\napprove what data they want to share out,\nright?\n\n190\n00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.790\nLet me show you that process.\n\n191\n00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:42.620\nIf I jump back over to my machine, so\nI'm logged in as Don on this machine, and\n\n192\n00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.770\nI wanna share that security folder,\n\n193\n00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:49.620\nwhat I need to do is I need to browse on\nmy computer and find that security folder,\n\n194\n00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:53.200\nwhich was in my Documents folder,\nhere's Security, okay.\n\n195\n00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.000\nI'm gonna right click on that and\nI'm gonna choose share with and\n\n196\n00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.610\nI can pick who I want to share it with.\n\n197\n00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:01.710\nAnd see Jane Doe's showing up right there?\n\n198\n00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:03.990\nRight?\nI can choose Jane Doe and\n\n199\n00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.600\nnow it's gonna share it out and she'll be\nable to see that folder and have access.\n\n200\n00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.390\nShe didn't even see my\ndocuments folder a minute ago.\n\n201\n00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:13.520\nNow she'll be able to see it and\naccess the resources, okay?\n\n202\n00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.180\nYou can choose specific people down here,\nbut you have to be careful with it\n\n203\n00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.110\nbecause there's an option here\nthat confuses a lot of people.\n\n204\n00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:20.950\nActually, this might come up on the exam,\nso I should mention it here.\n\n205\n00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:24.320\nIf we choose to share with specific\npeople, you can go in here and\n\n206\n00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.330\nyou can pick Jane Doe from this list too,\nright.\n\n207\n00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:27.710\nSame thing.\n\n208\n00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:29.800\nBut you can also pick Everyone.\n\n209\n00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:32.670\nWhat if I wanna share with\neverybody on my network?\n\n210\n00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:35.050\nI might choose everyone and\nthink that works, all right?\n\n211\n00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:39.330\nBut, it doesn't actually work unless they\nhave a user account on your computer.\n\n212\n00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.790\nThey still have to have a user account\nto be considered part of everyone.\n\n213\n00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.240\nIf they're anonymous,\nif they don't have a user account,\n\n214\n00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.650\nthey're not part of everyone.\n\n215\n00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:48.220\nThey don't gain access, right?\n\n216\n00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.580\nIf any of you guys are watching that\nhave been using Windows for a long,\n\n217\n00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:53.750\nlong time,\nit wasn't like that back in the day.\n\n218\n00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:56.400\nBack in the late 90s the permissions\nwere a little bit different.\n\n219\n00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.640\nThese days an anonymous user is not\ntechnically part of this everyone group.\n\n220\n00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.730\nSo they still have to have a user account.\n\n221\n00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:06.840\n>> Yeah Don, I would say this is\none the most misunderstood, or\n\n222\n00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.890\nnot even known about thing for\nour end users to encounter.\n\n223\n00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:12.200\nThey're trying to share something out,\n\n224\n00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.770\nthey just want somebody to be able to\nlook at things, share a file with them.\n\n225\n00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:18.014\nThey don't realize that each\none of these computers,\n\n226\n00:10:18.014 --> 00:10:21.038\nif you're not in a large corporate\nenvironment where everyone's kind of\n\n227\n00:10:21.038 --> 00:10:23.350\nlike put together in a big\ngroup they call that a domain.\n\n228\n00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:27.162\nIf you're not in that kind of environment,\nand you just have two PCs put together\n\n229\n00:10:27.162 --> 00:10:30.976\ntrying to show those resources You have to\nhave accounts on each one of those PCs,\n\n230\n00:10:30.976 --> 00:10:32.460\notherwise there is no access.\n\n231\n00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:36.010\nOne computer's gonna have a list of\nall the users that has access to it,\n\n232\n00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:39.230\nthe other computer's gonna have\na completely different list.\n\n233\n00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:41.574\nIf the two don't have some\nsimilar items going on,\n\n234\n00:10:41.574 --> 00:10:44.791\nespecially when it comes to those users,\nif I don't have Don on here,\n\n235\n00:10:44.791 --> 00:10:47.803\nDon doesn't have me on there,\nwe're not gonna be able to share.\n\n236\n00:10:47.803 --> 00:10:48.960\n>> Yep, absolutely.\n\n237\n00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.220\nSo in my case,\nI just wanna share with Jane.\n\n238\n00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.750\nSo what's the difference between choosing\nJane here versus choosing the other menu.\n\n239\n00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:55.830\nWell, let me show you.\n\n240\n00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:59.340\nIf I come in here, and then I right-click,\nand I choose share with Jane.\n\n241\n00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:01.690\nIt's done.\n\n242\n00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:02.870\nIt's shared.\n\n243\n00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.900\nWell, what did it give her?\n\n244\n00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.270\nWhat did I just do?\n\n245\n00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.890\nWell, when you share a data\nwith another person,\n\n246\n00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:11.280\nthere's permissions that are involved, and\n\n247\n00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:15.310\nit gave her certain default permissions,\nand I might want to change those.\n\n248\n00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:19.500\nIf I go back, and I right click, and\nI choose share with, and I go to specific\n\n249\n00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:24.080\npeople, this time I see Jane, and\nsee how I can adjust the permissions?\n\n250\n00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:28.770\nRight I couldn't do that when I just chose\nto share with her defaults to read only.\n\n251\n00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:32.480\nRead only means she will be able to see\nmy documents, but she can't change them.\n\n252\n00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.330\nSo if I just want to share\nthese documents with her.\n\n253\n00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.130\nHere you go Jane you\ncan read my documents.\n\n254\n00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:37.740\nWell I can do it, and I'm done.\n\n255\n00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.770\nShe can read it, she can get it I don't\nhave to worry about her changing my data.\n\n256\n00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:43.660\nBut if I want her to help me Hey,\ncan you help me with this document?\n\n257\n00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.080\nCan you add some data in there?\n\n258\n00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.390\nShe's gonna need\npermission to write to it.\n\n259\n00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:51.990\nAnd from this screen, we can actually\nchange that to read and write.\n\n260\n00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:55.540\nNow she has permission to open\nthe documents, change them, and\n\n261\n00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:56.930\nsave them again.\n\n262\n00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:59.860\nIf she just had read,\nshe could open the documents, change them,\n\n263\n00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.410\nbut when she went to save it,\nit would deny her.\n\n264\n00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:05.330\nShe wouldn't be able to actually\nchange them, all right.\n\n265\n00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:06.970\nThat's kinda the difference\nin those permissions and\n\n266\n00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:08.950\nthat's why we have two\ndifferent ways to get there.\n\n267\n00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:13.680\nIf I just want to have her be\nable to read the documents,\n\n268\n00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:17.420\nthe easiest way is to do, share with, and\npick her name right out of the list, okay?\n\n269\n00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.990\nSo, that's the easiest way to go about it.\n\n270\n00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:21.940\nNow that I've given her that access,\n\n271\n00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:26.500\nif we jump back over here to her,\nshe's browsing her network.\n\n272\n00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:27.910\nThen she goes to DONPEZET-PC,\n\n273\n00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:31.790\nshe sees that user's folder,\nshe sees my account, right?\n\n274\n00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:34.260\nAnd inside of my account,\nshe now sees my documents folder,\n\n275\n00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.490\nand when she goes in\nthere she sees security.\n\n276\n00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:40.320\nAnd in security there it is,\nthe cypher strength and\n\n277\n00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.940\nsimple cypher files\nthat I've put on there.\n\n278\n00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:46.640\nShe can open those up and\nshe can add some changes, all right.\n\n279\n00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.740\nAnd once she makes those\nchanges she can save it.\n\n280\n00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.350\nAnd she has permission to save that.\n\n281\n00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:53.360\nShe just edited that document for me.\n\n282\n00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:58.120\nMeanwhile I'm back at the office and\nI can come in and I can browse in here and\n\n283\n00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.230\nsee her changes.\n\n284\n00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:02.940\nSo if I go in and edit that simple cypher,\nthere's the changes she put in, right,\n\n285\n00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.080\nright there for me.\n\n286\n00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.940\nWe're now kinda working together.\n\n287\n00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:08.520\nObviously we don't want to be working\non the same document at the same time,\n\n288\n00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.740\nwe'll overwrite each other, but\nnow she can help out, right?\n\n289\n00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:15.660\nQuick and easy way to share\ndata in between us, right?\n\n290\n00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.680\nNow, when we did this share, there's\n\n291\n00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.680\none little kind of quirk with it that\nyou guys have probably already noticed.\n\n292\n00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.460\nWhen Jane had to get to it,\nwhat did she have to do?\n\n293\n00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:27.310\nShe went to Network,\nshe went to DONPEZET-PC,\n\n294\n00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:31.824\nthen she had to go to Users > Don Pezet\n> Documents, right, she had to browse\n\n295\n00:13:31.824 --> 00:13:36.777\nthrough quite a few folders just to get to\nwhat I wanted, or what she wanted, right?\n\n296\n00:13:36.777 --> 00:13:39.260\nAnd that takes a lot of effort.\n\n297\n00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.990\nSo how can we make that easier for her?\n\n298\n00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:44.960\nWell, there's two different\nways that we can make it easy.\n\n299\n00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:49.380\nOne way is you can do what's called\nmapping a network drive Mapping\n\n300\n00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:53.060\na network drive is when you take a network\ndrive and you give it a drive letter.\n\n301\n00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:53.990\nRemember our hard drives?\n\n302\n00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:57.220\nWhen you go to your computer,\nyour C drive is just C:.\n\n303\n00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.960\nOr if I have a D drive or\nE drive, you might see those.\n\n304\n00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:01.670\nIt's a drive letter.\n\n305\n00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:03.750\nIt's right here via your computer.\n\n306\n00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:06.610\nWell, we can map a network drive to that.\n\n307\n00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:08.180\nAnd we can tie it to that letter, right?\n\n308\n00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.440\nAnd that makes it easy to access.\n\n309\n00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.590\nInstead of going to network and\n\n310\n00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:13.180\nfinding the computer,\nyou can just browse for the letter.\n\n311\n00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.520\nIn my case, I've only got two computers\non the newwork.It's pretty easy for\n\n312\n00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.280\nher to find where she needs to go.\n\n313\n00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.525\nBut imagine you were a business and\nyou had 1,000 computers.\n\n314\n00:14:21.525 --> 00:14:25.080\nNow you gotta sift through that list and\nfind that one computer you want.\n\n315\n00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.090\nAnd browsing there it gets\nto be a little bit hard.\n\n316\n00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:30.450\nSo mapping a drive letter\ncan save a lot of time and\n\n317\n00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:32.080\nDaniel you know this better than most,\nright?\n\n318\n00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:36.250\nYou worked for an insurance company\nwhere you had thousands of people.\n\n319\n00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:38.850\nWhat were the odds of any of them\nremembering the location of a file share.\n\n320\n00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:40.630\n>> About slim to none.\n\n321\n00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:43.300\nIt was that all they knew\nwas the drive letter.\n\n322\n00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.910\nIf it wasn't there,\nmaybe they got a new PC.\n\n323\n00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:46.910\nWhere's my M drive?\n\n324\n00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:48.600\nI have to have my M drive.\n\n325\n00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.390\nDon't fret,\nI know where the M drive exists.\n\n326\n00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:54.150\nWe'll go ahead and re-map that for\nyou, and you'll be back in business.\n\n327\n00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:55.240\nSo yeah, they come very,\n\n328\n00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.640\nvery handy and people become very\nmuch reliant on them as well.\n\n329\n00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.440\n>> It does cut down the learning curve\non using network storage which is pretty\n\n330\n00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.360\nimportant.\n\n331\n00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:06.540\nSo when we browse to a computer like\nthis and we see a shared folder.\n\n332\n00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:10.690\nYou can right click on it and\nchoose to map the network drive and\n\n333\n00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:14.110\nnow I can map it to a drive letter,\nso it's available that way.\n\n334\n00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:18.060\nThe only quark is if I wanna browse\ninto a sub folder like this,\n\n335\n00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:19.550\nhere's that security folder.\n\n336\n00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:22.940\nWhen I right click on it,\nsee how I don't have map a network drive,\n\n337\n00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.530\nit's not one of my options.\n\n338\n00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:27.270\nSo that's kind of a limitation\nof mapping in that work drive.\n\n339\n00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:29.740\nIt does save us some time\ntying it to a drive letter but\n\n340\n00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.790\nit won't point to a sub folder like this.\n\n341\n00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:36.200\nAnd there's other ways you can try and\nkind of cheat the system and\n\n342\n00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.060\nget it to work.\n\n343\n00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:41.460\nI've seen some people get it where they\nmap to a sub directory like that but\n\n344\n00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:44.140\nreally it's intended to map\nto the root share there.\n\n345\n00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:48.190\nSo if I choose map and network drive It's\ngot that folder path kind of put in there,\n\n346\n00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:51.080\nand it's just asking you to pick\na drive letter to map to it.\n\n347\n00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:55.030\nAnd you can choose to reconnect at login,\nso it always connects at the same,\n\n348\n00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:57.000\nwhen your system boots so\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n349\n00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.084\nAnd then you can choose to connect with\nyour credentials or different credentials.\n\n350\n00:16:01.084 --> 00:16:04.473\nSo if it's a different password,\nyou can provide that right here and\n\n351\n00:16:04.473 --> 00:16:05.472\nit'll connect up.\n\n352\n00:16:05.472 --> 00:16:08.575\nBut That security folder is\nnot the root folder, and so\n\n353\n00:16:08.575 --> 00:16:10.267\nI don't wanna map two users.\n\n354\n00:16:10.267 --> 00:16:12.710\nI wanna map the giant subdirectory.\n\n355\n00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:16.300\nSo there's another option we have\navailable called advanced file sharing.\n\n356\n00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:20.170\nAnd with advanced file sharing it's\nnot sticking stuff inside of your user\n\n357\n00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:23.390\nprofile like this,\nit's putting it as a root.\n\n358\n00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:23.930\nLet me show you.\n\n359\n00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:27.820\nI'm gonna take that same folder and I'm\ngonna share it with advanced File sharing.\n\n360\n00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:32.910\nSo when I go back to my machine,\nI'm going to go to my Security folder.\n\n361\n00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:37.100\nAnd instead of right-clicking and\ngoing to Share with and picking a person,\n\n362\n00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:40.820\nI'm just gonna skip the Share with part\nand go way down here to Properties.\n\n363\n00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:44.240\nAnd under Properties\nthere's a Sharing tab.\n\n364\n00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.110\nAnd under sharing,\nyou'll see Network and File Sharing.\n\n365\n00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:48.190\nThat's what we did all ready, right?\n\n366\n00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:49.160\nI can see it showing it.\n\n367\n00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.590\nI can see that file path right there,\nright?\n\n368\n00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:54.130\nYou always recognize\nthe network file path.\n\n369\n00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:58.620\nThey're called a UNC and you recognize\nUNCs by the double slashes at\n\n370\n00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:05.200\nthe beginning right and when we see that\nit's slash slash followed by the PC name.\n\n371\n00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:09.184\nSo mine's Don Pezet-PC/ and\nthen the path of the folder, so\n\n372\n00:17:09.184 --> 00:17:12.718\nthis is /users/Don\nPezet/documents/security.\n\n373\n00:17:12.718 --> 00:17:16.040\nThat's how somebody could\naccess this resource.\n\n374\n00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:20.480\nWell if I go down to advanced sharing,\nI can choose that and\n\n375\n00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.400\nI can choose to share the folder.\n\n376\n00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.670\nAnd I'm gonna share it and\ncall it security, okay.\n\n377\n00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:30.380\nNow when I do this, it's not gonna share\nit nested inside of another folder.\n\n378\n00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:34.080\nIt's going to create an all new\nshare that's just called security,\n\n379\n00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.780\nand this is going to be the root.\n\n380\n00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.910\nThis is going to be the way\nthat people get to it.\n\n381\n00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:41.800\nAnd the only quirk here is that\npermissions have to be done manually.\n\n382\n00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:45.090\nI don't have a nice little easy, right\nclick and set permissions type thing.\n\n383\n00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:48.580\nI need to go into Permissions,\nI need to add in each person.\n\n384\n00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:51.350\nAnd the naming of the permissions\nare different on this screen, too,\n\n385\n00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:53.890\nbecause this is a little more advanced,\nwe have one more option.\n\n386\n00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:58.440\nIf I wanna add in Jane Doe, so\nI'm gonna come in here and add her in,\n\n387\n00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:04.930\nthen I can pick do I want Jane to\nhave full control, change, or read?\n\n388\n00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.680\nNow, what's the difference?\n\n389\n00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:11.800\nRead, you can open the document but\nyou can't change it, you can't save to it.\n\n390\n00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:15.890\nChange, you can open the document,\nyou can modify it, and you can save it.\n\n391\n00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:19.470\nSo, when we see read/write on\nthe other screen, that's change here.\n\n392\n00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:25.540\nAnd notice, I can't give somebody change\nwithout also giving them read, right?\n\n393\n00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.880\nWhen I choose change it\nautomatically clicks read.\n\n394\n00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.490\nYou have to be able to open\na document to change it so\n\n395\n00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:30.680\nthose two are linked together.\n\n396\n00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.300\nSo this is basically read and read write.\n\n397\n00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.150\nThat's what these equate to.\n\n398\n00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:38.260\nFull control though,\nwe didn't see that in the other menu.\n\n399\n00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:43.170\nFull control will let Jane change\nthe permissions on this file too.\n\n400\n00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:45.240\nShe can do a lot more with\nthe file than normal.\n\n401\n00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.330\nNow we don't normally want somebody else\nchanging permissions on our file because\n\n402\n00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.800\nthey could technically lock us out of it,\nright?\n\n403\n00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:51.760\nI'll show you guys later on.\n\n404\n00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:55.640\nProbably in like part two of this episode\nhow to override that but we don't normally\n\n405\n00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.960\nwanna get that out but if we want her to\nbe able to give other people permission to\n\n406\n00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:02.340\naccess it then we might choose to\ngive her full control in that case.\n\n407\n00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.650\nI'm not going to.\n\n408\n00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:04.720\nSo I'll go ahead and set that.\n\n409\n00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.020\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nsay okay to that.\n\n410\n00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.240\nAnd get ride of those screens.\n\n411\n00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.980\nNow watch what happens when\nJane browses to my computer.\n\n412\n00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.000\nWhen she goes to network and\n\n413\n00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.840\nshe browses the Don Pezet PC she\nsees users and there's security.\n\n414\n00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:25.320\nWhen you do advanced sharing you can share\nthe folder itself specifically, not nested\n\n415\n00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:29.960\ninside of some path and now she can browse\nright to it and there's the documents.\n\n416\n00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:35.180\nAnd, even better, if she goes back to my\nsystem, she can right-click on security.\n\n417\n00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:36.810\nShe can map the network drive.\n\n418\n00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:39.340\nAnd I'm going to map that to my S-drive.\n\n419\n00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:40.710\nS for security.\n\n420\n00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:43.337\nSo when she's going to work\non security documents,\n\n421\n00:19:43.337 --> 00:19:46.460\nshe's going to go into the S-drive,\nand I'll finish that.\n\n422\n00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.120\nAnd it's set to reconnect at log in.\n\n423\n00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.840\nSo from now on, whenever she logs in in\nthe morning, when she's ready to work on\n\n424\n00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.880\nsecurity documents,\nshe can just fire up her folder.\n\n425\n00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.460\nShe can go to computer.\n\n426\n00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:57.950\nThere's her C drive.\n\n427\n00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:59.790\nAnd now she's got an S drive.\n\n428\n00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:01.320\nAnd that S drive is mapped to my computer.\n\n429\n00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.180\nShe can browse right in there,\nand there's her documents.\n\n430\n00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:05.930\nThat's a lot easier.\n\n431\n00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:09.860\nI say it's easier, there's still a bit of\nwork that has to be done to get that set\n\n432\n00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.680\nup right,\nwe had to create the user account for\n\n433\n00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:16.080\nher, we had to turn on the advanced file\nsharing, so there's work to get it set up.\n\n434\n00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.070\nBut once it is set up, it's far more easy.\n\n435\n00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:21.830\nSo that does make life a bit easier.\n\n436\n00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:26.870\nNow, what we've seen is the quick\nfile sharing in Windows, and\n\n437\n00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:29.380\nwe saw the advanced file\nsharing in Windows.\n\n438\n00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.590\nBoth of which required us to create\na user account for Jane ahead of time.\n\n439\n00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.940\nWhat if I didn't want to do that.\n\n440\n00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.210\nI want Jane to be able to\naccess some files, but\n\n441\n00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:41.250\nI don't want to create a user account for\nher.\n\n442\n00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:44.390\nNow, why would I not want to\ncreate a user account for Jane.\n\n443\n00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:48.410\nWell, when we created that account for\nher, technically, she could come to my\n\n444\n00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:52.150\ncomputer, sit down right in front it,\nand log in as herself now.\n\n445\n00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:54.250\nShe could actually use my computer.\n\n446\n00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:57.207\nMaybe I don't want that, I want Jane to\nhave some access to some documents but\n\n447\n00:20:57.207 --> 00:20:58.999\nI don't want her to\nactually use my computer.\n\n448\n00:20:58.999 --> 00:21:00.563\nI'm gonna keep my computer private.\n\n449\n00:21:00.563 --> 00:21:02.038\n>> But Jane's a sweet girl.\n\n450\n00:21:02.038 --> 00:21:04.883\n>> And who would think the things\nshe could do on my computer, but\n\n451\n00:21:04.883 --> 00:21:05.822\nwho knows, right?\n\n452\n00:21:05.822 --> 00:21:09.130\nSo I want to share data and\nnot have her access my computer.\n\n453\n00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:10.640\nI don't want to create a user account.\n\n454\n00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.510\nWell in order for\n\n455\n00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:14.590\nthe file sharing we just saw to work\nshe's gotta have a user account.\n\n456\n00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:15.190\nShe's got to.\n\n457\n00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:16.700\nThat's how it works.\n\n458\n00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.810\nWell, in Windows 7 and in Windows 8,\n\n459\n00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:21.780\nwe have another feature\nthat's called a home group.\n\n460\n00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.110\nIt's in Windows 10 too.\n\n461\n00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:24.940\nSo it's called a home group.\n\n462\n00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:28.610\nAnd a home group allows you to\nshare computers between machines\n\n463\n00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:30.620\nwithout user accounts, right?\n\n464\n00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:34.240\nIt's basically working off this\nidea that if you're at home,\n\n465\n00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.860\nright, this is not for businesses,\nhome groups are not useful for businesses.\n\n466\n00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.910\nBut if you're at home, and you've got more\nthan one computer, the odds are you wanna\n\n467\n00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:44.760\nshare data between the computers and\nyou're not really worried about passwords.\n\n468\n00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.640\nYou're just worried about making sure\nyou approve individual machines.\n\n469\n00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:51.740\nSo I don't care if it's me or my wife or\none of my sons that are sitting at that\n\n470\n00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:54.510\ncomputer, I want them to have\naccess to these resources, right.\n\n471\n00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:57.550\nAnd, yeah, if somebody else brings\ntheir own computer into my house,\n\n472\n00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:59.330\nI don't necessarily want\nthem to have access.\n\n473\n00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:00.940\nBut for my computers I do and\n\n474\n00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.290\nI don't wanna mess around with\na bunch of user accounts.\n\n475\n00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:05.150\nYou can create a home group and\n\n476\n00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:08.650\nit's a secure relationship\nbetween Windows computers\n\n477\n00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:13.080\nthat allows them to share files without\nhaving to mess with the permissions, okay.\n\n478\n00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.440\nAnd you probably saw it as I\nwas sharing that stuff out.\n\n479\n00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:20.260\nBack here when I went to share out\nsecurity, I right clicked on it.\n\n480\n00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.140\nOops, let me try that again.\n\n481\n00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:23.230\nI right clicked on it.\n\n482\n00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:27.720\nAnd I went to share with, and right in\nhere it had create or join a home group.\n\n483\n00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:31.090\nThat's another option that's available for\nme to create that.\n\n484\n00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:35.050\nAnd if these are Windows 7, Windows 8,\nWindows 10 machines, we can do that.\n\n485\n00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:37.770\nIf I've got Windows XP,\ndoesn't support home groups.\n\n486\n00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:39.262\nWindows Vista doesn't support home groups,\n\n487\n00:22:39.262 --> 00:22:42.190\nright, so\nit's got to be one of the newer OSs.\n\n488\n00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:44.990\nAnd if I choose to do that, if I've\n\n489\n00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:49.190\nalready set up a home group on another\ncomputer I can go and get the password for\n\n490\n00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:52.320\nthat homegroup from somebody who knows it,\nand punch it in here.\n\n491\n00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:56.480\nBut if I've never created a homegroup\nbefore it's gonna build one for me.\n\n492\n00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.730\nAnd so\nwhen I move forward in my settings here,\n\n493\n00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:00.500\nit's gonna ask what do I want to share?\n\n494\n00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.400\nWhat do I want to get out to\npeople that are in my homegroup?\n\n495\n00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.720\nAnd I can choose pictures, videos, music.\n\n496\n00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.430\nSee how documents are not\nshared by default?\n\n497\n00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:10.630\nAnd that's because you might wanna\nhave some documents that are private,\n\n498\n00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:11.600\nand other ones that are shared.\n\n499\n00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.220\nYou can pick and choose.\n\n500\n00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:14.570\nIn my case, I'm gonna go ahead and\nshare them.\n\n501\n00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:18.340\nBut I'll show you how to private folders\ntoo, and even printers and devices,\n\n502\n00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:19.190\nwhich we'll talk about later.\n\n503\n00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:23.810\nAll right, when I move forward,\nit's gonna start creating it.\n\n504\n00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:25.320\nNow when it creates it, it takes a moment,\n\n505\n00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.500\nbecause it's updating\npermissions on the hard drive.\n\n506\n00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:31.620\nIt's gotta get things kinda set up and\nthen it creates a password, all right?\n\n507\n00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.810\nNow the password is something\nrandomly generated, and\n\n508\n00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:35.450\nwe can actually change that.\n\n509\n00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:36.940\nSo we might wanna modify it.\n\n510\n00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:42.240\nBut for right now, it's really\nimportant that we save this password.\n\n511\n00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.830\nSo I wanna save it, because I'm\ngonna need to give that to Jane so\n\n512\n00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:47.800\nthat she'll be able to join my home group.\n\n513\n00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:51.040\nAnd so what I'm gonna do is, she already\nhas access to the security folder, right?\n\n514\n00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:57.050\nSo I'll just create a quick file in here,\nwhich I'll call homegroup.txt,\n\n515\n00:23:57.050 --> 00:24:00.754\nand I'll paste in that key so\nthat I've got it.\n\n516\n00:24:00.754 --> 00:24:01.393\nThere we go.\n\n517\n00:24:01.393 --> 00:24:04.899\nAll right, so now I don't have to worry\nabout losing it, which is important right.\n\n518\n00:24:04.899 --> 00:24:08.660\nSo now I've got a home group and\nI've got the password.\n\n519\n00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:12.990\nPeople can join it, and I'm automatically\nsharing things with those people.\n\n520\n00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:15.380\nSo she can get in there and\nstart to work with it.\n\n521\n00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:18.090\nIf I want to change that\nhome group password,\n\n522\n00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:22.950\nif you pull up your start menu or your\nstart screen, and just type in home group,\n\n523\n00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:25.150\nyou'll get the HomeGroup\nsettings right there.\n\n524\n00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:28.700\nAnd you can go into the HomeGroup settings\nand here's where we've turned on and\n\n525\n00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.330\noff whether we've got documents,\nmusic, pictures, right?\n\n526\n00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:35.240\nSo you can change those,\nyou can leave the HomeGroup, and\n\n527\n00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.790\nyou can even change the password.\n\n528\n00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:39.360\nActually, you know what, it doesn't\nlet me change it from this screen.\n\n529\n00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.750\nWe have to go to the other screen.\n\n530\n00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:42.455\nYou'll notice back here, oops.\n\n531\n00:24:42.455 --> 00:24:44.920\n[LAUGH] If I can get back to it,\nthere we go.\n\n532\n00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.670\nWhen I type this that we had\nHomeGroup settings and we also had\n\n533\n00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:52.040\nchoose HomeGroup and Sharing options,\nwhich takes us to a different screen.\n\n534\n00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.060\nWell, I thought it took\nus to a different screen.\n\n535\n00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:57.720\nWe can go to the old screen in the Control\nPanel is where I'm trying to get, and\n\n536\n00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.660\nthat one will have you where you\ncan actually change the password.\n\n537\n00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:04.120\nBut Microsoft encourages you not to change\nthe password just because they don't want\n\n538\n00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.150\nyou to set it to something\neasy that can be guessed,\n\n539\n00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:11.985\nbecause what happens if somebody goes in\nthere and guesses is your password, right?\n\n540\n00:25:11.985 --> 00:25:15.445\nThen they can get in and access your data\nwithout having a user account, all right?\n\n541\n00:25:15.445 --> 00:25:16.135\nWell let me show you.\n\n542\n00:25:16.135 --> 00:25:18.875\nSo here I am in the start screen and\nmy head's kind of covering it up.\n\n543\n00:25:18.875 --> 00:25:20.635\nLet's take a look at this full screen.\n\n544\n00:25:20.635 --> 00:25:23.895\nAnd what you'll see is\na little bit further down,\n\n545\n00:25:23.895 --> 00:25:25.005\nchange the HomeGroup password.\n\n546\n00:25:25.005 --> 00:25:26.185\nThere it is, all right.\n\n547\n00:25:26.185 --> 00:25:29.105\nSo we can choose that and\nsee how it's not the touch interface UI.\n\n548\n00:25:29.105 --> 00:25:31.420\nIt's gone right back to\nthe regular control panel.\n\n549\n00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:35.740\nAnd so from right here I can view or\nprint my current HomeGroup password, or\n\n550\n00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:36.910\nI can change it.\n\n551\n00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:40.030\nAnd so I might choose to change it\nto something a little bit easier.\n\n552\n00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:41.350\nBut Microsoft encourages\nyou not to do that.\n\n553\n00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:42.690\nAll right?\n\n554\n00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:46.690\nIn my case I've got it copied over here\nwhere Jane can just get it out of file.\n\n555\n00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:49.580\nSo on Jane's computer I'm just gonna jump\nright in here to that handy network share\n\n556\n00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:50.410\nthat we made.\n\n557\n00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:51.990\nAnd I'll browse right into that thing, and\n\n558\n00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:55.002\nI'm going to get that password\nbecause I can't remember it.\n\n559\n00:25:55.002 --> 00:25:57.350\nThat's kinda that whole point\nof these things I guess.\n\n560\n00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:01.000\nSo I'm going to give that a password, and\nnow she's ready to join the HomeGroup.\n\n561\n00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.210\nSo I'll just pull up her start menu and\ntype HomeGroup.\n\n562\n00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:06.450\nIt'll be one of the options\nthat pops up right there, and\n\n563\n00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:08.690\nsomething really interesting\nis gonna happen.\n\n564\n00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:12.030\nWindows will scan the network for\na HomeGroup ID fault.\n\n565\n00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:14.470\nYou can only have one\nHomeGroup on a network.\n\n566\n00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:18.230\nSo it sees Don Pezett on Don Pezet PC\nhas created a HomeGroup.\n\n567\n00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:19.870\nThere's already one there.\n\n568\n00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:22.730\nSo, she doesn't have the option\nto create a HomeGroup.\n\n569\n00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:24.230\nShe can't.\nYou can only have one HomeGroup\n\n570\n00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:27.130\non a network and\nthere's already one on this network.\n\n571\n00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:30.350\nSo, her only choice is to\njoin the HomeGroup, and so\n\n572\n00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:32.060\nshe's got that join now button.\n\n573\n00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:33.480\nSo she can choose join now.\n\n574\n00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:36.510\nIt's going to ask what are her\ndocuments she wants to share out.\n\n575\n00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:38.260\nDoes she want to share\nout all of her stuff?\n\n576\n00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:42.070\nPictures, music, videos,\nprinters are by default, documents aren't.\n\n577\n00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.890\nMaybe I'll leave hers all.\n\n578\n00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.340\nAnd then it's gonna ask for that password.\n\n579\n00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:48.660\nShe got to provide the password and\n\n580\n00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:53.570\nif it matches, she's gonna build\na trust relationship with my computer.\n\n581\n00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:57.650\nAnd now she'll be able to access\nthe resources that I've shared out,\n\n582\n00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:00.250\nwithout having to have a user\naccount on my computer.\n\n583\n00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:03.550\nSo now she can access the files and\ndocuments that I've shared,\n\n584\n00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:06.620\nbut she can't actually sit down\non my computer and log in.\n\n585\n00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:09.350\nIf she doesn't have an account, right.\n\n586\n00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:14.140\nAnd when that's done, so here it's all\ndone, she can fire up Windows Explorer.\n\n587\n00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:18.800\nAnd instead of going down here to network,\nsee how she's got HomeGroup right here,\n\n588\n00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.630\nand she'll see all\nthe HomeGroup computers.\n\n589\n00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:25.030\nSo she can see my HomeGroup, and there's\ndocuments, pictures, music, videos.\n\n590\n00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:29.290\nShe can browse in and access the resources\nI've chosen to share out and\n\n591\n00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:30.632\nmake available, right?\n\n592\n00:27:30.632 --> 00:27:34.910\nSo HomeGroups are designed to be\na little easier for homes, right?\n\n593\n00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:39.130\nHomes or just Windows only environments\nlike that that are really small.\n\n594\n00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:41.605\nFor businesses,\nyou can't really use HomeGroups.\n\n595\n00:27:41.605 --> 00:27:44.570\nThey're not suitable cuz it doesn't give\nyou enough differentiation between users.\n\n596\n00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:48.072\nYou don't create individual classes of\nusers that just all treat it the same,\n\n597\n00:27:48.072 --> 00:27:49.940\nwhich is great for home, right?\n\n598\n00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:53.170\nSo for businesses, you're going\nto use the advanced sharing, or\n\n599\n00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:54.320\nthe standard sharing, right?\n\n600\n00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.180\nThose will kinda be the ways\nthat are available.\n\n601\n00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:59.620\nBut, three different mechanisms there\nto share these resources between\n\n602\n00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:00.440\nthe computers.\n\n603\n00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.300\nAnd give people access\nto what's on my system.\n\n604\n00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.310\n>> Well, Don, it looks like we've looked\nat a couple of ways in which we can share\n\n605\n00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:07.150\nfiles, a lot of great ways.\n\n606\n00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:08.670\nI really enjoy that HomeGroup business.\n\n607\n00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:12.360\nThat makes it a whole lot easier for\nour home users out there, but\n\n608\n00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:15.910\nwe still have printers and a couple\nother things we wanna share out as well,\n\n609\n00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:18.800\nso it looks like we're gonna\nhave to do a part two on this.\n\n610\n00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.250\nHopefully we'll see you there.\n\n611\n00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:22.370\nHopefully you guys have\nenjoyed this episode as well.\n\n612\n00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:24.840\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n613\n00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.303\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n614\n00:28:26.303 --> 00:28:27.232\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n615\n00:28:27.232 --> 00:28:28.439\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n616\n00:28:28.439 --> 00:28:34.930\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.191 --> 00:00:20.350\nI'll be your host Daniel Lawry, here with\nme today, none other than Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.390\nHow's it going today, Don?\n\n6\n00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.360\n>> It is going great Daniel.\n\n7\n00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.670\nGlad to be back on the show.\n\n8\n00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.948\nAnd ready to wrap up the second part\nof our file and print sharing episode.\n\n9\n00:00:27.948 --> 00:00:30.310\nWe're gonna be taking a look at some\nof the things we didn't get to in\n\n10\n00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.940\nthe last episode.\n\n11\n00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.830\nAs the title of the episode kind\nof implies, it's called file and\n\n12\n00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:35.790\nprint sharing.\n\n13\n00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.810\nWe never did share a printer,\ndid we Daniel?\n\n14\n00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:38.680\n>> No, not yet.\n\n15\n00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.430\n>> Yeah.\nWe should probably look into doing that.\n\n16\n00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.970\nThat's important to know.\n\n17\n00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.000\nThen there's some advanced security\nsettings we need to be aware of behind\n\n18\n00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.129\nthe scenes also,\nthat I want to make sure we tackle.\n\n19\n00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.347\nSo we'll get a chance to see\nthose in this episode too.\n\n20\n00:00:49.347 --> 00:00:52.780\nSo let's kick things off by\nlooking at printer sharing.\n\n21\n00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.320\nNow, Daniel, why would somebody want\nto share a printer between machines?\n\n22\n00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.540\nDon't we all just have our own printer?\n\n23\n00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.940\n>> I know I don't want\npeople sharing my printer.\n\n24\n00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.075\nThey're gonna eat up all my ink.\n\n25\n00:01:01.075 --> 00:01:02.380\nBut, you know, I say that.\n\n26\n00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.110\nIt is factitious.\n\n27\n00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.690\nWe're having a good time here.\n\n28\n00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.680\nWell, the reason that people want to share\nprinters, well you have one printer.\n\n29\n00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.070\nMaybe I only have one printer for\nmy entire office.\n\n30\n00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.380\nMaybe I have a small office environment,\nand that printer needs to be shared out.\n\n31\n00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.720\nAn easy way to do it is just\nset it up through the file and\n\n32\n00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.700\nprint sharing features available\nin the Windows operating system.\n\n33\n00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.930\n>> Yeah, back in the day,\nprinting was just commonplace.\n\n34\n00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:23.560\nEverybody printed.\n\n35\n00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.380\nWhen you bought a computer it either\ncame bundled with a printer, or\n\n36\n00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.800\nyou bought one immediately afterwards.\n\n37\n00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.180\nThat was how it worked.\n\n38\n00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.480\nBut in today's world almost\neverything is electronic.\n\n39\n00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.800\nAnd so it's far less common to print.\n\n40\n00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.790\nIt makes a lot more sense to\nshare a printer between machines.\n\n41\n00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.610\nYou can have one printer, hooked up to\none computer, and it can in turn share\n\n42\n00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.380\nwith all the other computers in your\nnetwork, and it's not very hard to do.\n\n43\n00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.940\nAll right.\n\n44\n00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.290\nNow, one word of caution out\nthere in real world land.\n\n45\n00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.250\nWhen you go to buy a printer, there's\nplenty of printers out there that have\n\n46\n00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.530\nwireless cards, or physical network\njacks built right into them so\n\n47\n00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.380\nyou can plug them directly\ninto the network.\n\n48\n00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.150\nAnd those are really cool.\n\n49\n00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.710\nBecause when you do that, anybody on your\nnetwork can print directly to that printer\n\n50\n00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.238\nand that's it,\nit's between them and the printer.\n\n51\n00:02:05.238 --> 00:02:08.360\nBut what we're about to show you,\nis how to hook a printer\n\n52\n00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.970\ndirectly up to a Windows machine, and\nthen share it out to the other computers.\n\n53\n00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.430\nAnd the challenge with\nthis is kinda twofold.\n\n54\n00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.630\nBut one, you're not printing\ndirectly to a printer anymore.\n\n55\n00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.210\nYou're printing through\nsomebody else's computer.\n\n56\n00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.820\nSo, that means we need to have the setup.\n\n57\n00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.480\nAnd then the second thing is, you're\nprinting through somebody else's computer,\n\n58\n00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.870\nso what happens if they\nshut their computer down?\n\n59\n00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.150\nNow you can't print.\n\n60\n00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.500\nSo those direct network attached printers,\nthey're really nice because\n\n61\n00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.840\nyou don't have to worry about what\ncomputer's on, and what computer's off.\n\n62\n00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.900\nSo that's usually the route\nthat we want to go.\n\n63\n00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.140\nBut if you don't have that,\nif you have a printer that's USB, or\n\n64\n00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.630\nstill using a parallel port,\nor something like that.\n\n65\n00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.840\nIf it's directly connected to your\ncomputer, you can still share it out.\n\n66\n00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.150\nAnd there's a couple of different uses for\nthat, all right.\n\n67\n00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.360\nSo let's take a look at my\nWindows 8 machine here, and\n\n68\n00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.740\nwhat I've got is I've got\na printer added on mine.\n\n69\n00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.890\nI'm gonna just fire up my Modern UI,\nlet me get that launched.\n\n70\n00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.930\nAnd I'm gonna go into my devices and\nprinters.\n\n71\n00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:06.560\nAll right?\n\n72\n00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.490\nAnd in here,\nI'm gonna see all the various devices,\n\n73\n00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.090\nincluding things like monitors, and\nin here I'll see my printers too.\n\n74\n00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.930\nSo you're gonna have a couple of printers.\n\n75\n00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.430\nWindows 8 by default,\nwill have a fax printer and\n\n76\n00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.360\na Microsoft XPS document writer.\n\n77\n00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.570\nThese are virtual printers not real ones,\nall right?\n\n78\n00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:21.550\nThey're virtual items.\n\n79\n00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.300\nYour fax would be, if you sent to it, it\nwould be tied to a modem to actually call\n\n80\n00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.700\nout on a phone line which I don't have.\n\n81\n00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.775\nAnd then the XPS document writer\nis where you print to it, and\n\n82\n00:03:30.775 --> 00:03:33.445\nit creates an XPS document\nwhich is similar to a PDF.\n\n83\n00:03:33.445 --> 00:03:36.550\nIt's a document that can be read anywhere.\n\n84\n00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.660\nBut I do have one real printer, I've got\na Cannon Image Runner attached here.\n\n85\n00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.320\nThat's my real printer,\nI plugged it in, it's got a driver, and\n\n86\n00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.330\nit's ready to rock, okay.\n\n87\n00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.270\nThat's good for my computer.\n\n88\n00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.130\nSo I'm on my computer, it works fine.\n\n89\n00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.880\nBut if I jump over to Jane's computer,\nright,\n\n90\n00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.670\nremember we've got Jane sitting over here.\n\n91\n00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.400\nIf she needs access to a printer, well,\nshe doesn't have that one, right?\n\n92\n00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.390\nAnd I can't just go into her devices and\n\n93\n00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.610\nprinters and add it in, because\nit's not plugged into her computer.\n\n94\n00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.490\nBut, via the network I can share it out,\nand she'll be able to have access to it.\n\n95\n00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.701\nNow, we've been working with Jane's\ncomputer a little bit in this show.\n\n96\n00:04:11.701 --> 00:04:14.461\nIf I browse the network, and\nI take a look at what's out there,\n\n97\n00:04:14.461 --> 00:04:17.138\nshe'll see my computer, right,\nso there's Don Pezet PC.\n\n98\n00:04:17.138 --> 00:04:19.632\nAnd if she goes into it,\nthere's the security folder,\n\n99\n00:04:19.632 --> 00:04:22.300\nstuff that we shared out in\nthe first part, but no printer.\n\n100\n00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.980\nWhen you add a printer to Windows,\nduring the installation,\n\n101\n00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.280\nit actually asks you,\ndo you want to share it out?\n\n102\n00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.610\nAnd if you say yes, your printer\nwould automatically show right here.\n\n103\n00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.010\nBut if you say no, like I did,\nit's not there, and\n\n104\n00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.980\nwe've gotta go turn it on manually.\n\n105\n00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.110\nSo let me show you how we\nturn that on manually.\n\n106\n00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.534\nWhat you do is you take your printer,\nand if you right click on it,\n\n107\n00:04:42.534 --> 00:04:45.105\nright clicking on a printer\nis kind of a weird beast.\n\n108\n00:04:45.105 --> 00:04:48.050\nCuz I'm used to just right clicking\non something and going to properties.\n\n109\n00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.360\nWell here, if you right click and\n\n110\n00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.610\ngo to properties,\nyou get this screen with no options.\n\n111\n00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:53.190\nOkay.\n\n112\n00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.090\nAnd what we're looking at here,\n\n113\n00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.270\nis actually tied to the driver that powers\nthe printer, not the printer itself.\n\n114\n00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.380\nMicrosoft has this weird\nterminology they like.\n\n115\n00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.449\nWhen they talk about a printer,\nthey're actually talking about the driver.\n\n116\n00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.060\nAll right?\nThe software that powers that printer.\n\n117\n00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.460\nWhen you talk about the physical printer,\nMicrosoft calls that a print device.\n\n118\n00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.510\nSo it's a little bit\ndifferent terminology.\n\n119\n00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.000\nAnd so when I right click on the printer,\nI have the properties that I could go to,\n\n120\n00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000\nbut I also have printer properties,\nand that's the one that I really want.\n\n121\n00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.760\nThat's the one that shows me the\nproperties based on the actual hardware of\n\n122\n00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.610\nthat system.\n\n123\n00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.180\nAnd so I can see the system\nthat I'm connected to,\n\n124\n00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.760\nthe ports that it's connected to,\nadvanced settings, color management and\n\n125\n00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.270\nother values that are related\nto that actual print device.\n\n126\n00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.350\nSo this is where we normally want to go.\n\n127\n00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.598\nAnd if you go into that sharing tab,\nyou'll see right here we can share it out.\n\n128\n00:05:42.598 --> 00:05:45.328\nNow if you chose to share it by default,\nit'll already be shared out and\n\n129\n00:05:45.328 --> 00:05:45.930\nthat's that.\n\n130\n00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.620\nBut I didn't choose to share\nit by default, so it's off.\n\n131\n00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.120\nI just need to turn it on.\n\n132\n00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.100\nAnd you can give it a name.\n\n133\n00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.650\nYou an leave it at the default, or\nyou might want to rename it, so\n\n134\n00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.680\nI might call this the Studio Printer.\n\n135\n00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.650\nAnd that way I can tell everybody here\nin the studio, hey if you need to print,\n\n136\n00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.900\nsearch the network, find my computer,\nit's called Studio Printer, add that one.\n\n137\n00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:03.440\nOkay.\n\n138\n00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.820\nAnd so I'm gonna add that one.\n\n139\n00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.360\nAnd see what it says, this right here,\nrender print jobs on all client computers.\n\n140\n00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.530\nRight.\n\n141\n00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.710\nIf we turn this off, there's actually\nsomething kinda neat that happens.\n\n142\n00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.160\nA client will generate the print job,\nand they'll generate it in a raw format.\n\n143\n00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.240\nAnd they'll send it to me.\n\n144\n00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.890\nAnd I'll get it, and\n\n145\n00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.860\nmy computer can then convert it into the\nright format to deliver it to the printer.\n\n146\n00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.690\nAnd that means the other computers\ndon't really have to have a driver.\n\n147\n00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.440\nThey generate the documents raw,\nand they send it over to me.\n\n148\n00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.648\nBut that means my computer's\ngonna have to do some work.\n\n149\n00:06:35.648 --> 00:06:38.632\nAnd if there's a lot of print jobs\ngoing on, I might see my computer get\n\n150\n00:06:38.632 --> 00:06:42.480\nslow because I'm constantly\nrendering other people's print jobs.\n\n151\n00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.910\nSo if we leave this on, the other guys,\nthe other clients that print, like Jane's\n\n152\n00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:52.240\ncomputer, she's gonna render the job\nin the right format for the printer.\n\n153\n00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.160\nAnd that way when I receive that\nprint job, I can just turn around and\n\n154\n00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:56.730\nhand it to the printer.\n\n155\n00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.010\nI don't have to do anything with it.\n\n156\n00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.449\nAnd it really doesn't create any\nperformance hit on my system at all.\n\n157\n00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:04.083\nSo now I can do this and have tons of\npeople printing through my machine, and\n\n158\n00:07:04.083 --> 00:07:05.690\nit's fine.\n\n159\n00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:06.977\nSo we normally want that on, but\n\n160\n00:07:06.977 --> 00:07:09.510\nit's important to understand\nwhat's going on there.\n\n161\n00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:13.370\nWhen you check that option,\nthe people that connect,\n\n162\n00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.970\nthey need to have\nthe right printer driver.\n\n163\n00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.580\nThe printer's not plugged into their\ncomputer, so they don't have the driver.\n\n164\n00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.230\nBut if they connect to my network sharer,\nthey're going to need it.\n\n165\n00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.938\nNow in the olden days, that meant we had\nto go and download the printer driver, and\n\n166\n00:07:24.938 --> 00:07:26.730\nload it on everybody's machine.\n\n167\n00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:29.870\nBut in Windows 8, well really\nin several versions of Windows,\n\n168\n00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.430\nit'll actually automatically\nshare the driver too.\n\n169\n00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:36.560\nSo when we share the printer, we're not\njust sharing the printer by itself.\n\n170\n00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.330\nWe're also sharing the driver.\n\n171\n00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:39.865\nWell, I'm running Windows 8.\n\n172\n00:07:39.865 --> 00:07:42.770\nAnd I'm running Windows 8 64-bit edition.\n\n173\n00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.330\nSo if somebody else is running\nWindows 8 64-bit edition,\n\n174\n00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.380\nI can hand them the driver,\nand they can be ready to go.\n\n175\n00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.048\nBut what if they're running\nWindows 7 32-bit edition?\n\n176\n00:07:51.048 --> 00:07:53.009\nThe driver's not compatible, and so\n\n177\n00:07:53.009 --> 00:07:56.144\nthat's why we have the additional\ndrivers value down here.\n\n178\n00:07:56.144 --> 00:07:57.909\nSee how it's got this\nadditional drivers button?\n\n179\n00:07:57.909 --> 00:08:01.229\nAnd mine is grayed out cuz I'm not\nactually sharing this just yet.\n\n180\n00:08:01.229 --> 00:08:05.870\nSo, we can load more drivers in there for\nother operating systems.\n\n181\n00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:09.490\nFor Vista, Windows XP,\nif you still have some of those.\n\n182\n00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.730\nYou can throw in these other drivers,\nat minimum 64 bit and 32 bit, and\n\n183\n00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:15.620\nthat way people can just\nget the driver from you.\n\n184\n00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.110\nOtherwise, they'll have to\nload the driver, right?\n\n185\n00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:22.090\nNow if I say OK to that,\nit's now going to share that printer out,\n\n186\n00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.840\nand the printer doesn't look any different\nto me, right, but it is shared out.\n\n187\n00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.486\nAnd up top, see these little\nbuttons that are appearing up here,\n\n188\n00:08:29.486 --> 00:08:32.351\nyou've got this print\nserver properties button.\n\n189\n00:08:32.351 --> 00:08:36.160\nAnd if I got into the print server\nproperties, you can go into here and go to\n\n190\n00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.970\ndrivers and it will show all the drivers\nthat I have loaded and I can see that\n\n191\n00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:44.920\nCanon Image Runner Driver Driver right\nthere and I can see that it's 64 bit.\n\n192\n00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:49.734\nIf I know I've got some 32 bit clients\nout there I could add the 32 client\n\n193\n00:08:49.734 --> 00:08:50.584\nright here.\n\n194\n00:08:50.584 --> 00:08:53.252\nI could hit Add and provide it with\nthat driver, and I could do that for\n\n195\n00:08:53.252 --> 00:08:54.274\nevery printer that I had.\n\n196\n00:08:54.274 --> 00:08:57.361\nSo the drivers are right here, and\nI'd share them out with other people.\n\n197\n00:08:57.361 --> 00:08:58.138\nIt really helps.\n\n198\n00:08:58.138 --> 00:08:59.150\nIt's really useful,\n\n199\n00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:03.050\nespecially if you have things like Windows\nRT devices that are arm processors.\n\n200\n00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:05.140\nAnd they need a completely\nseparate driver too, so\n\n201\n00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.280\nyou can preload all those right here.\n\n202\n00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:13.380\nBut assuming you have the right driver,\nwhen it's loaded you're good to go,\n\n203\n00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.300\nthe other person should be able\nto jump over and connect in.\n\n204\n00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:19.570\nNow Jane, she's running a Windows 7\nmachine, but it's 64 bit also, and\n\n205\n00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:22.270\nthe printer driver for this one is\nactually identical between Windows 8 and\n\n206\n00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.210\nWindows 7.\n\n207\n00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:25.930\nSo when she connects I'm not\ngonna have to give her a driver,\n\n208\n00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:28.010\nshe's just gonna get it right from me.\n\n209\n00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.870\nAnd Microsoft calls that click and\nprint, all right?\n\n210\n00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.242\nNo messing around with drivers,\nyou just click on the printer and\n\n211\n00:09:33.242 --> 00:09:34.374\nyou'll be able to print to it.\n\n212\n00:09:34.374 --> 00:09:36.090\nLet me show you how that works.\n\n213\n00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.480\nI jump over to Jane's machine.\n\n214\n00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:39.974\nI'm gonna browse to my network again.\n\n215\n00:09:39.974 --> 00:09:44.267\nSo I'm gonna launch Windows Explorer I'm\ngonna go to Network, and\n\n216\n00:09:44.267 --> 00:09:46.590\nshe sees my computer.\n\n217\n00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.930\nAnd when she browses to it,\nthere's the printer.\n\n218\n00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:50.840\nRight, wasn't there a minute ago,\nnow it is.\n\n219\n00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.915\nAnd if she double clicks on it,\ntwo things happen,\n\n220\n00:09:54.915 --> 00:09:57.755\nfirst off it goes to look for\na driver, and it found it.\n\n221\n00:09:57.755 --> 00:10:00.585\nIt found the driver on my machine so,\nit's offering to install it.\n\n222\n00:10:00.585 --> 00:10:03.545\nAnd you'll see it's coming\nfrom //donepezet-PC.\n\n223\n00:10:03.545 --> 00:10:05.735\nThat's part of the click and\nprint functionality.\n\n224\n00:10:05.735 --> 00:10:08.079\nSo, I'm gonna hit install driver and\nit's gonna load it in.\n\n225\n00:10:08.079 --> 00:10:10.345\nI don't have to go out to the Internet and\ndownload it.\n\n226\n00:10:10.345 --> 00:10:14.105\nI can just load it right here and\nthen up comes my printer queue.\n\n227\n00:10:14.105 --> 00:10:16.470\nShe's now connected to the printer,\nall right?\n\n228\n00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:20.440\nIf it looked to me and I didn't have the\ndriver, then she'd get a prompt saying,\n\n229\n00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.640\nall right you got to provide a driver.\n\n230\n00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.680\nAnd we'd have to download it from\nthe Internet and all of that, right?\n\n231\n00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.300\nBut now, she's got that printer and for\n\n232\n00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:31.450\nnow on, if she ever wants to print that\nprinters there and waiting for her.\n\n233\n00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:33.020\nIf she goes into her Devices and\n\n234\n00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:37.600\nPrinter screen,\nits gonna show up in there right here.\n\n235\n00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.860\nCannon image runner advanced\nC7065 on DonPezet-PC.\n\n236\n00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.730\nShe can reboot, it'll still be there.\n\n237\n00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:44.640\nSo for now on she can print.\n\n238\n00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.466\nShe can just set it as her default, hey\nmaybe that's what I want to print to now.\n\n239\n00:10:49.466 --> 00:10:50.630\nAnd now oop!\n\n240\n00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:53.190\nIt loaded the custom icon\nhow fancy is that, huh?\n\n241\n00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:57.217\nSo now she can print to that whenever she\nwants and that's her default printer.\n\n242\n00:10:57.217 --> 00:10:59.169\nAnd then it comes out on\nthis physical printer and\n\n243\n00:10:59.169 --> 00:11:02.278\nshe'll probably forget that it's even\ngoing through my computer, right?\n\n244\n00:11:02.278 --> 00:11:05.207\nAnd she just knows she sends her printer\nup to it, it comes out on that printer and\n\n245\n00:11:05.207 --> 00:11:06.270\nshe's done and that's it.\n\n246\n00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.460\nThat's kinda the joy of\ndoing printer sharing.\n\n247\n00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.690\n>> Now Don, what's really cool about\nthis is if I'm following you correctly,\n\n248\n00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:16.380\nif we're running the print server on,\nexcuse me, [COUGH] on our system, and\n\n249\n00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:17.730\nwe don't have that driver.\n\n250\n00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:19.531\nWe gotta go get it, we gotta load it up so\n\n251\n00:11:19.531 --> 00:11:22.441\nthat the users out there can get\nthat driver for their systems.\n\n252\n00:11:22.441 --> 00:11:25.149\nBut if I'm the user, I'm looking for\na printer to attach to, and\n\n253\n00:11:25.149 --> 00:11:27.613\nI don't have the driver, and\nthey don't have the driver,\n\n254\n00:11:27.613 --> 00:11:30.224\nwell then I still have the option\nof going out to the Internet and\n\n255\n00:11:30.224 --> 00:11:33.530\ndownloading it myself, if I have\nthe wherewithal to make that happen.\n\n256\n00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:36.969\nAnd then I don't have to worry about\ncontacting you if I'm trying to connect to\n\n257\n00:11:36.969 --> 00:11:38.440\nyour computer and your printer.\n\n258\n00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.220\nI just get that driver myself and\nI'm off to the races.\n\n259\n00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.270\n>> That's right.\nThe only time that's a challenge\n\n260\n00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.050\nis if the user isn't an administrator\non their own machine.\n\n261\n00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:50.055\nIf they're not an administrator, like\nmaybe Jane is a lower level employee and\n\n262\n00:11:50.055 --> 00:11:51.235\nso she doesn't have administrative access.\n\n263\n00:11:51.235 --> 00:11:53.845\nShe's not giving me a lot of\ninstalled drivers is she?\n\n264\n00:11:53.845 --> 00:11:57.476\nSo, that creates a problem, but,\nwith click and print, it'll do it.\n\n265\n00:11:57.476 --> 00:11:58.868\nThe drivers a part of our system,\n\n266\n00:11:58.868 --> 00:12:02.249\nespecially if you have like a domain in\nplace, but in this scenario she is admin,\n\n267\n00:12:02.249 --> 00:12:04.310\nshe just installed the driver and\nthat's that.\n\n268\n00:12:05.478 --> 00:12:10.020\nAll right, now what she has\nis permission to print, but\n\n269\n00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.460\nthere's other printer permissions\nthat we need to be aware of, okay.\n\n270\n00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:17.740\nWhen you share a printer, you can set\nthe level of access that somebody has.\n\n271\n00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:20.660\nI'm going to go back into my devices and\nprinters and\n\n272\n00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:23.780\nI'm going to go down to that printer and\npull its properties back up.\n\n273\n00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:28.230\nSo when I right click on that printer I'm\ngonna go down here to Printer Properties,\n\n274\n00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:29.860\nand I'm gonna go to Sharing.\n\n275\n00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:34.200\nAnd under Sharing, here's where I\nshared it out, and I don't see any\n\n276\n00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.230\nspecial permissions or settings or\nanything like that here, right.\n\n277\n00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:42.220\nBut if I keep going across the tab,\nway over here, I've got security.\n\n278\n00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:45.230\nAnd here's where I can dictate\nwho's allowed to do what.\n\n279\n00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.784\nSo right now I can see that Don Pezet,\nI'm allowed to do whatever I want, right.\n\n280\n00:12:49.784 --> 00:12:53.319\nI can have full control over\nthis printer but everyone,\n\n281\n00:12:53.319 --> 00:12:55.810\nthis is what Jane falls under, right?\n\n282\n00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:58.960\nEveryone, she can print and that's it.\n\n283\n00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.210\nWhat are these four permissions?\n\n284\n00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:03.533\nWe've got Print, Manage this printer,\nManage documents and\n\n285\n00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:05.260\nSpecial permissions, right?\n\n286\n00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.100\nSpecial permissions are when we go into\nthe advanced, the customization stuff.\n\n287\n00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:10.084\nOn the exam we need to know\nthe first three, right.\n\n288\n00:13:10.084 --> 00:13:12.560\nPrint, you can print a document.\n\n289\n00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.700\nThat's normally what we want.\n\n290\n00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.690\nSo when we share something out,\nwe want to let people print to it and\n\n291\n00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:17.960\nit's sent to everyone by default.\n\n292\n00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:23.060\nIf I just want to make it Jane and\nthat's it,\n\n293\n00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:27.858\nI could come and remove everyone and\nI could add Jane.\n\n294\n00:13:27.858 --> 00:13:31.503\nSo I'm gonna Add her to the list,\nright, so there's Jane, and\n\n295\n00:13:31.503 --> 00:13:34.608\nnow just Jane can print, and\nadministrators and me and\n\n296\n00:13:34.608 --> 00:13:37.970\nwhoever the creator was,\nwhich in this case was me.\n\n297\n00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:40.570\nAnd, all application packages, so\n\n298\n00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.570\nthose are the other application\napplications that are running.\n\n299\n00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:43.381\nWe're allowing them to print, right?\n\n300\n00:13:43.381 --> 00:13:45.580\nBut Jane, she's the only user\nthat I've added, all right.\n\n301\n00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.560\nNow print is fine for more people.\n\n302\n00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.820\nIf she prints a job and\nit gets stuck she can cancel it,\n\n303\n00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.070\nshe can send a print job whenever.\n\n304\n00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:57.740\nBut there's some other neat things\nthat you can do with print jobs.\n\n305\n00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.638\nIf you print five or\nten different things and\n\n306\n00:13:59.638 --> 00:14:02.985\nother people are printing at the same\ntime, every print job gets a priority.\n\n307\n00:14:02.985 --> 00:14:05.920\nSome print jobs can be more\nimportant than others.\n\n308\n00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.080\nAnd so we might want Jane to be able\nto adjust those print priorities.\n\n309\n00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.140\nWell she's not allowed\nto do that by default.\n\n310\n00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:14.510\nShe can only print and\ncancel her own jobs.\n\n311\n00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:18.050\nBut if I give her managed\ndocuments permission,\n\n312\n00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:23.440\nmanage documents, now, she can pause and\ncancel other people's jobs.\n\n313\n00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.620\nAnd she can re-prioritize them\nto make her's more important, or\n\n314\n00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:28.810\nmake other people's more\nimportant on this printer.\n\n315\n00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:31.390\nSo, if several people are waiting in\nline she can manipulate that, right?\n\n316\n00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:34.900\nSo, that gives her more of like\nadministrative privileges on the printer.\n\n317\n00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:40.333\nAnd then manage this printer\nthat's the full total control.\n\n318\n00:14:40.333 --> 00:14:42.260\nShe'll be able to change permissions.\n\n319\n00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:43.833\nShe could give somebody\npermission to print or\n\n320\n00:14:43.833 --> 00:14:45.600\nremove somebody's permission to print.\n\n321\n00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.770\nShe could unshare the printer and\ntake it offline entirely, all right.\n\n322\n00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:50.030\nThat gives her full access.\n\n323\n00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:53.680\nSo I dictate right here,\nwhat level of control I want her to have.\n\n324\n00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.690\nNow be careful on the exam\nbecause on the file permissions,\n\n325\n00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:58.850\nthey're kind of in order.\n\n326\n00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:00.536\nWhere the lowest level\npermission is at the top and\n\n327\n00:15:00.536 --> 00:15:02.157\nthe highest level permission\nis at the bottom.\n\n328\n00:15:02.157 --> 00:15:04.892\nSo read only is the first thing listed and\nthen it gets more and more and\n\n329\n00:15:04.892 --> 00:15:06.410\nmore advanced as you go down the line.\n\n330\n00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:08.820\nHere they're kind of out of order.\n\n331\n00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:12.898\nManage this printer is the highest level\nof permission, Manage documents is\n\n332\n00:15:12.898 --> 00:15:17.491\nactually after that, so just remember for\nthe exam, that the first one here, Print.\n\n333\n00:15:17.491 --> 00:15:19.800\nThat one's your print, easy.\n\n334\n00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.280\nManage this printer,\n\n335\n00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:25.690\nthat lets you control the printer itself,\neverything about that printer.\n\n336\n00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:29.670\nAnd then Manage documents,\nthat just lets you manipulate yours and\n\n337\n00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:32.120\nother people's documents\nthat are out there, right?\n\n338\n00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.610\nSo those are some of the different\nsettings that we have when it comes to\n\n339\n00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:35.820\nprinter sharing.\n\n340\n00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.893\nJust be aware that when you\nload these printers up,\n\n341\n00:15:38.893 --> 00:15:41.043\nthe default is everyone can print.\n\n342\n00:15:41.043 --> 00:15:42.999\nAnd that might be fine, but\nyou might wanna come and\n\n343\n00:15:42.999 --> 00:15:45.380\nmanipulate these permissions, all right?\n\n344\n00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:49.430\nThe other thing to think about is that\nwhen I print to this printer I have my own\n\n345\n00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:51.215\nprinting preferences, right?\n\n346\n00:15:51.215 --> 00:15:55.549\nIf I right click on the printer and go to\nPrinting Preferences I'll see whether I\n\n347\n00:15:55.549 --> 00:15:59.236\ndefault to portrait or landscape,\nwhether I flip on the long edge,\n\n348\n00:15:59.236 --> 00:16:02.685\nwhat my paper quality,\nwhether I'm color or black and white.\n\n349\n00:16:02.685 --> 00:16:04.133\nI can set that, right?\n\n350\n00:16:04.133 --> 00:16:07.152\nWell, Jane can set that too.\n\n351\n00:16:07.152 --> 00:16:11.295\nAnd on her system, she can come in\nhere and pull up the properties.\n\n352\n00:16:11.295 --> 00:16:12.434\nOh, not the properties.\n\n353\n00:16:12.434 --> 00:16:14.151\nShe can pull up the printer properties.\n\n354\n00:16:14.151 --> 00:16:15.231\n>> And it's easy to do.\n\n355\n00:16:15.231 --> 00:16:16.920\n>> It is,\nit's important to get the right one.\n\n356\n00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.370\nOh, I don't even want\nthe printer properties.\n\n357\n00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:19.750\nI want the printing preferences, right?\n\n358\n00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:21.730\nSo I'm gonna go under\nprinting preferences.\n\n359\n00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.150\nAnd she can choose portrait or landscape.\n\n360\n00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.520\nShe can choose color or black and white.\n\n361\n00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.680\nNow let's say on hers\nshe chooses black and\n\n362\n00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:32.650\nwhite, she wants to print\nin landscape by default.\n\n363\n00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:36.990\nAnd for her paper quality maybe she's\nused to printing from the manual feed.\n\n364\n00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:38.890\nSo she's gonna set these\nas her default settings.\n\n365\n00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:44.930\nWell on my side, let me just cancel out of\nthis, if I pull those printing preferences\n\n366\n00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:50.270\nback up, well, we can jump in here,\nand notice I'm still in portrait.\n\n367\n00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.030\nAnd if I go under paper quality,\nI'm still automatic,\n\n368\n00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:53.600\nit's like I'm still color, right?\n\n369\n00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.080\nYour printing preferences are maintained\nlocally on your computer.\n\n370\n00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.675\nSo she can have completely\ndifferent preferences from me,\n\n371\n00:16:59.675 --> 00:17:01.810\nad that's perfectly fine, right?\n\n372\n00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:04.970\nWe're sharing the same printer,\nbut she has different preferences.\n\n373\n00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:09.270\nSo, the printer preferences\nthat we set here don't apply to\n\n374\n00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:10.810\nthe other people that are connecting.\n\n375\n00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:12.890\nAnd that can be challenging sometimes.\n\n376\n00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:16.130\nLike, let's say that you didn't\nbuy your printer outright,\n\n377\n00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:17.930\nlet's say that you got it on a lease.\n\n378\n00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:22.260\nAnd, when you lease a printer, a lot\nof businesses do this, they might pay\n\n379\n00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:26.730\none rate for black and white copies,\nand a different rate for color copies.\n\n380\n00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:28.912\nSo when you print color,\nit might cost more money.\n\n381\n00:17:28.912 --> 00:17:31.680\nSo you want people to print black and\nwhite by default.\n\n382\n00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.818\nWell, what did Jane's computer default to?\n\n383\n00:17:33.818 --> 00:17:35.980\nIt defaulted to color.\n\n384\n00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.630\nMicrosoft assumes that you want to\ntake advantage of every feature\n\n385\n00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:39.940\non your printer, but,\n\n386\n00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:44.290\nin a printer leased you might not\nwant that, so be careful with that.\n\n387\n00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:48.560\nJust because yours is set to black and\nwhite doesn't mean that everybody else is.\n\n388\n00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.080\nAnd so\nwe'll need to make sure that gets set.\n\n389\n00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.620\nAnd in a small network,\nin like a home network,\n\n390\n00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.980\nyou can just go to each machine and\nset that.\n\n391\n00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:58.737\nBut in a business, we're normally gonna\nuse something like a group policy object\n\n392\n00:17:58.737 --> 00:18:02.668\nto set it across our environment,\nand that makes life a lot easier.\n\n393\n00:18:02.668 --> 00:18:04.880\nIf you wanna learn about that,\nwe do that in the MCSA shows,\n\n394\n00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.300\nto kind of show how to set those up.\n\n395\n00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:10.316\nBut here for the MTA we just need to\nbe aware that those settings aren't\n\n396\n00:18:10.316 --> 00:18:12.441\ntracked across machines like that.\n\n397\n00:18:12.441 --> 00:18:18.060\nAll right, the other thing is when\nJane prints, she's gonna print.\n\n398\n00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:20.230\nIt is gonna go to her\nlocal print queue for\n\n399\n00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:22.460\njust a moment while it\nbuilds the print job.\n\n400\n00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:25.387\nAnd then it's gonna cross\nthe network to my machine.\n\n401\n00:18:25.387 --> 00:18:28.850\nAnd it's gonna go into my\nprint queue on my machine.\n\n402\n00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:31.250\nAnd then from there,\nI'm gonna send it to the real printer.\n\n403\n00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:34.260\nSo when people print,\nif I pull up my print queue,\n\n404\n00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:37.070\nI'm going to see everybody's\njobs that are in there.\n\n405\n00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:39.190\nMine, Jane's, everybody else.\n\n406\n00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:43.536\nWell if Jane pulls up the print queue,\nif she goes in here and pulls it up,\n\n407\n00:18:43.536 --> 00:18:46.262\nwell she's going to see\nmy print queue also.\n\n408\n00:18:46.262 --> 00:18:46.895\nFor these users,\n\n409\n00:18:46.895 --> 00:18:50.230\nthey don't actually see the local queue\nbecause the local queue's only temporary.\n\n410\n00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.500\nThe data just passes right through,\nover the network, to me.\n\n411\n00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.890\nRight?\nSo it's the server,\n\n412\n00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:59.010\nin this case my workstation, that really\nhas the queue that's important, right?\n\n413\n00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:02.700\nJobs can get stuck in there, I can shut\nmy computer down or do a Windows update,\n\n414\n00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:03.430\nthings break.\n\n415\n00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:05.000\nIt does happen.\n\n416\n00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.470\nBut in that case,\nthey would be stuck on my computer.\n\n417\n00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:10.300\nAnd the next time I reboot it or fixed\nthe problem, then they would print out and\n\n418\n00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:11.870\ngo out to the actual physical printer.\n\n419\n00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:14.790\n>> So a user would have to wait for\nyou to actually take action.\n\n420\n00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:17.590\nIf something went wrong it'd be\nup to Don to make it happen.\n\n421\n00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:18.090\n>> Yeah.\n>> Oh.\n\n422\n00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:19.692\n>> Yeah, that's basically it.\n\n423\n00:19:19.692 --> 00:19:22.165\nAll right, that's basically it for\n\n424\n00:19:22.165 --> 00:19:23.690\nprinter sharing.\n\n425\n00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:26.930\nJust remember that when you share out\na printer there's all the other advanced\n\n426\n00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:27.975\nprinter settings you've got available.\n\n427\n00:19:27.975 --> 00:19:29.985\nWell and\nthey still apply when you do sharing.\n\n428\n00:19:29.985 --> 00:19:34.125\nSo if you set up things like print\npooling or other crazy stuff like that,\n\n429\n00:19:34.125 --> 00:19:37.805\nthose still apply and they work fine,\nwhether the printer is shared or not.\n\n430\n00:19:37.805 --> 00:19:39.765\nAnd you can always go and\nunshare the printer.\n\n431\n00:19:39.765 --> 00:19:40.645\nIf you don't want it to be out there,\n\n432\n00:19:40.645 --> 00:19:43.342\nyou can remove it,\nyou got a lot of different options.\n\n433\n00:19:43.342 --> 00:19:46.032\nIn this day and age you're more likely\nto see network attached printers so\n\n434\n00:19:46.032 --> 00:19:48.152\nyou don't necessarily do\nthis as much anymore.\n\n435\n00:19:48.152 --> 00:19:49.332\nBut there's still a use for it and\n\n436\n00:19:49.332 --> 00:19:52.432\nit's really not any different\nthan sharing a file.\n\n437\n00:19:52.432 --> 00:19:54.200\nIn fact it uses the same software.\n\n438\n00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.720\nThat's why when we\nenabled sharing earlier,\n\n439\n00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:01.020\nit didn't just say enabling sharing,\nit said enable file and print sharing.\n\n440\n00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:02.930\nLet me show you guys where that is.\n\n441\n00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:07.330\nIf we go down to the, let me jump back\nover to Windows 8 and get in the right\n\n442\n00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:13.440\nspot [LAUGH] So here in Windows 8,\nthere's a few ways to get to it I guess.\n\n443\n00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.510\nThe easiest way is in the bottom right\ncorner of the screen where our system\n\n444\n00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:21.605\nclock is and all that other stuff, you'll\nsee your network icon right down there.\n\n445\n00:20:21.605 --> 00:20:25.525\nAnd if you right-click on that you can\ngo to Open Network and Sharing Center.\n\n446\n00:20:25.525 --> 00:20:27.565\nAnd this is gonna bring us to\nthe Network and Sharing Center, and\n\n447\n00:20:27.565 --> 00:20:30.915\nyou'll see where you can set\nup your connections and so on.\n\n448\n00:20:30.915 --> 00:20:35.245\nAnd in here you've got your\nchange advanced sharing settings.\n\n449\n00:20:35.245 --> 00:20:37.985\nAnd you can go in there, and\nthis is where we turn on our sharing,\n\n450\n00:20:37.985 --> 00:20:39.175\nwhere we turn on network discovery.\n\n451\n00:20:39.175 --> 00:20:42.285\nAnd then here's where we turn on file and\nprinter sharing, and\n\n452\n00:20:42.285 --> 00:20:43.935\nsee how they're tied together?\n\n453\n00:20:43.935 --> 00:20:47.476\nYou can't turn on just file sharing and\nnot printer sharing.\n\n454\n00:20:47.476 --> 00:20:50.085\nAnd you can't turn on just printer\nsharing and not file sharing and\n\n455\n00:20:50.085 --> 00:20:52.530\nthat's because they work together, right.\n\n456\n00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:54.660\nIf you don't want to share printers,\njust don't share them out.\n\n457\n00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.099\nProblem solved, right?\n\n458\n00:20:56.099 --> 00:21:00.676\nBut when you share a printer, It needs\nfile sharing to that driver exchange, and\n\n459\n00:21:00.676 --> 00:21:03.705\nit needs file sharing to do\nthe print queue exchange,\n\n460\n00:21:03.705 --> 00:21:06.426\nto transmit jobs between\nthe printers queues.\n\n461\n00:21:06.426 --> 00:21:09.166\nIt needs that, so it's tied to it.\n\n462\n00:21:09.166 --> 00:21:11.592\nFile sharing doesn't need\nthe printer sub-system, but\n\n463\n00:21:11.592 --> 00:21:13.919\nfile sharing is what powers\nthe printer sharing, and so\n\n464\n00:21:13.919 --> 00:21:17.570\nthat's why they're tied together, and\nyou turn them both on or off together.\n\n465\n00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:19.963\nAll right, so that option is\nkind of buried away right there.\n\n466\n00:21:19.963 --> 00:21:22.992\n>> Now Don, what if we have a user that\ngets drunk with printing power, and\n\n467\n00:21:22.992 --> 00:21:25.632\nthey're just sending print jobs,\nprint jobs, print jobs.\n\n468\n00:21:25.632 --> 00:21:28.950\nThey're printing everything under the sun,\nkind of breaking the rules as it were.\n\n469\n00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:31.980\nThe etiquettes as it is\nwhen you're printing stuff,\n\n470\n00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.040\nespecially in a shared printer.\n\n471\n00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.730\nYou don't want people\neating up all the paper,\n\n472\n00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:37.850\neating up all the ink on\nsuperfluous print jobs.\n\n473\n00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:39.750\nIs there anyway for\nus to be able to stop them,\n\n474\n00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:41.505\nespecially if we're sharing to a group?\n\n475\n00:21:41.505 --> 00:21:42.306\n>> You can fire them.\n\n476\n00:21:42.306 --> 00:21:43.926\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There's that.\n\n477\n00:21:43.926 --> 00:21:44.777\n[LAUGH]\n>> There is that.\n\n478\n00:21:44.777 --> 00:21:48.250\n>> There's all sorts of different\nthings you can do inside of a printer.\n\n479\n00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:51.280\nThe easiest thing is if you wanna cut off\ntheir printing privileges altogether,\n\n480\n00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.070\nyou can just remove their permissions.\n\n481\n00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:55.300\nThat's one route to go.\n\n482\n00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:59.210\nAnother route is,\nremember how I said Microsoft,\n\n483\n00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:01.420\na printer to them is\nactually a logical item.\n\n484\n00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:02.950\nA printer is your driver.\n\n485\n00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:06.240\nAnd that behind the driver you have\na print device, a physical device.\n\n486\n00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.420\nYou can create more than one printer\n\n487\n00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:13.310\nthat points to the same physical printer,\nright?\n\n488\n00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:14.480\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n489\n00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:19.470\nSo if I go into my devices and\nprinters, and\n\n490\n00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:23.790\nlets say that I create some all\nnew printer in here, right.\n\n491\n00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:28.880\nI'm gonna add a printer, and I don't\nwanna do that, that's adding devices,\n\n492\n00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.810\nI wanna add a printer, there we go.\n\n493\n00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:32.500\nAnd, I'm just manually\ngonna pick a printer,\n\n494\n00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.160\ncause I don't have another one\nto use as an example here.\n\n495\n00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.000\nSo I'll add a printer, and\nmaybe it's a network printer.\n\n496\n00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:42.640\nAnd we'll punch in,\nactually you know what?\n\n497\n00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:43.510\nWe can pull Tim's.\n\n498\n00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:45.605\nI'm going to grab Tim's\nprinter he'll love it.\n\n499\n00:22:45.605 --> 00:22:47.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we'll reach out and\n\n500\n00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.100\nwe'll add Tim's printer to my computer.\n\n501\n00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.610\nAnd so I'm going to get this added.\n\n502\n00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:53.240\nNotice how it's tied to an IP address.\n\n503\n00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.160\nThat's a physical printer that's out\nthere on the network, and I'm going\n\n504\n00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:59.440\nto add it here to my system, so it's going\nto be represented as a single entity.\n\n505\n00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.430\nThere it is.\n\n506\n00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:02.720\nTim HP Laser blah blah blah, right?\n\n507\n00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:07.560\nI'm gonna rename that, and\nI'm gonna call that my executives.\n\n508\n00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:11.560\nThis is going to be my executives printer,\nall right.\n\n509\n00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.780\nAnd I'm gonna share that out\nas the executives printer and\n\n510\n00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:15.820\nthat's what I'm gonna call it, right.\n\n511\n00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:20.340\nSo, I'll finish that up, and\nI'm not gonna set it as my default, right.\n\n512\n00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:23.340\nWhat I can do is, now that I've got\nthat executives printer set up.\n\n513\n00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:26.450\nI can add a second printer,\nI can add another printer.\n\n514\n00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:29.700\nAnd, this time I'm just gonna\npoint it right to Tim's again.\n\n515\n00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.940\nI've already got Tim's, but\nI'm gonna add it again.\n\n516\n00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:35.480\nI'm adding that same printer, and\n\n517\n00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:40.220\nwhen I add this one in,\nI'm gonna give a different name.\n\n518\n00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:42.300\nSo maybe I call this one employees.\n\n519\n00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:45.930\nSo my executives can print to one printer,\nmy employees print to the other.\n\n520\n00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:48.110\nNow, at the end of the day\nit's using the same driver.\n\n521\n00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:50.090\nSee, it's prompting me right there,\ndo I want to use the same driver?\n\n522\n00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:53.488\nI do, and I'll call this employees,\nall right?\n\n523\n00:23:53.488 --> 00:23:56.507\nSo these are both going to\nthe same physical printer,\n\n524\n00:23:56.507 --> 00:23:59.780\nto the same physical print device, right?\n\n525\n00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:04.459\nBut now I've got two software\nrepresentations of the same printer.\n\n526\n00:24:04.459 --> 00:24:07.640\nAnd they're shared out and\nI can go an change the permissions.\n\n527\n00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:10.570\nI can modify the permissions\non the executives printer.\n\n528\n00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:14.720\nSo, if I go into my printer properties,\nand I go to sharing, I could set, or\n\n529\n00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.550\ngo into security, sorry.\n\n530\n00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:18.360\nI could set it so that only\nexecutives could print to this one.\n\n531\n00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.840\nAnd then I could go to the other one and\nset it so\n\n532\n00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.540\nthat employees can go to that one.\n\n533\n00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:25.350\nSo now I've kind of restricted\nthem to the separate printers.\n\n534\n00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:29.900\nAnd once that's done, I can start\nmodifying the settings on these printers.\n\n535\n00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:34.750\nAnd so on the executives printer,\nI might go into my printer properties and\n\n536\n00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:39.820\nI might start changing certain things\nin here like their priority,okay.\n\n537\n00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.960\nWhen you set a priority, I just\npulled up the printer properties and\n\n538\n00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:43.720\nwent to the advanced tab.\n\n539\n00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:48.190\nYou can set the priority and I can say\nthat executives are priority number one.\n\n540\n00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:51.440\nAnd then I can take employees and\nset them to priority 100.\n\n541\n00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:56.841\nAnd now, when an executive prints, their\njob will jump to the front of the line.\n\n542\n00:24:56.841 --> 00:25:00.178\nNow it won't interrupt somebody\nwho's in the process of printing,\n\n543\n00:25:00.178 --> 00:25:03.530\nlike it won't stop on page seven and\nlet the executive cut in.\n\n544\n00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:06.450\nBut as soon as that job finishes,\nthe executive is next, right.\n\n545\n00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:08.000\nSo we can kind of prioritize like that.\n\n546\n00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.750\nThese are ways that you can manipulate it\nso that different people have different\n\n547\n00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:13.360\nexperiences, even though they're\nprinting to the same physical printer.\n\n548\n00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.620\nAnd there's a lot of other stuff you can\ndo to treat these settings like setting\n\n549\n00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:19.000\nthem to be only available\nfrom certain times.\n\n550\n00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.700\nSo, if you have an employee who's\ncoming in on the weekends and printing,\n\n551\n00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.850\nyou could cut that out real easy\nby limiting it just to work hours.\n\n552\n00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:28.480\nAnd now if they wanna print some of that\nextra junk like Daniel was talking about,\n\n553\n00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.730\nyou'll see it cuz they gotta to\ndo it during work hours right?\n\n554\n00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:34.245\nSo those are advanced settings that\nwe can define on the printer and\n\n555\n00:25:34.245 --> 00:25:35.930\nthey apply to the shares.\n\n556\n00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:39.627\nAnd you can define more than one share\nbased on the same physical printers.\n\n557\n00:25:39.627 --> 00:25:43.700\nKind of a neat little technique there to\nreally customize a print environment.\n\n558\n00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.190\n>> Very cool stuff, Don.\n\n559\n00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:48.799\nI guess have we thought of anything else\nthat we need to talk about when it comes\n\n560\n00:25:48.799 --> 00:25:49.900\nto these printers?\n\n561\n00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:52.070\n>> Well, on printers, that's it.\n\n562\n00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:55.775\nI do have more I need to talk about it,\nI said at the beginning of the show there\n\n563\n00:25:55.775 --> 00:25:58.640\nwas some advanced stuff behind file\nsharing I wanted to talk about.\n\n564\n00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:02.560\nI kind of rambled on too long,\nDaniel, so, you know what that means?\n\n565\n00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:03.673\n>> Part three?\n>> Part three, yeah.\n\n566\n00:26:03.673 --> 00:26:04.844\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n567\n00:26:04.844 --> 00:26:06.632\nwe're definitely gonna do\na part three on this one,\n\n568\n00:26:06.632 --> 00:26:08.964\nbecause I need to get to the advanced\nstuff on sharing permissions.\n\n569\n00:26:08.964 --> 00:26:10.138\nSo yeah, let's wrap this one up and\n\n570\n00:26:10.138 --> 00:26:11.870\nwe'll just pick up with\nanother episode from here.\n\n571\n00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:12.690\n>> Awesome.\n\n572\n00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:14.620\nWell hopefully,\nyou guys have enjoyed this episode.\n\n573\n00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.570\nPrinting, sharing is something\nthat you might wanna do.\n\n574\n00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:17.950\nWe're gonna go ahead and wrap it up.\n\n575\n00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:21.140\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lawry.\n\n576\n00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:21.790\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n577\n00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.278\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n578\n00:26:23.278 --> 00:26:23.778\n[SOUND]\n\n",

another fantastic\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.090\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.740\nHere with me, none other than Mr.\nDon Pezet himself.\n\n6\n00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:21.660\nHow's it going today, Don?\n\n7\n00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.720\n>> It is going great, Daniel.\n\n8\n00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.830\nBack for the unexpected.\n\n9\n00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.000\nPart three of File and Printer Sharing.\n\n10\n00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.170\nI've rambled on for too long,\nfor several episodes now.\n\n11\n00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.900\nSo we're going into\npart three on this one.\n\n12\n00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.380\nWe need to take a look at some of\nthe advanced things that go on behind\n\n13\n00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.680\nthe scenes when it comes to file and\nprinter sharing.\n\n14\n00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.410\nAnd this is the episode for\nus to tackle it.\n\n15\n00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.050\nI promise, this time.\n\n16\n00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.163\nWe'll wrap it up after this,\nand we won't do a part four.\n\n17\n00:00:42.163 --> 00:00:43.361\n>> Shut your fat yap.\n\n18\n00:00:43.361 --> 00:00:44.220\n[LAUGH]\n>> I know.\n\n19\n00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.335\n[LAUGH] Famous last words.\n\n20\n00:00:45.335 --> 00:00:47.552\n>> That's right.\n>> In the previous two episodes,\n\n21\n00:00:47.552 --> 00:00:51.808\nwe took a look at sharing folders on\nthe network, and we took a look at sharing\n\n22\n00:00:51.808 --> 00:00:55.540\nprinters on the network, and\nAnd it worked out really good.\n\n23\n00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.700\nBut one thing that we didn't\ntalk about was sharing folders\n\n24\n00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.950\njust between users on the same computer,\nright?\n\n25\n00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.140\nWhat if it's not on the network?\n\n26\n00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.840\nWhat if I don't even have a network?\n\n27\n00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.340\nI have a computer that I\nshare with other people, and\n\n28\n00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.990\nI wanna have a folder that's\navailable to both of us.\n\n29\n00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.070\nWell, there's a couple of\neasy ways to do that, right?\n\n30\n00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.510\nBut the key thing to remember is\nthat when you're sharing folders\n\n31\n00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.000\njust locally on a machine to\nanother user on the same machine,\n\n32\n00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.950\nit doesn't actually use\nthe Windows share system.\n\n33\n00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.390\nSo that share system that we\nsaw with the permissions and\n\n34\n00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.840\nall that,\nthat only applies to network users.\n\n35\n00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.030\nIf somebody comes and\nsits down right on your computer and\n\n36\n00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.680\nthey login, those permissions,\nthey don't apply.\n\n37\n00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.210\nSo somebody might have read-only\npermissions on the network, and\n\n38\n00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.920\nthey sit down on your computer and\nnow they've got a lot more access.\n\n39\n00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.210\nSo we need to be able to control that\naccess right on a single machine and\n\n40\n00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.010\nthat's something that we didn't\n\n41\n00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.000\nse on the earlier episodes that\nI wanted to point out here.\n\n42\n00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.230\nAnd there's some important reasons why.\n\n43\n00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.510\nYou'll see a little later in the episode.\n\n44\n00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.530\nBut let's just get started\nwith that kinda scenario.\n\n45\n00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.340\nI wanna create a folder right here on\nthis machine and make it available for\n\n46\n00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.920\nmore than one person, all right.\n\n47\n00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.590\nNow, I've already got folders\ninside of my user profile.\n\n48\n00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.530\nWe've seen those, right.\n\n49\n00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.300\nIn my Documents folder,\nI had that Security folder I shared out,\n\n50\n00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.520\nand I made that available on\nthe network this is in my user profile.\n\n51\n00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.500\nAnd I don't want to necessarily want other\nusers to have to browse into my profile to\n\n52\n00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.640\nget to this stuff.\n\n53\n00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.350\nSo I might want create a folder that's\nsomewhere that's a little more central to\n\n54\n00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.140\nmy network, to my computer.\n\n55\n00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.010\nIf I go to this PC I've got my C\ndrive right, this is my hard drive.\n\n56\n00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.780\nOr I've got other hard\ndrives on my system,\n\n57\n00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.910\nlike I've got my F drive down here that\nis NTFS, so I can browse into that and\n\n58\n00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.780\ncreate a folder there, or browse into\nmy C drive and create the folder there.\n\n59\n00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.410\nI'll do it on my C drive.\n\n60\n00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.969\nSo I'll come in here just say New > Folder\nand I'll call this Shared Documents.\n\n61\n00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:47.898\nRight, so these are gonna be ones that I\nwanna make available to everybody in my\n\n62\n00:02:47.898 --> 00:02:48.860\ncomputer, okay.\n\n63\n00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.112\nAnd these might be sales documents,\nor whatever.\n\n64\n00:02:51.112 --> 00:02:55.648\nNow, when you create that folder,\nyou can start putting documents in there.\n\n65\n00:02:55.648 --> 00:02:57.954\nSo I can start adding in whatever I want.\n\n66\n00:02:57.954 --> 00:03:02.070\nI'll just add some fake documents in\nhere to get something in there, and\n\n67\n00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.060\neach one of these are being created and\nput in the folder.\n\n68\n00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.770\nSo in theory, I should be able to log in\nas another user, browse in this folder and\n\n69\n00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.430\naccess the files, right?\n\n70\n00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.470\nWell, not necessarily.\n\n71\n00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.480\nWhen you create files in your hard drive,\n\n72\n00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.170\nthere's a different set of\npermissions that are applied.\n\n73\n00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.970\nWe have what are called NTFS permissions.\n\n74\n00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.422\nWhen you format your hard drive as NTFS,\nthis is default in Windows,\n\n75\n00:03:24.422 --> 00:03:26.100\nyou get a permissions sublayer.\n\n76\n00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.335\nAnd what that permissions sublayer\ndoes is when you create a folder,\n\n77\n00:03:29.335 --> 00:03:31.210\nwe're gonna make it just for you.\n\n78\n00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.850\nIt's your folder, right?\n\n79\n00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.320\nAnd we're going to give it\ncertain permissions that\n\n80\n00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.220\nmake sure that you have access.\n\n81\n00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.070\nAnd other people might get access.\n\n82\n00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.220\nWhen you create a folder, it actually\ndoes what's called inheritance.\n\n83\n00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.510\nIt has to get some default\npermissions from somewhere.\n\n84\n00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.030\nAnd it gets those permissions from\nwhatever folder it's inside of.\n\n85\n00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.940\nSo, I just created a Shared Documents\nfolder on my C drive.\n\n86\n00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.519\nSo, whatever permissions are assigned\nto the C drive itself were used as\n\n87\n00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:57.995\nthe default for this folder.\n\n88\n00:03:57.995 --> 00:03:59.897\nIt inherited those permissions, and\n\n89\n00:03:59.897 --> 00:04:02.570\nthen it added it to make\nsure that I had access.\n\n90\n00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.550\nOkay, now, I'm always gonna\nhave access to this folder,\n\n91\n00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.900\nbecause I'm the owner,\nI'm the one who made it.\n\n92\n00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.130\nEvery file, every folder on\nan NTFS drive has an owner.\n\n93\n00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.230\nAnd you can see it.\n\n94\n00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.520\nIf you pull up the properties\nof that folder, or file,\n\n95\n00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.280\nit's the same thing on a file,\nand you go to the Security tab,\n\n96\n00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.430\nhere's where we see those default\npermissions that were applied.\n\n97\n00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.660\nSo who got access to this?\n\n98\n00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.340\nAnd you'll see Authenticated Users,\nSystem Administrators,\n\n99\n00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.490\nadministrators are always\ngonna have access, and\n\n100\n00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.470\nthen Users, DONPEZET-PC/users, some of my\nregular users got access to it, right?\n\n101\n00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.590\nNow I might not want that.\n\n102\n00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.980\nI might need to change that.\n\n103\n00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.160\nBut these are the default permissions\nthat came from the parent drive,\n\n104\n00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.110\nthat came from that C drive.\n\n105\n00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.600\nAnd later on here and so my default,\nmy users have access to the C drive.\n\n106\n00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.920\nThey don't have full control of it.\n\n107\n00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.030\nSee how right is not checked?\n\n108\n00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.940\nBut they do have access to read it.\n\n109\n00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.470\nA regular user can browse the hard drive.\n\n110\n00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.080\nThey have that permission.\n\n111\n00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.570\nSo I might want to tweak these and\nchange them a bit but\n\n112\n00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.470\nthese permission were\ninherited from that parent.\n\n113\n00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.650\nAnd if I go down here to advanced here,\nI can see who the owner is.\n\n114\n00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.670\nAnd I'm the owner, Don Pezet, right there.\n\n115\n00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.600\nI created it, so I'm the owner.\n\n116\n00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.220\nNo matter what happens,\nI will always have access.\n\n117\n00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.270\nYou can't lock out the owner.\n\n118\n00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.740\nEven if I empty out the permissions\nlist and take everybody out,\n\n119\n00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.410\nI'll still have access, cuz I'm the owner.\n\n120\n00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.550\nAll right, if you're\nan administrator on a computer and\n\n121\n00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.810\nyou're locked out of a folder, well,\n\n122\n00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.560\ntechnically as an administrator\nyou can never get locked out.\n\n123\n00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.520\nBecause as an administrator, you can\npull up the properties of that folder,\n\n124\n00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.250\nyou can go to the advanced security\nsettings, and you can change the owner.\n\n125\n00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.830\nYou can make yourself the owner and\nnow you have access.\n\n126\n00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.440\nSo if the user ever tries to lock you out,\nan administrator can get in.\n\n127\n00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.420\nYou can't lock out an administrator.\n\n128\n00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.620\nThis is called seizing ownership.\n\n129\n00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.860\nYou might have to seize\nownership to get back in, but\n\n130\n00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.700\nyou can do that cuz you're\nan administrator, all right?\n\n131\n00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.740\nNow, as a regular user,\na regular user can lock themselves out.\n\n132\n00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.150\nA regular user can't seize ownership.\n\n133\n00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.810\nThey don't have that permission,\nall right?\n\n134\n00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.940\nSo, a regular user could potentially\nlock themselves out of their own\n\n135\n00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.580\nfile if they were in here messing around\nwith their permissions, all right.\n\n136\n00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.450\nBut there's plenty of times that we\ndo wanna mess with these permissions.\n\n137\n00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.270\nIf I go back out here,\n\n138\n00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.140\nI can set these things by what group\npeople are in, or who they are.\n\n139\n00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.030\nAuthenticated users,\n\n140\n00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.390\nthat just means anybody who's logged in\nwith a user name and password, right?\n\n141\n00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:23.550\nAnybody who's successfully\nauthenticated network or local, right?\n\n142\n00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.500\nUsers, this is saying users that have\nan account right here on this machine.\n\n143\n00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.190\nSo those are a little bit different but\n\n144\n00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.220\nthose are covering most\nof my users at this case.\n\n145\n00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.490\nif I just want it to be me and Jane,\nI don't want anyone else to have access,\n\n146\n00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:40.100\njust Jane and myself and that's it,\nI can edit these permissions and\n\n147\n00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.530\nI can start to change them.\n\n148\n00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.090\nRight?\nI can manipulate who has access.\n\n149\n00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.310\nI might wanna remove authenticated users,\nright?\n\n150\n00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.290\nBut if I do that, see the warning I get?\n\n151\n00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.010\nIf you look at the settings\non those permissions,\n\n152\n00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.700\nsee how these check marks\nare grayed out a little bit?\n\n153\n00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.130\nAnd that's because these permissions\naren't actually set on this folder.\n\n154\n00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.318\nI'm inheriting them from the parent,\nfrom the C drive.\n\n155\n00:07:01.318 --> 00:07:08.210\nSo I can add to these but\nI can't take away those permissions.\n\n156\n00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:09.030\nBut I want to take away.\n\n157\n00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.970\nI want to set these my way.\n\n158\n00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.090\nWell, if I want to do that I've\ngot to override the inheritance.\n\n159\n00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.773\nThey call it blocking the inheritance.\n\n160\n00:07:15.773 --> 00:07:20.546\nAnd you might have noticed the option when\nI went under advanced the option is right\n\n161\n00:07:20.546 --> 00:07:23.730\ndown here to replace all\nchild object permissions with\n\n162\n00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.380\ninheritable permissions from this object.\n\n163\n00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.310\nSo it's basically saying\nreplace whatever I've done here\n\n164\n00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:30.580\nwith the stuff from above, right?\n\n165\n00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.450\nThis would put it back to\nthe way it is now, but\n\n166\n00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:35.060\nright above that disable inheritance.\n\n167\n00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.380\nI can turn off the inheritance, and\n\n168\n00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.380\nnow I can fully customize\nthese permissions, right?\n\n169\n00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.930\nNow, when you turn it off it asks you,\ndo you wanna just\n\n170\n00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.610\ncopy the permissions that are there so\nyou have a starting point?\n\n171\n00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.390\nOr do you wanna remove them all and\nstart from scratch?\n\n172\n00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.830\nAnd I usually like to convert it.\n\n173\n00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.460\nI usually like to copy it.\n\n174\n00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.560\nSo now I've got a copy that's right here.\n\n175\n00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:57.174\nSo I disabled inheritance,\nI can see that I have enable down here.\n\n176\n00:07:57.174 --> 00:08:00.879\nIf I wanted to turn it back on,\nI could enable it and check this box and\n\n177\n00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:04.779\nit would put it back to the way it was,\nbut I want it disabled and if I say,\n\n178\n00:08:04.779 --> 00:08:08.874\nokay, and go back out to this screen I\ncan start to choose these settings and\n\n179\n00:08:08.874 --> 00:08:12.480\nwhen I hit edit these boxes\naren't grayed out anymore.\n\n180\n00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.850\nNow when I look at these\nboxes they're nice and\n\n181\n00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:18.320\nwhite with a black check mark in em,\nI can start undoing permissions.\n\n182\n00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.860\nAnd I can take authenticated users and\nI can remove it.\n\n183\n00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:25.300\nI can take system I probably want to\nleave System, mostly because if I'm using\n\n184\n00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.730\nbackup, you kinda want your backups to\nback up this folder, so you need it.\n\n185\n00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:32.140\nVolume shadow copy you can actually get\naround that, but we usually leave System.\n\n186\n00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.890\nI might want to leave Administrators,\nright, because\n\n187\n00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.560\nI might want them to help me one day,\nand if I've taken them out of the group,\n\n188\n00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:41.030\nthen they're gonna seize ownership and\nthey're gonna be mad, so I'll leave them.\n\n189\n00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:42.200\nAnd then I'm going to get rid of users.\n\n190\n00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:46.000\nNow I'm not in the list.\n\n191\n00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.800\nSo I might wanna add myself but\nreally I'm the owner so I'm okay.\n\n192\n00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.810\nBut if I've got other people I might\nwanna add them, I'll go ahead and\n\n193\n00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.870\nadd myself specifically just in case.\n\n194\n00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:58.760\nJust in case I'm not the owner\nI'll still have these permissions.\n\n195\n00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.490\nAnd then I'm gonna add in Jane,\n\n196\n00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:05.310\nI'll just hit check name to make\nsure it actually finds her account.\n\n197\n00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:07.500\nAnd I'll say okay, and so there's Jane.\n\n198\n00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.590\nAnd now I can set permissions.\n\n199\n00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:13.490\nNow, for me,\nI clicked full control allowed.\n\n200\n00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:15.030\nAnd you'll see you've got an allow and\n\n201\n00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.340\na deny column, so you can give somebody\na permission or you can take it away.\n\n202\n00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.900\nI'm allowing me full control.\n\n203\n00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.920\nAnd when I check that,\nevery other check box lights up.\n\n204\n00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.790\nRight?\nLike, if I uncheck all these guys\n\n205\n00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:28.240\nif I start removing them, when I check\nfull control, everything else checks.\n\n206\n00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.460\nThat means I have full and\ntotal control of this system.\n\n207\n00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.790\nBut, when I'm giving access\nto somebody else like Jane,\n\n208\n00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:35.760\nI probably don't want that, right?\n\n209\n00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.420\nSo, I need to pick and choose.\n\n210\n00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:41.340\nI can give her full control if I trusted\nher, and wanted her to have that access.\n\n211\n00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:46.780\nOr I could say just modify,\nmodify means she can change documents.\n\n212\n00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:50.230\nSo she could edit documents that are in\nthere, or maybe just read and execute.\n\n213\n00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.730\nShe can read the documents,\nbut she can't change them.\n\n214\n00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:54.670\nThose are normally the ones that\nwe want to give out to people.\n\n215\n00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:57.510\nI'm gonna give her modify I\nwant her to be able to read and\n\n216\n00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:59.530\nchange those documents right.\n\n217\n00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:02.020\nNow why have a denied column?\n\n218\n00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:05.590\nIf I don't want Jane to have a modify\nI can just uncheck it here right,\n\n219\n00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:06.360\nwhy do I need a deny?\n\n220\n00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:12.030\nWell the reason is somebody can\nget permissions more than one way.\n\n221\n00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.390\nJane is listed here specifically.\n\n222\n00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:17.328\nAnd so, if I want her to have read\n& execute, I can check that, and\n\n223\n00:10:17.328 --> 00:10:18.758\nthat's what she's gonna get.\n\n224\n00:10:18.758 --> 00:10:21.210\nBut let's say I added in another group.\n\n225\n00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:24.910\nLet's say that I just added in\nthe Users group again, all right, and\n\n226\n00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:27.320\nI gave the Users group modify.\n\n227\n00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.220\nJane only has read, but\nthe users group has modify, okay?\n\n228\n00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:36.060\nWell, I'm gonna hit apply on that.\n\n229\n00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.150\nTechnically, Jane is in the users group.\n\n230\n00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.320\nShe's in the users group and she is Jane.\n\n231\n00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.850\nSo both of those lines apply there.\n\n232\n00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:44.540\nSo what happens?\n\n233\n00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:48.230\nWindows combines the permissions and\ngives her the best.\n\n234\n00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:50.420\nWhatever the best is,\nthat's what she gets.\n\n235\n00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.750\nSo, on her account, she just gets Read.\n\n236\n00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:57.380\nOn the Users group, she gets modify,\nso she'll end up with modify.\n\n237\n00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:58.510\nShe gets the best.\n\n238\n00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.510\nSo, we have to remember that,\nand it gets really tricky.\n\n239\n00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.540\nIf you have a lot of groups,\nit gets messy.\n\n240\n00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:07.120\nSo if you exit out of this,\nI'll just say OK, you can go to Advanced.\n\n241\n00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:11.640\nAnd under Advanced,\nthere's a tab called Effective Access.\n\n242\n00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.460\nAnd Effective Access lets you figure out\nwhat somebody's permissions would be.\n\n243\n00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.480\nSo if I want to know what Jane's\npermissions are gonna be I could hit\n\n244\n00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:23.400\nSelect User, I could find Jane, okay,\nand then choose View effective access.\n\n245\n00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.130\nAnd it's gonna show me what\nshe would end up with, okay?\n\n246\n00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:31.717\nNow, notice she had read from her user,\nshe had read and\n\n247\n00:11:31.717 --> 00:11:35.530\nwrite from users but\nshe's got full control.\n\n248\n00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.740\nWhere the heck did that come from?\n\n249\n00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.520\nThat's why the effective\npermission tab is so important.\n\n250\n00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.830\nHow is she getting full control?\n\n251\n00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:49.570\nWell, that means that she's in some kind\nof group that's giving her that access\n\n252\n00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:53.490\nokay, now unfortunately it doesn't tell\nus what group that is right here, right.\n\n253\n00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:55.180\nSo now we have a little\nbit of research to do.\n\n254\n00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.590\nWhy did she have that access?\n\n255\n00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:01.480\nOkay well, I know why,\nshe's in the administrator's group.\n\n256\n00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.920\nShe's in the administrator's group,\nadministrators have full\n\n257\n00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.130\ncontrol of that folder so\nshe gets that access.\n\n258\n00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:05.760\nOkay?\n\n259\n00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.520\nIf I were to go back to my permissions and\ntake administrators and\n\n260\n00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.310\nbump them out, right?\n\n261\n00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:13.470\nWhich is not the greatest idea in\nthe world, but I'm gonna do it here,\n\n262\n00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.160\nI'm gonna bump it out, right?\n\n263\n00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.350\nNow if I go to effective access, and\nI hit View effective access again,\n\n264\n00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.820\noh, it's already updated, actually,\nI didn't even have to hit it,\n\n265\n00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:26.660\nI can see full control is gone, right, and\nthat it was limited by file permissions,\n\n266\n00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:27.820\nso it tells me why, right?\n\n267\n00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.590\nShe just doesn't have the permission for\nfull control now.\n\n268\n00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:31.100\nRight.\n\n269\n00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.560\nSo these are the way we kinda\njuggle these permissions on NTFS.\n\n270\n00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.630\nIt's pretty important stuff to get\nthese set the way that we want them.\n\n271\n00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:40.350\nAnd now she'll be able\nto access that folder.\n\n272\n00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:43.790\n>> Now Don, this has been great, right?\n\n273\n00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:44.320\n>> We've been talking.\n\n274\n00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.680\nThis is all about NTFS, right?\n\n275\n00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.490\nThis is all within the NTFS file system,\n\n276\n00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:52.280\nwhich obviously is the default file\nsystem of your Windows 8 machines.\n\n277\n00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.020\nBut what if we, I don't know,\nthrow a Fat 32 drive into the mix?\n\n278\n00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:57.660\nWhat would happen then?\n\n279\n00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:01.110\nGreat question,\nbecause you might have SD cards or\n\n280\n00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:03.060\nyou might have older hard drives\nthat are formatted Fat 32.\n\n281\n00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:04.440\nCan we do this?\n\n282\n00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.000\nAnd the answer is no.\n\n283\n00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.270\nThey're called NTFS permissions\nbecause they work on NTFS.\n\n284\n00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:11.430\nI'm on an NTFS drive here, right?\n\n285\n00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:15.720\nIf I were to take that folder, so\nI'll just take my shared documents folder,\n\n286\n00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.120\nand and I'm gonna copy it here.\n\n287\n00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.010\nAnd I'm gonna jump over to\na FAT 32 drive I've got.\n\n288\n00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:26.360\nSo I've got this FAT 32 drive right here,\nand I'm gonna paste that folder in.\n\n289\n00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.360\nSo now I've got that\nsame folder right here.\n\n290\n00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:32.630\nIf I pull up its properties,\nI don't even have a security tab.\n\n291\n00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:35.120\nThere's no tab for me to even click on.\n\n292\n00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.770\nFAT 32 does not support file permissions.\n\n293\n00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.300\nXFAT does not support\nfile permissions right?\n\n294\n00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:41.920\nThose file systems don't have support for\n\n295\n00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:46.210\nit so it's only NTFS that has\nthese file permissions right.\n\n296\n00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:51.400\nNow on FAT32, if you share a folder\nwith share permissions.- But,\n\n297\n00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.230\nif somebody's local on your computer,\n\n298\n00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:56.700\neverybody has access to everything\nunder FAT32, it's how it is.\n\n299\n00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.650\nUnder NTFS is different.\n\n300\n00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:01.050\nSo under NTFS,\nwe set those file permissions,\n\n301\n00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.480\nnow they apply to people that\nare local on our machine.\n\n302\n00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.210\nAwesome.\n\n303\n00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.100\nNow that's all well and good.\n\n304\n00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:07.260\nWe figured that out.\n\n305\n00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:08.550\nI got another curve ball for you though.\n\n306\n00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:10.620\nAnd this is probably\nthe one that's most tricky.\n\n307\n00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:16.209\nThis is something that even\nto we've talked about share,\n\n308\n00:14:16.209 --> 00:14:22.027\nthat's what we're doing,\nsharing files via the network,\n\n309\n00:14:22.027 --> 00:14:28.150\nand that's basically one of\nthe main things we wanna do.\n\n310\n00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:32.420\nBut I've also got the NTFS permission,\nso if the folder that I'm sharing\n\n311\n00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:36.735\nhas share permissions, and it has NTFS\npermissions, how does that work together.\n\n312\n00:14:36.735 --> 00:14:39.390\nAlright, this is where\nthings get a little weird.\n\n313\n00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:42.410\nRight?\nSo, I said if somebody had\n\n314\n00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:45.950\nmore then one set of permissions\nin NTFS they get the best.\n\n315\n00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:47.280\nright?\nThey get the best that's given,\n\n316\n00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.010\nwe saw that with Jane.\n\n317\n00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:54.353\nIf they have more then one permission\non the share, they get the best.\n\n318\n00:14:54.353 --> 00:14:55.520\nThey get the best of what's available,\nRight?\n\n319\n00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.970\nBut, if they have permissions on\nthe file systems and on the share,\n\n320\n00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:05.960\nand they're coming in over the network,\nboth permissions apply, what happens?\n\n321\n00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:11.225\nWindows actually gives them the most\nrestrictive Div access, alright?\n\n322\n00:15:11.225 --> 00:15:13.615\nAnd that's kind of a tricky\nthing to grasp, but\n\n323\n00:15:13.615 --> 00:15:15.655\nlet me just show you as an example.\n\n324\n00:15:15.655 --> 00:15:18.885\nI'm gonna take that shared\nfolder that we just made, right?\n\n325\n00:15:18.885 --> 00:15:21.055\nAnd let me browse to it here.\n\n326\n00:15:21.055 --> 00:15:23.325\nSo I'll take that Shared Documents.\n\n327\n00:15:23.325 --> 00:15:26.925\nAnd in the permissions for\nthat shared document,\n\n328\n00:15:26.925 --> 00:15:32.275\nunder Security we gave Jane read and\nexecute, and she has write, okay?\n\n329\n00:15:32.275 --> 00:15:34.000\nI didn't give her modify.\n\n330\n00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.580\nIf you give somebody write and\nnot modify they can create files but\n\n331\n00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:38.410\nthey can't change files.\n\n332\n00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:39.820\nKind of a weird thing you\nwouldn't normally do that.\n\n333\n00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:43.820\nLet me bump her up and I want to\ngive her actual modify permissions.\n\n334\n00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:47.350\nShe's getting modify from the user group,\nI forgot about that too.\n\n335\n00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:50.080\nSo she's getting it one way or\nanother, but there we go.\n\n336\n00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:54.610\nSo she's gonna have that access and\nif I go to advanced effective access and\n\n337\n00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:58.750\nI pull up old Jane Doe I can see in here\n\n338\n00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:02.810\nthat she's got every permission\nexcept full control.\n\n339\n00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:04.910\nShe also doesn't have delete\nsubfolders and files.\n\n340\n00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:06.001\nShe doesn't have change permissions.\n\n341\n00:16:06.001 --> 00:16:08.020\nBut she can modify, she can change files.\n\n342\n00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:11.240\nShe's got that access at NTFS.\n\n343\n00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:14.488\nIf I share this out, so\nI can share it this way, or\n\n344\n00:16:14.488 --> 00:16:16.723\nI'll share it the advanced way.\n\n345\n00:16:16.723 --> 00:16:19.090\nSo I'll go over here to\nthe properties of the folder.\n\n346\n00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:22.160\nI'll go to Sharing, and\nI'll choose Advanced Sharing.\n\n347\n00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.940\nRight, so I'm gonna share it here.\n\n348\n00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:30.470\nAnd then under Permissions,\neveryone just has read access, okay?\n\n349\n00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:32.240\nEveryone's got read.\n\n350\n00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.860\nBut I know that Jane,\non the file system, she has modify.\n\n351\n00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.700\nRight, so that's cool,\nso she's good, right?\n\n352\n00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:43.588\nWell if I leave it like this, and\nJane goes to connect, what's gonna happen?\n\n353\n00:16:43.588 --> 00:16:47.380\nWell, it's gonna connect, and both sets\nof permissions are going to apply.\n\n354\n00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:51.350\nSo, when she browses the network,\nshe finds My Computer,\n\n355\n00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:53.230\nshe goes into Shared Socuments.\n\n356\n00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:55.150\nThere's the stuff, right?\n\n357\n00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:59.308\nIf she goes to create a new document,\nhere she goes.\n\n358\n00:16:59.308 --> 00:17:02.330\nAccess denied, okay.\n\n359\n00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:06.030\nShe can create documents in NTFS,\nbut not on the Shared.\n\n360\n00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:08.010\nSo you end up with\nthe most restrictive one.\n\n361\n00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:10.660\nEven if I flip those permissions around,\nright?\n\n362\n00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:14.450\nAnd made it where she had\nfull control on the share and\n\n363\n00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:18.000\njust read on NTFS, it would still apply\nthis way where she would just have read.\n\n364\n00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.410\nYou get the most restrictive of the two.\n\n365\n00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:21.360\nSo on the exam,\n\n366\n00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.760\nif they give you two sets of permissions\nlike that, you kinda run down a list,\n\n367\n00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.990\nfigure out what's the most restrictive and\nthat's what she ends up with.\n\n368\n00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:31.700\nIf you're just dealing with NTFS,\nyou get the best.\n\n369\n00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.220\nIf you are just dealing with a share, you\nget the best, but if you're dealing with\n\n370\n00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.730\nboth, you get the most restrictive,\nso it's a backwards way of thinking.\n\n371\n00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:41.140\nNow, I'll tell you how I\nhandle this in real life.\n\n372\n00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:44.750\nIn real life land, I hate dealing\nwith two sets of permissions.\n\n373\n00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:45.790\nIt's a hassle.\n\n374\n00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:46.490\nRight?\n\n375\n00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:48.210\nSo, what I do is,\n\n376\n00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:53.150\nwhenever I share something out,\nI always, this is what I do.\n\n377\n00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:58.670\nI always go into Sharing, and\nin the Permissions, I remove everyone.\n\n378\n00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:00.900\nI don't like to use the everyone\ngroup if I can avoid it.\n\n379\n00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.370\nI like to add in authenticated users.\n\n380\n00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:07.640\nThe authenticated users group\nmeans they're a user on\n\n381\n00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.930\nthe network that's provided me\na valid user name and password.\n\n382\n00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:11.350\nI don't really care who they are,\n\n383\n00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:13.500\nI just wanna make sure they had\na valid user name and password.\n\n384\n00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:18.490\nI like authenticated users a little\nbetter than everyone, because everyone in\n\n385\n00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:21.790\ncertain scenarios could include people\nthat either haven't logged in or\n\n386\n00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:23.350\nwhose token has expired.\n\n387\n00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:26.490\nThat's the the worst, their password's\nexpired, that kind of thing can happen.\n\n388\n00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:31.170\nAll right, so I've got authenticated users\nadded in, and I'm getting full control.\n\n389\n00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:33.890\nNow I may not want everyone\nto have full control.\n\n390\n00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:34.600\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n391\n00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:38.000\ngive it to them, I'm just gonna say\neverybody gets full control right?\n\n392\n00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.860\nAnd when I do that at the share level,\neverybody's going to get full access.\n\n393\n00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:47.000\nBut I'm okay with that, because I\ncan come back to the NTFS level, and\n\n394\n00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.650\nI can set the real permissions,\nwhat I actually want.\n\n395\n00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.100\nI can set them here.\n\n396\n00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:55.212\nAnd so I can say, for example,\nthat users just get read access.\n\n397\n00:18:55.212 --> 00:18:58.862\nSo if I come in here and\ntake users, and I'll edit that, and\n\n398\n00:18:58.862 --> 00:19:03.770\nI'm gonna bump them down, so that they\njust have the read options, okay?\n\n399\n00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:06.060\nSo that's my standard user now.\n\n400\n00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.640\nAnd then I take Jane and\nI make sure, well,\n\n401\n00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.310\nshe's already got it cuz she has modify.\n\n402\n00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:13.000\nThose are the permissions\nthat I really wanna give out.\n\n403\n00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.940\nAnd I know that if somebody\nsits down on my computer,\n\n404\n00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.580\nthese permissions will\napply because they're NTFS.\n\n405\n00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:21.620\nAnd I know if they come in over\nthe network they'll hit the share,\n\n406\n00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.530\nit's full control, right?\n\n407\n00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:25.820\nBut it's these permissions that\nare gonna be more restrictive,\n\n408\n00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:27.370\nthese are the ones that are gonna apply,\nand\n\n409\n00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:30.000\nthat's where it's going to dictate it,\nnow I just have one place to go.\n\n410\n00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.780\nIf you always set your shares to full\ncontrol, then NTFS is the only place you\n\n411\n00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.820\nhave to go to set permissions,\nnow when wouldn't I do that?\n\n412\n00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.570\nIf it was a fat 32 drive because I\nwouldn't have the NTFS permissions,\n\n413\n00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:41.810\nthe share's all I've got.\n\n414\n00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:43.400\nAnd so that's where I would set them.\n\n415\n00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:47.810\nBut normally, this is the way I do it,\nand now, what I can do\n\n416\n00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:52.740\nis I can jump over here, and as Jane,\nI can browse the network again.\n\n417\n00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:56.980\nAnd I'm gonna see Don Pezet PC,\nI see Shared Documents,\n\n418\n00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:02.030\nwhich should be giving me full control,\nbut when I get in there,\n\n419\n00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:05.920\nI should only have modify,\nbecause that's all I end up with.\n\n420\n00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:10.750\nSo when I go in here and create some new\ndocuments or whatever, I can do that.\n\n421\n00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:11.800\nIt's going to let me create them.\n\n422\n00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:16.480\nI have that modify permission, but\nif I start doing other things,\n\n423\n00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.550\nlike trying to change permissions or\nwhatever, that's something you need\n\n424\n00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:22.750\nfull control for, and\nI'm not going to be allowed to do that.\n\n425\n00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:26.283\nSo you end up with that more restrictive\naccess, that's the benefit, and\n\n426\n00:20:26.283 --> 00:20:28.148\nthat's how we mix those two together.\n\n427\n00:20:28.148 --> 00:20:31.044\n>> That's a pretty smart thing to do,\nDon, to just leave it in one spot,\n\n428\n00:20:31.044 --> 00:20:33.300\nthe way you know,\nyou don't have to try to figure out,\n\n429\n00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.124\nokay, did I set a permission here,\nor did I set a permission there.\n\n430\n00:20:36.124 --> 00:20:40.248\nYou leave all the access controlling\nto one set of, well, access controls,\n\n431\n00:20:40.248 --> 00:20:42.723\nspecifically in the NTFS,\nbecause that way,\n\n432\n00:20:42.723 --> 00:20:45.032\nyou know you're covering all your bases.\n\n433\n00:20:45.032 --> 00:20:49.040\nSo it's a very smart idea, because\nit leaves the confusion at the door.\n\n434\n00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:49.620\n>> Yep.\nAnd\n\n435\n00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:51.590\nI actually didn't show her\nget restricted there, so\n\n436\n00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:54.100\nlet me show, just to make sure\nwe're thorough on this, so\n\n437\n00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.990\nas Jane, I know I can create files and\nstuff because I have modify.\n\n438\n00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:00.440\nBut if I go up to this bitmap image,\nfor example.\n\n439\n00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:04.340\nAnd I'll pull up its properties,\nand I'll go to security.\n\n440\n00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:06.703\nAnd here's the permissions,\nright, if I go to edit them,\n\n441\n00:21:06.703 --> 00:21:08.940\nsee how they're all grayed out?\n\n442\n00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:11.700\nI blocked inheritance, so\nthis isn't an inheritance issue.\n\n443\n00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:12.424\nIn this scenario,\n\n444\n00:21:12.424 --> 00:21:15.210\nthey're grayed out because I don't\nhave the permission to change it.\n\n445\n00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:18.286\nOh, actually, oh it'll let me add to it,\nwon't it, but there we go, if I try and\n\n446\n00:21:18.286 --> 00:21:19.490\napply, I get my access denied,\n\n447\n00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:22.220\nI'm not actually allowed to\nchange those permissions.\n\n448\n00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:23.480\nI have full control on the share,\n\n449\n00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:27.470\nfull control would give me the ability\nto change these permissions, but\n\n450\n00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:32.470\nbecause I don't have it on NTFS,\nI can't change it, and I get denied.\n\n451\n00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:36.900\nSo you can come up with some creative\nways to use this, but on the exam,\n\n452\n00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:40.400\nthey'll give you scenarios where they've\nconfigured permissions on both sides.\n\n453\n00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.400\nOn the share and on NTFS,\n\n454\n00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.530\nand you have to figure out what that\nresultant set of permissions would be.\n\n455\n00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:47.570\nIn real life, it's far easier to just\nnot set permissions on this chair and\n\n456\n00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:49.010\nset them in NTFS.\n\n457\n00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:49.780\n>> Awesome.\n\n458\n00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:52.860\nWell Don, we've walked through\na lot with this NTFS permissions.\n\n459\n00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:54.280\nHopefully you guys are following along.\n\n460\n00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.124\nDon, you've done a really good job,\nI must say.\n\n461\n00:21:56.124 --> 00:21:58.526\nIs there anything else that\nwe need to cover on this?\n\n462\n00:21:58.526 --> 00:22:00.249\n>> Yeah.\nThere's something that just popped\n\n463\n00:22:00.249 --> 00:22:00.750\ninto my mind.\n\n464\n00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:03.046\nAnd it's not something that most\npeople have to worry about, but\n\n465\n00:22:03.046 --> 00:22:05.650\nit is something that does turn up\non the exam from time to time.\n\n466\n00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:09.810\nAnd that is, I talked about inheritance,\nwhen you create a folder,\n\n467\n00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:12.530\nit inherits permissions\nfrom whatever's above it.\n\n468\n00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:17.930\nBut be careful when you copy or\nmove files because when you copy or\n\n469\n00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:21.920\nmove files,\nthe permissions can change, right?\n\n470\n00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:25.260\nWith inheritance, you're inheriting\nwhatever your parent folder is.\n\n471\n00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:29.070\nIf you move something,\nit's got a new parent, doesn't it?\n\n472\n00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:32.790\nAnd so it may inherit permissions\nfrom the new location.\n\n473\n00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:34.740\nAnd so that can really start\nto kind of screw with things,\n\n474\n00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:39.020\nnot necessarily in a bad way, but we just\nhave to be aware of that change, right?\n\n475\n00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:41.395\nSo, when I come in and look at a file,\n\n476\n00:22:41.395 --> 00:22:45.950\nlike let me create a new example here\nbecause I do wanna demonstrate this.\n\n477\n00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:49.320\nSo, if I create a new file,\nI'll do a new folder here and\n\n478\n00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.510\nmaybe I'll call this like sales.\n\n479\n00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:51.860\nSo this is going to be for my sales team.\n\n480\n00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:54.480\nAnd when I go and\npull the properties up for\n\n481\n00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:59.940\nthat folder, I can see the security\nsettings and what's set, right?\n\n482\n00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:05.170\nSo users have read and\nadministrators have other access rates.\n\n483\n00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:07.070\nThese are the permissions that\nare kind of assigned as they are.\n\n484\n00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:08.570\nAll right.\n\n485\n00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:11.134\nIf I take this folder,\nand I'm gonna copy it, and\n\n486\n00:23:11.134 --> 00:23:15.104\nI'm gonna go into the Shared Documents\nfolder we were just working with, and\n\n487\n00:23:15.104 --> 00:23:16.590\nI'm gonna paste it in here.\n\n488\n00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:19.310\nSo I just copied and pasted it.\n\n489\n00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:23.471\nWhen I pull up the properties on\nthat folder and go to security,\n\n490\n00:23:23.471 --> 00:23:25.607\nsee how Jane's on the list now?\n\n491\n00:23:25.607 --> 00:23:29.400\nAnd see how some of the other permissions\nare modified, they're changed.\n\n492\n00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.230\nI'm now inheriting the permissions\nof this new destination.\n\n493\n00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:36.670\nWhen you copy a file or copy a folder,\nyou're gonna inherit the permissions of\n\n494\n00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:39.400\nyour new destination,\nthe permissions change.\n\n495\n00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.800\nBe really careful with that,\nespecially when you copy between drives,\n\n496\n00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.270\nif you move data between\ndrives that happens,\n\n497\n00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:47.940\nyou inherit the permissions\nof your destination.\n\n498\n00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:50.240\nThere's only one exception to that rule,\nand\n\n499\n00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.840\nit is the exception that you\nneed to know for the exam.\n\n500\n00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:59.980\nThe exception is, if you move a document,\nnot copy, but move.\n\n501\n00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:05.137\nIf you move a document from one folder\nto another on the same NTFS partition,\n\n502\n00:24:05.137 --> 00:24:08.773\nall right, so\nwe're getting really specific here.\n\n503\n00:24:08.773 --> 00:24:10.085\nSo if I move a file or\n\n504\n00:24:10.085 --> 00:24:15.091\nfolder from one location on my C drive\nto another location on the C drive,\n\n505\n00:24:15.091 --> 00:24:19.787\nif I move it It'll actually retain\npermissions that were set on it.\n\n506\n00:24:19.787 --> 00:24:22.881\nIt's an exception, because when\nyou move on the same partition,\n\n507\n00:24:22.881 --> 00:24:26.400\nyou're not actually moving\nthe file data on the hard drive.\n\n508\n00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:30.120\nAll it's doing is going to the NTFS table\nand changing the location of pointer and\n\n509\n00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:33.260\nsaying, I need to point for data to\nthis other location on the drive, and\n\n510\n00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.940\nthe permissions stay the same.\n\n511\n00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.000\nBut when you copy,\nyou're actually creating a duplicate,\n\n512\n00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.446\nyou're creating an all new file and\nit gets all new permissions.\n\n513\n00:24:40.446 --> 00:24:44.544\nAnd when you move between partitions,\nit's really creating an all new file on\n\n514\n00:24:44.544 --> 00:24:48.330\nthe other partition, and so\nit gets all new permissions.\n\n515\n00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:53.450\nThe only time that doesn't happen is\nwhen you move within the same partition.\n\n516\n00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:55.500\nSo, when I took that shared folder and\n\n517\n00:24:55.500 --> 00:25:00.300\nI copied it, well, it inherited\nthe permissions of the destination.\n\n518\n00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:03.020\nBut if I wouldn't have done it that way.\n\n519\n00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:04.110\nI'm gonna delete that.\n\n520\n00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:07.350\nAll right, and\nI'm gonna go back to my C drive,\n\n521\n00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:09.750\nand I'm gonna take the sales folder.\n\n522\n00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:11.940\nAnd I'm gonna pull up its properties and\ngo into security.\n\n523\n00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.150\nAnd I'm gonna change this a bit.\n\n524\n00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:14.240\nI wanna manipulate it.\n\n525\n00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.720\nSo, I'm gonna remove\neverything that's in here.\n\n526\n00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.320\nOops, I'm at the, oh shoot.\n\n527\n00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.360\nI don't wanna block inheritance on it,\nthough.\n\n528\n00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.750\nWell I guess it's all right.\n\n529\n00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:26.830\n[LAUGH] We'll go crazy with this one, so\nI'm gonna block inheritance on this file\n\n530\n00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:31.640\nand when I do that I'm just gonna remove\neverything and I'm gonna add just myself.\n\n531\n00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.000\nI just wanna add me.\n\n532\n00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.012\nRight?\nSo I'm doing this the hard way but\n\n533\n00:25:35.012 --> 00:25:36.850\nI'm gonna add myself.\n\n534\n00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:40.950\nSo it's just me, I'm gonna give\nmyself full control and there we go.\n\n535\n00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:44.900\nSo I've got it set and\nit's in place, or you know what,\n\n536\n00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:48.800\na better scenario would be maybe\nI don't block inheritance,\n\n537\n00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.610\nmaybe I'm just adding to\nthe permissions that I'm inheriting.\n\n538\n00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:52.190\nRight?\n\n539\n00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:56.160\nSo if I go into Advanced here,\nand I take inheritance and\n\n540\n00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:59.690\nturn it back on, right, so\nI'll put that back in place, and\n\n541\n00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:03.650\nso I get these permissions reappearing,\nand then I add something to it, right?\n\n542\n00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:07.360\nWhen you inherit, these permissions\nare locked, but you can add to it.\n\n543\n00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:11.910\nYou can add to what's there,\nso I might add Jane and\n\n544\n00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:14.940\nadd Jane in with full control.\n\n545\n00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:15.480\nRight.\n\n546\n00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:18.750\nSo these other permissions are all being\ninherited, but I've added Jane in and\n\n547\n00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:20.020\ngiven her full control.\n\n548\n00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:20.770\nOkay.\n\n549\n00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:22.430\nI'm going to apply that.\n\n550\n00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:26.030\nThis time, instead of copying a folder,\nI'm going to move it.\n\n551\n00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:27.290\nI'm going to cut and paste.\n\n552\n00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:27.960\nRight.\n\n553\n00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.010\nSo you do that with drag and drop here,\nso I'll just drag and drop it.\n\n554\n00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:32.580\nAnd now it's in Shared Documents.\n\n555\n00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:34.540\nWhat's gonna happen is two things.\n\n556\n00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:37.810\nOne, it's gonna inherit\nthe permissions of the new folder.\n\n557\n00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:42.270\nBut two, anything I manually\nset is gonna follow it.\n\n558\n00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:47.060\nAnd so, when I pull up the properties of\nthat Sales folder, and I go into Security,\n\n559\n00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:50.900\nI'm inheriting some new permissions but\nJames still has full control.\n\n560\n00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:54.200\nAnd it's kinda hard to see but see how\nall of these check mark's are gray, but\n\n561\n00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.590\nthis one is black?\n\n562\n00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:58.080\nThat black one is the one\nthat followed me along.\n\n563\n00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.840\nSo when you move a file or\n\n564\n00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:05.400\nfolder between two locations on the same\nNTFS partition, it's always a good idea\n\n565\n00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.580\nto doublecheck the permissions to make\nsure they're set the way you want them.\n\n566\n00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:11.727\nIf you're copying or moving between\ntwo different drive letters,\n\n567\n00:27:11.727 --> 00:27:14.982\nit'll inherit the destination and\nyou don't have to worry about it,\n\n568\n00:27:14.982 --> 00:27:18.568\nbut if you move on the same partition,\nalways double-check the permissions\n\n569\n00:27:18.568 --> 00:27:21.909\ncuz things might follow you along,\nand that might not be what you want.\n\n570\n00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:26.168\nSo just be aware of that little exception\nto the rule, it's kind of a weird quirk,\n\n571\n00:27:26.168 --> 00:27:28.722\nbut it can happen, and\nit can turn up on the exam.\n\n572\n00:27:28.722 --> 00:27:31.768\n>> Well, Don, that's an awesome\ndemonstration, and an awesome way for\n\n573\n00:27:31.768 --> 00:27:34.440\nus to remember how are these\npermissions are working.\n\n574\n00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.980\nHopefully this NTFS mystery\nhas been revealed to you,\n\n575\n00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:39.520\nand now it's not so much of a mystery.\n\n576\n00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.970\nYou guys are starting to get\nthe idea of how they work, and\n\n577\n00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:44.470\nhow you can apply them\nto your environment, and\n\n578\n00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:47.810\nmake sure that the right permissions\nare applied at the right time.\n\n579\n00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:50.280\nDon, have we missed anything, or\nare we covering anything else?\n\n580\n00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.340\n>> I think that's it.\n\n581\n00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:53.885\n>> All right,\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed this episode.\n\n582\n00:27:53.885 --> 00:27:54.725\nThanks for watching.\n\n583\n00:27:54.725 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.308\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie\nhere with me as always Mr.\n\n4\n00:00:19.308 --> 00:00:20.790\nDon Pezet how's it going Don?\n\n5\n00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.977\n>> It is going great Daniel,\nI'm glad to be back on the show.\n\n6\n00:00:22.977 --> 00:00:27.089\nAnd today we're gonna be diving back into\nthe world of the MTA for mobility and\n\n7\n00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:31.212\ndevices fundamentals the just easiest\ntitle to say in the world, isn't it?\n\n8\n00:00:31.212 --> 00:00:33.875\n>> Oh yeah,\nthey really leave it out there for you.\n\n9\n00:00:33.875 --> 00:00:35.480\n>> Well today's topics\nare pretty important.\n\n10\n00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.880\nWe're going to be jumping into the world\nof, well, data encryption, right?\n\n11\n00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.730\nAnd data encryption is\na really important topic.\n\n12\n00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.250\nIt's something we need to be familiar\nwith, something you're hearing more and\n\n13\n00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.670\nmore, and more about, especially over\nthe last couple years where there\n\n14\n00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.440\nhave been huge data breeches and\ndata loss out there.\n\n15\n00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.860\n>> There's an increasing need\nto keep our data private.\n\n16\n00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.314\nAnd I shouldn't say it's an increasing\nneed, we've always had the need\n\n17\n00:00:57.314 --> 00:01:01.323\nto keep our data private, but now we're\nrecognizing the danger that we're in, like\n\n18\n00:01:01.323 --> 00:01:05.244\nhow easy it is sometimes for unauthorized\npeople to get access to our information.\n\n19\n00:01:05.244 --> 00:01:08.514\nSo there's a lot of steps that we\nneed to take to protect that, and\n\n20\n00:01:08.514 --> 00:01:11.580\none of the best steps is encryption,\nright?\n\n21\n00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.470\nWhat is encryption, right?\n\n22\n00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.020\nSo if you haven't dealt with it before,\n\n23\n00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.770\nencryption is simply a matter\nof taking data in one form and\n\n24\n00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.660\nrepresenting it in a different form\nthat nobody understands except you.\n\n25\n00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.410\nAnd it's your secret,\nlike your secret code.\n\n26\n00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.040\nAnd the example I always give are those\nold decoder rings that you could get,\n\n27\n00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.020\nwhere it would have the alphabet,\nA through Z, and\n\n28\n00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.820\nthen a number associated to each letter.\n\n29\n00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.920\nSo A was 5 and B was 17, and C was 3,\nand each one had a different number.\n\n30\n00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.650\nSo you could write a letter to somebody\nusing the numbers instead of the letters.\n\n31\n00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.790\nAnd when they got that, if somebody else\nintercepted it, it was just numbers.\n\n32\n00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.360\nIt didn't mean anything to them.\n\n33\n00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.830\nBut if they have the ring, they could say\nall right, well, 17, oh, 17 is B, and then\n\n34\n00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.390\nthey could write B down, and they could\nfigure out what the message was, right?\n\n35\n00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.880\nThat's really what encryption is.\n\n36\n00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.710\nNow, that's a very\nsimplified version of it.\n\n37\n00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.585\nWhat we use on computers is far\nmore advanced less than that, but\n\n38\n00:02:03.585 --> 00:02:05.295\nthe basic principle is the same.\n\n39\n00:02:05.295 --> 00:02:08.145\nBy encrypting our data,\nwe keep it private.\n\n40\n00:02:08.145 --> 00:02:12.445\nAnd only people that we give\na key to are allowed to see it,\n\n41\n00:02:12.445 --> 00:02:14.645\nallowed to open that data and read it.\n\n42\n00:02:14.645 --> 00:02:17.595\nAnd so that maintains what's\ncalled confidentiality.\n\n43\n00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:19.655\nYour data, it should be up to you,\n\n44\n00:02:19.655 --> 00:02:23.050\nup to your discretion as to\nwho gets to see your data.\n\n45\n00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.890\nIt shouldn't be open to the world\nwhere just anybody can see it, and\n\n46\n00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.650\nunfortunately the default on almost\nevery computer out there today is for\n\n47\n00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.800\nit to be unencrypted, for it to be open.\n\n48\n00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.310\nRight?\n\n49\n00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.160\nAnd so if anybody were to sit down and\nlog in on your computer,\n\n50\n00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.000\nthey'd have access to that data, or if\nthey were to browse over the network and\n\n51\n00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.890\nyou shared it out for example,\nthey'd have access to that data.\n\n52\n00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.230\nWe need to encrypt it to ensure\nthat we get to pick and choose.\n\n53\n00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.440\nRight.\nSo it is very important.\n\n54\n00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.410\nIt's definitely something that we\nwant to make sure that we have, and\n\n55\n00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.060\nthe big risk we have today is\nhow mobile our devices are.\n\n56\n00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.610\nWe have laptops, which laptops were really\ngaining in popularity ten years ago.\n\n57\n00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.700\nBut today, the hardware vendors\nlike Dell and HP, Lenovo,\n\n58\n00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.740\nthose guys they sell more\nlaptops than they do desktops.\n\n59\n00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.790\nSo laptops are now the predominant\nform of computing for most end users.\n\n60\n00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.860\nWe also have tablets and cell phones, and\n\n61\n00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.320\nwe put not just our personal data\non there but also our work data.\n\n62\n00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.710\nAnd what happens if you leave your\ncell phone in the backseat of a cab,\n\n63\n00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.090\nor you have your laptop stolen, right?\n\n64\n00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.470\nYou have your tablet and you set it down\nat the airport and you forget it, right?\n\n65\n00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.820\nWell, somebody could come and grab that\nlaptop, grab that tablet, grab that phone.\n\n66\n00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.300\nAnd now your data's on there.\n\n67\n00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.520\nAnd if it's unencrypted, they can just\nopen it up, read through your email,\n\n68\n00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.050\nlook at your data.\n\n69\n00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.010\nNow they've got to\naccess that information.\n\n70\n00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.690\nThey didn't have to be a hacker to do it,\nthey just had to have eyes to see,\n\n71\n00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.150\noh, why's there a tablet\nsitting on this bench?\n\n72\n00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.770\nLet me go and grab it,\nlet's see what pictures they took, right?\n\n73\n00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.250\nAnd that's exactly what happens, right?\n\n74\n00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.475\nThey see it and they get Information.\n\n75\n00:03:52.475 --> 00:03:56.035\nSo If you're dealing with confidential\ndata, data like financial records,\n\n76\n00:03:56.035 --> 00:04:00.035\nmedical records, even just your personal\ninformation you don't want out there,\n\n77\n00:04:00.035 --> 00:04:02.625\nit's a good idea to have that encrypted so\nif somebody finds that tablet,\n\n78\n00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:05.785\nfinds that laptop, they pick it up, they\nopen it up and they ask for a password.\n\n79\n00:04:06.835 --> 00:04:07.505\nI don't have a password.\n\n80\n00:04:07.505 --> 00:04:10.475\nIf they don't have the password,\nthey can't get at the data.\n\n81\n00:04:10.475 --> 00:04:12.755\nNo matter what they do,\nif they rip the hard drive out and\n\n82\n00:04:12.755 --> 00:04:15.510\nstick it in another computer,\nif they start going at it that way.\n\n83\n00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.900\nThey still can't get at the data.\n\n84\n00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.560\nIt's encrypted and it's protected.\n\n85\n00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.740\nSo it's definitely a step that\nwe wanna take on, really,\n\n86\n00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.310\nall of our equipment today.\n\n87\n00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.750\nSometimes we think I just use that\ntablet for playing video games on.\n\n88\n00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.975\nWell, do you have your work\naccount logged in on it.\n\n89\n00:04:29.975 --> 00:04:33.135\nDo you have your personal\nemail account logged in on it?\n\n90\n00:04:33.135 --> 00:04:35.205\nWould you like somebody\nto have access to that?\n\n91\n00:04:35.205 --> 00:04:37.695\nSure, you don't think much about that\ntablet, but your account's on there.\n\n92\n00:04:37.695 --> 00:04:39.845\nPeople could use it to gain\naccess to your information and\n\n93\n00:04:39.845 --> 00:04:40.755\nit needs to be secure, right?\n\n94\n00:04:40.755 --> 00:04:42.760\nSo, encryption is very, very important.\n\n95\n00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.170\n>> So Don, now that we understand the\nimportance of encryption, why we need it,\n\n96\n00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.840\nwhy it's important.\n\n97\n00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.440\nWhat does Microsoft offer\nus in terms of encryption?\n\n98\n00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.472\nWhat can we use as far as the Microsoft,\nand especially, obviously the MTA,\n\n99\n00:04:53.472 --> 00:04:54.779\nit's what we're studying for,\n\n100\n00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:57.127\nwhat do they want us to know\nabout it that they offer as well?\n\n101\n00:04:57.127 --> 00:04:59.700\n>> Yeah, and\nlet me give you a great example.\n\n102\n00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.755\nSo, earlier in this series I had\na folder called Security, and\n\n103\n00:05:02.755 --> 00:05:05.077\nin there I had a few\nlittle security documents.\n\n104\n00:05:05.077 --> 00:05:06.700\nThey were just text files.\n\n105\n00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.510\nAnybody who had access to my computer\ncould easily open those up and\n\n106\n00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.430\ngain access to them.\n\n107\n00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.030\nIf that actually had some important\ninformation in it that I didn't\n\n108\n00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.040\nwant to get out.\n\n109\n00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.810\nI want to take the extra\nprecaution of encrypting the data.\n\n110\n00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.400\nAnd Microsoft actually gives us\ntwo different ways to do that.\n\n111\n00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.030\nMicrosoft has supported file\nencryption since forever ago, right?\n\n112\n00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.760\nSo really,\nback in NT4 we had file encryption.\n\n113\n00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.020\nSo it's been a long time.\n\n114\n00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.940\nIt's been at least 15 years\nthat we've had that support but\n\n115\n00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.330\nthey also have newer technologies\nthat provide the functionality too.\n\n116\n00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.460\nSo we kind of have some choices,\nall right?\n\n117\n00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.570\nWe start by making a decision, all right?\n\n118\n00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.410\nMy decision needs to be,\ndo I wanna encrypt my entire hard drive\n\n119\n00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.030\nor do I just want to encrypt\nindividual files, all right?\n\n120\n00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.990\nIf we want to encrypt individual files,\nwell,\n\n121\n00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.970\nwe have a system in here called\nthe encrypting file system or EFS.\n\n122\n00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.180\nWhere you can go in and\nencrypt just individual files.\n\n123\n00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.860\nBut we have another\ntechnology called BitLocker.\n\n124\n00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.581\nAnd BitLocker lets you encrypt\nyour entire hard drive, right?\n\n125\n00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:08.990\nNow how do I make that choice?\n\n126\n00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.000\nWhy would I choose one versus the other?\n\n127\n00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.980\nWell it comes down to performance.\n\n128\n00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.714\nWhen you open up a file that's encrypted\nyour computer has to decrypt it, and\n\n129\n00:06:16.714 --> 00:06:18.275\nthat takes it a second, right?\n\n130\n00:06:18.275 --> 00:06:20.935\nThere's a little bit of a mathematical\ncalculation that has to happen,\n\n131\n00:06:20.935 --> 00:06:23.380\nwhile it uses the key\nto undo the encryption.\n\n132\n00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.170\nAnd then when you read the file and\n\n133\n00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.180\nyou're done with it if you've\nmade changes you wanna save it.\n\n134\n00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.110\nAnd when you save it,\nit's going to re encrypt the file.\n\n135\n00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.550\nSo there's a mathematical\ncalculation that happens there.\n\n136\n00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.090\nSo if you encrypt your entire hard drive\nthat stuff's happening all the time.\n\n137\n00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.490\nAnd that can lead to slower performance,\nright?\n\n138\n00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.970\nIf you encrypt individual files, the bulk\nof your hard drive is not encrypted,\n\n139\n00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:49.380\nso when Windows runs, when your\nprograms run, those aren't encrypted.\n\n140\n00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.340\nBut then when you open your document,\nthat is encrypted.\n\n141\n00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.260\nAnd so\nnow you get better performance out of it.\n\n142\n00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:59.240\nWell, that was a very real concern\nup until I don't know, four or\n\n143\n00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.390\nfive years ago.\n\n144\n00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:04.480\nAnd starting out four or five years ago,\nthe processor vendors like Intel and AMD,\n\n145\n00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.960\nthey started building encryption\naccelerators right into the CPUs.\n\n146\n00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.660\nSo when you have a modern day Intel or\n\n147\n00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.830\nAMD processor it'll have AES encryption\nsupport built right into the CPU.\n\n148\n00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.730\nAnd that means they can do the encryption\nand decryption in practically real time.\n\n149\n00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:20.790\nYou don't even notice.\n\n150\n00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.820\nIt's a very, very small performance hit.\n\n151\n00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.170\nSo today if you were to ask me,\nshould I encrypt an individual file or\n\n152\n00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.780\nthe whole hard drive?\n\n153\n00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.530\nI'm gonna tell you a whole hard drive.\n\n154\n00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:30.620\nJust do the whole hard drive.\n\n155\n00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.800\nYou're not gonna see any bigger\nperformance hit outta that than you\n\n156\n00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.720\nwould encrypting an individual file.\n\n157\n00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.220\nBut if you've an older computer,\na computer that\n\n158\n00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.770\ndoesn't have that acceleration there\nactually is a noticeable difference and\n\n159\n00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.280\nencrypting the whole hard drive might\nnot be a great solution for you.\n\n160\n00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.620\nSo that's how we're going to make\nthat choice between bit locker,\n\n161\n00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:52.220\nwhich is the whole hard drive or\nwhether it is EFS, the individual file.\n\n162\n00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.000\nBut let me show you both for completeness,\nbecause both are on the exam.\n\n163\n00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.100\nSo, we'll start with an individual file.\n\n164\n00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.027\nI want to encrypt just one document.\n\n165\n00:07:59.027 --> 00:08:03.485\nWell, if I browsed to my hard drive, and\nI start looking for some files, right?\n\n166\n00:08:03.485 --> 00:08:05.004\nSo I'm gonna browse to my F drive.\n\n167\n00:08:05.004 --> 00:08:06.555\nAnd there's my Security folder, and\n\n168\n00:08:06.555 --> 00:08:08.502\nif I browse in there I've\ngot a couple of files.\n\n169\n00:08:08.502 --> 00:08:13.406\nNow these files are just regular\nold files sitting on an NTFS drive,\n\n170\n00:08:13.406 --> 00:08:18.330\nthe NTFS part is important,\nbecause EFS only works on top of NTFS.\n\n171\n00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:22.632\nEFS isn't it's own file system,\nit's actually an extension of NTFS, so\n\n172\n00:08:22.632 --> 00:08:25.170\nI have to be on an NTFS drive for\nthis to work.\n\n173\n00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:30.625\nAnd if it is an NTFS drive, I can pull\nup the properties of any of these files.\n\n174\n00:08:30.625 --> 00:08:33.570\nNow when I pull up the properties,\nI can look at it and\n\n175\n00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:34.670\nsee these attributes down here,\n\n176\n00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:37.710\nyou've got read only and hidden, there's\nactually more attributes than that.\n\n177\n00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:41.823\nIf I go to advanced, there's an attribute\nright here for encrypting or\n\n178\n00:08:41.823 --> 00:08:43.910\ncompressing the file.\n\n179\n00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:47.230\nI can choose to encrypt it, and now\nit's gonna encrypt it on the hard drive.\n\n180\n00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:49.690\nOr I could choose to compress it,\nand now it's gonna try and\n\n181\n00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:51.120\nshrink it to save space.\n\n182\n00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.580\nBack in the day,\nwe didn't have giant hard drives, and so\n\n183\n00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.270\nbeing able to compress was really nice,\nthat was another feature of NTFS.\n\n184\n00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:00.040\nNow notice I can only do one or the other,\nI can't check them both, right.\n\n185\n00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.560\nI gotta pick which one I want.\n\n186\n00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.920\nCompression's not normally\na concern anymore,\n\n187\n00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.530\nlarge hard drives are really cheap,\nbut encryption is, so\n\n188\n00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:10.880\nI'm gonna check off encrypt\ncontents to secure data, all right?\n\n189\n00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.560\nWhen I do that, and I hit OK,\nit's gonna go into it and encrypt it.\n\n190\n00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:19.475\nNow, it's asking me, do I want I want\nto encrypt just this one file or\n\n191\n00:09:19.475 --> 00:09:22.065\ndo I wanna encrypt the whole\nfolder that it's in?\n\n192\n00:09:22.065 --> 00:09:24.385\nMicrosoft assumes hey,\nif this one file's important,\n\n193\n00:09:24.385 --> 00:09:27.355\nmaybe the other files in this\nfolder are important also.\n\n194\n00:09:27.355 --> 00:09:29.990\nAnd so we want to encrypt them too,\nand into, we've got that choice.\n\n195\n00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:31.760\nI'm just gonna do this file for right now.\n\n196\n00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:37.780\nWhen I do that, in the background,\nWindows just encrypted that file.\n\n197\n00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.843\nI know it for two reasons, okay, one\nreason is that the file just turned green,\n\n198\n00:09:42.843 --> 00:09:45.390\nright, see how that color is green now?\n\n199\n00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:46.660\nWhen you're browsing your file system,\n\n200\n00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:50.990\nif you see a green file that lets you\nknow that its been encrypted with EFS.\n\n201\n00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.720\nThe other files black,\nthat let's me know it's not encrypted.\n\n202\n00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.940\nAnd, I also get this little\nbubble down here at the bottom,\n\n203\n00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.730\nand when you look at that bubble, it says\nback up your file encryption key, right?\n\n204\n00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:04.180\nSo it just created an encryption key for\nme, so that I can decrypt this data.\n\n205\n00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:05.950\nSo now I can access these files.\n\n206\n00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:08.570\nWhen I browse through this,\nI don't have to know the key.\n\n207\n00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:09.690\nIt just opens up.\n\n208\n00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:10.890\nThat's it, right?\n\n209\n00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:13.020\nIn the background it's using my key.\n\n210\n00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.810\nBut what happens if I get locked\nout of my user account, or\n\n211\n00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:18.180\nI forget my password or whatever?\n\n212\n00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.000\nI don't have my key any more.\n\n213\n00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.455\nI can't decrypt that file.\n\n214\n00:10:21.455 --> 00:10:24.615\nSo we need to back up our key,\nsave it to a CD or USB key or\n\n215\n00:10:24.615 --> 00:10:27.175\nsomething that we can\nkeep somewhere secure,\n\n216\n00:10:27.175 --> 00:10:30.265\nbecause if somebody gets that key\nthey can access all our data, right.\n\n217\n00:10:30.265 --> 00:10:34.085\nSo I know that it's now encrypting, and\nI can go in and encrypt other files too.\n\n218\n00:10:34.085 --> 00:10:38.225\nAll of my other data is unencrypted,\nbut just this one file is.\n\n219\n00:10:38.225 --> 00:10:41.495\nNow, when I log in,\nthe key's attached to me, and\n\n220\n00:10:41.495 --> 00:10:44.280\nso I'm able to access this file and\nit's no big deal.\n\n221\n00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.910\nIf I want other people to access it,\nthey don't have my key.\n\n222\n00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:51.640\nAnd so if I pull up the properties of\nthis, I can go right back down to that\n\n223\n00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.510\nadvance tab where we had EFS,\nand you'll see details.\n\n224\n00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:59.380\nAnd under details you can\nadd in other user accounts.\n\n225\n00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:02.310\nAnd what you're doing is\nattaching your key to them, and\n\n226\n00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:04.090\nnow they can access the files too.\n\n227\n00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:07.800\nSo you can add in more than one person,\nand you can back up your key,\n\n228\n00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.290\nright here I can choose my user and\nback up the key right from here.\n\n229\n00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:12.730\nSo if you miss that bubble\nthat comes up on the screen,\n\n230\n00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:13.850\nyou can do it right from here.\n\n231\n00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:14.400\nRight?\n\n232\n00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:20.600\nSo that's basically how we handle things\nlike EFS, encryption of individual files.\n\n233\n00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.390\nNow if somebody were to\nbreak into this building and\n\n234\n00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:25.970\nsteal the hard drive out of this laptop.\n\n235\n00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:28.530\nNot even the whole laptop,\njust the hard drive.\n\n236\n00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:32.300\nThey could take it home, stick it as\na second hard drive on their computer,\n\n237\n00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.510\nand they can start browsing the contents\nof my hard drive without logging in.\n\n238\n00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:36.050\nRight?\n\n239\n00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:37.500\nThat's how that works.\n\n240\n00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.234\nThey'd see all the contents\nof my hard drive.\n\n241\n00:11:40.234 --> 00:11:42.270\nThey'd even see, Simple Cipher.txt.\n\n242\n00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.040\nThey'd see that file.\n\n243\n00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.640\nBut when they opened it,\nit would be full of jumbled mess.\n\n244\n00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.730\nIt wouldn't mean anything,\nit would just be garbled characters,\n\n245\n00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.190\nthat they don't mean anything,\nand it doesn't do them any good.\n\n246\n00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:54.200\nAll right.\n\n247\n00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.040\nUnless they have my key.\n\n248\n00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:58.040\nYou have to apply my key to decrypt it.\n\n249\n00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.150\nAnd in order to get my key,\nyou have to log in as me.\n\n250\n00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:02.620\nWell when they ripped that hard drive out,\nand\n\n251\n00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:05.510\ntook it somewhere else,\nthey lost that ability to log in as me.\n\n252\n00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:08.700\nThey're not gonna be able to do that,\nand my data is safe.\n\n253\n00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.410\nSo now I know even if\nsomebody steals this laptop,\n\n254\n00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:14.080\nthey can't get into my\nSimple Cipher file right here.\n\n255\n00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:14.970\nSo it gives me some protection.\n\n256\n00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:17.640\nBut hat's just one file, right?\n\n257\n00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.870\nWhat if I want to do the whole hard drive?\n\n258\n00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:21.550\nWell that's were BitLocker comes in.\n\n259\n00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:22.710\nNow BitLocker has two modes.\n\n260\n00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:25.860\nThere's regular old BitLocker, which is\ngreat for encrypting your C drive, or\n\n261\n00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:27.870\nyour main operating system.\n\n262\n00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:30.190\nAnd then you have what's\ncalled BitLocker To Go.\n\n263\n00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:34.510\nAnd Bit Locker To Go, it's good for\nencrypting portable drives.\n\n264\n00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:37.130\nThe difference is,\nwhen you encrypt your own hard drive,\n\n265\n00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:39.750\nyou want that to be tied\nto your physical computer.\n\n266\n00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:42.570\nI only want this hard drive to decrypt\nwhen it's attached to my computer.\n\n267\n00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:45.460\nSomebody steals the hard drive,\nI don't want it to decrypt anywhere else,\n\n268\n00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:46.280\njust here on my computer.\n\n269\n00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.950\nSo regular BitLocker ties\nthe drive to your machine.\n\n270\n00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:52.970\nMore importantly,\non every motherboard these days,\n\n271\n00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:55.880\nthere's something called a TPM,\na trusted platform module.\n\n272\n00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.260\nIt's a chip that can store\nan encryption key, and\n\n273\n00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.650\nit's stored right on your motherboard.\n\n274\n00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:01.280\nAnd so\nthat's what your hard drive's looking for,\n\n275\n00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.290\nit kind of keys it to that TPM.\n\n276\n00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:07.040\nBut if I had a USB hard drive, and\nI'm going from computer to computer to\n\n277\n00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.530\ncomputer, there's no TPM around\nto help me with that, right?\n\n278\n00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:14.140\nSo regular BitLocker's not suitable,\nMicrosoft created BitLocker To Go for\n\n279\n00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:14.790\nthat situation.\n\n280\n00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:19.290\nAnd instead of marrying it to a TPM,\nit marries it to a password,\n\n281\n00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:20.190\na password that you pick.\n\n282\n00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:21.150\nSo you pick this password.\n\n283\n00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:24.850\nAnd when you take that drive and\nhook it up to somebody else's computer,\n\n284\n00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:26.820\nWindows is just gonna ask you for\nthe password.\n\n285\n00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.980\nIf you know it, you type it in,\nnow you have access to the drive.\n\n286\n00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.450\nIf you don't know it, can't see the drive.\n\n287\n00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:33.470\nThe drive's just full of junk,\nit doesn't help anybody.\n\n288\n00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:35.090\nSo we get that security even on the go.\n\n289\n00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.770\nSo if I want an extra\nlevel of security here,\n\n290\n00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:41.460\nI could choose to encrypt my\nentire drive if I wanted.\n\n291\n00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.310\nNow, if I encrypt my C drive,\nthat's where my operating system is, so\n\n292\n00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:47.970\nwhen I run through the wizard it's gonna\nmake me reboot, so I'm not gonna do that.\n\n293\n00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.600\nI'm gonna encrypt my F drive,\nso that I don't have to reboot.\n\n294\n00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.900\nBut in real life you'd probably\nwant to encrypt all your drives.\n\n295\n00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:55.700\nEverywhere you have data that's considered\nsensitive, you'd wanna encrypt that.\n\n296\n00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.240\nI'm gonna encrypt my F drive, and\n\n297\n00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.810\nso to encrypt it the easiest way is\nto just right click on the drive, and\n\n298\n00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:04.580\nchoose to turn on BitLocker,\nthe option's right there.\n\n299\n00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:08.490\nOr you can bring up your modern UI,\nand you can just type BitLocker.\n\n300\n00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:12.720\nAnd you'll see manage BitLocker up here,\nand that takes you into the BitLocker\n\n301\n00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.630\nconfiguration screen,\nwhere you can turn on BitLocker from here.\n\n302\n00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:18.060\nThis is actually the same thing,\nis if I just right click, and\n\n303\n00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.110\nchose to turn on BitLocker.\n\n304\n00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:24.810\nNow, nice thing about BitLocker,\nit's not built on top of NTFS.\n\n305\n00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:27.710\nSo Bitlocker can encrypt NTFS and FAT32.\n\n306\n00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.500\nSo see I've got both these\ndrives right here showing up,\n\n307\n00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.530\nI can encrypt them both if I want.\n\n308\n00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:34.580\nIt doesn't matter that\nthe other one is not NTFS.\n\n309\n00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:38.830\nAnd to turn on that encryption,\nwe can just pick the drive we want, and\n\n310\n00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:40.660\nchoose turn on BitLocker.\n\n311\n00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:43.030\nAnd this is what I would have seen\nif I right clicked on the drive and\n\n312\n00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.740\nchose turn on BitLocker.\n\n313\n00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:44.770\nIt would just take me right here.\n\n314\n00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:46.926\nIt's faster that way.\n\n315\n00:14:46.926 --> 00:14:51.830\nNow what it's asking me here is,\nif I have a TPM on my system,\n\n316\n00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:56.060\nif I have a trusted platform module,\nit's gonna tie the drive to that, okay?\n\n317\n00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:59.310\nBut my system here, this is a virtual\nmachine so it doesn't have a TPM, so\n\n318\n00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:00.540\nit's not seeing it.\n\n319\n00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.690\nSo it's gonna automatically\ndo BitLocker To Go.\n\n320\n00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:05.150\nAnd it's asking me how\nI wanna handle that.\n\n321\n00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:07.656\nDo I wanna handle it with a password or\na smart card, right?\n\n322\n00:15:07.656 --> 00:15:11.359\nA smart card is a little\ncredit card sized card.\n\n323\n00:15:11.359 --> 00:15:12.461\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That was dumb.\n\n324\n00:15:12.461 --> 00:15:13.987\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And has a little chip on it,\n\n325\n00:15:13.987 --> 00:15:15.770\nand the chip can store your key.\n\n326\n00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.350\nSo you put the card in, and\nthat's where you get your key.\n\n327\n00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:21.300\nA password, well it just uses\nyour password as the key.\n\n328\n00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:24.040\nAnd so\nwe can punch in a password here to use.\n\n329\n00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.300\nI'll punch in a super secure password.\n\n330\n00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.270\nAnd I'll move forward on that, all right?\n\n331\n00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:33.360\nSo now it's got a password and it's asking\nme, how I wanna save my recovery key.\n\n332\n00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.240\nNow what's a recovery key?\n\n333\n00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.130\nWell, I've got a password.\n\n334\n00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:38.680\nI know the password, it's in my head.\n\n335\n00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.630\nSo I can decrypt this drive.\n\n336\n00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:44.510\nBut what if I get hit by a bus on\nthe way to school and that's it, right?\n\n337\n00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:48.940\nNow, somebody else needs access to my\ndata, how do they get at the data?\n\n338\n00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:49.750\nThey can't.\n\n339\n00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:50.770\nThe data's gone.\n\n340\n00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:52.630\nYou have to know that password.\n\n341\n00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:55.339\nSo we can set a back up, a recovery key.\n\n342\n00:15:55.339 --> 00:15:58.302\nAll right, the recovery key\nis if I forget my password,\n\n343\n00:15:58.302 --> 00:16:02.538\nif I get locked out for some reason, I can\nalways go to this key and get at my data.\n\n344\n00:16:02.538 --> 00:16:04.931\nAll right, but be really careful.\n\n345\n00:16:04.931 --> 00:16:09.027\nBecause if somebody else gets that key,\nthey can get at your data.\n\n346\n00:16:09.027 --> 00:16:11.080\nRight, this is the key\nto the kingdom right?\n\n347\n00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.310\nSo I'm gonna save it to a file.\n\n348\n00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:15.260\nNormally you'd save it to a CD or\na USB key.\n\n349\n00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:16.450\nThis isn't important data to me, so\n\n350\n00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:18.130\nI'm gonna save it right\nhere to the same computer.\n\n351\n00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.560\nAnd it'll warn me like hey\nthat's kind of a bad idea.\n\n352\n00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.980\nYou don't really wanna save it\nto your own computer because\n\n353\n00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:25.850\nwhat if you lose your computer,\nnow you lost your key.\n\n354\n00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:28.460\nThat would be a problem,\nbut I'm gonna do it anyway.\n\n355\n00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.790\nSo, then we can move past, and\nnow it's ready to encrypt.\n\n356\n00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:34.240\nAnd when it encrypts it\ngives you two options, okay?\n\n357\n00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:40.090\nOne, it can encrypt just the data that's\nactually there and not the empty space.\n\n358\n00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:42.250\nOr two, it can encrypt the whole thing.\n\n359\n00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:43.930\nOkay, the whole drive,\nincluding the empty space.\n\n360\n00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:46.708\nNow, why encrypt empty space?\n\n361\n00:16:46.708 --> 00:16:48.970\nWell, if you don't\nencrypt the empty space,\n\n362\n00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.580\nif you just encrypt the space\nthat actually has data.\n\n363\n00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.730\nA really savvy attacker\ncould look at that and\n\n364\n00:16:54.730 --> 00:17:00.300\nsay okay, it's a terrabyte drive but\nthere's only 50 megs of data on it.\n\n365\n00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:03.810\nI can tell because there's 50 megs of\nencrypted data, the rest of it's empty.\n\n366\n00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:06.960\nBut, if you encrypt the whole drive,\nit's a terrabyte drive,\n\n367\n00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.650\nand they see a terrabyte\nof encrypted data.\n\n368\n00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:11.800\nThey don't know how much\ndata you have on there.\n\n369\n00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.800\nSo it gives you the best protection,\n\n370\n00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.570\nit hides the most details about\nyour information on the drive.\n\n371\n00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:18.740\nI'm gonna do the faster option though,\nwhich is just to encrypt my data.\n\n372\n00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.000\nJust because it's on the show,\n\n373\n00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.330\nin real life land we generally\nwanna do the whole disk, all right?\n\n374\n00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:25.000\nAnd then we'll start that encrypting.\n\n375\n00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.260\nNow the cool part here is,\nwhile it's encrypting.\n\n376\n00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:28.210\nYou can still use the computer.\n\n377\n00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:29.500\nYou can still work.\n\n378\n00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.390\nMy drive has very little data so it\nfinished really fast, you heard the chime\n\n379\n00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:35.610\nthere, but in real life, it could take\nhours to encrypt your whole drive.\n\n380\n00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:37.980\nAnd that's fine,\nyou just keep working like normal.\n\n381\n00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.280\nAnd it's encrypting in the background.\n\n382\n00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.440\nIf it's your operating system drive,\nright there it would ask me to reboot.\n\n383\n00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.380\nAnd you reboot and it boots back up and\nthen it starts encrypting again.\n\n384\n00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.130\nAnd after that, you can keep\nusing the computer too, right?\n\n385\n00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.210\nComputer will be a little slow while it's\nencrypting but you can still work, so\n\n386\n00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:55.000\nyou're not kinda out of luck.\n\n387\n00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.880\nI can take that FAT32 drive and\ndo the same thing.\n\n388\n00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.980\nI'll turn on BitLocker and\nset up that password.\n\n389\n00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:05.700\nAnd it's a FAT32 drive which\nwouldn't normally support EFS but\n\n390\n00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:07.050\nit will support BitLocker.\n\n391\n00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:08.650\nAnd so I can encrypt that.\n\n392\n00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:11.680\nI'll save my recovery key,\njust like I did the other one.\n\n393\n00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.410\nAnd then we'll have that in place and\nwe'll be done.\n\n394\n00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:18.850\nSo, BitLocker, pretty easy to\nimplement and it's there, right?\n\n395\n00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:23.340\nNow when I logged in, the act of me\nlogging in and punching in a password on\n\n396\n00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:28.100\nthe drive that unlocks the drive so\nthat I have access to it.\n\n397\n00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:31.550\nAnd if I go to my computer here,\nsee how the drives have lock on them now?\n\n398\n00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:32.970\nAnd the locks are unlocked.\n\n399\n00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:36.680\nI can browse into my F drive and\nthere's my data.\n\n400\n00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:41.250\nBut if I were to reboot the computer,\nwhen you reboot the computer,\n\n401\n00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:43.270\nthe drives all lock again, right?\n\n402\n00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:45.930\nThey lock, and\nwe've gotta provide that password, so\n\n403\n00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:48.150\nif I were to give it a reboot, I'd come\nin, and these drives would be locked.\n\n404\n00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:51.500\nOr if I knew I was gonna be walking away,\nyou can always relock them yourself.\n\n405\n00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.820\nYou can go go into manage Bitlocker and\nthe option is buried in there.\n\n406\n00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:58.300\nBut it will automatically lock\non it's own when you reboot.\n\n407\n00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.710\nAnd that way if somebody else comes\nalong behind you they're not gonna have\n\n408\n00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:01.900\naccess to that data.\n\n409\n00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.640\nSo a couple of different ways\nto go about this, right?\n\n410\n00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.670\nWe can use EFS or we can use Bitlocker.\n\n411\n00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:08.300\nBoth are great solutions.\n\n412\n00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.200\n>> That's awesome, Don.\n\n413\n00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.420\nBeing able to have that nice safety net,\nthe security of the Bitlocker and\n\n414\n00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:16.440\nEFS systems on our system, well that\nlet's us know, hey you know what,\n\n415\n00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.530\nI can actually secure my data.\n\n416\n00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:22.770\nI've got a reasonable idea that\nI will not be compromised and\n\n417\n00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:24.170\nmy data will be compromised and\n\n418\n00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:27.320\nsomeone will get that and do heinous\nthings with that, we don't want that.\n\n419\n00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.630\nNow that's great and everything,\nwe've talked about this and\n\n420\n00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:31.580\nthis is on our systems though.\n\n421\n00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:36.050\nRight Don, it's not We live in\nthe times of data is on the go.\n\n422\n00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:38.760\nIt doesn't sit statically on\na hard drive for very long,\n\n423\n00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:43.290\nusually anyway, and if it's in the wild,\nhow do we protect it that way.\n\n424\n00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:45.370\n>> That's true.\nSo what we're looking at here,\n\n425\n00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:47.060\nthis is what's called data at rest.\n\n426\n00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:51.400\nIn the security world, they classify data\nas data at rest or data in motion, right.\n\n427\n00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.690\nData at rest is data sitting\nright there on your harddrive.\n\n428\n00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:56.940\nBit Locker, EFS,\nthey're great for data arrest.\n\n429\n00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:00.460\nBut let's say I take one of those files\nand I email it to somebody, right?\n\n430\n00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.350\nOr I want to upload to a website.\n\n431\n00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:03.300\nNow the data is in motion.\n\n432\n00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.200\nIt's moving across the network.\n\n433\n00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.450\nBit Locker and EFS don't apply.\n\n434\n00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:09.590\nThey do not apply to data in motion.\n\n435\n00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:12.620\nWhen you go to copy across a network,\nlike if this were a shared folder and\n\n436\n00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.380\nsomebody were browsing and\naccessing it as a shared folder,\n\n437\n00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:18.830\nthe data gets decrypted and\nthen sent over the network.\n\n438\n00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:19.730\nSo we're at risk there.\n\n439\n00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:21.510\nSomebody could intercept that data.\n\n440\n00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:23.355\nSo we need something\nelse to protect us there.\n\n441\n00:20:23.355 --> 00:20:26.335\nAnd there's several different protocols\nand technologies that are available for\n\n442\n00:20:26.335 --> 00:20:27.545\nyou to choose from.\n\n443\n00:20:27.545 --> 00:20:31.715\nFor example you might use VPN tunnels,\nvirtual private networks.\n\n444\n00:20:31.715 --> 00:20:34.765\nA VPN tunnel creates an encrypted\nconnection between you and\n\n445\n00:20:34.765 --> 00:20:39.215\nsomebody else, and all the traffic you\nsend across that link is encrypted, so\n\n446\n00:20:39.215 --> 00:20:40.895\npeople can't see what it is, right?\n\n447\n00:20:40.895 --> 00:20:42.550\nIt's kind of a nice thing to have.\n\n448\n00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:47.740\nYou can also use things like IPsec, IPsec\nis another type of network encryption,\n\n449\n00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:50.080\nit's built into the IPv6 protocol.\n\n450\n00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.270\nWe see that used for VPNs a lot but\nyou'll see it used increasingly more for\n\n451\n00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:55.650\nclient computers too\nover the next few years.\n\n452\n00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:58.710\nAnd then another option, one that\nyou guys have probably used before,\n\n453\n00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:01.790\nyou might be using right now,\nis SSL, right.\n\n454\n00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:04.090\nSSL, or secure socket layer.\n\n455\n00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:05.940\nWe all refer to it as SSL because\nthat's what it's been for\n\n456\n00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.020\nyears and years and years.\n\n457\n00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:09.530\nBut in reality, in the background,\nit's now something called TLS,\n\n458\n00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:11.110\ntransport layer security.\n\n459\n00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:15.190\nTLS replaced SSL, but\nmost people still call it SSL.\n\n460\n00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:18.810\nWhat it does is it allows us to quickly\nand easily connect to a host we've never\n\n461\n00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:21.990\ntalked to before and\nestablish an encrypted connection.\n\n462\n00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:24.710\nWhen you do VPN or IP sec,\nyou have to have a key,\n\n463\n00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:28.050\nyou've gotta give them the key,\nyou've gotta do a lot of setup, right?\n\n464\n00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:30.510\nBut with SSL and TLS, you don't have that.\n\n465\n00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:33.440\nYou can actually immediately build up\na session and generate a private key for\n\n466\n00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.220\nthat session.\n\n467\n00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:37.010\nBased on this trust structure\nthat's out there you know the whole\n\n468\n00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:40.090\ncertificate system and\nwhen that happens you can get reliable and\n\n469\n00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:42.550\ncryptic connections very very quickly and\nthey protect your data.\n\n470\n00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:43.410\nSo we see more and\n\n471\n00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:45.850\nmore stuff transitioning to\nuse technologies like that.\n\n472\n00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:48.940\nAnd let me just show you as an example\nhere kind of how that risk is.\n\n473\n00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:50.850\nRight, and\nI'm going to back out all this stuff.\n\n474\n00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:55.540\nAnd if I jump back here, I'm just going\nto fire up a little program, all right?\n\n475\n00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.670\nSo this is a program called Wireshark.\n\n476\n00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:00.890\nWireshark is what's called\na protocol analyzer and sniffer.\n\n477\n00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:04.710\nIt lets you watch a network and record the\ntraffic that's going on on the network.\n\n478\n00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:09.870\nSo for example I can grab my\nethernet adaptor here and\n\n479\n00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:13.300\nstart this thing recording and\nit's now running and\n\n480\n00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:16.590\nrecording what's going on\non my network adapter.\n\n481\n00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:19.000\nIf I were to fire up something\nlike Internet Explorer,\n\n482\n00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.510\nit's bringing up the MSN webpage.\n\n483\n00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:25.800\nAnd if I go back here over to Wireshark.\n\n484\n00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.760\nSee how there's a bunch\nof stuff appearing now?\n\n485\n00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.820\nThese are all the packets that I just sent\nacross the network over to Microsoft,\n\n486\n00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:33.090\nall recorded right here.\n\n487\n00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:34.240\nIf an attacker is on your network,\n\n488\n00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.520\nthey could run something similar to\nthis to collect data on the network.\n\n489\n00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:39.340\nAnd see it, okay?\n\n490\n00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:44.400\nWell, if I browse to a site\nlike let me browse to, we've\n\n491\n00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:48.040\ngot a little server here on the network\nthat has a management adapter in it.\n\n492\n00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.220\nAnd so here I'm browsing to the webpage\nfor that server, all right?\n\n493\n00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.680\nAnd it's got a log in and a password.\n\n494\n00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:59.450\nAnd so I might come in here and punch in a\nuser name and a password and log in, okay.\n\n495\n00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:01.950\nI'm putting in the wrong\npassword intentionally.\n\n496\n00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:04.220\nSo I tried to log in and it failed.\n\n497\n00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.990\nAnd this is an unencrypted connection.\n\n498\n00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:10.560\nAlright, well if somebody's running\na sniffer on the network they\n\n499\n00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.960\ncan capture that traffic and\nthey can see it.\n\n500\n00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:16.580\nSo for example if I jump back\nhere to my Wireshark program,\n\n501\n00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:19.980\nI can filter this traffic and here I see.\n\n502\n00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:23.860\nThe traffic going between my laptop and\nthat server.\n\n503\n00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:27.040\nAnd because it's just regular HTTP,\nit's not being encrypted.\n\n504\n00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:29.770\nAnd so I can look down here\nin the body of this data and\n\n505\n00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:31.980\nI can find out what it was that was sent.\n\n506\n00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:33.090\nI can see it.\n\n507\n00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:35.980\nAnd if we know what we're really\nlooking for, I can hunt right for\n\n508\n00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:37.170\nwhen I submitted that data.\n\n509\n00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.850\nAnd that'll be buried in here.\n\n510\n00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:42.790\nAnd we can jump in, locate the data and\n\n511\n00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:47.790\nactually find where the user name and\npassword was sent in plain text.\n\n512\n00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:50.550\nSo, looks like I've actually got a couple\nof different submission forms here.\n\n513\n00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:52.000\nLet's see if I can find the right one.\n\n514\n00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:56.510\nSome of these are fully protected and\nI won't be able to get data.\n\n515\n00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:57.690\nOh, this is the one right here.\n\n516\n00:23:57.690 --> 00:23:58.876\nThis is my winner.\n\n517\n00:23:58.876 --> 00:24:03.891\nIf I take this packet right here that\nwas sent between my work station and\n\n518\n00:24:03.891 --> 00:24:08.154\nthe server The data down here\nin the packet is plain text, and\n\n519\n00:24:08.154 --> 00:24:11.581\nif you sift through it\nright down here at the end,\n\n520\n00:24:11.581 --> 00:24:15.290\nname equals admin PWD equals password 1,\n2, 3.\n\n521\n00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:17.450\nThat's the username and\npassword that I typed a minute ago,\n\n522\n00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:19.850\nand they're right here in\nplain text in this packet.\n\n523\n00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:20.490\nRight?\n\n524\n00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:23.570\nThat's what happens,\nto data in motion if we don't secure it.\n\n525\n00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:27.216\nData being sent over the network,\nyou gotta remember, the Internet,\n\n526\n00:24:27.216 --> 00:24:31.166\nnetworks like these, they were\ncreated way back in the 1970s and 80s,\n\n527\n00:24:31.166 --> 00:24:34.111\nwhen networks were a lot safer,\nthey were a lot smaller.\n\n528\n00:24:34.111 --> 00:24:38.470\nOnly trustworthy individuals\nwere on the network.\n\n529\n00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:40.350\nIt's a lot different today,\nisn't it, right?\n\n530\n00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:44.820\nNetwork is massive,\nyou have no idea who's out there, right.\n\n531\n00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:48.160\nYou don't even know\nthe employee's of the ISP you use.\n\n532\n00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.280\nFor example our ISP?\n\n533\n00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.945\nI think I know two employee's over there.\n\n534\n00:24:51.945 --> 00:24:56.375\nWell they probably have over 100\nemployees, I only know 2 of them, right.\n\n535\n00:24:56.375 --> 00:24:59.585\nAll the others, they could be\nreally bad people, I don't know.\n\n536\n00:24:59.585 --> 00:25:00.415\nRight.\n\n537\n00:25:00.415 --> 00:25:04.721\nYou might be using AOL, or Google,\nor Yahoo for your email, Microsoft.\n\n538\n00:25:04.721 --> 00:25:06.997\nHow many employees do you\nknow at those companies?\n\n539\n00:25:06.997 --> 00:25:09.690\nMaybe not any, right?\n\n540\n00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:10.990\nIt may be that way.\n\n541\n00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:13.700\nAnd so you're trusting that they're\nprotecting your data while it's\n\n542\n00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:14.830\nin transit.\n\n543\n00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:16.700\nAnd the reality is you can't trust them.\n\n544\n00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.120\nYou can't trust these other people\nto have your best interests in mind.\n\n545\n00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.983\nAnd, that's not even counting\nthe attackers, right?\n\n546\n00:25:20.983 --> 00:25:24.280\nThere's people out there who are\nmaliciously seeking to get at your data.\n\n547\n00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.610\nSo you need to secure\nit with other things.\n\n548\n00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:30.250\nFor example,\nif I were to redo this whole process.\n\n549\n00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:35.460\nLet me switch back over to\nold Internet Explorer here.\n\n550\n00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:38.192\nI'm gonna just get me a nice\nblank tab going here, and\n\n551\n00:25:38.192 --> 00:25:40.400\nI'm gonna restart my Wireshark capture.\n\n552\n00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.920\nSo let me restart this one.\n\n553\n00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:48.729\nAnd this time, I'm gonna run this capture,\nand I'm gonna browse that server again,\n\n554\n00:25:48.729 --> 00:25:50.370\nand I'm gonna do it securely.\n\n555\n00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:52.370\nNow, I don't think I have a valid\ncertificate on this one, so\n\n556\n00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:53.560\nI might get a certificate complaint.\n\n557\n00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:54.070\nThere we go.\n\n558\n00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:56.090\nThen I'll move forward, past it.\n\n559\n00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:58.480\nSo this time I'm doing an https session.\n\n560\n00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.680\nRight?\nI'm doing a secure connection\n\n561\n00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.690\nto that same system.\n\n562\n00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:07.090\nAnd if I punch in admin and\npassword123, and try and\n\n563\n00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:10.840\nlog in, okay,\nI just sent my data to that system.\n\n564\n00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.700\nBut it did it using SSL.\n\n565\n00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.530\nIt did it using that transport layer\nof security in the background.\n\n566\n00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:18.380\nTo get me encryption between me and\nthat other end.\n\n567\n00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:22.500\nAnd if an attacker is running something\nlike this sniffer, they see that traffic.\n\n568\n00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:23.028\nOkay.\n\n569\n00:26:23.028 --> 00:26:25.344\nSee how it's showing up\nhere is TLS version one,\n\n570\n00:26:25.344 --> 00:26:27.161\nTLS version one that's the traffic.\n\n571\n00:26:27.161 --> 00:26:29.808\nAnd it's showing as encrypted data,\nall right.\n\n572\n00:26:29.808 --> 00:26:31.550\nLet me stop this.\n\n573\n00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:33.400\nAnd so\nas I start to look at the information,\n\n574\n00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:37.190\nlet me filter that down to just data\ngoing to that server, all right.\n\n575\n00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:38.917\nI can see that connection happening, and\n\n576\n00:26:38.917 --> 00:26:41.860\nthen I can see data being\nexchanged back and forth.\n\n577\n00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:43.560\nBut if I look at the data,\n\n578\n00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:47.060\nthe raw data that's kind of down\nhere at the bottom of the screen.\n\n579\n00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:49.750\nWhereas before I actually saw words,\nand I could read it and\n\n580\n00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:53.330\nI found that user name and password,\nnow I just see jumbled mess.\n\n581\n00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:56.160\nI can't interpret what that is.\n\n582\n00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:00.010\nAnd, if I search for that http post,\nlike we did a moment ago, and\n\n583\n00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:02.740\nI apply that, I don't find anything.\n\n584\n00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:06.220\nAnd that's because to find the post\ncommand, that was inside the data,\n\n585\n00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:07.710\ninside the payload.\n\n586\n00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:09.690\nAnd when it was unencrypted\nI could find it.\n\n587\n00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:11.940\nNow that it's encrypted, I can't find it.\n\n588\n00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:15.090\nThis data, it means nothing.\n\n589\n00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:19.480\nIf we were to reassemble this whole\ntransport stream, it's kinda neat.\n\n590\n00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.330\nLike here, let's see if we\ncan follow that, there we go.\n\n591\n00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:26.820\nSo if somebody were watching this in\naction, you can see that when I first\n\n592\n00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:31.000\nhit the server, your initial touch on\nthe server, does have to be unencrypted.\n\n593\n00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.590\nYou have to say hey,\nI'm connecting to you.\n\n594\n00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:35.450\nAnd then the other side is gonna say okay,\n\n595\n00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:38.960\nlet's agree on an encryption key,\nand start the encryption.\n\n596\n00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:39.500\nRight.\n\n597\n00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:43.300\nSo I can see that connection start and\nright here, I see super micro computer.\n\n598\n00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:45.126\nThat's the manufacturer of that server.\n\n599\n00:27:45.126 --> 00:27:47.750\nAnd I can see that we're talking, right.\n\n600\n00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:50.408\nAnd there's some basic information\nbeing exchanged right here.\n\n601\n00:27:50.408 --> 00:27:55.041\nAnd this is us agreeing on what\nencryption to use, all right.\n\n602\n00:27:55.041 --> 00:27:58.870\nAnd you'll see the agrees kind of happen\nhere, we've got these like server hello\n\n603\n00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:02.820\ncertificate, server hello,\nthese are the certificate exchanges.\n\n604\n00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:07.110\nAnd then once that exchange is done,\nthen we start sending our actual data.\n\n605\n00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:10.480\nAnd that data that's going across,\nis being encrypted and\n\n606\n00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:11.840\nit means nothing anymore.\n\n607\n00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.160\nSo that secures our data in motion.\n\n608\n00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:17.500\nSo remember, BitLocker,\nEFS, they're great.\n\n609\n00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:18.700\nBut don't stop there, right?\n\n610\n00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.296\nMake sure your network\ncommunications are secure.\n\n611\n00:28:20.296 --> 00:28:21.710\nUse VPN tunnels.\n\n612\n00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:25.990\nUse SSL and TLS whenever you can,\nto make sure that data is secure,\n\n613\n00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:28.350\notherwise people can intercept it and\nthey read it.\n\n614\n00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:29.610\n>> Awesome demonstrations, Don.\n\n615\n00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:32.700\nThat is the meat and\npotatoes of encryption right there.\n\n616\n00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:33.980\nWhat Don just showed you,\n\n617\n00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:37.660\nis basically how encryption is\ndone in the modern day society.\n\n618\n00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:39.760\nSo, if you're running\na Windows Operating System,\n\n619\n00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:42.950\nnow you know how you can encrypt\nthe data that is on that system.\n\n620\n00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:44.650\nUse that BitLocker, it's there for you.\n\n621\n00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:48.350\nSo, take advantage of it, and make sure\nthat if you're using any sensitive data\n\n622\n00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:53.950\nthat is in motion, that TLS is also being,\nso that little https, that is important.\n\n623\n00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:54.590\nThanks a lot, Don,\n\n624\n00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:57.000\nis there anything else that we need\nto talk about before we cut out?\n\n625\n00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.030\n>> One little thing I thought\nabout as you were mentioning that.\n\n626\n00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:03.470\nSome of you might remember from Windows\nVista where BitLocker was only available\n\n627\n00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:06.100\nfor the Enterprise customers,\nand not available for everybody.\n\n628\n00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:08.090\nIt is now available in\nevery version of Windows.\n\n629\n00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:09.690\nSo if you're running WIndows 8 or\nWindows 10,\n\n630\n00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:12.400\nevery version supports Bitlocker\n,and it doesn't cost you any money.\n\n631\n00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.390\nThat's what made me think of\nit when you said that Daniel.\n\n632\n00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:15.218\nIt's there for you, right?\n\n633\n00:29:15.218 --> 00:29:16.541\nUse it, it's free.\n\n634\n00:29:16.541 --> 00:29:17.100\n>> That's right.\n\n635\n00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:19.170\nThank you Microsoft, and thank you Don!\n\n636\n00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:20.580\nGreat demonstrations.\n\n637\n00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:22.900\nAlright, everyone hopefully,\nyou enjoyed this episode.\n\n638\n00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:24.240\nWe had a great time making it.\n\n639\n00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.080\nThanks for watching.\n\n640\n00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.160\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n641\n00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:28.770\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n642\n00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:30.145\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n643\n00:29:30.145 --> 00:29:35.980\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:17.450\nI'll be your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.414\nHere with me as usual, well,\nit's none other than Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:20.414 --> 00:00:21.450\nHow is it going Don?\n\n6\n00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.580\n>> It is going great Daniel\nglad to be back on the show and\n\n7\n00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.314\nexcited to jump into device security.\n\n8\n00:00:27.314 --> 00:00:30.840\nNow device security,\nyou probably thinking much like me,\n\n9\n00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.400\nwait a minute am I watching\nthe same episode again,\n\n10\n00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.300\ndidn't we just do an episode not too long\nago on BitLocker and drive encryption\n\n11\n00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.510\nstuff, and now we're back to the device\nencryption or device whatever?\n\n12\n00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.900\n>> Security.\n\n13\n00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.510\n>> We are, but it's a different angle.\n\n14\n00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.740\nSecurity's a big field.\n\n15\n00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.300\nThere's a lot of different\nconcepts out there,\n\n16\n00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.570\na lot of different things\nthat we need to be aware of.\n\n17\n00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.360\nWhat we're gonna look at now are some\nof the built in protection features\n\n18\n00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.730\ninside of windows that help\nto secure our systems,\n\n19\n00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.920\nand keep us safe from the various\nthings that are out there.\n\n20\n00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.120\nStuff we can take to improve security.\n\n21\n00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.960\nEncryption is a piece of that, right?\n\n22\n00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.250\nA piece we've already covered.\n\n23\n00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.220\nBut there's other things we\nneed to be aware of too, so\n\n24\n00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.880\nthat's what we're gonna kinda\ntackle here as we jump through and\n\n25\n00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.050\nlook at some of the different\nadventures in Windows security.\n\n26\n00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.750\nNow, where I wanna start\nis with network security.\n\n27\n00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.250\nMicrosoft knows that,\n\n28\n00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.520\nif you have a computer that's not plugged\ninto a network, it's pretty safe, right?\n\n29\n00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.820\nIf somebody wants to hack into\na computer not attached to a network,\n\n30\n00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.950\nthey have to have physical\naccess to that machine, right,\n\n31\n00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.920\nit's like Tom Cruise\nin Mission Impossible,\n\n32\n00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.010\nthey gotta drop down from the ceiling and-\n>> They got their work cut out for\n\n33\n00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.480\nthem [LAUGH]\n>> It's hard to break into\n\n34\n00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.730\na machine that's not\nplugged into a network.\n\n35\n00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.870\nBut a machine that is plugged\ninto a network is almost always\n\n36\n00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.270\nconnected to the internet.\n\n37\n00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.460\nAnd when you're connected to the internet,\nall of a sudden it becomes far more easier\n\n38\n00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.302\nfor external people to try and\nreach into your computer.\n\n39\n00:01:46.302 --> 00:01:49.360\nAll right, and so that's where we need to\ntake a few steps to make sure we protect\n\n40\n00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.280\nour systems, that we take some action.\n\n41\n00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.790\nNow, for the most part,\nit's already configured for us.\n\n42\n00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.220\nMicrosoft has already set things up.\n\n43\n00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.012\nSo, this is one of those objectives, if\nyou look at the official exam objectives,\n\n44\n00:02:00.012 --> 00:02:01.979\nit's all describe this, describe that.\n\n45\n00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.620\nBecause there's not\na lot to configure here.\n\n46\n00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.850\nIt's already set up.\n\n47\n00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.190\nBut we need to be aware of what Windows is\ndoing for us in the background because,\n\n48\n00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.720\nwell, the exam tackles that, and\n\n49\n00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.620\nthere are some times that we need to\njump in there and tweak and configure.\n\n50\n00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.980\nSo let's start with networks.\n\n51\n00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.332\nIf you have been watching all\nthese shows in the series, well,\n\n52\n00:02:18.332 --> 00:02:22.210\nyou know that we did file and print\nsharing back a couple of episodes, and\n\n53\n00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.110\nwhen we did file and printer sharing\nat the very beginning of the episode,\n\n54\n00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.260\nI fired up my network and went to\nbrowse network and what did it say?\n\n55\n00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.910\nIt said that file and printer\nsharing was disabled by default, and\n\n56\n00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.720\nI had to turn it on.\n\n57\n00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.860\nMicrosoft assumes that,\nif you want a feature you will turn it on.\n\n58\n00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.640\nThey're not going to turn a bunch of\nfeatures off by default because not\n\n59\n00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.530\neverybody uses them.\n\n60\n00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.110\nYou can potentially be opening\nyourself up to weakness.\n\n61\n00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.750\nAnd so, they need to have a certain\nunderstanding of how you use your computer\n\n62\n00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.770\nthat they can't have.\n\n63\n00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.030\nMicrosoft doesn't know\nhow I use my computer.\n\n64\n00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.710\nThey don't call me when they\ndesign operating systems.\n\n65\n00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.580\nI don't know why not, but they don't.\n\n66\n00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.200\nSo, it's up to me to make sure\nthe computer works the way I want it, and\n\n67\n00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.970\nMicrosoft does the best they can to\nconfigure it in a default manner\n\n68\n00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.310\nthat's secure.\n\n69\n00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.840\nBut it's up to me to kind\no tweak it to my needs.\n\n70\n00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.690\nA great example of that is networking.\n\n71\n00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.470\nLet me show you here on this machine.\n\n72\n00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.190\nSo if I browse to my hard drive,\nI'm seeing my local drives,\n\n73\n00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.730\nthat's no big deal, right.\n\n74\n00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.660\nBut if I go to network,\nI'm now browsing my network, right, and\n\n75\n00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.300\nI start seeing devices that are out there.\n\n76\n00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.270\nSo I see some Ruckus on our network,\nI see my computer.\n\n77\n00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.140\nYeah, I see a lot of stuff.\n\n78\n00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.980\nCouple of some Mac Minis,\nNate's computer, right?\n\n79\n00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.925\nI'm browsing the network and\nI'm seeing these other machines.\n\n80\n00:03:28.925 --> 00:03:33.070\nOkay, now, I want that because\nI'm on my private network.\n\n81\n00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.360\nI'm on the network here with all the guys.\n\n82\n00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.210\nI know who owns all of these machines.\n\n83\n00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.130\nRight?\nSo, every\n\n84\n00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.490\none of these I can account for it.\n\n85\n00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.010\nI know this network.\n\n86\n00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.130\nBut what if I go to Starbucks and I am\ngetting a cup of coffee and I want to just\n\n87\n00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.140\nlog into my computer and check my mail\nreal quick, and I use their free Wi-Fi.\n\n88\n00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.270\nDo I know all the people on that network?\n\n89\n00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.540\nDo I know who's out there on that system?\n\n90\n00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.780\nNo, I don't.\n\n91\n00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.650\nAnd some of them could be honest people\nwho just want a cup of coffee, and\n\n92\n00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.180\nsome of them could be various people\nthat are waiting to break into\n\n93\n00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.730\ncomputers just like mine.\n\n94\n00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.930\nAnd so, we need to take precautions.\n\n95\n00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.630\nWhen you connect to a network,\nWindows will actually\n\n96\n00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.350\nask you the first time you connect,\nwhat type of network is it?\n\n97\n00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.780\nIs it public, or private?\n\n98\n00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.630\nAnd there's different security levels,\ndepending on which one you choose.\n\n99\n00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.190\nRight?\nThis one, I must have chosen private.\n\n100\n00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.070\nAnd that's why its finding\nall these computers,\n\n101\n00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.530\nall this functionality's working.\n\n102\n00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.330\nIf I chose in public, this wouldn't work,\nI wouldn't see these people.\n\n103\n00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.940\nAll right?\n\n104\n00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.640\nWe have public and private networks.\n\n105\n00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.190\nMicrosoft divides them up like that\nbecause of the different security levels.\n\n106\n00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.240\nNow, in other vendor certifications,\nwhatever.\n\n107\n00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.310\nYou'll hear other terms like internet,\nintranet, extranet, right.\n\n108\n00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.700\nThey kind of apply to this.\n\n109\n00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.800\nInternet, that being the wide\nopen world that's out there,\n\n110\n00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.468\nthis huge network that's not\nnecessarily trustworthy, right.\n\n111\n00:04:48.468 --> 00:04:51.723\nSo you wanna have the best security\npossible when you're on the internet.\n\n112\n00:04:51.723 --> 00:04:56.145\nIntranet, that's your business network,\nyou're inside, intra, right,\n\n113\n00:04:56.145 --> 00:04:58.980\ninside your own network, that's trusting.\n\n114\n00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.500\nRight?\nYou trust those other systems.\n\n115\n00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.920\nYou control that environment.\n\n116\n00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.780\nSo, you can have a lower\nlevel of security and\n\n117\n00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.710\nyou can do things like network discovery.\n\n118\n00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:06.930\nRight?\nIt makes your\n\n119\n00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:07.990\nlife easier at home, at the office.\n\n120\n00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.040\nMany have extranets.\n\n121\n00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.618\nAnd what is that?\n\n122\n00:05:11.618 --> 00:05:15.670\nWell, an extranet,\nthat's when it's a network you trust, but\n\n123\n00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.670\nyou access it via\na network you don't trust.\n\n124\n00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:19.790\nSomething like the Internet.\n\n125\n00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:20.340\nRight?\nSo\n\n126\n00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.490\nI might cross the Internet to get to my\ncompany's website and log into a portal,\n\n127\n00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.530\nand then access resources\nin their environment.\n\n128\n00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.760\nThat's an extranet or Azure for\nthat matter, your cloud services.\n\n129\n00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.750\nYou might trust Microsoft Windows Azure,\nbut\n\n130\n00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.750\nyou don't trust the internet\nyou use to get there, right?\n\n131\n00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.520\nSo that's where we use VPN tunnels,\nSSL, TLS and all\n\n132\n00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.735\nthose other different things to encrypt\nour data to give us a secure connection,\n\n133\n00:05:42.735 --> 00:05:45.160\nthe network we do trust, right?\n\n134\n00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.380\nBut, as far as our laptop is concerned or\nour desktop when you connect to a network\n\n135\n00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.440\nit's gonna ask you public or private,\nwhich is basically internet or intranet.\n\n136\n00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.500\nLet me show you what it looks\nlike when I add something new.\n\n137\n00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.800\nSo, I'm physically cabled in, I've got\na physical cable plugged in and if\n\n138\n00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.270\nI were to, well if I can jump down to my\nsystem tray way down here at the bottom,\n\n139\n00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.230\nI see my network icon, and if I right\nclick on that and choose open network and\n\n140\n00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:11.250\nsharing center, it's gonna come up and\nI can see right here,\n\n141\n00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.340\nhere's the network it found on Ethernet\n2 and it shows the private network.\n\n142\n00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.320\nI must of chosen private,\nwhen I connected the first time.\n\n143\n00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.810\nLet me connect to a different network\nthat I haven't connected to before.\n\n144\n00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.680\nI'll jump on a wireless network.\n\n145\n00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.480\nSo in my list of networks over\nhere I've got ITProTV, right?\n\n146\n00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.270\nThat's our studio wireless.\n\n147\n00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.530\nAnd so I'm gonna jump onto that one.\n\n148\n00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.140\nNow, I've never connected to this one.\n\n149\n00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.330\nAnd so\nI've gotta remember what the password is.\n\n150\n00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.750\nThink that's it.\n\n151\n00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:37.620\nThere we go.\n\n152\n00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.730\nAnd now it asks me a very simple question.\n\n153\n00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:44.360\nIt says, do you want to find PC's,\ndevices, and content on this network and\n\n154\n00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.950\nautomatically connect the devices\nlike printers and TV's.\n\n155\n00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.470\nWe recommend you do this on your home and\nwork networks.\n\n156\n00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.480\nWhat it's asking me is,\nis this a public or a private network?\n\n157\n00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.130\nIs this an Internet or an Intranet?\n\n158\n00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:01.420\nIf I say yes, I wanna find devices on the\nnetwork, I'm gonna be a private network.\n\n159\n00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.790\nIf I say no, no I'm at Starbucks,\nI don't wanna find stuff on this network,\n\n160\n00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.910\nI don't wanna do that, then it's\ngonna be a public network, right?\n\n161\n00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.770\nOne that we don't trust,\nlike the Internet.\n\n162\n00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.640\nI'm gonna say no, all right.\n\n163\n00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.380\nI don't trust this network.\n\n164\n00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.630\nSo, it's now gonna connect to it.\n\n165\n00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:19.210\nI'm connected to that Wi-Fi network and\nI don't trust it.\n\n166\n00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.130\nNow, if I were to browse\nto my network right now,\n\n167\n00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.400\nI'm still gonna see all those\nother computers out there,\n\n168\n00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.340\nbecause I'm still plugged in on\nmy physical network adapter.\n\n169\n00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.810\nBut if I were to unplug my\nphysical network adapter,\n\n170\n00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:31.640\nI would only have the wireless, and\nnow it would be an untrusted network.\n\n171\n00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:33.660\nAnd you can spot that.\n\n172\n00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.530\nAgain, down in your system tray, if you\njust right-click on that computer icon,\n\n173\n00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:39.420\nyou can go to open Network and\nSharing Center.\n\n174\n00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.040\nAnd in the Network and Sharing Center,\nyou'll see the different networks you're\n\n175\n00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.460\nconnected to, and\nwhether they're public or private.\n\n176\n00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.300\nNow, something interesting happened for\nme.\n\n177\n00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.415\nI'm connected to the ITProTV network.\n\n178\n00:07:49.415 --> 00:07:52.869\nIt recognized that I'm actually\nconnected to the same network on\n\n179\n00:07:52.869 --> 00:07:57.158\nmy physical adapter and on my wireless\nadapter, and so it made them both public.\n\n180\n00:07:57.158 --> 00:08:00.933\nRight, it assumed, hey, you're saying the\nnetwork's public on this one adapter but\n\n181\n00:08:00.933 --> 00:08:04.007\nyou're connected on this other\nadapter where you said it was private.\n\n182\n00:08:04.007 --> 00:08:06.364\nWe're going to default to public\nbecause that's safe, all right.\n\n183\n00:08:06.364 --> 00:08:08.330\nAnd so,\nit's got your best interest in mind.\n\n184\n00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.000\nIt defaults to public.\n\n185\n00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.160\nIf you don't choose anything, like if you\njust cancel out of that wizard when it\n\n186\n00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.930\nasks you yes or no,\nit'll default to public.\n\n187\n00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.150\nThat's what it does.\n\n188\n00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:18.680\nAll right, you can change it.\n\n189\n00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.200\nIf you choose the wrong\none you can change it.\n\n190\n00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.150\nAll you have to do is\nbring up your charms bar.\n\n191\n00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:26.900\nSo swipe in from the right or\nI'll use Windows key C here and\n\n192\n00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.540\ngo down to settings.\n\n193\n00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.920\nAnd inside of our settings,\nyou'll see your network right there.\n\n194\n00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.730\nSo like I can see the ITProTV\nnetwork that I'm plugged in.\n\n195\n00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:38.490\nAnd if I click on that, I get a list\nof all my different networks, right?\n\n196\n00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:41.200\nThat's where I was a few\nminutes ago when I connected.\n\n197\n00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.430\nWell right up at the top,\nyou can choose view connection settings.\n\n198\n00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:47.260\nAnd if you hit that,\nhere's your networks, right?\n\n199\n00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.690\nThere's my Wi-Fi network,\nthere's my Ethernet network, and\n\n200\n00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:53.350\nI've got this manage known networks\nwhere we can kind of control\n\n201\n00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:55.250\nthe networks that we've learned about,\nright?\n\n202\n00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.290\nNow, on Ethernet you don't\nhave managed known networks,\n\n203\n00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:59.970\ncuz they assume you're only plugged\ninto one network with your Ethernet.\n\n204\n00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.480\nBut on wireless they assume you're\nconnecting to more than one network, so\n\n205\n00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.590\nit gives the option to manage networks\nyou're not even connected to it right now.\n\n206\n00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.240\nBut I can take this and\nI can click on one of them.\n\n207\n00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.150\nAnd right here, Find Devices and\nContent, I can override it.\n\n208\n00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.580\nIf it's off, I'm a public network.\n\n209\n00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.720\nIf it's on,\nI'm now a private network, okay.\n\n210\n00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.390\nAnd as a private network,\nit's a network that I trust, okay.\n\n211\n00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:23.551\nSo now that I trust it, I can go and\nscan for those devices and\n\n212\n00:09:23.551 --> 00:09:25.550\nfind them on the network and\nbe a little more friendly.\n\n213\n00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:27.419\nI have a little bit lower security.\n\n214\n00:09:27.419 --> 00:09:30.687\nNow, for the exam, that's kinda\nthe piece they want you to know, but for\n\n215\n00:09:30.687 --> 00:09:33.535\nreal life knowledge, just so\nyou guys are aware how this works,\n\n216\n00:09:33.535 --> 00:09:37.680\nwhat's really going on, is behind\nthe scenes there's a Windows Firewall.\n\n217\n00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.410\nAnd the Windows Firewall has\nall sorts of rules that define\n\n218\n00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:44.900\nwhat traffic is allowed to come into that\nnetwork adapter and what traffic isn't.\n\n219\n00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.910\nAnd depending on whether you\nchoose public or private,\n\n220\n00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:49.220\nyou're picking a completely\ndifferent set of rules.\n\n221\n00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:53.542\nAnd if you ever want to see that,\nif you just go to your Metro screen here,\n\n222\n00:09:53.542 --> 00:09:58.740\nwhich is, I think that's partly\n\n223\n00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:03.300\nwhy Microsoft went back to a start menu\nin Windows 10 is they just, forget that.\n\n224\n00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.600\nSo, if I go back into here, and\nwhatever this UI is called, and\n\n225\n00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.700\nI just type firewall, all right.\n\n226\n00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.974\nThere's actually two different\nfirewall utilities that are available.\n\n227\n00:10:10.974 --> 00:10:14.696\nThere's this one, Windows firewall, where\nyou can turn the firewall on and off.\n\n228\n00:10:14.696 --> 00:10:18.730\nAnd there's another one that's called,\nWindows firewall with advanced security.\n\n229\n00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.750\nAnd that's one that lets you\nsee the individual rules but\n\n230\n00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:21.530\nlet me start with this one.\n\n231\n00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:27.250\nIf I go into Windows Firewall right here,\nI can see that I have a firewall for\n\n232\n00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:30.830\nprivate networks and\nI've got a firewall for public networks.\n\n233\n00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:34.020\nIt's two separate firewalls, it's really\none firewall in the background but\n\n234\n00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.680\nit's two separate sets of rules.\n\n235\n00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.120\nThat you can configure.\n\n236\n00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.060\nAnd see how on private networks it says,\n\n237\n00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:44.950\nblock all connections to apps that are not\non the list of allowed apps, but we have\n\n238\n00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:50.020\nan active private network of ITProTV, and\nit's set up with a different set of rules.\n\n239\n00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:53.040\nWell down here on public it says block\nall connections to apps that are not\n\n240\n00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.780\non the approved list.\n\n241\n00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:59.320\nWell that's the same, but it's got\na different set of rules on the back end.\n\n242\n00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:02.550\nAnd if I go over here to like turn\nWindows firewall on or off, I could\n\n243\n00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:07.450\nactually turn the firewall on or off\nbased on wether it's private or public.\n\n244\n00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:09.710\nAnd you could choose whether\nto block all connections or\n\n245\n00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:12.090\nnot, based on whether it was public,\nor private.\n\n246\n00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:15.070\nSo on a private network, I might not\nwanna block all the connections.\n\n247\n00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:16.510\nLet other people connect to me.\n\n248\n00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:17.670\nI'm at home.\n\n249\n00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:20.870\nBut if I'm at Starbucks, I'm on a public\nnetwork, block those connections.\n\n250\n00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:21.670\nI don't want them.\n\n251\n00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:22.230\nRight?\n\n252\n00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:23.240\nKeep me secure.\n\n253\n00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.954\nSo you can specify that right here\nas more of a general setting.\n\n254\n00:11:27.535 --> 00:11:29.805\nBut, if we go into the Advanced Settings,\n\n255\n00:11:29.805 --> 00:11:31.265\nthat's where we can\nreally see some action.\n\n256\n00:11:31.265 --> 00:11:32.495\nAnd, you'll see that\nbutton right over here.\n\n257\n00:11:32.495 --> 00:11:33.605\nAdvanced Settings.\n\n258\n00:11:33.605 --> 00:11:35.435\nIf we click on that now,\n\n259\n00:11:35.435 --> 00:11:38.465\nwe're in the Windows Firewall\nwith Advanced Security tool.\n\n260\n00:11:38.465 --> 00:11:42.580\nIn here, you can see your inbound rules,\nand your outbound rules and\n\n261\n00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.430\nthis is all the traffic that's allowed\nin and out of your network adapters and\n\n262\n00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:48.540\nthis gets really complex fast right,\nit's a bunch of data.\n\n263\n00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:53.740\nAnd as you look at it, you'll see\nthis profile column over here and\n\n264\n00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.450\nsometimes it'll say all.\n\n265\n00:11:56.450 --> 00:12:00.570\nSometimes it'll say private and public,\nso these are rules that apply to both.\n\n266\n00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:04.180\nOther times, you'll see rules\nthat just apply to private, or\n\n267\n00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.370\nrules that just apply to public.\n\n268\n00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:08.870\nAnd in those scenarios,\n\n269\n00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:11.490\nyou're seeing something that's\neither being restricted or allowed.\n\n270\n00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:15.130\nHere, I've got file and\nprinter sharing for public.\n\n271\n00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:19.630\nAnd then right after it, I've got file and\nprinter sharing for private.\n\n272\n00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.090\nTwo different rules.\n\n273\n00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.360\nOne that applies on the public network,\none when I'm on a private.\n\n274\n00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.850\nSo, that's what's going\non behind the scenes.\n\n275\n00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:29.100\nIf you go on and do your MCSA,\nyou'll work with this tool a lot more.\n\n276\n00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:33.070\nFor the MTA, I just wanted you guys to be\naware of that difference and how it works,\n\n277\n00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:37.260\nthere's a lot of different rules and how\nthey work, and it's all in the background,\n\n278\n00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:41.208\nand it can be manipulating\n>> So Don, basically what we're looking at\n\n279\n00:12:41.208 --> 00:12:44.587\nis if you're on those private networks\nit's a little less restrictive,\n\n280\n00:12:44.587 --> 00:12:48.063\nif you're in those public networks\n>> It starts locking stuff down to try to\n\n281\n00:12:48.063 --> 00:12:48.834\nkeep you safe.\n\n282\n00:12:48.834 --> 00:12:49.670\n>> Yep, that's basically it.\n\n283\n00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:51.796\nYes.\nMicrosoft knows that most people don't\n\n284\n00:12:51.796 --> 00:12:52.572\nthink about that.\n\n285\n00:12:52.572 --> 00:12:55.178\nThat they'll take their laptop from\nnetwork to network to network and\n\n286\n00:12:55.178 --> 00:12:56.113\ntreat them all the same.\n\n287\n00:12:56.113 --> 00:12:59.667\nAnd so, here's their chance to step in and\nsay let me help you out, let me make it\n\n288\n00:12:59.667 --> 00:13:03.920\neasy to go from secure mode to less secure\nmode, and flip back and forth really easy.\n\n289\n00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.180\nAnd once you've done it once,\nit remembers the network,\n\n290\n00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.140\nyou don't have to do it again.\n\n291\n00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.850\nSo now, the end user doesn't\neven have to think about it,\n\n292\n00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:10.110\nand that's what makes it a great solution.\n\n293\n00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.120\nAll right,\nwell worrying about our network security,\n\n294\n00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.540\nthat's one piece we also have\nthe security of our own device.\n\n295\n00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.940\nSo let's keep running\nwith the Starbucks model.\n\n296\n00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.300\nI'm sitting,\nactually I don't go to Starbucks.\n\n297\n00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:22.938\nI just throw that in there.\n\n298\n00:13:22.938 --> 00:13:24.053\nWe're giving them a free plug.\n\n299\n00:13:24.053 --> 00:13:24.554\n>> Oh man.\n\n300\n00:13:24.554 --> 00:13:25.551\nWe're pushing them hard.\n\n301\n00:13:25.551 --> 00:13:27.896\n>> You go to your local\nfavorite coffee shop.\n\n302\n00:13:27.896 --> 00:13:28.651\nLet's do that.\n\n303\n00:13:28.651 --> 00:13:29.196\n>> There you go.\n\n304\n00:13:29.196 --> 00:13:34.666\nAnd you sit down at a table and your on\nyour laptop, your reading some email, your\n\n305\n00:13:34.666 --> 00:13:40.066\ndrinking your coffee, and as it is with\ncoffee, you have to go to the bathroom.\n\n306\n00:13:40.066 --> 00:13:42.532\nSo you decide, you know some of\nthe employees, you've seen them enough,\n\n307\n00:13:42.532 --> 00:13:43.520\nthey'll watch your laptop.\n\n308\n00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.460\nSo you go, and you go to the bathroom.\n\n309\n00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.010\nWell, why your in the restroom\nin theory somebody can come and\n\n310\n00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:50.850\nsit right down at your computer and\ntry and get in, right?\n\n311\n00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:54.490\nNow if you're smart, you lock your\nscreen before you walk away, right?\n\n312\n00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:57.810\nIn Windows, you can hit Windows+L and\nyour system will lock.\n\n313\n00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:58.650\nIt's super easy.\n\n314\n00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:00.090\nI've just gotten in the habit\nthat when I get up,\n\n315\n00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:02.740\nI hit Windows+L, locks my screen,\nand that's that.\n\n316\n00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.570\nYou can do it through\nthe Start screen also.\n\n317\n00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:07.970\nYou can click your little face and\nchoose lock, it'll do it.\n\n318\n00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:09.960\nOr you can set a screensaver\nthat says after five or\n\n319\n00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.960\nten minutes screensaver kicks in and the\nscreensaver requires a password, right?\n\n320\n00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.360\nSo those are different\nways we can authenticate.\n\n321\n00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:19.450\nBut if somebody's watching over my\nshoulder and they see what my password is,\n\n322\n00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:22.610\nif they figure out what that password is,\nI can walk over to the restroom,\n\n323\n00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:26.270\nthey can sit right down, login as me,\nand start going at it, right.\n\n324\n00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:29.620\nNow, what that is, is it was\ncalled a shoulder surfing attack.\n\n325\n00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:32.780\nSomebody watches over your shoulder and\nthey see the password you typed in.\n\n326\n00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.670\nPasswords are not necessarily\nthe best ways authenticate.\n\n327\n00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:37.580\nBut they're the most common way, right?\n\n328\n00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.170\nPeople use usernames and\npasswords everywhere,\n\n329\n00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.460\nit is the most common\nform of authentication.\n\n330\n00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.350\nAnd that's because it's one\nof the simpler to deploy.\n\n331\n00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:49.640\nIn the security world there is three ways\nyou can authenticate people, all right.\n\n332\n00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:54.400\nSomething you know, something you have,\nand something you are.\n\n333\n00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.000\nAll right?\n\n334\n00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.010\nSomething you know.\n\n335\n00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:56.810\nThat's a password.\n\n336\n00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:57.670\nIt's in your mind.\n\n337\n00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:58.260\nRight?\n\n338\n00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.990\nI know my password.\n\n339\n00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:01.390\nOr a pin number.\n\n340\n00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:02.900\nI know my pin number.\n\n341\n00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:03.670\nMy pin number's 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n342\n00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:05.060\nIt's in my mind.\n\n343\n00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:08.320\nSo I wanna log into the computer,\nI need something I know.\n\n344\n00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.660\nThe problem is, if I know it,\nsomebody else could know it.\n\n345\n00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.510\nIf I tell Daniel my password,\nnow Daniel knows it.\n\n346\n00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.230\nAnd he can sit down and\nhe knows that he can login.\n\n347\n00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.540\nSo how do I prevent that?\n\n348\n00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:23.700\nWell, you can prevent it by switching\nto something like something you have,\n\n349\n00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.740\na tangible item, something that you have.\n\n350\n00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:27.740\nWhat's an example of that?\n\n351\n00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.430\nWell, smart cards.\n\n352\n00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:30.900\nSmart cards, they look like a credit card,\n\n353\n00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:35.160\nthey have a little microchip on them, and\non the chip they store a certificate.\n\n354\n00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.050\nAnd so,\nif your computer has a smart card reader,\n\n355\n00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:40.390\nyou can sit down at the computer and\nput in your smart card.\n\n356\n00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:41.330\nNow you're logged in and you work.\n\n357\n00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.920\nAnd then when you have to go to\nthe bathroom, you'll lock your screen,\n\n358\n00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.490\nyou take your smart card out,\nand you go to the bathroom.\n\n359\n00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:49.594\nIf somebody sits down at your computer,\nthey might know your password, but\n\n360\n00:15:49.594 --> 00:15:52.178\nit's not going to get them in\nbecause they need the smart card.\n\n361\n00:15:52.178 --> 00:15:54.036\nThey don't have that item.\n\n362\n00:15:54.036 --> 00:15:56.381\nAnd I can't share my login\nwith somebody else, can I?\n\n363\n00:15:56.381 --> 00:15:59.296\nI can't say Yeah Daniel,\nif you ever need to log into my computer,\n\n364\n00:15:59.296 --> 00:16:00.978\nthis is what my smart card looks like.\n\n365\n00:16:00.978 --> 00:16:03.680\nHe has to have the card, right?\n\n366\n00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.660\nSo something you have is\na higher level of security.\n\n367\n00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:10.770\nHere's the problem though, Daniel, do you\nhave a smart card reader in your computer?\n\n368\n00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:12.970\n>> I do not have a smart\ncard reader on my computer.\n\n369\n00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:15.700\n>> Have you ever owned a computer\nwith a smart card reader?\n\n370\n00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.170\n>> I cannot say that I have.\n\n371\n00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:21.335\n>> So [LAUGH] I,\nin my illustrious career of computing.\n\n372\n00:16:21.335 --> 00:16:22.170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I've had\n\n373\n00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:23.990\none computer with a smart card reader.\n\n374\n00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:27.130\nAnd it was cuz I specifically sought\nout to get a computer with a smart card\n\n375\n00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:28.560\nreader and it was a long time ago.\n\n376\n00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.280\nIt's not very common, right?\n\n377\n00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.570\nSo if you're gonna use smart cards,\n\n378\n00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:33.610\nthey'll typically have those\nexternal readers that attach.\n\n379\n00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:37.080\nYou can get USB ones or whatever,\nbut they're just not that common.\n\n380\n00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.710\nSmart cards really didn't catch\non the way that they hoped.\n\n381\n00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:42.160\nAnd now that technology is\nbeing used in credit card for\n\n382\n00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.974\nthat pin chip,\nwhatever authentication they do.\n\n383\n00:16:44.974 --> 00:16:47.640\nBut on a computer,\nsmart card really didn't make it.\n\n384\n00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:52.090\nInstead, they moved from\nsomething you know like passwords,\n\n385\n00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:54.750\nto something you have like a smart card.\n\n386\n00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:58.863\nNow they've moved on to something you are,\nsomething you are,\n\n387\n00:16:58.863 --> 00:17:01.180\nthat's biometrics, right?\n\n388\n00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:06.212\nSomething that I am,\nlike a fingerprint, a retinal scan,\n\n389\n00:17:06.212 --> 00:17:11.759\na palm prints, voice activation,\nface, what's that called?\n\n390\n00:17:11.759 --> 00:17:13.644\n>> Facial recognition.\n\n391\n00:17:13.644 --> 00:17:14.956\n>> Facial recognition, there we go.\n\n392\n00:17:14.956 --> 00:17:15.745\n>> If I can get the word out.\n\n393\n00:17:15.745 --> 00:17:18.040\n[LAUGH].\n>> So those technologies right?\n\n394\n00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.860\nCan I say, yeah, Daniel,\nif you need to log into the computer,\n\n395\n00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:20.690\njust borrow my face.\n\n396\n00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:23.981\n>> Yeah, let me just [LAUGH]-\n>> We all saw that John Travolta movie,\n\n397\n00:17:23.981 --> 00:17:27.426\nI guess it's possible, but-\n>> Hold very still, Don [LAUGH].\n\n398\n00:17:27.426 --> 00:17:30.398\n>> See you can't just give somebody that,\nit's something you are,\n\n399\n00:17:30.398 --> 00:17:33.040\nit's something that's\na part of your being.\n\n400\n00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.980\nAnd the cool part there is what kind of\ninvestment do you need to make in that?\n\n401\n00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:38.580\nWell with a smart card,\nyou've gotta buy a smart card,\n\n402\n00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:41.670\nbut you have to buy somebody\na fingerprint, they've already got it.\n\n403\n00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:44.770\nEvery employee you hire already has\nthe equipment they need to authenticate.\n\n404\n00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:48.100\nThey've got a face, or they've got\na voice print or a retinal scan,\n\n405\n00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.910\nthey've got that as part of their being.\n\n406\n00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:51.990\nNow, we still need a way to check it,\nright?\n\n407\n00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:58.390\nWe need a way to read that information and\nthings like voice print scanner.\n\n408\n00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:59.312\nThat's easy enough, right?\n\n409\n00:17:59.312 --> 00:18:00.278\nYou just have a microphone.\n\n410\n00:18:00.278 --> 00:18:03.550\nA fingerprint, though.\n\n411\n00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:06.580\nA facial recognition, I guess facial\nrecognition, you just need a camera.\n\n412\n00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:09.128\nBut there's different types\nof cameras that do it.\n\n413\n00:18:09.128 --> 00:18:12.470\nIf you wanna check some more\nadvanced things like retinal scans,\n\n414\n00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:13.820\nyou gotta have a retinal scanner.\n\n415\n00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:16.680\nSo there is still equipment\nthat's involved, but\n\n416\n00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.500\nit's equipment that's not as\nuncommon as a smart card.\n\n417\n00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:25.050\nFor example, a lot of laptops, they've\ngot that fingerprint reader on them.\n\n418\n00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:25.910\nOr cell phones and\n\n419\n00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.090\ntablets, you're starting to see\nthem with fingerprint readers.\n\n420\n00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:30.140\nIt's becoming more and more common, right?\n\n421\n00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:33.130\nThat becomes an alternate\nform of authentication.\n\n422\n00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.430\nBut again even if you don't\nhave a fingerprint reader,\n\n423\n00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:38.420\nbecause in my laptop I don't\nhave a fingerprint reader.\n\n424\n00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.920\nIf I want one, I wanna authenticate with\na fingerprint reader, you can go out and\n\n425\n00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.310\nyou can buy a little one like this.\n\n426\n00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:46.731\nThis is a USB fingerprint\nreader right here,\n\n427\n00:18:46.731 --> 00:18:51.600\nI think this cost me $15 on Amazon,\nthese are not expensive.\n\n428\n00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.797\nYou can get fingerprint readers that\nare a couple of hundred dollars and\n\n429\n00:18:54.797 --> 00:18:58.100\nthose are really useful if you got\na fingerprint reader that tons of people\n\n430\n00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:59.560\nare gonna be using, right?\n\n431\n00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:03.718\nA lot of scanning, but if it's just\none computer and it's just you.\n\n432\n00:19:03.718 --> 00:19:06.068\nYou can get a really inexpensive\nfingerprint reader and\n\n433\n00:19:06.068 --> 00:19:07.510\nthey work great, okay.\n\n434\n00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:10.819\nYou might have a fingerprint reader built\ninto your computer, they're easy to spot.\n\n435\n00:19:10.819 --> 00:19:13.709\nCuz the part that actually works,\nthere's this little glass plate in here,\n\n436\n00:19:13.709 --> 00:19:15.730\nyou can see it shine in\nthe studio lights there.\n\n437\n00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:17.750\nThat little glass plate, and\nthere's a camera underneath it.\n\n438\n00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:21.190\nAnd when you swipe your fingerprint\nover it, it's basically reading your\n\n439\n00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:24.400\nfingerprint and identifying points\nwhich your computer can then use to\n\n440\n00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:28.490\ncompare to a fingerprint on file,\nand if they match, you login, right?\n\n441\n00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:32.360\nSo there's not much to these,\nit's really like a really cheap webcam.\n\n442\n00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.510\nThat's really all a fingerprint reader is,\n\n443\n00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:38.630\nthere are more advanced ones\nthat check body temperature.\n\n444\n00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:40.600\nRight, cuz I don't wanna get too morbid,\nbut\n\n445\n00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.330\nyou wanna make sure doesn't\nhave a fake finger.\n\n446\n00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:44.922\nLike they took an impression\nof your fingerprint,\n\n447\n00:19:44.922 --> 00:19:48.793\nyou also wanna make sure it's still\nattached to a living human being [LAUGH].\n\n448\n00:19:48.793 --> 00:19:49.432\n>> Heat it up.\n\n449\n00:19:49.432 --> 00:19:51.764\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] I guess you could.\n\n450\n00:19:51.764 --> 00:19:53.153\nSo there are some that do that.\n\n451\n00:19:53.153 --> 00:19:55.255\nIt's trying to get\na little more [INAUDIBLE].\n\n452\n00:19:55.255 --> 00:19:55.824\n>> It does.\n\n453\n00:19:55.824 --> 00:19:58.030\n>> I'm not even going to do the Demolition\nMan reference that I normally do.\n\n454\n00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:02.066\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So anyhow you've got those technologies\n\n455\n00:20:02.066 --> 00:20:05.640\nbut a simple one really does\njust boil down to a camera.\n\n456\n00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.090\nIt's all it is and so\nit's gonna scan your fingerprint and\n\n457\n00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:09.820\nbasically let the system know.\n\n458\n00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:13.045\nWell, Windows by default uses a password,\nright?\n\n459\n00:20:13.045 --> 00:20:13.665\nThat's what it wants.\n\n460\n00:20:13.665 --> 00:20:16.755\nIn Windows 10, they're staring to push\nkind of pin numbers a little more, but\n\n461\n00:20:16.755 --> 00:20:19.225\nin Windows 8, Windows 7,\nit's still a password.\n\n462\n00:20:19.225 --> 00:20:20.545\nRight, that's what they want.\n\n463\n00:20:20.545 --> 00:20:24.658\nBut Windows 8 has support for smart cards,\nit has support for fingerprint readers,\n\n464\n00:20:24.658 --> 00:20:26.158\nyou just have to add it, okay?\n\n465\n00:20:26.158 --> 00:20:29.847\nIf you add it to your system, it'll be\nthere, let me show you what I mean.\n\n466\n00:20:29.847 --> 00:20:34.867\nSo, here on this system, I'm gonna\nunplug my fingerprint reader, right,\n\n467\n00:20:34.867 --> 00:20:38.030\nso I'm just gonna unplug\nit from the computer.\n\n468\n00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:39.960\nIf I go into my settings, right?\n\n469\n00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:44.500\nSo if I jump into the charms bar and\ngo into Settings and\n\n470\n00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.530\nthen from here go way down here to\nthe bottom and Change PC settings.\n\n471\n00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:51.590\nIn my Change PC settings,\nI left it on Network for earlier, so\n\n472\n00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:53.530\nnormally we'd come right\nhere to this screen.\n\n473\n00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:56.450\nAnd in here, we see PC and\ndevices, Accounts and so on.\n\n474\n00:20:56.450 --> 00:21:00.040\nWe can jump into our Accounts,\nand here's my account, and\n\n475\n00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.645\nI can see my Sign-in options.\n\n476\n00:21:01.645 --> 00:21:05.670\nAnd under Sign-in options, it's listing\nthe different things that I can do.\n\n477\n00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:08.380\nI can do Password,\nI can do a Picture password.\n\n478\n00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.710\nI can do a PIN,\nI can do a Password policy.\n\n479\n00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:11.470\nNotice fingerprint?\n\n480\n00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:15.030\nI can't do a Fingerprint,\ncuz I don't have a fingerprint reader.\n\n481\n00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:17.530\nBut if I add one, let's see if this works.\n\n482\n00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:19.880\nWindows is pretty picky\nabout fingerprint readers,\n\n483\n00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:23.110\nit kind of expects them to be\nthere when the system boots up.\n\n484\n00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:25.000\nIf it's not there when\nthe system boots up,\n\n485\n00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.150\na lot of times it won't recognize it and\nacknowledge it.\n\n486\n00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:30.735\nSo right now if I go to my Sign-in\noptions, it did, it showed up, all right.\n\n487\n00:21:30.735 --> 00:21:33.397\nIf you have a fingerprint reader\nattachment that doesn't show up though,\n\n488\n00:21:33.397 --> 00:21:34.600\njust reboot your computer.\n\n489\n00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.450\nWhen you reboot it, it will turn up,\nthat usually solves it.\n\n490\n00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:40.160\nIf you boot up and you don't have\na fingerprint reader attached,\n\n491\n00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.230\nthis little category doesn't even show up.\n\n492\n00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:43.580\nAnd so you would just see Password,\n\n493\n00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:45.940\nPicture password, PIN and\nPassword policy, right.\n\n494\n00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.810\nSo those options would be right there,\nbut we can come in and choose those.\n\n495\n00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:52.630\nIf I had a retinal scanner attached,\nif I had a smart card reader attached,\n\n496\n00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:55.010\nthose would show up as\noptions in here also.\n\n497\n00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:59.550\nAnd I can convert my account\nfrom being a password\n\n498\n00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:00.537\nover one of these other systems, okay?\n\n499\n00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.840\nAnd some of them are pretty neat,\nlike the picture password.\n\n500\n00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.640\nWith the picture password\nyou can add in a photo,\n\n501\n00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:10.950\nit does require your real\npassword to get this set up.\n\n502\n00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:12.830\nYou can take a photo,\neither one of theirs, or\n\n503\n00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:16.800\nyou can choose a picture and\npick one of your own if you've got some.\n\n504\n00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.024\nI'm not sure that I have any\npictures on this computer.\n\n505\n00:22:22.741 --> 00:22:23.940\nI probably don't, do I?\n\n506\n00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:27.025\nSo, if you don't have any pictures,\nthat's a little bit of a problem, I guess.\n\n507\n00:22:27.025 --> 00:22:29.850\n[LAUGH] But you can load a picture in and\n\n508\n00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:32.890\nonce you've got a picture, you can\nbasically, it's really designed for\n\n509\n00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:37.310\ntouchscreens, you can take your finger and\ndraw a few patterns on the picture, right?\n\n510\n00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:41.410\nAnd when you've got those patterns on\nthe picture, then when you go to log in,\n\n511\n00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:43.580\nit just shows you the picture and\nyou drag it.\n\n512\n00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:47.190\nSee, they're kind of showing you here like\ndragging down or they tapped this plant,\n\n513\n00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:49.960\nthey dragged to the next plant,\nand then they did a circle.\n\n514\n00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.900\nSo would somebody sitting down to my\ncomputer know to do that when they\n\n515\n00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:54.160\nsee these plants?\n\n516\n00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.190\nProbably not, but I know, and I can do it.\n\n517\n00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:57.660\nAnd on a touch screen it works great.\n\n518\n00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:00.530\nOn a mouse like I have,\nnot so great there, right?\n\n519\n00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:01.870\nBut, you gotta kinda pick and\n\n520\n00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:04.660\nchoose your authentication based\non what's most appropriate.\n\n521\n00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:06.400\nNow, which one's the best?\n\n522\n00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:09.020\nIt's hard to say, right?\n\n523\n00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:10.890\nSome of them they each\nhave their weaknesses.\n\n524\n00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:14.890\nA password, somebody could watch over\nyour shoulder and see a picture password.\n\n525\n00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:17.510\nSomebody could watch over\nyour shoulder and see, right?\n\n526\n00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:18.370\nWith a picture password,\n\n527\n00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:20.810\nif you have a touchscreen, somebody\ncould get your computer and look for\n\n528\n00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:24.100\nthe smudges on the glass and\npossibly see what the picture password.\n\n529\n00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.640\nSo there's weaknesses to each of them.\n\n530\n00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.430\nA better option is to use more than one.\n\n531\n00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:30.010\nRight?\n\n532\n00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:33.290\nUsing more than one,\nthat's like multifactor authentication.\n\n533\n00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:37.890\nNone of these are multifactor\nauthentication by themselves.\n\n534\n00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:41.110\nMultifactor authentication is\nwhen you use more than one.\n\n535\n00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.670\nRight?\n\n536\n00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:44.170\nTwo different passwords\nto be able to get into,\n\n537\n00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:48.560\ntwo different authentication\nmethods to get authenticated.\n\n538\n00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.656\nSo I might have a password and\na PIN number.\n\n539\n00:23:51.656 --> 00:23:55.774\nOr I might have a password and\na fingerprint, a picture password and\n\n540\n00:23:55.774 --> 00:23:58.459\na PIN number, but\nI have to do both to get in.\n\n541\n00:23:58.459 --> 00:24:01.839\nNow if an attacker gets\none it's not good enough.\n\n542\n00:24:01.839 --> 00:24:03.940\nThey have to have both to get it.\n\n543\n00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:07.380\nSo not only do I have to put my smart card\nin but I also have to put a password.\n\n544\n00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:08.900\nNow, why would I do that?\n\n545\n00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.400\nWell, two reasons.\n\n546\n00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.680\nOne I might want to\nchoose a weaker password.\n\n547\n00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:16.410\nI'm getting tired of these really hard\npasswords that are hard to remember.\n\n548\n00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:18.190\nI might wanna be able\nto pick a weaker one,\n\n549\n00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:21.940\nknowing that having the second form of\nauthentication is gonna cover me, right?\n\n550\n00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:25.560\nThe other reason is\nthe smart card is something\n\n551\n00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:27.510\nphysical that I've got to have right here.\n\n552\n00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:31.130\nIf somebody installs a keylogger on\nmy system, and I type in my password,\n\n553\n00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:32.700\nthey know my password.\n\n554\n00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:36.100\nBut it's not going to do them any good\nbecause they've gotta have the smart card\n\n555\n00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:41.040\nalso, so the two forms of authentication\ncombine to give us one really secure one.\n\n556\n00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.980\nAnd you're seeing that a lot more, there's\na lot of websites where you go to log\n\n557\n00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:47.110\nin and they say okay this is the first\ntime you've logged into this computer,\n\n558\n00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:49.780\nwe're going to send you a text\nmessage to your cellphone.\n\n559\n00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:51.800\nSo to log in you've gotta\nhave your password.\n\n560\n00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:54.470\nBut now you gotta have your cell phone\nalso to receive that text message to get\n\n561\n00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:55.260\nthe code to log in, right.\n\n562\n00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:56.720\nThat's getting to be really common.\n\n563\n00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:57.430\nOr even email.\n\n564\n00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:01.540\nWe're gonna send an email to you, so now,\nto log in, you had to have your password\n\n565\n00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:04.540\nto the site, but you also had to\nhave access to your email account.\n\n566\n00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:08.140\nThat's multifactor, and that is\ngetting to be more and more common.\n\n567\n00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:09.560\nYou even see it here inside of Windows,\n\n568\n00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.680\nlike if I were to go in and\nadd my Microsoft account, okay?\n\n569\n00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:15.380\nSo, if I were to choose to connect\nto a Microsoft account and\n\n570\n00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:19.740\npunch it in and it's gonna ask\nme what my user account is and\n\n571\n00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.210\nwhat its password is, and\nI'm gonna have to provide that.\n\n572\n00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:26.770\nAnd on my Microsoft account,\nI use multi-factor authentication.\n\n573\n00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:31.460\nSo if I punch in donpezet@hotmail.com and\n\n574\n00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.670\nI punch in my password,\nwhich I think I remember.\n\n575\n00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:36.270\nLet's try that.\n\n576\n00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:40.170\nSo that's my user name and\nmy valid password, and it just connected.\n\n577\n00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:40.930\nAnd what's it saying?\n\n578\n00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:43.150\nIt's saying well, I need a code.\n\n579\n00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:46.570\nI need this code that goes\nalong with your user account.\n\n580\n00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:51.160\nAnd this code, for me, I generate it on\nan application that I run on my cellphone.\n\n581\n00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:55.930\nSo if I break out my cellphone here and I\nfind that application, I can jump in here,\n\n582\n00:25:55.930 --> 00:26:01.020\nI can launch it, and then on here,\nI can locate what that's gonna be,\n\n583\n00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.330\nand so, well I guess that doesn't\nreally show up on the camera,\n\n584\n00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:07.290\ndoes it, so, if you look, it's hard to\nshow things like this on camera because\n\n585\n00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:12.120\nthe studio lights will make a, will\nmake our screen really kinda disappear.\n\n586\n00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.920\nBut basically there's\na number here on the screen.\n\n587\n00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.500\nAnd the number's changing\nevery 30 seconds.\n\n588\n00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:20.440\nAnd so all I have to do is look at it and\nsay okay, well this is the current number.\n\n589\n00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:24.391\nI'm gonna type it in, and\nthat's gonna get me authorized.\n\n590\n00:26:24.391 --> 00:26:27.615\nOkay, if that number changes,\nwhich it will in the next few seconds.\n\n591\n00:26:27.615 --> 00:26:31.325\nIf it does, then it's not gonna be\nvalid anymore and I can't log in.\n\n592\n00:26:31.325 --> 00:26:34.895\nSo if a hacker gets my password,\ngreat, they've got it.\n\n593\n00:26:34.895 --> 00:26:37.847\nBut to log in as me,\nthey're going to have to have\n\n594\n00:26:37.847 --> 00:26:40.897\nwhatever that current number is\nthat's changing every 30 seconds.\n\n595\n00:26:40.897 --> 00:26:42.507\nThat gets pretty hard\nto get that isn't it?\n\n596\n00:26:42.507 --> 00:26:43.027\nRight?\n\n597\n00:26:43.027 --> 00:26:44.837\nAnd those numbers can only be used once so\n\n598\n00:26:44.837 --> 00:26:49.200\nif I use it like I just did I've got to\nwait 30 seconds before I can log in again\n\n599\n00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.440\nbecause I have to wait for\nthe next number to generate.\n\n600\n00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:55.740\nThat's multi-factor authentication,\nand it's really a good thing to have.\n\n601\n00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.120\nIt's really a handy one.\n\n602\n00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.800\n>> Now is that the same thing as we\nused to see with the USB keys that had\n\n603\n00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:00.870\nthe rolling key?\n\n604\n00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:03.180\nIt changed every second or so, right?\n\n605\n00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.090\n>> Yeah, and you know, it's kind of sad.\n\n606\n00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:06.540\nI've got one of those, too.\n\n607\n00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.210\nIt's actually on my keychain here,\nand if I break it out.\n\n608\n00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:10.610\nSo, this is called a YubiKey.\n\n609\n00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:14.650\nThe one Daniel was describing, it\nactually has an LCD screen on the front.\n\n610\n00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:17.340\nAnd it's showing the number, and\nit's changing every so often.\n\n611\n00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:18.310\nRSA makes those, right?\n\n612\n00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:19.700\nRSA SecurID tokens.\n\n613\n00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:23.190\nThere's other vendors I think\nYubiKey has one that has codes.\n\n614\n00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:27.570\nBut this one, I like it,\nit doesn't have a screen on it, right.\n\n615\n00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:32.250\nIt just has a little kinda copper button\nand, I think it's copper, it might not be,\n\n616\n00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:33.090\nbut probably.\n\n617\n00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:34.890\nIt's a conductive material of some sort.\n\n618\n00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:38.870\nYou don't really need a screen\nbecause when you have a screen you're\n\n619\n00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:41.320\nseeing a number and you have to\ntype it in, you can make mistakes.\n\n620\n00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:44.980\nAnd one of the frustration points is\nthat if it changes every 30 seconds and\n\n621\n00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.930\nyou're 20 seconds in, it might take\nyou more than 10 seconds to type and\n\n622\n00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:49.150\nnow the number changes.\n\n623\n00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:51.950\nSo, the way this works is it's\ngot a USB connector on it.\n\n624\n00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:55.200\nAnd so when I need to put in my key\nI plug this into my USB port and\n\n625\n00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.050\nit shows up as a keyboard.\n\n626\n00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:59.980\nAnd I tap this little key\nbutton that's on here, and\n\n627\n00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:04.160\nwhen I tap that button, it sends the\nkeystrokes for whatever number is there.\n\n628\n00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.860\nSo instead of needing an LCD,\nit's gonna type it for me.\n\n629\n00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:08.260\nSo I don't even need to see the code.\n\n630\n00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:10.320\nIt just does it, and it's done, right.\n\n631\n00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.620\nSo, that's a really cool function.\n\n632\n00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:12.410\nThese are called Yubi keys,\n\n633\n00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:16.220\nthey cost less than $20 and\na lot of systems support them.\n\n634\n00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:18.700\nUnfortunately, Windows doesn't\nsupport them for logging in yet.\n\n635\n00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:21.670\nYeah, you actually can do it if you\nhave a Yubi authentication server and\n\n636\n00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:22.360\nall that stuff.\n\n637\n00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:25.110\nThey're just ways to make it where\nWindows will let you login that way, but\n\n638\n00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:27.950\nit's another form of\nmulti-factor authentication.\n\n639\n00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:31.330\nYou have your user name and password,\nand a code on top of that, right?\n\n640\n00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:33.650\nYou're logging in with\ntwo different things.\n\n641\n00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:37.030\nNow, some people get confused on this and\nthink username and password,\n\n642\n00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:38.810\nthat's multi-factor, right?\n\n643\n00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:42.200\nBut remember,\nyour username is not private.\n\n644\n00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.900\nIt's not a form of authentication.\n\n645\n00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:47.070\nYour email address is not private,\nit's not a form of authentication, right?\n\n646\n00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:48.527\nPeople know your email address.\n\n647\n00:28:48.527 --> 00:28:50.918\nMy email address is don@itpro.tv.\n\n648\n00:28:50.918 --> 00:28:54.545\nIf you wanna email me that's what\nyou have to use, and that's public.\n\n649\n00:28:54.545 --> 00:28:56.215\nI have to tell you that or\nyou can't email me, right?\n\n650\n00:28:56.215 --> 00:28:58.355\nSo that's not a form of authentication.\n\n651\n00:28:58.355 --> 00:29:02.380\nAnd anybody in the world could\nsay their email address was mine.\n\n652\n00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:04.190\nBut, that doesn't\nnecessarily mean that it is.\n\n653\n00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:07.039\nSo, that's not a valid\nform of authentication.\n\n654\n00:29:07.039 --> 00:29:09.130\nNow, we talked about some of these and,\nI know,\n\n655\n00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:10.770\nI talked about the thing I premiered.\n\n656\n00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:12.890\nI wanna show you guys actually\nsetting it up and using it, but\n\n657\n00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:14.740\nI've blabbed too long and\nwe've run out of time.\n\n658\n00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.600\nDaniel, do we have room in\nthe schedule for a part two?\n\n659\n00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:18.250\n>> We do.\nWe have plenty of room in the schedule\n\n660\n00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:18.830\nfor part two.\n\n661\n00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:22.080\nHopefully, we'll see you good folks\nthere when that hits the ground running,\n\n662\n00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.780\nwhich will be very, very shortly.\n\n663\n00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:26.100\nAs for this episode though,\nDon let's go ahead and wrap it up.\n\n664\n00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.070\nWe will see you at that part two.\n\n665\n00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:31.140\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n666\n00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:32.084\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n667\n00:29:32.084 --> 00:29:33.138\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n668\n00:29:33.138 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.250\nI'm your host, Daniel Lawry.\n\n4\n00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.240\nHere with me, well again,\nit's Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.700\nHow's it going today, Don?\n\n6\n00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.630\n>> I'm doing great, Daniel.\n\n7\n00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.300\nGlad to be back on the show and\nready to finish up what we started,\n\n8\n00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.320\nwith device security in the old part one.\n\n9\n00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.710\nIf you haven't watched that one already,\n\n10\n00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.360\nyou definitely want to jump over and\ncatch it.\n\n11\n00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.970\nWe talk about some of the different\nauthentication methods that were available\n\n12\n00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.810\nin Windows, and the different\nways that we can handle that.\n\n13\n00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.800\nAnd I wanted to go on to a part two,\n\n14\n00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.630\ncuz there was some things\nthat we didn't get to.\n\n15\n00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.611\nFor example I did a great job of-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n16\n00:00:42.611 --> 00:00:43.650\n>> Well I like to think\n\n17\n00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.380\nthat I did a great job.\n\n18\n00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.370\n>> If you do say so yourself.\n\n19\n00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.970\n>> I'm gonna brag about myself.\n\n20\n00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.870\nAbout showing a fingerprint reader and\nshowing biometrics and\n\n21\n00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.580\ndifferent ways that we can authenticate.\n\n22\n00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.510\nBut I never really set one up, did I?\n\n23\n00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.890\nI got this fingerprint reader, I just\nnever used it, so I definitely wanted to\n\n24\n00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.880\ntake a minute to show you guys this in\nuse, the kinda real world application of\n\n25\n00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.990\nbiometrics, cuz it's pretty handy and it's\ndefinitely something you want to know.\n\n26\n00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.920\nBut I also wanted to talk about some of\nthe different threats that are out there\n\n27\n00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.800\nthat we need to be aware of.\n\n28\n00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.440\nThe different types of attacks and\nthings that can come in, so\n\n29\n00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.780\nwe need to tackle that too,\nbecause it is on the exams.\n\n30\n00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.270\nJust some odds and ends that we need to\ntie up before we wrap this objective up.\n\n31\n00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.220\n>> Awesome, now Don you've got your\nlittle thumb print reader there.\n\n32\n00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.560\nI can't wait to see this because I've\nnever had to actually install one.\n\n33\n00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.280\nI've either had a laptop that one built\nin or we just didn't use that kind of\n\n34\n00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.030\nauthentication, so\nI'm excited to see this happen.\n\n35\n00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.780\n>> Yeah, for a built-in one, one that's\nbuilt in your laptop, whoever manufactured\n\n36\n00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.960\nthe laptop more than likely includrf\nthe drivers with the system.\n\n37\n00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.100\nAnd if you bought the laptop, and then\nformatted it, which is what I always do,\n\n38\n00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.940\nthen you lost that driver, but\nyou can usually get it from that vendor.\n\n39\n00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.430\nBut if you buy a stand\nalone fingerprint reader.\n\n40\n00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.600\nWhile there's actually only\na couple of different chips that\n\n41\n00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.650\nmanufacturer's out there.\n\n42\n00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.250\nSo there might be a hundred\ndifferent companies selling them,\n\n43\n00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.250\nbut there's really only two or\nthree chips that manufactures.\n\n44\n00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.980\nAnd most of the drivers\nare already built into Windows.\n\n45\n00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.990\nSo Windows will recognize your finger\nprint scanner usually without even\n\n46\n00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.390\na driver, but you may need to load it.\n\n47\n00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.340\n>> If you want to verify that your\nfingerprint scanner or whatever is being\n\n48\n00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.280\ndetected all we need to do is take\na look at our device manager and\n\n49\n00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.820\nit will be in the device manager.\n\n50\n00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.440\nI'm going to just kinda jump into that.\n\n51\n00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.710\nThere's a few ways to get to the device\nmanager, the easiest way in my opinion\n\n52\n00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.410\nis to find your computer icon\nhere on the start screen and\n\n53\n00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.090\nyou can just right click on it,\nchoose manage.\n\n54\n00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.630\nAnd that will take you into\nthe computer management utility.\n\n55\n00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.670\nYou can dive down into\nDevice Manager from there, and\n\n56\n00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.140\nany biometric scanners you have will be\nunder this Biometric Devices category.\n\n57\n00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.028\nAnd so I can look in there, and here's my\ntouch chip fingerprint coprocessor WBF\n\n58\n00:02:44.028 --> 00:02:46.130\nadvanced mode Very exciting.\n\n59\n00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.340\nRight?\nIt's advanced.\n\n60\n00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.430\nSo, it detected.\n\n61\n00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.520\nI didn't load a driver, I just plugged\nthe thing in and there it goes.\n\n62\n00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.470\nRight?\nSo,\n\n63\n00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.430\nit sees that I have a fingerprint reader.\n\n64\n00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.640\nThat's an easy way to verify.\n\n65\n00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.760\nIf I have a yellow triangle\nwith an exclamation point,\n\n66\n00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.230\nthat lets me know there's a problem and I\nprobably need to go and download a driver.\n\n67\n00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.420\nOr if it doesn't even\nshow up under Biometric,\n\n68\n00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.580\nit might show up down here under other\ndevices, which I don't have, but\n\n69\n00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.670\nif there's other devices,\nthat means it was unrecognized.\n\n70\n00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.320\nIt doesn't know what it is, and you\ndefinitely need to go and get a driver for\n\n71\n00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.080\nit then, right?\n\n72\n00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.210\nThat's part one.\n\n73\n00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.020\nThat's just the operating system\nseeing the fingerprint reader.\n\n74\n00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.890\nPart two is using it.\n\n75\n00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.310\nAnd when it to comes to using it, we need\nto double check under our user account\n\n76\n00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.990\nto make sure the fingerprint\nreader's being detected there.\n\n77\n00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.990\nTo do that, we go to our charms bar and\nonce we're on the charms bar, if you jump\n\n78\n00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:37.990\nover to Settings, you can go to Change PC\nsettings, way down here at the bottom.\n\n79\n00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.940\nAnd in this screen,\nyou can come into Accounts and\n\n80\n00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.030\nhere you'll find your account.\n\n81\n00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.660\nIt defaults to you.\n\n82\n00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.230\nYou could pull up other people's\naccounts if you needed to.\n\n83\n00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.090\nBut right after your account,\nyou'll see sign in options.\n\n84\n00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.140\nAnd here's where it shows all\nthe supported methods, right?\n\n85\n00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.960\nIf your fingerprint reader\nwas properly set up and\n\n86\n00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.210\ndetected, you should see fingerprint.\n\n87\n00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.650\nRight there, all right?\n\n88\n00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.920\nIf your fingerprint reader\nwasn't properly detected,\n\n89\n00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.740\nor was just now installed, it might not\nturn up and you might need to reboot.\n\n90\n00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.290\nAll right, so just be aware of that.\n\n91\n00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.960\nThose are kinda the two ways,\nlook at the Device Manager and look here.\n\n92\n00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.090\nWell, fortunately this is where\nI wanted to come to anyway,\n\n93\n00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.710\ncuz this is where I can\nset up My fingerprint.\n\n94\n00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:16.910\nAnd to add a fingerprint's pretty easy,\n\n95\n00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.700\nwe just click add,\nkind of why that button is there.\n\n96\n00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.470\nAnd then we need to type in our password.\n\n97\n00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.430\nIt needs to make sure we are who we say\nwe are, that it's not somebody else\n\n98\n00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.000\nsitting down at the computer and\nprogramming in their fingerprint.\n\n99\n00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.390\nWhich would then in turn lock me out.\n\n100\n00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.920\nRight?\n\n101\n00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.260\nSo I'll provide my current password,\nso it knows that it is me.\n\n102\n00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.830\nRight?\n\n103\n00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.960\nAnd now I can add a fingerprint.\n\n104\n00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.570\nNow, unfortunately, when you scan\na fingerprint, it's nearly impossible\n\n105\n00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.390\nto have your finger positioned\nexactly the same way when you scan it.\n\n106\n00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.480\nMicrosoft knows that.\n\n107\n00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.040\nSo they have you scan it more than once.\n\n108\n00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.580\nAnd, so, I'm gonna come through here,\nand I'm gonna scan my finger.\n\n109\n00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.090\nAnd, I'm just swiping it\nright over that sensor,\n\n110\n00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.025\nand we're just gonna kinda let it scan and\nget that information, right.\n\n111\n00:04:57.025 --> 00:05:00.774\nSo there went one, and\nthere went two, there went three,\n\n112\n00:05:00.774 --> 00:05:03.355\nand there went four, all right?\n\n113\n00:05:03.355 --> 00:05:06.775\nAnd, well it must not have\ngotten a great scan on me here.\n\n114\n00:05:06.775 --> 00:05:08.415\nSo it's asking me to do\nit a little bit more.\n\n115\n00:05:08.415 --> 00:05:10.415\nSo, I'll go ahead and\ngive it a break here.\n\n116\n00:05:10.415 --> 00:05:12.685\nAnd it's actually okay to move\nyour finger around a bit.\n\n117\n00:05:12.685 --> 00:05:16.055\nAnd see how I did it right there on six,\nit didn't actually go to eight.\n\n118\n00:05:16.055 --> 00:05:20.760\nIt finally got a good enough imprint of my\nfinger that it was willing to accept it.\n\n119\n00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.800\nWhat it's doing is, it's not actually\nsaving an image of your fingerprint.\n\n120\n00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.970\nA lot of people think it does that,\nit doesn't.\n\n121\n00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.700\nWhat it's doing is it's trying to locate\nunique points on your fingerprint, and\n\n122\n00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.360\nit's storing those points.\n\n123\n00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.440\nSo if somebody were to ever break into\nthe secure storage where this is placed,\n\n124\n00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.200\nthey wouldn't have a copy\nof your fingerprint.\n\n125\n00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.950\nThey would just see five or\n\n126\n00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.340\nsix different unique points\nthat identify your fingerprint.\n\n127\n00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.880\nAnd now when I scan my finger, it's gonna\nlook at what scanned in and look for\n\n128\n00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.000\nthose points to see if they match.\n\n129\n00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.640\nSo that's done and\nI've now got a fingerprint added.\n\n130\n00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.080\nNow, the neat part is\nthat we can add more.\n\n131\n00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.490\nI only scanned this finger right here.\n\n132\n00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.390\nOkay, now what happens if\n\n133\n00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.770\nI get a cut on that finger that's going\nto disrupt that fingerprint, isn't it?\n\n134\n00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.030\nNot always because it, the five points\nmight be outside of wherever that cut it.\n\n135\n00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.100\nBut it may well disturb that, right?\n\n136\n00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.580\nSo i may not be able to scan on this one.\n\n137\n00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.110\n>> You might have a Band Aid on.\n\n138\n00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.100\nMaybe?\n>> That would be hard, right?\n\n139\n00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.640\n>> If you have a band-aid,\n\n140\n00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.490\nany kind of bandage,\nany anything that might cover that.\n\n141\n00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.870\nMaybe you just got ink on the finger, and\nnow it's having a hard time reading that.\n\n142\n00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.210\nThere's all sorts of different things\nthat can interfere with a fingerprint, so\n\n143\n00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.050\nwe might wanna program\nmore than one fingerprint.\n\n144\n00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.300\nOr maybe I share my computer.\n\n145\n00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.460\nThis is my home computer,\nand my wife uses it so\n\n146\n00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.330\nI might want to scan\nher fingerprint in too.\n\n147\n00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.970\nDoesn't matter that she isn't me, I can\nadd her fingerprint into my account, and\n\n148\n00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.500\nnow I can unlock it and so\ncan she, as my back up, right?\n\n149\n00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.750\nOr maybe this is a phone.\n\n150\n00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.430\nAnd sometimes I'm holding it\nin my right hand and I want to\n\n151\n00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.690\nunlock it with my right thumb, and other\ntimes I'm holding it in my left hand and\n\n152\n00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.230\nI want to unlock it with my left thumb.\n\n153\n00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.300\nSo I might program in both thumbs so\nI can go either hand and\n\n154\n00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.920\nI do that with my actual phone.\n\n155\n00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.800\nSo you want to program in those and\nyou can add in as many fingerprints,\n\n156\n00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.960\nI don't know that there's\nactually a limit.\n\n157\n00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.880\nNever actually looked, but yeah,\nyou can just keep adding fingerprints and\n\n158\n00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.750\nit will store them and\nhave them available for your system.\n\n159\n00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.470\nAlright.\nBut now it's there and\n\n160\n00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.540\nI'm able to log in with that fingerprint,\nI've got that sign in option for\n\n161\n00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.550\nmy user account.\n\n162\n00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:12.220\nAll right.\n\n163\n00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.680\nIf I go and log out.\n\n164\n00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.970\nRight?\nSo, if I come here and take my user and\n\n165\n00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:17.800\nI'm gonna sign out.\n\n166\n00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.120\nAnd I get to my log in screen.\n\n167\n00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.780\nRight?\nSo, here's my Windows eight log in screen.\n\n168\n00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.100\nIt's still asked me for a password.\n\n169\n00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.510\nWell, why is it asking me for a password?\n\n170\n00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.290\nWhat's up with that?\n\n171\n00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:28.880\nDidn't I just put them in a fingerprint?\n\n172\n00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.880\nWell, it doesn't disable your password.\n\n173\n00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.600\nYour password's still there.\n\n174\n00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.790\nYour fingerprint is now\njust an alternate option.\n\n175\n00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.480\nSo I've got sign-in options and\nI can choose that and\n\n176\n00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.810\nI can pick between other methods.\n\n177\n00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:45.180\nI'm gonna pick fingerprint.\n\n178\n00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.146\nSo now it's saying to sign in I\njust need to swipe my fingerprint.\n\n179\n00:07:48.146 --> 00:07:52.411\nAnd so I'm just gonna come over here and\nswipe my fingerprint, and there we go,\n\n180\n00:07:52.411 --> 00:07:52.929\nI log in.\n\n181\n00:07:52.929 --> 00:07:55.392\nOn a phone or a tablet,\nthat means I get in a lot faster and\n\n182\n00:07:55.392 --> 00:07:57.759\nI don't have to type anything\non a keyboard, right?\n\n183\n00:07:57.759 --> 00:08:00.994\nThe passwords I use are always super\nannoying to type on a touchscreen\n\n184\n00:08:00.994 --> 00:08:01.566\nkeyboard.\n\n185\n00:08:01.566 --> 00:08:02.390\nThis gets me right in.\n\n186\n00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:03.760\nAll right?\n\n187\n00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.700\nAnd it's also more secure\nbecause it's something I\n\n188\n00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.540\nhave instead of something I know.\n\n189\n00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.930\nI don't have to reset my\nfingerprint every 60 days,\n\n190\n00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.410\nbut I do have to reset my\npassword every 60 days.\n\n191\n00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:15.240\n>> That is a helpful feature,\nthat is for sure.\n\n192\n00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.100\nAnybody that's every supported passwords,\npeople calling in saying oh,\n\n193\n00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:23.330\nI forgot my password or I locked myself\nout, this is like a godsend because\n\n194\n00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:27.970\nwe deal with that a good 30 to 40%\nof our day is resetting passwords.\n\n195\n00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.080\n>> If you're in a help desk\nposition it will be a common call.\n\n196\n00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.800\nSo definitely something\nthat you have to deal with,\n\n197\n00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.900\nfingerprints are great for that.\n\n198\n00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.670\nIt's always the same, it's something\nthey have, they can't share it.\n\n199\n00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:37.070\nSo it work's out.\n\n200\n00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.161\nAnd now that I'm logged\nin with my fingerprint,\n\n201\n00:08:39.161 --> 00:08:41.610\nif I were to log back out again,\nwatch what happens here.\n\n202\n00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:46.530\nSo, I'll log back out, and so\nI sign out, and now if I want to go and\n\n203\n00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:50.570\nlog back in, well it's right\nback to the password again.\n\n204\n00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:52.710\nSo the password is still there,\nit's available.\n\n205\n00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.540\nIf I get a cut on my finger,\nI could log in with my password, right,\n\n206\n00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:56.200\nI've got that option.\n\n207\n00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.620\nOr, I'm out of town and it's an emergency\nand I need somebody else to log in to my\n\n208\n00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.670\ncomputer, I could tell\nthem my password and\n\n209\n00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:05.280\nthey could login without\nhaving my fingerprint present.\n\n210\n00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.600\nSo, we kind of got that backup.\n\n211\n00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.920\nThis is not multifactor.\n\n212\n00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:08.710\nI'm not doing both.\n\n213\n00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:10.155\nI'm not doing a password and\na fingerprint.\n\n214\n00:09:10.155 --> 00:09:13.612\nI\"m just doing a fingerprint or\na password.\n\n215\n00:09:13.612 --> 00:09:17.220\nAnd we could add picture log in and\nall the other guys, and\n\n216\n00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.020\nthey would just show up as\nadditional buttons right here.\n\n217\n00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.750\nYou pick, you choose, and you log in.\n\n218\n00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:24.860\nSo that's how we use alternative\nauthentication inside of Windows.\n\n219\n00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.560\nPretty straight forward and there we go.\n\n220\n00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.970\nI guess the other scenario I should\npoint out is what if I'm traveling and\n\n221\n00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:33.820\nI forget my USB fingerprint reader, right?\n\n222\n00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.610\nSo if I forget the fingerprint reader,\n\n223\n00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:37.730\nthen I'm gonna have\na problem there aren't I?\n\n224\n00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:41.040\nBecause it's not gonna be able to scan,\nbecause I don't have it right?\n\n225\n00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.390\nSo I need a password to be able\nto get in as kind of a back up.\n\n226\n00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:46.210\nSo different reasons why I might\nchoose to have that or not.\n\n227\n00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:48.890\n>> Very cool technology Don,\nI'm a huge fan of the biometrics.\n\n228\n00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:49.940\nI think that's the neatest stuff.\n\n229\n00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.850\nI have an uncle that makes\nthe biometric devices.\n\n230\n00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:54.420\nIt's a very fascinating topic.\n\n231\n00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:55.960\nSo if you're interested in\nthat you can check that out.\n\n232\n00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.390\nYou can search the web for\ngood stuff on that.\n\n233\n00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:02.300\nNow, Don, we do have other stuff we need\nto talk about when it comes to security,\n\n234\n00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.350\nnamely when we're talking about baddies,\nright?\n\n235\n00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:09.550\nMalicious items floating around\ntrying to attack our systems, right?\n\n236\n00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:10.570\n>> Right.\nSo we've been talking about passwords.\n\n237\n00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:15.320\nWe've been talking about different ways of\nencrypting the files on our hard drive and\n\n238\n00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.130\nstuff like that.\n\n239\n00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:21.120\nAnd those are designed to stop a person\nfrom trying to get into your system.\n\n240\n00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.110\nBut in this day and age,\n\n241\n00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:26.030\nit's actually pretty rare for there to\nbe a person specifically targeting you.\n\n242\n00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:27.160\nThere's exceptions.\n\n243\n00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.600\nThere are websites and servers that\nindividuals are specifically targeting.\n\n244\n00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.530\nBut for the most part,\nthe internet is a really big place.\n\n245\n00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:37.550\nAns so\nif you're a person that's a hacker, or\n\n246\n00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:40.220\na malicious person that's\ntrying to attack and\n\n247\n00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:44.920\ninfect machines across the planet, you\nusually don't care whose machine it is.\n\n248\n00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:48.320\nYou're just looking for\nvulnerable machines to get into.\n\n249\n00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.260\nAnd so,\nyou'll want to automate that, right?\n\n250\n00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:54.870\nAnd that's what these attackers do,\nis they create these automated programs\n\n251\n00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:58.390\nthat can scan and hunt down and\npenetrate machines.\n\n252\n00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:02.890\nAnd then once they're into a machine,\nthey can make other things happen.\n\n253\n00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:06.070\nAnd the number one thing they make happen,\nemail spam relay.\n\n254\n00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:08.425\nRight?\nA lot of email spam relay happens through\n\n255\n00:11:08.425 --> 00:11:09.000\npeople's' computers.\n\n256\n00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.810\nThey don't even know it's\nthem that's doing it.\n\n257\n00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:13.680\nBut an attacker has infected their\nmachine somehow and they've done it.\n\n258\n00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.700\nAnd the way they achieve\nthat is with malware.\n\n259\n00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:21.220\nMalware is any software loaded on your\ncomputer that is doing something bad,\n\n260\n00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.580\nis doing something you\ndon't want it to do.\n\n261\n00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:28.520\nMalware has a very broad definition, it\ncould encompass a lot of different things.\n\n262\n00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.410\nI have a lot of software that does\nstuff I don't want it to do, but\n\n263\n00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.390\nit's actually for good.\n\n264\n00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:38.700\nBut there's malware, this malicious\nsoftware that gets on your machine and\n\n265\n00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:42.830\nit starts doing things like being an email\nspam relay, or starts infecting other\n\n266\n00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:47.650\npeople's machines, or\nis leaking your personal information out.\n\n267\n00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:49.220\nAnd so that's a real problem.\n\n268\n00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.650\nAnd there's different categories of\nmalware out that are out there, but\n\n269\n00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:54.850\nthey all kind of have\nthis one thing in common,\n\n270\n00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:58.460\nis that they're fairly automated and\nthey're indiscriminate.\n\n271\n00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.910\nThey are not targeting you specifically.\n\n272\n00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.540\nThey are targeting any vulnerable\nmachine they can find and\n\n273\n00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.010\nyours might just fit that category.\n\n274\n00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:07.770\nBut we need to be aware of\nthe different types and\n\n275\n00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:11.630\nwe need to be aware of what\nWindows does to help protect us.\n\n276\n00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:13.780\nSo I want to talk about that for\na minute just to make sure that\n\n277\n00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:15.690\nwe are kind of square on\nthe different terms that we see.\n\n278\n00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.000\nNow, I mentioned how malware\nis a really broad term.\n\n279\n00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:20.660\nAnd, it is.\n\n280\n00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.830\nRight?\nIt encompasses a ton of different\n\n281\n00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:26.790\nother terms, so let's talk about those\nother terms that kind of wrap up under it.\n\n282\n00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:31.280\nThe one that's the most commonly used\nis a virus, right, a computer virus.\n\n283\n00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:36.450\nThe first computer viruses were\nwritten way back in the 80s at least.\n\n284\n00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:38.200\nI know the first one that\nI ever had experience with\n\n285\n00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.840\nexperience with was the Michelangelo\nvirus, and that was in the early 1990s.\n\n286\n00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.700\nIt would go around and format your\nhard drive, it was a good time.\n\n287\n00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.510\nSo, those are examples, or\nis an example of a virus,\n\n288\n00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:53.140\nwhere it would get onto your machine and\nit would basically try and\n\n289\n00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:56.100\ninfect other machines, and then ultimately\nwould try and format your hard drive.\n\n290\n00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.110\nSo, that's what it did.\n\n291\n00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.480\nIt was very malicious.\n\n292\n00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.420\nSome are not as malicious as that though.\n\n293\n00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:04.460\nSome want to run behind the scenes and\nnot be noticed and be doing other things.\n\n294\n00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:06.790\nBut viruses all have one thing in common.\n\n295\n00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:10.230\nWhen you run a virus,\nit tries to replicate.\n\n296\n00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:12.880\nThat's really the definition\nof a computer virus.\n\n297\n00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.460\nNot what it does, right?\n\n298\n00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.620\nA computer virus doesn't\nnecessarily format your hard drive,\n\n299\n00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:18.760\nit doesn't necessarily send e-mail, but\n\n300\n00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.960\nthe one thing that it's guaranteed to do,\nis replicate, right?\n\n301\n00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.910\nViruses want to spread and\ninfect more machines.\n\n302\n00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:29.910\nSo any software that when you run it,\nautomatically tries to install itself on\n\n303\n00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:32.630\nother systems,\ncan be classified as a virus.\n\n304\n00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:35.280\nAnd a virus is typically\nconsidered malware, right?\n\n305\n00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.158\nI say typically, cuz you could say,\n\n306\n00:13:37.158 --> 00:13:40.120\nlike in an active directory environment\nwhere an admin is pushing software\n\n307\n00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.240\nout to clients,\nthat that can be considered a virus.\n\n308\n00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.770\nRight?\nBut it's not,\n\n309\n00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:47.580\nI mean it's working kind of similar,\nbut we intended for that to happen.\n\n310\n00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:48.890\nThat's our own purpose.\n\n311\n00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:51.740\nWith a virus,\nit's something we didn't intend.\n\n312\n00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.480\nBut there is a key point there\nthat we have to execute it.\n\n313\n00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.560\nYou have to run the virus\nbefore it can do its job.\n\n314\n00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:01.310\nSo if I have a USB key and\nthere's a virus on it and\n\n315\n00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:05.520\nI put that USB key in my computer,\nis the virus gonna infect my machine?\n\n316\n00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.630\nNot necessarily.\n\n317\n00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:07.880\nI have to execute it.\n\n318\n00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.730\nNow there are some tricky\nones that are designed so\n\n319\n00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:13.540\nthat when you plug them in your\ncomputer automatically executes them.\n\n320\n00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.215\nRight, they've infected\nthe firmware of the USB drive, or\n\n321\n00:14:16.215 --> 00:14:18.320\nyou have auto-run turned\non in your computer.\n\n322\n00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.270\nSo, when it sees that new drive, it just\nautomatically tries to run something.\n\n323\n00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:26.110\nSo, those can cause themselves to execute,\nbut somebody's gotta execute it and\n\n324\n00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:27.980\nthen from there it starts to replicate.\n\n325\n00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:30.070\nSo that's a virus,\nthat's the true definition of a virus.\n\n326\n00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:33.920\nAnother term we need to\nknow is the Trojan horse.\n\n327\n00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.950\nAnd the Trojan horse,\nit goes back to that old tale.\n\n328\n00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:38.830\nWhat is it?\nThe Greeks?\n\n329\n00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:39.860\n>> The Greeks.\nYeah, it was the Greeks.\n\n330\n00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:40.430\n>> Okay.\n\n331\n00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:45.940\nWhere the Trojan army was sacking,\nwas it Helena or somewhere?\n\n332\n00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:46.720\n>> It was the other way around.\n\n333\n00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.842\nThe Greeks were attacking the Trojans.\n\n334\n00:14:47.842 --> 00:14:53.328\n>> [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\nThey had attacked Troy.\n\n335\n00:14:53.328 --> 00:14:56.100\n>> And the battle was raging on,\nthey wanted to bring it to an end.\n\n336\n00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.910\n>> So they decided to make this giant\nwooden horse and hide the soldiers in\n\n337\n00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:04.250\nthere And give the horse as gift\nto the people of Troy, I guess.\n\n338\n00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.670\n>> Yes.\n>> As they wheeled the horse in to\n\n339\n00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:09.410\nthe city and out popped the soldiers and\nthey get an invasion from inside, right?\n\n340\n00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:11.540\nWell a lot of viruses and\n\n341\n00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:15.680\nmalware in general can be provided to\nyou in the form of a Trojan Horse.\n\n342\n00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.740\nYou download some software.\n\n343\n00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.920\nAnd you think you're getting one thing and\nyou run that software, and\n\n344\n00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.830\nthen it's got a malware attached to it.\n\n345\n00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:26.630\nAnd so it gets your system infected and\nyou get that.\n\n346\n00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:29.050\nYou go to a website,\nwanting to view certain content, and\n\n347\n00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:31.610\nthe website maliciously installs\nsoftware in the background.\n\n348\n00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:36.480\nThose kinda things, it's the malware\nmasquerading as something else,\n\n349\n00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.700\nand that's a Trojan horse.\n\n350\n00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:41.280\nAnd it's one of the most common ways,\na lot of people, when they tell you, man,\n\n351\n00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.810\nI just don't know how my\ncomputer got infected.\n\n352\n00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:46.509\nWell, they infected it\nthemselves by doing something.\n\n353\n00:15:46.509 --> 00:15:50.283\nI know it definitely wasn't intentional,\nnobody intentionally infects it.\n\n354\n00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:51.294\nWell, I guess Mike does\non the security shows.\n\n355\n00:15:51.294 --> 00:15:54.110\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> But nobody normal intentionally infects\n\n356\n00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:55.221\ntheir machine.\n\n357\n00:15:55.221 --> 00:15:57.462\nBut you can do it inadvertently.\n\n358\n00:15:57.462 --> 00:16:00.510\nBoy, is this really common with\nthe people that bootleg software.\n\n359\n00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:04.450\nPeople go onto Bit Torrent and they start\nbootlegging copies of Microsoft Office or\n\n360\n00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:05.390\nwhatever.\n\n361\n00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:07.180\nAnd you're like, man, I get Office for\nfree, that's awesome.\n\n362\n00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:11.050\nAnd then you install it not realizing\nthat whoever posted it up there\n\n363\n00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:13.720\nattached malware to it and\nyour machine is infected.\n\n364\n00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:17.820\nAnytime you get software from an untrusted\nsource, you have to be careful with that.\n\n365\n00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:18.700\nAnd Windows is careful.\n\n366\n00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.850\nWhen you go to download software\nfrom an untrusted source,\n\n367\n00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:23.660\nit It runs what's called SmartScreen.\n\n368\n00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:26.410\nSmartScreen is running in\nthe background to check to see,\n\n369\n00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:28.930\nis this software that other people\nhave run, other people have installed?\n\n370\n00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:29.500\nIs it safe?\n\n371\n00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:30.440\nShould I allow it?\n\n372\n00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.978\nRight?\nIt's checking that, so\n\n373\n00:16:31.978 --> 00:16:34.769\nSmartScreen is a part of Windows for\nthat, all right?\n\n374\n00:16:34.769 --> 00:16:36.610\nSo, that's a Trojan horse.\n\n375\n00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:40.170\nThe other one is ad ware, right.\n\n376\n00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:44.250\nWith viruses and Trojan horses we\nalways think about it attacking and\n\n377\n00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:47.360\ndamaging your system,\ndeleting files, whatever.\n\n378\n00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.060\nAd ware's a little bit different.\n\n379\n00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:52.240\nThey don't wanna delete your data,\nthey don't wanna slow your computer down,\n\n380\n00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.270\nthey don't wanna do anything like that,\nthey just wanna show you advertisements.\n\n381\n00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:58.520\nThey show you advertisements cuz when\nyou click on them they get money,\n\n382\n00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.230\nthey get pay per click revenue, right.\n\n383\n00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:02.860\nSo, they're generating revenue off of\nthis ad network that they're creating by\n\n384\n00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:04.560\ninfecting your machine and showing ads.\n\n385\n00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.300\nNow in the old days it was really\neasy to spot when you were infected,\n\n386\n00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.200\nbecause you'd get pop up windows, right?\n\n387\n00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.290\nYou'd be browsing the web and\nyou'd go to a website and all of sudden\n\n388\n00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:17.940\nyou'd get a pop up about a free lobster\ndinner or something crazy like that.\n\n389\n00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.510\nMan, why am I getting this pop up?\n\n390\n00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:20.554\nWhat's going on here?\n\n391\n00:17:20.554 --> 00:17:23.084\nOr, they'd do pop unders and\nyou'd browse all over the web and\n\n392\n00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:26.524\nyou'd close your browse and you'd see ten\nwindows in the background you didn't even\n\n393\n00:17:26.524 --> 00:17:28.692\nknow were there, and\nthey're all advertisements.\n\n394\n00:17:28.692 --> 00:17:31.361\nWell, sadly, people click on those.\n\n395\n00:17:31.361 --> 00:17:33.196\nPeople are like,\nI'd like a free lobster dinner.\n\n396\n00:17:33.196 --> 00:17:36.956\nAnd they click on it, so\nsome spyware author, whatever,\n\n397\n00:17:36.956 --> 00:17:39.198\nout there gets a few pennies on it.\n\n398\n00:17:39.198 --> 00:17:40.034\n>> You've won.\n\n399\n00:17:40.034 --> 00:17:40.859\nRemember that one?\n\n400\n00:17:40.859 --> 00:17:41.520\n>> You've won, yeah.\n\n401\n00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.252\n>> You've won.\n\n402\n00:17:42.252 --> 00:17:43.796\nOh man, that was a horrible one.\n\n403\n00:17:43.796 --> 00:17:47.347\n>> And if you're computer savvy, if\nyou're security savvy, you know about it,\n\n404\n00:17:47.347 --> 00:17:49.055\nyou know not to click on those things.\n\n405\n00:17:49.055 --> 00:17:52.271\nBut if you're somebody who's just\ngotten started in computers.\n\n406\n00:17:52.271 --> 00:17:53.721\nYou're a kid in high school.\n\n407\n00:17:53.721 --> 00:17:55.312\nYou're whatever.\n\n408\n00:17:55.312 --> 00:17:57.110\nYou're just learning.\n\n409\n00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:58.730\nYou don't know that.\nYou might think it's legitimate.\n\n410\n00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:01.500\nYou click on it and\nnow you've just contributed to that.\n\n411\n00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.150\nSo there is a lot that goes around.\n\n412\n00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:07.400\nAdware where it gets really hard to tell\nis some of the modern forms of adware\n\n413\n00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.600\nwhere it's not a pop-up it's not\na pop-under, you go to a web page and\n\n414\n00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.870\nthey inject the ads right\ninto the webpage right?\n\n415\n00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:15.620\nTake a web page like Google for example.\n\n416\n00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:18.220\nWhen you go to Google's homepage,\nwhat do you see?\n\n417\n00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.748\nYou see their logo and\na search box and that's it, okay.\n\n418\n00:18:21.748 --> 00:18:24.110\nIf I sit down on a computer and\nI fire up Google and\n\n419\n00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:26.427\nI see ads on that page,\nthat's a big red flag.\n\n420\n00:18:26.427 --> 00:18:27.332\nI'm like, wait a minute.\n\n421\n00:18:27.332 --> 00:18:29.863\nThere shouldn't be ads on that page and\nhere they are.\n\n422\n00:18:29.863 --> 00:18:32.476\nI know there's adware, right.\n\n423\n00:18:32.476 --> 00:18:36.420\nIf you go to other pages, like if you go\nto CNN's web page, it's so covered in ads,\n\n424\n00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.450\nyou might not notice.\n\n425\n00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.610\nRight, it's just another add right there.\n\n426\n00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:42.262\nAnd you don't know that it shouldn't\nbe there and it's not in place.\n\n427\n00:18:42.262 --> 00:18:48.322\nSo adware can be really difficult\nto diagnose and recognize.\n\n428\n00:18:48.322 --> 00:18:52.120\nThose are the main ones, there's other\nones, like I mentioned spy ware.\n\n429\n00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.490\nI'll just mention it here\nbecause I already said it, but\n\n430\n00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:56.680\nI won't delve into all\nthe other crazy ones.\n\n431\n00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:03.060\nSpyware is malware that installs on your\nmachine, and it records what you do.\n\n432\n00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.760\nUsually it's just key strokes and\ndata like that.\n\n433\n00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.680\nIt could be what webpages you visit.\n\n434\n00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.890\nIt could actually be screenshots of what\nyou're doing, or even activating your\n\n435\n00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:14.220\ncamera to recording video,\nwhat's going on in front of the computer.\n\n436\n00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:17.060\nIt can take any level of attack like that.\n\n437\n00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.850\nAnd it takes the data and\nit transmits it somewhere else.\n\n438\n00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:20.370\nAll right?\n\n439\n00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:22.010\nAnd there's a few different reasons for\nit.\n\n440\n00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:24.460\nIf it's key logging, they're trying\nto get your user credentials so\n\n441\n00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:25.420\nthey can compromise your accounts.\n\n442\n00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:26.340\nAll right?\n\n443\n00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:29.050\nIf it's the video camera,\nit's usually for blackmail.\n\n444\n00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:29.700\nRight?\nThey do the.\n\n445\n00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:33.020\nWhat's the name for it,\nI forgot what it is.\n\n446\n00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:37.320\nBut where they blackmail you and say, hey,\nwe saw you doing this on your camera, and\n\n447\n00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.490\nif you don't pay us a certain amount of\nmoney, we're gonna post this on YouTube,\n\n448\n00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:41.160\nand that's that.\n\n449\n00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.140\nSo that's another type\nof attack is spyware.\n\n450\n00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:48.180\nNow, all of these are examples of malware,\nbad software that we don't want.\n\n451\n00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.370\nAny software that you have that's\ndoing something you don't want it to,\n\n452\n00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.230\nthat's malware, right.\n\n453\n00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:54.650\nNow how do we protect from it.\n\n454\n00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:57.180\nWell, I mention things like SmartScreen.\n\n455\n00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:00.380\nSmartScreen is automatically part\nof Windows, it's running, and\n\n456\n00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.710\nit looks for when you download software.\n\n457\n00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:07.160\nSo if we fire up your start screen and\n\n458\n00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:11.080\njust type in SmartScreen, you'll see where\nyou can change your SmartScreen settings,\n\n459\n00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.816\nyou can turn it on and\noff for individual apps.\n\n460\n00:20:13.816 --> 00:20:16.810\nBut, with SmartScreen it's basically\njust watching your system and\n\n461\n00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:21.040\nsaying, all right,\nif you download a file let me just\n\n462\n00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.290\nrun it against this database\nthat Microsoft has and say,\n\n463\n00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:27.210\nare other people downloading this,\nis this a trusted download?\n\n464\n00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:29.300\nAnd if it is, we'll let it download.\n\n465\n00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.130\nBut if it's not,\nwe're gonna give you a warning and\n\n466\n00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:33.050\nsay, are you sure you wanna run this?\n\n467\n00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:34.350\nWe don't really trust it.\n\n468\n00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:36.620\nYou can still run it, but\nat least you get a warning, right?\n\n469\n00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.150\nSmartScreen gives you that warning.\n\n470\n00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:41.070\nSo, that's kind of a nice little feature,\nit's running in the background,\n\n471\n00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:42.720\nwe really don't have to tweak it.\n\n472\n00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.970\nIt just does what it does,\nand it kind of protects us.\n\n473\n00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:49.190\nBut here's the settings right here,\nWindows SmartScreen, and you'll see that\n\n474\n00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:53.980\nit is currently helping, it's turned on,\nand if I go to change settings, well,\n\n475\n00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:57.620\nI can chose to get administrator\napproval if it's an untrusted app.\n\n476\n00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:00.290\nOnly an admin can install untrusted apps,\nor\n\n477\n00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:03.940\nI can say warn, but\nany user can continue to install.\n\n478\n00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.790\nOr you can see don't do anything just turn\nit off right so this is the different\n\n479\n00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:12.070\nlevels of protection for any kind of\ndownloads that we do all right but\n\n480\n00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:15.330\nwhat if it's not a download what if it's\nsoftware being installed from a CD or\n\n481\n00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:20.100\nDVD well SmartScreen doesn't run on those\nso it doesn't protect us from that right?\n\n482\n00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.350\nSo there is limitations to\nwhat smart screen can do so\n\n483\n00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:28.348\nto couple with that to make us a little\nmore secure we probably want to leverage.\n\n484\n00:21:28.348 --> 00:21:31.950\nAntivirus and\nanti-spyware software, right?\n\n485\n00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:33.780\nCombined we call it anti-malware, right?\n\n486\n00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.920\nAnd it'll do viruses and spyware.\n\n487\n00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.860\nThere's tons of third party\nproviders out there and\n\n488\n00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:42.100\neverybody has their own preferences\nof which ones they like.\n\n489\n00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.550\nDaniel, do you have\na preference of anti-virus?\n\n490\n00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:46.650\n>> Yeah.\nI totally like the,\n\n491\n00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:48.690\nI can't think of the name.\n\n492\n00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:49.400\nMalware bytes.\n\n493\n00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.840\nMalware bytes is an awesome,\nawesome product.\n\n494\n00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.970\n>> Malware bytes, great for adware.\n\n495\n00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:58.000\nThey do well for anti-virus but\nnot so great on the virus side.\n\n496\n00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.815\n>> Specifically for anti virus,\n\n497\n00:21:59.815 --> 00:22:02.790\nKaspersky has won me over hands\ndown it's a fantastic product.\n\n498\n00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:08.340\n>> I'm a fan of the Trend Micro stuff\nthat's out there, they do anti virus and\n\n499\n00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:12.290\nanti malware or adware, spyware, whatever.\n\n500\n00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:15.795\nBut, it used to be commonplace,\nyou'd buy a Windows machine and\n\n501\n00:22:15.795 --> 00:22:18.616\nyou'd then turn around and\nbuy software like that.\n\n502\n00:22:18.616 --> 00:22:22.120\nMaybe McAfee, Semantic, Norton or\nwhatever, you'd buy that and then you'd\n\n503\n00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:25.802\nhave to do an annual subscription to keep\ngetting your signature updates, right?\n\n504\n00:22:25.802 --> 00:22:29.200\nTo download updates to recognize\nmalware on your system.\n\n505\n00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:33.200\nWell, Microsoft said,\nall of our customers, every one of them,\n\n506\n00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.600\nare having to go out and\nbuy antivirus software and so\n\n507\n00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.820\nit seems kinda unfair to\nmake them have to do that.\n\n508\n00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:41.320\nSo over the years what Microsoft\ndid is they went out and\n\n509\n00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:46.010\npurchased the company that made\nanti-malware or anti-adware software.\n\n510\n00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:47.135\nIt was a company called Giant.\n\n511\n00:22:47.135 --> 00:22:50.155\nAnd then they went and bought a company\nthat made anti virus software,\n\n512\n00:22:50.155 --> 00:22:53.581\nwhich was a company called, I can't\nremember the company was called Antigen,\n\n513\n00:22:53.581 --> 00:22:55.134\nor the product was called Antigen.\n\n514\n00:22:55.134 --> 00:22:57.920\nI think the product was Antigen and\nthe company was something else.\n\n515\n00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.961\nAnyhow, so they bought these companies and\nthey brought it in house.\n\n516\n00:23:00.961 --> 00:23:05.422\nAnd they evolved it and created their\nown anti-virus and anti-adware and\n\n517\n00:23:05.422 --> 00:23:10.610\nthey rolled it into one anti-malware\nproduct called Windows Defender.\n\n518\n00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:12.630\nIf you're running Windows 8 or\n\n519\n00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:16.190\nhigher, you have Windows Defender\ninstalled by default.\n\n520\n00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:20.320\nAnd it's doing anti-virus and\nanti-malware, anti-adware.\n\n521\n00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.370\nAnd it's free,\nit's part of your operating system.\n\n522\n00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:27.000\nIt's getting it's updates, it's doing\nit's scans, it's protecting your system.\n\n523\n00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.991\nAnd sure there's some anti virus products\nthat have a better accuracy rate then\n\n524\n00:23:30.991 --> 00:23:33.570\nothers, but it changes every month,\neach month.\n\n525\n00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:36.574\nOne month it might be Semantic that's the\nleader, the next month it might be McAfee,\n\n526\n00:23:36.574 --> 00:23:37.923\nalthough I find that hard to believe.\n\n527\n00:23:37.923 --> 00:23:40.259\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Another month it might be Trend Micro,\n\n528\n00:23:40.259 --> 00:23:41.680\nso it kind of varies.\n\n529\n00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:45.990\nBut if you go with the Microsoft solution,\nthey're monitoring it.\n\n530\n00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:48.681\nIt's in their best interest to keep\nyour system secure because they provide\n\n531\n00:23:48.681 --> 00:23:49.531\nthe operating system.\n\n532\n00:23:49.531 --> 00:23:51.319\nAnd it's a perfectly viable solution.\n\n533\n00:23:51.319 --> 00:23:54.748\nSo, for home users even business users,\nit's a great one.\n\n534\n00:23:54.748 --> 00:23:56.175\nThere's no way to centrally manage it, so\n\n535\n00:23:56.175 --> 00:23:57.810\nbusiness users typically\naren't gonna use it.\n\n536\n00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:00.030\nThey're gonna use some of the other\nproducts that are out there and\n\n537\n00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:02.010\nMicrosoft has some business class stuff.\n\n538\n00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:04.130\nBut for home users and small businesses,\n\n539\n00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:07.820\nWindows Defender is already on your system\nand already working, let me show you.\n\n540\n00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:11.070\nIf I bring up my Start screen,\nnow I'll just type in defender,\n\n541\n00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:12.030\nit should pop up there.\n\n542\n00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:13.200\nThere it is, Windows Defender.\n\n543\n00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:18.720\nAnd here we go, I can see it's running,\nmy PC is monitored and protected, and so\n\n544\n00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.100\nit's ready and scanning.\n\n545\n00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:23.050\nNow I do have a little problem here, I got\nrealtime protection on but my virus and\n\n546\n00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:26.740\nspyware definitions, created 792 days ago.\n\n547\n00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:28.000\n>> It's been a while then there.\n\n548\n00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.050\n>> It's a liitle outdated.\n\n549\n00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:30.540\nAll right, so we don't want that.\n\n550\n00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:34.030\nIn fact, you really don't want your\nvirus definitions to be more than one or\n\n551\n00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:35.450\ntwo days old.\n\n552\n00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:39.350\nMine's really old, well, that's because\nI did a default install of Windows 8 and\n\n553\n00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:41.230\napparently it's got two\nyear old definitions.\n\n554\n00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:44.470\nSo I need to do updates, now with\nthird parties, you have to sign up for\n\n555\n00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:45.390\na subscription service.\n\n556\n00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:46.320\nYou pay monthly or\n\n557\n00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:50.150\nannually to get those, but with\nWindows Defender, it's part of Windows.\n\n558\n00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:53.340\nAll I need to do is go to Windows Update\nand if I go to Windows Update,\n\n559\n00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.250\nI can download these new definitions.\n\n560\n00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:58.030\nSo if I just come in here and\n\n561\n00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:01.260\nlaunch Windows Update,\nI can go to Check for updates.\n\n562\n00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:03.563\nAnd it's gonna reach out to Microsoft and\ncheck for some updates,\n\n563\n00:25:03.563 --> 00:25:06.002\nyou'll see I'm not set to automatically\ninstall updates right now.\n\n564\n00:25:06.002 --> 00:25:08.240\nSo I'm gonna tell it to check and\nit's gonna reach out there.\n\n565\n00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.240\nNow, it's looking for updates for\nmy operating system, looking for\n\n566\n00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.840\nupdates for\nhardware drivers that Microsoft supports.\n\n567\n00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:18.160\nBut it's also going to look for\nupdates for Windows Defender and\n\n568\n00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.080\nit's gonna download those.\n\n569\n00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:22.660\nAnd I can see it found some new updates\nand if I look at the details, right,\n\n570\n00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:24.100\nwhat updates did it find?\n\n571\n00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:27.290\nWell, right here at the top,\nDefinition Update for\n\n572\n00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:31.510\nWindows Defender, these are the latest and\ngreatest, so I pull up the details.\n\n573\n00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:35.915\nThese are dated September 17,\n2015, what's the date today?\n\n574\n00:25:35.915 --> 00:25:37.710\nSeptember 18, right?\n\n575\n00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:39.820\nSo these were updated yesterday.\n\n576\n00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:43.490\nAnd I can download those right now, it\ndoesn't cost me a dime and we're in place.\n\n577\n00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:45.420\nSo for a home user or\nsmall business, these are great.\n\n578\n00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:49.010\nAnd it's just Microsoft saying look,\neverybody needs the software,\n\n579\n00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:50.240\nyou shouldn't have to pay extra for it.\n\n580\n00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.340\nLets just make it part of the OS and\nit's there.\n\n581\n00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.800\nYou can still install your\nown software if you want.\n\n582\n00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:58.670\nWhen you install other software, Windows\nDefender will disable itself and so\n\n583\n00:25:58.670 --> 00:25:59.950\nthen you just have your other software.\n\n584\n00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:02.980\nOf course, you won't be running two,\nit's not good to run two.\n\n585\n00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:04.000\nAnd some people think oh, I want two,\n\n586\n00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.530\nI want the double protection,\nit's not a good idea.\n\n587\n00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:08.690\nBut it'll disable itself and\nthen you'll have your other one,\n\n588\n00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:10.000\nso you still have that power.\n\n589\n00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.736\nBut if you don't want two, you can just\nuse Defender instead and it's free,\n\n590\n00:26:13.736 --> 00:26:15.130\nit's kind of a nice option.\n\n591\n00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:18.330\n>> Yeah, it's nice that the fact\nthat you bought an operating system,\n\n592\n00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:21.270\nit does want to make sure that\nyou don't have a bad experience.\n\n593\n00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:23.050\nBecause if you have a bad experience,\nwhat's gonna happen?\n\n594\n00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:25.170\nYou're not gonna us that\noperating system anymore.\n\n595\n00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:27.940\nMicrosoft saw that as an issue,\nthey went ahead and remedied that,\n\n596\n00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:29.350\nput Windows Defender in there.\n\n597\n00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:32.820\nAnd again, you can buy better\nthird party software for\n\n598\n00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:35.930\nyour anti-virus protection,\nbut this is already built-in.\n\n599\n00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:39.820\nAll you have to and it's basically running\nfrom the time you start your computer and\n\n600\n00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:40.910\nyou start using it.\n\n601\n00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:45.010\nIt's free, it's there, use it, make\nsure it gets updated and stay protected.\n\n602\n00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:47.170\nIt's great stuff, Don.\n\n603\n00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:49.580\n>> All right, well Daniel,\nI know I rambled on enough for\n\n604\n00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:52.490\nus to have a part two, but I think I've\nreached the end of my rambling here.\n\n605\n00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:54.920\nSo this is probably a pretty good spot for\nus to wrap this one up.\n\n606\n00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:57.070\n>> Awesome, well I hope you\nguys out there enjoyed this.\n\n607\n00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:59.980\nAnd now you know how to stay a little\nmore secure out there in the wilds of\n\n608\n00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:00.550\nthe Internet.\n\n609\n00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:02.971\n[INAUDIBLE], so we're gonna go and\nsign off for ITProTV,\n\n610\n00:27:02.971 --> 00:27:04.680\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n611\n00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:05.341\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n612\n00:27:05.341 --> 00:27:06.879\nAnd we'll see you next time\n\n613\n00:27:06.879 --> 00:27:13.010\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

action\npacked episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.809 --> 00:00:18.028\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:18.028 --> 00:00:21.801\nHere with me today, well, the master\nof disaster himself, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:22.626\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:25.122\n>> It is a great day to be\nright here in the studio.\n\n8\n00:00:25.122 --> 00:00:29.349\nWe're taking a look at our MTA,\nmaking sure that we are ready for\n\n9\n00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.828\nthis exam on configuring Windows devices,\nmobility, whatever.\n\n10\n00:00:33.828 --> 00:00:34.627\nI'll be here,\n\n11\n00:00:34.627 --> 00:00:39.265\nwe're actually glad to be here with you as\nwe take a look at this particular portion.\n\n12\n00:00:39.265 --> 00:00:42.245\nWe are now going in to take a look at,\nwell, trying to explore and\n\n13\n00:00:42.245 --> 00:00:46.062\nexplain what Cloud\nservice are really about.\n\n14\n00:00:46.062 --> 00:00:49.230\nNow, you might be wondering if this\nis your first time taking about it.\n\n15\n00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:49.915\nYou've heard the term.\n\n16\n00:00:49.915 --> 00:00:51.052\nIt's a buzz phrase.\n\n17\n00:00:51.052 --> 00:00:54.452\nIt's been a buzz phrase for\na couple of years in the IT industry.\n\n18\n00:00:54.452 --> 00:00:58.203\nAnd even then, as people talk about it,\nmost of the time we talk, yeah,\n\n19\n00:00:58.203 --> 00:00:59.257\nit's in the Cloud.\n\n20\n00:00:59.257 --> 00:01:00.139\nOf course, it's in the Cloud.\n\n21\n00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:02.291\nThat's all that it is.\n\n22\n00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:06.622\nAnd we freely throw around that term like,\nwe know exactly what it means and\n\n23\n00:01:06.622 --> 00:01:08.420\nlot of times we really don't.\n\n24\n00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.036\nSo today's episode, of course, is to\nhelp us to understand a little bit more\n\n25\n00:01:13.036 --> 00:01:16.800\nabout what Cloud services really are and\nwhat are the available\n\n26\n00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.434\nservices that are out there when you\nare actually having to work in the Cloud.\n\n27\n00:01:21.434 --> 00:01:23.036\nThere's plenty of different\nones that are out there.\n\n28\n00:01:23.036 --> 00:01:27.287\nWe're focusing specifically on some of\nour Microsoft Cloud services that we may\n\n29\n00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:28.410\nalso seek.\n\n30\n00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.122\nSo a great question to begin with is,\nwhat are Cloud services?\n\n31\n00:01:33.122 --> 00:01:36.813\nAnd the funny thing is,\nthe first time I heard about it, Daniel,\n\n32\n00:01:36.813 --> 00:01:41.420\nI kind of just remembered, yeah,\nthat absolutely makes no sense at all.\n\n33\n00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.883\nWhy would something actually be out there\nand something that's out there, and\n\n34\n00:01:44.883 --> 00:01:46.806\nwhy would people keep\nusing the term Cloud?\n\n35\n00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:48.744\nWell, they're saying it's\non the Internet somewhere.\n\n36\n00:01:48.744 --> 00:01:50.648\nAnd that's what we're really\ntalking about, right, Daniel?\n\n37\n00:01:50.648 --> 00:01:54.280\nIs that, we're talking about stuff that's\nactually out there on the Internet, so\n\n38\n00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.140\nwhy does that matter to me that\nit's actually in the Cloud?\n\n39\n00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.270\nThat is what we're really focusing\nin on right here in the beginning.\n\n40\n00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.990\nSo when we talk about Cloud services then,\nwe're really mentioning the very fact that\n\n41\n00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.880\nthere are machines, there are computers,\nthere are a bunch of\n\n42\n00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.500\ndifferent things that are out there that\ndon't have to be on your computer or\n\n43\n00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.170\ninside of your organization, and\nyou and I can still access them.\n\n44\n00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.210\nWe can still use them as like they\nare actually part of my organization.\n\n45\n00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.320\nAnd you might be wondering, why in\nthe world would I do something like that?\n\n46\n00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.403\nDaniel, can you think of a good reason\nwhy we might use a Cloud service over\n\n47\n00:02:28.403 --> 00:02:30.612\nsomething that is just\nresiding on my own computer?\n\n48\n00:02:30.612 --> 00:02:31.309\n>> Oh, surely.\n\n49\n00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:34.305\nOne of the main reasons\nis just costs alone.\n\n50\n00:02:34.305 --> 00:02:37.170\nA lot of times,\nit can be a very much cheaper.\n\n51\n00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.841\nIt saves you a lot more money to use\na Cloud type service than a traditional\n\n52\n00:02:40.841 --> 00:02:43.020\nservice that's inside of your building.\n\n53\n00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.488\nCuz you gotta remember,\nwhen it comes to services,\n\n54\n00:02:45.488 --> 00:02:47.292\nthings that you use as a user, right?\n\n55\n00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:49.277\nYou wanna access your email.\n\n56\n00:02:49.277 --> 00:02:49.867\nThat's a service.\n\n57\n00:02:49.867 --> 00:02:51.424\nYou wanna access files.\n\n58\n00:02:51.424 --> 00:02:53.026\nThat's a service as well.\n\n59\n00:02:53.026 --> 00:02:57.219\nAll sorts of services that we get Internet\naccess, even stuff to that nature,\n\n60\n00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:00.585\nwebsites, all sorts of services\nthat we tend to use and take for\n\n61\n00:03:00.585 --> 00:03:02.000\ngranted on a daily basis.\n\n62\n00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.946\nWell, if I'm running all that stuff\nin house if I have an organization.\n\n63\n00:03:05.946 --> 00:03:08.342\nOr if I'm just downloading\nsome software for\n\n64\n00:03:08.342 --> 00:03:12.959\nmyself to use in my own home environment,\nwell, that's something I had to purchase.\n\n65\n00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.944\nI had to buy that,\nthen I had to install it.\n\n66\n00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:16.245\nNow, I've got to support it.\n\n67\n00:03:16.245 --> 00:03:17.846\nI have to have a machine to run it on.\n\n68\n00:03:17.846 --> 00:03:21.415\nI got to make sure that machine has\nthe correct amount of hardware or\n\n69\n00:03:21.415 --> 00:03:24.360\ntype of hardware that will make sure that,\nthat runs.\n\n70\n00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.381\nIt can get a little expensive.\n\n71\n00:03:25.381 --> 00:03:28.534\nI got to run the electricity for\nthat as well, starts to build up\n\n72\n00:03:28.534 --> 00:03:32.300\nlittle nickels and dimes here and there,\nadd up after a little bit awhile.\n\n73\n00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.086\nSo, Cloud services kind of take\nsome of that away from us.\n\n74\n00:03:35.086 --> 00:03:39.019\nThey say, you know what, instead of you\nhaving to install that on your computer,\n\n75\n00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.009\nwe'll install it onto our computers here\nup, and you'll have access to it through\n\n76\n00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:46.325\nthe Internet, and that's basically\nwhy we call it a Cloud service.\n\n77\n00:03:46.325 --> 00:03:49.543\nBecause if you've ever seen\na diagram of Internet diagram,\n\n78\n00:03:49.543 --> 00:03:53.011\nyou'll notice that the Internet\nis usually a giant puffy cloud,\n\n79\n00:03:53.011 --> 00:03:57.470\nand they put Internet there, and\nit let's you know that's where it is.\n\n80\n00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.756\nThat is what we're talking about\nwith these Cloud services.\n\n81\n00:03:59.756 --> 00:04:02.600\nInstead of having to host it here locally,\nI can go up there, and\n\n82\n00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.045\nthat's gonna save me some money,\nbecause I don't have to buy the hardware.\n\n83\n00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:08.060\nI don't have to run the electricity.\n\n84\n00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.019\nAll I do is pay for\na subscription to the service, and\n\n85\n00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.986\nthen I have access to it through a portal,\nusually through a browser,\n\n86\n00:04:14.986 --> 00:04:18.704\nsome sort of web-based portal so\nthat she can get access to that.\n\n87\n00:04:18.704 --> 00:04:20.328\nIt's very, very convenient.\n\n88\n00:04:20.328 --> 00:04:23.741\nAlso, allows me to go anywhere I want.\n\n89\n00:04:23.741 --> 00:04:24.983\nI can be on any network.\n\n90\n00:04:24.983 --> 00:04:27.050\nI don't have to be on my business network.\n\n91\n00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.383\nI can be at a local coffee shop.\n\n92\n00:04:29.383 --> 00:04:30.882\nI can be at a restaurant.\n\n93\n00:04:30.882 --> 00:04:34.829\nI can be inside of a shopping mall\nas long as I've got Internet access.\n\n94\n00:04:34.829 --> 00:04:37.533\nI can sit down with my laptop,\nand go, hey,\n\n95\n00:04:37.533 --> 00:04:40.181\nI need to make a quick\nchange to something.\n\n96\n00:04:40.181 --> 00:04:44.351\nNot a problem, just log into that\nweb interface, change that document,\n\n97\n00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:48.895\nadd something to something, make\na settings adjustment, and I'm in action.\n\n98\n00:04:48.895 --> 00:04:52.890\nDoesn't have to be, oh, I gotta run to\nthe office and make that change, very,\n\n99\n00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.020\nvery convenient.\n\n100\n00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.524\n>> Yeah, so a great example then,\nis something that Daniel just mentioned.\n\n101\n00:04:57.524 --> 00:04:59.509\nThink about the idea\nof just getting email.\n\n102\n00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.060\nWe don't even have to go beyond that.\n\n103\n00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.309\nAll of us who are watching the show,\nyou probably have an email account.\n\n104\n00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:05.400\nI have an email account.\n\n105\n00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.460\nDaniel has an email account.\n\n106\n00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.592\nBut if we had to set that up,\nin other words, if I said,\n\n107\n00:05:10.592 --> 00:05:14.750\nI want to actually run my own email,\nthat is more challenging than you and\n\n108\n00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.885\nI can actually think about at times.\n\n109\n00:05:16.885 --> 00:05:19.451\nEspecially when we're saying,\nhey, to do that,\n\n110\n00:05:19.451 --> 00:05:22.480\nwhat would I really need\nto actually have in hand?\n\n111\n00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.104\nWell, what might start off\nis that somebody says, well,\n\n112\n00:05:25.104 --> 00:05:26.563\nfirst you need an email server.\n\n113\n00:05:26.563 --> 00:05:29.279\nThen when you start talking about\nthen getting an email server,\n\n114\n00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:30.546\nwhat are they talking about?\n\n115\n00:05:30.546 --> 00:05:34.419\nYou have to buy at least a PC to make\nsure that you have some machine,\n\n116\n00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:39.053\nthat then the email server, the product,\nwhatever it might be, you might hear\n\n117\n00:05:39.053 --> 00:05:43.689\nthe term Microsoft Exchange, then you\nhave to purchase that, and then install\n\n118\n00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:48.284\nthat on there, and then properly get it\nconfigured to work as an email server.\n\n119\n00:05:48.284 --> 00:05:51.302\nAnd from that point on, there's a bunch\nof other things that you need to do.\n\n120\n00:05:51.302 --> 00:05:56.280\nYou need to connect to the Internet,\nthen you need to get some of the different\n\n121\n00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.114\nrecords to actually work\non the internet and\n\n122\n00:05:59.114 --> 00:06:04.570\ngetting all of that stuff established and\nset up and correct on an individual basis.\n\n123\n00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.824\nFor companies, it's a big expense.\n\n124\n00:06:06.824 --> 00:06:09.726\nFor an individual,\nit's beyond a big expense.\n\n125\n00:06:09.726 --> 00:06:12.578\nAnd the problem is for both of them,\neven if you purchase all that and\n\n126\n00:06:12.578 --> 00:06:15.102\nyou get it running,\nyou still have to do maintenance on it.\n\n127\n00:06:15.102 --> 00:06:16.321\nYou still have to upkeep it.\n\n128\n00:06:16.321 --> 00:06:18.445\nYou still have to keep\nall the updates on it.\n\n129\n00:06:18.445 --> 00:06:22.120\nAnd that's just for you,\nas one individual, trying to get an email.\n\n130\n00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.080\nWell, what would be better?\n\n131\n00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.206\nAnd this is what we've decided here.\n\n132\n00:06:25.206 --> 00:06:28.161\nAnd Daniel and I would probably agree,\nis like, hey, what if we could,\n\n133\n00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:30.209\nsomebody says that they're\nexperts at e-mail.\n\n134\n00:06:30.209 --> 00:06:33.669\nThey already have an e-mail server up,\nthey can setup the account for us.\n\n135\n00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:35.608\nThey can make it recognize\non the Internet.\n\n136\n00:06:35.608 --> 00:06:37.070\nThey can do all that.\n\n137\n00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.786\nAnd the only thing that Daniel and I have\nto do is pay $10 a month or $20 a month,\n\n138\n00:06:40.786 --> 00:06:41.807\nwhatever it might be.\n\n139\n00:06:41.807 --> 00:06:44.370\nSometimes, it actually may be for free.\n\n140\n00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:48.615\nAnd if you do have some type of free\naccount, like an Outlook.com or\n\n141\n00:06:48.615 --> 00:06:53.017\na Hotmail account, it's already\nbeing paid for by another company.\n\n142\n00:06:53.017 --> 00:06:55.373\nThey're offering that service to you for\nfree.\n\n143\n00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:58.551\nBut in the background, right, there's\na bunch of computers that are actually in\n\n144\n00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:00.957\nthe background that you and\nI are really not having to pay for.\n\n145\n00:07:00.957 --> 00:07:02.699\nSomebody else is paying for it.\n\n146\n00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:06.130\nBut we're actually able\nto access that resource.\n\n147\n00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.387\nIn other words,\nemail is a resource for me, but\n\n148\n00:07:08.387 --> 00:07:10.538\nit's not residing on\nany machine that I own.\n\n149\n00:07:10.538 --> 00:07:13.593\nThe only thing I'm really getting access\nto is that web portal that Daniel was\n\n150\n00:07:13.593 --> 00:07:14.254\ntalking about.\n\n151\n00:07:14.254 --> 00:07:18.995\nOr if I have a client on my computer,\nlike Microsoft Outlook on my computer is\n\n152\n00:07:18.995 --> 00:07:24.130\nconnecting that, and then downloading\nthat email for me as well.\n\n153\n00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.572\nSo when we start talking about\nCloud services, it really is about\n\n154\n00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:31.152\na resource that doesn't have to\nreside on any equipment that I own.\n\n155\n00:07:31.152 --> 00:07:35.320\nI can simply pay a subscription for it and\nbe able to get access to an outlet.\n\n156\n00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.573\nNow we mention email because that is by\nfar the most popular type of service that\n\n157\n00:07:39.573 --> 00:07:40.287\nis Outlook.\n\n158\n00:07:40.287 --> 00:07:44.357\nJust as popular though are what we\ncall application services, too,\n\n159\n00:07:44.357 --> 00:07:45.488\nlike web servers.\n\n160\n00:07:45.488 --> 00:07:48.859\nWe can again do the same thing\nif I wanted to build a website,\n\n161\n00:07:48.859 --> 00:07:51.431\nhave it all hosted here\nright in my own place.\n\n162\n00:07:51.431 --> 00:07:53.939\nBut then,\nif I have a power outage, Daniel,\n\n163\n00:07:53.939 --> 00:07:56.249\nthen all of a sudden my website goes down.\n\n164\n00:07:56.249 --> 00:07:58.293\nAnd that now becomes a little\nbit more challenging.\n\n165\n00:07:58.293 --> 00:08:01.279\nYou were trying to gain access to\nmy website, but power's down, and\n\n166\n00:08:01.279 --> 00:08:03.709\nI just have to wait for\nthe power company to come back up.\n\n167\n00:08:03.709 --> 00:08:06.335\nThese services, though,\nare actually designed so\n\n168\n00:08:06.335 --> 00:08:09.796\nthat they do have built-in stuff\nwhere they're all over the place so\n\n169\n00:08:09.796 --> 00:08:12.135\nthat we can access to\nthem whenever we want to.\n\n170\n00:08:12.135 --> 00:08:13.601\nSo we'll talk about\nthat a little bit more.\n\n171\n00:08:13.601 --> 00:08:16.234\nThere are plenty of services out there and\navailable for us, and\n\n172\n00:08:16.234 --> 00:08:18.140\nthat's also what we wanna focus in on.\n\n173\n00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.385\nSo, even though we just really\nbriefly mentioned the couple of them,\n\n174\n00:08:21.385 --> 00:08:23.206\nthere are even more that are out there.\n\n175\n00:08:23.206 --> 00:08:25.133\nAnd that's what we also\nwant to talk about as well.\n\n176\n00:08:25.133 --> 00:08:30.460\nSo sometimes, we have services like\nwhat we call productivity services, too.\n\n177\n00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:34.101\nSo, for example,\nif you've heard about Office 365,\n\n178\n00:08:34.101 --> 00:08:36.489\nthat's actually an Office product.\n\n179\n00:08:36.489 --> 00:08:41.484\nNow, if you've worked in the Windows\nworld, if you've been in a business and\n\n180\n00:08:41.484 --> 00:08:46.401\nsomebody said, oh, yeah, all I have to\ndo is open up Word to type in a document\n\n181\n00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:50.446\nsomewhere, or you used Excel or\nyou used Outlook, all these.\n\n182\n00:08:50.446 --> 00:08:52.980\nThat's part of what we\ncall the Office Suite.\n\n183\n00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.793\nThese are programs that\nnormally on the computers.\n\n184\n00:08:55.793 --> 00:08:59.646\nWe install them directly on\nthe computers themselves, and\n\n185\n00:08:59.646 --> 00:09:04.740\nthen from that point on, we can use that\nprogram and we are ready to go, right?\n\n186\n00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:08.350\nWell, that is when you actually\nhave something locally installed.\n\n187\n00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:13.410\nWith Office 365, you have the advantage\nof still having something like that, but\n\n188\n00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:17.760\nyou also have the advantage of using\nthose same programs without ever\n\n189\n00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.310\nhaving to install them onto your computer.\n\n190\n00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:21.986\nYou again would purchase a subscription.\n\n191\n00:09:21.986 --> 00:09:24.210\nAnd once you do that,\nthey'll give you a log in.\n\n192\n00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:28.090\nAnd from that point, you can access\nsomething like that as well.\n\n193\n00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:30.770\nSo let's show you\nan example of Office 365.\n\n194\n00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:36.610\nSo on my computer, I went ahead and\nI logged into my Office 365 account here.\n\n195\n00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:41.570\nAnd you can see that it depends on your\nsubscription of what you have access to.\n\n196\n00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:42.689\nI have mail.\n\n197\n00:09:42.689 --> 00:09:44.330\nI have a calendar system.\n\n198\n00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.080\nI can connect with other\npeople on newsfeed.\n\n199\n00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.480\nBut these are the ones we're normally,\nor at least when I think about office,\n\n200\n00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:54.120\nI'm talking about productivity things,\na word processing program.\n\n201\n00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:58.072\nSo if I select like Word Online,\nI can simply click on that, and\n\n202\n00:09:58.072 --> 00:10:03.534\nthen it does actually work like word does,\nand I'll just select a new blank document.\n\n203\n00:10:03.534 --> 00:10:06.452\nAnd from this point,\nonce everything loads up,\n\n204\n00:10:06.452 --> 00:10:10.661\nit will look like the Office product\nthat's actually on my computer.\n\n205\n00:10:10.661 --> 00:10:13.302\nAnd you can see it here,\nit's a little bit small, but\n\n206\n00:10:13.302 --> 00:10:16.324\nyou can see all the same features\nthat we would normally see.\n\n207\n00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:20.280\nAnd so, the same thing would happen if\nI were to open up Excel or Powerpoint.\n\n208\n00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.970\nThe advantage of doing\nsomething like this is that it\n\n209\n00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.210\nautomatically keeps track of it for me.\n\n210\n00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:29.890\nSo even if I'm working on this document\nand I save it, and now all of a sudden,\n\n211\n00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:33.340\nDaniel says, Ronnie, you're going on\nthe road, and you need to leave in a hour,\n\n212\n00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:37.120\neven if all my documents are actually\nstored where they're normally stored\n\n213\n00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:41.400\ninside a Cloud storage location,\nwhich we're about to talk about as well.\n\n214\n00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:45.193\nIf they're stored up there, that means\nthat I can go to anywhere else on this\n\n215\n00:10:45.193 --> 00:10:48.534\nplanet, log into the same website,\nand I have access to it there.\n\n216\n00:10:48.534 --> 00:10:49.774\nDaniel, how convenient is that?\n\n217\n00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:51.409\n>> Oh, it's super convenient.\n\n218\n00:10:51.409 --> 00:10:55.988\nAnd this is a prime example of how one\ntypical type of traditional application or\n\n219\n00:10:55.988 --> 00:10:59.834\nservice that you might have has\nbeen moved into the Cloud, right?\n\n220\n00:10:59.834 --> 00:11:02.179\nWe all have worked with Office for\na long time.\n\n221\n00:11:02.179 --> 00:11:04.394\nOffice has been around for\nquite some time, actually.\n\n222\n00:11:04.394 --> 00:11:05.286\n>> Right.\n\n223\n00:11:05.286 --> 00:11:08.762\n>> And, it's a software program you\nhave installed on your computer.\n\n224\n00:11:08.762 --> 00:11:11.847\nYou launch the EXE, and\nyou can start manipulating files, or\n\n225\n00:11:11.847 --> 00:11:15.180\ndoing whatever it is each one of\nthose different applications do.\n\n226\n00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:18.620\nYou get your Word, your Excel,\nor all those different things.\n\n227\n00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.254\nNow, it's based in the Cloud.\n\n228\n00:11:20.254 --> 00:11:24.640\nIt's up there as a web\ntype of application.\n\n229\n00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.247\nI don't have to install\nanything on the computer.\n\n230\n00:11:27.247 --> 00:11:31.140\nNot that you can't, that still is\navailable for you, but I don't have to.\n\n231\n00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:35.565\nAll I have to do it go to the Office\n365 website, sign in using my Microsoft\n\n232\n00:11:35.565 --> 00:11:39.457\naccount, and then it shows me\nthe available applications for me.\n\n233\n00:11:39.457 --> 00:11:42.130\nI can be at any computer\nanywhere in the world.\n\n234\n00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:46.194\nAs long as I have access to the Internet,\nI will be able to access those resources.\n\n235\n00:11:46.194 --> 00:11:50.946\nThat is probably one of the biggest main\nbenefits of having these types of Cloud\n\n236\n00:11:50.946 --> 00:11:53.467\nservices, very, very, very helpful.\n\n237\n00:11:53.467 --> 00:11:57.561\n>> Yeah, the other one that we were\njust mentioning also was, of course,\n\n238\n00:11:57.561 --> 00:11:59.144\nthe idea of cloud storage.\n\n239\n00:11:59.144 --> 00:12:04.074\nNow, Daniel, when I started, right,\nin really getting access and\n\n240\n00:12:04.074 --> 00:12:06.964\nin trying to become an IT professional,\n\n241\n00:12:06.964 --> 00:12:12.414\nit was really the beginning of the day and\nage of 256 megabyte USB drives.\n\n242\n00:12:12.414 --> 00:12:15.139\nAnd so,\nthat was kind of the big thing, right?\n\n243\n00:12:15.139 --> 00:12:21.130\nBecause we were storing before,\nlike, 10, 15, 20 megabytes at a time.\n\n244\n00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.717\nAnd carrying files around\nwere really on disks, or\n\n245\n00:12:23.717 --> 00:12:26.800\nthey were on floppy disks a lot\nof times when we were doing it.\n\n246\n00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.535\nSo having a 256 megabyte thumb drive,\n\n247\n00:12:29.535 --> 00:12:33.673\nwhere I can insert that into\na computer and load up 256 megs,\n\n248\n00:12:33.673 --> 00:12:39.410\nthat was cool until the point when I leave\nthat device in the computer somewhere.\n\n249\n00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.737\nAnd all of a sudden the files are,\noh yeah, that's.\n\n250\n00:12:41.737 --> 00:12:43.808\nOh, it's no longer with me,\nI don't know why.\n\n251\n00:12:43.808 --> 00:12:45.567\nI don't even know where I left it.\n\n252\n00:12:45.567 --> 00:12:48.922\nAnd then, of course,\nit started getting bigger and bigger, and\n\n253\n00:12:48.922 --> 00:12:50.822\nthen 10 gigs and then 100 gigs.\n\n254\n00:12:50.822 --> 00:12:51.933\nAnd today, yes,\n\n255\n00:12:51.933 --> 00:12:57.500\nyou get like 100 gigs easily on these\nportable drives that you carry around.\n\n256\n00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:01.180\nProblem is again, you can leave those in\nlocations and what ends up happening then,\n\n257\n00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.990\nif you have it in one location,\n\n258\n00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:05.610\nyou can't have it in another\nlocation if you forget it.\n\n259\n00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:08.233\nBut there are what we call\nCloud storage out there.\n\n260\n00:13:08.233 --> 00:13:12.681\nAnd that actually allows you\nto save up to somebody else's\n\n261\n00:13:12.681 --> 00:13:15.420\nstorage device such as Microsoft.\n\n262\n00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:19.310\nThey actually have a product that\nthey call, of course, OneDrive.\n\n263\n00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:21.805\nAnd I actually was about to forget I\nwas about to call it Outlook Drive.\n\n264\n00:13:21.805 --> 00:13:24.547\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it's actually called OneDrive here.\n\n265\n00:13:24.547 --> 00:13:27.582\nOneDrive has been around for a long time.\n\n266\n00:13:27.582 --> 00:13:30.130\nIt's gone through a few\ndifference name changes.\n\n267\n00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:33.527\nBut it normally gives you access\nto a certain amount of data, or\n\n268\n00:13:33.527 --> 00:13:36.231\na certain amount of storage space,\nI should say.\n\n269\n00:13:36.231 --> 00:13:38.988\nSo when you use that,\nyou can actually just connect in and\n\n270\n00:13:38.988 --> 00:13:40.547\nyou need to save files up there.\n\n271\n00:13:40.547 --> 00:13:42.920\nIt's fairly easy to do so.\n\n272\n00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.284\nAnd that way,\nregardless of where you are in the world,\n\n273\n00:13:45.284 --> 00:13:48.776\nif you need access to particular files,\nyou can actually do something like that.\n\n274\n00:13:48.776 --> 00:13:52.270\nSo let me kind of give an example\nof what I'm talking about.\n\n275\n00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:56.640\nSo a lot of times, I work on things\nlike firewalls and hardware switches.\n\n276\n00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.380\nAnd they actually have\nconfiguration files.\n\n277\n00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:03.918\nAnd if I end up getting a new, or\nlet say, a used switch of some sort and\n\n278\n00:14:03.918 --> 00:14:08.848\nI don't know what's on that file,\nwhat normally I have to do is go ahead and\n\n279\n00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:11.933\nwipe that thing clean and\nthen start all over.\n\n280\n00:14:11.933 --> 00:14:17.774\nBut I do have those configurations of\nthe stuff you wipe everything clean and\n\n281\n00:14:17.774 --> 00:14:21.800\nput the configuration I want\non a device at anytime.\n\n282\n00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.967\nWell, I can save that onto that USB drive,\nor\n\n283\n00:14:23.967 --> 00:14:26.950\nI can save it up to a thumb drive\nsomewhere and get access to it.\n\n284\n00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:28.641\nLet me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n285\n00:14:28.641 --> 00:14:31.107\nSo here, even through the Office 365,\n\n286\n00:14:31.107 --> 00:14:34.957\nyou can see that there's an icon\nup here that's called OneDrive.\n\n287\n00:14:34.957 --> 00:14:38.906\nAnd so if I select that icon, there's\na bunch of different folders that I\n\n288\n00:14:38.906 --> 00:14:41.192\nhave available, so I have a lot of notes.\n\n289\n00:14:41.192 --> 00:14:44.090\nI have a lot of different things\nthat are actually saved for me.\n\n290\n00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:47.020\nAnd I've just saved them up to\nthat one drive account, and\n\n291\n00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:50.170\nwhat that allows me to do is\nto actually use that storage.\n\n292\n00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:53.386\nNow, a lot of times for free if you\nset up a free Microsoft account,\n\n293\n00:14:53.386 --> 00:14:56.847\nthey'll give you access to so\nmuch storage on, I don't remember how-\n\n294\n00:14:56.847 --> 00:14:57.776\n>> I think it's 15 gigs right now.\n\n295\n00:14:57.776 --> 00:14:59.320\n>> 15 gigs or so.\n\n296\n00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.160\n>> So, I mean that's a pretty good amount\nof space that you can actually save\n\n297\n00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.470\ninformation up there.\n\n298\n00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:08.400\nSo right here, you can barely see it,\nbut it says ASDM 70 config.\n\n299\n00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.640\nAnd that is one of those base\nconfigurations that I need.\n\n300\n00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:15.732\nAnd so, if somebody is asking me to help\nset up a firewall, if they say, look,\n\n301\n00:15:15.732 --> 00:15:19.526\nI bought this thing off of eBay, and\nI need to go ahead and start all over.\n\n302\n00:15:19.526 --> 00:15:21.458\nWell, I can take that config file, and\n\n303\n00:15:21.458 --> 00:15:23.814\nall I have to do is simply\nbe able to download it.\n\n304\n00:15:23.814 --> 00:15:27.969\nAnd I simply click on it, and\nthat begins the downloading process for\n\n305\n00:15:27.969 --> 00:15:29.410\nme to be able to do that.\n\n306\n00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:31.952\nSo, once I actually select something\nlike that and I change it,\n\n307\n00:15:31.952 --> 00:15:34.034\nI'm not gonna download it\nbecause I don't need to.\n\n308\n00:15:34.034 --> 00:15:38.673\nBut once I select something like that,\nit really does allow me to change it, and\n\n309\n00:15:38.673 --> 00:15:42.217\nthen I can put that onto\nthe configuration and be ready to go.\n\n310\n00:15:42.217 --> 00:15:44.787\nSo I don't have to carry\naround a USB drive.\n\n311\n00:15:44.787 --> 00:15:46.240\nI don't have to carry around anything.\n\n312\n00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.399\nI just need access to the Internet.\n\n313\n00:15:47.399 --> 00:15:50.798\nAs long as I have access to the Internet,\nI have those files available for me.\n\n314\n00:15:50.798 --> 00:15:54.370\nThe other thing that it also helps\nyou to do as well is sometimes,\n\n315\n00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:58.752\nespecially when you are working on Office\nproducts that are on your computer.\n\n316\n00:15:58.752 --> 00:16:01.693\nToday, with the newer editions,\nby default,\n\n317\n00:16:01.693 --> 00:16:05.294\nif you go ahead and\nset up your own account with Microsoft,\n\n318\n00:16:05.294 --> 00:16:10.458\nit automatically defaults to saving all\nyour stuff up in that Cloud storage, too.\n\n319\n00:16:10.458 --> 00:16:13.007\nAnd you might be going,\nI'd rather save it on my hard drive, but\n\n320\n00:16:13.007 --> 00:16:14.293\nthat's the worst place for it.\n\n321\n00:16:14.293 --> 00:16:18.121\nThese drives that are in these computers,\nthey're not really designed to last for\n\n322\n00:16:18.121 --> 00:16:19.540\na good long time.\n\n323\n00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.050\nWhereas, on the cloud storage there, man,\n\n324\n00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:24.730\nthey have backups upon\nbackups upon backups.\n\n325\n00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.990\nOne server goes down,\nanother server's gonna pick back up and\n\n326\n00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:28.360\nyou're gonna be ready to go.\n\n327\n00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:32.210\nSo cloud storage is actually a big one\nthat a lot of companies do depend on.\n\n328\n00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:34.430\nAnd even we depend on it here at ITProTV.\n\n329\n00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:38.050\n>> Yeah, you'll even start seeing\na trend anymore, with, well,\n\n330\n00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:39.250\nI guess they're not laptops.\n\n331\n00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:40.630\nThey look like laptops.\n\n332\n00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:43.780\nThey're basically a type of netbook,\nalmost,\n\n333\n00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.970\nwhere all you're doing is\naccessing cloud services.\n\n334\n00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:47.750\nThere's very small hard drives on them.\n\n335\n00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:48.980\nBecause what's the point?\n\n336\n00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:50.520\nPut everything in the cloud.\n\n337\n00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.640\nIt's a whole lot safer there.\n\n338\n00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.430\nLike Ronnie said, hard drives, they die.\n\n339\n00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:54.420\nThey go bad.\n\n340\n00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:55.510\nLaptops?\nThey get stolen.\n\n341\n00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:56.570\nThey get lost.\n\n342\n00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:59.040\nThey just wear out and break down and\nyou gotta buy another one.\n\n343\n00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.840\nAnd then you've gotta transfer all the\nfiles from your old one into the new one.\n\n344\n00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.530\nIt's a long, arduous process.\n\n345\n00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:05.150\nIt's not a lot of fun.\n\n346\n00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:08.950\nIf you've got everything stored in\nthe cloud, well, hey, that's great, right?\n\n347\n00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:10.990\nI buy a new laptop, no big deal.\n\n348\n00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:15.210\nI log into Office 365, and I'm right\nback to where I was with my old laptop.\n\n349\n00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:17.340\nI can decommission that thing very easily.\n\n350\n00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:20.470\nNow all I have to do is transfer\nthe files that I've actually saved on it\n\n351\n00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:21.450\ninto the new one.\n\n352\n00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:24.610\nHopefully, I've been using my One Drive,\nI've got plenty of space there.\n\n353\n00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:25.930\nBut maybe even our paying for\n\n354\n00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:29.680\nthat service I got plenty of space,\nthey give you tons of space at that point.\n\n355\n00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.170\nI think it's a terabyte for\none of their lower tier pay versions.\n\n356\n00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:37.510\nIt's very cheap, so\nit's definitely worth the investment.\n\n357\n00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:38.410\nEverything is there.\n\n358\n00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:41.420\nI don't have to worry about that\nlaptop being lost or stolen,\n\n359\n00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:46.310\nother than the monetary decrease that\nI've incurred from it being gone.\n\n360\n00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:47.750\nI love cloud services.\n\n361\n00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:50.230\nI have become a cloud services acolyte.\n\n362\n00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:52.078\nI wanna move everything to the cloud.\n\n363\n00:17:52.078 --> 00:17:55.720\n>> And when you started using it,\nat the very beginning, cuz you're saying,\n\n364\n00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.270\nwell I just don't know\nhow we gain access to it.\n\n365\n00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:01.750\nOne of the biggest advantages that you\nfind out is once you start storing things\n\n366\n00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:04.890\nup there, it makes it very easy for\nwhat we call collaboration and\n\n367\n00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:06.610\ncommunication as well.\n\n368\n00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:09.610\nWhen you use a common program, like\n\n369\n00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:13.640\nthe Word product that we were just showing\nyou, what I can also do at the same\n\n370\n00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:17.840\ntime is actually be able to offer direct\ncollaboration communication as well.\n\n371\n00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.230\nAnd that means that Daniel can\nopen up the same document and\n\n372\n00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:22.090\nI can open up the same document.\n\n373\n00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:25.410\nAnd if Daniel is typing, I can actually\nsee that action, and then if I go ahead\n\n374\n00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:28.870\nand start marking something else out,\nDaniel can see that as well.\n\n375\n00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:32.690\nNow that does involve that we\nare using the same program, but\n\n376\n00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:35.390\noverall that happen and\nwe don't have to download that and\n\n377\n00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:37.890\nthen have to make changes,\nand upload it back in.\n\n378\n00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:42.200\nBut if we don't a program that's in common\nwith my Office 365 then you do, but\n\n379\n00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.750\nit really does offer that\ncollaboration to be able to do that.\n\n380\n00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:51.310\nAlong with some product like that though,\nthere's also of course communications or\n\n381\n00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:54.730\ncloud communication that's\nalso available to us, too.\n\n382\n00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:58.650\nNow if you use something like Skype,\nthat's what we're really talking about,\n\n383\n00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:02.090\nand Microsoft has bought Skype and\nthey have a product specifically for\n\n384\n00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:03.740\nbusiness called Skype for Business.\n\n385\n00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:08.650\nAnd that allows then people in multiple\noffices to be able to link up together and\n\n386\n00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:12.240\nbe able to make that connection and\nuse that as a communication.\n\n387\n00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.680\nThe advantage of that is that\nthe underlying infrastructure,\n\n388\n00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.650\nin other words there's all those\ncomputers that are hosting that service,\n\n389\n00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:20.520\nit's not being hosted by me.\n\n390\n00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:23.690\nI again don't have to make backups,\nI don't have to actually worry about,\n\n391\n00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:27.170\noo is that an old machine or not,\nor if you have the right software,\n\n392\n00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:30.900\nbecause all the software comes\nfrom that particular company.\n\n393\n00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:33.410\nAnd they're the ones that\nare gonna be hosting it for us.\n\n394\n00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:36.640\nAnd we're simply accessing\nthe software to make that happen.\n\n395\n00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.270\nSo you have stuff like that.\n\n396\n00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:40.630\nAnd then of course we're gonna\ntalk about things like email.\n\n397\n00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:43.720\nEmail is a communication type\nof service that we also use.\n\n398\n00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.940\nAnd there are so\nmany other ones that are also out there.\n\n399\n00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.000\nBut just kinda realize that all\nthese things that we've been\n\n400\n00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:49.790\ntalking about so far.\n\n401\n00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:50.330\nRight?\n\n402\n00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:53.800\nWhether we're talking about\nthe productivity services, or\n\n403\n00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:57.820\nthe storage services, or the communication\nservices, they are all out there and\n\n404\n00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:00.280\navailable for you and your company.\n\n405\n00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:05.320\nAnd a lot of times, a lot of companies are\nnow moving to this, because the cost is\n\n406\n00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:10.300\njust about the same, and they may actually\nover the long run, be more cost effective.\n\n407\n00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:14.260\nBecause now, Daniel and his company,\nhe's not having to maintain.\n\n408\n00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:18.180\nLike okay,\nI have 500 licences of Offie 2013,\n\n409\n00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:22.310\nand all of a sudden he's like,\nwhat do you mean I'm out of licences?\n\n410\n00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:23.550\nCuz I had 500 of them, and\n\n411\n00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:27.090\nthat's because people tend to actually\nkind of distribute those copies.\n\n412\n00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:31.990\nWell, now he can say all right, Ronnie\nhere's your access to Office 365, and\n\n413\n00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:35.390\nthat limits me to what\nI'm given right there.\n\n414\n00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:40.250\nAnd at any time, if Daniel happens\nto fire me, he can just say I'm just\n\n415\n00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:44.950\ngoing to close out of Ronnie's account,\nand that kind of eliminates that access\n\n416\n00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:49.380\nright there, to where he's no longer\ngonna access the email or anything else.\n\n417\n00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.740\nYou might still have the computer,\nwhich is still bad, but\n\n418\n00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:55.160\nat the same time though he won't have\naccess to all the company information,\n\n419\n00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.630\nif everything's been stored\nthe way that needs to.\n\n420\n00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:00.298\nNow, another service that\nwe have here that we want\n\n421\n00:21:00.298 --> 00:21:03.790\nto describe is what we call of\ncourse cloud search services, too.\n\n422\n00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:07.464\nNow, Microsoft has a product\nthat is called Azure Search.\n\n423\n00:21:07.464 --> 00:21:11.400\nAnd the Azure Search type of product, you\nmight be wondering, what is that about?\n\n424\n00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.980\nWell if you've used any search engine,\nokay, out there,\n\n425\n00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:18.230\nyou've used search before and you might go\nall right, so why the heck would I need\n\n426\n00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:22.840\na cloud search when I could use\nsomething like Google, and or Bing,\n\n427\n00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:27.230\nI think Bing is the official\nMicrosoft one that we can talk about.\n\n428\n00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:29.800\nSo, kind of used that generically today\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n429\n00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.190\n>> No matter what we do.\n\n430\n00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:33.250\nSo when you do a search like that,\nyou're right.\n\n431\n00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:36.220\nThat searches the entire Internet, but\n\n432\n00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:40.100\nit doesn't tend to search\nmy company's computers.\n\n433\n00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:44.190\nWe can actually go ahead and\nuse that cloud services instead, and\n\n434\n00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:47.310\nuse that Azure Search to go ahead and\nsay hey,\n\n435\n00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:52.830\ninside of a cloud service called Azure, we\ncan say here's what I want you to search.\n\n436\n00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:56.070\nNot the entire internet,\nbut here's my computers.\n\n437\n00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:58.980\nAnd I want to be able to find files\nthat are actually located inside\n\n438\n00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:00.820\nof my computers instead.\n\n439\n00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:04.350\nWell if you were to try and\ndo that on your own, don't get me wrong,\n\n440\n00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:08.060\nWindows has a feature to search, and\nit can search an entire network but\n\n441\n00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:10.205\nit's not the most efficient\nsearch in the world.\n\n442\n00:22:10.205 --> 00:22:14.585\nThese things are done on massive computers\nthat helps to bring that search time down.\n\n443\n00:22:14.585 --> 00:22:17.845\nSo have you ever noticed that when you\ndo your favorite search engine and\n\n444\n00:22:17.845 --> 00:22:22.420\nit tells you, returned six\nbillion results in .034 seconds.\n\n445\n00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:24.115\nWow, that's really impressive.\n\n446\n00:22:24.115 --> 00:22:26.910\nIf you were to try and do that\nthrough your Windows little search,\n\n447\n00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:31.960\nit might return two,\nthree in six seconds or so.\n\n448\n00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.320\nSo you can see why you would\nwanna use something like this.\n\n449\n00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.940\nSo it really does help to\noptimize the amount of\n\n450\n00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:42.430\nmoney that you're spending a lot of\ntimes when you access cloud services.\n\n451\n00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:46.220\nIt really does help to control\nwho accesses it as well.\n\n452\n00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:50.400\nAnd of course, it really does save you\nmoney in the long run, because now you're\n\n453\n00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:54.170\nno longer having to actually maintain\na bunch of equipment that you,\n\n454\n00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:58.730\nhate to say it, in 18 months to 2 years,\nDaniel, the chances that that equipment's\n\n455\n00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:03.590\ngonna be the latest and greatest equipment\nas your company continues to grow,\n\n456\n00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:06.590\nyou're gonna say, yeah that piece of\nequipment that I bought five years ago,\n\n457\n00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:09.450\nthat's still running like a champ and\nit's still serving.\n\n458\n00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:10.320\nNo, it's not really.\n\n459\n00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.480\nA lot of times there's actually right on\nthe edge of actually doing what we need to\n\n460\n00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.578\ndo, but then,\nnow you have to expend more money.\n\n461\n00:23:16.578 --> 00:23:19.910\nThese guys that are running these\ncloud services, they are constantly\n\n462\n00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:24.090\nupdating the equipment, because they\nknow that that's where the future is.\n\n463\n00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:26.110\nThat they're going to be providing for\ncompanies,\n\n464\n00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:28.470\nlike ITProTV and well,\nyour company in the future as well.\n\n465\n00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:32.130\n>> Yeah, it's a much better model for\nyou to go to,\n\n466\n00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:33.760\nthat's the good word I'm looking for.\n\n467\n00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.630\nA lot of times, unless you're\njust this huge company that needs\n\n468\n00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:40.070\ninfrastructure inside of your building for\n\n469\n00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:43.960\ncertain services, a lot of the stuff\nyou can source out to the cloud.\n\n470\n00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:47.360\nAs home users, as small business\nusers that you might be supporting\n\n471\n00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:51.795\nas you get into IT, going to the cloud\nis just a really good idea, right?\n\n472\n00:23:51.795 --> 00:23:54.480\nIt just allows you the flexibility and\n\n473\n00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:59.340\nthe freedom to move and move,\nI guess that's the word I'm looking for,\n\n474\n00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:02.010\nto move around and\nhave that mobility that we're looking for.\n\n475\n00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:04.714\nAnd since I come talking about\nmobility at this point in time,\n\n476\n00:24:04.714 --> 00:24:07.520\nit really make sense to\nunderstand what these do.\n\n477\n00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.083\nSo, hopefully, so far,\nyou guys are hanging in there with us.\n\n478\n00:24:10.083 --> 00:24:13.840\nYou're understanding, okay,\nthe cloud is no longer\n\n479\n00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:18.332\nthis mystical idea of IT skullduggery\nof crazy people in hoods and\n\n480\n00:24:18.332 --> 00:24:23.250\nstuff like that over a Swami ball\ntrying to figure out what's going on.\n\n481\n00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:27.420\nNo, you get an idea, oh,\nI now know this is a cloud service.\n\n482\n00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:31.720\nOffice 365, it's a cloud service,\nI don't put it on my computer.\n\n483\n00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.540\nThere's a lot of many benefits to that.\n\n484\n00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:37.640\nAnd obviously we've talked about tons\nof them, especially that maintenance.\n\n485\n00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:40.950\nI don't have to run around with a disc,\nan installation disc, and say oh,\n\n486\n00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:41.990\nwe've gotta upgrade.\n\n487\n00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:45.230\nWe've gotta put this new version on\nyour computer and I've got the disc.\n\n488\n00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:46.500\nLet's go ahead and do that.\n\n489\n00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:50.200\nI don't have a team of people\ncreating new images for\n\n490\n00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.450\nthe new computers that we buy\nto roll out to our company.\n\n491\n00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:55.120\nNo.\nThey don't have to put that on there.\n\n492\n00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.020\nLet's work for them.\n\n493\n00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:57.540\nThat's what we're talking about.\n\n494\n00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:58.440\nAutomate and\n\n495\n00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:03.240\nmake things a more accessible without\nhaving us have to do the work for it.\n\n496\n00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:03.800\nRight Ronnie?\n\n497\n00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:07.660\n>> No doubt that with this ability\nto be able to access Cloud and for\n\n498\n00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.870\nus to understand it a little bit more.\n\n499\n00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:14.280\nIt really does brighten our day,\nha ha, on cloud services here.\n\n500\n00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:18.310\nThat it actually exposes a little bit\nmore sunlight into the realm of realizing\n\n501\n00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:22.915\nthat you don't have to host\neverything where you are, right?\n\n502\n00:25:22.915 --> 00:25:26.135\nTo make sure you have the services\nthat you need that are available.\n\n503\n00:25:26.135 --> 00:25:30.821\nA lot of times by going and using\ndifferent cloud services it really does\n\n504\n00:25:30.821 --> 00:25:35.472\noff-load the infrastructure of\nresponsibility and that means\n\n505\n00:25:35.472 --> 00:25:40.612\nall the machines you have to keep up to\ndate and make sure everything's going on.\n\n506\n00:25:40.612 --> 00:25:44.512\nThe only way the trade off here\nright is it does cost money, right.\n\n507\n00:25:44.512 --> 00:25:49.022\nYou end up paying a subscription for\nthe use of that equipment so but\n\n508\n00:25:49.022 --> 00:25:53.752\nyou're no longer responsible for the\nupkeep of that and that is a big benefit\n\n509\n00:25:53.752 --> 00:25:57.750\nwhen you're in a company that you know\nis you could take the time to do it.\n\n510\n00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:59.900\nBut you really can't slow\ndown to actually do it.\n\n511\n00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:03.490\nBeing able to say hey, here's a bunch\nof experts that know how to do it.\n\n512\n00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:07.330\nLet's just go ahead and\ncontinue to do what we're good at doing.\n\n513\n00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:10.160\nAnd then allow those guys to\ntake care of the background and\n\n514\n00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.440\nto do all that stuff that\nthey're good at doing.\n\n515\n00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:17.260\nAnd that way you actually do have\nthat nice kind of relationship.\n\n516\n00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:21.390\nWhere you still have access to\neverything you need and at the same time\n\n517\n00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:24.800\nthey are also being able to survive\nbecause they are actually hosting it for\n\n518\n00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.650\nus and\ndoing everything that we need as well.\n\n519\n00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:30.370\nNow just when we say that,\nthere's actually more to that.\n\n520\n00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:34.600\nWe just kind of did an overview of\nwhat the cloud services are but\n\n521\n00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:39.000\nwe still need to get a little more\nspecific and talk about some very specific\n\n522\n00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.960\nones that you're more likely to see as\nyou actually get into the IT industry.\n\n523\n00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.650\nBut Daniel, it looks like I've\ntalked way too much again.\n\n524\n00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:50.195\nAnd that means there's probably\ngonna end up being a part two.\n\n525\n00:26:50.195 --> 00:26:51.740\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh, probably is not the word.\n\n526\n00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:53.610\nMost definitely there will be a part two.\n\n527\n00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:54.750\nWe're gonna do that.\n\n528\n00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:56.380\nHopefully we'll see you on that one.\n\n529\n00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:59.630\nHopefully you are now more\nunderstanding these cloud services.\n\n530\n00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:03.220\nAnd we're gonna get into a little more of\nthe management side of cloud services,\n\n531\n00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:05.700\nwhat you can do in the cloud\nas far as managing computers.\n\n532\n00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.120\nThat's going to be really interesting.\n\n533\n00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.110\nThat's going to be in our part two.\n\n534\n00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:09.040\nHopefully we'll see you there.\n\n535\n00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.440\nWe're going to go ahead and\nwrap this show up.\n\n536\n00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:15.020\nAnd signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n537\n00:27:15.020 -->

Here they show you Intune's capabilities for deploying software, modifying location settings, and even selectively removing apps, software, or the Intune client itself. They also describe Microsoft Azure, which is an enterprise cloud solution. Here they show you how to use Azure to deploy virtual servers and workstations as an extension to your physical environment. They explain how Azure is a great solution for disaster recovery, redundancy, and fault tolerance.",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.600\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.640\nHere with me, none other than Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.430\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.550\n>> It is going great.\n\n7\n00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.230\nWe're taking a look today at our MTA,\nmaking sure that we can actually work\n\n8\n00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.660\nwith mobility and, of course,\nWindows devices as well.\n\n9\n00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.510\nAnd this is Part 2, so in other words,\nwe either talked too long, or\n\n10\n00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.890\nelse you had a lot of good information.\n\n11\n00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.600\nI'm gonna say we had a lot of good\ninformation on cloud services.\n\n12\n00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.930\nAnd what we did last time\nis that we introduced you\n\n13\n00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.330\nto a general concepts of cloud services.\n\n14\n00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.060\nAnd some of the different cloud\nservices that you can expect to find,\n\n15\n00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.370\nespecially when you start\nworking in the IT industry.\n\n16\n00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.110\nSo, go back and take a look at that\nshow if you happened to skip over.\n\n17\n00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.860\nHey, what is this really about?\n\n18\n00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.180\nWell that's what this show is about and\n\n19\n00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.170\nnow we're taking a look\nat some of the specifics,\n\n20\n00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.600\nespecially when it comes down to\nthe management of cloud services too.\n\n21\n00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.650\nNow, when we talked about it last time,\n\n22\n00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.040\nit really was more of, here's all\nthe services that are available, and\n\n23\n00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.900\nwe simply sign up, we pay a subscription\nfor it and its hands off.\n\n24\n00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.690\nYou know we really don't\nhave to worry about it.\n\n25\n00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.590\nWe just use the service and\nwe're happy and we're fine with it.\n\n26\n00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.110\nBut as you start to work as a company\nwith those types of services,\n\n27\n00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.390\nthere's some of that where you\ncan just leave hands off, such as\n\n28\n00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.020\nthe management of all the hardware and all\nthat stuff and you can just leave that.\n\n29\n00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.510\nBut there are other things, though,\nthat you, inside your company,\n\n30\n00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.670\nyou definitely need to manage because,\nwell, it's your company.\n\n31\n00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.940\nYou don't want somebody,\nwhatever cloud service you choose, right.\n\n32\n00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.900\nYou don't want somebody,\nyou've never met them,\n\n33\n00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.850\nyou don't know a single name out there,\nto say, hey, Daniel,\n\n34\n00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.410\nI know that you have 500 employees, but\nI'm gonna manage them for you, how's that?\n\n35\n00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.685\n>> That sounds, not good.\n\n36\n00:01:51.685 --> 00:01:54.020\n[LAUGH] That's not really\nthe way you want to go.\n\n37\n00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.540\nYou want to be able to manage\nthe things that you need to set, right?\n\n38\n00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.390\nThese are talking about software\nthat maybe you need to deploy, or\n\n39\n00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.450\nsettings that need to be deployed.\n\n40\n00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.390\nDifferent types of organizational\nspecifics that are gonna come into play.\n\n41\n00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.520\nSo it's cool that we can put the software\nand the management into the cloud.\n\n42\n00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.200\nThat way I can access that\nmanagement from anywhere I need to.\n\n43\n00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.010\nThat's the good part of\nthis type of service.\n\n44\n00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.340\nBut the management itself,\nactually making the settings and\n\n45\n00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.940\nmaking things do exactly what it is\nwe need it to do for our business or\n\n46\n00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.150\nour environment, that's gonna be us.\n\n47\n00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.520\nLuckily Microsoft has built these,\na couple of nice management systems\n\n48\n00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.050\nthat work out of the Cloud, that we can\naccess from anywhere, we just now have to\n\n49\n00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.840\nknow what they are, how they work, and how\nwe can implement those in our environment.\n\n50\n00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.360\n>> Well, I'm glad you brought that up,\nbecause what we're actually taking a look\n\n51\n00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.881\nat first is one of the systems that\nis really going to be in use for\n\n52\n00:02:48.881 --> 00:02:53.532\na lot of companies because it gives us the\nability to do something we really haven't\n\n53\n00:02:53.532 --> 00:02:57.387\nbeen able to do on a person by person\nbasis or a device by device basis,\n\n54\n00:02:57.387 --> 00:02:59.979\nI should say more than\nthat would just be able to\n\n55\n00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:03.724\nmanage those devices regardless\nof where they are on this planet.\n\n56\n00:03:03.724 --> 00:03:08.162\nNow, a lot of companies that end up using\nlaptops, right, they issue out laptops to\n\n57\n00:03:08.162 --> 00:03:11.788\nthe employees, that means that\nsomebody has to go to a technician and\n\n58\n00:03:11.788 --> 00:03:13.747\nthat software has to be put on there.\n\n59\n00:03:13.747 --> 00:03:15.510\nNormally, there's an image that's created.\n\n60\n00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.970\nIn other words, they go ahead and\n\n61\n00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.180\nthey make an operating system, they put\nall of the actual applications on it, and\n\n62\n00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.610\nthey load that on to all\nthe computers at the same time.\n\n63\n00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.210\nAnd then they issue that computer to\nan individual user perfectly fine.\n\n64\n00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.870\nThat works great, and\nactually has worked for a long time.\n\n65\n00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.650\nBut the problem also happens to be\nnow if we take somebody like that,\n\n66\n00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.280\nand let's say they're a salesperson for\na company and now they're out on the road\n\n67\n00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.580\nsomewhere and there it is, they're on\ntheir computer and they go to a website.\n\n68\n00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.000\nAnd it says, oh yeah,\nI wanna download this game.\n\n69\n00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.290\nIt's for free.\n\n70\n00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.150\nThey download that game\nonto that computer and\n\n71\n00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.750\nthen they bring that computer\nback onto your network.\n\n72\n00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.880\nAnd Daniel, what are the chances that\nif they download this free game from\n\n73\n00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.110\nBob's World Site,\nwhatever it might be, that\n\n74\n00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.980\nthey not only downloaded that game but\nthey might have downloaded something else?\n\n75\n00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.850\n>> Yeah, there's a real good possibility\nsome baddies might be installed in\n\n76\n00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.010\nThat's what we want to avoid.\n\n77\n00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.590\nNow we try to mitigate that type of\nthing using things like antivirus and\n\n78\n00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.470\nanti malware systems,\nyou're still going to want to do that, but\n\n79\n00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.650\nwe get a little better control over what\nactually gets installed in our systems\n\n80\n00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.910\nwhen we implement this type\nof cloud technologies.\n\n81\n00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.160\nAnd that is really one of it's\nshining stars to be honest with you,\n\n82\n00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.400\nis our ability to finely control what is\nhappening at the end users experience\n\n83\n00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.090\nand again going back to that whole idea\nof it doesn't matter where I'm at.\n\n84\n00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.820\nI don't have to be at my work desk,\non my work computer, or\n\n85\n00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.650\nusing some sort of virtual private\nnetwork to remote into our network so\n\n86\n00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.330\nthat we can have some sort of talking, oh,\nI can actually just log into my portal,\n\n87\n00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.810\nmake my management changes and\neverything works.\n\n88\n00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:55.580\nI can say hey,\n\n89\n00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.630\nyou've installed Bob's game there,\nthat is a no-no here on our environment.\n\n90\n00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.400\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nremove that for you.\n\n91\n00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.900\n>> You definitely can do that.\n\n92\n00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.970\nSo, what ends up happening then is that\nthere's a product called Windows Intune.\n\n93\n00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.250\nWindows Intune is designed to help\nyou to manage those devices that\n\n94\n00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.985\nyou need to control, right?\n\n95\n00:05:13.985 --> 00:05:15.295\nWhy?\nBecause your company might have\n\n96\n00:05:15.295 --> 00:05:17.915\nproprietary data on those laptops.\n\n97\n00:05:17.915 --> 00:05:18.965\nYour company may actually say,\n\n98\n00:05:18.965 --> 00:05:21.875\nlook, we only need these\napplications on this laptop.\n\n99\n00:05:21.875 --> 00:05:25.860\nI don't need Ronnie just picking whatever\napplications he wants to install on it.\n\n100\n00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.420\nCuz he think's it's his when it's\nreally our company's laptop instead.\n\n101\n00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.630\nIt may be that Ronnie keeps\n\n102\n00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.830\nrejecting every time it says\nWindows updates are available.\n\n103\n00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.880\nAnd he just goes and\nsays yeah I'm not gonna update.\n\n104\n00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.360\nAnd now that computer goes\nwithout updating for six weeks.\n\n105\n00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.450\nSo anytime you have these devices, now,\nWindows Intune is actually designed not\n\n106\n00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.910\nonly to manage things like PCs which\nit can do very effectively, but\n\n107\n00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.750\nalso laptops, tablets and even phones.\n\n108\n00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.450\nNow when we talk about phones, these\nsmart phones, not only Windows phones.\n\n109\n00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:01.990\nBut even iOS based phones, so\nlike even the popular iPhone and\n\n110\n00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.150\neven Android devices, so\nit can actually hook in and do that.\n\n111\n00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.460\nThe way it does this is fairly simple.\n\n112\n00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.940\nWhen you do purchase Windows Intune and\nyou're gonna be managing it,\n\n113\n00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.180\nyou have to get that computer then\nto be recognized inside of Intune.\n\n114\n00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.730\nAnd what they do is they\nactually go ahead and\n\n115\n00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.550\nsay, here's a piece of software that\nneeds to be installed on every computer\n\n116\n00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.340\nthat's gonna be manages by, or\nevery phone, or every tablet.\n\n117\n00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.870\nSo, let's take a look at our\ncomputer here as we get started and\n\n118\n00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.690\ntake a look at Windows Intune.\n\n119\n00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:30.630\nSo on this computer,\nI already went ahead and\n\n120\n00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.370\nlaunched up the site that we actually\nnormally go to, the Windows Intune.\n\n121\n00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:35.630\nAnd that means that there's\nalready an account,\n\n122\n00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.290\nthere's everything actually created.\n\n123\n00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:41.130\nAnd this time I'm gonna use\nDaniel's account to help us out.\n\n124\n00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.820\nAnd from there I'm simply\ngonna type in his password.\n\n125\n00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:45.850\n>> Ronnie's stealing my password.\n\n126\n00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.830\n>> I am, I stole his password\nat that point in time.\n\n127\n00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.170\nAnd what normally happens is you\nsee something like this, right?\n\n128\n00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.120\nSo, if I were to given Daniel an account,\neven if this computer's not joined but\n\n129\n00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.000\nI'm supposed to manage it, it allows us to\nget access to what's called this company\n\n130\n00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.390\nportal, and right now it says hey, there's\nactually some applications that Daniel\n\n131\n00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.780\ncan install if we need to and\nif we go ahead and\n\n132\n00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.690\nclick on categories, we might even find\nthat there's other ones out there.\n\n133\n00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.670\nNow at this point it doesn't seem to be\nso, but these are two applications that he\n\n134\n00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:17.200\nmight need to actually be able to use\nwhen he's out there in the field.\n\n135\n00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.471\nBut right now the problem\nthat I have is simple.\n\n136\n00:07:19.471 --> 00:07:24.711\nIt says that this device is not enrolled\nor the company portal cannot identify it.\n\n137\n00:07:24.711 --> 00:07:28.474\nSo, even if this was the first time and\nI didn't send him the software,\n\n138\n00:07:28.474 --> 00:07:32.363\nhe could simply log in that site and\nthis is what would have to happen here,\n\n139\n00:07:32.363 --> 00:07:35.061\nis that he'd select Enroll,\nand from this point,\n\n140\n00:07:35.061 --> 00:07:40.220\nhe'd have to download the software and\nthen get it installed onto the computer.\n\n141\n00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.980\nSo, if we go ahead and\nI'm gonna run this from right now.\n\n142\n00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.692\nAnd so it should just take a few moments\nfor it to actually kind of download and\n\n143\n00:07:47.692 --> 00:07:49.672\nget it run after it does a security scan.\n\n144\n00:07:49.672 --> 00:07:54.020\nAnd what should happen then is that\nit will now connect his computer into\n\n145\n00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.135\nthe Windows Intune account,\nand it's signed up,\n\n146\n00:07:57.135 --> 00:08:01.710\nand it actually had him log back in to\nget access to this little window here.\n\n147\n00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:05.611\nAnd all he's doing is he's following the\nbasic instructions to get it installed.\n\n148\n00:08:05.611 --> 00:08:10.100\nWhat should end up happening is once it\ninstalls it's going to take a few minutes\n\n149\n00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:14.430\nfor it to sync up and get access,\nor get access into Windows Intune.\n\n150\n00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:17.450\nSo at this point that's all it's doing\nis actually making that connection.\n\n151\n00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.830\nAnd then it's going to install that\nclient software right on this computer.\n\n152\n00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:24.404\nAnd you actually see it going right\nnow as it copies some new files.\n\n153\n00:08:24.404 --> 00:08:28.863\nWhat should end up as a result when\nwe are done is it'll put a little\n\n154\n00:08:28.863 --> 00:08:32.754\nmanagement agent on the computer and\nonce that's done,\n\n155\n00:08:32.754 --> 00:08:37.882\nwe will then actually see that we can\ngain access to not only that software.\n\n156\n00:08:37.882 --> 00:08:40.610\nBut there may be even\nmore that now allows for\n\n157\n00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:43.200\ncontrol from the Windows in tune portal.\n\n158\n00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.241\nThat's what will end up happening, and so\n\n159\n00:08:45.241 --> 00:08:48.925\nit tells us that once we actually do\nthat and we've downloaded the software,\n\n160\n00:08:48.925 --> 00:08:53.140\nhopefully what will happen at this point\nis that it will take the time to enroll.\n\n161\n00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:57.110\nNow normally even if Daniel were to come\nback to this site in a couple of minutes,\n\n162\n00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:59.690\nhe might still see this where\nit's actually not enrolled or\n\n163\n00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:03.230\nthe company portal cannot identify it, cuz\nit does take a little bit of time to make\n\n164\n00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:06.330\nsure that everything's kind of\nsynced up the way it needs to.\n\n165\n00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:10.130\nBut even if it still says it,\nhe can always click back here.\n\n166\n00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:14.350\nAnd if he actually sees there's going to\nbe another link at some point that says,\n\n167\n00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:18.970\nhey look you just need to identify that\nthis is the device that you're on.\n\n168\n00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:22.380\nSo that's what will happen, but\nit will take a little bit of time.\n\n169\n00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.590\nSo, once everything is done\nthen we'll actually be able to\n\n170\n00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.190\nsee some of the additional\nmanagement of this.\n\n171\n00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:29.590\nNow on the other side of this,\n\n172\n00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:33.410\nI already have a computer that is actually\nalready done that way and so we want to\n\n173\n00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:37.840\nshow you the management side just briefly\nof what it looks like inside of Intune.\n\n174\n00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.080\nSo let me see if I can get to that\ncomputer which is right here.\n\n175\n00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.800\nSo this is\nthe Windows Intune Management Portal.\n\n176\n00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:51.730\nAnd so if I were to select, let's see,\nthe all computers over here.\n\n177\n00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:55.730\nSo if I were to select all the computers\nI can see that there's now a total of\n\n178\n00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:58.300\ntwo devices right above my head.\n\n179\n00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.381\nIf I go ahead and\nselect right up here, devices,\n\n180\n00:10:01.381 --> 00:10:05.304\nI'll actually end up seeing what\ntwo devices that there are.\n\n181\n00:10:05.304 --> 00:10:10.771\nSo here is actually one called demo\nclient and here's one called client 01.\n\n182\n00:10:10.771 --> 00:10:14.510\nA lab at IT Pro TV when we have this.\n\n183\n00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:18.851\nSo both of these are actually devices\nthat I can manage right here.\n\n184\n00:10:18.851 --> 00:10:22.255\nSo if I were to log on with any of those\nother two devices as the other ones\n\n185\n00:10:22.255 --> 00:10:23.310\ngetting set up here.\n\n186\n00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:27.765\nBut what it allows us to be able to do\nthen, if Daniel is the administrator or\n\n187\n00:10:27.765 --> 00:10:30.454\nI'm the administrator,\nI can do what Daniel\n\n188\n00:10:30.454 --> 00:10:34.830\nhas talked about which is this retire and\nwipe if we wanted to.\n\n189\n00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:38.120\nSo it gives us a couple of options\ndepending on how much control of that\n\n190\n00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.410\ncomputer I have.\n\n191\n00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:41.270\nOne is selectively wipe the device.\n\n192\n00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:44.770\nAnd that says it'll only remove\nthe company data managed by InTune,\n\n193\n00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:47.310\nleaving personal data,\nwill actually, you know.\n\n194\n00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.720\nSo it doesn't completely\nwipe out the device.\n\n195\n00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.820\nThe other one here is a full wipe,\nreturning it to a factory setting.\n\n196\n00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.540\nSo it is possible you can\ndo something like that, but\n\n197\n00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:59.480\njust kind of realize that you\ndo have a lot of control here.\n\n198\n00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.880\nSo, and we're not going to\ndo either one right now.\n\n199\n00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.750\nThe other one that actually gives us the\nability to do that is so we can control it\n\n200\n00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.980\nfrom that standpoint, but\nremember we talked about updates, right?\n\n201\n00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.510\nThe very fact is sometimes a user just\nsays I'm not gonna do those updates,\n\n202\n00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.240\nit gives me the option to stop it.\n\n203\n00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:14.840\nIf I do the updates.\n\n204\n00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.720\nSo it's gonna tell me I need to reboot.\n\n205\n00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.810\nWell right here, instead all the updates\nwill come through Intune, and\n\n206\n00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.690\nthen I can click here and see.\n\n207\n00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:23.500\nAnd look at that.\n\n208\n00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.400\nThere's over 1,000 updates.\n\n209\n00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.852\nNow that doesn't mean it all\napplies to your computer.\n\n210\n00:11:26.852 --> 00:11:31.043\nYou can see this first one says\nWindows XP Update Package from 2001.\n\n211\n00:11:31.043 --> 00:11:32.227\nI'm probably not gonna apply that one.\n\n212\n00:11:32.227 --> 00:11:33.725\n>> Yeah, you're not running the XP there,\nare you Ronnie?\n\n213\n00:11:33.725 --> 00:11:37.060\n[LAUGH]\n>> No, nor am I running Word 2007.\n\n214\n00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.160\nSo it actually is fairly cumulative.\n\n215\n00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.960\nBut remember what you can do,\nespecially if there's security updates,\n\n216\n00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:46.540\nas you might push some of these out for\nyour operating system instead.\n\n217\n00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:50.060\nSo that way, it doesn't matter whether\nRonnie wants to do the updates or not.\n\n218\n00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.780\nI can actually select those.\n\n219\n00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:55.190\nAnd then at that point, approve them and\ntell it, hey go ahead and\n\n220\n00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:56.900\nstart pushing those things out.\n\n221\n00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.260\nAnd then when the user logs in,\n\n222\n00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.800\nit tells them that there's\ncritical updates that are waiting.\n\n223\n00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.690\nAnd it absolutely will\nbegin to install it.\n\n224\n00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:06.840\nSo, you name it, that's another\nfeature that can actually happen.\n\n225\n00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.600\nSo we can go ahead and\nmange it in this way too.\n\n226\n00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.490\nNow the apps that you were seeing before.\n\n227\n00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:14.850\nIf I select apps.\n\n228\n00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:16.740\nThese are apps that we can control.\n\n229\n00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:21.030\nSo, if we have a business app\nthat only my company runs and\n\n230\n00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.990\nI need to make sure it\nactually gets out there.\n\n231\n00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:26.869\nWe can upload them here and then from\nthis point, I can choose the computers to\n\n232\n00:12:26.869 --> 00:12:30.284\ndeploy that app, in other words,\nto actually push that app out to.\n\n233\n00:12:30.284 --> 00:12:34.899\nYou name it, this is a huge management\nfeature, and this is something that is\n\n234\n00:12:34.899 --> 00:12:39.017\nreally great because at the end of\nit even if Daniel walks away from a,\n\n235\n00:12:39.017 --> 00:12:41.371\nI should say he owns a company.\n\n236\n00:12:41.371 --> 00:12:44.085\nSo even if I walk away from a company and\nI have the laptop,\n\n237\n00:12:44.085 --> 00:12:47.428\nI don't end up getting all of\nthe information that was proprietary for\n\n238\n00:12:47.428 --> 00:12:50.310\nthe company because I can\nselectively wipe it here.\n\n239\n00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:52.400\nI can actually manage the applications.\n\n240\n00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.920\nAnd even better than that,\nis that you have the ability.\n\n241\n00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.400\nAnd we're not getting into it today.\n\n242\n00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.507\nBut you can actually run\na report on that computer.\n\n243\n00:12:58.507 --> 00:13:00.387\nFind out all the apps are installed, and\n\n244\n00:13:00.387 --> 00:13:03.316\nthen do what Daniel talked about\na little earlier, which is a,\n\n245\n00:13:03.316 --> 00:13:07.242\nyeah that app doesn't belong there, I'm\ngoing to go ahead and uninstall that app,\n\n246\n00:13:07.242 --> 00:13:10.917\nand we don't even have to be right there,\nso it's a huge management feature.\n\n247\n00:13:10.917 --> 00:13:13.345\nA great one that you'll probably\nend up seeing in the future.\n\n248\n00:13:13.345 --> 00:13:16.945\n>> Yeah this is a great option that\nMicrosoft has given us to have\n\n249\n00:13:16.945 --> 00:13:20.855\nsome cloud management that lets\nus homogenize our environment.\n\n250\n00:13:20.855 --> 00:13:24.095\nThat just basically means they\nmake everything more similar.\n\n251\n00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:25.605\nWe want this software.\n\n252\n00:13:25.605 --> 00:13:28.325\nWe want these updates to be controlled.\n\n253\n00:13:28.325 --> 00:13:29.915\nAnd we don't have to be crazy.\n\n254\n00:13:29.915 --> 00:13:32.615\nWe don't have to have a large\nEnterprise environment to do it.\n\n255\n00:13:32.615 --> 00:13:36.372\nWe can do this with small office,\nhome office environment,\n\n256\n00:13:36.372 --> 00:13:39.981\nwe can do it just with our home\ncomputers if we feel like it,\n\n257\n00:13:39.981 --> 00:13:43.681\nmaking our control over those\na little more controllable.\n\n258\n00:13:43.681 --> 00:13:47.025\nI guess that is a good word for\nthat right, because anywhere we're at,\n\n259\n00:13:47.025 --> 00:13:49.475\nwe need to make a change,\nwe need to tweak a setting,\n\n260\n00:13:49.475 --> 00:13:51.519\nwe can do that through that cloud service.\n\n261\n00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:53.931\nMicrosoft Intune is\na very cool feature and\n\n262\n00:13:53.931 --> 00:13:57.616\nnot that it couldn't be used in\na large Enterprise environment,\n\n263\n00:13:57.616 --> 00:14:00.832\nit very much is used in large\nEnterprise environments but\n\n264\n00:14:00.832 --> 00:14:05.905\nnormally you'll see if you have those\nlarger corporate-type entities going on.\n\n265\n00:14:05.905 --> 00:14:08.545\nIt's gonna be something\na little more in depth,\n\n266\n00:14:08.545 --> 00:14:11.635\nprobably going toward the tune of\nthe Azure stuff, right Ronnie?\n\n267\n00:14:11.635 --> 00:14:12.905\n>> There's no doubt.\n\n268\n00:14:12.905 --> 00:14:15.145\nWhen you start talking about\nservices that you might hear,\n\n269\n00:14:15.145 --> 00:14:19.395\nyou might be wondering, Intune and Azure,\nwell really what's the difference?\n\n270\n00:14:19.395 --> 00:14:21.450\nOne of them is about management and\ncontrol, right?\n\n271\n00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:24.190\nOf things that are really\nimportant to your company and\n\n272\n00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:26.220\nthat's what Windows In Tune\nhelps you to do.\n\n273\n00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:29.000\nEspecially on those devices that you\nknow that you have to be able to manage\n\n274\n00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.860\nregardless of where they are.\n\n275\n00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:35.170\nAzure is more like the old\nspaghetti sauce commercials.\n\n276\n00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:37.250\nWhere it says, is it in there?\n\n277\n00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:37.990\nIt's in there.\n\n278\n00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:42.290\nYou name it, it's actually in there and\nit gives you the ability to really be\n\n279\n00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:48.780\nthe manager of all of your cloud services\nis what Microsoft Azure is all about.\n\n280\n00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:52.040\nSo it gives you a lot of access to be able\nto create everything that you actually\n\n281\n00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.020\nwant to and even more.\n\n282\n00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:58.870\nAnd the nice thing about it is that\nit's almost a pay as feature, so\n\n283\n00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:00.850\nan a la carte kind of thing.\n\n284\n00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:03.970\nIf you want some of this but you don't\nwant that, you don't pay for those.\n\n285\n00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:05.450\nYou just simply say hey, if I build this,\n\n286\n00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:07.450\nthis here's what I'm\ngoing to pay extra for.\n\n287\n00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:10.410\nIf I don't build it, I'm not going\nto get charged for it as well.\n\n288\n00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.180\nSo these are features that you might have.\n\n289\n00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:15.790\nSo one of the neatest inside of Azure is,\n\n290\n00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:19.270\nremember that you might say hey,\nI need to build an email server.\n\n291\n00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:22.360\nAnd you can build that email server, if\nyou don't want somebody else to manage it,\n\n292\n00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.020\nyou can build it on your own, but you\ndon't have to build it on your equipment.\n\n293\n00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:28.070\nSo they provide all of the hardware and\nthe background, and\n\n294\n00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:31.871\nthey provide the portal so that you can\nactually manage all these features.\n\n295\n00:15:31.871 --> 00:15:36.330\nAnd do everything that you want to with\nit but you actually have more control.\n\n296\n00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.170\nSo if you go, is there storage in?\n\n297\n00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:39.790\nYes.\nIt's in there.\n\n298\n00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:43.250\nDo you have access to data base\nservers that you wanna trade them?\n\n299\n00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:43.790\nIt's in there.\n\n300\n00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:45.020\nYou name it, it is.\n\n301\n00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:49.000\nIt's kinda the spaghetti sauce or\nwhat the spaghetti of your company.\n\n302\n00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.180\nThat it covers everything\nthat you actually really need\n\n303\n00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.720\nif you want to do this.\n\n304\n00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:58.409\nSo, I actually do have access\nto an Azure Cloud account, here.\n\n305\n00:15:58.409 --> 00:16:01.323\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\nswipe on over to that one.\n\n306\n00:16:01.323 --> 00:16:03.388\nAnd you can see right here.\n\n307\n00:16:03.388 --> 00:16:07.244\nThat it gives us access to\na lot of different things.\n\n308\n00:16:07.244 --> 00:16:11.700\nI can create web applications,\nmanage mobile services and\n\n309\n00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.980\nthese other things that are out here.\n\n310\n00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:18.740\nBizTalk is all about that collaboration\nand that ability to do something\n\n311\n00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.450\nlike Skype that we have and\nbeing able to do that within the business.\n\n312\n00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:25.130\nRecovery services,\ncontent delivery networks.\n\n313\n00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:27.870\nYou name it, it gives us\neverything that we have available.\n\n314\n00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:32.430\nNow, the Windows 8\nmachine that I was using,\n\n315\n00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:37.130\nthis is not running on my computer, even\ninside of a virtual machine environment.\n\n316\n00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.450\nNow I just used a term I probably\nshouldn't have used here,\n\n317\n00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:41.220\nbecause you might not\nknow what that means.\n\n318\n00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.720\nWell, what the heck is a virtual machine?\n\n319\n00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:47.390\nA virtual machine really is like\ncarpooling, but for a computer.\n\n320\n00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:48.000\nRight.\n\n321\n00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.570\nSo when you carpool, it's like Daniel has\na car and we just jump in the same car.\n\n322\n00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:55.870\nWe're using that car, Daniel's the one\nthat's driving, but I'm sitting there,\n\n323\n00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:59.300\nI'm really getting the use out of that\nvehicle even though I'm not driving.\n\n324\n00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.290\nWell computers can do the same\nthing in today's world.\n\n325\n00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:04.890\nIs that, what we can do is we can\nhave one set of hardware, but\n\n326\n00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:09.710\nthen we can run multiple operating systems\non them, and they're treated as if they're\n\n327\n00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:12.430\nindividual computers, but\nthey're using the same hardware.\n\n328\n00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.860\nThat works.\nEven on my computer,\n\n329\n00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:16.650\nthat's exactly what I'm using here,\n\n330\n00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:20.026\non my computer is that we have software\nthat allows us to be able to do that.\n\n331\n00:17:20.026 --> 00:17:23.913\nWell you can do it inside of Cloud\nservices, and when you do something like\n\n332\n00:17:23.913 --> 00:17:27.374\nthat then you can actually create\nas many machines as you want to.\n\n333\n00:17:27.374 --> 00:17:31.777\nAnd instead of now, Daniel says,\nI need the latest and\n\n334\n00:17:31.777 --> 00:17:35.629\ngreatest XPS that is\nactually out there to run.\n\n335\n00:17:35.629 --> 00:17:36.887\nI can say, no Daniel,\n\n336\n00:17:36.887 --> 00:17:40.807\nwhat you really need is access to\nthe machine that I'm gonna give you.\n\n337\n00:17:40.807 --> 00:17:45.230\nSo yes, on that 10 year old laptop that\nyou have, you're still gonna run this.\n\n338\n00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:48.813\nAnd yes, it will actually end up working\na lot of times if you're doing something\n\n339\n00:17:48.813 --> 00:17:49.760\nlike that.\n\n340\n00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.995\nSo this machine right here is\nactually running in the Cloud itself.\n\n341\n00:17:52.995 --> 00:17:56.700\nSo this is a virtual machine that's\nactually not running on my computer,\n\n342\n00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:00.840\nit is connected somewhere inside\nof this Microsoft Azure Cloud.\n\n343\n00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.190\nAnd you can see right here,\nit's the demo client zero one.\n\n344\n00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:06.900\nIt tells me its running and\neverything is up and going.\n\n345\n00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.020\nSo very easily.\n\n346\n00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:11.180\nLet me show you how fast this\nactually is to make something.\n\n347\n00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:16.310\nSo if all the sudden we realized that\nwe needed another virtual machine here,\n\n348\n00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:20.530\nwell all I have to do is go ahead and\nselect NEW.\n\n349\n00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:24.548\nAnd from this point on it\nsays virtual machine, and\n\n350\n00:18:24.548 --> 00:18:28.013\nI can go ahead and\nselect FROM GALLERY here.\n\n351\n00:18:28.013 --> 00:18:32.682\nAnd then it actually says, hey we already\npre-configured some of this stuff to work.\n\n352\n00:18:32.682 --> 00:18:38.920\nSo if I wanted to build in a Server 2012\ndata center here, we can actually do that.\n\n353\n00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:44.010\nIf I wanted to do, let's say a Windows 8\n\n354\n00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:49.350\ninstall, well I can scroll down and\nsee that there it is.\n\n355\n00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:52.770\nThere is another Windows 8 machine\nthat I can select right there.\n\n356\n00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:56.220\nAnd then I click Next, or the arrow,\nand then it gives me a name.\n\n357\n00:18:56.220 --> 00:19:01.896\nI'm gonna call this one demoClient02.\n\n358\n00:19:01.896 --> 00:19:04.300\nAnd standard.\n\n359\n00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:06.660\nAnd you can see that it\nactually gives you like,\n\n360\n00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.870\nhey, what do you want the core\nof the computer to actually be?\n\n361\n00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:13.152\nAnd I'll use Ronald this time actually,\nlet's use Daniel.\n\n362\n00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:21.685\nAnd, oops.\n\n363\n00:19:21.685 --> 00:19:24.758\nMy typing is not the best and\nyou can see, that's amazing,\n\n364\n00:19:24.758 --> 00:19:27.601\nthat I can actually type two\nwhen I think is identical.\n\n365\n00:19:27.601 --> 00:19:28.762\n>> We should make a typing course.\n\n366\n00:19:28.762 --> 00:19:30.270\n[LAUGH]\n>> I know, yeah.\n\n367\n00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:31.281\nIt still wouldn't help me.\n\n368\n00:19:31.281 --> 00:19:33.420\n>> Ronnie's on that video.\n\n369\n00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.930\n>> Yeah,\nI'd be the worst student in the world.\n\n370\n00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:38.000\nBut then it actually says,\nwhat do I want to create,\n\n371\n00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.590\ndo I want to create a new Cloud service?\n\n372\n00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:40.800\nDo I want to do that?\n\n373\n00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:44.460\nAnd I do, cuz what I'm saying is I want\nthis to be a machine that's actually out\n\n374\n00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:49.400\nthere in the Cloud, I can even go and\nselect the time zone that I'm in.\n\n375\n00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:53.530\nAnd availability set, that's fine,\nI don't need all that stuff here.\n\n376\n00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:55.510\nAnd then it also says, hey,\nhow are you gonna connect?\n\n377\n00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:58.490\nAnd notice I can use PowerShell,\nand Remote Desktop.\n\n378\n00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:01.370\nI can actually use a bunch of other\nconnections that are out there.\n\n379\n00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:04.370\nBut at that point,\nI just simply go ahead and select that.\n\n380\n00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:08.030\nIf I wanna install any additional\nsoftware, all this is a la carte.\n\n381\n00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:10.380\nSo remember you actually installed\nsome of this stuff and they say,\n\n382\n00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.600\nwell that's gonna cost you\na little bit more money.\n\n383\n00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.515\nAnd so it is tied into an account and\n\n384\n00:20:14.515 --> 00:20:17.260\nthat will cost you money as you\nactually build these things.\n\n385\n00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:18.290\nAnd then, there is is.\n\n386\n00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:19.840\nSimply you putting a check-mark.\n\n387\n00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:20.880\nNow, think about it.\n\n388\n00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.970\nI'm now building a computer, Daniel.\n\n389\n00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:26.120\nIn the old days, Daniel you would have\nactually had to call a company and\n\n390\n00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:30.500\nsay, here's the hardware I need,\nI need a monitor,\n\n391\n00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.950\nI need this, I need to make sure it has\nthis much this much this much here.\n\n392\n00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:36.460\nOh, and I also need to make\nsure I have licensing for it.\n\n393\n00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:40.340\nSo you might wait two to three days\nmaybe before that computer comes in.\n\n394\n00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:45.600\nGet it set up and then, oh, operating\nsystem, applications and everything.\n\n395\n00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:50.230\nWell, I'm building that computer right\nhere, and in about 10-15 minutes\n\n396\n00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:54.440\nwhat's probably gonna end up happening\nis that it will be ready to run.\n\n397\n00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:58.550\nSo, in other words, it's ready to run and\nall I have to do is send a little file\n\n398\n00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:01.700\nover to Daniel and say,\nDaniel, here is your machine.\n\n399\n00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:05.560\nAnd then Daniel can actually have that\nfile and run it anywhere that he wants to,\n\n400\n00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:09.340\nas long as it has the correct\nremote desktop connection software.\n\n401\n00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:12.580\nAnd the end result will be\nlike what we see right here,\n\n402\n00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:16.200\nis that we will actually connect in\nusing that remote desktop software.\n\n403\n00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.620\nAnd Daniel will actually be able to\ndo all the work that he needs and\n\n404\n00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:21.140\nhave it ready to go.\n\n405\n00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:24.080\nAnd all of that is actually right\nthere at the tip of the fingers.\n\n406\n00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:28.580\nSo within five minutes, I was able to\nactually start building a computer.\n\n407\n00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.880\nAnd then from that point on,\nonce everything is done,\n\n408\n00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.020\nthat's all we have to do.\n\n409\n00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:35.670\nIt is an amazing product\nto be able to do that.\n\n410\n00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:40.810\nAnd just as simply, if I don't need\nDaniel to access that computer anymore,\n\n411\n00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:43.220\nI can just select that machine and\njust delete it, and\n\n412\n00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:45.560\npretty much tear it down,\nand we're ready to go.\n\n413\n00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.820\nAnd there's a lot of extra\nfeatures that are in here.\n\n414\n00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.810\nBut just kind of remember, if you're\ntalking about anything that's actually\n\n415\n00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:54.140\nneeds to be covered,\nas far as services go, Azure.\n\n416\n00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:56.350\nIf you're talking about management and\nstrict control,\n\n417\n00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:58.310\nyou're talking about Intune at that point.\n\n418\n00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:01.290\n>> Yeah, the great thing\nabout Azure is the fact that\n\n419\n00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:04.385\nit's basically virtualization\ninto the Cloud.\n\n420\n00:22:04.385 --> 00:22:08.660\nThey're taking all the great features of\nvirtualization, I can build machines very\n\n421\n00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:12.570\nquickly, I can copy a machine if\nI want to, it all becomes a file.\n\n422\n00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:14.340\nAnd I've just moved all\nthat stuff into the Cloud,\n\n423\n00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:16.340\nI no longer have to support the hardware.\n\n424\n00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:21.560\nI don't have to buy server hardware, and\nthen if a hard drive fails I've got to\n\n425\n00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:25.450\ngo in at 2 AM, pull that hard drive out,\nhopefully I've got a hot spare sitting and\n\n426\n00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:28.360\nwaiting, I slap that sucker in and\ngo back to action, and\n\n427\n00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.820\nthen hopefully go back to sleep, and\nthen come into work all bleary-eyed.\n\n428\n00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:35.070\nNo, I just say, you know what,\nthat hard drive went down.\n\n429\n00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.260\nGuess what, Microsoft is handling that,\n\n430\n00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:40.130\nbecause I don't worry about\nthe hardware part any more.\n\n431\n00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:40.860\nIt's over and done with,\n\n432\n00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.120\nI don't have to pay the electricity\nbill when it comes to that.\n\n433\n00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.110\nAll I do is pay for my access to Azure,\nlike Ronnie says it's al la carte.\n\n434\n00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:50.830\nI only pay for what I want and\nI get exactly what I need.\n\n435\n00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:55.310\nYou can go all the way as thorough\nas basically hosting your entire\n\n436\n00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:59.290\ninfrastructure for a corporate\nenvironment in the Azure system.\n\n437\n00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:01.150\nIt is super nice to be able to say,\n\n438\n00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:04.040\nyou know what,\nactive directory is now available for\n\n439\n00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:08.730\nanyone that has the ability to connect\nto the internet, to our Azure systems.\n\n440\n00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:10.880\nHey, that's pretty awesome, right?\n\n441\n00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.390\nI want to be able to, I don't know,\npush my website out and\n\n442\n00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:18.430\nnot have to worry about if we lose power\nto the building and my website goes down.\n\n443\n00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:20.350\nHey, Azure's got that covered too.\n\n444\n00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:24.260\nE-mail, not a problem, that's obviously\ngonna be one of the big ones.\n\n445\n00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:28.490\nSo, as you can see, Azure's more for the\nlarge corporate entity trying to make sure\n\n446\n00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:33.410\nthat infrastructure is being a service\nto you as we're in tunes more of the,\n\n447\n00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:37.780\nI have some computers in an environment\nthat I need to control, software and\n\n448\n00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:38.800\nthings like that.\n\n449\n00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:43.210\nSo you can even work the both together,\nin collaboration,\n\n450\n00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:44.950\nthat would be a very nice combo.\n\n451\n00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:49.140\nTo say, hey I've even got computers that\naren't a part of my active directory,\n\n452\n00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:53.440\nwhich is the domain structure of a large\nMicrosoft corporate environment.\n\n453\n00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:57.537\nIf I got people bringing computers\ninto my environment, I can say, hey,\n\n454\n00:23:57.537 --> 00:23:58.405\nyou know what?\n\n455\n00:23:58.405 --> 00:24:01.220\nWe can go ahead and\nlet you install that agent, and\n\n456\n00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:05.927\nmake sure that your computer is in a state\nthat is compatible with our environment.\n\n457\n00:24:05.927 --> 00:24:10.667\nWe don't want to leave ourselves open to\nAn outside entity bringing in a virus or\n\n458\n00:24:10.667 --> 00:24:15.070\nmalware or any other kind of baddie\nthat we wouldn't want on our network.\n\n459\n00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:16.870\nI could say you're going\nto need this software.\n\n460\n00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:18.560\nYou're going to need this type of access.\n\n461\n00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.867\nI can use my Intune to do that with people\nthat aren't even a part of our business.\n\n462\n00:24:21.867 --> 00:24:24.489\nThey just go ahead and\nroll themselves into InTune,\n\n463\n00:24:24.489 --> 00:24:28.377\nthey allow me to management and when\nthey're done I can hit that remote wipe.\n\n464\n00:24:28.377 --> 00:24:32.113\nIt removes all that stuff done and they're\noff to wherever the next place is for\n\n465\n00:24:32.113 --> 00:24:35.080\nthem and we're still running\njust like we like to run.\n\n466\n00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:36.390\nIt's a very nice combination.\n\n467\n00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:41.350\nHopefully you're seeing the benefits\nof these cloud services,\n\n468\n00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:43.770\nand probably gonna be\nthe way we're gonna go.\n\n469\n00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:48.560\nI would venture to say cloud services\nare gonna start really trumping\n\n470\n00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:51.810\nlocal infrastructure and\nhaving that hardware.\n\n471\n00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:52.460\n>> And their future.\n\n472\n00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:53.160\n>> Yeah.\nIn the future,\n\n473\n00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.410\nit's just going to be the way it goes.\n\n474\n00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:56.970\n>> There's also just a couple of other\nterms that you also need to know,\n\n475\n00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:59.680\nwhy cloud services are really beneficial.\n\n476\n00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.970\nSo you already see how you\nprobably use it even now,\n\n477\n00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:04.170\neven though you don't know that\nyou're using it, such as email.\n\n478\n00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.510\nAnd the business side level.\n\n479\n00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:10.810\nThere's things that we already worry about\nas network admins, that Daniel and I worry\n\n480\n00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:15.750\nabout which is what we call disaster\nrecovery, fault tolerance, and redundancy.\n\n481\n00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:18.590\nThose are different terminologies\nthat we need to be familiar with\n\n482\n00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:21.690\nas IT professionals that you\nknow you're going to encounter.\n\n483\n00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:25.450\nWith Azure Cloud, remember that\nwe're really trusting that they have\n\n484\n00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:29.690\nthe infrastructure, they have everything\nto help us to really overcome and\n\n485\n00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:32.100\nto help us to meet these\nneeds that I just mentioned.\n\n486\n00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.310\nDisaster recovery is\nexactly like it sounds.\n\n487\n00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:37.530\nRemember, if I have a disaster in my\nbuilding, a flood happens, fire happens,\n\n488\n00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:40.865\nand all of my infrastructure is there,\nall my data stored on there, that's it.\n\n489\n00:25:40.865 --> 00:25:42.370\nThat's gone, and believe it or not,\n\n490\n00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:46.340\neven though replacement of the equipment\nis fairly easy, replacement of the data.\n\n491\n00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:50.750\nDaniel, losing data for a business, that's\nthe one that stabs it in the heart, and\n\n492\n00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:53.080\nthat's why we have to\nworry about this idea,\n\n493\n00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:56.240\nbecause disaster recovery is something\nthat we all want to make sure of.\n\n494\n00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:01.070\nBy putting it up into the cloud, they\nreally can be a disaster recovery for us,\n\n495\n00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:03.370\neven if we have some\ninfrastructure down here, and\n\n496\n00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:06.860\nwe're relying on it, what we can do\nis we can back up to that cloud.\n\n497\n00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.030\nWe can also go ahead and\nintegrate it in, so\n\n498\n00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:12.200\nanything happens down here,\nwe actually do have something available.\n\n499\n00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.690\nNow when we start talking about that,\n\n500\n00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:16.970\nthat's also where we move into\nwhat we call fault tolerance.\n\n501\n00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:20.970\nSomething happens to our main systems,\nwell, what takes over?\n\n502\n00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:23.260\nWell, that's the answer to the question,\nright?\n\n503\n00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:25.010\nFault tolerance says, what do we do?\n\n504\n00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:28.000\nWhat do we have in place that\nif my system down here fails,\n\n505\n00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.025\nmy local systems fail, well how.\n\n506\n00:26:30.025 --> 00:26:32.105\nHow do I know that there is\nsomething that takes its place?\n\n507\n00:26:32.105 --> 00:26:34.725\nAs network admins, those things worry us.\n\n508\n00:26:34.725 --> 00:26:38.435\nSo that's why we're always looking for\nthat net idea, like what should happen\n\n509\n00:26:38.435 --> 00:26:42.345\nif something down here fails, or\nhaving things that Microsoft Azure, right,\n\n510\n00:26:42.345 --> 00:26:46.990\nas a infrastructure solution,\nreally does help us to overcome that and\n\n511\n00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:51.320\nsay, we can answer that question, but if\nall my machinery here fails, then we can\n\n512\n00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:55.200\nactually turn to the Azure Cloud and\nit's actually up and available to you.\n\n513\n00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.860\nNow the other thing that we also have to\nworry about is what we call redundancy.\n\n514\n00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:02.490\nNow it sounds like the same thing as\nfar as [INAUDIBLE] but redundancy for\n\n515\n00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:07.680\nus is the ability to take, let's say,\nfor an example, two applications,\n\n516\n00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.130\nright, or a single application,\nI should say and when you run it.\n\n517\n00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:12.610\nWell, what happens if that machine fails?\n\n518\n00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:14.870\nWell, that application is down and\nI can't access it.\n\n519\n00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:17.890\nIf it's something like email,\nwell we're kind of toast at that point,\n\n520\n00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:21.030\nbecause email is the lifeblood\nof most companies.\n\n521\n00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:24.920\nSo what we can do is we can actually\ncreate redundant emails servers.\n\n522\n00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.930\nSo if one does fail, that machine fails,\nand the application fails, well\n\n523\n00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:33.690\nthe other one is actually still up and\nrunning, that is still that same machine,\n\n524\n00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:37.540\nor an identical machine just about, and\nthe same program that’s running on it.\n\n525\n00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:41.225\nAnd we can still access it, so\nredundancy is about eliminating what,\n\n526\n00:27:41.225 --> 00:27:44.025\nI like Daniel's point here,\nsingle points of failure.\n\n527\n00:27:44.025 --> 00:27:47.265\nHe always makes that point when we talk\nabout, that's single point of failure for\n\n528\n00:27:47.265 --> 00:27:51.490\nany enterprise is what we as\nnetwork admins always look for.\n\n529\n00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:54.900\nAnd then because we actually\ncould think about, all right,\n\n530\n00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:57.370\nwhat is the answer if\nthe entire thing fails?\n\n531\n00:27:57.370 --> 00:28:00.200\nWell, fault tolerance is\nwhat's our next step?\n\n532\n00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.970\nSo that's the way that\nwe actually do that.\n\n533\n00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:04.906\nAnd then disaster recovery\nis also a big one.\n\n534\n00:28:04.906 --> 00:28:08.683\nIf something catastrophic does\nhappen Is something in place,\n\n535\n00:28:08.683 --> 00:28:12.397\nhow do we recover from that so\nthat business continues again?\n\n536\n00:28:12.397 --> 00:28:16.560\nAnd well all these cloud services really\nhelp us to meet all three of those goals.\n\n537\n00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:20.440\n>> That's right, well hopefully you guys\nare now a little bit more on top of things\n\n538\n00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.970\nwhen it starts to get cloudy in there.\n\n539\n00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:24.410\nYou understand exactly what\nthey're talking about.\n\n540\n00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:26.070\nWhat kind of services are available.\n\n541\n00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:29.160\nHopefully you've enjoyed this episode,\nwe had a great time making it for you.\n\n542\n00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.060\nThanks for watching.\n\n543\n00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:33.380\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n544\n00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:34.180\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n545\n00:28:34.180 -->

I'm\n\n3\n00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.771\nyour host Daniel Lowrey here with\nme as always is Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n4\n00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:20.620\nHow's it going Don?\n\n5\n00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.710\n>> It is going great Daniel.\n\n6\n00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.090\nExcited to be back on the show and\nto move into kinda the final\n\n7\n00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.965\nchapter of our MTA adventure\nas we move into section 5.\n\n8\n00:00:28.965 --> 00:00:32.575\nWhich really is where to start\nto focus a little bit more on\n\n9\n00:00:32.575 --> 00:00:36.405\nbusiness than we do on home and.-\n>> The big boys.\n\n10\n00:00:36.405 --> 00:00:38.785\n>> Yeah, and it's the big boys, right?\n\n11\n00:00:38.785 --> 00:00:41.686\nIt's a different world when you\nget into the enterprise world.\n\n12\n00:00:41.686 --> 00:00:46.636\nWhen your talking about home users,\nit's pretty common for you to have weaker\n\n13\n00:00:46.636 --> 00:00:50.920\nsecurity, to have shared computers\namongst more than one people.\n\n14\n00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.600\nTo do things like have auto logon, so\n\n15\n00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.340\nthe computer just logs on automatically,\nstuff like that.\n\n16\n00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.600\nAt home that's okay.\n\n17\n00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.870\nBut in a business it's not just a matter\nof one or two people sharing computers,\n\n18\n00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.400\nit's a matter of thousands,\ntens of thousands of people in some cases.\n\n19\n00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.130\nWith thousands of computers or\n\n20\n00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.320\ntens of thousands of computers, it becomes\nquite the administrative difference.\n\n21\n00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.840\nRight?\n\n22\n00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.830\nAnd security amongst your employees\nis very important, and so\n\n23\n00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.420\nyou start taking advantage of the majority\nof the features that Windows has to offer.\n\n24\n00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.190\nRight?\n\n25\n00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.790\nOne of the biggest challenges\nthat a business has is\n\n26\n00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.440\njust managing the user accounts.\n\n27\n00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.390\nYou guys saw in the file and print sharing\nepisodes, where when I wanted to give\n\n28\n00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.270\nJane Doe access to my laptop,\none of the first things I had to do was to\n\n29\n00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.950\ncreate an account for\nJane Doe on my own laptop, right?\n\n30\n00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.530\nWell that was just me and\nher, two laptops, that's it.\n\n31\n00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.300\nBut what if we had a thousand laptops, and\n\n32\n00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.260\nI wanted everybody to have\naccess to a document.\n\n33\n00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.290\nI don't want to create a user account for\nevery employee on my laptop.\n\n34\n00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.470\nBut let's just say I do.\n\n35\n00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.250\nLet's say I'm really dedicated and so\nI go to all 1000 machines in the network,\n\n36\n00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.360\nand I create an account for myself, right?\n\n37\n00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.580\nNow I can start accessing those machines.\n\n38\n00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.270\nWhat if I wanna change my password?\n\n39\n00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.430\nNow I gotta go to all 1000 of them again.\n\n40\n00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.490\nSo in enterprises they'll typically\ndeploy not individual laptops,\n\n41\n00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.790\nlike these individual\nuser accounts like these.\n\n42\n00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.290\nInstead, they'll create a centralized\ndatabase of user accounts.\n\n43\n00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.160\nAnd when you log into a laptop, a desktop,\na mobile phone or whatever, and\n\n44\n00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.910\ngo to access your network resources,\n\n45\n00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.470\nyou're doing it with this\ncentralized user account.\n\n46\n00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.840\nIt makes it a lot easier to administer.\n\n47\n00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.540\nYou create a user account in one place and\nit works everywhere.\n\n48\n00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.270\nAnd it gives us convenience because\nif I wanna change my password,\n\n49\n00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.550\nI just go to that one place and\nI change the password.\n\n50\n00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.060\nAnd now it's changed everywhere.\n\n51\n00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.690\nBecause the account doesn't\nreally exist everywhere.\n\n52\n00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.610\nIt just exists in that\none central database.\n\n53\n00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.780\nNow in Microsoft land,\n\n54\n00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.850\nthat central database is called\na Microsoft Active Directory and\n\n55\n00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:41.910\nit's really pretty cool.\n\n56\n00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.030\nIt's just a database full of users,\npasswords,\n\n57\n00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.970\ntheir group memberships,\nlittle details about the people.\n\n58\n00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.060\nTheir first name, last name, things\nwe need to know about a user account.\n\n59\n00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.200\nThey're all right there\nin the active directory.\n\n60\n00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.190\nSo on a business computer the login\nprocess is a little bit different.\n\n61\n00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.900\nWhen you're talking about a home computer,\n\n62\n00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.260\nthose are typically set up in\nwhat's called a work group.\n\n63\n00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.470\nAnd in a work group, every computer has\nit's own user account database, right?\n\n64\n00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.300\nLet me show you that.\n\n65\n00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.830\nSo here I am on my computer,\nand if I go into my,\n\n66\n00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.030\nwell, there's a few\nways I can go about it.\n\n67\n00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.940\nWe'll do it the old fashioned way.\n\n68\n00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.452\nI'm going to go into my\ncomputer management screen.\n\n69\n00:03:20.452 --> 00:03:22.370\nI'm gonna right click on this PC and\nchoose manage.\n\n70\n00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.070\nAnd inside of the computer\nmanagement screen,\n\n71\n00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.380\nI'm gonna go over here to Local Users and\nGroups, and Users.\n\n72\n00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.456\nHere I can see some user\naccounts that I've got.\n\n73\n00:03:31.456 --> 00:03:37.910\nDon Pezet administrator guest, but\nif I'm actually joined to a domain,\n\n74\n00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.860\nI have not only these accounts here, but\nall the accounts that are in that domain.\n\n75\n00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.520\nInside of a Microsoft Active Directory\nwe collect users into what\n\n76\n00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.070\nare called domains.\n\n77\n00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.570\nYou might have more than one domain,\n\n78\n00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.930\na lot of people just have one, and\nall the user accounts are in there.\n\n79\n00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.010\nSo your computer might\nbe part of a work group,\n\n80\n00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.340\nin which case these\nare the only users you have.\n\n81\n00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.660\nOr you might be part of a domain, where\nyou have these users and a whole lot more.\n\n82\n00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.750\nNow how do I know if I'm in a domain or\nnot?\n\n83\n00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.950\nWell if I go back to my start screen and\nI right click on my computer icon,\n\n84\n00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.150\ninstead of choosing manage,\nI can choose properties, and\n\n85\n00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.040\ninside of properties,\nyou'll actually see it right here.\n\n86\n00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.190\nIt'll tell you whether you're\nin a work group or in a domain.\n\n87\n00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.590\nAnd I can see on mine, I'm in a domain.\n\n88\n00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.230\nIf it says work group colon and then\na name, you know you're in a work group.\n\n89\n00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.600\nAnd your user accounts are just\nright here on your machine.\n\n90\n00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.890\nBut mine says a domain.\n\n91\n00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:35.070\nMy user accounts are in Lab.ITProTV,\nwhat is that?\n\n92\n00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.730\nWell that's an active directory domain.\n\n93\n00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.650\nIf I were to jump over to a server.\n\n94\n00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.190\nSo here's a server on my network,\n\n95\n00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.240\noops, which I just managed\nto lock myself out of.\n\n96\n00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.790\nI can get logged in and in here I have\na tool called active directory users and\n\n97\n00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:48.570\ncomputers.\n\n98\n00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.450\nAnd you don't have to worry\nabout this one for the exam,\n\n99\n00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.400\nI just wanted to show it to you guys for\ncompleteness.\n\n100\n00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.435\nAnd we can go into users and\nyou'll see user accounts in here.\n\n101\n00:04:55.435 --> 00:04:59.700\nRight, and I've got an account here too,\nbut I could create a new account.\n\n102\n00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.600\nSo, I'll just whip up a new\nuser account in here.\n\n103\n00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.210\nWhich will be, Jane Doe.\n\n104\n00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.840\nOkay?\n\n105\n00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.400\nAnd so, I'm gonna just give her\na J Doe account, there we go.\n\n106\n00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.930\nAnd I'll give her a super secure password,\nand I'll set that password not to expire.\n\n107\n00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.830\nAll right, so I just created an account\nfor her in the active directory.\n\n108\n00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.530\nIf I go back to my computer,\n\n109\n00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.400\non my computer she doesn't\nhave an account, all right?\n\n110\n00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.960\nThat account is existing in\nthat centralized user database.\n\n111\n00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.950\nAnd so\nif I go back into my manage screen and\n\n112\n00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.300\nI go to my local users in groups and\nI go into users, there's no Jane Doe.\n\n113\n00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:46.360\nBut I can log out of my system,\nI'll go to switch account and\n\n114\n00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.500\nI can switch to her account.\n\n115\n00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.960\nI can log in as J Doe.\n\n116\n00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.780\nAnd I can put in that password\nthat I just gave her, and\n\n117\n00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.800\nsee how it says sign into ITPROTV Lab?\n\n118\n00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.820\nThat's my active directory.\n\n119\n00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:00.500\nThat's that domain.\n\n120\n00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.950\nI'm going to log into that instead\nof logging into this computer.\n\n121\n00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:08.970\nIf I put a ./ at the beginning,\nsee how it says, sign into Don Pezet PC?\n\n122\n00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.560\nNow it's logging into\na local user account.\n\n123\n00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.020\nJane doesn't have a local user account.\n\n124\n00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.020\nThat won't work.\n\n125\n00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.290\nBut if I chose the domain one and\nhit enter here, its gonna go and\n\n126\n00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.600\nlog in and now I'm logging\ninto that active directory.\n\n127\n00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.285\nI was able to log in to my computer\neven though I didn't have a user\n\n128\n00:06:23.285 --> 00:06:23.870\naccount, right.\n\n129\n00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.020\nJane didn't have an account now she will,\nall right.\n\n130\n00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.410\nNow that's part of what\nan active directory is.\n\n131\n00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.710\nAnd its a great way for\ncompanies to manage their computers.\n\n132\n00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.160\nBy having that central AD for\nauthentication.\n\n133\n00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.010\n>> Now, Don, that's really cool.\n\n134\n00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.430\nLike the active directory, I've worked\nwith active directory pretty extensively.\n\n135\n00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.710\nWhat I know about it is, is that\nthat's basically for my organization.\n\n136\n00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.470\nI have a company,\nI have computers within that company,\n\n137\n00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.590\nthose computers are joined to\nthat active directory domain, and\n\n138\n00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:55.150\nthen they have access to all the cool\nfeatures that active directory offers us.\n\n139\n00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.800\nBut we live in a time now where a lot\nof people, they like to work from home.\n\n140\n00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.670\nThey like to be mobile.\n\n141\n00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.600\nThey don't like to sit in an office, and\n\n142\n00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.615\nit's because of their job roles have\nchanged here in the recent past.\n\n143\n00:07:06.615 --> 00:07:09.335\nAnd people need to have that mobility.\n\n144\n00:07:09.335 --> 00:07:11.105\nOr, they just want to\nbring in their own device.\n\n145\n00:07:11.105 --> 00:07:12.205\nThey just want to have their own computer.\n\n146\n00:07:12.205 --> 00:07:14.085\nThey don't want to be stuck with me.\n\n147\n00:07:14.085 --> 00:07:16.015\nIf they are outside my company,\n\n148\n00:07:16.015 --> 00:07:19.015\neven though they are inside of my company,\nshould I say.\n\n149\n00:07:19.015 --> 00:07:22.335\nHow do I keep them in my organization\n\n150\n00:07:22.335 --> 00:07:25.005\nwhen they are not physically\nconnected to my network?\n\n151\n00:07:25.005 --> 00:07:27.365\n>> That's a great question and\nit's really a timely one.\n\n152\n00:07:27.365 --> 00:07:30.760\nSo, when the active directory was created,\nwhich was really in 2000.\n\n153\n00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.950\nSo it's been around for 15 years.\n\n154\n00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:36.750\nAnd back then,\nif you had employees that used computers,\n\n155\n00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.960\nit was the company that owned\nthose computers, right?\n\n156\n00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.130\nSo everybody that connected to your\nnetwork was using a company owned\n\n157\n00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.060\nmachine that you managed.\n\n158\n00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.990\nAnd so you could create a domain,\nan active directory domain, and you could\n\n159\n00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:51.120\njoin those computers to it, and you\ncould fully manage every aspect of them.\n\n160\n00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.700\nBut it's not like that anymore.\n\n161\n00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.860\nNow people bring their own cell phone,\nthey bring their own laptop.\n\n162\n00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:58.285\nEven if they are company issued machines,\na lot of times they take them home.\n\n163\n00:07:58.285 --> 00:08:00.189\nThey work from home or work on the road.\n\n164\n00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:02.199\nAnd these Active Directory servers,\n\n165\n00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:06.110\nyou're not supposed to expose them\nto the Internet cuz it's dangerous.\n\n166\n00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.470\nIf somebody were to break\ninto your AD server,\n\n167\n00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.732\nthey could have access to\nyour full user database.\n\n168\n00:08:10.732 --> 00:08:11.543\nThat would be bad.\n\n169\n00:08:11.543 --> 00:08:15.939\nSo the Active Directory as a stance was\nreally designed for the older model of\n\n170\n00:08:15.939 --> 00:08:19.940\ncomputing where everything stayed\ninside of your company network.\n\n171\n00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.610\nBut if you're a modern network, if you've\ngot people that are working from home or\n\n172\n00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:26.300\nyou're using Cloud services.\n\n173\n00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:27.411\nHow do you resolve that?\n\n174\n00:08:27.411 --> 00:08:30.140\nAnd there's a few different\nways that we go about it.\n\n175\n00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:31.720\nFirst of, the Active Directory.\n\n176\n00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.780\nMicrosoft is designed\ninside of Microsoft Azure.\n\n177\n00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.862\nWhat's called an Azure AD.\n\n178\n00:08:36.862 --> 00:08:40.560\nAnd Azure AD is where the Active Directory\nis actually hosted in Microsoft Cloud.\n\n179\n00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.860\nAnd they take care of securing that and\nprotecting it from the outside world\n\n180\n00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:47.620\nwhile at the same time, allowing\nyour end users to connect to it and\n\n181\n00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.960\nauthenticate even when\nthey're not at your office.\n\n182\n00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:54.683\nSo somebody might be at home or in a hotel\nor on the other side of the world and\n\n183\n00:08:54.683 --> 00:08:57.519\ncan still log into the AD\nusing the Azure AD.\n\n184\n00:08:57.519 --> 00:09:00.663\nAnd there's a few other services that\nare kind of tacked along with that,\n\n185\n00:09:00.663 --> 00:09:03.350\nthat provide the same basic functionality.\n\n186\n00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:06.310\nWe've seen earlier in the show,\nlike the Microsoft Account?\n\n187\n00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:09.214\nWhere, Microsoft account\nis really just a fancy AD.\n\n188\n00:09:09.214 --> 00:09:10.238\nIt's an AD they host, and so\n\n189\n00:09:10.238 --> 00:09:12.810\nyou're creating a user account\nin their Active Directory.\n\n190\n00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:15.821\nBut for a company,\nyou wanna have your own directory and so\n\n191\n00:09:15.821 --> 00:09:17.552\nthat's where Azure AD comes in.\n\n192\n00:09:17.552 --> 00:09:20.470\nIt's like a Microsoft account\nthat's private to your company.\n\n193\n00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.300\nAnd then we can even\nlink the two together.\n\n194\n00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:29.260\nSo if you used Active Directory\nFederation Services, you can link your AD\n\n195\n00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.910\nwith an Azure AD, so you can have\nboth running simultaneously and\n\n196\n00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:33.420\nyou can synchronize accounts between them.\n\n197\n00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.200\nYou get some real power.\n\n198\n00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:38.910\nI know we've seen a little bit of\nAzure in some of the other episodes.\n\n199\n00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.540\nBut if we wanna see just\nkind of what it looks like,\n\n200\n00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.500\nlet me whip up a connection here.\n\n201\n00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.110\nI'm gonna log into an Azure account.\n\n202\n00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.930\nHere we go.\n\n203\n00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:47.900\nSo this is a Microsoft Azure account and\n\n204\n00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.840\nI'm just kind of logged into the web\nmanagement portal, and you'll see some of\n\n205\n00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:55.190\nthe different things that we can offer\nlike SQL databases, virtual machines.\n\n206\n00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.900\nAnd if I scroll way down here,\nit's kind of down towards the bottom.\n\n207\n00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.810\nWe can find Active Directory.\n\n208\n00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:03.690\nYou can actually create\nan Active Directory in the Cloud.\n\n209\n00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:05.740\nWhere they host all the servers for\nyou and\n\n210\n00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:10.990\nthey make it so people can connect with it\nfrom outside to be able to authenticate.\n\n211\n00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:13.970\nSo I've created one called\nAzure demo before the show.\n\n212\n00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:16.374\nIt's up and it's running,\nand if I go in to it,\n\n213\n00:10:16.374 --> 00:10:18.734\nyou'll see where I can\ncreate user accounts.\n\n214\n00:10:18.734 --> 00:10:22.114\nI can create groups, applications,\nI can define domains,\n\n215\n00:10:22.114 --> 00:10:25.420\nall done right from here\ninside of the Cloud.\n\n216\n00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:29.400\nAnd that does make life a lot easier\nas far as people who are out and\n\n217\n00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.800\nabout and roaming.\n\n218\n00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.120\nAnd if I go to my dashboard here,\n\n219\n00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.110\nyou can see it's basically telling me\nhow many accounts and stuff I have.\n\n220\n00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:36.660\nI don't have a lot.\n\n221\n00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:37.750\nBut basically,\n\n222\n00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.500\nyou'll see information here where you\ncan do things like tenant branding and\n\n223\n00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.700\nself service portals where you can make it\nwhere people can connect and manage these.\n\n224\n00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:49.310\nSo having that hosted out in the cloud\nthat really makes life a heck\n\n225\n00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:53.310\nof a lot easier because now that\nAD is a little more widespread.\n\n226\n00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.590\nNow that works out great but again,\n\n227\n00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.890\nwe're kind of assuming these\nare computers we manage.\n\n228\n00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:02.470\nThe computers might be outside\nof our physical building but\n\n229\n00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:06.170\nat least they still work, they can connect\nup and things kind of work fine there.\n\n230\n00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:07.092\nWe've got our authentication.\n\n231\n00:11:07.092 --> 00:11:09.606\n>> Yeah Don, but the world has changed,\n\n232\n00:11:09.606 --> 00:11:13.890\nlike I was saying we're living in that\nBYOD, bring your own device environment.\n\n233\n00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:17.460\nEverybody, you said it even they wanna\nbring their cellphone they wanna\n\n234\n00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.090\nbring their own computer.\n\n235\n00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:21.240\nThey don't want to own it\nbecause it's their and\n\n236\n00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.620\nyou can't tell them what to do with it.\n\n237\n00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:26.120\nI've dealt with these users trust\nme I know all about this, but\n\n238\n00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:30.360\nwe have to have them coexist with\nus inside of our environment.\n\n239\n00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.910\nSo it really comes down\nto how do we do that?\n\n240\n00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:37.279\nHow do we coexist with out BYOD\nbrethren inside our organization?\n\n241\n00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.670\n>> Now the biggest problem here, so most\ncompanies would look at this as a very,\n\n242\n00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:43.980\nvery positive thing.\n\n243\n00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.660\nIn the past, if I had 100 employees\nI had to buy 100 computers, right?\n\n244\n00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:49.380\nI need to give them computers.\n\n245\n00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:50.840\nBut now my employees are coming to me and\n\n246\n00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:55.230\nsaying, hey, I wanna use my own laptop,\nI wanna use my own cell phone.\n\n247\n00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:56.157\nThe employees wanna pay for\ntheir own equipment?\n\n248\n00:11:56.157 --> 00:11:56.967\nGreat.\n\n249\n00:11:56.967 --> 00:11:57.794\nLet's do that.\n\n250\n00:11:57.794 --> 00:11:59.045\nWonderful.\n\n251\n00:11:59.045 --> 00:12:01.800\nYou'd think it's a good thing,\nbut here's the risks.\n\n252\n00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.310\nWhen we have company issued computers,\nwe know they're set up right.\n\n253\n00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:08.000\nMaybe we force BitLocker to be enabled and\n\n254\n00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.680\nwe're setting IP sec or\nconfiguring VPN systems.\n\n255\n00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:14.200\nWe know it's nice and secure and\nset to our standards.\n\n256\n00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.210\nBut when they bring their own laptop,\nhow's it set up?\n\n257\n00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:18.671\nProbably not very well.\n\n258\n00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:21.415\nThey probably bought it\nat some office store and\n\n259\n00:12:21.415 --> 00:12:25.180\nit's still got all the Bloatware\nthat the vendor puts on it.\n\n260\n00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.120\nAnd they've been browsing the Internet and\nwho knows what's on there.\n\n261\n00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.900\nYou can't trust these computers\ncuz they're not IT people.\n\n262\n00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:34.880\nThey're not in the know to make sure\nthose computers are secure and safe.\n\n263\n00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.352\nBut they wanna bring it into\nyour business and use it.\n\n264\n00:12:37.352 --> 00:12:38.800\nThey wanna take your business data and\n\n265\n00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.760\nput it on this machine that you don't\nnecessarily trust, that's a risk.\n\n266\n00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.670\nSo Microsoft has come up with several\nsolutions to that, several ways\n\n267\n00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:50.590\nto make it where your data can be safe\neven though it's on an untrusted machine.\n\n268\n00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.350\nOne of the first examples I wanna\nshow you now, I'll show you four or\n\n269\n00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:55.630\nfive different ways you can do it, but\n\n270\n00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:58.970\none way is to use what's called\nthe Microsoft Company Portal.\n\n271\n00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:04.453\nMicrosoft released a special Windows App,\nit's in the Windows Store.\n\n272\n00:13:04.453 --> 00:13:06.040\nHere, I'll show you on this machine.\n\n273\n00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.500\nSo I'm in Windows 8, and\n\n274\n00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:12.530\nif I fire up my Windows Store,\nI can search for Company Portal.\n\n275\n00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:13.030\nThere you go.\n\n276\n00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:20.350\nAnd what the company portal does, is it\nallows you to go into Microsoft Azure,\n\n277\n00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:24.870\ncreate an Active Directory,\npublish applications, programs that people\n\n278\n00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:30.280\nare gonna be using for work right\nthere into the Azure environment.\n\n279\n00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:34.410\nAnd then, if you hire a new employee and\nthey bring their own computer, you can\n\n280\n00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:37.280\nsay, okay, I need you to go to the Windows\nstore and install the company portal.\n\n281\n00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:37.950\nIt's free.\n\n282\n00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:39.050\nInstall it.\n\n283\n00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:45.050\nAnd they install it, and when they\nlog in with their Azure AD account,\n\n284\n00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:47.280\nthey'll see a screen that looks like this.\n\n285\n00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.740\nThey'll see your company and\n\n286\n00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:53.150\na list of apps that\nare specifically approved by you.\n\n287\n00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:56.800\nThese are the apps approved by your\ncompany that they can install and\n\n288\n00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.170\nthey're tied to your company.\n\n289\n00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.675\nWhen they install them,\nyou can secure them.\n\n290\n00:14:00.675 --> 00:14:03.299\nYou can configure those settings for\nthose applications.\n\n291\n00:14:03.299 --> 00:14:06.998\nSo now, you can deploy a program to\ntheir system and know that it's safe and\n\n292\n00:14:06.998 --> 00:14:09.590\nknow that it's being kept up to date.\n\n293\n00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:11.760\nThe company portal provides\nthat functionality,\n\n294\n00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:16.260\ngives them kind of like a, it's almost\nlike a private label App Store.\n\n295\n00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.350\nYou fire this up and\nit's your company's App Store.\n\n296\n00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:19.870\nEverything in here would be free.\n\n297\n00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:21.308\nThey'd login and they get the app.\n\n298\n00:14:21.308 --> 00:14:23.320\nAnd then they throw them in,\nand they're in business.\n\n299\n00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.060\nAnd they can even see their\ndevices that they're managing.\n\n300\n00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:29.840\nAnd if they lose their device,\nwe can wipe the device.\n\n301\n00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.250\nNow by wipe it I mean,\nremove the company apps.\n\n302\n00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:34.960\nIt can actually reach out and\nremove the company apps from the system so\n\n303\n00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:35.960\nthat their not present anymore.\n\n304\n00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.880\nSo if you terminated an employee and\n\n305\n00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:41.110\ntheir personal laptop is at home which\nis full within the rights to do.\n\n306\n00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:43.280\nYou can still reach out and\nyank your apps off of it.\n\n307\n00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.300\nThat's the kind of power that\nthe Company Portal gives you.\n\n308\n00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:49.340\nAnd it's pretty cool when you get it set\nup and running, it's a neat utility.\n\n309\n00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:52.148\nIt's available as part\nof Microsoft Azure and\n\n310\n00:14:52.148 --> 00:14:55.461\npart of Windows Intune,\nit kind of ties into that too.\n\n311\n00:14:55.461 --> 00:14:57.280\nWe'll see other solutions.\n\n312\n00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.860\nWork folders.\n\n313\n00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.330\nI like work folders.\n\n314\n00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.970\nCompany Portal's great, but\nit does require Azure and Intune, and\n\n315\n00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:07.220\nthere's a lot of stuff you have\nto kind of set up for that.\n\n316\n00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.020\nIf you don't wanna put\nanything in the Cloud,\n\n317\n00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:12.270\nif you want to manage it yourself,\nwork folders are another solution.\n\n318\n00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:15.800\nNormally, the applications\naren't what we worry about.\n\n319\n00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.470\nIf I've got Microsoft Office\ninstalled on a machine and\n\n320\n00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.500\nsomebody steals that machine.\n\n321\n00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.510\nWell, it stinks that I\nlost the machine but\n\n322\n00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:24.560\nI don't really care that I lost Office.\n\n323\n00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.195\nI still have my license, I can install\nit on another machine, it's no big deal.\n\n324\n00:15:27.195 --> 00:15:30.040\nIt's really the documents\nthat I care about.\n\n325\n00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.860\nIf I have company documents\non the machine and\n\n326\n00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.900\nsomebody steals it, I don't want them\ngetting access to the company documents.\n\n327\n00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:38.950\nSo what we can do is we can set\nup what are called work folders.\n\n328\n00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:41.658\nSomebody can take their\nown personal machine and\n\n329\n00:15:41.658 --> 00:15:43.844\nconnect to servers back at our office.\n\n330\n00:15:43.844 --> 00:15:49.454\nAnd it can create and encrypted tunnel\nto synchronize those documents down and\n\n331\n00:15:49.454 --> 00:15:54.129\nstore them in a protected location\nright here on their machine and\n\n332\n00:15:54.129 --> 00:15:58.464\nthat way, if somebody gets a hold\nof the machine those data,\n\n333\n00:15:58.464 --> 00:16:02.733\nthat data is secure and\nfrom the server I can remote wipe it.\n\n334\n00:16:02.733 --> 00:16:05.051\nI can say, delete those off that\nmachine and pull them off and\n\n335\n00:16:05.051 --> 00:16:05.928\nget them out of there.\n\n336\n00:16:05.928 --> 00:16:07.147\nAnd it's just a folder.\n\n337\n00:16:07.147 --> 00:16:09.689\nWe're not talking about applications here.\n\n338\n00:16:09.689 --> 00:16:10.768\nJust the documents.\n\n339\n00:16:10.768 --> 00:16:11.651\nIt's built into Windows 8.\n\n340\n00:16:11.651 --> 00:16:13.150\nIt's not built into Windows 7.\n\n341\n00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:15.770\nIn Windows 7, you have to download\nthe work folder client and install.\n\n342\n00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:18.110\nYou can get it right off\nof Microsoft's website.\n\n343\n00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:19.970\nBut for Windows 8 it's built in.\n\n344\n00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:24.690\nIf you just bring up your start screen and\njust type in work folders.\n\n345\n00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:28.390\nOr if you want to go about it the right\nway you go into your control panel.\n\n346\n00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:29.970\nI'll show you guys the full way.\n\n347\n00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:31.690\nWe can go into the control panel.\n\n348\n00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:34.890\nAnd in the Control Panel,\nit's under System and Security.\n\n349\n00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:39.990\nAnd when you go in there and scroll down,\nyou'll find Work Folders, right there.\n\n350\n00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:42.590\nAnd so with work folders,\nif you don't have any like me,\n\n351\n00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:45.940\nyou just see Set up Work Folders,\nit's not terribly exciting.\n\n352\n00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:50.570\nBut if I click on that, it's gonna give\nme the option to provide my email address\n\n353\n00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:52.970\nThat's tied to my company account.\n\n354\n00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:56.400\nAnd it can use that to find\nmy server that's out there.\n\n355\n00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.070\nAnd it doesn't matter if I'm at home or\nthe hotel, or\n\n356\n00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:02.100\nsomewhere else it's going to reach out and\nit's going to find that server so\n\n357\n00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.450\nI can connect and get my folders.\n\n358\n00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.560\nInstead of punching in e-mail\nbecause I'm a private lab.\n\n359\n00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.840\nSo it can't do the lookup thing\nseeing it's Microsoft server.\n\n360\n00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.580\nI'm going to do a specific URL instead so\n\n361\n00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:15.650\nI can point it at my\nserver right over here.\n\n362\n00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:17.640\nSo let me just point it at my lab server.\n\n363\n00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.930\nAnd, in real life\nthe e-mail address is easy,\n\n364\n00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:22.690\nevery user knows their e-mail address.\n\n365\n00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:27.050\nUsers don't normally know the URL to point\nto a server, so this is not the way we\n\n366\n00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:29.720\nnormally want to do it, but they'll punch\nin their e-mail and they'll find it.\n\n367\n00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.760\nI'm going to hit next, it's going to reach\nout and hit that server, and there it is.\n\n368\n00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:36.960\nAnd so now it's giving me the option\nto sync down my work folders.\n\n369\n00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:40.068\nAnd I'm just gonna put them on my desktop\nso they're a little easier to find.\n\n370\n00:17:40.068 --> 00:17:46.900\nJust gonna screw this up all over here.\n\n371\n00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:47.910\nThere we go.\n\n372\n00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:49.180\nI'm gonna create work folders.\n\n373\n00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:53.240\nThere we go, that's the one that I want.\n\n374\n00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:53.870\nOkay.\n\n375\n00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:57.480\nSo it's gonna put it right there,\nand I'll hit Next, and\n\n376\n00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.930\nit's gonna reach out and do it now.\n\n377\n00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:00.450\nNotice what it's asking me here.\n\n378\n00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:02.010\nTo help protect your work files,\n\n379\n00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:05.550\nyour organization can make the following\nchanges on your PC at any time.\n\n380\n00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:08.090\nI'm giving up some control to my PC.\n\n381\n00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:11.940\nIt says my company can choose to\nencrypt the work folders if they want.\n\n382\n00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.370\nMy company can require\na password on this PC.\n\n383\n00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:16.780\nSo if I'm set to auto log in or\n\n384\n00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:19.250\nno password,\nthey can force me to have a password.\n\n385\n00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:21.340\nThey can automatically lock my screen.\n\n386\n00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:24.810\nThey can erase all files\nin the work folder.\n\n387\n00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:27.750\nNot the files on the rest of the computer,\nit's your computer.\n\n388\n00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:29.620\nBut the work folder, they can erase.\n\n389\n00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:32.580\nSo they have control over the work folder.\n\n390\n00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:35.150\nThat way a company can maintain and\n\n391\n00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:38.710\ncontrol those documents even though\nit's on a machine that's not theirs.\n\n392\n00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:40.930\n>> Don, this is normally\nwhere I get my users going,\n\n393\n00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:43.400\nyou mean you're going to take\ncontrol over my computer and\n\n394\n00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.630\nyou're going to wipe things out and\nyou're going to lock things down.\n\n395\n00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:49.660\nAnd I have to explain to them at that\npoint we're not just going to have fun,\n\n396\n00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:53.350\nand say, hey,\nlet's wipe out Jane Doe's entire computer.\n\n397\n00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:55.150\nA, we don't have that kind of control.\n\n398\n00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:57.401\nB, we're not going to do that for\njust the heck of it.\n\n399\n00:18:57.401 --> 00:19:01.385\nC, we do have our company\nstuff on your computer for\n\n400\n00:19:01.385 --> 00:19:05.380\nhaving to compromise a little\nbit with each other.\n\n401\n00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:06.980\nYou get to have your own things, but\n\n402\n00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.570\nwe get a little bit of\ncontrol over what is ours.\n\n403\n00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:10.410\nSo, at this point it'll,\n\n404\n00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:14.420\nlot of times you have assuage\ntheir fears of the big bad IT man.\n\n405\n00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:15.630\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n406\n00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:17.700\nSo, I'm going to go ahead and\nchoose to set up the work folders,\n\n407\n00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.130\ncause what do I care,\nthey can take control of mine.\n\n408\n00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:20.860\n>> Do it, Don.\n\n409\n00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:21.500\nDo it, Don.\n[LAUGH]\n\n410\n00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:22.520\n>> When you're the admin,\n\n411\n00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.890\nyou don't necessarily worry about\ncontrolling your own machine.\n\n412\n00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:25.500\nBut there you go.\n\n413\n00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.180\nSo now it's going to set up and\nstart syncing that data.\n\n414\n00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:32.646\nThe neat part about this is it's\nreaching out to the company servers and\n\n415\n00:19:32.646 --> 00:19:34.375\nsyncing my data.\n\n416\n00:19:34.375 --> 00:19:35.805\nAnd here's some work\ndata already coming down.\n\n417\n00:19:35.805 --> 00:19:37.075\nI get this Report.txt.\n\n418\n00:19:37.075 --> 00:19:39.345\nThis was an empty folder just\na second ago, and now it's got data.\n\n419\n00:19:39.345 --> 00:19:41.485\nIt's synchronizing it from my server.\n\n420\n00:19:41.485 --> 00:19:42.845\nAnd I can do this on\nmore than one machine.\n\n421\n00:19:42.845 --> 00:19:45.010\nI might have a laptop and a tablet.\n\n422\n00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:48.180\nThey make the Work Folders client for\niPad, it's for all sorts of stuff.\n\n423\n00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.540\nAnd you can sync it down,\nand there's all your data.\n\n424\n00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.830\nAnd you work with it here in this nice,\nsafe, little compartment,\n\n425\n00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:54.500\nuse whatever apps you want.\n\n426\n00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.170\nAnd as long as you're saving it here,\nit's nice and secure.\n\n427\n00:19:57.170 --> 00:20:00.070\nAnd it can be encrypted,\nit can be remote wiped.\n\n428\n00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:01.940\nIt's nice and secure.\n\n429\n00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:04.000\nYou're company has the safety\nof their documents and\n\n430\n00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.920\nyou have the freedom to\nuse your own computers.\n\n431\n00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:06.660\nThose are work folders,\n\n432\n00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:10.690\nreally cool technology and\non the client side super easy to set up.\n\n433\n00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:13.800\nNow I'll tell you guys before the show\nit's a lot of work to get the server set\n\n434\n00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.180\nup, but I did that part.\n\n435\n00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:16.880\nBut the client side, it's pretty easy.\n\n436\n00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:19.670\nAll right, let's see.\n\n437\n00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:20.350\nWhat else do we have?\n\n438\n00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:21.840\n>> I think a little bit of Azure.\n\n439\n00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.250\nI think they allow us to do\nsome of this stuff, right Don?\n\n440\n00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:26.870\n>> They do, and\nthey even take it a step further, right?\n\n441\n00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:29.160\nSo here I just did documents, all right?\n\n442\n00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.910\nAnd that was it.\nBut what if I want apps too, right?\n\n443\n00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:34.860\nI wanna give apps to my clients.\n\n444\n00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:39.080\nWell one of the challenges you have with\napps, first off there's pirating software.\n\n445\n00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.380\nSo, if I install Microsoft Office\non my end user's computers,\n\n446\n00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.270\ncould they potentially pirate that out?\n\n447\n00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:45.940\nCould my license keys get out?\n\n448\n00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:46.660\nIt is possible.\n\n449\n00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:52.030\nAnother thing is, it can be notoriously\ndifficult to update remote computers.\n\n450\n00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:54.140\nSo, maybe an update comes out for\nOffice and\n\n451\n00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:56.340\nsome of my users are just\nchoosing not to apply it.\n\n452\n00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.040\nHow do I keep that in gear?\n\n453\n00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.110\nOn a company managed machine it's easy but\n\n454\n00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:02.820\nif it's their own computer,\nhow to do that, right?\n\n455\n00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:05.160\nAnd how do I make sure that\nI'm obeying my license limit,\n\n456\n00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.330\nthat I haven't issued more copies of\nthe software than I actually have?\n\n457\n00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:11.840\nThat stuff is really challenging when\nyou don't control the computers.\n\n458\n00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:15.780\nSo in Azure we have a neat\nsystem called Azure Remote App.\n\n459\n00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:20.830\nAzure Remote App Lets you\nrun an application and for\n\n460\n00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:23.820\nthe end user it looks like\nit's running on their machine.\n\n461\n00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:29.140\nBut in reality it's running the app from\na server hosted up in the Azure cloud.\n\n462\n00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:32.040\nThe end user doesn't even\nreally know the difference\n\n463\n00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:35.300\nit just looks like a normal app, but in\nreality it's running off of your servers.\n\n464\n00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:38.510\nThe cool part there If you need to\nupdate that app, you just go and\n\n465\n00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:41.440\nupdate it in the cloud, and\nnow it's updated for all of your clients.\n\n466\n00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:45.290\nIf you have five clients or 5,000 clients,\nit's updated for all of them at once.\n\n467\n00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:48.580\nThe other thing, is if you know you don't\nwant someone to have access to an app\n\n468\n00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.170\nyou just turn off their access,\nand then it's done.\n\n469\n00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:53.210\nSo you can quickly remove app.\n\n470\n00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:54.610\nSo if a laptop gets stolen, or\n\n471\n00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:58.040\nwhatever, you just disable that\nuser account, problem solved.\n\n472\n00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.810\nNo big deal there, because the app\ndoesn't actually run from their machine.\n\n473\n00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:01.580\nAll right.\n\n474\n00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:03.570\nLet me show you an example.\n\n475\n00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:07.350\nHere I am on my Windows 8 machine,\nand if I fire up my start menu,\n\n476\n00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:09.160\nI want to run Microsoft Excel.\n\n477\n00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.910\nOkay, so\nI'm just gonna do a search for Excel.\n\n478\n00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:14.490\nI don't have Excel, well shoot.\n\n479\n00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:16.000\nWell now I can call the helpdesk and say,\n\n480\n00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.580\nhey can you guys install\nExcel on my machine?\n\n481\n00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.820\nAnd they say,\nno way that's your private machine,\n\n482\n00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:22.540\nwe're not installing Excel on there.\n\n483\n00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:23.580\nWhat if you quit tomorrow?\n\n484\n00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:24.890\nI don't want to give me a free Office.\n\n485\n00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:26.140\nThat's not gonna happen, right?\n\n486\n00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:27.710\nSo, they're not gonna do that.\n\n487\n00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:32.020\nBut what Azure Remote app, they can say,\nhere I just added to your account.\n\n488\n00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.120\nFire up Remote App and you'll have it.\n\n489\n00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.950\nAll right, that's what they can do.\n\n490\n00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:39.380\nSo I don't have Excel Other apps,\nlike I'll take Microsoft Paint.\n\n491\n00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:40.900\nI'm gonna run Microsoft Paint.\n\n492\n00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:42.090\nI'm running it right here local.\n\n493\n00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:43.040\nI fire it up.\n\n494\n00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.210\nI can click on my pencil.\n\n495\n00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:45.230\nI can draw some stuff.\n\n496\n00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:47.170\n>> Critical business application.\n\n497\n00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:47.960\n>> Absolutely.\n\n498\n00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:48.880\n>> Must have.\n\n499\n00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.490\n>> Some amazing work's\nbeen done on this thing.\n\n500\n00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:51.450\nSo there we go.\n\n501\n00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:52.710\nI've got it.\nIt's running.\n\n502\n00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:54.550\nAnd it's running right here,\nand it's running on my machine.\n\n503\n00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:56.750\nThat's the experience\nan end user normally has,\n\n504\n00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:59.460\nthat's what we'd expect\nto see with a local app.\n\n505\n00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:00.460\nAll right?\n\n506\n00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:05.040\nBut with Azure remote app,\nit's actually really pretty much the same.\n\n507\n00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.910\nSo, I installed the Azure remote\napp client which is for you,\n\n508\n00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:10.340\nyou install it from Microsoft's website.\n\n509\n00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:14.570\nAnd, apparently I'm going to\nhave to use my free trial.\n\n510\n00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:16.680\nSo, I'm signed in to my company.\n\n511\n00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:20.250\nAnd here's Office 2013 and\nMicrosoft Paint.\n\n512\n00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:23.960\nI don't have Excel on my own laptop,\nwe saw that just a second ago.\n\n513\n00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:28.330\nBut I can run Excel right here, and it's\ngonna reach out to the Azure server and,\n\n514\n00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:30.405\nyou know I should have launched\nthis at least once before the show.\n\n515\n00:23:30.405 --> 00:23:33.655\nThe first time you run it it does take\na second to connect here as it builds this\n\n516\n00:23:33.655 --> 00:23:38.485\ninitial cache, but from now on when you\nrun it it just runs near instantaneous.\n\n517\n00:23:38.485 --> 00:23:41.820\nAnd then when it runs, here's Excel.\n\n518\n00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.950\nAnd I can get in here and\nI can start working with this system.\n\n519\n00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:49.920\nAnd for me,\nas a local user versus a remote user,\n\n520\n00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:53.410\nit's really the same experience.\n\n521\n00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:56.040\nI see it down here on my task\nbar with the Excel icon.\n\n522\n00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:00.278\nIf I alt tab between things,\nI see Excel with a proper thumbnail.\n\n523\n00:24:00.278 --> 00:24:04.796\nTo an end user, they don't know\nwhether this is local or remote.\n\n524\n00:24:04.796 --> 00:24:07.061\nIt looks local.\n\n525\n00:24:07.061 --> 00:24:08.655\nThey're running Office or\n\n526\n00:24:08.655 --> 00:24:13.420\nExcel 2013 with my company license\non their own personal machine.\n\n527\n00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:20.650\nOr there's the Azure Remote App Client for\nAndroid, for Mac, for iOS.\n\n528\n00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:22.620\nSo I can be on my iPad and\n\n529\n00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:26.930\nrun the full Microsoft Excel 2013\non the iPad if you wanted, right?\n\n530\n00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:29.810\nAnd you install right there\nthrough Azure RemoteApp, so\n\n531\n00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:31.310\nthis one can fire up and work.\n\n532\n00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:33.775\nAnd when I'm done with it,\nI can close it, and\n\n533\n00:24:33.775 --> 00:24:38.500\nit's gonna close, and it close down and\nI just go right back like normal, okay?\n\n534\n00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.750\nAnd it asked me to review it,\nso [LAUGH] there we go.\n\n535\n00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:42.930\nThe review thing is cuz I'm in a demo.\n\n536\n00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:45.870\nBut if I launch Paint,\nwe saw Paint a moment a ago, right?\n\n537\n00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:47.640\nAnd what my local experience was like.\n\n538\n00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.060\nWell, when I run Paint here,\n\n539\n00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:53.310\nit's gonna fire up and it's gonna give\nme a nice little free document here.\n\n540\n00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:56.880\nBut if I create some kind of new document\nthere, I can go in with my Pencil and\n\n541\n00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.295\nI can start drawing just\nlike I did a second ago.\n\n542\n00:24:59.295 --> 00:25:01.400\nSorry, I'm trying to\ndraw with my mouse and\n\n543\n00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.140\nit's the same experience as\nif I was running it locally.\n\n544\n00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:06.031\nAnd if I go to save this, right?\n\n545\n00:25:06.031 --> 00:25:11.590\nSo I'm gonna save my document,\nit's saving right here to my own PC.\n\n546\n00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:13.620\nI don't see that this is running\non a service somewhere else,\n\n547\n00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:15.720\nI see it's saving right\nhere to my own system.\n\n548\n00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:20.680\nSo I can go in and find My Pictures folder\nand save this beautiful drawing that\n\n549\n00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:22.973\nI've done right in here and [INAUDIBLE]\n>> [INAUDIBLE] that your desktop\n\n550\n00:25:22.973 --> 00:25:24.019\nbackground right there, Don.\n\n551\n00:25:24.019 --> 00:25:25.430\n>> Yeah, it's neat.\n\n552\n00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:27.870\nAn end user won't notice the difference,\nan admin will.\n\n553\n00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:32.575\nIf you bring up your Task Manager, in the\nTask Manager, see how Paint isn't running,\n\n554\n00:25:32.575 --> 00:25:34.920\nbut Azure RemoteApp is, right?\n\n555\n00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.420\nSo I know it's running somewhere,\n\n556\n00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:39.270\nit's just not running here\non this machine, okay?\n\n557\n00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:41.869\nAnd when I close this Paint window and\nit goes away,\n\n558\n00:25:41.869 --> 00:25:45.370\nwe'll see Azure RemoteApp disappears,\nright?\n\n559\n00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:48.254\nSo basically it's just a really cool\nway to get these apps out, now,\n\n560\n00:25:48.254 --> 00:25:50.340\nhere I showed it with Microsoft Office.\n\n561\n00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:55.550\nIt's not just Microsoft stuff, maybe\nwork at a hospital and you use Epic or\n\n562\n00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:58.690\nyou work at a school and\nyou use PeopleSoft or SAP.\n\n563\n00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:01.720\nAll those different programs\nthat are super complex and\n\n564\n00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.310\nreally difficult to manage.\n\n565\n00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:04.980\nWhat's the big insurance one?\n\n566\n00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:05.670\nImageRight.\n\n567\n00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:06.230\n>> Image right.\n\n568\n00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:07.966\nYeah.\n>> You're pushing those clients out,\n\n569\n00:26:07.966 --> 00:26:10.190\nthat's a lot of stuff to\nkind of get pushed out.\n\n570\n00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:12.360\nWell, instead of pushing it out,\njust run it on a server.\n\n571\n00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:15.436\nRun it on a server in Azure, it's in\nthe cloud, people can then run it and\n\n572\n00:26:15.436 --> 00:26:17.870\nthey think it's local and\nit's actually on the server.\n\n573\n00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:18.840\nThat's remote app.\n\n574\n00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.960\nGreat way for a company to control apps,\n\n575\n00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.540\neven though they are not on\nmachines that are company issue.\n\n576\n00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:27.060\n>> Yeah, that is definitely one of the\ncoolest pieces of software I've seen come\n\n577\n00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:28.860\nout of Microsoft in quite some time.\n\n578\n00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:33.470\nVery, very amazing to be able to say, hey,\nthis looks just like if I were sitting at\n\n579\n00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:37.220\nmy own desk, had that software\ninstalled and running it no difference.\n\n580\n00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:40.010\nLike you said,\nthat end users never gonna know\n\n581\n00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:43.500\nother than the fact of how do they\nactually get into the application itself.\n\n582\n00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.890\nThey're no longer going to start,\nthey can go into Excel,\n\n583\n00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:49.720\njust open that Azure RemoteApp up and\nhit Excel and you're off to the races.\n\n584\n00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.570\nVery cool stuff Don.\n\n585\n00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:55.040\n>> All right well, Daniel I haven't\ngotten through all the stuff that I wanna\n\n586\n00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.180\nget through, I've got a few more things.\n\n587\n00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:56.711\n>> We have more?\n>> But\n\n588\n00:26:56.711 --> 00:26:58.097\nI know we're a little short on time, so\n\n589\n00:26:58.097 --> 00:26:59.789\nmaybe we'll break this\none off into a part two.\n\n590\n00:26:59.789 --> 00:27:03.890\nCuz I want to talk about how we can create\nabsolute partitions between a person's\n\n591\n00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:07.380\ncomputer and their work machine and\na few other little things.\n\n592\n00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:10.140\nWhich are good to know, so\nwe definitely wanna tackle this.\n\n593\n00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:11.140\n>> Well all right.\nWell awesome,\n\n594\n00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:13.690\nhopefully we'll see you guys\nthere on that part two.\n\n595\n00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:15.750\nAs for this episode, thanks for watching.\n\n596\n00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.830\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n597\n00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:19.400\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n598\n00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.246\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n599\n00:27:20.246 --> 00:27:24.527\n[SOUND]\n\n",

exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.830\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n5\n00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.080\nHere with me, as usual, is Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n6\n00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.920\nWhat's going on today, Don?\n\n7\n00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.610\n>> Well, we've got another\nexciting episode ahead of us.\n\n8\n00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.850\nWe're gonna be wrapping up our\nEnterprise Mobility that we talked about\n\n9\n00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:27.852\nin our last episode.\n\n10\n00:00:27.852 --> 00:00:30.740\nI was talking about some of the different\n\n11\n00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.140\ntools of the trade that\nare available to businesses and\n\n12\n00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.520\nenterprises, that are trying to manage\ntheir software and their documents,\n\n13\n00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.750\nthat might be present on somebody doing\nthe old bring your own device, right?\n\n14\n00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.623\nSo somebody brings their own laptop,\ntheir own tablet, their own cellphone,\n\n15\n00:00:45.623 --> 00:00:46.440\ninto your business.\n\n16\n00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.530\nIt's one of your employees, and\nthey wanna use their own equipment.\n\n17\n00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.095\nIt'd be nice to empower them to do that,\nso\n\n18\n00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:53.180\nthen we don't have to buy them\nequipment ourselves, right?\n\n19\n00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.800\nIt can save the company money.\n\n20\n00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.360\nBut there's a lot of administrative\nhassle to it, right?\n\n21\n00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.800\nWe've gotta make sure that our\ndocuments are handled securely,\n\n22\n00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.980\nthat our data is safe,\nthat our application licenses are safe.\n\n23\n00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.130\nSo, in the last episode,\nwe hit on a few different tools for that.\n\n24\n00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:06.819\nWe're gonna continue on with it here,\nall right?\n\n25\n00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.740\nNow in the last episode I focused\nmore on how you can see your actual\n\n26\n00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.560\ndata right there on top\nof the client's machine.\n\n27\n00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.140\nBut what if I want a truly\nseparate partition?\n\n28\n00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.900\nI want a person to, basically,\nhave a work computer and\n\n29\n00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.420\na personal computer,\non the same piece of hardware, okay?\n\n30\n00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.880\nWell, I've got one piece of\nhardware right here in front of me.\n\n31\n00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.872\nThere's one laptop, and maybe it's my\npersonal one that I bring from home, but\n\n32\n00:01:32.872 --> 00:01:34.940\nI wanna do business\napplications on here too, and\n\n33\n00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.740\nI wanna keep them completely separate.\n\n34\n00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.380\nWell, a great solution for\nthat is a client side hypervisor.\n\n35\n00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.950\nAll right,\nnow what's a client side hypervisor?\n\n36\n00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:44.652\n>> How do you spell that Don?\n\n37\n00:01:44.652 --> 00:01:45.590\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's one\n\n38\n00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.370\nof the crazier terms we'll throw out.\n\n39\n00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.500\nIt's virtualization for your desktop.\n\n40\n00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.380\nWe can actually run more than one\noperating system, simultaneously,\n\n41\n00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.830\non the same piece of hardware.\n\n42\n00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.530\nI liken it to carpooling, right?\n\n43\n00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.270\nWhen you carpool, you have two people\nsharing a car to go to a destination.\n\n44\n00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.180\nWell, with virtualization,\n\n45\n00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.140\nyou have two operating systems,\nsharing your hardware, right?\n\n46\n00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.560\nMost of us have more\nhardware than we need.\n\n47\n00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.870\nWe have extra hard drive space,\nwe have extra RAM, we have extra CPU,\n\n48\n00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.590\nthat's just sitting there and\ngoing to waste, so\n\n49\n00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.500\nyou can afford to run a second computer\non top of your first one, right?\n\n50\n00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.670\nNow, the nice part about this is that\nyou can have a business computer,\n\n51\n00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.290\nthat's separate from your\npersonal computer, all right?\n\n52\n00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.180\nAnd Hyper-V lets you do that.\n\n53\n00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.910\nLet me just kinda give you\na quick demonstration.\n\n54\n00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.800\nIf you wanna see how to deploy Hyper-V,\nand do all the craziness for it,\n\n55\n00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.405\ndefinitely check out our MCSA show.\n\n56\n00:02:34.405 --> 00:02:39.420\nBut as a quick run through here, if we\ninstall Hyper-V on, and you can do this\n\n57\n00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.810\non Windows 8 Pro, you can do it on\nWindows 10, Windows 7 Pro has it also.\n\n58\n00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.270\nSo it's on several of the different\nclient operating systems.\n\n59\n00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.500\nThat you can install Hyper-V,\n\n60\n00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.580\nand once you're in here,\nyou can start to create virtual machines.\n\n61\n00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.130\nAnd so, we can just whip up a quick\nvirtual machine on this system.\n\n62\n00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.500\nA virtual machine is basically\na virtual set of hardware.\n\n63\n00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.330\nIts memory, its CPU, its hard drive space,\nbut it's all virtual.\n\n64\n00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.020\nIt's not your real memory.\n\n65\n00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.860\nIt's not your real hard drive.\n\n66\n00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.780\nIt's being laid on top of your\nexisting hardware, all right?\n\n67\n00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.780\nSo I might create a virtual machine\nhere called my work computer, all right?\n\n68\n00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.790\nAnd I can store it on this hard drive or\na separate hard drive if I have one.\n\n69\n00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.480\nI'll just leave it with the defaults.\n\n70\n00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.170\nAnd I'll go generation two on this one.\n\n71\n00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.890\nGeneration one and generation two, that\njust has to do with how much memory you\n\n72\n00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.880\ncan address, how big the virtual hard\ndrives can be, things like that.\n\n73\n00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.040\nFor the sake of this exam,\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n74\n00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.050\nThis does matter.\n\n75\n00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.170\nHow much memory, right?\n\n76\n00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.642\nHow much memory am I going\nto grant to this machine?\n\n77\n00:03:40.642 --> 00:03:44.230\nWell, I need to know how much\nmemory I have on my system already.\n\n78\n00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.655\nSo, if I take take a look at my system, I\ncan see that I've got about 8 gigs of RAM.\n\n79\n00:03:48.655 --> 00:03:54.270\nMy computer right now is using 1.7 gigs\nof RAM, so that means I've got about\n\n80\n00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.255\n6.3 gigs of RAM I'm not using, so I should\ngive 6.3 to this virtual machine, right?\n\n81\n00:03:58.255 --> 00:04:01.445\nWell no, I'm not running a lot of\napplications right now, I need to create\n\n82\n00:04:01.445 --> 00:04:04.890\na healthy balance between the virtual\nmachine and my real machine, so I\n\n83\n00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.530\nwanna pick something reasonable here, I'm\ngonna pick just 2 gigs of memory, right?\n\n84\n00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.610\nRemember that Windows 8 has a minimum\nrecommended setting of 1 gig of memory, so\n\n85\n00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:14.230\nI'm giving it 2 gigs.\n\n86\n00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.260\nThat should be plenty for\nit to go with, all right?\n\n87\n00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.850\nThere's a setting called dynamic memory,\nwe can turn on, that makes it a little\n\n88\n00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.985\nmore frugal with how is uses memory,\nbut it hurts performance.\n\n89\n00:04:22.985 --> 00:04:26.675\nSo we don't normally want to use that for\nsomething like a work machine, so\n\n90\n00:04:26.675 --> 00:04:28.725\nI'll leave that turned off, all right?\n\n91\n00:04:28.725 --> 00:04:31.515\nWe can ask it or tell it what network\nwe want it to be connected to, so\n\n92\n00:04:31.515 --> 00:04:34.315\nwe can attach it to our wireless card or\nour physical card.\n\n93\n00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:36.410\nI'll just leave mine disconnected.\n\n94\n00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.430\nAnd then,\nwe can define a virtual hard drive.\n\n95\n00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.790\nNow the virtual hard drive's\nnot a real hard drive, right?\n\n96\n00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.856\nIt's, basically, gonna take all the data\nthis computer writes to a hard drive, and\n\n97\n00:04:44.856 --> 00:04:45.990\nstore it in a file.\n\n98\n00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.390\nAnd so,\nit's telling me the name of that file, and\n\n99\n00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.100\nwhere it's going to put that file,\nso I can see it all right here.\n\n100\n00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.540\nI'm gonna copy that so\nI'll have it here in a minute.\n\n101\n00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.860\nAnd it says it's gonna create\na 127 gig hard drive, all right?\n\n102\n00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.680\nNow, that might be a problem for\nme my hard drives not that big.\n\n103\n00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.610\nOn this computer,\nlet's see how much I've got, 237 gigs, so\n\n104\n00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.060\nI'm giving it over half\nmy hard drive space.\n\n105\n00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.670\nWell, that might be too much, right?\n\n106\n00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.440\nFortunately, this disk is\nwhat's called a dynamic disk.\n\n107\n00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.410\nWhen I create it,\nit's actually gonna be very, very small.\n\n108\n00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.062\nAnd as I copy files into it, it'll grow to\nthe size of whatever files I put in it.\n\n109\n00:05:27.062 --> 00:05:31.740\nSo, if I've only put 20 gigs of files in\nthere, it'll only be 20 gigs in size.\n\n110\n00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.720\nSo, this is more of a maximum number,\n\n111\n00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.197\nthan it is what it's gonna be at\nthe very beginning moment, okay?\n\n112\n00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.050\nThere's other ways to configure it, but\nthis is the best way for most people,\n\n113\n00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.280\nif they're running this\non their own computer.\n\n114\n00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.840\nAnd then, it's asking if we want\nto install an operating system.\n\n115\n00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.020\nAnd so, from here I can choose\nan operating system install.\n\n116\n00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.800\nIf your company is setting this up for\nyou, they'll have an image prepared for\n\n117\n00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.920\nthis already, but for me, I happen to have\na Windows installation disk right here, so\n\n118\n00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.330\nI'll just choose that,\nand we'll finish it up.\n\n119\n00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.940\nOkay, when it's done it's gonna\ncreate that computer for me.\n\n120\n00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.210\nIt's, basically,\nbuilding a virtual set of CPU,\n\n121\n00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.300\nRAM, hard drive space,\nnetwork card, right?\n\n122\n00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.980\nGetting all that set up, and\ngetting it ready to run.\n\n123\n00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.650\nAnd so, I can see my work computer,\nsitting right there, all right?\n\n124\n00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.250\nAnd remember that hard drive?\n\n125\n00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.360\nI'm gonna browse to where\nthat hard drive is.\n\n126\n00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.110\nIf I just paste that in here.\n\n127\n00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.420\nAnd let's see.\n\n128\n00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.910\nDid I get that wrong?\n\n129\n00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.140\nOh, you know what?\nIt's probably not created,\n\n130\n00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.200\ncuz I haven't actually started the VM yet.\n\n131\n00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.830\nSo let me start the VM.\n\n132\n00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.240\nSo the virtual machine,\nthis work computer's not actually running.\n\n133\n00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.140\nI'm gonna come in here and start it.\n\n134\n00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.360\nWhen I start it, it's booting up.\n\n135\n00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.670\nLet me connect to it real quick.\n\n136\n00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.690\nSo it's actually booting up this machine,\nand when it boots,\n\n137\n00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:49.550\nit's gonna boot to that Windows 7 disk,\nor at least we think it is, right?\n\n138\n00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.880\nNo operating system loaded,\npress any key to retry.\n\n139\n00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.660\nWhen you boot off a Windows 7 disc\nthere's a moment where it says press any\n\n140\n00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:57.420\nkey to continue.\n\n141\n00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.790\nI may have missed that or\nI might be on a non EFI disk.\n\n142\n00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:06.080\nSo there's a couple little things that can\ncause Windows 7 not to boot immediately.\n\n143\n00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.730\nSo let me just start this one up here,\nso I'll come in here, and\n\n144\n00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:09.720\njust right click and start it.\n\n145\n00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.970\nAnd it's actually gonna boot up,\nI'll connect to it here so\n\n146\n00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.720\nI can see what's going on.\n\n147\n00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.840\nSo it's starting to boot up, and\n\n148\n00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.440\nit's gonna boot off of that\nWindows 7 disk, right?\n\n149\n00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.060\nSo there it goes.\n\n150\n00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.940\nNow, while it's booting, I'm gonna\nswitch back to the file system here.\n\n151\n00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.730\nAnd I'm gonna paste that path in.\n\n152\n00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.510\nAnd what we should see, there we go.\n\n153\n00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.640\nThere's that work computer\nvirtual hard drive, and\n\n154\n00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.510\nI can see it's only a blazing\n4 MB in size right now.\n\n155\n00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.680\nSo it's not eating up\na ton of hard drive space.\n\n156\n00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.620\nBut I'm launching this Windows\n7 install in the background.\n\n157\n00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.440\nSo here's that machine, and\n\n158\n00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.090\nit's, basically, gonna run me through\nthe process of installing Windows 7.\n\n159\n00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:45.016\nNow your average end user probably\ndoesn't wanna go through this,\n\n160\n00:07:45.016 --> 00:07:46.670\ngetting it installed, and all that.\n\n161\n00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:49.130\nSo your business would normally\ntake care of this for you.\n\n162\n00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:51.810\nThey'll have an image that's ready\nto be your work computer, and\n\n163\n00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:54.630\nthey'll load it right in the HyperV,\nso you're good to go.\n\n164\n00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.320\nBut if you don't have it you could\nalways build your own, right?\n\n165\n00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.600\nMaybe you're doing this for\nyour own benefit.\n\n166\n00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.870\nI wanna have these two separate computers.\n\n167\n00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.220\nYou can use HyperV for a lot of things.\n\n168\n00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.707\nMaybe I have an application that\nwon't run on Windows 10, so\n\n169\n00:08:04.707 --> 00:08:08.490\nI wanna run a Windows 8 or\nWindows 7 virtual machine, and\n\n170\n00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:10.890\nrun the application in there,\nyou can certainly do that.\n\n171\n00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:14.930\nAnd so, as we progress through this,\nwe can go in here, and do our install.\n\n172\n00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:19.190\nI'll pick that virtual hard drive,\nand there goes installing Windows.\n\n173\n00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:22.820\nNow, it's copying data from\nthe Windows install CD to\n\n174\n00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.050\nthat virtual hard drive\nto get it installed.\n\n175\n00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:29.343\nAnd if you watch, it's neat because you'll\nwatch this grow, now I'm at 266 megs.\n\n176\n00:08:29.343 --> 00:08:32.810\nAnd if I sit here patiently, or\nif I hit refresh over and over and\n\n177\n00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:36.090\nover again, it'll continue\nto grow as Windows installs.\n\n178\n00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:38.440\nCopying data in there and getting it up.\n\n179\n00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.190\nNow, when it's done, I'm not gonna\nbore you guys with waiting for\n\n180\n00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.480\nthis install to finish,\nbut when it's done,\n\n181\n00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:48.290\nwhat you're left with is a full\ninstallation of Windows 7, in this case.\n\n182\n00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.730\nAnd I can use my regular desktop,\n\n183\n00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:54.930\nall this stuff back here, I can use\nthat for my Apps, my personal stuff.\n\n184\n00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:57.770\nBrowsing the Internet,\ninstalling games, or whatever.\n\n185\n00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:01.550\nAnd when I wanna do work, I can fire up\nthis virtual machine, and I can do work.\n\n186\n00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:03.380\nAnd I do work in there, and\nI don't browse the Internet, and\n\n187\n00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.600\nI don't play games in\nthat virtual machine.\n\n188\n00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.210\nSo it's nice and clean.\n\n189\n00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:11.520\nIt can be very secure and safe, and\nI can be as insecure as I want.\n\n190\n00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.478\nOr unsecure or nonsecure,\n\n191\n00:09:13.478 --> 00:09:18.610\nwhatever it is, out here in the rest of\nmy system, and it doesn't affect my work.\n\n192\n00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:23.080\nSo leveraging a client side hypervisor\nlike this virtualization on a client,\n\n193\n00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.890\ncan really make that pretty handy, right?\n\n194\n00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:30.200\nMake your life a lot easier by\ncreating that true partition,\n\n195\n00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.450\nthat true separation, between the work\nside versus the personal side.\n\n196\n00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:37.530\nAnd we don't get that with\nthings like Work Folders.\n\n197\n00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:40.320\nWhere Work Folders are actually storing\nthe documents right here on your personal\n\n198\n00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.700\nmachine, and you're opening up with\nthe same applications you use to edit\n\n199\n00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.290\ndocuments on your personal machine, right?\n\n200\n00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.160\nThat boundary is too easy to cross.\n\n201\n00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.500\nThis creates a true boundary.\n\n202\n00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.320\nThese are separate computers,\nrunning on the same hardware.\n\n203\n00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.430\n>> That's awesome Don.\n\n204\n00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:55.350\nNow, we have seen how we\ncan control different ways,\n\n205\n00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:58.290\nand allow users to use their own devices.\n\n206\n00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:01.133\nAnd we've done it at a pretty\ndecent level of operation, but\n\n207\n00:10:01.133 --> 00:10:02.653\nwhat if we needed more control?\n\n208\n00:10:02.653 --> 00:10:06.229\nWhat if we needed more fine granular\ncontrol, to be able to say,\n\n209\n00:10:06.229 --> 00:10:09.275\nyou know what,\nyou're job role is a certain thing, or\n\n210\n00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:13.930\nmaybe you're in a type of group that\ndoesn't need access to this over here.\n\n211\n00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:17.650\nHow do I get that level of\ncontrol over my users, Don?\n\n212\n00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.090\n>> There are people that wanna\nget the control so tight,\n\n213\n00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:24.100\nlike down to the individual document,\nall right?\n\n214\n00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.940\nAnd that can be really challenging.\n\n215\n00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.200\nFor example, I might have a document.\n\n216\n00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.680\nAnd I say, all right,\n\n217\n00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:33.900\nI want Daniel to be able to open this\ndocument when he's on his work computer,\n\n218\n00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.920\nor when he's on this one company\napproved personal computer of his.\n\n219\n00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.155\nBut I don't want him to be able to open\nthis document when he's on a cell phone,\n\n220\n00:10:42.155 --> 00:10:44.030\nor on a tablet, right?\n\n221\n00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:48.000\nIt's still Daniel, it's his account,\nbut I really wanna be specific about\n\n222\n00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.890\nthe conditions under which he's\nallowed to open that document, or\n\n223\n00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:53.110\nto save it, or to edit it.\n\n224\n00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:57.040\nThat's not really possible with the normal\ntechnologies that are built in Windows,\n\n225\n00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.690\nand part of the active directory, and all\nthat, it's not really, normally, possible.\n\n226\n00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:04.680\nBut there's some newer features, in\nthe latest version of Windows Server 2012,\n\n227\n00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.610\nand in Microsoft's Azure,\nthat lets you do it.\n\n228\n00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:13.810\nWe have one thing is what's\ncalled dynamic access control.\n\n229\n00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:17.810\nWith dynamic access control, when somebody\nconnects their computer to your network,\n\n230\n00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.940\nwhether it be a personal computer or\na work computer or\n\n231\n00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.400\nwhatever, you can create\ndynamic access policies.\n\n232\n00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.270\nAnd these policies can dictate how\ncertain documents are controlled.\n\n233\n00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:31.708\nSo you can take a folder, or even\nan individual file, and apply a secret or\n\n234\n00:11:31.708 --> 00:11:35.217\ntop secret rating to it, and\nif it's a top secret rating,\n\n235\n00:11:35.217 --> 00:11:37.884\nit can only be opened\non company computers.\n\n236\n00:11:37.884 --> 00:11:41.568\nIf it's a sensitive but\nunclassified document, right,\n\n237\n00:11:41.568 --> 00:11:46.377\nit's one of our American terms, which\nis a pain, on those, maybe I do allow\n\n238\n00:11:46.377 --> 00:11:51.702\nthat to be open on a personal computer,\nas long as its authorized personnel.\n\n239\n00:11:51.702 --> 00:11:54.442\nSo you can use dynamic access\ncontrol to do that, and\n\n240\n00:11:54.442 --> 00:11:56.112\nthat's a function of Windows server.\n\n241\n00:11:56.112 --> 00:11:57.692\nSo it's another option that's out there.\n\n242\n00:11:57.692 --> 00:11:58.912\nYou won't be expected to,\n\n243\n00:11:58.912 --> 00:12:02.696\nto configure it on the exam, but you'll be\nexpected to know what that term is, right?\n\n244\n00:12:02.696 --> 00:12:06.456\nDynamic access control,\nit's a way to apply permissions,\n\n245\n00:12:06.456 --> 00:12:10.486\nlike what we saw with file permissions\nearlier in the series, read, write,\n\n246\n00:12:10.486 --> 00:12:15.548\nmodify, full control, those things,\nlike that, but a lot more built around it.\n\n247\n00:12:15.548 --> 00:12:18.008\nWhat time they're doing it,\nwhat computer they're on.\n\n248\n00:12:18.008 --> 00:12:19.858\nWhether they've done\ntheir Windows updates.\n\n249\n00:12:19.858 --> 00:12:21.548\nAll of these things can\ninfluence whether or\n\n250\n00:12:21.548 --> 00:12:23.738\nnot they're allowed to open that document.\n\n251\n00:12:23.738 --> 00:12:27.354\nThe most common is are their virus\ndefinitions up to date, right?\n\n252\n00:12:27.354 --> 00:12:29.314\nCan't connect to the network,\ncan't open these documents,\n\n253\n00:12:29.314 --> 00:12:30.924\nunless your virus\ndefinition are up to date.\n\n254\n00:12:30.924 --> 00:12:34.364\nThat's the stuff you can do with\ndynamic access, so really, really,\n\n255\n00:12:34.364 --> 00:12:35.624\ncool technology there.\n\n256\n00:12:35.624 --> 00:12:37.254\nReally, really hard to set up.\n\n257\n00:12:37.254 --> 00:12:38.242\nIt's a tough one.\n\n258\n00:12:38.242 --> 00:12:40.110\nBut once it's in place,\nit works really well.\n\n259\n00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:42.902\n>> I was gonna say, yeah,\n\n260\n00:12:42.902 --> 00:12:46.692\nI actually had to see this in action in\nsome of the companies I've worked for,\n\n261\n00:12:46.692 --> 00:12:49.282\nthey have a lot of people,\nthey just wanna bring a device in.\n\n262\n00:12:49.282 --> 00:12:51.392\nMaybe they're not even\npart of the business.\n\n263\n00:12:51.392 --> 00:12:52.552\nThings like auditors, right?\n\n264\n00:12:52.552 --> 00:12:53.752\nThey come with their own devices.\n\n265\n00:12:53.752 --> 00:12:57.765\nWe do wanna give them some access, but we\ndon't wanna expose our network to things\n\n266\n00:12:57.765 --> 00:13:01.240\nthat we don't wanna expose it to,\nviruses and things like that.\n\n267\n00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.815\nThey're not keeping it up to snuff,\nthey're not doing things like updates and\n\n268\n00:13:04.815 --> 00:13:05.680\nantivirus.\n\n269\n00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.920\nWell we gave them\na different type of access.\n\n270\n00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.400\nThey would make sure to go through\na certain area of our network\n\n271\n00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:16.080\nthat was okay with that, and\nnever touch the more sensitive areas.\n\n272\n00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.440\nLike you said, very difficult to set up.\n\n273\n00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:23.300\nBut it really will give you the type\nof control, necessary, for an in and\n\n274\n00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:27.420\nout environment like that, where people\nare just meandering through your network,\n\n275\n00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:28.616\nand your environment.\n\n276\n00:13:28.616 --> 00:13:31.630\n>> There are limits,\ndynamic has it's control,\n\n277\n00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.700\nit's really powerful\n>> But there's the assumption,\n\n278\n00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:35.910\nat the very base level,\n\n279\n00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:39.161\nthat whoever it is, at least has a user\naccount on your network, all right?\n\n280\n00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:41.920\nDaniel you mentioned auditors,\n\n281\n00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.590\nwe might give the auditors a user account\non our network cuz their auditing, right?\n\n282\n00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:46.780\nThey might need that, right?\n\n283\n00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:49.780\nBut, what if it's somebody who I don't\nwanna have any access to my network?\n\n284\n00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.669\nMaybe I have an attorney, and\n\n285\n00:13:51.669 --> 00:13:57.560\nI want to send the attorney a document of\nmine to review, but, it's confidential.\n\n286\n00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.980\nI don't want the attorney\nto be able print it.\n\n287\n00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.570\nI don't want them to be able\nto send it to somebody else,\n\n288\n00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:04.560\nI just want to make sure\nthat it's only them.\n\n289\n00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.860\nAnd I don't wanna give them\na user account on my network, but\n\n290\n00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.910\nI want to secure that document, all right?\n\n291\n00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.170\nWell, there's a different\ntechnology we can deploy,\n\n292\n00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:13.320\ncalled Windows Rights Management.\n\n293\n00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.740\nWindows Rights Management is another one\nthat's actually pretty hard to implement\n\n294\n00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:20.240\nin your own network, but\nyou can deploy on Azure.\n\n295\n00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:24.550\nAnd on Azure, it's like three clicks, and\nyou've got Rights Management deployed,\n\n296\n00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:26.880\nthey charge extra for it,\nand that's why it's so easy.\n\n297\n00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.520\nBut it is easy, it does deploy.\n\n298\n00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.610\nAnd from there,\n\n299\n00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:34.110\nwhen you create a document, you can assign\nWindows Right Management policies to it.\n\n300\n00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:36.490\nWindows Rights Management,\nI need to say it right.\n\n301\n00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:38.320\nThe rights management policy to it.\n\n302\n00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.474\nAnd you can say, here's a document,\nanybody in the world can open it, but\n\n303\n00:14:41.474 --> 00:14:42.841\nnobody's allowed to print it.\n\n304\n00:14:42.841 --> 00:14:44.960\nAnd so now, you've locked down printing.\n\n305\n00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.777\nOr Daniel can open it,\nwith his Microsoft ID, or\n\n306\n00:14:47.777 --> 00:14:51.100\nwhatever it is that he's\nusing to authenticate.\n\n307\n00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.840\nHe can open it with that ID, but\nhe's not allowed to print it, and\n\n308\n00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.450\nhe's not allowed to forward it.\n\n309\n00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:57.560\nAnd so,\nif he wants somebody else to open it,\n\n310\n00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:00.670\nhe's gonna have to share his credentials\nwith them, which he could do, right?\n\n311\n00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:01.850\nThat is always possible.\n\n312\n00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.420\nBut it gives you that\nextra level of control.\n\n313\n00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:08.180\nSo, dynamic access control,\nlot of power, but\n\n314\n00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:11.250\nassumes you have an account\nwith the business, all right?\n\n315\n00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:14.820\nWindows Rights Management,\non the other hand, that one, well,\n\n316\n00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:17.590\nit deploys across the world, really.\n\n317\n00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:20.920\nIt's all done in Azure, and you don't\nhave an account with just your company,\n\n318\n00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.880\nyou can have a Microsoft account,\nsome kind of public account, one you just\n\n319\n00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.780\nregistered for for the purpose of\nopening this one document, if you want.\n\n320\n00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.110\nAnd you'll have that control.\n\n321\n00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:30.619\nSo, another tool of the trade for\n\n322\n00:15:30.619 --> 00:15:35.940\nEnterprise is trying to manage data\nstored on machines they don't control.\n\n323\n00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:36.840\n>> All right.\n\n324\n00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.550\nDon, that was an excellent\noverview of these different\n\n325\n00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:42.220\nenterprise management tools\nthat we have available for us.\n\n326\n00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:45.160\nMicrosoft has done a great job of\ndocumenting those things, as well,\n\n327\n00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:49.800\nso if you ever get stuck on that stuff,\nTechWeb, MSDN, this fantastic.\n\n328\n00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:54.510\nOr, you never know, ITProTV, we tend to\nmake videos about that stuff, as well.\n\n329\n00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:55.300\nGreat stuff, Don.\n\n330\n00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:58.180\nHave we skipped anything or\ndo we need to mention any other?\n\n331\n00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:59.110\n>> I think that's about it, Daniel.\n\n332\n00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:00.170\n>> You've brought it to the end.\n\n333\n00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:03.198\nWell, hopefully, you good people out\nthere have watched this episode, and\n\n334\n00:16:03.198 --> 00:16:03.950\ngot a lot out of it.\n\n335\n00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:06.360\nWe had a great time making it for you.\n\n336\n00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.550\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n337\n00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:10.430\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n338\n00:16:10.430 -->

00:00:20.001\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\ntoday we're doing our MTA mobility and\n\n4\n00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:22.090\ndevices fundamentals.\n\n5\n00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.510\nAnd specifically, in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.375\nwe're gonna be taking a look at\nmanaging a Windows RT device.\n\n7\n00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:29.280\nIn today's enterprise,\n\n8\n00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.920\nyou'll never know what kind of devices are\ngonna be brought in by our end users and\n\n9\n00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.397\nit's up to us to be able to manage them,\nmake sure they stay in compliance with any\n\n10\n00:00:37.397 --> 00:00:42.240\ncorporate policies or\nanything else we might have to do.\n\n11\n00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.950\nAnd so here to help us with\nall of that is Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:45.680\nHow's it going Wes?\n\n13\n00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.840\n>> It's going great Mike and\nthanks for having me back here.\n\n14\n00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.590\nThat's right, the Windows RT Tablet.\n\n15\n00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.410\nBoy I tell you what, they can be an\nendeavor when it comes to managing them.\n\n16\n00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.090\nWe'll make our own contribution\nto the English language here.\n\n17\n00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.240\nSo what is it that makes\nthem challenging to manage?\n\n18\n00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.390\nWell if I have a traditional client,\nlet's say running Windows 7,\n\n19\n00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.570\nrunning Windows 8.1, Windows 10, and\nthey're running the professional or\n\n20\n00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.420\nthey're enterprise editions, well I\ncan join them to a corporate domain.\n\n21\n00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.350\nWhen I join him to a corporate domain\nthat gives the administrator the ability\n\n22\n00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.120\nto reach out through the network and\npush out things like group policy objects.\n\n23\n00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.360\nConfiguring computer settings,\nand user configurations, and\n\n24\n00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.840\nit really can be managed\nfrom a centralized location.\n\n25\n00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.190\nWith the Windows RT tablets, unfortunately\nthat's one of the starting limitations,\n\n26\n00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.600\nis the fact that we can't\njoin them to the domain.\n\n27\n00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.250\nMike and I know that you've been dealing\ninside of Active Directory now for\n\n28\n00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.660\nbetter than a decade.\n\n29\n00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.130\nSo what would you say that if I have\na device that I need to manage, but\n\n30\n00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.030\nI can't join it to your domain?\n\n31\n00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.950\nIt's gonna make it a little challenging.\n\n32\n00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.880\n>> I'd say,\ndon't bring it into my network.\n\n33\n00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.405\n>> No.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n34\n00:01:52.405 --> 00:01:52.915\n>> Absolutely,\n\n35\n00:01:52.915 --> 00:01:57.390\nbecause that is the method that we've\ncome to rely on to manage our devices.\n\n36\n00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.535\nWe would provide computers to our end\nusers, or if they brought them in that was\n\n37\n00:02:01.535 --> 00:02:05.670\nfine but they would be running some sort\nof Windows operating system that we could\n\n38\n00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.630\njoin to the domain and\nwe could manage their group policy.\n\n39\n00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.050\nNow you tell me we've got these devices\nrunning this flavor of Windows that\n\n40\n00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.132\nDoesn't support domain join,\nwhat am I supposed to do?\n\n41\n00:02:15.132 --> 00:02:20.000\n>> Yeah, sure, when you try to\ngive them centralized access,\n\n42\n00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.300\nor I guess if you will,\nit's access to the resources, right?\n\n43\n00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.420\nIf they're domain members, we can put\ninformation up on a file server and\n\n44\n00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.020\ndo the authentication that happens in\nthe background through active directory\n\n45\n00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.070\nWe don't have to worry about it,\nwe can set permissions.\n\n46\n00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.760\nWell, that's a little bit different,\n\n47\n00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.460\nit's where these Windows RT tablets\nbecome a little big challenging so\n\n48\n00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.940\nwe're gonna see if we can help you\nout when it comes to managing them.\n\n49\n00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.500\nIf we take a look at the sky cam,\n\n50\n00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.090\nwe've actually got our Surface\ndevice here ready to go.\n\n51\n00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.057\nAnd let me walk you through a couple of\nthings that I can show you how it is kinda\n\n52\n00:02:50.057 --> 00:02:50.780\nchallenging.\n\n53\n00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.919\nIf we go to the traditional\nsystem properties, right?\n\n54\n00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:58.250\nYour system control panel,\nthis is pretty much been the same for\n\n55\n00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.500\nWindows operating system that I wanna\nsay going back to Vista, right.\n\n56\n00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.140\nAnd I have this location right here,\nadvanced system settings and\n\n57\n00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.880\nif I click on that, you'll see the\ntraditional system properties menu, right?\n\n58\n00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.690\nAnd if we come over\nhere the computer name,\n\n59\n00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.840\nthis is typically where we join and\nunjoin computers from a domain.\n\n60\n00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.170\nSo if I go to do this,\nwe'll choose change.\n\n61\n00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.740\nAnd by the way if you guys are studying\nfor a certification out there and\n\n62\n00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.050\nneed to know how to join a computer to the\ndomain, this is where you're gonna do it.\n\n63\n00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.270\nBut there's a problem here.\n\n64\n00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.000\nWhere I would usually do this\non any client work station.\n\n65\n00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.070\nAnd really laptop for that matter,\nit doesn't have to be a desktop, right?\n\n66\n00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.900\nI would have the option to\nswitch over tot he domain.\n\n67\n00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.250\nWe could name the domain and\n\n68\n00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.420\nif it could contact a domain\ncontroller we've got the credentials.\n\n69\n00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.490\nWe're a domain member ourselves,\nthis device becomes part of the domain and\n\n70\n00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.055\nnow those group policies can configure it.\n\n71\n00:03:46.055 --> 00:03:50.020\nBut that's a big limitation right here,\nlooking at this I don't have that ability.\n\n72\n00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.680\nSo, well the other ability Mike,\n\n73\n00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.950\nimagine what's another traditional way\nyou might manage one of these devices?\n\n74\n00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.690\n>> Well if it wasn't part of my domain,\nI might think, well, I'll go ahead and\n\n75\n00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.435\njust remote into it, maybe I can use RDP,\nor Remote Desktop Protocol to access\n\n76\n00:04:03.435 --> 00:04:06.925\nthe machine remotely, or that tablet\nremotely, and configure it that way.\n\n77\n00:04:06.925 --> 00:04:10.265\n>> Absolutely, so let's go ahead and\nlet's see what Mike's talking about.\n\n78\n00:04:10.265 --> 00:04:14.445\nNow, I could, over here on our tablet,\nI could go back to our start screen, and\n\n79\n00:04:14.445 --> 00:04:20.345\nI could type mstsc, and\nthere's our remote desktop connection.\n\n80\n00:04:20.345 --> 00:04:21.419\nLaunch it up, we're good, right?\n\n81\n00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.630\nWrong, right?\n\n82\n00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.571\nThis is the remote desktop\nconnection software,\n\n83\n00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:27.567\nthis is how I connect to another computer,\nright?\n\n84\n00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:30.951\nAnd Windows RT tabs, you can do that,\nit's not a problem, right?\n\n85\n00:04:30.951 --> 00:04:34.391\nI can use this to connect\nto Mike's computer, well,\n\n86\n00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:38.570\nprovided that he lets me, but\nthat's not what Mike was asking.\n\n87\n00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.130\nMike was telling me that hey he wants\nto connect to the device using RDP, so\n\n88\n00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.050\nlet's go ahead, and\nlet's find out if we can do that.\n\n89\n00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.480\nI've got remote settings here.\n\n90\n00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.100\nSecond down from the top,\nthird if you include control panel home.\n\n91\n00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.350\nAnd if I choose remote settings, I always\nlike these three little hyperlinks.\n\n92\n00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.920\nThey take you to the same locations,\nsystem properties, just a different tab.\n\n93\n00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.500\nWell, now I'm on the remote tab.\n\n94\n00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.756\nMaybe some of you guys have seen out there\nin the traditional environment, right?\n\n95\n00:05:01.756 --> 00:05:04.690\nWhere we have remote desktop down here and\nwe've got three radio buttons.\n\n96\n00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.230\nThe default says don't allow any\nconnections in this computer.\n\n97\n00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:12.790\nThe second one says allow connections to\nthis computer using older versions of\n\n98\n00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.330\nremote desktop, a little less secure.\n\n99\n00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.430\nAnd then if you're using\nnetwork level authentication,\n\n100\n00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.620\nthe newer versions you choose that option.\n\n101\n00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.040\nWell that's all fine and dandy if I had\nthat capability, if I had those options.\n\n102\n00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.600\nSo you can see here, even through\nsomething as simple as getting\n\n103\n00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.170\na help desk ticket,\nI've got this BYOD device, I need you to,\n\n104\n00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.050\ncan you look, something's wrong with it,\nand unfortunately well, no, we can't.\n\n105\n00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.980\nWell, I mean, we can, right?\n\n106\n00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.370\nWe could use remote assistance,\n\n107\n00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.920\nbut there again, setting that up is\nnot as simplistic as just having RDP.\n\n108\n00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.300\nIn fact,\nif you're in a Windows environment or\n\n109\n00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.310\nan Active Directory environment typically,\nor I would say traditionally and commonly\n\n110\n00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.020\nyou're gonna see that your administrator's\nalways already had this set up so\n\n111\n00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.580\nthat they can connect the machines,\n\n112\n00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.190\nat least help desk can if they\nneed to manage and maintain them.\n\n113\n00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.010\nNow there is another option that you could\npotentially have here since, well we can't\n\n114\n00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.680\nuse domain join, we don't have that\nability, we can't use Remote Desktop.\n\n115\n00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.790\nWell, the other thing I could\npotentially do if it's set up\n\n116\n00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.200\nis I could launch our\ntraditional command prompt.\n\n117\n00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.380\nLet me go ahead and drop down to\nan Administrative Command Prompt here.\n\n118\n00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.550\nAnd it's gonna prompt us for our UAC.\n\n119\n00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:27.780\nAnd then I could run the traditional\nwinrm and we can do a quick config.\n\n120\n00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.610\nNow, the Windows remote management\ninstrumentation is already set up on\n\n121\n00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.068\nthis machine but we'll go ahead and\nshow you how to do it.\n\n122\n00:06:35.068 --> 00:06:38.630\nYou'd run winrm quick config, and\nthen when you run this command,\n\n123\n00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.630\none of the things that it's\ngonna do is it's gonna check.\n\n124\n00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:45.580\nIs the Windows and, sorry for the acronyms\nthere, Windows remote management protocol,\n\n125\n00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:46.340\nis it set up?\n\n126\n00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.300\nAnd you can see that it\nalready is set up here.\n\n127\n00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.400\nBut what does this allow me to do, right?\n\n128\n00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.090\nWell, let's take it from this computer or\nthis tablet's standpoint.\n\n129\n00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.490\nIt opens up the firewall, creates this\n\n130\n00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:02.500\nHTTP listener service that accepts\nincoming remote management requests.\n\n131\n00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.480\nBut that's where I'm limited to, right?\n\n132\n00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.880\nThat's all I have the ability to do.\n\n133\n00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.540\nSo what can I do?\n\n134\n00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.200\nAnd that's where the Windows, and again\nI'm going to say this a couple of times,\n\n135\n00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.750\nMicrosoft Intune platform comes into play.\n\n136\n00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.200\nNow I say that because Mike's over here\nlaughing at me because we talked about\n\n137\n00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:26.190\nthis before, it's been called, in\nthe past it's been called Windows Intune.\n\n138\n00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:27.660\nAnd why is it called Windows Intune?\n\n139\n00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.580\nWell, because well,\nwhen it first came out,\n\n140\n00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.910\nit was managing pretty\nmuch just Windows devices.\n\n141\n00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:37.900\nAnd then as the platform grew,\nthey said well, guess what?\n\n142\n00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.330\nIt's not only managing Windows devices\nanymore, it's managing iOS devices,\n\n143\n00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:46.120\nit's managing Android devices so\nthey renamed it to Microsoft Intune.\n\n144\n00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.690\nSo I'll probably make\na mistake a couple of times.\n\n145\n00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:53.107\nSo let's go ahead and\nwhat we're gonna do here is\n\n146\n00:07:53.107 --> 00:07:57.753\nwe're get logged in to\nthe management interface.\n\n147\n00:07:57.753 --> 00:08:01.290\nSo I'll go ahead and if you will,\nlet's look at my computer here.\n\n148\n00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:05.811\nAnd I'm logging into the management\nportal for Microsoft's Intune console.\n\n149\n00:08:05.811 --> 00:08:10.332\nNow the Microsoft Intune console gives me\nthe ability to do some things with these\n\n150\n00:08:10.332 --> 00:08:12.860\nWindows RT tablets that\nbecause of their lack\n\n151\n00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.000\nof domain membership kind\nof bridges that gap, right?\n\n152\n00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.080\nYou wanna be able to\ncontrol these devices,\n\n153\n00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.410\nand here's another thing\nwith these devices, right?\n\n154\n00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:25.550\nLet's say we do have remote assistance\nready to go or remote management.\n\n155\n00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:28.050\nThey have to be on my network\nto be able to manage them and\n\n156\n00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:31.640\nif they're not on my network then again it\nbecomes even more of a complexity to try\n\n157\n00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.680\nto manage these devices.\n\n158\n00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:37.130\nSo imagine a scenario like we have\nright here with Microsoft Intune\n\n159\n00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:38.900\nthat Mike says he needs\nto administer to this.\n\n160\n00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:43.510\nNow that long arm can reach out across\nthe internet to wherever this device is.\n\n161\n00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:49.250\nAnd if it's set up right, he can manage\nit, we can implement policies, right?\n\n162\n00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:52.660\nBut there is something that we have to\ndo before we can even set up any mobile\n\n163\n00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.050\ndevice of management at all in the Intune,\n\n164\n00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.400\nwe like to take a second\nhere to show you that.\n\n165\n00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:02.900\nIf I come down to the administrative, or\nadmin tile here on the left hand side and\n\n166\n00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:06.080\nI choose that, you're gonna see\nwe have a series of options here.\n\n167\n00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.340\nBut the one that I'm really really\nconcerned with is this mobile device\n\n168\n00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:10.280\nmanagement.\n\n169\n00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.010\nNow if I choose that, notice that it says,\n\n170\n00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:17.680\nit tells me, they certainly don't make it\nhard to understand what's the first step.\n\n171\n00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.220\nYou got to choose Microsoft Intune\nto manage mobile devices, right?\n\n172\n00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.000\nThere's no authority set, all right,\n\n173\n00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.220\nnow what do we mean by mobile device\nmanagement and the authority.\n\n174\n00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.810\nWell this is an open and\nI don't want to say open source,\n\n175\n00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:32.950\nit's an open set of protocols and\nI think Microsoft first invented it and\n\n176\n00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:35.260\nthey gave it out to the public and\n\n177\n00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:39.860\nagain you could build on it as well,\nit is a client server protocol, right?\n\n178\n00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:44.620\nThe client has to enroll in a mobile\ndevice management solution, and\n\n179\n00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:49.440\nthen the server side is the ability\nto push out those configurations,\n\n180\n00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.170\nthings like firewall scans, so\nthat's the server side, but\n\n181\n00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:56.720\nwe have to set the mobile\ndevice management authority.\n\n182\n00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.795\nNow you can see Set to Microsoft Intune,\n\n183\n00:09:59.795 --> 00:10:03.516\nwe can see we're ready for\nenrollment, right?\n\n184\n00:10:03.516 --> 00:10:06.783\nAnd now we have the ability,\nanother reason they changed it from\n\n185\n00:10:06.783 --> 00:10:09.870\nWindows Intune,\nlook at all the different devices.\n\n186\n00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:13.600\nWindows Phone, we've got iOS,\neven Mac OS devices we can do and\n\n187\n00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.320\nthere's something that you need to setup\nto be able to manage the IOS devices.\n\n188\n00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:23.280\nBut, one of the things now that we\nhave to do, is we have to go drop back\n\n189\n00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:28.665\ndown to our Windows RT tablet, and\nwe need to make sure that we get it set up\n\n190\n00:10:28.665 --> 00:10:33.715\nin order that it can contact this\nplatform, and it can enroll itself.\n\n191\n00:10:33.715 --> 00:10:38.155\nSo let's go ahead, let's jump back\nover to our Surface tablet here, and\n\n192\n00:10:38.155 --> 00:10:40.295\nlet's see if we can get that set up and\nready to go.\n\n193\n00:10:40.295 --> 00:10:43.415\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead and\nclose some of these windows down.\n\n194\n00:10:43.415 --> 00:10:44.365\nWhat you need to do,\n\n195\n00:10:44.365 --> 00:10:49.430\nis you need to log in to the Windows Store\nthat you can see up here, right there.\n\n196\n00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:53.490\nYou have to have your Microsoft account\nin order to connect to the store.\n\n197\n00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:58.480\nNow the way that's set up in your\norganization also requires a domain,\n\n198\n00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.990\nthere is the ability to attach that.\n\n199\n00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:04.370\nBut keep in mind we're not coming from a\ndomain here, because this is an RT Tablet,\n\n200\n00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:05.383\nso, what do we do?\n\n201\n00:11:05.383 --> 00:11:08.360\nThe simplest downloading\nthe company portal, right?\n\n202\n00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:12.100\nThat is the client's side aspect\nthat's why your end users see and\n\n203\n00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.730\nthat's also what your end users would\nsee here on the windows tablet.\n\n204\n00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.520\nNow, I went ahead and downloaded\nthis ahead of time just when you\n\n205\n00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.830\ngo to the Windows store\njust type company portal.\n\n206\n00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:23.220\nWhen you type you'll see it,\nyou can download it and\n\n207\n00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.100\nthen we'll go ahead and launch it.\n\n208\n00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:30.680\nNow when we launch it, it's gonna require\nyou to authenticate, now we'll see if it\n\n209\n00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.688\nremembers my authentication cuz you\nguys certainly don't need to see me type\n\n210\n00:11:33.688 --> 00:11:38.736\na password 15 times incorrectly here,\nor maybe you can so.\n\n211\n00:11:38.736 --> 00:11:39.952\n>> Fingers crossed here.\n\n212\n00:11:39.952 --> 00:11:41.621\n[LAUGH]\n>> Keep your fingers crossed yes.\n\n213\n00:11:41.621 --> 00:11:42.561\n>> You can do it.\n\n214\n00:11:42.561 --> 00:11:45.725\n>> [LAUGH] I can do it,\nthe little engine that could.\n\n215\n00:11:45.725 --> 00:11:47.725\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We'll find out.\n\n216\n00:11:47.725 --> 00:11:52.525\n[SOUND] And well, I got a beep there so\nhopefully, maybe that's a good beep,\n\n217\n00:11:52.525 --> 00:11:54.183\nmaybe that's a bad beep.\n\n218\n00:11:54.183 --> 00:11:54.692\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n219\n00:11:54.692 --> 00:11:55.852\n>> All right, so\n\n220\n00:11:55.852 --> 00:11:59.792\nnow what we should be able to see is that\nwe get the ability to link this device.\n\n221\n00:11:59.792 --> 00:12:01.202\nNow, there's a couple of different ways,\n\n222\n00:12:01.202 --> 00:12:06.160\nyou can see that it asks you, learn how to\nlink this device to your company portal.\n\n223\n00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.710\nWell it's just gonna take me\nout to the Internet, why?\n\n224\n00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:12.220\nBecause in the system control\npanel there's something called\n\n225\n00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.350\nCompany Apps, right?\n\n226\n00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:15.190\nLet's go ahead and\ntake you there so you can see.\n\n227\n00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:18.610\nAnd we're gonna go back to that\nsame location, by the way,\n\n228\n00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:23.120\nthat we were looking at when we looked for\na lack of a domain join, right?\n\n229\n00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.634\nThere's this Company Apps option.\n\n230\n00:12:24.634 --> 00:12:25.631\n[SOUND] Right?\n\n231\n00:12:25.631 --> 00:12:29.540\nAnd you'll see that it longs in, this is\na good thing, it's built right in, right?\n\n232\n00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:33.820\nAnd now it's gonna ask me for\nan email address and the password.\n\n233\n00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:38.951\nSo what we're gonna go ahead and do is\nwe're gonna type the password in and we'll\n\n234\n00:12:38.951 --> 00:12:43.862\nget this logged into our company center or\nto the Microsoft InTune platform.\n\n235\n00:12:43.862 --> 00:12:47.318\nAll right, so what we did is we went ahead\nand we typed in the email address and\n\n236\n00:12:47.318 --> 00:12:50.280\nthe password and\nwe're gonna go ahead and click OK here.\n\n237\n00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:54.140\nAnd it's gonna reach out to the Internet\nand it's essentially contacting\n\n238\n00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:58.828\nthe Microsoft Intune platform and\nit's gonna communicate with it and\n\n239\n00:12:58.828 --> 00:13:02.970\nhopefully what we're gonna end up\nseeing is the device is gonna connect.\n\n240\n00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:07.950\nIt's gonna realize that the MS Intune\nplatform's been set to the MDM or\n\n241\n00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:10.790\nthe mobile device management authority and\nwe're gonna\n\n242\n00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:15.850\nsee that it's gonna start to enroll that\ndevice and once it rolls that device.\n\n243\n00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:20.960\nAll right, you can see it now says\nconnect to the company network and\n\n244\n00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.939\nit's gonna say install the management app.\n\n245\n00:13:24.382 --> 00:13:29.330\nAll right, now we'll go ahead and\nwe'll let that churn along here and\n\n246\n00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:32.500\nits gonna give the ability and what's\nkind of interesting is I would almost be\n\n247\n00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:36.710\nwilling to bet that it's gonna say,\nyou need the company portal, right?\n\n248\n00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:38.350\nI've already installed\nthe company portal so\n\n249\n00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.700\nthe good thing is we don't\nhave to worry about that.\n\n250\n00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:44.230\nSo it is still good to see that this\nis what you would be looking for\n\n251\n00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:46.320\nin the Windows store,\nlike I said I went ahead and\n\n252\n00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.430\nsaved us a little bit of that trouble\nhere, so we don't have to worry about it,\n\n253\n00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.470\nand it's letting me know\nthat I already own this app.\n\n254\n00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:54.320\nSo we'll go ahead and\njust kinda drag this off the screen and\n\n255\n00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.200\nwe'll get back to that company portal.\n\n256\n00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.340\nAnd let me go ahead and close that\ndown and then I'll relaunch it and\n\n257\n00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:02.100\nhopefully it'll re-establish\nthe connection.\n\n258\n00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:05.150\nAll right, now, it's connecting to\nthe service, it's probably gonna ask me to\n\n259\n00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:08.980\ntype a password again cuz it's really\nchallenging me here on the whole typing\n\n260\n00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:13.270\nabilities, and I know I shoulda let\nthat keep that keep me signed in, check.\n\n261\n00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:18.535\nAll right, so we'll try this again and\nif I do this two or\n\n262\n00:14:18.535 --> 00:14:22.155\nthree times in a row correctly Mike we\nmight have to play the lottery tonight.\n\n263\n00:14:22.155 --> 00:14:24.295\n>> We may have to start\ncalling you a typer.\n\n264\n00:14:24.295 --> 00:14:27.875\n>> No don't do that,\nyou don't know me very well, obviously.\n\n265\n00:14:27.875 --> 00:14:31.035\nAlright, so we got another beep there,\n\n266\n00:14:31.035 --> 00:14:36.585\nI'm hoping that I typed the password\nin correctly and that is in, correctly.\n\n267\n00:14:36.585 --> 00:14:40.060\n[LAUGH] And then what we're gonna\nsee is hopefully that now that\n\n268\n00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:43.330\nwe've gone through\nthe process of reaching out.\n\n269\n00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:48.318\nYou can see sure enough my\ndevice is enrolled inside of\n\n270\n00:14:48.318 --> 00:14:55.060\nthe Microsoft InTune Management Platform\nand we can go to using this device.\n\n271\n00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:56.990\nNow you can see my devices, right?\n\n272\n00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:00.090\nThis is letting me know that\nthis device is linked to me,\n\n273\n00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:03.640\nnow there's another option that I could\nhave gone through if I wanted to.\n\n274\n00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.480\nI could have installed\nthe company portal and then said,\n\n275\n00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.081\ndon't add this advice, right?\n\n276\n00:15:08.081 --> 00:15:11.501\nIf this is Mike's surface tablet or\nlet's say Mike or\n\n277\n00:15:11.501 --> 00:15:14.480\nmyself were using this and\nprepping this, right?\n\n278\n00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.890\nFor somebody else, well we don't want to\nlink the device to us, because then it\n\n279\n00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:22.260\nassociates it with us, and a device\ncan only be linked to a single user.\n\n280\n00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.550\nSo what I might want to do is\npre-provision the company portal, right?\n\n281\n00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:30.940\nAnd I said just don't add the device now\nand then we give that out to our end user,\n\n282\n00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:35.150\nwe let them link it up, and\nthey can associate themselves with that.\n\n283\n00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:38.648\nNow the next thing that we're gonna\ndo is we're gonna switch back over to\n\n284\n00:15:38.648 --> 00:15:42.810\nthe Microsoft Intune platform and\nit could take a few minutes.\n\n285\n00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:46.514\nSometimes one of the things that they'll\ntell you is it could take up to about 15\n\n286\n00:15:46.514 --> 00:15:48.431\nminutes or so before the device shows up.\n\n287\n00:15:48.431 --> 00:15:51.322\nDefinitely the case when you're\nprovisioning applications,\n\n288\n00:15:51.322 --> 00:15:54.102\nif you wanna deploy an application\nto a device from the cloud,\n\n289\n00:15:54.102 --> 00:15:57.792\nsometimes they'll tell you that when you\ndo upload your software into the cloud,\n\n290\n00:15:57.792 --> 00:15:59.472\ntakes about a half an hour to show..\n\n291\n00:15:59.472 --> 00:16:02.972\nBut we'll see if we can find it and\nsee if its show up yet, so\n\n292\n00:16:02.972 --> 00:16:07.940\nnow in the Microsoft in tune location\nyou're going to see well wait a second.\n\n293\n00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.680\nI can tell you I've already\ngot a device here, and\n\n294\n00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:14.890\nit's letting me right away know this\ndevice is in compliance so let's go ahead.\n\n295\n00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:16.689\nAnd we're going to go to all devices.\n\n296\n00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:23.330\nAnd sure enough right there\nthe surface now shows up right.\n\n297\n00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.530\nYou can see the Surface RT,\nyou can see mobile, personal.\n\n298\n00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:29.610\nYou can even see the operating\nsystem that's running.\n\n299\n00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:32.840\nAnd you can see\nthe management channel right.\n\n300\n00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:38.490\nNotice that it is now set to Microsoft\nin tune to be The MDM solution.\n\n301\n00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:43.760\nAnd at this point, I have the ability to\ndo some really, really interesting things.\n\n302\n00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:47.890\nI have the ability to create compliance\npolicies, I can create things like\n\n303\n00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:52.440\nconfiguration policies, and\nI can push them out to this device.\n\n304\n00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.700\nBut the thing is,\n\n305\n00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:57.340\nyou have to know some of the roles,\nWho is it that could perform these?\n\n306\n00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:58.760\nCan any user perform this?\n\n307\n00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.440\nThe answer is no.\n\n308\n00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:00.960\nAll right.\n\n309\n00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:06.040\nNow, before we start talking about some of\nthe configurations inside of the Intune\n\n310\n00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:11.270\ninterface that you could do, it is\ngood to be familiar with these roles.\n\n311\n00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:14.870\nWe have a series of administrative\nroles that you have to be aware of and\n\n312\n00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:18.400\nI would be aware of for\nthe exam just in case they ask you.\n\n313\n00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.770\nWe've got a series of\nadministrations which you can see,\n\n314\n00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:22.400\nyou see the tenant administrator.\n\n315\n00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.930\nWe've got a global administrator,\na billing administrator,\n\n316\n00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:31.000\nthe service support administrator,\npassword administrator.\n\n317\n00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.070\nAnd then there's one that's not up there\nand I will go ahead and mention this and\n\n318\n00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:35.000\nwe'll see it too.\n\n319\n00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.370\nThere's also one that's called\nthe user management administrator, so.\n\n320\n00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:41.600\nA lot of administrators right [LAUGH] So\nlet's see,\n\n321\n00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.300\nlet's try to make some sense out of this.\n\n322\n00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.790\nNow the tenant administrators kinda\neasy to understand what the tenant\n\n323\n00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:47.710\nadministrator is right?\n\n324\n00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:52.140\nThe tenant administrator is whoever sets\nup your in tuning subscription in fact for\n\n325\n00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:55.140\nthat matter whoever sets up any of your Or\n\n326\n00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:58.610\nMicrosoft cloud based solutions\nbecomes the tenant administrator, and\n\n327\n00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:04.400\nthey have control over subscriptions,\nand additional purchases.\n\n328\n00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.830\nThey also become kind of two roles here.\n\n329\n00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:11.070\nThey also become what is known as your\nfirst global administrator as well, and\n\n330\n00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:13.110\nthat is the one we really want to look at.\n\n331\n00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:18.420\nMicrosoft recommends that if once you\nlog in with your tenant administrator\n\n332\n00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:21.530\nto go ahead and\ncreate you a global administrator,\n\n333\n00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.590\nkind of like principle of least privilege,\nright,\n\n334\n00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:27.680\nwe don't wanna have too much power when\nthe person that is a global administrator\n\n335\n00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.720\nreally can do everything that you\nneed inside of the in tune console.\n\n336\n00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:35.360\nBut not necessarily move over to\nlet's say Office 365 or Asure and\n\n337\n00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.850\nstart messing around with those\nservices if you don't want them to.\n\n338\n00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:42.190\nThey have access, as you can see,\nto all the features inside\n\n339\n00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:46.780\nof your Intune admin console.\n\n340\n00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.080\nThey can assign other\nadministrative roles.\n\n341\n00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:54.580\nNow, let's be careful on this one\nbecause they're the only ones\n\n342\n00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:58.370\nnext to the tentative administrator that\ncan perform act of direct synchronization.\n\n343\n00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:59.920\nThat's a big deal,\n\n344\n00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:04.090\nsynchronizing those identity from those\non premise accounts up into the cloud.\n\n345\n00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:07.660\nSo that is one thing that sets them\napart from all the other administrators.\n\n346\n00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:10.700\nAnd a company can have multiple\nglobal administrators.\n\n347\n00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:13.500\nIf Mike is the tenant administrator,\nMike may say Wes,\n\n348\n00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.240\nI want you to be the global\nadministrator or the other way around.\n\n349\n00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.910\nI am the tenant administrator I might say,\n\n350\n00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:21.480\nI need somebody to do all of these task,\nbut I certainly do not want to give Wes\n\n351\n00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:24.630\naccess to my tenant administrator account\nso I make him a global administrator.\n\n352\n00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:28.244\nNow he has access to all of\nthe administrative capabilities inside of\n\n353\n00:19:28.244 --> 00:19:30.810\nthe (00:21) console All right.\n\n354\n00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:33.200\nNext one what we have is\nthe billing administrator.\n\n355\n00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.575\nYou imagine they might be\nable to make purchases.\n\n356\n00:19:35.575 --> 00:19:37.720\n[LAUGH] Hence, the billing capabilities.\n\n357\n00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:43.130\nThey can also manage the subscriptions and\nfor support tickets and also\n\n358\n00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:47.980\nservice health, if I could spell health\nright, that would definitely help out.\n\n359\n00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:51.570\nBut remember, this is a cloud-based\nsolution so you need to know what is\n\n360\n00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:54.610\nthe current service provide,\nand then they can see that.\n\n361\n00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:58.220\nAnd if you have any disputes on SLAs or\nanything like that,\n\n362\n00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:01.330\nthey'll at least be able\nto see that information.\n\n363\n00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:04.690\nNow the next one we have is\nthe password administrator.\n\n364\n00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:08.170\nAnd be careful, I have to say,\nkind of an exam alert on this one.\n\n365\n00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:12.780\nMicrosoft's might test you whether\nyou know these roles or not.\n\n366\n00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:15.480\nSo notice it says resets passwords,\n\n367\n00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:20.090\nbut it can reset all users passwords and\nother password administrators.\n\n368\n00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:23.135\nThe building administrator Trader and\nI'm to go to an administrator and\n\n369\n00:20:23.135 --> 00:20:25.015\ncertainly not to tenant administrator.\n\n370\n00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:27.255\nAnd I don't know, but\nyou gonna show up on the example.\n\n371\n00:20:27.255 --> 00:20:29.275\nThat's definitely a little\nbit of a tricky question.\n\n372\n00:20:29.275 --> 00:20:30.975\nI would pay attention to that one day.\n\n373\n00:20:30.975 --> 00:20:36.345\nAnd they can also monitor service\nrequest as well as health request.\n\n374\n00:20:36.345 --> 00:20:39.705\nJust when you thought we were done with\nAdministrative roles, wait there's more.\n\n375\n00:20:39.705 --> 00:20:40.605\nWe've got some more here.\n\n376\n00:20:40.605 --> 00:20:44.610\nWe've got also the Service Support\nAdministrator managing Support Tickets.\n\n377\n00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:46.800\nView organizational and user information.\n\n378\n00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:47.720\nIt's read-only though.\n\n379\n00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.720\nThey can view that information, but\nthey can't modify the information.\n\n380\n00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.760\nAnd they can also monitor\nthe service health.\n\n381\n00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.240\nNow one of the last ones that\nI do wanna make mention of,\n\n382\n00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:00.090\ncuz this might come up,\nthe ability to reset passwords, all right?\n\n383\n00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:03.630\nNotice that the password administrator\ncould reset passwords, but\n\n384\n00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:07.760\nthey can could also reset passwords\non a password administrator.\n\n385\n00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:11.360\nThis user management administrator's\na little bit different, right?\n\n386\n00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.760\nThey can manage user groups and\naccounts, they can reset passwords,\n\n387\n00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.700\nbut not on administrators, right?\n\n388\n00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:21.425\nAnd again, they can monitor service self\nand monitor Monitor your service request.\n\n389\n00:21:21.425 --> 00:21:25.935\nSo now that you've got a little bit of\nan idea of who the administrators are and\n\n390\n00:21:25.935 --> 00:21:28.705\nwhat they do,\nlet's jump over to the in tune console and\n\n391\n00:21:28.705 --> 00:21:31.845\nsee where is it that we're\ngonna actually configure these.\n\n392\n00:21:31.845 --> 00:21:34.175\nNow there's a couple of different\nplaces that you can do this.\n\n393\n00:21:34.175 --> 00:21:37.215\nYou can do this in\nthe office admin center.\n\n394\n00:21:37.215 --> 00:21:39.605\nLike I could choose add user if I wanted.\n\n395\n00:21:39.605 --> 00:21:42.770\nAnd I could come in here and\nI could create a new user\n\n396\n00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:46.470\nmaybe I wanted to create a user for\none of our other hosts here.\n\n397\n00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:48.360\nMaybe Mr. Ronnie Wong, right?\n\n398\n00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:49.390\nDisplay name,\n\n399\n00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:54.140\nuser name, we'll just keep it our simple\nnaming convention that we use here.\n\n400\n00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:56.128\nRemember the location too,\ncuz that's important.\n\n401\n00:21:56.128 --> 00:21:59.710\nRemember this cloud-based service,\nlocation, location, location,\n\n402\n00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:02.770\nit is important there, and\nthen contact information.\n\n403\n00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:08.430\nAnd what I really wanna show you guys\nare Well, the administrative roles, right?\n\n404\n00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:11.870\nIf we look at these administrative roles\nyou can see user has no administrative\n\n405\n00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:13.090\naccess, right?\n\n406\n00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:17.380\nGlobal administrator, and here's another\none I would be careful with, maybe on\n\n407\n00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:22.050\nthe exam, because if you get a text-based\nanswer that doesn't show you an exhibit,\n\n408\n00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:25.160\nor maybe it does show you a screenshot,\nsays which one of these you click.\n\n409\n00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.930\nWell, if I wanna set\na billing administrator,\n\n410\n00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:31.020\nI can't do it just from clicking one\nof these radio buttons by themselves.\n\n411\n00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.770\nI have to go to a customized\nadministrator and\n\n412\n00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:37.350\nnow here's where you see\nthe additional administrative roles.\n\n413\n00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:41.920\nA couple of extra ones in here, keep in\nmind this is Office 365 we're seeing so\n\n414\n00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.840\nwe have Exchange,\nwe have SharePoint is there.\n\n415\n00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.270\nSkype for business, right,\n\n416\n00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:50.940\nall of the cloud base solutions here\nthat are available in Office 365.\n\n417\n00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:52.960\nAnd I do want to pay attention\nto the product license.\n\n418\n00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.610\nNotice that it says Intune A Direct,\nright?\n\n419\n00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:58.520\nThat means that this user is going to be\n\n420\n00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:03.610\nregardless of the administrator role\nthat I make them or if I do or don't.\n\n421\n00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:05.840\nIt's gonna be also an Intune license and\n\n422\n00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.270\nit's gonna chew through\none of those as well.\n\n423\n00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:09.680\nNow that's not the only place.\n\n424\n00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.500\nLet me go ahead and cancel out of this\nbecause I want to show you that you can\n\n425\n00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:15.700\nalso do this in the Intune\nconsole likewise.\n\n426\n00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:20.620\nThey really would like you, best practice,\nto stay with a single interface.\n\n427\n00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:23.850\nIf you can do an Office 365 you can\nmanage most of your online subscription\n\n428\n00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:25.110\nservices right there.\n\n429\n00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:26.390\nGo ahead and do it there.\n\n430\n00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:28.820\nBut I dont' think that we'd be doing you\nany justice if we didn't show you that you\n\n431\n00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:31.260\ncan do this manually\ninside of Intune as well.\n\n432\n00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:35.700\nNow, on the left hand side going from\nthe Dashboard down to the Groups tile, and\n\n433\n00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:37.260\nyou can't really see it right away.\n\n434\n00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:40.430\nWe kinda scroll over, right?\n\n435\n00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:43.830\nAnd if we scroll over,\nwe've got this Add Users option here.\n\n436\n00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:48.629\nWe choose Ad User, and\nwe can create a user manually.\n\n437\n00:23:48.629 --> 00:23:52.019\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nwe'll log back in.\n\n438\n00:23:52.019 --> 00:23:54.481\nAnd here's our new user.\n\n439\n00:23:54.481 --> 00:23:55.235\nRight?\n\n440\n00:23:55.235 --> 00:23:57.441\nSo if I wanted to create a new user,\nvery easy.\n\n441\n00:23:57.441 --> 00:24:02.310\nMaybe we'll do this one here for\nDon Pezet, one of the other hosts here.\n\n442\n00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:08.288\nAnd display name, we'll just call it\nDon Pezet because I'm that creative.\n\n443\n00:24:08.288 --> 00:24:12.898\nAnd we'll choose D Pezet here.\n\n444\n00:24:12.898 --> 00:24:15.830\nAll right, I think I've used\nall of our other host names.\n\n445\n00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:17.820\nMike, I've already made him\na global administrator.\n\n446\n00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:19.033\nHe doesn't realize it yet, so.\n\n447\n00:24:19.033 --> 00:24:23.910\n[LAUGH] But what I want to show you are,\n\n448\n00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:28.710\nonce we have that name in there,\nwe'll go ahead and choose Next.\n\n449\n00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:35.190\nAll right, and let me just make sure,\nthere we go, additional details.\n\n450\n00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:37.230\nI think we should be good.\n\n451\n00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:39.996\nLet me just double-check everything,\nmake sure all of that's good.\n\n452\n00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:47.640\nAnd I'll try this one more time.\n\n453\n00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:48.800\nIt's giving me a hard time.\n\n454\n00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.340\nI say you can create it manually.\n\n455\n00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:55.443\nEverything looks right but just waiting.\n\n456\n00:25:00.418 --> 00:25:02.755\nSitting here wondering am\nI using the edge browser?\n\n457\n00:25:02.755 --> 00:25:04.540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n458\n00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:07.790\nlet me go ahead real quick and\nsee if I can't just start this over.\n\n459\n00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:11.210\nI've had this time where I don't know if\nit's the Silverlight that gets hung up,\n\n460\n00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:14.020\nby the way your web browser\nhas to have Silverlight.\n\n461\n00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.070\nI probably should say that.\n\n462\n00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:17.800\nThat really helps to connect\nto the in tune console\n\n463\n00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.520\nbecause if you don't have it, you can't.\n\n464\n00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:23.730\nIt could just be a Silverlight thing here,\nbut let's make sure.\n\n465\n00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:24.690\nAgain, we'll start that.\n\n466\n00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:25.580\nNow it's auto filling.\n\n467\n00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:27.050\nIt wasn't auto-populating earlier.\n\n468\n00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:29.200\nSometimes it's the Silverlight.\n\n469\n00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.140\nYou'll notice I'm not really\ngoing to change anything here.\n\n470\n00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:34.060\nAnd I'm going to choose next.\n\n471\n00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:34.990\nAnd there we go, it changes.\n\n472\n00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:36.490\nSo that was a Silverlight hangup.\n\n473\n00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:38.840\nI don't know why it happens,\nbut it does happen.\n\n474\n00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.710\nBecause you can see I\ndidn't change anything.\n\n475\n00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:43.170\nBut for us,\nit's a little bit different here.\n\n476\n00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:45.560\nNotice that it asks us,\n\n477\n00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:50.200\ndo you want this user to have\nadministrator permissions, right?\n\n478\n00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.570\nAnd the default is to say no, right?\n\n479\n00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:55.675\nBut let's go ahead and let's choose yes.\n\n480\n00:25:55.675 --> 00:25:59.880\nAll right, and\nthen we'll scroll down a little bit.\n\n481\n00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:04.396\nAnd here are the rolls that are specific\nto Intune, right we don't see Exchange we\n\n482\n00:26:04.396 --> 00:26:08.916\ndon't see SharePoint because these\nare just centralized, centrally focused or\n\n483\n00:26:08.916 --> 00:26:11.600\nyou might even say just Intune centric.\n\n484\n00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:17.078\nAnd I could maybe I could make\nDawn a password administrator\n\n485\n00:26:17.078 --> 00:26:21.251\nright I could set up\nan alternate email here.\n\n486\n00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:29.451\nAnd we'll go ahead and do that real quick.\n\n487\n00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:36.980\nAll right, remember apparently,\nyou've got to be able to type an email.\n\n488\n00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:40.030\nIt does help if you do\nit in the right format.\n\n489\n00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:44.180\nAnd then select location, and remember,\nlocation is important because, this being\n\n490\n00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:50.890\nsuch a globally reachable platform,\nit is important, and we can choose next.\n\n491\n00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:54.770\nAnd notice here all right,\nit says 96 users.\n\n492\n00:26:55.780 --> 00:27:02.920\nIf I create these in Office 365,\nit counts that number down.\n\n493\n00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:08.170\nSo it doesn't matter if I connect to it\nin Office 365 and I create it created\n\n494\n00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:12.980\nhere on the intune console, either way the\nlicense are all tied to a single account.\n\n495\n00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:14.090\n>> Very good Wes, all right,\n\n496\n00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:20.330\na lot of great information there on how\nwe can manage that Windows RT device.\n\n497\n00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:23.250\nYou know might end up showing up at\nour enterprise, we appreciate that for\n\n498\n00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:24.817\nyou Wes, anything else you wanna add?\n\n499\n00:27:24.817 --> 00:27:27.943\n>> Yeah, you know if I could,\nI've got about two minutes,\n\n500\n00:27:27.943 --> 00:27:31.736\nI just wanna kinda show you just\na couple of the policies themselves.\n\n501\n00:27:31.736 --> 00:27:33.991\n>> Let's do it.\n>> Just to show you where the policies\n\n502\n00:27:33.991 --> 00:27:37.780\nare so they ask you, you gotta create\na policy, where is it that I go?\n\n503\n00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:41.040\nSo we'll go ahead and cancel out of this\nreal quick, and I'll just go ahead and\n\n504\n00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:41.829\nleave this page.\n\n505\n00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:47.195\nIt might be as easy as just saying\nhey look, it's policies, right?\n\n506\n00:27:47.195 --> 00:27:49.800\n[LAUGH] But there are some\nthings that are a little tricky.\n\n507\n00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.700\nThat's why I just want to take\na couple of minutes here.\n\n508\n00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:55.890\nAnd show you guys how bad I type\na password by re-authenticating.\n\n509\n00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:57.830\nWe'll go ahead and do that.\n\n510\n00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:01.940\nAnd by the way guys, I set up Dan Lowrie\nhere as a global administrator.\n\n511\n00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:05.570\nSo I'm not doing any of this\nwork as a tenant administrator.\n\n512\n00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:08.390\nAnd you can notice that I have full run,\nfull capabilities,\n\n513\n00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:10.000\nfull administrative capabilities.\n\n514\n00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.580\nI'm not getting challenge so I'm\nactually practicing what we preach here.\n\n515\n00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.483\nSo I'm setting up\nthe tenant administrator,\n\n516\n00:28:16.483 --> 00:28:20.160\ncreating a global administrator, and\nlogging in as the global administrator.\n\n517\n00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.630\nBut now let's look real\nquick at these policies.\n\n518\n00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:26.400\nAnd I know we're a little\nshort on time here.\n\n519\n00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.520\nBut we've got two different\ntypes of policies.\n\n520\n00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:32.200\nWe got configuration policies and\nwe got compliance policies.\n\n521\n00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.696\nAll right, this is important for\nthe exam to know kinda like what\n\n522\n00:28:35.696 --> 00:28:39.080\nwe talk about in other episodes\nlike active directory right?\n\n523\n00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:42.890\nWe stipulate group policy\nprocessing order right?\n\n524\n00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:46.080\nWe say local site domain ou,\nwhat you need to know,\n\n525\n00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:51.250\nwhat happens when settings are conflicting\nhere to know what applies.\n\n526\n00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:53.680\nUnderstand this, remember this for\nthe exam, all right.\n\n527\n00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.990\nCompliance policies always\ntrump configuration policies.\n\n528\n00:28:56.990 --> 00:29:00.560\nSo if I have a compliance policy that\ndictates your password's gonna be\n\n529\n00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.720\neight characters and\nI have a configuration policy that says\n\n530\n00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:08.128\nyour password can be four characters\nwell eight is more restrictive.\n\n531\n00:29:08.128 --> 00:29:12.490\nAll right, I don't even worry about\nthat because it's a compliance policy,\n\n532\n00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:15.540\ndon't even worry about what's more and\nless restrictive.\n\n533\n00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:17.860\nCompliance policy take precedence.\n\n534\n00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:21.680\nNow, when you're comparing like policies,\n\n535\n00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:25.720\nI've got a configuration policy\nthat says eight character password.\n\n536\n00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:28.960\nI got another configuration\npolicy that says four character.\n\n537\n00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.100\nWell now they're two of the same policies.\n\n538\n00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:33.010\nNow it's the most restrictive.\n\n539\n00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:36.470\nAll right, so\ncompliance trumps configuration.\n\n540\n00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:41.950\nIf you're comparing configuration\nto configuration or compliance\n\n541\n00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:46.870\nto compliance policies it's always the\nmost restrictive setting that wins out.\n\n542\n00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:51.070\nOne of the last things I want you\nto know here, too, is that with\n\n543\n00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:56.460\nyour compliance policies,\nwhen you choose add, all right,\n\n544\n00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:01.280\nyou get this ability to create a template\nand then you can, or from a template,\n\n545\n00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:05.280\nyou can go down here and you can\nmodify some of the different settings.\n\n546\n00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:09.280\nPay attention inside\nof the interface here.\n\n547\n00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:14.280\nNotice these little icons,\nlittle exclamation points.\n\n548\n00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:17.290\nIf I don't know what that setting is for,\n\n549\n00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:21.640\nwhat device it's for, you'll notice\nhere it lets me know right away.\n\n550\n00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:25.540\nThis sets the password requirements for\nAndroid devices.\n\n551\n00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:32.040\nAll right if I make everybody blind here,\nwe scroll down just a little bit right.\n\n552\n00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.070\nEncryption, can I use encryption?\n\n553\n00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:38.430\nWell I'm not sure right,\nso what does it tell me?\n\n554\n00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:44.350\nIt says for Windows phone 8 devices it has\nto be configured in a certain manner so\n\n555\n00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:47.810\nthat's one of the great things about the\npolicies themselves is that they will let\n\n556\n00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:50.570\nyou know what the setting do apply to.\n\n557\n00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:53.790\nI'd say Mike one of the last things\nwanna show you guys of the configuration\n\n558\n00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:57.010\npolicies, when you create a configuration\npolicy you actually have to\n\n559\n00:30:57.010 --> 00:31:01.090\npick the device itself you don't just get\nthis template you start modifying it so\n\n560\n00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:04.660\nif I choose add, notice that I've\ngot a few different options and\n\n561\n00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.770\nit tells me what device are you choosing,\nright?\n\n562\n00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:11.730\nAnd if I expand this out, notice that\nit tells me what these devices are for,\n\n563\n00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:13.140\nwhat these policies are for, right?\n\n564\n00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:14.200\nThis is for Windows 8 phone.\n\n565\n00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.080\nI mean you guys can read that right?\n\n566\n00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:20.620\nWindows 8.1 or later so you can see and\nthen some of these settings aren't going\n\n567\n00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:25.380\nto affect things like RT devices and you'd\nhave to know that just by going through\n\n568\n00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:30.410\nthe settings and if you don't that's the\ngreat thing about the exclamation points.\n\n569\n00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:33.702\nThey will tell you step by step\nkinda like in Active Directory.\n\n570\n00:31:33.702 --> 00:31:35.550\nWell if you don't know\nwhat a policy setting is.\n\n571\n00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:38.650\nThen click the little explain tab that\ngives you nice little breakdown of what\n\n572\n00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:40.960\npolicies do so study those policies.\n\n573\n00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:43.340\nRemember what policies have precedence,\n\n574\n00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:47.640\nunderstand how you connect your\nWindows RT devices to the platform and\n\n575\n00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.900\nthat you can now manage them,\nshould help you on the exam.\n\n576\n00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.710\n>> Fantastic, Wes, appreciate that.\n\n577\n00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:54.350\nGreat demonstrations there.\n\n578\n00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:59.460\nLearning how to manage our Windows RT\ndevices through our Microsoft Intune.\n\n579\n00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.130\nThank you for that, Wes, appreciate it.\n\n580\n00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:02.960\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n581\n00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.470\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n582\n00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:06.250\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n583\n00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:08.757\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n584\n00:32:08.757 --> 00:32:15.050\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:19.706\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\ntoday where doing our MTA mobility and\n\n4\n00:00:19.706 --> 00:00:21.290\ndevice fundamentals.\n\n5\n00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.820\nAnd specifically in this one, we're gonna\nbe looking at the good old Windows Phone,\n\n6\n00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.250\nand how we can manage that\ndevice through Windows Intune.\n\n7\n00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.080\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nWes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.910\nHow you're doing Wes?\n\n9\n00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:32.450\n>> I'm doing good.\n\n10\n00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.690\nI'll tell you what,\nif some of those titles get any longer,\n\n11\n00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.680\nwe'll have a doctoral dissertation\njust in the title alone.\n\n12\n00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.910\n>> All right\n>> That's right.\n\n13\n00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.740\nWe're gonna be diving into\na little bit of Windows Phone.\n\n14\n00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.010\nAnd this one you know, because those\nWindows Phones out they're just flying off\n\n15\n00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.150\nthe shelf every day and they're so\npopular, it's very easy to study on those.\n\n16\n00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:56.070\nSo, we're going to dive in a little\nbit on Windows 8.1 specifically.\n\n17\n00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.310\nMobil, if you will.\n\n18\n00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.170\nAnd we'll also talk a little bit\nabout the Windows 8 mobile phone too,\n\n19\n00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.480\ncuz there are some differences in\nhow you manage those devices and\n\n20\n00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.710\nwhen it comes down to it,\nI'm gonna give you a piece of advice.\n\n21\n00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.310\nYou're gonna wanna upgrade as\nsoon as you can to Windows 8.1\n\n22\n00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.510\nMobile Phone if you have it out\nthere if you haven't already,\n\n23\n00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.610\nand we know that by the taping of\nthis show Windows 10 is out there.\n\n24\n00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.550\nAnd I don't know if they\noffer free upgrades, but\n\n25\n00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.010\nyou can also upgrade out of them.\n\n26\n00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.860\nBut then you upgrade and now you're\nstudying for an exam that asks you\n\n27\n00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.660\nabout Windows 8.1 on my phone and\nyou've got nothing to study with.\n\n28\n00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.250\nSo that's why we hope to do here.\n\n29\n00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.090\nSo the first thing we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna talk a little bit about what\n\n30\n00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.570\nit takes to manage your mobile devices.\n\n31\n00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.240\nAnd we'll start with Windows 8.\n\n32\n00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.100\nAnd I'm gonna wanna say Windows 8 and\nnot mobile or phone, so\n\n33\n00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.550\nI'll try to get that right\nthroughout this episode here.\n\n34\n00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.400\nSo let's go ahead and dive right in and\nlook at Windows Intune.\n\n35\n00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.090\nI'm in the Windows Intune console\nhere at manage.microsoft.com.\n\n36\n00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.210\nI mentioned that URL just in case they\nask you because there are a couple of\n\n37\n00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.135\ndifferent URLs that you use\nto manage your devices.\n\n38\n00:01:58.135 --> 00:01:59.125\nBe familiar with it.\n\n39\n00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:02.845\nThat's the InTune URL just\nin case they ask you.\n\n40\n00:02:02.845 --> 00:02:07.165\nWhat you'll see is most everything is\ngonna be integrated all into Office 365\n\n41\n00:02:07.165 --> 00:02:11.300\ntoday, and you'll be launching off that,\nbut just in case it shows up on the exam.\n\n42\n00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.760\nNow when we start out in the dashboard,\n\n43\n00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.640\nthe first place that we have to\ngo here is the admin section.\n\n44\n00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.460\nAnd the reason we have to go there is\nlike we showed you in the Windows RT\n\n45\n00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.310\nepisode where we had to set\nthe mobile device authority.\n\n46\n00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.300\nA couple of different locations in here.\n\n47\n00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.120\nThe biggest one that we're\ngonna be focused in is\n\n48\n00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.440\nthe Mobile Device Management.\n\n49\n00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.880\nYou can see the Windows devices.\n\n50\n00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.100\nWe can see iOS devices.\n\n51\n00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.150\nThis is where you load up things like your\nAP and your Apple push notifications,\n\n52\n00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.470\ncertificates that you have to\nmanage to manage iOS devices.\n\n53\n00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.920\nSo the one that we're really gonna focus\nin right here is the Windows phone.\n\n54\n00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.680\nNow if we go to this.\n\n55\n00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.980\nIn fact, let me go ahead and\njust recap real quick.\n\n56\n00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.880\nSo going to Mobile Device Management,\nremember that the first thing that you had\n\n57\n00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.950\nto do to use Intune as an MDM solution,\nremember that's an open set of standards.\n\n58\n00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.200\nIt's not open source because\nit certainly isn't free, but\n\n59\n00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.750\nit's an open set of standards and\nthere's collaboration with it.\n\n60\n00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.820\nAnd one of the requirements before\nwe can manage any mobile device,\n\n61\n00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.020\nwe have to set the authority.\n\n62\n00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.480\nIn this case we set the authority\nin the RT episode and go back and\n\n63\n00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.490\ncheck that out if you're not familiar\nwith it we set to Microsoft Intune.\n\n64\n00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.420\nSo we're ready to go there.\n\n65\n00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.850\nHowever, even though we have\nset that mobile authority,\n\n66\n00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.810\nwe don't have any mobile\ndevices in the authority here,\n\n67\n00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.520\nwe have nothing being managed, so\nI kind of wanna go over this a little bit.\n\n68\n00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.220\nNow in the Windows 8,\nthere was some big differences here,\n\n69\n00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.980\nin fact let me go head and\nswitch over here to Windows phone because\n\n70\n00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.060\nthey give you a pretty good\ndescription here of what you need.\n\n71\n00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.660\nNow, first thing you have to do, and\nlet me get up here a little bit better,\n\n72\n00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.080\nis you have to set your\nenrollment server address, right?\n\n73\n00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.370\nYour devices have to find wherever\nthe open MDM solution is.\n\n74\n00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.260\nThey have to be able to resolve the name.\n\n75\n00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.270\nSo you have a few DNS records\nthat you have to set here.\n\n76\n00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.200\nNow, if you're doing like I'm doing here\nand you're gonna let this be a true Cloud\n\n77\n00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.590\nbased solution, well then you don't\nneed to set up your DNS records.\n\n78\n00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.091\nYour DNS records are gonna be set up if\nyou've got on premise and off premise, and\n\n79\n00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:12.860\nI'm sure maybe even integration and\nthings like SCCM.\n\n80\n00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.770\nBut if you're just using Intune and\n\n81\n00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.970\nit's just the Cloud,\nyou don't have to set anything.\n\n82\n00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.710\nIn fact, there's nothing here to answer.\n\n83\n00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:23.890\nIf they do need to do manual enrollment\nthey tell you just manage.microsoft.com.\n\n84\n00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.494\nNow that's the second\ntime that URL's come up.\n\n85\n00:04:26.494 --> 00:04:29.333\nRemember I told you that's how you\nget to the InTUne platform, but\n\n86\n00:04:29.333 --> 00:04:32.327\nit's also where you set your enrollment\nserver address if they need to\n\n87\n00:04:32.327 --> 00:04:35.340\nmanually enter it on any of the devices\nthat you happen to be managing.\n\n88\n00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.740\nSo it is a good thing to know for the exam\non a couple different levels here.\n\n89\n00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:47.340\nThe next thing that we have to do, and\nlet me make this very clear on this one.\n\n90\n00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.640\nNotice it says that it's optional.\n\n91\n00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.980\nIt says, obtain an enterprise ID and\na code signing certificate, all right?\n\n92\n00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.990\nThere's a couple of different things here.\n\n93\n00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.430\nIf you are going to download and\ninstall the company portal\n\n94\n00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.980\non the older Windows 8 phone devices, you\nneed to get a code signing certificate.\n\n95\n00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.800\nAnd this is why I was telling you upgrade\nif you can, because it's a real pain.\n\n96\n00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.090\nIt was a real pain in\nthe Windows 8 mobile phone.\n\n97\n00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.690\nWhy?\n\n98\n00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.490\nBecause what I'd have to do is I'd\nhave to come down here, let's see,\n\n99\n00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:17.680\nI believe it's right here.\n\n100\n00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.600\nAlright, I have to download the app,\ncompany portal app.\n\n101\n00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.585\nBoy, I couldn't underline\nthat a little better.\n\n102\n00:05:24.585 --> 00:05:26.665\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All the way down at the screen!\n\n103\n00:05:26.665 --> 00:05:30.010\n[LAUGH] You'd have to download\nthat installation file.\n\n104\n00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.850\nYou'd have to go out to\na place like Symantec.\n\n105\n00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.360\nIn fact they even,\nI don't know if they're recommended.\n\n106\n00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.980\nHere it is.\n\n107\n00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.650\nThey even kinda put Symantec\nin the list there saying hey,\n\n108\n00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.173\nthey could give you a code\nsigning certificate.\n\n109\n00:05:39.173 --> 00:05:42.140\nSo now I've got to purchase\nthis code signing certificate.\n\n110\n00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.010\nI've got to download a company portal,\nI've got to sign the app.\n\n111\n00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.420\nTake that signature,\n\n112\n00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.230\nmake sure that the root is installed\non all of my Windows 8 devices.\n\n113\n00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.730\nFirst of all,\nI don't trust the signature on it.\n\n114\n00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.440\nThen I can download the company portal and\nwe can start to manage the devices.\n\n115\n00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.120\nSo, a lot of extra set\nup that you have to do.\n\n116\n00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.230\nAnd one of the things that they kind\nof made it a little bit easier and\n\n117\n00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.705\nagain there's gonna be a caveat to that.\n\n118\n00:06:04.705 --> 00:06:06.900\nThere's always got to be a but\nin the way, you know.\n\n119\n00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.640\nNotice on the Windows 8.1 and\n\n120\n00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:15.060\nWindows 10 mobile devices,\nit says install the company portal app.\n\n121\n00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.960\nAll right, well what does that mean?\n\n122\n00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.800\nIt means I don't need the code\nsigning certificate anymore.\n\n123\n00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.900\nYou can go to the Windows store,\n\n124\n00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.340\nyou can sign in with your Microsoft ID,\nWindows web ID, Microsoft account.\n\n125\n00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.150\nDepending on when you\nstarted your account,\n\n126\n00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.650\nyou might have heard\nboth in your lifetime.\n\n127\n00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.730\nYou just have to download the app.\n\n128\n00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:34.970\nIt's already trusted.\n\n129\n00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.660\nNow, again there's also\na caveat to that as well.\n\n130\n00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.380\nYou still need that code\nsigning certificate and\n\n131\n00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.210\nside loading keys if you're gonna side\nload applications on these devices.\n\n132\n00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:50.790\nSo you don't need it to install\nthe initial company portal app like\n\n133\n00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.490\nyou did on the Windows 8 devices.\n\n134\n00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.910\nBut if you're gonna do side loading, if\nyou're gonna bypass the Windows store, and\n\n135\n00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.130\nyou're gonna Sideloads of\ncompany business apps.\n\n136\n00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.490\nMike says, hey Wes, I just finished\ndeveloping this application.\n\n137\n00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.410\nWe need to deploy it through\nour entire infrastructure.\n\n138\n00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.730\nI'm gonna say, okay Mike, I need to go\nout and get a code signing certificate.\n\n139\n00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.600\nI need to be able to\nsign that application,\n\n140\n00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.150\nand I also need something\nknown as a sideloading key.\n\n141\n00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:16.190\nNow the sideloading key, this is\nanother one that's kind of interesting.\n\n142\n00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:20.600\nBecause our Windows mobile devices are so\npopular out there they've made\n\n143\n00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.290\nit very difficult to be able to\ninstall applications on them.\n\n144\n00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:25.967\nYou need what's known as\na side loading key and\n\n145\n00:07:25.967 --> 00:07:27.989\nthat's only available to\nvolume licensed customers.\n\n146\n00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:31.925\nMaybe you've seen some of the other series\nthat we have out there when you want to\n\n147\n00:07:31.925 --> 00:07:33.294\nbypass the Windows store.\n\n148\n00:07:33.294 --> 00:07:38.117\nYou want to directly install a line\nof business app you need what is\n\n149\n00:07:38.117 --> 00:07:40.230\nknown as a side loading key.\n\n150\n00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:44.550\nAs a recap, I don't need that key\nto download the company portal.\n\n151\n00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:48.828\nNow, I went ahead and I did that\nbeforehand, so lets go ahead and\n\n152\n00:07:48.828 --> 00:07:52.807\nshow you what that looks like\nover here on our mobile phone.\n\n153\n00:07:52.807 --> 00:07:54.302\nNow, if you want to see it, guys,\n\n154\n00:07:54.302 --> 00:07:56.531\nsome of you have probably\nbeen to the store before.\n\n155\n00:07:56.531 --> 00:07:57.954\nYou can see, here is the store.\n\n156\n00:07:57.954 --> 00:07:59.177\nI click on the store.\n\n157\n00:07:59.177 --> 00:08:00.058\nWhat am I gonna do?\n\n158\n00:08:00.058 --> 00:08:05.560\nI'm gonna go in and I'm gonna find my\nlittle icon here and I'm gonna type out.\n\n159\n00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.550\nDefinitely not, we're not going\nto Facebook, I promise you guys.\n\n160\n00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.720\nWhat kind of episode is this, right?\n\n161\n00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.220\nLet's see if I can type here.\n\n162\n00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:12.720\nCompany.\n\n163\n00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:20.040\nAnd let's see how far I have to\ntype before it recognizes it.\n\n164\n00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.980\nThere we go.\n\n165\n00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:22.770\nAnd company portal.\n\n166\n00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.660\nNow it's gonna search through there,\nand you can see it's already installed.\n\n167\n00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:30.366\nI went ahead and saved us some time there,\nso because you don't need all the extra\n\n168\n00:08:30.366 --> 00:08:33.650\nsteps there Mike, I figure you guys\nknow how to install applications.\n\n169\n00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:37.550\nProbably most of you have been doing\na mobile device store at some point and\n\n170\n00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:38.980\ndownloaded an app.\n\n171\n00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:43.300\nAnd you can look through here, guys,\nthere's a lot of information here,\n\n172\n00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.560\nsome introductory information\nthat you can see here and\n\n173\n00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.350\nit also talks about the permissions.\n\n174\n00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:50.410\nKeep in mind, in fact Meg and\n\n175\n00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:54.030\nI were talking about this before\nwe even started the episode.\n\n176\n00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:55.480\nWhat is this mobile device?\n\n177\n00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.290\nIf i'm gonna set my device up,\nwhat has to go on?\n\n178\n00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:01.710\nWell there's a lot of permissions that\nMDM needs, and you need to opt into that.\n\n179\n00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:04.160\nIt's not something that you can\nbring your phone in the company and\n\n180\n00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.695\nall of the sudden,\nmagically it starts working.\n\n181\n00:09:06.695 --> 00:09:08.115\nCheck the permissions out.\n\n182\n00:09:08.115 --> 00:09:10.085\nCheck what you're getting yourself into.\n\n183\n00:09:10.085 --> 00:09:14.075\nCuz I can tell you that when Windows Into\ngets its hands into your phone,\n\n184\n00:09:14.075 --> 00:09:17.495\nit's a little difficult to get it out\nwithout some kind of administrative\n\n185\n00:09:17.495 --> 00:09:19.350\nprivilege on that phone.\n\n186\n00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:23.380\nAll right, so again, you can see\nsome of the different information,\n\n187\n00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.360\nif you'd like to read through that.\n\n188\n00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.340\nNow I went ahead, and I've already\ninstalled it, so let's go ahead and\n\n189\n00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.690\ngo back to that application here.\n\n190\n00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.880\nWe could have just hit the Home button and\nmade it easier.\n\n191\n00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.050\nAnd now we've got the Company Portal,\nall right.\n\n192\n00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.900\nNow the first time you log\ninto the company portal or\n\n193\n00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.610\nyou launch it up your\ngonna have to sign in.\n\n194\n00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:44.780\nWere probably gonna see that\nI have to sign in here.\n\n195\n00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:48.500\nI try to save my passwords because my\ntyping abilities are impeccable here,\n\n196\n00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:52.130\nbut no it looks like I tell\nyou what Let's go ahead.\n\n197\n00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:56.400\nAll right and I'm a glutton for punishment\nhere so I'm gonna go ahead and sign in and\n\n198\n00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.990\nlet's see if it saved my pass\nprobably saved my password too.\n\n199\n00:09:58.990 --> 00:09:59.620\nIt won't show you.\n\n200\n00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.640\nSo you're gonna get a log in screen.\n\n201\n00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.180\nThere we go.\n\n202\n00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.630\nAll right so here's your log in screen.\n\n203\n00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:07.050\nYou can see the Company Portal,\nwell what is the Company Portal?\n\n204\n00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:10.710\nWell this is the application that\nbasically your users are gonna see\n\n205\n00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:14.730\nto look to the applications that maybe\nyou've provisioned, look at the devices\n\n206\n00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:18.060\nthat they've got directly linked to\ntheir own account inside of Intune.\n\n207\n00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.850\nSo we'll go ahead here and we'll sign in.\n\n208\n00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:24.755\nAnd apparently I don't know\nhow to push a button neither.\n\n209\n00:10:24.755 --> 00:10:27.490\n[LAUGH] We'll get signed in here now.\n\n210\n00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:29.200\nWhen you initially sign in,\n\n211\n00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.220\nall right, notice it says right\nhere it says, my company, right?\n\n212\n00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:38.070\nIf I switch back over to my\nIntune you can see all the way up\n\n213\n00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:42.760\nhere in the upper right hand corner,\nthere's my company.\n\n214\n00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:47.230\nSo I can see that it's communicating with\nthe company right going out the gate,\n\n215\n00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:47.960\nall right?\n\n216\n00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.140\nSo we should be ready, right?\n\n217\n00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.250\nI should be able to just deploy\npolicies to this device.\n\n218\n00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:53.110\nAnd we're good to go.\n\n219\n00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:54.380\n>> Of course.\n\n220\n00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:55.050\n>> Of course, right?\n\n221\n00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:55.640\n>> Yes.\n\n222\n00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:56.760\n>> No.\n\n223\n00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.815\nWe have to enroll the device here.\n\n224\n00:10:58.815 --> 00:11:01.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because we have to opt into this right?\n\n225\n00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.490\nThat would be what a virus does,\n\n226\n00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:06.257\nright, if you walk into a building all\nof a sudden it's taking control of your\n\n227\n00:11:06.257 --> 00:11:09.015\ndevice.I mean we call those root kits for\nthe last time I looked at it.\n\n228\n00:11:09.015 --> 00:11:10.365\nThis is not a root kit, okay.\n\n229\n00:11:10.365 --> 00:11:12.512\nAt least what we'll say it's not.\n\n230\n00:11:12.512 --> 00:11:16.845\n[LAUGH] So let's go ahead and show you how\nyou would go about enrolling this device.\n\n231\n00:11:16.845 --> 00:11:22.040\nNow if we just swipe to the left, to the\nright, whichever way you wanna say that.\n\n232\n00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.630\nYou'll just choose this Tap to Enroll,\nall right.\n\n233\n00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:29.070\nNow when you tap to enroll,\nunderstand that you logged in first to\n\n234\n00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:32.080\nthe Company Portal to see if you\neven have an account, all right?\n\n235\n00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.290\nYou also have to have the ability\nto enroll the device.\n\n236\n00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.360\nAnd that's why it's\nimportant to set Intune up\n\n237\n00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.080\nas the Mobile Device Management authority,\nright?\n\n238\n00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.880\nI can log in to the company\nportal all I want, but\n\n239\n00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.400\nI'm not gonna be able to enroll\nthe device if that isn't set.\n\n240\n00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.970\nSo that's already been done for us.\n\n241\n00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.120\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nwe'll choose add the account.\n\n242\n00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.730\nNow, when I add the account,\nwe'll go ahead and do this real quick and\n\n243\n00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:57.005\nlike I said, you guys will get\na quick example of how bad I type.\n\n244\n00:11:57.005 --> 00:12:02.290\n[LAUGH] Alright, so we go ahead and\nget that logged in.\n\n245\n00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:07.200\nAnd anytime guys, you out there, if you\nsee on Microsoft, that should be your\n\n246\n00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:13.100\nfirst telltale sign that Microsoft is\nmanaging all of this in the background,\n\n247\n00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:19.000\nthe DNS that we talked about,\nthe storage, all the user accounts.\n\n248\n00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.630\nSo we set them up and\nwe let them manage the infrastructure.\n\n249\n00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:25.050\nAll right, so we'll see how that does.\n\n250\n00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:29.000\nWe'll get logged in here\nas old Dominic Santini.\n\n251\n00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.670\nIf you can see up here towards\nthe top it does say that, hey,\n\n252\n00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:32.710\nwe're looking for your settings.\n\n253\n00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:36.232\nSo right now it's contacting\nthe Intune platform.\n\n254\n00:12:36.232 --> 00:12:38.830\nIt's gonna say okay,\nwell I think we've found you.\n\n255\n00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:43.640\nWe know you're there, but\nwe still need you to authenticate, right.\n\n256\n00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:47.928\nAgain you still need to authenticate to\nenroll your device into the platform.\n\n257\n00:12:47.928 --> 00:12:54.140\nSo it's gonna tell me we'll get all\nDominic Santini signed in here.\n\n258\n00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.730\nI don't know if anybody caught that one.\n\n259\n00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:58.455\nWe'll see if anybody catches\nthe Easter egg out there.\n\n260\n00:12:58.455 --> 00:13:01.880\n[LAUGH]\nYes,\n\n261\n00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:06.050\nI am a child of the 80s and\nthat is all the clue you're gonna get.\n\n262\n00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:10.920\nAll right.\n\n263\n00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.010\nI completely forgot.\n\n264\n00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:16.890\nLet's try that one more time.\nIn fact, it probably would be easier if I\n\n265\n00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:18.780\njust picked this up, so\nbear with me, guys, here.\n\n266\n00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:21.500\nLet me go ahead and get signed into this.\n\n267\n00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:26.240\nYou guys might even see\nthe password out there.\n\n268\n00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:33.500\nThis is a super-secret Microsoft\npassword that is very very hard to crack\n\n269\n00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:41.365\nwhich is why we don't want to show you\nit except for character by character.\n\n270\n00:13:41.365 --> 00:13:43.500\n[LAUGH] It's not dots,\nI guarantee you that.\n\n271\n00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.290\nSo hopefully that's gonna get set up,\nall right.\n\n272\n00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:48.320\nNow it's saying wait a second.\n\n273\n00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.380\nSign in again.\n\n274\n00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.920\nOkay, we'll just tell Microsoft,\nyes that's what we meant to do.\n\n275\n00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.990\nAnd you can say,\nhey we found them all right.\n\n276\n00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.650\nSo what does it say?\n\n277\n00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:58.030\nYou've successfully, In fact let\nme kind of zoom in on this here.\n\n278\n00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:01.270\nYou've successfully added your account.\n\n279\n00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:03.920\nChanges to your company policy\nwill usually be applied\n\n280\n00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.262\nto your phone within the next hour.\n\n281\n00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:09.850\nAll right, well this episode I\npromise you isn't going to be an hour.\n\n282\n00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:13.740\nSo we You need to speed things up a little\nbit so you can see what's going on here.\n\n283\n00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.370\nSo we're gonna go ahead and do that, Mike.\n\n284\n00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:18.510\nWe're certainly not gonna wait\nan hour here and we'll say done.\n\n285\n00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:22.830\nAll right,\nnow a couple of things here guys.\n\n286\n00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:25.820\nYou'll see here a confirmation,\nI can tell it's enrolled.\n\n287\n00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.510\nIt tells me it's enrolled.\n\n288\n00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:35.300\nBut I would bet you anything, if I back\nout of this, look what it says, all right?\n\n289\n00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:36.640\nThat's not a problem, guys.\n\n290\n00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:40.550\nHere's how you handle that, all right?\n\n291\n00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:43.600\nShut it down, launch it back up.\n\n292\n00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.870\nIt's gonna reconnect and it's gonna say,\nokay I found that device.\n\n293\n00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.500\nThat device is now linked to your account.\n\n294\n00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.130\nOkay, we see that it's enrolled.\n\n295\n00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:51.500\nAnd that should go away.\n\n296\n00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.970\nHopefully, that's what\nwe're looking at here.\n\n297\n00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.460\nSo let's go ahead and!\n\n298\n00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.620\nThis device is either not enrolled or\nit can't be identified.\n\n299\n00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:01.240\nI'll tell you what.\n\n300\n00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:01.950\nHere's another thing, and\n\n301\n00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:04.720\nthis is actually good troubleshooting\nright here on the screen to do.\n\n302\n00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.170\nLet me go and sign back in here.\n\n303\n00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.480\n>> These are learning moments.\n\n304\n00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.090\n>> It is.\n\n305\n00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:10.810\n>> Right there.\n\n306\n00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:13.520\n>> And let me tell you why,\nbecause when you enroll a device,\n\n307\n00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.910\nit has Just like anything with\nan active directory, right?\n\n308\n00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:17.380\nIt has an identity.\n\n309\n00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:21.510\nAll right, Mike, you know what happens,\nif you image a machine and\n\n310\n00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:26.240\nyou apply that image to multiple machines\nand you go to join it to active directory,\n\n311\n00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.090\nwhat ends up happening?\n\n312\n00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:29.540\n>> You're gonna run in to\nsome duplication issues.\n\n313\n00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:30.100\nThat's right.\n\n314\n00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.600\nSo what happened with this\none is it did the same thing.\n\n315\n00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.620\nIt's no different, right?\n\n316\n00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:37.460\nIf I need to make sure all identifiers\nare unique, just like in active directory.\n\n317\n00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.980\nSo what I did earlier is I went ahead and\nprovisioned this device, right?\n\n318\n00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:41.759\nBut I didn't change its identity.\n\n319\n00:15:41.759 --> 00:15:45.538\nSo when I retire the device which we'll\nshow you coming up, I'm trying to add\n\n320\n00:15:45.538 --> 00:15:49.512\nthe device back, and it's saying wait,\nwe've already seen this device once.\n\n321\n00:15:49.512 --> 00:15:53.300\nSo what I gotta do is I gotta\ngenerate a new identifier for that.\n\n322\n00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.391\nLet me show you how you can do that.\n\n323\n00:15:54.391 --> 00:15:57.081\nSo we're gonna go ahead and sign back in.\n\n324\n00:15:57.081 --> 00:15:59.776\nAll right, and when I sign in,\n\n325\n00:15:59.776 --> 00:16:05.400\none of the things I can do is\nan enrollment with a new identifier.\n\n326\n00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:09.689\nJust by clicking a button here that allows\nyou to change the identity of the device.\n\n327\n00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:13.450\nAlright and to do that.\n\n328\n00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:15.910\nIt looks like maybe it\njust needed a refresh or\n\n329\n00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:19.830\njust a reboot cuz it's actually,\nit's gonna let me sign in, so.\n\n330\n00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.949\nBut let me see if I can show\nyou that here real quick.\n\n331\n00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:25.980\nAnd no, unfortunately, I can't.\n\n332\n00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:28.530\nIt worked, and\nnow it fixed itself and it's fine.\n\n333\n00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:33.470\nBut, let me tell you right here,\nif you get that error when you go\n\n334\n00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.830\nto enroll your device,\nthis little ellipses right here.\n\n335\n00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:42.740\nAt the top there will be an enroll\nwith a changed identifier.\n\n336\n00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.060\nAnd that's exactly what it is.\n\n337\n00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:47.820\nIt's saying, well wait a second we\nalready see this device inside of Intune,\n\n338\n00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:51.520\nand now you're trying to re enroll\na device that you just currently retired.\n\n339\n00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.810\nWell which is it man?\n\n340\n00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:53.440\nGet it right.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n341\n00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.670\n>> Is essentially what it's saying.\n\n342\n00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:56.420\nSo right here in this screen you can see,\n\n343\n00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:59.310\nyou can click it,\nit just changes the unique identifier.\n\n344\n00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:01.510\nAnd then it contacts\nthe Intune platform and\n\n345\n00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:05.500\nwhen Intune sees it says,\nI've never seen this device before.\n\n346\n00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:09.988\nSo basically like me putting a fake\nmustache on and then saying who are you?\n\n347\n00:17:09.988 --> 00:17:10.513\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n348\n00:17:10.513 --> 00:17:11.198\n>> Essentially, so\n\n349\n00:17:11.198 --> 00:17:15.120\nit looks like a reboot of a I was\nactually hoping to show you guys that,\n\n350\n00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.910\nbecause it is my side,\nit's a good troubleshooter to do.\n\n351\n00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:21.010\nSo now my device is enrolled.\n\n352\n00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:23.690\nLet's see what it looks like\nin the in tune platform here.\n\n353\n00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:25.180\nLet's go ahead.\nIt's probably gonna ask me\n\n354\n00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:26.840\nto re-authenticate here.\n\n355\n00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:28.560\nIt usually does.\n\n356\n00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:31.640\nJust for protection,\nyou know, walked away.\n\n357\n00:17:33.618 --> 00:17:41.280\nAnd we'll go ahead and try to sign back\nin with our super-secret password.\n\n358\n00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.780\nAll right, so we get signed back in.\n\n359\n00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:45.980\nAnd the next place that\nwe're gonna go to is groups.\n\n360\n00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:51.270\nWe started out in admin, right,\nto get the Intune console, load it up.\n\n361\n00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.290\nNow we gotta get back\ninto the Intune console.\n\n362\n00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:55.277\nWe're gonna go where\nthis device is located.\n\n363\n00:17:57.735 --> 00:18:01.070\nAll right, it is taking its time.\n\n364\n00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:02.090\nThere we go, there we go.\n\n365\n00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:04.450\nJust gotta be a little bit patient.\n\n366\n00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:07.806\nI think somebody told me once the faster\ncomputers get, the more impatient I get.\n\n367\n00:18:07.806 --> 00:18:10.560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't know who that was.\n\n368\n00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.785\nBut I can tell you, he was right.\n\n369\n00:18:12.785 --> 00:18:14.480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Words of wisdom.\n\n370\n00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.090\nOkay, so diving back in here guys.\n\n371\n00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:19.450\nWe're gonna be over under groups.\n\n372\n00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:24.540\nSo, little tile here on the left-hand\nside, I'm gonna go ahead and click that.\n\n373\n00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:27.380\nNow I haven't grouped\nthis device together.\n\n374\n00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.790\nIf you need to create devices,\ngo back and check our episodes for\n\n375\n00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:32.330\ncreating groups and everything.\n\n376\n00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:35.240\nWell I wanna show you what\nthe device looks like inside.\n\n377\n00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.560\nSo mobile devices.\n\n378\n00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:41.980\nAll right, and I can see all the way over\nhere on the right-hand side that I've got,\n\n379\n00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:43.300\nthe device is there, right?\n\n380\n00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:45.130\nI can see that it's got\nthat little quick link, and\n\n381\n00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:46.730\nif I wanted to click on it I could.\n\n382\n00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:49.500\nBut you could also go to\ndevices up here at the top.\n\n383\n00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:51.720\nRight and up here I click devices.\n\n384\n00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:55.830\nI can click devices.\n\n385\n00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:58.440\nAll right, [LAUGH] and\nI get this unique identifier.\n\n386\n00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:02.000\nAnd you can see it gives\nit some weird name.\n\n387\n00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.860\nIt says that username underscore,\nthen it tells me Windows phone.\n\n388\n00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:09.010\nAnd it also tells me roughly what\ntime it was that I enrolled it.\n\n389\n00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:10.810\nSo you can see the enrollment date.\n\n390\n00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:16.330\nBut if I select this device and\nI just double clicked on it to do that.\n\n391\n00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:18.940\nI still, I now.\n\n392\n00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:22.560\nSee a lot of information\nabout the device right away.\n\n393\n00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.290\nAlerts, policies, no issues,\n\n394\n00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:28.420\nyou can see that software status,\nnothing, no problems here at all.\n\n395\n00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:30.430\nI get the ability that if I wanted, and\n\n396\n00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:33.520\nwe're gonna do this towards the end,\nretire and wipe.\n\n397\n00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.280\nI could do a pass code reset.\n\n398\n00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.180\nYou guys have seen how.\n\n399\n00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.250\nWell I type a password.\n\n400\n00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:39.950\nWhat happens if I forget my password?\n\n401\n00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:42.851\nOut of all the things I've\nlost I miss my mind the most.\n\n402\n00:19:42.851 --> 00:19:43.360\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n403\n00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:47.150\nit's good to be able to get in here and\ndo a password reset if you need to.\n\n404\n00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:48.260\nAnd I can call up Mike.\n\n405\n00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:49.150\nMike's the administrator.\n\n406\n00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:51.920\nAnd say Mike, I don't know for\nthe life of me what my password is.\n\n407\n00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:55.120\nMike can say hold on a second, let's\ngo ahead and get your password reset.\n\n408\n00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.650\nCould take up to about five minutes to\nreach out over there across the internet\n\n409\n00:19:58.650 --> 00:19:59.780\nand make its way down to your phone.\n\n410\n00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:00.960\nNow, I say five minutes.\n\n411\n00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.220\nI've actually seen it happen\nas little as a minute.\n\n412\n00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.320\nSo, just be patient if it\ndoesn't happen right away.\n\n413\n00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.810\nAll right, now I could see\nmore information about this,\n\n414\n00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:10.650\nwhich I really like.\n\n415\n00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:14.960\nI can see the user that uses the phone\nright, I can see the operating system,\n\n416\n00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:18.360\nI can see its current management state,\nI can see that it's active right.\n\n417\n00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:22.380\nI can see well who's it managed by, who\nis the mobile device management authority\n\n418\n00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:26.250\nthat's managing the device, I can see\nit's managed by Microsoft Intune and\n\n419\n00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:28.620\nI can also see he last\nupdate that happened.\n\n420\n00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:32.140\nSo you get a real quick\nheads-up view of information.\n\n421\n00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:35.140\nNow that being said, Mike what do you\nsay we do a little bit of configuration?\n\n422\n00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:36.350\nCuz all we did is enrolled it now.\n\n423\n00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:38.070\nNow it's time to actually\nsee what this does.\n\n424\n00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.400\n>> Yeah let's see how we can\nactually manage these devices.\n\n425\n00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:40.920\n>> Very good.\n\n426\n00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.780\nSo, we're gonna go to policies, all right,\nso the next place in line, now keep in\n\n427\n00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:49.660\nmind that in the artiste episode we told\nyou the difference about the policies,\n\n428\n00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:52.500\nthe difference between a configuration and\na compliance policy.\n\n429\n00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.340\nWe talked about that compliance\npolicies always take precedence\n\n430\n00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.300\nover configuration policies.\n\n431\n00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.850\nBut then if you have two of the same\npolicies like compliance and\n\n432\n00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:02.530\ncompliance, the most\nrestrictive setting wins out.\n\n433\n00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:03.660\nConfiguration, same thing.\n\n434\n00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.840\nIf it's configuration policy and\na configuration policy and there's\n\n435\n00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.090\nconflicting sets just like in Active\nDirectory the resultant set of of policy.\n\n436\n00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:11.340\nThe most restrictive went.\n\n437\n00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.600\nSo let's go ahead and\nsee what that looks like in action.\n\n438\n00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.950\nSo the first thing I am going to do is I\nam going to start out with a compliance\n\n439\n00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:22.600\npolicy and well, we better start off\nwith something because it's blank.\n\n440\n00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:26.220\nI click this little hyperlink\nhere that says add, imagine that.\n\n441\n00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:29.120\nNow you gotta be careful with these\npolicies because these are when it\n\n442\n00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.970\ncomes to the compliance policies they\ndon't give you the ability to change.\n\n443\n00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:36.420\nChoose what the operating system is, what\nthe device is that you're configuring.\n\n444\n00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.700\nWhat you have to do is, I'll show you here\nin a second, is you have to go through and\n\n445\n00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.870\nmake sure,\ngiven the little exclamation points that\n\n446\n00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:46.920\nthis is truly supported by whatever the\ndevice it is that you're trying to manage.\n\n447\n00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.580\nIn this case,\nwe're managing a Windows 8.1 phone.\n\n448\n00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:53.730\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ncall this, we'll call this\n\n449\n00:21:55.700 --> 00:22:00.755\nWindows Phone Compliance Policy\nbecause I am very creative.\n\n450\n00:22:00.755 --> 00:22:02.680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, now I'm gonna go ahead.\n\n451\n00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:06.560\nAnd in the description, I'm gonna set\nout what the policy settings are, and\n\n452\n00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:10.230\nthe reason I do that is just so when we're\non air here and we're trying to configure,\n\n453\n00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:12.710\nwe can tell right away\nwhich ones are which.\n\n454\n00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:13.580\nAll right, so in this one,\n\n455\n00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:17.760\nwhat we're gonna do is we're going to\nallow, and I'll show you guys this.\n\n456\n00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:22.110\nWe're going to allow simple passwords.\n\n457\n00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:29.490\nAnd the character length\nis going to be eight.\n\n458\n00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:31.050\nAnd we're just setting\nthe description here.\n\n459\n00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:37.020\nNow if I really wanted to torture myself,\nI could turn this setting right here on.\n\n460\n00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:39.100\nAnd it would green light\nevery one of these.\n\n461\n00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.130\nIt turned all of them on, and\nthen I'd have to go back and\n\n462\n00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:44.600\nI'd have to pick each one that\nI didn't want or do want.\n\n463\n00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:48.710\nI find it a little bit easier to just\ngo ahead and pick the ones you want.\n\n464\n00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:51.680\nIt's six of one,\nhalf dozen of the other, it depends.\n\n465\n00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.150\nIf you don't wanna do that,\nyou don't have to.\n\n466\n00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:58.700\nAll right now, notice that We got\nsome exclamation points here.\n\n467\n00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:04.626\nAll right, notice that it says\nnot available on RT devices.\n\n468\n00:23:04.626 --> 00:23:05.170\nPay attention to that.\n\n469\n00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:09.250\nPay attention to what\nsettings are applicable for\n\n470\n00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:12.130\nwhatever the device is that\nyou're supporting, and we're not.\n\n471\n00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:15.700\nWorried about RT devices in this episode,\nso we're not worried about that all.\n\n472\n00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:19.900\nSo i'm gonna go ahead,\nrequire a password to unlock.\n\n473\n00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.730\nI'm gonna allow simple passwords,\njust for the demonstration.\n\n474\n00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:25.030\nThat certainly doesn't improve\nyour security by any mean,\n\n475\n00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.450\nbut this isn't a security class.\n\n476\n00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:29.210\nDefinitely, or episode, I should say.\n\n477\n00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:31.404\nAll right, and I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n478\n00:23:31.404 --> 00:23:36.088\nI'm gonna choose whatever the minimum\npassword length that I want, all right.\n\n479\n00:23:36.088 --> 00:23:39.161\nSo I'm gonna go ahead here and\nI'm gonna choose 8.\n\n480\n00:23:39.161 --> 00:23:41.983\nAll right, and I'm just gonna save it.\n\n481\n00:23:41.983 --> 00:23:45.754\nNow, I get the ability, as you could\nsee right here moment I configure this,\n\n482\n00:23:45.754 --> 00:23:49.770\nit's asking me, it says, hey, do you wanna\ngo ahead and deploy this policy now?\n\n483\n00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:50.730\nWell, that's up to you.\n\n484\n00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:53.902\nYou might have change management\nsolution where One of your crew decides\n\n485\n00:23:53.902 --> 00:23:55.782\nthat we are going to configure the policy.\n\n486\n00:23:55.782 --> 00:23:56.798\nI am going to hand it off to Mike.\n\n487\n00:23:56.798 --> 00:23:59.820\nMike is going to check\nthe other said of eyes on it.\n\n488\n00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:03.770\nDid Wes make any typos maybe\ncomparing it to a security policy.\n\n489\n00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:06.470\nOkay I see that matches or it doesn't\nmatch, no we're not going to deploy it,\n\n490\n00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:07.840\nwe're going to reconfigure it.\n\n491\n00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.040\nAgain, you might have a change\nmanagement solution there.\n\n492\n00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.260\nI'm going to go ahead and\nwe're going to live dangerously and\n\n493\n00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:13.920\nwe're going to say yes.\n\n494\n00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.280\nJust make sure that I get there.\n\n495\n00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.870\nNow, the other thing about\ncompliance policies,\n\n496\n00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:21.210\nyou don't deploy them to devices.\n\n497\n00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:22.000\nWell, wait a second here.\n\n498\n00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.720\nAren't you trying to control devices?\n\n499\n00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.640\nYou're controlling the user\nthat logs into the device,\n\n500\n00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.310\nso by proxy you really\nare controlling the device.\n\n501\n00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:31.590\nSo we're going to go ahead and\njust my accounts and ungroup users here.\n\n502\n00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:34.340\nAnd I'll chose OK, and deploy it.\n\n503\n00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:37.110\nNow, there is a way to speed this up.\n\n504\n00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:39.080\nRemember that it did say\nin some of the warnings,\n\n505\n00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:42.940\nit said these settings could take up\nto an hour to deploy to your device.\n\n506\n00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:46.960\nWell, there's a way that you can make\nthis a little bit easier on yourself.\n\n507\n00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:49.720\nYou can click on your\ndevice here on your phone.\n\n508\n00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.340\nSay easier I don't know if it's easier for\nyou or if it's easier for\n\n509\n00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:53.090\nthe administrator.\n\n510\n00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:55.360\nDepends on what side of\nthe tracks you're on.\n\n511\n00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.500\nAnd notice that it tells me so\nfar it says you're in compliance.\n\n512\n00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:01.410\nAll right, well, great,\nI'm in compliance but\n\n513\n00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:03.490\nthat's because the phone\nhasn't checked in, right.\n\n514\n00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:05.270\nWe talk about things like\nActive Directory, right?\n\n515\n00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:09.980\nWe do a, what is it, a GP update/force and\nthat reaches out to the server and\n\n516\n00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:10.960\npulls down those policies.\n\n517\n00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.290\nThat's what we're gonna go ahead and do.\n\n518\n00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:15.460\nAll right, and it says okay,\ncan take a few minutes.\n\n519\n00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:18.130\nAnd it might take a couple minutes here.\n\n520\n00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:19.320\nTo pull this policy down.\n\n521\n00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:22.800\nSo what is happening right now\nis my phone is contacting.\n\n522\n00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:26.480\nGoing out through the great\nWorld Wide Web, the internet out there.\n\n523\n00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:30.300\nIt's contacting Microsoft's Intune and\nthen it's coming back and\n\n524\n00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:35.030\nhopefully we're gonna see that it's\ngonna require me to set a policy here.\n\n525\n00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:37.610\nNow, again, it could take a little bit.\n\n526\n00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:39.940\nIf it does just give it a second here.\n\n527\n00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:45.550\nI'll go ahead and check it again and\nit is a good thing to check your policy,\n\n528\n00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:48.080\njust make sure that\nthe compliance policy is applied.\n\n529\n00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.310\nYou can see here it's there.\n\n530\n00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:51.270\nAnd like I said guys,\n\n531\n00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:54.820\nI put the description in here just to make\nit a little bit easier for us on camera so\n\n532\n00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:58.490\nwe can see what policies, cuz we're gonna\nlook at a couple of conflicts coming up.\n\n533\n00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:01.010\nWe'll see if that policy\nhas taken effect yet.\n\n534\n00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:04.980\nIt certainly doesn't look like it.\n\n535\n00:26:07.394 --> 00:26:10.550\nAll right, and again.\n\n536\n00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:13.340\nAnd again, it just says,\nit takes a few minutes.\n\n537\n00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:14.980\nIt could take a couple of minutes.\n\n538\n00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:19.170\nHopefully we don't have to do the TV\ntimeout here cuz, there it is!\n\n539\n00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:21.140\nOkay, so\nI just gotta be a little bit more patient.\n\n540\n00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:22.490\nAll right, so it's kicked in here.\n\n541\n00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:24.350\nAs your phone's security\npolicy has changed, so\n\n542\n00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:26.800\nyou are going to change your\nlog screen with password.\n\n543\n00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.210\nHere are the new requirements.\n\n544\n00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:30.230\nAll right?\n\n545\n00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:33.610\nHas to have at least eight digits.\n\n546\n00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:35.740\nCannot contain sequences.\n\n547\n00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:36.310\nAll right?\n\n548\n00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:37.570\nSo we'll go ahead.\n\n549\n00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:42.800\nAll right, and notice in the background\nthere Mike, it's locked.\n\n550\n00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.330\nSo, I'm going to try to cheat it.\n\n551\n00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:47.130\nLet's see if I can cheat it.\n\n552\n00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:50.430\nAnd I'll show the password here just\nto make it a little bit easier.\n\n553\n00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:55.430\nIt says seven characters was\nthat eight characters I get?\n\n554\n00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:59.210\nOne, two, three, four,\nfive, six, seven, eight.\n\n555\n00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:02.777\nI doubt it's gonna let me do sequences\nlike that, but we're going to try anyways.\n\n556\n00:27:06.204 --> 00:27:07.960\nAll right, so there we go.\n\n557\n00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:08.940\nI set the policy.\n\n558\n00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:12.050\nAll right, it says eight characters\nnow we're in compliance.\n\n559\n00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:16.230\nWell, you can see we're in compliance and\nyou can see that the time has updated.\n\n560\n00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:18.790\nI've got 447 here on my host machine.\n\n561\n00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:19.800\nAnd on the phone, I've got 446.\n\n562\n00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.670\nSo you can see that the compliance.\n\n563\n00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:23.290\nThe policy, we are compliant.\n\n564\n00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:27.880\nBut now, what happens if somebody comes\nin and they add another policy, right?\n\n565\n00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:31.110\nAnd they're not paying attention to\nthe settings that you have already set.\n\n566\n00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:32.770\nWell, let's go ahead and do another one.\n\n567\n00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:36.270\nWe'll just call this mobile.\n\n568\n00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:40.190\nPassword policy, all right.\n\n569\n00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:44.009\nAnd on this one I'm gonna go ahead and\nallow simple passwords.\n\n570\n00:27:50.958 --> 00:27:51.738\nAll right, and\n\n571\n00:27:51.738 --> 00:27:55.108\nwe're gonna say the character\nlength on this one is gonna be 10.\n\n572\n00:27:55.108 --> 00:27:59.210\nAll right Mike, would you say that that\nis more restrictive or less restrictive?\n\n573\n00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:02.250\nThe last one was 8 requires 8,\nthis one requires 10.\n\n574\n00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:04.760\n>> I am going to say it is\na little more restrictive.\n\n575\n00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.010\n>> Now following what we have said so\n\n576\n00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:08.990\nfar remember that this is\n2 compliance policies so\n\n577\n00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:12.120\nwhat do you think is more restrictive or\nless restrictive going to win out?\n\n578\n00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.460\n>> Should be the most\nrestrictive of the two.\n\n579\n00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:15.980\n>> You see, he was paying attention.\n\n580\n00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:18.470\nThere we go.\nSo I'll allow a simple password,\n\n581\n00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:20.570\njust like we did in the last one.\n\n582\n00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:21.680\nAnd you know what?\n\n583\n00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.510\nI think I turned it on and I said no.\n\n584\n00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:26.870\nSo I'm gonna go ahead for\nconsistency's sake, I turned it on but\n\n585\n00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:28.250\nI didn't configure it.\n\n586\n00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:29.780\nYeah, something that you\ncan do just like you\n\n587\n00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:31.204\ncan do an active directory, right Mike?\n\n588\n00:28:31.204 --> 00:28:32.430\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, yes you can.\n\n589\n00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:35.280\n>> All right, so I'll go ahead now I'll\njust leave that for consistencies so\n\n590\n00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.440\nthose don't conflict.\n\n591\n00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.690\nBut we do wanna see basic\nconflict of interest here.\n\n592\n00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:43.050\nNotice that I have set, like Mike said\na little bit more restrictive, right?\n\n593\n00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:47.660\nI don't have ten characters required in\nthat password, let me just double check,\n\n594\n00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:49.760\nand there's all kinds of things\nwe can turn on here guys,\n\n595\n00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:53.030\nbut I'm not gonna turn that on for now.\n\n596\n00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:54.490\nWe get the same requirement.\n\n597\n00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:57.660\nIt says do you want to deploy\nthis policy now and, again,\n\n598\n00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:03.116\nremember the compliance policies\nare deployed to users and not devices.\n\n599\n00:29:03.116 --> 00:29:06.770\nNow we get the waiting game.\n\n600\n00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:08.290\nSo we're gonna do that same thing again.\n\n601\n00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:12.310\nWe're gonna reach out, we're gonna\ncheck compliance and, again, it's gonna\n\n602\n00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:16.340\nreach out over the internet that's\none of the benefits of Entune right?\n\n603\n00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:18.910\nRemember that Entune helps\nyou to manage devices that\n\n604\n00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:20.830\ncan't be managed through\ntraditional mechanisms.\n\n605\n00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:24.020\nJust like the RT devices right,\nI can not join them to a domain.\n\n606\n00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:27.558\nAnd here we go,\nhere we go and there it went.\n\n607\n00:29:27.558 --> 00:29:29.329\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right so let's try that again.\n\n608\n00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:31.160\n>> Wake up our phone then.\n\n609\n00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.150\n>> Yeah, we will wake up our phone.\n\n610\n00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:34.070\nOkay, so notice something here.\n\n611\n00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:37.480\nI've got two policies, right?\n\n612\n00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:40.360\nThese are both compliance policies.\n\n613\n00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.350\nI've already got an eight\ncharacter password.\n\n614\n00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:44.550\nOr eight digits, right?\n\n615\n00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:46.390\nNow this one is more restrictive and\nit's saying,\n\n616\n00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:50.090\nwait a second I see two policies,\nthe most restrictive is gonna win.\n\n617\n00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:51.270\nNow I'll save you some time.\n\n618\n00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:53.480\nThe configuration policies\nwill do the same thing.\n\n619\n00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:56.170\nIf I was to configure two of\nthe configurate, boy that's redundant,\n\n620\n00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:56.935\nconfiguration.\n\n621\n00:29:56.935 --> 00:29:59.160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Configurate the configuration policies,\n\n622\n00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.120\nyou'd see the same thing here.\n\n623\n00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:04.519\nBut let's go ahead and\nwe'll finish this one to completion and\n\n624\n00:30:04.519 --> 00:30:06.600\nwe'll go ahead and set that.\n\n625\n00:30:09.062 --> 00:30:12.790\nAnd you can only imagine what\nmy password's gonna be right?\n\n626\n00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:16.000\nYou can add another one-\n>> I'm gonna add another one zero.\n\n627\n00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.850\n>> Just like a typical-\n>> I can not keep my\n\n628\n00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:23.643\nlaptop around Mike to save my life,\nnot if I want my money to stay in my bank.\n\n629\n00:30:23.643 --> 00:30:26.351\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, just kidding guys.\n\n630\n00:30:26.351 --> 00:30:29.060\nHe wears the white hat, most of the time.\n\n631\n00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:29.910\n>> During the day.\n\n632\n00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:30.410\n>> During the day.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n633\n00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:33.320\n>> And apparently I can't type 1-0 enough.\n\n634\n00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:36.189\nYou know what it is,\nhow about we type the old password,\n\n635\n00:30:36.189 --> 00:30:39.110\nlike you do to confirm the new password.\n\n636\n00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:42.435\nThat does help, you just got to be\nsmarter than the 1s and 0s, Wes.\n\n637\n00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:48.305\nAnd there we go.\n\n638\n00:30:48.305 --> 00:30:51.515\nNow, we confirm, and\nwe'll show this password 1010101010.\n\n639\n00:30:51.515 --> 00:30:57.450\nNothing like watching Wes type ones and\nzeros.\n\n640\n00:30:57.450 --> 00:31:01.955\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, notice now if we checked again, and\n\n641\n00:31:01.955 --> 00:31:04.960\nwe could, it wouldn't let me back\non the phone if I wasn't compliant.\n\n642\n00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:09.600\nSo now you can see how the configuration,\nor actually the compliance policies,\n\n643\n00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.120\nthe most restrictive is\nthe one that wins out.\n\n644\n00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:15.510\nLet's see what happens now,\nwe're gonna do a couple of things here.\n\n645\n00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:18.250\nWhat happens if I pull a policy,\nand I say, you know what?\n\n646\n00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:20.790\nI don't even want to apply\nthat policy anymore.\n\n647\n00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:23.430\nI can come in here and\nI can do exactly that.\n\n648\n00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:26.740\nSo let me go ahead, and this was the ten.\n\n649\n00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:31.340\nAnd we'll manage\nthe deployment on this one.\n\n650\n00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:36.470\nAll right, and we're gonna go ahead and\njust remove that one, we'll say OK.\n\n651\n00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:39.890\nAnd now that policy isn't\ncurrently deployed.\n\n652\n00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:43.883\nAll right, so we're not gonna see any\nproblem with that because it's, remember,\n\n653\n00:31:43.883 --> 00:31:46.879\nmore restrictive and\nthe compliance policy's gonna win out.\n\n654\n00:31:46.879 --> 00:31:53.207\nAll right, but now I have a mobile\npassword policy of ten Characters.\n\n655\n00:31:53.207 --> 00:31:54.356\nAll right, remember so\n\n656\n00:31:54.356 --> 00:31:58.235\nfar we've said the most restricted between\nthe same are the ones that wins out.\n\n657\n00:31:58.235 --> 00:31:58.820\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But\n\n658\n00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:03.120\ncompliance policies I told you,\nalways override a configuration policy.\n\n659\n00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:06.400\nLet's put that to the test, and see if\nI can put my money where my mouth is.\n\n660\n00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.960\nWe're gonna go to a configuration policy.\n\n661\n00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:08.660\nSlight different.\n\n662\n00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:09.990\nThis is where you can and\n\n663\n00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:12.440\nyou can see I've already got\nan anti malware policy in here.\n\n664\n00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:15.770\nAll right, now remember,\nI can pick the operating system.\n\n665\n00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:20.590\nIt is important for you guys to make sure\nthat whatever the configuration policy is,\n\n666\n00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:22.070\nthat you look at what it says.\n\n667\n00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:24.940\nRemember, it does give you some\ninformation since obviously this is gonna\n\n668\n00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:26.290\nbe Windows 8.1 or later.\n\n669\n00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:30.870\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and, I'm just\ngonna do a general configuration cuz,\n\n670\n00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:32.840\nwe don't really need anything too fancy.\n\n671\n00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:35.360\nAll right, and\n\n672\n00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:39.820\nwe're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\ncall this configuration policy, and\n\n673\n00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:44.561\nit looks like I scrolled down a little bit\ntoo far, overshot the runway on that one.\n\n674\n00:32:44.561 --> 00:32:51.630\nAll right, so we'll call this one\nconfig and I know I said policy, Mike.\n\n675\n00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:54.030\nLet's make it a little bit easier\nbecause this is a mobile device.\n\n676\n00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:55.360\nWe'll call it config mobile.\n\n677\n00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:55.910\n>> All right.\n\n678\n00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:58.490\n>> Policy, all right, maybe.\n\n679\n00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:05.710\nAlright, now the description here, we're\ngoing to keep some of the things the same,\n\n680\n00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:10.720\nwe're gonna allow simple\npasswords this time and I promise\n\n681\n00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:15.010\nthis time I'll actually turn that on,\nrather than turn it on and just say no.\n\n682\n00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:18.960\nAll right, and you do have the option here\nto apply the configurations in Windows 10.\n\n683\n00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.360\nDon't worry about that for this exam.\n\n684\n00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:26.190\nAll right, now we're gonna do and in here\nthere should be allow simple password.\n\n685\n00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:27.520\nAnd I'm gonna choose yes.\n\n686\n00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:33.420\nAll right and I'm gonna choose\nthe minimum password length.\n\n687\n00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:35.460\nWhat'd we have last time Mike, 10?\n\n688\n00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:36.100\n>> Ten.\n\n689\n00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:37.370\n>> We're gonna do 14.\n\n690\n00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:39.660\nWe're gonna be really restrictive here.\n\n691\n00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:44.250\nRight, everybody is going to love us for\nthis one and we are going\n\n692\n00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:49.020\nto require a password to unlock mobile\ndevices, we are going to save the policy.\n\n693\n00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:50.670\nNow this one is a little\nbit different right,\n\n694\n00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:57.200\nwhen I deploy this policy this time, I get\nthe ability to choose users and devices.\n\n695\n00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:00.410\nAll right,\nhere it's all how you set it up.\n\n696\n00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:04.200\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nsince we've got users already configured,\n\n697\n00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:07.780\nwe'll go ahead and keep it consistent and\nwe'll do users here.\n\n698\n00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:11.040\nAll right, now I'm gonna switch back over.\n\n699\n00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:14.980\nKeep in mind we got a compliance policy\nand we got a configuration policy.\n\n700\n00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:17.740\nMy configuration policy is\nmore restrictive, right?\n\n701\n00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:20.630\nA lot more characters\nrequired in that password\n\n702\n00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:22.270\nthan what's in the compliance policy.\n\n703\n00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:26.880\nSo let's go ahead, well,\nlet's reach out over the Internet.\n\n704\n00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.560\nAnd it says this could\ntake a few minutes so\n\n705\n00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.850\nlet's see how long I can talk and we'll-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n706\n00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:31.860\n>> Wait for it to happen.\n\n707\n00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:33.370\nAll right, so-\n>> We know you,\n\n708\n00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:34.740\nWes, you can talk for a while.\n\n709\n00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:35.605\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n710\n00:34:35.605 --> 00:34:37.800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So again, as we're waiting for\n\n711\n00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.910\nthis to sit here and,\nhopefully do nothing.\n\n712\n00:34:39.910 --> 00:34:44.130\n[LAUGH] Just keep in mind, one to one,\nconfiguration to configuration,\n\n713\n00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:44.890\nmost restrictive.\n\n714\n00:34:44.890 --> 00:34:48.460\nOne to one compliance gonna be most\nrestrictive as you'll see here.\n\n715\n00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.840\nThe configuration policy is gonna\nbe overwritten by compliance.\n\n716\n00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:53.210\nCompliance always wins out.\n\n717\n00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:58.279\nIn fact, if we take a look at my computer,\nit's not gonna do anything, check.\n\n718\n00:34:58.279 --> 00:35:02.500\nI am compliant, right?\n\n719\n00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:03.250\nI'm compliant.\n\n720\n00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:05.910\nWhy is it that I'm compliant?\n\n721\n00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:10.500\nWell again, it's because the configuration\npolicy in this case on a password is\n\n722\n00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.400\nconflicting with a compliance policy.\n\n723\n00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.080\nCompliance overrides it, so\n\n724\n00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:18.910\nintunes basically has a blind eye\nto this configuration policy.\n\n725\n00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:21.960\nFairly easy to set up your devices,\nnot too difficult.\n\n726\n00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:27.360\nNow, last thing I want you to see is, what\nhappens if we decide to retire a device?\n\n727\n00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:30.410\nKeep in mind, if you just delete a device\nyou still have the intunes management\n\n728\n00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:32.810\nsoftware in the phone controlling it.\n\n729\n00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:35.690\nIt's just not aware,\nthat its no longer into your interface.\n\n730\n00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:40.460\nThat could be really difficult to get the\nfingers of into and out of your device,\n\n731\n00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:42.070\nif you don't retire the right way.\n\n732\n00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:45.460\nLet me go ahead, I think it's\nworthwhile to show you guys that.\n\n733\n00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.950\nGoing back over here to our groups.\n\n734\n00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:51.670\nWe're going to go to all mobile devices,\nwe going to go to device.\n\n735\n00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:57.410\nAll right and, we're going to go ahead and\nselect that device.\n\n736\n00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:02.920\nAnd notice that over here on the right\nhand side we've got this Retire and Wipe.\n\n737\n00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:06.430\nAll right, so\nwe're going to go ahead and choose that.\n\n738\n00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:09.940\nNow, you probably, maybe if you've\nseen this screen before, right?\n\n739\n00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:11.000\nMaybe you haven't.\n\n740\n00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.760\nNow there's a couple of things\nthat you gotta keep in mind,\n\n741\n00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:15.480\ncouple good utilizations for\neither of these.\n\n742\n00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:18.170\nIn fact, I was talking to\nMegan before we started here.\n\n743\n00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:21.770\nI said, well, why would I use the\nselective device, or the selective wi-fi.\n\n744\n00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:23.250\nWell, imagine if Megan comes in here and\n\n745\n00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:24.890\nshe decides that she wants\nto use her phone and\n\n746\n00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:28.800\nshe wants to connect to our Exchange,\nshe wants to connect to our Office365,\n\n747\n00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:32.600\nall the cloud based apps and she's now\ngot line of business software there.\n\n748\n00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:37.480\nWhen you do a selective wipe it says\nleave all of Megan's photos, right?\n\n749\n00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:40.800\nLeave all of her files before\nthe enrollment, leave those alone.\n\n750\n00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.230\nTake our company data and eradicate it.\n\n751\n00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:44.980\nTake it off the phone.\n\n752\n00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:47.070\nAll right, not a bad thing.\n\n753\n00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:50.160\nBut what if Megan says, I left my phone.\n\n754\n00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:54.080\nI was at that convention, I left it in\nthe middle of that lobby out there.\n\n755\n00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.140\nIt was unlocked.\n\n756\n00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:58.090\nI'm frantic, I don't know what to do.\n\n757\n00:36:58.090 --> 00:37:00.945\nThat's where the full device wipe will do,\n\n758\n00:37:00.945 --> 00:37:03.505\nreturn everything back\nto the factory settings.\n\n759\n00:37:03.505 --> 00:37:05.895\nSo if we do something like that,\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n760\n00:37:05.895 --> 00:37:10.065\ndo the selective device, selective\nwipe while were talking about it.\n\n761\n00:37:11.695 --> 00:37:14.460\nSo when that happens that\ngives you the ability to\n\n762\n00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:18.960\neradicate not only the data that's part\nof your company, but also help her out.\n\n763\n00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:23.030\nIn this case, help the end user out that\nwhen you're wiping their information too,\n\n764\n00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:25.560\nit doesn't end up in\nsomebody else's hands.\n\n765\n00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.070\nNow this usually takes a little bit.\n\n766\n00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:31.210\nIt'd be nice if we could show you.\n\n767\n00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:33.640\nHere we go, we can check compliance.\n\n768\n00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:38.520\nAnd notice it didn't give me a problem\nat all with the configuration policies\n\n769\n00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:41.980\nthere because well,\nthey're not applicable in this case.\n\n770\n00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:45.290\nAll right, and we'll go ahead and\n\n771\n00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:48.940\nin a second here what we should see\nIs that it should give us a warning.\n\n772\n00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:49.990\nWhat is the warning?\n\n773\n00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:53.930\nWell, the warning is going to be, well\nif you have company information on here.\n\n774\n00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:58.100\nIf you've created information that\nmaybe you consider yours, right?\n\n775\n00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:00.740\nNow we know we can get into legalities,\nwe know it's the company's but\n\n776\n00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:02.270\nmaybe it's something that's important.\n\n777\n00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:05.000\nimportant to you,\nwell that's gonna be gone, all right and\n\n778\n00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.910\nbefore it actually erases\nit what it's gonna do,\n\n779\n00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:11.040\nis it's gonna give you a warning and\nwe'll show you what that looks like.\n\n780\n00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:14.550\nAlright so we've got a couple of\nwarnings here and they went in\n\n781\n00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:19.060\norder as I applied them, remember\nwe stop the password policy, right?\n\n782\n00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:20.430\nAnd then I retired the device.\n\n783\n00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:24.810\nWe did the selective wipe that says what\nif somebody decides to leave the company,\n\n784\n00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:28.320\nand they obviously gonna keep their phone,\nbut we don't want them keeping our data.\n\n785\n00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.110\nSo let's go ahead and show you this.\n\n786\n00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:31.595\nPasswords no longer - required.\n\n787\n00:38:31.595 --> 00:38:35.085\nSo this one actually came up because,\nagain, they were in line, right?\n\n788\n00:38:35.085 --> 00:38:35.805\n>> Right.\n\n789\n00:38:35.805 --> 00:38:39.045\n>> I said no longer are we going\nto deploy that policy, right?\n\n790\n00:38:39.045 --> 00:38:42.437\nWell if I say okay,\nclose to this, look at this here.\n\n791\n00:38:42.437 --> 00:38:47.352\nAll right, it says that our company\nhas deleted all of the apps and\n\n792\n00:38:47.352 --> 00:38:49.962\nthe policies required by your\ncompany from your phone.\n\n793\n00:38:49.962 --> 00:38:53.852\nAny Office files you hadn't saved or\nuploaded were also deleted.\n\n794\n00:38:53.852 --> 00:38:58.022\nThere is a caveat there that they\ntalked about the Exchange email that\n\n795\n00:38:58.022 --> 00:39:00.792\naccount will continue and\nyou have to apply to delete it.\n\n796\n00:39:00.792 --> 00:39:04.532\nSo you will lose information.\n\n797\n00:39:04.532 --> 00:39:06.710\nIf you're the administrator,\nkeep that in mind.\n\n798\n00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:08.170\nAll right, keep that in mind.\n\n799\n00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:11.160\nIf you do a full wipe,\nlet's just hope you're not\n\n800\n00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.450\nwiping the CEO's phone-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n801\n00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:13.260\n>> On accident here.\n\n802\n00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:20.320\nSo, it lets you know, once we close this,\nthat I can now, if I want.\n\n803\n00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.520\nNotice the device,\nit says isn't enrolled anymore?\n\n804\n00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:23.440\nWe can see it right there.\n\n805\n00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.750\nIt's not enrolled.\n\n806\n00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:26.210\nAll right, and if I wanted to.\n\n807\n00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:31.630\nIf I go back up to settings,\nand I go to my lock screen.\n\n808\n00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:36.480\nAnd let me scroll down here.\n\n809\n00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:40.550\nNotice I have the ability if I wanted,\nto turn the password on and off.\n\n810\n00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:42.025\nTo change my password if I want.\n\n811\n00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:46.103\n>> Because those policies\nare just no longer [CROSSTALK]\n\n812\n00:39:46.103 --> 00:39:47.080\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n813\n00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:48.210\nAnd now it's turned off.\n\n814\n00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:49.670\nAnd remember what the policies were.\n\n815\n00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:51.130\nI'm gonna turn this back on.\n\n816\n00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:57.120\nBut I'm gonna use 1, 2 234, this is the\nmost secured password in the world, right?\n\n817\n00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.280\n1234.\n>> But that is your password.\n\n818\n00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:03.480\n>> That's right, better go change\nyour password on your luggage, right?\n\n819\n00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:06.710\nAnd there we go, it's no longer being\nmanaged by Intune so we have showed you\n\n820\n00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:10.620\nnot only enrolling the device, controlling\nit through your policies and conflicts.\n\n821\n00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:13.540\nBut we've also shown you what to do,\nit's time to leave the company.\n\n822\n00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:14.940\nNo, just kidding.\n\n823\n00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:17.810\nIf it's time to leak that information\nout of Intune, you can do that.\n\n824\n00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:21.650\nSo Mike,\nI think it's a really good technology and\n\n825\n00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:26.020\nI think it really lends itself to being\nable to reach out to these devices that we\n\n826\n00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:28.650\ncan't manage through\nthe traditional mechanisms like for\n\n827\n00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:30.960\ninstance I know you deal\nwith Active Directory so.\n\n828\n00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:31.780\nThere you have it, sir.\n\n829\n00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:35.470\n>> That's a fantastic concept being able\nto manage those devices as you said that I\n\n830\n00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:36.435\ncan't join a domain,\n\n831\n00:40:36.435 --> 00:40:40.530\nnon-Windows devices and great examples\nthere with that Windows 8.1 phone and\n\n832\n00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:44.230\nhow we're gonna file those policies and\nhow the different policies apply, right?\n\n833\n00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:46.680\nWe talked about that with group policy and\nActive Directory,\n\n834\n00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:49.230\nvery important to understand\nthat processing order.\n\n835\n00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:52.460\nNow we know just as important with\nour in tune configuration and\n\n836\n00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:53.720\ncompliance policies.\n\n837\n00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:55.620\nAnything else before\nwe call us one a wrap?\n\n838\n00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:56.490\n>> Well, you gonna be careful.\n\n839\n00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:59.370\nI would say, pay attention to\nyour policies and the conflicts.\n\n840\n00:40:59.370 --> 00:41:01.840\nAnd I will also say pay attention\nwho's device your wiping.\n\n841\n00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:02.960\nHopefully it's not the CEO.\n\n842\n00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.825\nYou be looking for\nprinter to print your resume.\n\n843\n00:41:04.825 -->
