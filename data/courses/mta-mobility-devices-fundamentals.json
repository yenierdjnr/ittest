          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:07.015\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:07.015 --> 00:00:10.212\nIn this segment,\nwe're gonna take a look at the MTA exam,\n\n3\n00:00:10.212 --> 00:00:12.380\nthe Microsoft Technology Associate.\n\n4\n00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.511\nRight?\nIs that right, Don, the MTA?\n\n5\n00:00:14.511 --> 00:00:16.225\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's absolutely right.\n\n6\n00:00:16.225 --> 00:00:18.401\nThe MTA,\nthe Microsoft Technology Associate,\n\n7\n00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:21.970\nis designed to be a entry point into\nthe world of Microsoft certifications.\n\n8\n00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.910\nIf you're just getting started in IT the\nMTA is a great place to get started out.\n\n9\n00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.575\nIt's not gonna hit you with crazy over the\ntop objectives that you have no chance of\n\n10\n00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:32.260\nlearning.\n\n11\n00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.890\nIt's gonna to start you off with\nthe basics, the fundamentals.\n\n12\n00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.850\nAnd that makes it a very\nvaluable certification to get,\n\n13\n00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.910\nespecially if you're a career changer.\n\n14\n00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.653\nWell in this series, we're gonna be\ncovering the MTA specifically designed for\n\n15\n00:00:43.653 --> 00:00:45.057\nmobility and devices.\n\n16\n00:00:45.057 --> 00:00:46.763\nAnd what does that mean?\n\n17\n00:00:46.763 --> 00:00:48.442\nRight?\nCuz there's a lot of different MTAs that\n\n18\n00:00:48.442 --> 00:00:48.982\nare out there.\n\n19\n00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:53.257\nWell this one is the one that focuses\non desktops, laptops, tablets,\n\n20\n00:00:53.257 --> 00:00:56.537\ncellphones, the devices that\nend users make use of and\n\n21\n00:00:56.537 --> 00:01:01.051\ntypically the devices that you guys\nare used to out there in the real world.\n\n22\n00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:04.612\nBecause if you're not an IT then you\nprobably haven't worked with servers,\n\n23\n00:01:04.612 --> 00:01:08.550\nyou haven't probably worked with\ndatabase systems and email servers.\n\n24\n00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.740\nYou probably have used a computer.\n\n25\n00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.040\nWell, you're watching this video.\n\n26\n00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.130\nRight?\nSo you at least have that knowledge.\n\n27\n00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.440\nAt that's the type of person\nthat this is targeted for.\n\n28\n00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.490\nAnd in a workplace,\nwhen you just transition in IT,\n\n29\n00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.170\nyou're typically gonna be starting\nas help desk, or desktop support.\n\n30\n00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.750\nRight?\nThat's kind of the entry level\n\n31\n00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.020\nposition in IT.\n\n32\n00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.880\nSo, you need to be able to\nknow how to identify and\n\n33\n00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.460\nresolve issues on a Windows machine,\nhow to do it on a tablet,\n\n34\n00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.340\nhow to integrate somebody's iPad\ninto your Windows environment.\n\n35\n00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.260\nAll right, these are things that you've\ngot to know how to do out there in\n\n36\n00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.940\nthe real world to be a valuable employee,\nand that's what the MTA helps to certify.\n\n37\n00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.100\nNow, there is more than one MTA that\nwe need to need to be aware of.\n\n38\n00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.430\nRight?\nLet's take a look at Microsoft's web\n\n39\n00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.100\npage, real quick.\n\n40\n00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.937\nCuz they do a great job of explaining what\nthe MTA is, who it's designed for, but\n\n41\n00:01:50.937 --> 00:01:52.984\nalso highlighting the different tracks.\n\n42\n00:01:52.984 --> 00:01:56.563\nThere's a track for IT infrastructure,\na track for database administrators,\n\n43\n00:01:56.563 --> 00:01:57.836\nand a track for developers.\n\n44\n00:01:57.836 --> 00:01:58.400\nRight?\n\n45\n00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.740\nDevelopers are the people who create\napplications, they're programmers.\n\n46\n00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.620\nDatabase, that's for people who are gonna\nbe running database servers where we\n\n47\n00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.370\nhave large collections of\ninformation that are searchable and\n\n48\n00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.600\nenabled to retrieve information from.\n\n49\n00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.100\nBut IT infrastructure.\n\n50\n00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.750\nThat's our normal IT worker, the person\nwho is supporting servers, workstations,\n\n51\n00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.470\nrouters, switches, the infrastructure\nthat makes the Internet work.\n\n52\n00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.220\nAnd the infrastructure that makes\nyour business or your home work.\n\n53\n00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.720\nRight?\n\n54\n00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.820\nSomebody's got to know\nhow to make that run.\n\n55\n00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.160\nThese are the people who do it,\nIT infrastructure.\n\n56\n00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.330\nAnd so when we look at the MTA exams,\n\n57\n00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.970\nthere's several different exams\nbased on which track you choose.\n\n58\n00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.050\nIf you go database, you could go\ndeveloper, or if you go IT infrastructure.\n\n59\n00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.040\nIn IT infrastructure you'll see\nthere's five different exams\n\n60\n00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.440\nbased on what it is you\nwanna specialize in.\n\n61\n00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.550\nNow to get the MTA,\nyou don't have to take all five exams.\n\n62\n00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.770\nYou just have to pass one of them.\n\n63\n00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.520\nSo pick the area that you're strong in.\n\n64\n00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.260\nIn this series,\nwe're gonna be doing Mobility and\n\n65\n00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.290\nDevice Fundamentals because\nthat's the most common one.\n\n66\n00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.220\nThat's the one that most people\nare gonna want to start off with.\n\n67\n00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.960\nAnd from there you might choose\nto specialize in other things.\n\n68\n00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.880\nRight?\n\n69\n00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.120\nSo for example, Daniel,\nwho'd be doing server administration?\n\n70\n00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.120\n>> Server administration?\n\n71\n00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.240\nThat will definitely fall under\npeople that wanna become sysadmins.\n\n72\n00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.280\nThey wanna work on the server environment.\n\n73\n00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.821\nThey're gonna eventually probably become\nan MCSA and hopefully one day an MCSC.\n\n74\n00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:19.750\nSo they can take care of those large\ninfrastructure, and even design and\n\n75\n00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.150\ndevelop those things, so\n\n76\n00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.720\nthat's probably where you'd want to start\noff if that was the goal you had in mind.\n\n77\n00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.230\nOther than that though you would just,\nlike Don said,\n\n78\n00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.510\npick your specialty,\nwant to get into security?\n\n79\n00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.890\nJump in that security track.\n\n80\n00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.824\nIf you wanted to just get your\nfeet wet in device mobility?\n\n81\n00:03:33.824 --> 00:03:36.866\nThat's where we're at today, that's\nthe one you'd want to jump on on that.\n\n82\n00:03:36.866 --> 00:03:39.553\n>> Yep, and when you take a look\nat Server Administrator or\n\n83\n00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:41.612\nyou take a look at Security Fundamentals,\n\n84\n00:03:41.612 --> 00:03:45.330\nthese are typically people that\nalready have an exposure to IT.\n\n85\n00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.650\nThey've been working in desktop support or\nsomething and\n\n86\n00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.660\nthey wanna move up to the next tier.\n\n87\n00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.600\nThey wanna move over to that\nsysadmin side or whatever.\n\n88\n00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.240\nAnd so start moving in to\nsome of these other ones.\n\n89\n00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.700\nRight?\nNetwork fundamentals,\n\n90\n00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.810\nif you're dealing with networking,\nTCP/IP-based networks, IPv6,\n\n91\n00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.650\nthat kind of stuff falls in there,\nbut mobility and\n\n92\n00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.940\ndevice fundamentals,\nthat's the one we're gonna tackle.\n\n93\n00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.860\nNow, I mentioned you only have to\npass one exam to get your MTA, so\n\n94\n00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.570\nyou can pass any one of these,\nand you get it.\n\n95\n00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.270\nThe other thing is, if you wanna move\nonto the MCSA like Daniel mentioned,\n\n96\n00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.260\nthe MTA is not a prerequisite.\n\n97\n00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.610\nSo if you already have this knowledge,\nyou are not forced.\n\n98\n00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.110\nYou are not obliged to take this exam.\n\n99\n00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.700\nYou can skip it.\nYou can just move right past and\n\n100\n00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.470\ngo straight to the MCSA if you want.\n\n101\n00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.204\nBut if you're just getting started in IT,\nthe MSCA is really hard.\n\n102\n00:04:26.204 --> 00:04:26.940\nAll right?\n\n103\n00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.250\nIt takes a lot of work and\nI'm not saying the MTA is easy,\n\n104\n00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.610\nI'm just saying that the MTA is\ndesigned for somebody getting started.\n\n105\n00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.560\nThe MCSA is not, it's designed for\nsomebody that's already in there.\n\n106\n00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.300\nSo, make sure you place\nyourself in the right position.\n\n107\n00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.580\nIf you're already started,\nif you're already in IT,\n\n108\n00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.740\nthe MTA might be a little boring for you.\n\n109\n00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.050\nIt might be beneath your skill set.\n\n110\n00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.411\nIt looks good on the resume, so\nmaybe that's what you're looking for.\n\n111\n00:04:47.411 --> 00:04:49.454\nBut, don't feel obliged to do it.\n\n112\n00:04:49.454 --> 00:04:52.720\nAll right, now let's look at\nthe 368 exam specifically.\n\n113\n00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.580\nIf we jump into that exam, you'll see\nthat there's a couple of basics here.\n\n114\n00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.300\nIt's $115, so it's not an expensive exam.\n\n115\n00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.970\nThat's US dollars, it's different for\ndifferent countries.\n\n116\n00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.910\nAnd you can take the exam at\na number of different places.\n\n117\n00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.550\nAny Certaport location,\nwhich a lot of colleges,\n\n118\n00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.775\ncommunity colleges, secondary schools,\na lot of them are Certaport locations.\n\n119\n00:05:11.775 --> 00:05:15.340\nBut if there aren't any of those,\nyou can use Pearson View.\n\n120\n00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.500\nPearson View has testing\ncenters all over the world.\n\n121\n00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.730\nThey're a third party provider.\n\n122\n00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.430\nThey provide tests for\nall sorts of different exams.\n\n123\n00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.190\nAnd if you go to their site,\nyou can actually do a center search for\n\n124\n00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.130\na location.\n\n125\n00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.590\nDaniel, what's a city we can use?\n\n126\n00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.120\n>> Let's try Gainesville, Florida.\n\n127\n00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.710\n>> All right.\n\n128\n00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.830\nWe can take up Gainesville, Florida.\n\n129\n00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.640\nAnd we'll just do a quick search here.\n\n130\n00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.470\nAnd you can search anywhere in the world.\n\n131\n00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:37.680\nRight?\nParis, France, whatever.\n\n132\n00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.650\nAnd it's gonna give you a list of all\nthe different locations that are out\n\n133\n00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.490\nthere that are Pearson View Centers.\n\n134\n00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.010\nSo we can go and take that exam.\n\n135\n00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.341\nSo as far as taking the exam,\nthey've really removed an obstacle there.\n\n136\n00:05:47.341 --> 00:05:49.190\nRight?\nIt's pretty easy to find a location to go\n\n137\n00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.520\nand take the exam.\n\n138\n00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.090\nThe hard part is what you need to\nknow before you go and take the exam.\n\n139\n00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.590\nRight?\n\n140\n00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.070\nSo fortunately Microsoft posts their\nexam objectives right here, and\n\n141\n00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.090\nthis is what we've\nstructured our show off of.\n\n142\n00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.300\nSo our show is going to basically go\nthrough from start to finish tackling\n\n143\n00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.200\nall of these objectives to make sure that\nyou guys have the information you need to\n\n144\n00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.520\nbe successful.\n\n145\n00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.230\nSome of these might be areas you\nalready know, some might be areas that\n\n146\n00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:13.080\nare completely new to you, so\nthis is your chance to get that exposure.\n\n147\n00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.761\nAll right,\n\n148\n00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:18.543\nwell the first exam objective area is\njust understanding device configurations.\n\n149\n00:06:18.543 --> 00:06:19.380\nAll right?\n\n150\n00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.850\nAnd what this boils down to is,\n\n151\n00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.170\nif I give you a Windows computer,\ndo you know how to do a basic setup on it?\n\n152\n00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:30.060\nThings like changing the screen saver time\nout, changing power management settings,\n\n153\n00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.280\nsetting up device encryption,\nall the things we do when we get\n\n154\n00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.700\na brand new computer and we wanna make\nit our own, kinda customize it our way.\n\n155\n00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.475\nThose are the things that we\nneed to be familiar with.\n\n156\n00:06:38.475 --> 00:06:40.330\nRight?\nAnd this is end-user stuff,\n\n157\n00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.320\nthings that most end users are already\ndoing if you've had exposure to it.\n\n158\n00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.790\nSo basic device configurations and\ngetting those in place.\n\n159\n00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.010\nThe next objective Is understanding\ndata access and management.\n\n160\n00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.860\nWe have a lot of data on our computers.\n\n161\n00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.390\nRight?\nDocuments, pictures,\n\n162\n00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.100\nmusic files, whatever.\n\n163\n00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.010\nWe need to make sure that\nthose are secured, so\n\n164\n00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.400\nthat only the people we want\nto have access do have access.\n\n165\n00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.400\nRight?\nWe need to kinda keep that trimmed down.\n\n166\n00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.110\nSo in this section we cover things\nlike how to apply file permissions,\n\n167\n00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.550\nhow to restrict access, how to share\nthe files and folders on the network.\n\n168\n00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.070\nRight?\nWe wanna make sure that people can get to\n\n169\n00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.210\nthat information, but\nthat it's done in a secure manner.\n\n170\n00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.410\nThe third objective is Device Security.\n\n171\n00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.260\nNow I kind of already mentioned\nsecurity with device access.\n\n172\n00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.420\nBut here,\nit goes beyond just files and folders.\n\n173\n00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.160\nHere, we talk about things\nlike the Windows Firewall and\n\n174\n00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.060\nhow we can control access over\nthe network and protect our machine.\n\n175\n00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.730\nWe're talking about\nmulti-factor authentication.\n\n176\n00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.160\nWe wanna stop people from\nlogging in to our computer,\n\n177\n00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.706\nunless they have the valid\ncredentials to get in there.\n\n178\n00:07:38.706 --> 00:07:41.144\nAnd we wanna protect our system\nin the event that it gets stolen.\n\n179\n00:07:41.144 --> 00:07:42.120\nRight?\n\n180\n00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.580\nI wanna know that if somebody steals\nmy laptop, that my data is still safe,\n\n181\n00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:46.530\neven though I lost my laptop.\n\n182\n00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:49.880\nAnd so, those are some of the things that\nwe take a look at in device security.\n\n183\n00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:54.220\nThen, we've got an important section,\nbecause more and\n\n184\n00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.440\nmore services are moving this way.\n\n185\n00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.290\nWe're gonna talk about Cloud Services.\n\n186\n00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:00.284\nNow the cloud is a term that gets\nthrow on around quite a bit and\n\n187\n00:08:00.284 --> 00:08:02.238\nit means a number of different things.\n\n188\n00:08:02.238 --> 00:08:05.210\nBut what we're gonna do is take a look\nat it from the standpoint of a normal\n\n189\n00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.230\nend user, and\nwhat cloud services mean to them.\n\n190\n00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:07.990\nRight?\n\n191\n00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:11.290\nSo what are some cloud applications they\ncan use, how they can leverage things,\n\n192\n00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.169\nlike Windows Azure or Microsoft Intune.\n\n193\n00:08:14.169 --> 00:08:16.300\nRight?\nDifferent features like that and\n\n194\n00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.490\nhow we can implement those for a business.\n\n195\n00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.270\nAnd then lastly, this one,\nEnterprise Mobility.\n\n196\n00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:28.020\nEnterprise Mobility is basically saying,\nit used to be that if you had a computer\n\n197\n00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:31.460\nfor a company, the company provided\nthe computer, it was a company machine.\n\n198\n00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.035\nBut in today's world,\nwe have a lot of bring your device.\n\n199\n00:08:34.035 --> 00:08:35.410\nRight?\nPeople bring their own stuff,\n\n200\n00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:37.610\ntheir own cellphone,\ntheir own tablet, their own laptop,\n\n201\n00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.040\nand they wanna connect it\nto a business computer.\n\n202\n00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.300\nSo how do we do that safely and\n\n203\n00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:44.820\nsecurely where we can still manage it and\nkeep our environment safe?\n\n204\n00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.990\nHow do we manage our own mobile devices?\n\n205\n00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.050\nAnd how do we manage the ones that\nour employees are bringing in?\n\n206\n00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:53.550\nSo we get a chance to take a look\nat some of the obstacles there and\n\n207\n00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:57.610\nsome of the solutions that we have, like\nwork folders and Azure remote apps and\n\n208\n00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:01.630\ntechnologies that can let us safely\nparticipate in that type of environment.\n\n209\n00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:06.390\nSo those are the five main objective\nareas inside of the MTA exam.\n\n210\n00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:08.330\nThey cover some really good stuff.\n\n211\n00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.960\nAnd Microsoft is not looking for\nyou to be an expert.\n\n212\n00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.446\nYou're not supposed to be a super wizard\nwith 20 years of industry experience.\n\n213\n00:09:14.446 --> 00:09:15.267\nYou're getting started.\n\n214\n00:09:15.267 --> 00:09:16.090\nRight?\n\n215\n00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:19.280\nSo a lot of these are just making sure\nthat you're familiar with the topic.\n\n216\n00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.780\nNot necessarily how to implement and\ncreate that structure.\n\n217\n00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.820\nFor that,\nthat's where we jump into the MCSA and\n\n218\n00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.780\nwe start tackling how do we actually build\nall this great stuff that we talked about.\n\n219\n00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.150\nSo that's basically it for\nthe exam objectives.\n\n220\n00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:35.610\nWe talked a little bit about the exam\ncost as well as where you can take it.\n\n221\n00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.310\nAnd we talk about the MTA\ncertification in general.\n\n222\n00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:41.150\nAt this point you guys should have pretty\ngood picture of what we're gonna cover.\n\n223\n00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.978\nSo if this sounds interesting, if it\nsounds exactly like what you're looking\n\n224\n00:09:44.978 --> 00:09:47.530\nfor, then you're in the right place,\nstay tuned,\n\n225\n00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:49.564\nwe've got our episode starting up next.\n\n226\n00:09:49.564 --> 00:09:56.309\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
