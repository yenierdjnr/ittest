Networking Fundamentals for\nExam 98-366.\n\n4\n00:00:13.483 --> 00:00:15.891\nIf you're looking for\na career in networking, but\n\n5\n00:00:15.891 --> 00:00:18.980\nyou have no networking experience,\nyou're in the right place.\n\n6\n00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.754\nThis is where we will talk about some\nof the basic fundamental concepts that\n\n7\n00:00:23.754 --> 00:00:28.551\nyou need to have at least knowledge of\nas you go into a career in networking.\n\n8\n00:00:28.551 --> 00:00:32.458\nSo this show will help you out,\nif you are actually preparing for that.\n\n9\n00:00:32.458 --> 00:00:37.357\nSo the way that we'll actually cover this,\nof course is based on the official exam\n\n10\n00:00:37.357 --> 00:00:42.045\nobjectives found from the Microsoft\nwebsite that has details about the exam.\n\n11\n00:00:42.045 --> 00:00:44.678\nIt'll also help you to get ready for\nthe exam too.\n\n12\n00:00:44.678 --> 00:00:46.830\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at that website.\n\n13\n00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.843\nNow I pulled this up by simply\nin my favorite search engine,\n\n14\n00:00:51.843 --> 00:00:54.464\ntyping in exam 98-366.\n\n15\n00:00:54.464 --> 00:00:57.343\nThis exam has been around for\na while as you can see.\n\n16\n00:00:57.343 --> 00:01:01.213\nBut over here on the right-hand side, this\nis kinda the most important part is that\n\n17\n00:01:01.213 --> 00:01:04.718\nif you're actually right here in the US,\nit'll cost you about $127.\n\n18\n00:01:04.718 --> 00:01:07.949\nIf you're outside the United States,\nmake sure you click on this link.\n\n19\n00:01:07.949 --> 00:01:10.757\nThat will, of course,\ntell you what the price is gonna be for\n\n20\n00:01:10.757 --> 00:01:12.755\nwherever you'll be scheduling the exam.\n\n21\n00:01:12.755 --> 00:01:17.144\nWhen you're ready after your studying\nto prepare to take the exam,\n\n22\n00:01:17.144 --> 00:01:21.233\nyou can schedule a Certiport or\nPeasron VUE from this website.\n\n23\n00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:25.109\nYou can click on it and find out\ndetails about what you need to do, and\n\n24\n00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:27.295\nget registered for that exam as well.\n\n25\n00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:31.717\nYou'll make sure that you have to, of\ncourse, pay the actual fee for the exam as\n\n26\n00:01:31.717 --> 00:01:35.624\nwell as understand their instructions and\nbe there in plenty of time.\n\n27\n00:01:35.624 --> 00:01:38.725\nMake sure that everything is\nactually going to be what you need.\n\n28\n00:01:38.725 --> 00:01:39.990\nNow during our show,\n\n29\n00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.493\nwhat we are going to be covering is\ngonna be underneath the skills measured.\n\n30\n00:01:44.493 --> 00:01:47.685\nSo this website will help\nyou to be able to do that.\n\n31\n00:01:47.685 --> 00:01:52.455\nNow even though they list a bunch of\ndifferent things that we'll be covering,\n\n32\n00:01:52.455 --> 00:01:57.370\nwell, this one's a little bit unusual in\nthe very the fact that they've updated\n\n33\n00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.063\nthe exam objective\na little bit of time ago.\n\n34\n00:02:00.063 --> 00:02:03.574\nIf I scroll in on the last\nparagraph right before,\n\n35\n00:02:03.574 --> 00:02:08.855\nit tells you that there have been\nupdates as of January 31st, 2018.\n\n36\n00:02:08.855 --> 00:02:12.839\nSo that means what you'll actually\nget is this, click on this link.\n\n37\n00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:17.108\nAnd when you click on this link,\nit'll download for you a PDF and\n\n38\n00:02:17.108 --> 00:02:20.206\nthat PDF will have\nthe exam objective update.\n\n39\n00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:23.568\nSo the way that outlook, of course\nis now when you take a look at it,\n\n40\n00:02:23.568 --> 00:02:25.669\nyou will end up seeing\nthat you will get a,\n\n41\n00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:28.575\nyou'll downloads a document\nthat would look like this.\n\n42\n00:02:28.575 --> 00:02:33.124\nAnd then it will give you all of\nthe different topics and different\n\n43\n00:02:33.124 --> 00:02:38.761\ntechnologies that would be covering in\nthe networking fundamentals, as well.\n\n44\n00:02:38.761 --> 00:02:41.049\nSo the way that we cover\nthis is out of order.\n\n45\n00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.981\nA more logical order here and I start\noff with understanding protocols, and\n\n46\n00:02:45.981 --> 00:02:47.300\nservices.\n\n47\n00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.006\nWe'll be taking a look at the OSI model,\nas well as the IP addressing\n\n48\n00:02:51.006 --> 00:02:55.507\nthat you'll be using and the two different\nversions that are out there right now.\n\n49\n00:02:55.507 --> 00:02:59.681\nThe understanding of name resolution and\nwhy it's so important to us as well as\n\n50\n00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:04.173\ndifferent services you're likely to\nencounter in a business-like environment,\n\n51\n00:03:04.173 --> 00:03:06.781\nand what those things actually do for\nyou, too.\n\n52\n00:03:06.781 --> 00:03:11.875\nAnd then of course, the basic protocol\nof the internet itself which is TCP/IP.\n\n53\n00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:15.742\nWe'll take a look at the tools that are\nactually there for us, so that we can do\n\n54\n00:03:15.742 --> 00:03:18.912\na little bit of troubleshooting\non our own in terms of network.\n\n55\n00:03:18.912 --> 00:03:23.443\nIn that point, we will also end up\naddressing networking hardware.\n\n56\n00:03:23.443 --> 00:03:27.336\nNetworking hardware will allow us to\nunderstand more about switches and\n\n57\n00:03:27.336 --> 00:03:28.291\nwhat they do, and\n\n58\n00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:32.332\nsome of the different details on how\nthey end up working as well as routers.\n\n59\n00:03:32.332 --> 00:03:37.510\nAnd of course, media types that you'll\nencounter as you usually do networking.\n\n60\n00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.620\nNow to wrap everything up with all\nof the different concepts that we've\n\n61\n00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.380\nbeen talking about as well\nas the network hardware,\n\n62\n00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.250\nwe would then, we'll tie that all together\nin understanding network infrastructures.\n\n63\n00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.666\nWe'll talk about LANS and\nWANS as well as internet, externet and\n\n64\n00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:56.327\ninternet concepts that are out there.\n\n65\n00:03:56.327 --> 00:03:59.503\nUnderstand a little bit more\nabout wireless networking,\n\n66\n00:03:59.503 --> 00:04:03.734\nas well as this idea of the different\nnetwork depologies and access methods.\n\n67\n00:04:03.734 --> 00:04:08.745\nSo if you are actually ready to take\nyour first step forward towards\n\n68\n00:04:08.745 --> 00:04:13.487\nlearning more about networking and\na networking career in IT,\n\n69\n00:04:13.487 --> 00:04:19.768\nthis is the right place and it begins with\nyour very next click on the first episode.\n\n70\n00:04:19.768 -->
