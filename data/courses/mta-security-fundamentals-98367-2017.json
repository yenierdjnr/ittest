00:00:08.201\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.201 --> 00:00:10.731\nYou're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.731 --> 00:00:13.803\n&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome to ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:13.803 --> 00:00:15.841\nI'm your host Peter VanRysdam, and\n\n7\n00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:19.268\ntoday we are starting our\nMTA Security Fundamentals course.\n\n8\n00:00:19.268 --> 00:00:22.660\nAnd specifically in this episode, we're\ngonna talk about core security principles.\n\n9\n00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.598\nAnd here to help us understand those,\n\n10\n00:00:24.598 --> 00:00:28.190\nwe have the expert on core security\nprinciples, Mr. Mike Roderick.\n\n11\n00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.250\nMike, how you doing?\n\n12\n00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.602\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great Peter,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n13\n00:00:30.602 --> 00:00:34.292\nAnd yeah, we wanna start off with\nthe MTA series, this particular one,\n\n14\n00:00:34.292 --> 00:00:38.528\nSecurity Fundamentals is we really need to\nmake sure that we're all on the same page\n\n15\n00:00:38.528 --> 00:00:40.490\nwhen it comes to those core concepts.\n\n16\n00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.438\nSome terminology, some basic concepts that\nwe need in order to progress one through\n\n17\n00:00:45.438 --> 00:00:50.037\nthis course and pass the exam, as well as\nif we want to get into managing servers\n\n18\n00:00:50.037 --> 00:00:53.670\nand we want to get into security\nas our field of expertise.\n\n19\n00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.673\nThese are going to be\nimportant foundational skills.\n\n20\n00:00:56.673 --> 00:00:59.990\nSo the first thing we really wanna talk\nabout is something that you might or\n\n21\n00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.590\nmight not have heard already, and that\nsomething known as the CIA Triad, Peter.\n\n22\n00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.420\nIt's a very important part of security.\n\n23\n00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.030\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like CIA would be something that\nwe'd be talking about in security, but\n\n24\n00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.430\nthis isn't that CIA, right?\n\n25\n00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.040\n&gt;&gt; Not the same, no not\nthe governmental agency in this case.\n\n26\n00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.750\nWhen we talk about the CIA triad,\n\n27\n00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.590\nwe're really talking about\nthree core security principles.\n\n28\n00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.770\nYou can think of them,\nthey always use the old tripod thing or\n\n29\n00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.390\na little three-legged stool.\n\n30\n00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.860\nWithout one of these,\nit just doesn't stand up, right?\n\n31\n00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.150\nSo these are the three core principles\nthat we need to be familiar with.\n\n32\n00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.680\nIt's really goals that we're striving for\n\n33\n00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.470\nwhen we try to secure our environment,\nright?\n\n34\n00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.730\nAnd those are gonna be confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability.\n\n35\n00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.900\nThose three things, hence the CIA,\nconfidentiality, integrity, and\n\n36\n00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.970\navailability.\n\n37\n00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.885\nSo let's break each one of them down and\ntalk a little bit about what they mean.\n\n38\n00:01:49.885 --> 00:01:53.710\nNow when we talk about confidentiality,\nPeter, this is something that I think most\n\n39\n00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.180\npeople have a pretty good understanding\nof what the concept means, right?\n\n40\n00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.900\nYou have things in your life that you\ndon't want the public to know, right?\n\n41\n00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.270\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and\na lot of it is on my computer.\n\n42\n00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.086\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, everybody is familiar with,\n\n43\n00:02:07.086 --> 00:02:10.026\nI don't want my Social Security\nnumber getting out there.\n\n44\n00:02:10.026 --> 00:02:13.955\nMaybe my bank account information,\nhow much money I have in the bank, right,\n\n45\n00:02:13.955 --> 00:02:16.100\nwe don't want everybody to know that.\n\n46\n00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.380\nWe want to keep that\ninformation confidential.\n\n47\n00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.530\nMy health records, things like that.\n\n48\n00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.195\nWell, when it comes to our computers and\nour networks, as you said, Peter, a lot of\n\n49\n00:02:23.195 --> 00:02:28.450\ninformation's stored on our systems, on\nour computers, on servers in our network.\n\n50\n00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.500\nAnd we wanna make sure that\nonly authorized people\n\n51\n00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.710\nare allowed to access the information.\n\n52\n00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.960\nThat means we want to maintain or\nprovide for confidentiality.\n\n53\n00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.160\nWe wanna make sure that only those\nthat should be able to access it\n\n54\n00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.230\nare able to access it.\n\n55\n00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.912\nAnd that includes data, information,\nIt includes access to the networks, right?\n\n56\n00:02:46.912 --> 00:02:49.720\nIf you're not authorized, you shouldn't\nbe able to connect to our network.\n\n57\n00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.720\nOr if you're not authorized, you shouldn't\nbe able to log on to our systems or\n\n58\n00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.240\nconnect to our servers.\n\n59\n00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.970\nSo it's really all about\npreventing unauthorized access.\n\n60\n00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.330\nNow another thing that really\ngoes along with confidentiality\n\n61\n00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.730\nis something known as data classification.\n\n62\n00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.660\nBecause if we think about the information\nthat we deal with on a daily basis,\n\n63\n00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.080\none in your personal life, but\n\n64\n00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.820\nalso in a work environment,\nnot all data is the same, right?\n\n65\n00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.790\nThere's some information that\nI wanna keep confidential,\n\n66\n00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.930\nlike how much money I\nhave in my bank account.\n\n67\n00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.510\nBut Peter, I want you to know\nwhen my birthday is because\n\n68\n00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:21.790\nI want presents, right?\n\n69\n00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.570\nSo that information would not\nbe considered confidential.\n\n70\n00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.062\n&gt;&gt; So this is similar to what we talk\nabout with government information.\n\n71\n00:03:29.062 --> 00:03:31.540\nYou've got top secret, you've got\nclassified, code word clearance.\n\n72\n00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.150\nThat's kind of the different\nlevels you're saying here?\n\n73\n00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.940\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right,\nthat's exactly what it is.\n\n74\n00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.430\nWe're familiar with the movies,\nwith the government classifications,\n\n75\n00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.880\nbut private companies, public companies,\nwe all do the same thing.\n\n76\n00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.480\nBecause when we talk about\napplying confidentiality,\n\n77\n00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.310\nthere's work involved in\napplying that confidentiality.\n\n78\n00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.620\nIt's not as easy as just saying okay,\nkeep that information confidential.\n\n79\n00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.679\nWe've gotta figure out how we're\ngonna restrict access to it.\n\n80\n00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:56.115\nWe've gotta implement procedures and\ntechnologies,\n\n81\n00:03:56.115 --> 00:03:58.140\nwe have man-hours to maintain that.\n\n82\n00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.830\nSo we classify data so\n\n83\n00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.260\nthat we can determine what level of\nconfidentiality we need to apply.\n\n84\n00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.080\nIf you don't classify your information,\nthen you really only have two choices.\n\n85\n00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.640\nTreat everything as confidential and\n\n86\n00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.640\ntry to protect everything, which is\nreally expensive and a lot of work.\n\n87\n00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.731\nOr, treat everything as public, right,\nwhich is usually not the case because I\n\n88\n00:04:19.731 --> 00:04:24.066\nhave information, payroll, healthcare\nstuff, Information about my employees,\n\n89\n00:04:24.066 --> 00:04:27.156\ncredit card information I might\nbe storing from customers.\n\n90\n00:04:27.156 --> 00:04:31.120\nWe have confidential information, so\nthe second option doesn't work either.\n\n91\n00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.980\nSo what we' do is we classify\nour information using,\n\n92\n00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.610\nlike Peter said, the military example.\n\n93\n00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.580\nOr your organization might make up\nyour own level of classification and\n\n94\n00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.570\nthen that allows me to apply\nthe appropriate level of confidentiality.\n\n95\n00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.170\nIf it's publicly available that\nanybody should be able to get to\n\n96\n00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.720\nlike my company's information,\nwhat we sell, what we're about,\n\n97\n00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.390\nthings like that,\nI can make that available to the public.\n\n98\n00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.058\nBut if it's our financials from\nthe previous year, that's confidential.\n\n99\n00:05:00.058 --> 00:05:05.300\nBy classifying it, I can now make\nsure that the company financial data\n\n100\n00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.110\nis treated differently than\nthat public information.\n\n101\n00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.760\nSo that's first leg there\nis that confidentiality.\n\n102\n00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.490\n&gt;&gt; All right, so that covers\nconfidentiality and next we had integrity?\n\n103\n00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.740\n&gt;&gt; Integrity, right,\nthat second leg of our CIA triad.\n\n104\n00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.140\nIntegrity is about making sure that\ninformation or data is not modified\n\n105\n00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.970\neither in an unintentional or\na malicious and intentional way.\n\n106\n00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.750\nIt's really all about just making\nsure the data's not changed\n\n107\n00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.380\nwithout us intending to change it, right?\n\n108\n00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.880\nIf we have information like\ncompany records or sales receipts,\n\n109\n00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.860\nI don't want that information being stored\non a system and then somebody modifying it\n\n110\n00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.220\neither accidentally or maliciously to make\nit look like we sold more than we did or\n\n111\n00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.450\nchanging pay rates, or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n112\n00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.290\nSo integrity, very important,\n\n113\n00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:59.420\nis to make sure the data's not modified\nwithout the proper authorization, right?\n\n114\n00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.970\nAnd there's a couple of\nways we can use integrity,\n\n115\n00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.680\nit's used all the time behind the scenes\nin a lot of stuff that we don't see.\n\n116\n00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.270\nWhen we talk about our data that travels\nout to the Internet and back, each one of\n\n117\n00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.150\nthose little packets has integrity checks\nin it to make sure that it travels across\n\n118\n00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.400\nthe Internet and back to your computer\nthat it's not modified, either\n\n119\n00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.700\nmaliciously by a bad guy, or just through\nnormal errors in data transmission.\n\n120\n00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.790\nI wanna make sure that the web\npage presents properly.\n\n121\n00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.130\nWhen we look at our system files on\nour computer, or operating system,\n\n122\n00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.340\nevery time we start it up,\nit checks those really important files to\n\n123\n00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.350\nmake sure they haven't been\nmodified by malware, right?\n\n124\n00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.610\nIt's doing integrity checks on itself,\non it's own system files.\n\n125\n00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.460\nSo it's an important part of\nkeeping our information and\n\n126\n00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.180\nour network secure is integrity.\n\n127\n00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.340\nWe can look at a few different\nways of providing integrity.\n\n128\n00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.330\nWe can use authentication and\nauthorization, right?\n\n129\n00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.670\nYou might think well wait,\nhow is that gonna give me integrity?\n\n130\n00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:59.960\nWell, if you can't authenticate,\nif you can't login to the system, or\n\n131\n00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.180\nif you don't have permissions\nto write to that file,\n\n132\n00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.210\nyou're gonna find it very difficult\nto make changes to the file.\n\n133\n00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.240\nTherefore, I'm providing\nintegrity over that file, right?\n\n134\n00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.490\nWe can audit.\n\n135\n00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.800\nDoesn't do a lot for\npreventing changes, but\n\n136\n00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.520\nit will let me know that\nthere has been changes.\n\n137\n00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.340\nAnd I can determine\nwhether there should or\n\n138\n00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.860\nshould not have been those changes, right?\n\n139\n00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.490\nWe can audit,\nwe can track who accessed that file last?\n\n140\n00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:24.970\nDid they make any changes?\n\n141\n00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.670\nWhen did they make those changes?\n\n142\n00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:30.730\nSo again, the change already occurred,\nso it doesn't really provide integrity.\n\n143\n00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:34.550\nBut it does give me the ability to\nvalidate my integrity, to say no,\n\n144\n00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.380\nthis file hasn't changed.\n\n145\n00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.460\nWith a lot of these regulations that\nwe have to deal with, I didn't mention\n\n146\n00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:44.520\nthis confidentiality, but just as a\nbusiness, we want good security practices.\n\n147\n00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.110\nBut a lot of businesses have to follow\nregulations that are either industry or\n\n148\n00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:52.233\ngovernmental regulations like HIPAA or\nSarbanes-Oxley.\n\n149\n00:07:52.233 --> 00:07:56.654\nAnd a lot of these regulations require\nthat you track integrity, right?\n\n150\n00:07:56.654 --> 00:08:01.128\nThat you can validate that that customer's\nor that patient's information Has not been\n\n151\n00:08:01.128 --> 00:08:04.320\nmodified either accidentally or\nmaliciously, right?\n\n152\n00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:04.986\nProvide that integrity.\n\n153\n00:08:04.986 --> 00:08:08.048\nAnd we have to prove that we have\nsystems in place to provide that, so\n\n154\n00:08:08.048 --> 00:08:10.630\nit's a very important part of security.\n\n155\n00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.830\nWe can also do something known as hashing.\n\n156\n00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:17.330\nNow we're not gonna get into the whole\nalgorithm here or anything like that, but\n\n157\n00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.970\nit is important we understand the concept.\n\n158\n00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.610\nBecause when it comes to providing\nintegrity, hashing is a big part of it.\n\n159\n00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:29.340\nWhat it is is just a mathematical formula\nthat I can take a file or a whole set\n\n160\n00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:34.520\nof files or whatever I want and I can run\nit through this mathematical algorithm.\n\n161\n00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.900\nAnd what comes out the other end is\na value, known as a hash value or\n\n162\n00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.550\na message digest.\n\n163\n00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:43.860\nAnd every time I run those set of files or\nthat file or\n\n164\n00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:47.045\nwhatever it is, every time I run\nit through that hashing algorithm,\n\n165\n00:08:47.045 --> 00:08:52.510\nit's always gonna generate the exact\nsame message digest for hash value.\n\n166\n00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.620\nIf I come back next week and\nI run it through there again, and\n\n167\n00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.240\nthat values has changed,\nthat's my indicator.\n\n168\n00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.950\nHey, something has changed,\n\n169\n00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:04.080\ncuz if nothing has change there\nwill always output the same value.\n\n170\n00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:09.700\nIf the value changes I know something in\nthat file, or set of files, has changed.\n\n171\n00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:10.260\nSo, again,\n\n172\n00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:15.600\nit's one of those things that allows me to\nverify that a file has not been modified.\n\n173\n00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.480\nNow this is something you do when you\ndownload stuff from the Internet.\n\n174\n00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.678\nA lot of times you'll see an MD5 value.\n\n175\n00:09:21.678 --> 00:09:24.590\nYou're like, what the heck is that\nbig old long string of numbers?\n\n176\n00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:28.640\nWell that's the hash digest or the message\ndigest and what they want you to do is\n\n177\n00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.080\ndownload the file,\nrun it through a little hashing algorithm,\n\n178\n00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:36.040\ngenerate that value and compare it to\nthe one they have up on their website.\n\n179\n00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.440\nIf those match that means your download\nis complete, nothing got corrupted in\n\n180\n00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:43.030\nthe process and you've got an exact\ncopy of what's on that website.\n\n181\n00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:46.660\nIf they don't match, something went\nwrong and I can go download it again.\n\n182\n00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.070\nMaybe somebody tried to slip\nsome malware in there, right?\n\n183\n00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.720\nSo this is how we provide for\nthat integrity.\n\n184\n00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.610\nSo that's our second leg of the CIA triad.\n\n185\n00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:58.580\n&gt;&gt; Okay so confidentiality, integrity and\nfinally we have availability.\n\n186\n00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:02.830\nAre we talking about having access\nto your content, to your data.\n\n187\n00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:06.470\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, I mean a lot of people think\nwell how does that mean security, right?\n\n188\n00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:10.140\nAvailability doesn't sound\nlike a security thing\n\n189\n00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.660\nto use our technical jargon,\na thing there.\n\n190\n00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:13.850\nBut it is.\n\n191\n00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:15.850\nIt is a big part of security.\n\n192\n00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:19.800\nAnd when we, we can easily\ntake security too far, right.\n\n193\n00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.630\nIf I take that data,\nthat company information,\n\n194\n00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:27.130\nI put it on a server and I encrypt it and\nI unplug the network cable.\n\n195\n00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:27.980\nThat data is pretty safe.\n\n196\n00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.666\nIt's gonna be very difficult for somebody\nto make changes or steal that information.\n\n197\n00:10:31.666 --> 00:10:33.092\nBut also means that Peter,\n\n198\n00:10:33.092 --> 00:10:36.200\nwhen you go to do you job,\nyou can't get to the data either.\n\n199\n00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.431\nAnd that's not gonna do you any good,\n\n200\n00:10:38.431 --> 00:10:42.543\nso making sure that data is available\nis a big part of security as well,\n\n201\n00:10:42.543 --> 00:10:46.950\nbecause if you can't get to\nthe information, it's kind of useless.\n\n202\n00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.390\n&gt;&gt; It sounds like yeah,\nthe most secure way would just be to have\n\n203\n00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:52.330\nno one be able to access the content,\nbut that's not an ideal situation,\n\n204\n00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:56.120\nso kind of finding that middle ground or\nthat happy medium there.\n\n205\n00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.570\nSo what's next to talk about here?\n\n206\n00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:58.670\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so let's finish.\n\n207\n00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:59.640\nA couple more things I want to do.\n\n208\n00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.580\nI want to talk about availability\nbecause it's not just making sure that\n\n209\n00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:03.270\npeople have access.\n\n210\n00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:07.120\nIt's also thinking about\nthings like redundancy.\n\n211\n00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.880\nWhen we look at threats to availability,\nthey can be accidental or\n\n212\n00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.900\nthey can be natural or they can be\nintentional or deliberate I guess.\n\n213\n00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:15.880\nSo accidental,\n\n214\n00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.170\nthings like natural disaster\n&gt;&gt; Fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, equipment\n\n215\n00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:25.630\nfailure, power supply failures, hard drive\nfailures, unplanned network outages.\n\n216\n00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:28.870\nThese would be accidental\ntypes of availability issues.\n\n217\n00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:33.440\nAnd we can do things about it, we can move\nto the area where there are no tornadoes,\n\n218\n00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.590\nor we can have redundant power supplies,\nmultiple power supplies so\n\n219\n00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:40.610\nthat if one fails the other one continues\non and people can still get to my website.\n\n220\n00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:43.450\nBecause if they can't get to my website,\nI can't sell product.\n\n221\n00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:44.970\nI make no money, right?\n\n222\n00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:48.220\nSo we want to making sure\nwe have that availability.\n\n223\n00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:51.310\nDeliberate might be things like attacks,\n\n224\n00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:57.630\nbad guys doing DOS or\ndenial of service attacks, or malware.\n\n225\n00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:01.690\nThings like that would be deliberate\nexploitation of vulnerabilities they\n\n226\n00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:02.930\nfind in our system.\n\n227\n00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:05.800\nEither one would be considered\nan availability issue.\n\n228\n00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.660\nHow we deal with them is gonna\ndiffer a little bit, right?\n\n229\n00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:13.900\nWe have different ways of dealing with say\nprotection from hurricanes than we do with\n\n230\n00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.530\nthe threat of a bad guy stealing our data.\n\n231\n00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:20.400\nBut in the end,\nthey both apply to availability and\n\n232\n00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.160\nwe need to make sure that\nour data's available.\n\n233\n00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.550\nSo, three big things there\nwith that CIA triad.\n\n234\n00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:28.170\nRemember, confidentiality Integrity and\navailability.\n\n235\n00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:31.570\nJust have a good general understanding\nof what those terms mean,\n\n236\n00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.390\nhow we provide them, right?\n\n237\n00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:36.490\nAnd what tools and techniques\nwe can use to provide for those.\n\n238\n00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:39.400\nAll right,\nnext thing we want to talk about Peter,\n\n239\n00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.690\nnow that we've got those basic\nterms there out of the way,\n\n240\n00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:48.520\nlet's talk a little bit about risk\nanalysis and threats, all right?\n\n241\n00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:52.420\nSo we'll start off with a couple terms and\nwe talk about risk.\n\n242\n00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.010\nRisk can be defined in\na couple of different ways.\n\n243\n00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:56.820\nAnd it can be a little confusing.\n\n244\n00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:00.640\nBut for now what we're gonna is we're\ngonna say risk is the probability\n\n245\n00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.620\nthat an event will occur, right?\n\n246\n00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.840\nWe're looking at things\nthat can impact us and\n\n247\n00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.470\nwhat the likelyhood is of that occurring.\n\n248\n00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:14.140\nNow interesting thing with risk\nis risk can be both good and bad.\n\n249\n00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.630\nMost people don't think of it that way.\n\n250\n00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:20.570\nWhen you hear the term risk and\nwe think bad things like risk of a fire or\n\n251\n00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:23.970\nrisk of theft,\nrisk of getting hit by a car.\n\n252\n00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.310\nThese are typically what we think, but\n\n253\n00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:28.530\nthere's also the risk that you\nmight win the lottery right?\n\n254\n00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:30.750\nWhich the outcome of that\nwould be a good thing.\n\n255\n00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:34.820\nBut we typically don't have to worry about\nthose because the outcome is good, right?\n\n256\n00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:38.850\nThere's a risk that my company just,\nI don't know, gets\n\n257\n00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:42.990\nplugged on some website and then all of a\nsudden we triple our business in a month.\n\n258\n00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:46.660\nThat's a risk, but it's a good risk,\nwe typically don't worry about it.\n\n259\n00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:50.120\nBad risk is usually what we're thinking\nof when we talk about risk and risk\n\n260\n00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:54.350\nassessment, things with negative impacts\non our business, or on our information.\n\n261\n00:13:56.330 --> 00:14:01.860\nThreats are really the exploitation,\na threat is\n\n262\n00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:07.510\nsomebody acting on some of those risks or\nexposing some of those vulnerabilities.\n\n263\n00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:11.190\nLike we face the threat of somebody\nbreaking in because we have\n\n264\n00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:12.462\nbad locks on our door.\n\n265\n00:14:12.462 --> 00:14:18.110\nAll right, we've got a vulnerability, weak\nsecure lock on our door, the threat is\n\n266\n00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:23.080\nthat bad guy that finds it and then tries\nto come through that door, all right?\n\n267\n00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.540\nNow, usually when we talk about risk,\nwe talk about threats,\n\n268\n00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.330\nwe start off by defining what a threat is,\nwhat a risk is.\n\n269\n00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.684\nA vulnerability is\na weakness in a system or\n\n270\n00:14:32.684 --> 00:14:37.910\na piece of software that could\npotentially be exposed by a threat.\n\n271\n00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:42.068\nBut then we start tying it all together\nwith something known as risk management\n\n272\n00:14:42.068 --> 00:14:46.163\nand risk management is a whole nother\nfield unto itself, and we spend days and\n\n273\n00:14:46.163 --> 00:14:47.310\nweeks, and we have.\n\n274\n00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:51.070\nWe have great courses in our library\nthat deal with risk management, but\n\n275\n00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:52.910\nlet's talk about just\nthe basics of what it is.\n\n276\n00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:56.160\nWe should have an understanding of\nsome of, again, the terminology.\n\n277\n00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.470\nAnd the basic principles\nof risk management.\n\n278\n00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:03.490\nWe're talking about risk management,\nidentify, assess, and\n\n279\n00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:07.739\nprioritize your threats and risks,\nthat's really the core steps.\n\n280\n00:15:07.739 --> 00:15:11.360\nNow, I get it, that's a very\nsimplified view of risk management.\n\n281\n00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.270\nThere's a lot more to it but for\n\n282\n00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:17.120\nus, for this particular MTA series,\nwe can kind of leave it at that.\n\n283\n00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.890\nIdentify, assess, and\nprioritize threats and risks.\n\n284\n00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:23.520\nSo if we are going to do risk management,\nPeter, one of the first things we have to\n\n285\n00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.197\ndo is we have to think about\nwhat risks do we face, right?\n\n286\n00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:29.650\nHere our offices are in Florida.\n\n287\n00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:31.340\nSo when we think about risks,\n\n288\n00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.600\none of the things that might\ncome up are hurricanes, right.\n\n289\n00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:39.520\nSo what about avalanches, or volcanoes?\n\n290\n00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, considering we're\nabout a foot above sea level,\n\n291\n00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.580\nI'm thinking no on the avalanches and\nprobably no on the volcanoes.\n\n292\n00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.660\nI guess it could happen but\nlike you said, judging\n\n293\n00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:52.105\nthe chances of something happening,\nthat's going to be a really low risk.\n\n294\n00:15:52.105 --> 00:15:53.855\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and so\nthat's what we're trying to do.\n\n295\n00:15:53.855 --> 00:15:55.655\nThere's all kinds of risks out there.\n\n296\n00:15:55.655 --> 00:15:57.526\nWe don't have to worry about all of them.\n\n297\n00:15:57.526 --> 00:15:59.593\nIt's gonna be very specific\nto our environment,\n\n298\n00:15:59.593 --> 00:16:01.425\nespecially when it comes to natural risks.\n\n299\n00:16:01.425 --> 00:16:03.750\nBut those are the kind of\nthings we've gotta do.\n\n300\n00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:08.617\nWe're gonna look at Our environment, and\nsee what kind of risks we might face.\n\n301\n00:16:08.617 --> 00:16:11.414\nWe're gonna look at\nthe software that we run, and\n\n302\n00:16:11.414 --> 00:16:13.420\nthe operating systems that we run.\n\n303\n00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.540\nAnd whether or\nnot we're connected to the Internet, and\n\n304\n00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.370\nwhat levels of access we\nallow from the outside.\n\n305\n00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:23.590\nAll of these things are gonna give us an\nidea of what risks we have to face, right?\n\n306\n00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:27.750\nYou look at everything in your system,\nall your business processes,\n\n307\n00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:33.040\nall of your applications that you run, and\nyou try to figure out what kind of risks\n\n308\n00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.500\nthose expose to your organization and\nto your information.\n\n309\n00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.516\nSo that's the process of\nidentifying the risk, right.\n\n310\n00:16:38.516 --> 00:16:41.245\nWe don't have to worry about\ntornadoes here that much, but\n\n311\n00:16:41.245 --> 00:16:43.330\nwe do have to worry about hurricanes.\n\n312\n00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:47.550\nWe don't run Windows XP, so we don't have\nto worry about those vulnerabilities, but\n\n313\n00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:51.610\nthere are some vulnerabilities in Flash\nthat we run on some of our kiosk systems.\n\n314\n00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:55.510\nSo going through our environment and\ndetermining what risks we need to face,\n\n315\n00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:00.210\nthen we want to assess those risks.\n\n316\n00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:04.920\nAnd there's two big things we look at when\nwe're assessing risk, if I can say that,\n\n317\n00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.770\nlikelihood and impact.\n\n318\n00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:09.790\nOne, what is the likelihood\nof it occurring, all right?\n\n319\n00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:13.470\nAnd then two, if it does occur,\nwhat is the impact?\n\n320\n00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:17.390\nBecause these are two things that are\nreally gonna help me deal with the risk.\n\n321\n00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:18.920\nDetermine how much time and\n\n322\n00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:24.900\neffort I want to spend on trying to\nremove that risk if at all, right?\n\n323\n00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:28.562\nSo, if we look at things, like the one\nexample that just about every risk\n\n324\n00:17:28.562 --> 00:17:31.220\nmanagement course I think uses is meteors,\nright?\n\n325\n00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:35.370\nYeah, there's a risk for us getting\nhit by a meteor here in Florida.\n\n326\n00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:37.130\nSo, and the impact,\n\n327\n00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:42.140\nif we get hit by a meteor, it could\nbe pretty big, pretty devastating.\n\n328\n00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:45.500\nBut the likelihood is extremely low,\nright.\n\n329\n00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:50.230\nWe can go out and\nbuy meteorite insurance, but why, right?\n\n330\n00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:53.337\n&gt;&gt; You probably won't be there to\ncash it in if it does come up.\n\n331\n00:17:53.337 --> 00:17:55.240\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n332\n00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:59.030\nSo again, when you're doing your risk\nassessments and risk management,\n\n333\n00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:04.480\nyou're looking at two factors, the\nlikelihood and the impact on your systems.\n\n334\n00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.760\nWhat is the likelihood of it occurring?\n\n335\n00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.100\nAnd then if it does occur,\nhow bad is it gonna be?\n\n336\n00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.900\n&gt;&gt; And you talked about the accidental\na lot, the natural disasters and\n\n337\n00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:13.520\nthings like that.\n\n338\n00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:17.020\nBut there's also a lot of deliberate\nones that could come up and\n\n339\n00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.350\nbe case by case as well.\n\n340\n00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:21.169\nIf your data center is in\nthe middle of the desert or\n\n341\n00:18:21.169 --> 00:18:25.466\nif it's in the middle of an urban area,\nI worked in a building before where we\n\n342\n00:18:25.466 --> 00:18:30.480\nrealized the cable running down the side\nof the building was our T1 line coming in.\n\n343\n00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.450\nAnd, someone could just walk by and\ncut it if they wanted to, and\n\n344\n00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:35.550\nthat's a big risk, so something we\nhad to go ahead and take care of.\n\n345\n00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:36.400\n&gt;&gt; That was a huge risk.\n\n346\n00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:40.040\nAnd so you just decided that okay,\nthe likelihood of it occurring is probably\n\n347\n00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:43.849\npretty good because it's exposed,\nit's outside, nobody's monitoring it.\n\n348\n00:18:43.849 --> 00:18:47.498\nAnybody could walk up to it day or\nnight and the impact, that's our T1 line,\n\n349\n00:18:47.498 --> 00:18:50.098\nthat's our Internet access for\nthe entire business.\n\n350\n00:18:50.098 --> 00:18:54.240\nSo if it goes down, everything\nstops until we can get that fixed.\n\n351\n00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.880\nSo you decided to do something about it,\nbecause the likelihood was great and\n\n352\n00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:58.990\nthe impact was great.\n\n353\n00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:00.000\nAnd that's exactly what we do,\n\n354\n00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.560\nwe typically make what's\ncalled a risk matrix.\n\n355\n00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:06.863\nAnd we have the likelihood, you might\ndo it on a scale of one to five or\n\n356\n00:19:06.863 --> 00:19:11.632\none to ten for the likelihood, and\nthen our impact on a scale of one to five.\n\n357\n00:19:11.632 --> 00:19:13.540\nAnd then we can just multiply those.\n\n358\n00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:18.775\nSo if your risk has a likelihood of 3 and\nit has an impact of 4,\n\n359\n00:19:18.775 --> 00:19:24.034\n3 times 4 is 12,\nthat gives that risk a risk score of 12.\n\n360\n00:19:24.034 --> 00:19:28.663\nAnd this allows us to do the final step,\nwhich is the prioritization,\n\n361\n00:19:28.663 --> 00:19:30.790\nbecause where do I wanna focus?\n\n362\n00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:32.220\nI can't fix everything at once.\n\n363\n00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:37.240\nWe have a limited amount of resources,\ntime, man hours, money.\n\n364\n00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.090\nSo I can't just go out and\nfix everything all at once.\n\n365\n00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:43.020\nBut what I can do is\nprioritize those risks.\n\n366\n00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.100\nThose risks that had\na likelihood of one and\n\n367\n00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:49.690\nan impact of two, their risk score\nis only two times one is two.\n\n368\n00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:50.656\nThat's a lot lower than 12.\n\n369\n00:19:50.656 --> 00:19:53.870\nSo I'm gonna start with that guy\nthat has the risk score of 12.\n\n370\n00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:55.770\nLet's focus on that one first.\n\n371\n00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:57.470\nEventually we'll get\ndown to those lower ones,\n\n372\n00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:00.490\nwe're not gonna forget about them,\nbut we want to prioritize.\n\n373\n00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:03.490\nWe want to make sure we're\ngetting the highest impact,\n\n374\n00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:08.810\nhighest likelihood first and then working\nour way down through there, all right.\n\n375\n00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:12.780\nNow once we've done identify,\nassess and prioritize and\n\n376\n00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:16.630\ngenerate our risk matrix, then we've\ngotta decide what are we gonna do.\n\n377\n00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:19.210\nHow are we gonna deal with these risks?\n\n378\n00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:24.635\nAnd there's four primary responses that we\ncan do when we talk about risk management,\n\n379\n00:20:24.635 --> 00:20:28.820\navoidance, acceptance,\nmitigation and transfer, all right.\n\n380\n00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:33.000\nAnd we need to be familiar with what\neach one of these means in general.\n\n381\n00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.730\nAvoidance is a pretty straightforward one.\n\n382\n00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:40.850\nNow the risk is that we're running\nXP on an Internet-exposed computer.\n\n383\n00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:44.400\nThat's a big risk,\nthe likelihood of it getting hit is high.\n\n384\n00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.880\nI'd say at least a five on\na scale of one to five.\n\n385\n00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.365\nAnd the impact could also be huge,\nbecause it's connected to our network.\n\n386\n00:20:50.365 --> 00:20:52.712\nThey take over that machine and\nnow they can bounce around and\n\n387\n00:20:52.712 --> 00:20:54.103\nhit other machines on our network.\n\n388\n00:20:54.103 --> 00:20:56.644\nSo I'd say that's probably a 5\non the impact, so it's got a 25,\n\n389\n00:20:56.644 --> 00:20:58.490\nwe're gonna do something about it.\n\n390\n00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:01.840\nWhat do we do,\nget rid of Windows XP, right?\n\n391\n00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:05.310\nDon't use that software anymore,\navoid the risk all together.\n\n392\n00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:08.516\nThat's the idea behind avoidance.\n\n393\n00:21:08.516 --> 00:21:13.250\nHaving a public facing web server,\nthere's risk associated with that.\n\n394\n00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:16.680\nIf we're not a store where people\nneed to be able to come and shop,\n\n395\n00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:20.430\nif we're just putting up the website\nbecause everybody else has a website,\n\n396\n00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:24.980\nmaybe we avoid that risk all together and\ndon't run a website.\n\n397\n00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:26.850\nSo that would be avoidance.\n\n398\n00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:28.390\nThen you've got acceptance.\n\n399\n00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:32.230\nAcceptance means I'm\ngoing to live with it.\n\n400\n00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:34.060\nI'm okay with that, right?\n\n401\n00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:38.880\nMaybe the likelihood is not all that high,\nthe impact is fairly low, but\n\n402\n00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:42.150\nin order to get rid of the risk,\nit's gonna be expensive.\n\n403\n00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:46.535\nHere's an example,\nI just got back from a resort vacation,\n\n404\n00:21:46.535 --> 00:21:48.355\nand I was in one of their photo shops.\n\n405\n00:21:48.355 --> 00:21:50.987\nThey got the photographers that\nrun around, take your pictures and\n\n406\n00:21:50.987 --> 00:21:53.505\nthen charge you money\nto get your pictures.\n\n407\n00:21:53.505 --> 00:21:56.367\nAnd the screen that they were using,\nthe computer they're using to show you\n\n408\n00:21:56.367 --> 00:21:58.837\nthe pictures to see if you want to\nbuy them was running Windows XP.\n\n409\n00:21:58.837 --> 00:22:02.790\nAnd at the time of the filming,\nthis is 2017,\n\n410\n00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:07.000\nWindows XP is what 17,\n15 years old, a lot.\n\n411\n00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.080\nIt's no longer supported and\nthey're not making patches for it anymore.\n\n412\n00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:16.560\nExcept for that Wanna Cry,\nso it's a huge, huge risk.\n\n413\n00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:21.148\nBut, and I talked to them about it,\nthe software they were using was never\n\n414\n00:22:21.148 --> 00:22:23.888\nupdated to run on\nanything past Windows XP.\n\n415\n00:22:23.888 --> 00:22:26.581\nThey didn't want to invest\nin more software, so\n\n416\n00:22:26.581 --> 00:22:30.400\nthey made sure that that computer\nwas not connected to the Internet.\n\n417\n00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.110\nIt got a big sticker on it,\nit says no browsing, right?\n\n418\n00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:35.290\nSo what they did was\nthey accepted the risk.\n\n419\n00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:38.280\nThey actually did a little mitigation\nby disconnecting it from the network.\n\n420\n00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:42.000\nBut they're basically accepting it,\nsaying I know there's a risk, but\n\n421\n00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:42.770\nwe're okay with that.\n\n422\n00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:45.830\nBecause the cost that it would\ntake to fix doesn't outweigh\n\n423\n00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:48.360\nthe cost of the risk\nthat we're facing there.\n\n424\n00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.522\n&gt;&gt; And maybe in a situation like that,\nif that system were to go down,\n\n425\n00:22:51.522 --> 00:22:53.166\nmaybe they have backups in place.\n\n426\n00:22:53.166 --> 00:22:56.957\nSo it's not the kind of thing that's going\nto have a big impact on them as well,\n\n427\n00:22:56.957 --> 00:22:58.270\nif that risk does occur.\n\n428\n00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:01.090\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right, and maybe it's not\nconnected like you said to other systems.\n\n429\n00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:04.280\nSo if they did compromise it,\nthey wouldn't be able to get too far.\n\n430\n00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:08.127\nThen you've got mitigation, and mitigation\nmeans trying to deal with the risk, right,\n\n431\n00:23:08.127 --> 00:23:09.302\ndoing something about it.\n\n432\n00:23:09.302 --> 00:23:12.660\nThere's a risk in the software we're\nrunning, I'm gonna go talk to the vendor,\n\n433\n00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:13.840\nsee if they've got a patch.\n\n434\n00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.300\nI wanna apply those,\nI'm gonna update firmware.\n\n435\n00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.430\nI'm gonna put better locks on the doors.\n\n436\n00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:22.700\nI'm gonna train my employees\nin social engineering.\n\n437\n00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.420\nAll of this is mitigation techniques.\n\n438\n00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.618\nWe see the risk, we don't like it.\n\n439\n00:23:26.618 --> 00:23:29.060\nWe want to do something about it, so\n\n440\n00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:33.940\nwe're going to apply some type\nof control to mitigate or\n\n441\n00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:39.570\nreduce the impact and or\nthe likelihood of that risk.\n\n442\n00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:41.154\nAnd then the last one is transfer.\n\n443\n00:23:41.154 --> 00:23:44.840\nAnd when we talk about transfer,\nthis is typically insurance, right?\n\n444\n00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:48.500\nI have a risk, I'm just gonna\ntransfer that risk to somebody else.\n\n445\n00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.938\nI'm gonna pay company XYZ so\nmuch money a month, and\n\n446\n00:23:51.938 --> 00:23:56.786\nif that risk ever comes to fruition,\nwhatever they're insuring me for,\n\n447\n00:23:56.786 --> 00:23:59.534\nthey have to deal with the consequences.\n\n448\n00:23:59.534 --> 00:24:01.937\nIt's like car insurance, right,\nyou all have car insurance.\n\n449\n00:24:01.937 --> 00:24:07.950\nSo you pay a company so much money\na month to transfer the risk to them.\n\n450\n00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:10.580\nNow, when you wreck your car,\nthey have to fix it.\n\n451\n00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:14.600\nThey have to come out-of-pocket and\npay that money to get that car fixed.\n\n452\n00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.070\nSo you've transferred\nthe risk to somebody else.\n\n453\n00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:20.210\nYou see this a lot of times\nwhen we go to cloud, right?\n\n454\n00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:23.250\nWe're transferring some of that risk to\nthe cloud providers because now they're\n\n455\n00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:26.900\nresponsible for keeping those systems\nup to date and keeping them patched.\n\n456\n00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:32.140\nWe look at insurance on\nhigh profile people, right?\n\n457\n00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:35.810\nWhat is that,\nthe key personnel type insurance.\n\n458\n00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:40.280\nWhere if that person's ever gone, we've\ngot issues with the company because they\n\n459\n00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.640\nare the spokesperson,\nthe face of the company.\n\n460\n00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.790\nAnd if they leave we lose credibility.\n\n461\n00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:46.800\nSo maybe we have insurance\nagainst things like that.\n\n462\n00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.570\nBut we've basically transferred\nthe risk to somebody else.\n\n463\n00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.950\nNow one last concept,\nI know we're getting short on time,\n\n464\n00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:57.460\nthat I want to throw in here when we talk\nabout risk, and that's residual risk.\n\n465\n00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:02.460\nResidual risk is the risk\nthat's left after\n\n466\n00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.490\nyou've taken one of these risk responses.\n\n467\n00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:06.990\nWhether it's avoidance,\nacceptance, mitigation, transfer,\n\n468\n00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:10.210\nyou're going to have some risk left over.\n\n469\n00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:12.820\nI'll use the insurance example again.\n\n470\n00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:15.880\nNow I pay so\nmuch a month to my insurance company and\n\n471\n00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.260\nnow I've transferred that risk to them.\n\n472\n00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:21.360\nWhen I get in an accident they're\ngonna pay for it except for\n\n473\n00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.550\nmy deductible, right?\n\n474\n00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:25.280\nSo I still have a little\nbit of residual risk on me.\n\n475\n00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.920\nI have to pay that deductible\nbefore they actually take over and\n\n476\n00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:28.800\nmake the rest of the payment.\n\n477\n00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.956\nSo that's an example of residual risk.\n\n478\n00:25:30.956 --> 00:25:33.405\nOr maybe,\nwhat would be another good example?\n\n479\n00:25:33.405 --> 00:25:35.457\nYou-\n&gt;&gt; Also in the insurance examples,\n\n480\n00:25:35.457 --> 00:25:38.018\na lot of times they'll\nhave a maximum payout.\n\n481\n00:25:38.018 --> 00:25:41.130\nSo they'll cover your\naccident up to $100,000, or\n\n482\n00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:43.282\nthe bodily injury up to a certain amount.\n\n483\n00:25:43.282 --> 00:25:46.130\nSo, beyond that,\nif it's something that's gonna keep going,\n\n484\n00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:47.445\nthat's something you're responsible for.\n\n485\n00:25:47.445 --> 00:25:50.510\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and we could use that\nXP one for an example as well.\n\n486\n00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:53.460\nThey had some residual risk there.\n\n487\n00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.690\nThey still ran XP.\n\n488\n00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:55.970\nThey've done what they could.\n\n489\n00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:59.640\nThey disconnected from the internet or\nthey'd maybe leave it connected but\n\n490\n00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.980\nhave a sticker on it\nthat says no browsing.\n\n491\n00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:04.960\nOkay, but there's still the risk\nthat somebody says, yeah,\n\n492\n00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.510\nI can't read English and\nI'm gonna go ahead and browse anyway.\n\n493\n00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:11.930\nOr somebody, a guest gets physical access\nto that machine and tries to do something.\n\n494\n00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:13.980\nSo they didn't eliminate\nthe risk all together.\n\n495\n00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.970\nThat's that residual\nrisk that's left over.\n\n496\n00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:19.549\nAll right, so I know we've got\na lot more topics here to cover.\n\n497\n00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:21.984\nOr the next one, some quick ones,\nor should we go ahead and\n\n498\n00:26:21.984 --> 00:26:22.988\nsave that for part two?\n\n499\n00:26:22.988 --> 00:26:24.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, rather than rush through it,\nlet's save it.\n\n500\n00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:25.620\nLet's do a part two.\n\n501\n00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:28.304\nIt might not be a full length, but\nI don't wanna rush through any of this.\n\n502\n00:26:28.304 --> 00:26:29.160\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds good, Mike.\n\n503\n00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:32.480\nWell we've got some more core security\nprinciples to talk about, but\n\n504\n00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.580\nwe're gonna do that in part two.\n\n505\n00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:35.132\nSo we're gonna go ahead and sign off now.\n\n506\n00:26:35.132 --> 00:26:37.850\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nPeter VanRysdam.\n\n507\n00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:38.770\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n508\n00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:39.640\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n509\n00:26:39.640 -->
