00:00:08.201\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.201 --> 00:00:10.731\nYou're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.731 --> 00:00:13.803\n&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome to ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:13.803 --> 00:00:15.841\nI'm your host Peter VanRysdam, and\n\n7\n00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:19.268\ntoday we are starting our\nMTA Security Fundamentals course.\n\n8\n00:00:19.268 --> 00:00:22.660\nAnd specifically in this episode, we're\ngonna talk about core security principles.\n\n9\n00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.598\nAnd here to help us understand those,\n\n10\n00:00:24.598 --> 00:00:28.190\nwe have the expert on core security\nprinciples, Mr. Mike Roderick.\n\n11\n00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.250\nMike, how you doing?\n\n12\n00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.602\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great Peter,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n13\n00:00:30.602 --> 00:00:34.292\nAnd yeah, we wanna start off with\nthe MTA series, this particular one,\n\n14\n00:00:34.292 --> 00:00:38.528\nSecurity Fundamentals is we really need to\nmake sure that we're all on the same page\n\n15\n00:00:38.528 --> 00:00:40.490\nwhen it comes to those core concepts.\n\n16\n00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.438\nSome terminology, some basic concepts that\nwe need in order to progress one through\n\n17\n00:00:45.438 --> 00:00:50.037\nthis course and pass the exam, as well as\nif we want to get into managing servers\n\n18\n00:00:50.037 --> 00:00:53.670\nand we want to get into security\nas our field of expertise.\n\n19\n00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.673\nThese are going to be\nimportant foundational skills.\n\n20\n00:00:56.673 --> 00:00:59.990\nSo the first thing we really wanna talk\nabout is something that you might or\n\n21\n00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.590\nmight not have heard already, and that\nsomething known as the CIA Triad, Peter.\n\n22\n00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.420\nIt's a very important part of security.\n\n23\n00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.030\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like CIA would be something that\nwe'd be talking about in security, but\n\n24\n00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.430\nthis isn't that CIA, right?\n\n25\n00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.040\n&gt;&gt; Not the same, no not\nthe governmental agency in this case.\n\n26\n00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.750\nWhen we talk about the CIA triad,\n\n27\n00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.590\nwe're really talking about\nthree core security principles.\n\n28\n00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.770\nYou can think of them,\nthey always use the old tripod thing or\n\n29\n00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.390\na little three-legged stool.\n\n30\n00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.860\nWithout one of these,\nit just doesn't stand up, right?\n\n31\n00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.150\nSo these are the three core principles\nthat we need to be familiar with.\n\n32\n00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.680\nIt's really goals that we're striving for\n\n33\n00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.470\nwhen we try to secure our environment,\nright?\n\n34\n00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.730\nAnd those are gonna be confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability.\n\n35\n00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.900\nThose three things, hence the CIA,\nconfidentiality, integrity, and\n\n36\n00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.970\navailability.\n\n37\n00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.885\nSo let's break each one of them down and\ntalk a little bit about what they mean.\n\n38\n00:01:49.885 --> 00:01:53.710\nNow when we talk about confidentiality,\nPeter, this is something that I think most\n\n39\n00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.180\npeople have a pretty good understanding\nof what the concept means, right?\n\n40\n00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.900\nYou have things in your life that you\ndon't want the public to know, right?\n\n41\n00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.270\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and\na lot of it is on my computer.\n\n42\n00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.086\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, everybody is familiar with,\n\n43\n00:02:07.086 --> 00:02:10.026\nI don't want my Social Security\nnumber getting out there.\n\n44\n00:02:10.026 --> 00:02:13.955\nMaybe my bank account information,\nhow much money I have in the bank, right,\n\n45\n00:02:13.955 --> 00:02:16.100\nwe don't want everybody to know that.\n\n46\n00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.380\nWe want to keep that\ninformation confidential.\n\n47\n00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.530\nMy health records, things like that.\n\n48\n00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.195\nWell, when it comes to our computers and\nour networks, as you said, Peter, a lot of\n\n49\n00:02:23.195 --> 00:02:28.450\ninformation's stored on our systems, on\nour computers, on servers in our network.\n\n50\n00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.500\nAnd we wanna make sure that\nonly authorized people\n\n51\n00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.710\nare allowed to access the information.\n\n52\n00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.960\nThat means we want to maintain or\nprovide for confidentiality.\n\n53\n00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.160\nWe wanna make sure that only those\nthat should be able to access it\n\n54\n00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.230\nare able to access it.\n\n55\n00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.912\nAnd that includes data, information,\nIt includes access to the networks, right?\n\n56\n00:02:46.912 --> 00:02:49.720\nIf you're not authorized, you shouldn't\nbe able to connect to our network.\n\n57\n00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.720\nOr if you're not authorized, you shouldn't\nbe able to log on to our systems or\n\n58\n00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.240\nconnect to our servers.\n\n59\n00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.970\nSo it's really all about\npreventing unauthorized access.\n\n60\n00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.330\nNow another thing that really\ngoes along with confidentiality\n\n61\n00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.730\nis something known as data classification.\n\n62\n00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.660\nBecause if we think about the information\nthat we deal with on a daily basis,\n\n63\n00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.080\none in your personal life, but\n\n64\n00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.820\nalso in a work environment,\nnot all data is the same, right?\n\n65\n00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.790\nThere's some information that\nI wanna keep confidential,\n\n66\n00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.930\nlike how much money I\nhave in my bank account.\n\n67\n00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.510\nBut Peter, I want you to know\nwhen my birthday is because\n\n68\n00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:21.790\nI want presents, right?\n\n69\n00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.570\nSo that information would not\nbe considered confidential.\n\n70\n00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.062\n&gt;&gt; So this is similar to what we talk\nabout with government information.\n\n71\n00:03:29.062 --> 00:03:31.540\nYou've got top secret, you've got\nclassified, code word clearance.\n\n72\n00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.150\nThat's kind of the different\nlevels you're saying here?\n\n73\n00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.940\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right,\nthat's exactly what it is.\n\n74\n00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.430\nWe're familiar with the movies,\nwith the government classifications,\n\n75\n00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.880\nbut private companies, public companies,\nwe all do the same thing.\n\n76\n00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.480\nBecause when we talk about\napplying confidentiality,\n\n77\n00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.310\nthere's work involved in\napplying that confidentiality.\n\n78\n00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.620\nIt's not as easy as just saying okay,\nkeep that information confidential.\n\n79\n00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.679\nWe've gotta figure out how we're\ngonna restrict access to it.\n\n80\n00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:56.115\nWe've gotta implement procedures and\ntechnologies,\n\n81\n00:03:56.115 --> 00:03:58.140\nwe have man-hours to maintain that.\n\n82\n00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.830\nSo we classify data so\n\n83\n00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.260\nthat we can determine what level of\nconfidentiality we need to apply.\n\n84\n00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.080\nIf you don't classify your information,\nthen you really only have two choices.\n\n85\n00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.640\nTreat everything as confidential and\n\n86\n00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.640\ntry to protect everything, which is\nreally expensive and a lot of work.\n\n87\n00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.731\nOr, treat everything as public, right,\nwhich is usually not the case because I\n\n88\n00:04:19.731 --> 00:04:24.066\nhave information, payroll, healthcare\nstuff, Information about my employees,\n\n89\n00:04:24.066 --> 00:04:27.156\ncredit card information I might\nbe storing from customers.\n\n90\n00:04:27.156 --> 00:04:31.120\nWe have confidential information, so\nthe second option doesn't work either.\n\n91\n00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.980\nSo what we' do is we classify\nour information using,\n\n92\n00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.610\nlike Peter said, the military example.\n\n93\n00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.580\nOr your organization might make up\nyour own level of classification and\n\n94\n00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.570\nthen that allows me to apply\nthe appropriate level of confidentiality.\n\n95\n00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.170\nIf it's publicly available that\nanybody should be able to get to\n\n96\n00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.720\nlike my company's information,\nwhat we sell, what we're about,\n\n97\n00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.390\nthings like that,\nI can make that available to the public.\n\n98\n00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.058\nBut if it's our financials from\nthe previous year, that's confidential.\n\n99\n00:05:00.058 --> 00:05:05.300\nBy classifying it, I can now make\nsure that the company financial data\n\n100\n00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.110\nis treated differently than\nthat public information.\n\n101\n00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.760\nSo that's first leg there\nis that confidentiality.\n\n102\n00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.490\n&gt;&gt; All right, so that covers\nconfidentiality and next we had integrity?\n\n103\n00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.740\n&gt;&gt; Integrity, right,\nthat second leg of our CIA triad.\n\n104\n00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.140\nIntegrity is about making sure that\ninformation or data is not modified\n\n105\n00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.970\neither in an unintentional or\na malicious and intentional way.\n\n106\n00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.750\nIt's really all about just making\nsure the data's not changed\n\n107\n00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.380\nwithout us intending to change it, right?\n\n108\n00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.880\nIf we have information like\ncompany records or sales receipts,\n\n109\n00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.860\nI don't want that information being stored\non a system and then somebody modifying it\n\n110\n00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.220\neither accidentally or maliciously to make\nit look like we sold more than we did or\n\n111\n00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.450\nchanging pay rates, or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n112\n00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.290\nSo integrity, very important,\n\n113\n00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:59.420\nis to make sure the data's not modified\nwithout the proper authorization, right?\n\n114\n00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.970\nAnd there's a couple of\nways we can use integrity,\n\n115\n00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.680\nit's used all the time behind the scenes\nin a lot of stuff that we don't see.\n\n116\n00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.270\nWhen we talk about our data that travels\nout to the Internet and back, each one of\n\n117\n00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.150\nthose little packets has integrity checks\nin it to make sure that it travels across\n\n118\n00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.400\nthe Internet and back to your computer\nthat it's not modified, either\n\n119\n00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.700\nmaliciously by a bad guy, or just through\nnormal errors in data transmission.\n\n120\n00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.790\nI wanna make sure that the web\npage presents properly.\n\n121\n00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.130\nWhen we look at our system files on\nour computer, or operating system,\n\n122\n00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.340\nevery time we start it up,\nit checks those really important files to\n\n123\n00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.350\nmake sure they haven't been\nmodified by malware, right?\n\n124\n00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.610\nIt's doing integrity checks on itself,\non it's own system files.\n\n125\n00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.460\nSo it's an important part of\nkeeping our information and\n\n126\n00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.180\nour network secure is integrity.\n\n127\n00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.340\nWe can look at a few different\nways of providing integrity.\n\n128\n00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.330\nWe can use authentication and\nauthorization, right?\n\n129\n00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.670\nYou might think well wait,\nhow is that gonna give me integrity?\n\n130\n00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:59.960\nWell, if you can't authenticate,\nif you can't login to the system, or\n\n131\n00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.180\nif you don't have permissions\nto write to that file,\n\n132\n00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.210\nyou're gonna find it very difficult\nto make changes to the file.\n\n133\n00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.240\nTherefore, I'm providing\nintegrity over that file, right?\n\n134\n00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.490\nWe can audit.\n\n135\n00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.800\nDoesn't do a lot for\npreventing changes, but\n\n136\n00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.520\nit will let me know that\nthere has been changes.\n\n137\n00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.340\nAnd I can determine\nwhether there should or\n\n138\n00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.860\nshould not have been those changes, right?\n\n139\n00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.490\nWe can audit,\nwe can track who accessed that file last?\n\n140\n00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:24.970\nDid they make any changes?\n\n141\n00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.670\nWhen did they make those changes?\n\n142\n00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:30.730\nSo again, the change already occurred,\nso it doesn't really provide integrity.\n\n143\n00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:34.550\nBut it does give me the ability to\nvalidate my integrity, to say no,\n\n144\n00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.380\nthis file hasn't changed.\n\n145\n00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.460\nWith a lot of these regulations that\nwe have to deal with, I didn't mention\n\n146\n00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:44.520\nthis confidentiality, but just as a\nbusiness, we want good security practices.\n\n147\n00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.110\nBut a lot of businesses have to follow\nregulations that are either industry or\n\n148\n00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:52.233\ngovernmental regulations like HIPAA or\nSarbanes-Oxley.\n\n149\n00:07:52.233 --> 00:07:56.654\nAnd a lot of these regulations require\nthat you track integrity, right?\n\n150\n00:07:56.654 --> 00:08:01.128\nThat you can validate that that customer's\nor that patient's information Has not been\n\n151\n00:08:01.128 --> 00:08:04.320\nmodified either accidentally or\nmaliciously, right?\n\n152\n00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:04.986\nProvide that integrity.\n\n153\n00:08:04.986 --> 00:08:08.048\nAnd we have to prove that we have\nsystems in place to provide that, so\n\n154\n00:08:08.048 --> 00:08:10.630\nit's a very important part of security.\n\n155\n00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.830\nWe can also do something known as hashing.\n\n156\n00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:17.330\nNow we're not gonna get into the whole\nalgorithm here or anything like that, but\n\n157\n00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.970\nit is important we understand the concept.\n\n158\n00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.610\nBecause when it comes to providing\nintegrity, hashing is a big part of it.\n\n159\n00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:29.340\nWhat it is is just a mathematical formula\nthat I can take a file or a whole set\n\n160\n00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:34.520\nof files or whatever I want and I can run\nit through this mathematical algorithm.\n\n161\n00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.900\nAnd what comes out the other end is\na value, known as a hash value or\n\n162\n00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.550\na message digest.\n\n163\n00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:43.860\nAnd every time I run those set of files or\nthat file or\n\n164\n00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:47.045\nwhatever it is, every time I run\nit through that hashing algorithm,\n\n165\n00:08:47.045 --> 00:08:52.510\nit's always gonna generate the exact\nsame message digest for hash value.\n\n166\n00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.620\nIf I come back next week and\nI run it through there again, and\n\n167\n00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.240\nthat values has changed,\nthat's my indicator.\n\n168\n00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.950\nHey, something has changed,\n\n169\n00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:04.080\ncuz if nothing has change there\nwill always output the same value.\n\n170\n00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:09.700\nIf the value changes I know something in\nthat file, or set of files, has changed.\n\n171\n00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:10.260\nSo, again,\n\n172\n00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:15.600\nit's one of those things that allows me to\nverify that a file has not been modified.\n\n173\n00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.480\nNow this is something you do when you\ndownload stuff from the Internet.\n\n174\n00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.678\nA lot of times you'll see an MD5 value.\n\n175\n00:09:21.678 --> 00:09:24.590\nYou're like, what the heck is that\nbig old long string of numbers?\n\n176\n00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:28.640\nWell that's the hash digest or the message\ndigest and what they want you to do is\n\n177\n00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.080\ndownload the file,\nrun it through a little hashing algorithm,\n\n178\n00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:36.040\ngenerate that value and compare it to\nthe one they have up on their website.\n\n179\n00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.440\nIf those match that means your download\nis complete, nothing got corrupted in\n\n180\n00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:43.030\nthe process and you've got an exact\ncopy of what's on that website.\n\n181\n00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:46.660\nIf they don't match, something went\nwrong and I can go download it again.\n\n182\n00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.070\nMaybe somebody tried to slip\nsome malware in there, right?\n\n183\n00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.720\nSo this is how we provide for\nthat integrity.\n\n184\n00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.610\nSo that's our second leg of the CIA triad.\n\n185\n00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:58.580\n&gt;&gt; Okay so confidentiality, integrity and\nfinally we have availability.\n\n186\n00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:02.830\nAre we talking about having access\nto your content, to your data.\n\n187\n00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:06.470\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, I mean a lot of people think\nwell how does that mean security, right?\n\n188\n00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:10.140\nAvailability doesn't sound\nlike a security thing\n\n189\n00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.660\nto use our technical jargon,\na thing there.\n\n190\n00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:13.850\nBut it is.\n\n191\n00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:15.850\nIt is a big part of security.\n\n192\n00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:19.800\nAnd when we, we can easily\ntake security too far, right.\n\n193\n00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.630\nIf I take that data,\nthat company information,\n\n194\n00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:27.130\nI put it on a server and I encrypt it and\nI unplug the network cable.\n\n195\n00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:27.980\nThat data is pretty safe.\n\n196\n00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.666\nIt's gonna be very difficult for somebody\nto make changes or steal that information.\n\n197\n00:10:31.666 --> 00:10:33.092\nBut also means that Peter,\n\n198\n00:10:33.092 --> 00:10:36.200\nwhen you go to do you job,\nyou can't get to the data either.\n\n199\n00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.431\nAnd that's not gonna do you any good,\n\n200\n00:10:38.431 --> 00:10:42.543\nso making sure that data is available\nis a big part of security as well,\n\n201\n00:10:42.543 --> 00:10:46.950\nbecause if you can't get to\nthe information, it's kind of useless.\n\n202\n00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.390\n&gt;&gt; It sounds like yeah,\nthe most secure way would just be to have\n\n203\n00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:52.330\nno one be able to access the content,\nbut that's not an ideal situation,\n\n204\n00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:56.120\nso kind of finding that middle ground or\nthat happy medium there.\n\n205\n00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.570\nSo what's next to talk about here?\n\n206\n00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:58.670\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so let's finish.\n\n207\n00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:59.640\nA couple more things I want to do.\n\n208\n00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.580\nI want to talk about availability\nbecause it's not just making sure that\n\n209\n00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:03.270\npeople have access.\n\n210\n00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:07.120\nIt's also thinking about\nthings like redundancy.\n\n211\n00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.880\nWhen we look at threats to availability,\nthey can be accidental or\n\n212\n00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.900\nthey can be natural or they can be\nintentional or deliberate I guess.\n\n213\n00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:15.880\nSo accidental,\n\n214\n00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.170\nthings like natural disaster\n&gt;&gt; Fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, equipment\n\n215\n00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:25.630\nfailure, power supply failures, hard drive\nfailures, unplanned network outages.\n\n216\n00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:28.870\nThese would be accidental\ntypes of availability issues.\n\n217\n00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:33.440\nAnd we can do things about it, we can move\nto the area where there are no tornadoes,\n\n218\n00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.590\nor we can have redundant power supplies,\nmultiple power supplies so\n\n219\n00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:40.610\nthat if one fails the other one continues\non and people can still get to my website.\n\n220\n00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:43.450\nBecause if they can't get to my website,\nI can't sell product.\n\n221\n00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:44.970\nI make no money, right?\n\n222\n00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:48.220\nSo we want to making sure\nwe have that availability.\n\n223\n00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:51.310\nDeliberate might be things like attacks,\n\n224\n00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:57.630\nbad guys doing DOS or\ndenial of service attacks, or malware.\n\n225\n00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:01.690\nThings like that would be deliberate\nexploitation of vulnerabilities they\n\n226\n00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:02.930\nfind in our system.\n\n227\n00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:05.800\nEither one would be considered\nan availability issue.\n\n228\n00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.660\nHow we deal with them is gonna\ndiffer a little bit, right?\n\n229\n00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:13.900\nWe have different ways of dealing with say\nprotection from hurricanes than we do with\n\n230\n00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.530\nthe threat of a bad guy stealing our data.\n\n231\n00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:20.400\nBut in the end,\nthey both apply to availability and\n\n232\n00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.160\nwe need to make sure that\nour data's available.\n\n233\n00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.550\nSo, three big things there\nwith that CIA triad.\n\n234\n00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:28.170\nRemember, confidentiality Integrity and\navailability.\n\n235\n00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:31.570\nJust have a good general understanding\nof what those terms mean,\n\n236\n00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.390\nhow we provide them, right?\n\n237\n00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:36.490\nAnd what tools and techniques\nwe can use to provide for those.\n\n238\n00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:39.400\nAll right,\nnext thing we want to talk about Peter,\n\n239\n00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.690\nnow that we've got those basic\nterms there out of the way,\n\n240\n00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:48.520\nlet's talk a little bit about risk\nanalysis and threats, all right?\n\n241\n00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:52.420\nSo we'll start off with a couple terms and\nwe talk about risk.\n\n242\n00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.010\nRisk can be defined in\na couple of different ways.\n\n243\n00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:56.820\nAnd it can be a little confusing.\n\n244\n00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:00.640\nBut for now what we're gonna is we're\ngonna say risk is the probability\n\n245\n00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.620\nthat an event will occur, right?\n\n246\n00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.840\nWe're looking at things\nthat can impact us and\n\n247\n00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.470\nwhat the likelyhood is of that occurring.\n\n248\n00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:14.140\nNow interesting thing with risk\nis risk can be both good and bad.\n\n249\n00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.630\nMost people don't think of it that way.\n\n250\n00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:20.570\nWhen you hear the term risk and\nwe think bad things like risk of a fire or\n\n251\n00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:23.970\nrisk of theft,\nrisk of getting hit by a car.\n\n252\n00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.310\nThese are typically what we think, but\n\n253\n00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:28.530\nthere's also the risk that you\nmight win the lottery right?\n\n254\n00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:30.750\nWhich the outcome of that\nwould be a good thing.\n\n255\n00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:34.820\nBut we typically don't have to worry about\nthose because the outcome is good, right?\n\n256\n00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:38.850\nThere's a risk that my company just,\nI don't know, gets\n\n257\n00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:42.990\nplugged on some website and then all of a\nsudden we triple our business in a month.\n\n258\n00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:46.660\nThat's a risk, but it's a good risk,\nwe typically don't worry about it.\n\n259\n00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:50.120\nBad risk is usually what we're thinking\nof when we talk about risk and risk\n\n260\n00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:54.350\nassessment, things with negative impacts\non our business, or on our information.\n\n261\n00:13:56.330 --> 00:14:01.860\nThreats are really the exploitation,\na threat is\n\n262\n00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:07.510\nsomebody acting on some of those risks or\nexposing some of those vulnerabilities.\n\n263\n00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:11.190\nLike we face the threat of somebody\nbreaking in because we have\n\n264\n00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:12.462\nbad locks on our door.\n\n265\n00:14:12.462 --> 00:14:18.110\nAll right, we've got a vulnerability, weak\nsecure lock on our door, the threat is\n\n266\n00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:23.080\nthat bad guy that finds it and then tries\nto come through that door, all right?\n\n267\n00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.540\nNow, usually when we talk about risk,\nwe talk about threats,\n\n268\n00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.330\nwe start off by defining what a threat is,\nwhat a risk is.\n\n269\n00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.684\nA vulnerability is\na weakness in a system or\n\n270\n00:14:32.684 --> 00:14:37.910\na piece of software that could\npotentially be exposed by a threat.\n\n271\n00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:42.068\nBut then we start tying it all together\nwith something known as risk management\n\n272\n00:14:42.068 --> 00:14:46.163\nand risk management is a whole nother\nfield unto itself, and we spend days and\n\n273\n00:14:46.163 --> 00:14:47.310\nweeks, and we have.\n\n274\n00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:51.070\nWe have great courses in our library\nthat deal with risk management, but\n\n275\n00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:52.910\nlet's talk about just\nthe basics of what it is.\n\n276\n00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:56.160\nWe should have an understanding of\nsome of, again, the terminology.\n\n277\n00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.470\nAnd the basic principles\nof risk management.\n\n278\n00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:03.490\nWe're talking about risk management,\nidentify, assess, and\n\n279\n00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:07.739\nprioritize your threats and risks,\nthat's really the core steps.\n\n280\n00:15:07.739 --> 00:15:11.360\nNow, I get it, that's a very\nsimplified view of risk management.\n\n281\n00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.270\nThere's a lot more to it but for\n\n282\n00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:17.120\nus, for this particular MTA series,\nwe can kind of leave it at that.\n\n283\n00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.890\nIdentify, assess, and\nprioritize threats and risks.\n\n284\n00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:23.520\nSo if we are going to do risk management,\nPeter, one of the first things we have to\n\n285\n00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.197\ndo is we have to think about\nwhat risks do we face, right?\n\n286\n00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:29.650\nHere our offices are in Florida.\n\n287\n00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:31.340\nSo when we think about risks,\n\n288\n00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.600\none of the things that might\ncome up are hurricanes, right.\n\n289\n00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:39.520\nSo what about avalanches, or volcanoes?\n\n290\n00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, considering we're\nabout a foot above sea level,\n\n291\n00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.580\nI'm thinking no on the avalanches and\nprobably no on the volcanoes.\n\n292\n00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.660\nI guess it could happen but\nlike you said, judging\n\n293\n00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:52.105\nthe chances of something happening,\nthat's going to be a really low risk.\n\n294\n00:15:52.105 --> 00:15:53.855\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and so\nthat's what we're trying to do.\n\n295\n00:15:53.855 --> 00:15:55.655\nThere's all kinds of risks out there.\n\n296\n00:15:55.655 --> 00:15:57.526\nWe don't have to worry about all of them.\n\n297\n00:15:57.526 --> 00:15:59.593\nIt's gonna be very specific\nto our environment,\n\n298\n00:15:59.593 --> 00:16:01.425\nespecially when it comes to natural risks.\n\n299\n00:16:01.425 --> 00:16:03.750\nBut those are the kind of\nthings we've gotta do.\n\n300\n00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:08.617\nWe're gonna look at Our environment, and\nsee what kind of risks we might face.\n\n301\n00:16:08.617 --> 00:16:11.414\nWe're gonna look at\nthe software that we run, and\n\n302\n00:16:11.414 --> 00:16:13.420\nthe operating systems that we run.\n\n303\n00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.540\nAnd whether or\nnot we're connected to the Internet, and\n\n304\n00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.370\nwhat levels of access we\nallow from the outside.\n\n305\n00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:23.590\nAll of these things are gonna give us an\nidea of what risks we have to face, right?\n\n306\n00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:27.750\nYou look at everything in your system,\nall your business processes,\n\n307\n00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:33.040\nall of your applications that you run, and\nyou try to figure out what kind of risks\n\n308\n00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.500\nthose expose to your organization and\nto your information.\n\n309\n00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.516\nSo that's the process of\nidentifying the risk, right.\n\n310\n00:16:38.516 --> 00:16:41.245\nWe don't have to worry about\ntornadoes here that much, but\n\n311\n00:16:41.245 --> 00:16:43.330\nwe do have to worry about hurricanes.\n\n312\n00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:47.550\nWe don't run Windows XP, so we don't have\nto worry about those vulnerabilities, but\n\n313\n00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:51.610\nthere are some vulnerabilities in Flash\nthat we run on some of our kiosk systems.\n\n314\n00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:55.510\nSo going through our environment and\ndetermining what risks we need to face,\n\n315\n00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:00.210\nthen we want to assess those risks.\n\n316\n00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:04.920\nAnd there's two big things we look at when\nwe're assessing risk, if I can say that,\n\n317\n00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.770\nlikelihood and impact.\n\n318\n00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:09.790\nOne, what is the likelihood\nof it occurring, all right?\n\n319\n00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:13.470\nAnd then two, if it does occur,\nwhat is the impact?\n\n320\n00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:17.390\nBecause these are two things that are\nreally gonna help me deal with the risk.\n\n321\n00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:18.920\nDetermine how much time and\n\n322\n00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:24.900\neffort I want to spend on trying to\nremove that risk if at all, right?\n\n323\n00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:28.562\nSo, if we look at things, like the one\nexample that just about every risk\n\n324\n00:17:28.562 --> 00:17:31.220\nmanagement course I think uses is meteors,\nright?\n\n325\n00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:35.370\nYeah, there's a risk for us getting\nhit by a meteor here in Florida.\n\n326\n00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:37.130\nSo, and the impact,\n\n327\n00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:42.140\nif we get hit by a meteor, it could\nbe pretty big, pretty devastating.\n\n328\n00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:45.500\nBut the likelihood is extremely low,\nright.\n\n329\n00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:50.230\nWe can go out and\nbuy meteorite insurance, but why, right?\n\n330\n00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:53.337\n&gt;&gt; You probably won't be there to\ncash it in if it does come up.\n\n331\n00:17:53.337 --> 00:17:55.240\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n332\n00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:59.030\nSo again, when you're doing your risk\nassessments and risk management,\n\n333\n00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:04.480\nyou're looking at two factors, the\nlikelihood and the impact on your systems.\n\n334\n00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.760\nWhat is the likelihood of it occurring?\n\n335\n00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.100\nAnd then if it does occur,\nhow bad is it gonna be?\n\n336\n00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.900\n&gt;&gt; And you talked about the accidental\na lot, the natural disasters and\n\n337\n00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:13.520\nthings like that.\n\n338\n00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:17.020\nBut there's also a lot of deliberate\nones that could come up and\n\n339\n00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.350\nbe case by case as well.\n\n340\n00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:21.169\nIf your data center is in\nthe middle of the desert or\n\n341\n00:18:21.169 --> 00:18:25.466\nif it's in the middle of an urban area,\nI worked in a building before where we\n\n342\n00:18:25.466 --> 00:18:30.480\nrealized the cable running down the side\nof the building was our T1 line coming in.\n\n343\n00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.450\nAnd, someone could just walk by and\ncut it if they wanted to, and\n\n344\n00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:35.550\nthat's a big risk, so something we\nhad to go ahead and take care of.\n\n345\n00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:36.400\n&gt;&gt; That was a huge risk.\n\n346\n00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:40.040\nAnd so you just decided that okay,\nthe likelihood of it occurring is probably\n\n347\n00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:43.849\npretty good because it's exposed,\nit's outside, nobody's monitoring it.\n\n348\n00:18:43.849 --> 00:18:47.498\nAnybody could walk up to it day or\nnight and the impact, that's our T1 line,\n\n349\n00:18:47.498 --> 00:18:50.098\nthat's our Internet access for\nthe entire business.\n\n350\n00:18:50.098 --> 00:18:54.240\nSo if it goes down, everything\nstops until we can get that fixed.\n\n351\n00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.880\nSo you decided to do something about it,\nbecause the likelihood was great and\n\n352\n00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:58.990\nthe impact was great.\n\n353\n00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:00.000\nAnd that's exactly what we do,\n\n354\n00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.560\nwe typically make what's\ncalled a risk matrix.\n\n355\n00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:06.863\nAnd we have the likelihood, you might\ndo it on a scale of one to five or\n\n356\n00:19:06.863 --> 00:19:11.632\none to ten for the likelihood, and\nthen our impact on a scale of one to five.\n\n357\n00:19:11.632 --> 00:19:13.540\nAnd then we can just multiply those.\n\n358\n00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:18.775\nSo if your risk has a likelihood of 3 and\nit has an impact of 4,\n\n359\n00:19:18.775 --> 00:19:24.034\n3 times 4 is 12,\nthat gives that risk a risk score of 12.\n\n360\n00:19:24.034 --> 00:19:28.663\nAnd this allows us to do the final step,\nwhich is the prioritization,\n\n361\n00:19:28.663 --> 00:19:30.790\nbecause where do I wanna focus?\n\n362\n00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:32.220\nI can't fix everything at once.\n\n363\n00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:37.240\nWe have a limited amount of resources,\ntime, man hours, money.\n\n364\n00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.090\nSo I can't just go out and\nfix everything all at once.\n\n365\n00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:43.020\nBut what I can do is\nprioritize those risks.\n\n366\n00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.100\nThose risks that had\na likelihood of one and\n\n367\n00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:49.690\nan impact of two, their risk score\nis only two times one is two.\n\n368\n00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:50.656\nThat's a lot lower than 12.\n\n369\n00:19:50.656 --> 00:19:53.870\nSo I'm gonna start with that guy\nthat has the risk score of 12.\n\n370\n00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:55.770\nLet's focus on that one first.\n\n371\n00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:57.470\nEventually we'll get\ndown to those lower ones,\n\n372\n00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:00.490\nwe're not gonna forget about them,\nbut we want to prioritize.\n\n373\n00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:03.490\nWe want to make sure we're\ngetting the highest impact,\n\n374\n00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:08.810\nhighest likelihood first and then working\nour way down through there, all right.\n\n375\n00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:12.780\nNow once we've done identify,\nassess and prioritize and\n\n376\n00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:16.630\ngenerate our risk matrix, then we've\ngotta decide what are we gonna do.\n\n377\n00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:19.210\nHow are we gonna deal with these risks?\n\n378\n00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:24.635\nAnd there's four primary responses that we\ncan do when we talk about risk management,\n\n379\n00:20:24.635 --> 00:20:28.820\navoidance, acceptance,\nmitigation and transfer, all right.\n\n380\n00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:33.000\nAnd we need to be familiar with what\neach one of these means in general.\n\n381\n00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.730\nAvoidance is a pretty straightforward one.\n\n382\n00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:40.850\nNow the risk is that we're running\nXP on an Internet-exposed computer.\n\n383\n00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:44.400\nThat's a big risk,\nthe likelihood of it getting hit is high.\n\n384\n00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.880\nI'd say at least a five on\na scale of one to five.\n\n385\n00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.365\nAnd the impact could also be huge,\nbecause it's connected to our network.\n\n386\n00:20:50.365 --> 00:20:52.712\nThey take over that machine and\nnow they can bounce around and\n\n387\n00:20:52.712 --> 00:20:54.103\nhit other machines on our network.\n\n388\n00:20:54.103 --> 00:20:56.644\nSo I'd say that's probably a 5\non the impact, so it's got a 25,\n\n389\n00:20:56.644 --> 00:20:58.490\nwe're gonna do something about it.\n\n390\n00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:01.840\nWhat do we do,\nget rid of Windows XP, right?\n\n391\n00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:05.310\nDon't use that software anymore,\navoid the risk all together.\n\n392\n00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:08.516\nThat's the idea behind avoidance.\n\n393\n00:21:08.516 --> 00:21:13.250\nHaving a public facing web server,\nthere's risk associated with that.\n\n394\n00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:16.680\nIf we're not a store where people\nneed to be able to come and shop,\n\n395\n00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:20.430\nif we're just putting up the website\nbecause everybody else has a website,\n\n396\n00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:24.980\nmaybe we avoid that risk all together and\ndon't run a website.\n\n397\n00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:26.850\nSo that would be avoidance.\n\n398\n00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:28.390\nThen you've got acceptance.\n\n399\n00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:32.230\nAcceptance means I'm\ngoing to live with it.\n\n400\n00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:34.060\nI'm okay with that, right?\n\n401\n00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:38.880\nMaybe the likelihood is not all that high,\nthe impact is fairly low, but\n\n402\n00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:42.150\nin order to get rid of the risk,\nit's gonna be expensive.\n\n403\n00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:46.535\nHere's an example,\nI just got back from a resort vacation,\n\n404\n00:21:46.535 --> 00:21:48.355\nand I was in one of their photo shops.\n\n405\n00:21:48.355 --> 00:21:50.987\nThey got the photographers that\nrun around, take your pictures and\n\n406\n00:21:50.987 --> 00:21:53.505\nthen charge you money\nto get your pictures.\n\n407\n00:21:53.505 --> 00:21:56.367\nAnd the screen that they were using,\nthe computer they're using to show you\n\n408\n00:21:56.367 --> 00:21:58.837\nthe pictures to see if you want to\nbuy them was running Windows XP.\n\n409\n00:21:58.837 --> 00:22:02.790\nAnd at the time of the filming,\nthis is 2017,\n\n410\n00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:07.000\nWindows XP is what 17,\n15 years old, a lot.\n\n411\n00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.080\nIt's no longer supported and\nthey're not making patches for it anymore.\n\n412\n00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:16.560\nExcept for that Wanna Cry,\nso it's a huge, huge risk.\n\n413\n00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:21.148\nBut, and I talked to them about it,\nthe software they were using was never\n\n414\n00:22:21.148 --> 00:22:23.888\nupdated to run on\nanything past Windows XP.\n\n415\n00:22:23.888 --> 00:22:26.581\nThey didn't want to invest\nin more software, so\n\n416\n00:22:26.581 --> 00:22:30.400\nthey made sure that that computer\nwas not connected to the Internet.\n\n417\n00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.110\nIt got a big sticker on it,\nit says no browsing, right?\n\n418\n00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:35.290\nSo what they did was\nthey accepted the risk.\n\n419\n00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:38.280\nThey actually did a little mitigation\nby disconnecting it from the network.\n\n420\n00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:42.000\nBut they're basically accepting it,\nsaying I know there's a risk, but\n\n421\n00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:42.770\nwe're okay with that.\n\n422\n00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:45.830\nBecause the cost that it would\ntake to fix doesn't outweigh\n\n423\n00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:48.360\nthe cost of the risk\nthat we're facing there.\n\n424\n00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.522\n&gt;&gt; And maybe in a situation like that,\nif that system were to go down,\n\n425\n00:22:51.522 --> 00:22:53.166\nmaybe they have backups in place.\n\n426\n00:22:53.166 --> 00:22:56.957\nSo it's not the kind of thing that's going\nto have a big impact on them as well,\n\n427\n00:22:56.957 --> 00:22:58.270\nif that risk does occur.\n\n428\n00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:01.090\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right, and maybe it's not\nconnected like you said to other systems.\n\n429\n00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:04.280\nSo if they did compromise it,\nthey wouldn't be able to get too far.\n\n430\n00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:08.127\nThen you've got mitigation, and mitigation\nmeans trying to deal with the risk, right,\n\n431\n00:23:08.127 --> 00:23:09.302\ndoing something about it.\n\n432\n00:23:09.302 --> 00:23:12.660\nThere's a risk in the software we're\nrunning, I'm gonna go talk to the vendor,\n\n433\n00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:13.840\nsee if they've got a patch.\n\n434\n00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.300\nI wanna apply those,\nI'm gonna update firmware.\n\n435\n00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.430\nI'm gonna put better locks on the doors.\n\n436\n00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:22.700\nI'm gonna train my employees\nin social engineering.\n\n437\n00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.420\nAll of this is mitigation techniques.\n\n438\n00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.618\nWe see the risk, we don't like it.\n\n439\n00:23:26.618 --> 00:23:29.060\nWe want to do something about it, so\n\n440\n00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:33.940\nwe're going to apply some type\nof control to mitigate or\n\n441\n00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:39.570\nreduce the impact and or\nthe likelihood of that risk.\n\n442\n00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:41.154\nAnd then the last one is transfer.\n\n443\n00:23:41.154 --> 00:23:44.840\nAnd when we talk about transfer,\nthis is typically insurance, right?\n\n444\n00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:48.500\nI have a risk, I'm just gonna\ntransfer that risk to somebody else.\n\n445\n00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.938\nI'm gonna pay company XYZ so\nmuch money a month, and\n\n446\n00:23:51.938 --> 00:23:56.786\nif that risk ever comes to fruition,\nwhatever they're insuring me for,\n\n447\n00:23:56.786 --> 00:23:59.534\nthey have to deal with the consequences.\n\n448\n00:23:59.534 --> 00:24:01.937\nIt's like car insurance, right,\nyou all have car insurance.\n\n449\n00:24:01.937 --> 00:24:07.950\nSo you pay a company so much money\na month to transfer the risk to them.\n\n450\n00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:10.580\nNow, when you wreck your car,\nthey have to fix it.\n\n451\n00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:14.600\nThey have to come out-of-pocket and\npay that money to get that car fixed.\n\n452\n00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.070\nSo you've transferred\nthe risk to somebody else.\n\n453\n00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:20.210\nYou see this a lot of times\nwhen we go to cloud, right?\n\n454\n00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:23.250\nWe're transferring some of that risk to\nthe cloud providers because now they're\n\n455\n00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:26.900\nresponsible for keeping those systems\nup to date and keeping them patched.\n\n456\n00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:32.140\nWe look at insurance on\nhigh profile people, right?\n\n457\n00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:35.810\nWhat is that,\nthe key personnel type insurance.\n\n458\n00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:40.280\nWhere if that person's ever gone, we've\ngot issues with the company because they\n\n459\n00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.640\nare the spokesperson,\nthe face of the company.\n\n460\n00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.790\nAnd if they leave we lose credibility.\n\n461\n00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:46.800\nSo maybe we have insurance\nagainst things like that.\n\n462\n00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.570\nBut we've basically transferred\nthe risk to somebody else.\n\n463\n00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.950\nNow one last concept,\nI know we're getting short on time,\n\n464\n00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:57.460\nthat I want to throw in here when we talk\nabout risk, and that's residual risk.\n\n465\n00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:02.460\nResidual risk is the risk\nthat's left after\n\n466\n00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.490\nyou've taken one of these risk responses.\n\n467\n00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:06.990\nWhether it's avoidance,\nacceptance, mitigation, transfer,\n\n468\n00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:10.210\nyou're going to have some risk left over.\n\n469\n00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:12.820\nI'll use the insurance example again.\n\n470\n00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:15.880\nNow I pay so\nmuch a month to my insurance company and\n\n471\n00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.260\nnow I've transferred that risk to them.\n\n472\n00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:21.360\nWhen I get in an accident they're\ngonna pay for it except for\n\n473\n00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.550\nmy deductible, right?\n\n474\n00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:25.280\nSo I still have a little\nbit of residual risk on me.\n\n475\n00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.920\nI have to pay that deductible\nbefore they actually take over and\n\n476\n00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:28.800\nmake the rest of the payment.\n\n477\n00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.956\nSo that's an example of residual risk.\n\n478\n00:25:30.956 --> 00:25:33.405\nOr maybe,\nwhat would be another good example?\n\n479\n00:25:33.405 --> 00:25:35.457\nYou-\n&gt;&gt; Also in the insurance examples,\n\n480\n00:25:35.457 --> 00:25:38.018\na lot of times they'll\nhave a maximum payout.\n\n481\n00:25:38.018 --> 00:25:41.130\nSo they'll cover your\naccident up to $100,000, or\n\n482\n00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:43.282\nthe bodily injury up to a certain amount.\n\n483\n00:25:43.282 --> 00:25:46.130\nSo, beyond that,\nif it's something that's gonna keep going,\n\n484\n00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:47.445\nthat's something you're responsible for.\n\n485\n00:25:47.445 --> 00:25:50.510\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and we could use that\nXP one for an example as well.\n\n486\n00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:53.460\nThey had some residual risk there.\n\n487\n00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.690\nThey still ran XP.\n\n488\n00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:55.970\nThey've done what they could.\n\n489\n00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:59.640\nThey disconnected from the internet or\nthey'd maybe leave it connected but\n\n490\n00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.980\nhave a sticker on it\nthat says no browsing.\n\n491\n00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:04.960\nOkay, but there's still the risk\nthat somebody says, yeah,\n\n492\n00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.510\nI can't read English and\nI'm gonna go ahead and browse anyway.\n\n493\n00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:11.930\nOr somebody, a guest gets physical access\nto that machine and tries to do something.\n\n494\n00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:13.980\nSo they didn't eliminate\nthe risk all together.\n\n495\n00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.970\nThat's that residual\nrisk that's left over.\n\n496\n00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:19.549\nAll right, so I know we've got\na lot more topics here to cover.\n\n497\n00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:21.984\nOr the next one, some quick ones,\nor should we go ahead and\n\n498\n00:26:21.984 --> 00:26:22.988\nsave that for part two?\n\n499\n00:26:22.988 --> 00:26:24.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, rather than rush through it,\nlet's save it.\n\n500\n00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:25.620\nLet's do a part two.\n\n501\n00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:28.304\nIt might not be a full length, but\nI don't wanna rush through any of this.\n\n502\n00:26:28.304 --> 00:26:29.160\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds good, Mike.\n\n503\n00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:32.480\nWell we've got some more core security\nprinciples to talk about, but\n\n504\n00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.580\nwe're gonna do that in part two.\n\n505\n00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:35.132\nSo we're gonna go ahead and sign off now.\n\n506\n00:26:35.132 --> 00:26:37.850\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nPeter VanRysdam.\n\n507\n00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:38.770\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n508\n00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:39.640\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n509\n00:26:39.640 -->

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:05.923 --> 00:00:08.356\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.356 --> 00:00:12.615\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.615 --> 00:00:14.536\n&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome to ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:14.536 --> 00:00:16.578\nI'm your host Peter VanRysdam, and today,\n\n8\n00:00:16.578 --> 00:00:19.880\nwe're continuing with our\nMTA Security Fundamentals course.\n\n9\n00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.000\nAnd in this episode, we're continuing\nto look at Core Security principles and\n\n10\n00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.380\nwe have Mr.\nMike Rodrick here to help us with that.\n\n11\n00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.230\nMike, how you doing?\n\n12\n00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.860\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n13\n00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.750\nThanks for having me back.\n\n14\n00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.360\nExcited to be here as always, and yet\n\n15\n00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.540\nwe left off talking about those\ncore security principles.\n\n16\n00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.925\nIf you missed part one,\nmake sure you go back and check it out.\n\n17\n00:00:36.925 --> 00:00:40.350\nTalked to you about the CIA triad,\nwe talked a little bit about\n\n18\n00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.450\nrisk management and some terms that\nwe need to be familiar with there.\n\n19\n00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.380\nNext on our list and when it comes\nto our core security principles,\n\n20\n00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.450\nis going to be something known as\nthe principle of least privilege.\n\n21\n00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.560\nAnd this is something that I\nthink we hear about it a lot and\n\n22\n00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.090\nnow it seems to be pretty commonplace,\nbut not always the case.\n\n23\n00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.940\nAnd we need to make sure we understand,\nthough,\n\n24\n00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.720\nwhat they mean by principle\nof least privilege.\n\n25\n00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.368\nAnd it's just like the name implies,\nright?\n\n26\n00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:13.280\nBasically only gonna give you or\nthe system or whatever it\n\n27\n00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.920\nis I'm trying to control what they\nneed to do their job and nothing more.\n\n28\n00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.660\nIn other words, I want to make sure\nthat you have all the rights and\n\n29\n00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.440\npermissions that you need to do your job.\n\n30\n00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.810\nWhether that's logging on to a particular\ncomputer, able to access certain files,\n\n31\n00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.780\ndata, able to get into the server closet,\nif that's part of your job.\n\n32\n00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.310\nBut then that's it, nothing more, right?\n\n33\n00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.800\nIt used to be way back in the day to\nkeep things really easy to administer,\n\n34\n00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.130\nwe would make everybody\nadministrators on the network.\n\n35\n00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.487\nBecause that way, you didn't\nhave to come to me and say, hey,\n\n36\n00:01:46.487 --> 00:01:47.746\nI can't install this software.\n\n37\n00:01:47.746 --> 00:01:49.530\nIt says I need to be an administrator.\n\n38\n00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.640\nAnd IT people were taking\nthe lazy approach and saying,\n\n39\n00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.660\nyou know what,\nI'll just make you an administrator.\n\n40\n00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.660\nNow you can do whatever you want.\n\n41\n00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.365\nYou don't have to come bug me anymore.\n\n42\n00:01:57.365 --> 00:01:59.000\nBut we've learned, right?\n\n43\n00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.770\nWe went through the pain of that.\n\n44\n00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.490\nWe learned how bad that can be and\n\n45\n00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.390\nnow most organizations do follow\nthe principle of least privilege.\n\n46\n00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.790\nBut again, like I said,\nit's still an important concept and\n\n47\n00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.640\nit can be a tricky one to implement.\n\n48\n00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.388\nIt seems easy.\n\n49\n00:02:13.388 --> 00:02:16.460\nIt sounds like it's something, well hey,\njust give them what they need and\n\n50\n00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.090\nnothing more.\n\n51\n00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.710\nAnd if you got an office of five people,\n\n52\n00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.480\nit's relatively easy to do one facility,\nfive employees, not that big of deal.\n\n53\n00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.640\nBut when you're talking about\nthousands of employees, and six or\n\n54\n00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.520\nseven different facilities, some of those\nemployees need access to all facilities,\n\n55\n00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.350\nsome of them only certain facilities.\n\n56\n00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.140\nEverybody needs access\nto this document but\n\n57\n00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.780\nonly certain people need\naccess to these documents.\n\n58\n00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.860\nIt becomes a logistical nightmare\nto try to manage all of this.\n\n59\n00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.870\nNow we have software and\ntechniques that we can use to take care of\n\n60\n00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.890\nthis like Active Directory in Windows and\nusing security groups and permissions.\n\n61\n00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.240\nAnd we're not getting into\nhow to do all this right now.\n\n62\n00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.770\nI just want to make sure we\nunderstand that concept of\n\n63\n00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.460\nprinciple of least privilege.\n\n64\n00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.870\nWe want to make sure that when we're\nsigning permissions, and when we're giving\n\n65\n00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.050\naccess, whether that's to an employee,\nor to a computer system, right?\n\n66\n00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.720\nWe're controlling.\n\n67\n00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.590\nWe're not just taking the easy way out and\nsaying, yeah, go ahead,\n\n68\n00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.403\nhave free reign of the network.\n\n69\n00:03:12.403 --> 00:03:13.902\nFigure out what it is.\n\n70\n00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:17.120\nMake sure that's all you're giving it,\nand then nothing more.\n\n71\n00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.110\nWhy is that important?\n\n72\n00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.421\nWell, couple of things.\n\n73\n00:03:20.421 --> 00:03:24.715\nWell, one, it keeps employees\nsafe from themselves, right?\n\n74\n00:03:24.715 --> 00:03:27.540\nIt keeps our information\nsafe from employees.\n\n75\n00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.300\nBecause if they shouldn't have\naccess to that information but\n\n76\n00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.740\nthey have it anyway,\nthey're gonna end up poking around.\n\n77\n00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.900\nGoing to places that they shouldn't be,\nlooking at stuff they shouldn't see,\n\n78\n00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.820\npossibly making accidental or\ndeliberate changes, right?\n\n79\n00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.100\nIf we give them, it's like mom\nalways told me when I was young,\n\n80\n00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.390\nI give you an inch and you take a mile.\n\n81\n00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.650\nWell, that's what happens with employees\nis you give them a little bit and\n\n82\n00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.010\nthey're gonna push the boundaries.\n\n83\n00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.940\nAnd they're gonna check and\nsee what else they can get into.\n\n84\n00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.030\nA folder called payroll,\nI wonder what's in here, double click.\n\n85\n00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.250\nIt let me in, I wonder what's in here,\ndouble click, right?\n\n86\n00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.630\nJust curiosity gets the best of us and\nthat's when bad things can happen.\n\n87\n00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.022\nAnd two is we think about malware and\nthe way this works.\n\n88\n00:04:09.022 --> 00:04:12.661\nAnd if I'm an administrator on\nthe system and I download or\n\n89\n00:04:12.661 --> 00:04:15.927\nclick on a link that has\nmalware associated with it,\n\n90\n00:04:15.927 --> 00:04:20.700\nthat malware is potentially now running\nas me, right, as my user account.\n\n91\n00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.800\nWhatever I have rights to,\nthat malware now has rights to.\n\n92\n00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.263\nAnd if you didn't control my access at\nall and you just made me an admin across\n\n93\n00:04:28.263 --> 00:04:32.115\nthe system, then now that malware\nis an admin across the system.\n\n94\n00:04:32.115 --> 00:04:34.946\nAnd I talk about this from a user\nperspective, but it's the same thing for\n\n95\n00:04:34.946 --> 00:04:36.470\ncomputers and software.\n\n96\n00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.900\nSoftware needs permissions.\n\n97\n00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.900\nIf I have a software application\nthat has to reach out and\n\n98\n00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.540\ntalk to a different server to pull back\ndata to present in a dashboard, well,\n\n99\n00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.070\nthat system now needs access to\nthat server and that information.\n\n100\n00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.650\nBut I can limit to just that information,\nrather than giving that system or\n\n101\n00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.020\nthat software application\nfree run of the network,\n\n102\n00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.100\nI can say you need access to this\nparticular table and this particular\n\n103\n00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.790\ndatabase to pull that information back and\nthat's it and nothing more.\n\n104\n00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.630\nSo we apply that same principle of least\nprivilege not just to employees but\n\n105\n00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.120\nto systems and to applications as well.\n\n106\n00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.474\nAnd that's gonna help us\nmaintain our networks and\n\n107\n00:05:14.474 --> 00:05:18.224\nkeep them safe from accidental and\nmalicious behavior.\n\n108\n00:05:18.224 --> 00:05:18.873\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike,\n\n109\n00:05:18.873 --> 00:05:21.280\nI'm lucky enough to have a list of\nall the terms we're covering here.\n\n110\n00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.850\nSo I see next up is social engineering.\n\n111\n00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.260\nThat's a pretty big topic,\nbut, for this exam,\n\n112\n00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.370\nwe just need to kind of\nunderstand what it is, right?\n\n113\n00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very basic at this point.\n\n114\n00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.330\nWe've got other courses in our library if\nyou wanna go into a little more in-depth.\n\n115\n00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.850\nIt's a fascinating field.\n\n116\n00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.950\nBut social engineering Is\na technique that the bad guys use\n\n117\n00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.270\nand what they're really doing is they're\ntaking advantage of human nature.\n\n118\n00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.240\nI guess it's a good way to describe it,\nright?\n\n119\n00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.855\nWe're going to try to convince,\nas a social engineer,\n\n120\n00:05:49.855 --> 00:05:52.625\nwhat you're trying to do\nreally is convince somebody to\n\n121\n00:05:52.625 --> 00:05:57.165\ngive you information that you shouldn't\nhave access to or give you access, right?\n\n122\n00:05:57.165 --> 00:05:59.865\nGive you credentials, basically trying to\n\n123\n00:05:59.865 --> 00:06:03.745\nget you to give up information to\nsomebody that should not have it.\n\n124\n00:06:03.745 --> 00:06:06.465\nAnd there's several different\ntechniques that they will\n\n125\n00:06:06.465 --> 00:06:08.335\nuse to do social engineering.\n\n126\n00:06:08.335 --> 00:06:11.115\nBut it's all about misrepresentation.\n\n127\n00:06:11.115 --> 00:06:14.930\nYou'll hear things like\nthe whole phone call to the help\n\n128\n00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.670\ndesk pretending to be a new employee and\nhaving trouble with a password and\n\n129\n00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.380\ntrying to get a password reset.\n\n130\n00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.280\nOr the help desk calling an employee,\n\n131\n00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.640\nthe help desk calling an employee saying\nhey, we upgraded the system last night.\n\n132\n00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.020\nWe want to make sure\nyou have access to it.\n\n133\n00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.600\nLet's reset your password or\ngive me your old password so\n\n134\n00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.790\nI can make sure you're in the system.\n\n135\n00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.340\nOr this is Bob down in IT and\n\n136\n00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:41.330\nI need you to log into an application and\ntake a screenshot, those kinds of things.\n\n137\n00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:46.242\nSocial engineering is a lot of\ntimes it is done over the phone.\n\n138\n00:06:46.242 --> 00:06:50.010\nAnd the reason it's done over the phone\nis because it's harder to verify\n\n139\n00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.320\nidentity, right?\n\n140\n00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.805\nIf I call you up and I use the right names\nand you've never talked to me before,\n\n141\n00:06:54.805 --> 00:06:58.399\nin a small organization it might be more\ndifficult but in a large organization,\n\n142\n00:06:58.399 --> 00:07:01.375\nhow many times have you talked to\nthe people down on the help desk?\n\n143\n00:07:01.375 --> 00:07:03.090\nDo you know every one of them by voice?\n\n144\n00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.430\nOr could I convince you\nusing the right names and\n\n145\n00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.060\nthe right information that I'm\npart of your help desk system?\n\n146\n00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:10.800\nWould you be able to tell?\n\n147\n00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.760\nSo a lot of times it is\ndone over the phone.\n\n148\n00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:18.290\nIt can also be done through email though\nwhen we look at things like phishing.\n\n149\n00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.053\nThese are examples of social engineering.\n\n150\n00:07:21.053 --> 00:07:22.410\nI want you to click on that link.\n\n151\n00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:27.150\nI want you to update your password\nat PayPal, or log into your bank\n\n152\n00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:31.610\naccount using this link that takes you to\na site that looks just like your bank.\n\n153\n00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.848\nNow those are examples of phishing\nwhich falls under social engineering.\n\n154\n00:07:34.848 --> 00:07:37.870\nBut there's non-technical methods as well.\n\n155\n00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:43.500\nWe talk about things like tailgating,\nall right.\n\n156\n00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.460\nIf your front door has card access,\ncard-controlled access,\n\n157\n00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:51.530\nI can maybe hang out by the door, wait for\na group of you to come back from lunch,\n\n158\n00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.860\nand just try to slip into your group and\nslip in.\n\n159\n00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.896\nAnd nobody noticing cuz\nthere's a group of you.\n\n160\n00:07:55.896 --> 00:07:58.987\nOne person swipes their card and\nholds the door for everybody else and\n\n161\n00:07:58.987 --> 00:08:00.220\nmaybe I can just slip on in.\n\n162\n00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.723\nOr I put on an old work suit, jumpsuit,\nand yeah, I'm here to fix the phone.\n\n163\n00:08:03.723 --> 00:08:05.310\nYou're probably gonna open the door for\nme.\n\n164\n00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:06.557\nAll right.\n&gt;&gt; You're probably gonna open\n\n165\n00:08:06.557 --> 00:08:09.277\nthe phone closet, then too, which is\nprobably where the server is as well, and\n\n166\n00:08:09.277 --> 00:08:10.389\nprobably where all the data is.\n\n167\n00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:13.931\nSo you're not planning on that\nphysical level of security a lot, but\n\n168\n00:08:13.931 --> 00:08:15.224\nit's pretty easy to do.\n\n169\n00:08:15.224 --> 00:08:19.279\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and you'd be surprised\nwhat a little bit of confidence and\n\n170\n00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:21.206\na uniform or a hat with a logo on it,\n\n171\n00:08:21.206 --> 00:08:24.545\nall of which can be obtained at\nflea markets or made myself.\n\n172\n00:08:24.545 --> 00:08:28.392\nWe talked about business cards,\nbusiness cards can be printed up for\n\n173\n00:08:28.392 --> 00:08:30.634\na dime a dozen anywhere you want.\n\n174\n00:08:30.634 --> 00:08:34.340\nI always liked the old, remember, I don't\nknow if they still do this, the bowls they\n\n175\n00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.210\nwould have in some of these restaurants\nwhere you put your business card in and\n\n176\n00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.340\nevery week they draw for\nlike a free lunch?\n\n177\n00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.170\nWell, not difficult for\nme to drop my card in there,\n\n178\n00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:44.580\ngrab three or four out,\nlegitimate business cards and\n\n179\n00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:48.290\nI can try to use those in my\nsocial engineering endeavors.\n\n180\n00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:49.930\nSo different attack methods,\n\n181\n00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:54.520\npersonal, email, phone calls, again\nall taking advantage of human nature.\n\n182\n00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.602\nThe problem is, as humans,\nwe like to be accepted.\n\n183\n00:08:57.602 --> 00:09:02.325\nWe wanna be liked, we wanna seem helpful,\nespecially to those in authority, or\n\n184\n00:09:02.325 --> 00:09:06.420\nthat we think are in authority or\nhave some sort of power.\n\n185\n00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:11.013\nSo we're typically very willing\nto try to go that extra step and\n\n186\n00:09:11.013 --> 00:09:14.490\nprovide information, even if we shouldn't.\n\n187\n00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.921\nSo, and this is not really a show\nabout preventing any of this, but\n\n188\n00:09:17.921 --> 00:09:20.930\nI do wanna just throw in\na couple of things in there.\n\n189\n00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:22.300\nNever be afraid to ask.\n\n190\n00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:26.060\nNever be afraid to call down to your help\ndesk and ask about something you're seeing\n\n191\n00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:30.460\non your screen or if somebody calls\nyou up and claims that they're so and\n\n192\n00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.344\nso from the HR department and\nthey need personal information.\n\n193\n00:09:34.344 --> 00:09:36.830\nSay hey, hold on,\nI'll call you right back.\n\n194\n00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.520\nPut down the phone, call the actual\nHR number, and ask for that person.\n\n195\n00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.270\nThey should be there.\n\n196\n00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:42.080\nThey should answer, right?\n\n197\n00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.590\nThat's validation of that identity.\n\n198\n00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:46.620\nIf they're trying to make this\ncall from the outside and\n\n199\n00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.280\nspoof you, you're not gonna be\nable to call them back, right?\n\n200\n00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:54.379\nSo just simple things like that\ncan prevent social engineering.\n\n201\n00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.810\nDumpster diving is another big one.\n\n202\n00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:59.030\nWe talk about social engineering.\n\n203\n00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:01.200\nPeople throw away things\nthat they shouldn't.\n\n204\n00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.375\nThose desk pads,\nthe calendars everybody writes all over.\n\n205\n00:10:05.375 --> 00:10:08.158\nAt the end of the year,\nthey just throw them in the garbage,\n\n206\n00:10:08.158 --> 00:10:11.720\nnot a thought in the world about all\nthe account numbers and phone numbers and\n\n207\n00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:16.010\nnames and addresses that were written\non that blotter pad or what have you.\n\n208\n00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.619\nSo people go through the trash and\nthey find that information.\n\n209\n00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:22.528\nAll right, so\nthat's social engineering again.\n\n210\n00:10:22.528 --> 00:10:27.928\nJust the main concept, it's a method\nwe use to gain access to systems or\n\n211\n00:10:27.928 --> 00:10:31.540\ndata through some type\nof misrepresentation.\n\n212\n00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:36.543\nNext on our list is our attack\nsurface analysis, right?\n\n213\n00:10:36.543 --> 00:10:39.974\nNow, when we try to secure\nour networks and our systems,\n\n214\n00:10:39.974 --> 00:10:42.619\none of the things that\nwe're gonna look at,\n\n215\n00:10:42.619 --> 00:10:47.980\nthis goes back to doing our risk analysis\nis, what are our attack surfaces?\n\n216\n00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.700\nAnd your attack surface is\nwhere we're exposed, right?\n\n217\n00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:55.620\nWhat are the avenues that the bad guys\nhave to try to take advantage of or\n\n218\n00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:00.630\nto get into my system or\nto get into that data, all right?\n\n219\n00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:03.720\nIf I have a server sitting\nhere on this table and\n\n220\n00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.800\nmaybe it's powered up, but that's it.\n\n221\n00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.900\nWell, it has a very\nlimited attack surface.\n\n222\n00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.720\nI go and\nI plug that computer into the network, and\n\n223\n00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.500\nI've just increased its attack surface.\n\n224\n00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:18.460\nNow anybody else that has access to the\nnetwork could potentially see that server\n\n225\n00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.690\nand maybe try to do something bad to it.\n\n226\n00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:25.234\nIf I run a website on that server, well,\nnow I've increased my attack surface again\n\n227\n00:11:25.234 --> 00:11:29.394\nbecause I've opened up ports in the\nfirewall and I'm running an application\n\n228\n00:11:29.394 --> 00:11:33.498\nthat is designed to listen for\nrequests and give back information, right?\n\n229\n00:11:33.498 --> 00:11:36.230\nSo I've increased my attack service.\n\n230\n00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:37.670\nThe more applications I run,\n\n231\n00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:42.510\nthe more holes I make in the firewall,\nI'm increasing that attack surface.\n\n232\n00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:46.540\nSo when we look at risk, and we do\nwhat we call attack surface analysis,\n\n233\n00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:50.046\nwe're trying to see,\nwhere are our exposed points, right?\n\n234\n00:11:50.046 --> 00:11:52.272\nWhat do we have that's\nmaking us vulnerable or\n\n235\n00:11:52.272 --> 00:11:54.780\ncould potentially be making us vulnerable?\n\n236\n00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:58.820\nAnd what can I do to reduce\nthat attack surface, right?\n\n237\n00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:04.940\nWhen you look at your house for example,\nwe don't put glass doors on the front.\n\n238\n00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.960\nWe put steel doors on our front door\n\n239\n00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.294\nbecause we want to try to reduce\nthat attack surface, right?\n\n240\n00:12:11.294 --> 00:12:14.250\nMaybe we limit the number of windows or\nthe ones in the bathrooms and\n\n241\n00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:17.540\nthe kitchen are a little bit smaller,\nharder to crawl through, right?\n\n242\n00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.630\nWe can consider that\nreducing our attack surface.\n\n243\n00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:23.715\nTrying to come up with\na non-computer analogy for that.\n\n244\n00:12:23.715 --> 00:12:24.985\n&gt;&gt; Sure and if I wanna throw stones,\n\n245\n00:12:24.985 --> 00:12:28.085\nI definitely wanna make sure my house\nhas as little glass as possible.\n\n246\n00:12:28.085 --> 00:12:30.020\n&gt;&gt; As little glass as possible, exactly.\n\n247\n00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:33.605\n[LAUGH] All right, now when we do attack\nsurface analysis they'll break it down\n\n248\n00:12:33.605 --> 00:12:37.655\ninto three categories, application,\nnetwork, and employee.\n\n249\n00:12:37.655 --> 00:12:40.525\nDefinitely not an all-inclusive list, but\n\n250\n00:12:40.525 --> 00:12:44.395\nit's still a good way to kinda\ngeneralize what we're looking at.\n\n251\n00:12:44.395 --> 00:12:46.249\nApplications, applications,\n\n252\n00:12:46.249 --> 00:12:49.700\neach application could have\nits own attack surface, right?\n\n253\n00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:54.870\nIt's how much code is involved in that\napplication, the more code there is,\n\n254\n00:12:54.870 --> 00:13:01.035\nthe more places for malware to hide or\nfor mistakes in code.\n\n255\n00:13:01.035 --> 00:13:04.589\nAnd more so\nthe number of inputs an application has.\n\n256\n00:13:04.589 --> 00:13:09.350\nAnywhere if it's accepting user input,\nlike a form on a web page or\n\n257\n00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:13.867\nan application that wants you\nto type in certain information.\n\n258\n00:13:13.867 --> 00:13:18.265\nWell, that's a place for\na user to interact with the application.\n\n259\n00:13:18.265 --> 00:13:21.477\nAnd if you're using the application\nas you should be, no problems.\n\n260\n00:13:21.477 --> 00:13:25.541\nBut when a bad guy or\nsomebody malicious uses that application,\n\n261\n00:13:25.541 --> 00:13:29.616\nthey're not going to put what's\nexpected in that box, right?\n\n262\n00:13:29.616 --> 00:13:32.628\nInstead of putting in a password,\nthey might type in\n\n263\n00:13:32.628 --> 00:13:37.470\nan entire SQL injection statement,\nand run a query against your database.\n\n264\n00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:42.490\nNot what that form was designed for,\nbut it's where a user could\n\n265\n00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:48.790\ntry to take advantage, or a bad actor,\nor a threat actor, all right?\n\n266\n00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:50.240\nThe number of running services, right?\n\n267\n00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.812\nA service is something that runs on\na computer that responds to requests and\n\n268\n00:13:53.812 --> 00:13:54.902\nprovides something.\n\n269\n00:13:54.902 --> 00:14:01.355\nLike DNS when you request name resolution,\nor DHCP when you request an IP address,\n\n270\n00:14:01.355 --> 00:14:05.423\nor Active Directory when\nyou request a log on token.\n\n271\n00:14:05.423 --> 00:14:08.661\nAll right, those are all\nservices that are listening, and\n\n272\n00:14:08.661 --> 00:14:13.145\nthen you interact with them and\ntypically receive something from them.\n\n273\n00:14:13.145 --> 00:14:18.244\nWell, the more services I have running,\nthen the bigger my attack surface is.\n\n274\n00:14:18.244 --> 00:14:22.437\nCuz each one of those surfaces can\nbe thought of as a doorway in or\n\n275\n00:14:22.437 --> 00:14:24.910\na potential doorway in.\n\n276\n00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:27.975\nAll of the ports that those\napplications are listening on, right?\n\n277\n00:14:27.975 --> 00:14:30.370\nWe'll talk more about\nfirewalls in a future episode,\n\n278\n00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:35.210\nbut every time we open up a port it's\nlike opening up a window in your house.\n\n279\n00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:37.130\nIt's one more way somebody\ncan try to get in.\n\n280\n00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:38.610\nIf we're not watching those ports and\n\n281\n00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:43.220\npaying attention to them, if I only have\none port open, relatively easy to monitor.\n\n282\n00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.894\nBut if I have 20, 30 ports open,\n\n283\n00:14:44.894 --> 00:14:47.378\nnow it becomes more work to\nmonitor all of those ports.\n\n284\n00:14:47.378 --> 00:14:53.460\nSo the more ports you're listening on,\nthe bigger your attack surface is.\n\n285\n00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:54.810\nWhen it comes to network,\n\n286\n00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.820\nwe're talking about things like\njust network design in general.\n\n287\n00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:01.760\nIs it one big subnet or have I\nsegregated it out to where I've got my\n\n288\n00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:06.820\nmission critical servers on one subnet,\nall of my employees on a different subnet,\n\n289\n00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:10.300\nmy publicly facing resources\non a different subnet, so\n\n290\n00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.360\nthat we've got a little separation.\n\n291\n00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.928\nAnd with that separation comes\na little bit of security.\n\n292\n00:15:13.928 --> 00:15:18.136\nCuz I can put something in between those\ntwo that's causing the separation and\n\n293\n00:15:18.136 --> 00:15:21.630\nthen controlling traffic as\nit's going back and forth.\n\n294\n00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:23.540\nAnd again,\nwe'll talk more about that later, but for\n\n295\n00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.300\nnow just the general concept.\n\n296\n00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:29.150\nYour network design is a big part\nof reducing your attack surface.\n\n297\n00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.488\nPlacement, again,\nof those critical systems.\n\n298\n00:15:31.488 --> 00:15:34.645\nAnd we'll talk more about that as well.\n\n299\n00:15:34.645 --> 00:15:38.890\nBut when we talk about placement of\nservers, where do I put them, right?\n\n300\n00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:42.070\nIf it's a server that's\nproviding an internal resource,\n\n301\n00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:45.220\nit definitely doesn't need to\nbe out there public facing.\n\n302\n00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.320\nThe public doesn't need\nto see that server.\n\n303\n00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:51.926\nThe server should probably not be on the\nsame subnet as my kiosk machines, right,\n\n304\n00:15:51.926 --> 00:15:55.066\nbecause those kiosks have\na different level of security\n\n305\n00:15:55.066 --> 00:15:57.495\nthan my Active Directory server, right?\n\n306\n00:15:57.495 --> 00:16:00.112\nMy kiosk needs to allow a certain\nlevel of public access, but\n\n307\n00:16:00.112 --> 00:16:01.254\nnot my Active Directory.\n\n308\n00:16:01.254 --> 00:16:05.012\nSo by segregating them out, we can Kind\nof like what we talked about principles,\n\n309\n00:16:05.012 --> 00:16:08.605\nnot principles of least privilege,\nwhen we talked earlier about, yeah,\n\n310\n00:16:08.605 --> 00:16:11.673\nprinciples of least privilege,\nit's the same kind of concept.\n\n311\n00:16:11.673 --> 00:16:18.150\nI don't wanna, I'm sorry, I keep saying\nthat, it's classification of data.\n\n312\n00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:19.660\nSimilar in concept there, right?\n\n313\n00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:23.320\nWe look at our servers and\nwe look at access level are required.\n\n314\n00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:27.770\nAnd those that require very controlled\naccess have a different set of rules\n\n315\n00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:31.740\napplied to them than the ones\nthat have public access.\n\n316\n00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:36.710\nFirewall placement rules, network devices\nlike your intrusion detection systems and\n\n317\n00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:38.290\nyour VPNs, right?\n\n318\n00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:40.580\nThese are all doorways into your network.\n\n319\n00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.420\nSo we need to pay attention to those.\n\n320\n00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:48.240\nAnd then employees, the employees\nare a large part of our attack surface.\n\n321\n00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:52.300\nThey have the risk of social engineering.\n\n322\n00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:57.005\nIf we don't train our employees not to\nclick on links in emails, not to blindly\n\n323\n00:16:57.005 --> 00:17:01.595\naccept that a phone call is coming\nfrom the help desk, things like that.\n\n324\n00:17:01.595 --> 00:17:05.835\nNot to just, just because the guy\nis wearing a hat that says GTE, or\n\n325\n00:17:05.835 --> 00:17:08.905\nwhatever your local phone company is,\ndon't just let him in the building.\n\n326\n00:17:08.905 --> 00:17:12.655\nNot check for credentials, not ask\nif anybody was expecting him, right?\n\n327\n00:17:12.655 --> 00:17:17.340\nWith these, our employees are a big\npart of our attack surface.\n\n328\n00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:20.780\nBut by training them we can\nreduce that attack surface.\n\n329\n00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.720\nBecause we know they're\ngonna respond correctly, or\n\n330\n00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:26.820\nwe hope that they're gonna respond\ncorrectly put in those situations.\n\n331\n00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:29.850\nHuman errors, again,\ntraining can prevent that.\n\n332\n00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:33.948\nMalicious behavior, keeping our employees\nhappy, I can't prevent that, so\n\n333\n00:17:33.948 --> 00:17:35.622\ndon't make the employees mad.\n\n334\n00:17:35.622 --> 00:17:38.200\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And when you do, make sure you\n\n335\n00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.390\nterminate that account access, right,\nwhen you terminate the employee.\n\n336\n00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:43.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Absolutely, lock them out.\n\n337\n00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:46.820\nAnd then last, so\nthat's attack surface again.\n\n338\n00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:50.280\nThink about your attack surfaces,\nhow much of it is exposed?\n\n339\n00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.895\nAnd we can look at a different levels,\napplication level, network level,\n\n340\n00:17:53.895 --> 00:17:55.090\nemployee level.\n\n341\n00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:58.930\nFor your in general, the attack\nsurfaces how much exposure I have?\n\n342\n00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:00.370\nAnd we always wanna try to limit that.\n\n343\n00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:01.600\nWe can avoid it.\n\n344\n00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.250\nMy Web server has to be\navailable to public or\n\n345\n00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:07.400\nnobody is gonna come to my website and\nbuy my products.\n\n346\n00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.030\nBut I can limit the access, right?\n\n347\n00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:13.570\nI can control how much\nexposure I'm giving and\n\n348\n00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:17.485\ntherefore keeping our\nnetwork a little bit safer.\n\n349\n00:18:17.485 --> 00:18:22.050\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Mike, it looks like the\nlast one we have here is threat modeling.\n\n350\n00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:24.770\nSo what are we talking about\nwhen say threat modeling?\n\n351\n00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.096\n&gt;&gt; I don't really know for sure.\n\n352\n00:18:26.096 --> 00:18:26.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm kidding.\n\n353\n00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:31.756\n[LAUGH] When we talk about threat\nmodeling, we're really kind of along\n\n354\n00:18:31.756 --> 00:18:35.890\nthe same lines of risk assessment but\na little more in depth.\n\n355\n00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:38.600\nAnd it depends on where you go and\nwhat you read.\n\n356\n00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.260\nIt'll be slightly different on each one.\n\n357\n00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.170\nBut there are some core\nconcepts that we can\n\n358\n00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:45.800\ntalk about when it comes\nto threat modeling.\n\n359\n00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.740\nReally, when it comes to threat modeling,\n\n360\n00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:49.830\nwe're taking a step back\nfrom risk assessment.\n\n361\n00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:55.470\nRemember with risk assessment, we wanted\nto identify, assess, and prioritize.\n\n362\n00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:59.340\nSo we identify that risk, we assess what\nthat risk is, what the threat is that\n\n363\n00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:02.760\ncould take advantage of that risk,\nwhat the likelihood and impact was.\n\n364\n00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:07.670\nAnd then, we did our prioritization,\ndecide which ones we needed to\n\n365\n00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:10.870\nwork on first, which ones we wanted\nto spend the money on first.\n\n366\n00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:14.917\nThreat modeling really does all of that,\nbut\n\n367\n00:19:14.917 --> 00:19:20.681\nkinda tries to look at it from\nan overall perspective, I guess.\n\n368\n00:19:20.681 --> 00:19:22.460\nLet me read you, like from Microsoft.\n\n369\n00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:25.840\nTheir threat modeling\nprocess identify your assets.\n\n370\n00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:29.070\nWe already talked about doing that and\nrisk management, right?\n\n371\n00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:32.280\nIf we don't know what assets we have,\nwe can't protect them.\n\n372\n00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.000\nThose assets could be humans,\nright, our employees.\n\n373\n00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.793\nIt could be data.\nIt could be our servers,\n\n374\n00:19:36.793 --> 00:19:41.200\napplications that we're running,\nhardware on our network.\n\n375\n00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.910\nAll of those are assets.\n\n376\n00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:47.020\nAnd we need to know what assets we\nhave before we can protect them.\n\n377\n00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.750\nIt's like when you buy insurance for\nyour home, homeowner's insurance.\n\n378\n00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:51.557\nYou wanna go through and\nlist all your valuables, right?\n\n379\n00:19:51.557 --> 00:19:54.220\nBecause if it's not on the list,\nit's not covered.\n\n380\n00:19:55.930 --> 00:20:00.100\nCreate an architecture overview,\nto define your networks.\n\n381\n00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.680\nDefine what machines you have,\nwhat access goes from where and to where?\n\n382\n00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:07.730\nDecompose the application.\n\n383\n00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:10.340\nNow, this is something that we might or\n\n384\n00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.230\nmight not be doing depending on\nthe level that we're going to.\n\n385\n00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:17.140\nBut remember, we talked about\napplications having an attack surface.\n\n386\n00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.392\nAnd I say we might or\n\n387\n00:20:18.392 --> 00:20:23.648\nmight not do this mainly because a lot\nof times the code is proprietary, right?\n\n388\n00:20:23.648 --> 00:20:26.236\nIf I buy go buy a Photoshop,\nI can't go to Adobe and\n\n389\n00:20:26.236 --> 00:20:27.974\nsay hey I wanna look at your code.\n\n390\n00:20:27.974 --> 00:20:30.559\nI wanna make sure you don't\nhave any errors in there,\n\n391\n00:20:30.559 --> 00:20:33.850\nany crazy vulnerabilities or\nany back doors hidden in there.\n\n392\n00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:34.680\nThey are gonna laugh at me.\n\n393\n00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.870\nThey're not gonna give me their\ncode because it's proprietary.\n\n394\n00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:38.420\nThey make their money selling that.\n\n395\n00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.400\nThey're not gonna give it to me.\n\n396\n00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:43.260\nSo if we can,\nwe can decompose applications.\n\n397\n00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:48.150\nThere are, there's software out there that\nwill let us take an application, run it.\n\n398\n00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.300\nIt will look and see what it does and\n\n399\n00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.610\nit can help us break down what calls\nit's making, things like that.\n\n400\n00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:56.050\nBut this would again help us determine\n\n401\n00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:58.550\nwhat vulnerabilities\nthat software might have.\n\n402\n00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:01.950\nIdentify your threats, document your\nthreats, and rate your threats.\n\n403\n00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.470\nReally kind of the same thing\nwe did with risk management.\n\n404\n00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:11.238\nSo that's why I say threat modeling is,\nit's just another term that kind of\n\n405\n00:21:11.238 --> 00:21:16.320\ntalks about the same thing but\nwhereas risk we're dealing with.\n\n406\n00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:20.920\nRemember, a risk is anything that\ncould have an impact on my network and\n\n407\n00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:24.340\nwe wanna look at the likelihood and\nthe impacts.\n\n408\n00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:28.430\nThreat modeling,\nwe're gonna take a look at behaviors, but\n\n409\n00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:30.540\ndoing all of those same kind of things.\n\n410\n00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.760\nIdentifying the assets,\nbreaking down the application,\n\n411\n00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.080\nidentifying what those threats are.\n\n412\n00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:42.307\nI'm trying to think of a good example\nwe could do some threat modeling with.\n\n413\n00:21:42.307 --> 00:21:46.010\nWe have, in here,\nwe're a multi-tenant facility, right?\n\n414\n00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:51.120\nSo we have ours and then we have other\nbusinesses in the same building as us.\n\n415\n00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:55.820\nSo the threat might be one of\nthose other business employees\n\n416\n00:21:55.820 --> 00:22:00.370\nwalking through our office area, and\nseeing information they shouldn't see.\n\n417\n00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:04.252\nOr trying to gain access to systems that\nthey shouldn't gain or have access to.\n\n418\n00:22:04.252 --> 00:22:07.460\nSo when we look at our architecture\noverview, this might be more of\n\n419\n00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:11.340\na floor plan, looking at how\ndifferent rooms are connected.\n\n420\n00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:13.330\nDecompose the application.\n\n421\n00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:15.580\nIn this case, not really an app,\nbut we might break down,\n\n422\n00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.840\nwhat doors do we have in place.\n\n423\n00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.750\nThe threat is somebody coming in and\naccessing information or\n\n424\n00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.590\nseeing stuff they shouldn't see.\n\n425\n00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:25.083\nSo we put locks in place or\n\n426\n00:22:25.083 --> 00:22:28.795\nwe'll put some kind of controlled\naccess on those doorways.\n\n427\n00:22:28.795 --> 00:22:30.580\nBut that's really threat modeling.\n\n428\n00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:35.290\nIt's kinda taking a step back,\nlooking at the different threats, and\n\n429\n00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:37.070\nworking through those threats, and\n\n430\n00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:42.300\nseeing where I might apply controsl\nto limit the impact of those threats.\n\n431\n00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.400\nI guess that'd be a good way to put it.\n\n432\n00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.170\n&gt;&gt; Alright, sounds good, Mike.\n\n433\n00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:44.970\nI'm looking at it,\n\n434\n00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:47.430\nthat looks like the last of\nthe items on my glossary list here.\n\n435\n00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:51.640\nI imagine we're gonna be hearing these\nwords a lot throughout this series?\n\n436\n00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:55.300\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, this really gives us\nthose foundational terms that we need to\n\n437\n00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:58.909\nunderstand as we progress\nthrough our career and security.\n\n438\n00:22:58.909 --> 00:23:00.790\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, well,\nnow that I think we understand those,\n\n439\n00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:02.100\nit's time to go ahead and move on.\n\n440\n00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.060\nBut, not in this episode\nwhere we're out of time.\n\n441\n00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.940\nSo we're gonna save that for\nthe next episodes.\n\n442\n00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.369\nSo for now, signing off I've\nbeen your host Peter VanRysdam.\n\n443\n00:23:08.369 --> 00:23:09.553\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike

00:00:05.424\n[CROSSTALK]\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:05.424 --> 00:00:11.746\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.746 --> 00:00:13.508\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome to ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:13.508 --> 00:00:15.422\nI'm your host, Peter VansRysdam,\n\n7\n00:00:15.422 --> 00:00:19.660\nand today we are continuing with our\nseries on MTA security fundamentals.\n\n8\n00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.190\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're talking about physical security.\n\n9\n00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.640\nAnd here to help us learn all about\nthat and help us get started,\n\n10\n00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.000\nwe have Mr Mike Rodrick, so\nMike, let's get physical.\n\n11\n00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.060\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna say, to quote,\nwho was that, Olivia Newton John?\n\n12\n00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.340\n&gt;&gt; I believe it was.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, let's get physical, right?\n\n13\n00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.520\nBecause physical security is one of\nthose aspects of security that is often\n\n14\n00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.440\noverlooked or maybe not given as much\nattention or as thought as it should be.\n\n15\n00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.580\nBecause one of the things we wanna\nremember is that physical security trumps\n\n16\n00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.520\neverything else.\n\n17\n00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.390\nThere's an old set of ten immutable laws.\n\n18\n00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.580\nI think Microsoft put\nthem out a long time ago.\n\n19\n00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.758\nBut one of my favorites was,\nif the bad guy can touch your computer,\n\n20\n00:00:59.758 --> 00:01:02.266\nit's no longer your computer, right?\n\n21\n00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:06.580\nWhat they're trying to stress there is\nthe importance of physical security.\n\n22\n00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.270\nAs tech geeks, you and I, we love to\nthink about all of the technologies\n\n23\n00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.410\nthat we could put in place and controls to\nhelp control access and secure resources.\n\n24\n00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.990\nAnd those are great, and they're very\nimportant, and we have to do them.\n\n25\n00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.040\nBut if somebody can get physical access\nto your machine, whether that's a user's\n\n26\n00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.000\nworkstation or a laptop or\nan iPhone or a server in your closet,\n\n27\n00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.555\nif they can physically touch it, odds\nare they're gonna give it enough time.\n\n28\n00:01:33.555 --> 00:01:35.078\nThey're gonna be able to get into it.\n\n29\n00:01:35.078 --> 00:01:39.122\nThere's just too many things that they can\ntry to do if they have physical access.\n\n30\n00:01:39.122 --> 00:01:42.180\nA lot of our controls\nare based on the fact that\n\n31\n00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.280\npeople are coming across the network\nto break into that machine.\n\n32\n00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.150\nBut if they're physically there,\nthey can boot to an alternate OS,\n\n33\n00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.958\nthey can pull hard drives out.\n\n34\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.680\nThere's just too many things they can do,\n\n35\n00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.100\nand you might well figure\nit's now their computer.\n\n36\n00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.230\nSo the point is,\n\n37\n00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.690\nphysical security is something\nthat we have to pay attention to.\n\n38\n00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.390\nAgain, sometimes it gets overlooked or\n\n39\n00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.370\nmaybe just doesn't get enough emphasis,\nI think.\n\n40\n00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.808\nBut physical security starts way away from\nthe computers, as far as I understand.\n\n41\n00:02:10.808 --> 00:02:13.600\nSo what are some of the first layers\nof physical security when you\n\n42\n00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.180\nthink about that?\n\n43\n00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.760\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna start and\nbasically it's like concentric rings.\n\n44\n00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.410\nWe're gonna work our way in from,\nas you said, from the outside.\n\n45\n00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.870\nWe'll be talking about access control.\n\n46\n00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.540\nBut keep in mind when we're\ntalking about physical security,\n\n47\n00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.640\naccess control is not permissions and\naccess control lists.\n\n48\n00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.370\nBut more about guards checking people in\nor doors or fences or things like that.\n\n49\n00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.983\nSo still access control,\nwe're controlling access, but\n\n50\n00:02:39.983 --> 00:02:44.512\nnot to information and data,\nbut to physical locations.\n\n51\n00:02:44.512 --> 00:02:48.151\nAnd so, Peter, as you're alluding to\nthere, we'll start with site security, and\n\n52\n00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:51.800\nwe'll also talk about computer security\nas far as the physical world goes.\n\n53\n00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.130\nAnd then we'll talk a little\nbit about mobile devices and\n\n54\n00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.280\nthings like that as well.\n\n55\n00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.569\nBut when we look at site security,\nwe'll start at the very outside and\n\n56\n00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:59.360\nwork our way in.\n\n57\n00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.340\nThat's what we call out\nexternal perimeter.\n\n58\n00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.740\nAnd the external perimeter is really\nthe outside of your physical presence.\n\n59\n00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.680\nSo if you have a building, and\nthen that building sits on a lot,\n\n60\n00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.680\nand that lot has a parking lot and\na driveway, or an entryway of some kind.\n\n61\n00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.650\nAll of those grounds, the fence that runs\naround your facility's physical location,\n\n62\n00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.800\nright, that's your perimeter.\n\n63\n00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.150\nThat's really your first\nline in physical defense.\n\n64\n00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.420\nSo your parking lots, any green spaces,\nlittle bench areas for people to sit and\n\n65\n00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.800\ntake their breaks or what have you,\ndriveways, entryways from\n\n66\n00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.560\npublic areas into your, not so much to the\nbuilding, but to the grounds themselves.\n\n67\n00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.010\nThose would be considered your exterior or\nyour external perimeter.\n\n68\n00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.330\nNow how do we protect this?\n\n69\n00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.926\nWell, think about what would you\ndo if it was your house, right?\n\n70\n00:03:50.926 --> 00:03:52.560\nYou might put up a fence.\n\n71\n00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.360\nThat was a good idea.\n\n72\n00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.990\nThat keeps people out of your yard or\nmakes it a little more difficult, right?\n\n73\n00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.950\nIt's one more obstacle they would have\nto go through to get into your yard.\n\n74\n00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.740\nWhat else might you put around your house,\nPeter?\n\n75\n00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.180\n&gt;&gt; I was suggesting a moat.\n\n76\n00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.180\n&gt;&gt; A moat, yes,\na moat would be a great thing.\n\n77\n00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.630\nEspecially if we filled it with sharks and\n\n78\n00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:10.300\nlaser beams-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n79\n00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.100\n&gt;&gt; Or something.\n\n80\n00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.425\nThat would be a great barrier,\ndefinitely slow a lot of people down.\n\n81\n00:04:15.425 --> 00:04:18.600\nBut things like cameras, fences,\n\n82\n00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.920\nguards, dogs that we allow to run\ninside the fence maybe after hours.\n\n83\n00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.790\nLighting is one that is very important.\n\n84\n00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.640\nIt plays a big part in security.\n\n85\n00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.270\nIt's amazing how much security you\ncan get out of a little bit of light.\n\n86\n00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.690\nMy wife and I, we go back and forth.\n\n87\n00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.830\nI love to leave my porch light on all\nnight long, my front porch light.\n\n88\n00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.670\nAnd there's a street light\nvery near to our house, so\n\n89\n00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:40.980\na lot of my yard is lit up there.\n\n90\n00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.730\nAnd she's like,\nwhy are you leaving that on?\n\n91\n00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.880\nYou're just wasting electricity.\n\n92\n00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.610\nAnd I go out in the street and\nI look at my front door, and it's lit up.\n\n93\n00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.620\nYou can see my door,\nmy doorknob, everything's there.\n\n94\n00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.240\nI turn and I look at the neighbor's front\ndoor, and it's a little black alcove.\n\n95\n00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.080\nI can't even tell what color his door is.\n\n96\n00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.580\nAnd I'm thinking to myself, if I'm a bad\nguy, which one am I going to try to get\n\n97\n00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.860\ninto, the one where everybody\ncan see what I'm doing, or\n\n98\n00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.720\nthe one where I can be hidden in\ndarkness and take my time, right?\n\n99\n00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.810\n&gt;&gt; And that's why motion\nsensors are such a great thing,\n\n100\n00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.860\ntoo, especially if you've got ten\nentrances around your building.\n\n101\n00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.410\nIf the guard is able to see,\nhey, this one's lit up now,\n\n102\n00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.770\nthat means someone or something is there,\nwhether it's a raccoon or\n\n103\n00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.910\nit's someone trying to get in,\nit's something go check out.\n\n104\n00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:21.750\n&gt;&gt; It's a great point.\n\n105\n00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.630\nSomething has set off that motion\ndetector, so let's go find out what it is.\n\n106\n00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.540\nSo that's kind of our external perimeter\ngates with access controls, patrols.\n\n107\n00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.427\nIf you're a big facility\nyou may have guards.\n\n108\n00:05:32.427 --> 00:05:36.510\nYou think about a smaller business,\nmaybe not so much for a larger business.\n\n109\n00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.370\nI lived in DC for a while.\n\n110\n00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.180\nAnd after the whole 9/11 thing,\nyou had concrete barricades and\n\n111\n00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.860\nmen and women standing on top of\nHumvees with automatic weapons, right?\n\n112\n00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.680\nThat's a great deterrent,\nkeeping that external perimeter secure.\n\n113\n00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.590\nAnd again, we're talking about layers.\n\n114\n00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.330\nWe always talk about layers of defense.\n\n115\n00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.000\nWe're not putting all of\nour eggs in one basket.\n\n116\n00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.450\nWe don't put up a fence and go,\ndone, we don't have to do any more.\n\n117\n00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.660\nWe've got fences and dogs and\ncameras and locks, and things like that.\n\n118\n00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:05.435\n&gt;&gt; All that redundancy.\n\n119\n00:06:05.435 --> 00:06:09.120\nSo Mike, now that we've covered\nkind of the external part,\n\n120\n00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.670\nwhat happens when we get to the building?\n\n121\n00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.080\n&gt;&gt; That would be called our\ninternal parameter, right?\n\n122\n00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.560\nWe've got our external borders\nof our grounds basically,\n\n123\n00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.700\nthe internal perimeter is your buildings\nand the walls to those buildings.\n\n124\n00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.330\nSo it starts there at the building walls,\nand it would really include\n\n125\n00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.380\nmost of our internal security measures,\nstuff we would find inside the facility.\n\n126\n00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.150\nSo that lock on the front door,\nthat keypad, or\n\n127\n00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.620\nthat biometric unit, all of which\nwe'll talk about a little bit later,\n\n128\n00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.840\nwould be part of my internal perimeter\nbecause it's preventing people\n\n129\n00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.498\nfrom getting past that second\nperimeter to our facilities.\n\n130\n00:06:45.498 --> 00:06:46.239\nCameras, again,\n\n131\n00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:50.822\nwould most likely be used here, might\nbe card readers just inside the door.\n\n132\n00:06:50.822 --> 00:06:55.000\nA lot of times we find it guard desk or\nI'm a visitor, I have to check in and\n\n133\n00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.310\nverify that I've got an appointment with\nsomebody, and show my identification, and\n\n134\n00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.750\nget a visitor badge.\n\n135\n00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.720\nSo that they can tell that I'm a visitor,\n\n136\n00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.740\nas I go through the building and make sure\nI don't go into places I shouldn't be.\n\n137\n00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.898\nSmoke detectors, turnstiles.\n\n138\n00:07:09.898 --> 00:07:14.318\nWhen you think about a train station or\na subway, right, you go in there,\n\n139\n00:07:14.318 --> 00:07:18.440\nand you can get down into the subway\njust walking down the steps.\n\n140\n00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.660\nBut then there's a second\nlevel of defense there,\n\n141\n00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.230\nthat turnstile, where I've gotta\nhave my ticket to get through.\n\n142\n00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.004\nAnd we might have something like\nthat in place in larger facilities.\n\n143\n00:07:26.004 --> 00:07:29.028\nYou'll see them in courthouses and\nplaces like that,\n\n144\n00:07:29.028 --> 00:07:32.680\nwhere I have to go through metal\ndetectors, maybe, or x-rays.\n\n145\n00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.220\nMan traps, in your high-secure facilities.\n\n146\n00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.230\nThey'll have two sets of doors.\n\n147\n00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:39.930\nOne door opens up and\n\n148\n00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.890\nthat second door will not open\nup until the first door closes.\n\n149\n00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:44.990\nNow you're in between the doors and\n\n150\n00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.520\nthere might be several\nsecurity measures taking place\n\n151\n00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.430\nwhile you're between those doors before\nthe back door opens up to let you through.\n\n152\n00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.938\nMight be checking your weight.\n\n153\n00:07:53.938 --> 00:07:55.590\nDoes it have a weight limit here,\n\n154\n00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:59.680\nthat's not right you can't discriminate\nagainst me because I'm fat.\n\n155\n00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.251\nWell what they're going to do is\nthey weigh you on the way in and\n\n156\n00:08:02.251 --> 00:08:03.645\nthey can weigh you on the way out.\n\n157\n00:08:03.645 --> 00:08:07.091\nAnd if you're carrying an extra\ntwo pounds, they're looking for\n\n158\n00:08:07.091 --> 00:08:10.550\nthat laptop that you didn't walk\nin with but you did walk out with.\n\n159\n00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.330\nCould be again, scanners or\n\n160\n00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:16.880\nsome biometrics to get that second door\nopen before you're allowed to go through.\n\n161\n00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.220\n&gt;&gt; And I've seen those kinds\nof doors too at banks and\n\n162\n00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:23.300\nplaces like that where it's not just for\ngetting in, it's for going out.\n\n163\n00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.930\nSo all of a sudden if you're running\nout with the loot you just stole,\n\n164\n00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.340\nthey've got you trapped pretty much\nin between these two doors and\n\n165\n00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.640\nthey can just wait for the officials.\n\n166\n00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's like a fish in\na bowl right at that point.\n\n167\n00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.820\nYou think you're home free you went\nright through that first door.\n\n168\n00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.420\nThe second door doesn't open, you turn\naround, the door's locked behind you,\n\n169\n00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.690\nyou got a lot of money and nowhere to go.\n\n170\n00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:46.660\nSo yeah, all of that would be\nconsidered are internal perimeter.\n\n171\n00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:52.690\nWe've got, really,\none other concept I wanna mention here.\n\n172\n00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:56.330\nPhysical implementation of\nprinciple of least privilege.\n\n173\n00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.970\nWe've talked about principle of least\nprivilege, if we haven't we will again.\n\n174\n00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:04.090\nBut we can implement that on\nthe electronic level with permissions and\n\n175\n00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:04.830\ngroups.\n\n176\n00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.250\nWe can also do it physically,\nas well, right?\n\n177\n00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:12.000\nLike we take our facilities here,\nmost of us have a fob, or a key,\n\n178\n00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.210\nthat will get us into the building.\n\n179\n00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:15.690\nBut only certain ones,\n\n180\n00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:19.830\ncertain employees have a key that will\nallow them into the server closet.\n\n181\n00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:22.810\nBecause just cuz you're an employee\ndoesn't mean you need access to\n\n182\n00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:23.850\nthe server closet.\n\n183\n00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:27.590\nWe don't just give everybody everything\njust because it's easier that way.\n\n184\n00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:29.440\nWe follow that principle\nof least privilege.\n\n185\n00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.510\nIf you don't have the right clearance\nyou're not allowed to go past\n\n186\n00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:33.460\na certain point.\n\n187\n00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:38.240\nI think of NCIS and the the iris scan they\ndo before they go into the knoc, right.\n\n188\n00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.180\nBecause you might be an employee but\nyou don't have rights to go into the knoc.\n\n189\n00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:46.880\nAnd if you're not authorized,\nyou're not gonna be allowed to go through.\n\n190\n00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.960\nSo remember it's kind of\na physical implementation\n\n191\n00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.740\nof the principle of least privilege.\n\n192\n00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.810\nAll right and\nthen there's one more level inside that.\n\n193\n00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:57.840\nYou might think well wait,\nwe're inside the building.\n\n194\n00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.530\nI wonder what else it's gonna be.\n\n195\n00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:02.250\nWell, like I just mentioned,\nwhat about that server closet?\n\n196\n00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:06.000\nThis is an area that's all ready\nsecured by my external parameter,\n\n197\n00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.720\nit's all ready secured by my internal\nparameter, but we're gonna add one\n\n198\n00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.510\nmore layer of defense because of\nthat principle of least privilege.\n\n199\n00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.620\nJust because you're in the building\ndoesn't mean you should get into\n\n200\n00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.840\nthe server closet.\n\n201\n00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:23.780\nI did some consulting with a power\ncompany down in Tampa St. Peter area.\n\n202\n00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.930\nAnd I thought it was interesting\nwhen I first saw this,\n\n203\n00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:30.830\nwas their printer area was a room\nabout the size of this studio.\n\n204\n00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.430\nSeveral printers and\nit had one of those old half doors,\n\n205\n00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:37.450\nthe barn style doors where the top half\nopens and the bottom half can stay closed.\n\n206\n00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:40.080\nAnd there was a person inside there,\nand I needed to print something.\n\n207\n00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.310\nI walk over there.\n\n208\n00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:44.180\nAnd you're not allowed to\nwalk into the printer area.\n\n209\n00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:49.450\nThey have a person that their job is to\nget the print job and bring it to you.\n\n210\n00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:50.410\nWell why?\n\n211\n00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:53.080\nWell because somebody else might\nbe printing something that I'm not\n\n212\n00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.330\nauthorized to see.\n\n213\n00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.960\nAnd I might be able to walk down to\nthe printers look for my print job and\n\n214\n00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.080\npick up that thing that\npayroll printed and\n\n215\n00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.980\nsee information that I'm\nnot authorized to see.\n\n216\n00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.890\nOld school, we think about some of\nthose printers with the ribbons inside.\n\n217\n00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:07.500\nIf you could, the fax machines.\n\n218\n00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.130\nI remember you could\nstretch that paper out and\n\n219\n00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:11.470\nkind of read what people had faxed.\n\n220\n00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:14.580\nNot quite the case nowadays but\nthat's same concept, right?\n\n221\n00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.060\nThere's buffers in those printers and\n\n222\n00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.210\nthings like that that somebody\ncould try to get access to.\n\n223\n00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:19.320\n&gt;&gt; And that worries me a lot,\n\n224\n00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.805\nbecause I can think that Mike's desk\nis literally right next to our printer.\n\n225\n00:11:22.805 --> 00:11:23.995\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; At our office.\n\n226\n00:11:23.995 --> 00:11:26.280\n&gt;&gt; I see everything that\ncomes out of there.\n\n227\n00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:31.300\nSo again when we talk about secure areas\nwe're just talking about additional\n\n228\n00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:36.530\nsecurity applied within the building\nitself or within the facility itself.\n\n229\n00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:40.820\nAnd we might use things\nlike badge readers.\n\n230\n00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.580\nAgain a lot of the stuff that we used in\nthe perimeter, card readers, key pads,\n\n231\n00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.508\nbiometrics.\n\n232\n00:11:45.508 --> 00:11:49.000\nSecurity doors, x-ray scanners,\nmetal detectors,\n\n233\n00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.540\ncameras, even some intrusion\ndetection systems.\n\n234\n00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.630\nAnd you think well wait,\nisn't that a network based thing?\n\n235\n00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.570\nYes, but you can also think of intrusion\nprotection as a physical thing\n\n236\n00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:01.520\nif we look at light beams, right?\n\n237\n00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.460\nI think of some of those\nTom Cruise movies and\n\n238\n00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:08.200\nthey're dancing around the little laser\nbeams after they spray the fog in the air.\n\n239\n00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.010\nMaybe not quite realistic but\nthe same concept right?\n\n240\n00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:14.150\nYou might have a room that has ultrasonic\nbeams that are going through there.\n\n241\n00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.580\nAnd somebody crosses those.\n\n242\n00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:16.930\nYou see this in museums.\n\n243\n00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.980\nPlaces where you can't get\ntoo close to the artwork but\n\n244\n00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.610\nthey don't wanna Might have a fence so\nthat you can still see the artwork, right.\n\n245\n00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.630\nSo depending on your level of\nsecurity that you need and\n\n246\n00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:27.520\nwhat you need to provide.\n\n247\n00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.970\nThose kinds of solutions\nmight be appropriate.\n\n248\n00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:31.050\nBut again the point is,\n\n249\n00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:34.920\nwe don't have to memorize every single\ntype of control that we can put in place.\n\n250\n00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.400\nBut understand the concept\nof layers of defense, right.\n\n251\n00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:42.310\nAnd that physical security is important,\nand that we apply it in different areas\n\n252\n00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:45.920\nto provide strength because\nit's gonna slow people down.\n\n253\n00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:50.121\nNo solution is gonna be 100%, but\n\n254\n00:12:50.121 --> 00:12:53.040\nhopefully they might make it\nthrough one or two layers but\n\n255\n00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.780\nthey're not gonna make it through\nall of them before they're detected.\n\n256\n00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:59.480\nWe also have to think about\ninternal employees, right?\n\n257\n00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:03.400\nA lot of times we get focused on\nthe bad guys coming from the outside,\n\n258\n00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.130\nwhether that's network-based attacks or\nphysical attacks.\n\n259\n00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:10.420\nSomebody dressing up in phone workers\njumpsuit and trying to get in or\n\n260\n00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:13.250\nI'm a FedEx employee I'm\nhere to deliver a package.\n\n261\n00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:15.370\nAnd those kind of things\nwe think about that but\n\n262\n00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:19.260\nInternal employees can be just\nin danger if not more so.\n\n263\n00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:23.720\nBecause think about an internal employee,\na bad guy might be able to get in but\n\n264\n00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.650\nhe still has to gain\naccess to the network.\n\n265\n00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:28.712\nThat disgruntled employee,\nthey've already got a user name and\n\n266\n00:13:28.712 --> 00:13:30.235\npassword that´s valid on the network.\n\n267\n00:13:30.235 --> 00:13:34.645\nThey might have a badge, they can get them\nin to some of those more restricted areas\n\n268\n00:13:34.645 --> 00:13:36.685\nso we've had to take extra precautions.\n\n269\n00:13:36.685 --> 00:13:41.745\nThat´s where the cameras come into play\nand just accounting, keeping track of\n\n270\n00:13:41.745 --> 00:13:45.685\nwho swiped their badge at what time, what\ntime they entered, what time they left.\n\n271\n00:13:45.685 --> 00:13:48.585\nThose kind of things can help\nus with our physical security\n\n272\n00:13:48.585 --> 00:13:51.119\nonce we are inside our building.\n\n273\n00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:53.760\nAll right, so those are,\n\n274\n00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:58.490\nthat's really when we talk about physical\nsecurity as far as our site goes.\n\n275\n00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:02.220\nWe've got your external,\nyour internal and your security areas and\n\n276\n00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.750\nrestricted areas within there.\n\n277\n00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:08.190\nThen we'll move on into computer\nsecurity and again, not so\n\n278\n00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:11.300\nmuch electronic or technologically.\n\n279\n00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.020\nNow we know we should apply patches and\n\n280\n00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:17.280\nwe're gonna talk a lot about ways I\ncan control access electronically.\n\n281\n00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.300\nBut when it comes to physical\nsecurity with computers,\n\n282\n00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:24.570\nas I said earlier, it's a very\nimportant part of our security process.\n\n283\n00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:26.430\nSo these are gonna be processes, policies,\n\n284\n00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:29.464\nprocedures that we put in place\nto protect our computer systems.\n\n285\n00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.000\nNow, just like we do with users and\n\n286\n00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.640\npermissions, we do the principle\nof least privilege.\n\n287\n00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.770\nNot everybody needs the exact\nsame level of access.\n\n288\n00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:42.770\nJust like we do with our physical\nsecurity, not every room within\n\n289\n00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:47.350\nthe building needs the same level of\nphysical protection applied to it.\n\n290\n00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:50.250\nThe server's closet is different\nfrom the janitor's closet, right?\n\n291\n00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:53.900\nEven though those supplies can be\nexpensive, we typically don't spend\n\n292\n00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:57.180\nthousands of dollars on methods to keep\npeople out of the janitor's closet.\n\n293\n00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:01.470\nSo different, we first we look at\nwhat's in there, we're basically\n\n294\n00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:05.390\nassessing what we've got and determining\nwhat the appropriate security level is.\n\n295\n00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:08.840\nWell, with the computers it's the same\nthing, we have different computers, right?\n\n296\n00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:12.290\nWe have different types of computers,\ncomputers with different purposes, and so\n\n297\n00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:15.710\nthe security that we apply to them when\nwe're talking about physical security\n\n298\n00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:18.190\nIt's gonna be slightly different as well.\n\n299\n00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:21.560\nSome can be applied to all of them,\nbut then other pieces or\n\n300\n00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.400\ncomponents might be applied only\nto certain types of machines.\n\n301\n00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.140\nSo let's make sure we\nunderstand the difference.\n\n302\n00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:30.670\nWe've got our servers, we've got desktop\ncomputers, and we've got mobile computers.\n\n303\n00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:34.830\nWhen we talk about servers, these\nare just physical machines or virtual,\n\n304\n00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:38.830\nthey're really one in the same,\nthat are designed to run\n\n305\n00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:42.400\ncentralized applications or\nprovide services to the network.\n\n306\n00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:47.157\nYou typically don't go in and sit at the\nserver and log in and check your email and\n\n307\n00:15:47.157 --> 00:15:48.871\nsurf the Internet, right?\n\n308\n00:15:48.871 --> 00:15:53.108\nThese servers are set up to provide\nauthentication, when everybody gets to\n\n309\n00:15:53.108 --> 00:15:57.145\nwork they can log in or DNS name\nresolution or IP address configuration or\n\n310\n00:15:57.145 --> 00:16:01.516\nCustom applications, database applications\nthat your company is running or\n\n311\n00:16:01.516 --> 00:16:04.490\nproviding virtual desktop infrastructure.\n\n312\n00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:06.690\nAny number of things those\nservers can be providing.\n\n313\n00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:09.760\nBut they're very high powered,\ndesigned to run\n\n314\n00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:14.090\nwhere their priority is running\nbackground tests and providing services.\n\n315\n00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:17.140\nUsually servers are configured\nwith a lot of redundancy.\n\n316\n00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.220\nBecause if your laptop goes down or\n\n317\n00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:23.780\nyour workstation goes down, one person\nis out of work for ten, 15, 20 minutes.\n\n318\n00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.810\nWe re-image a new machine,\nand we get you back to work.\n\n319\n00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:29.010\nIf one of my servers goes down,\n\n320\n00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:32.300\neverybody in the company loses\naccess to that particular service.\n\n321\n00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.020\nSo we have redundancy.\n\n322\n00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:36.430\nMultiple servers providing\nthe same service.\n\n323\n00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.130\nRedundancy within the server.\n\n324\n00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:41.610\nRedundant power supplies,\nredundant hard drives.\n\n325\n00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:44.950\nAnd so servers typically have a lot\nof redundancy built into them.\n\n326\n00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:51.090\nDesktop computers, designed to be in\na single location, not real portable.\n\n327\n00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:55.410\nI know some of you will say, well I\ndrag mine to my LAN party every weekend.\n\n328\n00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:57.940\nMy hundred pound computer,\nhere it goes with me.\n\n329\n00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:02.016\nI've got a special backpack that I\nput on and- yeah well, that's fine.\n\n330\n00:17:02.016 --> 00:17:04.360\nBut they're not really designed for\nthat, right?\n\n331\n00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:07.150\nWe think of them as being\nset up in a location and\n\n332\n00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:09.090\nthey usually don't move from there.\n\n333\n00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:13.700\nThey run local apps like your locally\ninstalled Office or Mahjong, or\n\n334\n00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.950\nwhatever it is you wanna\ninstall on your machine.\n\n335\n00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:18.470\nAnd then they'll connect to servers for\n\n336\n00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:21.310\nresources that the servers\nare providing across a network.\n\n337\n00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:23.670\nFor authentication, for\nDNS, for DHCP, etc.\n\n338\n00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:26.960\nAnd then you've got your mobile computers.\n\n339\n00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.570\nAnd mobile computers, really, we're\njust gonna leave it very general here.\n\n340\n00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.970\nWe're gonna say these are things\nlike laptops, notebooks,\n\n341\n00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:37.150\ntablets, even iPads and\nsome of our smartphones.\n\n342\n00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:39.610\nWe'll call them mobile computers\nat this point because they are,\n\n343\n00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:42.980\nwe can,\non my phone I have VPN clients, right.\n\n344\n00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.153\nSo I can VPN into my work network.\n\n345\n00:17:45.153 --> 00:17:47.480\nI have remote desktop clients.\n\n346\n00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.740\nSo, I can control a computer remotely.\n\n347\n00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:54.221\nThey really are small computers just very,\nvery small and portable.\n\n348\n00:17:54.221 --> 00:17:57.840\nAnd that's one of the big advantages of\nmobile computers is their affordability.\n\n349\n00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.960\nThey've run on batteries, so I don't\nhave to be plugged in all the time.\n\n350\n00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.930\nAnd I can take them with me and\nfire them up whenever I need them.\n\n351\n00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:10.190\nBut that also brings along some\nrisk associated with it, all right?\n\n352\n00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:14.500\nBecause they're portable, because\nthey're small, they're easy to lose.\n\n353\n00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.190\nThey're easy to leave laying somewhere.\n\n354\n00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:19.730\nThey're easy to forget in\nthe back of the cab, all right?\n\n355\n00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:24.370\nLeave it laying on the restaurant\ntable somewhere and that machine or\n\n356\n00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:27.310\nthat phone or what have you could\nbe connected back to work so\n\n357\n00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:28.790\nnow somebody else has that device.\n\n358\n00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:32.410\nAnd they could potentially be connecting\ninto the work network as you, right?\n\n359\n00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:34.800\nOr whatever your\ncredentials have access to?\n\n360\n00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:39.140\nThey now have access to it, so it's\nsomething that we've got to think about.\n\n361\n00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:40.630\nSo how do we secure them?\n\n362\n00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:43.198\nServers typically are put\nin a separate room,\n\n363\n00:18:43.198 --> 00:18:47.300\nwe talked about our secure\nareas within our facilities.\n\n364\n00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:50.890\nTypically, we have our rack setup with\nour switches, and our routers, and\n\n365\n00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:55.880\nour servers, our firewalls and what have\nyou, and then that's in a secured room.\n\n366\n00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.320\nAnd only people that need\nphysical access to the machines,\n\n367\n00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.930\nnot even all my administrators.\n\n368\n00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:02.050\nMost administration can be done remotely.\n\n369\n00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:03.000\nSo just because you're an admin,\n\n370\n00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.650\nit doesn't mean you're getting\na key to the server closet, right?\n\n371\n00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:07.800\nPrinciple of least privilege.\n\n372\n00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:13.730\nDesktop computers, we can put locks\non them, we can do cable locks.\n\n373\n00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:16.760\nAgain, they're really\nnot considered portable,\n\n374\n00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:21.536\nalthough I'm pretty sure I could walk\naway with one of those Dell 745s, but\n\n375\n00:19:21.536 --> 00:19:26.660\nwe can secure them with\ncables if we need to.\n\n376\n00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:33.710\nA lot of it's about monitoring,\ncameras, trying to think of what else?\n\n377\n00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:35.780\nAuthentication, but\nwe'll come back to that.\n\n378\n00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:40.020\nPhysical security wise, it's really\njust making sure you lock the screen and\n\n379\n00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:44.370\nso you don't leave it open so\npeople can access it.\n\n380\n00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:46.350\nAnd doing an examination,\n\n381\n00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:50.690\na visual examination of the machine with\ndesktop computer is always important.\n\n382\n00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:53.220\nBut we'll come back to that concept.\n\n383\n00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.680\nMobile computers.\n\n384\n00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.210\nHere again, we've got Kensington locks,\n\n385\n00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:00.840\nany type of lock we can use\nto secure that to the desk.\n\n386\n00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:05.260\nSame thing with phones, putting them\nin if you've got a drawer that locks,\n\n387\n00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:06.560\nyou can put your tablet in there.\n\n388\n00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.440\nWhen you travel at the hotel,\njust about every hotel has a safe,\n\n389\n00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.610\nput your tablets in there,\nall right, secure those guys.\n\n390\n00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:17.850\n&gt;&gt; And one of the things I see all\nthe time too are the privacy screens on\n\n391\n00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:19.130\nyour computer, so.\n\n392\n00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:23.130\nIf you are on your laptop working out in\nthe break room or something like that,\n\n393\n00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:25.400\npeople aren't able to actually see\nthe information on your computer.\n\n394\n00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.450\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\nIt reduces that angle of field of view or\n\n395\n00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:29.950\nthe angle of view on there, so\n\n396\n00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:33.170\nthe person sitting next to you\ncan't read everything you're doing.\n\n397\n00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:37.862\nFantastic, and a lot of these mobile\ndevices have Track-me type software built\n\n398\n00:20:37.862 --> 00:20:40.142\ninto them, so that we can enable that.\n\n399\n00:20:40.142 --> 00:20:44.334\nAnd if we leave that phone in the cab,\nwe can try to get the physical location of\n\n400\n00:20:44.334 --> 00:20:46.979\nthat device by going to a webpage and\nlogging in,\n\n401\n00:20:46.979 --> 00:20:51.610\ntrying to ping that phone, or make it make\na noise, or seeing where it is on a map.\n\n402\n00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:53.960\nSo if you have those\nfeatures as a corporation,\n\n403\n00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:57.260\nwe want to make sure those are enabled and\nthat our users can't disable them.\n\n404\n00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:02.750\nAll right, so you have physical security\nwith servers with mobile, with desktop\n\n405\n00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:07.840\ncomputers, really just all about servers\nhave a kind of higher level of security.\n\n406\n00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.705\nMobiles, mobile computers\nhave a higher level for\n\n407\n00:21:09.705 --> 00:21:13.225\na different reason because they're\nportable and easy to lose.\n\n408\n00:21:14.845 --> 00:21:19.475\nRemoval devices in drives, another big\nproblem when it comes to security or\n\n409\n00:21:19.475 --> 00:21:24.017\ncan introduce a lot of risk when\nit when it comes to security.\n\n410\n00:21:24.017 --> 00:21:26.597\nBecause a lot of the same things\nas our phones and tablets, right.\n\n411\n00:21:26.597 --> 00:21:28.267\nThey're easy to lose.\n\n412\n00:21:28.267 --> 00:21:33.417\nI can't tell you how many thumb drives\nI've gone through over the last few years.\n\n413\n00:21:33.417 --> 00:21:37.227\nAnd one of the big problems\nis that people don't hesitate\n\n414\n00:21:37.227 --> 00:21:39.437\nto put confidential information on there.\n\n415\n00:21:39.437 --> 00:21:41.887\nHey, I need to take this presentation\nhome so I can work on it.\n\n416\n00:21:41.887 --> 00:21:45.530\nThey'll slap a thumb drive in there,\ncopy it over, and take it home.\n\n417\n00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:47.170\nWell the problem is,\nwe've done a lot as IT,\n\n418\n00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:49.945\nwe do a lot to keep that information\nsafe while it's on our network.\n\n419\n00:21:49.945 --> 00:21:54.049\nSo we've got access control, if you're not\nauthenticated you don't have rights to it,\n\n420\n00:21:54.049 --> 00:21:56.966\nyou can't even open it up,\nmaybe you can't make changes to it.\n\n421\n00:21:56.966 --> 00:21:59.990\nAnd we've got good control\nover those resources.\n\n422\n00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:03.130\nBut the moment you copy it to that\nthumb drive that's not encrypted and\n\n423\n00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:08.460\ntake it off of the network everything\nwe've done is moot at this point, right?\n\n424\n00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:12.195\nYou leave it in the back of a cab,\nyou drop it on the ground,\n\n425\n00:22:12.195 --> 00:22:16.256\nanybody can now pick that up and\nget access to the information.\n\n426\n00:22:16.256 --> 00:22:17.640\nIt's easy to steal data.\n\n427\n00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:22.547\nWe've heard all kinds of leaks here and\nthere.\n\n428\n00:22:22.547 --> 00:22:24.430\nHow are they getting this information out?\n\n429\n00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:26.810\nA lot of times it's with a thumb drive or\n\n430\n00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:30.590\na phone that I can just copy\ninformation over to and walk out.\n\n431\n00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:32.830\nAnd nobody's the wiser cuz they're so\nsmall and\n\n432\n00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:38.340\nthey can be disguised as pens and,\nwho knows what else?\n\n433\n00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:39.590\nMice, I mean...\n\n434\n00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:41.400\nEverything is a thumb drive now a days.\n\n435\n00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you think of the size\nof those micro SD cards and\n\n436\n00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.580\nhow much data they can hold now.\n\n437\n00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:46.480\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; If you were\n\n438\n00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.430\na whistleblower in 20 years ago you're\nwalking out with reams and reams of paper.\n\n439\n00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:52.490\nNow you're walking out with something\nyou can stick in your pen or\n\n440\n00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:53.330\nstick in your wallet.\n\n441\n00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:55.545\nAnd you're gonna get right\nby security on the way out.\n\n442\n00:22:55.545 --> 00:22:58.630\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so how do you\nprotect against this kinda stuff?\n\n443\n00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:00.750\nEspionage, and theft, and loss of these.\n\n444\n00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:02.140\nWell, It depends.\n\n445\n00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:03.230\nSome organizations,\n\n446\n00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:07.210\nvery high security organizations,\nlet's just say you can't use them at all.\n\n447\n00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:11.940\nWe will make policies that prevent\nthem from working on our network.\n\n448\n00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:16.512\nOr they might have sheepdip machines,\nwhere as you walk in or walk out,\n\n449\n00:23:16.512 --> 00:23:19.866\nevery bit of removable media\nhas to be examined, and\n\n450\n00:23:19.866 --> 00:23:25.147\nthey'll search your being and anything\nyou're carrying for that kind of thing.\n\n451\n00:23:25.147 --> 00:23:28.999\nI'll always remember Adam Gordon, I'm sure\nthat most of you nave seen him in some of\n\n452\n00:23:28.999 --> 00:23:32.320\nour other videos, went to\na particular military installation.\n\n453\n00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.210\nBrought his laptop with him, was going\nto be using it for a presentation and\n\n454\n00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:41.200\nthe gentleman at the gate said you can't\ntake that in, it has a USB port on there.\n\n455\n00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:41.968\nThose aren't allowed.\n\n456\n00:23:41.968 --> 00:23:44.860\nAnd he was like, well I have to\nhave my computer to do this,\n\n457\n00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.760\nI'm kind of stuck here, what do I do?\n\n458\n00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.340\nHe says, give me your laptop.\n\n459\n00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:52.273\nThe guy takes the laptop, grabs a tube\nof epoxy, [SOUND] right in that hole,\n\n460\n00:23:52.273 --> 00:23:56.346\nlet it dry, here's your laptop,\nyou're good to go, sir, have a nice day.\n\n461\n00:23:56.346 --> 00:23:59.714\n[LAUGH] You know,\nthat's one way to handle it, right,\n\n462\n00:23:59.714 --> 00:24:02.509\nmost organizations\nare not going to do that.\n\n463\n00:24:02.509 --> 00:24:05.026\nOn the same token,\nI've heard a lot of government places\n\n464\n00:24:05.026 --> 00:24:07.804\nwon't let you bring in a phone\nthat has a camera, for example,\n\n465\n00:24:07.804 --> 00:24:10.650\nbecause that's another way\nyou can get information out.\n\n466\n00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:11.779\nAnd so they've got,\n\n467\n00:24:11.779 --> 00:24:15.940\nthat's why there still exists some of\nthese phones that don't have cameras.\n\n468\n00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:19.779\n&gt;&gt; That don't have cameras, exactly,\nit's crazy to think that I was traveling\n\n469\n00:24:19.779 --> 00:24:23.674\nrecently and I got off the airplane, it\nwas one of these small airports where you\n\n470\n00:24:23.674 --> 00:24:27.422\nwalk down the steps onto the tarmac and\nthen have to walk over to the airport.\n\n471\n00:24:27.422 --> 00:24:29.475\nAnd I love airplanes and stuff,\nand so I turn around and\n\n472\n00:24:29.475 --> 00:24:32.570\nI take a picture of the plane, and I turn\naround and take a picture of the building.\n\n473\n00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:36.330\nAnd they're like no,\nthey come waving at me, no phones.\n\n474\n00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:38.973\nAnd they weren't too\nworried about outside,\n\n475\n00:24:38.973 --> 00:24:42.360\nbut once I got inside where\ncustoms was and stuff like that,\n\n476\n00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:46.780\nthere was big signs no phones,\nno pictures, because it's a security risk.\n\n477\n00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:50.314\nSo removal devices and drives, a lot\nof those can be encrypted nowadays so\n\n478\n00:24:50.314 --> 00:24:52.272\nwe can protect the data that's on them.\n\n479\n00:24:52.272 --> 00:24:55.006\nBut it's really more\nabout thinking whether,\n\n480\n00:24:55.006 --> 00:24:59.220\nit's a lot of work to make policies that\nprevent all of those and they're very,\n\n481\n00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:02.500\nvery useful when I need to move something\nfrom one computer or another, or\n\n482\n00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:05.280\ntake it home,\nthey're extremely convenient.\n\n483\n00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:08.350\nBut we have to weigh, right, we have to do\nour risk analysis that we talked about in\n\n484\n00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:14.580\na previous episode, and weigh the risks\nagainst the use and see what we wanna do.\n\n485\n00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:19.530\nMaybe we have company issued USB drives\nthat are allowed, all others are blocked.\n\n486\n00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:22.345\nBecause the company ones have\na thumbprint scanner on them, and\n\n487\n00:25:22.345 --> 00:25:26.650\nthey're more secure, right, so depending\non how your company wants to handle that.\n\n488\n00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:30.750\nMobile device security, again we've\nreally been talking about that for\n\n489\n00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:32.280\nthe last few minutes here.\n\n490\n00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:36.453\nI'll add things like docking stations,\nright, where a lot of our laptops\n\n491\n00:25:36.453 --> 00:25:40.841\nhave docking stations that we can plug\ninto, sometimes those can be secured.\n\n492\n00:25:40.841 --> 00:25:45.619\nLaptop security cables I mentioned,\nlaptop safes, the theft recovery software,\n\n493\n00:25:45.619 --> 00:25:48.210\nthe tracker stuff, I mentioned that.\n\n494\n00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:52.905\nLaptop alarms, right,\nthat has sent off that panic scream if\n\n495\n00:25:52.905 --> 00:25:56.800\nthey're logged into\nincorrectly too many times.\n\n496\n00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:01.657\nAnd the last thing I wanna talk about\nhere is something called key loggers, and\n\n497\n00:26:01.657 --> 00:26:06.525\na key logger is something that's gonna\nrecord your keystrokes on a computer.\n\n498\n00:26:06.525 --> 00:26:10.910\nWhether it's a mobile computer, or\na desktop, or a server, it doesn't matter,\n\n499\n00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:13.210\nthey're gonna record those keystrokes.\n\n500\n00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:17.333\nAnd these can be physical devices that\nwe plug in between the keyboard and\n\n501\n00:26:17.333 --> 00:26:18.220\nthe computer.\n\n502\n00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:22.710\nIf you look at the back of your computer\nyour keyboard most likely connects via\n\n503\n00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:27.710\nUSB, and so I unplug your keyboard,\nI plug this small device in,\n\n504\n00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:31.690\nabout that big, looks alike a very\nsmall thumb drive, basically.\n\n505\n00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:34.530\nIt plugs into the USB port in\nthe back of your computer, and\n\n506\n00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:37.910\nthen your keyboard plugs into the back\nof the device that I just plugged in.\n\n507\n00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:40.580\nSo it just sits,\nit makes your keyboard about that much\n\n508\n00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:44.410\nlonger on the back of your computer,\nmost people will never realize it's there.\n\n509\n00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:48.370\nAnd because it's before anything else,\nright, the keyboard goes through that\n\n510\n00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:52.900\ncable, all your keystrokes,\nit records everything, even your typos.\n\n511\n00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:57.840\nIf I type my name\nM-I-K-K-E-backspace-backspace-E,\n\n512\n00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:00.030\nright, you'll see all of that.\n\n513\n00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:02.560\nAll your usernames and\npasswords that you type in.\n\n514\n00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and that's the first\nthing the key logger's gonna get,\n\n515\n00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:08.050\nyou come back to your machine and it knows\nthe first thing you typed in is probably\n\n516\n00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:09.736\nyour username and/or your password.\n\n517\n00:27:09.736 --> 00:27:14.140\nAnd that's why you kind of stress the\nimportance of doing a visual check on your\n\n518\n00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:14.830\nworkstation.\n\n519\n00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:16.420\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nwhen is the last time you looked?\n\n520\n00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:19.190\nMost of us have our desktop\nis down under our desk or\n\n521\n00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:22.400\nsomewhere, big old dust bunnies\nthe size of hippos down there.\n\n522\n00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:26.780\nSo you never see the back of your\ncomputer, so you're never gonna notice\n\n523\n00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:29.510\nthat somebody plugged one of those in and\nit's capturing.\n\n524\n00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:31.800\nWhen all they gotta do is come\nin before everybody gets there,\n\n525\n00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.920\nslip that in, come back that afternoon or\nthe next morning take it back, and\n\n526\n00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.550\non that device is now\neverything they need.\n\n527\n00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:42.041\nAny place you've logged into, websites\nyou've logged into, as you were saying\n\n528\n00:27:42.041 --> 00:27:45.780\nlogging into the computer itself,\nthey're gonna have all of that captured.\n\n529\n00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:50.680\nNow that's for the physical ones and you\ncan get them for whatever type, whether\n\n530\n00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:56.560\nit's an old PS/2 port, or a USB port, we\ncan get the key stroke loggers for those.\n\n531\n00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:59.957\nSo visual inspection is really the only\nway to prevent something like that,\n\n532\n00:27:59.957 --> 00:28:01.231\nperiodically take a look and\n\n533\n00:28:01.231 --> 00:28:03.953\nsee if there's anything new\nsticking out of your computer.\n\n534\n00:28:03.953 --> 00:28:06.776\nBut there's also software\nbased keystroke loggers,\n\n535\n00:28:06.776 --> 00:28:09.169\nthese are applications\nthat I would install,\n\n536\n00:28:09.169 --> 00:28:12.867\nmaybe a little more challenging to\nget it installed in the first place.\n\n537\n00:28:12.867 --> 00:28:16.877\nBut I can try to get, the bad guys will\ntry to get you to click on something that\n\n538\n00:28:16.877 --> 00:28:18.756\nopens up a silly e-greeting card,\n\n539\n00:28:18.756 --> 00:28:21.595\nbut in the background it's\ninstalling a keylogger.\n\n540\n00:28:21.595 --> 00:28:24.901\nAnd it remains hidden, it doesn't\nmake an icon in the system tray,\n\n541\n00:28:24.901 --> 00:28:28.613\nit doesn't show up in your processes list,\nin Task Manager in Windows, for\n\n542\n00:28:28.613 --> 00:28:33.265\nexample, and it's doing the exact same\nthing, it's recording all your keystrokes.\n\n543\n00:28:33.265 --> 00:28:36.365\nAnd I'll tell you some of these are really\nimpressive, not only will they record\n\n544\n00:28:36.365 --> 00:28:41.670\nkeystrokes, every time you click it\nwill take a screenshot of your computer,\n\n545\n00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:44.460\nso I'll have the images of\neverything that you're clicking on.\n\n546\n00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:47.310\nI'll see what web page you're on\nas you're typing that password, so\n\n547\n00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:49.180\nit'll record your passwords, and\n\n548\n00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:53.560\nyour clicks, and several other scary\nstuff that these things can do.\n\n549\n00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:57.570\nAnd these, because they're software based,\nyou're not gonna notice it, all right,\n\n550\n00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:00.020\nsticking out of your computer,\nhopefully for the bad guy,\n\n551\n00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:02.380\nhopefully it doesn't show\nup in your system tray.\n\n552\n00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:06.360\nAnd it can be used in your own\nnetwork connection to FTP or\n\n553\n00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:10.480\nsend these, all this information and\nthis logging,\n\n554\n00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:15.250\nback to the to bad guy's bat cave or\nwhatever he's sitting in.\n\n555\n00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:18.930\nSo you're just none the wiser as your\nkeystrokes, everything you're typing,\n\n556\n00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:23.440\nthat memo that talks about corporate\nconfidential information that\n\n557\n00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:28.090\nyou're typing up, is now recorded and\nbeing sent over there to the bad guys.\n\n558\n00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:30.885\nSo keyloggers,\nanother big part of physical security,\n\n559\n00:29:30.885 --> 00:29:34.322\nespecially the physical ones,\nI did wanna mention the fact that there\n\n560\n00:29:34.322 --> 00:29:38.128\nare software based, that really doesn't\nfall into the physical security.\n\n561\n00:29:38.128 --> 00:29:42.227\nBut that software based applications will\nwork with your wireless keyboards and\n\n562\n00:29:42.227 --> 00:29:44.999\nyour Bluetooth keyboards,\nright, I say wireless and\n\n563\n00:29:44.999 --> 00:29:47.845\nBluetooth like they're different,\nbut any of those.\n\n564\n00:29:47.845 --> 00:29:52.483\nYou're thinking I don't use a keyboard\nthat plugs in so I'm safe from that,\n\n565\n00:29:52.483 --> 00:29:55.777\nwell, not if they're using\na software based keylogger,\n\n566\n00:29:55.777 --> 00:29:58.610\nit's gonna capture them just the same.\n\n567\n00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:03.040\nI've seen keyboards that have\nbuilt-in keystroke loggers on them,\n\n568\n00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:08.570\nit's not too difficult to fabricate one,\neven, with a little adapter.\n\n569\n00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:13.880\nSo do a physical check of your machine now\nand again, just to help keep you safe.\n\n570\n00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:17.318\nSo in the end, a lot of information\nthere about physical security.\n\n571\n00:30:17.318 --> 00:30:22.850\nAgain, we wanna stress the fact that\nphysical security trumps everything else,\n\n572\n00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:24.750\nif you don't have good physical security,\n\n573\n00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:27.530\nthe rest of your controls\nare gonna be weakened.\n\n574\n00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:30.070\nBecause once the bad guy can get in and\n\n575\n00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:33.265\nget physical access to something\nit's very, very hard to stop them.\n\n576\n00:30:33.265 --> 00:30:34.400\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds good Mike.\n\n577\n00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:38.020\nI appreciate that you've kind of covered\nwalking up to the building, getting into\n\n578\n00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:41.430\nthe building, and then even our individual\nworkstations and things like that.\n\n579\n00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:44.953\nSo that's a great place to stop and\nluckily I need that time to take a full\n\n580\n00:30:44.953 --> 00:30:48.008\nlook at my computer now and\nmake sure that everything is safe,\n\n581\n00:30:48.008 --> 00:30:50.769\ncuz I've been sitting close to you for\nquite some time,\n\n582\n00:30:50.769 --> 00:30:53.353\nbut ready to go ahead [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I have to practice this stuff\n\n583\n00:30:53.353 --> 00:30:54.290\nsomewhere, right?\n\n584\n00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:55.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm the guinea pig,\nthat's fine by me.\n\n585\n00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.141\nBut we are gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this episode,\n\n586\n00:30:58.141 --> 00:31:00.140\nI've been your host Peter Van Rysdam.\n\n587\n00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:01.260\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n588\n00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:01.773\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n589\n00:31:01.773 --> 00:31:09.960\n[MUSIC]\n\n590\n00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:10.923\nThank you for watching

Francisco,\nCalifornia.\n\n3\n00:00:06.567 --> 00:00:08.198\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.198 --> 00:00:12.508\nYou're watching ITPROTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.508 --> 00:00:14.587\n&gt;&gt; Hey everybody and welcome to ITPROTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.587 --> 00:00:16.306\nI'm your host Peter VanRysdam and\n\n7\n00:00:16.306 --> 00:00:20.230\ntoday we're continuing with our\nMTA security fundamentals course.\n\n8\n00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.420\nAnd specifically in this episode we're\ngonna talk about internet security,\n\n9\n00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.040\nwhich It's like a pretty\nimportant topic so\n\n10\n00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.770\nhere to help us with that is a man who\nhas downloaded all of the viruses so\n\n11\n00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.370\nhe knows exactly what to do with them,\nMr. Mike Roderick.\n\n12\n00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:33.310\nMike, how are you doing?\n\n13\n00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.890\n&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm just overloaded\nwith viruses at this point.\n\n14\n00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.410\nNo, yeah we are going to be\ntalking about internet security,\n\n15\n00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.150\nbut not,\nthe titles a little misleading, right?\n\n16\n00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.730\nIt's a Microsoft thing.\n\n17\n00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.090\nWhen they talk about internet security\nwhat they're really talking back\n\n18\n00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.840\nis browser security, and taking a look\nat your settings in your browser.\n\n19\n00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.486\nAnd, of course,\nwe're talking about Internet Explorer,\n\n20\n00:00:54.486 --> 00:00:57.211\nMicrosoft's favorite old school browser.\n\n21\n00:00:57.211 --> 00:01:04.089\nCuz keep in mind, this exam is really\nbased around Server 2008, 2008 R2.\n\n22\n00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.262\nThey have updated it to\ninclude Windows 10, but\n\n23\n00:01:07.262 --> 00:01:11.430\nwhen it was originally written,\nit was Windows 7 at that point.\n\n24\n00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.370\nSo we still had good old IE as\nwe know it from days gone by.\n\n25\n00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.630\nNot so much Edge.\n\n26\n00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.600\nAlthough I will through Edge in there\njust to show you a couple things or\n\n27\n00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.690\nthe lack of a couple things in Edge,\nbecause they do\n\n28\n00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.950\nsay they've updated their objectives\nto include a little bit of Windows 10.\n\n29\n00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.050\nSo let's start out.\n\n30\n00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.930\nWe've talked about browser\nsecurity settings.\n\n31\n00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.880\nObviously, our browser, our web browser,\nwhatever browser you choose, whether\n\n32\n00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.400\nthat's Microsoft Internet Explorer,\nwhich we'll be discussing for the exam.\n\n33\n00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.230\nBut you might be using other\nbrowsers- Chrome, Firefox,\n\n34\n00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.790\nMozilla, Safari, Opera- the list goes on.\n\n35\n00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.850\nThere's plenty to choose from.\n\n36\n00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.120\nMost of them will have very similar\noptions located in different places maybe,\n\n37\n00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.870\nslightly different-looking\nfield to how you adjust them.\n\n38\n00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.160\nBut most of them have\nthe same basic settings.\n\n39\n00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.410\nBecause when we use our browser,\nto connect to the Internet,\n\n40\n00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.080\nthe World Wide Web, right, to get out\nthere and connect to everybody else, and\n\n41\n00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.940\nto shop, and to read, and\nto see what's going on in the world, and\n\n42\n00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.020\nto laugh at silly cats and\nwhatever they do on their videos.\n\n43\n00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.220\nSo yeah, we're connecting to\npotentially untrusted locations, right?\n\n44\n00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.780\nWho knows what's out there?\n\n45\n00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.470\nWe try to stay safe, but\nyou never know what's going on.\n\n46\n00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.670\nSo our browser has settings in\nthere that can help keep us safe,\n\n47\n00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.990\ntry to protect us from the bad guys,\n\n48\n00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.740\nthe malicious people out there on\nthe Internet that want to do us harm.\n\n49\n00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.420\nBecause the browser's\nthe way into our system.\n\n50\n00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.760\nThat's what being exposed,\nthat's what going out and\n\n51\n00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.610\npulling information from the web and\ndisplaying it on my computer.\n\n52\n00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.140\nSo if the bad guy comes around slip stuff\nin there then he might be able to get some\n\n53\n00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.900\nstuff onto my machine and who knows\nwhat he wants to do from there or\n\n54\n00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.400\nshe wants to do from there.\n\n55\n00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.790\nSo, We're just gonna we're keeping it very\nsimple, very basic, this is our MTA exam.\n\n56\n00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.390\nSo we're gonna talk about cookies, pop\nups, I'm gonna talk about security zones\n\n57\n00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.900\nas well because that's how internet\nexplorer handled security and\n\n58\n00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.675\nwe'll talk about and\nsecure websites in general, some phishing,\n\n59\n00:03:15.675 --> 00:03:19.105\nsome farming, so some terminology there.\n\n60\n00:03:19.105 --> 00:03:21.055\nSo let's start with cookies, right,\n\n61\n00:03:21.055 --> 00:03:24.475\nit's always a good place to start,\ncan't go wrong with that.\n\n62\n00:03:24.475 --> 00:03:29.105\nOne of my favorite, single pane cartoons\nhas the Cookie Monster sitting in\n\n63\n00:03:29.105 --> 00:03:33.975\nfront of a computer and he's got this\nexacerbated look on his face and\n\n64\n00:03:33.975 --> 00:03:36.347\nin his little thought bubble\nit says delete cookies.\n\n65\n00:03:36.347 --> 00:03:38.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I always thought that was funny,\n\n66\n00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.990\nso I'd thought I'd share that with you.\n\n67\n00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.660\nWe talk about cookies we are not talking\nabout chocolate chip or peanut butter or\n\n68\n00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.830\nanything like that.\n\n69\n00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.690\nWe are talking about electronic cookies.\n\n70\n00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.760\nThese are just little text\nfiles that can store data.\n\n71\n00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.100\nThe websites can store data about us and\nour session with that website.\n\n72\n00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.690\nThey store it on our computer.\n\n73\n00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.840\nIf you ever go to a website and it says\nwelcome back Mike, there's new books in\n\n74\n00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.010\nthis category that you'd love or\nyour shopping list is still there.\n\n75\n00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.521\nA lot of that is because they\nhave cookies on our machine.\n\n76\n00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:11.973\nAnd we're not gonna go into\npersistent cookies and\n\n77\n00:04:11.973 --> 00:04:15.062\nsession cookies because there\nare different types of cookies.\n\n78\n00:04:15.062 --> 00:04:19.754\nWe just want to talk about them in general\nand understand that a cookie, is a file,\n\n79\n00:04:19.754 --> 00:04:23.630\nthat website can place on my computer and\nit can store information,\n\n80\n00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.438\nand that information that it stores\ncan vary from just a user name,\n\n81\n00:04:27.438 --> 00:04:31.180\nto include password information,\nor credit card information.\n\n82\n00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.370\nIt's really up to the vendor or\nthe website.\n\n83\n00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.920\nThey're deciding what information\nto put in that cookie\n\n84\n00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.610\nthat they store in your computer.\n\n85\n00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.330\nAnd the idea is it can help\nspeed up the browsing process.\n\n86\n00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.390\nIt can make it more personal,\ncuz when you go back to that site\n\n87\n00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.080\nthey know who you are,\nthey know what you visited last.\n\n88\n00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.220\nIt can also help track you as you\ngo from one site to another, but\n\n89\n00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.700\nthat's a whole nother story.\n\n90\n00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.920\nSo the cookies can be bad but\nthey're not a bad thing.\n\n91\n00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.790\nI think some people hear that term\nthey think cookie, those are bad.\n\n92\n00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.220\nYou can block them, but\na lot of sites require cookies\n\n93\n00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.290\nto be able to track your session as\nyou go from one page to the other.\n\n94\n00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.310\nIf you go back and it starts at\nthe top of the page, or does it start\n\n95\n00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.070\nhalfway scrolled down the page,\nwhere you were when you clicked forward.\n\n96\n00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.970\nA lot of that can be done through cookies.\n\n97\n00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.720\nSo, they can be very beneficial.\n\n98\n00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.180\nBut, just like anything else,\nthey can be used for malicious purposes.\n\n99\n00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.180\nBare minimum,\nsomebody could try to steal your cookie.\n\n100\n00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.020\nAnd we hate people to take our cookies,\nright?\n\n101\n00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.620\nThey could steal those and\nthen get information out of them.\n\n102\n00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.920\nAre they encrypted?\n\n103\n00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.830\nIs that website storing your file\nencrypted, or is it plain text?\n\n104\n00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.640\nIf it's plain text, they can just read\nthe information right out of there,\n\n105\n00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.560\nwhatever they've chosen\nto store about you.\n\n106\n00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.270\nIf it's encrypted,\n\n107\n00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.460\nthey might have a little more\ndifficulty reading the information.\n\n108\n00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.160\nBut do they have to read it?\n\n109\n00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.260\nWhat if they just try to\ngo to the website and\n\n110\n00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.270\npresent the cookie,\npretend they're you, right?\n\n111\n00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.738\nOr jump in the middle of\none of your sessions.\n\n112\n00:05:58.738 --> 00:06:01.370\nYou're already established in\na session with that server, and\n\n113\n00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.400\nthey're just knock you out of the way and\nstep in your place, and become you, and\n\n114\n00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.850\nmaybe finish shopping for you, and\nchange your shipping address, you know?\n\n115\n00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.910\nWhatever the case may be.\n\n116\n00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.770\nSo, you know, cookies are good,\nbut they can be used maliciously.\n\n117\n00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.650\nSo how do we control them?\n\n118\n00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.900\nWell in our browser we can typically\nblock cookies and we can choose to block\n\n119\n00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.560\nfirst party cookies,\nthird party cookies, or all cookies.\n\n120\n00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.790\nBut as I said, some sites require cookies.\n\n121\n00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:27.700\nThe site won't function.\n\n122\n00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.140\nI remember one,\nI don't know if it's still the case, but\n\n123\n00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.200\nHotmail was one that just would\nnot work without cookies.\n\n124\n00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.080\nI don't know that that's the case anymore,\nthat was years ago.\n\n125\n00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.290\nBut some sites do require them, and\nthey'll usually put up a banner that says,\n\n126\n00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:45.530\nhey, this site uses cookies to make your\nbrowsing experience more pleasurable,\n\n127\n00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.320\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n128\n00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I think there's a lot\nof regulations by country, as well.\n\n129\n00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.860\nI'll see.\n\n130\n00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.070\nAnytime I go to a site that\nis from the United Kingdom,\n\n131\n00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.350\nthere will be some specific warnings\nright at the top or pop ups.\n\n132\n00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.070\nSo, I think it varies by\ncountry as far as how\n\n133\n00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.170\nmuch they need to tell you\nabout what they're doing.\n\n134\n00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.780\nSo we have to kind of rely on our\nbrowser to tell us a little bit about\n\n135\n00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:06.940\nwhat's going on behind the scenes.\n\n136\n00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:07.770\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n137\n00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.560\nSo let's make sure we were clear with,\nwe have first party versus third party.\n\n138\n00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.250\nIf I go to, I don't know, Chevrolet.com.\n\n139\n00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.920\nAnd Chevrolet wants to put\na cookie on my computer.\n\n140\n00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.310\nWell, that's a first party cookie.\n\n141\n00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.980\nI intentionally went to their website.\n\n142\n00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:27.030\nI'm dealing,\nI understand I want to go to Chevy.\n\n143\n00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.860\nSo we're having a conversation,\nif you will, between my computer and\n\n144\n00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:30.860\ntheir servers.\n\n145\n00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.030\nSo that's a first party cookie.\n\n146\n00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.400\nBut on that Chevrolet website,\nthere's a banner ad for\n\n147\n00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.440\nFirestone tires because they\nhave some kind of partnership.\n\n148\n00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.510\nAnd Firestone wants to put\na cookie on my computer.\n\n149\n00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.400\nI have no control over that.\n\n150\n00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.730\nI didn't choose to go to Firestone.\n\n151\n00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:47.415\nI might have a big dislike for Firestone.\n\n152\n00:07:47.415 --> 00:07:50.063\nI don't Firestone,\nI think you have great tires.\n\n153\n00:07:50.063 --> 00:07:54.503\nBut that would be considered a third party\ncookie because it's not who I'm directly\n\n154\n00:07:54.503 --> 00:07:58.394\ndealing with it's only there because\nChevrolet chose to deal with them.\n\n155\n00:07:58.394 --> 00:08:00.438\nSo that's the difference between.\n\n156\n00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:01.181\nSo when you go and\n\n157\n00:08:01.181 --> 00:08:04.266\nlook at your settings it says You\nwanna block third party cookies, or\n\n158\n00:08:04.266 --> 00:08:08.610\ndo you wanna block first party cookies,\nnow you know what they're talking about.\n\n159\n00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:13.310\nRight, cuz I might need it to visit\nChevrolet, so I can build my car out.\n\n160\n00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.180\nBut I don't want the third\nparty cookies on there.\n\n161\n00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.272\nSo I'll allow first party,\nblock third party.\n\n162\n00:08:18.272 --> 00:08:20.480\nAll right, let's take a look\nat where we can set these.\n\n163\n00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:24.250\nI'll start off with our good old IE or\nInternet Explorer.\n\n164\n00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:30.988\nI'll show you guys I'm running Internet\nExplorer 11 here on my Windows 10 device.\n\n165\n00:08:30.988 --> 00:08:35.570\nAnd I'm gonna go to my little gear\nicon in that upper right hand corner,\n\n166\n00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:36.870\nand my zoom in is not running.\n\n167\n00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.610\nLet's see if I can get\nthat going real fast.\n\n168\n00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.276\nSo I can zoom in to some of this.\n\n169\n00:08:44.112 --> 00:08:49.321\nAnd evidently, I'm gonna install it\nreal fast in front of your eyes here.\n\n170\n00:08:49.321 --> 00:08:55.400\nShould be good, okay, and\nlike that, we have zoom action.\n\n171\n00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.431\nSo that little gear icon, right up there\nnext to that smiley face, all right,\n\n172\n00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:03.710\nis my settings for this particular\nversion of Internet Explorer.\n\n173\n00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.900\nAnd I'm gonna go to my Internet options,\nand in here,\n\n174\n00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.715\nwhen we're dealing with cookies, we're\ngonna be looking in a couple of places,\n\n175\n00:09:09.715 --> 00:09:16.190\nbut primarily on this Privacy tab and\non my Security tab, all right?\n\n176\n00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:23.240\nMy Privacy tab has this little settings\noption here, let me zoom in to that.\n\n177\n00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:27.200\nSo I've got settings and\nI can click on Sites, and\n\n178\n00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.970\nhere, I can see Per Site Privacy Actions.\n\n179\n00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:35.242\nYou could specify which websites are\nalways or never allowed to use cookies,\n\n180\n00:09:35.242 --> 00:09:37.358\nregardless of their privacy policy.\n\n181\n00:09:37.358 --> 00:09:40.331\nI don't care what they say cuz\na lot of these companies will,\n\n182\n00:09:40.331 --> 00:09:44.003\nif they have an electronic privacy policy,\nyour computer can read it, and\n\n183\n00:09:44.003 --> 00:09:45.440\nit can accept the cookie.\n\n184\n00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.580\nHere, I'm saying I don't care.\n\n185\n00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:51.730\nI'm gonna say always\nallow from hotmail.com.\n\n186\n00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:56.250\nAlways block from xyz.com, all right.\n\n187\n00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:00.910\nSo you would add the domain right here\nwhere it says address of website, and\n\n188\n00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:02.610\nthen click either Block or Allow.\n\n189\n00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:05.640\nI'm gonna zoom back out, and\nI'll show you what I mean.\n\n190\n00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.248\nI could do something like *.microsoft.com,\n\n191\n00:10:09.248 --> 00:10:14.260\n* being anything.microsoft.com,\nI'm gonna allow.\n\n192\n00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:18.237\nAll right, and\nI could also come in here and\n\n193\n00:10:18.237 --> 00:10:23.997\nsay anything *., I don't know,\ntest.com, I can block.\n\n194\n00:10:23.997 --> 00:10:27.168\nAnd so now anything from\nthat site will be blocked,\n\n195\n00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:30.135\nno matter what their\nprivacy policy might say.\n\n196\n00:10:30.135 --> 00:10:33.332\nWell, I'm gonna remove all those,\nso I'm gonna goof up my machine for\n\n197\n00:10:33.332 --> 00:10:35.110\nthe future shows, and I'll click OK.\n\n198\n00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:41.776\nI can also do an advanced option, and here\nI can choose how cookies are handled as\n\n199\n00:10:41.776 --> 00:10:47.735\nfar as first party cookies versus third\nparty cookies, Accept, Block, or Prompt.\n\n200\n00:10:47.735 --> 00:10:50.195\nAccept will just allow\nthe cookie in the background,\n\n201\n00:10:50.195 --> 00:10:51.733\nBlock would obviously block it.\n\n202\n00:10:51.733 --> 00:10:55.150\nPrompt would ask me each time,\nhey, do you wanna allow cookies?\n\n203\n00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:57.880\nAnd you can see,\nAlways allow session cookies.\n\n204\n00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.480\nSession cookies typically don't store\n\n205\n00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.440\nas much as the other cookies\nwe're talking about.\n\n206\n00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:08.290\nThey're more for, I've connected\nto Amazon, I've scrolled halfway\n\n207\n00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:11.860\ndown this page, I clicked on a link,\nit took me to another page.\n\n208\n00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:15.270\nWhen I click my Back button,\nit's still scrolled halfway down,\n\n209\n00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:17.270\nit remembers where I was on the page.\n\n210\n00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:20.350\nRemembers things I've added to my cart,\nthings like that,\n\n211\n00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:22.410\nthose are what they mean\nby session cookies.\n\n212\n00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.840\nAnd those are typically good, but\nwe might wanna block those as well.\n\n213\n00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.802\nIn a high security environment,\nwe might not have a need for\n\n214\n00:11:28.802 --> 00:11:30.708\nthe session cookies either, right?\n\n215\n00:11:30.708 --> 00:11:34.860\nNow we can also take\na look on our General tab.\n\n216\n00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.040\nThis is where I can get rid of cookies.\n\n217\n00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.370\nDown towards the bottom of that window,\nyou'll see browsing history,\n\n218\n00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:44.550\nwhere I can delete files and cookies and\npasswords and things like that.\n\n219\n00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:50.780\nAnd if I click on Delete, I'll see\nthe option to do cookies and website data.\n\n220\n00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:52.716\nSo I could uncheck everything,\nexcept for cookies, or\n\n221\n00:11:52.716 --> 00:11:54.952\nI could leave everything checked,\nwhatever I was trying to do.\n\n222\n00:11:54.952 --> 00:11:58.110\nThe point is this is where I\nwould go to remove cookies.\n\n223\n00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:04.420\nI will tell you that I love that option at\nthe top, Preserve Favorites website data.\n\n224\n00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:08.440\nBecause I'm sure most of you are like me,\nseveral times I've gone and\n\n225\n00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.029\njust cleared out my cookies.\n\n226\n00:12:10.029 --> 00:12:14.950\nAnd then you go back to your bank\naccount and go, I gotta remember all\n\n227\n00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:19.410\nthe secret question, because now it\ndoesn't recognize my computer anymore.\n\n228\n00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.478\nIt says hey,\nyou're visiting from a new computer,\n\n229\n00:12:21.478 --> 00:12:24.075\nlet's do our extra validation and\nmake sure it's actually you.\n\n230\n00:12:24.075 --> 00:12:27.502\nWhich is a good thing, but it can be\nfrustrating sometimes because you forget\n\n231\n00:12:27.502 --> 00:12:29.570\nyou've wiped out all those cookies.\n\n232\n00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:31.890\nSo if you have a favorites for\nit in your bookmarks,\n\n233\n00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:36.670\nit will leave those cookies alone,\nwhich is kind of nice, right?\n\n234\n00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.145\nSo those are our cookies.\n\n235\n00:12:40.145 --> 00:12:41.488\nWell, actually, let me do one more thing.\n\n236\n00:12:41.488 --> 00:12:44.020\nWe're gonna come back and\nlook at these zones,\n\n237\n00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:48.120\nbut within these zone settings,\nthere's also some cookie settings.\n\n238\n00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.600\nSo don't think I've skipped this or forgot\nabout it, we'll definitely come back and\n\n239\n00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.350\nlook here as soon as we\nget to that portion.\n\n240\n00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:58.930\nBut the next thing I want to do\nis talk a little bit about good\n\n241\n00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:02.344\nold pop-ups, all right?\n\n242\n00:13:02.344 --> 00:13:07.063\nAnd pop-ups are those annoying little\nwindows that you go to a webpage, and\n\n243\n00:13:07.063 --> 00:13:10.099\nyou get a little window\nthat opens up on top of it.\n\n244\n00:13:10.099 --> 00:13:15.030\nAnd it's usually an ad for something,\nor a survey, or who knows what?\n\n245\n00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:19.010\nThat's considered a pop-up, and\nmost browsers have a pop-up blocker\n\n246\n00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:22.540\nbuilt into it, as you can see,\nInternet Explorer 11, no different.\n\n247\n00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.850\nI have turned on pop-up\nblocker configured, and\n\n248\n00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:31.380\nI can go to my settings and\nI can allow sites, all right?\n\n249\n00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.141\nThe default level here is\nblock most automatic pop-ups,\n\n250\n00:13:34.141 --> 00:13:36.010\nyou'll still see some of them show up.\n\n251\n00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:38.902\nSo you might wanna come in here,\nand let me zoom out and\n\n252\n00:13:38.902 --> 00:13:42.969\nzoom back in, so I can click, you see\nI can block all pop-ups, all right?\n\n253\n00:13:42.969 --> 00:13:46.161\nYou can do a Ctrl+Alt to\nallow a particular site,\n\n254\n00:13:46.161 --> 00:13:50.267\nor you can allow pop-ups from\nany site that's at least secure.\n\n255\n00:13:50.267 --> 00:13:54.410\nAnd do you want a notification\nwhen a pop-up is blocked?\n\n256\n00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:57.330\nAnd then I can add sites,\nlike I said, some sites require them.\n\n257\n00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.393\nI remember a while ago,\nI don't think it's the case anymore, but\n\n258\n00:14:00.393 --> 00:14:02.925\nI think it was NewEgg,\nwhere you would go to a product.\n\n259\n00:14:02.925 --> 00:14:06.019\nAnd if you wanted to click and get more\ninformation or open up a zoomed in\n\n260\n00:14:06.019 --> 00:14:10.014\npicture, well, that picture opened up in a\npop-up window, and that would get blocked.\n\n261\n00:14:10.014 --> 00:14:12.510\nAnd it would make the site\nseem like it wasn't working.\n\n262\n00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:16.710\nSo I went and made an exception,\nI said always allow newegg.com.\n\n263\n00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:19.720\nI trust them, and\nI'll them to throw those pop-ups.\n\n264\n00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.568\nBut everybody else tried to block them.\n\n265\n00:14:21.568 --> 00:14:25.600\n&gt;&gt; And I know pop unders are a big\nthing as well that are really annoying.\n\n266\n00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.160\nDoes that kinda treat those the same way?\n\n267\n00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.100\n&gt;&gt; No, unfortunately,\nthat's the bad guys or\n\n268\n00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:35.210\nthe advertiser people getting a little\nsmarter and popping it under.\n\n269\n00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:36.910\nSometimes it does, and\nsometimes it doesn't.\n\n270\n00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:38.940\nThere's really no rhyme or reason to it.\n\n271\n00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:43.954\nI've seen some pop-ups that come up\non top that it does not block either.\n\n272\n00:14:43.954 --> 00:14:47.139\nAnd I'm not an HTML guy,\nI don't know if it's an iframe or\n\n273\n00:14:47.139 --> 00:14:49.030\nwhatever all that lingo they use.\n\n274\n00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:53.814\nBut there are ways that they figured out\nto get around some of these pop-up blocker\n\n275\n00:14:53.814 --> 00:14:57.160\nsettings unfortunately, and\npop under was one of them.\n\n276\n00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.530\nAll right, so that's the pop-up blocker.\n\n277\n00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:01.020\nWhat else can we take a look at here?\n\n278\n00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:05.770\nSo that's IE, and then let's go and look\nat the zones while we're here as well.\n\n279\n00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:10.531\nSo, I'm gonna go back into those settings,\nsorry about that, and\n\n280\n00:15:10.531 --> 00:15:12.970\nI'm gonna go to the Security tab.\n\n281\n00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:16.304\nAnd I'll zoom in here a little bit,\nand the way IE handled or\n\n282\n00:15:16.304 --> 00:15:20.698\nstill handles security is it divides\neverything up into four zones.\n\n283\n00:15:20.698 --> 00:15:25.180\nYou've got your Internet, your local\nintranet, your trusted sites, and\n\n284\n00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.360\nyour restricted sites, all right?\n\n285\n00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.070\nThe local intranet, and\nI'm gonna go ahead and click on it here.\n\n286\n00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:35.240\nAnd you'll notice as I click on it, the\nslider and information down here changes.\n\n287\n00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:40.170\nSo I can control the security different\nfor each one of these four categories.\n\n288\n00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:43.970\nThe local intranet, these are website\nthat are found on your company's network.\n\n289\n00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:45.890\nIn other words,\nyou didn't have to go through the proxy,\n\n290\n00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:48.360\nor you didn't have to go out\nto the Internet to get them.\n\n291\n00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:52.813\nThey're company hosted, maybe\nan internal company picnic calendar, or\n\n292\n00:15:52.813 --> 00:15:56.144\nyour schedule, or a blog, or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n293\n00:15:56.144 --> 00:15:59.564\nThese will be websites internal to\nyour organization, and typically,\n\n294\n00:15:59.564 --> 00:16:01.694\nwe can trust our own\ninternal organization So\n\n295\n00:16:01.694 --> 00:16:05.410\nyou can see the default here is actually\nset to custom, let me reset it for you.\n\n296\n00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:08.930\nThe default is medium low,\nwhich is appropriate for\n\n297\n00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:13.170\nmost internal sites,\nallows things like a Active X controls,\n\n298\n00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:17.040\nif they're unsigned they\nwon't be down loaded.\n\n299\n00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.590\nMost content will run\nwithout prompting you.\n\n300\n00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:23.480\nIf there's like things that move and\nbuttons that you can click on, that stuff\n\n301\n00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:28.200\nwill be allowed, because it's pretty\nsafe to say it's trusted, all right?\n\n302\n00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.920\nAnd that is the default medium low.\n\n303\n00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:34.030\nBut each one of these I\ncan change the slider for.\n\n304\n00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:39.770\nYou'll see as I slide it all the way up\nfrom high all the way down to low and\n\n305\n00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:42.310\nI can pick any one in between.\n\n306\n00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:42.940\nAnd you'll read,\n\n307\n00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.330\nyou should read the descriptions\nwhen you're making your decision.\n\n308\n00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:47.100\nIt kinda tells you what it's gonna do.\n\n309\n00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.570\nYou can always go in and\nfully customize it.\n\n310\n00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:52.880\nIf the slider doesn't give me enough\ncontrol I wanna be somewhere between\n\n311\n00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.660\nmedium and medium-low.\n\n312\n00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:59.021\nI can click custom level and I can go\nthrough each individual option and\n\n313\n00:16:59.021 --> 00:17:02.060\ndecide whether I wanna allow, disable, or\n\n314\n00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:06.180\nhave it prompt me before it does it,\nall right?\n\n315\n00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:11.560\n&gt;&gt; All right so, Mike, that let's\nyou control by intranet or Internet.\n\n316\n00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.970\nIs there also a way though to say I want\nthat higher security on the Internet, but\n\n317\n00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:21.190\nexcept for these specific sites that maybe\nI have a portal I need to log in to and\n\n318\n00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:22.450\nI know it's running on ActiveX.\n\n319\n00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:25.180\nI know there's different things on there\nthat I'm gonna deal with those pop\n\n320\n00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:25.720\nups each time.\n\n321\n00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.780\nOr the notifications each time.\n\n322\n00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:30.540\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and that's really\nwhat the trusted sites are for.\n\n323\n00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:33.520\nThese are for sites that\nare outside of your organization.\n\n324\n00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.660\nSo you are going out to the Internet\ntypically to get to them.\n\n325\n00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.810\nThey might be as you\nsaid business partners.\n\n326\n00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:41.760\nIt might be my banking site that I go to,\nor what have you.\n\n327\n00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:45.510\nBut it's a site that I know needs that\nfunctionality as you were saying.\n\n328\n00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:49.050\nSome kind of active content or cookies\nthat are gonna be put on my machine.\n\n329\n00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:53.970\nIt needs that to work, but\nit's not one of my internal sites.\n\n330\n00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:58.640\nSo I can go to my trusted sites and\nI have the same slider control and\n\n331\n00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.920\nhave the same custom Level.\n\n332\n00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:04.540\nNotice the default is medium, a little bit\nmore secured than a local intranet but\n\n333\n00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:05.530\nnot much.\n\n334\n00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:07.510\nAnd I have a sites button.\n\n335\n00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:09.060\nAnd this is where I go to add sites.\n\n336\n00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.270\nSo sites don't show up here automatically.\n\n337\n00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:14.700\nYou have to actually add\nthem to your trusted sites.\n\n338\n00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.650\nSo if you keep going to the site as\nPeter was saying, every time I go\n\n339\n00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:21.430\nthere I've gotta say yes to this, and\nyes to that ,just to get it to work.\n\n340\n00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:22.790\nAdd it to your trusted sites.\n\n341\n00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:26.660\nYour organization might populate this\nlist using policies within your company's\n\n342\n00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:27.930\nnetwork as well.\n\n343\n00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:30.590\nThey're might be external partners,\nthat they know.\n\n344\n00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:34.200\nMost of their employees have to go to and\nso they've added in their trusted sites.\n\n345\n00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:38.350\nSo you might find sites in\nhere that you didn't add.\n\n346\n00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:41.140\nAsk somebody, nothing wrong with\nsaying is this supposed to,\n\n347\n00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:44.620\nwho is this Mary May financial and\nis that supposed to be in there?\n\n348\n00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:46.420\nNothing wrong with asking.\n\n349\n00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.720\nThey're not gonna think your silly or\nstupid for asking those questions, and\n\n350\n00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.150\nit might be somebody that maliciously\nadded that to your computer.\n\n351\n00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:54.329\nSo double check, call of your help desk.\n\n352\n00:18:54.329 --> 00:18:57.110\nSay hey, do we have sites added\nto our trusted sites cuz I\n\n353\n00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:59.020\ndon't remember adding this one?\n\n354\n00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:02.120\n&gt;&gt; And\nif they have updated it remotely for\n\n355\n00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:04.820\nyou, are you able to still\nadd your own sites as well?\n\n356\n00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:05.450\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay and\n\n357\n00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:08.890\nthat won't go away when they\nmake a change to the sites?\n\n358\n00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:11.870\n&gt;&gt; I believe they do have that option,\nbut typically not.\n\n359\n00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:14.610\nUsually they'll let you\nput your own in there.\n\n360\n00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:20.170\nAll right, let me zoom back out,\nfor the trusted sites.\n\n361\n00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:22.180\nThen we also have our restricted sites,\n\n362\n00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.090\nand you can probably\nguess what this is for.\n\n363\n00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:29.450\nBut I will tell you there is\na common misconception here.\n\n364\n00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:32.870\nRestricted sites are sites that\nyou know cause harm, and so\n\n365\n00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:36.730\nyou do not want that site to\nbe running on your machine.\n\n366\n00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:41.010\nRestricted sites does not prevent\nyou from going to the site.\n\n367\n00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:44.610\nWhat it will do is lock it down,\nso that when you do go to the site\n\n368\n00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:50.010\nno active content is allowed, no buttons\nwill work, no links will work, shouldn't.\n\n369\n00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:53.140\nNo cookies will be allowed or\naccepted from that site.\n\n370\n00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.360\nIt really tried to prevent\nthe site from doing anything.\n\n371\n00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:59.030\nYou shouldn't be going there in the first\nplace if you know it's a bad site, but\n\n372\n00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:00.370\nby adding it here.\n\n373\n00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:02.050\nI can at least try to\nkeep my computer safe.\n\n374\n00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:05.630\nAnd another one that the organization\nmight do for you, they're hoping you never\n\n375\n00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:09.890\ngo there but if you do, they've already\nadded it to your restricted sites and\n\n376\n00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:12.020\nhopefully it will keep your computer safe.\n\n377\n00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:15.910\nSome functionality there, you go to\nthe sites and you would add them in here.\n\n378\n00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:19.270\nClick the little Add button and\nthat create your list.\n\n379\n00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:21.520\nYou've see by default it is set to High.\n\n380\n00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.277\nI still have my custom\nlevel that I can do.\n\n381\n00:20:23.277 --> 00:20:27.650\nAnd then the last section is the Internet.\n\n382\n00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:31.212\nRight we've done local intranet,\ntrusted sites, restricted sites, and\n\n383\n00:20:31.212 --> 00:20:32.390\nthen you have Internet.\n\n384\n00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:34.590\nInternet is the catch all.\n\n385\n00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:38.644\nThis is anything that doesn't fit, if it's\nnot a local intranet site If it's not\n\n386\n00:20:38.644 --> 00:20:42.250\ntrusted, if it's not restricted,\nthen it goes into the Internet.\n\n387\n00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:45.450\nIt's like the catch-all bucket\nunderneath all of the other three there.\n\n388\n00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:47.670\nAnd, by default, it's set to medium high,\n\n389\n00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:50.970\nmeaning it's gonna prevent a lot\nof things, unsigned controls.\n\n390\n00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:53.060\nBut it'll allow some functionality.\n\n391\n00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:56.004\nAnd then, if you go to the site and you\nrealize it's not doing the way it should,\n\n392\n00:20:56.004 --> 00:20:58.110\nI can then move it to my trusted sites,\nbut\n\n393\n00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:03.330\nthis is where everything starts out,\nexcept for intranet sites is the Internet.\n\n394\n00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:06.270\nIf it doesn't fit one of the others,\nif it's here, same concepts.\n\n395\n00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:11.950\nI got my slider that I can adjust and\nI've got my custom level that I can use.\n\n396\n00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:14.020\nNotice the sites button is grayed out.\n\n397\n00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.340\nCan't add sites to the Internet.\n\n398\n00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:19.760\nEverything is in the Internet unless\nit's part of one of these three.\n\n399\n00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:22.483\nSo everything goes there automatically,\nand\n\n400\n00:21:22.483 --> 00:21:25.568\nthen it gets moved to\nthe other ones as appropriate.\n\n401\n00:21:25.568 --> 00:21:31.106\nAll right, so those are the way security\nis handled through Internet Explorer,\n\n402\n00:21:31.106 --> 00:21:34.620\nup to Internet Explorer 11,\nthose are my zones.\n\n403\n00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:39.730\nNow if we switch over to edge which\nI don't believe will be on this exam,\n\n404\n00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:42.540\nbut I wanna make sure that we\ncover it anyway just in case.\n\n405\n00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:44.860\nLet's take a look at what we have here and\n\n406\n00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:49.930\nwhat you're gonna find is it's\nreally limited on what we can do.\n\n407\n00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:52.100\nIt is supposed to be\na more secure browser.\n\n408\n00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:57.670\nA lot of stuff is kinda built in and\nbehind the scenes, taken care of for us.\n\n409\n00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:02.580\nMight or might not like that, your\norganization might or might not like that.\n\n410\n00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:05.560\nBut let's look at it anyway just\nto see what we have access to.\n\n411\n00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.640\nSo let me do that again, what I did,\nI went up to the little ellipsis dot\n\n412\n00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:12.170\nup here in the corner,\nright underneath my closing X.\n\n413\n00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:16.750\nAnd in here I'm gonna go down to settings.\n\n414\n00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:21.300\nAll right, and my settings I've\ngot things like themes and\n\n415\n00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.320\nother fun stuff that I\ncan change the colors on.\n\n416\n00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:28.350\nBut as I go down I'll see\nmy advanced settings here.\n\n417\n00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:31.620\nAnd I'll also see this\nclear browsing data.\n\n418\n00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:35.910\nSo not as obvious, I didn't say hey,\ncookies are here or history is here.\n\n419\n00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:37.420\nIt just says clear browsing data.\n\n420\n00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.568\nIf I click choose what to clear,\n\n421\n00:22:39.568 --> 00:22:43.865\nnow I can see a lot of the same\noptions I had in Internet explorer,\n\n422\n00:22:43.865 --> 00:22:49.771\nclear my history, my cookies, cache data,\ntabs I've closed, history, etc, etc.\n\n423\n00:22:49.771 --> 00:22:51.877\nYou can even click show more and\n\n424\n00:22:51.877 --> 00:22:57.880\nyou'll get additional information like\nmedia licenses, pop up exceptions.\n\n425\n00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.870\nMaybe I've made some exceptions and\nI don't want those exceptions anymore.\n\n426\n00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:04.430\nOr somebody else was using the computer\nand made some exceptions and\n\n427\n00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:05.860\nI wanna wipe everything out.\n\n428\n00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:09.810\nNow I can come in here and\ncheck some of those.\n\n429\n00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:14.250\nAnd then click clear, can also have it\nclear every time I close the browser.\n\n430\n00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:17.770\nI'm not a huge fan of that cuz like I\nsaid, I like cookies for certain sites.\n\n431\n00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:20.650\nBut for public computers,\nshared computers, it's a good option.\n\n432\n00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:23.650\nThat's on Internet Explorer as well,\nall right.\n\n433\n00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:27.920\nSo I'm gonna go back out to my settings,\nand then let's go down and\n\n434\n00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.769\ntake a look at the Advanced Settings.\n\n435\n00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.900\nAll right, and\nhere is where I've got my pop up blocker.\n\n436\n00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:38.300\nSo I can see I can just simply turn it on,\nor turn it off.\n\n437\n00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:39.320\nNot a lot of control,\n\n438\n00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:45.240\nnot a whole yes I wanna always allow pop\nups from new egg or anything like that.\n\n439\n00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:49.120\nThere's just simply turn it on or\nturn it off, All right.\n\n440\n00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.670\nI can clear some of my password\nhistory down here at the bottom.\n\n441\n00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:53.930\nWhat else?\n\n442\n00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:57.580\nBut what you're not seeing\nare those four zones, right?\n\n443\n00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:58.459\nThey don't do that anymore.\n\n444\n00:23:58.459 --> 00:24:00.700\nIt's just something that\nthey've taken away.\n\n445\n00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:02.476\nI don't know if they\nplan on adding it back or\n\n446\n00:24:02.476 --> 00:24:04.552\nsecurity is handled a little\nbit differently now.\n\n447\n00:24:04.552 --> 00:24:08.521\nSo it's maybe something that\nthey felt was not necessary, or\n\n448\n00:24:08.521 --> 00:24:10.900\nmaybe they'll add it in the future.\n\n449\n00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.720\nI don't know, I can't speak for Microsoft.\n\n450\n00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.230\nBut what I want you to know is,\n\n451\n00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:17.560\nI can still control my pop-ups,\nI can still control my cookies.\n\n452\n00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:22.910\nI don't have the same control, as far\nas trusted sites and restricted sites.\n\n453\n00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:25.330\nNot within Edge, currently, or\n\n454\n00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:27.830\nat the time of this recording,\nmaybe that'll get added later.\n\n455\n00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:31.430\nAll right, so\nwe've been talking about browsers,\n\n456\n00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:35.210\nand how to secure our\nsettings within our browsers.\n\n457\n00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:39.090\nI want to talk a little bit about\nsecure websites in general, right.\n\n458\n00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:43.650\nIt's something that I think most of us\nnowadays are becoming much more familiar\n\n459\n00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:45.870\nwith, because we see it\nin the news all the time.\n\n460\n00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:49.037\nIt's something that we're being\nexposed to, and thinking about, so\n\n461\n00:24:49.037 --> 00:24:50.792\nwe're starting to look a little more.\n\n462\n00:24:50.792 --> 00:24:54.110\nBut remember, when we go out and\nwe connect to these web servers.\n\n463\n00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:59.436\nData is sent back and forth, by default,\nin what's called cleartext, or plaintext.\n\n464\n00:24:59.436 --> 00:25:02.433\nMeaning, if anybody's sitting\nin between you and the server,\n\n465\n00:25:02.433 --> 00:25:05.160\nthey can run a program to capture\nthe packets as they go by.\n\n466\n00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:09.495\nAnd they can see the data you're sending\nto the website, like your username and\n\n467\n00:25:09.495 --> 00:25:10.510\npassword.\n\n468\n00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:13.333\nThey can also see this data that\nthe website's sending back to you.\n\n469\n00:25:13.333 --> 00:25:17.819\nWhat products you're looking at, what book\nyou're reading, whatever the case may be.\n\n470\n00:25:17.819 --> 00:25:22.817\nBecause HTTP Is plaintext,\nit's a plaintext protocol,\n\n471\n00:25:22.817 --> 00:25:26.870\ndoes nothing to try to hide the data.\n\n472\n00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:30.220\nBut when we go to our banking site,\nany time we want to log in,\n\n473\n00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:35.890\nI don't care whether it's your bank,\nPayPal, IMDB, anything.\n\n474\n00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:39.390\nAny time you're gonna submit credentials\ninto your browser, you're gonna type in\n\n475\n00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:42.650\na username and password,\nyou should look at your address bar.\n\n476\n00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:44.560\nEvery browser's going to be different, but\n\n477\n00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:48.650\nthey all have some way of indicating\nwhether you're on a secure site.\n\n478\n00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:54.770\nHTTPS, HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure\nis the first thing we should look for,\n\n479\n00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:56.710\nbecause that is the secure\nversion of HTTP.\n\n480\n00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:59.740\nThey said, all right,\nlet's encrypt this traffic, right?\n\n481\n00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:03.370\nThat way if somebody's standing in\nbetween you two, I say standing, right.\n\n482\n00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:06.950\nSome connection, that they're able\nto sniff or capture that data,\n\n483\n00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:10.440\nas it travels across the Internet,\nit'll be encrypted.\n\n484\n00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.080\nThey can still capture it, but\nthey won't be able to read it.\n\n485\n00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:16.333\nIt will be like computer language to them.\n\n486\n00:26:16.333 --> 00:26:19.017\nSo HTTPS is what we're looking for,\nand again,\n\n487\n00:26:19.017 --> 00:26:23.350\nmost browsers will let you, they'll\ngive you some kind of visual indicator.\n\n488\n00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:26.941\nA green lock, or a green address bar for\nadditional verification,\n\n489\n00:26:26.941 --> 00:26:29.910\nwe're not really going to go\ninto all of that right now.\n\n490\n00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:32.674\nBut just understand that\nbefore you submit anything,\n\n491\n00:26:32.674 --> 00:26:37.230\nyou should really pay attention to that\naddress bar and make sure it's secure.\n\n492\n00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:43.020\nSome sites will not flip over to HTTPS\nuntil after you've entered the site,\n\n493\n00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:43.710\nbe careful with that.\n\n494\n00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:47.040\nDon't put your credentials in there,\nuntil you see the HTTPS.\n\n495\n00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.960\nAlso be careful, because some sites will\nsecure the authentication process, but\n\n496\n00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.740\ntheir entire site is not secure.\n\n497\n00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:57.860\nSo even though it says HTTPS up there, you\nmight have an iframe that is not secure.\n\n498\n00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:02.120\nSo anything submitted in that particular\npart of the webpage could be in plaintext.\n\n499\n00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.640\nOr they'll secure\nthe authentication traffic, but\n\n500\n00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.710\nthen once you've authenticated,\nit'll flip back to HTTP.\n\n501\n00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:10.030\nAnd no longer is your\ndata being encrypted.\n\n502\n00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:13.890\nAnd that might be fine,\nif it's a site like Wikipedia,\n\n503\n00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:16.790\nwhere it's not private information,\nthat's okay.\n\n504\n00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:17.632\nI don't know, can you authenticate?\n\n505\n00:27:17.632 --> 00:27:20.084\nI don't think you can\nauthenticate to Wikipedia.\n\n506\n00:27:20.084 --> 00:27:22.348\n&gt;&gt; Well, if you're an author, you can.\n\n507\n00:27:22.348 --> 00:27:23.306\n&gt;&gt; Can you?\nOkay, yeah so,\n\n508\n00:27:23.306 --> 00:27:25.829\nI've never written anything on Wikipedia.\n\n509\n00:27:25.829 --> 00:27:28.379\nBut, so\nsome sites may switch back to HTTP.\n\n510\n00:27:28.379 --> 00:27:30.387\nAnd you feel like you're secure, and\n\n511\n00:27:30.387 --> 00:27:33.630\nyou're willing to type in\na Social Security number.\n\n512\n00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:38.470\nYou didn't look and go, wait,\nthey switched back to HTTP, not HTTPS, so\n\n513\n00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:40.200\npay attention to that.\n\n514\n00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.870\nLast two things, I know Peter is giving me\nthat signal, we're getting short on time,\n\n515\n00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:45.378\nso I'll speed up just a little bit.\n\n516\n00:27:45.378 --> 00:27:48.795\nPhishing and pharming,\nboth words we're familiar with, but\n\n517\n00:27:48.795 --> 00:27:52.478\nwe're going to spell them a little\ndifferently for this exercise.\n\n518\n00:27:52.478 --> 00:27:55.678\nWe're going to call it phishing\nwith a P-H, P-H-I-S-H-I-N-G.\n\n519\n00:27:55.678 --> 00:27:57.889\nAnd pharming, P-H-A-R-M-I-N-G,\nif I spelled that right,\n\n520\n00:27:57.889 --> 00:27:58.888\nEnglish is not my strong suit.\n\n521\n00:27:58.888 --> 00:28:03.001\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI don't know why you enunciated the R,\n\n522\n00:28:03.001 --> 00:28:09.580\nbecause that's not the different part,\nbut P-H-A-R-M-I-N-G.\n\n523\n00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:14.441\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nobviously English is not my strong suit.\n\n524\n00:28:14.441 --> 00:28:18.095\nBut phishing and farming,\nwith the PH in front of it there,\n\n525\n00:28:18.095 --> 00:28:23.620\nis a technique that the bad guys use to\nbasically do, to steal your information.\n\n526\n00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:28.657\nThey are trying to trick you into giving\nup personally identifiable information.\n\n527\n00:28:28.657 --> 00:28:32.190\nBe it user name and password,\nSocial Security numbers,\n\n528\n00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:35.366\nbank account numbers,\ncredit card information.\n\n529\n00:28:35.366 --> 00:28:38.705\nAnything that they can might\nfind useful or valuable,\n\n530\n00:28:38.705 --> 00:28:40.830\nthat they can steal and/or sell.\n\n531\n00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:44.490\nOr steal and sell, or\nwhatever they want to try to do with it.\n\n532\n00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:46.380\nSo what is the difference?\n\n533\n00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:50.260\nWell, phishing is typically\ndone through email,\n\n534\n00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:53.380\nit can be done through voice,\nthough, with phone calls.\n\n535\n00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:58.050\nAnd that's the whole, hey, click on\nthis link, well, let me take that back.\n\n536\n00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:01.436\nWith the phishing, it's hey,\nsend us your password, right?\n\n537\n00:29:01.436 --> 00:29:04.593\nWe need to know your password, so that we\ncan get you entered into the new system.\n\n538\n00:29:04.593 --> 00:29:07.471\nOr hey, what's your account number for\nsuch and such, or\n\n539\n00:29:07.471 --> 00:29:09.710\nwhat's your Social Security number?\n\n540\n00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:11.850\nSo I can make sure that you\nare entered in the system, so\n\n541\n00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:14.750\ntomorrow morning everything\nshould work as planned, right?\n\n542\n00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:19.820\nThis is bad guys trying to convince\nyou to give up information.\n\n543\n00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.470\nRule number one, email is insecure.\n\n544\n00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:25.168\nThere are ways we can try to secure it,\nwe can encrypt it,\n\n545\n00:29:25.168 --> 00:29:26.584\nwe can do all kinds of things.\n\n546\n00:29:26.584 --> 00:29:31.810\nBut in your mind, you should always\nthink email is insecure, right?\n\n547\n00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:36.880\nPeter, what did you learn about putting\nmoney in the mail, good thing, bad thing?\n\n548\n00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.285\n&gt;&gt; It's frowned upon,\nI think I want to send a money order or\n\n549\n00:29:39.285 --> 00:29:41.348\na check that's written\nout to someone's name.\n\n550\n00:29:41.348 --> 00:29:44.350\nOr just use the Internet.\n\n551\n00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:46.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, but it's illegal\nto go into somebody's mailbox,\n\n552\n00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:48.050\nit's a federal crime.\n\n553\n00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:51.990\nAnd if I take that $100 bill and\nwrap it up in a piece of paper, so\n\n554\n00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:55.270\nyou can't see it, and it should be safe.\n\n555\n00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:57.420\nYeah, it should be, but\ndo you wanna take that risk?\n\n556\n00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:59.950\nIt's the same thing when\nyou're using email.\n\n557\n00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:01.820\nYes it should be safe,\nit should be secure,\n\n558\n00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:05.900\nbut should you really put your\nSocial Security number in an email?\n\n559\n00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:10.080\nWhat if somebody gets it,\nodds are not great, but what if they do?\n\n560\n00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.760\nNow we're talking identity theft, and\n\n561\n00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:14.500\ntry to recover from that it's a nightmare,\nright?\n\n562\n00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:18.010\nSo just consider email pretty insecure,\n\n563\n00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:21.040\nalways consider what information\nyou're putting in an email.\n\n564\n00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:25.400\nNever give out personal identifiable\ninformation in an email.\n\n565\n00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.940\nIf my bank account, if my bank\nneeds my Social Security number,\n\n566\n00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:32.040\nfirst of all, they better\nalready have it on file, right?\n\n567\n00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:36.250\nAnd if they need it, I will pick up\nthe phone and I will call them, or\n\n568\n00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:37.650\nI will stop by and talk to them.\n\n569\n00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:39.670\nI'm not gonna put it in\nthe email they sent me,\n\n570\n00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:41.320\ncuz my bank's not gonna do that to me.\n\n571\n00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.190\nMy bank is not that,\nwell they shouldn't be.\n\n572\n00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:49.690\nNo organization should ever ask you to\nsubmit personal information in an email.\n\n573\n00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:52.380\nBut that's what phishing is all about,\ntrying to get you to do that.\n\n574\n00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:55.635\nAnd a lot us fall victim to it,\nthat's why it's still around.\n\n575\n00:30:55.635 --> 00:30:59.460\nPharming takes it a little bit further,\npharming\n\n576\n00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:04.470\nis when I'll set up an actual fake\nwebsite, that looks like the real deal.\n\n577\n00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:07.423\nSo instead of just trying to get you\nto put your password in an email, or\n\n578\n00:31:07.423 --> 00:31:09.236\nput your Social Security number in there.\n\n579\n00:31:09.236 --> 00:31:10.982\nI'm going to give you a link,\nI'm going to say hey,\n\n580\n00:31:10.982 --> 00:31:13.100\nyou need to come update your password,\nit's ready to expire.\n\n581\n00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.571\nAnd you won't have access\nuntil you update it, and\n\n582\n00:31:15.571 --> 00:31:18.200\nhere's a link to quickly\nupdate your password.\n\n583\n00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:21.700\nConvenient for you, right, I'm going to\ngive you a link, I'm such a nice guy.\n\n584\n00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:25.050\nYou click on the link, and it goes to\na site that looks just like PayPal.\n\n585\n00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:26.530\nAnd you type in your username and\nyour password,\n\n586\n00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:28.180\nyou click Submit, and nothing happens.\n\n587\n00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:30.310\nWhat do most people do?\n\n588\n00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:32.492\n&gt;&gt; They're gonna type it again, right?\n\n589\n00:31:32.492 --> 00:31:35.660\n&gt;&gt; Yes, if it didn't work the first time,\nI'm gonna type it again, and\n\n590\n00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:37.140\nclick Submit one more time.\n\n591\n00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:40.540\nJust to make sure the bad guy now has your\ncredentials, cuz that what's happening.\n\n592\n00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:45.049\nIf he's a really good bad guy, he'll\nredirect you to the real PayPal site,\n\n593\n00:31:45.049 --> 00:31:46.041\nyou'll log in.\n\n594\n00:31:46.041 --> 00:31:50.023\nAnd most people'll be like,\nit was a glitch, something hung up, but\n\n595\n00:31:50.023 --> 00:31:51.630\nit's all good now.\n\n596\n00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:54.240\nIn the meantime,\nhe's logging into your PayPal account,\n\n597\n00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.890\nchanging your password, and getting\naccess to everything you have there.\n\n598\n00:31:57.890 --> 00:32:01.320\nSo phishing is trying to get you\nto give up personal information,\n\n599\n00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.060\ntypically via email.\n\n600\n00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:06.950\nPharming is when we set up fake\nwebsites to try to do the same thing.\n\n601\n00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:11.110\nGet you to come there and submit your\ninformation, typically log-on information,\n\n602\n00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:12.880\nthat's what we're trying\nto get with pharming.\n\n603\n00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:15.230\nSo a couple terms we\nneed to be familiar with.\n\n604\n00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:18.533\n&gt;&gt; I think the key takeaway there is,\nif you actually use a bank that asks for\n\n605\n00:32:18.533 --> 00:32:21.416\nthat information via email,\nyou should use a different bank.\n\n606\n00:32:21.416 --> 00:32:24.920\n&gt;&gt; Change banks immediately,\nyes I would, honestly.\n\n607\n00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:25.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n608\n00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:29.280\n&gt;&gt; Well I think that does a pretty good\njob of covering Internet security as it\n\n609\n00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:34.310\nrelates to Microsoft Internet Explorer,\nas well a little bit on that Adge.\n\n610\n00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:36.010\nThanks for giving us those tips as well,\n\n611\n00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:39.265\neven though that's something that's\nnot gonna come up on the exam, per se.\n\n612\n00:32:39.265 --> 00:32:41.511\nBut we are out of time for this episode.\n\n613\n00:32:41.511 --> 00:32:45.449\nWe have a lot more great content coming\nabout security fundamentals in the future,\n\n614\n00:32:45.449 --> 00:32:46.640\nso stay tuned for those.\n\n615\n00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:50.220\nBut for now signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Peter VanRysdam.\n\n616\n00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:51.200\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n617\n00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:51.992\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you next time.\n\n618\n00:32:51.992 --> 00:32:56.620\n[MUSIC]\n\n619\n00:32:56.620 --> 00:33:02.196\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:06.078\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.078 --> 00:00:08.189\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.133\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:14.332\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome to ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:14.332 --> 00:00:16.194\nI'm your host Peter VanRysdam and\n\n8\n00:00:16.194 --> 00:00:20.950\ntoday we're continuing with our series of\nthe Microsoft MTA Security Fundamentals.\n\n9\n00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.610\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're going to be talking about\n\n10\n00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.460\nwireless security,\nsomething that's important at your house,\n\n11\n00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.840\nat your business, anywhere that\nyou're using that wireless internet.\n\n12\n00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.760\nAnd here to help us understand that,\nwe have Mr. Mike Roderick.\n\n13\n00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.620\nMike, how are you doing?\n\n14\n00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.260\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\nThis will be a really short show.\n\n15\n00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.990\nDon't use wireless,\nif you want to be secure.\n\n16\n00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.580\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n17\n00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.500\nWell, you see, I'm excited.\n\n18\n00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.250\nSo we got a wireless\naccess point set up here.\n\n19\n00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.010\nWe're gonna do some fun hands-on stuff.\n\n20\n00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.320\nSo where do we start?\n\n21\n00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.200\n&gt;&gt; We'll take a look at some different\ntechniques we can use to try to\n\n22\n00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.580\nsecure our wireless networks.\n\n23\n00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.230\nI shouldn't say try to.\n\n24\n00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.450\nWe're gonna secure our wireless\nnetworks as best we can, anyway.\n\n25\n00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.250\nAnd again,\nthis is not a super in depth look at it.\n\n26\n00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.410\nWe just want to talk about some of\nthe terms that we're going to need to be\n\n27\n00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.070\nfamiliar with.\n\n28\n00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.780\nLike when we look at our router or our\nwireless access point configuration, and\n\n29\n00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.550\nit gives us these choices to pick as far\nas security goes, which one do I pick?\n\n30\n00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.870\nWhat's the difference between them?\n\n31\n00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.430\nWhy would I choose one over the other?\n\n32\n00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.960\nThat's what I want to talk about here\nwhen we talk about wireless security.\n\n33\n00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.570\nSo let's start by talking about\n\n34\n00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.200\nwhat they call the specific\nsecurity types, all right?\n\n35\n00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.010\nWhen we look at wireless security,\n\n36\n00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.640\nthere's a couple of different\nprotocols that we can use.\n\n37\n00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.160\nOne, we can leave it wide open I guess.\n\n38\n00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.550\nSo there's a third option.\n\n39\n00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.550\nNot really a protocol, but it's an option.\n\n40\n00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.090\nYou just leave security off, right.\n\n41\n00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.040\nWhich is the default unfortunately,\n\n42\n00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.980\non many routers although that has\nchanged over the last couple of years.\n\n43\n00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.010\nBut it used to be a big problem,\nis that they would just come wide open.\n\n44\n00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.470\nAnd what that means is,\nlet's back up for a second.\n\n45\n00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.590\nA wireless access point or a WAP for\n\n46\n00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.650\nshort, I know Titus has got a shot\nof the one we've got sitting here.\n\n47\n00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.460\nAnd we've already been informed before we\nstarted the show about how old this one\n\n48\n00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.660\nis, since it says Cisco Linksys on there,\nwhich is no longer the case,\n\n49\n00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.440\nbut that's beside the point with this.\n\n50\n00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.960\nAnd again, it's a wireless access point.\n\n51\n00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:21.430\nWhat this allows us to do is to connect\nwireless devices to our wired network.\n\n52\n00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.980\nall right.\n\n53\n00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.720\nThough you'll notice there is a cable\ncoming out of the back of this.\n\n54\n00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.060\nYou think, wait, it's a wireless\naccess point, why do you have wires?\n\n55\n00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.290\nOne is for power, but the other one\nis to connect to the wired network.\n\n56\n00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.480\nAt some point we need to transition\nto the wired networks so\n\n57\n00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.580\nthat it can go out my\nInternet connection cable.\n\n58\n00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.650\nIf I'm at home, Cox, Comcast,\nBright House, whoever is doing that.\n\n59\n00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.010\nOr if you're at work connecting your\nmobile devices to the work network, so\n\n60\n00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.940\nyou can get access to the work resources\nor the Internet through there.\n\n61\n00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.630\nSo there is at some point it\ngets to the wired network, and\n\n62\n00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.760\nthat's what the wireless\naccess point is for.\n\n63\n00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.360\nIt's for allowing wireless\nclients to connect to the wired\n\n64\n00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.570\nportion of your network.\n\n65\n00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.460\n&gt;&gt; So Mike, this cable here in this case,\n\n66\n00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.280\nthis is an input bringing\nthe Internet into it?\n\n67\n00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.800\nOr you're saying-\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n68\n00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.610\nI've kind of tricked it a little bit.\n\n69\n00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.190\nThis is actually going straight\nto my computer, just so\n\n70\n00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.870\nwe can see the configuration page.\n\n71\n00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.715\nBut if we were to look at the back of this\nguy, normally you're going to have one\n\n72\n00:03:18.715 --> 00:03:21.591\nport that's a little bit\ndifferent than the rest of them.\n\n73\n00:03:21.591 --> 00:03:27.390\nIt will say WAN or Internet and\nthat would actually go to my modem that\n\n74\n00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.555\nmy ISP provided for me, or\nat work it would tie back into a switch.\n\n75\n00:03:33.555 --> 00:03:36.545\nAnd these other ports are to\nsupport wired clients.\n\n76\n00:03:36.545 --> 00:03:41.335\nBecause you can do wired and\nwireless clients with a device like this.\n\n77\n00:03:41.335 --> 00:03:44.755\nNow I've plugged into one\nof the wired ports just so\n\n78\n00:03:44.755 --> 00:03:48.555\nthat I can show you the configuration\noptions inside here.\n\n79\n00:03:48.555 --> 00:03:53.361\nBut normally that cable would be going\nfrom the Internet port to my cable\n\n80\n00:03:53.361 --> 00:03:55.613\nmodem or a switch in my building.\n\n81\n00:03:55.613 --> 00:03:58.910\n&gt;&gt; All right Mike, so I know we just\ndid an episode on physical security.\n\n82\n00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.250\nIf you didn't watch that,\ngo ahead and check that out, but\n\n83\n00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.270\nare there any physical things to\nworry about with a router like this?\n\n84\n00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.280\nI know I could just maybe\nplug my computer in.\n\n85\n00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.860\nAm I just on the network then?\n\n86\n00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great question.\n\n87\n00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.030\nOne, all those points are valid.\n\n88\n00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.390\nIt does have ports on the back, so\n\n89\n00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.710\nif anybody connects to it they\ncan run a wire to it, absolutely.\n\n90\n00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.460\nThe most likely,\nif it's in its default configuration,\n\n91\n00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.780\nit's gonna give you all the information\nyou need to connect to the network.\n\n92\n00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.940\nAnd so if there's unsecured resources\nlike most of our home networks or\n\n93\n00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.880\npublic resources or\nunsecured resources at work, yeah,\n\n94\n00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.460\nthey'd be able to get access to that.\n\n95\n00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.620\nThe other thing they can\ndo on these devices,\n\n96\n00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.560\nmost of them are gonna have\nsome type of reset option.\n\n97\n00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.100\nI think if you can hold it up there and\npoint out the back of that little device,\n\n98\n00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.840\nthere is a button that you can press for\nten seconds.\n\n99\n00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.478\nIt will start flashing and it resets\neverything back to factory defaults.\n\n100\n00:04:50.478 --> 00:04:54.550\nSo I don't have to break your password or\ntry to get access to the machine that way,\n\n101\n00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.509\nor, I'm sorry, the router that way.\n\n102\n00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:58.530\nThe wireless access point, I should say.\n\n103\n00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.290\nIt is a router/switch/access point.\n\n104\n00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.570\nBut yeah, if I could just reset that,\nI know the default passwords.\n\n105\n00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.030\nI could look it up online, what is\nthe default password of a Linksys E2000?\n\n106\n00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.610\nI can find that online.\n\n107\n00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.750\nMost of you probably already know Admin,\nit is the default password for it.\n\n108\n00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.980\nSo yeah, physical security is very\nimportant with devices like this.\n\n109\n00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.830\nThere's one other aspect that physical\nsecurity will come into play here and\n\n110\n00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:30.358\nthat is if this wireless access\npoint supports something called WPA,\n\n111\n00:05:30.358 --> 00:05:34.270\nWiFi protected, setup WPS, sorry,\n\n112\n00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:40.780\nWPS WiFi protected setup, which is\nbasically a push the button on the router.\n\n113\n00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.620\nPush the button on a device and they'll\ntalk to each other and set everything up.\n\n114\n00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.420\nSo if I can get physical access to that,\n\n115\n00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.960\nI can definitely get access\nto your network through that.\n\n116\n00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.560\n&gt;&gt; And that's why I always keep\nmy router in a Faraday cage.\n\n117\n00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.770\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] cuz you're reception is so\ngood after that, too, yeah.\n\n118\n00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:55.580\n&gt;&gt; It's poor, yeah.\n\n119\n00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so yeah,\n\n120\n00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.190\nphysical security definitely\nsomething we've gotta consider.\n\n121\n00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.856\nRemember what I said earlier\nin that other episode,\n\n122\n00:06:02.856 --> 00:06:06.493\nphysical security trumps everything else,\nand if you don't have it,\n\n123\n00:06:06.493 --> 00:06:09.725\nmost of your other controls\nmeasures go out the window as well.\n\n124\n00:06:09.725 --> 00:06:15.115\nAll right, but once we get into the access\npoint itself and we start configuring and\n\n125\n00:06:15.115 --> 00:06:20.120\nas I said most access point at least older\none like this start out as wide open.\n\n126\n00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.470\nIn other words, anybody can come by and\ncan connect to this device.\n\n127\n00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.150\nBut we have other things\nthat we can choose,\n\n128\n00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.430\nto enable levels of security\non this access point.\n\n129\n00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.071\nNow, let's talk about, first let's,\n\n130\n00:06:35.071 --> 00:06:39.980\nI'm gonna kind of jump out of order on\nus here, Peter, so try to hang with me.\n\n131\n00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.490\nI'm gonna jump down to\nsomething known as SSIDs or\n\n132\n00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.576\nservice set identifiers because it kind\nof makes sense to talk about that first.\n\n133\n00:06:46.576 --> 00:06:50.205\nIf you're gonna connect to a wireless\naccess point, how do you do that?\n\n134\n00:06:50.205 --> 00:06:54.480\nWell, most of you know operating systems\nand I'm gonna be using Windows 10,\n\n135\n00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:00.080\nbut Windows 7, Windows 8, all the same,\nmaybe just a slightly different location.\n\n136\n00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.430\nYou can go to your wireless settings and\n\n137\n00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:07.170\nyou can see a list of available\nwireless networks in the area.\n\n138\n00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.039\nSo as I scroll down through here,\n\n139\n00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:15.190\nthere's a surprising number of wireless\nnetworks here that I'm in range for.\n\n140\n00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:18.510\nSome of them maybe the signal's\nnot quite as good, but\n\n141\n00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.380\nthere's definitely a lot of networks here.\n\n142\n00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.360\nAnd so what I'm looking at is the names.\n\n143\n00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.430\nAnd I'm gonna try to decide\nwhich one I wanna connect to.\n\n144\n00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:31.140\nLike I see ITProTV, ASO, ITProTV guest.\n\n145\n00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.520\nIf I scroll down here, time clock.\n\n146\n00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.920\nHere's one name Linksys 43964.\n\n147\n00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.390\nThat's actually the little access\npoint we just saw a second ago,\n\n148\n00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:42.900\ncuz I reset it to its defaults\nbefore we started the show.\n\n149\n00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.740\nAnd a couple of others here.\n\n150\n00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.550\nNow, how is my computer\nfinding this information?\n\n151\n00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.728\nHow is it populating this list?\n\n152\n00:07:49.728 --> 00:07:53.796\nWireless access points do\nsomething known as beaconing and\n\n153\n00:07:53.796 --> 00:07:55.757\nthey basically holler out.\n\n154\n00:07:55.757 --> 00:08:02.090\nContinuously, hey, my name is such and\nsuch and this is the security I'm running.\n\n155\n00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:04.950\nIf you want to connect to me,\nclick on me and I'll prompt you for\n\n156\n00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.400\nthe appropriate information.\n\n157\n00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.890\nThat's known as beaconing.\n\n158\n00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:10.204\nAnd what they're beaconing,\n\n159\n00:08:10.204 --> 00:08:15.013\namongst other things is their SSID,\nsecurity set identifier.\n\n160\n00:08:15.013 --> 00:08:18.860\nBasically that is the name you\ngive the wireless access point.\n\n161\n00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:22.330\nSo what I can use to identify it,\nall right.\n\n162\n00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:23.760\nAnd I'll show you where I can change it.\n\n163\n00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.870\nBecause it is one of\nthe things you should do.\n\n164\n00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:29.880\nIf you're setting up your home network,\nyou wanna change that default name.\n\n165\n00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.260\nIt's not a huge security thing.\n\n166\n00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:36.140\nBut changing the name does\na couple of things for me.\n\n167\n00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.780\nOne, it makes it easier to find\nthe right wireless access point.\n\n168\n00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.480\nBecause if I'm in a residential area,\n\n169\n00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.100\napartment complex where multiple people\nhave these wireless access points and\n\n170\n00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.840\nthey're all the default Linksys yada,\nyada, yada.\n\n171\n00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.660\nHow do I know which one's mine?\n\n172\n00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.630\nI don't wanna connect to somebody else's,\n\n173\n00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.730\nwho knows what they're\nrunning on their network?\n\n174\n00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.960\nCapturing traffic, malware, what have you.\n\n175\n00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.630\nSo I wanna connect to the right one.\n\n176\n00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:01.400\nSo we've rename our access points,\nso that we can find them.\n\n177\n00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.920\nBut I will caution you one security\nmeasure that we should take.\n\n178\n00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.720\nIt's not the end-all in security but\nwe always talk about layers and\n\n179\n00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:13.715\ndoing multiple things is don't name\nit ITProTV like we've done here.\n\n180\n00:09:13.715 --> 00:09:15.340\n[LAUGH] Right?\n\n181\n00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:19.980\nNormally, you don't want to,\nthere's pros and cons to this method and\n\n182\n00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.960\nthere's arguments on either side.\n\n183\n00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.070\nOne side says to be more secure\nname it something meaningful but\n\n184\n00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:28.530\nnot necessarily Identifying the owner,\nright?\n\n185\n00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.380\nBecause I don't want\npeople to connect ITProTV.\n\n186\n00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.720\nThat's for internal people to use.\n\n187\n00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:39.290\nSo I can tell everybody hey our wireless\naccess point is named Betty Boop and\n\n188\n00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:40.670\nthey would know to connect to that.\n\n189\n00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.040\nBut anybody else that's walking\nthrough my parking lot,\n\n190\n00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:48.590\ndriving by, they're gonna not know\nwhich network is actually ITProTV.\n\n191\n00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.330\nWouldn't take them too much to\nfigure it out, but that's the idea.\n\n192\n00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:55.870\nA little bit of security through\nobscurity, especially at home.\n\n193\n00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:58.660\nI don't really want people, I don't want\nto put my address there or my last name,\n\n194\n00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.550\nbecause they're going to\nknow exactly what house,\n\n195\n00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:03.630\nwhere that wireless\naccess point is sitting.\n\n196\n00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.080\nSo change it to something meaningful, but\nmaybe not something quite so identifiable.\n\n197\n00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.672\nI say there are two sides to that coin.\n\n198\n00:10:10.672 --> 00:10:14.360\nIf I'm Starbucks, I don't want people\ngoing well which network is yours?\n\n199\n00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.870\nAnd they are looking at a list of\nnetworks and there is Barney and\n\n200\n00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.990\nBetty Boop and Disney World and\nthings like that.\n\n201\n00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:22.960\nIt's like I don't know which\none of these is Starbucks.\n\n202\n00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.910\nNow I've got to ask.\n\n203\n00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:25.400\nI mean it can be a pain, right.\n\n204\n00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.660\nSo In an environment like that\nit might make more sense.\n\n205\n00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:33.030\nAlso though, think about this, if I'm\na bad guy and I'm gonna set up a rogue\n\n206\n00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:38.120\naccess point at Starbucks, and try to get\nyou to connect to mine and not theirs, so\n\n207\n00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.898\nthat I can try to intercept your data,\nguess what I'm gonna name my access point?\n\n208\n00:10:41.898 --> 00:10:47.790\nYeah Starbucks 2, right or\nStarbucks with an extra t or whatever.\n\n209\n00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:51.190\nSomething close enough where you might\njust click on it thinking its Starbucks\n\n210\n00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:52.570\nwireless network.\n\n211\n00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.890\nSo pay attention to those\nnames that your clicking on.\n\n212\n00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:59.380\n&gt;&gt; All right Mike so is there just a way\nto just stop it from sending out it's name\n\n213\n00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:02.210\nall together and\nif you do that can you still access it.\n\n214\n00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:05.540\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question and let's take\na look at that and the answer would be yes\n\n215\n00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:10.535\nand yes to both of those or yes and\na little more difficultly but yes.\n\n216\n00:11:10.535 --> 00:11:14.980\n[LAUGH] So we can definitely turn\noff the beakening of the SSID right?\n\n217\n00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:17.330\nRather than we can change it's name and\n\n218\n00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.840\nmake a little bit of security\nthrough obscurity there.\n\n219\n00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.830\nWe can also just disable beaconing and\nfor that go to your wireless settings.\n\n220\n00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.870\nEach one's gonna be slightly different.\n\n221\n00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:28.090\nOn this one by default,\n\n222\n00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:32.380\nit wants to do the WiFi protected setup\nbecause that's simple for home users.\n\n223\n00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:36.080\nI'm gonna have to turn that off\nbefore I see all of my settings.\n\n224\n00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.560\nI'm gonna change that back to Manual.\n\n225\n00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.400\nDid I say I'm gonna change\nthat back to Manual?\n\n226\n00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.835\nLet me zoom out and\nchange that back to Manual.\n\n227\n00:11:44.835 --> 00:11:47.980\nSometimes the clicky click\ndoesn't work when I'm zoomed in.\n\n228\n00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.910\nSo once I change that to Manual,\n\n229\n00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:53.640\nnow we can see that I have some different\noptions and look at that very last one.\n\n230\n00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.500\nSSID Broadcast Enabled or Disabled.\n\n231\n00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:00.750\nAll right I'm gonna choose Disabled and\nsave my changes.\n\n232\n00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:05.780\nSo now the access point will no longer\nbeacon that bit of information.\n\n233\n00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:07.740\nIt won't spit out its name any more.\n\n234\n00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.470\nIn fact we can check.\n\n235\n00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:12.470\nIt's been a little slow but\nlet me see if it's disappeared here.\n\n236\n00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:14.570\nI still see it there.\n\n237\n00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:18.600\nI bet if I try to connect it's gonna tell\nme that network doesn't exist, maybe.\n\n238\n00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.590\nWe'll see what happens there.\n\n239\n00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:24.427\nBut while it's doing that,\nI'm gonna just cancel that actually,\n\n240\n00:12:24.427 --> 00:12:25.939\nI don't think it's gonna find it.\n\n241\n00:12:27.772 --> 00:12:30.430\nAnyway, Yeah, and\nit should disappear from the list\n\n242\n00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:33.640\ncuz now it's like wait it's\nnot really there anymore.\n\n243\n00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.810\nSo changing that name and then turning off\nthe broadcast, it doesn't show up anymore.\n\n244\n00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:39.424\nWell actually I lied, there it is.\n\n245\n00:12:39.424 --> 00:12:43.834\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But anyway, the name is not showing up,\n\n246\n00:12:43.834 --> 00:12:44.570\nright?\n\n247\n00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:48.240\nThe name I changed it to Skynet is\nno longer showing up in this list\n\n248\n00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.790\nbecause we've disabled beaconing.\n\n249\n00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:51.920\nNow your question was can\nwe still connect to it?\n\n250\n00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:56.340\nAnd the answer would be absolutely, but\nyou won't see it in this list anymore.\n\n251\n00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.650\nNow you're going to have to I'm\nphysically connected to it.\n\n252\n00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:01.640\nThat's why it's still showing\nthat information there.\n\n253\n00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:04.320\nI have a cable connected to this guy.\n\n254\n00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.570\nJust thought of that.\n\n255\n00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:09.630\nBut once you turn off that beaconing it's\nnot gonna show up in the list anymore.\n\n256\n00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:11.430\nSo the bad guys, the passerbys,\n\n257\n00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:14.940\nthey're not gonna see your network or\nknow that it's there right away.\n\n258\n00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:16.170\nBut can you still connect to it?\n\n259\n00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:17.510\nYes, you have to know the name.\n\n260\n00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:20.480\nYou have to go into your network and\nsettings and\n\n261\n00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.920\nmanually type in the name\nof the access point.\n\n262\n00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.300\nBecause it's no longer\ngonna show up in your list.\n\n263\n00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.272\nSo we might get a little security\nout of it because it's hidden.\n\n264\n00:13:28.272 --> 00:13:30.800\nAll right,\nnobody sees that the network is there, but\n\n265\n00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.680\nnow from my legitimate users\nit becomes a challenge\n\n266\n00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.830\nbecause they have to know the exact name,\nthey have to type it correctly.\n\n267\n00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:40.020\nUsually it'll remember it once\nthey've connected to it, but\n\n268\n00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:44.130\nif it forgets it they gotta type it\nin again, so now that becomes a pain.\n\n269\n00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:45.880\nAnd here's the thing about the security,\n\n270\n00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.220\nyou're really not getting\nthat much security.\n\n271\n00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:52.990\nYes the casual passerby will not see\nyour access point in that list anymore\n\n272\n00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:54.920\nbecause you've turned off beaconing.\n\n273\n00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:58.690\nBut anybody that's worth their weight\nof salt in hacking if they really want\n\n274\n00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:02.880\nto find your network all they're gonna\ndo is open up a packet caps utility and\n\n275\n00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.320\neven though it's not beaconing the SSID.\n\n276\n00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.830\nThere's still traffic going on\nin your wireless access point,\n\n277\n00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:10.910\ndevices in your house, or\nin your office, are connected to it, so\n\n278\n00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:12.770\nthere's traffic going back and forth.\n\n279\n00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:16.750\nI can see that traffic and I can see\nwhat the destination of the traffic is.\n\n280\n00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:19.940\nThe destination is Skynet, so there's\nthe name of the access point that you were\n\n281\n00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.200\ntrying to hide from me, all right?\n\n282\n00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.980\nSo it's one of those things where, yes,\nyou should definitely, or you could do it.\n\n283\n00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:29.790\nBut it's really not gonna get\nyou that much in security and\n\n284\n00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:33.590\nit's gonna end up causing more\nfrustration for your legitimate users.\n\n285\n00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:35.780\nSo it's one of those back and\nfourth things.\n\n286\n00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:39.010\nShould you disable your SSID broadcast?\n\n287\n00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:43.390\nIn very high security areas,\nit's one more layer, maybe I do.\n\n288\n00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:47.520\nIn most environments,\nit's probably not worth the effort,\n\n289\n00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:51.300\nbecause it's really no effort at all for\nthe bad guys to find the SSID.\n\n290\n00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.260\nAnd it's a lot of effort for\n\n291\n00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.800\nyou're legitimate users to now connect\nto your access point, all right?\n\n292\n00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.500\nBut something that you in your\norganization have to do your risk\n\n293\n00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.400\nmanagement on, don't take my word for it.\n\n294\n00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.640\nYou as an organization decide what\nit is you need to do with that.\n\n295\n00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.080\nSo we can turn off\nthe beaconing of the SSID.\n\n296\n00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.050\nOther things we can choose in\nhere are the security settings.\n\n297\n00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:14.350\nWe have Open which means I'm\nnot gonna secure it at all.\n\n298\n00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:18.100\nAnd that's actually the default\non this particular access point.\n\n299\n00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:21.190\nBut if I hit the Security Mode\ndrop down list and for\n\n300\n00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:25.541\nsome reason my clicks are just not\nworking in the zoom in mode anymore.\n\n301\n00:15:27.676 --> 00:15:29.680\nAll right.\nSo I'm going to zoom in and out.\n\n302\n00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:33.890\nIf I hit this list and zoom back in,\nyou'll see that I have several choices.\n\n303\n00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:35.750\nI have WEP.\n\n304\n00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:36.880\nWe're gonna start down here.\n\n305\n00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.220\nI have WEP or WEP.\n\n306\n00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.240\nThis is wired equivalent privacy.\n\n307\n00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.710\nThis is the oldest one that we have.\n\n308\n00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:46.730\nIt was when wireless access points\nfirst came out, this is what we had.\n\n309\n00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.530\nAnd it was better than nothing.\n\n310\n00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:51.894\nBut it didn't take long for the bad guys\nto find some vulnerabilities in there.\n\n311\n00:15:51.894 --> 00:15:56.254\nAnd as computers became more powerful,\nit became pretty easy to crack.\n\n312\n00:15:56.254 --> 00:16:03.100\nAnd today, WEP is considered Unusually,\nI don't wanna say unusual, unusable.\n\n313\n00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:09.120\nBut it's not much better than turning\noff your SSID broadcast, honestly.\n\n314\n00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.350\nAnybody that really wants to\ncrack it can crack it in minutes.\n\n315\n00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:14.200\nIt will not take them long.\n\n316\n00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.780\nBut the passerby,\n\n317\n00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:21.430\nthe kids from the neighbor, they might\nnot go to those extreme lengths.\n\n318\n00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:23.780\nSo, should you turn it on?\n\n319\n00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.740\nIf that's all you have available,\nabsolutely, right?\n\n320\n00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:28.330\nIt's better than nothing.\n\n321\n00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.080\nYou look at the lock on my kitchen window.\n\n322\n00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.565\nIt's one of those old kind of flip\nthe lever type locks that anybody can take\n\n323\n00:16:33.565 --> 00:16:36.677\na butter knife and stick up in there and\njimmy along and pop it open.\n\n324\n00:16:36.677 --> 00:16:38.440\nIt would take two seconds.\n\n325\n00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.700\nDo I lock it anyway?\n\n326\n00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:42.240\nAbsolutely, because hopefully\nI will hear somebody\n\n327\n00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.780\ntrying to get through the window, right?\n\n328\n00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.564\nWe always still turn it on.\n\n329\n00:16:45.564 --> 00:16:47.590\nSo WEP if that's all you have.\n\n330\n00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:50.922\nThen we have WPA, and we have WPA2.\n\n331\n00:16:50.922 --> 00:16:56.074\nWPA is my WiFi Protected Alliance,\nand WPA2 is the second\n\n332\n00:16:56.074 --> 00:17:01.560\niteration of WPA, and\nI'll expand on that in a second.\n\n333\n00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:06.366\nEach one of those, WPA and\nWPA2, has a personal mode and\n\n334\n00:17:06.366 --> 00:17:09.180\nan Enterprise mode, all right.\n\n335\n00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:15.420\nWPA was the WiFi Alliance's attempt\nto fix some of the problems with WEP.\n\n336\n00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:19.900\nWe have a body for the promote standards,\nIEEE, the Institute of Electronics and\n\n337\n00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.430\nElectrical Engineers, and\nthey put out standards.\n\n338\n00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:24.580\nBut it takes them awhile to do this.\n\n339\n00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:26.340\nAnd in the meantime, nobody was buying or\n\n340\n00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:29.526\nimplementing wireless networks because\nthe security for WEP was so poor.\n\n341\n00:17:29.526 --> 00:17:32.522\nSo the WiFi Alliance said hey,\nwe're gonna fix it.\n\n342\n00:17:32.522 --> 00:17:35.200\nWe're gonna come up with some\nthings that we can do better and\n\n343\n00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.380\nmake it a little more secure.\n\n344\n00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:38.560\nAnd that was where WPA came in.\n\n345\n00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:43.169\nWell eventually, the IEEE got around\nto ratifying all their standards, and\n\n346\n00:17:43.169 --> 00:17:49.740\nthe WPA2 is what implements all of the\nstandards that are called out by the IEEE.\n\n347\n00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:53.390\nSo once they came up with their standards,\nthe WPA2 came about.\n\n348\n00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:57.940\nPersonal enterprise,\nwhether it's WPA or WPA2,\n\n349\n00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:02.075\npersonal is gonna use pass phrases or\npasswords, much like WEP did.\n\n350\n00:18:02.075 --> 00:18:04.555\nWhere you put a password\nin on the access point, and\n\n351\n00:18:04.555 --> 00:18:07.820\nthen anybody that wants to\nconnect has to know the password.\n\n352\n00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.250\nSo if Peter comes over to my house or\n\n353\n00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:12.694\nto my place of work, he says hey,\nwhat's your access point?\n\n354\n00:18:12.694 --> 00:18:14.798\nIt's SkyNet, what's your password?\n\n355\n00:18:14.798 --> 00:18:15.419\nIt's password 123.\n\n356\n00:18:15.419 --> 00:18:18.130\nHe can type it in and now connect to it.\n\n357\n00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:20.370\nThat's what the personal option is.\n\n358\n00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:24.460\nIt doesn't require any\nadditional equipment,\n\n359\n00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:25.710\njust have to configure the password.\n\n360\n00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:30.364\nAnd if I make it strong enough,\nI'm relatively secured, not WEP,\n\n361\n00:18:30.364 --> 00:18:32.170\nWEP is still vulnerable.\n\n362\n00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:35.980\nWPA is also vulnerable,\nbut not as bad as WEP.\n\n363\n00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.665\nAnd a good, long,\nstrong password will help.\n\n364\n00:18:39.665 --> 00:18:44.845\nWPA or WPA2 Enterprise uses something\nknown as digital certificates for\n\n365\n00:18:44.845 --> 00:18:46.580\nauthentication.\n\n366\n00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:49.365\nThese are electronic documents that\nhave your identifying information\n\n367\n00:18:49.365 --> 00:18:50.010\nstored in them.\n\n368\n00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:55.210\nAnd they're much more secure and\nmuch harder to fake than a password.\n\n369\n00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:58.440\nYou can guess passwords,\nI can try to crack passwords.\n\n370\n00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.280\nI can't do that with a certificate.\n\n371\n00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.780\nBut it also requires me\nhaving the infrastructure to\n\n372\n00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:06.330\nissue certificates to all my laptops or\nmobile devices.\n\n373\n00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:09.294\nInstalling them on those devices,\nso that when they go to connect,\n\n374\n00:19:09.294 --> 00:19:12.060\nthe access point can say,\nhey laptop, prove to me who you are.\n\n375\n00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:16.370\nHere's my certificate, just like you would\nyour driver's license to a police officer.\n\n376\n00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:19.130\nAnd then once they identify each other,\nit'll allow that laptop or\n\n377\n00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:21.750\nmobile device to connect\nto the access point.\n\n378\n00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:25.610\nSo a lot more secure because it's\na lot more difficult to try to\n\n379\n00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:30.750\nimpersonate a certificate, but\nextra infrastructure, extra setup.\n\n380\n00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:33.940\nThat's why they call it Enterprise cuz\ntypically that's something you see\n\n381\n00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:38.050\nin an enterprise, where I've got\nthe money to spend on things like that.\n\n382\n00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:42.480\nSo when we look at these,\nI want you to think about them in order.\n\n383\n00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.935\nWEP was the first one we had,\nit's better than nothing.\n\n384\n00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:50.830\nBut it's just the illusion\nof security at this point.\n\n385\n00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:52.390\nIt's very, very crackable.\n\n386\n00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:55.430\nBut if it's all you have, turn it on.\n\n387\n00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:59.480\nWPA was intended to replace WEP,\nit's more secure.\n\n388\n00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.540\nStill has some of the vulnerabilities that\nwe had in WEP because it was backwards\n\n389\n00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:03.940\ncompatible with WEP.\n\n390\n00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.580\nSo there are some vulnerabilities.\n\n391\n00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:09.554\nBut it uses something known as\ntemporal key integrity protocol,\n\n392\n00:20:09.554 --> 00:20:12.587\nwhich is something we\ndon't need to worry about,\n\n393\n00:20:12.587 --> 00:20:17.081\nbut it changes up the keys very fast,\nand it makes it a lot harder to crack.\n\n394\n00:20:17.081 --> 00:20:21.923\nWP2 was the second iteration of WPA,\nand this was developed after\n\n395\n00:20:21.923 --> 00:20:26.347\nthe IEEE formalized their standard for\nthe 802.11i.\n\n396\n00:20:26.347 --> 00:20:31.068\nAnd it includes all of the things that\nare called out in those standards.\n\n397\n00:20:31.068 --> 00:20:33.820\nPersonal uses passphrases or passwords for\n\n398\n00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:36.290\nthe authentication process\nto the access point.\n\n399\n00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:41.930\nEnterprise uses typically\ncertificates to do the authentication\n\n400\n00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:45.850\nbetween the device and the access point.\n\n401\n00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:46.788\nAll right, so those are our choices.\n\n402\n00:20:46.788 --> 00:20:49.925\nI mean WPA2 is first choice, personal or\n\n403\n00:20:49.925 --> 00:20:54.260\nenterprise depending on\nwhat your environment is.\n\n404\n00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:57.475\nIf I can't do WPA2 because some\nof my devices don't support it,\n\n405\n00:20:57.475 --> 00:20:58.359\nmaybe I go to WPA.\n\n406\n00:20:58.359 --> 00:21:03.165\nIf I can't do WPA, I go to WEP,\nif I can't do WEP, I give up and\n\n407\n00:21:03.165 --> 00:21:05.815\nI don't run wireless, right?\n\n408\n00:21:05.815 --> 00:21:09.540\nCuz at that point, everything that\ngoes across it is insecure and\n\n409\n00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:10.139\nanybody can read it.\n\n410\n00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:13.260\nAll right,\nhow're we doing on time there, Peter?\n\n411\n00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:14.310\n&gt;&gt; Great question, Mike.\n\n412\n00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:16.790\nWe are pretty much out of time, and\nI see we've got a lot more to cover and\n\n413\n00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:17.730\nI don't wanna rush through it.\n\n414\n00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:20.470\nSo let's go ahead and move this up\nto a part 2, does that sound good?\n\n415\n00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:21.620\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a plan to me.\n\n416\n00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:24.950\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, we're gonna go ahead\nand sign off then for this episode.\n\n417\n00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.144\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Peter VanRysdam.\n\n418\n00:21:27.144 --> 00:21:28.230\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n419\n00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.950\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you next time.\n\n420\n00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:36.790\n[MUSIC]\n\n421\n00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:38.415\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:06.693\n[CROSSTALK].\n\n4\n00:00:06.693 --> 00:00:08.483\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.483 --> 00:00:12.292\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.292 --> 00:00:15.100\n&gt;&gt; Hello, everybody,\nand welcome to ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.470\nI'm your host, Peter VanRysdam.\n\n8\n00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.160\nToday, we're continuing with our\nMTA Security Fundamentals course.\n\n9\n00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.980\nAnd this is actually a part two\nof our wireless security course.\n\n10\n00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.390\nWe started it last time.\n\n11\n00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.450\nA lot to cover in it, so\n\n12\n00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.600\nwe're gonna go ahead and pick up where we\nleft off right now with Mr Mike Rodrick.\n\n13\n00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.610\nMike, how you doing?\n\n14\n00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.250\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, although I do have\na correction to make from our part one.\n\n15\n00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.500\n&gt;&gt; This is mortifying, Mike.\n\n16\n00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.855\nWhat did we do wrong?\n\n17\n00:00:38.855 --> 00:00:40.640\n&gt;&gt; Well, I was goofing around and\n\n18\n00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.720\nI was trying to show everybody\nhow change the SSID.\n\n19\n00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.640\nAnd then it didn't change in the list and\n\n20\n00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.770\nI was kinda getting a little\nflustered with that there.\n\n21\n00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.900\nAnd I realized I was not\nchanging it in the right spot.\n\n22\n00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.275\nRemember, I had the Wi-Fi\nprotected setup or\n\n23\n00:00:53.275 --> 00:00:56.540\nWi-Fi protected setup turned on and\nit was hiding a bunch of features?\n\n24\n00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.250\nI'll show you here.\n\n25\n00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.790\nLet's just take a look at my screen.\n\n26\n00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:00.610\nWhat I was doing,\n\n27\n00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.530\nI was on the set up, and every wireless\naccess point will be slightly different.\n\n28\n00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.200\nAnd I was changing it right here in\nthe middle of my screen where it says\n\n29\n00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.690\nDevice Name.\n\n30\n00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.775\nThat has nothing to do with the SSID.\n\n31\n00:01:11.775 --> 00:01:13.980\nThat's just its internal name.\n\n32\n00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:14.990\nThat's where I was changing.\n\n33\n00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.220\nAnd that's why it wasn't working, because\nI wasn't actually changing the SSID.\n\n34\n00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.014\nSo let me show you how to\nactually change the SSID.\n\n35\n00:01:22.014 --> 00:01:24.885\nIf I go back over to wireless, and\n\n36\n00:01:24.885 --> 00:01:29.720\nI do no longer have my Wi-Fi\nprotected set up turned on.\n\n37\n00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.250\nI've got it on manual, so\nnow I can see the SSID broadcast option.\n\n38\n00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.910\nIt's currently disabled.\n\n39\n00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.830\nAnd the network name, not the device name.\n\n40\n00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.360\nThe network name, that's the SSID,\nand that's what I need to change.\n\n41\n00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.688\nSo let me zoom back out, and\nI will change this to Skynet,\n\n42\n00:01:48.688 --> 00:01:53.251\nand I'm gonna enable\nthe broadcast of the SSID.\n\n43\n00:01:53.251 --> 00:01:55.210\nI'm gonna save those settings.\n\n44\n00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.872\n&gt;&gt; And so now this is when we'll\nsee the different names show up in\n\n45\n00:01:59.872 --> 00:02:03.530\nour list of available Wi-Fi hotspots.\n\n46\n00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.025\nFingers crossed, right?\n\n47\n00:02:05.025 --> 00:02:08.466\n[LAUGH] Yes, that's what it should be,\nso if I go back now,\n\n48\n00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:11.933\nlook at my list of networks,\nI hopefully will see Skynet.\n\n49\n00:02:11.933 --> 00:02:12.550\n&gt;&gt; Hey!\n\n50\n00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.670\n&gt;&gt; Right there, in my list, all right.\n\n51\n00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.588\nAnd if I disable Broadcast now,\n\n52\n00:02:17.588 --> 00:02:20.870\nwe should [LAUGH] also be able\nto see that name go away.\n\n53\n00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.052\nSo I'll choose Disable,\nI'll save settings.\n\n54\n00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.648\nMaybe it's gonna save settings.\n\n55\n00:02:26.648 --> 00:02:29.620\n&gt;&gt; And while that's saving, I'll let you\nknow it just changed on mine as well.\n\n56\n00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.750\nSo I am seeing the broadcast\nnow saying Skynet.\n\n57\n00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.190\nWell, now I'm not seeing anything.\n\n58\n00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.190\n&gt;&gt; It's not, did it disappear?\n\n59\n00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.990\nIs it gone?\n\n60\n00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.860\nI still have it in my list, but\nit'd probably take a minute or two.\n\n61\n00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.250\nMy computer still\nremembers it being there.\n\n62\n00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.880\nSo it'll be a few minutes before that\ncache times out, and it goes away.\n\n63\n00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.670\nIf it wasn't there, but\nI know the network exists,\n\n64\n00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.900\nbecause my company's disabled\nthe broadcast of the SSID.\n\n65\n00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.890\nOr my friend comes over to my house and\nI've disabled that, how do they connect?\n\n66\n00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.020\nWell, it's not gonna show up in the list,\nso\n\n67\n00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.180\nthey're gonna have to manually go into\ntheir network and Internet settings.\n\n68\n00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.340\nTypically, you're gonna\ngo over here to Wi-Fi.\n\n69\n00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.330\nAnd in here,\nI should be able to click on a network.\n\n70\n00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.470\nShow available networks just\ntakes me back to that list.\n\n71\n00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.770\nManage no networks, and\nI can add a new network.\n\n72\n00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.670\nAnd this is where I\nwould type in the name.\n\n73\n00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.870\nSo I would have to get that\ninformation from the owner or\n\n74\n00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.470\noperator of the access point, type it in.\n\n75\n00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.980\nAnd I can choose connect automatically,\n\n76\n00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.790\nconnect even if this network is not\nbroadcasting, I will have to select that.\n\n77\n00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.760\nBecause I've turned the broadcast\noff on the actual device all right?\n\n78\n00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.860\nBut then I can connect to it.\n\n79\n00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.250\nIt'll connect automatically\nwhen I'm in range.\n\n80\n00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.520\nThere are some security\nconcerns with that,\n\n81\n00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.700\nreally beyond the level\nof this particular exam.\n\n82\n00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.010\nI will tell you, though,\nthat there are some issues.\n\n83\n00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.210\nRemember, turning off the broadcast to the\nSSID, in my personal opinion, doesn't give\n\n84\n00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:59.410\nme enough to warrant the inconvenience for\nthe people that I want to connect to it.\n\n85\n00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.250\nUnless I'm in a really high\nsecurity sensitive area,\n\n86\n00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.500\nmaybe I take that additional step, but\nit's not giving me a lot of protection.\n\n87\n00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.050\nIn fact,\nif I choose to connect automatically, and\n\n88\n00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.610\nconnect if it's not broadcasting, right?\n\n89\n00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.380\nWell, now what's gonna happen is when my\nlaptop comes in range of the access point,\n\n90\n00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.850\nhow does it know it's in range?\n\n91\n00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.530\nThe access point is no longer beaconing so\nit's not gonna show up and\n\n92\n00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:22.580\ngo, hey, there's Skynet.\n\n93\n00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.670\nI'm supposed to connect automatically.\n\n94\n00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.710\nSo now my laptop has to do the opposite.\n\n95\n00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.130\nIt has to holler out, hey,\nSkynet, are you out there?\n\n96\n00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.780\nHey, Skynet, are you out there?\n\n97\n00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.240\nIt could be at Starbucks 200 miles away.\n\n98\n00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.100\nMy computer is unknown.\n\n99\n00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.080\nIt's like, hey, Skynet, are you out there?\n\n100\n00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.720\nSo technically,\n\n101\n00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.800\nI'm giving away the SSID now because\nI chose to disable to SSID broadcast.\n\n102\n00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.070\nSee how that works?\n\n103\n00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.380\nSo again, my opinion,\nit's probably not something we should do\n\n104\n00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.840\nunless just certain\ncircumstances warrant it.\n\n105\n00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.041\nAll right, I'm gonna go just turn\nit back on for giggles sake, and\n\n106\n00:04:55.041 --> 00:05:00.430\nthe next thing I wanna talk about is,\nwe talked about WEP, WPA and WPA2.\n\n107\n00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.360\nWe talked about personal and enterprise.\n\n108\n00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.870\nI wanna mention a term key, we said that\na couple times in the previous episode.\n\n109\n00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.780\nWanna kinda define that again.\n\n110\n00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.620\nFor the MTA we don't have to set up\nan entire certificate infrastructure or\n\n111\n00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.830\nunderstand synchronous and\nasynchronous encryption.\n\n112\n00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.030\nBut I do want you to understand\nthe concept of a key, right?\n\n113\n00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:26.210\nBecause the key is what we\nuse to encrypt the data.\n\n114\n00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.930\nSo when we enable WEP, or we enable WPA or\n\n115\n00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.800\nWPA2, it uses an encryption algorithm,\na set of instructions on\n\n116\n00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.910\nhow to encrypt the data and\na key along with the instructions.\n\n117\n00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.470\nNow why do we use that key?\n\n118\n00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.010\nWell, because if we just use\nthe rules to encrypt it,\n\n119\n00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.710\nthe algorithm,\neverybody knows those rules.\n\n120\n00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.810\nSo anybody could decrypt my information\nif I just use the encryption algorithm\n\n121\n00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.020\nto encrypt it.\n\n122\n00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:56.120\nYou plug a key into the encryption\nalgorithm and it makes it unique to you.\n\n123\n00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.320\nHere's a really easy example.\n\n124\n00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.170\nGo out on your front porch,\nlook down the road.\n\n125\n00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:05.390\nHow many of the houses on your street\nhave locks on their front door?\n\n126\n00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.700\nProbably everybody, right?\n\n127\n00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.190\nThey all work just about the same way,\nin general.\n\n128\n00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.170\nBut I can't go to my neighbor's house and\n\n129\n00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.650\nget in because you have to\nuse a key with the lock.\n\n130\n00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.340\nEverybody has a lock, but\nwe all have our own keys.\n\n131\n00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.400\nAnd my key is the only key\nthat will unlock my lock.\n\n132\n00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.290\nIt will not unlock Peter's lock or\nanybody else's.\n\n133\n00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.790\nAnd that's what keys are when\nit comes to encryption.\n\n134\n00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.320\nIt's a simplified way of looking at it.\n\n135\n00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.630\nBut it's something that makes\nit unique to you, all right?\n\n136\n00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.510\nAnd the problem with WEP\nwas the fact that the keys,\n\n137\n00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.720\nthey could figure out what the keys were.\n\n138\n00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.360\nIf they watched enough data go by,\nthe keys started repeating.\n\n139\n00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.898\nAnd if you have repetition in\nencryption that's a very bad thing.\n\n140\n00:06:47.898 --> 00:06:51.073\nAnd so that's why WEP is no\nlonger considered secure,\n\n141\n00:06:51.073 --> 00:06:55.144\nbecause it only used a few keys, and\nwith enough time, I can figure out\n\n142\n00:06:55.144 --> 00:06:58.890\nwhat the next key was gonna be and\nI could break your encryption.\n\n143\n00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:02.140\nWPA changed how they managed the keys.\n\n144\n00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.310\nI mentioned this in the previous episode.\n\n145\n00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.320\nIt uses something called\nTemporal Key Integrity Protocol,\n\n146\n00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.420\nwhich changes the keys much more often,\nand it's a much larger key space.\n\n147\n00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.930\nThere's more keys to pick from.\n\n148\n00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:14.893\nSo now as a bad guy,\n\n149\n00:07:14.893 --> 00:07:18.642\nI've got a lot more keys to try in that\nlock before I can find the right one.\n\n150\n00:07:18.642 --> 00:07:21.330\nAnd hopefully it takes too long for\nthem to try.\n\n151\n00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.056\nBy the time they get it,\nI've already moved on to the next key,\n\n152\n00:07:24.056 --> 00:07:27.340\ncuz Temporal Key Integrity Protocol\nswitches up the keys.\n\n153\n00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.820\nLike I said, it's still not perfect,\nit does have some vulnerabilities.\n\n154\n00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:34.940\nThey can be cracked, it takes a little\nbit more time, a little bit more data.\n\n155\n00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.441\nBut same thing, we can start seeing\npatterns, and we can start breaking that.\n\n156\n00:07:38.441 --> 00:07:41.820\nWPA2 does an even better job.\n\n157\n00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.920\nIt doesn't use the same algorithms\nthat we use with WEP and WPA.\n\n158\n00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.763\nIt changes it up.\n\n159\n00:07:46.763 --> 00:07:50.210\nIt uses AES encryption,\nAdvanced Encryption Standard.\n\n160\n00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.687\nIt uses TKIP,\nthe Temporal Key Integrity Protocol.\n\n161\n00:07:53.687 --> 00:07:57.040\nAnd we typically,\nin most corporate environments,\n\n162\n00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:01.656\nuse the enterprise option anyway where\nwe're now using certificates for\n\n163\n00:08:01.656 --> 00:08:06.795\nthe authentication and then much larger\nkey space with the encryption protocol,\n\n164\n00:08:06.795 --> 00:08:09.274\nmakes it for a much more secure system.\n\n165\n00:08:09.274 --> 00:08:11.960\nAnd WPA2 is relatively secure.\n\n166\n00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.730\nI mean, all that changes over time, right?\n\n167\n00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:18.078\nComputers get more powerful and\nbad guys get more advanced.\n\n168\n00:08:18.078 --> 00:08:19.728\nBut for now, WPA2 is the way to go.\n\n169\n00:08:19.728 --> 00:08:24.510\nWPA2 Enterprise if you have the\ninfrastructure to support certificates.\n\n170\n00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:27.810\nAll right, so now we've got\nan idea of what we meant by keys.\n\n171\n00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.720\nAgain, if you want we got\nother courses in our library.\n\n172\n00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.280\nThey go into much more depth on\nencryption and how keys work.\n\n173\n00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.690\nBut that is what we need to know for\nthis particular exam.\n\n174\n00:08:37.862 --> 00:08:42.650\nAll right, we also talked about\nthe SSI ID and how we can change it.\n\n175\n00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:46.435\nAnd we wanna change it to something that\ndoesn't necessarily identify the owner,\n\n176\n00:08:46.435 --> 00:08:51.315\nunless we're in a public hot spot where we\nwant people to see it, and we can turn off\n\n177\n00:08:51.315 --> 00:08:55.595\nthe broadcast to the SSID all though it\ndoesn't get us a whole lot of security.\n\n178\n00:08:55.595 --> 00:08:59.372\nIt's more of a feeling of\nsecurity than actual security.\n\n179\n00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:02.332\nThe last thing I wanna talk about\nwith these guys, another way we\n\n180\n00:09:02.332 --> 00:09:06.792\ncan secure wireless networks is something\nknown as MAC Filters, all right?\n\n181\n00:09:06.792 --> 00:09:10.446\nHave to go back to your Network+ and\nyour basic computering,\n\n182\n00:09:10.446 --> 00:09:15.224\nand we know that all network adapters have\na MAC, a unique number assigned to it,\n\n183\n00:09:15.224 --> 00:09:19.396\nand that's that MAC address, or\nthat Media Access Control Address.\n\n184\n00:09:19.396 --> 00:09:22.340\nit's unique to every network adapter.\n\n185\n00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:29.420\nWhat I can do on my wireless access point\nis I can create a list of MAC addresses.\n\n186\n00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:36.410\nAnd then I can either choose to allow or\ndeny the list of MAC addresses, all right?\n\n187\n00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:40.860\nSo in a small home or a small shop,\na home or a small office,\n\n188\n00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.930\nI might create what we would call\na whitelist for my MAC addresses.\n\n189\n00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:47.060\nThere's only five computers in our office.\n\n190\n00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.170\nI can go to each one, pull up\na Command Prompt, get the MAC address,\n\n191\n00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:53.528\nmake my list, enter it into the access\npoint and say, allow, right?\n\n192\n00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:58.140\nAnd now only those MAC addresses\ncan connect to my access point.\n\n193\n00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:02.376\nSo even if Peter sees the SSID,\ntries to connect to it, it's gonna say,\n\n194\n00:10:02.376 --> 00:10:05.790\nyou're not on the list,\nyou're not allowed to connect.\n\n195\n00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.930\nAll right,\nI could also go to the opposite way.\n\n196\n00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:12.044\nBecause here is the downside of MAC\naddress filtering, it's a pain.\n\n197\n00:10:12.044 --> 00:10:15.970\nI've got to go and\nget every one of those MAC addresses.\n\n198\n00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:18.700\nThink about a large environment,\nhow many computers you have,\n\n199\n00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.975\nhow often do you have to\nchange out network adaptors?\n\n200\n00:10:20.975 --> 00:10:22.320\nOop, the MAC address changed.\n\n201\n00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.570\nYou gotta go update the list.\n\n202\n00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:25.800\nWho brings in a new phone every other day?\n\n203\n00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.680\nMaybe you got an employee showing\nup with a new phone, a new tablet.\n\n204\n00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.310\nThat has to be added to the list or\nit will not connect to the access point.\n\n205\n00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:35.690\nAnd most access points maintain\nthat list individually.\n\n206\n00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:39.440\nSo if I have more than one access point,\nI have to modify that list on each one.\n\n207\n00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.510\nIt's not centrally managed,\n\n208\n00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:45.830\nand it becomes logistically a lot\nof work to try to maintain.\n\n209\n00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:49.810\nI could go the other route and\nuse a blacklist, same thing.\n\n210\n00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:52.410\nI just get MAC addresses,\nbut I choose Deny.\n\n211\n00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:55.520\nSo if your MAC address is on that list,\nyou get denied.\n\n212\n00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.050\nWe'll do this.\n\n213\n00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:57.385\nIf we've got a problem person,\n\n214\n00:10:57.385 --> 00:10:59.812\nsomebody that I keep seeing\nsitting out in my parking lot.\n\n215\n00:10:59.812 --> 00:11:03.940\nI've told them to not use my wireless\naccess but somehow they've been given\n\n216\n00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:08.300\nthe password or they've broken\nthe password and they keep connecting.\n\n217\n00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.220\nI can add their MAC address to my list and\nchoose Deny.\n\n218\n00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.360\nAnd now they won't be able to connect\ncuz their MAC address is on the deny\n\n219\n00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.580\nlist, all right?\n\n220\n00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:17.760\nSo sometimes it might be\neasier to do a blacklist,\n\n221\n00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.330\nor a deny list, than to do an allow list.\n\n222\n00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.160\nAn allow list you've gotta\nconstantly update and\n\n223\n00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.895\nmaintain every time new devices,\nnew authorized devices come in.\n\n224\n00:11:26.895 --> 00:11:30.200\nBlacklist, you just keep adding\nanybody you discover in logs.\n\n225\n00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.460\nHey, this IP address is keep scanning our\nsystems, I'm gonna put it on the blacklist\n\n226\n00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.060\nso it can't connect to\nthe access point anymore, right?\n\n227\n00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:41.840\nSo that's something we can do within\nour access point software and\n\n228\n00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.760\nI'll show you how to do it in a second.\n\n229\n00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:48.330\nUnfortunately, though, I have to also say,\nthere's a down side to this one as well.\n\n230\n00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.880\nBesides the administration effort\nrequired, here's the problem.\n\n231\n00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:57.900\nWhen a device connects to an access point,\nthere is certain information that's\n\n232\n00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.720\nincluded in the packet that\nit sends to the connection.\n\n233\n00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.560\nAnd all packets thereafter\nactually have this information.\n\n234\n00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.650\nOne of the bits of information\nin there is the MAC address\n\n235\n00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:09.420\nof the device that's connecting.\n\n236\n00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.970\nSo let's say my laptop\nis on the blacklist.\n\n237\n00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:12.690\nIt's not allowed.\n\n238\n00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:16.180\nMy MAC address has been seen,\nit's been logged, and they've added it and\n\n239\n00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:18.090\nthey've denied it.\n\n240\n00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:21.160\nOkay, so all I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna open up my network sniffer,\n\n241\n00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.250\nmy wireless packet capture utility.\n\n242\n00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:27.060\nI'm gonna wait until an authorized\nuser connects to the access point.\n\n243\n00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:30.190\nThey walk by, they're sitting in the park\nwith their laptop, or wherever they're at.\n\n244\n00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.370\nThey're outside on the smoking area.\n\n245\n00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.480\nAll I gotta do is to capture some packets.\n\n246\n00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.120\nI can see their MAC address,\nI know it's on the allow list.\n\n247\n00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.700\nNow I can go to my computer,\n\n248\n00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:44.880\nchange my MAC address to their MAC\naddress, and now I'm gonna be allowed.\n\n249\n00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.630\nEven if the packets are encrypted,\nthe MAC address is not.\n\n250\n00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:50.200\nIt has to be in the unencrypted\npart of the packet for\n\n251\n00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.100\nthe access point to be able to read it.\n\n252\n00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:58.120\nAnd so unfortunately, it's one of those\nthings just like with the SSID broadcast.\n\n253\n00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:02.960\nIt will stop the casual passersbys and\nthe casual actors.\n\n254\n00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.230\nThis will stop them because they're\nnot gonna be able to connect and\n\n255\n00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:06.810\nthey're gonna give up.\n\n256\n00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:09.740\nIf the bad guy really\nwants into your network,\n\n257\n00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.610\nthere are ways around MAC\naddress filtering, all right?\n\n258\n00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:17.130\nBut we always talk about security in\nlayers and adding multiple hurdles\n\n259\n00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.200\nbecause while maybe they're\nreally good at one technique,\n\n260\n00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.500\nthey're not so good at another\ntechnique and they can't get past it.\n\n261\n00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.160\nOr they set off some kind of alarm\nevery time they have to jump\n\n262\n00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.210\nthrough some hurdle,\nit makes noise on our network.\n\n263\n00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:33.864\nAnd maybe I notice that and catch them\nbefore they make it all the way in,\n\n264\n00:13:33.864 --> 00:13:34.880\nall right?\n\n265\n00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.910\nSo MAC address filtering,\none of those things we can do.\n\n266\n00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:41.680\nIt's not the end all in security but\nit can definitely be a help.\n\n267\n00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.880\nLet me show you where we can do that.\n\n268\n00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:47.509\nOn this particular access point,\nI believe this is gonna be under,\n\n269\n00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:50.048\nlet's see, access restrictions?\n\n270\n00:13:50.048 --> 00:13:55.130\nNo, application gaming?\n\n271\n00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:56.450\nNo.\n&gt;&gt; That's the important thing to know here\n\n272\n00:13:56.450 --> 00:14:00.700\nis every router, every access point's\ngonna have a little bit different setup,\n\n273\n00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.590\nif it's Belkin, if it's Linksys.\n\n274\n00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:06.150\nWell, actually, we talked about that\nearlier, those are actually the same now.\n\n275\n00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.580\nSo keep those in mind, and\nmaybe check out a couple of them,\n\n276\n00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.240\nif you're trying to figure\nout how this works.\n\n277\n00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I know Linksys, for\none, has a webpage you can go to and\n\n278\n00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:15.529\nget simulations for\nall their different devices.\n\n279\n00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:20.114\nBut yeah, just Google, or\nBing whichever access point you have.\n\n280\n00:14:20.114 --> 00:14:22.440\nSo here I can see, let me zoom in.\n\n281\n00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:26.900\nOn my Wireless tab, I have\nWireless MAC Filter, I'll zoom back out,\n\n282\n00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.480\nI'm gonna click on that little tab.\n\n283\n00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.750\nAnd here is my list.\n\n284\n00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:34.250\nAnd you can see at the top\nI've got enabled, disabled,\n\n285\n00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:38.500\nprevent PCs from accessing\nthe wireless network, permit PCs.\n\n286\n00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:42.270\nSo the enabled, disabled is simply gonna\nturn on MAC filtering capabilities.\n\n287\n00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:45.800\nYou'll see everything lit up,\nit's no longer grayed out.\n\n288\n00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.030\nSo I can turn on the capability.\n\n289\n00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:53.300\nOnce I've turned it on, do I wanna make\na list to prevent PCs or to permit PCs?\n\n290\n00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.090\nAnd I would need the MAC address.\n\n291\n00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:57.990\nSo what I could do is I could\nopen up a command prompt.\n\n292\n00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:04.450\nDo a little IP configs, switch all,\nfind my network adaptor.\n\n293\n00:15:05.493 --> 00:15:08.870\nI wanna make sure I got the right one.\n\n294\n00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:12.440\nI want one of my virtual adapters,\nso it's this one here.\n\n295\n00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.870\nAnd here is my physical address.\n\n296\n00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:19.930\nSo I'm gonna copy that,\nthat's my MAC address.\n\n297\n00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:24.440\nI believe that's the right one.\n\n298\n00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.640\nAlways says he's connected,\nyeah, he's connected to ITProTV.\n\n299\n00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:32.180\nAnd then I'm gonna go back\nover to my Linksys page.\n\n300\n00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:37.050\nAnd I'm going to come in here and\npaste that address in there.\n\n301\n00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:41.620\nAnd I'm going to leave it on prevent so\nyou can see what I've done.\n\n302\n00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:44.930\nI've pasted that MAC address in there,\nand I've left it on prevent.\n\n303\n00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.110\nNow my MAC address format is incorrect.\n\n304\n00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:51.220\nAll right, we will type it in.\n\n305\n00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:54.775\nSometimes with pasting you get\na few extra characters there.\n\n306\n00:15:54.775 --> 00:15:57.671\nSo let's see what we've got here.\n\n307\n00:15:57.671 --> 00:15:59.752\nLet me go 00.\n\n308\n00:15:59.752 --> 00:16:01.196\nIt's gonna make me put the characters in.\n\n309\n00:16:01.196 --> 00:16:04.950\nWe're gonna try 56C00001.\n\n310\n00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:11.070\nUsually you don't have to put the colons\nin there, it will assume those.\n\n311\n00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:13.080\nThere we go.\n\n312\n00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:21.390\nAnd now I'm on the list and\nit's set to prevent, all right.\n\n313\n00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:23.310\nAnd I did save my changes so\nwe should be good to go.\n\n314\n00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:28.890\nSo now what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna disconnect from ITPRO.TV and\n\n315\n00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:33.900\ntry to connect to,\nI think I'm still beaconing, yeah, Skynet.\n\n316\n00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.290\nIt's open so there's no security.\n\n317\n00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:39.699\nI'll click Connect, and\nwe'll see what happens.\n\n318\n00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.900\nHopefully it'll block me.\n\n319\n00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:47.910\nSometimes it takes a minute for it to\nkick in, but I think we should be good.\n\n320\n00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:50.577\nIt's taking it's sweet time here.\n\n321\n00:16:50.577 --> 00:16:53.947\nSo you can see if I zoom in,\nit's attempting to connect.\n\n322\n00:16:57.097 --> 00:16:58.130\nAnd it just went away.\n\n323\n00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:04.620\nAnd yeah, Skynet 3, no Internet access.\n\n324\n00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:05.910\nNo Internet, Open.\n\n325\n00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:10.301\nSo it's not allowing me\nto actually connect and\n\n326\n00:17:10.301 --> 00:17:13.717\ngo anywhere with that access point.\n\n327\n00:17:13.717 --> 00:17:17.520\n&gt;&gt; And on the flip side,\nI see it here and it looks fine for me.\n\n328\n00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.610\nBecause my Mac address\nhasn't been blocked.\n\n329\n00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:22.130\n&gt;&gt; I didn't add you to the list,\nexactly, right.\n\n330\n00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:22.950\n&gt;&gt; I appreciate that.\n\n331\n00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:23.478\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome.\n\n332\n00:17:23.478 --> 00:17:27.380\n[LAUGH] All right, and now I'm gonna\ntake myself, I'm gonna disable that.\n\n333\n00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:30.350\nTake myself off of that list for now.\n\n334\n00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:32.688\nI'll end up resetting this\nguy here in a minute.\n\n335\n00:17:32.688 --> 00:17:37.170\nSo again, the key there to remember is MAC\naddress filtering is a security technique\n\n336\n00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:39.320\nthat I can use on wireless access points.\n\n337\n00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:43.440\nIt simply requires me to get the MAC\naddress of the device I want to allow.\n\n338\n00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.750\nRemember that's network adapter specific.\n\n339\n00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:50.100\nIf there's more than one network adapter,\nyou would have to add each one,\n\n340\n00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.530\nor get the Mac address for each one.\n\n341\n00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:53.570\nAnd then I can either choose to allow\n\n342\n00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:57.980\nthe Mac addresses on the list or\ndeny the Mac addresses on the list.\n\n343\n00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:01.670\nThe downside of Mac address filtering\nis administratively it's a lot of work\n\n344\n00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:03.840\nbecause I've got to keep\nthat list up to date.\n\n345\n00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.330\nIf we're doing the allow option people are\ngonna bring in devices that haven't been\n\n346\n00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:10.150\nthere before, they're gonna complain they\ncan't connect, you got to bring me your\n\n347\n00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:13.680\ndevice, I got to get your Mac address,\nI've got to add you to the list.\n\n348\n00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.755\nIf I have more than one access point,\nI get to add it to all the access points.\n\n349\n00:18:17.755 --> 00:18:21.480\nThe prevents, it will block people, but\n\n350\n00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.520\nalso keep in mind that Mac\naddresses can be spoofed.\n\n351\n00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:28.610\nSo all I need to do is figure\nout what devices are allowed,\n\n352\n00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:32.870\nchange my Mac address to that, and\nI'll still be able to connect.\n\n353\n00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:36.900\nAnd I tell you these things, again, not to\nmake you think, gosh well wireless is so\n\n354\n00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:38.930\ninsecure, why even bother?\n\n355\n00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:43.130\nBecause as long as you're aware of it,\nyou'll know what the weaknesses are and\n\n356\n00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:44.615\nwe can combine methods.\n\n357\n00:18:44.615 --> 00:18:48.250\nAnd if MAC address filtering\nis not my only method,\n\n358\n00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:50.190\nit can definitely help keep me secure.\n\n359\n00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:54.350\nBecause it does stop\nthe casual passersbys and\n\n360\n00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:56.120\nthe wanna be hackers and things like that.\n\n361\n00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.890\nAnd that's a good step.\n\n362\n00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:59.665\nIt's not gonna keep out the black hats.\n\n363\n00:18:59.665 --> 00:19:03.350\nBut in the end it's kinda like people say,\n\n364\n00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:06.770\nif somebody wants to break into your\nhouse, they're gonna break into your\n\n365\n00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:09.590\nhouse, no matter what kinds of locks\nyou have and windows you have.\n\n366\n00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:11.372\nGiven enough time and\neffort, they can get in, and\n\n367\n00:19:11.372 --> 00:19:13.123\nit's the same thing with\nour wireless networks.\n\n368\n00:19:13.123 --> 00:19:18.051\nBut we can definitely slow them down and\nmake them take more time and more effort,\n\n369\n00:19:18.051 --> 00:19:22.580\nand hopefully more time and more effort\nis more than they want to put in.\n\n370\n00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.040\nThe payoff is not big enough,\n\n371\n00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.040\nand they're going to go on to\nthe next easier target, all right.\n\n372\n00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:31.280\nSo when it comes to wireless security,\na lot of things to consider.\n\n373\n00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.610\nYou gotta think about the one thing\nI didn't do was turn on the security.\n\n374\n00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:38.990\nLet me go over to the security tab,\nI'm sorry the wireless tab, and\n\n375\n00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:41.540\nthen take a look at my wireless security.\n\n376\n00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:45.740\nRemember I think I showed you the list but\nI didn't actually turn anything on.\n\n377\n00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:49.290\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nturn on WPA personal.\n\n378\n00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:50.830\nAll right, and\n\n379\n00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:55.360\nit tells me that it's going to drop down\nto G, that's just this particular adapter.\n\n380\n00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:59.182\nAnd once I turn it on to WAP personal,\nlook what I get.\n\n381\n00:19:59.182 --> 00:20:01.060\nAn option to put a pass phrase.\n\n382\n00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.670\nAnd now once I put that in there and\nsave my settings,\n\n383\n00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:07.210\nanybody that wants to connect to the\naccess point will need that pass phrase.\n\n384\n00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:12.000\nAll right, if I go to WPA2, personal.\n\n385\n00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.470\nNot gonna see a whole lot of difference\nhere because it's still just based\n\n386\n00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:16.010\non password.\n\n387\n00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:18.380\nIt is the background using\ndifferent encryption and\n\n388\n00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:22.670\nit is stronger than WPA, but\nit's still just using a pass phrase.\n\n389\n00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:30.050\nIf I go to enterprise, You'll see\nthe options are a little bit different.\n\n390\n00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:34.845\nNow all of a sudden I have RADIUS server\nIP address, port, and shared secret.\n\n391\n00:20:34.845 --> 00:20:38.980\nAnd we're going to talk in another\nepisode a lot about what RADIUS is.\n\n392\n00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:42.210\nThe short answer is,\nwe're telling the access point, look,\n\n393\n00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:45.370\nyou're no longer responsible for\nchecking passwords.\n\n394\n00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:47.530\nYou just take the information,\n\n395\n00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:52.140\nsend it over the RADIUS server that\nI've entered in here, let them do it.\n\n396\n00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:53.872\nAnd the RADIUS server will tell you,\n\n397\n00:20:53.872 --> 00:20:56.830\nMr Access Point,\nwhether to allow them or not.\n\n398\n00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:59.830\nSo we're moving the authentication\nprocess off of the access point\n\n399\n00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:03.702\nwhich is usually a good thing because\nthe access point are, especially this one,\n\n400\n00:21:03.702 --> 00:21:07.310\nit's relative inexpensive, doesn't have\na huge amount of processing power, and\n\n401\n00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:09.490\nit's exposed so people can hack on it.\n\n402\n00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:14.070\nThat RADIUS server's gonna be back behind\nmy firewall, much beefier security on\n\n403\n00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:17.770\nthat, a lot more difficult for the bad\nguys to try to access and attempt to hack.\n\n404\n00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.800\nBut we usually don't have RADIUS\nservers sitting around at home,\n\n405\n00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.990\nso that's why we call this one Enterprise.\n\n406\n00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:26.920\nSo hopefully that'll give you some\ninformation you need to, one,\n\n407\n00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:32.440\nsecure your wireless network at home and\nat work, as well as pass the MTA exam.\n\n408\n00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.640\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good, Mike, I appreciate it.\n\n409\n00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.750\nAnd if there's anything that\nyou didn't hear in that one,\n\n410\n00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:37.520\nmake sure you went back and\nwatched the part one.\n\n411\n00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.690\nCuz we did have two parts of that episode\nwith a lot of great information on\n\n412\n00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:41.560\nsetting all those up.\n\n413\n00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.550\nAnd what the benefits of\nthe different types of security are.\n\n414\n00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:47.260\nSo go back and check that for\nsure, but that's gonna wrap up for\n\n415\n00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:48.130\nwireless security.\n\n416\n00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:51.110\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap up this episode as well.\n\n417\n00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:54.310\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI have been your host Peter VanRysdam.\n\n418\n00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:55.090\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n419\n00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:57.117\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you next time.\n\n420\n00:21:57.117 --> 00:22:03.516\n[MUSIC]\n\n421\n00:22:03.516 --> 00:22:06.757\n&gt;&gt; Thank

00:00:08.195\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.195 --> 00:00:12.158\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV\n&gt;&gt; Hello and\n\n5\n00:00:12.158 --> 00:00:15.422\nwelcome to ITProTV,\nI'm your host Peter VanRysdam and\n\n6\n00:00:15.422 --> 00:00:19.381\ntoday we are continuing our series\non MTA security fundamentals and\n\n7\n00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:22.570\nspecifically in this episode\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna be talking about\n\n8\n00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.150\nuser authentication.\n\n9\n00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.280\nAnd here to help us understand\neverything that goes into that,\n\n10\n00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.550\nwe have Mr Mike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.700\nMike, how are you doing?\n\n12\n00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.310\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, thanks for having me\nback, and yeah excited, cuz we're getting\n\n13\n00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.990\ninto that authentication portion,\nwhich is always fun to talk about.\n\n14\n00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.760\nSo yeah, when we're talking about\nbasic concepts when it comes to.\n\n15\n00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.210\n&gt;&gt; User authentication.\n\n16\n00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.779\nAnd the first big thing I wanna talk about\nis something known as the triple A or AAA.\n\n17\n00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:50.520\nAnd I know Peter's gonna say you mean\nthey're gonna come tow our car for us?\n\n18\n00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n19\n00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.370\n&gt;&gt; No, no not that triple A, right?\n\n20\n00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.840\nFor those of you that are in the US.\n\n21\n00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.010\nFor those of you that are not triple\nA is a service you can get to come give\n\n22\n00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.950\nyou a free a tow or battery or\ngas if you run out.\n\n23\n00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.830\nAnyway, that's not what\nwe're here to talk about it.\n\n24\n00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.630\nWe are here to talk about authentication,\nauthorization and accounting.\n\n25\n00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.350\nThat is the triple A of which we speak.\n\n26\n00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.580\nNow the other day in another episode\nwe talked about the CIA triad.\n\n27\n00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.480\nAnd we said that was the foundation or\nthe goals of security\n\n28\n00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.570\nis to provide that confidentiality,\nintegrity and availability.\n\n29\n00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.850\nAnd this is another and we're gonna\ncall it an access control model.\n\n30\n00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.530\nAnd it's a pretty standard\none that we try to follow.\n\n31\n00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.440\nAnd again, AAA is authentication,\nauthorization and accounting.\n\n32\n00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.320\nAnd we need to make sure that we\nunderstand what those terms mean.\n\n33\n00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.610\nAnd believe it or not,\nsometimes there is some confusion there.\n\n34\n00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.490\nSo let's break it down.\n\n35\n00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.310\nWe're gonna start with authentication,\npretty straight forward.\n\n36\n00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.560\nAuthentication is proving your identity,\nor verifying\n\n37\n00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.690\nthe identity of someone or something\ndoesn't necessarily have to be a person.\n\n38\n00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.940\nWe could be talking about a computer\nthat's being authenticated.\n\n39\n00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.170\nFor example, when you go to your\nmachine at work and you turn it on,\n\n40\n00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.720\nbefore you ever get the dialog box to\nlog in your computer has to log in.\n\n41\n00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.900\nIt's gonna be talking to servers on\nyour network assuming you're running\n\n42\n00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.100\na domain and\nit's gonna authenticate with that.\n\n43\n00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.710\nVerify that it did has right password and\ncan connect to the network and resources.\n\n44\n00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:14.870\nAnd then you get to log on.\n\n45\n00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.120\nSo remember when we think about\nauthentication we're not talking about\n\n46\n00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.880\njust users computers, services have to\nauthenticate when they reach out and\n\n47\n00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.610\ntalk to other machines,\nand access resources.\n\n48\n00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.170\nSo authentication in general is verifying\nthe identity of someone, or something.\n\n49\n00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.300\nAnd we'll talk about how we can\ndo that in just a little bit.\n\n50\n00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.270\nSo that's authentication.\n\n51\n00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.580\nThen we have authorization, and this is\nwhere people sometimes get confused cuz\n\n52\n00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.320\nthey'll try to use authentication and\nauthorization interchangeably, or\n\n53\n00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.980\nmaybe not really understand\nthe difference between the two, and\n\n54\n00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.670\nI wanna make sure that we do.\n\n55\n00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.770\nAuthorization is\ndetermining what rights or\n\n56\n00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.440\npermissions you have over resource, right?\n\n57\n00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.540\nCan you read this file?\n\n58\n00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.230\nCan you make changes to this file?\n\n59\n00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.520\nCan you create new files in this folder?\n\n60\n00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.940\nAre you allowed to log on to the system?\n\n61\n00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.690\nAre you allowed to reboot the system or\ndo Windows updates?\n\n62\n00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.670\nThose kind of things,\nthat's what authorization is about.\n\n63\n00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.280\nIs determining what rights or\npermissions you have of a resource.\n\n64\n00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.490\nAn important little note\nthat we need to make here,\n\n65\n00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.770\nwe cannot authorize somebody until\nafter they're authenticated.\n\n66\n00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.510\nThink about that for a second, right?\n\n67\n00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.600\nIf I'm gonna authorize you, and decide\nwhat rights or permissions I should give\n\n68\n00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.490\nyou over this resource,\nI have to know who you are first, right?\n\n69\n00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.740\nIf I don't know who you are how\ncan I determine what rights or\n\n70\n00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.410\npermissions you have?\n\n71\n00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.140\nAnd so that's the same thing when\nwe talk about information security,\n\n72\n00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.320\nauthentication comes first.\n\n73\n00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.990\nOnce you're authenticated and\nwe know who you are,\n\n74\n00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.660\nnow we can determine what your permissions\nare, and what rights you have.\n\n75\n00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.130\nAnd we can authorize you, right?\n\n76\n00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.050\nAnd then the last A in\nthe triple A is accounting.\n\n77\n00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.010\nDepending on what you read,\nit might be accounting,\n\n78\n00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.870\nit might be auditing,\nall meaning the same thing.\n\n79\n00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.050\nBut accounting or\nauditing is keeping track of what's going.\n\n80\n00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.010\nWho logged onto that system at what time?\n\n81\n00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.694\nWho made a change to that file,\nor who deleted that resource, or\n\n82\n00:04:09.694 --> 00:04:14.214\nwho created that new group in active\ndirectory or that new user on your laptop?\n\n83\n00:04:14.214 --> 00:04:15.810\nWho made that.\n\n84\n00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.960\nThat's what accounting is all about.\n\n85\n00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.120\nWhat time you made that VPN connection.\n\n86\n00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.370\nHow long you stayed connected.\n\n87\n00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.440\nHow much bandwidth.\n\n88\n00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.250\nWe can determine what\nit is we wanna audit.\n\n89\n00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.590\nBut when we talk about access control\nthose are the big things we deal with.\n\n90\n00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.865\nAuthentication, authorization and\naccounting.\n\n91\n00:04:32.865 --> 00:04:36.980\nAnd as far as access control\ngoes accounting might be.\n\n92\n00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.460\nThe guard at the front desk that checks\neverybody in as they come through, right?\n\n93\n00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.980\nHe's accounting, he's keeping\ntrack of who entered the building,\n\n94\n00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.180\nhow long they stayed, what time they left,\nwho were they here to see.\n\n95\n00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.880\nI mean, that's accounting, right?\n\n96\n00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.780\nSo that's our triple A, Authentication,\nauthorization and accounting.\n\n97\n00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:01.000\nNow, the next term is one that's, well,\nI'll just say, it's non-repudiation.\n\n98\n00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.951\nEverybody say it with me.\n\n99\n00:05:01.951 --> 00:05:04.290\nNon-repudiation.\n\n100\n00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.170\n&gt;&gt; That's a fun one to say.\n\n101\n00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:06.400\n&gt;&gt; It is a fun one to say, right?\n\n102\n00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.648\nI don't know why,\nit makes me think of Rumpelstiltskin.\n\n103\n00:05:07.648 --> 00:05:12.405\nBut non-repudiation is when you can't deny\n\n104\n00:05:12.405 --> 00:05:17.210\nthat you carried out a specific action.\n\n105\n00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.640\nLike if I digitally sign an email and\nthen send it to you.\n\n106\n00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.045\nI can't deny that I sent the email\nbecause it has my digital signature on\n\n107\n00:05:25.045 --> 00:05:25.857\nthere, right?\n\n108\n00:05:25.857 --> 00:05:29.290\nSo, when we talk about providing for\nnon repudiation.\n\n109\n00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:34.230\nWe're talking about being able to\nverify the identity of the sender or,\n\n110\n00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.140\nmaybe, of the creator.\n\n111\n00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:41.250\nOr of who modified a file,\nthat is known as non repudiation,\n\n112\n00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.900\ncannot deny that the actions\nwere carried out, all right?\n\n113\n00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.400\nAnd it's something that we really wanna\nthink about when we talk about security,\n\n114\n00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.190\nand we talk about some of the things\nthat people do, they'll share passwords.\n\n115\n00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.090\nIt's like, hey, I need to log on real\nquick, can I just get your password,\n\n116\n00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.130\ncuz I know you have\naccess to that resource.\n\n117\n00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.340\nWell, we always know sharing\npasswords is bad right?\n\n118\n00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.300\nWhy?\n\n119\n00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.120\nWell because of a couple things.\n\n120\n00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.910\nIf I give my password to Peter.\n\n121\n00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.430\nPeter can now log on to the system as me.\n\n122\n00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.010\nDoes the system have any way of knowing\nit's not actually me at the keyboard.\n\n123\n00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.400\nRight, he used my username and\nmy password, so\n\n124\n00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.420\naccording to the system\nhe is me at this point.\n\n125\n00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.830\nHe has all the rights and permissions that\nI would have over whatever resources, and\n\n126\n00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.840\nany changes or anything he does when\nwe talk about the accounting part,\n\n127\n00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.190\nright, is not going to be Peter\nmade a change to this file,\n\n128\n00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.540\nPeter deleted that entire folder of\nISOs It's gonna be me on the line.\n\n129\n00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.640\nAnd I'm gonna have a difficult time\nsaying it wasn't me until I fess up and\n\n130\n00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.390\nsay, I shared my password.\n\n131\n00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.560\nAnd even then, Peter could deny it.\n\n132\n00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.290\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; And I would have a tough time, unless I\n\n133\n00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.780\nhad camera footage of where I was in\ntimestamps, have a tough time denying it.\n\n134\n00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.100\nSo something to think about when we\ntalk about sharing passwords, and\n\n135\n00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.290\nwhy that's bad.\n\n136\n00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:57.680\nThis is why, because the systems use\nthat authentication that we go through\n\n137\n00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.750\nis what determines our authorization.\n\n138\n00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:04.312\nAnd if we start sharing passwords, now\nwe're bypassing all the security measures\n\n139\n00:07:04.312 --> 00:07:08.172\nthat IT has put in place as far as\nrestricting what Peter has access to.\n\n140\n00:07:08.172 --> 00:07:13.143\nAnd the accounting part get's all thrown\nout because now it's gonna be logged as me\n\n141\n00:07:13.143 --> 00:07:15.710\naccessing those resources and not Peter.\n\n142\n00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.290\nAll right, moving down our list\nmulti factor authentication.\n\n143\n00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:26.480\nPeter I'm guessing you can probably\nfigure out what that means, right?\n\n144\n00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think I've definitely\ndealt with this on my banking and\n\n145\n00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.600\nthings like that where you first put\nin a password and then you have to\n\n146\n00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.410\nclick on the picture or something\nthat you've selected in the past.\n\n147\n00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.060\nOr something with your\nphone number I've even had\n\n148\n00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.750\nyou get a text message with a pin\nnumber then that you have to put in.\n\n149\n00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:45.775\nBut I guess if there's two stage,\nthere's multi stage but.\n\n150\n00:07:45.775 --> 00:07:48.398\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Can I have that works a little bit.\n\n151\n00:07:48.398 --> 00:07:51.205\n&gt;&gt; Sure, all right let's talk about it cuz\nyou nailed it right on the head there.\n\n152\n00:07:51.205 --> 00:07:52.470\nMulti-factor authentication.\n\n153\n00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.670\nWhen we talk about authenticating,\nwe can talk about the factor.\n\n154\n00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:58.615\nWhat is it that we\nare using to authenticate?\n\n155\n00:07:58.615 --> 00:08:02.112\nMultifactor authentication means we're\ngonna to use more than one factor.\n\n156\n00:08:02.112 --> 00:08:05.768\nYou could do as Peter said, we could\ndo 2-factor authentication, 3-factor,\n\n157\n00:08:05.768 --> 00:08:09.770\n4-factor, 25-factor, I mean,\nit gets a little ridiculous at some point.\n\n158\n00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:12.903\nThere's really not that many factors we\ncan use, I'm just exaggerating there.\n\n159\n00:08:12.903 --> 00:08:16.399\nBut you could specify\n2-factor authentication, or\n\n160\n00:08:16.399 --> 00:08:18.700\n3-factor authentication.\n\n161\n00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:23.130\nMost of us will just say Multi-factor,\nmeaning more than one all right?\n\n162\n00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.775\nSo, before we can really discuss that\nany further, though, we need to know,\n\n163\n00:08:25.775 --> 00:08:27.394\nwhat are these factors\nyou're talking about?\n\n164\n00:08:27.394 --> 00:08:30.070\nWhat can we use to authenticate?\n\n165\n00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:33.630\nThere's three classes that we can use for\nauthentication, or\n\n166\n00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.340\nfactors of authentication.\n\n167\n00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:40.480\nSomething you know, something you have,\nand something you are all right.\n\n168\n00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.920\nNow, something you know would be\nsomething like a password, right?\n\n169\n00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:48.040\nHopefully, only you know your password,\nyou're able to type that password in.\n\n170\n00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.740\nAnd because, supposedly,\n\n171\n00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.075\nyou're the only one that knows\nthat password, it can identify.\n\n172\n00:08:53.075 --> 00:08:56.685\nIt must be Mike cuz Mike typed\nin the appropriate password.\n\n173\n00:08:56.685 --> 00:09:01.695\nSo we're basing authentication on\nsomething that the user knows.\n\n174\n00:09:01.695 --> 00:09:03.555\nA password, a pass phrase.\n\n175\n00:09:03.555 --> 00:09:07.224\nA pin number would also be\nsomething that you know.\n\n176\n00:09:07.224 --> 00:09:10.449\nNow, passwords have been used for\nauthentication for years and\n\n177\n00:09:10.449 --> 00:09:11.600\nyears and years.\n\n178\n00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.860\nAnd they're still one of the most\ncommon forms of authentication.\n\n179\n00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:21.530\nIt is also, probably, one of the weakest\nforms of authentication that we could use.\n\n180\n00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:25.713\nBecause it is based on something we know,\nand we usually let the users determine\n\n181\n00:09:25.713 --> 00:09:29.961\nwhat their password is going to be, and\nteaching them how to make strong, long,\n\n182\n00:09:29.961 --> 00:09:32.787\nrememberable passwords is\nsometimes challenging.\n\n183\n00:09:32.787 --> 00:09:37.529\nBut we still use them even though we\nknow they're very vulnerable to many\n\n184\n00:09:37.529 --> 00:09:39.483\ndifferent types of attacks.\n\n185\n00:09:39.483 --> 00:09:44.695\nWe still use passwords more than anything\nelse because of the convenience of them.\n\n186\n00:09:44.695 --> 00:09:47.755\nThere's no extra equipment to\nsupport the use of passwords.\n\n187\n00:09:47.755 --> 00:09:51.640\nYou've got In a Windows environment,\nwe've got our Active Directory.\n\n188\n00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:55.090\nThere's a database that stores user\nname and password information in there.\n\n189\n00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.970\nAnd when you go to log on,\nyou just have to type it in.\n\n190\n00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:01.085\nAnd you can connect or you can be\nauthenticated and then authorized.\n\n191\n00:10:01.085 --> 00:10:05.521\nSo there's not a lot of extra management\ninvolved and things like that so\n\n192\n00:10:05.521 --> 00:10:07.910\nit's really easy to implement.\n\n193\n00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:10.060\nIt's built into our operating systems.\n\n194\n00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.986\nSo that´s why we still use\nthem in a lot of places.\n\n195\n00:10:12.986 --> 00:10:14.831\nBut as I said they are very,\n\n196\n00:10:14.831 --> 00:10:19.010\nvery vulnerable to several\ndifferent types of attacks.\n\n197\n00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.657\nThe first is just humans loving\nto share their passwords or\n\n198\n00:10:21.657 --> 00:10:24.046\nnot having a problem with\nsharing their passwords.\n\n199\n00:10:24.046 --> 00:10:28.554\nWe also like to write them down and stick\nthem to our monitor or write them down and\n\n200\n00:10:28.554 --> 00:10:30.455\nstick them under your keyboard.\n\n201\n00:10:30.455 --> 00:10:35.088\nI remember one time, this was years ago, I\nread a study on a US government building.\n\n202\n00:10:35.088 --> 00:10:39.900\nThey found 70% of passwords\nwithin three feet of keyboard.\n\n203\n00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.847\nSo taped to the monitor, in the desk\ndrawer, right around that area.\n\n204\n00:10:43.847 --> 00:10:47.550\nAnd we talked about physical security.\n\n205\n00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:51.771\nIf I can get in the office before everyone\nelse comes in they'll say I'm an employee\n\n206\n00:10:51.771 --> 00:10:54.082\nbut I'm just wanna get malicious purposes.\n\n207\n00:10:54.082 --> 00:10:56.009\nAnd I can just get in\nbefore Peter gets there,\n\n208\n00:10:56.009 --> 00:10:59.422\nrummage around his desk a little bit,\nand probably find his password, right?\n\n209\n00:10:59.422 --> 00:11:03.915\n&gt;&gt; That's literally as bad as leaving the\nkeys to the file cabinet in the keyhole.\n\n210\n00:11:03.915 --> 00:11:05.786\nAnd that's basically what you're\ndoing when you're just putting\n\n211\n00:11:05.786 --> 00:11:06.585\nyour password right there.\n\n212\n00:11:06.585 --> 00:11:09.850\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely and again,\nif I find his password, login as him and\n\n213\n00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:14.000\ndo something bad, guess who's gonna\nget called in the office first?\n\n214\n00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:14.529\nIt's not me,\n\n215\n00:11:14.529 --> 00:11:17.542\nit's gonna be Peter because he's the one\nthat's gonna show up in the log files.\n\n216\n00:11:17.542 --> 00:11:19.896\nAll right, so sharing them,\nwriting them down,\n\n217\n00:11:19.896 --> 00:11:22.480\nthat's obviously some vulnerabilities.\n\n218\n00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.950\nWe can also crack passwords, right?\n\n219\n00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:27.538\nThe bad guys will use a couple different\ntechniques to try to break your password.\n\n220\n00:11:27.538 --> 00:11:30.320\nThey wanna get in as you,\nwell, what do they need?\n\n221\n00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.220\nThey need your username and\nthey need your password.\n\n222\n00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:36.580\nUnfortunately usernames are typically\nvery easy to figure out because a company\n\n223\n00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.290\nfollows a standard.\n\n224\n00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:40.880\nThey come up with some\nkinda naming convention.\n\n225\n00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:45.220\nFirst initial last name or\njust first name @ITProTV.\n\n226\n00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.930\nAnd so\nas long as I know okay his name is Peter.\n\n227\n00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:52.240\nI'm going to say 99% chance that his login\ninformation is Peter @ITProTV, right.\n\n228\n00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.600\nSo those are usually\npretty easy to determine.\n\n229\n00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.920\nBut then the other fact,\n\n230\n00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.790\nthe other piece I need to authenticate\nis going to be the password.\n\n231\n00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:04.191\nAnd for the password attacks, I could do\nwhat we call password guessing, right?\n\n232\n00:12:04.191 --> 00:12:07.623\nWhere I just say, okay,\nI know Peter likes cats and kids, and\n\n233\n00:12:07.623 --> 00:12:09.350\nI just start typing things in.\n\n234\n00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:13.970\nOr, I can find his birthday, or his\nanniversary, or his kids birthdays, and\n\n235\n00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:15.120\nthings like that, his dog's name.\n\n236\n00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.140\nAnd I can just start guessing,\ncuz we know that humans\n\n237\n00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:20.650\ntend to pick something that's easy for\nthem to remember.\n\n238\n00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.642\nAnd so there's a good chance\nthat we can guess it.\n\n239\n00:12:23.642 --> 00:12:25.105\n&gt;&gt; Do you know my dog's name?\n\n240\n00:12:25.105 --> 00:12:26.684\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If so I need to change-\n\n241\n00:12:26.684 --> 00:12:27.230\n&gt;&gt; Sparky.\n\n242\n00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:27.984\n&gt;&gt; Something right now.\n\n243\n00:12:27.984 --> 00:12:34.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We can also do what's called\na dictionary attack against passwords.\n\n244\n00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:36.370\nAnd this is where we have what's\nknown as a dictionary file.\n\n245\n00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:40.493\nAnd this exam is not gonna get you on\nthe details of these types of attacks.\n\n246\n00:12:40.493 --> 00:12:44.456\nI just want you to be familiar with\nthe basic concept of these attacks and\n\n247\n00:12:44.456 --> 00:12:48.270\nunderstand the weaknesses of say,\npasswords in this case.\n\n248\n00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:51.852\nDictionary attack just means\nthe bad guy has a dictionary file,\n\n249\n00:12:51.852 --> 00:12:55.100\nwhich is basically a text file\nwith one word on each line and\n\n250\n00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:58.637\nthe computer will then try each\none of those words one at a time.\n\n251\n00:12:58.637 --> 00:13:03.937\nAnd if your password is in that list\nthey're gonna login as you, right?\n\n252\n00:13:03.937 --> 00:13:07.936\nAnd computers nowadays can do\nbillions of guesses per second so\n\n253\n00:13:07.936 --> 00:13:12.350\nit does not take long at all to\nrifle through a dictionary file.\n\n254\n00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:15.523\nAnd if it's anything that's,\nlike I said, a common word,\n\n255\n00:13:15.523 --> 00:13:17.960\nit's most likely gonna\nbe in the dictionary.\n\n256\n00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.190\nCuz the bad guys developed\nthese dictionaries over time.\n\n257\n00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:24.540\nI've got the Webster's dictionary\none word on each line.\n\n258\n00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:29.267\nI have name dictionaries with common\nFrench names and common Italian names and\n\n259\n00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:29.992\netc, etc.\n\n260\n00:13:29.992 --> 00:13:34.369\nYou can go out there and\ndon't think you're gonna get away from it.\n\n261\n00:13:34.369 --> 00:13:39.223\nThere's Klingon dictionaries and\nElvish dictionaries so\n\n262\n00:13:39.223 --> 00:13:45.250\nusing words like that again are not\ngonna stand up to a dictionary attack.\n\n263\n00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:52.386\nBut if your password is not a common\nword or a combination of common words,\n\n264\n00:13:52.386 --> 00:13:56.839\nwe can actually be very what's\nthe word I'm looking for?\n\n265\n00:13:56.839 --> 00:13:59.624\nLess susceptible to those\ndictionary attacks.\n\n266\n00:13:59.624 --> 00:14:03.178\nBut then there's also brute force attacks,\nand brute force attacks are where they\n\n267\n00:14:03.178 --> 00:14:06.695\njust try every possible combination of\nletter and number and special character.\n\n268\n00:14:06.695 --> 00:14:10.434\nAnd since your password has to be\na combination of letters and numbers and\n\n269\n00:14:10.434 --> 00:14:14.990\nspecial characters, that means eventually\nthey will crack your password right?\n\n270\n00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:17.136\nWe can say that all\npasswords are crackable,\n\n271\n00:14:17.136 --> 00:14:19.464\nbecause they're\na combination of characters.\n\n272\n00:14:19.464 --> 00:14:24.223\nNow it might take me 30 minutes,\nit might take me 30,000 years so\n\n273\n00:14:24.223 --> 00:14:29.140\nwhen I say all passwords are trackable\nunderstand that some of them are well\n\n274\n00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:31.339\nbeyond reasonable time frames.\n\n275\n00:14:31.339 --> 00:14:34.620\n&gt;&gt; And at the same time a hacker\ncan usually just look at the site.\n\n276\n00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:39.500\nWhen you're creating an account maybe it\nsays passwords needs to be between 8 and\n\n277\n00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:40.330\n16 characters.\n\n278\n00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:43.350\nNeeds to have at least one capital,\nneeds to have at least one symbol.\n\n279\n00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:48.260\nSo they can put that information\ninto those brute force tools and\n\n280\n00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.510\nreally bring down the number\nof attempts they need to make.\n\n281\n00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:53.600\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely instead of trying\neverything now I've limited the number of\n\n282\n00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.470\nguesses I have to do.\n\n283\n00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:58.078\nInstead of 30000 years it\nmight take me 3 years instead.\n\n284\n00:14:58.078 --> 00:15:01.240\nOr the idea is the bad guys is just\ntrying to get that lower and lower.\n\n285\n00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:04.140\nAnd then as computers get faster and\nfaster.\n\n286\n00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:05.710\nThose timeframes shrink as well.\n\n287\n00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:07.044\nBut again, we'll stop there.\n\n288\n00:15:07.044 --> 00:15:09.118\nThe main thing I want you to know here is,\n\n289\n00:15:09.118 --> 00:15:12.830\npasswords are one of the factors\nwe can use for authentication.\n\n290\n00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:15.240\nIt's based on something you know,\npassword.\n\n291\n00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:20.846\nBut passwords are easily cracked, so it's\nnot a very secure form of authentication.\n\n292\n00:15:20.846 --> 00:15:22.620\nPINs as well, right.\n\n293\n00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:24.340\nPINs are usually even shorter.\n\n294\n00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:27.774\nAnd they're typically only numbers,\nright, personal identification number.\n\n295\n00:15:27.774 --> 00:15:33.890\nSo there're four numbers on your iPhone or\non your bank card.\n\n296\n00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:37.310\nBut you might know like Windows now,\n\n297\n00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:40.170\nyou can use a pin to authenticate\nyour Windows system, and\n\n298\n00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:44.030\nit will tell you on there that a pin is\nactually more secure than a password.\n\n299\n00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:46.450\nAnd you might think,\nwell wait how can that be?\n\n300\n00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:50.010\nMy password could be 24 random characters.\n\n301\n00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:51.865\nMy PIN is only four numbers long.\n\n302\n00:15:51.865 --> 00:15:56.695\nWell the idea is a PIN can only be used\nlocally on that system so if they don't\n\n303\n00:15:56.695 --> 00:16:01.450\nhave physical access to that system\nThe PIN is not gonna do them any good and\n\n304\n00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:06.720\nit's not something where I can go to any\nmachine and log on using my password.\n\n305\n00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.400\nThe PIN is specific to that machine.\n\n306\n00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:13.290\nSo if they took my phone,\nit's not gonna be the same PIN,\n\n307\n00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:15.350\nwell, shouldn't be as long as\nyou're not reusing the PIN.\n\n308\n00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:18.292\nSo PINs can actually be a little\nmore secure than passwords,\n\n309\n00:16:18.292 --> 00:16:20.205\ndepending on how they're being used.\n\n310\n00:16:20.205 --> 00:16:22.734\nBut they are short and\nthey're only numbers, so\n\n311\n00:16:22.734 --> 00:16:25.450\nthey're not super secure either.\n\n312\n00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:26.560\nAlright, so something you know.\n\n313\n00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.010\nWhat's the other factor we\ncan base authentication on?\n\n314\n00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:30.192\nThat's something you have.\n\n315\n00:16:30.192 --> 00:16:32.412\nAll right,\nthis would be like your driver's license,\n\n316\n00:16:32.412 --> 00:16:35.115\nif we're talking about non-computers,\nyour passport, right?\n\n317\n00:16:35.115 --> 00:16:37.100\nThis is something you can carry with you,\n\n318\n00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:40.844\nsomething you have in your possession that\nyou can use to prove your identity to\n\n319\n00:16:40.844 --> 00:16:45.210\nthe police officer, or to the airline\ncounter, or wherever the case may be.\n\n320\n00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:48.744\nIn the electronic world and when you're\ntalking about information security,\n\n321\n00:16:48.744 --> 00:16:51.430\nwe're talking about\nthings like certificates.\n\n322\n00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:54.640\nA certificate is an electronic document\n\n323\n00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:58.960\nthat has your identity\ninformation stored in it.\n\n324\n00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.500\nThese electronic documents\nare issued by a trusted,\n\n325\n00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:07.050\nwhat's called a certificate authority,\nand you have to apply for a certificate.\n\n326\n00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:08.740\nNow a lot of this is automated and\n\n327\n00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:12.330\nyour company just issues certificates\nto you cuz they have your information.\n\n328\n00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:15.010\nBut do understand, that a certificate\nis something you apply for,\n\n329\n00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:19.340\nwhether you see it and\ndo it manually at a website or\n\n330\n00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:22.040\nwhether it's done behind the scenes and\nautomatically issued.\n\n331\n00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:26.227\nIt still has to verify your information\nand then put that information\n\n332\n00:17:26.227 --> 00:17:30.068\nin a certificate and\nthen generate what's known as a key pair.\n\n333\n00:17:30.068 --> 00:17:34.150\nAnd we'll talk about keys a little more\nwhen we get into our encryption episode.\n\n334\n00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:37.900\nAnd then put your one part of\nthe key in that certificate,\n\n335\n00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:41.550\nwhat's known as your public key,\nand then generate that document.\n\n336\n00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:46.260\nAnd so, now you can use this electronic\ndocument to identify yourself, all right?\n\n337\n00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.220\nYou have basically a driver's license,\nif you will,\n\n338\n00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:51.440\nan electronic form of identification.\n\n339\n00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:57.924\nThey're stored on your computer so that\nyou can digitally sign emails, so that you\n\n340\n00:17:57.924 --> 00:18:02.582\ncan create VPN connections, anything that\nneeds you to identify can be configured.\n\n341\n00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:07.540\nLike IPSec can be configured to use\ncertificates for the identification.\n\n342\n00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:12.760\nMuch, much stronger than passwords\nbecause it's much harder to fake, right?\n\n343\n00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:16.666\nTo generate that certificate, I would\nhave to go through a lot of steps and\n\n344\n00:18:16.666 --> 00:18:18.690\nin the end it's not gonna be trusted.\n\n345\n00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:21.420\nAnd we have an episode we're gonna talk\nabout a little bit more detail about\n\n346\n00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:24.430\ncertificates but\nthey're much harder to fake, all right?\n\n347\n00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:29.030\nAnd that's the good thing, so they're\na much stronger form of authentication.\n\n348\n00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:31.790\nBut you think,\nwhy don't we use them everywhere?\n\n349\n00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.480\nBecause of the infrastructure\nthat it requires.\n\n350\n00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.220\nI have to have the issuing authority.\n\n351\n00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.830\nI have to generate these certificates.\n\n352\n00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:40.730\nI have to distribute them to my users and\nto computers and to services and\n\n353\n00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:41.950\nto websites.\n\n354\n00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:44.970\nAnd they have to be renewed,\nthey have to be revoked,\n\n355\n00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:50.370\nthey have to be managed over time, so\nthere's a little more to setting that up.\n\n356\n00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:53.060\nNow a lot of that technology\nhas come way down in price and\n\n357\n00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.730\nis a lot easier to work\nwith now than years ago.\n\n358\n00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:58.900\nSo we are seeing more and\nmore certificates used for\n\n359\n00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.340\nauthentication in more places.\n\n360\n00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:06.548\nAnother place you'll see these\ncertificates is in smart cards, right?\n\n361\n00:19:06.548 --> 00:19:08.870\nYeah, you can hold that one up\nthere Peter, if they can see that.\n\n362\n00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:12.074\n&gt;&gt; It's my smart card for\naccess to the building here.\n\n363\n00:19:12.074 --> 00:19:17.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so a smart card is a credit card\nsized card, if that's not redundant,\n\n364\n00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:22.343\nand it typically is gonna have a chip,\na little bit of an integrated chip.\n\n365\n00:19:22.343 --> 00:19:26.671\nAnd technically, the one Peter held up is\nnot actually a smart card, but we won't\n\n366\n00:19:26.671 --> 00:19:30.770\ntell Peter that, but normally like your\ncredit cards that you get nowadays.\n\n367\n00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.487\nYou see those little\nchips they put on there?\n\n368\n00:19:32.487 --> 00:19:36.279\nAll right, they're trying to get away from\nthe magnetic stripe because it's a lot\n\n369\n00:19:36.279 --> 00:19:36.940\nmore secure.\n\n370\n00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:38.510\nThat chip can have logic.\n\n371\n00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.942\nIt has storage and\nit has logic built into it,\n\n372\n00:19:40.942 --> 00:19:44.532\nthat it can do its own encryption\nindependent from your computer.\n\n373\n00:19:44.532 --> 00:19:47.790\nSo it's much more difficult to hack as\neverything is stored right there in\n\n374\n00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:48.760\nthat chip.\n\n375\n00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:53.710\nBut now I can take that card and I can\ninsert it into some kind of reader and\n\n376\n00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:56.830\nit can read my certificate off\nof there and see who I am.\n\n377\n00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:59.910\nSo now I can prove my identity with that,\nright?\n\n378\n00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:03.700\nA lot of computers nowadays have\nsmart card readers built into them.\n\n379\n00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:08.450\nSmart cards themselves and the devices\nused to generate those cards and\n\n380\n00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:11.460\nprogram those chips is\nbecoming much less expensive.\n\n381\n00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.740\nSo we're seeing this more and\nmore as an authentication solution\n\n382\n00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:18.540\nin a lot of environments because it's\nmuch, much stronger than passwords.\n\n383\n00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.750\nThere's a downside though\nbecause it is a physical thing.\n\n384\n00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:24.570\nIt's something that you have and guess\nwhat we can do with something we have?\n\n385\n00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:27.202\nWe can lose it, all right?\n\n386\n00:20:27.202 --> 00:20:28.230\n&gt;&gt; Or I can take it.\n\n387\n00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:30.200\n&gt;&gt; Or you can take it, exactly.\n\n388\n00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.632\nSo it can be lost and\nnow I've gotta go through the process of,\n\n389\n00:20:33.632 --> 00:20:36.942\ncan a user authenticate if\nthey've lost their smart card?\n\n390\n00:20:36.942 --> 00:20:39.530\nAre we still allowing passwords as well?\n\n391\n00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:42.750\nAnd that's reducing security because\nnow we're saying, you can use a card or\n\n392\n00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:43.730\na password.\n\n393\n00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:46.650\nBut if it's only cards and\nthey lose their card,\n\n394\n00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:49.480\nthey can't get anything done\nuntil they get a new card issued.\n\n395\n00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:53.465\nIt can be logistically a little much\nmore effort there than passwords.\n\n396\n00:20:53.465 --> 00:20:57.155\nThere's also security\ntokens that can be used,\n\n397\n00:20:57.155 --> 00:21:02.195\nwhich is more what Peter was holding\nup there cuz that one has little\n\n398\n00:21:02.195 --> 00:21:06.880\nRFID built into it, or\nthe radio frequency identification.\n\n399\n00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:11.397\nAnd so, we can go next to we have what we\ncall badge readers mounted on walls at\n\n400\n00:21:11.397 --> 00:21:14.927\nthe different doorways and\nas we walk by, we can hit that and\n\n401\n00:21:14.927 --> 00:21:16.970\nit'll open up that door.\n\n402\n00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:20.690\nNow, it is a form of authentication,\nright,\n\n403\n00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:26.370\nbecause the system can be programmed and\nthat RFID is really just a number.\n\n404\n00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:30.220\nIt's not actually Peter's identifying\ninformation stored in that.\n\n405\n00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:33.509\nNo, I'm not on the security tokens,\nthat would be a smart card, but\n\n406\n00:21:33.509 --> 00:21:35.571\nthe system recognizes it has an ID number.\n\n407\n00:21:35.571 --> 00:21:38.963\nSo when it hits that badge reader\nthat goes back to the system and\n\n408\n00:21:38.963 --> 00:21:42.869\nit knows what that number is that's\ninside, embedded in that RFID, and\n\n409\n00:21:42.869 --> 00:21:44.490\nit can determine from there.\n\n410\n00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:47.440\nIt can say Peter can open this door but\nnot this door.\n\n411\n00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.380\nBut it's really not Peter,\nit's the card, right?\n\n412\n00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:54.320\nSo if I take Peter's card,\nI can open any door that he would open.\n\n413\n00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.388\nBut in the end,\nit's the same way with passwords, right?\n\n414\n00:21:56.388 --> 00:22:00.780\nIf I steal his password, I can get in\nanything he would have access to as well.\n\n415\n00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:06.570\nSecurity tokens can also be types that,\nthey're usually very small,\n\n416\n00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:11.880\nmade to attach to a key chain or a card,\nlike we've got here, or a little key fob.\n\n417\n00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.510\nWe used to have those running around.\n\n418\n00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:19.155\nSome of the little more secure security\ntokens are the ones that generate numbers.\n\n419\n00:22:19.155 --> 00:22:22.810\nIt'll have a little screen on them and\nit'll generate a number and so\n\n420\n00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:26.655\nwhen somebody goes to authenticate,\nthey have to look at their device,\n\n421\n00:22:26.655 --> 00:22:27.742\ntype in the number.\n\n422\n00:22:27.742 --> 00:22:30.750\nThe server knows based on time and\nother information what number should be\n\n423\n00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:34.243\ngenerated on the device, so if you typed\nin the appropriate number, it knows you're\n\n424\n00:22:34.243 --> 00:22:36.930\nin possession of the device and\nit can allow you to authenticate.\n\n425\n00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:40.170\nAll right, so that's something you have.\n\n426\n00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:43.020\nThe third factor is something\nthat you are, all right?\n\n427\n00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:43.720\nAnd this is?\n\n428\n00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:45.925\n&gt;&gt; Biometrics.\n\n429\n00:22:45.925 --> 00:22:47.913\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] He is on the ball today.\n\n430\n00:22:47.913 --> 00:22:52.705\n&gt;&gt; I will say, I have seen enough movies\nto know I am never doing a retinal scanner\n\n431\n00:22:52.705 --> 00:22:56.115\nbecause that never ends well for\nthe person with eyes.\n\n432\n00:22:56.115 --> 00:22:57.917\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right, it's not,\n\n433\n00:22:57.917 --> 00:23:01.695\nunless you just wanna give them\ntemporarily your eye, I don't know.\n\n434\n00:23:01.695 --> 00:23:03.667\nBut yeah,\nwe've seen the horror stories there.\n\n435\n00:23:03.667 --> 00:23:08.111\nBut biometrics,\nthe third factor is something you are, and\n\n436\n00:23:08.111 --> 00:23:10.665\nthat's biometrics, all right?\n\n437\n00:23:10.665 --> 00:23:13.335\nMetrics based on life,\nright, life metrics.\n\n438\n00:23:13.335 --> 00:23:17.940\nAnd these are things like fingerprints,\nor you were saying retinal scans,\n\n439\n00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:23.470\nor iris scans, or voice prints,\nor DNA, hair follicles.\n\n440\n00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:28.300\nThey're doing really cool ones now that\nlook at the blood vessels underneath your\n\n441\n00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:33.910\nskin, like in your hand, because those are\nsupposedly just as unique as fingerprints.\n\n442\n00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:35.370\nBut guess what?\n\n443\n00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:37.390\nYou don't leave those on the water glass,\nright?\n\n444\n00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:40.420\nWhen you see the detective shows and\nthey're like, here, have a drink of water.\n\n445\n00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:43.600\nAnd you drink the water and put it back\ndown and they come behind you with\n\n446\n00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.990\na napkin and pick it up and take it\nbecause they want your finger print.\n\n447\n00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:49.897\nWell, if somebody's to get into\na system that uses fingerprints,\n\n448\n00:23:49.897 --> 00:23:52.346\nthey could attempt to steal\nyour fingerprints that way.\n\n449\n00:23:52.346 --> 00:23:56.875\nWe leave them everywhere, so\nthey're not difficult to get and\n\n450\n00:23:56.875 --> 00:23:59.870\ntry to use against some of these systems.\n\n451\n00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:03.668\nBut something like the vein pattern\nin your hand You don't leave\n\n452\n00:24:03.668 --> 00:24:05.506\nthat when you touch a surface.\n\n453\n00:24:05.506 --> 00:24:09.130\nSo for me, personally, I think that's one\nof the cooler ones that I've seen lately.\n\n454\n00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:14.260\nBut they're all looking, basically, at\nsomething that's unique about you, right?\n\n455\n00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:17.490\nYour fingerprint is supposedly\nunique in the world.\n\n456\n00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:20.770\nYour iris is the colored\nportion of your eyes,\n\n457\n00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:26.350\nthat pattern is unique to to you,\nunique enough to identify you.\n\n458\n00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:29.600\nThe retinal scans are actually\nlooking at the inside of your eye,\n\n459\n00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.720\nthe blood vessels on\nthe back of your eye ball.\n\n460\n00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.630\nVoice recognition,\nyou already heard of this.\n\n461\n00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:38.630\nSo these are all based on\nsomething you are, biometrics.\n\n462\n00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:40.710\nThere are some issues with Biometrics.\n\n463\n00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:42.690\nIt's a relatively new technology.\n\n464\n00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:45.900\nI mean it's been around for a while and\nit's starting to make it's way into more\n\n465\n00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.440\nmain stream,\nbecause again the prices are coming down.\n\n466\n00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:52.990\nBut as they've come out,\nthere's lots of issues with them.\n\n467\n00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:55.630\nLike some of the early finger print\nreaders, they don't check for\n\n468\n00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:56.630\nany signs of life.\n\n469\n00:24:56.630 --> 00:25:01.540\nSo I said you could get a finger print\nusing your little $15 detective kit\n\n470\n00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:04.260\nthat you order out of\nthe back of a comic book.\n\n471\n00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:07.330\nAnd it's just some tape and\nsome dust that you can sprinkle on there,\n\n472\n00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:11.580\nget the fingerprint, and you can try to\nuse that to bypass one of these systems.\n\n473\n00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:15.100\nBetter systems, more expensive systems,\nmodern systems, are looking for\n\n474\n00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.270\nsigns of life.\n\n475\n00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:19.500\nMaybe some heat detection,\nbut again can we fake that?\n\n476\n00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:23.601\nCan I warm up the stick of Play Doh and\nthen wrap the fingerprint on there and\n\n477\n00:25:23.601 --> 00:25:24.540\nput it in there.\n\n478\n00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:25.280\nI don't know.\n\n479\n00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:29.396\nRecently, in fact, this was just in the\nnews the other day on one of my readers.\n\n480\n00:25:29.396 --> 00:25:35.140\nSamsung now has an iris, one of their new\nphones has an iris scanner built into it.\n\n481\n00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:38.830\nThey're touting it as unbreakable,\nthe most secure system.\n\n482\n00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:44.240\nAnd, of course, people have already broken\nit by using a picture of somebody and\n\n483\n00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:47.740\na contact lens and they superimpose it and\n\n484\n00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:51.940\nthey can hold it up to the phone, and\nthey are able to get into the phone.\n\n485\n00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:53.280\nSo biometrics again.\n\n486\n00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:57.073\nIt is a very, it can be very strong.\n\n487\n00:25:57.073 --> 00:25:59.771\nI'm trying to think of\na good way to put it, it's-\n\n488\n00:25:59.771 --> 00:26:02.502\n&gt;&gt; It's got potential to be very secure,\n\n489\n00:26:02.502 --> 00:26:05.077\nbut maybe it's not quite there yet.\n\n490\n00:26:05.077 --> 00:26:06.760\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's still in it's infancy, yeah.\n\n491\n00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:10.180\nAnd there are some issues too\nwith things like retina scans.\n\n492\n00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:12.485\nOne of the problems,\nat least initially with retina scans,\n\n493\n00:26:12.485 --> 00:26:15.640\nwas the fact that you had to get\nthe camera right up on your eye, so\n\n494\n00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:18.450\nthat it could block out light and\nsee the back of your eye.\n\n495\n00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:20.290\nWell you're thinking, that's secure.\n\n496\n00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:21.980\nYou can't fake that.\n\n497\n00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:25.850\nWould you go up to an ATM and\nput your eye up on a camera that\n\n498\n00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:28.755\nwho knows how many other people have\nput their eye against that day?\n\n499\n00:26:28.755 --> 00:26:31.642\n[INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; If I want pink eye, I certainly would.\n\n500\n00:26:31.642 --> 00:26:33.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I've got a question while\n\n501\n00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:34.170\nyou're there too.\n\n502\n00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:37.880\nWhen we're talking about\nmulti-factor authentication or\n\n503\n00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:42.990\ntwo factor, do you want to try to take\na factor from each of these things or is\n\n504\n00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:47.270\nit a good idea to do fingerprints and your\nretinal scan or do you want to mix it up?\n\n505\n00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:50.920\n&gt;&gt; That is a great question, and\nthe answer is a little bit tricky.\n\n506\n00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:53.960\nThe answer is if you did fingerprints and\n\n507\n00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.530\niris scan, you actually wouldn't be\ndoing multi-factor authentication,\n\n508\n00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:00.980\ncuz you're still basing it only on\none factor, who you are, right?\n\n509\n00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:05.480\nIt is two separate things, but\nit's only based on who you are.\n\n510\n00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:08.060\nSo the idea behind multi-factor\nauthentication then,\n\n511\n00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:10.010\nnow that we know the three\ndifferent types,\n\n512\n00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:13.530\nis that we're gonna have one from each,\nor more than one.\n\n513\n00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:18.663\nIt might be like you were saying\nearlier with a card and a pin, right?\n\n514\n00:27:18.663 --> 00:27:24.280\nSo that'd be something you have,\nthe card and something you know, the pin.\n\n515\n00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.700\nSo now if somebody steals your card,\n\n516\n00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:29.160\nthey still cannot authenticate\nbecause they don't know your pin.\n\n517\n00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.916\nOr if you've written your pin down and\nthey get a hold of that,\n\n518\n00:27:31.916 --> 00:27:34.947\nthey can't authenticate as you\nbecause they don't have the card.\n\n519\n00:27:34.947 --> 00:27:36.775\nSo that's the idea behind multi factors,\n\n520\n00:27:36.775 --> 00:27:38.850\none from each of those\ndifferent categories.\n\n521\n00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:42.960\nThat's why I said it was a great question\nbecause that is very misleading.\n\n522\n00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:48.110\n&gt;&gt; A great example I have too is I have\nclear the service at the airport let's you\n\n523\n00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:50.190\ngo by security quicker and\n\n524\n00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:53.850\nthey'll use a biometric thing like\nyour fingerprint or your eye.\n\n525\n00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:56.630\nAnd then you'll have to show your ID as\nwell so you've got something you have and\n\n526\n00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:58.190\nsomething that you are.\n\n527\n00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:59.550\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n528\n00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:01.960\nAnd you could do three factor,\nyou could say it's something you have,\n\n529\n00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:05.270\nand something you know and\nsomething you are, right?\n\n530\n00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:08.830\nAnd the idea, again,\nis like our examples are showing you.\n\n531\n00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:10.270\nIt's a lot harder for\n\n532\n00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:14.450\nsomebody to authenticate as you if\nthere's more than one factor, right?\n\n533\n00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:18.600\nThe example you used about getting\na text so you've logged into your bank.\n\n534\n00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.327\nIt doesn't recognize your computer\nbecause you've reinstalled or\n\n535\n00:28:21.327 --> 00:28:23.074\nyou're using somebody else's computer.\n\n536\n00:28:23.074 --> 00:28:26.330\nAnd it said hey, we're gonna send\nyou a text to your mobile phone.\n\n537\n00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:28.830\nWell, that is multi factor\nauthentication right,\n\n538\n00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.610\nbecause you're typing in a password.\n\n539\n00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:33.040\nAnd now it's saying, I'm gonna\nsend a text to your mobile phone.\n\n540\n00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.510\nThat's something you have.\n\n541\n00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:36.470\nAnd the idea is somebody might\nbreak into your account,\n\n542\n00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:39.270\nknow your password cuz you\nused a keystroke logger.\n\n543\n00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:40.580\nBut they don't have your phone.\n\n544\n00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.170\nSo when the text gets sent out,\n\n545\n00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:46.350\nthey don't get the code to type in\nbecause they don't have your phone.\n\n546\n00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:49.751\nSo multi-factor is definitely something\nwe're gonna see a lot of in the future.\n\n547\n00:28:49.751 --> 00:28:54.467\nBecause if we can see that any one\nof these factors Isn't strong, or\n\n548\n00:28:54.467 --> 00:28:59.846\nis strong but is not bulletproof on it's\nown, but we start combining them and\n\n549\n00:28:59.846 --> 00:29:04.360\nit makes it much,\nmuch stronger solution, all right?\n\n550\n00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.600\nLast thing I guess I'll talk about,\nI know Peter's giving me the signal,\n\n551\n00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.440\nwe're running short on time.\n\n552\n00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.454\nWith biometrics, there is a couple\nconcepts here we need to be familiar with,\n\n553\n00:29:11.454 --> 00:29:14.750\nthat is false negatives and\nfalse positives, right?\n\n554\n00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:19.680\nA false negative is when\nyou're not authenticated,\n\n555\n00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.510\nbut it is actually you, right?\n\n556\n00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:25.605\nMaybe if you're using,\nsay fingerprint scanners and\n\n557\n00:29:25.605 --> 00:29:29.505\nyou cut the finger that you\nused to authenticate with.\n\n558\n00:29:29.505 --> 00:29:33.265\nWell, now it very well could deny you\nauthentication because it doesn't\n\n559\n00:29:33.265 --> 00:29:34.975\nrecognize your fingerprint, right?\n\n560\n00:29:34.975 --> 00:29:38.295\nThis is why lot of systems make\nyou do more than one finger, so\n\n561\n00:29:38.295 --> 00:29:40.525\nthat they can have more\nthan one try at it.\n\n562\n00:29:40.525 --> 00:29:44.840\nVoice recognition, I went to a concert\nlast night, and I can't talk.\n\n563\n00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.790\nI'm not gonna be able to authenticate.\n\n564\n00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:49.360\nSo those would be false negatives.\n\n565\n00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:55.750\nFalse negatives are bad because\nthey cause a lack of production.\n\n566\n00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:58.489\nRight now, I've gotta deal with that user\nand try to get them authenticated so\n\n567\n00:29:58.489 --> 00:29:59.578\nthey can actually get to work.\n\n568\n00:29:59.578 --> 00:30:04.120\nSo it can be a pain and frustrating.\n\n569\n00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.024\nBut the worse one is the false positives,\nright?\n\n570\n00:30:06.024 --> 00:30:10.360\nThe false positive when I'm\nauthenticated and it wasn't me, right?\n\n571\n00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:15.080\nWe've had that happen here on some of our\nsystems where somehow the fingerprints\n\n572\n00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:18.550\nare maybe close, or the system\nwe're using is not all that great.\n\n573\n00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:20.650\nAnd I'll put my fingerprint out there and\nit says, thank you Megan.\n\n574\n00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:23.671\nWait a second, something ain't right here.\n\n575\n00:30:23.671 --> 00:30:28.961\nAll right, that'd be a false positive, an\nauthentication without actually verifying\n\n576\n00:30:28.961 --> 00:30:33.840\nthe information, or something went wrong\nin the verification process, right?\n\n577\n00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.960\nSo just something to keep in mind, with\nbiometrics we can have false negatives and\n\n578\n00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.800\nwe can have false positives.\n\n579\n00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.827\nSo Peter, I know we got a little\nmore to talk about, but\n\n580\n00:30:41.827 --> 00:30:44.399\nthat'll probably be a good stopping point,\nI think, for this one.\n\n581\n00:30:44.399 --> 00:30:45.430\n&gt;&gt; All right, great.\n\n582\n00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:48.270\nSo we'll come back here for\nthe part two for this one, it sounds like?\n\n583\n00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:49.100\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n584\n00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:53.020\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we've got some more user\nauthentication things to talk about.\n\n585\n00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.970\nBut a lot of great information there and\ncertainly some things that I had\n\n586\n00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:58.050\nnot considered before,\nso thanks for that Mike.\n\n587\n00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:00.740\nBut let me go ahead and sign off for\nthis episode for ITProTV.\n\n588\n00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:02.532\nI've been your host Peter VanRysdam.\n\n589\n00:31:02.532 --> 00:31:03.251\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n590\n00:31:03.251 --> 00:31:04.731\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you next time.\n\n591\n00:31:04.731 -->

00:00:11.080\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.672\n&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome to ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:13.672 --> 00:00:17.833\nI'm your host Peter VanRysdam and today\nwe're continuing with our MTA security\n\n6\n00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:22.177\nfundamentals course, and specifically in\nthis episode we're gonna be continuing\n\n7\n00:00:22.177 --> 00:00:24.560\nwith our user authentication series.\n\n8\n00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.900\nOr of course we've got a part\ntwo that we are doing right now.\n\n9\n00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.600\nWe did a part one earlier, talked a lot\nabout multi-factor authentication and\n\n10\n00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.060\ndifferent types of authentication.\n\n11\n00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.445\nSo be sure and\ncheck that out if you have not already.\n\n12\n00:00:37.445 --> 00:00:41.155\nBut now we're going to continue on, so\nMike let's pick up where we left off.\n\n13\n00:00:41.155 --> 00:00:41.865\nWhere are we?\n\n14\n00:00:41.865 --> 00:00:44.425\n&gt;&gt; Well, the next thing we really wanted\nto talk about you know we've already\n\n15\n00:00:44.425 --> 00:00:47.225\ntalked a little bit about something\nknown as smart cards, right?\n\n16\n00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:51.825\nWe said those are credit card\nsized cards to be redundant there.\n\n17\n00:00:51.825 --> 00:00:55.455\nThat have a little integrated circuit or\nlittle chip on them that allows them to do\n\n18\n00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:58.688\nsome computations,\ntypically some encryption.\n\n19\n00:00:58.688 --> 00:01:02.200\nHas storage,\nnon-volatile storage on there, right?\n\n20\n00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.800\nSo that it keeps that information even\nwhen no power is being applied to it.\n\n21\n00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.384\nAnd we can store certificates or\n\n22\n00:01:08.384 --> 00:01:11.115\nother identifying information\non those smart cards.\n\n23\n00:01:11.115 --> 00:01:13.190\nSo we can now use them to authenticate.\n\n24\n00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.870\nWhat we didn't say was that\nsmart cards can be physical.\n\n25\n00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:17.634\nOr they can be virtual.\n\n26\n00:01:17.634 --> 00:01:21.850\nIt should come as no surprise everything\nis being virtualized nowadays.\n\n27\n00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.865\nSmart cards are as well.\n\n28\n00:01:24.865 --> 00:01:27.080\nThe way virtual smart cards is going to or\n\n29\n00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.700\nnormally it's a physical thing\nthat I get from our company.\n\n30\n00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.750\nAnd now I can stick that into a card\nreader to get access to a doorway.\n\n31\n00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.850\nOr I can swipe it on my computer and\nget access.\n\n32\n00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:40.784\nI can log in using that.\n\n33\n00:01:40.784 --> 00:01:44.121\nOr like cat cards in the military\nyou got the little reader,\n\n34\n00:01:44.121 --> 00:01:47.524\nyou stick your card down in and\nnow you can access the system,\n\n35\n00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:50.490\nwhen you walk away you pull\nyour card out type thing.\n\n36\n00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.630\nSo those are the physical\nexamples of smart cards.\n\n37\n00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.830\nBut they can also be virtual.\n\n38\n00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.410\nAnd with virtual smart cards they're\nsame thing we're gonna have the same\n\n39\n00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.300\nkinds of information would be stored in\nthem but they're not a physical thing.\n\n40\n00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.210\nThey're a virtual smart card.\n\n41\n00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.393\nAnd so what happens is in your computer,\nmost systems now days,\n\n42\n00:02:11.393 --> 00:02:16.124\nmodern computers, have something\nknown as a TPM on their motherboard.\n\n43\n00:02:16.124 --> 00:02:19.060\nNow, TPM stands for\ntrusted platform module.\n\n44\n00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.866\nAnd it's a chip on your motherboard,\nor a set of chips on your motherboard,\n\n45\n00:02:22.866 --> 00:02:25.910\nthat's kind of independent\nfrom everything else, right.\n\n46\n00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.325\nAnd it's where I can store secret or\n\n47\n00:02:28.325 --> 00:02:33.730\nsensitive information like technologies\nthat encrypt the entire hard drive.\n\n48\n00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.680\nAnd Windows,\nthat's something known as Bitlocker.\n\n49\n00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.380\nWell, the decryption keys for\n\n50\n00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.810\nthat information is actually\nstored in the TPM, right?\n\n51\n00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.580\nAnd so\nwhen your computer goes to start up,\n\n52\n00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.335\nit can go to that TPM,\nthey can get access to those keys and\n\n53\n00:02:47.335 --> 00:02:51.220\ndecry-pt the hard drive, and\nthen your operating system can boot up.\n\n54\n00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.470\nWell, that's where virtual\nsmart cards are gonna go.\n\n55\n00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.410\nSo when an administrator generates these\nvirtual smart cards instead of handing you\n\n56\n00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.230\na plastic card to put in your wallet or\npurse,\n\n57\n00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.390\nit's gonna be delivered to your computer.\n\n58\n00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.950\nAnd stored in that TPM or\nthat trusted platform module.\n\n59\n00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.170\nApplications are the way Windows handles\nthis though, is it looks like a physical\n\n60\n00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.300\nsmart card reader, with a smart card\ninserted into it, to all applications.\n\n61\n00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.280\nSo even though it's virtual and\nit's on my motherboard,\n\n62\n00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.810\nthere is no card reader next to my laptop.\n\n63\n00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.940\nThere's nothing I'm\nputting into that thing.\n\n64\n00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.800\nAn application would\nsee it as a smart card.\n\n65\n00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.642\nSo if you have to connect to a website,\nand\n\n66\n00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:33.332\nwhen you connect to that website you have\nto swipe your smart card, well now what's\n\n67\n00:03:33.332 --> 00:03:36.565\ngonna happen is that TPM will expose\nthe smart card to that application.\n\n68\n00:03:36.565 --> 00:03:39.355\nAnd it'll see it just\nlike a physical card.\n\n69\n00:03:39.355 --> 00:03:43.045\nIt'll say, there's your card, it's in\nthe reader, I can get the information.\n\n70\n00:03:43.045 --> 00:03:44.695\nYou are supposed to have access.\n\n71\n00:03:44.695 --> 00:03:45.635\nHere you go, here's your website.\n\n72\n00:03:45.635 --> 00:03:49.110\nAll right, so that's really the only\ndifference is that they're not a physical\n\n73\n00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.805\nthing, they're a virtual thing.\n\n74\n00:03:50.805 --> 00:03:54.740\nAnd just understand that they're stored\nin a TPM or trusted platform module,\n\n75\n00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.690\nwhich is a chip on your motherboard\nthat handles its security independently.\n\n76\n00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.551\nAnd it can be put to the operating system,\nto the applications,\n\n77\n00:04:03.551 --> 00:04:07.070\nit can be exposed just\nlike a physical reader.\n\n78\n00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.420\nSo the applications,\nthey don't know any different.\n\n79\n00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.610\nThey don't know that you're\nsticking your card into a reader.\n\n80\n00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.922\nThey just say, he's got the card,\nhe should be good to go.\n\n81\n00:04:14.922 --> 00:04:18.670\n&gt;&gt; Is this a piece of software then\nthat I have to have installed or\n\n82\n00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.010\nsomething I have to check each time?\n\n83\n00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.350\n&gt;&gt; In Windows 7 and later, it's actually\nbuilt in to the operating system.\n\n84\n00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.290\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; So it's a part of the API.\n\n85\n00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.450\nI know we don't need to get into that but\nit is part of the API so\n\n86\n00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.110\napplications can be programmed to\nlook there for your smart card and\n\n87\n00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.900\nthey'll see it just like a physical card.\n\n88\n00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.130\nAll right, now another thing that\nwe've already hinted at, but\n\n89\n00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.400\nI wanna go into a little more detail, is\nsomething known as remote authentication,\n\n90\n00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.070\nor really more technically,\nwe're gonna call it radius.\n\n91\n00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.162\nRemote authentication\ndial in user service.\n\n92\n00:04:52.162 --> 00:04:54.404\nNow just from the name, you can probably\ninfer that it's been around for\n\n93\n00:04:54.404 --> 00:04:54.934\na little while.\n\n94\n00:04:54.934 --> 00:05:00.030\nBecause if you notice what I said, remote\nauthentication dial in user service.\n\n95\n00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.525\nWhen's the last time you've\ndialed into anything Peter?\n\n96\n00:05:02.525 --> 00:05:05.927\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it was a 56 6\nmodem back in 98 maybe?\n\n97\n00:05:05.927 --> 00:05:08.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSo we don't really do a lot of dial up\n\n98\n00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.560\nconnections anymore but, understand\nthey're definitely are out there.\n\n99\n00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.966\nWe get spoiled especially here in\nthe states thinking we got high\n\n100\n00:05:14.966 --> 00:05:18.006\nspeed Internet everywhere we go and\nthat is not the case.\n\n101\n00:05:18.006 --> 00:05:21.200\nBut anyway that's another story for\nanother day.\n\n102\n00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.090\nWhat we want to learn about is that\nthe technology call that the specification\n\n103\n00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.390\ncalled RADIUS, Remote Authentication\nDial-In User Service.\n\n104\n00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.830\nAnd I hinted at it the other day when we\nwere talking about wireless access points\n\n105\n00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.470\nand securing wireless access points.\n\n106\n00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.110\nCuz wireless access points\nare relatively insecure,\n\n107\n00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.910\nand they're doing this authentication,\nright?\n\n108\n00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.700\nPeople are trying to connect to\nthe wireless access point They're doing\n\n109\n00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.400\nthe authentication and then saying yeah\nyou're allowed that person to connect.\n\n110\n00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.302\nAnd so the wireless access point\nself though has to be exposed.\n\n111\n00:05:51.302 --> 00:05:54.250\nAnd that means the bad guy can\nattempt to connect to it and\n\n112\n00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.393\nthey're gonna hack on that access point\nand try to break the authentication or\n\n113\n00:05:58.393 --> 00:06:00.550\nthe encryption and get access.\n\n114\n00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.284\nSo, what a technology called RADIUS or\nwhat RADIUS allows me to do, is move\n\n115\n00:06:05.284 --> 00:06:10.172\nthe authentication part off of that\nwireless access point in this example and\n\n116\n00:06:10.172 --> 00:06:14.930\nput it back on a server that's back\nbehind my corporate firewall, right?\n\n117\n00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.909\nThat wireless access point is\nprobably adding your DMZ where public\n\n118\n00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:21.648\ncan get to it before\nthey're authenticated.\n\n119\n00:06:21.648 --> 00:06:25.260\nAnd then all the authentication\ntakes place there.\n\n120\n00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.700\nRadius, we said in\na Microsoft world in 2000,\n\n121\n00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.330\nlet me get this right,\n12 and later I believe.\n\n122\n00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.800\nMight have been 2008 or two.\n\n123\n00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.720\nIt's actually known as NPS\na network policy server.\n\n124\n00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.950\nRadius is a platform independent term,\nright?\n\n125\n00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:43.670\nSo that's just a general term.\n\n126\n00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:48.410\nNPS, part of NPS is Microsoft's\nimplementation of radius, all right.\n\n127\n00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.068\nSo what we do is we set up this radius\nserver, this MPS server in a nice,\n\n128\n00:06:52.068 --> 00:06:55.974\nsecure portion of our network and\nwe tell the wireless access point, hey,\n\n129\n00:06:55.974 --> 00:06:59.390\nyou're not gonna do\nthe identification anymore, right?\n\n130\n00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.920\nPeople are still gonna connect to you and\nwhen they submit their information,\n\n131\n00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.540\nyou're just gonna pass it\nback to the radius server.\n\n132\n00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.300\nLet that radius server\ntalk to active directory.\n\n133\n00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.910\nSee what my remote access policy say.\n\n134\n00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:13.670\nMake sure you've typed\nin the right password or\n\n135\n00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:17.900\nwhatever user authentication and then\njust send that back to the access point.\n\n136\n00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.000\nYes allow him to connect.\n\n137\n00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.050\nOr no, do not allow them to connect.\n\n138\n00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.165\n&gt;&gt; And so this would be a great\npoint to remind you to go back and\n\n139\n00:07:24.165 --> 00:07:27.990\nwatch the episode we did recently on\nwireless security in this series.\n\n140\n00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.130\nAnd definitely had a bunch of\ngood information about that but\n\n141\n00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.580\nas far as what the user sees then,\n\n142\n00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:37.570\nthey're still just seeing the area that\ntype in the SSN or the password rather and\n\n143\n00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:40.590\nthen it might just take an extra second\nfor them to get that response back.\n\n144\n00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:41.170\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n145\n00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:44.830\nYeah, that's the only thing that they're\ngonna notice is maybe a slight delay.\n\n146\n00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.660\nThat's it.\nThey're looking at milliseconds most\n\n147\n00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.134\nlikely unless your network is\nhaving a congestion or something.\n\n148\n00:07:49.134 --> 00:07:53.104\nAnd the benefit of this is two fold.\n\n149\n00:07:53.104 --> 00:07:56.890\nOne, we're moving\nthe authentication process itself.\n\n150\n00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:00.392\nBack to a much more secure potion on\nmy network, that's very important.\n\n151\n00:08:00.392 --> 00:08:03.109\nAnd so now, they can hit on\nthe access point all they want,\n\n152\n00:08:03.109 --> 00:08:04.730\nit's not gonna get them very far.\n\n153\n00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.095\nSo they've made it to the access point,\n\n154\n00:08:06.095 --> 00:08:08.477\nthey're still not going to get\nthrough the firewall into my network.\n\n155\n00:08:08.477 --> 00:08:11.210\nCuz they have to be authenticated,\nall right.\n\n156\n00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:12.910\nSo that's a big thing,\n\n157\n00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:17.100\ntwo is the centralization of\nthe authentication process, right.\n\n158\n00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.906\nThink about this,\nI'm a larger organisation, and\n\n159\n00:08:19.906 --> 00:08:24.020\nI don't have one wireless access point,\nI have five or ten, right?\n\n160\n00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.875\nOr another, even better,\nscenario might be VPN servers.\n\n161\n00:08:26.875 --> 00:08:31.080\nCuz VPN servers, these are servers\nthat your organization sets up.\n\n162\n00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.900\nTo allow you to connect when you're\nout at the hotel, or at home right?\n\n163\n00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:38.270\nYou can still connect to the workplace,\nthrough what's known as a VPN, or\n\n164\n00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.940\na Virtual Private Network.\n\n165\n00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:44.810\nWell, same thing, the authentication can\ntake place right there on the VPN server.\n\n166\n00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:49.480\nBut that VPN server is my DMZ, it's in\nan untrusted portion of my network,\n\n167\n00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.470\nand so I don't like that idea.\n\n168\n00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:54.003\nSo I can tell the VPN server, hey, you're\nnot gonna do authenticating anymore.\n\n169\n00:08:54.003 --> 00:08:57.840\nYou're just gonna pass it back to\nthat NPS server, that RADIUS server.\n\n170\n00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.677\nLet them do it, and he'll let you know\nwhether or not to accept the connection.\n\n171\n00:09:00.677 --> 00:09:03.926\nAnd in an organization where\nI've got one VPN server,\n\n172\n00:09:03.926 --> 00:09:07.110\nI get the benefit of moving\nthe authentication back.\n\n173\n00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:09.811\nBut as I add more and more VPN servers,\n\n174\n00:09:09.811 --> 00:09:13.120\neach one of those VPN\nservers is independent.\n\n175\n00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.100\nAnd so\nif I make a change to a policy on one,\n\n176\n00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.990\nI have to make a change to\nthe policy in all of them.\n\n177\n00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.600\nThink about the Mac filtering\nwe did with the access points.\n\n178\n00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.760\nPeter comes in with a new device,\nand he says, hey,\n\n179\n00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.690\nI need this device to be able to connect.\n\n180\n00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:30.385\nI'd have to go to each wireless\naccess point, right, and manage that.\n\n181\n00:09:30.385 --> 00:09:35.059\nWhen we go to RADIUS, all my VPN servers\nand all my wireless access points are just\n\n182\n00:09:35.059 --> 00:09:39.490\npassing the authentication back to\nthe VPN, to the RADIUS server, right.\n\n183\n00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:42.165\nSo now if I need to make\na new policy that says, hey,\n\n184\n00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:46.610\nanybody in production can VPN in between\nthe hours of 6:00 PM and 10:00 PM.\n\n185\n00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:51.110\nI only have to do that in one place,\nright, so that's the other benefit.\n\n186\n00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:54.659\nWe get two big benefits of using RADIUS,\nor technologies that support RADIUS.\n\n187\n00:09:54.659 --> 00:09:58.584\nMoving the authentication process back to\na more secure portion of my network, and\n\n188\n00:09:58.584 --> 00:10:01.490\ncentralizing the entire\nauthentication process.\n\n189\n00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:04.435\nSo the VPN servers,\nthe wireless access points,\n\n190\n00:10:04.435 --> 00:10:07.042\nbecome known as what's the RADIUS client.\n\n191\n00:10:07.042 --> 00:10:09.797\nThey send their information\nback to the RADIUS server,\n\n192\n00:10:09.797 --> 00:10:12.681\nthe RADIUS server then sends\nit back to the RADIUS client.\n\n193\n00:10:12.681 --> 00:10:17.411\nThe access point or the VPN, or\nthere's also switches that can be known,\n\n194\n00:10:17.411 --> 00:10:19.640\ndo RADIUS clients.\n\n195\n00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.693\nBut it gives me the abilities\nto centralize that.\n\n196\n00:10:22.693 --> 00:10:27.690\nAll right, another term here, to throw in\nwith this, is something known as TACACS+.\n\n197\n00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:30.274\n&gt;&gt; I love that term even\nmore than non-repudiation.\n\n198\n00:10:30.274 --> 00:10:30.782\n&gt;&gt; Do you?\n\n199\n00:10:30.782 --> 00:10:32.420\n&gt;&gt; TACACS.\n&gt;&gt; That's a fun one.\n\n200\n00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:34.853\n&gt;&gt; It is kind of fun to say it,\nlet's all say it together, TACACS!\n\n201\n00:10:34.853 --> 00:10:36.025\n&gt;&gt; TACACS.\n\n202\n00:10:36.025 --> 00:10:37.048\n&gt;&gt; TACACS.\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n203\n00:10:37.048 --> 00:10:38.800\nAll right, I always have to look and\nmake sure that I know what it stands for.\n\n204\n00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.570\nTerminal Access Controller\nAccess-Control System Plus.\n\n205\n00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:45.543\nI'm gonna do that one more time,\n\n206\n00:10:45.543 --> 00:10:49.760\nTerminal Access Controller\nAccess-Control System Plus.\n\n207\n00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.492\nThere was TACACS, and then TACACS+ is\nthe new and improved version of TACACS.\n\n208\n00:10:53.492 --> 00:10:59.020\nAnd TACACS is actually Cisco's\nimplementation of RADIUS, okay.\n\n209\n00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.230\nSo it is doing exactly what\nwe were talking about,\n\n210\n00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:02.950\njust a different name, right.\n\n211\n00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:05.315\nSo TACACS+ is a Cisco proprietary term,\n\n212\n00:11:05.315 --> 00:11:08.097\nwhereas RADIUS is\nthe platform-independent.\n\n213\n00:11:08.097 --> 00:11:10.660\nSo Microsoft implements\nRADIUS as an NPS server.\n\n214\n00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:14.831\nSo if I'm in the Microsoft world, and\nI want to set up a RADIUS server,\n\n215\n00:11:14.831 --> 00:11:16.480\nI install NPS on my server.\n\n216\n00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:21.355\nIf I'm in a Cisco environment and\nI want to use RADIUS, I set up TACACS, or\n\n217\n00:11:21.355 --> 00:11:22.154\nTACACS+.\n\n218\n00:11:22.154 --> 00:11:27.208\nTACACS+ is supposed to be,\nit is a little bit better than RADIUS,\n\n219\n00:11:27.208 --> 00:11:31.830\nor they've made some improvements\nto the RADIUS protocol.\n\n220\n00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:34.370\nBut again, it is proprietary to Cisco.\n\n221\n00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:39.280\nAll right, so\nthat takes care of RADIUS and TACACS+.\n\n222\n00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.550\nLast thing we wanna talk about here\nis something known as the Run As\n\n223\n00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.310\ncommand, all right.\n\n224\n00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:48.980\nWhen we talk about security,\nand we talk about\n\n225\n00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:54.380\nprinciple of least privilege, which\nwe've talked about in other episodes.\n\n226\n00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.890\nOne of the things that we strive for\n\n227\n00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:59.950\nis, obviously, not giving anybody\nmore permissions than you need.\n\n228\n00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:04.950\nAnd maybe I need to be an administrator,\nbecause that's what my job role entails.\n\n229\n00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:08.995\nSo as an IT person, I need administrative\naccess to the systems, but\n\n230\n00:12:08.995 --> 00:12:11.735\nI'm not always doing administrative tasks.\n\n231\n00:12:11.735 --> 00:12:15.935\nThere are times when I'm checking my\nemail, or checking out Newegg for\n\n232\n00:12:15.935 --> 00:12:16.775\ngreat deals.\n\n233\n00:12:16.775 --> 00:12:20.030\nOr reading the latest security blogs,\nand things like that.\n\n234\n00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:23.387\nAnd I don't need administrative access\nto perform those actions, right?\n\n235\n00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.931\nBut, I've got an administrative account,\nand that's what I log in as.\n\n236\n00:12:27.931 --> 00:12:30.736\nAnd now as I'm doing those tasks,\n\n237\n00:12:30.736 --> 00:12:36.760\nI'm running the risk of having my session,\nor my account comprised.\n\n238\n00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.630\nAnd then whoever compromises it now\nhas administrative access, right?\n\n239\n00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.530\nIf I opening up my email, and\n\n240\n00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:46.460\nI happen to click on a link in an email\nthat tries to install malware?\n\n241\n00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:48.840\nWell now it's installing as administrator,\n\n242\n00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.990\nbecause I was logged on with\nan administrative account.\n\n243\n00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:54.269\nSo one of the things we do is,\nwe give everybody,\n\n244\n00:12:54.269 --> 00:12:57.670\nanybody that needs administrative\naccess typically has two accounts.\n\n245\n00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:59.873\nThey have their administrative account,\n\n246\n00:12:59.873 --> 00:13:02.205\nthen they have their\nstandard user account.\n\n247\n00:13:02.205 --> 00:13:06.590\nAnd we log in as\nthe standard user account.\n\n248\n00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:10.670\nAnd then anytime I need administrative\naccess, we can then provide those\n\n249\n00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:15.270\nthat other account credentials I was\nassigned, for administrative access.\n\n250\n00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.710\nAnd then the way that\nhelps us with security is,\n\n251\n00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:20.000\nI'm normally logged on as a standard user.\n\n252\n00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.811\nI check my email, I surf the web,\nI'm just a standard user.\n\n253\n00:13:22.811 --> 00:13:25.550\nStill bad if I get compromised,\nor install malware.\n\n254\n00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:30.198\nBut it could potentially limit the effects\nof that malware because I'm not\n\n255\n00:13:30.198 --> 00:13:32.060\nan administrator.\n\n256\n00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:34.610\nBut then when I need to do\nsomething administratively,\n\n257\n00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:38.710\nI can tell the system to\nrun this as another user.\n\n258\n00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:41.610\nI know I'm signed on as Standard Mike,\nbut I want you to run\n\n259\n00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:46.840\nthis particular application as\nAdministrator Mike, all right.\n\n260\n00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.510\nWe can do that in a couple different ways.\n\n261\n00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:54.460\nStarting with Windows Vista, we actually\ndon't need the Run As command as much.\n\n262\n00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:59.460\nBecause we have something no known as\nthe UAC, or the User Account Control.\n\n263\n00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:03.350\nAnd what this does is it limits,\n\n264\n00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:07.590\neven when you log on as an administrator,\nit really limits what you can do.\n\n265\n00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.710\nAnd then if you try to do something\nthat requires administrative access,\n\n266\n00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:13.270\nit prompts you and says hey,\ndid you mean to do this?\n\n267\n00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:16.660\nIf you click Yes, it'll say okay,\nI'll escalate my credentials, and\n\n268\n00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:17.770\nlet it run as administrator.\n\n269\n00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:20.250\nIf you say no, it doesn't let it run.\n\n270\n00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:22.950\nWhat's cool about it is,\nthat it's only that one task.\n\n271\n00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:27.050\nSo, let's say I have my email client open,\nand I have my web browser open, and\n\n272\n00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:29.740\nthen I needed to run\nPowerShell as administrator.\n\n273\n00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.800\nRun As, or the UAC would kick in,\nand I'd get a prompt saying,\n\n274\n00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.630\ndo you want to allow administrative\naccess to this PowerShell window?\n\n275\n00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:39.975\nAnd I can say yes, and now PowerShell\nwill have administrative access.\n\n276\n00:14:39.975 --> 00:14:44.052\nBut my email application that I had\nopen is still running as Standard Mike,\n\n277\n00:14:44.052 --> 00:14:47.630\nand my web browser is still\nrunning as Standard Mike, right?\n\n278\n00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:50.053\nSo it's keeping administrative access,\n\n279\n00:14:50.053 --> 00:14:54.440\nit's limiting it to just that one\napplication, which makes me more secure.\n\n280\n00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.925\nIf you're logged on as a standard user,\nnot as administrator?\n\n281\n00:14:57.925 --> 00:14:59.879\nWell, the UAC's still gonna kick in,\n\n282\n00:14:59.879 --> 00:15:03.360\nif you try to launch PowerShell\nwith administrative access.\n\n283\n00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.810\nBut now it can't just give you a yes or\nno, because you're not an administrator.\n\n284\n00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:10.840\nYou're standard Mike, and\nyou can't just say yes or no.\n\n285\n00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:14.579\nIt's gonna give a log-on dialog box and\nsay, okay, standard Mike.\n\n286\n00:15:14.579 --> 00:15:16.241\nI'll run this administrator,\n\n287\n00:15:16.241 --> 00:15:20.240\nif you can give me some credentials\nthat have administrative rights.\n\n288\n00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.906\nAnd so I can type those in,\nit'll run, again,\n\n289\n00:15:22.906 --> 00:15:25.878\njust that one window as administrator,\nall right.\n\n290\n00:15:25.878 --> 00:15:30.170\nSo that's the UAC, and again, it takes\naway the need for the Run As as much.\n\n291\n00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:31.680\nNow, we can still use the Run As,\n\n292\n00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.090\nI've seen times when UAC\ndoesn't kick in properly.\n\n293\n00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:40.100\nOr it's an application that doesn't\nnormally need administrative access.\n\n294\n00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:44.865\nAn example I always use, Peter, is if\nyou try to modify the host file on your\n\n295\n00:15:44.865 --> 00:15:47.679\nsystem, you need administrative access.\n\n296\n00:15:47.679 --> 00:15:52.037\nWell, I open up Notepad or I browse\ninto my System32 folder, drivers, etc.\n\n297\n00:15:52.037 --> 00:15:54.424\nAnd I double-click on it,\nNotepad opens up,\n\n298\n00:15:54.424 --> 00:15:58.600\nthere's the file I can't make changes\nto it because I'm not an administrator.\n\n299\n00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:04.110\nSo what I need to do is open\nNotepad first as an administrator.\n\n300\n00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:07.845\nAnd then File &gt; Open from within\nthe administrative notepad and browse and\n\n301\n00:16:07.845 --> 00:16:08.680\nfind that file.\n\n302\n00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.350\nAnd now I can make changes to it.\n\n303\n00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:12.359\nBut when you double-click on Notepad,\nit doesn't say,\n\n304\n00:16:12.359 --> 00:16:14.220\nhey, do you wanna run\nthis as an administrator?\n\n305\n00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't automatically kick in.\n\n306\n00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:17.320\n&gt;&gt; I'm a visual learner.\n\n307\n00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.770\nCan you show us an example here\nof what you're talking about,\n\n308\n00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:21.350\nand how we use the runas command?\n\n309\n00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:22.670\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, let's do this.\n\n310\n00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:25.140\nLet's get out Notepad, and\n\n311\n00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:29.370\nI'm just going to pin this to,\ncan I send it to my desktop anymore?\n\n312\n00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:30.330\nI'll pin it to my taskbar.\n\n313\n00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.410\nAll right, so now I got Notepad down here.\n\n314\n00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:36.999\nIf I double-click Notepad, it doesn't\nprompt me for administrative rights or\n\n315\n00:16:36.999 --> 00:16:37.960\nanything like that.\n\n316\n00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.120\nIt's a text editor.\n\n317\n00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.010\nWell, again,\nwhat if I need to modify the host file?\n\n318\n00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:46.220\nIf I try to go in here now,\nFile &gt; Open, and I go back into,\n\n319\n00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.935\nif I can remember where that guy is,\n\n320\n00:16:48.935 --> 00:16:55.500\nC:Windows&gt; System 32 Drivers &gt; Etsy, and\n\n321\n00:16:55.500 --> 00:17:01.790\nwe get rid of that.\n\n322\n00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.840\nI'll find my host file and\nI'll open it up.\n\n323\n00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:11.850\nAnd now I wanna make a new line in here,\nand I wanna save it, and I'm gonna try.\n\n324\n00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:15.450\nAnd it's going to say you cannot do that.\n\n325\n00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:16.910\nWould you like to save\nit to your documents?\n\n326\n00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:18.840\nYou can write there, but\nyou are not an administrator.\n\n327\n00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:21.336\nYou can't save anything into\nthis particular folder.\n\n328\n00:17:21.336 --> 00:17:25.705\nAll right, so I need to run\nNotepad as an administrator, but\n\n329\n00:17:25.705 --> 00:17:28.030\nthe UAC is not kicking in.\n\n330\n00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:29.710\nSo how do I do that?\n\n331\n00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:31.165\nI'm going to not save my changes.\n\n332\n00:17:31.165 --> 00:17:36.350\nIf I right-click on Notepad, sometimes\nyou will and sometimes you won't.\n\n333\n00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:39.290\nThat's gonna give me a history of files.\n\n334\n00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:42.530\nBut it's not giving me anything\nthat says runas, right?\n\n335\n00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:45.470\nI'm double checking to make sure\neverything's appropriate there.\n\n336\n00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.230\nSo nothing good.\n\n337\n00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:51.460\nSo what I can do is I can hold\ndown Shift and right-click, and\n\n338\n00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:55.230\nnow all of the sudden I get this\nrunas Administrator option.\n\n339\n00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:59.140\nSo I was holding down Shift and\nthen right-clicking on the icon.\n\n340\n00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.476\nI could choose runas administrator.\n\n341\n00:18:01.476 --> 00:18:02.207\nNow the UAC kicks in.\n\n342\n00:18:02.207 --> 00:18:04.821\nI say yes, and so Notepad opens up, but\n\n343\n00:18:04.821 --> 00:18:08.161\nnow let's see what happens\nwhen I go File &gt; Open.\n\n344\n00:18:08.161 --> 00:18:11.530\nAnd we'll change this back to all files,\nhosts.\n\n345\n00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:13.275\nAnd I'm gonna make a change to this.\n\n346\n00:18:13.275 --> 00:18:14.491\nI don't wanna mess my host file.\n\n347\n00:18:14.491 --> 00:18:18.427\nSo I'll just put in a couple\nof new comment lines in here.\n\n348\n00:18:18.427 --> 00:18:24.480\nI'll do File &gt; Save, and I'll close it,\nand everything worked fine.\n\n349\n00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:28.090\nAnd only that application is\nrunning with administrative access.\n\n350\n00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:30.500\nNothing else on my system\nhad administrative access.\n\n351\n00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:35.590\nSo that's what runas is all about when\nyou need to escalate your credentials.\n\n352\n00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:38.480\nI will show the old\nschool way of doing this.\n\n353\n00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:42.800\nYou can do runas from the, if I could\nspell it, runas from the command line.\n\n354\n00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:44.910\nLet me try to zoom in.\n\n355\n00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:46.920\nI don't know if I can zoom in and\ntype at the same time.\n\n356\n00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.890\nWe're gonna find out.\n\n357\n00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:53.314\nrunas /user:administrator, or\n\n358\n00:18:53.314 --> 00:18:59.170\nwhatever user account you wanted to use.\n\n359\n00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:02.210\nSpace and\nthen the name of the application.\n\n360\n00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:07.700\nAll right, so runas /user:,\nthe name of the account, and\n\n361\n00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.850\nthen the name of the application.\n\n362\n00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:11.820\nI'll zoom back in or out.\n\n363\n00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:14.610\nI'll hit Enter, and it says,\nwell, what's the password?\n\n364\n00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:19.090\nAnd assuming I can type in the\nappropriate, let's see if I can do that.\n\n365\n00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:24.702\nAnd I don't even know my\nown administrator password.\n\n366\n00:19:24.702 --> 00:19:26.459\nActually I don't know what it is.\n\n367\n00:19:26.459 --> 00:19:29.710\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's probably a good thing.\n\n368\n00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:31.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it probably is,\nlet me try one more time.\n\n369\n00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:39.367\nYou know what?\nI think my administrator account is\n\n370\n00:19:39.367 --> 00:19:40.676\nactually disabled.\n\n371\n00:19:40.676 --> 00:19:45.005\nYeah, you don't need that slash,\nit's actually a mistake in my notes there.\n\n372\n00:19:45.005 --> 00:19:46.250\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n373\n00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:48.420\n&gt;&gt; But that is the command,\nand you know what?\n\n374\n00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.990\nLet's do this,\nbecause you can put any user.\n\n375\n00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:55.516\nSo I'll just come back here and\nsay Michael.\n\n376\n00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:00.645\nRight, I know the password for\nthis guy, I think.\n\n377\n00:20:00.645 --> 00:20:01.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n378\n00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:05.580\nnow Notepad opens up with whatever\ncredentials I happen to use.\n\n379\n00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.250\nAnd in my case, that particular account\ndoes have administrative rights.\n\n380\n00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:11.134\nMy built-in administrator\naccount is actually disabled.\n\n381\n00:20:11.134 --> 00:20:16.110\nAnd so the runas is a different user\ncommand that could help if, for example,\n\n382\n00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:17.210\nI'm in support and\n\n383\n00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:20.660\nI come and I need to run something on\nyour computer you don't have access to.\n\n384\n00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:25.020\nI can go ahead and run that as myself\nthen make those changes to your system so\n\n385\n00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:29.200\nthat I'm not giving you access to be able\nto basically break your computer later.\n\n386\n00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.060\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right,\nlike you're doing a remote assistance or\n\n387\n00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:36.670\nsomething like that and you need to\nuse those administrative credentials.\n\n388\n00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:39.720\nI'll show you one more thing here,\nwe can really drive this point home.\n\n389\n00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:45.110\nLet me right-click, runas administrator\non Notepad again, and I'll say yes.\n\n390\n00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:48.048\nAnd then I'm gonna open up Task Manager.\n\n391\n00:20:48.048 --> 00:20:52.370\nAnd we'll take a look at my details,\nI believe.\n\n392\n00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:56.430\nAnd what we'll see here is just about\neverything is running as Michael, right?\n\n393\n00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:57.780\nThat's my account.\n\n394\n00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:59.148\nSomething's running as systems.\n\n395\n00:20:59.148 --> 00:21:02.950\nSomething's running as local system.\n\n396\n00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:07.940\nBut if I find Notepad, which is\n\n397\n00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:11.480\nright there, yeah, again,\nI am the administrator,\n\n398\n00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:15.910\nso I guess it's not making it as visual as\nI thought it might, but try that at home.\n\n399\n00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:18.510\nIf you log in with\na non-administrator account and\n\n400\n00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:21.140\ndo a runas,\nyou can open up Task Manager and\n\n401\n00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:25.330\nyou'll be able to see that that\naccount is running just that one app.\n\n402\n00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:26.660\nEverything else is running.\n\n403\n00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:27.400\nYou know what I could do?\n\n404\n00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.800\nLet's do this.\n\n405\n00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.850\nWe'll do one more demo of Notepad here.\n\n406\n00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:35.170\nLet's just do,\nbecause I have another account,\n\n407\n00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.278\nwhoops, I could do,\nis I could do it this way.\n\n408\n00:21:41.278 --> 00:21:47.590\nWe could do, let's see if we can make it\nlook a little different, we'll say Mike.\n\n409\n00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:48.624\n&gt;&gt; And you know the password to this one?\n\n410\n00:21:48.624 --> 00:21:49.650\n&gt;&gt; I think.\n\n411\n00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:50.290\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n412\n00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:52.240\n&gt;&gt; This will be my test.\n\n413\n00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:52.850\nAll right, there we go.\n\n414\n00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:55.940\nSo Notepad's open up back in here and\nnow look at that.\n\n415\n00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:00.560\nYou see that everything's running as\nMichael or system except for Notepad and\n\n416\n00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.760\nit's running as Mike.\n\n417\n00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:02.840\nSo you use your imagination,\n\n418\n00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.240\nMichael is non-administrative,\nMike is the administrator account and\n\n419\n00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.530\nyou can see that just that one\napplication is running as admin.\n\n420\n00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:11.170\nSo that's what runas is all about.\n\n421\n00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:13.100\nRunas administrator.\n\n422\n00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.873\nYou right-click on an icon\nto launch an application and\n\n423\n00:22:15.873 --> 00:22:18.350\nyou should see that runas administrator.\n\n424\n00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:21.940\nIf you don't see it when you right-click\non it, try holding down Shift and\n\n425\n00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:25.740\nthen right-clicking on it, and you should\nsee that runas administrator option.\n\n426\n00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:27.570\nYou could also do it\nfrom the command line.\n\n427\n00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:32.390\nKeep in mind that the UAC is basically\ndoing a runas for you in the background.\n\n428\n00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:35.655\nSo if you see the UAC\nthat is a runas as well.\n\n429\n00:22:35.655 --> 00:22:36.810\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds good, Mike.\n\n430\n00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:39.720\nAnything else we need to\ncover on user authentication?\n\n431\n00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.570\n&gt;&gt; I think we covered just about\nall we need for this exam.\n\n432\n00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:46.660\nAll right, and like we said there\nis content back on part one.\n\n433\n00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:49.180\nSo make sure if you just came in\non this episode you go back and\n\n434\n00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:52.100\nwatch part one of user\nauthentication as well.\n\n435\n00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:52.990\nSome great info there.\n\n436\n00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:55.150\nBut that's gonna do it for this episode.\n\n437\n00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:58.610\nSo signing off for ITProTV I have\nbeen your host, Peter VanRysdam.\n\n438\n00:22:58.610 --> 00:22:59.580\n&gt;&gt; And I'm

00:00:11.016\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPROTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.016 --> 00:00:15.780\n&gt;&gt; Hello, you've made that\nintelligent choice to watch ITPROTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.510\nWe thank you and here in ITPROTV,\nwe're helping you wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.450\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we continue\non with MTA Security Fundamentals.\n\n7\n00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.820\nAnd we have an expert here,\nyou know him, I'm sure, Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.970\nMike, thanks for having me.\n\n9\n00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.140\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me as well,\nand thanks for having us back.\n\n10\n00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.050\nAnd love what we're doing\nhere with the old MTA.\n\n11\n00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.530\nSo, in this episode we're gonna be\nfocusing in on permissions, and\n\n12\n00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.050\nit's gonna be a lot guys and gals.\n\n13\n00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.720\nWe're gonna have probably a couple\nof episodes to go through.\n\n14\n00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.420\nThis is kind of your foundational\nknowledge as a IT professional,\n\n15\n00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.610\nwhen you get out there in the real world,\none of your primary functions is to assign\n\n16\n00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.260\npermissions, or control access, I guess,\nmight be a better way to say that, right?\n\n17\n00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.980\nWe talked in other episodes\nabout the triad, the CIA triad.\n\n18\n00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.010\nConfidentiality, integrity,\nand availability.\n\n19\n00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.190\nAnd how do we do that, right?\n\n20\n00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.500\nConfidentiality, making sure only\nthe authorized people have access.\n\n21\n00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.150\nThat means, controlling\npermissions is one part of that.\n\n22\n00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.870\nIntegrity, making sure that things\naren't changed unintentionally.\n\n23\n00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.030\nOr controlling permissions is part of\nthat, because if Zach's not supposed to be\n\n24\n00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.540\nable to change that file, then I'm gonna\nmake sure doesn't have permission to\n\n25\n00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.180\nchange the file,\nthen he won't be able to change the file.\n\n26\n00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.770\nMaintain that integrity.\n\n27\n00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.850\nAvailability.\n\n28\n00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.640\nYou know, if Zach is supposed to read the\nfile then he better have read permissions,\n\n29\n00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.410\nor he's not going to be able to.\n\n30\n00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.120\nAnd so, you can see how permissions really\nhelp us with all three of those pillars.\n\n31\n00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.740\n&gt;&gt; Which leads me to this one question.\n\n32\n00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.800\nWhat is a permission?\n\n33\n00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.390\nObviously.\n\n34\n00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.960\nBut let's get more into that.\n\n35\n00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.960\nWhat are permissions?\n\n36\n00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.220\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question, Zach.\n\n37\n00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.180\nAnd it's one of those things\nwhere it does seem silly,\n\n38\n00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.300\nbut in actuality there's a little\nbit of a twist to it, if you will.\n\n39\n00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.700\nWe do need to differentiate between\npermissions and rights, because\n\n40\n00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.220\nsometimes you'll hear people using those\nterms interchangeably and they're not.\n\n41\n00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.550\nNot as far as IT goes,\nthey're not interchangeable.\n\n42\n00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.570\nPermissions, which is what we're\ngonna be dealing with here,\n\n43\n00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.130\nprimarily, are how I give\nyou access to a resource.\n\n44\n00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.095\nSo, if I want to I want Zach to be able to\nread a file, I give him read permissions.\n\n45\n00:02:19.095 --> 00:02:23.405\nIf I want him to be able to write to\na file I can give him write permissions.\n\n46\n00:02:23.405 --> 00:02:28.705\nSo, permissions control what\nlevel of access you have\n\n47\n00:02:28.705 --> 00:02:30.315\nover a particular resource.\n\n48\n00:02:30.315 --> 00:02:33.260\nWhether that's full control,\nor no access at all.\n\n49\n00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.873\nDifferent from rights.\n\n50\n00:02:34.873 --> 00:02:36.952\nRights are system-wide.\n\n51\n00:02:36.952 --> 00:02:39.568\nAnd we will cover those in\nanother episode most likely.\n\n52\n00:02:39.568 --> 00:02:43.210\nBut things like being able\nto log onto the computer.\n\n53\n00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.390\nWell, that's a right you have.\n\n54\n00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.800\nIt's not a permission.\n\n55\n00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.350\nBeing able to change the system\ntime is a right you have.\n\n56\n00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.670\nBeing able to remote\ndesktop into that server.\n\n57\n00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.480\nIs a right.\n\n58\n00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.010\nIt's not a permission.\n\n59\n00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.920\nSo, permissions are gonna\nbe over specific objects.\n\n60\n00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.930\nYou have permission over this file.\n\n61\n00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.630\nYou have a permission assigned to you for\nthis folder.\n\n62\n00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.600\nYou have a permission assigned to you for\nthis active directory object,\n\n63\n00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.630\nthis user account.\n\n64\n00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.382\nRights are system wide and\nthey let you perform certain activities.\n\n65\n00:03:13.382 --> 00:03:16.790\nAll right so, that's the big difference\nthere between rights and permissions.\n\n66\n00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.310\nAnd rights are assigned\nto you through policies.\n\n67\n00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.140\nWhen you log on to a machine and you get\na token, it has all your rights in there.\n\n68\n00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.280\nLike whether, or not your allowed\nto change the system time, or\n\n69\n00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.410\nthat your an administrator.\n\n70\n00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.970\nThat gives you a whole new set of rights.\n\n71\n00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.600\nPermissions, again,\nare assigned over specific objects,\n\n72\n00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.180\nand they control what level of\naccess you have to that object.\n\n73\n00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.350\nAll right, now, before we get into\nthe specifics of the permissions,\n\n74\n00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.070\nlet's talk a little bit\nabout file systems.\n\n75\n00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.630\nKind of a little history here.\n\n76\n00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.890\nWe need to take a step back,\nso we understand where we are.\n\n77\n00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.490\nWe need to know where we came from.\n\n78\n00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.328\nAnd way back in the day,\nwhen we're talking early Windows versions,\n\n79\n00:03:58.328 --> 00:04:02.603\nWindows 95 and prior,\nwe had file system known as FAT16.\n\n80\n00:04:02.603 --> 00:04:04.910\nAnd we're not gonna go through\nevery single file system.\n\n81\n00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.835\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [CROSSTALK] I was just gonna say,\nsome of them were known as FAT.\n\n82\n00:04:06.835 --> 00:04:11.010\n&gt;&gt; Yes, FAT was [LAUGH] I\nhave a little fat, you know?\n\n83\n00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.090\nBut, yeah, we had a file system\ncalled FAT, it stood for\n\n84\n00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.060\nfile allocation table,\nthere was FAT16, then there was FAT32,\n\n85\n00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.290\nwhich was the new improved version of\nFAT16, and what it really came down to.\n\n86\n00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.831\nWith those file system was volume size,\nright?\n\n87\n00:04:26.831 --> 00:04:31.107\nBack in 95,\n540 megabyte drive was a huge hard drive,\n\n88\n00:04:31.107 --> 00:04:37.349\nFAT16 only supported partition, or volume\nI should say, in two gigabytes in size,\n\n89\n00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:41.820\nbut back in 95, two gigabytes was,\nyou know, unheard of.\n\n90\n00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.190\nIt's like, how,\nwho's gonna have two gigabytes of space?\n\n91\n00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.540\nWell, then drive technology got better and\nless expensive.\n\n92\n00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.350\nAnd so, drives started getting bigger.\n\n93\n00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.230\nAll of a sudden that was a limitation.\n\n94\n00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.990\nSo, FAT32 said, hey, we're gonna\ncome out with this new file system.\n\n95\n00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.630\nAnd we'll up that volume\nsize to 32 gigabytes.\n\n96\n00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.070\nAnd this is just one of the features.\n\n97\n00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.800\nIt's what we're gonna focus on here.\n\n98\n00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.280\nWhich was great.\n\n99\n00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.810\nUntil again, drives started\ngetting bigger and bigger, and\n\n100\n00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.720\nwe needed volumes larger\nthan 32 gigabytes.\n\n101\n00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.470\nAnd NTFS was the new\ntechnology file system,\n\n102\n00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:18.850\ncame out with Windows NT, so this was\na few years prior to the year 2000.\n\n103\n00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.490\nWe had delayed 90s there.\n\n104\n00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.430\nAnd NTFS had kind of changed some things.\n\n105\n00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.282\nOne, it has a tremendous\npotential volume size.\n\n106\n00:05:26.282 --> 00:05:29.016\n16 exabytes in size.\n\n107\n00:05:29.016 --> 00:05:29.623\nYeah.\n\n108\n00:05:29.623 --> 00:05:31.700\n&gt;&gt; Now, that sounds fat.\n\n109\n00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.910\n&gt;&gt; It does sound fat [LAUGH], doesn't it?\n\n110\n00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.640\nAnd I had to go make sure I look it\nup on Wikipedia before I do this.\n\n111\n00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.796\nCuz it's a number that you don't\ndeal with that often, right?\n\n112\n00:05:38.796 --> 00:05:43.535\nGigabytes, and then we've got petabytes,\nso, 1,000 gigabytes is a petabyte.\n\n113\n00:05:43.535 --> 00:05:46.035\n1,000 petabytes is a terabyte.\n\n114\n00:05:46.035 --> 00:05:50.610\n1,000 terabytes is a gigabyte,\nI'm sorry, wait, did I do that right?\n\n115\n00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.740\nA 1,000 gigabytes is a terabyte,\n\n116\n00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.340\na 1,000 terabytes is a petabyte,\na 1,000 petabytes is an exabyte.\n\n117\n00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:57.978\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n118\n00:05:57.978 --> 00:06:03.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so 1,000 petabytes, it's\nbasically a one with 18 zeros behind it.\n\n119\n00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.380\nIt's ten to the 18th power.\n\n120\n00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.740\nPoint is, it's large,right?\n\n121\n00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.920\nSo, it gave us that, that kind of that\nexpandability, almost future proof.\n\n122\n00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.580\nAlthough we know that things change so\n\n123\n00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.560\nfast it won't be long before\nwe need larger sizes.\n\n124\n00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.000\nBut the other big thing that NTFS brought\nalong with it, and what we're gonna focus\n\n125\n00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.470\non here, is not so much the volume size,\nit's the permissions.\n\n126\n00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.807\nBefore NTFS with FAT32,\nFAT16 you had very limited permissions,\n\n127\n00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:34.876\nthat you couldn't assign permissions\nthe way think of them now.\n\n128\n00:06:34.876 --> 00:06:38.159\nYou could basically say,\nhidden, or not, archived, or\n\n129\n00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:40.370\nnot, and there wasn't too much to it.\n\n130\n00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:45.723\nNTFS, all of a sudden every object,\nevery file, every folder\n\n131\n00:06:45.723 --> 00:06:52.725\nthat we place on an NTFS formatted volume\nhas its own ACL, or access control list.\n\n132\n00:06:52.725 --> 00:06:53.230\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n133\n00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:57.220\nthis is a list that controls access,\nhence the name, access control list.\n\n134\n00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.550\nAnd so, what we can now do is say,\n\n135\n00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.970\nall right,\nZach needs permission over this folder.\n\n136\n00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.346\nSo, I'm gonna open up\nthe properties of that folder.\n\n137\n00:07:03.346 --> 00:07:06.215\nI'm gonna go to the access\ncontrol list for that folder.\n\n138\n00:07:06.215 --> 00:07:08.540\nI'm gonna add Zach to the list.\n\n139\n00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.440\nAnd decide what permission\nI want to give him.\n\n140\n00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.980\nAnd I can do that to every single object\nthat exists on that MTFS partition.\n\n141\n00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:16.820\nSo, again, it was a big game changer,\nbecause, now,\n\n142\n00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.960\nI can really control who has access\nto what, made it a whole lot easier.\n\n143\n00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.910\n&gt;&gt; So, all these different file systems,\nI'm sure there's different types of\n\n144\n00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.190\npermissions for them,\nwe're going to get into that too?\n\n145\n00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:27.850\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely,\n\n146\n00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:31.030\nbecause it's important that we\nunderstand what the permissions are.\n\n147\n00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:35.220\nWhat permission, when you give somebody\npermission, what does it include?\n\n148\n00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:39.370\nLike so another confusing point,\na confusing point sometimes is, modify\n\n149\n00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.070\nversus write permission, do you know\nthe difference between those permissions?\n\n150\n00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.395\nRight, I need to, if this is my job,\n\n151\n00:07:45.395 --> 00:07:50.645\nif I'm supposed to control access to these\nresources, if they're relying on me,\n\n152\n00:07:50.645 --> 00:07:54.628\nor my team to make sure that only\nHR can change these documents.\n\n153\n00:07:54.628 --> 00:07:56.750\nI better know what the difference\nis between those permissions.\n\n154\n00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.233\nSo, that's the next thing\nwe want to go over.\n\n155\n00:07:58.233 --> 00:07:59.388\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n156\n00:07:59.388 --> 00:08:00.844\n&gt;&gt; Let's quickly run through them.\n\n157\n00:08:00.844 --> 00:08:05.618\nWhen we talk about permissions\nwith NTFS there's two.\n\n158\n00:08:05.618 --> 00:08:06.926\nTypes of permissions, I guess we can say.\n\n159\n00:08:06.926 --> 00:08:10.520\nThere's basic permissions or\nwhat we call standard permissions.\n\n160\n00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:15.750\nAnd then there's advanced permissions or\nspecial permissions.\n\n161\n00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.780\nAnd I might jump around just\na hair on us here, Zach.\n\n162\n00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:18.640\n&gt;&gt; That's all right.\n\n163\n00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.760\n&gt;&gt; So let's take a look at my screen,\nand I'm gonna show you what I mean.\n\n164\n00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.120\nAnd we'll talk about each one of these and\ngo through them.\n\n165\n00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:28.250\nSo here I'm at my Windows 10 desktop and\nI'm gonna open up File Explorer.\n\n166\n00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:32.840\nWe'll go create a folder just so we have\nsomething to play with our permissions on.\n\n167\n00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:39.380\nI'm gonna do New Folder, and I'll call it\nsomething like EmpDocs, or if I can type.\n\n168\n00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.820\nAnd I'll zoom in here in just\na second as we get a little closer.\n\n169\n00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.380\nSo there I'm just making a folder.\n\n170\n00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.950\nAnd I'm gonna right-click on that folder,\nand\n\n171\n00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:49.730\nI'm gonna choose Properties\ndown there at the bottom.\n\n172\n00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.800\nAll right, and on the properties,\nlet me see if I can zoom in and\n\n173\n00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.650\nstill click, hopefully.\n\n174\n00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:59.900\nOn the properties of this folder,\nyou'll see I have several tabs.\n\n175\n00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.713\nThe one we're gonna be focused in\non is going to be the Security tab.\n\n176\n00:09:03.713 --> 00:09:04.842\nAll right, remember,\n\n177\n00:09:04.842 --> 00:09:08.750\nI said every object on an NTFS\npartition has an access control list?\n\n178\n00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.520\nThis is the access\ncontrol list right here.\n\n179\n00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.280\nThis is how I control access to this\nparticular resource, in this case,\n\n180\n00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:14.930\na folder.\n\n181\n00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:17.320\nIt could have been a file just the same,\nand\n\n182\n00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.900\nthe permissions would be almost identical.\n\n183\n00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.660\n&gt;&gt; Is it too soon for\nme to ask this question?\n\n184\n00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.550\nDo we have to assign\na permission to every object?\n\n185\n00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:26.855\n&gt;&gt; We don't, and\nit's a little soon to talk about it, but-\n\n186\n00:09:26.855 --> 00:09:28.420\n&gt;&gt; Little too soon, okay.\n\n187\n00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:29.311\n&gt;&gt; It's a great question, right?\n\n188\n00:09:29.311 --> 00:09:31.276\nAt this point, you're thinking, wow,\n\n189\n00:09:31.276 --> 00:09:34.740\nyou mean I gotta right-click on\neverything to control access?\n\n190\n00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:38.010\nThere's a couple of tricks we can do,\nor that NTFS provides us,\n\n191\n00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.860\nthat will make your life a whole\nlot easier, but we'll get to that.\n\n192\n00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:45.235\nAll right, so here on the Security tab,\nagain, just some basic terminology.\n\n193\n00:09:45.235 --> 00:09:47.811\nBefore we go any further, this tab,\n\n194\n00:09:47.811 --> 00:09:53.500\nthis is a graphical representation of\nthe ACL or the access control list.\n\n195\n00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.110\nIf we're gonna be technically correct,\n\n196\n00:09:55.110 --> 00:10:00.320\nit's actually called a discretionary\naccess control list or a DACL.\n\n197\n00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.230\nI know in some of your other security\nclasses, you probably talked about\n\n198\n00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:07.120\ndifferent security models like\nrole-based access control and\n\n199\n00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:11.080\nmandatory access control, and\ndiscretionary access control.\n\n200\n00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.400\nThis is an example of discretionary\naccess control and this is the list, so\n\n201\n00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.660\na DACL for short, or\naccess control list for short.\n\n202\n00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:18.900\nEach one of these lines here,\n\n203\n00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:23.475\nauthenticated users, system,\nadministrators, users.\n\n204\n00:10:23.475 --> 00:10:27.076\nEach one of those is known as an ACE or\nan access control entry.\n\n205\n00:10:27.076 --> 00:10:31.282\nCuz we've made an entry into\nthe access control list, right?\n\n206\n00:10:31.282 --> 00:10:36.195\nAnd if I wanna give somebody else\npermissions, I'm gonna click Edit and\n\n207\n00:10:36.195 --> 00:10:37.896\nmake and then click Add.\n\n208\n00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:44.190\nAnd I would find whoever it is that\nI wanna add, I'd find their account.\n\n209\n00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.231\nI'm gonna use a group just to\nmake a real quick example.\n\n210\n00:10:48.981 --> 00:10:53.077\nAnd evidently, I'm not gonna use\nthat group like I thought I was.\n\n211\n00:10:53.077 --> 00:10:59.199\nSo let me just cheat here and\nwell, you grayed out on me there.\n\n212\n00:10:59.199 --> 00:11:03.754\nAll right, let's see if I can find,\nnope, who do I have, I have Mike.\n\n213\n00:11:03.754 --> 00:11:06.630\nI know I've got a Mike in there,\nthere we go.\n\n214\n00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:12.350\nSo I just added a new entry, a new access\ncontrol entry for the user account, Mike.\n\n215\n00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:14.510\nAnd now once I've added an entry,\n\n216\n00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:20.000\nI can control what permissions I assign\nto that particular entry, right?\n\n217\n00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.960\nSo if I want Mike to have full control,\nor if I want him just to have read,\n\n218\n00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:30.070\nI can uncheck all these other things and I\ncan give him just read permission, right?\n\n219\n00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:31.450\nSo this is how you control access.\n\n220\n00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:35.390\nYou create an entry for\nwhomever it is, a user or a group, and\n\n221\n00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:39.340\nthen you choose to either allow or\ndeny permissions.\n\n222\n00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.590\nAnd we'll talk a little bit\nmore about that in a second.\n\n223\n00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.840\nAll right, so so far,\nterminology wise we're good.\n\n224\n00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.480\nWe've got our access control list.\n\n225\n00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.830\nWe've got our access control entries.\n\n226\n00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:53.290\nThe ACE's, each one of those people\nlisted here, or groups listed here.\n\n227\n00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:54.850\nAnd then we've got the permissions.\n\n228\n00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:57.340\nNow let's get back to what we\noriginally wanted to talk about,\n\n229\n00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:01.080\nwhich was what permissions do\nwe have that we can assign?\n\n230\n00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:05.190\nAnd you can see the list here,\nand I'll start from the top.\n\n231\n00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.570\nOr actually, let's start from the bottom,\nspecial permissions,\n\n232\n00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:09.075\nI'm gonna come back to.\n\n233\n00:12:09.075 --> 00:12:11.710\nI've got read and\nwrite just above that, and\n\n234\n00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:15.640\nthese are two that are pretty self\nexplanatory, I think, for most people.\n\n235\n00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.270\nRead gives you read access.\n\n236\n00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.680\nNow if it's a folder and\n\n237\n00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.750\nI have read access, then I can\nread what's in the folder, right.\n\n238\n00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:26.330\nI can see all the files inside there.\n\n239\n00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.950\nList folder contents also adds to that, so\n\n240\n00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:32.700\nI can see details about the the files\nthat are located in there.\n\n241\n00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.600\nIf I have read over a file,\nnot a folder, but\n\n242\n00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:39.770\na file, then I can double click on that\nfile, and I can open up and I can read it.\n\n243\n00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:42.510\nBut I can't do anything else,\nthat's all I can do is read it.\n\n244\n00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:45.050\nI can't make changes to it,\nI can't delete it,\n\n245\n00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:48.230\nI can't do anything to it,\nall I can do is read.\n\n246\n00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:52.440\nThe write permission gives\nme the ability to write.\n\n247\n00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:57.437\nSo if it's a folder, then I can create new\nfiles inside that folder because I have\n\n248\n00:12:57.437 --> 00:13:00.450\nwrite permission over that folder.\n\n249\n00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:04.559\nIf it's a file,\nthen I can write to the file, right?\n\n250\n00:13:04.559 --> 00:13:08.200\nI could open the file up and\nI could delete a sentence.\n\n251\n00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.560\nI could add a new paragraph,\ndo whatever I want,\n\n252\n00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.753\nI can write to the file and\nthen I can save it and save those changes.\n\n253\n00:13:14.753 --> 00:13:18.920\nWhat you can't do with write, and what I\nreally want you to pay attention to here,\n\n254\n00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.860\nis you can't delete the file, all right,\nthat's a different permission.\n\n255\n00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:24.520\nI can open a file up and\n\n256\n00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.650\nI could backspace over everything\nthat you've typed in the file and\n\n257\n00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:32.558\nthen I can save it as a blank document,\nbut I can't delete the object itself.\n\n258\n00:13:32.558 --> 00:13:36.700\nI can't right-click on the file and\ndelete it or drag it to the recycle bin.\n\n259\n00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:40.210\nWrite permission really gives you append,\nright?\n\n260\n00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:43.330\nI can open the document, I could add\nto it, and I could remove from it, but\n\n261\n00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:45.075\nI can't get rid of the document itself.\n\n262\n00:13:45.075 --> 00:13:48.100\nIt'd be like me handing you a notebook and\na pen.\n\n263\n00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:51.210\nYou can write in there, you can erase\nin there if you're writing with pencil.\n\n264\n00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:53.620\nBut you can't throw away the notebook,\nyou have to keep that, right?\n\n265\n00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.040\nThat’s what write gives you.\n\n266\n00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:58.505\nRight above that we have,\nlist folder contents.\n\n267\n00:13:58.505 --> 00:14:00.070\nThis'll only be for folders, right?\n\n268\n00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:03.110\nYou wouldn't see this permission\nif I right-clicked on a file,\n\n269\n00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:04.950\nbecause its list folder content.\n\n270\n00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:07.940\nA file doesn't have objects inside it, so.\n\n271\n00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:11.780\nAnd that lets you use Windows Explorer and\nnavigate through the tree and\n\n272\n00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:13.820\nsee what’s inside there.\n\n273\n00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:18.070\nRead and execute gives you\nthe ability to run things.\n\n274\n00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:22.430\nIf you have a folder and\ninside that folder is a .exe,\n\n275\n00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:27.250\nan executable, or a .cmd or\na .bat, some type of script file.\n\n276\n00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:30.320\nIf you have read, you can see the file.\n\n277\n00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.974\nYou could right-click on it and\nand open it up in an editor,\n\n278\n00:14:32.974 --> 00:14:35.908\nwhich you wouldn't be able to make\nchanges cuz you just got read.\n\n279\n00:14:35.908 --> 00:14:39.540\nBut you couldn't execute it, you couldn't\ndouble-click on that executable.\n\n280\n00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:42.185\nSay you downloaded something\nthat you want to install,\n\n281\n00:14:42.185 --> 00:14:45.513\nif you only have read, you can't\ndouble-click on it and have it run.\n\n282\n00:14:45.513 --> 00:14:48.520\nYou need read and\nexecute permission for that.\n\n283\n00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:52.431\nExecute part gives you the ability\nto now double-click on things and\n\n284\n00:14:52.431 --> 00:14:56.284\nhave them perform some action,\nwhatever they're supposed to do.\n\n285\n00:14:56.284 --> 00:15:02.300\nAbove that we have modify, and\nthe modify permission expands on write,\n\n286\n00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:06.705\nthis is what gives you\nthe delete capabilities.\n\n287\n00:15:06.705 --> 00:15:09.525\nWith modify, I can open it up,\nI can write,\n\n288\n00:15:09.525 --> 00:15:13.445\nI can back space over paragraphs,\nand save it and close it.\n\n289\n00:15:13.445 --> 00:15:15.365\nBut I can also delete the object itself.\n\n290\n00:15:15.365 --> 00:15:18.775\nSo now you can take that notebook and\nthrow it away that I gave you, right?\n\n291\n00:15:18.775 --> 00:15:21.510\nThat's what modify is going to give you.\n\n292\n00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:24.896\nIn addition to, I'm gonna talk about how\nthese build a little bit in a second.\n\n293\n00:15:24.896 --> 00:15:28.920\nAnd full control is a funny one,\n\n294\n00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.120\nbecause a lot of people are like,\nfull control gives you everything.\n\n295\n00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.710\nI would tell you,\nmodify gives you just about everything.\n\n296\n00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:37.420\nThe only thing full control really\ngives you that modify doesn't\n\n297\n00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.860\nis the ability to change\nthe permissions themselves.\n\n298\n00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:45.990\nMe coming in here and adding myself\nto that list or giving Zach read or\n\n299\n00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:47.800\ntaking away write permission?\n\n300\n00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.710\nI need full control for that, all right,\n\n301\n00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:53.360\nbecause that's changing\nthe actual access control list.\n\n302\n00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.880\nFor that, you need full control.\n\n303\n00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.033\nThe other thing you get with full control\nis the ability to take ownership of\n\n304\n00:15:58.033 --> 00:15:58.542\nan object.\n\n305\n00:15:58.542 --> 00:16:03.007\nAnd we'll come back and talk about what I\nmean by ownership here in just a minutes,\n\n306\n00:16:03.007 --> 00:16:03.664\nall right?\n\n307\n00:16:03.664 --> 00:16:07.345\nSo those are your permissions,\nnow the next thing I want to look at,\n\n308\n00:16:07.345 --> 00:16:10.333\nIs how these permissions\nbuild on each other, right.\n\n309\n00:16:10.333 --> 00:16:13.966\nSo I'm gonna scroll back down and\nwe see that I've given, who,\n\n310\n00:16:13.966 --> 00:16:17.346\nin this case I've got Mike selected and\nI've chosen Read.\n\n311\n00:16:17.346 --> 00:16:20.512\nAnd you notice I checked Read and\nnothing else is checked, so\n\n312\n00:16:20.512 --> 00:16:23.010\nI can assign the Read\npermission all by itself.\n\n313\n00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:26.430\nNow the funny one,\nthe one that gets people,\n\n314\n00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:31.380\nis what about Write, if I check Write\nnotice I don't check anything else.\n\n315\n00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.500\nAnd this is where people get a little\nconfused, they're like wait,\n\n316\n00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.960\nhow can I have write permissions\nover a file but not read,\n\n317\n00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:40.770\nwhat sense would that make, wait,\nI can write the file but I can't read it?\n\n318\n00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:44.840\nIt's typically not done over files,\nit's usually done over folders, and\n\n319\n00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.865\nyou could have write permission\nover a folder but not read.\n\n320\n00:16:47.865 --> 00:16:52.900\nAnd it's not very often that we would\ndo this, but here's an example.\n\n321\n00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.690\nLet's say that I give everybody out\ntheir homework, right, and you guys\n\n322\n00:16:56.690 --> 00:17:00.310\nare scattered across the world so you're\nnot gonna hand your papers in to me.\n\n323\n00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.410\nI set up a folder, an FTP site or\n\n324\n00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:06.560\nsomething, where you can upload your\nassignment to and I can grade it.\n\n325\n00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:10.010\nWell, what I want you to be able\nto do is write to that folder so\n\n326\n00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:12.450\nthat you can save your file up there.\n\n327\n00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:15.780\nWhat I don't want you doing is\nreading somebody else's homework and\n\n328\n00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.940\ncopying their stuff and\nthen cheating, right.\n\n329\n00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:21.340\nSo I can give you write\npermission over that folder but\n\n330\n00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.915\nnot read permission,\nit's kinda cool, right?\n\n331\n00:17:23.915 --> 00:17:25.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's something that you probably\n\n332\n00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:30.160\nnever do, but I do wanna make sure you\nunderstand that by giving somebody write,\n\n333\n00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.036\nit doesn't automatically give them read.\n\n334\n00:17:33.036 --> 00:17:35.570\nIf you want them to be able to read and\nwrite, which is what we normally do,\n\n335\n00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:40.070\nyou have to check both of those,\nthose do not build on each other.\n\n336\n00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:42.570\nNow if I uncheck everything and\nchoose List folder contents\n\n337\n00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:46.660\nyou'll see that one is all by itself\nas well, doesn't build on anything.\n\n338\n00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.460\nBut if I uncheck everything and\nchoose Read &amp; execute,\n\n339\n00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:54.360\nnotice what it does, it automatically\nselected List folder contents and Read.\n\n340\n00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.840\nSo I cannot give you Read &amp; execute\n\n341\n00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.848\nwithout giving you List\nfolder contents and Read.\n\n342\n00:17:59.848 --> 00:18:06.020\nSo Read &amp; execute builds on Read and\nList folder contents, it gives you those\n\n343\n00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:09.610\ntwo permissions and then some, the ability\nto run something or execute something.\n\n344\n00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:14.620\nAll right, I'll uncheck all of those,\nand if I choose Modify,\n\n345\n00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:17.190\nlook what that one does.\n\n346\n00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:20.250\nIf you get modify information, which\nremember means you can change the access\n\n347\n00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:23.250\ncontrol list, you also get Read,\nyou also get Write,\n\n348\n00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:26.860\nyou also get List folder contents,\nand you also get Read &amp; execute.\n\n349\n00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:30.150\nIf I uncheck any of those,\nmodify goes away.\n\n350\n00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:34.100\nSo by giving you Modify it gives\nyou all those other permissions and\n\n351\n00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:38.130\nsome, and that's what I mean by\nit builds on other permissions.\n\n352\n00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:40.710\nAnd then you probably guessed this one,\nbut\n\n353\n00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:45.750\nif I go to Full control that's\ngonna give you everything,\n\n354\n00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:51.560\nright, Modify, Read, Write, List, Read &amp;\nexecute, and List folder contents, right.\n\n355\n00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.440\nSo that's how those permissions build.\n\n356\n00:18:53.440 --> 00:19:00.590\nNow these are standard permissions, 99% of\nthe time this is all I'm going to need.\n\n357\n00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:05.890\nThere are times however, the 1% of\nthe time, I'll be honest with you guys and\n\n358\n00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:07.600\ngals, I've been doing this for\n\n359\n00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.130\n15 plus years, never had to do this,\n[LAUGH] all right, but.\n\n360\n00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:15.030\n&gt;&gt; It's good to know, if you have to\ndo that it's a good thing to know.\n\n361\n00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:19.140\n&gt;&gt; You might be in a situation where\nthis has to be done for you, all right.\n\n362\n00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:23.385\nSo these are standard permissions, there\nare something called Special permissions.\n\n363\n00:19:23.385 --> 00:19:26.240\nYou'll notice right down at the bottom\nof my standard permissions there's\n\n364\n00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:31.460\nthis Special permissions, it's grayed\nout and I can't click on it, all right.\n\n365\n00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.390\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nclick Apply to what we've done so far.\n\n366\n00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:39.828\nI'm gonna leave Full control and\nI'll go ahead and click OK, so\n\n367\n00:19:39.828 --> 00:19:43.277\nnow where Mike is there and\nhe's got this Full control.\n\n368\n00:19:43.277 --> 00:19:46.089\nSo I'm back out, let me zoom back out so\nyou can see where I am, right,\n\n369\n00:19:46.089 --> 00:19:47.394\nI'm back into the properties.\n\n370\n00:19:47.394 --> 00:19:51.581\nRemember how I got here, I right\nclicked on the folder, or the file, and\n\n371\n00:19:51.581 --> 00:19:55.680\nI chose Properties, and\nthen I went to that Security tab.\n\n372\n00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:00.061\nTo make those changes that we were just\nmaking, I had to click the Edit button,\n\n373\n00:20:00.061 --> 00:20:01.880\nright, cuz I can't make changes here.\n\n374\n00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.970\nI clicked Edit and that brought us to\nwhere we were for the last few minutes.\n\n375\n00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:10.685\nNow I've backed out one screen back to\nthat Security tab where the access control\n\n376\n00:20:10.685 --> 00:20:15.190\nlist, and at the bottom of this you'll see\nspecial permissions or advanced settings.\n\n377\n00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:18.550\nClick Advanced, we like Advanced right?\n\n378\n00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.420\n&gt;&gt; Sure, go for Advanced.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's do it, all right, so\n\n379\n00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:23.680\nI'm gonna click Advanced,\nI'm gonna zoom out just a wee bit so\n\n380\n00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.230\nwe can kinda see this, and\nI have this Permissions tab.\n\n381\n00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:30.145\nAnd I can see the same entries that we\nwere seeing on the basic permissions,\n\n382\n00:20:30.145 --> 00:20:34.100\nthey're all listed right here, there's\nMike where I added him a minute ago.\n\n383\n00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:39.590\nBut I'm gonna click Edit to make changes,\nand there's those basic permissions\n\n384\n00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:44.040\njust like we saw on that other tab,\nthis is just another way to look at them.\n\n385\n00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:48.241\nBut over here there's a link that\nsays Show advanced permissions,\n\n386\n00:20:48.241 --> 00:20:50.190\nlet's click on that.\n\n387\n00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:55.234\nAnd look what happened to my screen,\nnotice we went from about 6 to 1,\n\n388\n00:20:55.234 --> 00:21:01.202\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, what is that, 7,\n14 different permissions there,\n\n389\n00:21:01.202 --> 00:21:04.810\nright, much more what we\ncall granular control.\n\n390\n00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:07.118\nLet me zoom in so\nyou can see what these are, all right.\n\n391\n00:21:07.118 --> 00:21:10.029\nSo on that previous screen,\non our standard permissions,\n\n392\n00:21:10.029 --> 00:21:14.121\nwe had the Read permission, it was one\npermission, I could just check it, right.\n\n393\n00:21:14.121 --> 00:21:19.042\nWell on the advanced permissions,\nread becomes three different permissions,\n\n394\n00:21:19.042 --> 00:21:23.470\nI can have Read attributes,\nRead extended attributes, and Read data.\n\n395\n00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:28.214\nOn my standard permissions I had Write\npermission, it was one check mark.\n\n396\n00:21:28.214 --> 00:21:32.529\nIn the advanced permissions I have\nWrite data, I have Write attributes,\n\n397\n00:21:32.529 --> 00:21:36.513\nI have Write extended attributes,\nso it became three, all right.\n\n398\n00:21:36.513 --> 00:21:39.208\nSo when you check Read on\nthe standard permission,\n\n399\n00:21:39.208 --> 00:21:43.830\nwhat it's really doing is checking all\nthree on the advanced permissions.\n\n400\n00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:47.620\nIf you ever need to give\nsomebody Read attributes but\n\n401\n00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:51.660\nnot Read extended attributes, you can't do\nit with the standard permissions because\n\n402\n00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.096\nRead gives them all three automatically,\nright, Read data,\n\n403\n00:21:55.096 --> 00:21:57.940\nRead the extended attributes,\nand Read attributes.\n\n404\n00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:01.430\nBut if for some reason you want them to\nRead attributes, but not Read extended\n\n405\n00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:04.600\nattributes, the only way to do it\nis to go into advanced permissions.\n\n406\n00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.890\nAnd now you can break Read down\ninto it's little pieces and\n\n407\n00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:10.510\nyou can be very specific or\ngranular about it.\n\n408\n00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:14.720\nLike I said, I have never in the years\nI've been doing this, had a need to\n\n409\n00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:19.640\ngive somebody Read attributes but\nnot Read extended attributes.\n\n410\n00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:23.320\nThat's not to say that you won't have to,\nbecause Microsoft feels like it's\n\n411\n00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:27.570\nimportant enough to put it here so\nsomebody must use this feature, right?\n\n412\n00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:30.058\nAnd that might be you when you get\nout there to your workplace, so\n\n413\n00:22:30.058 --> 00:22:31.777\nwanna make sure we're familiar with this.\n\n414\n00:22:31.777 --> 00:22:36.567\nIf you need more granular control then\nwhat the standard permissions give you,\n\n415\n00:22:36.567 --> 00:22:40.715\nthis is where you're going to go,\nto the advanced permissions, and\n\n416\n00:22:40.715 --> 00:22:44.953\nnow I can break it down into their\nlittle tiny components, all right.\n\n417\n00:22:44.953 --> 00:22:47.375\nI'm gonna cancel those,\nI don't wanna make any changes,\n\n418\n00:22:47.375 --> 00:22:49.760\nI'm just gonna back back out of there.\n\n419\n00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:53.140\nAll right, so now we've talked\nabout the permissions themselves,\n\n420\n00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:56.790\nwhat right of what permissions you get\nby selecting those different ones.\n\n421\n00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:01.140\nWe talked about how they build, we've\ntalked about the basic permissions, and\n\n422\n00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.320\nwe've talked about advanced permissions.\n\n423\n00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:08.780\nWhat have we got next here,\nexplicit versus inherited permissions.\n\n424\n00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:12.553\nAll right, so\nwhen we talk about explicit permissions,\n\n425\n00:23:12.553 --> 00:23:17.048\nexplicit permissions are when I\nexplicitly give you a permission.\n\n426\n00:23:17.048 --> 00:23:23.917\nWhat that means is if I right click,\njust like I did with EmpDocs a minute ago,\n\n427\n00:23:23.917 --> 00:23:29.835\nright, if I come in here and\nI right click and I choose Properties,\n\n428\n00:23:29.835 --> 00:23:34.087\nand I go to that Security tab,\nand I click Edit.\n\n429\n00:23:34.087 --> 00:23:38.703\nAnd I added Mike, right, like we did\nalready and I select Full control, and\n\n430\n00:23:38.703 --> 00:23:42.830\nI'll have to zoom, well maybe I can\nget down there, and I click OK.\n\n431\n00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:47.790\nAll right, I explicitly gave Mike\npermissions over that folder,\n\n432\n00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:50.534\nI went to that object and I said Mike,\n\n433\n00:23:50.534 --> 00:23:54.891\nyou have these permissions\nover this folder, all right.\n\n434\n00:23:54.891 --> 00:23:58.759\nBut if we think about it, and\nI think Zach, you alluded to this earlier.\n\n435\n00:23:58.759 --> 00:23:59.627\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n436\n00:23:59.627 --> 00:24:02.974\n&gt;&gt; We were talking about how does that\nmean I have to go to every single object?\n\n437\n00:24:02.974 --> 00:24:04.481\n&gt;&gt; Every object gets a permission, right?\n\n438\n00:24:04.481 --> 00:24:05.091\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\n\n439\n00:24:05.091 --> 00:24:09.679\nthat would be crazy if that was the case\ncuz it would be way too much work.\n\n440\n00:24:09.679 --> 00:24:15.728\nImagine you've got a folder All right,\nand in that folder there's 200 files.\n\n441\n00:24:15.728 --> 00:24:19.930\nAnd you need to give Zach read\npermission over all 200 of those files.\n\n442\n00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:23.860\nYou do not wanna have to click on\nevery single one of those files and\n\n443\n00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:25.690\ngive him read permission, all right?\n\n444\n00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:27.930\nBecause you're probably gonna miss one or\ntwo.\n\n445\n00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:30.500\nAnd of course, they're gonna be the ones\nthat Zach really needs access to, and\n\n446\n00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:33.290\nhe's gonna be calling you up going,\nhey, I can't double-click on this file.\n\n447\n00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:34.590\nWhat the heck did you do, Mike?\n\n448\n00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:37.890\nAll right, so\nthat's where inheritance comes in.\n\n449\n00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:38.470\nLet's take a look.\n\n450\n00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:41.660\nI'm gonna go inside the folder\nwe just created, right?\n\n451\n00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:44.732\nAnd I gave Mike explicit\npermissions over that folder.\n\n452\n00:24:44.732 --> 00:24:51.194\nI'm gonna make a new file inside here,\nand I'll call it Doc1.\n\n453\n00:24:51.194 --> 00:24:55.794\nI'm gonna make another folder Inside my\n\n454\n00:24:55.794 --> 00:25:00.537\nfirst folder and I'll call it Folder2.\n\n455\n00:25:00.537 --> 00:25:07.762\nAnd inside Folder2,\nI can make another document called Doc2.\n\n456\n00:25:10.527 --> 00:25:13.340\nAll right, so let's back out and\nshow you what I've got.\n\n457\n00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:17.850\nI've got our original folder EmpDocs,\ninside there I've made another folder and\n\n458\n00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:19.090\na file.\n\n459\n00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:22.940\nInside that second folder,\nI've got a second file, all right?\n\n460\n00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.290\nSo back out to the folder.\n\n461\n00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:29.260\nAnd remember, I went to the folder\n&gt; Properties &gt; Security &gt; Mike.\n\n462\n00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:31.890\nAnd I gave explicit permissions\nto Mike over the folder.\n\n463\n00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.220\nNow I'm gonna go inside the folder, and\n\n464\n00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:40.510\nI'm gonna right-click on this second\nfolder &gt; Properties &gt; Security,\n\n465\n00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:44.510\nand I'll zoom in, and\nlook what you see here.\n\n466\n00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:47.872\nNow, I just created this folder,\nso there's no way I went in and\n\n467\n00:25:47.872 --> 00:25:51.526\nright-clicked on and\nadded Mike without you seeing me, right?\n\n468\n00:25:51.526 --> 00:25:54.860\nI guess we could've used the magic of TV\ntime out and really tricked you guys.\n\n469\n00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:55.599\n&gt;&gt; But we did not do that.\n\n470\n00:25:55.599 --> 00:25:56.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n471\n00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.430\nZach as my witness,\nwe did not do that, right?\n\n472\n00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:01.720\nBut Mike is there on this\nfolder that just got created.\n\n473\n00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:05.290\nAnd look,\nhe has full control over this folder.\n\n474\n00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:07.160\nHm, that's interesting.\n\n475\n00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.940\nLet's go check these files out.\n\n476\n00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:13.308\nSo we'll go to Doc1 &gt; Properties\n&gt; Security, and sure enough,\n\n477\n00:26:13.308 --> 00:26:17.607\nthere's Mike and he's got full\ncontrol over this file, right?\n\n478\n00:26:17.607 --> 00:26:21.268\nAnd inside Folder2,\nyou get where I'm going, right?\n\n479\n00:26:21.268 --> 00:26:27.410\nIf I right-click on that guy, Properties &gt;\nSecurity, there's Mike and full control.\n\n480\n00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:29.625\nThat, my friends, is inheritance.\n\n481\n00:26:29.625 --> 00:26:30.696\n&gt;&gt; Inheritance.\n\n482\n00:26:30.696 --> 00:26:36.037\n&gt;&gt; NTFS, on an NTFS volume,\nNTFS permissions are inherited\n\n483\n00:26:36.037 --> 00:26:40.750\nfrom parent objects to child objects,\nright?\n\n484\n00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:45.530\nSo if I have a folder, right, and\ninside that folder I have files,\n\n485\n00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:50.050\nthen those files are children\nof that parent folder, right?\n\n486\n00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:52.900\nAnd when I assign permissions\nto that parent object,\n\n487\n00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:55.600\nit inherits down to everything inside it.\n\n488\n00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.900\nAnd that saves me a ton of work.\n\n489\n00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:01.471\nYou saw, not just files, but\nother folders inside there,\n\n490\n00:27:01.471 --> 00:27:03.481\nother files inside that folder.\n\n491\n00:27:03.481 --> 00:27:07.744\nIf I would've made a third folder, and\na fourth folder, and put a file in there,\n\n492\n00:27:07.744 --> 00:27:10.420\nit would have inherited all the way down,\nright?\n\n493\n00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:15.700\nNow, this folder that I made,\nEmpDocs, is actually the root of C.\n\n494\n00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:19.453\nSo EmpDocs is actually\na child to the C drive.\n\n495\n00:27:19.453 --> 00:27:22.572\nThe C drive itself has to follow\npermissions that allow all\n\n496\n00:27:22.572 --> 00:27:23.880\nusers to read, right?\n\n497\n00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.398\nThat gets inherited down to that folder.\n\n498\n00:27:26.398 --> 00:27:28.960\nThat's what NTFS inheritance is all about.\n\n499\n00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.780\nAnd it makes our life of assigning\npermissions a whole lot easier.\n\n500\n00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:37.750\nBecause now I don't have to worry about\nassigning those permissions to each and\n\n501\n00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:41.040\nevery object,\nif I organize them correctly.\n\n502\n00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:45.010\nI know that all my sales people\nneed access, at least read and\n\n503\n00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:47.270\nwrite to all these documents.\n\n504\n00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:50.134\nWell, what I can do is make\na folder called sales resources.\n\n505\n00:27:50.134 --> 00:27:53.316\nAnd I can put all those sales\nresources inside that folder,\n\n506\n00:27:53.316 --> 00:27:56.446\nand I can assign that permission\nonce at the folder level.\n\n507\n00:27:56.446 --> 00:27:58.340\nAnd it takes care of everything else.\n\n508\n00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:01.573\nIf I add new files to that folder later,\nthey automatically,\n\n509\n00:28:01.573 --> 00:28:04.370\nas soon as I drop them in there,\nthey're like, ooh,\n\n510\n00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:08.934\nI've got a new parent, let me inherit the\npermissions down from that parent, right?\n\n511\n00:28:08.934 --> 00:28:10.670\n&gt;&gt; It sounds like a real time saver.\n\n512\n00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:11.260\n&gt;&gt; It's huge.\n\n513\n00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:16.320\nIt makes administration and\npermissions a whole lot easier.\n\n514\n00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.550\nNow, there is one last thing,\nI know we're running out of time here,\n\n515\n00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:23.370\none last thing I wanna cover before\nwe move to our next episode.\n\n516\n00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:24.990\nAnd that is, where was I going?\n\n517\n00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:27.480\nWe talked about explicit permissions,\nlet's talk about what they look like.\n\n518\n00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:31.655\nHow do I know if a permission\nis explicit or inherited?\n\n519\n00:28:31.655 --> 00:28:32.717\nAnd do I care?\n\n520\n00:28:32.717 --> 00:28:36.770\nWell, do I care, cuz in the end read\nis read, whether it was inherited or\n\n521\n00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:38.565\nexplicitly assigned.\n\n522\n00:28:38.565 --> 00:28:42.546\nSo what I'm gonna do is I've still got\nthat document two properties opened up.\n\n523\n00:28:42.546 --> 00:28:45.169\nAnd I'm gonna pull up the properties for\nthat folder,\n\n524\n00:28:45.169 --> 00:28:48.335\nwhere we assigned informations explicitly.\n\n525\n00:28:48.335 --> 00:28:52.740\nAnd I want you to take a close look,\nI'm gonna select Mike here,\n\n526\n00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.250\nthere is my full control.\n\n527\n00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:56.819\nI've got Mike selected here,\nthere is my full control.\n\n528\n00:28:56.819 --> 00:29:00.819\nI will zoom in just a little bit,\nand you see anything different,\n\n529\n00:29:00.819 --> 00:29:05.790\nit's gonna be this subtle, but\nthen you gonna be like, duh, difference.\n\n530\n00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:07.798\nAnything Zach, what do you think?\n\n531\n00:29:07.798 --> 00:29:10.097\n&gt;&gt; I'm not immediately\nseeing anything different.\n\n532\n00:29:10.097 --> 00:29:11.584\nI don't know.\n&gt;&gt; It's a little subtle.\n\n533\n00:29:11.584 --> 00:29:12.238\n&gt;&gt; It's very subtle, yeah.\n\n534\n00:29:12.238 --> 00:29:15.610\n&gt;&gt; But once I point it out, you're gonna\nbe like [SOUND], I had a V8 moment there.\n\n535\n00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:16.437\n&gt;&gt; Please point it out.\n[LAUGH]\n\n536\n00:29:16.437 --> 00:29:17.531\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] all right,\n\n537\n00:29:17.531 --> 00:29:20.229\nwhat color would you say these\ncheck marks are on the left?\n\n538\n00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:22.387\n&gt;&gt; This is kind of looking\nlike a black right?\n\n539\n00:29:22.387 --> 00:29:24.515\n&gt;&gt; So it's the color of the checkmarks,\nthere you go.\n\n540\n00:29:24.515 --> 00:29:26.550\n&gt;&gt; So these over here are gray.\n\n541\n00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:27.560\nAnd this gets everybody.\n\n542\n00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:28.790\nIt's a trick question.\n\n543\n00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:32.629\nI always throw it on people, and they're\nlooking for different permissions and\n\n544\n00:29:32.629 --> 00:29:33.540\nthings like that.\n\n545\n00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:34.406\nNo, it's just the color of the checkmarks.\n\n546\n00:29:34.406 --> 00:29:35.148\n&gt;&gt; Color of the checkmarks.\n\n547\n00:29:35.148 --> 00:29:39.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, but the black\ncheckmarks are explicit permissions.\n\n548\n00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:43.100\nSo I know that those permissions were\nassigned directly to that folder,\n\n549\n00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:45.050\njust by looking at the checkmarks.\n\n550\n00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:47.890\nThese gray ones over here,\nare inherited permissions.\n\n551\n00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:51.250\nI know that the permissions were\nnot assigned to that resource.\n\n552\n00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:53.120\nThey were inherited from somewhere.\n\n553\n00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:56.390\nMight be his direct parent, might be\nthe parent above that, or the parent above\n\n554\n00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:59.860\nthat, but they were inherited,\nthey weren't explicitly assigned.\n\n555\n00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:01.600\nNow, why do I care?\n\n556\n00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:05.633\nLet's click Edit on the explicit,\nall right?\n\n557\n00:30:05.633 --> 00:30:06.602\nOops, did I click?\n\n558\n00:30:06.602 --> 00:30:10.442\nAnd let's go back to Mike, and\nnotice that I can check and\n\n559\n00:30:10.442 --> 00:30:13.770\nuncheck these checkmarks freely.\n\n560\n00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:18.110\nLet's go to edit on the inherited\npermissions, select Mike and\n\n561\n00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:18.975\nlook at my checkmarks.\n\n562\n00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.584\nI cannot uncheck them,\nthey're grayed out, right?\n\n563\n00:30:23.584 --> 00:30:27.771\nYou cannot change inherited permissions.\n\n564\n00:30:27.771 --> 00:30:31.227\nThere is a way, but\nit's not as simple as opening it up and\n\n565\n00:30:31.227 --> 00:30:33.700\nmaking the change directly.\n\n566\n00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:38.560\nThere's two ways, three ways,\nthat I can make those changes.\n\n567\n00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.443\nBut, unfortunately, Zach,\nI know we're a little short on time.\n\n568\n00:30:40.443 --> 00:30:40.986\n&gt;&gt; And we're there.\n\n569\n00:30:40.986 --> 00:30:42.290\n&gt;&gt; So I'm thinking we leave a cliffhanger.\n\n570\n00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:47.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in fact, there's gonna be\na part two of, of course, permissions.\n\n571\n00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:48.399\nAnd you'll wanna catch that.\n\n572\n00:30:48.399 --> 00:30:50.573\nYou wanna do a real quick recap\nof where we've been this episode?\n\n573\n00:30:50.573 --> 00:30:51.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n574\n00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:55.830\nSo far, what we've done, is we've really\ntalked about what permissions are, and\n\n575\n00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:56.720\nwhy we have them.\n\n576\n00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.540\nBecause of our NTFS file system,\n\n577\n00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:02.270\nthat's what provides us the ability\nto set the permissions.\n\n578\n00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:04.690\nWe've talked about where\nthose permissions are stored.\n\n579\n00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:09.790\nEvery object on an NTFS partition has\nan access control list associated with it.\n\n580\n00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:14.230\nI can make changes to that list,\nby adding or removing ACEs, or\n\n581\n00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:15.980\nAccess Control Entries.\n\n582\n00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:18.570\nThose Access Control Entries\nare what allow me to\n\n583\n00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:23.260\nchoose what permission you have, or\ndon't have, by checking and unchecking.\n\n584\n00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:26.830\nWe talked about the different permissions\nthemselves, what they mean, read, write,\n\n585\n00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:28.210\nmodify, etc.\n\n586\n00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:32.830\nAnd we also talked about explicit\nversus inherited permissions.\n\n587\n00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:34.782\nAnd the cliffhanger\nwe're leaving you with,\n\n588\n00:31:34.782 --> 00:31:38.084\nsomething to think about before you watch\nthe next episode see if you get this,\n\n589\n00:31:38.084 --> 00:31:39.850\nhow can I change inherited permissions?\n\n590\n00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:41.842\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Yeah, [LAUGH].\n\n591\n00:31:41.842 --> 00:31:43.210\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry,\nI had to throw that in there.\n\n592\n00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:46.560\nSo there's gonna be a lot more to\npermissions and ACE security fundamentals.\n\n593\n00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:49.380\nSo you'll wanna catch everything\nthat we're gonna be covering,\n\n594\n00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:51.020\nespecially in the next episode.\n\n595\n00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:53.178\nAnd thank you for watching

you for watching ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.214 --> 00:00:17.450\nHelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n8\n00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.220\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, as we continue\non with MTA security fundamentals.\n\n9\n00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.730\nAnd your MTA security fundamentals\nexpert is not me, no.\n\n10\n00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.030\nIt's Mike Rodrick right over there.\n\n11\n00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.350\nHey, Mike, good to see you again, Sir.\n\n12\n00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.900\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back, Zach.\n\n13\n00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.210\nI'm excited to be here as always.\n\n14\n00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.970\nAnd yes,\nwe're continuing on with permissions.\n\n15\n00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.114\nAnd we actually left our viewers with\na little bit of a cliffhanger didn't we?\n\n16\n00:00:39.114 --> 00:00:41.350\n&gt;&gt; And do you remember what\nthe cliffhanger question was?\n\n17\n00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.990\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n18\n00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.740\n&gt;&gt; I'll refresh, I'll refresh.\n\n19\n00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.790\nSo, you have an inherited permission.\n\n20\n00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:48.730\nCan you change that?\n\n21\n00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:49.850\nHow do you change that?\n\n22\n00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:50.690\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; What do we have to do?\n\n23\n00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.078\n&gt;&gt; That was the question, right?\n\n24\n00:00:52.078 --> 00:00:53.680\nHow do you change those\ninherited permissions?\n\n25\n00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.771\nCuz remember, they were gray,\nthey were kinda grayed out, and\n\n26\n00:00:56.771 --> 00:00:58.890\nyou can't click on them, right?\n\n27\n00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.985\nWell, there's actually three ways,\nif I can remember all three.\n\n28\n00:01:02.985 --> 00:01:04.210\nWe'll put myself to the test here,\n\n29\n00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.980\nif I can remember all three ways that\nwe can change inherited permissions.\n\n30\n00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.770\nAnd I'll show you here in just a second,\nbut let me go through all three first.\n\n31\n00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.330\nSo the first way is go to\nwhere they're explicit, right?\n\n32\n00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.990\nIf you're looking at a file, and\n\n33\n00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.810\nthe permissions have been inherited\nfrom a parent object somewhere,\n\n34\n00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.490\ngo back up to wherever that parent is,\nfind the explicit permissions.\n\n35\n00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.980\nAnd make the changes there.\n\n36\n00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.480\nBecause if you change them,\nthat change will get inherited down.\n\n37\n00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.540\nSo you'll, in effect,\nchange the inherited permissions\n\n38\n00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.250\nby changing the parent permissions,\nall right?\n\n39\n00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.750\nOr the explicit permissions.\n\n40\n00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.230\nIt might not be the direct parent, right?\n\n41\n00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.400\nIt might be the parent of the parent\nof the parent where you have to go.\n\n42\n00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.390\nBut find out where they're black,\nwhere they're explicit, and\n\n43\n00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.210\nmake the changes there.\n\n44\n00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.740\nSo that's one way.\n\n45\n00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.240\nThe second way you can do it is to assign\nthe opposite permission, all right?\n\n46\n00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.186\nLet's say a user has write permission that\nhas been inherited from a parent object.\n\n47\n00:01:59.186 --> 00:02:02.550\nBut I don't want them to write\nto this particular object.\n\n48\n00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.760\nI can deny write on there, right?\n\n49\n00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.160\nSo, even though the allow write is\nchecked, I'll also check deny write.\n\n50\n00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.070\nAnd I'll go over the hierarchy\nhere in just a second, but\n\n51\n00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:21.130\nthat explicit deny will end up\noverriding that inherited allow.\n\n52\n00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.990\nSo the second way you can change\ninherited permissions is to assign\n\n53\n00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.230\nthe opposite permission.\n\n54\n00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.040\nI can't change what's being inherited,\nbut I can assign other permissions.\n\n55\n00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.420\nAnd if my other permission counteracts\nthe one that's being inherited,\n\n56\n00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.280\nin a sense I change\nthe inherited permission.\n\n57\n00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.906\nThird way I can do it is I can\ndisable inheritance altogether.\n\n58\n00:02:39.906 --> 00:02:42.729\nI can say,\nstop inheriting from your parents.\n\n59\n00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:46.137\nIt's like we build a little wall and those\npermissions that would normally flow down\n\n60\n00:02:46.137 --> 00:02:48.393\nfrom parent to child,\nwe're just gonna build a wall and\n\n61\n00:02:48.393 --> 00:02:50.749\nthey're not gonna be able\ncome down any further, right?\n\n62\n00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:54.770\nAnd now couple things to keep in\nmind when you block inheritance.\n\n63\n00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.270\nYou can do it at the file level or\nyou can do it at the folder level, right?\n\n64\n00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.380\nIf I do it at a folder level,\n\n65\n00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.030\nif I block inheritance, it will block\nit from everything inside there.\n\n66\n00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.060\nAll the files inside there\nwill no longer inherit either.\n\n67\n00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.530\nOnce you build the wall,\nno more inheritance past there.\n\n68\n00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.630\nNot from anything above, right?\n\n69\n00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.609\nBut if I assign a permission\nunderneath the wall explicitly,\n\n70\n00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.990\nit will still inherit down, right?\n\n71\n00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.995\nCuz the wall's above it, so it's not\ngonna affect any inheritance below that.\n\n72\n00:03:24.995 --> 00:03:28.950\nThat'll stop everything from the parent\nfrom being able to come down.\n\n73\n00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.040\nAnd you can't be particular\nabout what you block.\n\n74\n00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.580\nYou either turn inheritance on or\nyou turn it off.\n\n75\n00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.730\nIt's on by default.\n\n76\n00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.000\nYou can turn it off, but I can't say\ninherit these, but don't inherit those.\n\n77\n00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.390\nIt's either inherit, or don't.\n\n78\n00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.937\nIt's all or nothing, all right?\n\n79\n00:03:43.937 --> 00:03:45.978\n&gt;&gt; And do you have to get another\ncountry to pay for that wall?\n\n80\n00:03:45.978 --> 00:03:49.369\nI'm just wondering.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] you do sometimes.\n\n81\n00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.947\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n82\n00:03:49.947 --> 00:03:52.671\n&gt;&gt; No, we're gonna pay for it ourselves,\nand it's gonna be better than your wall.\n\n83\n00:03:52.671 --> 00:03:57.660\n[LAUGH] So yeah, you can't be\nselective about blocking inheritance.\n\n84\n00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.660\nYou either block it or you don't.\n\n85\n00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.060\nNow, when you block it,\nit is gonna ask you a question, and\n\n86\n00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.780\nagain I'm gonna show you this in a second.\n\n87\n00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.690\nBut when you choose to block inheritance,\nNTFS has to make a decision.\n\n88\n00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.770\nCuz remember,\nas soon as I made that second folder,\n\n89\n00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.460\nthose permissions had already inherited,\nright?\n\n90\n00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.780\nThere was no time for me to say,\nI'm gonna make a folder.\n\n91\n00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.870\nDo I want permissions to inherit or not?\n\n92\n00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.000\nAs soon as I made the folder,\nNTFS creates the access control list,\n\n93\n00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.020\nit inherits the permissions,\nit does what it's supposed to do.\n\n94\n00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.350\nWhen I go back and say,\n\n95\n00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.460\nlook, I don't wanna inherit permissions,\nit's gonna ask me.\n\n96\n00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.906\nIt's gonna say,\nI've already inherited permissions.\n\n97\n00:04:34.906 --> 00:04:39.709\nSo do you want me to leave the permissions\nthere that I've already inherited, but\n\n98\n00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:41.250\nturn them into explicit?\n\n99\n00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.390\nThey're not longer inherited.\n\n100\n00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.800\nI just make them explicit for you, and now\nyou can change them if you want, right?\n\n101\n00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.910\nOr do you want me to block inheritance and\nwipe the slate?\n\n102\n00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.440\nAnd you can start with a brand new\naccess control list, and pick and\n\n103\n00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.950\nchoose what you want, right?\n\n104\n00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.740\nSo when you block inheritance,\nyou've gotta decide.\n\n105\n00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.790\nKeep the permissions that it's already\ninherited, but convert them to explicit so\n\n106\n00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.370\nthat I can change them.\n\n107\n00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.330\nOr wipe the permissions that\nyou've already inherited and\n\n108\n00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.490\nI'll start with a clean slate, all right?\n\n109\n00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.940\nAnd sometimes, one,\nit depends on what the situation is.\n\n110\n00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.226\nIf you only need to make one small change,\nit might be easier to block inheritance,\n\n111\n00:05:16.226 --> 00:05:19.307\nleave everything in place, and\njust make that one change.\n\n112\n00:05:19.307 --> 00:05:21.737\nCuz now they're explicit and\nyou can change them.\n\n113\n00:05:21.737 --> 00:05:24.599\nOr if you really need to dramatically\nchange your permissions,\n\n114\n00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:27.040\nblock inheritance,\nwipe the slate, and start over.\n\n115\n00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.850\nAnd pick and choose who has permissions.\n\n116\n00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.150\nSo those are your three ways you can\nchange the inherited permissions.\n\n117\n00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.930\nChange the parent object permissions, or\nwherever they're being inherited from.\n\n118\n00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.720\nAssign the opposite permission or\ndisable inheritance.\n\n119\n00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.890\nAll right,\nnow let's put that all into use here.\n\n120\n00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.600\nLet's make a practical example and\nsee how we can do that.\n\n121\n00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.130\nSo remember,\nif we take a look at my screen,\n\n122\n00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.590\nI've still got that folder called Mdocs.\n\n123\n00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.760\nI'm gonna pull up the properties and\nwe're gonna do a quick review.\n\n124\n00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.141\nI'll go to security and Mike,\ntheres the explicit permissions.\n\n125\n00:05:58.141 --> 00:06:00.345\nHow can I tell those are explicit, Zach?\n\n126\n00:06:00.345 --> 00:06:02.913\nYou remember?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's the color of the checkmark.\n\n127\n00:06:02.913 --> 00:06:04.218\n&gt;&gt; It is the color, they are dark black.\n\n128\n00:06:04.218 --> 00:06:05.484\n&gt;&gt; You should know that too everyone.\n\n129\n00:06:05.484 --> 00:06:08.159\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Very good,\nI love it, all right?\n\n130\n00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:11.192\nSo those are definitely\nmy explicit permissions.\n\n131\n00:06:11.192 --> 00:06:15.688\nIf I go inside that folder and\npull up the properties for\n\n132\n00:06:15.688 --> 00:06:19.989\nfolder two and\nI look at those permissions for Mike,\n\n133\n00:06:19.989 --> 00:06:25.291\nwe see those are grey,\nwhich means they are inherited, right?\n\n134\n00:06:25.291 --> 00:06:26.482\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, mm-hm.\n\n135\n00:06:26.482 --> 00:06:27.610\n&gt;&gt; And I can't change them.\n\n136\n00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.070\nI can't click on them.\n\n137\n00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.290\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n138\n00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.240\nlet's talk about the different\nways I could change them.\n\n139\n00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.260\nI could assign the opposite permission.\n\n140\n00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.370\nI'm gonna do them out of order here.\n\n141\n00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.780\nI shouldn't do that, should I?\n\n142\n00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.340\nLet's do them in order,\nthe way we discussed.\n\n143\n00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.750\nI will not be lazy.\n\n144\n00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.900\nAll right, so I said I could change\nthem if I went to the parent object.\n\n145\n00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:56.210\nSo I'm gonna go to the parent object\n&gt; Properties &gt; Security &gt; Edit.\n\n146\n00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.660\nFind the access control entry for Mike.\n\n147\n00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.759\nAnd I'm gonna uncheck full control,\nall right?\n\n148\n00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:06.540\nAnd so now it's just modify, read,\nlist, and all that good stuff.\n\n149\n00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.030\nI'll click OK and OK.\n\n150\n00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.120\nThen I'll go to the folder\ninside there and\n\n151\n00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.785\nsee if it indeed changed\nthe inherited permissions.\n\n152\n00:07:14.785 --> 00:07:19.280\nI go to Mike, and sure enough,\nMike no longer has full control.\n\n153\n00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.377\nSo I was able to change the inherited\npermissions by finding the parent that had\n\n154\n00:07:23.377 --> 00:07:26.306\nthe explicit permissions and\nmaking the change there.\n\n155\n00:07:26.306 --> 00:07:29.570\nThe downside of that method is this.\n\n156\n00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:34.225\nThat folder might've contained\ndozens of other folders.\n\n157\n00:07:34.225 --> 00:07:37.900\nAnd I only wanted to change\nMike's permission on one of them,\n\n158\n00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.254\nnot the other eleven.\n\n159\n00:07:39.254 --> 00:07:43.786\nIf I change it at the parent, that change\nis gonna inherit to all twelve folders,\n\n160\n00:07:43.786 --> 00:07:45.900\nnot just the one I want, right?\n\n161\n00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.930\nSo sometimes that method doesn't work.\n\n162\n00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:50.369\nThat's when we have to use\none of the other methods,\n\n163\n00:07:50.369 --> 00:07:53.042\nthe blocking of inheritance or\nassigning the opposite.\n\n164\n00:07:53.042 --> 00:07:54.274\nSo keep that in mind, right?\n\n165\n00:07:54.274 --> 00:07:58.523\nThere's other things that are inheriting\npermissions from the Mdocs folder.\n\n166\n00:07:58.523 --> 00:08:02.728\nBy making a change at the parent, that\naffects all child objects if they're not\n\n167\n00:08:02.728 --> 00:08:06.140\nblocking inheritance, all right,\nsomething to keep in mind.\n\n168\n00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:10.360\nAll right, we'll zoom back out and\nwe'll, let's do this,\n\n169\n00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.550\nwhat's another way that I can\nchange inherited permissions?\n\n170\n00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.810\nI can assign the opposite permission,\nall right.\n\n171\n00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:20.950\nSo dock one here, let's make a couple more\njust so we'll have something to play with.\n\n172\n00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.370\nI'm gonna do New &gt; Text Document,\nwe'll call it Doc2.\n\n173\n00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:29.520\nAnd I'll make one more document here,\nNew &gt; Text Document, and\n\n174\n00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.600\nI'll do Doc3, all right.\n\n175\n00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.460\nAnd what I wanna do,\n\n176\n00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:38.640\neach one of these if I look at them I\nshould have Modify Permission, right.\n\n177\n00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.390\nSo notice, no full control, and\nI could repeat the process for\n\n178\n00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:45.470\neach one of these, no full control.\n\n179\n00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:49.400\nThat's what I mean by if you change it\nat the parent, it applies to all child\n\n180\n00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.550\nobjects, right, so sometimes that's good,\nsometimes that's not gonna work for you.\n\n181\n00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:58.470\nSo what if I wanted Mike not to\nbe able to write to document two?\n\n182\n00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:04.953\nWell if we look at the permissions for\ndocument two, we know that Mike has,\n\n183\n00:09:04.953 --> 00:09:08.420\nhe doesn't have full control but\nhe does still have modify and\n\n184\n00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:12.670\nwrite permission, that's being\ninherited from the parent object.\n\n185\n00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:16.620\nSo you might say well easy, go to\nthe parent object and take away write, but\n\n186\n00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:22.235\nif I do that he won't be\nable to write to Doc2,\n\n187\n00:09:22.235 --> 00:09:24.910\ngood, but he won't be able to\nwrite to Doc1 or Doc3, right.\n\n188\n00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:30.910\nSo how do I say you can't write to Doc2,\nbut you can still write to Doc1 and Doc3?\n\n189\n00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:35.079\nWell now we can't use that first method,\nso we go on to method number two,\n\n190\n00:09:35.079 --> 00:09:38.196\nwhich is assign the opposite permission,\nall right.\n\n191\n00:09:38.196 --> 00:09:41.185\nSo what I'm gonna do on Doc2\nis I'm gonna click Edit, and\n\n192\n00:09:41.185 --> 00:09:43.331\nI'm gonna go into this permission list.\n\n193\n00:09:43.331 --> 00:09:49.090\nAnd for write, he's inheriting\nthe Allow Write permission, but I'm gonna\n\n194\n00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:55.150\ncheck Deny Write, and I'll go ahead and\nclick Apply to make those changes.\n\n195\n00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:58.665\nNow it's gonna warn me that denies are bad\nand you can get yourself in trouble,\n\n196\n00:09:58.665 --> 00:10:01.740\nand we'll talk about that in a minute,\nI'm gonna say yes I know what I'm doing,\n\n197\n00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.950\nMicrosoft, and I'll select yes there and\nwe'll continue.\n\n198\n00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:10.460\nSo now, even though he's inherited\nwrite permission for Doc2,\n\n199\n00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:14.880\nhe's been explicitly assigned a deny for\nDoc2.\n\n200\n00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.340\nThe explicit deny is gonna\noverride the inherited allow so\n\n201\n00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:22.760\nhe will not be able to, I, Mike,\nwon't be able to write to document two.\n\n202\n00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.460\nBut did that affect document one and\ndocument three?\n\n203\n00:10:27.528 --> 00:10:33.420\nWell let's check,\nwe'll go to Properties &gt; Security &gt; Mike.\n\n204\n00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:37.380\nAnd notice Mike can still write to Doc3,\nit would be the same for document one.\n\n205\n00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.920\nSo that's how I can get really specific,\ninstead of changing it at the parent\n\n206\n00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.380\nI can go to the actual object and\nassign the opposite permission, all right.\n\n207\n00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:51.360\nThird way we would do it would be\nto block inheritance altogether.\n\n208\n00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.690\nSo let's do that to folder two,\nand there is a doc inside there so\n\n209\n00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:57.090\nwe can test this out.\n\n210\n00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:03.710\nSo remember if I look at the permissions\nfor folder two, and I find Mike here.\n\n211\n00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:08.200\nIt is inheriting everything from EmpDocs,\nwhich is modify and\n\n212\n00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.960\neverything else, just shy of full control.\n\n213\n00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.970\nBut I don't want that,\nI want to change those permissions for\n\n214\n00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:17.150\nthis folder and\neverything inside it, right.\n\n215\n00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:21.080\nSo the easiest way to do that\nis to block inheritance and\n\n216\n00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.510\nsay hey,\ndon't inherit from the parent anymore.\n\n217\n00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:27.350\nSo to do that we need our\nadvanced permissions.\n\n218\n00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:28.150\n&gt;&gt; Here we go again.\n\n219\n00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:32.087\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we gotta get into that advanced,\nso we're gonna click the Advanced button\n\n220\n00:11:32.087 --> 00:11:35.512\nin the bottom right and there's\na button right here that's labelled,\n\n221\n00:11:35.512 --> 00:11:38.070\nappropriately enough, Disable inheritance.\n\n222\n00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:38.702\n&gt;&gt; Bing, bing, bing.\n\n223\n00:11:38.702 --> 00:11:40.860\n&gt;&gt; I know, right,\nthey make it easy for us.\n\n224\n00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:44.770\nSo I'm gonna choose Disable inheritance,\nand\n\n225\n00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:47.780\nhere's the question that you\nget asked do you want to,\n\n226\n00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:51.230\nI've already inherited some things and now\nyou're telling me not to do it anymore.\n\n227\n00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:53.720\nWhat do you want me to do with all\nthe stuff I already inherited,\n\n228\n00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.050\nconvert them to explicit permissions?\n\n229\n00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:59.600\nSo now I can check and\nuncheck them as I see fit, or\n\n230\n00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.700\nremove all inherited permissions and\nstart with a clean slate.\n\n231\n00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:07.445\nLet's choose remove,\nshall we, we'll do remove.\n\n232\n00:12:07.445 --> 00:12:11.656\nHere's one thing I want you to be real\ncareful of, when you choose remove,\n\n233\n00:12:11.656 --> 00:12:14.560\nin fact let's undo that,\nlet me cancel this and\n\n234\n00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.250\ngo back to that one more time and\nnot check it.\n\n235\n00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:22.098\nNotice where all of these permissions\nthat are currently in my list are being\n\n236\n00:12:22.098 --> 00:12:23.510\ninherited.\n\n237\n00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:27.000\nThis one's being inherited from EmpDocs,\nbut there's some, like administrator and\n\n238\n00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.040\nsystem, these are things\nthe operating system did, right,\n\n239\n00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.660\nthese are default permissions.\n\n240\n00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:35.886\nThose are being inherited from the C Drive\nitself and if I go and block inheritance\n\n241\n00:12:35.886 --> 00:12:39.505\nand say remove all, well I can give\nmyself and a whole lot of trouble.\n\n242\n00:12:39.505 --> 00:12:44.105\nBecause now all of a sudden not even\nsystem has permissions over this object,\n\n243\n00:12:44.105 --> 00:12:48.278\nif this was an important file on my\ncomputer I might be in trouble at this\n\n244\n00:12:48.278 --> 00:12:49.509\npoint, all right.\n\n245\n00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:54.305\nSo one thing to keep in mind if you\nchoose to remove all, you need to add\n\n246\n00:12:54.305 --> 00:12:59.687\neverybody back that needs access,\nthat would be the administrators group,\n\n247\n00:12:59.687 --> 00:13:03.810\nthe system group,\nany services, things like that.\n\n248\n00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:07.950\nSo typically,\nyou're usually better off, and\n\n249\n00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:13.480\nI just started it over, choosing\ndisable and then convert to explicit.\n\n250\n00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:17.478\nThis way everything's still there, but\nnow they're no longer being inherited.\n\n251\n00:13:17.478 --> 00:13:23.440\nSo I can make changes, and I can take\nMike's permission away for modify and\n\n252\n00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:27.630\nwrite, I just want him to be able to read\nand execute in that particular folder.\n\n253\n00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:31.800\nAnd I'll go ahead and click OK,\nand I'll click OK one more time.\n\n254\n00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.860\nAll right, so\nthose are the three different ways.\n\n255\n00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:38.810\nNow, let me zoom back out for a second,\nI'll go ahead and click OK to that.\n\n256\n00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:41.400\nRemember we've blocked\ninheritance at Folder2,\n\n257\n00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.036\nso you think about building\nthat wall right above Folder2.\n\n258\n00:13:44.036 --> 00:13:50.170\nDoc1, 2, and 3, these are not inside\nFolder2, right, they're inside EmpDocs.\n\n259\n00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:53.149\nThey're close to Folder2,\ndon't get confused there,\n\n260\n00:13:53.149 --> 00:13:56.573\nif we look at the tree view it'll\nmake it a little bit easier to see.\n\n261\n00:13:56.573 --> 00:14:01.142\nWhere is my PC, and\nthe C &gt; Empdocs &gt; Folder2, right,\n\n262\n00:14:01.142 --> 00:14:04.286\nso notice Folder2 is inside EmpDocs,\n\n263\n00:14:04.286 --> 00:14:10.310\nthese other guys are not inside Folder2,\nthey're just inside EmpDocs.\n\n264\n00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:13.610\nAll right, so\nwe blocked inheritance at Folder2,\n\n265\n00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:16.537\nwhat about the file that\nwas inside Folder2?\n\n266\n00:14:16.537 --> 00:14:21.450\nRight, we built the wall right above\nFolder2 so they can't inherit to Folder2,\n\n267\n00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:24.834\nthey can't inherit to the file\ninside Folder2 either.\n\n268\n00:14:24.834 --> 00:14:29.266\nSo if we look at that let's go\nto Properties &gt; Security &gt; Mike,\n\n269\n00:14:29.266 --> 00:14:34.206\nyou'll see there are the permissions\nthat it's now inheriting from.\n\n270\n00:14:34.206 --> 00:14:36.971\nActually those are explicitly assigned,\n\n271\n00:14:36.971 --> 00:14:41.588\nit converted all of them to explicit\nall the way down that tree, right.\n\n272\n00:14:41.588 --> 00:14:44.674\nSo those are, and\nI know those might be a little confusing,\n\n273\n00:14:44.674 --> 00:14:46.727\nwe went over a lot of stuff right there.\n\n274\n00:14:46.727 --> 00:14:47.306\n&gt;&gt; We did.\n\n275\n00:14:47.306 --> 00:14:51.971\n&gt;&gt; So if that got a little confusing make\nsure you go back and watch that a couple\n\n276\n00:14:51.971 --> 00:14:56.900\ntimes, the short answer then is three\nways to change inherited permissions.\n\n277\n00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.361\nChange them from wherever\nthey're being inherited from,\n\n278\n00:15:00.361 --> 00:15:04.405\nassign the opposite permission,\nor disable inheritance, right.\n\n279\n00:15:04.405 --> 00:15:08.040\n&gt;&gt; And, Mike, I love the inheritance\ninformation, that's fantastic,\n\n280\n00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:12.240\nis there a time when we wouldn't want it,\nwe don't want it, we don't need it?\n\n281\n00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well and that's when we disable\nthe inheritance yeah, that's when we\n\n282\n00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.797\njust build that wall and we stop those\nguys from coming down altogether.\n\n283\n00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:22.890\nNow another thing that we've\ngotta deal with, right,\n\n284\n00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:27.580\nso far we've been working with\npermissions from Mike, a single user.\n\n285\n00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:31.750\nAnd I will tell you that in the real\nworld we rarely assign permissions\n\n286\n00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:35.060\nto an individual user,\nwe're typically gonna be using groups.\n\n287\n00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:39.140\nAnd in another episode I'm gonna\ntalk about group strategies, and\n\n288\n00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:42.731\nhow we use them, and\nhow we use them to assign permissions.\n\n289\n00:15:42.731 --> 00:15:48.874\nBut what I do want to comment on right now\nis that NTFS permissions are cumulative,\n\n290\n00:15:48.874 --> 00:15:54.493\nand the reason we have this is because\na user can belong to multiple groups.\n\n291\n00:15:54.493 --> 00:15:59.014\nLet's say you have multiple roles within\nyour organization Your organization\n\n292\n00:15:59.014 --> 00:16:01.924\nprobably has groups made for\nthe different roles.\n\n293\n00:16:01.924 --> 00:16:05.911\nAll my sales people do the same thing,\nthey all have the same job function,\n\n294\n00:16:05.911 --> 00:16:08.273\nthey all need access\nto the same resources.\n\n295\n00:16:08.273 --> 00:16:11.448\nSo instead of assigning permissions\nto each one of my sales people,\n\n296\n00:16:11.448 --> 00:16:14.695\nI'm gonna make a group and\nput all the sales people in it.\n\n297\n00:16:14.695 --> 00:16:19.295\nNow I can use the group as a single entity\nthat represents all of my sales people.\n\n298\n00:16:19.295 --> 00:16:23.555\nSo when I have a resource that\neverybody in sales need read access to,\n\n299\n00:16:23.555 --> 00:16:26.445\nI just add the group and\ngive the group read access.\n\n300\n00:16:26.445 --> 00:16:28.425\nAnd then everybody in that group gets it.\n\n301\n00:16:28.425 --> 00:16:30.430\nThere's another group for\n\n302\n00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:33.840\nthe HR personnel because they need\ndifferent permissions from sales.\n\n303\n00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:36.360\nI can't put HR people in the sales group.\n\n304\n00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.110\nThey don't need the same\nsets of permissions.\n\n305\n00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:41.100\nSales shouldn't be able to\nread payroll information.\n\n306\n00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.530\nHR needs to read payroll information.\n\n307\n00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:46.906\nSo, typically we're gonna make\ngroups based on job functions.\n\n308\n00:16:46.906 --> 00:16:49.376\nIt's one of the groups we make.\n\n309\n00:16:49.376 --> 00:16:53.731\nBut, and again, we'll talk about that\nstrategy in more depth in a little bit,\n\n310\n00:16:53.731 --> 00:16:55.291\nbut what I wanna say here is,\n\n311\n00:16:55.291 --> 00:16:59.980\nthere are gonna be times when a user\naccount might be in more than one group.\n\n312\n00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:03.476\nAnd you pick up permissions\nfrom the groups you belong to.\n\n313\n00:17:03.476 --> 00:17:09.517\nAnd NTFS permissions are cumulative,\nthat means if I belong to group A and\n\n314\n00:17:09.517 --> 00:17:15.655\ngroup A has read permission over a\nresource, but I also belong to group B and\n\n315\n00:17:15.655 --> 00:17:19.663\ngroup B has write permission\nover the resource.\n\n316\n00:17:19.663 --> 00:17:21.733\nGuess what permission I have?\n\n317\n00:17:21.733 --> 00:17:25.082\nA gets read, B gets write,\nI'm in both groups,\n\n318\n00:17:25.082 --> 00:17:28.740\nI get all the permissions,\nI get to add them up.\n\n319\n00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:33.420\nSo in the end, I would have read and\nwrite permission over the resource.\n\n320\n00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.069\nMake sense?\n\n321\n00:17:34.069 --> 00:17:34.900\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n322\n00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.710\nthey're cumulative in that respect.\n\n323\n00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:42.650\nSo sometimes what we\nhave to do is determine,\n\n324\n00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:44.497\nwhat are your effective permissions,\nright?\n\n325\n00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:49.170\nBecause when I look at that\naccess control list, normally,\n\n326\n00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:53.250\nwe're gonna see a whole list of groups,\nnot individual users.\n\n327\n00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:58.360\nAnd I might not be 100% on\nwhat groups you belong to.\n\n328\n00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:03.440\nSo what I need to do is calculate\nyour effective permissions.\n\n329\n00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.670\nAnd what effective permissions\nare when we're talking about NTFS is\n\n330\n00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.840\ntake everything all into consideration.\n\n331\n00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:14.460\nTake the groups you belong to and\ncumulate all those permissions.\n\n332\n00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:19.150\nAnd think about allow versus deny,\nbecause remember, denies override allows,\n\n333\n00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:21.000\nand we can get some conflict there.\n\n334\n00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.460\nSo effective permissions say,\n\n335\n00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:26.730\nin the end, all things considered,\nwhat do you actually have?\n\n336\n00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:28.090\nWhat do you end up with?\n\n337\n00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:31.520\nBecause I would be wrong if\nI just looked and said, hey,\n\n338\n00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.840\nyou're part of A,\nyou have read permission.\n\n339\n00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.390\nThat's not true because you also belong to\ngroup B, and you have write permission.\n\n340\n00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:39.110\nSo you really have read and write.\n\n341\n00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:41.007\nSo I need to take all\nthat into consideration,\n\n342\n00:18:41.007 --> 00:18:43.120\nwhat groups does Zach belong to?\n\n343\n00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.220\nWhich ones are allowed,\nwhich ones are denied?\n\n344\n00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.325\nLet me add all this up,\nit's a lot of work.\n\n345\n00:18:48.405 --> 00:18:51.709\nWindows gives us a tool to\nmake that a whole lot easier.\n\n346\n00:18:51.709 --> 00:18:52.339\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n347\n00:18:52.339 --> 00:18:53.675\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know, right?\n\n348\n00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:59.571\nThere is an effective permissions tab that\nwe can use for this purpose, all right?\n\n349\n00:18:59.571 --> 00:19:03.990\nSo what I meant,\nthis is under the Advanced, and\n\n350\n00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:07.090\nif I zoom in on this Advanced, remember,\nthis is where we were to work with these\n\n351\n00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:10.760\nspecial permissions and\nthe blocking of inheritance.\n\n352\n00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.290\nThere's the Effective Access tab.\n\n353\n00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:16.850\nWhat this allows me to do is\n\n354\n00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:20.710\nselect who I'm trying to find\nout what permissions they have.\n\n355\n00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:24.140\nI don't know what permissions Mike has,\nso let me go ahead and\n\n356\n00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:26.580\nfind his account, all right.\n\n357\n00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:29.390\nAnd I'm not worried about what\ndevice Mike is logging in from.\n\n358\n00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:34.830\nSo I'll say Mike and\nthen View effective access.\n\n359\n00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:38.190\nAnd there we go, let me zoom back out, so\nyou can actually see the whole window.\n\n360\n00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:42.979\nHere you can see it telling me\nexactly what permissions Mike has,\n\n361\n00:19:42.979 --> 00:19:46.997\nall right, and\nwhat permissions Mike doesn't have.\n\n362\n00:19:46.997 --> 00:19:53.440\nAll right, let's do this,\nwhat's another way I could do this?\n\n363\n00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:57.866\nLet's go back here and say,\nchange this user to administrators.\n\n364\n00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:05.099\nAnd how about my backup operators?\n\n365\n00:20:07.591 --> 00:20:11.260\nAnd I see I can't find any of my\ngroups today, that is really odd.\n\n366\n00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:13.590\nWe're gonna go advanced and find out,\n\n367\n00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:16.200\ncuz I know I have some\nbackup operators somewhere.\n\n368\n00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:20.070\nWe'll do cert publishers,\nI'll select them and I'll click OK.\n\n369\n00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:22.770\nNow, remember the access control\nlist we were looking at?\n\n370\n00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:26.380\nAnd there was no cert\npublishers in that list, right?\n\n371\n00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:31.180\nSo, let's click OK and\nthen View effective access.\n\n372\n00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:37.280\nAnd we'll scroll down, and sure enough,\nthey don't have any access, all right.\n\n373\n00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.580\nWhat about this?\n\n374\n00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:41.080\nLet's go back up here and change users.\n\n375\n00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:46.840\nAnd I'm gonna put domain users,\nand I'll click OK.\n\n376\n00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.540\nDomain users was not in that\nlist of permissions there.\n\n377\n00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:55.740\nBut if I click View effective access,\nActually they don't, which is really odd.\n\n378\n00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.275\nSomething is going on with my device,\n\n379\n00:20:57.275 --> 00:21:01.990\nit is not talking to my domain controller\nvery nicely right now, but that's okay.\n\n380\n00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:04.139\nI think you guys understand the idea here.\n\n381\n00:21:04.139 --> 00:21:06.059\n&gt;&gt; The principle there is very clear,\nyeah.\n\n382\n00:21:06.059 --> 00:21:07.630\n&gt;&gt; This helps you figure out.\n\n383\n00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:11.510\nBecause what Windows is gonna do,\nall that stuff I was saying we had to do.\n\n384\n00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:14.390\nWindows is gonna go find\nthe domain users group, and\n\n385\n00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:16.400\nit's gonna go see if they're\nin any other groups.\n\n386\n00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.690\nAnd it's gonna start adding it up.\n\n387\n00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:19.250\nAnd it's gonna take into effect, or\n\n388\n00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:24.690\ninto account, explicit permissions,\ninherited permissions, allows, denies.\n\n389\n00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:30.640\nIt's gonna do all the calculation and\nshow me, in the end, what we get, right?\n\n390\n00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.210\nThat is known as effective permissions.\n\n391\n00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:34.730\nAnd that's something they probably\nwill call out on the exam.\n\n392\n00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:37.030\nAnd it's something that we\ncan use in the real world.\n\n393\n00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:40.170\nBecause there's many times, Zach calls\nme up at the help desk and says, hey,\n\n394\n00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:44.650\nMike, for some reason,\nI can't get into the employee phone book.\n\n395\n00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:46.360\nCan you check that out for me?\n\n396\n00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.402\nWell, the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna navigate to that employee phone\n\n397\n00:21:49.402 --> 00:21:52.593\nbook, wherever it's stored, and I'm gonna\ngo to the Effective Permissions tab.\n\n398\n00:21:52.593 --> 00:21:56.220\nI'm gonna drop Zach in there, and I'm\ngonna see what permissions it says he has.\n\n399\n00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.890\nAnd if they're all red Xs,\nokay, there's the problem.\n\n400\n00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:00.810\nZach doesn't have any\npermissions over the resource.\n\n401\n00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:03.730\nAnd then I can go troubleshoot why\nhe doesn't have those permissions.\n\n402\n00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:06.470\nBut at least I know now\nthe problem is permissions.\n\n403\n00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:10.043\nYou can't read that file because you\ndon't have read permission, all right?\n\n404\n00:22:10.043 --> 00:22:12.630\nI didn't have to go look at\nwhat group Zach belongs to.\n\n405\n00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:16.550\nI didn't have to calculate all the allows\nand denies or anything like that.\n\n406\n00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:20.600\nI simply typed his name,\nclick View effective permissions, and\n\n407\n00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.680\nit gives me the answer.\n\n408\n00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:25.011\nSo it's a very important tool\nin managing our permissions.\n\n409\n00:22:25.011 --> 00:22:28.263\n&gt;&gt; It's because they're making up those\nprank calls, they're going to stop that.\n\n410\n00:22:28.263 --> 00:22:30.670\n&gt;&gt; I think we gotta watch that guy,\nhe's crazy.\n\n411\n00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:34.854\nAll right, last thing I'm gonna\nbe able to squeeze into this one,\n\n412\n00:22:34.854 --> 00:22:39.970\none thing I kind of skipped over is\nthe hierarchy of precedence, all right?\n\n413\n00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:44.060\nWhen we look at these permissions,\nwe need to know, let's say,\n\n414\n00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:48.020\nyou belong to one group, and\nthey've got the allow write permission.\n\n415\n00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:52.090\nYou belong to a second group, and\nit has the deny write permission.\n\n416\n00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:53.980\nWell I told you,\npermissions are cumulative.\n\n417\n00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:58.180\nYou get to add up all the permissions\nfrom all the groups you belong to.\n\n418\n00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:01.620\nWell I just told you, you've got\nan allow write and a deny write.\n\n419\n00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:03.010\nWhich one do you get?\n\n420\n00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:07.480\nRight, you probably want the allow write,\nthat's a better permission to have.\n\n421\n00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.860\nBut that's not the way Windows works.\n\n422\n00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:11.200\nWindows isn't gonna say, yeah,\nthat one gives you more stuff,\n\n423\n00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.330\nlet's give you that one.\n\n424\n00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:16.400\nThere's a specific precedence\nto these permissions.\n\n425\n00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:21.560\nAnd it's basically from the top down,\nexplicit deny, and then explicit\n\n426\n00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:27.210\nallow underneath that, and then inherited\ndeny, and then inherited allow.\n\n427\n00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:31.560\nSo, if you write those down in a list,\nexplicit deny, explicit allow,\n\n428\n00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:35.680\ninherited deny, inherited allow,\nthat is the order of precedence.\n\n429\n00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:40.337\nThe top, the explicit deny,\nthat has the highest precedence, so\n\n430\n00:23:40.337 --> 00:23:43.594\nexplicit denies will always win,\nall right.\n\n431\n00:23:43.594 --> 00:23:46.387\nThere's nothing that has\na higher precedence than them.\n\n432\n00:23:46.387 --> 00:23:49.835\nSo you could get allow\nfrom 15 different groups.\n\n433\n00:23:49.835 --> 00:23:54.674\nYou could belong to a dozen groups\nthat all give you allow full control.\n\n434\n00:23:54.674 --> 00:23:59.174\nBut if you belong to one group,\none of those 15 gives you a deny right\n\n435\n00:23:59.174 --> 00:24:03.440\nexplicitly, that will overwrite\nall of the other allows.\n\n436\n00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.510\nNothing beats an explicit deny all right?\n\n437\n00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:08.236\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like we're playing\na board game almost there.\n\n438\n00:24:08.236 --> 00:24:13.041\n&gt;&gt; Yes and that's an important concept\nthough because there are going to be\n\n439\n00:24:13.041 --> 00:24:18.150\ntimes where,let's say I wanna deny\nZach access to this file, right?\n\n440\n00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:20.860\nWell, I could actually do it\na couple of different ways.\n\n441\n00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:23.770\nIt could be inherited from\nthe folder above it, and\n\n442\n00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:26.890\nthat would deny Zach the permission,\nright?\n\n443\n00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:29.600\nOr I could just not put\nZach in the list at all.\n\n444\n00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.690\nRemember, and I don't know if this\nis something we've even mentioned,\n\n445\n00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:36.160\nNTFS works on an implicit deny system.\n\n446\n00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:40.281\nIn other words I can go and\nadd you to the list, and deny you, or\n\n447\n00:24:40.281 --> 00:24:42.199\njust not put you on the list.\n\n448\n00:24:42.199 --> 00:24:43.053\n&gt;&gt; And it will deny you anyway.\n\n449\n00:24:43.053 --> 00:24:46.948\n&gt;&gt; It'll deny you anyway,\nthink about the VIP club, right?\n\n450\n00:24:46.948 --> 00:24:50.962\nYou got the bouncer out there, and\nthe red velvet rope and you walk up there,\n\n451\n00:24:50.962 --> 00:24:53.310\nand you say, hey, I wanna go in.\n\n452\n00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:55.520\nWhat does he do, he looks at the list.\n\n453\n00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.033\nWhat happens if you're not on the list?\n\n454\n00:24:57.033 --> 00:24:57.807\n&gt;&gt; You're denied.\n\n455\n00:24:57.807 --> 00:24:59.828\n&gt;&gt; You don't get in,\nyou are denied, right.\n\n456\n00:24:59.828 --> 00:25:04.460\nNobody had to put your name on the list\nand say hey, don't allow Mike to come in.\n\n457\n00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.875\nThey just don't put you on the list and\nyou don't get in.\n\n458\n00:25:06.875 --> 00:25:09.343\nIt's the same thing with NTFS files and\nfolders,\n\n459\n00:25:09.343 --> 00:25:12.000\nif I don't add you to the list\nyou don't get access.\n\n460\n00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.860\nI don't have to deny you but\n\n461\n00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:17.690\nwhat if I didn't want Zack\nto have access to that file?\n\n462\n00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:22.710\nBut some other admin added the HR group\nand gave them permission over the file.\n\n463\n00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:25.508\nAnd they didn't realize that\nZack was in that group.\n\n464\n00:25:25.508 --> 00:25:27.240\nWell since Zack belongs to the group and\n\n465\n00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:30.010\nthe group was given permission,\nZack now has that permission.\n\n466\n00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:33.891\nSo even though I left him on the list,\nleft him off of the list intentionally so\n\n467\n00:25:33.891 --> 00:25:35.456\nthat he wouldn't get access.\n\n468\n00:25:35.456 --> 00:25:39.141\nHe still managed to get access\nbecause he belongs to some group and\n\n469\n00:25:39.141 --> 00:25:41.200\nthat group got access, right?\n\n470\n00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.325\nAnd that's the way it would work all right\n&gt;&gt; That's good information to know.\n\n471\n00:25:43.325 --> 00:25:48.819\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but if I go to that resource and\nI explicitly deny Zack.\n\n472\n00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:53.530\nNow it doesn't matter what groups\nare there and what permissions they have,\n\n473\n00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:56.760\nbecause the explicit deny will\nalways override the allows, right?\n\n474\n00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:59.696\nSo that's why sometimes,\nwe need to do explicit denies.\n\n475\n00:25:59.696 --> 00:26:02.374\nBecause we wanna make sure that\nno matter whatever else happens,\n\n476\n00:26:02.374 --> 00:26:04.037\nnot matter what groups you get added to.\n\n477\n00:26:04.037 --> 00:26:06.817\nNo matter what groups get added\nto the access control list,\n\n478\n00:26:06.817 --> 00:26:08.547\nyou're still denied access right.\n\n479\n00:26:08.547 --> 00:26:10.143\nWe've got contractors that work for\nus, and\n\n480\n00:26:10.143 --> 00:26:12.250\nthey've got accounts in\nour active directory.\n\n481\n00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:16.090\nThey cannot get into\nthe financial information.\n\n482\n00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:20.110\nI could take a chance, not add them to the\nlist and hope they never get access to it.\n\n483\n00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:22.810\nOr I could explicitly deny\nthe contractors group\n\n484\n00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:25.700\nto ensure that they\nnever get access to it.\n\n485\n00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:28.850\nNow that's why Windows pops up\nthat warning though all right.\n\n486\n00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:31.840\nBecause you can get yourself in\ntrouble with explicit denies,\n\n487\n00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.360\nyou give an explicit deny to Zack.\n\n488\n00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:36.440\nAnd then later on Zack\nchanges departments, and\n\n489\n00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.830\nhe get in this other department that\nnow needs access to the resource.\n\n490\n00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:43.840\nSo IT adds him to the group that everybody\nelse is in that gives them permissions.\n\n491\n00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.966\nAnd Zack comes to you and\nsays I still can't get access.\n\n492\n00:26:46.966 --> 00:26:50.060\nAnd you're pulling your hair out\ngoing why can't Zack get access?\n\n493\n00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:54.570\nHe's in the group, everybody else in\nthe group has access, why can't Zack?\n\n494\n00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:58.784\nThere was an explicit deny that's\noverriding everything else right?\n\n495\n00:26:58.784 --> 00:27:02.507\nSo explicits can get you into a little\nbit of a trouble if you're not careful.\n\n496\n00:27:02.507 --> 00:27:07.354\nYou use them very sparingly, only where\nI would need to 100% assure you'd never\n\n497\n00:27:07.354 --> 00:27:09.780\nget access to that resource, right?\n\n498\n00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:12.257\nLike that contractor's group or\nsomething like that.\n\n499\n00:27:12.257 --> 00:27:14.582\n&gt;&gt; Well Mike, you know I think we're\ngonna need a part three aren't we?\n\n500\n00:27:14.582 --> 00:27:17.569\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH] I was gonna say,\nI'm running out of air for this one and\n\n501\n00:27:17.569 --> 00:27:18.941\nwe still have more to go Zach.\n\n502\n00:27:18.941 --> 00:27:20.442\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we absolutely do and\n\n503\n00:27:20.442 --> 00:27:24.737\nit's exciting because this is\ninformation we need on a regular basis.\n\n504\n00:27:24.737 --> 00:27:28.420\nMTAs, security fundamentals,\nthis is permissions part two.\n\n505\n00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:30.628\nWe have a part one and\nthere will be a part three.\n\n506\n00:27:30.628 --> 00:27:32.026\nYou want to see all of those.\n\n507\n00:27:32.026 --> 00:27:34.520\nOnce again Mike thanks for\ndoing a great job.\n\n508\n00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:38.858\nYou're watching ITProTV,\nyou know an IT Pro is always

00:00:10.590\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.670\n&gt;&gt; Hello again, and\nthank you for choosing ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.680\nWe are helping you learn wherever you go,\nand we like doing that.\n\n6\n00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.980\nAnd we're gonna continue on\nwith MTA Security Fundamentals.\n\n7\n00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.600\nAnd I'm your host, Zach Memos, for that.\n\n8\n00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.630\nBut I'm not the expert, no, the guy\nwho knows everything, right over here,\n\n9\n00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.230\nMike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.566\nMike, thanks for taking us through this.\n\n11\n00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:34.119\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\nI don't know about knowing everything, but\n\n12\n00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:36.976\nI will try to impart some of my limited\nknowledge to you guys out there.\n\n13\n00:00:36.976 --> 00:00:38.505\n&gt;&gt; You have lots of knowledge, you do.\n\n14\n00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:39.899\nAnd we're talking about permissions.\n\n15\n00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.778\nNow this is part 3,\nthere is a permissions part 2.\n\n16\n00:00:42.778 --> 00:00:46.460\nThere is a permissions part 1, you can\nwatch it in the library, which is great.\n\n17\n00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.130\nOne of the things that makes ITPro so\n\n18\n00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.620\nawesome is we have that library\nthat you have access to.\n\n19\n00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.960\nAnd so let's go into permissions, okay,\nand I know that when we were talking about\n\n20\n00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.114\nthis before, you had mentioned full\ncontrol being one of the permissions, and\n\n21\n00:01:00.114 --> 00:01:01.670\nwhat exactly does that mean?\n\n22\n00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.702\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nfull control was that odd one, right?\n\n23\n00:01:03.702 --> 00:01:07.960\nWe talked about how modified permission\ngives you just about everything.\n\n24\n00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.045\nYou can delete the file.\nI mean, if you can delete the file,\n\n25\n00:01:10.045 --> 00:01:11.790\nyou can do anything you want, right?\n\n26\n00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.760\nYou can read, you can write, you can list,\nyou can execute, you can delete it.\n\n27\n00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.687\nSo that's what modify does.\n\n28\n00:01:16.687 --> 00:01:21.070\nSo if modify gives us all of that,\nwhat the heck does full control do?\n\n29\n00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.470\nAnd why is it even better than modify?\n\n30\n00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.380\nWhat else is there to give you\nwhen I give you full control?\n\n31\n00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.330\nAnd the answer to that is the ability\nto take ownership of a document and\n\n32\n00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.940\nthe ability to modify\nthe access control list.\n\n33\n00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.680\nThat's what full control gives you.\n\n34\n00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.375\nRemember, if I have modify,\nI can do just about everything.\n\n35\n00:01:41.375 --> 00:01:45.245\nBut I can't change the permissions,\nI can't get mad at Zach and\n\n36\n00:01:45.245 --> 00:01:47.185\ntake his permissions away, right?\n\n37\n00:01:47.185 --> 00:01:51.275\nOr add my buddy, so that he can read\nsomething he shouldn't be able to read.\n\n38\n00:01:51.275 --> 00:01:55.908\nModify is close to full controls we\ntypically give most of our employees.\n\n39\n00:01:55.908 --> 00:01:58.941\nBecause full control takes\nit up just a notch, and\n\n40\n00:01:58.941 --> 00:02:04.080\nit allows you to change the access control\nlist and also take that ownership.\n\n41\n00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.150\nSo changing the access control list,\nwe know what that does,\n\n42\n00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.160\nthat changes permissions, right?\n\n43\n00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.420\nBut what is this ownership thing, right?\n\n44\n00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.550\nWell, every object on an NTSF partition\nhas an owner associated with it.\n\n45\n00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.840\nAnd the owner by default is\nwhoever created that object.\n\n46\n00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.020\nSo if you right click New File or\n\n47\n00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.210\nNew Folder, you are the owner\nof that folder or that file.\n\n48\n00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.100\nAnd as the owner,\nyou automatically get full control.\n\n49\n00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.920\nI don't have to go in there and add you.\n\n50\n00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.140\nIf I did, it'll do it for us.\n\n51\n00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.240\nBut I don't have to give\nyou any other permissions.\n\n52\n00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.420\nYou created it,\n\n53\n00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.480\ntherefore you're the owner of that object,\nyou've got full control, all right.\n\n54\n00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.110\nNow, the downside of that, or\nthere's an issue we can have with that.\n\n55\n00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.433\nBecause let's say Zach\nspends some time and\n\n56\n00:02:50.433 --> 00:02:54.012\nhe makes this great Excel spreadsheet\nthat has all the employees and\n\n57\n00:02:54.012 --> 00:02:57.618\ntheir office numbers and\ntheir extensions and all that good stuff.\n\n58\n00:02:57.618 --> 00:03:01.920\nAnd he shares it out with everybody,\nso everybody can use it, fantastic.\n\n59\n00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.320\nBut Zach created it, so Zach's the owner.\n\n60\n00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.770\nNow, at this point,\nwhat if Zach gets upset with somebody?\n\n61\n00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.632\nHe could go in and\nremove them and say, Mike,\n\n62\n00:03:09.632 --> 00:03:12.037\nyou don't get access to my\nbeautiful phone book anymore.\n\n63\n00:03:12.037 --> 00:03:14.285\nThat doesn't really seem fair.\n\n64\n00:03:14.285 --> 00:03:16.440\nZach's not in a position to\nmake those decisions, but\n\n65\n00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.360\nbecause he's the owner, he can do that,\nright, he can change those permissions.\n\n66\n00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.910\nSo normally what's gonna happen in an\norganization is, important documents like\n\n67\n00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.570\nthat, resources that our company uses,\nor our department uses,\n\n68\n00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.370\nwe're gonna change the ownership\nusually to the administrator's group.\n\n69\n00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.870\nThat way, no single employee is the owner\nand can mess with the permissions.\n\n70\n00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.076\nWhat if Zach leaves the organization?\n\n71\n00:03:44.076 --> 00:03:47.611\nAnd then I've got a document\nthat the owner is no longer even\n\n72\n00:03:47.611 --> 00:03:50.520\na valid user account in\nmy directory services.\n\n73\n00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.460\nAnd that could potentially\ncause issues down the road.\n\n74\n00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.950\nSo taking ownership is simply changing\nwho the owner of the resource is.\n\n75\n00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.600\nAnybody in the administrator's group\nalways has take ownership permission.\n\n76\n00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.968\nAnd that's a good thing, right?\n\n77\n00:04:05.968 --> 00:04:10.644\nWhat if Zach decided he didn't want\nthe administrators messing with his stuff?\n\n78\n00:04:10.644 --> 00:04:14.149\nI know the administrators are supposed\nto be able to see everything, but\n\n79\n00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:15.870\nI don't want them to see my stuff.\n\n80\n00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.600\nSo I'm gonna remove the administrators\nfrom the access control list altogether.\n\n81\n00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.620\nOr I'm gonna deny them access.\n\n82\n00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.240\nWell, it would prevent\nme as an administrator\n\n83\n00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.170\nfrom accessing that document.\n\n84\n00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.060\nBut I always have take\nownership permissions.\n\n85\n00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.770\nSo even though he denied me access,\nand I double click on the file,\n\n86\n00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.020\nit says access denied,\nI get the big red x there.\n\n87\n00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.940\nAs an administrator,\nI can pull up the properties, and\n\n88\n00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.510\nI can go to the advanced properties,\nand I can choose take ownership.\n\n89\n00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.450\nNow once I've taken ownership,\nI can modify the access control list.\n\n90\n00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.940\nAnd I can say, sorry, Zach, I still have\naccess to all of your stuff, all right?\n\n91\n00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.530\nSo that's something to keep in mind.\n\n92\n00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.245\nI like to let the employees and\n\n93\n00:04:54.245 --> 00:04:57.497\nthe other workers think they can take\nthings away from the administrators group.\n\n94\n00:04:57.497 --> 00:05:02.550\nBut in the end, the administrator can\nalways take ownership of an object.\n\n95\n00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.120\nAnd let me show you real quick how to do\nthat, so if we take a look at my Windows\n\n96\n00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.510\n10 desktop, I'm gonna fire up my explorer,\nnavigate back and see.\n\n97\n00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.811\nAnd I'm just gonna use\nthis folder down here,\n\n98\n00:05:14.811 --> 00:05:17.893\nI'm gonna right click on that folder and\nchoose Properties.\n\n99\n00:05:17.893 --> 00:05:22.412\nI'll go to the Security tab, and then\nI'm gonna click that Advanced button, so\n\n100\n00:05:22.412 --> 00:05:25.490\nI can get to the Advanced Security tab.\n\n101\n00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.420\nAnd right up at the top,\nyou'll see it says owner, Mike Rodrick.\n\n102\n00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:36.698\nAnd that's because Mike is the one\nthat created that folder, all right?\n\n103\n00:05:36.698 --> 00:05:40.898\nNow what I'm going to do as Mike,\nI'm going to find the administrators,\n\n104\n00:05:40.898 --> 00:05:43.000\nand I'm gonna get rid of them.\n\n105\n00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.445\nI don't like those darn administrators.\n\n106\n00:05:44.445 --> 00:05:46.136\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll click Remove, and\n\n107\n00:05:46.136 --> 00:05:49.640\nnotice they're now gone from the list,\nall right?\n\n108\n00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:54.620\nMaybe I'll even take out everybody else\nhere, I'll remove them, I'll remove them.\n\n109\n00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.700\nI'm just gonna leave System and me, and\nI'll click OK, and I'll click OK, and\n\n110\n00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.273\nI'll go ahead and close that.\n\n111\n00:06:00.273 --> 00:06:02.729\nNow I'm gonna log out as Mike.\n\n112\n00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.380\nAnd I'm gonna log back\nin as the administrator.\n\n113\n00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.022\nAll right, so we'll do Other User, and\n\n114\n00:06:13.022 --> 00:06:16.482\nI'll do Lab/Administrator.\n\n115\n00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:22.010\nAnd we'll get in there, and\nI think I notice my problem.\n\n116\n00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.520\nRemember earlier,\n\n117\n00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.660\nI was saying that some of those groups\nweren't showing up like they should?\n\n118\n00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.350\nI just noticed the domain admins\nwere not in that list either, so\n\n119\n00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.400\nI do have an issue with my domain,\nbut that's another day, another story.\n\n120\n00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.122\nI'm gonna come back into explorer,\n\n121\n00:06:34.122 --> 00:06:36.358\nremember I'm logged on\nas Administrator now.\n\n122\n00:06:36.358 --> 00:06:40.636\nAnd I'm gonna go into M docs, and I'm\ngonna double click on folder 2, and look,\n\n123\n00:06:40.636 --> 00:06:42.040\nI don't have access.\n\n124\n00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.017\nEven though I'm the domain admin,\nI don't have access.\n\n125\n00:06:44.017 --> 00:06:45.063\nMike did a number on me.\n\n126\n00:06:45.063 --> 00:06:45.981\n&gt;&gt; Well, well, well.\n\n127\n00:06:45.981 --> 00:06:47.710\n&gt;&gt; I know, but here's what I can do.\n\n128\n00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.716\nNow, I could have simply clicked Continue,\nand it would have done all this for me,\n\n129\n00:06:51.716 --> 00:06:52.700\nbut that's no fun.\n\n130\n00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.940\nI wanna show you guys how to do it.\n\n131\n00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.190\n&gt;&gt; One step at a time.\n\n132\n00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I'm gonna right click\non folder 2 and Properties.\n\n133\n00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.829\nSo even though I'm denied access,\nI can't even read that folder,\n\n134\n00:07:02.829 --> 00:07:05.918\nI can still open up the properties,\ncuz I'm an administrator.\n\n135\n00:07:05.918 --> 00:07:07.804\nI can go to Security, and it says,\n\n136\n00:07:07.804 --> 00:07:11.560\nyou must have at least read\npermission to view the properties.\n\n137\n00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.320\nI can't even see them.\n\n138\n00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.930\nBut I can click Advanced.\n\n139\n00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:15.785\n&gt;&gt; That magic button.\n\n140\n00:07:15.785 --> 00:07:19.675\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh, and notice it says up here,\nunable to display, oops,\n\n141\n00:07:19.675 --> 00:07:21.373\nwhy am I not zooming in?\n\n142\n00:07:21.373 --> 00:07:24.440\nI gotta install zoom in\non this account as well.\n\n143\n00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.180\nYou guys know what that says,\nI'll read it to you.\n\n144\n00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:30.290\nUnable to display current owner\nbecause I don't have any permissions.\n\n145\n00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.832\nBut I can click Change and I can find,\n\n146\n00:07:32.832 --> 00:07:36.366\nlet's see if it will find\ndomain admins this time.\n\n147\n00:07:39.282 --> 00:07:44.703\nAll right, there we go, domain admins,\nand I'll click OK, and there we go.\n\n148\n00:07:44.703 --> 00:07:48.128\nAnd I also want to, because remember,\nwe're talking about inheritance,\n\n149\n00:07:48.128 --> 00:07:51.243\nthat might have changed the owner\non files underneath there as well.\n\n150\n00:07:51.243 --> 00:07:55.084\nSo I'm just gonna replace the owner\non subcontainers and objects as well.\n\n151\n00:07:55.084 --> 00:07:56.948\nAnd I'll click OK.\n\n152\n00:07:56.948 --> 00:08:00.044\nAnd it says, I don't have contents,\nall permissions replaced?\n\n153\n00:08:00.044 --> 00:08:03.071\nIf you say yes, I'll say yes cuz\nthat's what I'm trying to do.\n\n154\n00:08:03.071 --> 00:08:06.150\nAnd now all of a sudden,\nI can get into Doc2.\n\n155\n00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:10.549\nSo even though Mike thought he was able\nto take permissions away from the admins,\n\n156\n00:08:10.549 --> 00:08:11.333\nhe could not.\n\n157\n00:08:11.333 --> 00:08:14.595\nAnd it didn't change it on\nthis file inside there.\n\n158\n00:08:14.595 --> 00:08:17.860\n[COUGH] But that's okay,\nit did work on the folder.\n\n159\n00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.490\nSo that's what ownership is all about.\n\n160\n00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:22.620\nIt's really something that we\ndon't deal with very often.\n\n161\n00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:26.680\nBut there might be a time when an employee\ncreates a document but you don't want them\n\n162\n00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.690\nto be the owner of the document\nbecause they can change permissions.\n\n163\n00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.970\nSo you can maybe change that owner\nto the administrators group, and\n\n164\n00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:40.190\nthen reduce their full control to modify\nor maybe even just read and write.\n\n165\n00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:40.690\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n166\n00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.600\n&gt;&gt; All right, Zach, the next thing, let\nme cancel out of all these things here.\n\n167\n00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.430\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n168\n00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.272\nswitch back to my other account\njust to keep things simple.\n\n169\n00:08:49.272 --> 00:08:52.860\nI don't like logging on, I shouldn't\nbe running things as your main admin.\n\n170\n00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.630\nWe talked about the principle\nof least privileged and\n\n171\n00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:58.400\nI should log on with my\nstandard user account.\n\n172\n00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.410\nSo I will follow my own best practices.\n\n173\n00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:05.580\nAnd the next thing we wanna talk\nabout Zach is what happens with these\n\n174\n00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.290\npermissions when we start\nmoving things around.\n\n175\n00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:09.960\n&gt;&gt; In disks, different disks?\n\n176\n00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.107\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, so\nwe assign these permissions.\n\n177\n00:09:12.107 --> 00:09:16.480\nRemember, NTFS, every object has its\naccess control list associated with it.\n\n178\n00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.112\nAnd we saw that.\n\n179\n00:09:17.112 --> 00:09:21.350\nWe right-clicked on the file and changed\nthe permissions and all that good stuff.\n\n180\n00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:26.950\nWhat I need to know now is what\nhappens if I move that file?\n\n181\n00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:28.590\nDoes that access control list go with it?\n\n182\n00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:32.250\nDoes everything stay, or does it change?\n\n183\n00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.755\nAnd the answer is, yes and no,\nor sometimes and sometimes not.\n\n184\n00:09:36.755 --> 00:09:40.270\n[LAUGH] It's actually very simple.\n\n185\n00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:43.430\nI'm gonna show you a very\nsimple way to remember this.\n\n186\n00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:46.680\nThere's four things I can\ndo with an object, right?\n\n187\n00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.870\nI can copy an object from\n\n188\n00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:54.020\none place in a volume to another\nplace in the same volume.\n\n189\n00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:59.520\nSo I copy something from C: and\nI paste it somewhere else on C:.\n\n190\n00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.000\nSo I didn't leave that volume, right?\n\n191\n00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000\nOr I could copy it between volumes.\n\n192\n00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.450\nI could copy it from C: to D:, right?\n\n193\n00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.430\nNow I've moved volumes.\n\n194\n00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:13.120\nI could move something within a volume.\n\n195\n00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:17.590\nMove it from one location on\nC: to somewhere else on C:.\n\n196\n00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:19.690\nOr I could move it across volumes.\n\n197\n00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:22.324\nMove it from C: to D:.\n\n198\n00:10:22.324 --> 00:10:26.330\nSo there's four things I can do,\ncopy it within the volume,\n\n199\n00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:31.980\ncopy it between volumes, move it within\nthe volume, move it between the volumes.\n\n200\n00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.665\nSo you need to know what happens\nin those four situations.\n\n201\n00:10:34.665 --> 00:10:36.790\nYou're like gosh Mike.\n\n202\n00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:39.110\nThat's gonna be a lot of memorization.\n\n203\n00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:40.250\nIt's actually not.\n\n204\n00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.100\nHere's what you're gonna remember.\n\n205\n00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:47.710\nIf you move it within a volume,\n\n206\n00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:52.770\nmove it from C: to somewhere else in C:,\nthe permissions stay exactly the same.\n\n207\n00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.620\nAnything else you do,\nthe permissions change.\n\n208\n00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.520\nThey inherit from their new parent.\n\n209\n00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.940\nSo there you go, there's really only\none thing you need to remember.\n\n210\n00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.640\nMoving it within a volume,\nit retains its permissions.\n\n211\n00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.270\nCopying it within a volume,\ncopying it between volumes,\n\n212\n00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:11.750\nmoving it between volumes,\nit changes the permissions.\n\n213\n00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:15.332\nThe only time it retains it\nis moving it within a volume.\n\n214\n00:11:15.332 --> 00:11:19.318\nIf you can remember that one,\nmove within a volume they say the same,\n\n215\n00:11:19.318 --> 00:11:22.983\neverything else is going to\nchange the permissions all right?\n\n216\n00:11:22.983 --> 00:11:25.022\nNow let's talk real quick about why.\n\n217\n00:11:25.022 --> 00:11:29.220\nBecause it's easy for me to stand up\nhere and say this what's gonna happen.\n\n218\n00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:32.588\nBut if you understand why I think\nit will make more sense and\n\n219\n00:11:32.588 --> 00:11:35.690\nit'll make it a little\nbit easier to remember.\n\n220\n00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:37.374\n&gt;&gt; Mike I'd like to ask why that happens.\n\n221\n00:11:37.374 --> 00:11:40.344\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Perfect, I love it..\n\n222\n00:11:40.344 --> 00:11:42.161\nThis guy is great to work with.\n\n223\n00:11:42.161 --> 00:11:43.536\nThank you for that question, Zach.\n\n224\n00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:46.550\n[LAUGH] So yes, why is it?\n\n225\n00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:47.510\nThat's a great question.\n\n226\n00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:50.890\nSo if you copy something,\n\n227\n00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:54.900\nimagine I've got object A here,\nand I wanna make a copy of that.\n\n228\n00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:59.010\nWell, when I make a copy of it\nthe original is still there, right?\n\n229\n00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:03.090\nI've made a duplicate of it, but\nthe duplicate is a new object.\n\n230\n00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:07.930\nSo according to the file system the access\ncontrol list stays with the original,\n\n231\n00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.390\nthe copy is a new object.\n\n232\n00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:13.450\nAnd when I paste it,\nit's gonna look at its parents and\n\n233\n00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:17.920\nit's gonna inherit permissions from there,\njust like NTFS is supposed to do, right?\n\n234\n00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.240\nSo, now does that make\na little more sense?\n\n235\n00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:24.850\nWhen you copy something,\nit's a new object, so it gets a new list.\n\n236\n00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:28.870\nWhether you copy it on the same volume,\nor copy it between volumes.\n\n237\n00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:32.950\nIt's still a new object, and it's going\nto get a new access control list.\n\n238\n00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:36.010\nSo it's gonna inherit\nfrom it's new parents.\n\n239\n00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:41.526\nIf you move it, from C: to D:,\nwhat's really happening behind\n\n240\n00:12:41.526 --> 00:12:47.564\nthe scenes is you're copying the original,\nmaking a duplicate of it.\n\n241\n00:12:47.564 --> 00:12:50.177\nAnd you're pasting it over\nhere on that new volume.\n\n242\n00:12:50.177 --> 00:12:54.150\nAnd then we're deleting\nthe original that's what moving is.\n\n243\n00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:59.120\nYou're making a copy, moving it over\nhere and deleting the original.\n\n244\n00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.780\nSo when you make the copy and\nyou paste it over here,\n\n245\n00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:04.760\nit gets a new access control list.\n\n246\n00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:08.960\nThe original along with its\naccess control list gets deleted.\n\n247\n00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:13.390\nSo that's why when you move between\nvolumes, it inherits from its new parent.\n\n248\n00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:17.986\nThe only time it stays the same is\nwhen you move it within a volume.\n\n249\n00:13:17.986 --> 00:13:20.780\nAnd that's because of the way\nthe file system works.\n\n250\n00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:23.640\nRemember when you write\na file to the hard drive,\n\n251\n00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:28.690\nin the file allocation table is a pointer\nto where on that hard drive that file is.\n\n252\n00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:33.480\nIf you move it within a volume\nthe actual file never moves.\n\n253\n00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.870\nThe pointer just gets reset\nto its new location, right?\n\n254\n00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:40.230\nSo if the original never moves,\n\n255\n00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:45.040\nthe original access control list is\nstill with it and it never changes, see?\n\n256\n00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.900\nSo now you understand what's\ngoing on in the background so\n\n257\n00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:50.130\nthat it will help you\nremember which one does what.\n\n258\n00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:53.450\nMoving it within the same volume,\nit retains permissions.\n\n259\n00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:55.232\nAnything else it inherits new permissions.\n\n260\n00:13:55.232 --> 00:13:58.739\n&gt;&gt; So if you moved it out of that volume\ninto a brand new volume you need to of\n\n261\n00:13:58.739 --> 00:14:02.425\ncourse pay attention to the permissions\nthat you need to assign to it now at\n\n262\n00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:03.340\nthis point.\n\n263\n00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:05.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, because they're\nnot gonna be what you think they are.\n\n264\n00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:06.100\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n265\n00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:07.380\nCuz it's got new parents.\n\n266\n00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:08.820\nAnd it's going to inherit those.\n\n267\n00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:12.540\nThe other thing that I forgot to put\non here that I do wanna mention too is\n\n268\n00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:14.530\nleaving an NTFS partition.\n\n269\n00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:19.190\nRemember all of these things we're talking\nabout are because of the file system.\n\n270\n00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:24.140\nNTFS is why we have that access\ncontrol list and those permissions.\n\n271\n00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:27.540\nWell if I copy a file to a CD-ROM drive or\n\n272\n00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.440\nto a thumb drive that's\nformatted with exFAT.\n\n273\n00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.640\nOr you copy it over to an Apple system,\nright?\n\n274\n00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.010\nOr a Linux system.\n\n275\n00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:36.650\nThose aren't NTFS.\n\n276\n00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:40.080\nSo the access control list disappears,\nall right?\n\n277\n00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:44.970\nSo when you email a file to somebody,\nthose permissions don't go with that file.\n\n278\n00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:49.380\nThere are some technologies that would\nallow that but not normal behavior, right?\n\n279\n00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:54.250\nSo as soon as you take that file and leave\nNTFS with it, copy it to a thumb drive,\n\n280\n00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:57.320\nto your phone, email it to somebody,\nburn it to a disk,\n\n281\n00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.300\nwhat have you,\nall those permissions are gone.\n\n282\n00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.630\nSo something else to keep in mind.\n\n283\n00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:07.760\nBut that's also why if you don't\nhave read permission over a file,\n\n284\n00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.960\nyou cannot copy it to a thumb drive,\nfor example.\n\n285\n00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.440\nBecause that'd be a real easy cheat,\nwouldn't it?\n\n286\n00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.610\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; They told me I can't read this file,\n\n287\n00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:16.240\nwatch me.\n\n288\n00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.330\nAnd I copy it to a thumb drive\nwhich is formatted with exFAT.\n\n289\n00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.674\nAll the permissions go away, and\nall of the sudden I can read the file.\n\n290\n00:15:21.674 --> 00:15:24.880\nThat would be too easy, and\nwe would all be hackers by now.\n\n291\n00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:30.760\nSo if you don't have read, you can't\nmove that file to an non-NTFS partition.\n\n292\n00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:31.930\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n293\n00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:32.596\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n294\n00:15:32.596 --> 00:15:36.604\nnow we've covered permissions as\nfar NTFS permissions extensively.\n\n295\n00:15:36.604 --> 00:15:39.860\nI think we've talked about everything\nwe need to know for this exam.\n\n296\n00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:43.460\nThere's another set of permissions\nhowever that we need to be familiar with\n\n297\n00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:47.360\nas we prepare for this exam and\nfor what we do as a living.\n\n298\n00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.402\nAnd that is share permissions, right?\n\n299\n00:15:50.402 --> 00:15:54.726\nNTFS permissions are part of the file\nsystem, and when you put a file or\n\n300\n00:15:54.726 --> 00:15:58.117\nmake a file or\na folder it gets those NTFS permissions.\n\n301\n00:15:58.117 --> 00:16:00.032\nAnd those are always in effect.\n\n302\n00:16:00.032 --> 00:16:03.676\nEvery time anybody double-clicks\non a file or folder,\n\n303\n00:16:03.676 --> 00:16:06.780\nNTFS permissions are always checked.\n\n304\n00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:10.300\nWindows does not wanna give the wrong\nperson access to a resource, so\n\n305\n00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.730\nit's always gonna check this.\n\n306\n00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:14.550\n&gt;&gt; And Mike, there's a difference\nbetween accessing them locally\n\n307\n00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:15.880\nas opposed over our network.\n\n308\n00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.520\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, Zach,\nthat is a great question.\n\n309\n00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:23.330\nNow what if I've got a file on my\ncomputer rhat I want Zach to be able to\n\n310\n00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:24.890\naccess, right?\n\n311\n00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:28.030\nWell, he could come and\ntry to log into my machine, but\n\n312\n00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:31.750\nyou don't go down to your buddy's office\nand say, hey let me sit there and\n\n313\n00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:33.720\naccess your files for a second, right?\n\n314\n00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.410\nWhen you talk to the servers at your work,\nright,\n\n315\n00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:41.770\nmaybe they've told you to store your\ndocuments up on file server two, or\n\n316\n00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:45.210\nthat's where all the forms\nare that you need.\n\n317\n00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:48.190\nYou're going across the network\nto get to the resource,\n\n318\n00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:51.979\nwhether you're reaching out and\ntouching your coworker's laptop, or\n\n319\n00:16:51.979 --> 00:16:56.467\nwhether you're reaching out and touching\nthat file server up there on your network.\n\n320\n00:16:56.467 --> 00:17:00.731\nNow you're going across the network\nto get to the resource,\n\n321\n00:17:00.731 --> 00:17:05.412\nand in order for me to make that\nresource available on the network,\n\n322\n00:17:05.412 --> 00:17:09.010\nnot just locally, I have to share it out.\n\n323\n00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:11.690\nSharing, is simply the process of\n\n324\n00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:15.070\nmaking the resource available\nto everybody else, right?\n\n325\n00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:17.705\nSharing, and we learned to share\nback in the kindergarten, right?\n\n326\n00:17:17.705 --> 00:17:20.900\nThat's what sharing is all about, I want\npeople to come across the network and\n\n327\n00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:21.530\nget to the resource.\n\n328\n00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:26.240\nSo easy enough, we can go in our Windows\nand we can share resource out, and\n\n329\n00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.640\nI'll show you how to do it.\n\n330\n00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:32.161\nBut when you share it, another set\nof permissions comes into play,\n\n331\n00:17:32.161 --> 00:17:33.602\nshare permissions.\n\n332\n00:17:33.602 --> 00:17:37.830\nSo now all of a sudden we're gonna have\ntwo sets of permissions to worry about.\n\n333\n00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:41.890\nNTFS permissions are always checked\nno matter whether you're accessing it\n\n334\n00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:45.710\nlocally, or whether you're going\nacross the network to get to it.\n\n335\n00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:50.494\nShare permissions are only checked if\nyou go across the network to get to it,\n\n336\n00:17:50.494 --> 00:17:55.800\nbecause if you go across the network,\nyou're accessing a shared resource.\n\n337\n00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.710\nSo now I've got to check NTFS,\ncuz it's always checked, and I've\n\n338\n00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:01.570\ngotta check share permissions, because\nyou're accessing a shared resource.\n\n339\n00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:03.230\n&gt;&gt; Mike, what happens when you mix them?\n\n340\n00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:06.150\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question Zach,\nand what's gonna happen when\n\n341\n00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:11.110\nI mix those permissions, is it's going\nto be the most restrictive of the two.\n\n342\n00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:13.195\nNow think about that for a second or\nmake sure that sinks in,\n\n343\n00:18:13.195 --> 00:18:17.800\ncuz when we talked about just NTFS\npermissions, we said it was cumulative.\n\n344\n00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.790\nYou get to add them all up.\n\n345\n00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:24.830\nBut when you combine share permissions and\nNTFS permissions, they don't mix well.\n\n346\n00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:29.160\nSo what it does is it says I'm gonna give\nyou the most restrictive of the two.\n\n347\n00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:34.170\nAs an example, let's say you had full\ncontrol read permission I'm sorry,\n\n348\n00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:39.430\nyou had full control NTFS permission,\nbut you had read share permission.\n\n349\n00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:43.300\nWell okay, I gotta combine these two.\n\n350\n00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:45.860\nWhich one's more restrictive,\nfull control or just read?\n\n351\n00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.610\nRead is a lot more restrictive\nthan full control.\n\n352\n00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:55.230\nSo Windows as you say all you get is\nread if you go across the network.\n\n353\n00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:58.240\nThere's the catch, right?\n\n354\n00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.430\nSo imagine a resource on\nmy laptop right here.\n\n355\n00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:07.440\nAnd I gave Zach full control NTFS and\nshare read.\n\n356\n00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:12.330\nWell if from his laptop,\nhe goes across the network to get to that,\n\n357\n00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:16.930\nhe's gonna only have read permission, cuz\nread is more restrictive at full control.\n\n358\n00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:22.270\nWell what if he walks over to my computer,\nlogs in, and accesses the same resource?\n\n359\n00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:23.710\nNow what permissions does he have?\n\n360\n00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:24.370\nDoes it change?\n\n361\n00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:29.620\nIt does, because he's no longer going\nacross the network to get to it.\n\n362\n00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:31.830\nSo shared permissions\nare not even looked at.\n\n363\n00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:35.660\nIt's only gonna look at NTFS permissions,\nand he's gonna have full control.\n\n364\n00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.470\nSo that's what I need you to remember.\n\n365\n00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:39.960\nNTFS permissions always checked.\n\n366\n00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.860\nShare permissions only checked\nif you go across the network.\n\n367\n00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:46.520\nNot checked if you access it locally.\n\n368\n00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:52.175\nAnd when you mix the two, it's the most\nrestrictive of the two, all right?\n\n369\n00:19:52.175 --> 00:19:56.710\nNow let's take a look at creating a share,\nand I don't know that this is actually\n\n370\n00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:59.320\ngonna be called out of the exam,\nbut permissions will.\n\n371\n00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.690\nCreating shares, I don't think so,\nbut you'll see it as I do it here.\n\n372\n00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:06.460\nI'm gonna share out a folder, in fact, I'm\ngonna share that same folder that we've\n\n373\n00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:09.830\nbeen working with for\nthe past two episodes here.\n\n374\n00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:14.440\nI'm gonna right-click on MDocs and\nI'm gonna share with specific people.\n\n375\n00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:20.588\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\ngive, let's do everyone, and\n\n376\n00:20:20.588 --> 00:20:24.156\nI'll give everyone that read permission.\n\n377\n00:20:24.156 --> 00:20:27.750\nSo I'll zoom in here, oops,\nI cannot zoom in anymore?\n\n378\n00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:35.790\nMy zoom it broke, I'll have to restart\nthat, but we can still see that, I think.\n\n379\n00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:37.641\nLet me fire it up a real quick,\nlet me find and zoom it.\n\n380\n00:20:40.763 --> 00:20:42.270\nWe'll get that going really quick.\n\n381\n00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:44.010\nZoom, it's a great little\nprogram if you've been trying\n\n382\n00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:48.010\nto figure out what I'm using, that's made\nby Microsoft and it allow you to zoom in.\n\n383\n00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.180\nIt's fantastic.\n\n384\n00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.786\n&gt;&gt; It's also an old TV show,you're\ngonna zoom, zoom, zooma, zoom-\n\n385\n00:20:51.786 --> 00:20:52.576\n&gt;&gt; Zoom, zoom, zoom.\n\n386\n00:20:52.576 --> 00:20:53.275\nWe had whatever.\n\n387\n00:20:53.275 --> 00:20:55.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so there we go.\n\n388\n00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.800\nYou can see I gave\neveryone read permission.\n\n389\n00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.100\nNow shared permissions are a little\ndifferent from NTFS permissions\n\n390\n00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:03.440\nin the fact that there's not as many,\nall right?\n\n391\n00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:09.100\nDepending on what dialog box you use,\nyou could see full control, change, read.\n\n392\n00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:13.750\nHere I see read, and read write,\nwell read write, and\n\n393\n00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:17.010\nchange are kind of the same thing\nwhen it comes to share permissions.\n\n394\n00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:20.910\nSo there's not nearly as many permissions\nwhen we're dealing with share NTFS has\n\n395\n00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:22.940\na lot more permissions associated.\n\n396\n00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:24.850\nShare it's just hey can you read it,\n\n397\n00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:27.760\ncan you make changes to it\nwhich would include read.\n\n398\n00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.950\nOr do you have full control which\nmeans you can do whatever you want to\n\n399\n00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:32.390\nthe resource all right?\n\n400\n00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:38.240\nI'm gonna give everyone read and\nI'll go ahead and click share, all right.\n\n401\n00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:41.190\nAnd because I'm not logged\non as administrator,\n\n402\n00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:46.180\nI need to give administrative\npermissions to create this share.\n\n403\n00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.560\nAll right, so I've made that share.\n\n404\n00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:50.500\nI'll go ahead and I'm not gonna change\nany settings, I like everything we did.\n\n405\n00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:51.670\nI'll click done.\n\n406\n00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:54.780\nSo now this resource is shared, all right?\n\n407\n00:21:54.780 --> 00:22:00.330\nAnd so if I go to another machine, I'm\ngonna go over to this domain controller,\n\n408\n00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:03.280\nand I'm gonna try to connect\nto that shared folder.\n\n409\n00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.280\nNow that's our next thing\nwe need to talk about,\n\n410\n00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.520\nhow do I connect to shared resources?\n\n411\n00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:13.410\nYou're gonna be using what's known as\na UNC path Universal naming convention.\n\n412\n00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:16.980\nAnd that follows the format backslash,\nbackslash,\n\n413\n00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:21.970\nname of the computer that's shares on,\nbackslash name of the share itself.\n\n414\n00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:25.300\nSo in my case, like if I open\nup file explorer, I can type\n\n415\n00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:29.410\nin that machine that I made the share on,\nthe Windows 10 box, it's named client 01.\n\n416\n00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:32.817\nSo backslash, backslash Client 01/,\n\n417\n00:22:32.817 --> 00:22:37.169\nthe name of the folder I\nshared was called empdocs, and\n\n418\n00:22:37.169 --> 00:22:43.707\nyou can actually see it populating my list\nalready, then hit OK, and there we go.\n\n419\n00:22:43.707 --> 00:22:45.340\n&gt;&gt; And this is your UNC path.\n\n420\n00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.380\n&gt;&gt; This is the UNC path, exactly.\n\n421\n00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:53.620\nBackslash, backslash,\ncomputer name \\ShareName, right?\n\n422\n00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:57.690\nSo I'm in this mdox folder, and\nI can see these other folders.\n\n423\n00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:01.420\nI can open these guys up, but\nI'm going across the network.\n\n424\n00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:06.060\nSo remember, Mike has full control,\nlet's see if I can make changes to this,\n\n425\n00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:10.120\nFile, Save, and it does allow me.\n\n426\n00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:14.800\nBecause I am actually logged on as\nadministrator right now, all right?\n\n427\n00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:19.671\nSo, let's do this, let me,\nlet's log off of this domain controller.\n\n428\n00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:24.180\nYou know what?\n\n429\n00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:28.844\nMike's not going to be able to log on to\nthe let me make a couple changes real\n\n430\n00:23:28.844 --> 00:23:31.415\nquick, so I can do this demonstration.\n\n431\n00:23:31.415 --> 00:23:35.378\nWe're gonna switch it around I'm gonna\nmake a share on my domain controller.\n\n432\n00:23:35.378 --> 00:23:40.784\nAll right, so I'm gonna open up same\nthing I'm gonna go to file explorer go to\n\n433\n00:23:40.784 --> 00:23:46.204\nthe c drive, I'm gonna make a new folder,\nand I'm gonna call it share test.\n\n434\n00:23:46.204 --> 00:23:50.381\nIf I can type, and\nI'll even make a file insider there, so\n\n435\n00:23:50.381 --> 00:23:54.916\nI have something to play with new file and\nI'll call it handbook\n\n436\n00:23:57.681 --> 00:24:00.247\nAll right, now, I'm gonna share this out.\n\n437\n00:24:00.247 --> 00:24:05.160\nRight click and share with,\nspecific people, and\n\n438\n00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:09.900\nI'll add the everyone group, which Mike\nis a part of everyone, so I'll click Add.\n\n439\n00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.610\nAnd I'll give everyone Read.\n\n440\n00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:14.691\nAnd I'll click Share.\n\n441\n00:24:17.539 --> 00:24:19.260\nAll right, and then I'll click done.\n\n442\n00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:25.878\nAnd so, now,\nif I go back over to client one.\n\n443\n00:24:25.878 --> 00:24:27.835\nLet's see if I can\nconnect to that machine.\n\n444\n00:24:27.835 --> 00:24:36.190\nI'll do \\\\name of the machine\nDC01 \\share test.\n\n445\n00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:40.040\nAgain, that's that UNC path and\nsure enough, I'm able to connect to it.\n\n446\n00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:43.110\nAll right, if I double click on it,\nI can open it up, if I type and\n\n447\n00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:46.950\nI try to save it, I can't save it.\n\n448\n00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:50.860\nIt's telling me I can't, if I try to\nclick save, it says, it already exists,\n\n449\n00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:51.500\ndo you want to replace it?\n\n450\n00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:52.700\nI say, yes.\n\n451\n00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:56.360\nAnd it says, access is denied.\n\n452\n00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:02.160\nAnd that's, because I only gave\nShare Read Permission, over that.\n\n453\n00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.800\nSo, let's go back over there and\nsee if we can change that up.\n\n454\n00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:08.340\nI'm gonna disconnect from that share,\nand I'll go back over to DC1, and, now,\n\n455\n00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:13.430\nI'm gonna say, all right, Mike, if you\nneed to be able to make changes to that\n\n456\n00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:19.350\nI'll go back into my sharing permissions,\nand I'll click Permissions.\n\n457\n00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:22.136\nLet me zoom in, so\nyou can see what I'm doing here.\n\n458\n00:25:22.136 --> 00:25:23.764\nI don't have zoom on this machine.\n\n459\n00:25:23.764 --> 00:25:27.830\nI'm gonna click the Permissions button,\nand I'm gonna go to that everyone group.\n\n460\n00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:30.830\nAnd I can see that everyone\nactually has full control.\n\n461\n00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:37.090\nSo, if everyone has full control,\nhow come Mike couldn't write to that file?\n\n462\n00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:42.780\nRemember, it's the most restrictive of\nthe two, so I have share full control.\n\n463\n00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.450\nOkay, great let's go look\nat the NTFS permission.\n\n464\n00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:50.230\nSecurity, everyone only has read.\n\n465\n00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:54.730\nSo, which one's more restrictive?, in this\ncase, read is more restrictive than full\n\n466\n00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:58.190\ncontrol, so\nit's only giving me read permission.\n\n467\n00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:03.150\nSo, that's what I was trying to show you\nthere that it doesn't matter which one.\n\n468\n00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:08.610\nIt's not that share always takes\nprecedence over NTFS, or NTFS always\n\n469\n00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:13.420\ntakes precedence over share, it's which\neveryone is the most restricted, right?\n\n470\n00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:17.380\nNow, I’ll tell you with Microsoft,\nthey'll actually recommend\n\n471\n00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:21.700\nthat you give everyone full control\nwhen it comes to share permissions.\n\n472\n00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:23.700\nAnd that's kind of scary at first.\n\n473\n00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:26.910\nI mean, I have always learned\nthat you'd never want to give\n\n474\n00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:28.240\nfull control to everyone.\n\n475\n00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:32.510\nYou wanna limit what people can do, but\nhere's what Microsoft is gonna tell you.\n\n476\n00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:37.500\nNTFS permissions are always checked,\nright?\n\n477\n00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:42.330\nIf I follow principle of least\nprivileged with NTFS permissions, and\n\n478\n00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:45.410\nI follow principle of least\nprivileged with share permissions.\n\n479\n00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:46.690\nNow, when I go to troubleshoot,\n\n480\n00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:51.500\nwhen Zach calls me up and says,\nI cannot write to that file on that share.\n\n481\n00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:55.150\nI've got to troubleshoot share permissions\nto make sure he has enough of those.\n\n482\n00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:56.010\nAnd I've got to troubleshoot\n\n483\n00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:58.590\nNTFS permissions to make sure he has\nthe appropriate permissions there.\n\n484\n00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:05.340\nIf I choose to give everyone full control\nshare, I never have to troubleshoot them.\n\n485\n00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:09.340\nIt can't be the share permissions keeping\nyou from doing what you're trying to do,\n\n486\n00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:11.490\nbecause everyone has full control.\n\n487\n00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:13.979\nThe only thing left to\ntroubleshoot is NTFS.\n\n488\n00:27:13.979 --> 00:27:16.632\nAnd you're not gonna give\nanybody extra permissions,\n\n489\n00:27:16.632 --> 00:27:19.310\nbecause NTFS permissions\nare always checked.\n\n490\n00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:22.720\nSo, they're not gonna get anything\nthat they didn't all ready have.\n\n491\n00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.440\nSo, that make sense?\n\n492\n00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:24.450\n&gt;&gt; It makes perfect sense.\n\n493\n00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:28.390\n&gt;&gt; So, giving somebody full control\nshare permissions is actually not\n\n494\n00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:30.830\na security issue.\n\n495\n00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:32.500\nIt's actually gonna be beneficial,\n\n496\n00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.880\nbecause we can now jump right\nto what we need to troubleshoot.\n\n497\n00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.530\nWe can eliminate share permissions, right?\n\n498\n00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:40.570\nI will tell you one of my,\nI've always said this and, I don't know,\n\n499\n00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:43.180\nif it'll ever happen,\nbut honestly Microsoft.\n\n500\n00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:44.720\nWhy even have shared information, right?\n\n501\n00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:47.116\nIf I click share, she has to be\nautomatically on full control.\n\n502\n00:27:47.116 --> 00:27:50.500\nI'm teasing it, there are situations\nwhen I might want a little more\n\n503\n00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:53.610\ncontrol than that, but\nit does kinda come down to that.\n\n504\n00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:55.993\nSo, in the end,\nthat's what I want you, guys,\n\n505\n00:27:55.993 --> 00:28:00.318\nto take out of these demonstrations here,\nshared information are separate from NTFS.\n\n506\n00:28:00.318 --> 00:28:03.055\nShare permissions are what\nallow me to reach out and\n\n507\n00:28:03.055 --> 00:28:05.460\naccess resources on the network.\n\n508\n00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:09.294\nWe access those resources through\nwhat's called a UNC path, or\n\n509\n00:28:09.294 --> 00:28:11.429\nthe universal naming convention.\n\n510\n00:28:11.429 --> 00:28:15.280\nWhich is \\\\computer name\\share name.\n\n511\n00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:18.090\nWhen you reach across the network,\nshare permissions, and\n\n512\n00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:19.910\nNTFS permissions are checked.\n\n513\n00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:23.170\nWhen we combine them,\nit's the most restrictive of the two.\n\n514\n00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:24.100\nYou need both.\n\n515\n00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:27.313\nIf you have share permission, but\nyou don't have NTFS permissions,\n\n516\n00:28:27.313 --> 00:28:29.387\nyou're not getting access to the resource.\n\n517\n00:28:29.387 --> 00:28:32.930\nBecause NTFS permissions\nare always going to be checked.\n\n518\n00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.200\nI know, we are getting short on time, but\n\n519\n00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.890\nI've got a couple more things that I want\nto make sure we fit into this episode.\n\n520\n00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:40.901\n&gt;&gt; I know you can do it.\n\n521\n00:28:40.901 --> 00:28:42.807\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] Did you get all that?\n\n522\n00:28:42.807 --> 00:28:43.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I got it.\n\n523\n00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:47.023\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, we talked about shares,\nwe talked about the UNC path,\n\n524\n00:28:47.023 --> 00:28:51.747\nI want to show you something else, because\nthere are other ways I can access a shared\n\n525\n00:28:51.747 --> 00:28:57.270\nresource, UNC path \\\\computer name\\share\nname, we can also map a network drive.\n\n526\n00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:59.810\nRight?\nBecause every time I wanna connect to that\n\n527\n00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:03.080\nfolder back there on DC1,\nI've got to come up here and type.\n\n528\n00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:07.580\nI lost track of which machine I'm on now.\n\n529\n00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:11.320\nLet's go back over to client1, cuz,\nI know, I've got zoom on that one.\n\n530\n00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.779\nEvery time I wanna reach out and\n\n531\n00:29:13.779 --> 00:29:18.981\ntalk to that folder that's over\nthere on the domain controller,\n\n532\n00:29:18.981 --> 00:29:23.115\nI've gotta go \\\\ DC01\\sharetest-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n533\n00:29:23.115 --> 00:29:24.459\n&gt;&gt; And type all that in.\n\n534\n00:29:24.459 --> 00:29:25.360\nAnd that's just one.\n\n535\n00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:29.927\nAt your work, you probably have several\nshares that you need to access to.\n\n536\n00:29:29.927 --> 00:29:35.755\nSo, you're gonna be like, wait,\nwas that list on \\\\server14\\empdocs?\n\n537\n00:29:35.755 --> 00:29:41.770\nOr was it on \\\\server22\\employeefiles?\n\n538\n00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:43.280\nI can't remember all of that.\n\n539\n00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:47.852\nMapping a network drive is simply a way\nof taking a UNC path, and assigning\n\n540\n00:29:47.852 --> 00:29:52.445\na letter to it, so that it shows up\njust like your C drive, or your D Drive.\n\n541\n00:29:52.445 --> 00:29:53.921\nNo more path to remember, and\n\n542\n00:29:53.921 --> 00:29:57.220\nit's always gonna be there\nwhen I open up File Explorer.\n\n543\n00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:58.950\nSo, let's see how I can do that, right?\n\n544\n00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:01.010\nI've connected to this share, and,\n\n545\n00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:04.430\nnow, I wanna go over here to my,\nlet's see if I can remember where it is.\n\n546\n00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:06.930\nDid I not take it over here?\n\n547\n00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:09.458\nWhere did you go?\n\n548\n00:30:09.458 --> 00:30:10.680\nBecause I'm not clicked on there.\n\n549\n00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:11.810\nLet's go back.\n\n550\n00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:13.380\nI'm gonna right click on the share.\n\n551\n00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:15.700\nThere's a couple of ways\nyou can actually do this.\n\n552\n00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:21.570\nIf you navigate to the server itself, and\nI find the share, I can right click on it.\n\n553\n00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:23.880\nAnd I can choose map network drive.\n\n554\n00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:24.930\nOr what I can do is,\n\n555\n00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:30.800\nI can just right click on this PC,\nand let me zoom in for you there.\n\n556\n00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:34.610\nI can right click on this PC, or my\ncomputer if you're using an older version\n\n557\n00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:36.930\nof Windows, and\nI can choose map network drive.\n\n558\n00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:40.290\nAll right, and let me zoom back out.\n\n559\n00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:44.100\nSo, in this dialogue box, first thing\nI do is I get to pick the letter.\n\n560\n00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:45.770\nI'll pick the letter M for Mike.\n\n561\n00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:47.010\nI like that.\n\n562\n00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:50.542\nAnd then for the folder, this is\nwhat I'm gonna type in the UNC path,\n\n563\n00:30:50.542 --> 00:30:57.360\n\\\\ DC01\\share test,\nif I remember it correctly.\n\n564\n00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:01.150\nThen I've got the option to reconnect it,\nsign it.\n\n565\n00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:05.700\nThis means, every time I log back in,\nit'll automatically map this drive, and\n\n566\n00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:07.920\nI don't have to go through\nthis process every time.\n\n567\n00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.410\nYou could also use different credentials,\nif you had a different username and\n\n568\n00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:14.660\npassword to connect to\nthat particular share.\n\n569\n00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:18.400\nI'll click Finish, and I'll zoom back out.\n\n570\n00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:21.330\nAnd I'm just gonna close File Explorer for\na second.\n\n571\n00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:22.120\nOpen it back up.\n\n572\n00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:27.726\nAnd if I look over here, now,\nat this PC, I have a Mac drive.\n\n573\n00:31:27.726 --> 00:31:28.382\nLook at it right there.\n\n574\n00:31:28.382 --> 00:31:30.985\nShare test//DCL1.\n\n575\n00:31:30.985 --> 00:31:32.285\nI double click on it.\n\n576\n00:31:32.285 --> 00:31:34.177\nAnd I'm in, like, flint.\n\n577\n00:31:34.177 --> 00:31:36.605\nSo, I don't have to remember that\nstuff anymore, I can just map it.\n\n578\n00:31:36.605 --> 00:31:39.455\nAnd you can map as many drives\nas you have drive letters.\n\n579\n00:31:39.455 --> 00:31:42.996\nSo, you run out at about 26,\nkeeping in mind C is already used.\n\n580\n00:31:42.996 --> 00:31:45.877\nTypically D is your CDROM drive,\nif you still have one of those.\n\n581\n00:31:45.877 --> 00:31:48.844\nSo, maybe 23, 24, but\nif you have to map 24 drives.\n\n582\n00:31:48.844 --> 00:31:50.215\nI feel for you.\n\n583\n00:31:50.215 --> 00:31:52.915\n[LAUGH] Talk to your admins\nabout combining some of those.\n\n584\n00:31:52.915 --> 00:31:55.627\n&gt;&gt; So Mike, as we're nearing\nthe end of permissions part three,\n\n585\n00:31:55.627 --> 00:31:57.550\nanything else you wanna add about shares?\n\n586\n00:31:57.550 --> 00:32:00.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Zach, one more thing in order\nto complete our discussion on share\n\n587\n00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:06.045\npermission, and that would be\nadministrative shares, aka, hidden shares.\n\n588\n00:32:06.045 --> 00:32:08.515\nThese are shares that Windows creates for\n\n589\n00:32:08.515 --> 00:32:12.265\nus by default when we install the\noperating system, and they're fantastic.\n\n590\n00:32:12.265 --> 00:32:14.530\nI've used them on several occasions.\n\n591\n00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:18.592\nThey have really saved me from a lot of\nextra work, so let me tell you about them.\n\n592\n00:32:18.592 --> 00:32:21.472\nFirst of all,\nthey're called administrative shares,\n\n593\n00:32:21.472 --> 00:32:23.572\nbut they're also called hidden shares.\n\n594\n00:32:23.572 --> 00:32:28.202\nAnd that's because they don't\nshow up in a normal browse list.\n\n595\n00:32:28.202 --> 00:32:30.954\nNormally, when you're\ntyping in a UNC path or\n\n596\n00:32:30.954 --> 00:32:35.542\nyou're using File Explorer to browse and\nyou click on the name of a computer or\n\n597\n00:32:35.542 --> 00:32:39.655\na server, it'll show you all\nthe shares that exist on that machine.\n\n598\n00:32:39.655 --> 00:32:42.953\nCuz it's saying hey, you wanna look on\nthe network to see what's out there,\n\n599\n00:32:42.953 --> 00:32:43.680\nI'll show you.\n\n600\n00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:45.765\nIt's what's called a master browser list,\n\n601\n00:32:45.765 --> 00:32:49.340\nit's a service that runs in the background\nand we don't have to worry about that.\n\n602\n00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:51.680\nBut it shows you all\nthe shares that are available.\n\n603\n00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:54.660\nExcept for the administrative shares,\nit hides those.\n\n604\n00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:57.200\nBecause only administrators\nhave access to them.\n\n605\n00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.480\nAnd it doesn't want\neverybody seeing them and\n\n606\n00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.960\ngoing, how come I don't\nhave access to that?\n\n607\n00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:05.600\nOr trying to get access to that and\nbeing mischievous, right?\n\n608\n00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.770\nSo these are administrative shares.\n\n609\n00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:09.760\nAgain, created by default by Windows.\n\n610\n00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:11.182\nSo let me show you.\n\n611\n00:33:11.182 --> 00:33:14.461\nIf I open up File Explorer here,\nnow I've created another account, and\n\n612\n00:33:14.461 --> 00:33:17.650\nlogged in with that, so I've actually\nchanged accounts on you guys.\n\n613\n00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:20.380\nBut that's okay,\nit really doesn't matter for this demo.\n\n614\n00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:23.146\nWe're now logged on as Zach actually.\n\n615\n00:33:23.146 --> 00:33:27.850\nAnd I'm going to, in my address bar\nup here, and you know what Zach?\n\n616\n00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:32.042\nI did not install ZoomIt on your account,\nso let's get ZoomIt right on, real quick.\n\n617\n00:33:32.042 --> 00:33:33.890\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna zoom zoom, zooma zoom.\n\n618\n00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:35.430\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n619\n00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:39.069\n&gt;&gt; I want the good folks out there\nto see what the heck we're doing.\n\n620\n00:33:39.069 --> 00:33:41.300\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna go up to my address bar.\n\n621\n00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:46.197\nAnd I'm gonna type in a UNC path,\nwhich remember, it follows the format\n\n622\n00:33:46.197 --> 00:33:50.708\n\\\\ Name of the computer,\nin this case DCO1 \\ name of the share.\n\n623\n00:33:50.708 --> 00:33:53.780\nBut notice as soon as I hit the backslash,\nI get a list.\n\n624\n00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:57.200\nAnd it's saying, hey, these\nare the shares that exist on that machine.\n\n625\n00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.480\nIs one of them the one\nyou're trying to connect to?\n\n626\n00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:02.630\nAnd I could use my down arrow or\nmy mouse, and I could select it and\n\n627\n00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:04.390\nconnect to it, all right?\n\n628\n00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:09.190\nBut there are shares that exist on DCO1\nthat are not showing up on this list.\n\n629\n00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:11.550\nThat's my administrative shares.\n\n630\n00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:14.170\nThere are several that get created.\n\n631\n00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:19.120\nThe root of every volume that\ngets a drive letter assigned to\n\n632\n00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:21.140\nit automatically has\nan administrative share.\n\n633\n00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:25.825\nSo if you have a C:, if there's a D:,\nan E:, or an F: on that machine,\n\n634\n00:34:25.825 --> 00:34:31.250\non DCO1, each one of those automatically\nhas an administrative share.\n\n635\n00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:31.910\nLet's try it.\n\n636\n00:34:31.910 --> 00:34:36.180\nI know there's a C Drive on DCO1,\nso I'm gonna do C and\n\n637\n00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:38.834\nthen I'm gonna out a $ at\nthe end of the name of it.\n\n638\n00:34:38.834 --> 00:34:42.170\nThe $ is what hides it from everybody.\n\n639\n00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:44.180\nAnd makes it administrative share.\n\n640\n00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:46.810\nAgain, I didn't create this one,\nit was created by Windows.\n\n641\n00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:49.880\nBut I'll show you that we can\ncreate our own in just a second.\n\n642\n00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:53.924\nSo let's see, C$ and I like it,\nit's prompting me for credentials.\n\n643\n00:34:53.924 --> 00:34:56.154\nBecause it is an administrative share,\n\n644\n00:34:56.154 --> 00:34:59.270\nI need to be an administrator\non that machine.\n\n645\n00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:00.792\nSo I'll type in administrator.\n\n646\n00:35:03.003 --> 00:35:04.710\nAnd my super secret password.\n\n647\n00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:07.450\nAnd there I go.\nI am now looking at the C Drive\n\n648\n00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:08.980\nof a remote machine.\n\n649\n00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:12.650\nI can't tell you how many times,\nwhen I was teaching back in the day,\n\n650\n00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:16.430\nbefore virtualization, and everybody had\ntheir own computer and had to come in and\n\n651\n00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:18.930\nsit in my classroom and\nI sat up at the podium.\n\n652\n00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:23.720\nIf I had to reach out to student\n14's computer, I didn't have to go,\n\n653\n00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:27.600\nhey, can you share that out so\nI can get access to it and see it?\n\n654\n00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.470\nThere was a default hidden\nshare already created.\n\n655\n00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:32.650\nI could just go to c$ and\nsee everything on his hard drive,\n\n656\n00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:33.710\nincluding his documents.\n\n657\n00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:35.140\nEverything, right?\n\n658\n00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:37.330\nSo these are really, really handy.\n\n659\n00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:39.790\nI need to remotely administer that server,\n\n660\n00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:43.530\nI need to copy a new file\ninto the www root folder.\n\n661\n00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:44.803\nIt's not shared out.\n\n662\n00:35:44.803 --> 00:35:48.441\nI don't wanna have to remote desktop\ninto it, share it out, disconnect,\n\n663\n00:35:48.441 --> 00:35:51.020\nconnect to the share and copy the file.\n\n664\n00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:54.750\nI can just go to C$ cuz I know\nthat's where ww root is, right?\n\n665\n00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:57.100\nSo every drive automatically gets one.\n\n666\n00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:02.410\nThe others that exist by default\nare gonna be admin$, oops.\n\n667\n00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:05.200\nZoom into the right spot there.\n\n668\n00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:08.630\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; Admin$, that's gonna connect you to\n\n669\n00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:13.740\nthe Windows root, wherever Windows\nin installed, typically C:Windows.\n\n670\n00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:14.700\nBut there it is.\n\n671\n00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:17.927\nHave you ever needed to get\ninto the drivers folder or\n\n672\n00:36:17.927 --> 00:36:20.150\nsomething like that on a remote machine?\n\n673\n00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:22.760\nWell, C:Windows is not shared out.\n\n674\n00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:27.429\nYou don't want to share C:Windows, so\nother people could potentially access it,\n\n675\n00:36:27.429 --> 00:36:29.541\nbut Admin$'ll get you right there.\n\n676\n00:36:29.541 --> 00:36:35.845\nAll right, another one that exists\nby default is going to be IPC$.\n\n677\n00:36:35.845 --> 00:36:40.630\nThis is for interprocess communication.\n\n678\n00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:42.490\nYeah, I don't have permission for that.\n\n679\n00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:45.640\nThis is what servers use when\nthey're talking to each other.\n\n680\n00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:47.920\nServices that need to connect\nfrom one machine to another,\n\n681\n00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:50.220\ninterprocess communications.\n\n682\n00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:51.700\nThat's how they can talk to each other.\n\n683\n00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:52.200\nIsn't that cool?\n\n684\n00:36:53.350 --> 00:37:00.040\nSo, admin#, IPC$,\nIf it's a print server, print$.\n\n685\n00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:01.845\nWhoa, there's a really good one.\n\n686\n00:37:01.845 --> 00:37:04.272\nHow many times have you\nhad to go into a queue for\n\n687\n00:37:04.272 --> 00:37:07.670\na printer and\ntry to clear out some stuck document?\n\n688\n00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:10.246\nWell, now you know from any\nmachine on your network,\n\n689\n00:37:10.246 --> 00:37:14.024\nas long as you're an administrator on\nthat print server you can go backslash,\n\n690\n00:37:14.024 --> 00:37:17.474\nbackslash, name of the computer,\nbackslash, print, dollar sign.\n\n691\n00:37:17.474 --> 00:37:19.420\nAnd it'll get you right\ninto the print queue.\n\n692\n00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:20.110\nPretty cool, right?\n\n693\n00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:20.890\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n694\n00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:24.730\n&gt;&gt; You can also create your\nown hidden shares, all right?\n\n695\n00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:29.070\nWhen you go to create a shared folder,\nit asks you for the share name.\n\n696\n00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:31.220\nNormally, we just use the name\nof the folder, right?\n\n697\n00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:34.960\nLet's do an example of this real quick,\nand I promise I will stop talking.\n\n698\n00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.770\nI'm gonna right click New Folder.\n\n699\n00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:40.110\nAnd I'm just gonna call it share.\n\n700\n00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:42.460\nIt's not shared out yet,\nI just named it share.\n\n701\n00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:45.640\nTo share it, right-click and\nI'm gonna go to Properties.\n\n702\n00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.000\nI'm gonna do the Advanced Sharing.\n\n703\n00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.010\nSo I'm gonna go to the Sharing tab and\nI'm gonna click Advanced Sharing.\n\n704\n00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:56.749\nWhen you do advanced sharing, and let me\ntype in credentials so that I can do this.\n\n705\n00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:02.470\nI can say share the folder and\nnotice the share name.\n\n706\n00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:04.280\nBy default,\nit takes the name of the folder.\n\n707\n00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:08.021\nSo the folder's named share,\nso is the share itself.\n\n708\n00:38:08.021 --> 00:38:13.458\nBut if I add a dollar sign to the end\nof that name and I click OK and\n\n709\n00:38:13.458 --> 00:38:20.900\nthen I zoom out and I click OK, I just\ncreated my own hidden share, all right?\n\n710\n00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:26.450\nIf I go back over to DCO 1,\nI open up File Explorer, and\n\n711\n00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:31.670\nI go //client01,\n\n712\n00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:36.150\nnotice that that share doesn't show up.\n\n713\n00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:41.685\nBut what if I put, /share$?\n\n714\n00:38:41.685 --> 00:38:43.740\nAnd I connect, no problem, right?\n\n715\n00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:49.100\nSo you can create your own hidden shares.\n\n716\n00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:53.260\nIf you have shares hidden, you just have\nto know the exact name to type it in.\n\n717\n00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.790\nNow keep this in mind.\n\n718\n00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:59.670\nThese hidden shares don't do anything for\nsecurity.\n\n719\n00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:02.640\nThose administrative shares,\nthe built-in ones, Admin$,\n\n720\n00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:07.020\nPrint$, we have to be an administrator\nto connect to those folders.\n\n721\n00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:12.450\nBut if I create my own hidden share,\nit doesn't really secure it.\n\n722\n00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:16.450\nWhat it's doing is making sure\nthat other people can't see it.\n\n723\n00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:19.417\nBut if they know the name,\nthey can type it in.\n\n724\n00:39:19.417 --> 00:39:22.010\nAnd if they have permissions,\nthey can still connect to it.\n\n725\n00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:25.180\nSo don't think it's a way to completely\nhide a folder from everybody on\n\n726\n00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:27.340\nthe network, and it's super secure.\n\n727\n00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:30.940\nBut most people don't know\nthe name of the share you created.\n\n728\n00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:32.260\nThey don't even know it's there.\n\n729\n00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:35.790\nAnd it's not gonna show up on their list,\nand tempt them to click on it.\n\n730\n00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:38.930\nSo it's kind of security\nthrough obscurity.\n\n731\n00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:40.850\nDoesn't guarantee security.\n\n732\n00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:44.089\nBut it does give you a little\nbit of a secure feeling.\n\n733\n00:39:44.089 --> 00:39:45.905\nAnd as a help desk person,\n\n734\n00:39:45.905 --> 00:39:50.873\nI used to have a folder of all the tools\nthat I needed that was shared out.\n\n735\n00:39:50.873 --> 00:39:53.561\nSo that when I was out running\naround to people's desks,\n\n736\n00:39:53.561 --> 00:39:55.200\nI could get to those tools.\n\n737\n00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:59.250\nBut I didn't want Joe User\nopening up File Explorer and\n\n738\n00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:02.200\nstumbling across this folder\nwith all these tools.\n\n739\n00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:06.380\nBecause those tools could be used for\nmalicious purposes if you weren't careful.\n\n740\n00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:07.580\nSo I hid the share.\n\n741\n00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:10.470\nThat way I could get to it\nfrom wherever I was at, but\n\n742\n00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:12.960\nnobody stumbled across it and\nfound it accidentally.\n\n743\n00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:15.850\nSo, shares, administrative shares, aka,\n\n744\n00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:18.900\nhidden shares,\ncan be a very powerful feature.\n\n745\n00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:22.772\n&gt;&gt; Awesome information, and this is\nthe conclusion of Permissions Part 3.\n\n746\n00:40:22.772 --> 00:40:25.020\nThere is a Part 1 and Part 2, of course.\n\n747\n00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:27.490\nAnd you're gonna wanna\nrewatch all of them.\n\n748\n00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:30.972\nAnd you can, because you have access\nto the library cuz you're very smart.\n\n749\n00:40:30.972 --> 00:40:32.740\nMike, you did a great job,\nthank you so very much.\n\n750\n00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:34.703\nThis is MTA Security Fundamentals.\n\n751\n00:40:34.703 --> 00:40:37.502\nThanks for watching that,\nand this is ITPro.TV.\n\n752\n00:40:37.502 --> 00:40:41.450\nAnd you know at ITPro.TV,\nwe say an IT Pro is always learning.\n\n753\n00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:42.710\nAnd that's the way it should be.\n\n754\n00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:43.630\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n755\n00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:44.510\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n756\n00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:46.757\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you next time.\n\n757\n00:40:46.757 --> 00:40:53.540\n[MUSIC]\n\n758\n00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:56.581\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

San Francisco,\n\n3\n00:00:04.775 --> 00:00:05.800\nCalifornia [CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.339\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:12.360\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.195\n&gt;&gt; Hello again and\nthank you for watching ITProTV,\n\n7\n00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:17.277\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n8\n00:00:17.277 --> 00:00:20.392\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we continue\non with what we've been doing for\n\n9\n00:00:20.392 --> 00:00:21.683\na while here, permissions.\n\n10\n00:00:21.683 --> 00:00:24.232\nBut today we're looking\nat registry permissions\n\n11\n00:00:24.232 --> 00:00:27.230\ninside the MTA Security Fundamentals\nframework.\n\n12\n00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.370\nAnd your expert, because it's not me, is\nMike Rodrick [LAUGH] and he's right there.\n\n13\n00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.700\nHey Mike, how you doing.\n\n14\n00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.250\n&gt;&gt; Doing great Zach,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n15\n00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.163\nAnd yeah, excited, here we are still\ngoing on permissions, right?\n\n16\n00:00:37.163 --> 00:00:40.510\nRemember I said back in the beginning of,\nI think, part one of our permissions\n\n17\n00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.473\nepisode that it is a very important\npart of administering a network.\n\n18\n00:00:43.473 --> 00:00:46.739\nAnd obviously a very important part\nof this exam because we do spend so\n\n19\n00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:47.540\nmuch time on it.\n\n20\n00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.230\nAnd that's what we wanna do,\nright, is pass this exam.\n\n21\n00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.338\nSo we are continuing on and we are going\nto, rather than do a part four,\n\n22\n00:00:53.338 --> 00:00:56.309\nI thought I'd break out some of\nthese in their own little section.\n\n23\n00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.631\nStill doing permissions, but we're\ngonna focus in on the registry today.\n\n24\n00:00:59.631 --> 00:01:01.360\nSo, as Zach said,\nwe're gonna look at registry.\n\n25\n00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.768\nAnd we'll talk about what is,\nkinda talk about how it's organized,\n\n26\n00:01:04.768 --> 00:01:07.792\nwhat we can do with it,\nwhether we should do anything with it.\n\n27\n00:01:07.792 --> 00:01:11.109\nAnd then how we can control\naccess with it as well.\n\n28\n00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:12.688\n&gt;&gt; So here's my formal question to you.\n\n29\n00:01:12.688 --> 00:01:13.392\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh?\n\n30\n00:01:13.392 --> 00:01:15.973\n&gt;&gt; What is a registry permission?\n\n31\n00:01:15.973 --> 00:01:17.452\nA registry permission, well,\n\n32\n00:01:17.452 --> 00:01:20.261\na registry permission is\na permission within the registry.\n\n33\n00:01:20.261 --> 00:01:20.955\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n34\n00:01:20.955 --> 00:01:21.733\n&gt;&gt; Easy enough, right?\n\n35\n00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:23.739\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Time to go, thanks for watching.\n\n36\n00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:26.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, right, that would be\nnice if that was all there is to it.\n\n37\n00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.670\nBut when we talk about the permissions,\nI mean, we're thinking the same things.\n\n38\n00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.820\nPermissions control what level of access\nsomeone or something has over an object.\n\n39\n00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.586\nAnd when we get into the registry,\nit's gonna be the same thing,\n\n40\n00:01:38.586 --> 00:01:40.459\nwe're gonna have objects in the registry.\n\n41\n00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:44.695\nAnd each one of those objects is gonna\nhave one of those good old access control\n\n42\n00:01:44.695 --> 00:01:48.931\nlists associated with it where we can\nput down, we can assign permissions and\n\n43\n00:01:48.931 --> 00:01:52.740\ncontrol or deny, allow or\ndeny access to these registry keys.\n\n44\n00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.590\nSo really what we need to start off with,\nwhat the heck is the registry even, right?\n\n45\n00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.420\nAnd that is going to be,\nthe registry is a database of sorts.\n\n46\n00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.020\nIt's a place where Windows,\nour operating system,\n\n47\n00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.700\nstores all this configuration information,\nright?\n\n48\n00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.105\nWe're talking about hardware\nconfiguration, software configuration,\n\n49\n00:02:13.105 --> 00:02:16.543\nsome of our system security\npolicies are stored in here, so\n\n50\n00:02:16.543 --> 00:02:18.001\nall of that gets stored.\n\n51\n00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:22.345\nAnd when you think about logging onto your\nWindows system, right, you log onto your\n\n52\n00:02:22.345 --> 00:02:26.220\nwork computer or your home computer,\nyour laptop, whatever it is.\n\n53\n00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.060\nAnd let's say you wanna make a change,\nlet's say you change your background,\n\n54\n00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.910\nthe picture that's in you're background.\n\n55\n00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.710\nWell, how does Windows remember that so\n\n56\n00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.050\nthat the next time you log on, that same\npicture's being shown on your background?\n\n57\n00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.120\nIt stores that information\nin the registry.\n\n58\n00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.880\nThere is a entry in the registry for\nyour user account and\n\n59\n00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.790\nwhat background you've chosen.\n\n60\n00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.880\nOr what font size in Notepad or\n\n61\n00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.640\nhow long the screensaver takes before\nit kicks in and locks your screen.\n\n62\n00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.318\nAll of those stuff,\neverything that you can change or\n\n63\n00:02:56.318 --> 00:02:58.290\nconfigure within windows get stored.\n\n64\n00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.960\nWell, I shouldn't say everything but\nthe vast majority of it gets stored\n\n65\n00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.250\nin the registry\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n66\n00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.030\nnormally you don't have to go in and\nmodify that, do you?\n\n67\n00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.920\n&gt;&gt; Correct, we don't modify it directly,\nwe do end up modifying it indirectly.\n\n68\n00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.220\nWhen you go to your setting,\nyou open up the control panel, or\n\n69\n00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.460\nyou go to your display preferences, right?\n\n70\n00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.930\nAnd you go to the background options, and\nyou browse through all your pictures, and\n\n71\n00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.340\nyou're doing this with\nyour mouse in the GUI.\n\n72\n00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.640\nWell, when you make that change and\n\n73\n00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.090\nyou click Save, what it's doing\nis it's writing to the registry.\n\n74\n00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.680\nNow, we could open up\nthe registry ourselves and\n\n75\n00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.450\nfind where that value is stored and\njust change it manually.\n\n76\n00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.690\nI could type the path and the name to\nthe image that I wanted to set for\n\n77\n00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.700\nmy background.\n\n78\n00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.480\nSo technically I could make the change\nin the registry, manually, myself.\n\n79\n00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.190\nBut here's the problem,\n\n80\n00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.550\nhere's why we don't do that,\nbecause there's no safety checks, right?\n\n81\n00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.920\nWhen you go through the GUI, when\nyou're opening up the little wizard and\n\n82\n00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.590\nit's saying here's all\nthe pictures you have,\n\n83\n00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.470\nwhich one do you wanna\nset as your background?\n\n84\n00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.614\nThere's no chance of it\ngetting the wrong path,\n\n85\n00:03:58.614 --> 00:04:00.770\nthere's no chance of it\ngetting the wrong name.\n\n86\n00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.023\nYou don't have to spell anything,\ntype anything, you're clicking on it and\n\n87\n00:04:04.023 --> 00:04:05.520\nyou're clicking Save.\n\n88\n00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.900\nAnd so\nthose are the safety checks that the GUI,\n\n89\n00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.410\nthe graphical user interface, gives me.\n\n90\n00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.890\nTypically I can't make\nchoices that aren't allowed.\n\n91\n00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.175\nIt might say, hey, or\nwhat do you want to set this to?\n\n92\n00:04:15.175 --> 00:04:18.897\nYour options are this, this, and this and\nyou have to pick one of those three.\n\n93\n00:04:18.897 --> 00:04:23.857\nIf I go into the registry and try to do it\nmanually, I could type anything I want.\n\n94\n00:04:23.857 --> 00:04:26.335\nAnd what I end up typing\ncould be completely wrong and\n\n95\n00:04:26.335 --> 00:04:29.050\nin fact it could cause serious\nproblems for my computer.\n\n96\n00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.060\nIt tries to read it and it's looking for\na picture that it's supposed\n\n97\n00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.100\nto put as my background, and\nI mistakenly put my phone number.\n\n98\n00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.200\nWell, now what's Windows gonna do?\n\n99\n00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.800\nIt's probably gonna blue screen, it's\ngonna crash, or it's gonna have a problem.\n\n100\n00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.677\nDepending on what key it is,\nit could cause the system to crash,\n\n101\n00:04:42.677 --> 00:04:45.255\ncould even prevent it from\nbooting up in the first place.\n\n102\n00:04:45.255 --> 00:04:48.280\nAnd now we've gotta go\nan repair the entire thing.\n\n103\n00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.010\nSo when you hear people say\ndon't ever touch your registry,\n\n104\n00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.170\ndon't make changes to it,\nthat's a bad, bad thing.\n\n105\n00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:55.870\nWell, you should turn around and\ntell them,\n\n106\n00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.270\nyou make changes to your registry\nevery time you log onto your computer.\n\n107\n00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.720\nYou're just not doing it manually-\n&gt;&gt; Or directly.\n\n108\n00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, to the actual registry,\n\n109\n00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.130\nyou're using tools that are ending up\nchanging the registry in the background.\n\n110\n00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.480\nSo if you know what you're doing,\nor if you're careful and\n\n111\n00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.895\nyou pay attention to what you're doing,\n\n112\n00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:16.220\nthere's nothing wrong with going into\nthe registry and making changes.\n\n113\n00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.080\nIt's just that we run the risk\nof causing problems, all right?\n\n114\n00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.760\nSo it's not that editing it\nmanually causes problems.\n\n115\n00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.400\nIt's the fact that there's\nno safety checks and\n\n116\n00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.110\nI can make a silly typo that\ncan cause a problem, all right?\n\n117\n00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.510\n&gt;&gt; My question for you, what is Regedit?\n\n118\n00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:31.260\nWhat is that?\n\n119\n00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.332\n&gt;&gt; Regedit or Regedit, depending on how\npeople wanna pronounce that, is the tool\n\n120\n00:05:35.332 --> 00:05:39.187\nthat we would use to make those changes,\nor just to go look at the registry.\n\n121\n00:05:39.187 --> 00:05:42.220\nCuz sometimes we don't need to make\nchanges but maybe we wanna look at it.\n\n122\n00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.920\nMaybe we have a program that we're\ngetting ready to install and\n\n123\n00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.060\nit's gonna make changes to the registry.\n\n124\n00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.622\nAnd before I do that I wanna\nback the registry up so\n\n125\n00:05:50.622 --> 00:05:56.120\nthat if something goes wrong I can restore\na known good copy of the registry.\n\n126\n00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.520\nAll of these things I would\nend up doing with Regedit.\n\n127\n00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.260\n&gt;&gt; I can make changes,\nI can export keys, and\n\n128\n00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:06.090\nI can import keys into that registry,\nall right?\n\n129\n00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.370\nSo let's take a look at the registry and\nthen we'll kinda keep going from there.\n\n130\n00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.230\nWe're gonna pull up my screen.\n\n131\n00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.070\nAnd I've just got a Windows\n10 domain member here.\n\n132\n00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.854\nAnd I'm simply gonna go to my Start\nmenu and type regedit, all one word.\n\n133\n00:06:20.854 --> 00:06:25.116\nAnd you can see there in my\nStart menu that the choice for\n\n134\n00:06:25.116 --> 00:06:29.481\nregedit comes up, oops,\na little ZoomIt issue there.\n\n135\n00:06:29.481 --> 00:06:35.144\nWe'll do that one more time, regedit,\nand I'll hit Enter and there we go.\n\n136\n00:06:35.144 --> 00:06:39.654\nRight, so this is my registry editor,\nthis is the tool Microsoft gives\n\n137\n00:06:39.654 --> 00:06:43.276\nme to manually manipulate or\nat least view the registry.\n\n138\n00:06:43.276 --> 00:06:43.852\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n139\n00:06:43.852 --> 00:06:50.017\n&gt;&gt; Now, as I zoom in over here, you'll see\nthat it's broken down into these sections.\n\n140\n00:06:50.017 --> 00:06:54.625\nAnd each one of these\nhas a specific purpose.\n\n141\n00:06:54.625 --> 00:06:57.100\nAnd if we want to,\nwe can go through these guys.\n\n142\n00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.764\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, and\n\n143\n00:06:58.764 --> 00:07:03.070\nunfortunately I'm gonna have to\nprobably zoom out to click on anything.\n\n144\n00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.170\nMy ZoomIt tool is not, there we go.\n\n145\n00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:09.153\nAll right, so HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT,\nthis key, or this,\n\n146\n00:07:09.153 --> 00:07:14.103\nI wanna use this term, we haven't\nreally defined it yet, hive, right?\n\n147\n00:07:14.103 --> 00:07:15.277\n&gt;&gt; Hive.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so now-\n\n148\n00:07:15.277 --> 00:07:17.058\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna ask you what a hive was.\n\n149\n00:07:17.058 --> 00:07:19.240\n&gt;&gt; I knew you were,\nyou were asking me about that earlier.\n\n150\n00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.740\nAnd that hive, it's just a name for\neach one of these groups here, all right?\n\n151\n00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.790\nSo really there's five hives.\n\n152\n00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:31.470\nThere's HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT and\nhive key or HKEY for short.\n\n153\n00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:36.753\nThere's CLASSES_ROOT, CURRENT_USER,\nLOCAL_MACHINE, USERS, and CURRENT_CONFIG.\n\n154\n00:07:36.753 --> 00:07:38.555\nSo those are my five hives.\n\n155\n00:07:38.555 --> 00:07:42.870\nNow, we talk about this as being\na database, it's not really a database.\n\n156\n00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:47.124\nBecause it's actually different files on\nyour hard drive that are storing these\n\n157\n00:07:47.124 --> 00:07:47.755\nsettings.\n\n158\n00:07:47.755 --> 00:07:53.210\nAnd they might not necessarily all be,\nthere is no file HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.\n\n159\n00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:56.223\nThere might be two or\nthree files that hold all these settings.\n\n160\n00:07:56.223 --> 00:07:59.716\nWhat the registry editor does is go and\nget those files, read them,\n\n161\n00:07:59.716 --> 00:08:02.434\nand then put them in this\nnice organized view for us.\n\n162\n00:08:02.434 --> 00:08:05.805\nSo there's no guarantee that these\nare actually a specific file,\n\n163\n00:08:05.805 --> 00:08:09.544\nis what I'm trying to say, and\nit's really not important for us either.\n\n164\n00:08:09.544 --> 00:08:13.997\nCuz the register editor goes and gets all\nthe files necessary, compiles it up, and\n\n165\n00:08:13.997 --> 00:08:18.020\nputs it in this nice pretty view\nthat allows us to work with it.\n\n166\n00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.570\nSo HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT,\n\n167\n00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:24.960\nthis is one where we store registered\napplications and file type associations.\n\n168\n00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.421\nSo when you double click\non a Word document,\n\n169\n00:08:27.421 --> 00:08:29.759\nhow does my operating system know to use.\n\n170\n00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:31.790\nIf you double click on a .doc file,\n\n171\n00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:36.082\nhow does it know to use Word to open\nthat up and not PowerPoint, or Notepad?\n\n172\n00:08:36.082 --> 00:08:40.719\nBecause there's an entry\nin HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\n\n173\n00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:43.500\nthat tells it what to do.\n\n174\n00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.306\nNow I don't have Word or\nOffice installed on here, but\n\n175\n00:08:46.306 --> 00:08:49.790\nI can probably find you another one,\nlet's find a .txt file here.\n\n176\n00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.765\nSo you see all these are just extensions,\nright?\n\n177\n00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:58.590\n.raw, .rc, .reg, etc., etc.,\n.shtml, somewhere down here\n\n178\n00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:03.460\nI'll actually find .txt,\nand let's go look at it.\n\n179\n00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:09.020\nI've clicked on the .txt in the navigation\ntree, and out here in the details area,\n\n180\n00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.690\nwe can see that there are some\ninteresting little things here.\n\n181\n00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:15.460\nThere's a name, type, and\nthen the actual data.\n\n182\n00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.540\nThese are known as keys and values.\n\n183\n00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:23.440\nEach one of these is a key, and\na key has a name, and a key has a value.\n\n184\n00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.107\nThat's what a registry entry is,\na name and a value, all right?\n\n185\n00:09:27.107 --> 00:09:33.820\nThis is telling me basically what\ntxt is text file, text plain text.\n\n186\n00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:39.130\nIf expand this out, and we go into here,\nlet's see if I can find it.\n\n187\n00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:39.765\nThere we go.\n\n188\n00:09:39.765 --> 00:09:45.795\nIf we look at this right here,\nitem name REG_EXPAND_SZ, SZ is for string.\n\n189\n00:09:45.795 --> 00:09:50.428\nAnd I can see\n@%SystemRoot%system32\\notepad.exe-470,\n\n190\n00:09:50.428 --> 00:09:54.528\nnow, we don't need to know what\nall those little things mean.\n\n191\n00:09:54.528 --> 00:09:59.371\nBut this is how my computer knows\nthat when I click on a .txt file I\n\n192\n00:09:59.371 --> 00:10:04.310\nshould go find notepad.exe and\nuse that to open it up.\n\n193\n00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:10.950\nIf I was to change this, if I changed\nmy default text editor to I don't know,\n\n194\n00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:15.570\nAtom, or some other text editor,\nit would modify the entry in the registry.\n\n195\n00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:20.390\nSo the next time that I double clicked on\na .txt file, Windows would know, don't use\n\n196\n00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:24.320\nNotepad, he doesn't like that, he wants\nto use Atom as his default text editor.\n\n197\n00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.100\nSo when you make those file type\nassociations, like when you install\n\n198\n00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:32.450\nsomething and it says, hey, do you\nwanna make Chrome your default browser?\n\n199\n00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:34.658\nAnd you say yes, well,\nguess what it's actually doing?\n\n200\n00:10:34.658 --> 00:10:37.993\nIt's going into your registry, and\n\n201\n00:10:37.993 --> 00:10:43.493\nit's finding the extension for\nHTML, and I can spell HTML.\n\n202\n00:10:43.493 --> 00:10:44.374\n&gt;&gt; There's an H in it.\n\n203\n00:10:44.374 --> 00:10:47.949\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nmy PersistentHandler open with,\n\n204\n00:10:47.949 --> 00:10:51.540\nlet's see if I can find the actual entry.\n\n205\n00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:55.316\nThis machine has just been installed so\nit doesn't look like I actually have\n\n206\n00:10:55.316 --> 00:10:57.973\na default browser yet, but\nthis is where it would go.\n\n207\n00:10:57.973 --> 00:11:03.030\nThat might be the actual ID for\nEdge, I'm not sure.\n\n208\n00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:06.990\nBut if you made that change, if it asked\nyou that question, and you said yes,\n\n209\n00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:09.880\nI want Chrome to be my default browser.\n\n210\n00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.140\nWell, what Windows is gonna\ndo is come into this key,\n\n211\n00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:15.690\nHTML, remove Internet Explorer,\nand put Chrome in its place.\n\n212\n00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:19.850\nIt's gonna tell the operating system\nthe path to the executable for Chrome.\n\n213\n00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.780\nSo the next time you double\nclick on an HTML link,\n\n214\n00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:25.780\nit's gonna use Chrome\nto open up that link.\n\n215\n00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:29.670\nSo that's what the class' root is for,\nfile type extensions.\n\n216\n00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:33.000\nAnd again, you could come in here and\nmanually change that, right?\n\n217\n00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.166\nI could back down to where it says txt,\nand I could just change that path.\n\n218\n00:11:36.166 --> 00:11:39.796\nIn fact, let me show you what it looks\nlike when you're modifying one of\n\n219\n00:11:39.796 --> 00:11:40.900\nthese guys.\n\n220\n00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:47.940\nWe go back down to .txt, all right,\nand ShellNew, and here we go.\n\n221\n00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:52.050\nSo all I would do is double click on\nthis entry, and say, you know what?\n\n222\n00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:59.380\nInstead of Notepad,\nI want you to use atom.exe.\n\n223\n00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.030\nAnd is that gonna cause a problem?\n\n224\n00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:05.390\nNo, it's gonna work perfectly fine,\nif I spelled atom correctly, right?\n\n225\n00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:08.350\nI could easily make a typo there,\nthere's no safety checks.\n\n226\n00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:11.998\nAtom might not be located in the system32\nfolder, so when it tries to use it,\n\n227\n00:12:11.998 --> 00:12:14.732\nit's not gonna be there, and\nit's gonna cause an error.\n\n228\n00:12:14.732 --> 00:12:18.900\nAnd this is why editing it manually\ncan sometimes get you in trouble.\n\n229\n00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:23.390\nBut if you're careful, and you pay\nattention to what you're doing, then\n\n230\n00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:27.490\nthere's no real problem with editing it\nmanually, but it's just not recommended.\n\n231\n00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:30.690\nBecause why, why would I take\na chance on making a typo?\n\n232\n00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:34.830\nWhen I can simply open up my Control\nPanel, default file type associations,\n\n233\n00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:38.640\nPDF, Adobe Reader, and click OK.\n\n234\n00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.080\nAnd it's gonna take care of\nputting the path in there and\n\n235\n00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.320\nall that good stuff, all right.\n\n236\n00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.580\nAll right, so now we've got\na little idea about how this works.\n\n237\n00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:50.055\nLet's go through the rest of these hives\nso we know what the heck they are for.\n\n238\n00:12:50.055 --> 00:12:53.980\nYou've got HKEY_CURRENT_USER,\nLOCAL_MACHINE, USERS and CURRENT_CONFIG,\n\n239\n00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:54.822\nall right.\n\n240\n00:12:54.822 --> 00:12:59.250\nNow HKEY_USERS is a key\nthat has the settings for\n\n241\n00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:02.130\neach user account on this computer.\n\n242\n00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:05.160\nAgain, this is a brand new computer so\nthere's not many on here,\n\n243\n00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.550\nI just installed this.\n\n244\n00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:11.520\nBut anybody that has a profile on this\nmachine is gonna get a key created for\n\n245\n00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.680\nthem under HKEY_USERS.\n\n246\n00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.555\nBecause Zach, if you log onto the machine,\n\n247\n00:13:15.555 --> 00:13:18.320\nyou might want a different\nbackground than I do.\n\n248\n00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:23.170\nSo it has a different set of\nconfigurations for each user, so\n\n249\n00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:25.250\nthat he can have different\nsettings than I have, right?\n\n250\n00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:28.642\n&gt;&gt; For instance, like when you first open\nup and it's got the principle user or\n\n251\n00:13:28.642 --> 00:13:29.285\nSwitch User.\n\n252\n00:13:29.285 --> 00:13:31.290\nThat's where that comes in.\n\n253\n00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:35.130\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it will actually come into the\nregistry, say, Zach wants to log on now.\n\n254\n00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:40.160\nLet me go get all his settings and apply\nthose, because we want Zach to log on.\n\n255\n00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:45.540\nAnd what happens, HKEY_USERS is like\nthe storage bin for everybody's profile.\n\n256\n00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:51.250\nWhen you actually log on,\nyou become current user.\n\n257\n00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:54.360\nSo it takes all the stuff from\nHKEY_USERS for your particular profile,\n\n258\n00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.030\nand it loads it into current user.\n\n259\n00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:00.551\nAnd now any changes you make, desktop\nbackground, screen saver, time outs,\n\n260\n00:14:00.551 --> 00:14:04.720\ninstalled applications, what have you,\nwill go back into HKEY_CURRENT_USER.\n\n261\n00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.430\nWhen you log off,\nit unloads HKEY_CURRENT_USER, and\n\n262\n00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.480\nstores it back in HKEY_USERS.\n\n263\n00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.430\nAnd then whoever logs on next, it gets\ntheir information out of HKEY_USERS and\n\n264\n00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:14.937\nloads it up into HKEY_CURRENT_USER.\n\n265\n00:14:14.937 --> 00:14:19.430\nSo CURRENT_USER is whoever is\ncurrently logged on right now,\n\n266\n00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:24.190\nHKEY_USERS is everybody's\nindividual set of configurations.\n\n267\n00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:29.630\nAnd then there's the two others, are gonna\nbe CURRENT_CONFIG and LOCAL_MACHINE.\n\n268\n00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:32.857\nLOCAL_MACHINE is the settings for\nthe machine, so\n\n269\n00:14:32.857 --> 00:14:36.240\nany kind of machine\nconfigurations that we've done.\n\n270\n00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:41.423\nThese are just settings for\nyour operating system, IP information,\n\n271\n00:14:41.423 --> 00:14:45.920\nnetwork settings, things like that,\nwould be stored under LOCAL_MACHINE.\n\n272\n00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:50.194\nCURRENT_CONFIG is the runtime information,\n\n273\n00:14:50.194 --> 00:14:55.962\nthings that are generated at runtime,\nso they're not saved.\n\n274\n00:14:55.962 --> 00:15:00.710\nCURRENT_CONFIG gets wiped out when\nyou shut the machine down, and\n\n275\n00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:06.802\nit gets reloaded as a fresh slate\nwhen you boot that machine up again.\n\n276\n00:15:06.802 --> 00:15:12.790\nSo CURRENT_CONFIG changes, every time\nyou reboot that machine, it reloads.\n\n277\n00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:18.364\nJust like CURRENT_USER changes every time\na new person logs onto that machine and\n\n278\n00:15:18.364 --> 00:15:19.749\nsomebody logs off.\n\n279\n00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:25.300\nSo those are our five hives that we\nhave to deal with in the registry again.\n\n280\n00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.940\nAnd it's just kind of a nice organization\nto them, so we can find everything.\n\n281\n00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:32.370\nThey're not necessarily\nstored in the same place.\n\n282\n00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:35.250\n&gt;&gt; So Mike,\ncan we talk about registry values?\n\n283\n00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:38.461\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely, you're gonna find\nthat there are different values.\n\n284\n00:15:38.461 --> 00:15:41.325\nIn fact,\nlet me go over here to HKEY_CURRENT_USER,\n\n285\n00:15:41.325 --> 00:15:43.020\nI'm gonna go to Control Panel.\n\n286\n00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:48.260\nHere's Desktop, for example, and let's see\nif I can find, there's my desktop colors.\n\n287\n00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:53.876\nThis is the button face, the color of\nany button that appears in my interface.\n\n288\n00:15:53.876 --> 00:15:58.581\nHighlighted text, right, inactive titles,\nyou might recognize some of these.\n\n289\n00:15:58.581 --> 00:16:01.561\nIf you've ever gone into\nyour Personalization and\n\n290\n00:16:01.561 --> 00:16:06.110\ntried to adjust your themes, or\nyour settings, these look familiar.\n\n291\n00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:11.080\nWhen you make those changes in the Control\nPanel, they're getting written to here.\n\n292\n00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.550\nLet's see, I could also go to, what's\nanother one that you guys would recognize?\n\n293\n00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:19.074\nIf we go back up to desktop, DocMoving,\n\n294\n00:16:19.074 --> 00:16:24.940\nCursorBlinkRate, FontSmoothing\ncapabilities.\n\n295\n00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.650\nAgain, I mean, there are thousands and\nthousands of settings here.\n\n296\n00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:29.490\nBut back to your question then,\n\n297\n00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:32.500\nyou'll notice that there's\ndifferent types over here.\n\n298\n00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:37.218\nWhen we're looking at this type column,\nI see things like REG_SZ and\n\n299\n00:16:37.218 --> 00:16:40.900\nDWORD, and I'll see if I can\nfind any other exciting ones.\n\n300\n00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:44.459\nGo back to colors, those are all SZ's,\n\n301\n00:16:44.459 --> 00:16:49.181\nSZ is for a string, so\nit's a fixed-length string.\n\n302\n00:16:49.181 --> 00:16:53.579\nYou have the SZ or MULT_SZ,\nLet's see if I can find you a multi,\n\n303\n00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:55.954\nthere's a MULT_SZ, all right.\n\n304\n00:16:55.954 --> 00:17:02.965\nMULT_SZ is multi-valued strings, this will\nactually, and you notice the difference?\n\n305\n00:17:02.965 --> 00:17:07.963\nWhen I click on SZ, there's only\none line to put my data, right, so\n\n306\n00:17:07.963 --> 00:17:10.538\nsingle, fixed-length string.\n\n307\n00:17:10.538 --> 00:17:15.120\nMULT_SZ, allows multiple values,\nseparated by commas, or spaces,\n\n308\n00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.110\nor return characters.\n\n309\n00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:20.770\nIf I could find, I should have\nprobably looked up some of these.\n\n310\n00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:25.260\nOne that I can think of right off\nthe top of my head is Internet Explorer,\n\n311\n00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.360\nwhere you can have multiple homepages.\n\n312\n00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.420\nThat would be a multi-string value,\nthat's how it's gonna have to store it,\n\n313\n00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:33.290\ncuz it's got,\nyou might want more than one.\n\n314\n00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:36.161\nIf it was a REG_SZ,\nsingle fixed-length string,\n\n315\n00:17:36.161 --> 00:17:38.830\nyou could only have one homepage, right?\n\n316\n00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:42.120\nSo that's what MULT is for,\nmultiple strings.\n\n317\n00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:46.650\nYou also have EXPAND_SZ, which I didn't\nsee any of off the top of my head here,\n\n318\n00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:47.930\nlet's see if I can find some more.\n\n319\n00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:52.260\nLooks like these are all\npretty much strings.\n\n320\n00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:57.076\nThe EXPAND_SZ, whereas SZ on its own,\nand I'm saying S and\n\n321\n00:17:57.076 --> 00:18:01.455\nthen Z as in zebra,\nthose are fixed-length strings.\n\n322\n00:18:01.455 --> 00:18:04.770\nEXPAND_SZ is just a string\nthat can be a variable length.\n\n323\n00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.637\nSo it might be 10 characters,\nit might be 50 characters, right,\n\n324\n00:18:07.637 --> 00:18:08.669\nit can expand as needed.\n\n325\n00:18:08.669 --> 00:18:13.374\nDWORD, which I see here, is a 32-bit\ninteger, if I double-click on that.\n\n326\n00:18:13.374 --> 00:18:16.161\nYou'll notice it’s\nrepresented in hexadecimal,\n\n327\n00:18:16.161 --> 00:18:18.780\nI could flip it over to\ndecimal if I wanted.\n\n328\n00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.720\nSo it’s not a string, this is an integer,\n\n329\n00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:25.530\nrepresented typically as a hexadecimal,\nso that’s what a DWORD is.\n\n330\n00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:30.961\nDWORD is 32 bits, you also have one called\na QWORD, which is gonna be 64 bits,\n\n331\n00:18:30.961 --> 00:18:34.764\nand this came out with our\n64-bit operating systems.\n\n332\n00:18:34.764 --> 00:18:40.300\nIf it's 32-bit, you won't see any of\nthose QWORDs, you'd only see the DWORDs.\n\n333\n00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:45.185\nAnd those also a REG_BINARY, which\nstores binary values, those zeros and\n\n334\n00:18:45.185 --> 00:18:46.185\nones, right.\n\n335\n00:18:46.185 --> 00:18:49.622\nSo this is different types, and\nreally, why is that important us?\n\n336\n00:18:49.622 --> 00:18:52.551\nTypically not, because we don't\nmodify the registry directly, so\n\n337\n00:18:52.551 --> 00:18:54.010\nit really doesn't matter.\n\n338\n00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:57.910\nThe GUI, the wizard, is gonna tell us\nto put a number, or put a string, and\n\n339\n00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:00.930\nseparate them with commas, and\nit will put in here correctly.\n\n340\n00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:04.490\nBut if you're ever manually editing\nthe registry, you need to pay attention.\n\n341\n00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:08.080\nIf it says it's an SZ,\ndon't type in numbers in here,\n\n342\n00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:11.770\nit's looking for a string,\notherwise it will cause you problems.\n\n343\n00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:19.175\nIf it's a DWORD, only use 32 bits, if you\nuse 40 bits or 48 bits, it's not enough.\n\n344\n00:19:19.175 --> 00:19:22.046\nThey will not be able to\nstore that value in that key,\n\n345\n00:19:22.046 --> 00:19:24.669\nbecause it is designed\nto only holds 32 bits.\n\n346\n00:19:24.669 --> 00:19:26.646\nSo that's kind of what we need to know,\nwhat those mean.\n\n347\n00:19:26.646 --> 00:19:31.509\nJust so that if we're ever making changes,\nwe know what to put in there, all right.\n\n348\n00:19:31.509 --> 00:19:34.890\nAnd the last thing I wanna show you\nwith these is, or one of the next\n\n349\n00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:38.920\nthing I want to talk about here,\nis the other function of this, of Regedit.\n\n350\n00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:41.240\nAnd we said,\nI can use it to make changes, but\n\n351\n00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:46.360\nI can also use it to back things up,\nand to import and export keys.\n\n352\n00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:51.370\nI'll tell you an example, I was teaching\na class and we were using TightVNC\n\n353\n00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:55.210\nas our utility to remotely\nconnect to these lab machines.\n\n354\n00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:57.930\nAnd so I had students and\ncomputers in my classroom.\n\n355\n00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.266\nAnd when we installed that,\nI needed to make a registry change for\n\n356\n00:20:02.266 --> 00:20:03.790\nthis program to work properly.\n\n357\n00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:07.340\nIt didn't really get along,\nwe could get it to work,\n\n358\n00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:11.155\nbut I had to tweak the registry manually,\nso, I did that on one machine.\n\n359\n00:20:11.155 --> 00:20:14.623\nNow, I had 23 other machines to do.\n\n360\n00:20:14.623 --> 00:20:18.100\nSo, what I could have done,\nis gone to each of them one at a time, and\n\n361\n00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.795\nopen up the registry editor,\nand made that change.\n\n362\n00:20:20.795 --> 00:20:23.405\nTwo reasons I'm not going to do that.\n\n363\n00:20:23.405 --> 00:20:24.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think we get that one.\n\n364\n00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:28.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, one, I'm lazy and I really\ndon't want to touch 24 machines like that,\n\n365\n00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:30.250\nit's going to take me too long.\n\n366\n00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:33.030\nTwo, I open up the possibility for\nhuman error.\n\n367\n00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:34.460\nIf I have to do the same thing 24 times,\n\n368\n00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:38.780\nwhat are the odds of me making\na typo on one of those 24 machines?\n\n369\n00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.050\n&gt;&gt; At least 2 out of 24.\n\n370\n00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:40.780\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly, and\n\n371\n00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:44.360\nif you've seen me type,\nit's probably more like 10 out of 24.\n\n372\n00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.321\nSo I all of a sudden,\nintroduce that human error thing.\n\n373\n00:20:47.321 --> 00:20:52.264\nSo what I would do, what I did instead\nwas, make the change on one machine,\n\n374\n00:20:52.264 --> 00:20:54.316\ntest it, make sure it worked.\n\n375\n00:20:54.316 --> 00:20:57.976\nAnd then export that particular\nregistry key, put it on a thumb drive,\n\n376\n00:20:57.976 --> 00:21:01.520\ntake it to the other 23 machines,\nand just import it, right?\n\n377\n00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.310\nI know it works,\nI know it's typed correctly,\n\n378\n00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:06.320\nI'm just gonna import that on to\neach one of these machines, right?\n\n379\n00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:09.334\nSo that's one of the reasons you come\nin here, and do imports and exports.\n\n380\n00:21:09.334 --> 00:21:11.962\nThe other one is, like I said,\njust to back things up,\n\n381\n00:21:11.962 --> 00:21:15.349\nto have a good known copy of your\nregistry before you make some change.\n\n382\n00:21:15.349 --> 00:21:17.360\nLike installing some applications,\n\n383\n00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:21.460\nthose applications can end up making\na lot of changes to your registry.\n\n384\n00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.800\nAnd it might make that\napplication work just fine, but\n\n385\n00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.270\nit might break other things.\n\n386\n00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:28.950\nAnd so you install it, it works, you're\nhappy, you go to launch something else and\n\n387\n00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:30.330\nit's broken.\n\n388\n00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.310\nAnd so now,\nI've gotta kind of undo all those changes.\n\n389\n00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:36.430\nAnd sometimes, uninstalling\nthe application doesn't always turn\n\n390\n00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:38.450\neverything back the way it was.\n\n391\n00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:42.360\nSo if I had a backup of the registry,\nI could simply restore that backup and\n\n392\n00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.360\nbe good to go, right?\n\n393\n00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.028\nAll right, so let's take a look here.\n\n394\n00:21:46.028 --> 00:21:50.492\nIf you're gonna export something,\nit's as simple as right-clicking, and\n\n395\n00:21:50.492 --> 00:21:54.020\ntelling it to export it, and\nI can do at whatever level I want.\n\n396\n00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:58.846\nIf I wanna export my entire registry,\nI can right-click on Computer and\n\n397\n00:21:58.846 --> 00:22:00.752\nchoose Export, all right.\n\n398\n00:22:00.752 --> 00:22:03.772\nAnd it's going to ask me where I want to\nsave it, and I'll put it on the Desktop,\n\n399\n00:22:03.772 --> 00:22:04.820\nso we can find it real easy.\n\n400\n00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:13.035\nAnd I'm going to just call it\nRegistry_all, and I'll click Save.\n\n401\n00:22:13.035 --> 00:22:15.555\nNotice it's gonna be a .reg file,\n\n402\n00:22:15.555 --> 00:22:19.015\nthat's the extension for\nregistry files when you import and export.\n\n403\n00:22:19.015 --> 00:22:22.395\n&gt;&gt; So Mike, that's fantastic,\nhow do we know if it's exported correctly?\n\n404\n00:22:22.395 --> 00:22:24.815\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question,\nlet's go look and see if it works.\n\n405\n00:22:24.815 --> 00:22:28.297\nSo I'm going to zoom back out,\nand I'll minimize this for\n\n406\n00:22:28.297 --> 00:22:30.513\njust a second, and there is my file.\n\n407\n00:22:30.513 --> 00:22:31.089\n&gt;&gt; There she is.\n\n408\n00:22:31.089 --> 00:22:34.980\n&gt;&gt; I'll just zoom in for you,\nand we'll see this, Reg_all.\n\n409\n00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:38.530\nAnd I don't wanna double-click on it,\nbecause the answer to,\n\n410\n00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:41.615\nhow do you import, is you double-click\non it, that's all you do.\n\n411\n00:22:41.615 --> 00:22:43.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You take that registry file, and\n\n412\n00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.120\nyou double-click on it, all right.\n\n413\n00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:49.760\nAnd I don't wanna do the entire registry,\nso let me show you exporting a key.\n\n414\n00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:54.950\nSo you saw me export the entire registry,\nI could also export just one hive.\n\n415\n00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:58.990\nI could right-click on, say,\nCLASSES_ROOT, and choose Export.\n\n416\n00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:06.470\nAnd I'll call this HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, or\nI'll show you the short name for these.\n\n417\n00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:12.490\nThat says root CR, a lot of times, you\njust put HKEYCR, HKEYLU for a local user.\n\n418\n00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:18.118\nHKEY current config, HKEYCC,\nto shorten those guys up, I'll click save.\n\n419\n00:23:18.118 --> 00:23:22.060\nAnd I'll do one more,\ninstead of exporting the entire hive,\n\n420\n00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:24.740\nI could take a particular key.\n\n421\n00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:29.770\nAnd let's go do that text file again,\noops,\n\n422\n00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:34.560\nI went way too far than that,\nI scrolled down a little bit too far.\n\n423\n00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:39.676\nLet's do just txt, I could right-click\n\n424\n00:23:39.676 --> 00:23:43.921\non that and I could choose Export.\n\n425\n00:23:43.921 --> 00:23:46.674\nAnd I'll say this is my .txt,\n\n426\n00:23:49.798 --> 00:23:53.156\nTXTassociation And\n\n427\n00:23:53.156 --> 00:23:58.289\nthen I can even go inside TXT and\n\n428\n00:23:58.289 --> 00:24:05.040\nexport just one of these sub-folders.\n\n429\n00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:08.220\nSo you can see that we can\nactually get anything we want.\n\n430\n00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:12.350\nThe entire registry and\nindividual hive, or an individual key.\n\n431\n00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:16.860\nWhich is what I did when I was\ntalking about my little situation\n\n432\n00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.930\nwith the type V and C.\n\n433\n00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:20.930\nSorry, brain cramp there.\n\n434\n00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:22.810\nI exported just that one key that I had.\n\n435\n00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:24.450\n&gt;&gt; You're excused, my goodness.\n\n436\n00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:25.210\nYou're doing great.\n\n437\n00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:26.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thank you, thank you.\n\n438\n00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:32.710\nAll right, and then to import again, I'll\ngo ahead and close the registry editor.\n\n439\n00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:35.010\nAnd this was my TXT key.\n\n440\n00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:38.090\nAnd if I choose edit,\nnotice I right-clicked on that file and\n\n441\n00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:41.350\nI chose edit and\nthis is what it's showing me and\n\n442\n00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:45.110\ntechnically I could make\na change here as well.\n\n443\n00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.710\n&gt;&gt; Wow!\n\n444\n00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:52.410\n&gt;&gt; But I wouldn't want to because\nthis is Notepad in hexidecimal.\n\n445\n00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:55.124\nAnd I don't want to try to\nspell out word in hexidecimal.\n\n446\n00:24:55.124 --> 00:24:55.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n447\n00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:57.790\nBecause I'm probably going\nto make a mistake and\n\n448\n00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:02.150\nif I try to import this back in it's\ngonna to cause a problem for my system.\n\n449\n00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:04.600\nSo, I wouldn't recommend\nediting it this way.\n\n450\n00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.740\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; But other keys might be easier.\n\n451\n00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:11.150\nIf it's a list of favorites,\nor home pages,\n\n452\n00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:13.690\nor something like that,\nyou know, maybe you could.\n\n453\n00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:15.270\nSo, I'm gonna close that.\n\n454\n00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:18.150\nIt won't make any changes,\nsince I didn't change any values.\n\n455\n00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:20.400\nBut let me show you how to\nimport one of these files.\n\n456\n00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.500\nI'm simply gonna double click on it.\n\n457\n00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:25.280\nAnd it's gonna say hey,\nare you sure you want to do this?\n\n458\n00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.560\nAnd I'll say yes, and\n\n459\n00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:31.300\nthe key contained has been\nsuccessfully added to the registry.\n\n460\n00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:35.680\nSo if that had been changed, or if I\nhad exported that from one machine and\n\n461\n00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.020\nimported it on another machine,\n\n462\n00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:40.540\nit would have made those\nchanges in the registry for me.\n\n463\n00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:43.070\n&gt;&gt; But\nyou can leave the shortcut up there right?\n\n464\n00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:43.630\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n465\n00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:46.910\nYeah I can leave it there, I can\ndelete it now but it's done with it so\n\n466\n00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:50.410\nat this point it's already imported\nin the registry and I can delete and\n\n467\n00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:51.350\nit won't cause any problems.\n\n468\n00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:54.290\nI can go and export them again or\nwhatever I needed to do.\n\n469\n00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:55.370\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n470\n00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:58.620\n&gt;&gt; All right last thing we wanna talk\nabout the registry now that we know what\n\n471\n00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:03.470\nit is ,what it does how we can\nmanipulate it, how we can back it up and\n\n472\n00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:05.790\nkeep it safe,\nI wanna show you the permissions.\n\n473\n00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:08.790\nCan you remember this episode\nwas called permissions.\n\n474\n00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:11.560\nSo let's make sure we cover that as well,\n\n475\n00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:14.790\ncuz I almost walked in and\nout of here without doing that.\n\n476\n00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:16.985\nSo let me, I'll just use that same key,\n\n477\n00:26:16.985 --> 00:26:18.800\nI don't want to goof\nanything up on this machine.\n\n478\n00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:23.740\nI'm gonna right click on that, and you\nnotice I have the option for permissions.\n\n479\n00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:25.950\nAll right, so I choose permissions.\n\n480\n00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:29.250\nAnd sure enough,\njust like a file or folder,\n\n481\n00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:30.810\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n482\n00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:31.580\n&gt;&gt; It's the same thing.\n\n483\n00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:36.140\nIt's an access control list that's\nassociated with this particular key.\n\n484\n00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:39.660\nAnd so I can see the creator owner\nhas some special permissions.\n\n485\n00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:42.290\nAdministrators have full control.\n\n486\n00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:46.200\nUsers have read permission\nover this particular key.\n\n487\n00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.210\nSo you need administrative\naccess to change\n\n488\n00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:52.580\nthe program that's used\nto open up text files.\n\n489\n00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:56.850\nBecause in order to change this key\nusers only have re-permissions.\n\n490\n00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:01.250\nThat means when you're logged on you\ncan read that key and you can tell your\n\n491\n00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:05.700\noperating system it can see what program\nto use, but you can't make changes to it.\n\n492\n00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:10.370\nIf you try to change what program opens\ntext files guess what's going to happen?\n\n493\n00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:11.800\nThe UAC is gonna kick in,\n\n494\n00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:15.040\nand it's gonna say type in some\nadministrative credentials.\n\n495\n00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:18.050\nBecause administrators have full control.\n\n496\n00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:21.020\nAnd they can make changes to this key,\nall right?\n\n497\n00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:26.120\nSo if I needed, I've worked with some\napplications that created a registry key\n\n498\n00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:29.870\nand the user using the application needed\nto be able to make some changes that\n\n499\n00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:33.280\nmodified that key, and they were getting\nerrors when they tried to do that.\n\n500\n00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:34.800\nThey tried to use the program.\n\n501\n00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:35.670\nAnd the program would fail.\n\n502\n00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:39.880\nAnd that's because they needed more\npermissions over that particular\n\n503\n00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.820\nkey that the application had made.\n\n504\n00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:45.250\nSo all I had to do was go into the\nregistry, find that particular key that\n\n505\n00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:49.690\nthe program was trying to change, and then\ngive users full control over that key.\n\n506\n00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:50.830\nAnd now, they could make changes.\n\n507\n00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:54.120\nSo when they ran the program,\nit was running under their user account,\n\n508\n00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.690\nit could update the key,\nand everything worked fine.\n\n509\n00:27:56.690 --> 00:28:00.490\nIt's not often that you need to come in\nhere and make changes to the permissions\n\n510\n00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:04.220\nin the registry, but\nit is something we need to know how to do.\n\n511\n00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:08.390\nSometimes for security reasons,\nwe need to lock down keys that maybe users\n\n512\n00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:11.540\ncan change but\nwe don't want them to, right?\n\n513\n00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:15.870\nWhen you do things like,\nwhat',s a good example here.\n\n514\n00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:20.570\nWhen you, I can't think of\none off the top of my head.\n\n515\n00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:27.400\nWhen you set a policy that says, hey this\nis the background I want everybody to use\n\n516\n00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.380\nand I don't want them to be able\nto pick their own background.\n\n517\n00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:31.650\nCuz you set a company background or\nsomething.\n\n518\n00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:35.050\nWhat you really end up doing behind the\nscenes, you might not do it directly, but\n\n519\n00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:36.200\nwhat's happening.\n\n520\n00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.230\nIs you're just taking away their\npermissions on changing that key.\n\n521\n00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:41.720\nSo they might want to change\ntheir background, but\n\n522\n00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:45.580\nthey can't, because their user account\ndoesn't have permissions to update the key\n\n523\n00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:49.330\nthat tells your operating\nsystem what background to use.\n\n524\n00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:53.440\nIt's interesting when people say,\ndon't ever mess with the registry,\n\n525\n00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:55.240\ndon't ever make changes to the registry.\n\n526\n00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.350\nIt's a scary, scary place.\n\n527\n00:28:57.350 --> 00:29:00.960\nNow you guys know that you make\nchanges to the registry all the time.\n\n528\n00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.720\nEverything you do ends up\nchanging the registry.\n\n529\n00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.080\nYou're just not doing it\ndirectly to the registry.\n\n530\n00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:12.010\nYou're using a tool and\nthe tool is modifying the registry.\n\n531\n00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:13.638\nSo just a little, that's all I got.\n\n532\n00:29:13.638 --> 00:29:15.617\n[LAUGH].\n\n533\n00:29:15.617 --> 00:29:19.160\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say you make\nthe registry not such a scary place and\n\n534\n00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:22.246\nnow that we know a lot more about\n&gt;&gt; registry permissions,\n\n535\n00:29:22.246 --> 00:29:24.750\nhow we can actually go in there,\nand make some modifications.\n\n536\n00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:25.620\nIt makes perfect sense.\n\n537\n00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:27.780\nIt also makes perfect sense\nto stay away from it as well.\n\n538\n00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:30.430\nBut, anything else you want to\nleave us with or we're all good?\n\n539\n00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:31.190\n&gt;&gt; No, I think that's it.\n\n540\n00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:33.960\nLIke you said, I hope at the end of this,\nyou understand, one for\n\n541\n00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:37.870\nthe exam, what registry permissions are,\nand how we use the registry.\n\n542\n00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:39.240\n&gt;&gt; What it's used for.\n\n543\n00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.790\nAnd two, another thing that you said was,\n\n544\n00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:44.780\nI hope you feel a little more\ncomfortable going into the registry.\n\n545\n00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:46.840\nCuz there are times when it\ncan be really beneficial.\n\n546\n00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.930\nI'll leave you with one more story.\n\n547\n00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:52.240\nMy stepmother takes photographs,\nshe loves to take pictures.\n\n548\n00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:55.870\nAnd she, when you open up Windows Explorer\nand you're looking at a folder that has\n\n549\n00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:58.510\na bunch of pictures,\nyou get the thumbnail view, right?\n\n550\n00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:00.920\nAnd you can go large and extra large.\n\n551\n00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:05.250\nBut even at extra large, they're not\nthat big, depending on your resolution.\n\n552\n00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:08.000\nAnd so trying to see details\nin the pictures can be tricky.\n\n553\n00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.640\nAnd then you gotta double-click on\neach one to see what it is, and\n\n554\n00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.950\nkinda scroll through or what have you.\n\n555\n00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:15.870\nSo what I did,\nwas I went into the registry and\n\n556\n00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:21.700\nI found where it stored the thumbnail\nsize for extra large display, right?\n\n557\n00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:23.220\nAnd I changed it.\n\n558\n00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:26.458\nI doubled it in size and now all of the\nsudden when she opened up File Explorer,\n\n559\n00:30:26.458 --> 00:30:31.680\nthe her thumbnails were twice the size\nthat most people would normally see and\n\n560\n00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.590\nthat was all because I was\nnot scared to dive in and\n\n561\n00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:36.320\ngo make a change in the registry.\n\n562\n00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:40.590\nAnd I was also very careful to make\nsure I only change what I needed to and\n\n563\n00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:41.220\nnothing more.\n\n564\n00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:42.475\nSo don't be afraid.\n\n565\n00:30:42.475 --> 00:30:44.160\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Get in there and poke around.\n\n566\n00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.110\nBack it up first, that's all you gotta do.\n\n567\n00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:50.240\nBefore you make changes, right-click and\nexport your entire registry and\n\n568\n00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.810\nsave that little file.\n\n569\n00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:56.210\nAnd if something goes terribly wrong, you\ncan always boot back up into safe mode or\n\n570\n00:30:56.210 --> 00:31:01.350\nuse Windows PE to boot the system,\nre-import your back up from the registry,\n\n571\n00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:03.180\nand you should be back up and\nrunning in no time.\n\n572\n00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:06.620\n&gt;&gt; That's perfect information and I'm sure\nshe also made you a nice rhubarb pie.\n\n573\n00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:07.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n574\n00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:08.680\n&gt;&gt; It was very good.\n\n575\n00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.880\nYou're watching MTA Security Fundamentals,\nwe thank you for that.\n\n576\n00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:14.350\nAnd you're also watching ITProTV.\n\n577\n00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:17.500\nYou know, an IT pro is always running.\n\n578\n00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:18.470\nI'm Jack Memmis.\n\n579\n00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:19.310\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n580\n00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:21.888\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you again real soon.\n\n581\n00:31:21.888 --> 00:31:27.881\n[MUSIC]\n\n582\n00:31:27.881 --> 00:31:30.771\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching IT.ProTV.\n\n",

00:00:12.175\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.175 --> 00:00:14.900\n&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome to another\ngreat episode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.670\nI am your host, Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode we are continuing through our\n\n6\n00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.030\nseries in the MTA 98-367\nSecurity Fundamentals, and\n\n7\n00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.710\njoining us back in the studios is\nnone other than Mr. Mike Roderick.\n\n8\n00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.740\nMike, how you doing, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.790\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic, Wes,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n10\n00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.030\nExcited as always to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.260\nYes!\nContinuing on with MTA,\n\n12\n00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.960\nin fact, continuing on with permissions,\n\n13\n00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.000\nwe talked a lot about permissions\nin the last few episodes.\n\n14\n00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.970\nThey have watched them.\n\n15\n00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.420\nMake sure you go back and check them out.\n\n16\n00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.130\nAnd we did some registry permissions,\nkind of differentiated there.\n\n17\n00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.490\nAnd now, we're going to be looking\nat Active Directory permissions.\n\n18\n00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.370\nAnd really, Active Directory in general.\n\n19\n00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.640\nWe want to have a good idea of what it is,\nhow we use it, what we use it for,\n\n20\n00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.200\nas well as how permissions are dealt\nwith inside Active Directory.\n\n21\n00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.963\nCool thing is, Wes, is you'll find that\nit's very similar to what we've already\n\n22\n00:01:01.963 --> 00:01:05.590\nseen, like with NTFS and the registry,\nright, they all kind of work the same.\n\n23\n00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.710\nAccess control lists, adding people\nto that or adding entries, and\n\n24\n00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.930\nthen allowing or denying.\n\n25\n00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.706\nSo what we've already learned will go\na long way in what we're getting ready\n\n26\n00:01:14.706 --> 00:01:15.670\nto learn.\n\n27\n00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.540\n&gt;&gt; You know, Mike, if I'm working\nin a small home office type office,\n\n28\n00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.800\nI know that it can get kind\nof problematic, if you will,\n\n29\n00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.990\nmanaging multiple identities and\nmultiple computers here.\n\n30\n00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.490\nSo what are some of the benefits.\n\n31\n00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.280\nGoing right out of the gate,\n\n32\n00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.140\nwhy would I even think about using\nsomething like Active Directory?\n\n33\n00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.580\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's going to simplify\nadministration is the big thing.\n\n34\n00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.800\nAnd it does it in several ways.\n\n35\n00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.410\nAnd before we dive into it.\n\n36\n00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.540\nLet's make sure we understand\nwhat Active Directory is.\n\n37\n00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.690\nActive Directory is Microsoft's\nimplementation of a directory service.\n\n38\n00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.800\nAnd a directory service could be as\nan analogy might like a phone book.\n\n39\n00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.860\nA directory service is something that we\ncan store information about objects in.\n\n40\n00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.100\nAnd then we can go look\ninformation up on those objects.\n\n41\n00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.870\nWe can find those objects and\nlook them up.\n\n42\n00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.320\nMicrosoft is not the only one, right?\n\n43\n00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.570\nWe've got Active Directory from Microsoft.\n\n44\n00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.670\nBut Novell for\na long time with their e-directory.\n\n45\n00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.980\nApple had a solution.\n\n46\n00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.870\n&gt;&gt; Open El apps out there too I believe.\n\n47\n00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthere's OpenSource ones that we can use.\n\n48\n00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.062\nSo there's more than\none directory service.\n\n49\n00:02:16.062 --> 00:02:19.410\nBut, for this exam,\nsince it is a Microsoft exam, and\n\n50\n00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.630\nin the real world when you get out there,\nyou will find that\n\n51\n00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.380\nActive Directory is probably\nthe most common directory service.\n\n52\n00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.620\nWindows servers being the primary\nbackbone of most of our networks.\n\n53\n00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.550\nActive Directory is something we\nreally need to be familiar with.\n\n54\n00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.580\nSo Active Directory is a directory\nservice,and it provides several services.\n\n55\n00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.860\nIt does a lot of things other than\nwhat we might first think of.\n\n56\n00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.520\nBut it uses something called LDAP,\nLightweight Directory Access Protocol.\n\n57\n00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.030\nThis is a standard for\naccessing a directory service database, so\n\n58\n00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.750\nthat we can query that database and\nlook up users, and look up resources, and\n\n59\n00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.920\nprinters, and groups,\nand things like that.\n\n60\n00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.260\nSo that's the language that we\nend up using when we communicate\n\n61\n00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.400\nwith an Active Directory database.\n\n62\n00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.990\nAnd we don't typically write it out.\n\n63\n00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.680\nBut that is like if we're\nusing a tool in the background\n\n64\n00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.640\nit's most likely using LDAP,\nLightweight Directory Access Protocol.\n\n65\n00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.710\nAlso provides us Kerberos authentication.\n\n66\n00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.870\nThis is another thing that's not\na Microsoft thing even some of us might\n\n67\n00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.650\nassume that because maybe that's\nthe only place we've dealt with it.\n\n68\n00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.780\nBut it was developed.\n\n69\n00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.690\nIt's an authentication protocol developed\nby the braniacs out there at MIT.\n\n70\n00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.800\nBeen around for a long time.\n\n71\n00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.190\nWe're on version five right now.\n\n72\n00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.910\nAnd in Microsoft world, and\n\n73\n00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.780\nMicrosoft adopted the Kerberos as\ntheir default authentication protocol\n\n74\n00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.870\nin a domain environment because\nit's very good at what it does.\n\n75\n00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.720\nBut just understand,\nit is not a Microsoft thing.\n\n76\n00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.450\nBut that is an authentication protocol.\n\n77\n00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.410\nJust like LDAP is a protocol or\nset of rules for communicating\n\n78\n00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.490\nwith that Active Directory database,\nKerberos is an authentication protocol.\n\n79\n00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.070\nSet of rules that we use to authenticate,\n\n80\n00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.660\nlike when you go to log on to your\ncomputer when you get to work.\n\n81\n00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.300\nOr when you turn your computer on and it\nhas to authenticate with Active Directory.\n\n82\n00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.580\nAlso gives us single sign on, talking\nabout benefits of Active Directory.\n\n83\n00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.230\nIt gives us something\nknown as a single sign on.\n\n84\n00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.410\nAnd we'll talk a little bit more about\nwhat that means and how it works.\n\n85\n00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.400\nBut in its basic sense, and when you\nsit down at your computer at work,\n\n86\n00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.490\nassuming you're in\nan Active Directory domain,\n\n87\n00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.785\na Microsoft Windows domain, you log in\nwhen you first sit down at your computer.\n\n88\n00:04:28.785 --> 00:04:30.685\nAnd then,\nwhen you go to access other resources,\n\n89\n00:04:30.685 --> 00:04:36.535\nlike that share on the file server, or\nthat printer, or whatever the case may be,\n\n90\n00:04:36.535 --> 00:04:41.115\nyou don't have to type in your user name\nand password every single time, right?\n\n91\n00:04:41.115 --> 00:04:42.555\nYou log in once and\n\n92\n00:04:42.555 --> 00:04:47.240\nnow you can access whatever resources\nMy account has been given access to.\n\n93\n00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.570\nSingle sign-on's, a lot better than having\nto every time you double-click on a file,\n\n94\n00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:52.940\nwait, who are you?\n\n95\n00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.085\nHere's my user name and password.\n\n96\n00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:56.400\nDouble-click on another file,\nwait, I gotta type it again.\n\n97\n00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.630\nThe single sign-on's a fantastic thing.\n\n98\n00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.400\nIt does provide for DNS naming and\nnetwork information.\n\n99\n00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.840\nIt's interesting the way\nthey word that a little bit,\n\n100\n00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.000\nbut Active Directory doesn't\nactually provide DNS, right.\n\n101\n00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.080\nDNS is a service that I run.\n\n102\n00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.542\nBut Active Directory and DNS are tied.\n\n103\n00:05:14.542 --> 00:05:17.720\nThey're like, sewn together at the hip,\nas my mom used to say.\n\n104\n00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.550\nThe old Siamese twin thing.\n\n105\n00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.830\nActive Directory cannot\nfunction without DNS.\n\n106\n00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.310\nAnd that's because we like to use names\nfor a lot of talking about resources.\n\n107\n00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.580\nWe use friendly names that\nwe give these objects.\n\n108\n00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.720\nAnd Active Directory can resolve those\nnames into IP addresses using DNS or\n\n109\n00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.010\nhelp us find those objects.\n\n110\n00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.240\nCentral location for\nadministration and delegation.\n\n111\n00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.960\nI think that's were I kind of started\nthe whole thing off when it comes to\n\n112\n00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.250\nbenefits from Active Directory and\nwhy we use this.\n\n113\n00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.070\nCentral administration.\n\n114\n00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.330\nAs Wes was alluding to, in a home\nenvironment you've only got two or\n\n115\n00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.830\nthree or five computers.\n\n116\n00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.820\nUnless you're Wes, and you've got like 25.\n\n117\n00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:02.150\nBut most of us don't have that many\ndevices in the house or in a small office.\n\n118\n00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.540\nA little dentist office where you've\ngot a computer at the front desk and\n\n119\n00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.730\nmaybe a couple laptops for\nthe doctors, and that's about it.\n\n120\n00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.560\nAnd so, the administration of those\nresource is pretty straightforward.\n\n121\n00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.860\nYou administer each machine individually\nand it's not that big of a deal.\n\n122\n00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:24.706\nBut when we start to increase that number\nto 10, to 100, to 1,000, to 10,000.\n\n123\n00:06:24.706 --> 00:06:27.285\nAnd you might think,\nmy God, Mike, who has that?\n\n124\n00:06:27.285 --> 00:06:28.215\nLots of organizations,\n\n125\n00:06:28.215 --> 00:06:32.020\nwhen you start counting up your resources\nthey add up a lot quicker then you think.\n\n126\n00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.110\nSo if you've got a thousand,\n500 users and 500 computers, or\n\n127\n00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.300\nthousands of these object,\ntrying to go around to each one of them.\n\n128\n00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.000\nLet's say Wes comes to me a the boss and\nsays, hey,\n\n129\n00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.890\nyou know what I want all of our computers\nto have a 10 minute screen saver time out.\n\n130\n00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:52.920\nOkay, now I have to go to very\nsingle machine one at a time and\n\n131\n00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.360\nconfigure that option, there is a good\nchance that I'm gonna miss one or two, and\n\n132\n00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.470\nthose few machines are gonna be\nin violation of a security policy\n\n133\n00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.270\nbecause I didn't adjust\nthe setting appropriately.\n\n134\n00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.740\nWith Active Directory and\ncentralizing administration,\n\n135\n00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.100\nthere are ways using something\nknown as group policy,\n\n136\n00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.590\nwhich we'll talk about more later that\nI can configure that setting once and\n\n137\n00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.030\nhave it applied to all the machines\nout there in my domain.\n\n138\n00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:20.210\nSo instead of doing it individually,\nguarantee is one that I don't miss\n\n139\n00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:23.790\nany computers and I don't make any typos,\nI only did it once and so\n\n140\n00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:27.430\neverything as long I did it correctly the\nfirst time, everything should be happy.\n\n141\n00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.030\nAnd it will make sure that\nthat settings enforced.\n\n142\n00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:33.800\nSo it eases the burden of administration,\nespecially nowadays with companies that\n\n143\n00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.110\nare spread out across the city,\nacross the country, across the world.\n\n144\n00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.160\n&gt;&gt; Mike,\nmaybe our viewers out there don't know.\n\n145\n00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.760\nCan you give us like a an idea.\n\n146\n00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.280\nYou mention scalability.\n\n147\n00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.520\nYou said 500, a 1,000.\n\n148\n00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.446\nWhen it comes to Active Directory,\nare we limited to a 500 or 1000?\n\n149\n00:07:47.446 --> 00:07:49.566\nWhat's the scalability\nof Active Directory?\n\n150\n00:07:49.566 --> 00:07:52.749\n&gt;&gt; It's thousands and thousands and\nthousands of objects, honestly.\n\n151\n00:07:52.749 --> 00:07:58.248\nI don't know that you can, I mean there\nis technically a limit to it, but\n\n152\n00:07:58.248 --> 00:08:04.490\nActive directory ever since Server 2000\nhas really put a no real limits on it.\n\n153\n00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:09.790\nI mean it can handle tens of thousands and\nhundreds of thousands of objects in there.\n\n154\n00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:10.950\nUnlike the NT days.\n\n155\n00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:15.462\nIf you go back too far, you go back to\nWindows NT, there were some limitations.\n\n156\n00:08:15.462 --> 00:08:18.178\nYou started putting too many\nobjects in that database,\n\n157\n00:08:18.178 --> 00:08:19.970\nthat Active Directory database, or\n\n158\n00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:24.150\nat that time the database that Windows NT\nused, and you would get performance hits.\n\n159\n00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:27.510\nAnd so you'd have to create separate\ndomains cuz you ran out of it's like,\n\n160\n00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:29.440\nall right I'm up to 5000\nobjects in this domain.\n\n161\n00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.440\nI'm gonna make another domain to\ncontinue to make objects because\n\n162\n00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.940\nthe performance would hit us.\n\n163\n00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.140\nWith Active Directory nowadays,\nthere's no such limits really.\n\n164\n00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:40.140\n&gt;&gt; So it doesn't matter if we're an SMB,\nsmall to medium business or\n\n165\n00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:44.250\nall the way up to just gigantic\ninternational business.\n\n166\n00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.950\nActive Directory's got the power,\nit can handle that.\n\n167\n00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:50.370\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely it does and you see\norganizations from like 10 computers\n\n168\n00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:54.480\nto 100,000 computers using\nActive Directory with no problem.\n\n169\n00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.056\n&gt;&gt; You know Mike, you mentioned NTLM,\ndid you wanna dive into that and\n\n170\n00:08:58.056 --> 00:08:59.640\nhelp us out with what NTLM is?\n\n171\n00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.920\n&gt;&gt; A little bit, it is something\nthat we need to be aware of.\n\n172\n00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.710\nNTLM is an old NT LAN Manager or\n\n173\n00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:08.810\nif you really wanna break it down,\nnew technology land manager.\n\n174\n00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.460\nBecause back then NT was new.\n\n175\n00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.192\nIt's an older authentication protocol.\n\n176\n00:09:13.192 --> 00:09:15.490\nAll right, and\nit's still used to be honest with you.\n\n177\n00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:17.110\nOr to make sure we understand.\n\n178\n00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:18.860\nIf you're running\na Windows NT environment.\n\n179\n00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.860\nWhich I doubt [LAUGH] anybody actually is.\n\n180\n00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.810\nBut just in case you need to know,\n\n181\n00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:27.760\nit would be the default authentication\nprotocol in an NT environment.\n\n182\n00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:32.710\nIt's also the default default\nauthentication protocol, for\n\n183\n00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:34.650\nmachines that are not part of a domain.\n\n184\n00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:38.850\nSo even if you bring up\na brand new 2016 Server, or\n\n185\n00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.520\nif you're looking at some\nof your home machines.\n\n186\n00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.413\nThey'll be using NTLM,\nbecause they're not in.\n\n187\n00:09:43.413 --> 00:09:46.640\nThere's not domain controller, which\nwe're gonna come back and talk about.\n\n188\n00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:51.960\nNo Active Directory, no centralized\nadministration, so there is no central\n\n189\n00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:56.610\ndatabase with all those user accounts,\nso NTLM is the authentication protocol.\n\n190\n00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:58.910\nAlso, if you authenticate\nto an IP address,\n\n191\n00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:01.590\neven in a domain environment,\nif you're not using names,\n\n192\n00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:05.000\nif you connect to a server via IP\naddress from a command line or\n\n193\n00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.160\nsomething like that, NTLM will actually be\nthe authentication protocol that is used.\n\n194\n00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.470\nIt's a weaker authentication protocol.\n\n195\n00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.350\nBut it's still, like I said,\nit is still used.\n\n196\n00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:20.130\nIt can also be a failback\nif Kerberos is unavailable.\n\n197\n00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:23.280\nMaybe a firewall is blocking\nthe ports necessary to do your\n\n198\n00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.050\nKerberos authentication.\n\n199\n00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:29.152\nNTLM will be the fallback\nauthentication protocol.\n\n200\n00:10:29.152 --> 00:10:32.931\nUses a old challenge\nresponse type mechanism\n\n201\n00:10:32.931 --> 00:10:37.605\nwhere the server would send\nyou a string of characters,\n\n202\n00:10:37.605 --> 00:10:43.680\nyou would use your password as a key\nto encrypt the string, send it back.\n\n203\n00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.510\nIf the server can decrypt it using\nyour password as the key then it\n\n204\n00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:52.140\nknow you used the right password\nas a key in the first place.\n\n205\n00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.990\nAnd the advantage of this was\nthe fact that, at the time,\n\n206\n00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:57.210\nthis was pretty cool technology.\n\n207\n00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:01.500\nI was able to authenticate without ever\nsending my actual password over, right?\n\n208\n00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.190\nThe domain controller\nknows what my password is.\n\n209\n00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:06.170\nI should know what my password is.\n\n210\n00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:11.980\nI used the password as a key to encrypt\nthat challenge that the server sent me.\n\n211\n00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.690\nSo I'm not sending over my password,\n\n212\n00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:16.850\nI'm just using my password as\nthe key to encrypt the string.\n\n213\n00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:22.520\nThen when it goes back to the server,\nhe knows what my password is, can use that\n\n214\n00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:27.930\npassword as the key to decrypt that\nstring and if the string is decrypted\n\n215\n00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:32.440\nproperly then I must have used the right\npassword to encrypt in the first place.\n\n216\n00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.760\nTherefore, I am authenticated.\n\n217\n00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.820\nAnd all without actually transmitting\nmy password over the network.\n\n218\n00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.790\nWhich is a great thing because now\nnobody can, intercept my password,\n\n219\n00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:42.250\nthere's no chance of\ncompromising my password.\n\n220\n00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:44.972\n&gt;&gt; That's very interesting Mike, I'm\nlearning right here, I mean it seems like,\n\n221\n00:11:44.972 --> 00:11:48.260\nwell not same protocol, it does exhibit\nsome of the characteristics of those old,\n\n222\n00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.760\nlike challenge handshake\nauthentication protocols\n\n223\n00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.820\nthat we've seen back in the early days.\n\n224\n00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:57.895\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly, like CHAP, this was kind\nof a Microsoft derivation I guess I should\n\n225\n00:11:57.895 --> 00:12:00.922\nsay of that challenge handshake\nauthentication protocol.\n\n226\n00:12:00.922 --> 00:12:06.404\nAll right, so then if I say NTLM is\nthe older protocol for authentication,\n\n227\n00:12:06.404 --> 00:12:11.624\nwe know Kerberos is the new default\never since really Server 2000,\n\n228\n00:12:11.624 --> 00:12:13.552\nso it's not new, per se.\n\n229\n00:12:13.552 --> 00:12:16.490\nBut it is now the default\nin a domain environment.\n\n230\n00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:19.450\nIt's our authentication protocol,\nsame idea,\n\n231\n00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:24.220\nsecure authentication across\nunsecured networks by encrypting.\n\n232\n00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:29.420\nAlso support something known\nas mutual authentication,\n\n233\n00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:30.810\nwhich is an important thing.\n\n234\n00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:35.300\nWe especially now a days,\nwith the bad guys being everywhere and\n\n235\n00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:38.250\ntrying to steal our information,\nsteal our credentials.\n\n236\n00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:41.050\nWhen you're authenticating,\nit's always nice to know\n\n237\n00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:43.670\nthat you're talking to the actual\nauthentication server.\n\n238\n00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:46.590\nThat you can verify the other\nend of the conversation.\n\n239\n00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:50.521\nWhat if it's a rogue server that's\ntrying to steal your credentials and\n\n240\n00:12:50.521 --> 00:12:54.911\npretending to be somebody you should end\nyour username and password to, right?\n\n241\n00:12:54.911 --> 00:12:57.560\nWith Kerberos,\nwe can enable mutual authentication.\n\n242\n00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:01.090\nWhere not only does it identify\nme to make sure I am who I am and\n\n243\n00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:03.220\nthat I have access to those resources.\n\n244\n00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:07.970\nBut I can verify that I am talking to\nthe right server and not a farming scam or\n\n245\n00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:10.450\nphishing scam or anything like that.\n\n246\n00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:14.193\nAs I said it's encrypted and time stamped,\n\n247\n00:13:14.193 --> 00:13:17.733\nwhich gives me protection against\neavesdropping, people sniffing,\n\n248\n00:13:17.733 --> 00:13:21.150\ntrying to capture the information and\nsteal my data that way.\n\n249\n00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:21.940\nIt's all garbledy gook.\n\n250\n00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:23.970\nThey can't read it because it's encrypted.\n\n251\n00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:27.120\nIt's also time stamped,\nwhich helps with replay attacks.\n\n252\n00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.910\nOne technique that the bad guys will\nuse is, if I wanna logon as Wes,\n\n253\n00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.310\nI need his credentials.\n\n254\n00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:33.940\nWell his credentials are pretty secure.\n\n255\n00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.680\nThey're stored in\nthe Active Directory database.\n\n256\n00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.540\nThey don't get transmitted across\nthe network when he authenticates.\n\n257\n00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:40.300\nHow am I gonna stale those credentials?\n\n258\n00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.200\nI could just wait til he authenticates.\n\n259\n00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.510\nAnd grab a copy of that\nauthentication packet.\n\n260\n00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:46.720\nCuz he's already put all\nthe information in there, right?\n\n261\n00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.810\nHe typed his username and password and\npackaged it up and encrypted it and\n\n262\n00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:50.430\nall that good stuff.\n\n263\n00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.210\nAnd he sent it across the network.\n\n264\n00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:53.970\nI could try to capture that packet.\n\n265\n00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:57.150\nAnd then later on, when I wanna\nauthenticate as Wes, I could just use\n\n266\n00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:02.000\na program to replay that packet, send it\nout across the network, just like I'm Wes.\n\n267\n00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.170\nAnd without older authentication\nprotocols, we're susceptible to that,\n\n268\n00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:10.340\nbecause they didn't know that that packet\nwas actually generated two hours ago.\n\n269\n00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:16.350\nSo Kerberos has time stamping and\nprotection against those replay attacks.\n\n270\n00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:19.870\nMike, I've been in a Windows\ndomain there before.\n\n271\n00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:23.200\nAnd one of the things that I've noticed\nis I can enter my password and once I'm\n\n272\n00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.200\nlogged in to the domain, provided I have\nthe privileges or permission if you will.\n\n273\n00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.821\nI notice that I don't get challenge,\n\n274\n00:14:28.821 --> 00:14:31.977\nlike all of these are the files server\nout there that's gotta share in it.\n\n275\n00:14:31.977 --> 00:14:34.650\nAnd one of the things I've noticed is,\nI don't have to re-enter a password.\n\n276\n00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:36.740\nCan you tell me a little bit\nabout what's going on there?\n\n277\n00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's that single sign on\nthat we referenced at the beginning\n\n278\n00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:40.080\nof the show.\n\n279\n00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:44.390\nAnd this is a a fantastic\nfeature of Kerberos.\n\n280\n00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:46.950\nIt gives us that single\nsign on capabilities.\n\n281\n00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:51.789\nBecause the way this works, it's a little\ndifferent from NTLM in the fact that\n\n282\n00:14:51.789 --> 00:14:54.222\nit's a ticket based authentication.\n\n283\n00:14:54.222 --> 00:14:56.831\nAnd the way it's gonna work,\nand we're not gonna go in and\n\n284\n00:14:56.831 --> 00:15:00.401\nbreak it down into the 20 steps that\nare involved in the actual authentication\n\n285\n00:15:00.401 --> 00:15:04.400\nprocess because there are quite a few\nsteps that are going on in the background.\n\n286\n00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.627\nBut basically,\nwhat I want you to know at this point,\n\n287\n00:15:06.627 --> 00:15:07.964\nis when you go to authenticate,\n\n288\n00:15:07.964 --> 00:15:11.250\nwhen you sit down at your computer\nin the morning when you get to work.\n\n289\n00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:14.270\nYou type in your username and\nyour password.\n\n290\n00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:17.150\nAnd it's encrypting it and\ntaking care of that again,\n\n291\n00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.200\nwe're not gonna break down\nthe actual protocols.\n\n292\n00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.100\nBut what's happening is you're\n\n293\n00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.740\nsending that request over\nto the domain controller.\n\n294\n00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:26.310\nThe domain controller is\nverifying that you typed in,\n\n295\n00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:30.210\nthat you're a valid user account and\nyou've provided the correct password.\n\n296\n00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:34.230\nAnd it's gonna issue you what's called\na TGT, or a ticket granting ticket.\n\n297\n00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:37.730\nThis is like your carnival pass,\nyour arm band that you get\n\n298\n00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:41.570\nwhen you go to those fairs that\npop up in town now and again.\n\n299\n00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:44.110\nAnd now that you've got\nthe ticket granting ticket,\n\n300\n00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:46.050\nyou don't have to authenticate again,\nI shouldn't say that.\n\n301\n00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:48.070\nYou don't have to provide\nyour credentials,\n\n302\n00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:49.390\nwhen you need to authenticate.\n\n303\n00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:52.379\nCuz when you go to talk to a file server,\nthe file server's gonna say,\n\n304\n00:15:52.379 --> 00:15:53.605\nwait a second, who are you?\n\n305\n00:15:53.605 --> 00:15:56.147\nYou're gonna go back to\nthe domain controller, and\n\n306\n00:15:56.147 --> 00:15:59.810\nyour machine is gonna say, here's my\nTGT that you've already issued me.\n\n307\n00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:01.227\nProves that I identified, right.\n\n308\n00:16:01.227 --> 00:16:03.434\nThis is my armband,\nI just have to flash it to you.\n\n309\n00:16:03.434 --> 00:16:07.040\nI want a session ticket now,\nto go talk to that file server.\n\n310\n00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:11.170\nAnd he'll say, yep, there's your TGT,\nI signed that earlier, it's still valid.\n\n311\n00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:13.770\nHere's your session ticket for\nthat particular file server.\n\n312\n00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:16.850\nIf you go connect to a another file\nserver, back to the domain controller.\n\n313\n00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:20.310\nHere's my TGI,\nI want to connect to file server two.\n\n314\n00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:23.400\nWell, everything looks good, here's\nyour session ticket for file server two.\n\n315\n00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:27.900\nSo every resource you click on or\ngo to, you'll get a new session ticket.\n\n316\n00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:31.051\nBut you only have to get the TGT once,\nat the beginning of that day.\n\n317\n00:16:31.051 --> 00:16:33.744\nNow, they're valid for\na certain period of time, eight hours.\n\n318\n00:16:33.744 --> 00:16:35.310\nAnd then you'll have to get another one,\n\n319\n00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:37.072\neventually you will\nhave to reauthenticate.\n\n320\n00:16:37.072 --> 00:16:40.382\nAnd that's to make sure,\nthat if you just leave yourself logged in.\n\n321\n00:16:40.382 --> 00:16:43.452\nThat eventually, that session,\nthat TGT times out and\n\n322\n00:16:43.452 --> 00:16:45.300\nyou have to authenticate again.\n\n323\n00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:47.260\nBut it's like I said,\ngoing to the carnival, right?\n\n324\n00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.510\nYou go to the gate at the front of\nthe carnival, you buy your armband.\n\n325\n00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.790\nAnd now when you go up\nto the individual rides,\n\n326\n00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:54.850\nyou don't have to break out your\nwallet and buy anything again.\n\n327\n00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:57.400\nYou can just show them the armband,\nand you're right in.\n\n328\n00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.820\nThe same kind of concept, when we're\ntalking about that single sign-on.\n\n329\n00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:04.330\nAnd that's all thanks to\nActive Directory in Kerberos.\n\n330\n00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:07.310\n&gt;&gt; Now with the client server model that\nyou've been talking about here, Mike,\n\n331\n00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:10.240\nthere's got to be some kind\nof commander-in-chief.\n\n332\n00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.640\nWhen it comes to, let's say,\nthe servers here,\n\n333\n00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.940\ninside of a Windows domain,\nwho do we see as commander-in-chief?\n\n334\n00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.840\n&gt;&gt; That is the domain controller, right?\n\n335\n00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:21.930\nThe DC for short, domain controller,\njust that name kind\n\n336\n00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:25.670\nof tells you everything you need,\nright, it is in control of the domain.\n\n337\n00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:29.010\nThe domain controller is simply\na server that I've taken, and\n\n338\n00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:31.940\nI've installed\nthe Active Directory role on.\n\n339\n00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.050\nWhen you install that\nActive Directory role,\n\n340\n00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:37.890\nyou're basically promoting that\nserver to be a domain controller.\n\n341\n00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:41.800\nYou're saying hey, you are now\nin charge of administration and\n\n342\n00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.840\nsecurity in our domain.\n\n343\n00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:49.453\nAnd thats where everything is going to get\ncentralized, is to that domain controller.\n\n344\n00:17:49.453 --> 00:17:52.703\nSo, and\nlet me make sure I say this correctly.\n\n345\n00:17:52.703 --> 00:17:55.291\nCuz when you create\nthat domain controller,\n\n346\n00:17:55.291 --> 00:17:58.092\nit gets a copy of\nthe Active Directory database.\n\n347\n00:17:58.092 --> 00:18:02.833\nOr what Microsoft will say, a replica\nof the Active Directory database.\n\n348\n00:18:02.833 --> 00:18:06.154\nThe Active Directory database is\nwhere all the information is stored.\n\n349\n00:18:06.154 --> 00:18:09.710\nThe users, their password, all that\ninformation, groups you've created.\n\n350\n00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:13.080\nA lot of stuff that we're going\nto talk about coming up here,\n\n351\n00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.780\nall stored in that database.\n\n352\n00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.841\nThat's what gives me that ability to\nmanage my network from one location,\n\n353\n00:18:18.841 --> 00:18:21.490\nbecause everything is\nstored in that database.\n\n354\n00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:25.732\nEach domain controller that you create,\nand we'll always have at least two for\n\n355\n00:18:25.732 --> 00:18:26.692\nfall tolerance.\n\n356\n00:18:26.692 --> 00:18:32.070\nIs gonna have a copy of that database,\nall right?\n\n357\n00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:33.060\nYou always want two,\n\n358\n00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:36.680\nbecause if the domain controller goes\ndown, nobody can log in anymore.\n\n359\n00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.500\nNobody can access resources anymore.\n\n360\n00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.190\nThere's nobody to go to,\nto get my ticket-granting ticket,\n\n361\n00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:44.700\nthere's nobody to show my TGT\nto to get the session ticket.\n\n362\n00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.270\nSo I can't connect to resources,\n\n363\n00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:48.660\nI can't get to anything,\nif Active Directory is down.\n\n364\n00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:53.780\nSo for fault tolerance, we're always gonna\nhave at least two domain controllers.\n\n365\n00:18:53.780 --> 00:19:01.070\nNow to install Active Directory,\nit's depending on what you read, right?\n\n366\n00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:03.530\nIt changed in 2008, and so\nI hate to go back to 2003.\n\n367\n00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:07.690\nBut this exam could definitely\nask you about 2003,\n\n368\n00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:10.290\njust as a historical\nreference more than anything.\n\n369\n00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:17.150\nRemember this exam is really geared,\n2008 and Windows 7, Windows 10.\n\n370\n00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:20.151\nSo let's go back and\ntalk about 2003 for just a little bit.\n\n371\n00:19:20.151 --> 00:19:24.850\nIn 2003,\nyou would run something known as DCPromo.\n\n372\n00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:27.035\nWhich stood for\nDomain Controller Promotion, and\n\n373\n00:19:27.035 --> 00:19:29.070\nyou'd run that from the command line.\n\n374\n00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:34.113\nAnd you could go through the process\nof creating a domain controller.\n\n375\n00:19:34.113 --> 00:19:37.275\nIn 2008 and future, so\nall the way up to now, 2016,\n\n376\n00:19:37.275 --> 00:19:40.010\nActive Directory is installed\nlike any other role.\n\n377\n00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:43.290\nYou're gonna go into Server Manager,\nAdd Roles and Features, and\n\n378\n00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:46.090\nyou're just gonna install\nthe Active Directory role.\n\n379\n00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:48.853\nBe careful,\nthat doesn't complete the installation,\n\n380\n00:19:48.853 --> 00:19:50.874\nall that does is install the role itself.\n\n381\n00:19:50.874 --> 00:19:54.803\nSo now, the machine could be a domain\ncontroller; has all the pieces,\n\n382\n00:19:54.803 --> 00:19:57.503\nparts necessary,\nyou've installed the role.\n\n383\n00:19:57.503 --> 00:20:00.030\nBut you still have to go back and\ndo a second step,\n\n384\n00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:02.321\nand that is to configure Active Directory.\n\n385\n00:20:02.321 --> 00:20:05.646\nAnd only until you get that,\nonce you get that second step done,\n\n386\n00:20:05.646 --> 00:20:08.920\nis when you actually have a new domain and\na domain controller.\n\n387\n00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:12.285\nSo it is a two-step process,\ninstalling that role, and\n\n388\n00:20:12.285 --> 00:20:15.240\nthen configuring that role afterwards,\nright?\n\n389\n00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.466\nNow, once you've installed\nActive Directory,\n\n390\n00:20:18.466 --> 00:20:23.243\nwe get a lot of different tools that\nwe can use to manage Active Directory.\n\n391\n00:20:23.243 --> 00:20:25.660\nThere's things like, in fact,\nlet's take a quick peek at my screen.\n\n392\n00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.320\nAll right, so\nI've got a domain controller here,\n\n393\n00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.970\nI've installed Active Directory on it.\n\n394\n00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:31.590\nAnd if I take a look at\nthe Tools menu up here,\n\n395\n00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:33.840\nyou'll see several tools that\ndeal with Active Directory.\n\n396\n00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.170\nThe Active Directory Administrative\nCenter, Active Directory Users and\n\n397\n00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:41.400\nComputers, Active Directory Sites and\nServices, Domains and Trust.\n\n398\n00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.930\nA module for Windows PowerShell,\n\n399\n00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:46.730\nthat gives me access to all the Active\nDirectory commands from PowerShell.\n\n400\n00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:50.860\nSo these are tolls that are installed,\nto help me administer my domain.\n\n401\n00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:54.470\nWork with users and computer accounts,\nor work with domains and trusts.\n\n402\n00:20:56.250 --> 00:21:00.978\nNow with these tools,\nthey're installed by default\n\n403\n00:21:00.978 --> 00:21:04.768\nwhen you create, oops, boy, I tell you.\n\n404\n00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.724\nWe'll see if we can get it to\nzoom back out, there we go.\n\n405\n00:21:08.724 --> 00:21:11.743\nI though I was stuck in there forever.\n\n406\n00:21:11.743 --> 00:21:15.580\nThese tools are installed by default,\nwhen you create a domain controller.\n\n407\n00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:19.670\nYou can choose not to, I suppose, during\nthe installation, but it is the default.\n\n408\n00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:22.680\nI will tell you, however,\nwe don't normally administer the domain\n\n409\n00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:25.760\ncontroller by logging in to it,\nwe administer it remotely.\n\n410\n00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.370\nSo you can go out and you can\ndownload those tools from Microsoft.\n\n411\n00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:33.070\nIt's the Remote Server\nAdministration Toolkit, or RSAT for\n\n412\n00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:35.990\nshort, just make sure you\nget the appropriate tool.\n\n413\n00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:38.080\nYou're going to need the one for,\nsay, if you're running Windows 7,\n\n414\n00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:41.010\nor if you're running Windows 10,\nthey're different tools.\n\n415\n00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:43.251\nSo, you download it,\nthey're actually a package of tools, and\n\n416\n00:21:43.251 --> 00:21:44.731\nyou just download those and install them.\n\n417\n00:21:44.731 --> 00:21:48.907\nAnd even though your machine, that you\nsit at, is not a domain controller,\n\n418\n00:21:48.907 --> 00:21:51.853\nthese tools can be pointed\nto the domain controller.\n\n419\n00:21:51.853 --> 00:21:54.273\nSo when I open up that\ntool on my Windows 10 box,\n\n420\n00:21:54.273 --> 00:21:58.013\nit's not looking at my local hard drive\nfor an Active Directory database.\n\n421\n00:21:58.013 --> 00:22:00.494\nIt's reaching out and\ntalking to the domain controller, and\n\n422\n00:22:00.494 --> 00:22:03.081\npulling the information back, so\nthat I can manage from there.\n\n423\n00:22:03.081 --> 00:22:07.282\nCuz we've talked about permissions, and\nrights, and principles of least privilege.\n\n424\n00:22:07.282 --> 00:22:10.551\nJust because I need somebody to\nadminister Active Directory.\n\n425\n00:22:10.551 --> 00:22:13.866\nDoes not necessarily mean I want\nthem to be able to log on locally,\n\n426\n00:22:13.866 --> 00:22:17.380\nto the physical server that's\nhosting Active Directory.\n\n427\n00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:21.061\nThey get administer use of\nthe computer from their machines,\n\n428\n00:22:21.061 --> 00:22:24.762\nthey don't need direct access\nto the desktop on that server.\n\n429\n00:22:24.762 --> 00:22:28.935\nAll right, I did mention I think\na little bit, we talked about how domain\n\n430\n00:22:28.935 --> 00:22:33.350\ncontrollers are the,\nthat's how we centralize administration.\n\n431\n00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:35.170\nThey've got a copy of that database, and\n\n432\n00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:39.470\nI said each domain controller has\na copy of that database, right?\n\n433\n00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:41.132\nThat's all done through replication.\n\n434\n00:22:41.132 --> 00:22:45.131\nSo if I make a change, or\nadd a new user to one domain controller?\n\n435\n00:22:45.131 --> 00:22:48.770\nThat change, or new user, gets replicated\nto all the domain controllers.\n\n436\n00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:52.020\nAny domain controller can log\nin anybody in the domain, so\n\n437\n00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.860\nthey all have to share that information.\n\n438\n00:22:54.860 --> 00:23:00.272\nThere are, however, certain things that\nare limited to a single domain controller.\n\n439\n00:23:00.272 --> 00:23:04.449\nWe normally talk about Active Directory\nas using multi-master replication, and\n\n440\n00:23:04.449 --> 00:23:07.383\nthat's way too deep for\nthis particular set of episodes.\n\n441\n00:23:07.383 --> 00:23:12.105\nBut what it basically means, is that\nthere's no one domain controller in\n\n442\n00:23:12.105 --> 00:23:16.550\ncharge, they're all considered equal,\nmulti-master, right?\n\n443\n00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:17.705\nExcept for a few things,\n\n444\n00:23:17.705 --> 00:23:20.953\nthere are some things that are limited\nto a single domain controller.\n\n445\n00:23:20.953 --> 00:23:22.983\nAnd take a look at the server classes,\n\n446\n00:23:22.983 --> 00:23:25.652\nwe'll talk much more about\nwhat those roles are.\n\n447\n00:23:25.652 --> 00:23:28.730\nWhy they're limited to a single\ndomain controller, things like that.\n\n448\n00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:33.690\nOne example would be the PDC emulator, or\nthe Primary Domain Controller emulator.\n\n449\n00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:36.714\nOne of his primary responsibilities\nis password changes.\n\n450\n00:23:36.714 --> 00:23:41.451\nAnd what, even though you might have\n20 domain controllers on your network.\n\n451\n00:23:41.451 --> 00:23:45.062\nThe one domain controller,\nthat's acting as the PDC emulator,\n\n452\n00:23:45.062 --> 00:23:47.302\nhandles all password changes, right.\n\n453\n00:23:47.302 --> 00:23:51.161\nThat way, there's no issues with one\ndomain controller doing one thing,\n\n454\n00:23:51.161 --> 00:23:55.705\nanother domain controller doing something\nelse, trying to conflict with each other.\n\n455\n00:23:55.705 --> 00:23:58.349\nWe just say, okay,\nyou're in charge of passwords, all right,\n\n456\n00:23:58.349 --> 00:23:59.561\nthat one domain controller.\n\n457\n00:23:59.561 --> 00:24:03.054\nSo just understand that, for the most\npart, Active Directory is multi-master.\n\n458\n00:24:03.054 --> 00:24:05.230\nIt doesn't matter what domain\ncontroller you talk to,\n\n459\n00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:06.445\nthey can all do the same thing.\n\n460\n00:24:06.445 --> 00:24:11.056\nThere are, however, four or\nfive domains that you can,\n\n461\n00:24:11.056 --> 00:24:15.492\nthat are limited to\nan individual domain controller.\n\n462\n00:24:15.492 --> 00:24:18.092\nOther servers that we bring\ninto our domain, remember,\n\n463\n00:24:18.092 --> 00:24:20.420\ndomain controller is not our only server.\n\n464\n00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:23.633\nWe've got DNS servers, we've got DHCP\nservers, we've got file servers.\n\n465\n00:24:23.633 --> 00:24:28.920\nWe've got SharePoint servers, we've got\nweb servers, all that good stuff, right?\n\n466\n00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.750\nOther servers that are part of the domain,\nthat are not hosting\n\n467\n00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:36.340\na copy of the Active Directory database,\nare known as member servers.\n\n468\n00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.440\nSo when you hear somebody on the exam,\nthey're saying,\n\n469\n00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:42.890\nyou have a member server that is hosting\na file share, yadda yadda yadda.\n\n470\n00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:46.220\nWhen you see that, you'll know\nthat server is part of a domain,\n\n471\n00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.040\nit's not stand-alone,\nit is part of an Active Directory.\n\n472\n00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:52.560\nThat's what member means,\nit's a member of a domain.\n\n473\n00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.730\nIt's just not hosting a copy of\nthe Active Directory database, so\n\n474\n00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:57.330\nit's not a domain controller.\n\n475\n00:24:57.330 --> 00:25:00.521\nAll your servers in your network\nare either domain controllers or\n\n476\n00:25:00.521 --> 00:25:01.979\nmember servers, all right?\n\n477\n00:25:01.979 --> 00:25:06.122\nAll right, and Wes, I know that we\ngot a couple of more minutes, but\n\n478\n00:25:06.122 --> 00:25:08.612\nthat's probably a good place to break.\n\n479\n00:25:08.612 --> 00:25:10.978\nCuz our next topic, Organizational Units,\n\n480\n00:25:10.978 --> 00:25:13.913\nis gonna take me longer than\nwhat I see left on the clock.\n\n481\n00:25:13.913 --> 00:25:18.151\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, we definitely have a\nlong list ahead of you, all great content.\n\n482\n00:25:18.151 --> 00:25:21.177\nThis is all good foundational\ninformation that you need,\n\n483\n00:25:21.177 --> 00:25:25.080\nif you're gonna be in any kind of\ncorporate-based Windows environment.\n\n484\n00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:29.197\nMike, so I agree with you, we'll go ahead,\nwe'll leave a Mike cliffhanger, and\n\n485\n00:25:29.197 --> 00:25:30.740\nwe'll come back with the part two, Mike.\n\n486\n00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:33.850\nAs always, we do appreciate having\nyou in the studios with us, and\n\n487\n00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:35.900\nwe appreciate you, the viewer, watching.\n\n488\n00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:37.970\nKeep in mind, we've got more MTA to come.\n\n489\n00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:39.600\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n490\n00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:40.190\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n491\n00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:42.432\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n492\n00:25:42.432 --> 00:25:48.980\n[MUSIC]\n\n493\n00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.405\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Coming at you live from San Francisco,\nCalifornia.\n\n4\n00:00:06.641 --> 00:00:08.186\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.186 --> 00:00:12.220\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPROTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.460\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITPROTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.570\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.360\nAnd in today's episode, we are continuing\nthrough our series on MTAs 98367,\n\n9\n00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.060\nsecurity fundamentals and\njoining us back in the studios for\n\n10\n00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.060\na part two on active directory permissions\nis none other then Mr. Mike Roderick.\n\n11\n00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.260\nMike how you doing sir?\n\n12\n00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.290\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great ready to continue\non my little mini series here of\n\n13\n00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.350\nactive directory right?\n\n14\n00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.590\nWe got a lot of good information in on\nthe previous episode on active directory.\n\n15\n00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.390\nMake sure you jump back and watch that.\n\n16\n00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.209\nIf you haven't cuz we're just gonna\ndive back in to active directory and\n\n17\n00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:45.770\ncontinue on.\n\n18\n00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.860\n&gt;&gt; Mike you told us in the first part, I'm\ngonna have to review just a little bit,\n\n19\n00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.750\nthat the active directory would\nscale up to just thousands and\n\n20\n00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.350\nthousands and thousands of objects.\n\n21\n00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.430\nAnd I can only imagine having\na thousand piece jigsaw puzzle,\n\n22\n00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.600\nyou throw it on the table and\nthere's just no telling what's going on.\n\n23\n00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.240\nIs there a way that we can kind\nof architect if you will our\n\n24\n00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.782\nactive directory to make a little\nbit more feasible to manage.\n\n25\n00:01:07.782 --> 00:01:11.890\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, it's a very important\npart of managing active directory is\n\n26\n00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.188\nthe ability to organize those objects\nwithin our active directory database.\n\n27\n00:01:15.188 --> 00:01:17.930\nCuz as you mentioned,\nas we menti,oned in a previous episode\n\n28\n00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.480\nactive directory scales to hundreds of\nthousands of objects and you and I,\n\n29\n00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.020\nwe all have gone through this pain.\n\n30\n00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.950\nYou ever had a folder of Pictures, and\nyou're looking for a particular one.\n\n31\n00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.560\nAnd there's a hundred pictures in there.\n\n32\n00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.320\nYou're scrolling, scrolling, scrolling,\nscrolling, trying to find it.\n\n33\n00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.120\nYou get to the end.\n\n34\n00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.190\nAw, I must have missed it.\n\n35\n00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.880\nYou scroll back up.\n\n36\n00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.270\nImagine your active directory database,\nand\n\n37\n00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.800\nyou've got a thousand users and\n5000 computer objects.\n\n38\n00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.080\nAnd you're trying to\nfind a particular one.\n\n39\n00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.950\nAnd you're scrolling through this one big,\nlong list of objects.\n\n40\n00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.700\nNot going to be very manageable,\nnot very easy to work with.\n\n41\n00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.430\n&gt;&gt; I was going to say, you've been looking\nthrough my OneDrive account, right?\n\n42\n00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.390\nThat's the way I organize it for sure.\n\n43\n00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.470\nSo when it comes to active directory here\nthough, we do have some options, right?\n\n44\n00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.950\n&gt;&gt; We do.\nI'm going to go back and\n\n45\n00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.070\nmake sub folders in that folder, I swear.\n\n46\n00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.490\nOne day I'll get them organized and\nby the time you get around to it it's too\n\n47\n00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.860\nlate there is just so\nmany object you're like, yah whatever.\n\n48\n00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.940\nMy music at home is the same way,\n\n49\n00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.590\none day I'm going to get it all\nin folders and organize it.\n\n50\n00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.377\nBut it is the same concept with an active\ndirectory and they're actually,\n\n51\n00:02:18.377 --> 00:02:21.850\nyou can almost look at them like\nfolders but we don't call folders.\n\n52\n00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.270\nWithin active directory we'll end\nup creating something known as\n\n53\n00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.670\norganizational units.\n\n54\n00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.590\nThey look like a folder,\nthey act like a folder, but we're\n\n55\n00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.030\ngoing to call them organizational units,\nbecause it sounds more fancy, right.\n\n56\n00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.740\nBut they allowed us to,\nthey are a unit of organization, right?\n\n57\n00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.870\nThey allow us to organize objects.\n\n58\n00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.800\nThey are container objects.\n\n59\n00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.590\nOUs are container objects, meaning\nthat they can contain other objects.\n\n60\n00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.360\nWe can put things inside them like\nuser accounts, computer accounts,\n\n61\n00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.350\ngroups, printers.\n\n62\n00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.570\nAll those active directory objects,\nwe can start to organize them.\n\n63\n00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.630\nAnd it makes working with\nthem a whole lot easier.\n\n64\n00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.750\nLet's take a look at my screen here.\n\n65\n00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.770\nI've got a simple diagram\nthat I just want to show you,\n\n66\n00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.650\nits like a sub set of what active\ndirectory might look like and\n\n67\n00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.280\nI will show you an actual active\ndirectory database here in just a minute.\n\n68\n00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.310\nImagine this was my employees\norganizational unit and\n\n69\n00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.100\ninside there I've got people, right.\n\n70\n00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.260\nMy user accounts, now there's obviously\nthere's only like six of them here but\n\n71\n00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.370\nI didn't want to draw out 5000 little\nstick figures so bear with me and\n\n72\n00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.630\nkind of use your imagination.\n\n73\n00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.070\nImagine wow, that's a lot of users.\n\n74\n00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.180\nCrazy how many's in there, alright.\n\n75\n00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.800\nSo one, just finding the right user\naccount can be challenging in a big\n\n76\n00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.090\nlist like this.\n\n77\n00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.230\nTwo, another reason we use\norganizational units is for\n\n78\n00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.990\ndelegation of administrative control.\n\n79\n00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:48.130\nInside an active directory database I\ncan give other people permissions and\n\n80\n00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.210\nI can give them the ability to manage\ncertain objects in active directory.\n\n81\n00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.370\nAll right.\nI might go to the sales manager and\n\n82\n00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.522\nsay, look you hire new sales people and\nfire new sales people every day.\n\n83\n00:03:59.522 --> 00:04:03.490\nI'm gonna give you the ability\nto create new sales users.\n\n84\n00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.810\nSo, you don't have to call me everyday,\nand go, hey, I need three new accounts and\n\n85\n00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:07.890\ndelete these two.\n\n86\n00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.560\nAnd tomorrow, hey, I need five\nmore accounts, delete these three.\n\n87\n00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.840\nHow about I just delegate to that sales\nmanager permissions in active directory?\n\n88\n00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.430\nAnd we'll talk more about the delegation\nand how specific, it's a fantastic thing.\n\n89\n00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.000\nBut if we look at my drawing on the left,\n\n90\n00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.320\nimagine the sales people\nwere the yellow people.\n\n91\n00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.970\nAnd you delegate permissions\nat the OU level.\n\n92\n00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.570\nIf I wanna give that sales manager\npermissions over the sales users,\n\n93\n00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.240\nIf everybody is all in the same folder,\n\n94\n00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.830\nif you will, organizational unit,\nthat becomes very difficult.\n\n95\n00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.150\nHow can I say you can have permission over\nthis one and this one but not this one or\n\n96\n00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.480\nthis one or this one or this one and\nyou take that same OU and\n\n97\n00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.730\ncreate some sub OUs, one for\nsales, still all employees, but\n\n98\n00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.140\nnow I've got a sub OU for sales employees,\na sub OU for marketing, and a sub OU for\n\n99\n00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.560\nmanagers, so\nnow I could go to the sales OU and\n\n100\n00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.440\ngive the sales manager permissions to work\nwith user accounts just over that OU, and\n\n101\n00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.790\nhe could manage the sales users but\nnot marketing and not managers.\n\n102\n00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.670\nBut what if I have a corporate help desk\n\n103\n00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.500\nthat needs to manage all users\nno matter where they're at.\n\n104\n00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.500\nI can still do that at my top level,\nmy employees OU.\n\n105\n00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.310\nSo by structuring my active directory and\norganizing my objects the way I want\n\n106\n00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.060\nto facilitate administration,\nI can make my life a whole lot easier.\n\n107\n00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.280\nNow you might have an organization\nwhere you've got offices in Tampa,\n\n108\n00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.330\nNew York and Tokyo.\n\n109\n00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.920\nRight?\n\n110\n00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.940\nAnd so you could first divide it up by\ngeographical region, because there's gonna\n\n111\n00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.480\nbe some policies that apply to the Tokyo\nOffices that don't apply to San Fransisco\n\n112\n00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.470\nor wherever other offices I've already\nforgot which cities I've mentioned.\n\n113\n00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.630\nYou can organize,\nthere's no right or wrong way.\n\n114\n00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.640\nTo organize objects in active directory.\n\n115\n00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.080\nIt's whatever works best for you.\n\n116\n00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.770\nAlright?\n\n117\n00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.280\nI might it have it first Tampa, and\nthen sales, marketing, and managers.\n\n118\n00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.280\nAnd then I might have another top level\nfor New York, and sales, and marketing,\n\n119\n00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.280\nand managers.\n\n120\n00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.500\nAnd that make it easier if I have\nsettings that apply to a region, right.\n\n121\n00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.630\nBut if I have settings that apply just\nto sales now I have to do it twice.\n\n122\n00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.680\nOnce under New York sales and\nonce under Tampa sales.\n\n123\n00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.920\nSo maybe I flip things around.\n\n124\n00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:28.080\nMaybe in my environment it's easier if I\ndivide it by sales and marketing first.\n\n125\n00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.800\nAnd then within sales, Tampa and New York.\n\n126\n00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.230\nYou can do whatever you want,\nthat's the great thing.\n\n127\n00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.570\nAnd guess what?\n\n128\n00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.620\nThey're not written in stone,\nyou can change anytime you need to.\n\n129\n00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.460\nIf you wanna go in, it's a lot of work,\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n130\n00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.770\nYou really want to have a plan\nof action before you go in,\n\n131\n00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.410\nbut nothing is permanent.\n\n132\n00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.470\n&gt;&gt; Seems like an active\ndirectory cookbook, right?\n\n133\n00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:51.450\nIf your architecture or recipe, if you\nwill, for success built a certain way and\n\n134\n00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.080\naround your environment then\nthat's great for your environment.\n\n135\n00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.890\nBut then if I want to modify it to suit\nmy environment, well looks like the sky's\n\n136\n00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.310\nthe limit and you do have the ability and\nthe flexibility if you will,\n\n137\n00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.860\nto really just peak and tweak things\nto match whatever your company needs.\n\n138\n00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.520\n&gt;&gt; Yep, absolutely right,\nit's just a fantastic thing.\n\n139\n00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.960\nYou will learn to love active directory\nas you get into network administration.\n\n140\n00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.370\nAlright, tell ya what, I'm gonna flip\nover to my domain controller and\n\n141\n00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.000\nlet's take a look at an actual\nactive directory database.\n\n142\n00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.080\nI'm going to go to my tools menu, and\n\n143\n00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.530\nI'm going to open up active\ndirectory users and computers.\n\n144\n00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.290\nAnd we'll take a peak at\nwhat we've got in here.\n\n145\n00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.930\nThis is a default install\nof active directory.\n\n146\n00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:31.230\nNow, there are some built\nin containers and OUs.\n\n147\n00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:35.450\nAll of this was here just from\ninstalling active directory, except for\n\n148\n00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.260\nthat account called,\nMike that you see down there.\n\n149\n00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:38.190\nI went ahead and created that.\n\n150\n00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.315\nEverything else is just a default install.\n\n151\n00:07:40.315 --> 00:07:45.990\nThose built in containers,\nthere's a downside of those.\n\n152\n00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:50.950\nAnd that is that we cannot assign\npermissions over them, and\n\n153\n00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:54.556\nwe cannot apply group\npolicy to those guys.\n\n154\n00:07:54.556 --> 00:07:57.857\nSo, while they're good to have,\nthose built in containers,\n\n155\n00:07:57.857 --> 00:07:59.739\nwe typically go in and make our own.\n\n156\n00:07:59.739 --> 00:08:02.897\nAnd then,\nwe move our objects where appropriate.\n\n157\n00:08:02.897 --> 00:08:06.227\nSo as an employee and as a manager,\nlet me see if I can zoom in and\n\n158\n00:08:06.227 --> 00:08:09.120\nactually work here,\nI might do something like this.\n\n159\n00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.920\nI might go up to my domain,\nright-click New, Organizational Unit.\n\n160\n00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.411\nAnd let's say I call it.\n\n161\n00:08:18.375 --> 00:08:20.627\nEmployees, all right?\n\n162\n00:08:20.627 --> 00:08:24.237\nAnd then within Employees,\nI could also instead of right-clicking,\n\n163\n00:08:24.237 --> 00:08:28.950\nI could use my little buttons up here,\nand I'm gonna create one called Sales.\n\n164\n00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:35.924\nAnd maybe I jump back out to Employees and\ncreate another one called Marketing.\n\n165\n00:08:38.228 --> 00:08:40.100\nAll right, and so on and so forth.\n\n166\n00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:44.720\nAnd you can see I'm slowly building\nout my Active Directory infrastructure\n\n167\n00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.442\nby creating those OUs.\n\n168\n00:08:46.442 --> 00:08:48.280\nNow we'll delegate in a little bit.\n\n169\n00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.630\nI'll show you how to delegate control,\nI'll run through that wizard.\n\n170\n00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:55.910\nThe other thing that we get, and then I\nwould move my user accounts into there,\n\n171\n00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.800\nor create my user accounts.\n\n172\n00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.061\nWe'll come back to that because I do\nwant to create a user account for\n\n173\n00:09:00.061 --> 00:09:01.219\nyou to show you what's involved.\n\n174\n00:09:01.219 --> 00:09:03.475\nBut before we get there, as I said,\n\n175\n00:09:03.475 --> 00:09:06.810\ndelegation is one reason\nwe create those OUs.\n\n176\n00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.620\nOrganizing the objects is another\nreason we create those OUs,\n\n177\n00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.120\nmake it easier to work with.\n\n178\n00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.310\nThird reason is applying policy.\n\n179\n00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:16.210\nNow I said,\nwe're gonna centralize administration.\n\n180\n00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:21.590\nWell now that I have those OUs created,\nI can go into a tool called\n\n181\n00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:27.890\nGroup Policy Management, and\nI will see those OUs that I just created.\n\n182\n00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:30.940\nThere's Employees, there's Marketing,\nand there's Sales.\n\n183\n00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.505\nAnd if I have a setting that\napplies to all employees,\n\n184\n00:09:33.505 --> 00:09:36.133\nno matter what your department is,\nI can come in here.\n\n185\n00:09:36.133 --> 00:09:42.460\nAnd I can make a new policy\ncalled All Employees, all right?\n\n186\n00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:46.890\nBut if I have a setting that only applies\nto Sales, I can come and make a GPO here,\n\n187\n00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:50.750\nand say, Just Sales Users.\n\n188\n00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:54.090\nAnd pardon my typing skills,\nI know they're not great.\n\n189\n00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:57.170\nSo you see what we're doing\nwith that organization there.\n\n190\n00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.290\nBy creating those OUs,\n\n191\n00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:03.830\nI can now apply a policy to just sales\npeople with one little click, right?\n\n192\n00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:05.810\nOr if I have something that\ngoes to all employees,\n\n193\n00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:08.540\nno matter what department,\nI can still do that.\n\n194\n00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.260\nAll because of how I created my OUs, and\n\n195\n00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.690\nhow I organized my objects\nin Active Directory.\n\n196\n00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:16.890\n&gt;&gt; Mike, would you say that that's one of\nthe major differences between a container?\n\n197\n00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.750\nCuz I noticed that in your Group Policy\nconsole, I don't see containers.\n\n198\n00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:23.810\nThe fact that containers cannot have\nGroup Policy apply to them, only OUs.\n\n199\n00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:26.410\n&gt;&gt; That's right and that's why they don't\neven show up in this particular console,\n\n200\n00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:28.950\ncuz this console is used\nto manage Group Policy.\n\n201\n00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:32.410\nAnd so we can't apply policy\nto built-in containers.\n\n202\n00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:35.230\nSo they don't even show up in the list,\nall right?\n\n203\n00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:37.190\nYou have computer accounts.\n\n204\n00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:42.800\nWhen you install Active Directory, there\nis a built-in container called Computers.\n\n205\n00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.130\nAnd by default, all new computer accounts\nas you add computers to the domain\n\n206\n00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:48.190\nare gonna go in there.\n\n207\n00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:52.060\nThat's a horrible place for them,\nbecause I can't manage them using\n\n208\n00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:55.710\nmy Group Policy and\nI can't delegate control over them.\n\n209\n00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.840\nSo one of the first things we do in\nActive Directory is make a new OU\n\n210\n00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.310\ncalled clients or servers.\n\n211\n00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:02.975\nAnd then we subdivide that by Tampa and\nNew York.\n\n212\n00:11:02.975 --> 00:11:07.580\nAnd then we might even subdivide that by\nmarketing computers that are in Tampa or\n\n213\n00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.170\nsales computers that are in New York.\n\n214\n00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:13.540\nWhen I was talking about Active Directory\nand OUs, one thing I didn't mention is\n\n215\n00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:18.090\nthere's really no limit on how\nmany nested levels you could go.\n\n216\n00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:20.040\nI could have an OU called employees.\n\n217\n00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.373\nWithin that I could have\nan OU called Tampa,\n\n218\n00:11:22.373 --> 00:11:24.525\nwhere I start subdividing it by region.\n\n219\n00:11:24.525 --> 00:11:28.530\nAnd then within Tampa,\nmaybe I've got HR and marketing and sales.\n\n220\n00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.790\nAnd within marketing,\nmaybe I've got marketing users and\n\n221\n00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:32.300\nI've got marketing managers.\n\n222\n00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.790\nAnd then within that, I mean I could\nkeep going as far as I wanted to.\n\n223\n00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:40.910\nBut understand you will hit a performance\nbarrier at some point with that.\n\n224\n00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.870\nThe more nested levels you go,\n\n225\n00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:48.470\nthe longer it takes to query Active\nDirectory, ask questions and find things.\n\n226\n00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:52.396\nSo Microsoft will typically say, keep\nit as shallow, what they call shallow,\n\n227\n00:11:52.396 --> 00:11:53.650\nas possible.\n\n228\n00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.220\nNest for organization, definitely do that.\n\n229\n00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:01.230\nWe like that ability to separate Tampa\nfrom New York and sales from marketing.\n\n230\n00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:02.690\nBut don't go ridiculous with it.\n\n231\n00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:07.650\nDon't go marketing users, and then within\nthere, marketing users from a to m,\n\n232\n00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:12.920\nmarketing users from n to z, female\nfrom a to n, and that kind of thing.\n\n233\n00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.830\nDon't go to far, you need a purpose.\n\n234\n00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:18.180\nThere's a reason for creating those OUs.\n\n235\n00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.981\nIf you don't have settings that\nare different from males or\n\n236\n00:12:20.981 --> 00:12:23.705\nfemales, don't make OUs for\nmales or females, right?\n\n237\n00:12:23.705 --> 00:12:26.300\nThat's just, you wanna use\na little bit of sense with that.\n\n238\n00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.290\nYou can go as far as you want,\n\n239\n00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:31.350\nbut don't take it too far, because\nyou will run into performance issues.\n\n240\n00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:35.010\nAll right, let me back out,\nlet me zoom back out of that there.\n\n241\n00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:36.520\nNext thing I wanna start talking about,\nWes,\n\n242\n00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.650\nare some of the objects that we\nfind within Active Directory.\n\n243\n00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:45.420\nUsers are gonna be one of them, computers\nare gonna be another one, groups.\n\n244\n00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.080\nThose are the big three\nthat they call out.\n\n245\n00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.730\nThere are others, but\nthose are the three they'll call on this\n\n246\n00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:50.870\nexam.3\n&gt;&gt; Mike,\n\n247\n00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.300\none thing I know that I don't\nneed Active Directory for, right,\n\n248\n00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:57.710\nis to get in there and get into computer\nmanagement and I can create a user.\n\n249\n00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.209\nI don't need Active Directory\nto create a user.\n\n250\n00:12:59.209 --> 00:13:02.887\nSo what are some of the things that kinda\nstand out, the differences between,\n\n251\n00:13:02.887 --> 00:13:06.620\nmaybe a user you find in Active Directory\nversus one that I can walk into a home and\n\n252\n00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:08.360\nby just create?\n\n253\n00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.355\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question, Wes.\n\n254\n00:13:09.355 --> 00:13:14.960\nAnd we wanna differentiate between\nlocal users versus domain users, right?\n\n255\n00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:20.234\nLocal users are users that are created\non a particular Windows machine and\n\n256\n00:13:20.234 --> 00:13:23.049\nthey're stored on that same machine.\n\n257\n00:13:23.049 --> 00:13:26.910\nThere's a, what's called a Security\nAccount Manager or a SAM database on every\n\n258\n00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:30.730\nWindows machine, except for domain\ncontrollers, had to throw that in there.\n\n259\n00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:34.375\nBut every other Windows machine\nhas a local SAM file or\n\n260\n00:13:34.375 --> 00:13:37.680\na Security Account Manager database.\n\n261\n00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.690\nAnd when you go to Computer Management,\nyou right-click new user.\n\n262\n00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:42.730\nLet's say you bought a computer for\nthe house, and\n\n263\n00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:44.760\nyou wanna make your spouse an account.\n\n264\n00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.370\nYou wanna make an account for your kids.\n\n265\n00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.610\nWell, when you go in there,\n\n266\n00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:51.710\nmake a new user,\nthose are stored in the local SAM file.\n\n267\n00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:55.430\nAnd when you go to log on to that local\ncomputer, you type in your username and\n\n268\n00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:59.450\npassword, checks it against that\nlocal SAM file in that same database.\n\n269\n00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:02.330\nAnd if appropriate,\nit'll allow you to log in.\n\n270\n00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.010\nAnd you'll have access\nto that one machine, but\n\n271\n00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:09.390\nno other machines, because that account\nis stored locally on your machine.\n\n272\n00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:13.080\nAnd your machine is the only computer\nthat knows about that account.\n\n273\n00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.260\nIt doesn't know Wes has a computer.\n\n274\n00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.610\nHe's got a local SAM file,\nhe has accounts stored in there.\n\n275\n00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:22.030\nMy computer doesn't know anything about\nthose accounts, not stored over here,\n\n276\n00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:23.760\nstored on Wes' computer.\n\n277\n00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.890\nAnd if Wes tried to use one of those\naccounts to access resources on my\n\n278\n00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:30.440\ncomputer, my computer is gonna say,\npff, no, I don't know who you are.\n\n279\n00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.785\nI don't know what that account is even,\nI've never seen it before.\n\n280\n00:14:32.785 --> 00:14:37.470\nCuz local accounts are stored locally and\nthey only give you access\n\n281\n00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:42.130\nto local resource, right?\n\n282\n00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:43.680\nThere's a couple built-in by default.\n\n283\n00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:48.580\nThere's the local administrator account,\nwhich is enabled by default,\n\n284\n00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:52.480\nalthough that's kind of changed in\nthe last few versions of Windows.\n\n285\n00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.920\nThey make you create an account\nwhen you install Windows and\n\n286\n00:14:54.920 --> 00:15:00.030\nthat becomes the local admin and\nthe default is disabled.\n\n287\n00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:02.917\nBut for this exam,\nunderstand that Windows 7,\n\n288\n00:15:02.917 --> 00:15:05.695\nI think it was Windows 7 was\nstill enabled by default.\n\n289\n00:15:05.695 --> 00:15:08.345\nBut there's two accounts,\nthe admin account and\n\n290\n00:15:08.345 --> 00:15:10.688\na guest account is also\ncreated by default.\n\n291\n00:15:10.688 --> 00:15:15.095\nIt's a local account, and it's designed\nto give people access to resources on\n\n292\n00:15:15.095 --> 00:15:18.277\nyour computer when they don't\nhave an account, right?\n\n293\n00:15:18.277 --> 00:15:19.660\nThat's disabled by default.\n\n294\n00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.560\nUnless you've got a really good reason,\nyou should just leave it disabled.\n\n295\n00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.000\nYou don't want people authenticating,\nor getting access to your machine\n\n296\n00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.450\nwithout having to provide a user name and\npassword, all right?\n\n297\n00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:33.800\nBut in a domain environment, again,\nin a small shop, those might be fine.\n\n298\n00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.110\nBecause let's say it's just Wes and\nI in our office.\n\n299\n00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:38.420\nI've got my account stored in my SAM file,\n\n300\n00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.700\nWes has his account\nstored in his SAM file.\n\n301\n00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.240\nThey don't know about each other.\n\n302\n00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:46.780\nBut if Wes needs to access resources on my\ncomputer, I can simply make an account on\n\n303\n00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.980\nmy computer and\nthen he could use that to authenticate.\n\n304\n00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:53.700\nIt's local to my computer,\nI make Wes Bryan and a password.\n\n305\n00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:58.740\nHe can now connect to my computer, use an\naccount that's stored in my SAM file, and\n\n306\n00:15:58.740 --> 00:15:59.638\naccess my machine.\n\n307\n00:15:59.638 --> 00:16:00.895\nAnd he could do the same thing.\n\n308\n00:16:00.895 --> 00:16:03.394\nHe could create an account for\nme on his computer.\n\n309\n00:16:03.394 --> 00:16:05.966\nAnd now I can access\nresources on his machine.\n\n310\n00:16:05.966 --> 00:16:07.888\nEasy-breezy, right?\n\n311\n00:16:07.888 --> 00:16:12.190\nUntil you have 5, or 10, or 15 computers.\n\n312\n00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:15.780\nNow let's use nice round numbers.\n\n313\n00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.670\nTen computers, ten users in an office.\n\n314\n00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:23.850\nEach user needs to access resources\non the other nine user's computers.\n\n315\n00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:25.480\nSo how many accounts are we managing now,\nWes?\n\n316\n00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.930\nYou have any idea?\n&gt;&gt; You are gonna throw math\n\n317\n00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:28.420\nright here live on camera.\n\n318\n00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:29.710\nI'm thinking about a 100 accounts.\n\n319\n00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:30.960\n&gt;&gt; It is 100 accounts.\n\n320\n00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.190\nTen users,\neach one needs an account on each machine.\n\n321\n00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:35.320\nThere's 10 machines.\n\n322\n00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.840\n10 times 10 is a 100.\n\n323\n00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:40.730\nSo for an office of 10 users and\n10 computers,\n\n324\n00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:45.030\nyou're managing 100 user accounts.\n\n325\n00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:47.735\n&gt;&gt; Does that take us back to where you\nwere mentioning in the first part in part\n\n326\n00:16:47.735 --> 00:16:51.490\none, where scalability of Active Directory\nis much greater than the workgroup.\n\n327\n00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:53.570\nAnd then the complexities\nof managing the workgroup.\n\n328\n00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:55.840\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\ncuz now let's take that same scenario and\n\n329\n00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.480\nput a domain controller in there.\n\n330\n00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.523\nAnd let's store all the accounts\nin the Active Directory database.\n\n331\n00:17:00.523 --> 00:17:03.620\nTen users, one domain controller,\nten computers, right?\n\n332\n00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.850\nHow many accounts am I managing now?\n\n333\n00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:11.620\nTen, because if my account is stored in\nActive Directory it doesn't matter what\n\n334\n00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:13.910\nmachine I go to to log on.\n\n335\n00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:16.683\nThey're all gonna be talking to the domain\ncontroller to verify my username\n\n336\n00:17:16.683 --> 00:17:17.259\nand password.\n\n337\n00:17:17.259 --> 00:17:21.032\nSo I can go to any machine that I\nhave the rights to log onto, and\n\n338\n00:17:21.032 --> 00:17:24.819\nI can log on with that one account\nstored in Active Directory.\n\n339\n00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:27.690\nA thousand users, 5,000 computers.\n\n340\n00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:31.765\nStill only dealing with a thousand counts,\nright?\n\n341\n00:17:31.765 --> 00:17:33.875\nNot, I didn't wanna do that math,\nyou have to multiply that out.\n\n342\n00:17:33.875 --> 00:17:36.000\n[LAUGH] Five million some, yeah.\n\n343\n00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:36.990\nYou get the idea.\n\n344\n00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:40.940\nActive directory it gives us that\nsingle sign on and scalability.\n\n345\n00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:44.950\nSee we kind of circled back around to\nthat original thought we had in part one.\n\n346\n00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:46.580\nThis is what single sign on is all about.\n\n347\n00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:53.111\nThis is one of the big benefits of Active\nDirectory and centralized administration.\n\n348\n00:17:53.111 --> 00:17:56.964\nSo local user accounts\nare great in a small shop, and\n\n349\n00:17:56.964 --> 00:18:02.520\neven if my computer is part of the domain\nit still has a local SAM file.\n\n350\n00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.730\nAnd it still has a local account\non there that I can use to log on.\n\n351\n00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:09.426\nBut if I go to work and\nI plug my computer into the network, and\n\n352\n00:18:09.426 --> 00:18:11.880\nI log on with a local account.\n\n353\n00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.809\nI'm not gonna be able to access\nany resources on the work network,\n\n354\n00:18:14.809 --> 00:18:17.497\nbecause the local account is\nonly good on the local machine.\n\n355\n00:18:17.497 --> 00:18:21.284\nSo even though it's there, and I might use\nit when I'm away from the work network.\n\n356\n00:18:21.284 --> 00:18:22.382\nWhen I get to work,\n\n357\n00:18:22.382 --> 00:18:27.570\nI'm gonna log on with my domain account\nwhich is not stored on the local machine.\n\n358\n00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:31.210\nDomain user accounts are stored\nin Active Directory database.\n\n359\n00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:34.840\nThat's what gives us that\ncentralized authentication process.\n\n360\n00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.700\nBecause now when I go to log on,\n\n361\n00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:40.790\nmy computer's not looking at it's own\nhard drive and SAM file for that account.\n\n362\n00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:42.790\nIt's just gonna say, you wanna log on?\n\n363\n00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:45.800\nHold on a second, and it goes on and\ntalks to the domain controller.\n\n364\n00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:49.290\nThe domain controller has the database\nwith all the users in there, so\n\n365\n00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:52.510\nit can look me up, it can see if I\ntyped in the right password, and\n\n366\n00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:56.415\nit can send that TGT back to my laptop and\nsay, yes, let him log on.\n\n367\n00:18:56.415 --> 00:18:58.235\nHe did type in the right password.\n\n368\n00:18:58.235 --> 00:19:01.535\nAnd I can go to any machine,\nand that process can occur.\n\n369\n00:19:01.535 --> 00:19:05.255\n&gt;&gt; And then that Mike, I was going to say,\nis that where we tie in that Kerberos and\n\n370\n00:19:05.255 --> 00:19:08.555\nthat single sign on benefit when\nyou log in against the domain?\n\n371\n00:19:08.555 --> 00:19:09.455\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n372\n00:19:09.455 --> 00:19:12.245\nThat's exactly what it does, right?\n\n373\n00:19:12.245 --> 00:19:17.110\nNow as I said domain users are stored in\nthe Active Directory database which is\n\n374\n00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:18.960\nstored on our domain controllers.\n\n375\n00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.550\nGives me access to\nresources in the domain,\n\n376\n00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:26.430\nwhereas the local account only gave me\naccess to resources on this one machine.\n\n377\n00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:30.900\nMy domain account gives me access to\nresources anywhere in the domain,\n\n378\n00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.360\nthat I've been given permissions.\n\n379\n00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:38.570\nBecause every computer that belongs to\nthe domain trusts the domain controller.\n\n380\n00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:40.920\nAnd the domain controller's\nwhat authenticated me, and\n\n381\n00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.720\ngave me that ticket-granting ticket.\n\n382\n00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.390\nIt's just like if we go\nback to the carnival.\n\n383\n00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:48.830\nWhen I get that arm band at the front\ngate, I can go to any one of those rides.\n\n384\n00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:52.840\nEvery single one of those rides will\nrecognize the color arm band, and they\n\n385\n00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:56.510\nknow that was issued by the front gate and\nthey'll allow me to ride the ride.\n\n386\n00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:58.300\nThere's no question, right?\n\n387\n00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.580\nIt's the same thing with\nthese user accounts,\n\n388\n00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:03.240\nbecause I've authenticated\nwith the domain controller.\n\n389\n00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:07.330\nWhen I go to talk to that file server or\nthat share on Wes's computer.\n\n390\n00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:08.680\nThey don't have to reauthenticate me.\n\n391\n00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.200\nIt trusts that Active Directory\nalready did its job,\n\n392\n00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:15.870\nand I wouldn't have a TGT if I hadn't\nalready authenticated successfully.\n\n393\n00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:17.025\nSo it just lets me, right?\n\n394\n00:20:17.025 --> 00:20:20.770\nThat's what gives me that,\nagain single sign on process.\n\n395\n00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:24.180\nNow there's a domain admin account\nthat's created by default,\n\n396\n00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.107\nwhen you install Active Directory.\n\n397\n00:20:26.107 --> 00:20:28.873\nThere's actually several groups in\na couple of different accounts, but\n\n398\n00:20:28.873 --> 00:20:31.810\nthe one they're going to call\nout here is the domain admin.\n\n399\n00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:35.800\nAnd the domain admin is much like\nthe administrator on your local machine.\n\n400\n00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:40.060\nThe domain administrator has full\ncontrol over active directory,\n\n401\n00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:44.160\nthe entire domain and\nevery machine that's part of the domain.\n\n402\n00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.070\nWhen you join a computer to the domain.\n\n403\n00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:49.130\nWhen you say, hey this computer\nis now part of my work network,\n\n404\n00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:50.770\nit's gonna be part of the domain.\n\n405\n00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:54.240\nWhat happens to the domain admin's\ngroup from Active Directory\n\n406\n00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.510\nis added to the local\nadministrator's group.\n\n407\n00:20:56.510 --> 00:21:00.850\nSo domain admins are administrators for\neverything in your domain.\n\n408\n00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:02.110\nThey are like the Uber account or\n\n409\n00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:06.390\nthe super user of\nthe Windows Active Directory world.\n\n410\n00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:09.525\nNow when we create new user\naccounts as we hire employees, or\n\n411\n00:21:09.525 --> 00:21:13.765\nif we're setting up users for the first\ntime, we'll go into Active Directory and\n\n412\n00:21:13.765 --> 00:21:17.709\nit's a little wizard or we can use\nPowerShell to do it from the command line.\n\n413\n00:21:17.709 --> 00:21:19.590\nWe have to provide certain information.\n\n414\n00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:24.404\nThe basic information, first name,\nlast name, and log on name, right?\n\n415\n00:21:24.404 --> 00:21:27.300\nAnd I have to provide that information.\n\n416\n00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.430\nReally need a password as well,\n\n417\n00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:34.310\nbecause if you create an account without a\npassword, it will be disabled by default.\n\n418\n00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:37.480\nIt will not let you enable the account\nuntil the password is set.\n\n419\n00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:42.520\nNormally we set up a generic password\nlike, let's just say I hired Wes today.\n\n420\n00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:46.100\nI'll go in, I'll create his account,\nI'll set up a generic password.\n\n421\n00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:49.370\nWhen Wes comes in for\nhis employee introduction and\n\n422\n00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:53.970\nall that good stuff we'll say, Wes here's\nyour account name, here's your password.\n\n423\n00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:55.120\nGo ahead and log in.\n\n424\n00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:58.247\nWhen he logs in it's gonna say,\nhey you need to change your password.\n\n425\n00:21:58.247 --> 00:22:01.230\nAnd Wes will change the password\nto something only he knows.\n\n426\n00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:04.200\nAnd from then on that will be his account.\n\n427\n00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:06.660\nWhat else about users?\n\n428\n00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.060\nAnd the ones you created,\n\n429\n00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:11.980\nthere's several additional properties\nwe can configure with user accounts.\n\n430\n00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:15.540\nLet's take a look at my screen here,\nand then let's go down to sales.\n\n431\n00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:18.820\nAnd I'm gonna make a new user,\nI'll zoom back in over here and\n\n432\n00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:21.040\nI'm gonna click on my new user button.\n\n433\n00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:25.930\nI could just as easily right click on\nthe sales overview and choose new user.\n\n434\n00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:27.000\nIn fact, I'll go ahead and do that.\n\n435\n00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.010\nIf I can scroll down to it\nwithout scrolling too far.\n\n436\n00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:34.280\nAnd that's gonna start my little wizard,\nwhere I can provide it a first name,\n\n437\n00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:38.220\nWes, last name, Bryan.\n\n438\n00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.920\nUser logon name maybe I'll say Wes, right?\n\n439\n00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.960\nAnd we're not going to get into\ntoo much of the other details.\n\n440\n00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.390\nCheck out my Active Directory episodes for\nthat.\n\n441\n00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:49.793\nThe user log on name has to\nbe unique within the domain.\n\n442\n00:22:49.793 --> 00:22:52.720\nThere can only be one wes@lab.itpro.tv.\n\n443\n00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:57.580\nIt has to be unique otherwise it\nwouldn't know who was trying to log on.\n\n444\n00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:02.150\nYour organization will use some naming\nconvention like first initial, last name.\n\n445\n00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:03.470\nHere I just use Wes.\n\n446\n00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:05.950\nThat would be great in a small business,\nbut\n\n447\n00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:08.050\nif we get too big there's\ngonna be more than one Wes.\n\n448\n00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:10.190\nThere's always more than one Mike, right?\n\n449\n00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:11.400\nI'm not very unique.\n\n450\n00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.790\nSo we need a different naming convention.\n\n451\n00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:17.890\nI might have to do something like,\nWbryan, right?\n\n452\n00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:20.920\nThat's most likely gonna be a little\nbit more unique, or maybe I need to\n\n453\n00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.620\nadd a middle initial or something like\nthat, whatever your company decides.\n\n454\n00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:26.050\nSo I'll click Next.\n\n455\n00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:28.640\nI'll provide a super secret password.\n\n456\n00:23:30.673 --> 00:23:35.530\nAnd you can see by default, this says\nuser must change password at next login.\n\n457\n00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:37.472\nSo when Wes logs in for the first time,\n\n458\n00:23:37.472 --> 00:23:41.710\nhe's gonna set the password to something\nthat as an administrator I created his\n\n459\n00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:45.530\naccount, I shouldn't know\nwhat his password is, right?\n\n460\n00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:49.410\nAnd I'll click Next and Finish.\n\n461\n00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:52.210\nAnd now there's an account for\nWes, now let's see if it works.\n\n462\n00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:54.250\nI'm gonna jump over to\na different machine,\n\n463\n00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:56.330\nI just created that account, right?\n\n464\n00:23:56.330 --> 00:24:01.315\nI'm gonna log off on my\nlittle client machine here,\n\n465\n00:24:01.315 --> 00:24:04.044\nwhich is part of the domain.\n\n466\n00:24:04.044 --> 00:24:07.917\nSo this client is a domain member.\n\n467\n00:24:07.917 --> 00:24:09.752\nI'm gonna do Other user.\n\n468\n00:24:09.752 --> 00:24:15.120\nI'm gonna log in as Wes with\nthat super secret password.\n\n469\n00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.331\nIt's password.\n\n470\n00:24:17.331 --> 00:24:18.916\nAnd it tells me that's not correct.\n\n471\n00:24:18.916 --> 00:24:20.304\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or apparently it's not.\n\n472\n00:24:20.304 --> 00:24:22.580\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, or not.\n\n473\n00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:23.700\nI had to type it twice.\n\n474\n00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.842\nSo wow, you know what?\n\n475\n00:24:25.842 --> 00:24:27.895\nI changed your username, right?\n\n476\n00:24:27.895 --> 00:24:34.240\nInstead of Wes, we did wesbrian for\nuniqueness, that's what it was.\n\n477\n00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.670\nAnd there we go,\nthe user's password must be changed.\n\n478\n00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:38.880\nI can't zoom in during a log on process.\n\n479\n00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.590\nThe user's password must be\nchanged before signing in.\n\n480\n00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:43.000\nWes clicks Okay.\n\n481\n00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:50.569\nHe types in his new password, which is\ngoing to be another variation of password.\n\n482\n00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:54.169\nI'll click next.\n\n483\n00:24:54.169 --> 00:24:55.954\nAnd now it's gonna go,\nYour password has been changed.\n\n484\n00:24:59.794 --> 00:25:02.746\nThere it goes, a little extra click there,\nthank you, Windows 10.\n\n485\n00:25:02.746 --> 00:25:04.330\nAnd now it's gonna setup his profile,\n\n486\n00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:06.920\nbecause he's never logged\nonto this computer before.\n\n487\n00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:10.220\nBut that just goes to show you\nhow those domain accounts work.\n\n488\n00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:12.100\nThey're stored in a central location.\n\n489\n00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:15.470\nAnd Wes can go to any machine and\nauthenticate, cuz\n\n490\n00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:19.130\nit reaches out to the domain controller\nand says, is their account named wbrian?\n\n491\n00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:19.860\nGreat.\n\n492\n00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:21.900\nIs this the right password for\nthat account?\n\n493\n00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.030\nIt is?\nPerfect let's let him log on.\n\n494\n00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:25.520\nHere's your ticket granting ticket.\n\n495\n00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.940\nHere's a session ticket to allow\nyou to log onto your work machine.\n\n496\n00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:33.650\nAnd there we go,\nI am now authenticated as Wes,\n\n497\n00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:36.790\nwhich I thought used to show up on the top\nof my Start menu, but that's okay.\n\n498\n00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:40.060\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, I know that I'm\nsitting here looking at the clock.\n\n499\n00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:42.370\nAnd I'm looking at our list, and\nI know we've got a lot more to go.\n\n500\n00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:43.730\nBut we do have a little bit of time.\n\n501\n00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:45.000\nYou've mentioned the term machine.\n\n502\n00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.417\nCan you tell us a little\nabout the computers?\n\n503\n00:25:46.417 --> 00:25:48.277\nOr do you wanna save\nthat until the next one?\n\n504\n00:25:48.277 --> 00:25:49.870\n&gt;&gt; No, no, let's go ahead and\ndo that one, too.\n\n505\n00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:51.890\nCuz these are pretty straightforward.\n\n506\n00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:54.090\nWe've already talked about user accounts.\n\n507\n00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:56.210\nLet me flip back over to\nmy domain controller.\n\n508\n00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:59.840\nComputers have accounts in\nActive Directory as well.\n\n509\n00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.580\nAnd you might think,\nwow, that's kinda odd.\n\n510\n00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:04.380\nWhy would a computer need an account?\n\n511\n00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:08.510\nThink back to when we talked about\npermissions, and we talked about\n\n512\n00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:12.770\nthe triple A, right, authentication,\nauthorization, and accounting?\n\n513\n00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:17.430\nWell, if a computer doesn't have\nan account then I cannot authenticate that\n\n514\n00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:18.657\ncomputer, right?\n\n515\n00:26:18.657 --> 00:26:21.658\nThat means you can just bring any\ncomputer you want in off the street,\n\n516\n00:26:21.658 --> 00:26:25.060\nplug it into my network and\nattempt to authenticate to my domain.\n\n517\n00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:28.300\nI do not want users bringing\njust any old computer in and\n\n518\n00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:29.410\nplugging it into my network.\n\n519\n00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:31.150\nI need to manage those computers.\n\n520\n00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:33.014\nSo computers must authenticate.\n\n521\n00:26:33.014 --> 00:26:36.806\nA lot of people don't realize this,\nwhen you turn a computer on at work,\n\n522\n00:26:36.806 --> 00:26:40.907\nwhen you get to work in the morning and\nyou turn your computer on, before you see\n\n523\n00:26:40.907 --> 00:26:45.520\nthe log on dialog box, your computer's\nactually logging in in the background.\n\n524\n00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:48.400\nIt's talking to Active Directory and\nsaying, hey,\n\n525\n00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.417\nmy name's client laptop 22 and\nhere's my password.\n\n526\n00:26:51.417 --> 00:26:53.840\nThat's right,\ncomputers have passwords, too.\n\n527\n00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.040\nWe don't see them.\n\n528\n00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.330\nActive Directory and\nthe computer manage it.\n\n529\n00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:00.400\nThey change it every so\noften just like a user account would.\n\n530\n00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.770\nIt's just all automated and\ndone behind the scenes.\n\n531\n00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:06.410\nSo yeah, computers have accounts in Active\nDirectory so that they can authenticate.\n\n532\n00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:09.134\nAlso, so that we can authorize, right?\n\n533\n00:27:09.134 --> 00:27:12.852\nWhat if that computer shouldn't be\nallowed to connect to certain resources,\n\n534\n00:27:12.852 --> 00:27:14.570\nlike the R&amp;D database?\n\n535\n00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:17.610\nWell, that marketing\ncomputer has no business\n\n536\n00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:19.930\nlooking at the stuff in that R&amp;D database.\n\n537\n00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:24.182\nBecause the computer has an account\nI could then go to that resource and\n\n538\n00:27:24.182 --> 00:27:25.198\ndeny it access.\n\n539\n00:27:25.198 --> 00:27:28.180\nIf the computer didn't have an account\nthen I couldn't deny that computer access\n\n540\n00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:29.550\nto that resource.\n\n541\n00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:34.340\nAnd auditing, what if I wanna know,\nhey, who changed this file and\n\n542\n00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:35.990\nfrom where did they change it?\n\n543\n00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.770\nWell, I can look at auditing.\n\n544\n00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:38.970\nRemember auditing, we haven't\ndone an episode on auditing yet.\n\n545\n00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:42.030\nWe're gonna do a whole episode\non auditing coming up.\n\n546\n00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:46.260\nBut auditing is keeping track\nof who did what when and where.\n\n547\n00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:47.043\nJust not the why.\n\n548\n00:27:47.043 --> 00:27:49.180\nThat's something we have to ask.\n\n549\n00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:54.452\nBut let's say I wanna see who made\na change to a particular file.\n\n550\n00:27:54.452 --> 00:28:00.590\nWell, when I'm auditing I can say, look,\nWes Brian, at 10:42 AM, deleted this file.\n\n551\n00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:03.570\nBecause the computer has an account,\n\n552\n00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:07.520\nI can also see what machine he was\nsitting at when he did it, right?\n\n553\n00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.100\nSo I can trace all of that back.\n\n554\n00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:13.366\nAnd so computers have accounts so\nwe can do that authorization,\n\n555\n00:28:13.366 --> 00:28:17.714\nthe authentication, the authorization,\nand the accounting.\n\n556\n00:28:17.714 --> 00:28:22.320\nAnd so we can apply group policy to them,\nand we apply settings to them.\n\n557\n00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:25.283\nIf we take look at my screen here,\nI'll go ahead and create one.\n\n558\n00:28:25.283 --> 00:28:27.743\nLet me save, let's just do,\nI'll do it the right way.\n\n559\n00:28:27.743 --> 00:28:29.840\nI'll create a new organizational unit.\n\n560\n00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.667\nWe'll say new OU.\n\n561\n00:28:32.667 --> 00:28:37.170\nI'll call this client, clients.\n\n562\n00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:41.450\nAnd then what I really should do is\ntake that client 01 computer account and\n\n563\n00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:42.760\nmove it to that clients OU.\n\n564\n00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:47.620\nWe'll talk about those warnings and\nthings in a future episode or\n\n565\n00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:50.870\nin another series altogether\nwhen we get into more depth.\n\n566\n00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:53.576\nBut here is the account for that client,\n\n567\n00:28:53.576 --> 00:28:56.846\nthe one that I just logged\non with Wes' account.\n\n568\n00:28:56.846 --> 00:29:01.005\nAnd I can see it has certain properties,\nlike its name, what operating system,\n\n569\n00:29:01.005 --> 00:29:05.380\nwhether or not it's a member of groups,\nand groups are coming up in a minute.\n\n570\n00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:10.190\nWe can delegate control, who it's\nmanaged by, where it's supposed to be.\n\n571\n00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:13.970\nHey, that laptop belongs to\nthe New York office, things like that.\n\n572\n00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:15.790\nNot nearly as many properties.\n\n573\n00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:19.500\nOne thing I didn't show you\nwas a user account properties.\n\n574\n00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:23.160\nWe look at this and look at all\nthe different tabs on here, all right?\n\n575\n00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:27.445\nSo now, with a user account, remember I\nsaid you just need first name, last name,\n\n576\n00:29:27.445 --> 00:29:28.131\nlog on name?\n\n577\n00:29:28.131 --> 00:29:32.052\nWell, once you actually create it,\nyou can go back and fill in all this other\n\n578\n00:29:32.052 --> 00:29:36.286\ninformation, Description, Office,\nTelephone Number, Addresses, Account\n\n579\n00:29:36.286 --> 00:29:41.160\ninformation, Telephones, Organization,\nand the list goes on, and on, and on.\n\n580\n00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:45.900\nAnd the more information I fill out, the\neasier it is to work with these objects.\n\n581\n00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:50.770\nBecause let's say I wanna see all the user\naccounts that are managed by Tim Broom.\n\n582\n00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:53.751\nWell, if I haven't filled that\ninformation out in Active Directory,\n\n583\n00:29:53.751 --> 00:29:55.054\nhow am I gonna find it, right?\n\n584\n00:29:55.054 --> 00:29:59.440\nWhat if I wanna see all the computers\nthat belong to the sales department?\n\n585\n00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.050\nAgain, if I haven't gone back in and\n\n586\n00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:02.880\nfilled the information\nin Active Directory,\n\n587\n00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.600\nit's gonna be very difficult\nto determine that.\n\n588\n00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:08.281\nSo the more of those properties we\ncan fill in, both user accounts and\n\n589\n00:30:08.281 --> 00:30:11.905\ncomputer accounts, the better off\nwe're gonna be in the long run.\n\n590\n00:30:11.905 --> 00:30:14.805\n&gt;&gt; Lot of great information,\nMike, on Active Directory.\n\n591\n00:30:14.805 --> 00:30:17.105\nAnd keep in mind, guys,\nwe're just scratching the surface.\n\n592\n00:30:17.105 --> 00:30:19.205\nWe've got more to go when it\ncomes to Active Directory,\n\n593\n00:30:19.205 --> 00:30:20.955\nand Mike's already mentioned it.\n\n594\n00:30:20.955 --> 00:30:23.765\nHere in the MTA, we're just kinda\ngiving you the high-level overview.\n\n595\n00:30:23.765 --> 00:30:28.365\nIf you want a lot more information,\ndefinitely get going over to Mike's\n\n596\n00:30:28.365 --> 00:30:31.475\nepisodes where they really pull\nthe pieces off the engine and\n\n597\n00:30:31.475 --> 00:30:34.615\nthey look at all the different components\nwith Active Directory more in depth.\n\n598\n00:30:34.615 --> 00:30:37.330\nHowever, for this one,\nwe are gonna have to sign off here.\n\n599\n00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:38.840\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n600\n00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:39.610\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n601\n00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:41.818\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n602\n00:30:41.818 --> 00:30:47.829\n[MUSIC]\n\n603\n00:30:47.829 --> 00:30:50.300\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

ITPROTV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.015 --> 00:00:15.215\n&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome back to another\ngreat episode here on ITPROTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:18.038\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and\ntoday's episode,\n\n5\n00:00:18.038 --> 00:00:23.131\nwe're continuing through our series in\nthe MTA 98367 Security Fundamentals.\n\n6\n00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:26.093\nI'm coming back with a part three\non Active Directory permissions and\n\n7\n00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:27.761\nit's none other than Mr Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:28.739\nMike how are you doing, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:31.133\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great and\nwe really have to part three already?\n\n10\n00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:31.761\n&gt;&gt; Mini series.\n\n11\n00:00:31.761 --> 00:00:33.200\n&gt;&gt; A little mini series, I like it.\n\n12\n00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.200\nWell yes, so yes I'm glad to be back,\nexcited to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.140\n&gt;&gt; Love out MTA, love Active Directory,\none of my favorite topics to talk about.\n\n14\n00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.620\nYou might have been able to tell, right?\n\n15\n00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.310\n[LAUGH] We left off getting ready, we\ntalked about Active Directory itself and\n\n16\n00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.350\nwhat it was, and why we like it.\n\n17\n00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.640\nWe talked about objects that we might find\nin Active Directory like computer accounts\n\n18\n00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.650\nand user accounts.\n\n19\n00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.910\nNow, I wanna talk about another object\nthat we'll find in Active Directory.\n\n20\n00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.070\nVery, very useful object and\nthat is groups.\n\n21\n00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.900\nGroups will be your second best friend.\n\n22\n00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.150\nActive Directory's your first best friend,\ngroups would probably be second.\n\n23\n00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.170\nWe've talked a lot about permissions and\nwe've talked about how every resource and\n\n24\n00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.080\non an NTFS partition has\nan access control list.\n\n25\n00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.960\nAnd I can add user accounts, or\nACEs, access control entries and\n\n26\n00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.590\nI can control what permissions\nthey have or don't have, right.\n\n27\n00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.300\nI can allow or deny permissions\nover each one of those resources.\n\n28\n00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.220\nAnd it seems great and it is great.\n\n29\n00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.770\nWe love NTFS and we love permissions.\n\n30\n00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.200\nBut, we've only talked about it\non a very small scale, right.\n\n31\n00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.210\nTaking one user and\nadded it to a resource and allowed or\n\n32\n00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.530\ndenied them some permission and\nsaid woo-hoo.\n\n33\n00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.390\nThe problem is when you get into\nan Active Directory environment,\n\n34\n00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.035\nwe are gonna have more than just\na couple of objects, right.\n\n35\n00:01:54.035 --> 00:01:59.100\n[COUGH] We said Active Directory can scale\nup to hundreds of thousands of objects.\n\n36\n00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.690\nWell, now imagine that you\nhave 175 sales people.\n\n37\n00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.590\nAnd here's a new resource, that somebody\ncreated, and I now need to give read,\n\n38\n00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.830\nwrite access to all 175 sales people.\n\n39\n00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.590\nSo, I open up the access control list,\nand one at a time I click add, find, and\n\n40\n00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.950\nI find each user account and\nI add them and I give them a permission.\n\n41\n00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.590\nDoes that sound like\nsomething we wanna do?\n\n42\n00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.200\n&gt;&gt; No it does not.\n\n43\n00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.430\nThe only thing I can think of is this is\nlike running contrary to why you would\n\n44\n00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.290\neven use Active Directory to begin with.\n\n45\n00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.920\n&gt;&gt; It really does.\n\n46\n00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.050\nWe said it was going to\nsimplify administration,\n\n47\n00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.310\nnot make things more difficult and\nit will, if we use it in the right way.\n\n48\n00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.880\nSo we will use Groups.\n\n49\n00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.357\nGroups are going to allow us to\ncollect up all 175 of those sales\n\n50\n00:02:42.357 --> 00:02:47.890\npeople that need that same permission, and\nI can put all those people in a group.\n\n51\n00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.710\nAnd then I cannot add the people to\nthe access control list, not the user\n\n52\n00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:57.280\naccounts, but I can add the group itself\nto the access control list one time.\n\n53\n00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.780\nAnd I can assign\nthe permission to that group.\n\n54\n00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.180\nRead and write over this particular file.\n\n55\n00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.160\nNow, everybody in that group\nwill pick up those permissions,\n\n56\n00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.890\nbecause they're a member of that group.\n\n57\n00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.460\nAnybody that belongs to the group will get\nany permissions assigned to that group.\n\n58\n00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.440\nSo right then and there,\nit simplifies everything, right?\n\n59\n00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.629\nCuz I had to do it once\ninstead of 175 times.\n\n60\n00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.261\nNow, imagine tomorrow we hire\nfive new people in sales.\n\n61\n00:03:24.261 --> 00:03:28.325\nInstead of having to go back to that\nresource and add each one of those people\n\n62\n00:03:28.325 --> 00:03:31.746\nand then add their permissions\nto their access control entry,\n\n63\n00:03:31.746 --> 00:03:35.120\nI can just add those those\nfive accounts to the group.\n\n64\n00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.260\nThe group's already in the access\ncontrol list from before,\n\n65\n00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.710\nit already has it's permissions.\n\n66\n00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.020\nAs soon as I add them to the group,\nthey get the permissions.\n\n67\n00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.920\nThree of those people leave sales and\n\n68\n00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.620\nthey go to HR,\nthey don't need those permissions anymore.\n\n69\n00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.350\nI don't have to go back and\nmodify the access control list and\n\n70\n00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.030\ntake them out,\nI just pull them out of the group.\n\n71\n00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.890\nThey're no longer a member of the group,\n\n72\n00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.900\nthey no longer get the permissions\nthat are assigned to the group.\n\n73\n00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.630\nSo by using groups,\nwe can greatly simplify\n\n74\n00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.290\nthe administration of permissions\nwithin NTFS, also within the registry.\n\n75\n00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.290\nRight, I can use those groups\nin the registry permissions.\n\n76\n00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.979\nI can also use those groups when\nI am delegating permissions\n\n77\n00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:14.720\nin Active Directory, which we're\ngonna come to in just a little bit.\n\n78\n00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.590\nSo, groups allow me to simplify the\nadministration of permissions and rights.\n\n79\n00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.980\n&gt;&gt; And when we get started with groups,\nMike, do I understand this right,\n\n80\n00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.310\nthat we've got a couple different flavors?\n\n81\n00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.900\nWhen it comes to assigning permissions,\nwe've got to make the right choice.\n\n82\n00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.085\nHence we've got a couple of different\ntypes of flavors of groups, right?\n\n83\n00:04:30.085 --> 00:04:30.630\n&gt;&gt; We do.\n\n84\n00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.770\nLet's take a look at my screen.\n\n85\n00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.740\nI've got my domain controller opened up\nand I'm gonna real quick make an OU and\n\n86\n00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.750\nthen I'll zoom in here.\n\n87\n00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.500\nI'm gonna do new organizational unit.\n\n88\n00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.995\nI'll call it groups and\nthen within that group OU,\n\n89\n00:04:43.995 --> 00:04:47.670\nI'm gonna go up here at the top or\nI could right click.\n\n90\n00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.410\nI'm gonna click my new group button and\nI'm gonna call it something like\n\n91\n00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.060\nSales users, all right?\n\n92\n00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.690\nAnd when I create this group I've got\ntwo things that I've got to decide\n\n93\n00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.415\nbesides the names, so really three.\n\n94\n00:05:02.415 --> 00:05:05.120\n[LAUGH] You've got the group itself,\nwhat you're gonna call it?\n\n95\n00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.330\nAnd you wanna name, well, I'll come back\nto that because different groups are gonna\n\n96\n00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.820\nhave different naming conventions.\n\n97\n00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.510\nFor right now I just wanna\ntalk about the group type.\n\n98\n00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.460\nWe'll talk about the group\nscope in just a second.\n\n99\n00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.920\nSo two group types, one is security,\none is distribution.\n\n100\n00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.100\nWhen we look at objects\nin Active Directory,\n\n101\n00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:28.190\nany object that I create that\ngets what's known as an SID or\n\n102\n00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.750\na security identifier is known\nas a security principle.\n\n103\n00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.700\nThis is a unique number\nthat identifies an object.\n\n104\n00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.210\nWhen you create a new user account,\na number is generated\n\n105\n00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.470\nthat is unique to that domain and\nit's assigned to that object.\n\n106\n00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.360\nAnd technically, behind the scenes\nthat's how Active Directory knows that\n\n107\n00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.550\nuser account, it's by the number, by that\nSID that's generated, not the username.\n\n108\n00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.210\nAnd this is a good thing,\nbecause names can change, right?\n\n109\n00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.200\nWes might change his name.\n\n110\n00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.000\nHe wants to be the edutainor\nformerly known as Wes or\n\n111\n00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.050\nI can go into his user account in Active\nDirectory, and I can change his name,\n\n112\n00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.140\nthat doesn't change the SID, the unique\nnumber that's assigned to his account.\n\n113\n00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.632\nAnd so all those places that\nI've used his user account,\n\n114\n00:06:15.632 --> 00:06:17.814\nany place I've added it to groups or\n\n115\n00:06:17.814 --> 00:06:22.900\nadded to his access control list none of\nthat changes, cuz the SID never changes.\n\n116\n00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.690\nI can change his name, his first name,\nhis last name I can change his department,\n\n117\n00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.760\nI can change all those\nother attributes but\n\n118\n00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.630\nthe SID will always uniquely\nidentify that account.\n\n119\n00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:38.020\nAnd anything that has an SID can\nbe used to control permissions.\n\n120\n00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.070\nThat's why I'm allowed to add a user\naccount to an access control list,\n\n121\n00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.550\ncuz there's and SID associated with it.\n\n122\n00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.710\nA security group has an SID.\n\n123\n00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:52.840\nWhen I create this group, when I click OK,\nWindows is gonna generate a unique SID and\n\n124\n00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.190\nassign it to this group called Salesusers.\n\n125\n00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.760\nAnd it will forever be attached to this\ngroup and those numbers are never used.\n\n126\n00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.860\nIf I delete this group and\n\n127\n00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.910\nthen recreate it with the exact same\nname it will have a brand new SID.\n\n128\n00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:10.540\nThis is actually very important when it\ncomes to user accounts probably a little\n\n129\n00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.030\nbit beyond what we need to know for\nthis exam but let's talk about it anyway.\n\n130\n00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.380\nI just said that the SID never changes,\nright?\n\n131\n00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.880\nAnd so I can change a person's name,\n\n132\n00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.710\naddress, phone numbers,\nthe SID never changes.\n\n133\n00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.180\nI add Wes, so let's use Wes as an example.\n\n134\n00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.980\nI add his account to\nfive different groups.\n\n135\n00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.600\nIf I change his name,\nhis account is still in those five groups.\n\n136\n00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.690\nThat if I delete his account and then go,\noops I wasn't supposed to do that and\n\n137\n00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:39.780\nI recreate his account with same name,\nfirst name, last name,\n\n138\n00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.450\nhoping nobody will notice.\n\n139\n00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:44.466\nThe problem is SID's are never reused.\n\n140\n00:07:44.466 --> 00:07:48.302\nSo once I deleted that first Wes\naccount that SID is thrown away and\n\n141\n00:07:48.302 --> 00:07:52.625\nwhen I create a new Wes account, even\nthough it looks exactly the same to us\n\n142\n00:07:52.625 --> 00:07:55.027\nit has a brand new SID in the background.\n\n143\n00:07:55.027 --> 00:07:58.822\nIt will no longer belong to any of\nthose groups and so Wes logs in and\n\n144\n00:07:58.822 --> 00:08:02.283\ntries to access resources that\nhe's always had access to.\n\n145\n00:08:02.283 --> 00:08:03.566\nAnd he won't get access.\n\n146\n00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:07.210\nAnd now I'm gonna have to fess up and\nsay, yeah, I deleted your account.\n\n147\n00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:07.910\nI recreated it.\n\n148\n00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.700\nI'm gonna have to go back and\nadd it to all those groups again.\n\n149\n00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.482\n&gt;&gt; Mike, is it fair to say that\nrecreating is not recovery?\n\n150\n00:08:13.482 --> 00:08:14.973\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So be very careful.\n\n151\n00:08:14.973 --> 00:08:18.140\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, so\nback to this group then.\n\n152\n00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:22.360\nThis is a security group,\nwhich means it will get an SID.\n\n153\n00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.820\nWhich means I can use this group for\nsecurity reasons.\n\n154\n00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.450\nI can add it to access control lists.\n\n155\n00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:31.360\nI can give the sales users group\npermissions over the sales folder.\n\n156\n00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.920\nOr the right to remote desktop into\na server, whatever the case may be.\n\n157\n00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:39.786\nSo security groups are used to\nassign permissions or rights.\n\n158\n00:08:39.786 --> 00:08:45.870\nDistribution groups do not get an SID,\ndoes not get one.\n\n159\n00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:49.120\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Mike, now, you just said, you\ntold us at the beginning that the whole\n\n160\n00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.900\npoint of groups is to assign\npermissions via an SSID.\n\n161\n00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.280\nOr, excuse me, an SID.\n\n162\n00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.182\nNot wireless, right?\n\n163\n00:08:55.182 --> 00:08:56.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; So that, to me,\n\n164\n00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:59.080\nwhat that says is that that's kinda\nlike throwing a rock at a tank.\n\n165\n00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.150\nIt doesn't make much sense.\n\n166\n00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.930\nWhat will we use a distribution group for?\n\n167\n00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:04.929\n&gt;&gt; I will tell you that I've\nmanaged active domains for\n\n168\n00:09:04.929 --> 00:09:09.028\nI dunno 15 years now and I've never\nreally had the need to create one.\n\n169\n00:09:09.028 --> 00:09:12.300\nBut they're there for\nnon-security reasons.\n\n170\n00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.521\nUsually distribution groups,\ntechnically, what they're designed for\n\n171\n00:09:15.521 --> 00:09:16.910\nare things like mailing lists.\n\n172\n00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:21.060\nSo we're going to go into, I guess I\nshouldn't say I've never used one, but\n\n173\n00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:24.010\nnot as often and I'll tell you why.\n\n174\n00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:26.170\nDistribution groups do not get an SID.\n\n175\n00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:28.320\nSo they cannot be used for\nsecurity purposes.\n\n176\n00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.720\nThey can only be used with email\napplications and for mailing.\n\n177\n00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.790\nIf I create a distribution group called\nsales users and I put all the sales people\n\n178\n00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:40.680\nin there, their user accounts in there,\nthen I could send an email\n\n179\n00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:45.410\nto the sales users distribution group and\nanybody in that group would get the email.\n\n180\n00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:48.360\nBut here's something\nwe should be aware of.\n\n181\n00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.960\nA security group can also be used for\nemail distribution.\n\n182\n00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:56.460\nI can email enable a security group\nbasically assign an email address to it\n\n183\n00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.210\nand accomplish the same thing.\n\n184\n00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:02.820\nSo security groups can be used for\npermissions and email distribution.\n\n185\n00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:07.030\nDistribution groups can only be used for\nemail distribution, cannot be used for\n\n186\n00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:09.180\nsecurity and\nthat's really what you need to remember.\n\n187\n00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.830\nSo there might be times when you\nwant to create a group that has\n\n188\n00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:14.010\ndifferent people in it.\n\n189\n00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:17.590\nSome people that are maybe CEOs,\nas well as the front desk people,\n\n190\n00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:19.250\nas well as contractors.\n\n191\n00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:23.890\nAnd you're never going to assign the same\npermission to the CEO, and the front desk,\n\n192\n00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:26.550\nand the contractor, so you want to\nmake sure that this group doesn't\n\n193\n00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:30.060\naccidentally get used on\nan access control list.\n\n194\n00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.500\nSo, you could use a distribution group.\n\n195\n00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.220\nThat way, there's no way somebody\ncould use it to assign permissions.\n\n196\n00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.670\nAll right, I'll go ahead and create\nmy security group, and I'll click OK.\n\n197\n00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:40.510\nAnd there we go, I've got a new group.\n\n198\n00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:43.020\nNow, groups have properties,\njust like user accounts, and\n\n199\n00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.740\njust like computer accounts.\n\n200\n00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.490\nYou can see the name I gave it.\n\n201\n00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:49.870\nI can go back in and change some of\nthis information once I created it.\n\n202\n00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:53.040\nIf I decided, hey, this needed to be\na distribution group I could go ahead and\n\n203\n00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.070\nchange that.\n\n204\n00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:58.680\nBut the main properties we're dealing\nwith groups is the Members tab.\n\n205\n00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.100\nWho is a member of this group?\n\n206\n00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:05.770\nI can simply click Add and I can find\nthe account that I'm looking for and\n\n207\n00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:07.140\nadd users to this group.\n\n208\n00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:11.730\nAnd let's add Wes in there, or\nit's actually Wes Bryan, isn't it?\n\n209\n00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:16.710\nYeah, so there I've added a couple\nof users to this group, all right?\n\n210\n00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:20.340\nSo now I can use the sales users\ngroup to assign permissions,\n\n211\n00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:24.170\nrather than individually to Mike and\nto Wes.\n\n212\n00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.576\nAll right?\n\n213\n00:11:25.576 --> 00:11:29.270\nNow, groups allow me to collect up users.\n\n214\n00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:31.630\nThey are just memberships' lists though.\n\n215\n00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:32.820\nThey're not containers.\n\n216\n00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:36.790\nAn OU, like this group's OU or\nthis client's OU.\n\n217\n00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:41.360\nThese are containers and\nan object can only be in one container.\n\n218\n00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.180\nThink about the files in your drawer.\n\n219\n00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:47.190\nIf you took a piece of paper, you can pick\nwhich folder you want to put it in, but\n\n220\n00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:50.760\nyou can't put that piece of paper in more\nthan one folder at the same time, right?\n\n221\n00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.790\nIt's one or the other.\n\n222\n00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:54.870\nYou can move it, but\nit can only be in one folder at a time.\n\n223\n00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:56.410\nIt's a single object.\n\n224\n00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:58.560\nContainers, that's the way they work.\n\n225\n00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.120\nThey can hold an object, but\nan object can only be in one container.\n\n226\n00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.220\nGroups are not container objects.\n\n227\n00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.060\nThey're membership lists.\n\n228\n00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:09.170\nAnd so\na user account can belong to one group,\n\n229\n00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:12.170\n100 groups,\n1,000 groups because it's a list.\n\n230\n00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:13.400\nIt's not a container.\n\n231\n00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.320\nJust like you can belong to In\nfact you probably already do.\n\n232\n00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.590\nYou ever looked at your spam folder,\nhow many mailing lists do you belong to,\n\n233\n00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:20.530\nall right.\n\n234\n00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.310\nIt's not just one,\nunfortunately it's dozens and dozens.\n\n235\n00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:26.590\nAnd it's the same thing with security\ngroups, because as an account,\n\n236\n00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:29.940\nyou might need to belong\nto more than one group.\n\n237\n00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:33.930\nIf you work at the IT help desk, right,\nyou probably in a group call help desk\n\n238\n00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:37.030\nthat gives you the permissions\nthat you need to do your job.\n\n239\n00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:42.520\nYou also might be in a group called, I'm\ntrying to see if I can do this on the fly.\n\n240\n00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:47.750\nYou might belong to another group like,\nI don't know,\n\n241\n00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:51.490\ndatabase users, so you could have\naccess to a particular database.\n\n242\n00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:53.720\nYou can belong to as many\ngroups as you need to and\n\n243\n00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:58.460\nyou get to add up all the permissions\nfrom all the groups that you belong to.\n\n244\n00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.160\nSo that's your group type.\n\n245\n00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.250\nThen we've gotta deal with group scope.\n\n246\n00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:07.425\nAnd now this is where it can\nget a little bit twisty.\n\n247\n00:13:07.425 --> 00:13:12.080\nWe're definitely not gonna go into it\nas deep as I do in some of our other\n\n248\n00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.390\ncertification tracks,\n\n249\n00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:17.270\nit's at the MT level, MTA level,\nwe've gotta have the basics down.\n\n250\n00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:20.210\nAnd so\nwe are gonna talk about these scopes and\n\n251\n00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:24.350\nreally there's three group scopes\nthat we want to deal with.\n\n252\n00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:29.860\nThere's domain local, there global and\nthere's universal, all right?\n\n253\n00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.140\nWhen we look at, and\nI'm just gonna right-click.\n\n254\n00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.050\nYou know what you don't have to\npull my screen just yet there.\n\n255\n00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:35.840\nLet me talk about them first.\n\n256\n00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.170\nWhen we talk about domain local groups,\ndomain local groups,\n\n257\n00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:41.070\nthey're local to the domain,\n\n258\n00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:45.260\nwhich gives you an idea that they\nreally are used within a single domain.\n\n259\n00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:49.030\nAnd we used domain local\ngroups to assign permissions.\n\n260\n00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.720\nDomain local groups are what we\nadd to the access control list.\n\n261\n00:13:54.720 --> 00:14:00.880\nSo if I've got a file and I wanna give\npeople access to the file, a read access,\n\n262\n00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:05.440\nI'll create a domain local group and I'll\ngive that domain local group read access.\n\n263\n00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.780\nIf I need to give everybody print\npermission over a particular printer,\n\n264\n00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:17.410\nI will create a domain local group called\nHP sales office black and white printer\n\n265\n00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:21.740\nand I'll give that group permission\nto print to that printer, all right.\n\n266\n00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.880\nI don't put people in there,\nno user accounts,\n\n267\n00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.440\nwe'll come back to that in a second.\n\n268\n00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.230\nBut domain local groups\ncreated in the domain\n\n269\n00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:31.065\nwith the resource that you\nwanna sign the permission to.\n\n270\n00:14:31.065 --> 00:14:35.060\nThey're used to assign permissions and\nrights and they are,\n\n271\n00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:40.730\nthey contain not user accounts but\nglobal groups and universal groups.\n\n272\n00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:43.800\nAnd I'll come back to that, like wait\nwhat the heck are you talking about.\n\n273\n00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.270\nLet's finish the three group scopes and\n\n274\n00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:49.020\nthen I'll show you how\nthis actually works.\n\n275\n00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:53.460\nGlobal groups, another group scope, when I\ngo to create a group, I get that choice,\n\n276\n00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:54.730\nthose radio buttons.\n\n277\n00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:58.620\nGlobal groups are what contain user\naccounts or computer accounts.\n\n278\n00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.700\nWe'll talk about them in the same way.\n\n279\n00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.480\nGlobal groups are used\nto collect up accounts\n\n280\n00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.380\nthat have the same access requirements.\n\n281\n00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:14.030\nSales people, if I have one sales person,\n20 sales people, 200 sales people.\n\n282\n00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:16.130\nThey all do the same job function.\n\n283\n00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:18.670\nThey all need access\nto the same resources.\n\n284\n00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:22.110\nSo rather than individually\nassigning permissions to 200 people\n\n285\n00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:25.460\nI create a global group\ncalled sales users and\n\n286\n00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:29.410\nI put all of the sales people's\nuser accounts in that group.\n\n287\n00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:33.450\nOr I create a global group\ncalled marketing laptops and\n\n288\n00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:37.270\nI put all the computer accounts for\nthe marketing laptops in there.\n\n289\n00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:43.300\nThat way I can treat the sales\nusers as a single unit, right.\n\n290\n00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.636\nI can treat the marketing\nlaptops as a single unit.\n\n291\n00:15:46.636 --> 00:15:51.695\nSo global groups are used\nto collect up objects\n\n292\n00:15:51.695 --> 00:15:57.154\nthat have the same access requirements,\nright.\n\n293\n00:15:57.154 --> 00:16:01.240\nThey're called global and that's\nbecause they're global to the domain.\n\n294\n00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:05.340\nIt really came about a little bit before\nwe've dealt with multiple domains a lot.\n\n295\n00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:08.090\nBecause you think global and\nyou might think everywhere but\n\n296\n00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:10.510\nreally it's global to the domain.\n\n297\n00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:13.490\nThen you do have universal groups and\nuniversal groups came out,\n\n298\n00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:18.560\nI wanna say 2003 is when we got\nintroduced to universal groups.\n\n299\n00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:23.410\nUniversal groups are used\nto collect up global groups\n\n300\n00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:27.480\nfrom multiple domains, all right?\n\n301\n00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.550\nCuz if I have two domains,\n\n302\n00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:34.110\nglobal groups can only contain\nmembers from the same domain.\n\n303\n00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:39.027\nAnother words if I had domain A and\nI create, let's say I have domain A and\n\n304\n00:16:39.027 --> 00:16:39.763\ndomain B.\n\n305\n00:16:39.763 --> 00:16:42.132\nIn domain A, there are sales users.\n\n306\n00:16:42.132 --> 00:16:45.050\nIn domain B, there are sales users.\n\n307\n00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:48.840\nIn domain A i create a group\ncalled domain A sales users and\n\n308\n00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.180\nI put all the sales users in there.\n\n309\n00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:55.450\nI cannot take the users from domain B,\nthe sales users from domain B and\n\n310\n00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:59.160\nput them in the same global group,\nbecause they aren't in the same domain.\n\n311\n00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.700\nYet I need a way to assign all sales\npeople, no matter where they are or\n\n312\n00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:03.990\nwhat domain they're in.\n\n313\n00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:06.110\nI need to assign them\nthe same permissions.\n\n314\n00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:08.050\nThat's where universal groups come in.\n\n315\n00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:12.900\nIn domain A I created a global\ngroup called domain A sales user.\n\n316\n00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:17.620\nIn domain B I create a global\ngroup called domain B sales users,\n\n317\n00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:21.160\nwhich contains all the sale\nuser accounts from domain B.\n\n318\n00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:25.510\nThen, I can create a universal\ngroup called all sales users.\n\n319\n00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:29.410\nAnd I can take the global group,\ndomain A sales users and\n\n320\n00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:31.920\nput it in the universal group\ncalled all sales users.\n\n321\n00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.330\nI can take the global group\ndomain B sales users and\n\n322\n00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:38.320\nI can put it in the all\nsales users universal group.\n\n323\n00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.820\nAnd now, I have a group that\ncontains all sales people\n\n324\n00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:44.800\nfrom both domain A and domain B.\n\n325\n00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:50.110\nSo universal groups are used to gather\nup global groups from multiple domains.\n\n326\n00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:56.980\nSo universal groups then really are only\nbeneficial If you have multiple domains.\n\n327\n00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:58.620\nIf you've got a single domain,\n\n328\n00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:03.090\nglobal groups are perfect you don't\nhave any need for universal groups.\n\n329\n00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:04.680\nBut if there is even an inkling,\n\n330\n00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:09.440\na thought that you might go to a second,\nor third, or fourth\n\n331\n00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:13.840\ndomain you might wanna include universal\ngroups in your strategy because otherwise,\n\n332\n00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.730\nyou have to go back and change everything\nwhich can be very, very tedious.\n\n333\n00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:20.185\nAll right now,\nwhen I talked about strategy.\n\n334\n00:18:20.185 --> 00:18:22.730\nLet;s take a look at my screen real quick.\n\n335\n00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:25.920\nWe're going to go back to groups,\nand when I created this group.\n\n336\n00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.770\nThat sales users groups.\n\n337\n00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:31.720\nNotice its a global,\nglobal groups are the default.\n\n338\n00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.370\nSo if you wanted the main local group, or\n\n339\n00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:37.770\nyou wanted the universal group, you\nneed to change that when you create it.\n\n340\n00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:42.050\nYou can come back and change it after\nthe fact but it can be limiting.\n\n341\n00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:45.470\nNotice on my screen,\nthat I can change this to universal but\n\n342\n00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:47.200\nI can't change it to domain local.\n\n343\n00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.600\nAnd that's because some of the rules\nthat are involved with what\n\n344\n00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.580\nglobal groups can contain, and\nwhat domain local groups can contain, and\n\n345\n00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:56.240\nwhat universal groups can contain.\n\n346\n00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.180\nSo just understand you can\nchange the scope after the fact.\n\n347\n00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.600\nBut sometimes it's a little bit limited.\n\n348\n00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:05.390\nBeyond the scope of this class, but\nI'll give you a funny little thing though.\n\n349\n00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:09.240\nI can't change a global to a domain local,\nit won't let me select that.\n\n350\n00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.690\nBut what I could do is change a global\nto a universal, and then go back and\n\n351\n00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:14.650\nchange a universal to a domain local.\n\n352\n00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:18.250\nSo I can get around it, but again,\nit has a lot to do with rules and\n\n353\n00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:19.250\nwhat's in the group.\n\n354\n00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:21.090\nI might have to remove some things.\n\n355\n00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:23.890\nbefore I can change\nthe scope of that group so\n\n356\n00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:27.020\nthat I don't violate any of those rules.\n\n357\n00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:30.880\nAll right,\nnow let's talk about group strategy.\n\n358\n00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.758\nAll right?\nThis is the fun part, right, Wes?\n\n359\n00:19:32.758 --> 00:19:33.506\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n360\n00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:37.150\n&gt;&gt; All right, I'm going to flip\nover to a drawing that I have.\n\n361\n00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:40.770\nAnd I wanna highlight\nthis here this AGDLP.\n\n362\n00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:42.740\nThis is Microsoft's strategy.\n\n363\n00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:45.490\nThe recommendation or using groups.\n\n364\n00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:48.940\nA stands for accounts, G stands for\n\n365\n00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:54.545\nglobal groups, DL for domain local and\nthen P for permission.\n\n366\n00:19:54.545 --> 00:19:57.002\nNow, if you go back before,\n\n367\n00:19:57.002 --> 00:20:01.070\nsay 2008, you will remember a different\nstrategy, and that was IDGLA.\n\n368\n00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.820\nIdentities went into global groups,\nglobal groups into domain local groups,\n\n369\n00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:08.680\ndomain local groups were given access,\nthe IDGLA.\n\n370\n00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:12.720\nThey changed the name,\nthe acronym, it's now ADGLP,\n\n371\n00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.600\nbut it means the exact same thing.\n\n372\n00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.770\nOr, I might have that backwards, you know\nsometimes I can't remember which one came\n\n373\n00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:25.190\nfirst IDGLA For this particular exam,\nit is gonna be AGDLP, all right.\n\n374\n00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:26.480\nAgain, they mean the same thing, so\n\n375\n00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.380\nif you see different initials\non the end it's okay.\n\n376\n00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.750\nAccounts, identities, same thing.\n\n377\n00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:34.650\nPermissions, access, same thing,\njust a different acronym.\n\n378\n00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:37.370\nAll right, so what the heck do they mean?\n\n379\n00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:40.780\nWhat they mean is we're\ngonna take accounts\n\n380\n00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:43.120\nlike imagine these are my sales users.\n\n381\n00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:47.580\nI'm gonna take their user accounts and I\"m\ngonna gather them up into a global group.\n\n382\n00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.020\nMaybe I call this global group,\nSales Users.\n\n383\n00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:53.870\nTypically, we name global\ngroups based on the membership\n\n384\n00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:57.940\nbecause global groups are designed\nto collect up objects or\n\n385\n00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.160\naccounts that need\nthe same level of access.\n\n386\n00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.430\nSo I'll have one global group for\nsales users.\n\n387\n00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:04.090\nI'll have a different global group for\n\n388\n00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:07.150\nmarketing users because they need\ndifferent permissions than sales users.\n\n389\n00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:11.510\nI'll have a different global group for\na help desk or for sales managers.\n\n390\n00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:14.300\nThey need different\npermissions from sales users.\n\n391\n00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.900\nSo global groups are typically named\nbased on the members we're gonna find\n\n392\n00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:18.910\ninside there.\n\n393\n00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:21.870\nThat makes administration for\nother administrators that weren't around\n\n394\n00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:25.000\nwhen you created the groups\nmakes it easier for them.\n\n395\n00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000\nSo we created our little groups and\nwe gather up the like accounts like in for\n\n396\n00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.900\nexample sales users.\n\n397\n00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.360\nThen we're gonna take the resource,\n\n398\n00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:37.130\nlets say we're gonna give all those\nusers access to the resource.\n\n399\n00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:39.660\nWe're gonna call it\ncreateadomainlocalgroup, and\n\n400\n00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:43.260\ngive it the appropriate\npermission over the resource.\n\n401\n00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:47.320\nNow, domain local groups,\nnaming strategy is usually it's\n\n402\n00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:53.000\nlets name it based on the resource and\nthe permission that it's gonna give.\n\n403\n00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.980\nSo if I was gonna name this account, let's\nsay that these were my sales Accounts.\n\n404\n00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.692\nAll right?\nUp here.\n\n405\n00:22:02.692 --> 00:22:08.191\nSo, I might name this global group\n\n406\n00:22:08.191 --> 00:22:12.939\nsomething like Sales Users.\n\n407\n00:22:12.939 --> 00:22:14.490\nAll right?\n\n408\n00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:19.140\nFor my domain local group, I'm actually\ngoing to name this on the resource and\n\n409\n00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:20.250\nthe permission.\n\n410\n00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:23.120\nI'm going to name this one,\n\n411\n00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:29.249\nlet's call it quarter report,\n\n412\n00:22:29.249 --> 00:22:33.860\nunderscore, read.\n\n413\n00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:35.070\nNow, my name is something like that.\n\n414\n00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:39.780\nThat way any other admin that\nlooks at this group knows,\n\n415\n00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:41.630\nthat if I add somebody to that group,\n\n416\n00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:45.780\nit's going to give them read permissions\nover something called quarter report.\n\n417\n00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:50.310\nI put all my sales accounts in\na group called called sales users.\n\n418\n00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:56.340\nI give this domain local group quarter\nreport read permission over the resource\n\n419\n00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:00.510\nand then I put the global group into\nthe domain local group, and then I'm done.\n\n420\n00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:01.170\nAll right?\n\n421\n00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:02.680\nNow, it might seem like an extra step.\n\n422\n00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:06.120\nWhy didn't I just assign\nthese accounts permissions?\n\n423\n00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.450\nThat one we can probably understand.\n\n424\n00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:10.340\nBecause if there's 100 of them,\nI don't want to do it 100 times.\n\n425\n00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:14.010\nBut, Mike, you've told me this global\ngroup is gonna contain all 100\n\n426\n00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:14.980\nsales users.\n\n427\n00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:17.619\nAnd so, I could just add the global\ngroup to the access controllers.\n\n428\n00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:19.690\nThat makes sense, right?\n\n429\n00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:21.200\nIt's pretty easy.\n\n430\n00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:25.610\nAnd it would really work, but\nwe've got to think about scalability.\n\n431\n00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:28.140\nSales users need read over this.\n\n432\n00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:31.540\nIs there anybody else in our\norganization that needs read over this?\n\n433\n00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.200\nWhat if I have this situation?\n\n434\n00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.390\nWhat if I had my marketing people?\n\n435\n00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.524\nAnd my boss came to me and\n\n436\n00:23:42.524 --> 00:23:46.952\nsaid hey you know what marketing needs\nread over that resources as well.\n\n437\n00:23:46.952 --> 00:23:50.604\nOk, well,\nI've already got a global group for\n\n438\n00:23:50.604 --> 00:23:54.998\nthe marketing people I'm sure,\nand I've already put.\n\n439\n00:23:54.998 --> 00:24:01.560\nThe marketing people in their little\nmarketing global group, right?\n\n440\n00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.140\nSo all I have to do,\nwhen the boss comes to me and says, hey,\n\n441\n00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:07.460\nmarketing needs read over\nthat resource as well.\n\n442\n00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:13.260\nAll I'm gonna have to do is drop\nthem into that group, and I'm done.\n\n443\n00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:17.170\nWhat if he comes to me tomorrow and\nsays, hey,\n\n444\n00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:20.130\nfive other groups need read\npermission over that resource?\n\n445\n00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:22.820\nI just take the global groups\nthat probably already exist for\n\n446\n00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:25.980\nthose different departments, and\nI add them into the main local group.\n\n447\n00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.490\nThen the boss comes to me and\nshe says, hey, you know what?\n\n448\n00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:30.490\nMarketing shouldn't be able\nto read that resource.\n\n449\n00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:34.830\nThey're using those numbers in marketing\nthings, and I don't want them doing that.\n\n450\n00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:36.200\nTake them off the list.\n\n451\n00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.956\nAll I have to do is delete their group,\n\n452\n00:24:38.956 --> 00:24:43.060\nthat global group for marketing,\nfrom the domain local group and I'm done.\n\n453\n00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:47.650\nSo you see how this strategy makes\nadministration much more easy?\n\n454\n00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:52.836\nIt simplifies it,\nit makes easier to manage, if you will.\n\n455\n00:24:52.836 --> 00:24:55.520\nBecause now I don't have to go\nto this resource every time.\n\n456\n00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.370\nI've already got a group, and\n\n457\n00:24:57.370 --> 00:25:01.040\nall I have to do is change the group\nmembership to control who has read access.\n\n458\n00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:04.060\nNow, I might have another\ndomain local group.\n\n459\n00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:06.430\nWhoops, I did that wrong.\n\n460\n00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:11.618\nI'll have another domain local group,\ncalled QReport Read/Write,\n\n461\n00:25:11.618 --> 00:25:13.159\nor QReport Full Control.\n\n462\n00:25:13.159 --> 00:25:16.771\nAnd I'll probably have a global\ngroup called Sales Managers.\n\n463\n00:25:16.771 --> 00:25:22.315\nAnd I can add sales managers to that\nfull control domain local group, right?\n\n464\n00:25:22.315 --> 00:25:25.216\nAnd then when the CEO says,\nhow come I can't write to that?\n\n465\n00:25:25.216 --> 00:25:27.210\nI'll say,\nbecause you goof things up all the time.\n\n466\n00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:28.380\nI'll say no, no here.\n\n467\n00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:30.910\nAnd I'll just take my CEO global group and\n\n468\n00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:35.530\ndump it in the domain local group\nQReport_fullcontrol, right?\n\n469\n00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:38.082\nSo hopefully that makes sense\nas far as this group strategy.\n\n470\n00:25:38.082 --> 00:25:41.860\nAccounts into global groups,\nglobal groups into domain local groups,\n\n471\n00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.160\npermissions are assigned\nto the domain local groups.\n\n472\n00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:48.123\nAnd this is gonna simplify\nthe administration tenfold,\n\n473\n00:25:48.123 --> 00:25:51.847\nespecially as you start\ngrowing as an organization.\n\n474\n00:25:51.847 --> 00:25:52.809\nNow, it said,\n\n475\n00:25:52.809 --> 00:25:58.480\nthe universal groups don't come into\nplay unless you have multiple domains.\n\n476\n00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:03.000\nWhen we have multiple domains, I'm gonna\nhave global groups from different domains\n\n477\n00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.130\nthat I want to give those permissions to.\n\n478\n00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:10.020\nAnd universal groups can contain\nglobal groups from multiple domains.\n\n479\n00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.920\nSo that's what we're gonna do with this.\n\n480\n00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:16.160\nWe're just going to slip the U right\nin between the global groups and\n\n481\n00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.500\nthe domain local groups.\n\n482\n00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.030\nSo we just stretch out\nthat process a little bit.\n\n483\n00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:24.600\nAccounts into global groups,\nglobal groups into universal groups,\n\n484\n00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.620\nuniversal groups into domain local groups.\n\n485\n00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:29.410\nDomain local groups are what\nget assigned the permissions\n\n486\n00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:31.530\nover the resource, all right?\n\n487\n00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:37.620\nBecause if we had a second domain,\nthey had a global group called sales.\n\n488\n00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:41.850\nI could simply dump it in the universal\ngroup and I would be done.\n\n489\n00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:45.690\nAgain, it's gonna make your life so\nmuch easier.\n\n490\n00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:50.780\n[COUGH] I don't remember what I was gonna\ndo with this fancy drawing here, so.\n\n491\n00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:52.830\nWhat was I gonna do?\n\n492\n00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:54.480\nI was gonna draw out this whole thing out.\n\n493\n00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.440\nIt's a little painful to watch me draw,\nso hopefully\n\n494\n00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:01.760\nyou've gotten the concept from these other\ndrawings that I have accomplished here.\n\n495\n00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:05.010\nSo group strategies, AGDLP.\n\n496\n00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:08.030\nIf we're in multiple domains, AGUDLP.\n\n497\n00:27:11.242 --> 00:27:13.620\nAll right Wes,\nwhat does that bring us to next?\n\n498\n00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:15.659\nWe got our built-in groups?\n\n499\n00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.175\nThere are some groups that are built in.\n\n500\n00:27:19.175 --> 00:27:21.960\nNormally, we're creating those\nglobal groups as we need,\n\n501\n00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:27.620\nwe're creating those domain local groups\nas we need, and the universal groups.\n\n502\n00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:30.220\nThere are some groups that are already\nbuilt-in to Active Directory when you\n\n503\n00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:32.990\ninstall it, like the domain admins group.\n\n504\n00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:35.805\nThat is a built in group that I\ncan just start adding people to.\n\n505\n00:27:35.805 --> 00:27:40.601\nAnd those built in groups have\na certain set of rights already\n\n506\n00:27:40.601 --> 00:27:42.800\nassociated with them.\n\n507\n00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.508\nLike the domain admins, they have full\ncontrol over everything in the domain.\n\n508\n00:27:45.508 --> 00:27:48.440\nThere's the backup operators\nthat have permission or\n\n509\n00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:53.040\nthe right, to backup all domain\ncontrollers using Windows Backup.\n\n510\n00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:56.980\nThere's the account operators\ngroup that's built in.\n\n511\n00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:00.760\nIf I add you to the account operators\ngroup, you have permission to create,\n\n512\n00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:04.520\nmodify, and\ndelete user accounts in Active Directory.\n\n513\n00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.802\nI didn't have to go and figure out,\nall right, I'm gonna make a group.\n\n514\n00:28:06.802 --> 00:28:10.380\nLet me figure out what permissions\nI need to give you to do this job.\n\n515\n00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:14.400\nThere's some built in groups for\nspecific roles.\n\n516\n00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:19.810\nMicrosoft's strategy is to not\nuse the built in groups much.\n\n517\n00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:23.180\nThey would much rather\nyou make your own groups.\n\n518\n00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:27.110\nAnd assign just the permissions that\nyou want those groups to have, right?\n\n519\n00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:30.840\nSo you follow your group strategy,\nAGDLP your AGUDLP.\n\n520\n00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:31.880\nSo you might think, well, why?\n\n521\n00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:35.210\nWhy give me those groups and\nthen tell me not to use them?\n\n522\n00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:38.800\nUse them, Microsoft will tell you,\nuse them if they're appropriate.\n\n523\n00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.890\nYou just have to understand\nwhat permissions and\n\n524\n00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:43.590\nrights come along with those groups.\n\n525\n00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:45.950\nBecause remember principle\nof least privilege.\n\n526\n00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:50.250\nWe can end up giving somebody too many\npermissions by using the built in\n\n527\n00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:55.230\ngroups if we don't understand what\ncomes along with those built in groups.\n\n528\n00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:57.450\nLike the backup operators.\n\n529\n00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:59.530\nThey can backup and\nrestore domain controllers.\n\n530\n00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:01.300\nThey can also now physically log on.\n\n531\n00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:03.680\nThey can log on locally to\nthose domain controllers.\n\n532\n00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.018\nI might not have wanted that.\n\n533\n00:29:05.018 --> 00:29:08.478\nYes, I want them to back up,\nbut not to be able to log on.\n\n534\n00:29:08.478 --> 00:29:13.686\nOr a lot of organizations split those\nresponsibilities, backup and restore.\n\n535\n00:29:13.686 --> 00:29:18.036\nBecause if one person has the ability\nto do both backup and restore,\n\n536\n00:29:18.036 --> 00:29:21.050\nthat's considered a security issue.\n\n537\n00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:24.930\nBecause now if I get malicious,\nif I'm a disgruntled employee.\n\n538\n00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:28.740\nI could back something up, do something\nbad, try to get away with something, and\n\n539\n00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:31.010\nthen restore it to cover my tracks.\n\n540\n00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:34.720\nBut if I can only back it up and somebody\nelse has to restore, that won't work.\n\n541\n00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:38.330\nI'm gonna have to back up something, do\nsomething malicious, and then go to Wes.\n\n542\n00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:41.980\nHey Wes, here's 100 bucks, can you\nrestore this and cover my tracks for me?\n\n543\n00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:46.160\nWes is most likely gonna say no,\nalthough, 100 bucks is 100 bucks.\n\n544\n00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.400\nBut the idea is we split those up.\n\n545\n00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:52.788\nBut if I use that built-in group, I have\nno way of saying, Wes, you can backup but\n\n546\n00:29:52.788 --> 00:29:54.388\nyou can't restore, right?\n\n547\n00:29:54.388 --> 00:29:57.200\nI can create my own groups and\ngive them the ability to back up.\n\n548\n00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.860\nCreate a separate group,\ngive it the ability to restore.\n\n549\n00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:03.710\nSo the short of the story is,\nthere are several built-in groups,\n\n550\n00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:06.160\nfeel free to use them,\nthat's what they're there for.\n\n551\n00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.838\nBut just make sure you\nunderstand what rights and\n\n552\n00:30:08.838 --> 00:30:12.756\npermissions go along with those groups,\nso you don't end up violating\n\n553\n00:30:12.756 --> 00:30:16.432\nprinciple of least privilege when\nyou add people to those groups.\n\n554\n00:30:16.432 --> 00:30:18.742\nAll right, last thing I wanna talk about,\n\n555\n00:30:18.742 --> 00:30:23.210\nI know I've been mentioning this a couple\nof times and that is delegation.\n\n556\n00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:26.860\nAll right,\nwe've really talk about what it is.\n\n557\n00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:29.680\nWe say we can assign permissions\nin Active Directory.\n\n558\n00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.830\nNow, let's take a look at my screen here.\n\n559\n00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:34.540\nWhen we look at,\nlet's say this employee's OU.\n\n560\n00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.400\nLet's go down to the sales OU,\nas a matter of fact.\n\n561\n00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:42.480\nAll right, if I right-click on that\nsales OU and then go to Properties.\n\n562\n00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.580\nWe're gonna see a whole bunch of tabs,\nthree.\n\n563\n00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:47.200\nA whole bunch Mike, [LAUGH] all right?\n\n564\n00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.960\nYou don't get to see\nall of them by default.\n\n565\n00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:53.520\nIn order to see all of the tabs,\nI have to go to my View menu, and\n\n566\n00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.180\nturn on Advanced Features.\n\n567\n00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:58.406\nOnce I do that,\nI go back to that same group,\n\n568\n00:30:58.406 --> 00:31:01.909\nnotice there's a bunch of other\nthings that weren't there before.\n\n569\n00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:09.460\nI go back to that same OU,\nSales, right-click Properties.\n\n570\n00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:11.720\nAnd now you will see several more tabs.\n\n571\n00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.860\nOne of them being the Security tab.\n\n572\n00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.272\nAnd look, is that familiar?\n\n573\n00:31:16.272 --> 00:31:19.622\nIt's an access control list just like\nwe saw like with NTFS permissions,\n\n574\n00:31:19.622 --> 00:31:21.688\njust like we saw with\nregistry permissions.\n\n575\n00:31:21.688 --> 00:31:24.030\nIt's just an access control list.\n\n576\n00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:26.580\nNow, the permissions are different.\n\n577\n00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:32.210\nIt's not just read, write, modify,\nlist, and read next queue, and read.\n\n578\n00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:37.110\nThere are lots and lots of permissions and\nthis is just a small sampling.\n\n579\n00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:41.010\nBut the point of the story\nhere is it works the same way.\n\n580\n00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:43.751\nYou can add somebody to this list or\na group and\n\n581\n00:31:43.751 --> 00:31:47.950\nthen I can choose what permissions\nthey have or don't have, right?\n\n582\n00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:53.197\nWhich is fine, but if that ever changes,\nyou're gonna have to come in here.\n\n583\n00:31:53.197 --> 00:31:54.833\nWhat's a good way to say this?\n\n584\n00:31:54.833 --> 00:31:56.351\nIf I wanna give you, or a group,\n\n585\n00:31:56.351 --> 00:32:00.330\nlet's say I want to give Helpdesk\nthe ability to reset passwords.\n\n586\n00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:03.170\nAll right, what permissions\nare needed to reset passwords?\n\n587\n00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:08.010\nI don't know, I mean, I know you're\ngonna need to read the object.\n\n588\n00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:10.370\nYou're probably gonna need write\npermissions over the object.\n\n589\n00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:13.145\nI don't know if there's any other\npermissions needed to reset the password.\n\n590\n00:32:13.145 --> 00:32:15.989\nI'm gonna have to go do research and\nlook it up and come in here and\n\n591\n00:32:15.989 --> 00:32:17.736\nchoose the appropriate permissions.\n\n592\n00:32:17.736 --> 00:32:20.510\nCuz when I say there's a lot,\nlet's take a look here.\n\n593\n00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:25.680\nIf I click Advanced and I move this\nover where we can actually see it,\n\n594\n00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:29.050\nand I'm gonna click, where are we at?\n\n595\n00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:36.190\nLet's do, And I'm gonna have to zoom out,\nI cannot see everything at once here.\n\n596\n00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:39.539\nAll right, here is a list of all the\npossible permissions that I can assign.\n\n597\n00:32:43.596 --> 00:32:44.660\nStill going.\n\n598\n00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:46.045\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat's definitely gonna keep me busy.\n\n599\n00:32:46.045 --> 00:32:47.120\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n600\n00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.030\nI don't want to do all that manually.\n\n601\n00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:52.780\nThat's crazy, that's where\nthe Delegation Wizard comes into play.\n\n602\n00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:55.320\nMicrosoft has given us a wizard\nthat we can use to assign\n\n603\n00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:58.380\npermissions in Active Directory and\nsimplify the process.\n\n604\n00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:00.660\nSo, again,\nlet's make a group called Helpdesk.\n\n605\n00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:06.070\nSo I'll go to Groups &gt;\nNew Groups &gt; Helpdesk,\n\n606\n00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:08.865\nand I'll make it a global security group,\nand I'll click OK.\n\n607\n00:33:08.865 --> 00:33:12.831\nRight, and then I would put all\nmy helpdesk users in that group.\n\n608\n00:33:12.831 --> 00:33:16.720\nAnd I want them to be able to reset\npasswords for the salespeople.\n\n609\n00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.680\nSo I can right-click on that Sales and\n\n610\n00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:24.730\nI can choose Delegate Control and\nthat launches my Delegation Wizard.\n\n611\n00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:29.040\nI simply click Next and it says, well,\nwho are you trying to delegate to?\n\n612\n00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:32.530\nAnd I click Add and\nI find my Helpdesk group.\n\n613\n00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.910\nAll right, oops, and\nI don't wanna add anybody else, mis-click.\n\n614\n00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:41.470\nAnd it's like, great, now it knows who I\nwanna give permission to and I click Next.\n\n615\n00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:43.060\nWhat do you want to delegate?\n\n616\n00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:45.660\nI want to be able to reset user passwords.\n\n617\n00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:48.608\nThere's a list of about 12 or\n13 common tasks,\n\n618\n00:33:48.608 --> 00:33:51.913\nyou can also go to create\na custom task which is very cool.\n\n619\n00:33:51.913 --> 00:33:55.790\nI'm gonna just use the one since\nthere's a common task already set for\n\n620\n00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:59.483\nexactly what I need to do,\nI'll just use that, Reset passwords.\n\n621\n00:33:59.483 --> 00:34:04.060\nI'll click Next and Finish,\nand it was that easy.\n\n622\n00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:07.790\nA lot easier than going through that list\nof about 50 different permissions and\n\n623\n00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:10.200\ntrying to figure out which one's which,\nright?\n\n624\n00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:16.270\nAnd now the Helpdesk can reset\npasswords for accounts in the sales OU.\n\n625\n00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:19.922\nHere's a very important thing to keep\nin mind about the Delegation Wizard.\n\n626\n00:34:19.922 --> 00:34:24.250\nI right-clicked on the Sales OU and\ndelegated those permissions.\n\n627\n00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:30.020\nSo now they can reset passwords for user\naccounts in the OU but not in Marketing.\n\n628\n00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:34.143\nNot anywhere else, right, because I\nspecifically said only the Sales OU.\n\n629\n00:34:34.143 --> 00:34:38.460\nNow if I had gone up to the Employees OU\nthat contains the Marketing and\n\n630\n00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:41.289\nSales OU, and delegated permission there,\n\n631\n00:34:41.289 --> 00:34:45.300\nthen those permissions would\ninherit just like NTFS does.\n\n632\n00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:49.298\nAnd they'd be able to reset both\nMarketing and Sales users passwords.\n\n633\n00:34:49.298 --> 00:34:52.583\nSo you can get very, very,\nyou can fully customize or\n\n634\n00:34:52.583 --> 00:34:55.584\nyou can get very creative\nwith your delegation.\n\n635\n00:34:55.584 --> 00:34:59.510\nAgain, it goes back to setting up the OUs\nproperly in the first place, right?\n\n636\n00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:03.540\nIf I hadn't created those OUs,\nif all employees were in one big fat OU,\n\n637\n00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:08.300\nhow could I delegate permission to\nreset Sales users passwords, but\n\n638\n00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:09.860\nnot Marketing passwords?\n\n639\n00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:11.290\nIt wouldn't work, right?\n\n640\n00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:13.820\nSo it falls back to that\ncreating those OUs and\n\n641\n00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:18.460\nstructuring it in a way that's gonna\nhelp me manage our Active Directory.\n\n642\n00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:22.270\nSo that's delegation,\nI will leave you with one thought,\n\n643\n00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:25.761\nalways delegate to groups, never\ndelegate to individual users, all right?\n\n644\n00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:29.290\nWe just talked about group strategy.\n\n645\n00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:32.413\nIn this case I didn't delegate\nto a domain local group,\n\n646\n00:35:32.413 --> 00:35:34.546\ntechnically I probably should've.\n\n647\n00:35:34.546 --> 00:35:38.290\nBut I don't want you delegating\nto an individual user.\n\n648\n00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:42.320\nCuz let's say I delegated to\nWes Bryan directly, his user account.\n\n649\n00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.010\nIf I ever wanna undo those permissions,\n\n650\n00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:46.470\nWes doesn't need to do that anymore,\nI've gotta go in and\n\n651\n00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:50.270\nmanually uncheck all those permissions\nfrom all those different places.\n\n652\n00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:54.220\nAnd I don't even sure which ones the\nwizard set, much less can I go back and\n\n653\n00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:55.410\nundo them.\n\n654\n00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:58.663\nIf I delegate to a group instead\nof directly to Wes's account, and\n\n655\n00:35:58.663 --> 00:36:02.670\nI put Wes's account in that group,\nwell, Wes gets the permissions.\n\n656\n00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:04.730\nIf Wes doesn't need\nthe permissions anymore,\n\n657\n00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:08.380\nI simply pull him out of the group,\nnow he doesn't have those permissions.\n\n658\n00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:09.950\nI don't have to worry about undelegating,\n\n659\n00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:13.330\nI can leave the group empty if\nnobody needs those permissions.\n\n660\n00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:16.600\nIf next week we hire somebody\nthat needs those permissions,\n\n661\n00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.960\nI just put them back in the group\nit's already been delegated to.\n\n662\n00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:22.732\nSo always delegate to a group, never\ndelegate to an individual user account.\n\n663\n00:36:22.732 --> 00:36:27.740\nAnd that, my friends, I think wraps\nup Active Directory and permissions.\n\n664\n00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:30.859\n&gt;&gt; Well it's been a journey [LAUGH] but\nit's a road well covered.\n\n665\n00:36:30.859 --> 00:36:33.950\nSo Mike, we do appreciate you being here.\n\n666\n00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:35.720\nNow I know that we're coming to the end,\nand\n\n667\n00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:37.810\nI know you did have a final\nword that you said.\n\n668\n00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:40.910\nBut before we sign out on this episode,\nany other\n\n669\n00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:44.670\nmaybe words of wisdom you might like to\nimpart to our viewers before we sign off?\n\n670\n00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:47.140\n&gt;&gt; I can't think of any\noff the top of my head.\n\n671\n00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:52.224\nThe biggest thing that I would recommend\nis follow that group strategy, AGDLP.\n\n672\n00:36:52.224 --> 00:36:55.563\nIt seems like an extra step in the\nbeginning but over time you'll learn to\n\n673\n00:36:55.563 --> 00:37:00.080\nappreciate it and you'll be like gosh, I'm\nglad we followed that from the beginning.\n\n674\n00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:02.850\nAnd never assign permissions,\nNTFS permissions,\n\n675\n00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:06.150\nregistry permissions, delegating\npermissions in Active Directory,\n\n676\n00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:08.020\nnever do that to\nan individual user account.\n\n677\n00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:12.868\nAlways do it to a group, that way I can\ncontrol who has those permissions just by\n\n678\n00:37:12.868 --> 00:37:17.367\nchanging group membership,\nnot by modifying the access control list.\n\n679\n00:37:17.367 --> 00:37:21.250\nCuz one of the things I didn't mention,\nwhen we were showing you that drawing.\n\n680\n00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:25.040\nAnd we were putting these Sales users into\nthe global group and then into the domain\n\n681\n00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:30.065\nlocal group, and then giving that\npermissions, is it was just one resource.\n\n682\n00:37:30.065 --> 00:37:33.900\nThere's hundreds and thousands of\nresources they need access to, right.\n\n683\n00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:36.790\nSo I can put that global group in all\nthese different domain local groups,\n\n684\n00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:38.212\nit's gonna make your life a lot easier.\n\n685\n00:37:38.212 --> 00:37:42.120\nOne other thing that I just though of,\nWes, I just keep going and\n\n686\n00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:43.090\ngoing and going.\n\n687\n00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:48.006\nUniversal groups are a little\nbit different than other groups.\n\n688\n00:37:48.006 --> 00:37:51.440\nAnd it was talked about in a couple of\nthe reference materials for this exam.\n\n689\n00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.970\nSo let me make sure I mention this.\n\n690\n00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:57.059\nGlobal groups, domain local groups, all\nstored in the Active Directory database.\n\n691\n00:37:58.130 --> 00:38:02.830\nUniversal groups are actually stored in\nsomething known as the global catalog.\n\n692\n00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:07.140\nAnd this is because, remember,\nuniversal groups are used between domains.\n\n693\n00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:10.510\nSo domain controllers\nfrom different domains\n\n694\n00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:13.510\nneed to be able to access the group\nmembership of universal groups.\n\n695\n00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:16.000\nSo it's actually stored outside\nof the Active Directory database.\n\n696\n00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.841\nIt's stored on something known\nas a global catalog server and\n\n697\n00:38:18.841 --> 00:38:21.969\nthat replicates to all the domain\ncontrollers and all the domains.\n\n698\n00:38:21.969 --> 00:38:25.807\nWay more than we need to know but\nthe point of this is,\n\n699\n00:38:25.807 --> 00:38:29.474\nwhen you change membership\nof a universal group,\n\n700\n00:38:29.474 --> 00:38:34.560\nthat will trigger replication\nbetween the global catalog servers.\n\n701\n00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:37.747\nAnd that can be a lot of replication\ntraffic on your network,\n\n702\n00:38:37.747 --> 00:38:40.622\nespecially if you have\nmultiple physical locations,\n\n703\n00:38:40.622 --> 00:38:44.970\nreplication going across the WAN\nlink which slows everything down.\n\n704\n00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:50.310\nIf I follow group strategy and I only\nput global groups in universal groups,\n\n705\n00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:54.800\nthen rarely will my universal\ngroup members have change.\n\n706\n00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.531\nBecause if I hire new people,\nI'm adding them to the global group.\n\n707\n00:38:57.531 --> 00:38:59.606\nThe global group's already\nin the universal group,\n\n708\n00:38:59.606 --> 00:39:01.370\nI didn't change anything there.\n\n709\n00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:06.250\nSo by adding and removing members from the\nglobal group, technically I'm not changing\n\n710\n00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:11.090\nthe universal group membership and I'm\nnot triggering forest-wide replication.\n\n711\n00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:13.760\nIf I put users directly\nin the universal group,\n\n712\n00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:17.901\nevery time I change that I'm\ntriggering forest-wide replication, and\n\n713\n00:39:17.901 --> 00:39:20.390\nyour network is not gonna be happy for\nthat.\n\n714\n00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:23.810\nSo just follow the strategy and\n\n715\n00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:27.560\ntry to limit your universal group\nmembership to global groups only.\n\n716\n00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:30.155\n&gt;&gt; Mike,\nwe appreciate you being here as always and\n\n717\n00:39:30.155 --> 00:39:31.937\nwe do appreciate you the viewer.\n\n718\n00:39:31.937 --> 00:39:34.560\nBut it does look like we're gonna\ngo ahead and wrap this one up.\n\n719\n00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:37.780\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n720\n00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:39.400\n&gt;&gt; And I'm the talk forever Mike Rodrick.\n\n721\n00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:40.432\n&gt;&gt; And [LAUGH] we'll see you next

00:00:05.772\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Coming to you live from San Francisco,\n\n4\n00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:06.665\nCalifornia.\n\n5\n00:00:06.665 --> 00:00:08.401\n[MUSIC]\n\n6\n00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:12.084\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:12.084 --> 00:00:13.558\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and lucky you.\n\n8\n00:00:13.558 --> 00:00:17.132\nYou've made that intelligent\nchoice to watch ITProTV,\n\n9\n00:00:17.132 --> 00:00:19.372\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n10\n00:00:19.372 --> 00:00:23.881\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, as we continue\non with MTA Security Fundamentals.\n\n11\n00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:27.001\nAnd we're going to be looking at\npassword policies today, aren't we?\n\n12\n00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:29.920\nWith the person who truly is our expert,\nMike Rodrick.\n\n13\n00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.460\nHey Mike.\n\n14\n00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.590\n&gt;&gt; Hey how's it going Zach?\n\n15\n00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.210\nGlad to be back here and yeah, password\npolicies are the topic of the day.\n\n16\n00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.289\nAnd we've already talked a little bit\nabout passwords in some previous episodes,\n\n17\n00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:42.456\nso make sure you go back and\ncheck those out.\n\n18\n00:00:42.456 --> 00:00:48.467\nWhen we talk about password policies,\nwe're really talking about how can I.\n\n19\n00:00:48.467 --> 00:00:51.169\nI wouldn't say force but\nit really is what we're doing,\n\n20\n00:00:51.169 --> 00:00:55.320\ninsure might be a better way to put it,\nright a little more politically correct.\n\n21\n00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.735\nInsure that my users are following\nour security policies, and using or\n\n22\n00:01:00.735 --> 00:01:06.695\ncreating strong passwords, or passwords\nthat are less likely to be cracked, right.\n\n23\n00:01:06.695 --> 00:01:09.935\n&gt;&gt; So here we're steering our\nusers into using passwords that\n\n24\n00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:13.533\nwe would like them to use or we approve\nof, that we think are more secure?\n\n25\n00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:14.571\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right,\n\n26\n00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:18.425\ncuz we all know that using the word\npassword as a password is a bad thing.\n\n27\n00:01:18.425 --> 00:01:19.867\nBecause it's easy to guess.\n\n28\n00:01:19.867 --> 00:01:23.280\nIt's gonna be cracked by,\nremember those techniques we talked about?\n\n29\n00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.420\nThe dictionary attack would crack\nthat word in a couple of seconds.\n\n30\n00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.850\nBrut force wouldn't take\nprobably all that long.\n\n31\n00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.370\nSo that's what we're trying to do is make\nsure, cuz we can tell our users hey,\n\n32\n00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.920\nuse strong passwords.\n\n33\n00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.140\nBut do they really understand\nwhat a strong password is?\n\n34\n00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.070\nAnd we need to educate them,\nthat's part of our job.\n\n35\n00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.902\nBut we also wanna put controls in place\ncuz, just cuz we've explained it and\n\n36\n00:01:44.902 --> 00:01:47.968\nthey understand it, doesn't necessarily\nmean they're gonna do that, right?\n\n37\n00:01:47.968 --> 00:01:53.152\nCuz we're all humans, we get a little\nlazy sometimes, we have our favorite\n\n38\n00:01:53.152 --> 00:01:58.753\npassword that we never wanna change, so\nwe reuse the same password over and over.\n\n39\n00:01:58.753 --> 00:02:01.412\nWe use simple passwords\nthat are easy to remember.\n\n40\n00:02:01.412 --> 00:02:04.394\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit's like average that's not good.\n\n41\n00:02:04.394 --> 00:02:06.401\n&gt;&gt; That would probably be a good one,\nbut it would be.\n\n42\n00:02:06.401 --> 00:02:08.099\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hard to type and\n\n43\n00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.760\neasy to maybe mistype a few times.\n\n44\n00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.670\nRight?\nSo that's really what password\n\n45\n00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.440\npolicies are about.\n\n46\n00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.820\nIs guiding, or trying to make sure that\nour users are following our procedure.\n\n47\n00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.870\nCuz as I was saying, we can tell them,\nwe can have it in a security policy\n\n48\n00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.330\nthat they sign when they get hired and\nit goes in their jacket.\n\n49\n00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.420\nBut how do I make sure they're\nfollowing that, right?\n\n50\n00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.930\nAnd that's where these\npolicies come into play,\n\n51\n00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.450\nthese are controls that\nwe can put in place.\n\n52\n00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.860\nEvery Windows system\nhas a password policy.\n\n53\n00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.750\nSo if you've got your computer at home,\nthat's not part of any domain or\n\n54\n00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.400\nwork network or anything like that.\n\n55\n00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.708\nThere's a password policy\nthat you can use on there.\n\n56\n00:02:42.708 --> 00:02:44.138\nIn a domain environment,\n\n57\n00:02:44.138 --> 00:02:48.883\nlike your corporate environment where we\nhave domain controllers and work stations,\n\n58\n00:02:48.883 --> 00:02:53.043\nwe can apply these policies from\nthe domain controller, and basically have\n\n59\n00:02:53.043 --> 00:02:57.145\nit enforced on all the client machines so\nwe don't have to touch everyone.\n\n60\n00:02:57.145 --> 00:02:59.245\nNow a good thing to remember there,\n\n61\n00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:02.885\nif I say every windows machine\nhas it's own password policy,\n\n62\n00:03:02.885 --> 00:03:08.138\nbut in a corporate environment I can set\nit at the domain level, which one wins.\n\n63\n00:03:08.138 --> 00:03:11.391\nWhat if at the domain environment,\nI say my users have\n\n64\n00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:16.184\nto use ten character passwords, and\nthey have to change them every 14 days.\n\n65\n00:03:16.184 --> 00:03:18.389\nYou don't like that,\nthat seems like too much work.\n\n66\n00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:22.752\nSo you're gonna open up your computer, and\nyou're gonna go into your local policy and\n\n67\n00:03:22.752 --> 00:03:25.262\nsay yeah,\nI can use three character passwords and\n\n68\n00:03:25.262 --> 00:03:26.897\nI don't ever have to change it.\n\n69\n00:03:26.897 --> 00:03:30.832\nFortunately for the domain admins,\nnot so fortunate for you.\n\n70\n00:03:30.832 --> 00:03:35.080\nThe domain policy will always\noverride the local policy.\n\n71\n00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.670\nSo you can try to change it locally if\nyour an administrator on your machine.\n\n72\n00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.270\nBut if its part of the domain,\nthe domain policy will win.\n\n73\n00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.650\nNow if it's not part of the domain.\n\n74\n00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.166\nIf its your own personal laptop\nthat you bring into work and\n\n75\n00:03:47.166 --> 00:03:51.708\nthey allow you to do that, then the policy\non your machine would take over.\n\n76\n00:03:51.708 --> 00:03:54.831\nThe other thing I wanna mention while\nwe're talking about when it applies.\n\n77\n00:03:54.831 --> 00:03:59.070\nThe local policy applies to all\nthe accounts on that machine.\n\n78\n00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.158\nEverybody that logs into that machine.\n\n79\n00:04:01.158 --> 00:04:05.661\nThe domain policy applies to all user\naccounts that log onto the machine,\n\n80\n00:04:05.661 --> 00:04:07.487\nincluding domain accounts.\n\n81\n00:04:07.487 --> 00:04:10.488\nSo even accounts that aren't\nstored locally on that machine,\n\n82\n00:04:10.488 --> 00:04:12.655\nwill have to apply that policy.\n\n83\n00:04:12.655 --> 00:04:15.115\nAnd if you try to log on\nlocally to the system.\n\n84\n00:04:15.115 --> 00:04:18.325\nLet's say that your computer,\nyou have a domain account that you\n\n85\n00:04:18.325 --> 00:04:22.065\nlog onto when you're at work, but it's\na laptop and when you leave work you have\n\n86\n00:04:22.065 --> 00:04:25.790\na different account that you use, a local\naccount that's not part of the domain.\n\n87\n00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.580\nDomain policies apply to domain users and\nlocal users.\n\n88\n00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.330\nThey will always be\nenforced on that machine.\n\n89\n00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.800\nWhich is a good thing,\nthat means users can't intentionally or\n\n90\n00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.310\nunintentionally end up bypassing\nour security policies, and\n\n91\n00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.439\nend using a weak password, and then reduce\nthe security on our entire network.\n\n92\n00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.810\nAll right, so what policies do we\nhave that we can use to control\n\n93\n00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.150\nthese passwords?\n\n94\n00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.940\nThere's a few of them that we're gonna\ntake a look at here in just a second.\n\n95\n00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.460\nBut we can work with complexity.\n\n96\n00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.810\nHow complex the password is.\n\n97\n00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.020\nAnd I'll explain what\nthat means in a second.\n\n98\n00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.400\nWe can work with our account lockout\npolicies, this is just like it sounds.\n\n99\n00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.360\nI mean if you try and\n\n100\n00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.140\nyou get the wrong password too many times,\nwe'll lock the account.\n\n101\n00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.570\nYou can't use it anymore.\n\n102\n00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.460\nPassword length is another one that\nwe can modify, and password history.\n\n103\n00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.040\nHow many passwords this system remembers,\nis another one that we can end up using.\n\n104\n00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.780\nAnd then how often you have\nto change the password.\n\n105\n00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.866\nSo for this exam, keep that in mind.\n\n106\n00:05:21.866 --> 00:05:26.584\nWe can control the complexity,\nthe account locked out,\n\n107\n00:05:26.584 --> 00:05:33.086\nthe password history, the link and\nhow often we have to change our passwords.\n\n108\n00:05:33.086 --> 00:05:34.595\nSo let's take a look at the settings,\n\n109\n00:05:34.595 --> 00:05:37.780\ncuz this is a lot more fun to look at them\nthan just stay here and talk about them.\n\n110\n00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.370\nSo I'm on my local machine and what am\ngonna do, is I'm gonna open up a GP edit\n\n111\n00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:48.770\nas just say I'm on a Windows 10 laptop\n.msc and this is a domain machine.\n\n112\n00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.820\nIt is part of a domain, but I can still\nopen up my local policy and show you those\n\n113\n00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.740\nsettings, even though they won't actually\ntake effect because it's a domain machine.\n\n114\n00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.930\nSo I typed in,\nif you can see that there, gpedit.msc.\n\n115\n00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.608\nAnd evidently ZoomIt is not running, so\n\n116\n00:06:05.608 --> 00:06:08.616\nlet me launch that again so\nthat I can zoom in.\n\n117\n00:06:08.616 --> 00:06:10.991\nHaving some issues with\ngood old ZoomIt today.\n\n118\n00:06:10.991 --> 00:06:12.510\n&gt;&gt; That zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom.\n\n119\n00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.220\n&gt;&gt; It's a great program, love it, love it.\n\n120\n00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.460\nMark Russinovich wrote that.\n\n121\n00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.488\nHe's a brilliant guy, GPEdit.msc.\n\n122\n00:06:24.933 --> 00:06:26.346\nThere we go.\n\n123\n00:06:26.346 --> 00:06:28.978\nSo GP and I'm sorry I didn't zoom\nin like I said I was going to.\n\n124\n00:06:28.978 --> 00:06:33.730\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Gpedit.msc and there you go.\n\n125\n00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.420\nThat's what I ended up typing.\n\n126\n00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.790\nMicrosoft Console, MSC is what that's for.\n\n127\n00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.400\nGroup policy editor,\nthat opens up your local policy.\n\n128\n00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.800\nNow in here, and I'll zoom in as\nsoon as I navigate down to it.\n\n129\n00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.410\nI'm gonna go under\nthe computer configuration.\n\n130\n00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.508\nLet me see if I can get in there.\n\n131\n00:06:50.508 --> 00:06:53.513\nAnd then Windows Settings.\n\n132\n00:06:53.513 --> 00:06:56.401\nAnd sometimes it takes a minute to expand\nout the Windows Settings as it reads\n\n133\n00:06:56.401 --> 00:06:57.400\neverything.\n\n134\n00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.220\nSecurity Settings, Account Policy.\n\n135\n00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.290\nAnd then Password Policy.\n\n136\n00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.580\nAnd these are my base settings right here.\n\n137\n00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:11.520\nI've got enforce password history,\nage minimum and maximum, minimum password\n\n138\n00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.960\nlength, complexity requirements and\npasswords use reversible encryption,\n\n139\n00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.690\none I didn't mention and\nthere's a reason for that.\n\n140\n00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.030\nBut I will tell you what it\nmeans as we go through here.\n\n141\n00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:21.110\nSo let's just go in order.\n\n142\n00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:27.052\nAnd what I want you to do as we\nare going through these, is two things.\n\n143\n00:07:27.052 --> 00:07:29.614\nOne, remember the setting itself,\nwhat we can do.\n\n144\n00:07:29.614 --> 00:07:31.784\nAnd what the default settings are.\n\n145\n00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:35.701\nBecause a great exam question is,\nwhat is the default for\n\n146\n00:07:35.701 --> 00:07:38.250\nminimum password age in Windows 7?\n\n147\n00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:42.540\nOr what the possible values are for\nthese options,\n\n148\n00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.941\nthat's another great exam questions.\n\n149\n00:07:45.941 --> 00:07:50.179\nHow many passwords can you\nremember using your policy.\n\n150\n00:07:50.179 --> 00:07:51.703\nSo keep those in mind\nas we go through here.\n\n151\n00:07:51.703 --> 00:07:54.756\nSo the first one enforced\npassword history,\n\n152\n00:07:54.756 --> 00:07:59.571\nI'm gonna double click on it just so\nI can pull it up a little bit bigger,\n\n153\n00:07:59.571 --> 00:08:03.615\nand what you'll see is it is turned on and\nit's set to 24.\n\n154\n00:08:03.615 --> 00:08:07.451\nNow in this case it's grayed out,\nand that's because, again,\n\n155\n00:08:07.451 --> 00:08:12.196\nthis computer's is part of a domain, so\nit's gonna override any local settings\n\n156\n00:08:12.196 --> 00:08:15.852\nthat I might have, and\nthat's a security thing, all right.\n\n157\n00:08:15.852 --> 00:08:21.125\nSo if you're wondering why I can't change\nthese, again, it's because this is part\n\n158\n00:08:21.125 --> 00:08:26.268\nof the domain, but by default, it's\ngonna remember 24 passwords, all right.\n\n159\n00:08:26.268 --> 00:08:29.515\nWhat that means is let's say\nthat I set my password to, and\n\n160\n00:08:29.515 --> 00:08:32.910\nI'm gonna use a very simple example so\nwe can remember them.\n\n161\n00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:34.830\nLet's say I set my password to blue,\nall right,\n\n162\n00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:40.150\nand then 30 days from now, it's time to\nchange my password and I set it to red.\n\n163\n00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:43.317\nAnd then 30 days from then,\nI wanna change my password again, and\n\n164\n00:08:43.317 --> 00:08:44.385\nI try to set it to blue.\n\n165\n00:08:44.385 --> 00:08:48.405\nWhat it's gonna do it's gonna say eh,\neh, eh, because it remembers\n\n166\n00:08:48.405 --> 00:08:53.395\nthe last 24 passwords that I've used and\nI'm not allowed to reuse them,all right.\n\n167\n00:08:53.395 --> 00:08:58.279\nIf it remembers it I can't reuse it so and\nuntil that blue gets all the way until\n\n168\n00:08:58.279 --> 00:09:02.060\n25 passwords later,\nI could finally use blue again.\n\n169\n00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:06.810\nOnce it gets bumped off the list, and\nit doesn't remember it anymore, all right.\n\n170\n00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:10.000\nThis is an very important\nsetting because our users,\n\n171\n00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.570\none of the big things\nthat they like to do,\n\n172\n00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:15.670\nis when it's time to change your password,\nchange it to the exact same thing.\n\n173\n00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:17.740\nMy password's blue,\nit's time to change it.\n\n174\n00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:18.780\nWhat's your old password?\n\n175\n00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.220\nBlue.\nWhat's your new password?\n\n176\n00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:20.900\nBlue.\n\n177\n00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:24.360\nOkay, good to go, so it really,\nyou didn't actually change it,\n\n178\n00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.310\neven though you went through the steps,\nthe password is still the same.\n\n179\n00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:31.210\nAnd there's a reason we want you to change\nyour password, right, we're not doing it\n\n180\n00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:35.610\njust because we wanna see you suffer and\ntry to remember a new password.\n\n181\n00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.690\nThe bad guys are trying to\nbreak your passwords, and\n\n182\n00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:42.840\nthe longer you have the same password,\nthe longer they have to break it.\n\n183\n00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.650\nBut if you change, let's say they steal\nan encrypted form of your password and now\n\n184\n00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.410\nthey're at their little hacking station\nand they're trying to break your password.\n\n185\n00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:52.000\nAnd it's taking days and\ndays and days and days for\n\n186\n00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.550\nthis program to do brute force and\ntry every possible combination.\n\n187\n00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:59.476\nAnd they, finally 45 days later, they\nbreak your password, like, yes now I've\n\n188\n00:09:59.476 --> 00:10:02.930\ngot it, I'm gonna run back in there,\nand I'm gonna try to log on as Mike.\n\n189\n00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.597\nAnd they try it, and it doesn't work, why?\n\n190\n00:10:05.597 --> 00:10:08.507\nBecause after 30 days I changed my\npassword, so the one you've been\n\n191\n00:10:08.507 --> 00:10:12.650\nworking on for all that time, it's not\neven my password anymore, all right.\n\n192\n00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:14.540\nThat's why we force users\nto change their password,\n\n193\n00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.186\ncuz the bad guys are trying to guess\nthem and they're trying to break them.\n\n194\n00:10:17.186 --> 00:10:19.802\nSo changing your password\noften is a good thing, and\n\n195\n00:10:19.802 --> 00:10:23.617\nthis is how I can make sure you're not\nusing the same password over and over.\n\n196\n00:10:23.617 --> 00:10:30.270\nAll right, so 24 is the default for that,\nyou can set that anywhere from 0 to 24.\n\n197\n00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:34.300\nZero would mean it's not\nremembering any passwords, and so\n\n198\n00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.780\nyou could change your\npassword from blue to blue.\n\n199\n00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:41.210\nIt would actually let you do that, and\nthen the max is 24 that it will remember.\n\n200\n00:10:42.572 --> 00:10:43.740\nAll right next one on here,\n\n201\n00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.660\nI'm gonna flip these around, just because\nlogically it makes more sense in my brain.\n\n202\n00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.440\nWe'll do minimum and then maximum,\nminimum password age,\n\n203\n00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.970\nhow old does your password have\nto be before you can change it?\n\n204\n00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.670\nThis is one that a lot of people\ndon't think about, it's like, wait,\n\n205\n00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:59.190\nthat doesn't make sense.\n\n206\n00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.830\nAnd what it's saying,\nthe default is one day and\n\n207\n00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:06.890\nif I change my password right now\nI cannot change it for 24 hours.\n\n208\n00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:10.110\nIt has to be at least one day old\nbefore I can change it again,\n\n209\n00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:13.830\nand you might think,\nwell how is that a security benefit?\n\n210\n00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:15.803\nIf I want my user,\nif a user wants to change their password,\n\n211\n00:11:15.803 --> 00:11:16.915\nthey should be able to change it.\n\n212\n00:11:16.915 --> 00:11:21.830\nThis is actually a setting that allows\nme to make sure my user aren't bypassing\n\n213\n00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:23.921\nsecurity settings, all right.\n\n214\n00:11:23.921 --> 00:11:28.510\nLet's say I was remembering 10 passwords,\nI had changed the 24 to 10.\n\n215\n00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:30.984\nAnd your user, it's time for\nthem to change their password,\n\n216\n00:11:30.984 --> 00:11:34.042\nthey get a little pop-up and they say,\nIt's time to change your password.\n\n217\n00:11:34.042 --> 00:11:37.400\nHere's what your user will do,\nthey will sit there and\n\n218\n00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.543\nthey will change their\npassword ten times in a row.\n\n219\n00:11:40.543 --> 00:11:44.898\nThe 11th time, they can now reuse\ntheir original password, and\n\n220\n00:11:44.898 --> 00:11:47.100\nthey're good to go, all right.\n\n221\n00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:51.200\nIf they have to wait a day, that means,\nlet's say we leave the default,\n\n222\n00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.550\n24 passwords remembered.\n\n223\n00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:57.700\nAnd it has to be at least one day\nold before you can change it again.\n\n224\n00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.584\nThat means if you had your\nfavorite password and\n\n225\n00:12:00.584 --> 00:12:04.455\nit was time to change it and you wanted\nto go back to your original password,\n\n226\n00:12:04.455 --> 00:12:08.430\nyou'd change it wait 24 hours\nchange it again wait 24 hours.\n\n227\n00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:11.790\nYou'd have to do that 25\ntimes it would take 25 days\n\n228\n00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:14.410\nto get back to your original password,\nall right.\n\n229\n00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:18.110\nBut if that was set to zero days then they\ncould change their password 25 times in\n\n230\n00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.870\na row until they got back\nto their favorite password.\n\n231\n00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:25.850\nAnd it's amazing your users that can not\nfigure out how to print their spreadsheet\n\n232\n00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:29.915\nin landscape format will figure out\nhow to bypass your security policies.\n\n233\n00:12:29.915 --> 00:12:31.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's the most amazing thing\n\n234\n00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.850\nI've ever seen, so that one is\nreally in there to control that.\n\n235\n00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:38.233\nTo make sure users can't change their\npasswords over and over and over again,\n\n236\n00:12:38.233 --> 00:12:40.349\nuntil they get back to\ntheir favorite password.\n\n237\n00:12:40.349 --> 00:12:44.274\nThe companies will set that,\nthe max value on that is 998,\n\n238\n00:12:44.274 --> 00:12:49.878\nI don't see too many companies saying you\ncan't change your password for 998 days.\n\n239\n00:12:49.878 --> 00:12:52.870\nThat wouldn't be all that smart,\nbut, for the exam,\n\n240\n00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:55.877\nunderstand that the possible\nvalues are 0 to 998.\n\n241\n00:12:55.877 --> 00:13:00.525\nMaximum password age,\nthis one I think most of us understand,\n\n242\n00:13:00.525 --> 00:13:05.140\nthis is how old the password\nis before I have to change it.\n\n243\n00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:12.675\nThe default is 42, the values possible\nare gonna be 0 To 999, did you catch that?\n\n244\n00:13:12.675 --> 00:13:16.071\n998 for the minimum,\n999 for the maximum, and\n\n245\n00:13:16.071 --> 00:13:20.687\nthat's because the minimum can't\nbe bigger than the maximum, right.\n\n246\n00:13:20.687 --> 00:13:24.120\nSo they make sure there's at\nleast one digit difference there.\n\n247\n00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:28.740\nAgain, I've never in my life heard of\na company going 999 days between password\n\n248\n00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:29.270\nchanges.\n\n249\n00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:35.540\n30 days is a very common value 42 is\nthe default, high security environments or\n\n250\n00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:41.582\nvery, the administrator accounts that have\nlots of access maybe 14 days or 20 days.\n\n251\n00:13:41.582 --> 00:13:47.024\nBut then again this is something your\ncompany decides that they put into place.\n\n252\n00:13:47.024 --> 00:13:52.490\nAnd some of these things are changing some\nof the best practices, that we've used for\n\n253\n00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:56.360\nyears and years, are actually changing as\nwe speak but, we do wanna go into there.\n\n254\n00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.260\nWe're gonna focus on what's needed for\nthe exam, so,\n\n255\n00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.800\na minimum password age, the default\nis one day, maximum password age,\n\n256\n00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.630\ndefault is gonna be 42 days, all right.\n\n257\n00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.330\nNext one on the list, this one again,\n\n258\n00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:13.070\nis a pretty self-explanatory one,\nminimum password length.\n\n259\n00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:16.360\nWhich means how long does your\npassword have to be, all right, or\n\n260\n00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:20.730\nreally what it's defining is,\nwhat is the shortest my password can be.\n\n261\n00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:22.630\nThe default is seven characters, so\n\n262\n00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:26.250\nthat your password has to be at\nleast seven characters long.\n\n263\n00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:29.640\nI will tell you that that's a little low,\nmost companies will set that to eight,\n\n264\n00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:32.980\nif not nine or ten nowadays.\n\n265\n00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:36.637\nBecause seven is considered a pretty weak\npassword, because computers are getting\n\n266\n00:14:36.637 --> 00:14:39.530\nbetter and better, and faster and\nfaster at breaking passwords.\n\n267\n00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:42.819\nSo we make it longer and longer,\nso that it takes longer and\n\n268\n00:14:42.819 --> 00:14:44.848\nlonger to try to break, all right.\n\n269\n00:14:44.848 --> 00:14:48.574\nAgain, something your company\nis going to decide, you know,\n\n270\n00:14:48.574 --> 00:14:51.188\nthe max on this, I can't change it here.\n\n271\n00:14:51.188 --> 00:14:58.329\nLet's see if it says on the explanation,\n14, is the max that I can set that there,\n\n272\n00:14:58.329 --> 00:15:03.172\nas far as the,\nnow that doesn't make a maximum, right.\n\n273\n00:15:03.172 --> 00:15:06.269\nThat's the largest minimum,\nthat I can set,\n\n274\n00:15:06.269 --> 00:15:11.045\nI can't set a minimum password\nlength of say 25, but I could do 14.\n\n275\n00:15:11.045 --> 00:15:12.922\n14 is on the extreme side,\n\n276\n00:15:12.922 --> 00:15:18.125\nif your admins make you have a\n14-character password, I'm sorry for you.\n\n277\n00:15:18.125 --> 00:15:20.230\n[LAUGH] That is an awfully long password,\n\n278\n00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:22.620\nespecially if you have to\nchange it every so often.\n\n279\n00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:26.900\nBut that's what minimum password length\nis, and again, you really wanna keep that\n\n280\n00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:31.270\nat least eight or nine, I think is\nwhat most people will say nowadays.\n\n281\n00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:37.260\nThe next one is password must\nmeet complexity requirements,\n\n282\n00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.170\nand this is one that will take\na little bit of explanation here.\n\n283\n00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:44.150\nWe have to understand what complexity\nis in the first place and then we can\n\n284\n00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:47.180\ntalk about what Microsoft means by\ncomplexity requirements, all right.\n\n285\n00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:49.570\nWhen you make a password,\n\n286\n00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:53.350\nthere's four character sets that you\ncan use to create your password.\n\n287\n00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:57.382\nThere's lowercase letters,\n26 possibilities, right, A through Z,\n\n288\n00:15:57.382 --> 00:16:01.293\nthere's uppercase letters,\n26 possibilities again, A through Z.\n\n289\n00:16:01.293 --> 00:16:04.801\nNumbers, there's zero through nine,\nso ten possibilities.\n\n290\n00:16:04.801 --> 00:16:06.302\nAnd the special characters.\n\n291\n00:16:06.302 --> 00:16:09.159\nThese are know things like\nampersand an exclamation point.\n\n292\n00:16:09.159 --> 00:16:11.117\nAnd there's about 30 or\n\n293\n00:16:11.117 --> 00:16:16.458\n32 special characters that you can\nuse in your password, all right.\n\n294\n00:16:16.458 --> 00:16:18.050\nSo those are the four\ndifferent character sets.\n\n295\n00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:23.190\nWhat complexity does,\nas far as Microsoft is concerned,\n\n296\n00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:24.920\nremember this is a Microsoft thing.\n\n297\n00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:27.860\nWhen Microsoft says,\nuse complex passwords,\n\n298\n00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:29.855\nwhich is what we're doing\nwhen we say enabled,\n\n299\n00:16:29.855 --> 00:16:35.090\npasswords must meet complexity\nrequirements, we're enabling complexity.\n\n300\n00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:39.790\nYour password has to contain\nthree of the four character sets.\n\n301\n00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:42.100\nNow, it can be any combination you choose.\n\n302\n00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.620\nBut three of the four character sets\nhave to be represented in your password.\n\n303\n00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:49.390\nSo your password can be a combination of\nupper case, lower case, and numbers, or\n\n304\n00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:52.690\nlower case, numbers and\nspecial characters, or numbers and\n\n305\n00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:54.720\nspecial characters and upper case.\n\n306\n00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.930\nRight, as long as three of the four.\n\n307\n00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:57.030\nAnd you can use all four.\n\n308\n00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:59.740\nYour password can be upper case and\nlower case and numbers and\n\n309\n00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:02.350\nspecial characters,\nthat'd be even better, right.\n\n310\n00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:07.196\nBut at the minimum it has to have three\nof the character sets represented\n\n311\n00:17:07.196 --> 00:17:08.502\nin that password.\n\n312\n00:17:08.502 --> 00:17:13.130\nAnd the idea is that prevents somebody\nfrom doing password all lower case or\n\n313\n00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:18.199\n1234567, because there is no letters,\nthere is no special characters,\n\n314\n00:17:18.199 --> 00:17:21.990\nit's not gonna meet the complexity\nrequirements, right.\n\n315\n00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:26.730\nAnd those two settings right there,\npassword minimum length and\n\n316\n00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:31.550\ncomplexity requirements,\nthose are the ones that really guide\n\n317\n00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:37.090\nour users or make sure that our users\nare doing good, strong passwords.\n\n318\n00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:39.430\nBecause the longer the password is,\n\n319\n00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:42.330\nthe stronger the password is going to be,\nright.\n\n320\n00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:46.610\nImagine I have a password that's only,\n\n321\n00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:52.890\nlet's say it's only two characters long\nand I'm only using numbers, right.\n\n322\n00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:54.640\nSo there's not that many possibilities.\n\n323\n00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:59.367\n0 1, 0 2, 0 all the way to 9,\n1 0, 1 1, 1 2, so\n\n324\n00:17:59.367 --> 00:18:02.560\nreally from 0 0 all the way up to 99.\n\n325\n00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.230\nSo there's only 100 possibilities, right.\n\n326\n00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:08.550\nIt's not going to take me, even if I\nwas doing that manually, I could guess,\n\n327\n00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:10.370\nI could sit here and\ntype zero zero, zero one, zero two.\n\n328\n00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:13.450\nWouldn't take me that long to go\nthrough every possibility, and\n\n329\n00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:15.570\neventually I'm going to\ncrack your password.\n\n330\n00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.593\nNow take that same password and\nmake it eight characters long,\n\n331\n00:18:18.593 --> 00:18:22.142\nstill only using numbers, but\nnow it's eight characters long, right.\n\n332\n00:18:22.142 --> 00:18:26.199\nSo, now the possible values are from zero\nzero zero zero zero zero zero zero all\n\n333\n00:18:26.199 --> 00:18:29.088\nthe way up to nine nine nine\nnine nine nine nine nine, and\n\n334\n00:18:29.088 --> 00:18:32.000\nimagine trying to go through\nevery single one of those.\n\n335\n00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.770\nNow, a computer could do that in seconds,\nso I'm not saying that's a great password.\n\n336\n00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:40.620\nI'm just trying to use that as\nan example that as you add length,\n\n337\n00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.180\nyou increase the number of possibilities.\n\n338\n00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.390\nThe more possibilities,\n\n339\n00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:48.360\nthe longer it takes the bad guy\nto try every single possibility.\n\n340\n00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.520\nAnd it's a big difference, right.\n\n341\n00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.730\nHere's the formula that\nyou can end up using.\n\n342\n00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:54.060\nI won't demonstrate this, but\n\n343\n00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.870\nif you want to write it down you\ncan try to calculate this out.\n\n344\n00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:00.590\nThere's 26 letters, lowercase,\nthere's 26 uppercase,\n\n345\n00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:03.650\nthere's 10 numbers and\nthere's 32 special characters.\n\n346\n00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:07.160\nAnd if we add all that up I want to\nsay it comes out to 96 or 97, right.\n\n347\n00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.750\n26 26 is 52, 62, 90, so yeah,\n\n348\n00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:15.846\n96 I think if it did that math right.\n\n349\n00:19:15.846 --> 00:19:16.832\n&gt;&gt; I just left you have to hang there,\n\n350\n00:19:16.832 --> 00:19:18.650\nI wanted to see how quickly\nyou can come up with that.\n\n351\n00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:20.560\n&gt;&gt; I think it's right around there, okay.\n\n352\n00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.316\nSo there is 96 possibilities per digit,\n\n353\n00:19:23.316 --> 00:19:27.450\nper character, give you upper case,\nlower case, number, special character.\n\n354\n00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:32.313\nSo if your password is 7 characters long,\nthe way to calculate how many\n\n355\n00:19:32.313 --> 00:19:36.367\npossible passwords you can\ngenerate with 7 characters and\n\n356\n00:19:36.367 --> 00:19:41.326\n96 possible characters,\nwould be 96 to the power of 7, all right.\n\n357\n00:19:41.326 --> 00:19:43.914\nIf you increased your\npassword by one character,\n\n358\n00:19:43.914 --> 00:19:46.509\nnow you're talking about\n96 to the power of 8.\n\n359\n00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:48.786\nThat's a huge difference.\n\n360\n00:19:48.786 --> 00:19:54.530\nThat's a factor, right,\nit would be 96 to the 7th times 96.\n\n361\n00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:59.390\nThat's a huge difference by just\nadding one character, right.\n\n362\n00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:03.430\nAnd that's why we say adding length\nmakes your password stronger.\n\n363\n00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:07.040\nThe other one, complexity, also does it\nbecause, you know that formula I just\n\n364\n00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:11.840\nused, 96 to the 7th, well that's\nbecause there's 96 possibilities.\n\n365\n00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:15.490\nIf you are only using numbers,\nnow there are only 10 possibilities.\n\n366\n00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:19.090\nSo that's 10 to the 7th\ninstead of 96 to the 7th,\n\n367\n00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:21.210\nthere's a big difference there too, right.\n\n368\n00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:25.170\nSo length plays a very important part\nin making your password stronger.\n\n369\n00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.362\nBut complexity also makes a very big,\n\n370\n00:20:27.362 --> 00:20:30.522\nmakes a big difference in\nhow strong your password is.\n\n371\n00:20:30.522 --> 00:20:32.810\nSo both of those very, very important.\n\n372\n00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:35.500\nAnyway, I'll get off my soapbox on\nstrong passwords cuz we're here\n\n373\n00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.930\nto learn is really more about\nhow Microsoft handles this, and\n\n374\n00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:45.080\nhow we can enforce our requirements\non our users using these policies.\n\n375\n00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.220\nThe last one,\nthe one I haven't talked about yet,\n\n376\n00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:51.460\nis this store passwords\nusing reversible encryption.\n\n377\n00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:56.170\nAnd notice this one is the only\none that by default is disabled.\n\n378\n00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:57.190\nI don't think I mentioned it but\n\n379\n00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:01.510\ncomplexity requirements are enabled\nby default in a domain environment.\n\n380\n00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:05.100\nI do think I mentioned seven\ncharacters for minimum password length.\n\n381\n00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.080\nSo this last one.\n\n382\n00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.270\nWhy is this disabled?\n\n383\n00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:08.769\nWhat the heck does this setting do?\n\n384\n00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.422\nNormally when passwords are stored,\nthey're stored in some\n\n385\n00:21:13.422 --> 00:21:16.640\nkind of secured database,\nwhether that's your local account and\n\n386\n00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:20.910\nit's stored on your local machine in\na secure portion of your hard drive.\n\n387\n00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:24.600\nOr whether that's a domain account and\nit's stored in Active Directory and\n\n388\n00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.850\nit's secured there.\n\n389\n00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:29.930\nThey're stored not as plain text.\n\n390\n00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:32.620\nIn other words, you can't go\ninto that security database and\n\n391\n00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:34.340\nsee what your password is.\n\n392\n00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:37.130\nThey're encrypted before they're\ndumped into that database.\n\n393\n00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:43.960\nSo they're stored encrypted, but it's\nnot quite like we think of encryption.\n\n394\n00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:48.790\nIt's actually done with what's known\nas a hashing algorithm, right.\n\n395\n00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:51.320\nIt's a type of encryption.\n\n396\n00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.110\nIt's a one way encryption.\n\n397\n00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:56.810\nNow I know some of you out there might be\nsaying, Mike, hashing is not an encryption\n\n398\n00:21:56.810 --> 00:22:00.770\nalgorithm because you can't reverse it and\nget the original value back out.\n\n399\n00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:01.720\nNow, I understand that.\n\n400\n00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.360\nBut I will tell you that most\npeople that talk about this\n\n401\n00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.235\nwill kind of lump hashing along\nwith other encryption algorithms.\n\n402\n00:22:07.235 --> 00:22:12.000\nCuz it is generating cypher text,\nyou just can't get it back out, all right.\n\n403\n00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.040\nSo the point of the story is, hashing\nalgorithms are algorithms that generate\n\n404\n00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:22.250\nan encrypted value but you can't reverse\nit and get the encryption back out.\n\n405\n00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:25.160\nNormally when we think of encryption,\nwe think of,\n\n406\n00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.090\nhey I'm gonna encrypt this message,\nsend it to Zach.\n\n407\n00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:31.380\nZach's gonna decrypt it to get\nthe original message back out, right.\n\n408\n00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:32.860\nThat's the whole point.\n\n409\n00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.240\nHashing algorithms are different.\n\n410\n00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.880\nThey turn it into a non\nreversible encryption.\n\n411\n00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.180\nYou can't get the original back out.\n\n412\n00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.910\nAll right, long story,\nI'm gonna try to shorten up here.\n\n413\n00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:44.180\nSo the point is,\n\n414\n00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:49.130\nwhen passwords are stored,\nthey're stored in a one way hashed value.\n\n415\n00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:50.390\nYou can't get it back out.\n\n416\n00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:55.210\nSo in other words, if somebody steals that\ndatabase that has all those passwords that\n\n417\n00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:58.530\nhave been encrypted with a hash value,\nthey can't reverse the encryption and\n\n418\n00:22:58.530 --> 00:22:59.650\nfigure out what your password is.\n\n419\n00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:02.270\nThey're gonna have to use some other\ntechnique to try to break it, and\n\n420\n00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:03.050\nthat's a good thing.\n\n421\n00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:07.210\nHowever, there are certain\napplications and\n\n422\n00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:11.070\nprotocols that need to know\nwhat your password is.\n\n423\n00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:14.540\nThey need to be able to take that\nvalue that's in the database,\n\n424\n00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:18.440\nreverse the encryption, and\nget the original password back out.\n\n425\n00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:22.100\nChallenge Handshake Authentication\nProtocol is one we always use in example.\n\n426\n00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.080\nIt's an older authentication protocol but\n\n427\n00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:30.010\nit requires a plain text version of\nyour password in order to function.\n\n428\n00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:35.520\nSo if I store the password in a one way\nencryption, CHAP cannot work any longer.\n\n429\n00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:40.380\nSo if your organization relies on CHAP,\nyou're gonna have to turn this feature on,\n\n430\n00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:43.080\nstore passwords using\nreversible encryption.\n\n431\n00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:48.720\nNow, that's a bad thing,\nI don't want to use reversible encryption.\n\n432\n00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:52.422\nThat's reducing the security of my\npasswords, but you might have to for\n\n433\n00:23:52.422 --> 00:23:53.827\nsome older applications.\n\n434\n00:23:53.827 --> 00:23:57.295\nWhat I will tell you the best practice is,\ndon't use CHAP or don't use that\n\n435\n00:23:57.295 --> 00:24:01.000\napplication that requires passwords to\nbe stored using reversal encryption.\n\n436\n00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.371\nThat is your best bet.\n\n437\n00:24:02.371 --> 00:24:06.347\nBut maybe your company's already invested\na lot of money in this program, and\n\n438\n00:24:06.347 --> 00:24:09.190\nit can't just change\nwhat program it's using.\n\n439\n00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:12.610\nSo, you can come in here and\nturn this feature on.\n\n440\n00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:16.580\nAnd now passwords will be stored in\na way that they can be reversed, and\n\n441\n00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:18.460\nthe original password can get back out.\n\n442\n00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:20.780\nJust understand that\nthat's not a good thing.\n\n443\n00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:24.430\nI'm only doing it because I have to do it,\nnot because I want do it.\n\n444\n00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:26.490\nI would prefer not to have to do that, and\n\n445\n00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:29.070\nthat's why this one is\ndisabled by default.\n\n446\n00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:32.063\nSo it's a little tricky cuz all these\nother ones are good things, and\n\n447\n00:24:32.063 --> 00:24:35.116\nwe wanna turn them on, and we wanna\nset them to the appropriate value.\n\n448\n00:24:35.116 --> 00:24:36.931\nThis one's off and you think,\nwell, why is that one off?\n\n449\n00:24:36.931 --> 00:24:39.645\nI should turn it on,\nit'll make my system securer.\n\n450\n00:24:39.645 --> 00:24:41.735\nNo, it's actually gonna\nreduce the security.\n\n451\n00:24:41.735 --> 00:24:45.485\nSo, leave that one disabled unless you\nabsolutely have to turn it back on.\n\n452\n00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:52.160\nAll right, Zach, so those are all the\ndifferent settings that we can configure.\n\n453\n00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:55.820\nThe next thing I wanna\nshow you is group policy.\n\n454\n00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:58.600\nAs I said during the beginning\nof this episode,\n\n455\n00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.400\nyou can configure these\nsettings on your local machine.\n\n456\n00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:05.300\nAnd if you're not part of a domain,\nit'll be enforced.\n\n457\n00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:09.090\nBut when you're part of domain, then it's\ngonna pull the settings from the domain.\n\n458\n00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:12.229\nAnd it's gonna ignore what you have\nlocally or, like you saw here,\n\n459\n00:25:12.229 --> 00:25:15.830\nit basically overrides my local\nsettings with the domain settings.\n\n460\n00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:19.040\nSo, let's see what they look\nlike in the domain environment.\n\n461\n00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.503\nIf we're gonna work in the domain\nenvironment, I switched over to my domain\n\n462\n00:25:22.503 --> 00:25:25.990\ncontroller, which we're gonna\ntalk about in a later episode.\n\n463\n00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:30.900\nAnd I'm gonna open up my, what's called\nmy Group Policy Management Console.\n\n464\n00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:35.590\nAll right, this is where I can\nwork with my group policies, and\n\n465\n00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:37.220\nif you're not familiar with this,\nthat's okay.\n\n466\n00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:40.050\nWe're gonna talk a little bit more about\ngroup policy in an upcoming episode.\n\n467\n00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:43.618\nAnd we've got other classes in\nthe library where we cover this in-depth.\n\n468\n00:25:43.618 --> 00:25:46.442\nBut for right now,\nI just wanna come in here and\n\n469\n00:25:46.442 --> 00:25:49.643\nshow you how to set these\npassword policy settings.\n\n470\n00:25:49.643 --> 00:25:54.903\nSo, I am gonna right-click on my Default\nDomain Policy, and I am gonna choose Edit.\n\n471\n00:25:54.903 --> 00:25:58.279\nAnd I am gonna maximize this guy,\nand zoom back out for\n\n472\n00:25:58.279 --> 00:26:00.463\na second so we can get recentered.\n\n473\n00:26:00.463 --> 00:26:04.088\nAnd I'll come back over\nhere to the left-hand side,\n\n474\n00:26:04.088 --> 00:26:07.564\nI'm gonna expand out\nPolicies &gt; Window Setting.\n\n475\n00:26:07.564 --> 00:26:10.297\nAnd I'm sorry, not Windows,\nAdministrate Template.\n\n476\n00:26:10.297 --> 00:26:12.980\nSo, Window Settings, misclick there,\n\n477\n00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:17.590\nSecurity Settings &gt;\nAccount Policies &gt; Password Policy.\n\n478\n00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:21.116\nAnd looky there, it's the exact\nsame settings, isn't it, right?\n\n479\n00:26:21.116 --> 00:26:25.140\nIf I double-click on one of these though,\nI can change them here.\n\n480\n00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:29.390\nThis is where I'm allowed to make\nthe changes to my domain settings.\n\n481\n00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:33.570\nBut they're the exact same settings, it's\njust a different place to configure them.\n\n482\n00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:38.110\nAnd when you configure them here,\nthey apply to everybody in the domain.\n\n483\n00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:40.640\nSo, I don't have to go to\nevery single machine and\n\n484\n00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:44.520\nconfigure their password policy because\nwhat did we say earlier about that?\n\n485\n00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.841\nTwo things are gonna happen, I'm lazy and\nI don't wanna go to every machine.\n\n486\n00:26:46.841 --> 00:26:48.714\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And two,\n\n487\n00:26:48.714 --> 00:26:54.175\nif I try to go to every machine, I'm gonna\nmake a typo on one or I'm gonna miss one.\n\n488\n00:26:54.175 --> 00:26:57.509\nAnd now that machine is gonna be in\nviolation of my security policy all\n\n489\n00:26:57.509 --> 00:26:59.070\nbecause I can't type, right?\n\n490\n00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:04.063\nSo, by doing it here once, I can ensure\nthe same settings are applied to all\n\n491\n00:27:04.063 --> 00:27:07.804\nthe machines in my domain and\nit'll affect everybody.\n\n492\n00:27:07.804 --> 00:27:13.237\nNow, before 2008 Server, so\nwith 2003, with Server 2000,\n\n493\n00:27:13.237 --> 00:27:17.476\nthere was only one place in\nthe domain to set the policies.\n\n494\n00:27:17.476 --> 00:27:19.537\nAnd that's what I'm showing\nyou right here, and\n\n495\n00:27:19.537 --> 00:27:21.563\nthat policy applied to\neverybody in the domain.\n\n496\n00:27:21.563 --> 00:27:26.373\nWhether you were just a standard user,\nor whether you were the domain admin,\n\n497\n00:27:26.373 --> 00:27:28.893\nthe same policy applied to you, right?\n\n498\n00:27:28.893 --> 00:27:34.005\nThat's not the best idea though,\nbecause my end users, I don't want them\n\n499\n00:27:34.005 --> 00:27:39.380\nto have to use 15 character passwords and\nchange them every seven days.\n\n500\n00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:44.750\nAnd in the end their accounts don't have\nthe same access as my domain admins.\n\n501\n00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:48.908\nDomain admins, however, I want them\nto use really long passwords, and\n\n502\n00:27:48.908 --> 00:27:52.535\nI want them to change them a lot\nmore often than my normal users.\n\n503\n00:27:52.535 --> 00:27:55.409\nBecause if somebody compromises\nthe domain admin account,\n\n504\n00:27:55.409 --> 00:27:58.600\nthey have full control of everything\nin my entire domain, right?\n\n505\n00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:01.072\nSo, that'd be a very bad day for\nus if somebody broke that.\n\n506\n00:28:01.072 --> 00:28:03.925\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So ideally, I could set different\n\n507\n00:28:03.925 --> 00:28:09.060\npolicies for administrative accounts\nversus standard user accounts.\n\n508\n00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:14.550\nOr the guys in the Dev team, they\naccess company proprietary information.\n\n509\n00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:16.920\nSo if somebody compromises\none of their accounts,\n\n510\n00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.130\nthere could be espionage going on.\n\n511\n00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:21.130\nThey could steal company secrets that\nwe're gonna be making money with.\n\n512\n00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:23.280\nSell it to somebody else, and\nthey put it out first, and\n\n513\n00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.700\nwe go out of business, right?\n\n514\n00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:26.860\nSo their accounts are more sensitive then,\nsay,\n\n515\n00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:30.842\nthe person at the front desk, because\nthey access some proprietary information.\n\n516\n00:28:30.842 --> 00:28:33.810\nI'd want them to use longer,\nstronger passwords, than I do for\n\n517\n00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:35.970\nthe person at the front desk, right?\n\n518\n00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:41.640\nBut prior to 2008, you couldn't do it,\neverybody had to follow the same rules.\n\n519\n00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:44.216\nSo, you had to set something\nthat was strong enough for\n\n520\n00:28:44.216 --> 00:28:47.584\nyour administrator accounts, and\neverybody else just had to suffer.\n\n521\n00:28:47.584 --> 00:28:50.913\nNow, or the other route,\nwhich is what most companies did,\n\n522\n00:28:50.913 --> 00:28:54.507\nwas they set a policy that was\nconvenient for their other users and\n\n523\n00:28:54.507 --> 00:28:57.923\ntheir domain accounts were now\nnot as secure because of that.\n\n524\n00:28:57.923 --> 00:29:03.244\nStarting with 2008 we get something\nknown as Password Settings Containers.\n\n525\n00:29:03.244 --> 00:29:09.659\nAnd we can actually set policies based on\nwhere your account is in Active Directory.\n\n526\n00:29:09.659 --> 00:29:12.220\nNow, again,\nwe haven't gone over Active Directory, so\n\n527\n00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:15.000\nI know that might sound a little odd,\nand that's okay.\n\n528\n00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.670\nFor this exam, we don't have to know how\nto create password setting objects, or\n\n529\n00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:21.200\npassword setting containers.\n\n530\n00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:25.750\nAll we need to know at this point,\nis starting with 2008 and\n\n531\n00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:31.650\ncontinuing on to 2012 and 2016, we can\nnow have multiple password policies.\n\n532\n00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:33.200\nWe're not stuck with just one.\n\n533\n00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:37.420\nSo I can do things like, hey, the\nadministrators, 15 character passwords,\n\n534\n00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:39.260\nchange them every seven days.\n\n535\n00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:43.540\nDev team, 14 character passwords,\nchange them every 14 days.\n\n536\n00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:47.673\nStandard users, eight character passwords,\nchange them every 30 days.\n\n537\n00:29:47.673 --> 00:29:52.391\nWe can now do that thanks to the settings\nthat became available starting in 2008,\n\n538\n00:29:52.391 --> 00:29:53.056\nall right?\n\n539\n00:29:53.056 --> 00:29:56.907\nAnd that's what they might ask you on\nthe exam is can you have more than one\n\n540\n00:29:56.907 --> 00:29:57.928\npassword policy?\n\n541\n00:29:57.928 --> 00:30:01.012\nWell, if they tell you, hey,\nyou're an administrator for a network and\n\n542\n00:30:01.012 --> 00:30:03.670\nyou're running Server 2003\non your domain controllers.\n\n543\n00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:07.640\nYou wanna set multiple password\npolicies for your user accounts.\n\n544\n00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.405\nWhat would your first step be?\n\n545\n00:30:09.405 --> 00:30:12.868\nWell, your first step is gonna\nhave to be upgrade to 2008.\n\n546\n00:30:12.868 --> 00:30:16.370\nThey'll try to trick you and say, look,\nfirst you're gonna right-click and\n\n547\n00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:17.070\nmake a setting.\n\n548\n00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:20.320\nNo, no, no, no,\nthe first step is to upgrade to 2008.\n\n549\n00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:24.770\nAgain, on this exam they're not gonna\nget you with the details of creating it.\n\n550\n00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:27.670\nBut they could ask you what would\nyou need to do to use these, right?\n\n551\n00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:32.151\nAnd you need to know that they\nstarted in 2008 and continued on.\n\n552\n00:30:32.151 --> 00:30:36.912\nAll right, last thing we're gonna talk\nabout here is going to be reset procedures\n\n553\n00:30:36.912 --> 00:30:39.535\nand protecting those domain user accounts.\n\n554\n00:30:39.535 --> 00:30:43.524\nAnd as far as resetting goes,\nyou simply go into Active Directory, and\n\n555\n00:30:43.524 --> 00:30:46.410\nyou right-click on the account and\nchoose Reset.\n\n556\n00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:48.840\nSo, let me show you a demonstration here.\n\n557\n00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:51.610\nI'm gonna open up the Active Directory\n&gt; Users Computer Console.\n\n558\n00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:57.314\nI know it's a little small, I'll zoom in\nas soon as I navigate into a useful area.\n\n559\n00:30:57.314 --> 00:31:00.922\nAnd I'm gonna find, where is that account,\nlet's just make a new account so\n\n560\n00:31:00.922 --> 00:31:02.154\nI don't goof anybody up.\n\n561\n00:31:02.154 --> 00:31:06.779\nI'm gonna make one for myself,\nand we'll say, Mike, oops,\n\n562\n00:31:06.779 --> 00:31:09.085\nI can't type my own last name.\n\n563\n00:31:09.085 --> 00:31:11.234\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There's an r in it.\n\n564\n00:31:11.234 --> 00:31:14.458\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] right,\nset my password real quick.\n\n565\n00:31:17.608 --> 00:31:20.993\nAll right, so if I wanna reason,\nlet's say a user calls me up and\n\n566\n00:31:20.993 --> 00:31:23.780\nsays, hey, I forgot my password,\nI can't log in.\n\n567\n00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:25.628\nWell, they gonna call the help desk and\n\n568\n00:31:25.628 --> 00:31:28.104\nwhat the help desk is gonna\nneed to do is come in here.\n\n569\n00:31:28.104 --> 00:31:31.558\nRight-click on that user account,\nand choose Reset Password,\n\n570\n00:31:31.558 --> 00:31:33.077\nit's that simple, right?\n\n571\n00:31:33.077 --> 00:31:39.208\nAnd it's gonna give me a notice, I don't\neven need to know what their password was.\n\n572\n00:31:39.208 --> 00:31:42.529\nThis is why we always say nobody\nwill ever ask you for your password,\n\n573\n00:31:42.529 --> 00:31:44.190\ndon't give it to them.\n\n574\n00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:48.920\nAll I do is type in their new password,\nTwice, oops.\n\n575\n00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.825\nAnd let me make it different\nfrom what I just set.\n\n576\n00:31:50.825 --> 00:31:56.578\nSay password1, And\n\n577\n00:31:56.578 --> 00:32:02.760\nuser must change password next logon is\ngrayed out because I can't change that.\n\n578\n00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:07.950\nUnlock user account, you know, we didn't\neven go over the Account Lockout settings.\n\n579\n00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:08.720\nI almost forgot about that.\n\n580\n00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.422\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a couple\nof things we need to cover.\n\n581\n00:32:10.422 --> 00:32:11.194\n&gt;&gt; Shoot, all right.\n\n582\n00:32:11.194 --> 00:32:12.834\n&gt;&gt; Maybe we can do a part two.\n\n583\n00:32:12.834 --> 00:32:13.399\n&gt;&gt; I tell you what, I'll go ahead and\n\n584\n00:32:13.399 --> 00:32:14.187\nreset this password, and\nwe'll do a part two.\n\n585\n00:32:14.187 --> 00:32:14.811\n&gt;&gt; Let's do a part two.\n\n586\n00:32:14.811 --> 00:32:18.663\n&gt;&gt; So, resetting it here,\nI'd simply click OK, right?\n\n587\n00:32:18.663 --> 00:32:22.426\nAnd now I would tell the user what\ntheir password was changed to.\n\n588\n00:32:22.426 --> 00:32:26.216\nThe first time they log in it's gonna say,\nhey, your password was changed,\n\n589\n00:32:26.216 --> 00:32:28.681\nyou need to set it to\nsomething that only you know.\n\n590\n00:32:28.681 --> 00:32:30.140\nWhat would you like it to be?\n\n591\n00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:33.180\nSo that's how easy it is\nto reset a user password.\n\n592\n00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:33.790\n&gt;&gt; It was easy.\n\n593\n00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:36.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Zach, you are right,\nwe are gonna need a part two for this.\n\n594\n00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.754\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna need a part two.\n\n595\n00:32:36.754 --> 00:32:39.937\nBut that's okay because\nMTA Security Fundamentals and\n\n596\n00:32:39.937 --> 00:32:43.399\nwe're looking at password policies,\nthere's a lot here.\n\n597\n00:32:43.399 --> 00:32:46.334\nAnd now having a part two,\nwe'll have a part one, we have part two.\n\n598\n00:32:46.334 --> 00:32:49.859\nWe can take them from the library,\nwatch them whenever we like,\n\n599\n00:32:49.859 --> 00:32:52.980\nwhich is one of the beautiful\nthings about ITProTV.\n\n600\n00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:53.880\nMike, great job.\n\n601\n00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:54.410\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n602\n00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:58.070\n&gt;&gt; So, there'll be a part two, passwords\npolicies, make sure you catch that.\n\n603\n00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:03.930\nYou are watching ITProTV,\nan ITPro is always learning, yes they are.\n\n604\n00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:04.980\nAnd I'm Zach Memos.\n\n605\n00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:05.800\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n606\n00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:08.628\n&gt;&gt; And we'll catch you next time.\n\n607\n00:33:08.628 --> 00:33:14.543\n[MUSIC]\n\n608\n00:33:14.543 --> 00:33:17.991\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:12.320\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.300\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for choosing ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.670\nI'm your host Zach Memos, we continue\non with MTA Security Fundamentals.\n\n6\n00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.400\nAnd this'll be part two of\nour passwords policies and\n\n7\n00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.590\nyour leader in this Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.150\nAnd thanks for being back here Mike.\n\n9\n00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.080\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n10\n00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.190\nI'm excited as always.\n\n11\n00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.540\nAnd yeah we have a little bit more\nto talk about when it comes to our\n\n12\n00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.520\nPassword policy.\n\n13\n00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.810\nSo we'll just dive right back in.\n\n14\n00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.260\nThere wasn't much more.\n\n15\n00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.680\nI just didn't wanna rush through it there\nat the end, cuz it is important stuff.\n\n16\n00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.090\n&gt;&gt; Say, Mr. Connor.\n\n17\n00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.640\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n18\n00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.030\nwhen we're talking about password resets,\n\n19\n00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.230\nprocedures, I think we could talk\na little bit more about that, don't you?\n\n20\n00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:51.980\nI do, Ido\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n21\n00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.750\n&gt;&gt; So lets jump back over\nto my domain controller.\n\n22\n00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.490\nSo in the previous episode I showed you we\n\n23\n00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.850\ncould just right click on\nthe account in Active Directory.\n\n24\n00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.090\nSo if you are working as a help desk or\nyour the IT staff for your entire company.\n\n25\n00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.200\nYou simply go into\nActive Directory Users and Computers.\n\n26\n00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.217\nNow Active Directory even though\nwe have not gone over it yet,\n\n27\n00:01:11.217 --> 00:01:13.373\nwe have another episode dedicated to this.\n\n28\n00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:18.140\nFor right now, lets just quickly say this\nis that database where we store those\n\n29\n00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.450\npasswords, right?\n\n30\n00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.000\nWe talk about how passwords get\nstored using a hashing algorithm or\n\n31\n00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.450\none way encryption.\n\n32\n00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.860\nThis is where they get stored,\nis in the Active Directory database.\n\n33\n00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.000\nThis is where everything for\nyour domain gets stored basically\n\n34\n00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.520\nincluding your user accounts and your\ncomputer accounts and things like that.\n\n35\n00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.480\nBut back to the point that\nwe were coming in here for.\n\n36\n00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.550\nSo what I can do is find that user\naccount, that's called me up and\n\n37\n00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.630\nsay look I forgot my password,\ncould you please reset it for me?\n\n38\n00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.140\nAnd you simply right-click on that\naccount, and choose Reset Password, and\n\n39\n00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.300\nyou type in a temporary password, right?\n\n40\n00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.670\nSomething that they can use temporarily.\n\n41\n00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.880\nSo you say, hey, okay.\n\n42\n00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.770\nI've got your password reset,\nit's password12345,\n\n43\n00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.490\nbut I need you to go ahead and login and\nchange that immediately, right?\n\n44\n00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.450\nAnd then they'll login and\nthe system will prompt them and\n\n45\n00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.370\nsay hey you need to change your\npassword please do so now.\n\n46\n00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.700\nAll right, so\nthat's one way you can reset the password.\n\n47\n00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.430\nThe other one is not really a reset\nI guess but it is good to know.\n\n48\n00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.430\nOne, we can use PowerShell to do this.\n\n49\n00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.730\nBut the user can change their\npassword anytime they want right,\n\n50\n00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.850\nthey can always just do a Ctrl Alt Delete\nand change their password.\n\n51\n00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.060\nSo not much of a reset as much of a,\nwhat if the user wants to be proactive?\n\n52\n00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.150\nWhat if I'm sitting here typing in my\npassword and I look over my shoulder and\n\n53\n00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.890\nthere's Zach staring at my keyboard?\n\n54\n00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.240\nI'm thinking okay,\nhe just watched me type my password in.\n\n55\n00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.990\n&gt;&gt; Which I do often, by the way.\n\n56\n00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.250\nStare over his shoulder,\nright at his keyboard, every day.\n\n57\n00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.660\n&gt;&gt; And it's amazing, the guy,\nhe can restate the last 27 keys I typed.\n\n58\n00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.030\nI've never seen anybody like him.\n\n59\n00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.520\nSo, now, as soon as Zach walks away,\nI wanna change my password.\n\n60\n00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.040\nI don't have to call the help desk and\nsay,\n\n61\n00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.130\nhey look I think Zach saw my password,\ncan you reset it for me?\n\n62\n00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.170\nBecause I still know my password,\nI just wanna change it.\n\n63\n00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.810\nSo simply do a Ctrl Alt Delete and that's\nwere I get a link for change password.\n\n64\n00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.540\nAnd it allow me to type in my old\npassword, my new password twice and\n\n65\n00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.200\nI can click Confirm.\n\n66\n00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.250\nAnd it'll update my password, so\n\n67\n00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.210\nits really more an update than a reset,\nbut I did want to show you where that was.\n\n68\n00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.910\n&gt;&gt; Can we talk about account lockout?\n\n69\n00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.860\nNow you've mentioned it a couple of\ntimes and in basic you've tried three\n\n70\n00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.810\ntimes that's it, that's all you get,\nI'm locking you out.\n\n71\n00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.120\nThere's, I'm sure, a lot more to it.\n\n72\n00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.490\n&gt;&gt; There's a little bit more to it.\n\n73\n00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.760\nWe saw it when I pulled up this account,\nwhen I was gonna go Reset the Password,\n\n74\n00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.080\nthere was a check mark here that said,\ndo you want to unlock the user account?\n\n75\n00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.230\nNow what that's referring to is,\nremember in our previous episode,\n\n76\n00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.680\nwe went through a bunch\nof security settings.\n\n77\n00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.940\nAnd one of the things I\ndidn't talk about yet\n\n78\n00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.640\nwas the account lockout policy settings.\n\n79\n00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.840\nSo remember this little check mark and\nit will make sense as I go thorough this.\n\n80\n00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.410\nThis is where you would unlock it.\n\n81\n00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.600\nLet's go look at the account\nlockout settings and\n\n82\n00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.640\nI will explain what it does for us.\n\n83\n00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.025\nI know I kinda did this a little\nbit backwards but that's okay.\n\n84\n00:04:13.025 --> 00:04:13.620\n&gt;&gt; That's all right.\n\n85\n00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.170\n&gt;&gt; We can always go back and\nwatch that part one again.\n\n86\n00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.620\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna\ngo back in that default domain policy.\n\n87\n00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.120\nThis is my Group Policy Management Editor.\n\n88\n00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.250\nAnd same location where we were\nsetting all of those password policies\n\n89\n00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.390\nwas Computer &gt; Policies &gt;\nWindow Settings &gt; Security Settings.\n\n90\n00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:37.800\nAnd then the Account Policy and\nwe went into our Password Policy, right.\n\n91\n00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.700\nThat's we're all those settings\nthat we were talking about was.\n\n92\n00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.700\nBut what I forgot to do is\ngo down to the next category\n\n93\n00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.370\nwhich was the Account Lockout Policy.\n\n94\n00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.800\nLet's take a look at\nwhat those settings are.\n\n95\n00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.348\nSo as Zach said, that's exactly right.\n\n96\n00:04:51.348 --> 00:04:54.660\nThey account lockout\njust as the way I can say\n\n97\n00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.920\nif the wrong password is entered too many\ntimes, we're gonna lock the account out.\n\n98\n00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.790\nWe're gonna lock the account so\nthat nobody can use it anymore.\n\n99\n00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.790\nThat's what these\nsettings are going to do.\n\n100\n00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.870\nSo there's three settings\nthat I can configure.\n\n101\n00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.360\nTwo of them are not defined by default.\n\n102\n00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.520\nThe third one is set to zero by default,\nso these are the default settings.\n\n103\n00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.680\nWe're gonna start with the middle one,\n\n104\n00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.620\nthe one that says zero because this is the\nfirst one that you're going to configure.\n\n105\n00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.040\nAccount lockout threshold, when it is set\nto zero, that means there is no threshold.\n\n106\n00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.840\nYou can guess the wrong password\n150 times and it's not gonna care.\n\n107\n00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.930\n&gt;&gt; And that is not ideal.\n\n108\n00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.060\n&gt;&gt; That is not because that means\nthe bad guy can sit there and guess and\n\n109\n00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.400\nguess and guess all day long with no\nfear of locking the account out, right.\n\n110\n00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.849\nSo we're gonna set that to a value and\nI'm gonna go ahead and double click on it.\n\n111\n00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.170\nAnd I'll pull these settings over here\nwhere we can see them a little better.\n\n112\n00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.993\nAnd you'll see that I can define this\npolicy settings, that means turn it on.\n\n113\n00:05:54.993 --> 00:05:58.439\nAnd then I can set a value here and\nlets just,\n\n114\n00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:03.201\nlets go check the explained cuz\nI forgot the maximum on this.\n\n115\n00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:09.161\n999 is the maximum for that one, so\nanywhere from zero to 999 If I set\n\n116\n00:06:09.161 --> 00:06:14.370\nit to ten, that means ten bad tries and\nthe account gets locked.\n\n117\n00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.200\n999 would mean you can try 999 times,\nand the account would be locked.\n\n118\n00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.470\n&gt;&gt; So, there is no default?\n\n119\n00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:21.470\nWindows doesn't give you a default?\n\n120\n00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:26.220\n&gt;&gt; The default is zero, which means no\nthey don't care how many times you guess.\n\n121\n00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.550\nThat is going to be our default setting.\n\n122\n00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.840\nAnd then the other two settings\n\n123\n00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.480\nreally depend on the first one\nbecause account lockout duration.\n\n124\n00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.570\nOnce the account becomes locked,\nhow long does it stay locked, right?\n\n125\n00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.095\nWell, the setting of zero it\nwill never become locked so\n\n126\n00:06:44.095 --> 00:06:47.645\nit does not matter how long it will stay\nlocked that's why it says not defined.\n\n127\n00:06:47.645 --> 00:06:53.035\nThe one at the bottom there Reset\naccount lockout counter after,\n\n128\n00:06:53.035 --> 00:06:57.557\nthis is how long does it\nremember the failed attempts?\n\n129\n00:06:57.557 --> 00:07:00.832\nIn other words let's\nsay we set that value,\n\n130\n00:07:00.832 --> 00:07:05.789\none the value doesn't matter\nbecause right now it's set to zero,\n\n131\n00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:09.256\nwhich means your account\nwill never lock out.\n\n132\n00:07:09.256 --> 00:07:13.390\nBut let's say we set that to three\nattempts, and we lock your account.\n\n133\n00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.743\nSo you come in at 8 o'clock in the\nmorning, and you mistype your password.\n\n134\n00:07:16.743 --> 00:07:19.750\nYou haven't had your coffee yet,\nyou get woke up.\n\n135\n00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:20.390\nAnd you type it in.\n\n136\n00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:21.920\nWell that's strike one, right?\n\n137\n00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.870\nThat's one bad attempt and then you typed\nit in right and went about your day.\n\n138\n00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:30.150\nYou go to lunch, maybe its Friday and\nyou have a couple of martinis and\n\n139\n00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.660\nyou come back from lunch,\nnot driving of course.\n\n140\n00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.000\n&gt;&gt; Nobody ever does that,\nthat doesn't happen.\n\n141\n00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.610\n&gt;&gt; And you mistype your password again.\n\n142\n00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.290\nIs that strike two?\n\n143\n00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.230\nIs that your second failed attempt or\nis that strike one?\n\n144\n00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:46.960\nWell, it depends on this last setting.\n\n145\n00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.600\nHow long does it remember?\n\n146\n00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.492\nReset the account.\n\n147\n00:07:49.492 --> 00:07:54.225\nSo it's gonna reset, forget about\nyour bad attempts at some point.\n\n148\n00:07:54.225 --> 00:07:58.227\nSo if we reset that to one hour,\nyou've mistyped it at breakfast,\n\n149\n00:07:58.227 --> 00:07:59.589\nthat was 8 o'clock.\n\n150\n00:07:59.589 --> 00:08:01.777\nHour it forgets about that.\n\n151\n00:08:01.777 --> 00:08:04.620\nSo the one after lunch,\nwould be strike one again, right?\n\n152\n00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.850\nCuz it already forgot about\nthe one this morning.\n\n153\n00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:11.890\nIf I set that 24 hours, you got one\nstrike at 8 o'clock, you strike\n\n154\n00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:16.570\nagain at lunch, that's strike two, cuz it\nstill remembers the one from breakfast or\n\n155\n00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.340\nfrom 8 o'clock in the morning, right?\n\n156\n00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.590\nSo that's what that one is.\n\n157\n00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:23.045\nHow long does it remember\nyour failed attempts.\n\n158\n00:08:23.045 --> 00:08:24.200\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n159\n00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.940\nSo to start this off, you double-click\non the account lockout threshold.\n\n160\n00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:28.920\nYou set that first.\n\n161\n00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:33.500\nAnd we are going to set that to five,\nright?\n\n162\n00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.915\nNow this is something again that your\norganization, I'll go ahead and click OK.\n\n163\n00:08:37.915 --> 00:08:41.362\nBut before I click OK, let me finish\nexplaining it cuz another dialog box is\n\n164\n00:08:41.362 --> 00:08:43.955\ngonna pop-up as soon as I click OK.\n\n165\n00:08:43.955 --> 00:08:48.099\nThis number, what do you set it to,\n0-99 are my possible values.\n\n166\n00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.440\nThis is something that every organisation\ndiffers on what they wanna set this to.\n\n167\n00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:59.080\nI will tell you as best practice,\ndo not set this too low.\n\n168\n00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.165\nBecause you think you're gonna\nincrease your security and\n\n169\n00:09:02.165 --> 00:09:04.530\nyou end up doing just the opposite.\n\n170\n00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:10.150\nIf I set this to five, it's actually\na little low, three is pretty darn low,\n\n171\n00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.622\nhow many times have you mistyped\nyour password accidentally?\n\n172\n00:09:12.622 --> 00:09:16.410\nJust fat-fingered the keyboard, you know\ntalking to somebody while you're typing\n\n173\n00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:20.230\nand then you mistype it,\nits gonna happen now and again.\n\n174\n00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:24.000\nIf I set this to two attempts and\nwe lock your account, my\n\n175\n00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.330\nhelp desk is gonna get calls all day long-\n&gt;&gt; They won't like that.\n\n176\n00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:28.900\n&gt;&gt; For unlocking passwords.\n\n177\n00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.520\nYes, they're not gonna like it,\nand there's no reason to.\n\n178\n00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.790\nIt's not a bad guy trying to get in.\n\n179\n00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:37.970\nIt's a legitimate user that I want\nto log in and do their job and\n\n180\n00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:39.290\nmake my company money.\n\n181\n00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:43.140\nSo by me preventing them from logging in,\nthat's not a good thing, right?\n\n182\n00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:48.300\nYou know what they are gonna do is they're\ngonna try to use much simpler passwords,\n\n183\n00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:52.170\nthey are probably gonna write them more\noften so that they don't mistype them.\n\n184\n00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:53.800\nYou end up generating more work and\n\n185\n00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.710\nreducing security by setting\nthat number too low.\n\n186\n00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:59.420\nSo, pick a number that makes sense for\nyour organisation.\n\n187\n00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.460\nA lot of military posts\nthey haven't set the three.\n\n188\n00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.690\nBut that's one of those\nhigh-security areas.\n\n189\n00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:10.150\nI can't take a chance on somebody guessing\npasswords and breaking into an account and\n\n190\n00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.980\nhaving access to my governmental\nmilitary computers.\n\n191\n00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.750\nSo they keep that number really,\nreally low.\n\n192\n00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:18.880\nI'll tell you in the private\nsector though, in most businesses,\n\n193\n00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:23.230\nten is not an unreasonable number,\nit's still gonna keep your system safe.\n\n194\n00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:28.910\nWhat are the odds of the bad guy guessing\nyour password in his first ten guesses?\n\n195\n00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:30.150\nPretty slim, right?\n\n196\n00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.890\n&gt;&gt; Very slim.\n\n197\n00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.810\n&gt;&gt; He's gonna have to brute force it or\ndo a dictionary attack and\n\n198\n00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:37.730\nrifle through hundreds and thousands\nof words before he gets your password.\n\n199\n00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:41.200\nSo if it's set to ten,\nhe's gonna lock it out in a second and\n\n200\n00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.700\nhe's not gonna be able to try any more.\n\n201\n00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:47.300\nBut how many times is a legitimate user\ngoing to mistype their password ten\n\n202\n00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.150\ntimes in a row?\n\n203\n00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:52.667\nHopefully not that often\nunless we need to have another\n\n204\n00:10:52.667 --> 00:10:57.680\nconversation with them about how many\nmartinis they're drinking at lunch.\n\n205\n00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.380\nSo that's the goal,\nto find that balance point there.\n\n206\n00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.900\nI don't wanna go too low because\nthat makes more work for us.\n\n207\n00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.850\nBut I don't wanna go too high because\nthat prevents the setting from doing\n\n208\n00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:09.490\nanything useful, all right?\n\n209\n00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:12.370\nSo figure out what it is your\norganization wants to do.\n\n210\n00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:16.840\nNow I'm gonna click OK and\nanother dialog box pops up.\n\n211\n00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:17.401\nAnd it says,\n\n212\n00:11:17.401 --> 00:11:20.516\nwait a second, if you're gonna turn\non the account lockout threshold,\n\n213\n00:11:20.516 --> 00:11:24.003\nnow those other two settings that were\nnot defined, now they need to be defined.\n\n214\n00:11:24.003 --> 00:11:30.055\nBecause, all of a sudden, they come into\nplay because my account can be locked,\n\n215\n00:11:30.055 --> 00:11:32.800\nin my case, at five attempts.\n\n216\n00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.580\nSo if it does become locked,\nhow long is it gonna stay locked?\n\n217\n00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:41.130\nThe default, as you can see here,\nis 30 minutes, account lock out duration,\n\n218\n00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:42.530\n30 minutes by default.\n\n219\n00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.690\nIt's going to remember\nmy badge strikes for\n\n220\n00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:51.320\n30 minutes, so both of those\nvalues default to 30 minutes.\n\n221\n00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.190\nYou can change them to whatever you want.\n\n222\n00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:57.880\nNotice what it says at the top\nthere: Suggested Value Changes.\n\n223\n00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.590\nMicrosoft is doing that basically\nbecause once you set the threshold,\n\n224\n00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:03.370\nthey need to be set to something.\n\n225\n00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.960\nSo it says,\nhey I'll just set them to 30 minutes.\n\n226\n00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.690\nNow once I've set that I can\nsimply go in here and change that.\n\n227\n00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:14.100\nIf 30 minutes doesn't work for me,\nthen I can change it to whatever I want.\n\n228\n00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.660\nIt is in minutes so\nyou do have to calculate that out.\n\n229\n00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:21.300\nIf you want it to remain locked for\nthree hours, you have to come in here and\n\n230\n00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:25.990\ntype in 180 minutes, or\nwhatever the case might be.\n\n231\n00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:29.640\nYou can set this to zero.\n\n232\n00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.170\nThat's kind of odd, right.\n\n233\n00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:33.060\nWait a second.\n\n234\n00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.810\nYou're gonna lock the account after five\nattempts, and it's gonna remain locked for\n\n235\n00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:38.550\nzero minutes?\n\n236\n00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.550\nNo, it's kind of a trick.\n\n237\n00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:45.490\nNot a trick, but it's confusing,\nI guess is a good way to say it.\n\n238\n00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:49.850\nIf you set it to zero, what you're\nactually saying is stay locked forever.\n\n239\n00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:53.310\nRather than automatically\nunlock after 30 minutes.\n\n240\n00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:57.410\nWill automatically unlock after three\nhours, I want you to stay locked and\n\n241\n00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:58.830\nnever unlock automatically.\n\n242\n00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:02.064\nThat might seem kinda odd but\n\n243\n00:13:02.064 --> 00:13:06.250\nthat's actually a good setting in most\nsecure environments, they'll set this to\n\n244\n00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:11.910\nzero, because what that forces the user to\ndo is they can't just sit there and wait.\n\n245\n00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:15.650\nMost users, if they lock their account,\nthey're embarrassed.\n\n246\n00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:19.130\nAnd they don't wanna go down at the help\ndesk and say I locked my account again.\n\n247\n00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:20.740\nCan you unlock it for me?\n\n248\n00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.930\nBecause now,\neverybody knows they locked their account.\n\n249\n00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:26.460\nThey might get a call to their manager and\nsay hey, look.\n\n250\n00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:29.510\nThis is the third time this week\nwe've had to unlock your account.\n\n251\n00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:32.260\nWhy are you having so much trouble\nremembering your password, whatever.\n\n252\n00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.570\nSo what they'll do is they'll\nsit there in their office and\n\n253\n00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:37.610\npretend to look busy even\nthough they can't log in and\n\n254\n00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:43.070\nthey know in 30 minutes it's gonna unlock\nautomatically and they can try again.\n\n255\n00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:46.350\nSo by setting it to zero,\nit forces them to go tell somebody, hey,\n\n256\n00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:47.770\nI've locked my account.\n\n257\n00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:52.738\nAnd in a high-security situation, I need\nto know that your account has been locked.\n\n258\n00:13:52.738 --> 00:13:56.740\nBecause if Zach comes to me in the morning\nand says, hey look, my account's locked,\n\n259\n00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.240\ncan you unlock it for me?\n\n260\n00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.400\nMy first question is, gosh Zach,\ncan't you remember your password?\n\n261\n00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:05.638\nThat's not my first question,\nmy first question is did you lock it?\n\n262\n00:14:05.638 --> 00:14:09.410\nBecause if Zach tells me, yeah,\nI mistyped my password a couple times and\n\n263\n00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:13.990\nit locked it, okay, no problem,\nZach, here, let me unlock it for you.\n\n264\n00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.940\nBut if Zach says,\n\n265\n00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:19.730\nno, it was the first time I tried to log\nin this morning, it was already locked.\n\n266\n00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:24.170\nThat tells me that somebody else\nwas trying to log, exactly.\n\n267\n00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:25.530\nSee, he's on the ball here.\n\n268\n00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:28.230\nSomebody else was trying to use that\naccount and ended up locking it.\n\n269\n00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:31.880\nSo its important that I know that your\naccount got locked out at some point.\n\n270\n00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.630\nSo that's why we might set that to zero.\n\n271\n00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:39.400\nAnd force somebody to come ask someone\nto reset or to unlock their account.\n\n272\n00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:44.660\nAll right?\nI'm gonna set that back to 30 minutes and\n\n273\n00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.930\nI'll just click OK for that.\n\n274\n00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:50.135\nAll right, and then the other one\nReset account lockout counter after.\n\n275\n00:14:50.135 --> 00:14:53.545\nWell we talked about this, this is\nhow long it remembers your strikes.\n\n276\n00:14:53.545 --> 00:14:57.615\nAnd again this is something that each\norganization has their own opinion on.\n\n277\n00:14:57.615 --> 00:15:00.595\nThey're all good, it doesn't matter.\n\n278\n00:15:00.595 --> 00:15:02.115\nLet me not say it doesn't matter.\n\n279\n00:15:02.115 --> 00:15:05.035\nBut every organization is gonna\nhave what they feel is best.\n\n280\n00:15:05.035 --> 00:15:05.845\n&gt;&gt; Their own protocol.\n\n281\n00:15:05.845 --> 00:15:07.515\n&gt;&gt; And that's perfectly fine.\n\n282\n00:15:07.515 --> 00:15:09.920\nDo you wanna remember for 30 minutes?\n\n283\n00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.337\nDo you wanna remember for\nup to 9,999 minutes.\n\n284\n00:15:13.337 --> 00:15:14.090\nI'm not sure how many hours that is.\n\n285\n00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:15.240\n&gt;&gt; Couple of minutes.\n\n286\n00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.380\n&gt;&gt; Divided by 60 and\nyou figure that one out.\n\n287\n00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.110\nBut yeah that's a little while.\n\n288\n00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:22.180\nWhat's the best practice?\n\n289\n00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.390\nWhat should we set that to?\n\n290\n00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:28.120\nWell like I say,\nit kind of depends on your organization.\n\n291\n00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.520\nYou know, normally.\n\n292\n00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.990\n&gt;&gt; But default is zero?\n\n293\n00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:34.500\n&gt;&gt; By default, it's not configured and\nas soon as we turn on account lock out,\n\n294\n00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.000\nit's set to 30 minutes.\n\n295\n00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.160\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And 30 minutes is pretty good because,\n\n296\n00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.130\nhere's what happens.\n\n297\n00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:42.380\nIf we kinda run through the scenarios,\nokay, if I set that to 30,\n\n298\n00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:43.600\nwhat does that mean?\n\n299\n00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:47.120\nThat means if a user locks their account,\na legitimate user locks their account\n\n300\n00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.680\nwithin 30 minutes the can try again and\nget back to work.\n\n301\n00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.698\nIf they don't want to go tell anybody\nthat they locked their account.\n\n302\n00:15:52.698 --> 00:15:57.183\nIf a bad guy is guessing passwords, after\nfive accounts, it locks, and now he's\n\n303\n00:15:57.183 --> 00:16:01.547\ngonna wait for 30 minutes before he can\ntry again The 30 minutes it unlocks.\n\n304\n00:16:01.547 --> 00:16:03.709\nYou can try 5 more times,\nit's gonna lock again and\n\n305\n00:16:03.709 --> 00:16:06.000\nhe's gotta wait another 30 minutes.\n\n306\n00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.940\nDoes the bad guy really have\nhours to sit around unnoticed,\n\n307\n00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:12.343\nsomewhere in your building,\nguessing passwords?\n\n308\n00:16:12.343 --> 00:16:17.755\nProbably not, so I don't know that\nthere's a need to set this to 18 hours or\n\n309\n00:16:17.755 --> 00:16:19.273\nanything like that.\n\n310\n00:16:19.273 --> 00:16:23.575\nBut, again that's something that your\norganization is gonna have to determine\n\n311\n00:16:23.575 --> 00:16:25.166\nwhat's appropriate there.\n\n312\n00:16:25.166 --> 00:16:26.184\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n313\n00:16:26.184 --> 00:16:29.225\n&gt;&gt; But, that's what that's for,\nis how long does it\n\n314\n00:16:29.225 --> 00:16:33.230\nremember all the failed attempts\nbefore it locks the account out.\n\n315\n00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:36.110\n&gt;&gt; So my next question to you Mike,\nis this.\n\n316\n00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:38.850\nLet's talk about common attack methods.\n\n317\n00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:42.857\nYou've said this several times,\nbrute force being one of them.\n\n318\n00:16:42.857 --> 00:16:43.905\n&gt;&gt; Yep, exactly.\n\n319\n00:16:43.905 --> 00:16:45.410\n&gt;&gt; But, there's gonna be a lot more.\n\n320\n00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:47.310\n&gt;&gt; There's a couple that\nwe'll talk about here, and\n\n321\n00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:50.220\nthere's actually more that we don't need\nto go over for this particular exam.\n\n322\n00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:53.170\nGo check out a lot of our security\ncourses in our library and\n\n323\n00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:54.980\nwe'll cover these much more in depth.\n\n324\n00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:59.570\nWhat we need to as an MTA, what we need to\nunderstand is why am I doing these things?\n\n325\n00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:03.846\nWhy am I so worried about password length\nand strength and account lockouts and\n\n326\n00:17:03.846 --> 00:17:04.891\nthings like that?\n\n327\n00:17:04.891 --> 00:17:09.358\nIt's because the bad guys have techniques\nthey can use to try to get your password\n\n328\n00:17:09.358 --> 00:17:13.824\nand then log into the system as a user,\nsee what access they have, try to escalate\n\n329\n00:17:13.824 --> 00:17:17.503\ntheir credentials to another account\nthat has even more access and\n\n330\n00:17:17.503 --> 00:17:19.760\ndo harm to your network and to your data.\n\n331\n00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:25.470\nSo, we wanna make sure that\nwe're implementing procedures\n\n332\n00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:28.790\nto use strong passwords and\nto change them every so often.\n\n333\n00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:31.070\nNow, what attacks are they using?\n\n334\n00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:35.300\nWell, the two most common attacks we\nsee against passwords are password\n\n335\n00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:39.100\ndictionary attacks and\nbrute force attacks, right?\n\n336\n00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.920\nPassword guessing is another attack.\n\n337\n00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.990\nThey actually don't mention\nit in this particular exam.\n\n338\n00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:50.690\nIt's really because password guessing\nis kinda not as common nowadays,\n\n339\n00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:56.150\nbecause users are slowly getting\nbetter at creating passwords.\n\n340\n00:17:56.150 --> 00:18:00.670\nAnd we've got policies that we can use\nto enforce creating strong passwords.\n\n341\n00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:03.130\nSo password guessing is not\nas easy as it was before.\n\n342\n00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:06.950\nIt used to be, I could talk to Zach for\na couple minutes, an hour,\n\n343\n00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:10.250\nmaybe I could go have lunch with Zach or\nsomething and\n\n344\n00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:14.730\nI learn his wife's name and his and\nhis kids' names, anniversaries, and\n\n345\n00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:18.530\nhis dog's name, and odds are that\none of those is his password, right?\n\n346\n00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.534\n&gt;&gt; Well, the answer to all those is Ann.\n\n347\n00:18:20.534 --> 00:18:22.144\nAnn's everything.\n\n348\n00:18:22.144 --> 00:18:23.666\n&gt;&gt; But not so much anymore.\n\n349\n00:18:23.666 --> 00:18:27.906\nPeople are wising up and they're not using\ntheir birthdays as their password, or\n\n350\n00:18:27.906 --> 00:18:29.880\nat least they shouldn't be.\n\n351\n00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:33.170\nAnd so, that's why I think Microsoft\nis kind of saying password guessing\n\n352\n00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:37.150\nis not as common of an attack any more,\nbut it's definitely still a possibility.\n\n353\n00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:41.211\nBut dictionary attacks and\nbrute force attacks are used a lot.\n\n354\n00:18:41.211 --> 00:18:43.736\nAnd we've talked about these\nin the password episode, so\n\n355\n00:18:43.736 --> 00:18:46.160\nI'm just gonna quickly\nrehash what those were.\n\n356\n00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.460\nRemember, a dictionary attack is\nwhen the bad guy uses a program\n\n357\n00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.120\nthat is gonna do the password guessing for\nhim.\n\n358\n00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:57.260\nIt's got one word on each line,\nthat's the dictionary, and\n\n359\n00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.500\nthe program just rifles through each word.\n\n360\n00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.200\nIt says, maybe Zach's password is this.\n\n361\n00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.210\nNo?\nMove on to the next one.\n\n362\n00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:04.360\nAnd it just goes through that entire list,\n\n363\n00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:08.290\none at a time, trying to see if one\nof those words is Zach's password.\n\n364\n00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:11.860\nThat's known as the dictionary attack and\nthat dictionary, again,\n\n365\n00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:15.060\nis just a text file with\none word on each line.\n\n366\n00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:18.590\nAnd, so, as a bad guy, what they do\nis they build these dictionary files.\n\n367\n00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:21.952\nThey typically start with\nsomebody else’s copy,\n\n368\n00:19:21.952 --> 00:19:26.690\nlike I've got a copy of the Webster's\nDictionary, one word on each line.\n\n369\n00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:30.630\nBut, then they'll add to it.\n\n370\n00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:35.890\nIf I'm gonna try to crack passwords at\nITProTV, I'm gonna add to my dictionary\n\n371\n00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:42.510\nfile some industry specific terms,\nlike PCI, motherboard, CPU.\n\n372\n00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:47.079\nI might scour your website for\npeople's names and I'll put Zach and\n\n373\n00:19:47.079 --> 00:19:52.226\nmemos and all of that in my dictionary\nfile, so I can try all those, as well.\n\n374\n00:19:52.226 --> 00:19:54.754\nBut that's what a dictionary attack is.\n\n375\n00:19:54.754 --> 00:19:58.331\nBasically, they take a text file,\none word on each line and\n\n376\n00:19:58.331 --> 00:20:00.500\nthey rifle through it, all right?\n\n377\n00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:06.640\nBrute force attacks were when we tried\nevery possible combination of letter,\n\n378\n00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.140\nnumber and special character.\n\n379\n00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.094\nYou're basically throwing\nthe kitchen sink at it, right?\n\n380\n00:20:11.094 --> 00:20:12.926\nThat's a brute force attack.\n\n381\n00:20:12.926 --> 00:20:16.400\nIt's gonna take much longer\nto do a brute force attack.\n\n382\n00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.620\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like that would take months,\nor it could take months.\n\n383\n00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:22.070\n&gt;&gt; It can take days, months,\nyears, thousands of years,\n\n384\n00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:24.620\ndepending on how long and\nstrong your password is.\n\n385\n00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:30.150\nBut it's also a guaranteed\nway to break the password,\n\n386\n00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:34.430\nbut my lifespan is not 250 years.\n\n387\n00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:39.230\nSo if you've got a 20 character password\nthat includes 4 different character sets,\n\n388\n00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:42.260\nI'm not gonna crack it in my\nlifetime using a brute force attack\n\n389\n00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:43.920\nwith today's technology, right?\n\n390\n00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:48.310\nThat could change tomorrow as\nwe come out with faster CPUs and\n\n391\n00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:49.590\nall of that fun stuff.\n\n392\n00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:52.080\nBut again, that's not so\n\n393\n00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.780\nimportant as understanding\nwhat a brute force attack is.\n\n394\n00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.370\nTrying every possible\ncombination of letter, number,\n\n395\n00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:00.580\nspecial character until\nwe break that password.\n\n396\n00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:04.740\nSo those are two of the big attack\nmethods that the bad guys use\n\n397\n00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.780\nHow do we protect from that?\n\n398\n00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:11.250\nWell, those policies that we just looked\nat, will help with the dictionary attacks,\n\n399\n00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:16.140\nbecause they can't rifle through 2,000\nwords, because after 5 bad attempts,\n\n400\n00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:16.858\nthe account locks out.\n\n401\n00:21:16.858 --> 00:21:17.438\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n402\n00:21:17.438 --> 00:21:21.376\n&gt;&gt; Right, so we've stopped the dictionary\nattack in its tracks right there.\n\n403\n00:21:21.376 --> 00:21:25.080\nBrute force attacks\nare typically done offline.\n\n404\n00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:31.370\nBut, by having strong passwords,\nby making those passwords long and\n\n405\n00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:35.360\ncomplex, we can make it to\nwhere it's not feasible for\n\n406\n00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.750\nthe bad guys to a do a brute\nforce attack on the password.\n\n407\n00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.871\nIt's just gonna take too long, right?\n\n408\n00:21:40.871 --> 00:21:42.520\nAnd that's the idea.\n\n409\n00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:48.550\nOur passwords need to be strong\nenough to withstand these attacks for\n\n410\n00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:50.362\nonly a short amount of time.\n\n411\n00:21:50.362 --> 00:21:53.000\nIf you're changing your\npassword every 30 days,\n\n412\n00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.320\nthen your password doesn't\nhave to last 200 years.\n\n413\n00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.380\nIt needs to last 31 days.\n\n414\n00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:01.910\nSo if it takes them more than\n30 days to crack your password,\n\n415\n00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:04.550\nyou've already changed it to something\nelse by the time they do crack it.\n\n416\n00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:06.360\nDoes that make sense, right?\n\n417\n00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.690\nSo that's all we're trying to do with\nthese policies is make sure that our\n\n418\n00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:14.530\npasswords are long enough and\nstrong enough to withstand attack for\n\n419\n00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:18.740\nwhatever period we're choosing that\nwe have to change those passwords.\n\n420\n00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.090\nAnd it's no guarantee.\n\n421\n00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:22.760\nKeep in mind this is not an exact science.\n\n422\n00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.638\nWhen I say do a brute force attack, and\n\n423\n00:22:24.638 --> 00:22:28.890\nI'm gonna go through every single possible\nletter, number and special character.\n\n424\n00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:29.981\nI might get lucky.\n\n425\n00:22:29.981 --> 00:22:33.360\nI might hit it on the second try,\njust out of sheer luck, right?\n\n426\n00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:38.242\nI mean, it's like the lottery, the odds\nare completely against you, but there's\n\n427\n00:22:38.242 --> 00:22:43.200\nnothing that says the very last one I\ntry is gonna be your password, right?\n\n428\n00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.000\nI might get lucky and\nget it on the second try.\n\n429\n00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.440\nSo none of these are foolproof and\n\n430\n00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.610\nnone of these are guaranteed\nto protect your passwords.\n\n431\n00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:55.510\nBut all of this used together will\nmake it much more difficult for\n\n432\n00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:57.680\nthe bad guy, all right?\n\n433\n00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:02.400\nThe last thing I wanna talk about here is\nprotecting domain user account passwords.\n\n434\n00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:06.050\nAnd really when we talk about that,\nWindows does that for us.\n\n435\n00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:09.600\nAs I said, when you store\na password in active directory,\n\n436\n00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:13.820\nit's run through a hashing algorithm and\nthat hash value is what gets stored.\n\n437\n00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.710\nThe output of that is stored,\nnot your actual password.\n\n438\n00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:21.985\nSo that's one way that we protect them, by\nusing a good strong authentication method.\n\n439\n00:23:21.985 --> 00:23:28.880\nLike FTP, File Transfer Protocol,\nis still used today for\n\n440\n00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:33.420\ntransferring files around, but\nit used passwords that were in plain text.\n\n441\n00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:36.120\nIn other words,\nit didn't bother encrypting the passwords.\n\n442\n00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:41.520\nSo if the bad guy was watching what went\nacross the network with certain programs,\n\n443\n00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.630\ncalled sniffers,\nthey could see your password go by.\n\n444\n00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:47.833\nAnd it wasn't encrypted at all, so\nthey could just get your password and\n\n445\n00:23:47.833 --> 00:23:49.473\nnow they could log on as you, right?\n\n446\n00:23:49.473 --> 00:23:53.003\nSo the first thing as far as protecting\ndomain accounts, or any accounts for\n\n447\n00:23:53.003 --> 00:23:55.320\nthat matter,\nis making sure we're using a good,\n\n448\n00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.804\nstrong authentication\nprotocol in the first place,\n\n449\n00:23:57.804 --> 00:24:01.308\none that encrypts those passwords and\nstores them in an encrypted format.\n\n450\n00:24:01.308 --> 00:24:03.014\nThe other one is user education.\n\n451\n00:24:03.014 --> 00:24:06.900\nMaking sure that my users know how\nto protect their own password.\n\n452\n00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:10.320\nNot, if somebody's watching them,\nsay, excuse me.\n\n453\n00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:15.500\nOr how many of you guys do this when you\ngo up to the convenience store nowadays\n\n454\n00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:21.180\nand they mount these darn card\nreaders like up on a pole right here.\n\n455\n00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:25.180\nAnd so I'm supposed to put my card\nup here and punch in my information.\n\n456\n00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.760\nThere's people behind me that\nhave a clear view of this thing.\n\n457\n00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.550\nNot a chance in heck I'm\ngonna be doing that.\n\n458\n00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:32.320\nJust use common sense.\n\n459\n00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:36.700\nEducate your users on, look around\nbefore you type in your password.\n\n460\n00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.380\nWe talked about looking at the back of\nyour computer to make sure there's no\n\n461\n00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:42.830\nkeystroke loggers recording\neverything you've typed.\n\n462\n00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:45.868\nMake sure our users understand\nnot to share passwords.\n\n463\n00:24:45.868 --> 00:24:50.318\nBecause if I give Zach my password,\nZach can now log on as me.\n\n464\n00:24:50.318 --> 00:24:54.375\nAnd that means everything that he\ndoes is now gonna be logged under me.\n\n465\n00:24:54.375 --> 00:24:56.039\nIt's gonna look like I did it.\n\n466\n00:24:56.039 --> 00:24:58.473\nZach might not have access\nto the same stuff I do.\n\n467\n00:24:58.473 --> 00:25:01.924\nSo if he gets my password,\nif I share it with him,\n\n468\n00:25:01.924 --> 00:25:06.405\nthen he can get access to\nall the stuff that I access.\n\n469\n00:25:06.405 --> 00:25:07.365\nAnd you know how it goes.\n\n470\n00:25:07.365 --> 00:25:11.352\nIf I give my password with Zach and say,\nZach, don't give this to anybody else.\n\n471\n00:25:11.352 --> 00:25:13.997\nZach's gonna says, no,\nI wouldn't share your password.\n\n472\n00:25:13.997 --> 00:25:14.891\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'd give it to Ann.\n\n473\n00:25:14.891 --> 00:25:17.051\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for giving me your\npassword and trusting me with it.\n\n474\n00:25:17.051 --> 00:25:18.790\nI won't share it with anybody.\n\n475\n00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:22.200\nAnd then Titus comes over and says,\nhey Zach, how'd you get access to that?\n\n476\n00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.230\nMike gave me his password.\n\n477\n00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:25.317\nHere you go.\nDon't tell him I gave it to you, right?\n\n478\n00:25:25.317 --> 00:25:28.280\nAnd before long,\nthe entire building has my password.\n\n479\n00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, don't share passwords.\n\n480\n00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:32.480\nThat is a bad, bad, bad thing.\n\n481\n00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.650\n&gt;&gt; I was even gonna ask you,\ndo people even still use keyloggers?\n\n482\n00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:38.755\nI mean that's-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] No, they're still there.\n\n483\n00:25:38.755 --> 00:25:40.460\nHardware based, software based.\n\n484\n00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:45.120\nIn fact, I was just reading an interesting\narticle today about Bluetooth keyboards.\n\n485\n00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:48.162\nA lot of people are now going\nwith wireless keyboards.\n\n486\n00:25:48.162 --> 00:25:48.721\n&gt;&gt; Certainly.\n\n487\n00:25:48.721 --> 00:25:53.371\n&gt;&gt; Which is very convenient, but\nthere's also wireless packet sniffers,\n\n488\n00:25:53.371 --> 00:25:57.580\nwhich means I could be sitting ten feet or\nfifty feet away from you.\n\n489\n00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.539\nProbably not that far,\nit is Bluetooth, so it's short range.\n\n490\n00:26:01.539 --> 00:26:05.017\nBut I could put something in place\nthat could sniff those packets.\n\n491\n00:26:05.017 --> 00:26:09.901\nAnd so basically I'm intercepting your\nwireless keystrokes that are going to\n\n492\n00:26:09.901 --> 00:26:11.690\nyour computer.\n\n493\n00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:13.460\nSo yeah, definitely still is use.\n\n494\n00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:15.300\nYeah, you gotta look for\nthose kind of things.\n\n495\n00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:17.740\nGotta pay attention to your environment.\n\n496\n00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:19.850\nSomething's changed and\nyou didn't change it,\n\n497\n00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:23.560\na new piece of hardware is\nattached to your computer.\n\n498\n00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:27.219\nSomething looks different,\nask somebody, right?\n\n499\n00:26:27.219 --> 00:26:31.609\nOur help desk, your help desk would much\nrather you come to them and ask them, hey,\n\n500\n00:26:31.609 --> 00:26:34.680\nis this supposed to be hanging\nout at my computer, than for\n\n501\n00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.401\nyou to ignore it because\nyou're too embarrassed.\n\n502\n00:26:37.401 --> 00:26:41.544\nAnd your computer gets compromised and\nthey have to shut the network down to try\n\n503\n00:26:41.544 --> 00:26:44.330\nto find the malware and\nget rid of it, right?\n\n504\n00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:45.220\nDon't be embarrassed.\n\n505\n00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:48.310\nI know sometimes IT people\ncan be intimidating.\n\n506\n00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:53.632\nBut you gotta teach your user, we, as IT\npeople, you guys out there watching me,\n\n507\n00:26:53.632 --> 00:26:57.337\nwe have to make sure that we\nunderstand that end-users,\n\n508\n00:26:57.337 --> 00:27:01.760\nthey don't wanna know how the computer\nworks and all of that stuff.\n\n509\n00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.790\nOtherwise they'd get into IT, right?\n\n510\n00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:05.440\nIt's like when you take\nyour car to the mechanic,\n\n511\n00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.690\nyou don't want the mechanic telling you\ndon't want the mechanic telling you\n\n512\n00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:10.100\nthe nitty gritty details of\nwhat's going on inside there.\n\n513\n00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:14.290\nJust fix it so that when I put my key in,\nI can get to work, right?\n\n514\n00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:16.421\nAnd that's the same thing our\nend-user's doing with their computer.\n\n515\n00:27:16.421 --> 00:27:21.189\nSo be nice and make sure that they feel\ncomfortable coming to you saying, hey,\n\n516\n00:27:21.189 --> 00:27:24.530\nI didn't recognize this or\nthis is a new mouse.\n\n517\n00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:25.507\nDid you give this to me?\n\n518\n00:27:25.507 --> 00:27:29.604\nBecause as a bad guy, what easier way to\nget a keystroke logger installed than to\n\n519\n00:27:29.604 --> 00:27:32.860\njust swap keyboards with one\nthat's built into it, right?\n\n520\n00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:37.550\nAnd if you're an end-user and they\nlook at it and go, well, I don't know,\n\n521\n00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:39.110\nI'll just use it anyway, right?\n\n522\n00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:43.400\nWe wanna make sure that we\nconvey to our end-users\n\n523\n00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.760\nthat we want them to communicate with\nus and we want them to ask questions.\n\n524\n00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.696\nSo anyway, when it comes to protecting\ndomain user account passwords,\n\n525\n00:27:49.696 --> 00:27:51.150\nthose are the things that we can do.\n\n526\n00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:53.942\nOne, making sure that\nwe're encrypting them and\n\n527\n00:27:53.942 --> 00:27:58.570\nnot using that reversible encryption\noption unless we absolutely have to.\n\n528\n00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:00.755\nWanna make sure we educate our users,\n\n529\n00:28:00.755 --> 00:28:05.547\nuse our policies to ensure that they\nare using strong, complex, long passwords.\n\n530\n00:28:05.547 --> 00:28:08.611\nAnd make sure they understand\nthe dangers of writing them down and\n\n531\n00:28:08.611 --> 00:28:10.540\nthen sharing those passwords.\n\n532\n00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:11.464\n&gt;&gt; Awesome information as usual, Mike.\n\n533\n00:28:11.464 --> 00:28:15.830\nAnd it's practical information and\nstuff we need to know and need to use.\n\n534\n00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:17.931\nBut more importantly,\nfor the exam as well,\n\n535\n00:28:17.931 --> 00:28:20.102\nthere's a lot of answers\nto those questions.\n\n536\n00:28:20.102 --> 00:28:23.839\nPassword policies that you're watching,\nMTA security fundamentals.\n\n537\n00:28:23.839 --> 00:28:28.499\nThere's more in this series and you're\nlucky because you're involved with ITProTV\n\n538\n00:28:28.499 --> 00:28:30.450\nand you got access to

watching ITPROTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.240\nHello, and welcome to another\nexciting episode here at IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.390\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and\nin today's episode,\n\n6\n00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.860\nwe got a great episode coming at you.\n\n7\n00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.770\nWe're going to be continuing along\nin our MTA Security Fundamentals.\n\n8\n00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.680\nJoining us back in the studios is\nnone other than Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n9\n00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.650\nMike, how are you doing sir?\n\n10\n00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:27.790\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic, Wes.\n\n11\n00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:28.660\nThanks for having me back.\n\n12\n00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.220\nGlad to be here as always.\n\n13\n00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.981\nContinuing on as you said, with our good\nold MTA content security fundamentals,\n\n14\n00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:36.499\nthe old 98367 exam.\n\n15\n00:00:36.499 --> 00:00:39.460\nIn this episode, we are gonna be\ntaking a look at audit policy.\n\n16\n00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.060\nWe've talked a lot about security, and\nauditing really rounds out security.\n\n17\n00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.740\nRemember, a few episodes back\nwe talked about triple A.\n\n18\n00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.690\nAnd I don't mean the people that'll\ncome pick you up on the side\n\n19\n00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.180\nof the road when your car breaks down.\n\n20\n00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.870\nAuthentication, authorization and\naccounting.\n\n21\n00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.410\nAnd I said accounting,\nauditing, same thing.\n\n22\n00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.680\nIn fact, they both start with A, so either\none would actually work with that acronym.\n\n23\n00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.710\nThat is part of our security goals,\nis that auditing.\n\n24\n00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.980\nThat is really what gives us that record,\nof what happened, right?\n\n25\n00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.618\nWhen we talk about accounting, when we\ntalk about auditing, what we are doing is\n\n26\n00:01:14.618 --> 00:01:19.004\nwe are putting some system in place that\nis going to keep a record if you will.\n\n27\n00:01:19.004 --> 00:01:21.769\nOf whatever events it is\nthat you're trying to audit,\n\n28\n00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:23.219\nthat you're trying to log.\n\n29\n00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:26.764\nFor example, we can log and I'll talk\nabout the different things we can log and\n\n30\n00:01:26.764 --> 00:01:28.820\nyou might audit access\nto a particular file.\n\n31\n00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.990\nLet's say you got your employee handbook,\nand\n\n32\n00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.480\nyou need to know when somebody makes\na change to that employee handbook.\n\n33\n00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.480\nI need to know who did it,\nwhen they did it.\n\n34\n00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.350\nBecause if I go and\nfind the handbook's been modified,\n\n35\n00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.940\nand nobody says who did it,\nI need to know.\n\n36\n00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.240\nI need to know who did, when they did it,\n\n37\n00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.390\nif it was authorized or\nnot, things like that.\n\n38\n00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.670\nAnd without auditing,\nI might never know, right.\n\n39\n00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.410\nI just know that it's changed,\nbut I don't know who did it.\n\n40\n00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.040\n&gt;&gt; I love that explanation you gave there.\n\n41\n00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.600\nWho did what?\n\n42\n00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.380\nWhen did they do it?\n\n43\n00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.280\nCuz I always think of three A's, right.\n\n44\n00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.260\nWho are you?\n\n45\n00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.550\nThat is your authentication.\n\n46\n00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.640\nWhat can you do, right?\n\n47\n00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.900\nThat's your authorization.\n\n48\n00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.390\nAnd then, well, what did you do.\n\n49\n00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.840\nI love the way you put that.\n\n50\n00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.620\nSo we're gonna be figuring out what people\nare doing within our networks, right?\n\n51\n00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.340\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n52\n00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.030\nAnd then this is something that\nevery organization should implement.\n\n53\n00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.180\nMost organizations do implement.\n\n54\n00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.267\nAlso keep in mind that this could be\na regulation that you are required to.\n\n55\n00:02:19.267 --> 00:02:22.192\nIf you're in an industry, the healthcare\nindustry or the banking industry or\n\n56\n00:02:22.192 --> 00:02:23.370\nanything like that.\n\n57\n00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.510\nYou've got things like Sarbanes-Oxley or\nHIPAA that gonna say that you have to\n\n58\n00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.170\nknow who accessed that health care record,\nwho made changes to that when they did and\n\n59\n00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.750\nyou have to keep that for\na certain period of time.\n\n60\n00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.765\nDepending on the laws in your region,\nyour country, etc..\n\n61\n00:02:38.765 --> 00:02:44.730\nSo, auditing is a big part of what we\ndo in IT, especially in IT security.\n\n62\n00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.470\nThis is how we,\nthis is like that paper trail, right?\n\n63\n00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.660\nLet's say that a computer, we suspect\nthat a computer has been breached.\n\n64\n00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.090\nThat somebody accessed the database or\na file server inappropriately.\n\n65\n00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.020\nHow we gonna know?\n\n66\n00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.540\nWell, we can go in and\nlook at the audit trail,\n\n67\n00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.165\nwe can see when those files were accessed.\n\n68\n00:03:01.165 --> 00:03:06.079\n11:57 PM, there's nobody in the office at\n11:57 PM, so something is looking funny.\n\n69\n00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.220\n&gt;&gt; So there's all different\ntypes of auditing, righ?\n\n70\n00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.320\nMike can you give us some examples of\nthe types of auditing we might see?\n\n71\n00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.120\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nwe're gonna be looking at things like,\n\n72\n00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.510\nprobably one of the first we think of\nare login attempts, successful logons,\n\n73\n00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.910\nfailed logons attempts,\nchanges to object Active Directory.\n\n74\n00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.280\nI need to know if somebody added\nchanges to Wes's user account.\n\n75\n00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.920\nYou might think why who cares?\n\n76\n00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.330\nWell, if somebody added Wes to a group\nthat he shouldn't have been in, right?\n\n77\n00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.310\nThey added him to the domain admin's group\nwhen Wes shouldn't be a domain admin.\n\n78\n00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.170\nI need to know.\n\n79\n00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.500\nI can see a record of the domain\nadmin's group being modified or\n\n80\n00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.460\nthe record of Wes user\naccount being modified.\n\n81\n00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.630\nAccess to files, changes to files,\nit could be just opening them up,\n\n82\n00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.890\nI need to know when somebody\nlooks at this file.\n\n83\n00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.900\nIf it's really sensitive information,\nor proprietary company information, or\n\n84\n00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.770\nmaybe I just need to know\nif somebody makes changes.\n\n85\n00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.280\nLike the employee handbook,\nI wouldn't care who opened it,\n\n86\n00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.030\neverybody should be able to read it.\n\n87\n00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.740\nBut if somebody changes it,\nthat I need to know.\n\n88\n00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.170\nUsing a printer, I think well,\nthat's kinda odd.\n\n89\n00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.160\nWell, down in HR we have a printer\nthat's loaded up with checks.\n\n90\n00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.780\nThat's all that thing does is print\npayroll checks and checks to vendors.\n\n91\n00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.490\nAnd there's two checks missing.\n\n92\n00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.556\nWe know the last one we\nprinted was 4,017 but yet\n\n93\n00:04:20.556 --> 00:04:24.119\n4,020 is the one that's loaded\nup next in the printer.\n\n94\n00:04:24.119 --> 00:04:25.920\nSo, somewhere I'm missing two checks.\n\n95\n00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.160\nIt'd be nice to know who\nprinted those out, right?\n\n96\n00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.720\nThat's what we can do with auditing.\n\n97\n00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.880\nWho rebooted the system?\n\n98\n00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.420\nOur website had down time.\n\n99\n00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.080\nWe had customers that were trying\nto buy a product and they couldn't.\n\n100\n00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.780\nWe had complaints coming in.\n\n101\n00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.290\nWho rebooted the server\nin the middle of the day?\n\n102\n00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.954\nI can find out with auditing.\n\n103\n00:04:42.954 --> 00:04:45.845\nAnd it probably turns out to be some\nemployee, somebody that probably should\n\n104\n00:04:45.845 --> 00:04:48.830\nhave been installing software,\nand just didn't think about it.\n\n105\n00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.026\nWe've all probably done that once or\ntwice.\n\n106\n00:04:51.026 --> 00:04:53.740\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, I think of a home network.\n\n107\n00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.690\nYou know, what's the big deal\nabout restarting your computer?\n\n108\n00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.600\nWell, that's okay, but\nif you've got e-commerce.\n\n109\n00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.330\nAnd like you said in past episodes,\nyou stand to lose a lot of money.\n\n110\n00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.890\nIt could be a million dollars an hour\nthat you don't have that website up,\n\n111\n00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.710\nI can see why that'd be\ncatastrophic to him.\n\n112\n00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.460\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, when you're looking for\nthat availability and that uptime.\n\n113\n00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.340\nMaking system changes.\n\n114\n00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.790\nWho modified the firewall in that system?\n\n115\n00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.300\nWho added a network\nadapter to that system?\n\n116\n00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.500\nThat kind of thing.\n\n117\n00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.042\nThere's a lot of stuff we can audit.\n\n118\n00:05:18.042 --> 00:05:20.580\nI'm gonna pull up a policy\nhere in a second and\n\n119\n00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.780\nI'll show you some of these\ndifferent categories.\n\n120\n00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.840\nWe've got the idea of what auditing is,\n\n121\n00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.080\nwe wanna try to keep a record of who did\nwhat and when and where they did it.\n\n122\n00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.980\nI want to know Wes at\n8:47AM accessed this folder\n\n123\n00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:44.290\nfrom PC13, or Desktop 102 or whatever it\nwas, or from a remote VPN connection.\n\n124\n00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.420\nSo those are things we can get.\n\n125\n00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.310\nWe can find out who did it,\nwho performed the action.\n\n126\n00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.400\nAnd I been saying users but\n\n127\n00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.420\nkeep in mind it's just as important\nto look at systems as well.\n\n128\n00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:58.210\nWhen we audit and it will say Wes accessed\nthis file or this particular computer made\n\n129\n00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.590\na connection to the server, on request of\nan application or something like that.\n\n130\n00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:03.380\nWho did it?\n\n131\n00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.200\nUser, or computer, or service.\n\n132\n00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.360\nWhat they did, right?\n\n133\n00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.520\nWhat they accessed, or\nwhat system they rebooted?\n\n134\n00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.450\nWhen they did it,\ntimestamp information on there.\n\n135\n00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.530\nAnd then, where, right?\n\n136\n00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.980\nIf there is a where, what computer they\nwere sitting at when they performed\n\n137\n00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.780\nthe action, or what computer it was\nthat made that connection to the server.\n\n138\n00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:24.420\nThings like that.\n\n139\n00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.288\nThe only thing we don't get is they why,\ntypically.\n\n140\n00:06:28.288 --> 00:06:28.793\nYes.\n\n141\n00:06:28.793 --> 00:06:30.050\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna say where.\n\n142\n00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.540\nYou might say why would\nwhere be important?\n\n143\n00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.060\nBut you got a lot of location\nbased policies today, right?\n\n144\n00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.390\nGeolocation, geofencing.\n\n145\n00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.612\nSo I could see where that would be\ncoming be more and more prevalent today.\n\n146\n00:06:40.612 --> 00:06:41.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah absolutely,\n\n147\n00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.050\nI might have a policy in place that\nsays these documents are sensitive and\n\n148\n00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.200\nthey do not get access from any\ncomputers outside our protected network.\n\n149\n00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.000\nBut yet, somebody is accessing them\nin the middle of the night and\n\n150\n00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.960\nthey are doing it from\na remote connection.\n\n151\n00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.817\nOr, the CEO and the financial execs told\nthem, they are only allowed to connect\n\n152\n00:06:58.817 --> 00:07:02.373\nto those particular documents\nfrom their work stations,\n\n153\n00:07:02.373 --> 00:07:04.710\nnot from a work station down in sales.\n\n154\n00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.929\nBecause it doesn't have same level of\nsecurity on it, yet they're done and\n\n155\n00:07:07.929 --> 00:07:11.598\nthey're talking to their buddy, and they\nsay, you know what, I forgot to look at\n\n156\n00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:14.649\nthis, I'm gonna borrow your computer for\na second I log in, I do this.\n\n157\n00:07:14.649 --> 00:07:17.642\nAnd to them it's like,\nit doesn't really matter, does it but\n\n158\n00:07:17.642 --> 00:07:19.985\nwe've got these policies in place for\na reason.\n\n159\n00:07:19.985 --> 00:07:22.900\nSo, understanding the where\ndefinitely very important.\n\n160\n00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.240\nAnd as I was saying earlier too this\nis a record of what's going on.\n\n161\n00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.570\nIf you're In security like we're going\nto be after taking these classes and\n\n162\n00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:35.220\ngetting these certifications, one of the\nthings we have to do is look at breaches.\n\n163\n00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.050\nAnd this is our paper trail.\n\n164\n00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:41.532\nWe're gonna, we won't talk about in here,\nbut we'll be logging several different\n\n165\n00:07:41.532 --> 00:07:46.031\nsystems, at the router, at the server,\nat the client, a lot of different logging.\n\n166\n00:07:46.031 --> 00:07:49.381\nAnd we need to be able to correlate\nthat information across so\n\n167\n00:07:49.381 --> 00:07:52.149\nwe can see that attack\ncoming in as it progressed.\n\n168\n00:07:52.149 --> 00:07:56.380\nAnd that's another reason timestamp\ninformation and time synchronization is so\n\n169\n00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:57.062\nimportant.\n\n170\n00:07:57.062 --> 00:07:59.230\nBecause the events need to line up.\n\n171\n00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:03.632\nI need to see that attack coming\nthrough the router at 12:15 PM and\n\n172\n00:08:03.632 --> 00:08:07.260\nthen at 12:17,\nthis file server was accessed.\n\n173\n00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.270\nWell if the router says\nthey came in at 1:32 PM and\n\n174\n00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:16.998\nthe file was accessed at 12:15, I forget\nif I said AM or PM but you get the idea.\n\n175\n00:08:16.998 --> 00:08:20.530\nThat's not gonna be very good evidence\nif I try to prosecute, right,\n\n176\n00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:23.878\nthat doesn't line up, and\nthey're going to say well this is no good.\n\n177\n00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:28.400\nAnyway, we don't need to go all down that\nrabbit hole for this particular exam.\n\n178\n00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.300\nIt's more important that we just\nunderstand what auditing is and\n\n179\n00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.850\nwhy we use it.\n\n180\n00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:37.910\nSo, let's talk about what we can\nactually audit in our Windows system.\n\n181\n00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:40.440\nSo I'm gonna take a look at,\nif you'll take a look at my screen here,\n\n182\n00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.950\nI've got my domain controller pulled up,\nand\n\n183\n00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.780\nthere's a couple of different\nplaces I can enable auditing.\n\n184\n00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:48.905\nEvery Windows machine has a local policy,\nand\n\n185\n00:08:48.905 --> 00:08:52.040\nin that local policy you\ncan enable auditing.\n\n186\n00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.640\nWe talked a little bit about this\nthough in a previous episode.\n\n187\n00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.850\nWe said, I really don't wanna have\nto go to every single machine and\n\n188\n00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.000\nmake changes like this.\n\n189\n00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.910\nIn a small environment that's fine.\n\n190\n00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:04.440\nYou get into a domain environment, and\nwe have centralized administration.\n\n191\n00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.120\nThat's what Active Directory is for.\n\n192\n00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.090\nSo, yes you can set it in a local policy.\n\n193\n00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.218\nAnd if the machine is, if it's a member\nservice, it's not part of your domain,\n\n194\n00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:13.870\nthat might be how you have to do it.\n\n195\n00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.840\nThat kiosk out in your lobby\nthat's not part of your domain.\n\n196\n00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.410\nThat one machine that has\na different auditing policy\n\n197\n00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:21.380\nthan any other machine on your network.\n\n198\n00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.290\nMaybe I use the local policy because\nit only affects that one machine.\n\n199\n00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:29.028\nNormally however we're gonna be doing this\non multiple systems across our network.\n\n200\n00:09:29.028 --> 00:09:34.020\nSo we're gonna be use group policy to push\nthese settings out to those machines.\n\n201\n00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.760\nSo what I wanna do here is I'm\njust gonna take a look at some of\n\n202\n00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:37.860\nthe categories that we have.\n\n203\n00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:42.300\nI'm gonna just use my\ndefault domain policy and\n\n204\n00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.968\nI'm gonna right click on that and\nI'll zoom in, so you can see this here.\n\n205\n00:09:44.968 --> 00:09:49.340\nI'm just right+clicking on the Default\nDomain Policy but I could use any policy.\n\n206\n00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.880\nThere's lots of classes, and courses in\nour library that cover group policy and\n\n207\n00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.420\nhow to use this.\n\n208\n00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.390\nSo if you're not familiar,\ngo check those out.\n\n209\n00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:58.580\nBut for this exam, this is not part of it.\n\n210\n00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.850\nAll policies basically\nhave the same settings.\n\n211\n00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:05.979\nSo I'm gonna expand out Computer\nConfiguration &gt; Windows Settings &gt;\n\n212\n00:10:05.979 --> 00:10:07.880\nSecurity settings.\n\n213\n00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.110\nAnd then local policy.\n\n214\n00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.915\nAnd underneath there let me zoom out for\n\n215\n00:10:11.915 --> 00:10:16.750\none second, maximize this window,\ngive us a little more room here.\n\n216\n00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:19.140\nThere is a category called audit policy.\n\n217\n00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:23.151\nSo I click on that and\nhere are the categories.\n\n218\n00:10:23.151 --> 00:10:27.400\nI think it was nine, yeah, nine categories\nthat we've had for a long time.\n\n219\n00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.390\nEver since at least 2003 that\nthese categories have been here.\n\n220\n00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:32.340\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n221\n00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.580\nAnd let's just kind of go through them and\n\n222\n00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.400\nmake sure we understand\nwhat we're gonna get.\n\n223\n00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.770\nNow if you ever need to go back and\nreview, watch this video again.\n\n224\n00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.090\nAll right,\nyou've got access to it in the library.\n\n225\n00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:44.790\nBut just so you know,\nI double clicked on that first one.\n\n226\n00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:46.661\nThis is where I can turn on and off.\n\n227\n00:10:46.661 --> 00:10:48.641\nBut there's an explain tab and\n\n228\n00:10:48.641 --> 00:10:53.730\nthis explain tab does a really good job\nof explaining what that policy will do.\n\n229\n00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.130\nSo if you ever have questions or\nwanna go back and\n\n230\n00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:59.040\nreview, make sure you\ntake advantage of that.\n\n231\n00:10:59.040 --> 00:10:59.902\nBut the first one there.\n\n232\n00:10:59.902 --> 00:11:03.830\nI'm gonna actually skip the account logon\nand logon cuz those are the two that\n\n233\n00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:07.580\nconfuse people the most and I'm gonna\ncome back to those at the very end.\n\n234\n00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.020\nSo, account management.\n\n235\n00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.500\nWell, we talked about user accounts and\n\n236\n00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.310\ncomputer accounts and\nthis is talking about those accounts.\n\n237\n00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:20.850\nWho's going into Active Directory and\nmodifying those accounts, all right?\n\n238\n00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:22.840\nSo that's how we could audit that.\n\n239\n00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.840\nWe would just turn that one on.\n\n240\n00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:29.579\nDirectory service access, who's modifying\nActive Directory, creating new OUs.\n\n241\n00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.560\nObject access is like files and\nfolders, so if you're trying to\n\n242\n00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:43.500\ntrack who's making changes to that sales\nreport, object access would be the one.\n\n243\n00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.950\nPolicy change: who's making\nchanges to group policies.\n\n244\n00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:50.590\nPrivilege use: who's\nescalating their privileges or\n\n245\n00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:53.230\nwho's taking advantage of rights\nthat they've been assigned.\n\n246\n00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:57.730\nBut it might be, I see somebody is using a\nright that I don't think they should have,\n\n247\n00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:59.630\nand I need to go in and take that away.\n\n248\n00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:02.730\nSo this will track who's\nusing those rights and when.\n\n249\n00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:06.070\nProcess tracking is typically used for\ntroubleshooting.\n\n250\n00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:10.010\nThis one will audit, like when\nthe operating system is creating new\n\n251\n00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:13.430\nhandles and threads, and\nclosing handles, and things like this.\n\n252\n00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:16.900\nSo tracking applications and\nwhat resources they're accessing.\n\n253\n00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.740\nSo if you're having trouble with\nan app this is one you could use.\n\n254\n00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.380\nAnd then system events,\nlike power failures,\n\n255\n00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.850\nor reboots, updates, and things like that.\n\n256\n00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:28.070\nSo these are the general categories,\nnow let's go back and\n\n257\n00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:32.170\ntalk about the last two log-on events,\nand account log-on events.\n\n258\n00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:34.880\nNow they sound really similar, it's like,\nwait, what is the difference there?\n\n259\n00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:39.260\nAnd it's all about where,\nwhat's a good way to say this?\n\n260\n00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.700\nLog on events occur at\nthe machine you're logging on at.\n\n261\n00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.680\nSo if you go into work on Monday morning\nand you sit down at your machine and\n\n262\n00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:50.630\nyou log on with your domain user account,\nwell, you're logging on to your desktop.\n\n263\n00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:55.440\nSo your desktop will register a log on\nevent, if I've told it to audit that.\n\n264\n00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.110\nAll right, but your credentials are being\nsent to the domain controller for\n\n265\n00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:00.260\nvalidation.\n\n266\n00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.580\nSo it's the domain controller that's\nactuallyvalidating that you've\n\n267\n00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:07.040\ninputted the right information and\nshould allow you to log in.\n\n268\n00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:11.160\nSo an account logon event would\noccur on the domain controller.\n\n269\n00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.680\nSo you see,\nwhen you sit down on that computer,\n\n270\n00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.790\ntwo possible events,\nthat would be four, two\n\n271\n00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:21.200\npossible events are gonna happen depending\non what our auditing settings are.\n\n272\n00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.799\nIf you're auditing log on events,\n\n273\n00:13:22.799 --> 00:13:26.062\nthat's at the system the user's sitting\nat when they attempt to log on.\n\n274\n00:13:26.062 --> 00:13:29.599\nThe account log on event occurs on the\nmachine that's doing the validation which\n\n275\n00:13:29.599 --> 00:13:31.680\nwould be the domain control.\n\n276\n00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.540\nNow let's talk about a local account,\nall right.\n\n277\n00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.300\nWhat if I log in with a local account?\n\n278\n00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:39.070\nLet's say we're in a work group\nenvironment where I don't have a domain or\n\n279\n00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:43.770\nremember even domain computers can have\nlocal users that you can log in with and\n\n280\n00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:45.830\nonly have access to local machine.\n\n281\n00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:50.190\nIn that case if I'm logging on locally\nthen the machine I'm sitting at will\n\n282\n00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:52.920\nregister the log on event because\nthat's where I'm sitting.\n\n283\n00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.650\nBut also the machine I'm sitting at\nwill register the account log on event\n\n284\n00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:59.260\nbecause it's checking\nagainst the local SAM files.\n\n285\n00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.210\nSo it's this machine that's\nverifying my credentials.\n\n286\n00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:05.370\nSo hopefully that makes sense and\n\n287\n00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:09.480\nthis is what you've got to think about\nwhen you are setting up your audit policy.\n\n288\n00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.180\nYour audit policy is,\n\n289\n00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:15.350\nwhat you decided that you as\nan organization need to keep track of.\n\n290\n00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:16.850\nWhat is it I wanna audit?\n\n291\n00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:22.265\nWe use audit policies to enforce those\ndecisions that our company has made.\n\n292\n00:14:22.265 --> 00:14:25.310\nAnd if I audit, let's say that all\nof my users use domain accounts,\n\n293\n00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:27.160\nwe don't even set up local accounts, and\n\n294\n00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:32.010\nI create a policy that audits account\nlog on events on their laptops.\n\n295\n00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:33.680\nWell I'm never gonna see anything.\n\n296\n00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.600\nBecause they're logging in\nwith domain account, so\n\n297\n00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:39.420\nthe domain controller is the one that's\nfiring the account log on events.\n\n298\n00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.100\nI'm not gonna see it.\n\n299\n00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.480\nYou might think, something's broken.\n\n300\n00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.580\nIt's not working.\n\n301\n00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:46.680\nThat's because you're not considering\nwhere the event is occurring\n\n302\n00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:47.820\nwhen you set up that policy.\n\n303\n00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:52.750\nThe other thing you've got to\nkeep in mind with that is,\n\n304\n00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:54.370\nwe always have more than\none domain control, right?\n\n305\n00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:55.440\nAt least two,\n\n306\n00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.880\nusually more than that especially if\nwe are geographically distributed.\n\n307\n00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.570\nWell any domain controller\ncan authenticate you.\n\n308\n00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:06.830\nWhen you go to log in,\nwell we typically don't know what machine,\n\n309\n00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:09.430\nwhat domain controller is\ngoing to be responding to us.\n\n310\n00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:11.124\nThere is a little bit\nof control over that.\n\n311\n00:15:11.124 --> 00:15:12.660\nBut generally speaking,\n\n312\n00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:17.010\nany one of those domain controllers\ncould authenticate you, all right.\n\n313\n00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:19.930\nWhich means I need to make\nsure I audit account logon,\n\n314\n00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:24.660\nif I wanna get all logon attempts, I need\nto do it at all of my domain controllers.\n\n315\n00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:27.650\nIf I only enable auditing\non one domain controller.\n\n316\n00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:29.474\nWell, I'll get some of the logons but\n\n317\n00:15:29.474 --> 00:15:33.298\nwhat if they connect to a different\ndomain controller when they authenticate?\n\n318\n00:15:33.298 --> 00:15:35.385\nAll of a sudden, I won't get those, so\n\n319\n00:15:35.385 --> 00:15:39.006\nwe gotta audit that on all of\nthe domain controllers in our network.\n\n320\n00:15:39.006 --> 00:15:41.818\nSo these are the kinds of things that we\nwanna think about when we're setting up\n\n321\n00:15:41.818 --> 00:15:43.110\nour audit policy.\n\n322\n00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:46.210\nYou might think, well you know what I'm\ngonna audit object access everything,\n\n323\n00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:48.430\nevery single file and\nfolder on my servers.\n\n324\n00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.902\nIt's important, I need to audit everyone.\n\n325\n00:15:50.902 --> 00:15:53.023\nMaybe, some cases that might be.\n\n326\n00:15:53.023 --> 00:15:56.497\nHigh security scenarios,\nthat might be the case.\n\n327\n00:15:56.497 --> 00:16:01.487\nWe really wanna be careful because we can\nend up generating huge amounts of log\n\n328\n00:16:01.487 --> 00:16:05.140\nentries which are gonna\ntake up a lot of space.\n\n329\n00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.510\nAnd then it becomes looking for\n\n330\n00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:11.480\nthat important detail in the logs is\nlike looking for a needle in a haystack.\n\n331\n00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.600\nThere's all of this information,\nmost of it not necessary, and\n\n332\n00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.350\nI'm gonna miss the important events that\nhave occurred, because I've just got\n\n333\n00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:21.010\nthousands and thousands of entries\nto try to go through, all right?\n\n334\n00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:25.250\nSo when we set up audit policies we think\nabout what it is we really need to capture\n\n335\n00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:29.080\nwhether that's through legal requirements\nor just our company's policy.\n\n336\n00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.604\nAnd then how much\ninformation we need to give?\n\n337\n00:16:32.604 --> 00:16:33.900\nWe wanna try to balance,\n\n338\n00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:37.493\nI don't wanna miss anything I'd\nrather start off logging too much.\n\n339\n00:16:37.493 --> 00:16:40.965\nAnd then kind of wean it back a little\nbit than to not audit enough and\n\n340\n00:16:40.965 --> 00:16:44.690\nrealize at some point I wish I would\nof had that because it's too late.\n\n341\n00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:45.770\nI can't go back and get it.\n\n342\n00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:49.725\nSo start on the heavy side maybe and\nkind of wean it back a little bit.\n\n343\n00:16:49.725 --> 00:16:53.455\n&gt;&gt; Mike, is this the only area inside\nof our GPOs where we can manage\n\n344\n00:16:53.455 --> 00:16:54.075\naudit settings?\n\n345\n00:16:54.075 --> 00:16:56.855\nDo we have our real locations here, cuz\nyou said that these have been around for\n\n346\n00:16:56.855 --> 00:16:59.895\nawhile, so I'm assuming maybe\nwe have other areas too?\n\n347\n00:16:59.895 --> 00:17:00.555\n&gt;&gt; There is, yes.\n\n348\n00:17:00.555 --> 00:17:03.216\nStarting with 2008, we actually have.\n\n349\n00:17:03.216 --> 00:17:07.779\nIf I scroll down a little bit, we'll see\nthat underneath my security settings,\n\n350\n00:17:07.779 --> 00:17:11.195\nthere's an advanced audit\npolicy configuration.\n\n351\n00:17:11.195 --> 00:17:13.410\nAnd I'll zoom out so\nyou can see this a little better.\n\n352\n00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:15.780\nI expand it, expand it again, and\n\n353\n00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:20.010\nI am going to click on auto policies and\nzoom back in.\n\n354\n00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:22.960\nAnd here I can see more categories.\n\n355\n00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:29.030\nSo account log on has now become,\nlet me zoom up there,\n\n356\n00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:31.930\naudit credential validation,\nCurbroast authentication service,\n\n357\n00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:35.860\nCurbroast ticket operations,\nother account log on events.\n\n358\n00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:39.610\nSo there I can't remember,\nI counted these up at one point,\n\n359\n00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:42.487\nbut there is quite a few\nadditional policies.\n\n360\n00:17:42.487 --> 00:17:45.010\nI'm going to have to zoom out because\nI can't see everything at once.\n\n361\n00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:46.000\nAs I click on these though,\n\n362\n00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.960\njust look at the number of options\nin the detail pane, right?\n\n363\n00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:55.092\nSo they've added a considerable number\nof categories that we can now audit.\n\n364\n00:17:55.092 --> 00:17:59.437\nNow this exam is really,\nit is kind of based on 2008,\n\n365\n00:17:59.437 --> 00:18:02.707\nthey don't call these out specifically.\n\n366\n00:18:02.707 --> 00:18:04.160\nThey do call out those other ones.\n\n367\n00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:09.600\nGet in here, play around,\nget in your practice labs, take a look.\n\n368\n00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.110\nLike I said, the main thing I want\nyou guys to understand right now is\n\n369\n00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:15.680\nwhat auditing is about,\nwhy we would use it and how to turn it on.\n\n370\n00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.050\nSo that's going to be next.\n\n371\n00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:20.230\nLet's talk about how we turn it on.\n\n372\n00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:22.970\nI'm going to go back to\nthe standard categories and\n\n373\n00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:25.120\nI'm going to zoom back in for us.\n\n374\n00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:29.060\nAnd, let's say I want to\naudit account log on events.\n\n375\n00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:30.940\nWell, I'm gonna double click on that.\n\n376\n00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:32.440\nLet's double click on their setting.\n\n377\n00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:36.720\nAnd the first thing I have to do is turn\nit on to find these policy settings.\n\n378\n00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.450\nSo yes,\nI want to audit account logon events.\n\n379\n00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:43.960\nThen I've got two more\ncheck box to choose from.\n\n380\n00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.760\nI've got Success and Failure.\n\n381\n00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:50.716\nI can do either Success or\nFailure or both.\n\n382\n00:18:50.716 --> 00:18:53.796\nAnd it really depends again,\non what you're trying to capture,\n\n383\n00:18:53.796 --> 00:18:56.750\nwhat your policy is, or\nwhat your regulations specify.\n\n384\n00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:58.550\n&gt;&gt; And that's kind of where\nmy question was going, Mike.\n\n385\n00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:01.790\nWhich one's more important, or which\none's the important of the two, I guess?\n\n386\n00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:05.130\n&gt;&gt; It depends, it really depends\non what you're trying to capture.\n\n387\n00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:10.090\nYou might think, well I need to know\nfailed log on attempts because that's when\n\n388\n00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:13.990\nsomebody is sitting down and trying to\nguess passwords or doing some attack.\n\n389\n00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:16.800\nSo I see this repeated failed attempt,\nfailed attempt, failed attempt,\n\n390\n00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.680\nfailed attempt,\nI know something's going on right?\n\n391\n00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:23.137\nSo I'm not gonna bother auditing success,\neverybody logs in everyday.\n\n392\n00:19:23.137 --> 00:19:27.060\nI'm gonna have a lot of success\nmessages and that's a normal thing.\n\n393\n00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:30.378\nIt could be good, or\nwhat if I look at it this way.\n\n394\n00:19:30.378 --> 00:19:34.445\nAt 11 o'clock at night I see failure,\nfailure, failure, failure, failure,\n\n395\n00:19:34.445 --> 00:19:37.890\nfailure, failure, failure, and\nthen it just stops at 11:15.\n\n396\n00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:43.350\nNow my question to you would be, does this\nmean the person gave up and walked away?\n\n397\n00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.890\nOr did they succeed in logging in after so\nmany guesses,\n\n398\n00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:48.610\nthey finally guessed correctly and\nlogged in?\n\n399\n00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:52.245\nWell, if you weren't monitoring successful\nlog ons you wouldn't see that, right?\n\n400\n00:19:52.245 --> 00:19:54.259\nYou would only see\nthe failed attempts stop,\n\n401\n00:19:54.259 --> 00:19:56.540\nand then you don't know\nwhat happened after that.\n\n402\n00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:00.223\nSo you have got to think about again,\nwhat it is you are trying to capture.\n\n403\n00:20:00.223 --> 00:20:03.436\n&gt;&gt; So, I was going to say, Mike, it seems\nlike the advise you are giving us is don't\n\n404\n00:20:03.436 --> 00:20:05.680\njust come in here and\nstart flipping on light switches.\n\n405\n00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.790\nReally do your planning and\nconsider what it is specifically,\n\n406\n00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:11.260\nthat you're trying to accomplish\nin your audit policies.\n\n407\n00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:15.236\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, and you can tweak\nthese and play around with them,\n\n408\n00:20:15.236 --> 00:20:18.431\ntalk to other companies to\nget an idea of what they do.\n\n409\n00:20:18.431 --> 00:20:22.041\nAnd now you'll see that that one\njust now says Success and Failure,\n\n410\n00:20:22.041 --> 00:20:24.220\nbecause I enabled both.\n\n411\n00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.240\nNow, most of these are just like that.\n\n412\n00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:30.181\nI could double click on any one of these,\nturn it on and\n\n413\n00:20:30.181 --> 00:20:33.083\nenter your success or failure or both.\n\n414\n00:20:33.083 --> 00:20:37.180\nAll right, except for audit object access.\n\n415\n00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.850\nThis one is slightly different.\n\n416\n00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:42.120\nWhen I double click on this,\nlooks the same, right?\n\n417\n00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.030\nIt says, yeah, okay,\nI'm gonna turn it on, and\n\n418\n00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:48.430\nI want to do, I don't know let's\ndo success and failure there.\n\n419\n00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:50.449\nAnd I click Okay.\n\n420\n00:20:50.449 --> 00:20:51.310\nIf I can get down to it there.\n\n421\n00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:52.054\nWe'll click Okay.\n\n422\n00:20:54.627 --> 00:20:56.190\nSeems easy enough, right?\n\n423\n00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:57.500\nBut that doesn't work that way.\n\n424\n00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:01.795\nThat one turns on the ability to audit.\n\n425\n00:21:01.795 --> 00:21:03.695\nBut it doesn't tell it what to audit.\n\n426\n00:21:03.695 --> 00:21:06.095\nIt's not gonna automatically\nstart auditing\n\n427\n00:21:06.095 --> 00:21:08.875\nevery single object on that file system.\n\n428\n00:21:08.875 --> 00:21:13.605\nSo, this particular audit category\nworks different from the others.\n\n429\n00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:15.455\nFirst you have to turn it on,\n\n430\n00:21:15.455 --> 00:21:18.775\nthen you have to specify what\nresources that you want to turn it on.\n\n431\n00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:20.430\nOn, on?\n\n432\n00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:21.241\nYeah, on, on.\n\n433\n00:21:21.241 --> 00:21:26.160\nAll right, for example, let me zoom back\nout so I can actually see everything.\n\n434\n00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:30.660\nThis policy is linked to my domain, so\nit would affect my domain controller.\n\n435\n00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.620\nI did object access success and failure.\n\n436\n00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:37.260\nThat will audit both success and\nfailure of audit object access.\n\n437\n00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.860\nBut it doesn't tell it what objects.\n\n438\n00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.202\nSo once I turn this policy on,\n\n439\n00:21:41.202 --> 00:21:45.902\nmy next step would be to tell\nit what objects I want to audit.\n\n440\n00:21:45.902 --> 00:21:50.680\nAnd that means opening up File Explorer,\ngoing to a particular resource.\n\n441\n00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:53.890\nAnd I'm just going to\nmake it a New Folder, so\n\n442\n00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:55.740\nwe can kind of mess around with.\n\n443\n00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:58.080\nHere, I'll call it Audit Test.\n\n444\n00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:02.730\nAnd I'm even gonna put\na file inside there.\n\n445\n00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:07.390\nWe'll call it New File or\nNew Text Document, all right?\n\n446\n00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:11.780\nSo I can go to this document, right\nclick on it and pull up it's Properties.\n\n447\n00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:13.570\nSo it's just a document\nthat I just created and\n\n448\n00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:15.610\nI could do this on the folder as well.\n\n449\n00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:18.656\nIn the Properties,\nI'm gonna look at the Security tab.\n\n450\n00:22:18.656 --> 00:22:21.200\nWe've seen this before when when\nwe were dealing with permissions.\n\n451\n00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.910\nBut I wanna go to the Advanced Security.\n\n452\n00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:27.355\nAnd in Advanced Security\nthere's a tab called Auditing.\n\n453\n00:22:27.355 --> 00:22:29.320\nAll right, I'll zoom out so that you\ncan see what that window looks like.\n\n454\n00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.490\nAll right,\nthere is the Advanced Security settings.\n\n455\n00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:33.610\nI've gone to Auditing tab.\n\n456\n00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:36.950\nAnd the Auditing tab,\nremember how we said in a previous episode\n\n457\n00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:41.170\nthat Security tab for the resource where\nI can add remove people and deny or\n\n458\n00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:45.890\nallow them access, that was the DACL,\nthe Discretionary Access Control List.\n\n459\n00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:49.900\nThis list, the Auditing tab,\nis actually known as the SACL, or\n\n460\n00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:51.998\nthe System Access Control List.\n\n461\n00:22:51.998 --> 00:22:56.420\nAnd the SACL is where you enable auditing.\n\n462\n00:22:56.420 --> 00:23:00.690\nSo to turn on auditing for\nthis particular object, move this up so\n\n463\n00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:02.520\nI can see a little better.\n\n464\n00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.810\nThe first thing we're\ngoing to do is click Add.\n\n465\n00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:08.940\nAnd I need to know,\nwho do I want to audit?\n\n466\n00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:13.100\nSo this might be a scenario where\nmy users have access to this.\n\n467\n00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.870\nAnd I'm okay with them accessing it.\n\n468\n00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:19.272\nBut those contractors,\nI don't want them getting access to it or\n\n469\n00:23:19.272 --> 00:23:22.564\na particular group let's\nsay I don't know Wes.\n\n470\n00:23:22.564 --> 00:23:24.100\nSo Wes is giving me problems.\n\n471\n00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:27.190\nI think he's the one that's changing\nstuff and he's not supposed to be.\n\n472\n00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:29.120\nI can audit an individual user.\n\n473\n00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.020\nI can audit a group of users.\n\n474\n00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:33.350\nI can audit everyone and everything.\n\n475\n00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:38.620\nBut this is another way we can try\nto limit what we're auditing, right?\n\n476\n00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.440\nWe're always trying to make sure\nthat we get everything we need but\n\n477\n00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.950\nnot an extra bunch of stuff.\n\n478\n00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:45.136\nSo if this is a resource that\nmost people should access, but\n\n479\n00:23:45.136 --> 00:23:47.116\nthere's a certain group\nof people that shouldn't.\n\n480\n00:23:47.116 --> 00:23:50.297\nOr everybody can read but\nnobody should be able to write to it.\n\n481\n00:23:50.297 --> 00:23:52.279\nThat's what I can do\nwith this policy here.\n\n482\n00:23:52.279 --> 00:23:55.384\nFor example,\nlet me click select a principle.\n\n483\n00:23:55.384 --> 00:23:58.207\nAnd I'll click Advanced and\nfind that just so I can get a list.\n\n484\n00:23:58.207 --> 00:23:59.311\nI can't remember.\n\n485\n00:23:59.311 --> 00:24:02.216\nI think we did create some\ngroups the other day, Wes.\n\n486\n00:24:02.216 --> 00:24:06.170\nLike sales users or something.\n\n487\n00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:07.308\nLet's see here.\n\n488\n00:24:07.308 --> 00:24:08.194\nYeah, sales users.\n\n489\n00:24:08.194 --> 00:24:09.866\nI'm gonna add that sales users group.\n\n490\n00:24:11.914 --> 00:24:14.778\nAll right?\nSo I'm telling it, who do I wanna audit?\n\n491\n00:24:14.778 --> 00:24:19.244\nAnytime somebody in the sales\nusers group accesses this file.\n\n492\n00:24:19.244 --> 00:24:21.429\nAnd then what kind of access?\n\n493\n00:24:21.429 --> 00:24:23.772\nSuccess, or failure or both?\n\n494\n00:24:23.772 --> 00:24:27.392\nNow this ties back to the setting\nwe did in our policy.\n\n495\n00:24:27.392 --> 00:24:31.393\nIf I only chose success in\nthe group policy where we turned on\n\n496\n00:24:31.393 --> 00:24:36.209\naudit object access, and then I\nchose All here, it's not gonna work.\n\n497\n00:24:36.209 --> 00:24:38.548\nIt'll get success, but\nit won't get failure, right?\n\n498\n00:24:38.548 --> 00:24:42.479\nSo, on the group policy, I'm telling\nit what you're allowed to audit.\n\n499\n00:24:42.479 --> 00:24:46.391\nSuccess, failure, or one or\nthe other, or both, right?\n\n500\n00:24:46.391 --> 00:24:49.690\nBut you can't just enable\nsuccess in the policy, and\n\n501\n00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:53.442\nthen expect to be able to audit\nfailure on the object itself.\n\n502\n00:24:53.442 --> 00:24:57.410\nSo usually you're better off saying\nI wanna do both in the policy, and\n\n503\n00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:02.200\nthen on the individual resources I can say\ndo I want to do all, success, or failure?\n\n504\n00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.062\n&gt;&gt; Mike,\nwith this one you said is a sample.\n\n505\n00:25:05.062 --> 00:25:07.851\nAnd then does that mean that you\naren't assigning permissions\n\n506\n00:25:07.851 --> 00:25:08.859\nover the object here?\n\n507\n00:25:08.859 --> 00:25:11.795\nYou're just saying, hey, these are the\npermissions I wanna audit themselves.\n\n508\n00:25:11.795 --> 00:25:12.594\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n509\n00:25:12.594 --> 00:25:16.147\nThese are just the auditing and\ncontrol who should or does or\n\n510\n00:25:16.147 --> 00:25:17.791\ndoes not have access to it.\n\n511\n00:25:17.791 --> 00:25:19.471\nAnd then what do I wanna audit?\n\n512\n00:25:19.471 --> 00:25:22.221\nAgain, another way that I can,\nI think we already mentioned it,\n\n513\n00:25:22.221 --> 00:25:23.325\nlimit what I'm getting.\n\n514\n00:25:23.325 --> 00:25:26.597\nIf this is the employee handbook,\neverybody should be able to read it.\n\n515\n00:25:26.597 --> 00:25:29.137\nAnd I'm okay if anybody opens it up and\nreads it.\n\n516\n00:25:29.137 --> 00:25:32.797\nBut I am concerned with when\nthey make changes to it.\n\n517\n00:25:32.797 --> 00:25:37.690\nSo maybe I just audit Write\npermissions and not Read permissions.\n\n518\n00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:42.168\nIf I audit both full control, then anytime\nsomebody open it, runs it, writes to it,\n\n519\n00:25:42.168 --> 00:25:44.487\nmodifies it, I'm gonna get that, right?\n\n520\n00:25:44.487 --> 00:25:48.855\nSo again we are thinking about what is it\nthat I really need to have a record of,\n\n521\n00:25:48.855 --> 00:25:51.696\ncuz I want to limit how much I'm getting,\nright?\n\n522\n00:25:51.696 --> 00:25:55.392\nSo I can set my permissions there, I've\ntold it who I wanna audit, sales users.\n\n523\n00:25:55.392 --> 00:25:58.875\nI've told it what\npermissions we wanna audit.\n\n524\n00:25:58.875 --> 00:26:03.009\nYou can add conditions,\nwe're not gonna get into that just yet.\n\n525\n00:26:03.009 --> 00:26:10.978\nThis is a way to add additional filters\nbasically to our audit process, all right?\n\n526\n00:26:10.978 --> 00:26:15.644\nYou can add additional conditional like I\nonly wanna audit if the sales users make,\n\n527\n00:26:15.644 --> 00:26:19.324\nuse read or write and\nthey're doing it through a VPN, all right?\n\n528\n00:26:19.324 --> 00:26:22.968\nWe could things like, or it's after 12PM,\nlike nobody's supposed to touch this file\n\n529\n00:26:22.968 --> 00:26:25.896\nafter lunch because everybody's full and\nthey make stupid mistakes.\n\n530\n00:26:25.896 --> 00:26:29.071\nNo I'm, just kidding, but those are the\nkind of things that I can do, right?\n\n531\n00:26:29.071 --> 00:26:32.192\nI can say users group, member of, value.\n\n532\n00:26:32.192 --> 00:26:33.488\nWe can change all of these.\n\n533\n00:26:33.488 --> 00:26:36.620\nBut for this class, just basic auditing.\n\n534\n00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:38.003\nAnd then I click OK.\n\n535\n00:26:38.003 --> 00:26:42.253\nAnd I did not, let's remove that one,\nand will click OK.\n\n536\n00:26:42.253 --> 00:26:46.834\nAnd there I can see all, success or\nfailure, of sales users,\n\n537\n00:26:46.834 --> 00:26:51.693\nusing read, write, or\nexecute over this resource, all right?\n\n538\n00:26:51.693 --> 00:26:54.862\nNow another thing that we wanna pay\nattention to is these will inherit.\n\n539\n00:26:54.862 --> 00:26:58.412\nYou can see this says Inherited from,\nnone.\n\n540\n00:26:58.412 --> 00:27:01.915\nIf I would've done this, let's say\nthere were dozens of files in here, and\n\n541\n00:27:01.915 --> 00:27:05.284\nI don't wanna modify the system access\ncontrol list on dozens of files.\n\n542\n00:27:05.284 --> 00:27:07.539\nI'm gonna miss one,\nI'm gonna goof up on one.\n\n543\n00:27:07.539 --> 00:27:10.081\nSo I could've done this\nat the folder level, and\n\n544\n00:27:10.081 --> 00:27:14.308\nthen just let inheritance take those\nauditing settings down to the sub objects.\n\n545\n00:27:14.308 --> 00:27:19.039\nYou can also choose to only apply\nit to objects within the folder but\n\n546\n00:27:19.039 --> 00:27:20.316\nnot sub folders.\n\n547\n00:27:20.316 --> 00:27:24.417\nSo we get a little control over\nthe inheritance process of\n\n548\n00:27:24.417 --> 00:27:26.216\nour auditing settings.\n\n549\n00:27:26.216 --> 00:27:29.895\nSo click OK, and okay, and so\nnow I've done the two-step process.\n\n550\n00:27:29.895 --> 00:27:34.631\nRemember that was the point of this story,\nwas to explain that auditing object access\n\n551\n00:27:34.631 --> 00:27:38.269\nis actually a two-step process,\nunlike the other categories.\n\n552\n00:27:38.269 --> 00:27:40.774\nYou have to turn it on in your policy, but\n\n553\n00:27:40.774 --> 00:27:45.365\nthen you also have to tell it what\nobjects that you actually want to audit.\n\n554\n00:27:45.365 --> 00:27:48.486\nNow, all of these auditing that we set up,\n\n555\n00:27:48.486 --> 00:27:51.882\nthe next question would be,\nwhere does it go?\n\n556\n00:27:51.882 --> 00:27:54.418\nWhere are we gonna see the information?\n\n557\n00:27:54.418 --> 00:27:56.621\nAnd that's gonna be in your security log.\n\n558\n00:27:56.621 --> 00:27:57.613\nIt's a Windows log.\n\n559\n00:27:57.613 --> 00:28:05.138\nSo I'm gonna open up Event Viewer,\nAnd I'm gonna expand out Windows logs.\n\n560\n00:28:05.138 --> 00:28:06.810\nAnd I'm gonna go to Security.\n\n561\n00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:10.803\nAnd this is where I'm gonna\nfind my auditing information.\n\n562\n00:28:10.803 --> 00:28:14.145\nAnything that I've chosen to audit is\ngonna show up in the security log.\n\n563\n00:28:14.145 --> 00:28:16.773\nAnd I'm just gonna pick one of\nthese messages at random here.\n\n564\n00:28:16.773 --> 00:28:20.941\nI say random as I peek through them, let's\nfind a logon, there we go, all right?\n\n565\n00:28:20.941 --> 00:28:25.216\nYou can see some details of it down here,\nI can double-click on it and\n\n566\n00:28:25.216 --> 00:28:27.371\npull it out individually as well.\n\n567\n00:28:27.371 --> 00:28:30.411\nAnd I can see an account,\nlet me zoom in for you,\n\n568\n00:28:30.411 --> 00:28:35.202\nAn account was successfully logged on,\nNULL SID, so this was the system.\n\n569\n00:28:35.202 --> 00:28:37.275\nLet's find a better one than that.\n\n570\n00:28:37.275 --> 00:28:42.280\nBut this is a good example of the fact\nthat computers are audited as well.\n\n571\n00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:45.265\nAnother NULL SID I am trying to see if\nI can find where I maybe logged on.\n\n572\n00:28:51.631 --> 00:28:52.631\nYeah.\n\n573\n00:28:52.631 --> 00:28:56.154\nAnyway, it'll be the same information so\nwe'll just zoom in here.\n\n574\n00:28:56.154 --> 00:28:58.868\nBut you can see the security ID,\nin fact, you know what?\n\n575\n00:28:58.868 --> 00:29:01.706\nThe heck with that,\nlet's actually trigger an event.\n\n576\n00:29:01.706 --> 00:29:03.912\nLet me log off and log back on.\n\n577\n00:29:03.912 --> 00:29:04.823\nWe will do it.\n\n578\n00:29:04.823 --> 00:29:08.226\n&gt;&gt; And Mike, while you're doing that,\nI had a thought here.\n\n579\n00:29:08.226 --> 00:29:10.056\nWhen you have the logs, right?\n\n580\n00:29:10.056 --> 00:29:12.429\nYou said you gotta be careful\nwith logging everything.\n\n581\n00:29:12.429 --> 00:29:16.122\nDoes it become a storage accrual problem?\n\n582\n00:29:16.122 --> 00:29:17.315\nIs it a consideration, right?\n\n583\n00:29:17.315 --> 00:29:22.909\nJust how much these logs start to bog\ndown the amount of storage that we have?\n\n584\n00:29:22.909 --> 00:29:25.651\n&gt;&gt; It is, and that's what you\ngotta consider when you're setting\n\n585\n00:29:25.651 --> 00:29:28.722\nup your audit policy and we're talking\nabout what it is we wanna audit.\n\n586\n00:29:28.722 --> 00:29:30.198\nYou got to consider a couple of things.\n\n587\n00:29:30.198 --> 00:29:32.363\nWhere are you gonna store\nthis information, right?\n\n588\n00:29:32.363 --> 00:29:35.783\nThe event log, or store them on a C drive,\nor we can definitely change that,\n\n589\n00:29:35.783 --> 00:29:36.914\nmove it somewhere else.\n\n590\n00:29:36.914 --> 00:29:38.727\nI wanna make sure I've got enough space.\n\n591\n00:29:38.727 --> 00:29:42.464\nI do not wanna miss events\nbecause I have run out of space.\n\n592\n00:29:42.464 --> 00:29:45.909\nSo enough storage space is key,\nand that means monitoring it,\n\n593\n00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:49.426\nseeing how fast it grows over time and\nmaking sure we plan ahead.\n\n594\n00:29:49.426 --> 00:29:55.209\nThe other thing that you've got to think\nabout is who has access to that, right?\n\n595\n00:29:55.209 --> 00:29:59.760\nThat is information that\nneeds to be protected.\n\n596\n00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:02.013\nThere could be sensitive\ninformation in that log.\n\n597\n00:30:02.013 --> 00:30:04.702\nNot everybody has access\nto that in the first place.\n\n598\n00:30:04.702 --> 00:30:08.569\nBut if i store it somewhere insecure,\nsomebody could attempt to get access.\n\n599\n00:30:08.569 --> 00:30:09.950\nWhy do I care?\n\n600\n00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:11.054\nWell, if they are bad guys,\n\n601\n00:30:11.054 --> 00:30:13.880\nthey are gonna be trying to remove any\nrecord of them being in the system.\n\n602\n00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:17.193\nThey are gonna try to modify or\ndelete events out of that.\n\n603\n00:30:17.193 --> 00:30:18.879\nSo we're gonna make sure\nthey can't do that.\n\n604\n00:30:18.879 --> 00:30:23.429\nA lot of companies will separate\nthe ability like administrators that\n\n605\n00:30:23.429 --> 00:30:28.226\nshouldn't necessarily to be the same\npeople to do the auditing, right?\n\n606\n00:30:28.226 --> 00:30:31.716\nAnd configure the audit policy and\nhave rights over that.\n\n607\n00:30:31.716 --> 00:30:35.437\nIf I'm an administrator and\nI get disgruntled, right?\n\n608\n00:30:35.437 --> 00:30:39.942\nI could turn off auditing, do something\nbad, turn it back on to cover my tracks,\n\n609\n00:30:39.942 --> 00:30:43.805\nor remove entries out of an audit\nlog file to cover my tracks, right?\n\n610\n00:30:43.805 --> 00:30:48.346\nWe'll split that up where now I can't,\neven though I'm an admin and\n\n611\n00:30:48.346 --> 00:30:52.512\nI have rights, I shouldn't be\nable to access those log files.\n\n612\n00:30:52.512 --> 00:30:54.406\nLet's see, here is one.\n\n613\n00:30:54.406 --> 00:30:57.863\nI'm not even sure what that event was for.\n\n614\n00:30:57.863 --> 00:31:01.022\nIt's funny, as we look through here,\n\n615\n00:31:01.022 --> 00:31:06.305\nit's crazy how many events get\ngenerated as you access objects.\n\n616\n00:31:06.305 --> 00:31:10.096\nBut here's just an example\nof a typical log event.\n\n617\n00:31:10.096 --> 00:31:14.274\nYou can see security ID,\nlet me make this a little bigger,\n\n618\n00:31:14.274 --> 00:31:17.106\ntells me who is performing the action.\n\n619\n00:31:17.106 --> 00:31:22.986\nThe lab, I can get this to zoom in,\nnow it's not playing along.\n\n620\n00:31:22.986 --> 00:31:25.339\nCuz I rebooted and\nZuma did not wanna restart.\n\n621\n00:31:25.339 --> 00:31:27.934\nSometimes that little program gets me.\n\n622\n00:31:27.934 --> 00:31:29.676\nLet's fire that up again.\n\n623\n00:31:32.999 --> 00:31:35.669\n&gt;&gt; It could be, hit your bread and butter\nbut can burn your toast at the same time.\n\n624\n00:31:35.669 --> 00:31:36.613\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n\n625\n00:31:36.613 --> 00:31:40.663\nIt's important that you guys can see\nwhat I'm actually doing on here.\n\n626\n00:31:40.663 --> 00:31:43.720\nAnd it's taking its sweet time.\n\n627\n00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:44.671\nThere we go.\n\n628\n00:31:44.671 --> 00:31:46.612\nThat's better, all right.\n\n629\n00:31:46.612 --> 00:31:49.812\nSo, there I can see Security ID,\nAdministrator, Account Name,\n\n630\n00:31:49.812 --> 00:31:51.309\nAdministrator Domain, Lab.\n\n631\n00:31:51.309 --> 00:31:54.180\nThe object was a file, all right?\n\n632\n00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:57.996\nAnd it looks like I tried to\naccess the event viewer.msc.\n\n633\n00:31:57.996 --> 00:32:02.669\nIt tells me what process that was, tells\nme what permission I tried to use, read,\n\n634\n00:32:02.669 --> 00:32:05.381\nthis is listing what\npermissions I requested,\n\n635\n00:32:05.381 --> 00:32:08.190\nbecause that would have\nbeen in my access token.\n\n636\n00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:12.192\nRead was granted because of,\n\n637\n00:32:12.192 --> 00:32:17.330\nappend data was granted write was\nnot granted, what other good stuff?\n\n638\n00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:19.330\nWell that's about it, in there.\n\n639\n00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:20.170\nSo those are again,\n\n640\n00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:22.990\nthat's basically an event that we\nwould look at once we go back.\n\n641\n00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:27.400\nNow there's software that we can use\nto help crunch those log files and\n\n642\n00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:30.980\npull information out, and make it\na little more queryable, if you will,\n\n643\n00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:32.350\nput it in a database.\n\n644\n00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:35.810\nI'm looking for all events that\noccurred at a certain date, or time, or\n\n645\n00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:38.930\na particular event ID,\nor a particular user.\n\n646\n00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:42.692\nBut through the event log,\nthere are search capabilities,\n\n647\n00:32:42.692 --> 00:32:45.434\nfiltering capabilities, that we can use.\n\n648\n00:32:45.434 --> 00:32:48.996\nThey don't really go into that in\nthis particular exam but just so\n\n649\n00:32:48.996 --> 00:32:53.401\nyou know there's great ways to come over\nhere and find a particular event because\n\n650\n00:32:53.401 --> 00:32:57.415\nas we add to our audit policy these logs\nstart getting big and it does become\n\n651\n00:32:57.415 --> 00:33:01.555\ndifficult to find the information\nwe're looking for in those log files.\n\n652\n00:33:01.555 --> 00:33:05.875\nSo sorry back to your question, we talked\nabout making you get enough space and\n\n653\n00:33:05.875 --> 00:33:08.910\nmaking sure that you\ncontrol the permissions.\n\n654\n00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:12.082\nNot everybody should be able\nto access those log files.\n\n655\n00:33:12.082 --> 00:33:13.176\nAll right?\n\n656\n00:33:13.176 --> 00:33:16.440\nThe last thing I wanna talk about in this\nparticular episode is something known as\n\n657\n00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.640\na Change Management System.\n\n658\n00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:22.800\nKind of like auditing,\nit does fall into this category,\n\n659\n00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:24.910\nchange management just\nmeans I'm gonna keep track.\n\n660\n00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:27.780\nI've got a process that we go\nthrough before we make changes to\n\n661\n00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:29.035\nsystems on our network.\n\n662\n00:33:29.035 --> 00:33:34.260\nTo usually a ticket based system where hey\nI want to install a new piece of software\n\n663\n00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:35.810\non a server, right.\n\n664\n00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:36.834\nWell, I can't just go do that.\n\n665\n00:33:36.834 --> 00:33:39.120\nI have to put in a formal request.\n\n666\n00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:40.700\nThat's change management.\n\n667\n00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:42.440\nWe're gonna have a management process.\n\n668\n00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:46.690\nThat gives everybody else a chance to\nlook at what you're attempting to do and\n\n669\n00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:48.520\ndecide whether or\nnot it's gonna effect them, or\n\n670\n00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.540\nany of the systems that they manage,\nright?\n\n671\n00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:54.693\nSometimes we get this tunnel vision going,\nand I'm gonna install this software,\n\n672\n00:33:54.693 --> 00:33:57.198\nit's exactly what I need,\nit'll do a great job.\n\n673\n00:33:57.198 --> 00:34:00.554\nBut what I didn't think about was\nthe IIS Manager, and how that might affect\n\n674\n00:34:00.554 --> 00:34:03.980\na website that we're hosting on that\nsame machine, or something like that.\n\n675\n00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:08.763\nSo a change management system is just\na process where we typically tickets where\n\n676\n00:34:08.763 --> 00:34:13.830\nwe put in a request for a change,\nit goes to some group of individuals\n\n677\n00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:21.180\nthat are going to review it and\neither approve or reject the change.\n\n678\n00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:24.980\nAnd then once it gets approved for\nexample we can go and make that change.\n\n679\n00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:28.018\nBut it's documentation for\nthat process and that's helps,\n\n680\n00:34:28.018 --> 00:34:31.291\nas I said, one, make sure I'm not\ngonna implement a change that is\n\n681\n00:34:31.291 --> 00:34:34.380\ngonna affect some system\nthat I wasn't aware of.\n\n682\n00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:38.250\nAlso it's a record of what's been done,\nright?\n\n683\n00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:42.340\nIf it was approved and the change was\nsuccessful,if we ever need to go back and\n\n684\n00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:46.620\nsee what was done, we have a record of it\nthrough that change management system.\n\n685\n00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:51.420\nSo those are something that really every\nIT department should have in place.\n\n686\n00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:54.870\n&gt;&gt; A lot of great information,\ndon't let auditing scare you now.\n\n687\n00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:57.380\nGo ahead and use it,\nit's a great technology to have,\n\n688\n00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:58.480\ngreat features to have.\n\n689\n00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.830\nMike, it does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode, but\n\n690\n00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:03.540\nbefore we do, do you have any final words\nmaybe you'd like to impart to the viewers\n\n691\n00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:04.940\nwhen it comes to auditing?\n\n692\n00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:07.600\n&gt;&gt; Again,\npay attention to your regulations.\n\n693\n00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.219\nA lot of that will dictate\nwhat it is you have to audit.\n\n694\n00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.630\nDon't under audit.\n\n695\n00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:13.640\nDon't over audit.\n\n696\n00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:16.170\nRight?\nYou gotta find that balance in there.\n\n697\n00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:17.700\nStart on the over auditing side.\n\n698\n00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:21.640\nWean it back until you get it to a point\nwhere you're getting everything you need,\n\n699\n00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:24.070\nand you aren't using up\nhuge amounts of space.\n\n700\n00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:24.900\n&gt;&gt; Great advice, Mike.\n\n701\n00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.840\nWe appreciate having you\nhere in the studios.\n\n702\n00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:29.420\nAnd we do appreciate you\nthe viewer watching.\n\n703\n00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.660\nSigning out for\nIT Pro TV I've been your host, Wes Brian.\n\n704\n00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:33.530\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n705\n00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:34.532\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n706\n00:35:34.532 --> 00:35:40.806\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n707\n00:35:40.806

00:00:08.660\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.400\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.269\n&gt;&gt; Hello, again, and\nthank you for choosing ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.198\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:17.198 --> 00:00:18.420\nI'm your host Zach Memos.\n\n8\n00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.070\nAs we continue on with\nMTA Security Fundamentals,\n\n9\n00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.490\ntoday we're talking about encryption and\n\n10\n00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.910\nthe person bringing us all the information\nwe need to know is Mike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.720\nHey Mike.\n&gt;&gt; Hey Zack.\n\n12\n00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.523\nEncryption is the topic of today.\n\n13\n00:00:31.523 --> 00:00:33.280\nAlways a fun topic as well.\n\n14\n00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.687\nAnd here at our MTA it's always important\nthat we have a basic understanding of\n\n15\n00:00:37.687 --> 00:00:38.500\nencryption.\n\n16\n00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.725\nDon't worry, we're not gonna be breaking\nout any mathematical formulas and\n\n17\n00:00:42.725 --> 00:00:45.616\nbreaking these encryption\nalgorithms down for you.\n\n18\n00:00:45.616 --> 00:00:48.421\nHere we just wanna understand\nsome basic concepts so\n\n19\n00:00:48.421 --> 00:00:51.863\nthat we can make good decisions\nwhen talking about encryption or\n\n20\n00:00:51.863 --> 00:00:55.192\nchoosing encryption,\nfiguring out which ones we wanna use.\n\n21\n00:00:55.192 --> 00:00:55.700\n&gt;&gt; Well, fundamentals.\n\n22\n00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.840\nSecurity fundamentals, right?\n\n23\n00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.748\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n24\n00:00:57.748 --> 00:01:00.120\n&gt;&gt; We need to begin by talking\nabout better security algorithms.\n\n25\n00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.477\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's talk about these guys.\n\n26\n00:01:01.477 --> 00:01:03.980\nSo when we talk about\nencryption algorithms.\n\n27\n00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.676\nWe really can classify them in three\ndifferent groups if you will, or\n\n28\n00:01:07.676 --> 00:01:08.770\nclassifications.\n\n29\n00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.554\nThere's symmetric encryption algorithms,\n\n30\n00:01:11.554 --> 00:01:16.622\nthere's asymmetric encryption algorithms,\nand there's hashing algorithms.\n\n31\n00:01:16.622 --> 00:01:19.560\nAnd it's important we understand\nthe differences and the strengths and\n\n32\n00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.480\nweaknesses of those three classes\nof encryption algorithms.\n\n33\n00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.920\nSo let's just break it down.\n\n34\n00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.040\nWhen we talk about symmetric\nencryption algorithms.\n\n35\n00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.008\nThis is also known as\nprivate key cryptography or\n\n36\n00:01:33.008 --> 00:01:35.800\nsingle key cryptography.\n\n37\n00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.571\nBut I like to refer to it as symmetric and\n\n38\n00:01:37.571 --> 00:01:40.540\nwhat that means when we\ntalk about symmetric.\n\n39\n00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.724\nThere's a single key that's being used.\n\n40\n00:01:43.724 --> 00:01:47.402\nAnd this key is used to encrypt and\ndecrypt the traffic.\n\n41\n00:01:47.402 --> 00:01:50.904\nNow, before we go any further, let's\ntake a step back and talk about the key\n\n42\n00:01:50.904 --> 00:01:54.606\nitself because that's something I think\na lot of people have a little trouble.\n\n43\n00:01:54.606 --> 00:01:55.790\nWhat the heck is this key?\n\n44\n00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.620\nThere's no physical key like I put on\nmy front door to unlock this file.\n\n45\n00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.400\nSo what do you mean by a key?\n\n46\n00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.290\n&gt;&gt; It's like a code, yeah?\n\n47\n00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.746\n&gt;&gt; It is it's very similar to that,\n\n48\n00:02:04.746 --> 00:02:07.398\nwhen we look at these encryption\nalgorithms there's only so\n\n49\n00:02:07.398 --> 00:02:10.790\nmany encryption algorithms out there and\nwe all typically use the same ones.\n\n50\n00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.175\nLike a program is hard coded to use\na particular algorithm and you might think\n\n51\n00:02:15.175 --> 00:02:19.423\nwell wait a second, if we're all\nusing the same encryption algorithms,\n\n52\n00:02:19.423 --> 00:02:24.515\nif I can encrypt something, what's to\nkeep you then from decrypting it, right?\n\n53\n00:02:24.515 --> 00:02:29.663\nIf you think back to some of those\nsimple things we did when we were kid,\n\n54\n00:02:29.663 --> 00:02:34.114\nthe little decipher rings\nan a becomes an n, a b becomes an o,\n\n55\n00:02:34.114 --> 00:02:38.160\nc becomes a p,\nthat's a very simple shift algorithm.\n\n56\n00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.687\nIt's like a Caesar cipher type thing and\n\n57\n00:02:40.687 --> 00:02:45.815\nif you know if I tell you that I'm gonna\nshift everything three letters, right and\n\n58\n00:02:45.815 --> 00:02:50.740\nI hand you encrypted text you could then\nshift everything back three letters.\n\n59\n00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.610\nAnd you will get the original back out,\nright?\n\n60\n00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.854\nWell, what a key does, so in other words,\nwe wouldn't be able to show or\n\n61\n00:02:56.854 --> 00:03:00.758\nuse that same algorithm, cuz I'll be able\nto decrypting anything you had encrypted.\n\n62\n00:03:00.758 --> 00:03:05.382\nWhat a key does is a key ends up\nmaking the algorithm unique to you.\n\n63\n00:03:05.382 --> 00:03:08.843\nSo let's say we are using an algorithm\nthat shifts everything three\n\n64\n00:03:08.843 --> 00:03:09.760\nletter, right?\n\n65\n00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.290\nThree letters up.\n\n66\n00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.745\nBut then on top of that\nyou're gonna have a key.\n\n67\n00:03:14.745 --> 00:03:19.610\nYour key might be plus four so\nif you're using an algorithm\n\n68\n00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.180\nthat's shift everything three but\nyour key is plus four,\n\n69\n00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.230\nyou're gonna end up shifting everything\nseven but my key's different.\n\n70\n00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.110\nMy key is negative two.\n\n71\n00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.500\nSo instead of shifting everything three,\nI'm actually only shifting one, right?\n\n72\n00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.130\nNow we'll end up, we'll both end\nup being able to encrypt text, but\n\n73\n00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.210\nif you don't know what key I used.\n\n74\n00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:41.316\nYou know the algorithm.\n\n75\n00:03:41.316 --> 00:03:43.582\nYou know it was plus three.\n\n76\n00:03:43.582 --> 00:03:45.370\nBut what key did I use along with it,\nright?\n\n77\n00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.280\nYou don't know if it was plus three\nplus seven, plus three minus two.\n\n78\n00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.985\nYou could use any number of keys in there,\nso\n\n79\n00:03:50.985 --> 00:03:56.196\nthat's a very simplistic way of looking at\nit, but I think it gets the point across.\n\n80\n00:03:56.196 --> 00:04:00.629\nA key is used in conjunction with\nthe algorithm to make it unique to\n\n81\n00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:05.466\nyour usage so that we can all use\nthe same encryption and algorithm, but\n\n82\n00:04:05.466 --> 00:04:09.598\nI can't decrypt your stuff and\nyou can't decrypt my stuff.\n\n83\n00:04:09.598 --> 00:04:13.500\nBecause the key I used remains secret,\nand you don't know what that key is.\n\n84\n00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.150\nYou know the algorithm I used, but\n\n85\n00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.880\nyou don't know what key I plugged into it,\nright?\n\n86\n00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.720\nAnd we've talked a little\nbit about this before.\n\n87\n00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.650\nI think, in previous episode we talked\nabout how short keys make a weak\n\n88\n00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.670\nalgorithm, because let's say there's only\ntwo possible keys, plus four or minus two.\n\n89\n00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.340\nWell, you don't know which one I used but\n\n90\n00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.120\nhow long would it take\nyou to try both right?\n\n91\n00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.074\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean and you're done,\n\n92\n00:04:36.074 --> 00:04:39.465\nyou've decrypted my stuff because,\nlet me try plus seven or plus one,\n\n93\n00:04:39.465 --> 00:04:42.950\nit's gotta be one of those two,\nthere's only two possible keys.\n\n94\n00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.360\nBut if I had a thousand keys,\nnow try to decrypt my information.\n\n95\n00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.821\nYou're gonna have to\ntry all 1,000 keys and\n\n96\n00:04:49.821 --> 00:04:51.990\nit's gonna take you a lot longer, right?\n\n97\n00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.780\nAnd when we talk about keys and\nencryption, we're talking about\n\n98\n00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.820\nhundreds of thousands and millions and\nbillions of possible keys.\n\n99\n00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.440\nWhich means the computer just\ntakes too long to try to go\n\n100\n00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.640\nthrough all those possibilities.\n\n101\n00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.760\nSo with symmetric, now that we\nget an understand what a key is.\n\n102\n00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.162\nA key is use in conjunction with\nan algorithm to make it unique for you.\n\n103\n00:05:13.162 --> 00:05:15.086\nSymmetric there is a single key,\n\n104\n00:05:15.086 --> 00:05:18.822\nwhat that means is I'm gonna take\nmy data that I want to encrypt.\n\n105\n00:05:18.822 --> 00:05:23.560\nI'm gonna take my encryption algorithm and\nmy key and I am going to\n\n106\n00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.400\nplug the key into my encryption algorithm,\nI'm gonna run the data through it,\n\n107\n00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.410\non the way in, it's known as plaintext,\nit's human readable, right?\n\n108\n00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.142\nI run it through that algorithm\nalong with the key and\n\n109\n00:05:34.142 --> 00:05:37.510\nwhat comes out the back side of\nthe algorithm is encrypted data.\n\n110\n00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.810\nThis is known as ciphertext.\n\n111\n00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.156\nSo we take plaintext, human readable\ninformation, we run it through\n\n112\n00:05:44.156 --> 00:05:48.660\nthe encryption algorithm along with\na key and the output is ciphertext.\n\n113\n00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.890\nNow I'm gonna send that ciphertext\nover to Zach cuz it's encrypted,\n\n114\n00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.410\nno one else can intercept it or they can\nintercept it but they can't read it.\n\n115\n00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.992\nNow Zach has this encrypted data and\n\n116\n00:05:57.992 --> 00:06:03.516\nhe knows what algorithm I used to do\nthe encryption, he wants to decrypt it.\n\n117\n00:06:03.516 --> 00:06:07.450\nWhat he needs is the key that I used\nto encrypt it in the first place.\n\n118\n00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:09.870\nDoes that make sense?\n\n119\n00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:15.648\nSymmetric means the same key is used to\ndo the encryption and the decryption.\n\n120\n00:06:15.648 --> 00:06:19.382\nSo I take the key that I used to\nencrypted it, and I give it to Zach.\n\n121\n00:06:19.382 --> 00:06:23.591\nAnd now Zach can take the algorithm,\nand the key, and that cypher text,\n\n122\n00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:27.386\nrun it through the algorithm,\nin combination with they key, and\n\n123\n00:06:27.386 --> 00:06:30.980\nout comes plaintext,\nthe original message all right.\n\n124\n00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:36.230\nThat is symmetric key cryptography,\nor private key cryptography.\n\n125\n00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.708\nSame key does the encryption and\nthe decryption.\n\n126\n00:06:38.708 --> 00:06:42.180\nNow let's talk about pros and\ncons of symmetric encryption.\n\n127\n00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.010\nIt's very fast.\n\n128\n00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:44.570\nIt's very what we call lightweight.\n\n129\n00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.440\nIt doesn't take a lot of\nprocessing power to perform.\n\n130\n00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.410\nSo computers can do this type\nof encryption really quickly.\n\n131\n00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.530\nIt's good to use when you've\ngot a lot of data to encrypt.\n\n132\n00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:58.388\nSymmetric encryption is almost\nalways the way we wanna go.\n\n133\n00:06:58.388 --> 00:07:03.230\nThe downside of symmetric encryption is\nthat single key because here's the thing.\n\n134\n00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:09.190\nI'm gonna take that key, plug it into\nthe algorithm and encrypt my date.\n\n135\n00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.900\nThen I'm going to send that\nencrypted data over to Zach.\n\n136\n00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.190\nWhat does Zach need to decrypt it?\n\n137\n00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:19.130\nHe needs the key I used to encrypt it,\nso I'm gonna send the key over to Zach.\n\n138\n00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:23.157\nNow if a bad guy intercepted the data,\nit's not that big of a deal because\n\n139\n00:07:23.157 --> 00:07:27.646\nhe doesn't have the key to decrypt it, but\nnow I gotta send the key to Zack because\n\n140\n00:07:27.646 --> 00:07:30.174\nhe needs this because\nhe needs to decrypt it.\n\n141\n00:07:30.174 --> 00:07:34.811\nIf the bad guy was able to intercept\nmy data good chance he's also able to\n\n142\n00:07:34.811 --> 00:07:36.140\nintercept the key.\n\n143\n00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.590\nAnd can the bad guy now\ndecrypt my information?\n\n144\n00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:39.970\n&gt;&gt; I would think he can do that.\n\n145\n00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:43.362\n&gt;&gt; Yes, because he has the cipher text and\nhe has the key that's all he needs.\n\n146\n00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:46.390\nAnd so now the bad guy can\ndecrypt the information as well.\n\n147\n00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:50.940\nSo the issue is symmetric encryption\nalgorithms is key distribution.\n\n148\n00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.540\nHow do I get the key\nthat I used to encrypt it\n\n149\n00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.400\nto the other side where they\nneed to decrypt it securely?\n\n150\n00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.214\nAnd that's a real problem\nwe deal with in networks.\n\n151\n00:08:00.214 --> 00:08:04.556\nIt's either you use out of band methods\nlike I might send the encrypted\n\n152\n00:08:04.556 --> 00:08:06.780\ninformation to MVAE email.\n\n153\n00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:10.490\nBut I'm gonna call him and\ngive him the key needed to decrypt it.\n\n154\n00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:14.240\nThat way, the bad guy hopefully doesn't\nhave access to both, my email and\n\n155\n00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.310\nmy phone system.\n\n156\n00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:19.020\nYeah, but that's a pain, I might write\nit down and walk it over to his office.\n\n157\n00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.827\nBy the time I do that, I could've\njust brought the message to him and\n\n158\n00:08:21.827 --> 00:08:24.250\nnot transmitted on the network anyway,\nright?\n\n159\n00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:28.000\nSo, symmetric encryptions have an issue,\nand that is key distributions.\n\n160\n00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.180\nSomehow I have to get the key needed,\n\n161\n00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:34.840\nto do the decryption securely\nto the other end all right.\n\n162\n00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:39.160\nOther category is known as asymmetric\nencryption, let me back up.\n\n163\n00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.330\nWe call that method symmetric encryption,\n\n164\n00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:46.150\nalso private key because the key\nneeds to remain private.\n\n165\n00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:50.120\nAnybody that gets a hold of\nthe key can now decrypt my data.\n\n166\n00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.310\nBecause there's only one key.\n\n167\n00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:53.290\nIt does the encryption and the decryption.\n\n168\n00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.362\nNow asymmetric encryption.\n\n169\n00:08:56.362 --> 00:09:00.749\nAsymmetric, if we think back to our\nvocabulary, asymmetric is not the same on\n\n170\n00:09:00.749 --> 00:09:05.560\nboth sides, which is giving us\nan indicator of what's gonna happen here.\n\n171\n00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:09.140\nIn asymmetric,\nwe're gonna have two keys, right?\n\n172\n00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:14.538\nThis is known as public key cryptography,\nor asymmetric encryption.\n\n173\n00:09:14.538 --> 00:09:19.559\nAnd we're gonna have like I said two keys\nand these keys are mathematically related.\n\n174\n00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:23.786\nThey're a pair, they're generated in a way\nthat they work together, they're not\n\n175\n00:09:23.786 --> 00:09:27.475\nthe same but there mathematically\nrelated and if you have one of the keys,\n\n176\n00:09:27.475 --> 00:09:31.642\nit's mathematically impractical that you\ncan figure out where the other key is and\n\n177\n00:09:31.642 --> 00:09:33.690\nthat's an important thing.\n\n178\n00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:37.400\nSo, two keys mathematically related\nthey're gonna work together, but\n\n179\n00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.210\nif you have one of the keys, you can't\nfigure out what the other key is, or\n\n180\n00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:42.290\nit's very, very impractical.\n\n181\n00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:47.840\nSo the way asymmetric works,\nwhatever key does the encryption,\n\n182\n00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.060\nthe other key has to\nbe used to decrypt it.\n\n183\n00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:54.925\nLet's say you have key A and\nkey B right so we got key A and key B.\n\n184\n00:09:54.925 --> 00:09:59.039\nIf I encrypt my data with Key A in\nan asymmetric encryption,\n\n185\n00:09:59.039 --> 00:10:02.180\nthe only way to decrypt\nit is if you have key B.\n\n186\n00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:05.480\nYou cannot use key A to\nget the data back out.\n\n187\n00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.750\nYou could flip it around.\n\n188\n00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:11.806\nYou could encrypt it with key B, but\nthen you would need key A to decrypt it.\n\n189\n00:10:11.806 --> 00:10:14.223\nSo whichever key you use to encrypt it,\n\n190\n00:10:14.223 --> 00:10:17.900\nthe other half of the key pair\nneeds to be used to decrypt it.\n\n191\n00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:23.190\nNow, asymmetric encryption algorithms\nare much more processor intensive,\n\n192\n00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:26.960\nthey take a lot more work,\nmathematical calculations to do, so\n\n193\n00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.610\nthey're a lot slower at\ndoing bulk amounts of data.\n\n194\n00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:35.346\nBut they've got a very big upside and\nthat is the key distribution issue that we\n\n195\n00:10:35.346 --> 00:10:39.528\nhave with symmetric encryption,\nbecause different keys are used.\n\n196\n00:10:39.528 --> 00:10:44.533\nNow when we generate those two\nkeys to do a symmetric encryption,\n\n197\n00:10:44.533 --> 00:10:47.816\nwe're gonna call one of them a public key.\n\n198\n00:10:47.816 --> 00:10:52.550\nAnd typically this is put inside a digital\ncertificate that proves your identity.\n\n199\n00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:56.430\nThe other half of the key pair\nis known as your private key.\n\n200\n00:10:56.430 --> 00:11:00.704\nThe public key is named that because\nanybody can have your public key.\n\n201\n00:11:00.704 --> 00:11:03.058\nYou can give it to anybody,\nyou can post on your website,\n\n202\n00:11:03.058 --> 00:11:05.412\nyou can do a mass mailing,\nyou can send it to your mother,\n\n203\n00:11:05.412 --> 00:11:07.842\nyou can put it on Facebook I\ndon't care what you do with it.\n\n204\n00:11:07.842 --> 00:11:11.010\nIt's a public key,\nit's meant to be public.\n\n205\n00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:16.936\nThe private key has to remain private,\nit can not be given to anybody.\n\n206\n00:11:16.936 --> 00:11:20.736\nIt is stored in a secure location\non your computers hard drive.\n\n207\n00:11:20.736 --> 00:11:22.940\n&gt;&gt; So Mike we have actually\nessentially two keys.\n\n208\n00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:27.150\nWe have one that anyone can get or\nobtain and\n\n209\n00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.380\nthen we have the key that\nonly you have is that right?\n\n210\n00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:30.830\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n211\n00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:34.494\nAnd so now lets take that same scenario\nwhere I was trying to send an encrypted\n\n212\n00:11:34.494 --> 00:11:37.650\nmessage to Zach and\nthe problem with symmetric remember.\n\n213\n00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:40.720\nWas if somebody intercepts the data,\nthe encrypted data,\n\n214\n00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.540\nand then I have to send the key.\n\n215\n00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.430\nThey intercept the key, now they can\ndecrypt that information as well.\n\n216\n00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:49.480\nSo let's see how asymmetric encryption\nsolves that key distribution problem.\n\n217\n00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.899\nSame scenario, I've got a message\nthat I wanna send to Zack, and\n\n218\n00:11:52.899 --> 00:11:54.026\nI want to encrypt it.\n\n219\n00:11:54.026 --> 00:11:58.434\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm going to\ntake that asymmetric algorithm and\n\n220\n00:11:58.434 --> 00:12:01.560\nI'm going to obtain Zach's public key.\n\n221\n00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.680\nRemember, anybody can have it.\n\n222\n00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.960\nI can query Active Directory.\n\n223\n00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:09.500\nI can have Zach email me his certificate,\nthat's gonna contain that public key.\n\n224\n00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:14.060\nAnd I'm gonna use Zach's public key along\nwith the algorithm to encrypt the message.\n\n225\n00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:17.590\nSo I take my plain text,\nI feed it into the encryption algorithm\n\n226\n00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:21.040\nalong with Zack's public key and\nout comes ciphertext.\n\n227\n00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.704\nAnd now I send that encrypted\nmessage over to Zack.\n\n228\n00:12:24.704 --> 00:12:28.034\nWell if Zack's public key\nwas used to encrypt it,\n\n229\n00:12:28.034 --> 00:12:32.250\nwhat's the only key that\ncan be used to decrypt it?\n\n230\n00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:35.254\nThe other half of the key pair\nwhich would be Zack's private key.\n\n231\n00:12:35.254 --> 00:12:37.624\nWho's the only one that\nhas Zack's private key?\n\n232\n00:12:37.624 --> 00:12:38.742\n&gt;&gt; Me.\n\n233\n00:12:38.742 --> 00:12:40.200\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully you,right?\n\n234\n00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.411\nIf you've done your job and\nkept that key safe,\n\n235\n00:12:42.411 --> 00:12:44.310\nthen you are the only one who has it.\n\n236\n00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:47.664\nAnd so you can decrypt it because you\nhave have the other half of the key pair.\n\n237\n00:12:47.664 --> 00:12:51.402\nBut if the bad guy intercepted my data,\nhe can encrypt it.\n\n238\n00:12:51.402 --> 00:12:54.638\nBecause I'm never sending\nthe key necessary to decrypt it.\n\n239\n00:12:54.638 --> 00:12:57.610\nThe bad guy might have Zack's public key.\n\n240\n00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.530\nBecause it is public information.\n\n241\n00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:00.336\nBut remember,\n\n242\n00:13:00.336 --> 00:13:04.560\nI used Zach's public key along with my\nencryption to encrypt in the first place.\n\n243\n00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:09.479\nAnd you cannot use the same key with\nasymmetric encryption to get the data\n\n244\n00:13:09.479 --> 00:13:10.210\nback out.\n\n245\n00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:13.130\nThe other half of the key has to be used.\n\n246\n00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.073\nSo by using Zach's public\nkey to encrypt the data,\n\n247\n00:13:16.073 --> 00:13:18.680\nI've ensured that only\nZach can decrypt it.\n\n248\n00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.714\nI can't even decrypt it at this point,\nright.\n\n249\n00:13:20.714 --> 00:13:25.521\nOnce it's encrypted with Zach's pubic key\nthe only key that can decrypt it is Zach's\n\n250\n00:13:25.521 --> 00:13:26.660\nprivate key.\n\n251\n00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:30.469\nAnd as long as we've done our job,\nand kept Zach's private key private,\n\n252\n00:13:30.469 --> 00:13:33.860\nthen nobody else is going to be\nable to decrypt that information.\n\n253\n00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.513\nSo asymmetric solves the key\nKey distribution problem by,\n\n254\n00:13:37.513 --> 00:13:39.810\nthere is no key to distribute right.\n\n255\n00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:41.915\nI've got access to\neverybody's public keys and\n\n256\n00:13:41.915 --> 00:13:44.789\nif I wanna send you out there in\nthe audience an encrypted message,\n\n257\n00:13:44.789 --> 00:13:48.196\nall I have to do was obtain your public\nkey which should be publicly available.\n\n258\n00:13:48.196 --> 00:13:52.787\nEncrypt message with asymmetric encryption\nalgorithm and your public key and now,\n\n259\n00:13:52.787 --> 00:13:55.560\nI can send it to everybody in the world.\n\n260\n00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.396\nBut only you,\nthe owner of the private key,\n\n261\n00:13:57.396 --> 00:13:59.688\nare gonna be able to decrypt that message,\nall right?\n\n262\n00:13:59.688 --> 00:14:03.250\nSo asymmetric solves that\nkey distribution problem.\n\n263\n00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:04.400\n&gt;&gt; Mike, what is hashing?\n\n264\n00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.490\nI know we've talked about that before,\nbut let's talk about it again.\n\n265\n00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:10.103\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, hashing is one of those ones that\nsometimes people will try to argue it's\n\n266\n00:14:10.103 --> 00:14:11.438\nnot actually an encryption algorithm.\n\n267\n00:14:11.438 --> 00:14:16.110\nIt is and it isn't,\nI can kinda see both sides of this.\n\n268\n00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:19.420\nHashing is what we would\ncall a one-way encryption.\n\n269\n00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:24.860\nIt does take something that's in plain\ntext and turn it into an encrypted form.\n\n270\n00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:28.300\nBut the difference between symmetric and\nasymmetric and\n\n271\n00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:33.096\nhashing is that once you hash something,\nrun it through a hashing algorithm you\n\n272\n00:14:33.096 --> 00:14:37.760\ncannot reverse the encryption to\nget the original data back out.\n\n273\n00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.640\nSo as far as protecting files or\n\n274\n00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:44.040\nsending messages hashing\ndoesn't do you a lot of good.\n\n275\n00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.420\nBecause what's the point right?\n\n276\n00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:46.930\nIf I hashed it and I sent it over to Zach.\n\n277\n00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:49.335\nHe's like what is this gobbledygook mean?\n\n278\n00:14:49.335 --> 00:14:50.074\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And there is\n\n279\n00:14:50.074 --> 00:14:52.244\nno way to get the original\nmessage back out.\n\n280\n00:14:52.244 --> 00:14:54.460\nSo it's not gonna do us any good.\n\n281\n00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:58.570\nBut hashing does play a big part in\na lot of things we do in security.\n\n282\n00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:03.713\nBecause an interesting thing about hashing\nis that when you run a piece of data,\n\n283\n00:15:03.713 --> 00:15:06.080\nthrough hashing algorithm.\n\n284\n00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.716\nIt generates what we call a fixed\nlength string or a hash value or\n\n285\n00:15:10.716 --> 00:15:12.122\na message digest.\n\n286\n00:15:12.122 --> 00:15:14.511\nAnd every time, if you take an email, and\n\n287\n00:15:14.511 --> 00:15:18.270\nyou run through this\nhashing algorithm 15 times.\n\n288\n00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:23.484\nIt's gonna generate the exact same\nhash value every single time.\n\n289\n00:15:23.484 --> 00:15:25.349\nChange one letter in that email and\n\n290\n00:15:25.349 --> 00:15:28.190\nrun it through that same\nhashing algorithms again.\n\n291\n00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:30.624\nYou're gonna get a completely\ndifferent output,\n\n292\n00:15:30.624 --> 00:15:33.100\na completely different message digest.\n\n293\n00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:37.360\nSo while hashing doesn't really\nprovide for confidentiality,\n\n294\n00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.830\nwe're not gonna be able to get\nthe original message back out.\n\n295\n00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:42.036\nIt does provide for integrity.\n\n296\n00:15:42.036 --> 00:15:45.210\nBecause I can tell,\nnow if somethings modified.\n\n297\n00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:46.990\nThis happens on your network all day long.\n\n298\n00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:50.240\nIt happens in your operating\nsystem all day long.\n\n299\n00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:54.926\nYour operating system, there's important\nfiles, that it uses to start up,\n\n300\n00:15:54.926 --> 00:15:56.740\nand run your computer.\n\n301\n00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:00.300\nAnd if those files are changed\nmaliciously, that's what bad guys do,\n\n302\n00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.180\nright, they try to change\nthose start up files,\n\n303\n00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:05.560\ninsert malware that can try\nto take over your machine.\n\n304\n00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:10.454\nSo what Windows has done to keep the boot\nprocess safe is it has a hash value,\n\n305\n00:16:10.454 --> 00:16:13.732\na message digest,\nof all those important files.\n\n306\n00:16:13.732 --> 00:16:18.137\nWhen you install Windows it runs each\none of those files through a hashing\n\n307\n00:16:18.137 --> 00:16:20.602\nalgorithm and stores the information.\n\n308\n00:16:20.602 --> 00:16:22.106\nEvery time you start up windows,\n\n309\n00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:24.648\nit runs those files through\na hashing algorithm again.\n\n310\n00:16:24.648 --> 00:16:29.142\nAnd it looks at the output and it compares\nit to the output it got a long time ago.\n\n311\n00:16:29.142 --> 00:16:33.511\nIf those two values match then it knows\nthe file hasnt changed since the beginning\n\n312\n00:16:33.511 --> 00:16:35.630\nand everything is good.\n\n313\n00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:40.520\nIf the operating system starts up and one\nof those files hash values is different.\n\n314\n00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.620\nThat means something\nhas changed that file.\n\n315\n00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.472\nDoesn't know what, can't verify, it\ndoesn't know what changed it, but it knows\n\n316\n00:16:46.472 --> 00:16:50.780\nthere had been a change and it throw up\nan alarm and we can do something about it.\n\n317\n00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:56.470\nWhen we send TCPIP packets across\na network, right, those packets are,\n\n318\n00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:01.770\nthere's a CRC, a cyclical redundancy\nchecker is in the footer.\n\n319\n00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:04.740\nIs basically a hash or a message digest.\n\n320\n00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:08.183\nSo when that packet gets packaged up and\nit is ready to transmit, it runs it\n\n321\n00:17:08.183 --> 00:17:11.862\nthrough a hashing algorithm and it puts\nthe hash value on the end of the packet.\n\n322\n00:17:11.862 --> 00:17:14.263\nAnd then it goes over\nto the receiving end,\n\n323\n00:17:14.263 --> 00:17:18.065\nthe receiving end can run that\npacket through a hashing algorithm,\n\n324\n00:17:18.065 --> 00:17:21.348\ncompare its output to the one\nthat you added to the packet.\n\n325\n00:17:21.348 --> 00:17:27.160\nIf those match, then the received packet\nhas not been changed since it was set.\n\n326\n00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.480\nThe sent packet and\nthe received packet are exactly the same.\n\n327\n00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.840\nIf those values don't match, something\nhappen to that pack and transmission, and\n\n328\n00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.530\nI know to drop it and send it again right?\n\n329\n00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:41.232\nSo we see hashing used all the time.\n\n330\n00:17:41.232 --> 00:17:44.630\nIt's used for when you download\nsomething from the internet.\n\n331\n00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.280\nThis is how you can verify that\nyour download was complete and\n\n332\n00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.100\nthat you got your original file back.\n\n333\n00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:51.028\n&gt;&gt; So it's a great way to authenticate.\n\n334\n00:17:51.028 --> 00:17:52.920\n&gt;&gt; Well, too, to provide integrity.\n\n335\n00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.949\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; To make sure that something has not\n\n336\n00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:56.458\nbeen modified, all right.\n\n337\n00:17:56.458 --> 00:17:58.096\nSo those are my three classes,\n\n338\n00:17:58.096 --> 00:18:02.310\nif you will, of encryption algorithms\nthat we need to be familiar with.\n\n339\n00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:06.860\nYou get symmetric encryption,\nwhich is private key cryptography.\n\n340\n00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:11.048\nThere's only a single key,\nthat key is used to encrypt and decrypt.\n\n341\n00:18:11.048 --> 00:18:14.551\nThere's asymmetric encryption,\nor public key cryptography,\n\n342\n00:18:14.551 --> 00:18:17.760\nit's a key pair that\nare mathematically related.\n\n343\n00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:22.130\nWhichever key does the encryption,\nthe other key does the decryption, right?\n\n344\n00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:24.520\nAnd it solves the problem\nof key distribution.\n\n345\n00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:31.491\nThen we have hashing encryption\nalgorithms which are one-way encryption.\n\n346\n00:18:31.491 --> 00:18:34.321\nThey allow me to check for integrity.\n\n347\n00:18:34.321 --> 00:18:39.393\nBecause I can run something through a\nhashing algorithm and if the hash output,\n\n348\n00:18:39.393 --> 00:18:44.389\nif the message digest has been changed or\nis not matched the original I know that\n\n349\n00:18:44.389 --> 00:18:47.972\nfile or that packet or\nwhatever it is has been modified.\n\n350\n00:18:47.972 --> 00:18:49.475\n&gt;&gt; And I do love corned beef hash.\n\n351\n00:18:49.475 --> 00:18:52.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just thought about that.\n\n352\n00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:56.372\nWhat about encrypting file\nsystems what about that?\n\n353\n00:18:56.372 --> 00:18:57.690\n&gt;&gt; I'd love to dive into it, Zack.\n\n354\n00:18:57.690 --> 00:18:59.668\nBut looking at the clock,\nI don't think I've got enough time.\n\n355\n00:18:59.668 --> 00:19:00.676\n&gt;&gt; You can't do this?\n\n356\n00:19:00.676 --> 00:19:01.860\n&gt;&gt; To squeeze that guy in there.\n\n357\n00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:02.645\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n358\n00:19:02.645 --> 00:19:03.799\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna have to do a part two.\n\n359\n00:19:03.799 --> 00:19:07.420\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so MTA Security Fundamentals\nEncryption Part Two will be coming soon.\n\n360\n00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:08.346\nMike as usual, awesome job.\n\n361\n00:19:08.346 --> 00:19:09.300\n&gt;&gt; Thank you sir.\n\n362\n00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:10.249\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n363\n00:19:10.249 --> 00:19:14.315\nITProTV, you know a good\nIT Pro is always learning.\n\n364\n00:19:14.315 --> 00:19:16.100\nI'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike

00:00:13.450\nwatching ITPROTV\n&gt;&gt; Hello again and thank you for\n\n4\n00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.940\nchoosing ITPROTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.280\nHelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.632\nI'm your host Zach Mines as we continue\non with MTA security fundamentals,\n\n7\n00:00:21.632 --> 00:00:23.270\nthis in Encryption Part 2.\n\n8\n00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.190\nAnd bringing this information\nwe need is Mike Rodrick.\n\n9\n00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.910\nHey, Mike.\n\n10\n00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.680\n&gt;&gt; Hey Zach.\n\n11\n00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.540\nGlad to be back and\n\n12\n00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.980\nyeah, excited because we are continuing\non with our discussion on encryption.\n\n13\n00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.490\n&gt;&gt; And now that we know\na little about algorithms.\n\n14\n00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.070\nLet's maybe talk about how we use them.\n\n15\n00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.630\nWould that be good?\n\n16\n00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like that.\n\n17\n00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.260\nWe got that background information\nin that last episode we did.\n\n18\n00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.820\nWe talked about symmetric\nencryption algorithms.\n\n19\n00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.180\nAsymmetric encryption as\nwell as hashing algorithms.\n\n20\n00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.730\nNow let's talk about where we see these,\n\n21\n00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.585\nhow we use them in an actual\ncomputer environment,\n\n22\n00:00:53.585 --> 00:00:58.230\ncuz typically we're not really picking\nthe algorithm that we're using.\n\n23\n00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.330\nUsually that's hard coded into\nan application or a service or\n\n24\n00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.380\nwhat have you so,\nour decision making comes in and\n\n25\n00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.150\nlooking at I'm trying to decide\nbetween two software applications.\n\n26\n00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.080\nAnd I see this one uses symmetric,\nthis one uses asymmetric.\n\n27\n00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.540\nNow I have an idea what\nthe difference is and\n\n28\n00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.630\nI can make an educated choice\nas to which one I want to use.\n\n29\n00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.370\nBut in the objectives here,\nthey do call out a few things.\n\n30\n00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.080\nAnd one of them being good old EFS,\nor encrypting file system.\n\n31\n00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.790\nNow, this is a way that you can\nencrypt files on an NTFS partition.\n\n32\n00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.360\nRemember, NTFS do technology file system,\n\n33\n00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.650\nthis is a format that we can\nuse to partition a hard drive.\n\n34\n00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.360\nOr it's a file system we\ncan apply to a volume.\n\n35\n00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.370\nOne of the benefits of using NTFS is\nthat it allows you to do file and\n\n36\n00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.070\nfolder encryption.\n\n37\n00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.910\nIt's built in to the NTFS file system.\n\n38\n00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.560\nThere's nothing really extra to do.\n\n39\n00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.030\nIt uses a combination of\nencryption algorithms, actually.\n\n40\n00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.669\nIt uses some symmetric encryption and\nsome asymmetric encryption.\n\n41\n00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.570\nIf you go into a window, you know what,\nlet's just take a look at my screen here.\n\n42\n00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.590\nI'm going to pull up one\nof my vm's real quick.\n\n43\n00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.940\nI'm going to surprise Titus.\n\n44\n00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.980\nLook at that he is good, and I'm going to\nopen up a, just open up file explorer and\n\n45\n00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.840\nI'm going to go over to my documents\nhere and I'm going to make a new file.\n\n46\n00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.190\nI'll make a new text document.\n\n47\n00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.690\nI call it.\n\n48\n00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.197\nWe'll call something like EFS Test,\nall right.\n\n49\n00:02:30.197 --> 00:02:34.480\nNow this is plain text, right?\n\n50\n00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.170\nIt's just a text file that I just created.\n\n51\n00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.650\nBut what I can do is I can\nright click on that file, and\n\n52\n00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.740\nI can pull up its properties.\n\n53\n00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.880\nAnd I can go into the advanced\nproperties down here at the bottom\n\n54\n00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.010\nof that general tab is\nthis advanced button.\n\n55\n00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.790\nIf I click on there,\nthere's a check mark that I can use.\n\n56\n00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.920\nEncrypt Contents to Secure Data.\n\n57\n00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.250\nI put a check mark there.\n\n58\n00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.760\nI click OK.\n\n59\n00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.330\nAnd I click OK.\n\n60\n00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.580\nAnd it's gonna ask me something about do I\nwanna do the file and the parent folder?\n\n61\n00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.490\nOr just the file?\n\n62\n00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.480\nI'll explain in the minute.\n\n63\n00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.530\nI'm gonna choose the file only.\n\n64\n00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.920\nAnd click okay.\n\n65\n00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.910\nNow that file's encrypted.\n\n66\n00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.540\nIn fact, you can looks at the icon for\n\n67\n00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.090\nthe file and\nit's got a little lock on top of it.\n\n68\n00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.330\nNow the cool thing about EFS is that\nit's transparent to the end user.\n\n69\n00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.380\nThis file's encrypted, but if I double\nclick on it, it opens up just fine.\n\n70\n00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.701\nI can type in it, I can save it.\n\n71\n00:03:31.285 --> 00:03:32.410\nAnd I can close it.\n\n72\n00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.620\nNo different than I would any other file.\n\n73\n00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.526\nAnd that's because when\nI chose to encrypt it,\n\n74\n00:03:40.526 --> 00:03:45.390\nWindows generated a key pair\nin the background for me.\n\n75\n00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.600\nIf I haven't been issued one\nfrom my company already,\n\n76\n00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.000\nit'll just generate one for me.\n\n77\n00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.370\nOr if I had one issued to me it would use\nthose, and it took those key pairs and\n\n78\n00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.240\nit used my public key.\n\n79\n00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.780\nWell it did a couple of things.\n\n80\n00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.060\nIt used symmetric key to encrypt the file.\n\n81\n00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.100\nRemember symmetric keys, one key to\ndo the encryption and the decryption.\n\n82\n00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.560\nSo it generated a the symmetric key,\nand it encrypted the file with that,\n\n83\n00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.975\nbecause symmetric encryption algorithms\nare really fast in doing the encryption.\n\n84\n00:04:11.975 --> 00:04:16.410\n[COUGH] And then what Windows is gonna do\n\n85\n00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.630\nis take my public key and\nencrypt the symmetric key.\n\n86\n00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.540\nI think I call this\na session key a minute ago.\n\n87\n00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:24.500\nIt's not a session key.\n\n88\n00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.340\nIt's actually a file encryption\nkey it's a symmetric key.\n\n89\n00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.630\nSo generally it's a file encryption key.\n\n90\n00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.310\nSymmetric, it encrypts the document and\n\n91\n00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.690\nthen it takes my public key and\nencrypts the symmetric key.\n\n92\n00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.650\nSo now the key that I need\nto decrypt the document,\n\n93\n00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.480\nhas been encrypted with my public key.\n\n94\n00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:49.420\nSo I can use my private key to\ndecrypt the file encryption key.\n\n95\n00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.750\nAnd I can now retrieve that\nisometric key and decrypt the file.\n\n96\n00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.890\nBut if Zach tries to\ndouble-click on that file, well,\n\n97\n00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.200\nhis private key is not gonna\ndecrypt the file encryption key,\n\n98\n00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.350\nbecause it was encrypted with my\npublic key, not his public key.\n\n99\n00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.720\nSo now I am the only one that\ncan double-click on that file.\n\n100\n00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.245\n&gt;&gt; Unless you give me your private key,\nright?\n\n101\n00:05:10.245 --> 00:05:12.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so\nwhen you steal my private key.\n\n102\n00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.770\n&gt;&gt; No, I wouldn't rather.\n\n103\n00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.460\n&gt;&gt; And then you could possibly\nget in there, all right?\n\n104\n00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.760\nThat's the way your EFS works.\n\n105\n00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.750\nIt uses symmetric encryption\nto encrypt the actual file,\n\n106\n00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.520\nit uses asymmetric encryption\nto protect the symmetric key.\n\n107\n00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.240\nThis way we get the best of both worlds.\n\n108\n00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.970\nWe use symmetric to do the bulk\nof the work because that could be\n\n109\n00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.200\na one page document,\nit could be a 200 page document.\n\n110\n00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.960\nRight?\nSymmetric is really fast.\n\n111\n00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.440\nWe use that to encrypt it.\n\n112\n00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.230\nThen we just protect\nthe symmetric-key using\n\n113\n00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.780\nthe asymmetric encryption, all right?\n\n114\n00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.210\nAnd this really gives me\na second layer of security.\n\n115\n00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.490\nCuz you might be asking yourself,\nwhy encrypt it, why bother?\n\n116\n00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.320\nI know there's NTFS\npermissions that I can use, and\n\n117\n00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.530\nI can deny Zachaccess to the document,\nright?\n\n118\n00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.500\nWell, what if that document gets copied\nsomewhere where those NTFS partitions, or,\n\n119\n00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.698\nor permissions are no longer applied?\n\n120\n00:05:59.698 --> 00:06:04.590\nOr, somehow Zach gets access I'm\ntrying to think of another way.\n\n121\n00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.270\nHe get, he gets a copy of that file and\ntries to put it on a,\n\n122\n00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.040\na non-NTFS partition.\n\n123\n00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.340\nWell, that encryption.\n\n124\n00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.170\nWill prevent anybody from\ngetting access to that file.\n\n125\n00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:17.380\nSo it's layer of security on\ntop of the NTSF partition.\n\n126\n00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.240\nOr I'm sorry, the NTSF permissions.\n\n127\n00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.160\nI'm having trouble talking today.\n\n128\n00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.580\n&gt;&gt; You need more Mountain Dew.\n\n129\n00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz there's a chance,\nwe talked about permissions and\n\n130\n00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.395\nI said I might give This group\npermissions over this file.\n\n131\n00:06:30.395 --> 00:06:33.840\nZach is not a member of the group so\nhe's not going to get access.\n\n132\n00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.030\nThere's some other admin adds in to\nthe group now all of a sudden Zach\n\n133\n00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.500\ncould get access to that.\n\n134\n00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.400\nIf I encrypt it, nobody is getting access\nto that unless I decrypt it first.\n\n135\n00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.990\nAlright.\n\n136\n00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.450\nSo it is tied to a specific user\naccount when you encrypt a file\n\n137\n00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.700\na key pair is generated.\n\n138\n00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.739\nOr you've already been\nissued one by your company.\n\n139\n00:06:52.739 --> 00:06:54.933\nAnd that's associated with your account,\nso\n\n140\n00:06:54.933 --> 00:06:58.500\nwhen you encrypt something you're\ngonna be the only one that decrypt it.\n\n141\n00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.560\nNow there are ways to share\nencrypted files and that just means,\n\n142\n00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.880\nlet's just say I wanna\nshare that file with Zach.\n\n143\n00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.780\nIf I encrypt it, I'm the only\none who can decrypt it, right?\n\n144\n00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.910\nBut what I could do is share that\nencrypted file with Zach In which case\n\n145\n00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:19.800\nwhat will happen is Windows will get\nahold of Zach's public key, right?\n\n146\n00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.000\nSo now it's gonna take that symmetric key\nthat was used to encrypt the document and\n\n147\n00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.230\nit's gonna make multiple copies of it, and\n\n148\n00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:31.550\nit's gonna encrypt one of those\nsymmetric keys with my public key.\n\n149\n00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.820\nIt's going to encrypt the other\nsubmit copy of the symmetric key\n\n150\n00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.610\nwith Zach's public key.\n\n151\n00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.890\nSo now I can use my private key\nto decrypt one of the copies,\n\n152\n00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:44.010\nretrieve the file encryption key,\nand decrypt the document.\n\n153\n00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.770\nOr Zach could use his private key\n\n154\n00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:51.250\nto decrypt the other copy of the symmetric\nkey and decrypt the document.\n\n155\n00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:55.113\nSo there are ways to share\ndocuments using EFS.\n\n156\n00:07:55.113 --> 00:07:57.423\nIt just takes another step, all right.\n\n157\n00:07:57.423 --> 00:08:00.040\nNow another thing you\nshould be aware of for\n\n158\n00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.730\nthis exam is what happens\nwith EFS files or,\n\n159\n00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:07.837\nEFS protected files when we start copying\nthem and moving them around, all right.\n\n160\n00:08:07.837 --> 00:08:12.640\nWe talked about what happens with NTFS\npermissions when we copy or move files.\n\n161\n00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.930\nWell, what about encryption?\n\n162\n00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:15.071\nWhat happens there?\n\n163\n00:08:15.071 --> 00:08:20.279\nAnd it's a little bit different,\n[COUGH] because when you encrypt a file,\n\n164\n00:08:20.279 --> 00:08:24.659\nit's just gonna remain encrypted\nno matter what you do to it.\n\n165\n00:08:24.659 --> 00:08:28.896\nIn other words, I can't just\ncopy that to anther volume and\n\n166\n00:08:28.896 --> 00:08:31.780\nall of a sudden it's decrypted.\n\n167\n00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.800\nBecause then,\nwhat's the point of encrypting it?\n\n168\n00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.710\nIf I encrypted a file and Zach said,\nhey I'll just copy that, and\n\n169\n00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:40.520\nit's no longer encrypted\nthat's not very secure, right?\n\n170\n00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:45.940\nSo when you copy and move encrypted files,\nthey are going to remain encrypted.\n\n171\n00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.700\nOne of the other things we should be\naware of is that some partitions don't\n\n172\n00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:51.270\nsupport this.\n\n173\n00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.867\nThis is a property of NTFS.\n\n174\n00:08:52.867 --> 00:08:57.032\nSo like FAT, FAT32, FAT16, CDFS or\n\n175\n00:08:57.032 --> 00:09:03.060\nCD file system,\nFAT next FAT that we use on thumb drives.\n\n176\n00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.740\nThose don't support EFS.\n\n177\n00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:10.076\nSo if you try to move an encrypted file to\none of those types of partitions to one of\n\n178\n00:09:10.076 --> 00:09:11.695\nthose types of file systems,\n\n179\n00:09:11.695 --> 00:09:15.022\nthe EFS is gonna have to be removed\nfirst before it can put it.\n\n180\n00:09:15.022 --> 00:09:16.470\nIt's gonna have to be decrypted.\n\n181\n00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:17.410\nSo in other words,\n\n182\n00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:21.510\nI'm gonna have to have permissions to\ndecrypt the file before I can do that.\n\n183\n00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:26.790\nSo if I encrypt a file, and then I wanna\ncopy that file to a thumb drive, or\n\n184\n00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:31.180\nemail it to somebody, it'll work just fine\nbecause my user account has permission to\n\n185\n00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.430\ndecrypt the file,\nI'm the one that encrypted it.\n\n186\n00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:38.120\nSo if I try to attach it to an email,\nit'll get decrypted using my keys, and\n\n187\n00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.310\nI can send the file like normal.\n\n188\n00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:42.220\nIt won't be encrypted, but\nI can still send the file.\n\n189\n00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.442\nIf Zach tries to copy that\nfile to the thumb drive,\n\n190\n00:09:45.442 --> 00:09:48.435\nit's gonna stop, it's gonna give an error,\n\n191\n00:09:48.435 --> 00:09:53.502\nit's gonna say you don't have permission\nto decrypt it, so you're not gonna\n\n192\n00:09:53.502 --> 00:09:58.386\nbe able to copy that over to a file\nsystem that does not support EFS, right.\n\n193\n00:09:58.386 --> 00:10:03.355\nNow I say that and\nI was messing around with it this morning.\n\n194\n00:10:03.355 --> 00:10:05.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I actually learned something\n\n195\n00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:06.380\nnew today.\n\n196\n00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:10.938\nMicrosoft added support to FAT32 for\nEFS files.\n\n197\n00:10:10.938 --> 00:10:12.480\n&gt;&gt; So that's FAT33.\n\n198\n00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n199\n00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:17.247\nBecause it used to be, I was gonna do a\nlittle demonstration, I was gonna show you\n\n200\n00:10:17.247 --> 00:10:20.030\nhow copying it to a thumb drive\nwould strip the encryption off.\n\n201\n00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:22.427\nAnd I did it this morning and\nit was still encrypted and\n\n202\n00:10:22.427 --> 00:10:25.850\nI was like wait a second that's not right,\nthat's not supposed to happen.\n\n203\n00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:29.220\nThis goes against everything I've\nlearned over the last 15 years.\n\n204\n00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:30.370\nWhat's going on here?\n\n205\n00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:34.756\nDid a little research in Microsoft now\nsupport, you can move an encrypted file to\n\n206\n00:10:34.756 --> 00:10:38.645\na FAT32 partition like on a thumb drive,\nthe encryption can remain.\n\n207\n00:10:38.645 --> 00:10:42.220\nThey've set aside\na certain bit to flag it.\n\n208\n00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.850\nNot really important I don't think for\nthis exam.\n\n209\n00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:48.664\nBut it is something that as you're\nstudying I'm sitting here telling you that\n\n210\n00:10:48.664 --> 00:10:49.588\nyou can't copy and\n\n211\n00:10:49.588 --> 00:10:53.450\nencrypted file to a thumb drive unless\nyou are authorized to decrypt it.\n\n212\n00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:55.850\nYou're gonna go home and try it, and\nfind out that it works and go wait,\n\n213\n00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:56.575\nMike was lying to me.\n\n214\n00:10:56.575 --> 00:10:57.335\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n215\n00:10:57.335 --> 00:11:00.057\njust understand that things\nare changing a little bit.\n\n216\n00:11:00.057 --> 00:11:01.090\n&gt;&gt; They change pretty fast, too.\n\n217\n00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:02.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Microsoft added some support, so\n\n218\n00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:06.938\nwe could use a FAT32 partition\nto move an encrypted file.\n\n219\n00:11:06.938 --> 00:11:11.872\nBut normally [LAUGH] what we need now for\nthe exam is yeah,\n\n220\n00:11:11.872 --> 00:11:15.400\nyou cannot, unless you have the permission\nto decrypt the file, you're not gonna be\n\n221\n00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:20.070\nable to copy it to a thumb drive,\ncopy it to a non NTFS partition.\n\n222\n00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:21.950\n&gt;&gt; Mike what is TPM?\n\n223\n00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:23.715\n&gt;&gt; TPM, that's a good question.\n\n224\n00:11:23.715 --> 00:11:29.230\nA TPM that's an acronym for something\nknown as a Trusted Platform Module.\n\n225\n00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:34.580\nThis is a chip that's gonna reside\non most modern motherboards and\n\n226\n00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.980\nit's basically\na cryptographic storage area.\n\n227\n00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:42.060\nIt's a place on your motherboard\nthat your computer can store\n\n228\n00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:46.310\nthings like cryptographic keys, these\nkeys we've been talking about, all right?\n\n229\n00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:50.830\nAnd it's separate, or\nindependent from your computer system.\n\n230\n00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:55.840\nWhat the idea is here is that this is a\nsecure location to store encryption keys.\n\n231\n00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.000\nAnd if a bad guy gets\naccess to your system,\n\n232\n00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.190\nthey're not gonna be able to get access\nto those keys stored on that TPM.\n\n233\n00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:04.585\nThis is a-\n&gt;&gt; It's like a hidden room or\n\n234\n00:12:04.585 --> 00:12:05.450\nsomething like that.\n\n235\n00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:07.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like a vault or a safe.\n\n236\n00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:08.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Or a hidden room exactly, for\n\n237\n00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:12.170\nyour machine to store those keys.\n\n238\n00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:15.529\nAnd it's used with something\nknown as BitLocker.\n\n239\n00:12:15.529 --> 00:12:19.740\nEFS is for encrypting files and folders.\n\n240\n00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:20.630\nAnd I do want to backup.\n\n241\n00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:23.730\nI had done a little demonstration I\nthink in our previous episode, and\n\n242\n00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:27.580\nI forgot to go back and\nexplain the whole option that it gave me.\n\n243\n00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.340\nWhen you encrypt a file in Windows,\nit's gonna ask you,\n\n244\n00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:36.890\ndo you wanna encrypt the file itself or\nthe folder that contains the file?\n\n245\n00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:41.230\nThe best practice is encrypt\nthe folder not the actual file.\n\n246\n00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:44.720\nWhen you encrypt the folder, you're\nnot really encrypting the folder but\n\n247\n00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.610\nyou're marking the folder as encrypted.\n\n248\n00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:51.170\nAnd then anything that gets\ncreated in that folder or\n\n249\n00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:54.500\nmoved into that folder will\npick up that property.\n\n250\n00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.240\nIt goes, wait, I'm now in an encrypted\nfolder, I'm gonna encrypt myself.\n\n251\n00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.720\nSo it makes it easier for you.\n\n252\n00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.215\nYou don't have to go in and\nencrypt individual files,\n\n253\n00:13:02.215 --> 00:13:05.374\nyou can encrypt the folder,\nwhich will encrypt everything inside.\n\n254\n00:13:05.374 --> 00:13:06.100\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n255\n00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.480\n&gt;&gt; And then as you add new files to it,\nthey are automatically encrypted.\n\n256\n00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.240\nThat is the best practice.\n\n257\n00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:17.190\nThe main reason for that is, if you just\nencrypt the file, and not the folder,\n\n258\n00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:22.290\nif you've ever turned on show hidden\nfiles and folders, when you open up, say,\n\n259\n00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:27.090\na Word document, it gets loaded up into\nmemory and a temporary copy is made.\n\n260\n00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:29.555\nIt's hidden so\nyou don't normally see it, but\n\n261\n00:13:29.555 --> 00:13:32.150\na temporary copy is made\nwithin that same folder.\n\n262\n00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:38.140\nTechnically, this could be\nconsidered a security risk because\n\n263\n00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:42.080\nif the file is encrypted, it's gonna get\ndecrypted, loaded up in the memory and\n\n264\n00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.050\nthat temporary copy is also not encrypted.\n\n265\n00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:51.140\nSo a bad guy could feasibly, potentially\nget access to that temporary file.\n\n266\n00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:55.029\nIf the folder's encrypted, even that\ntemporary copy that's made is also\n\n267\n00:13:55.029 --> 00:13:58.430\nencrypted, right,\ncuz everything inside there is encrypted.\n\n268\n00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:02.330\nSo the idea is, encrypt the folder,\nnot the file, all right.\n\n269\n00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:06.345\nJust keep in mind, the folder itself\nis not encrypted, you've just marked\n\n270\n00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:10.687\nthe container so if anything gets inside\nit, will automatically get encrypted.\n\n271\n00:14:10.687 --> 00:14:13.387\nBack to BitLocker now, so EFS is for\n\n272\n00:14:13.387 --> 00:14:19.040\nencrypting individual files or\nfolders that contain files.\n\n273\n00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:23.460\nBitLocker is way that we can\nencrypt the entire drive, right,\n\n274\n00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.538\nthe entire volume is probably\na better way to describe it.\n\n275\n00:14:26.538 --> 00:14:30.620\nRelatively new, it came out in,\ngosh, Windows 7, maybe Windows Vista,\n\n276\n00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.140\nsomewhere around Windows 7,\nWindows Vista, Windows 7.\n\n277\n00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.020\nAnd it's what we call\nfull drive encryption.\n\n278\n00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:39.043\nSo now we're not encrypting\njust a single file or a folder,\n\n279\n00:14:39.043 --> 00:14:41.890\nwe're encrypting the entire hard drive.\n\n280\n00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:47.920\nAnd this is for protection from\ntheft more than anything, right?\n\n281\n00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:53.890\nIf you encrypt the entire hard drive,\nif somebody tries to steal that hard drive\n\n282\n00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:58.657\nand put it into another computer,\nthey can get around things\n\n283\n00:14:58.657 --> 00:15:03.990\nlike file encryption but\nfull drive encryption they're\n\n284\n00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:08.130\nnot gonna be able to take that drive and\nslave it into another machine, all right.\n\n285\n00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:09.580\nThat's the idea behind BitLocker.\n\n286\n00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:12.575\nThere's other products out there they\ncan do this made by third parties.\n\n287\n00:15:12.575 --> 00:15:16.895\nBitLocker is Microsoft's implementation\nof full drive encryption.\n\n288\n00:15:16.895 --> 00:15:18.973\n&gt;&gt; So they would have wipe\nthe whole thing, wouldn't they.\n\n289\n00:15:18.973 --> 00:15:21.453\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they wouldn't be able\nto get access to that data.\n\n290\n00:15:21.453 --> 00:15:26.017\nAnd here's why, because when you\nenable BitLocker, all right,\n\n291\n00:15:26.017 --> 00:15:30.513\nWindows is gonna generate keys\nnecessary to encrypt that drive.\n\n292\n00:15:30.513 --> 00:15:35.082\nAnd it's gonna store those keys\nin that trusted platform module,\n\n293\n00:15:35.082 --> 00:15:38.109\nthat secure location on your motherboard.\n\n294\n00:15:38.109 --> 00:15:39.949\nAnd when you start the system up,\n\n295\n00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:42.990\nBitLocker goes through\na couple of integrity checks.\n\n296\n00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:47.971\nIt determines whether or not the boot\nenvironment has been modified and then it\n\n297\n00:15:47.971 --> 00:15:53.039\nlooks to the TPM to see if it can get the\nkey needed to decrypt that drive, right?\n\n298\n00:15:53.039 --> 00:15:56.546\nAnd assuming that the hard drive\nis still in the same computer,\n\n299\n00:15:56.546 --> 00:16:01.045\nand that the boot process hasn't been\nmodified It's gonna decrypt the drive and\n\n300\n00:16:01.045 --> 00:16:02.914\nallow Windows to boot properly.\n\n301\n00:16:02.914 --> 00:16:07.163\nBut if I was to take that drive,\nI'm a bad guy and I stole your laptop and\n\n302\n00:16:07.163 --> 00:16:09.050\nI can't break your password.\n\n303\n00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:12.751\nSo I'm just gonna try to take that drive\nout and put it in my own computer and\n\n304\n00:16:12.751 --> 00:16:16.107\nsee if I can access it as a slave\ndrive and see what data's on there.\n\n305\n00:16:16.107 --> 00:16:19.189\nWell when that starts up and\nit goes to access the drive it's gonna\n\n306\n00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:22.290\nlook at the TPM chip and\nit's gonna say, wait a second.\n\n307\n00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:24.348\nThere is no key in here,\nthis is not the same computer.\n\n308\n00:16:24.348 --> 00:16:28.060\nI'm not in the same computer that I was\nwhen I was encrypted therefore I do not\n\n309\n00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.960\nhave the keys to decrypt it and\nthere is nothing they can do.\n\n310\n00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.590\nThey'll not gonna be able\nto decrypt that drive.\n\n311\n00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:33.267\n&gt;&gt; That's awesome.\n\n312\n00:16:33.267 --> 00:16:36.095\n&gt;&gt; That is what BitLockers is for,\nlike I said, it will,\n\n313\n00:16:36.095 --> 00:16:39.783\nit make sure that it is still in the same\ncomputer it also looks at the boot\n\n314\n00:16:39.783 --> 00:16:43.105\nprocess it''ll do some integrity\nchecks on the boot process,\n\n315\n00:16:43.105 --> 00:16:45.831\nto determine that nothing has changed,\nall right.\n\n316\n00:16:45.831 --> 00:16:48.830\nThat's what BitLocker's all about,\nfull drive encryption.\n\n317\n00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:51.036\nTo enable BitLocker,\nwe got a couple requirements.\n\n318\n00:16:51.036 --> 00:16:56.237\nOne, we need either a motherboard that has\na TPM chip, and it needs a version 1.2 or\n\n319\n00:16:56.237 --> 00:17:01.310\nlater, all right, somewhere to\nstore those cryptographic keys.\n\n320\n00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:05.920\nIf you don't have a TPM chip,\nyou can store the keys\n\n321\n00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:10.760\non a removable hard drive, like a flash\ndrive, a little thumb drive, all right?\n\n322\n00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.861\nBut now that thumb drive\nbecomes like a start up key.\n\n323\n00:17:13.861 --> 00:17:17.193\nIf you don't have the thumb drive with\nyou and you start up your computer,\n\n324\n00:17:17.193 --> 00:17:20.761\nthere's no keys to decrypt the drive and\nyou won't be be able to boot Windows.\n\n325\n00:17:20.761 --> 00:17:24.731\nBut if you can put the thumb drive in,\nit can now get the decryption keys,\n\n326\n00:17:24.731 --> 00:17:28.070\ndecrypted the drive and\nallow Windows to start as it should.\n\n327\n00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:29.660\n&gt;&gt; So,\nyou should wear that around your neck.\n\n328\n00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:32.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you need to keep that\nsomewhere where you can find it right.\n\n329\n00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.940\nAnd you need to make sure it's secure,\nbecause if anybody else gets it,\n\n330\n00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:40.065\nthey can now start-up your computer,\nplug that thumb drive and\n\n331\n00:17:40.065 --> 00:17:43.220\nstart-up the computer, and\ndecrypt the drive just like normal.\n\n332\n00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:47.469\nSo using a removal drive is not\nas secure as using the TPM chip,\n\n333\n00:17:47.469 --> 00:17:50.985\nit also cannot do the initial\nintegrity checks when\n\n334\n00:17:50.985 --> 00:17:55.829\nyou're using a thumb drive to store\nthe keys rather than the TPM ship.\n\n335\n00:17:55.829 --> 00:18:00.570\nBecause the operating system kinda have\nto start up, load up those USB drivers.\n\n336\n00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:04.200\nAccess the USB thumb drive\nto get those keys back.\n\n337\n00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.650\nSo, the boot process\nis already started and\n\n338\n00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:11.672\nit wasn't able to check the boot process,\nright?\n\n339\n00:18:11.672 --> 00:18:16.064\nSo it's not quite as secure as say using\na TPM but if you don't have a TPM,\n\n340\n00:18:16.064 --> 00:18:19.810\nif you got an older motherboard\nthat doesn't have a TPM chip,\n\n341\n00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:24.530\nthis is how you can still use\nBitLocker with that system, all right?\n\n342\n00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:28.140\nOther requirements you're gonna\nneed at least two partitions.\n\n343\n00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:32.803\nBecause when you do BitLocker, right.\n\n344\n00:18:32.803 --> 00:18:38.323\nThat initial process of checking\nthe integrity of the startup files and\n\n345\n00:18:38.323 --> 00:18:41.140\ngrabbing the keys out of the TPM.\n\n346\n00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:44.500\nThose rules have to be unencrypted.\n\n347\n00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:49.291\nSo they creates a little 200 megabyte\npartition that contains the initial\n\n348\n00:18:49.291 --> 00:18:53.135\nstartup files,\nwhat's gonna start the whole boot process.\n\n349\n00:18:53.135 --> 00:18:54.730\nThat part is unencrypted.\n\n350\n00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:57.130\nThe rest of your operating system,\nyour files and\n\n351\n00:18:57.130 --> 00:19:00.230\nyour data, goes on the second\nvolume that's what gets encrypted.\n\n352\n00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:03.620\nSo there's a little 200 megabyte\nunencrypted volume, and\n\n353\n00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.570\nthen all of the rest of your\ndata that is encrypted.\n\n354\n00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:11.510\nIf you don't have that second partition,\nWhen you enable Bitlocker,\n\n355\n00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:15.940\nit will create a second partition\nthat's gonna remain unencrypted, and\n\n356\n00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:19.730\nthe rest of the volumes can\nthen be encrypted, all right.\n\n357\n00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:23.550\nWhen you install Windows nowadays,\nit'll automatically creates that\n\n358\n00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:27.690\nlittle 200 megabyte partition,\nso it's usually already there.\n\n359\n00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:32.891\nThird requirement,\nyour BIOS has to support either the TPM.\n\n360\n00:19:32.891 --> 00:19:39.340\nSo if your mother board has a TPM and\nthe BIOS supports it you can use that.\n\n361\n00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:40.580\nOr if you're not using TPM,\n\n362\n00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:43.760\nif you're using the thumb drives\nto store the encryption keys.\n\n363\n00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.220\nThen your BIOS has to support USB, right?\n\n364\n00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:51.447\nIf your BIOS doesn't support USB If\nyou have to wait till Windows loads to\n\n365\n00:19:51.447 --> 00:19:54.428\nget access to USB you can't\nget the decryption keys\n\n366\n00:19:54.428 --> 00:19:57.019\nbefore windows loads does that make sense?\n\n367\n00:19:57.019 --> 00:19:57.771\n&gt;&gt; The cart before horse.\n\n368\n00:19:57.771 --> 00:19:58.524\n&gt;&gt; Yes exactly.\n\n369\n00:19:58.524 --> 00:20:02.261\nWindows is encrypted and\nyou need the keys to decrypt it but\n\n370\n00:20:02.261 --> 00:20:07.151\nyou can't get to the USB until windows\nloads and so its's never gonna work.\n\n371\n00:20:07.151 --> 00:20:10.955\nNow, modern buyers they all support USB so\nshouldn't be a problem but\n\n372\n00:20:10.955 --> 00:20:14.887\nif you got an older system, this is\none of the requirements for testing or\n\n373\n00:20:14.887 --> 00:20:17.726\nif you're trying to implement\nas an older systems,\n\n374\n00:20:17.726 --> 00:20:22.250\nunderstand that is one of the requirements\nif you're gonna use that option.\n\n375\n00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:25.248\nIf you're using TPM then you can store\nthe keys there and it doesn't matter.\n\n376\n00:20:25.248 --> 00:20:29.173\nIf you're gonna use USB to store\nthe keys your BIOS has to support it.\n\n377\n00:20:29.173 --> 00:20:35.525\nYou also typically have to turn on the\nTPM, you have to enable it in the BIOS,\n\n378\n00:20:35.525 --> 00:20:39.595\nso if you go to enable BitLocker and\nit tells you,\n\n379\n00:20:39.595 --> 00:20:45.330\nyou don't have a TPM but\nyou know you do check your BIOS settings.\n\n380\n00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:47.930\nBoot up,\ndo your hotkey to get into your BIOS.\n\n381\n00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:51.080\nAnd usually there's an option\nin there to enable the TPM.\n\n382\n00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.570\nOnce you turn that on, and\nyou reboot your system,\n\n383\n00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:56.210\nthen you should be able to go into\nWindows and enable BitLocker.\n\n384\n00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:59.503\nAnd you can do that through the Control\nPanel, there's a Bitlocker applet.\n\n385\n00:20:59.503 --> 00:21:03.322\nOr you can typically right-click on\none of the drives in Windows Explorer,\n\n386\n00:21:03.322 --> 00:21:05.660\nand choose to enable BitLocker.\n\n387\n00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:06.436\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n388\n00:21:06.436 --> 00:21:07.640\n&gt;&gt; It is, it's a great thing.\n\n389\n00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:11.220\nNow, there's another thing, a couple of\nmore things we wanna talk about with TPM.\n\n390\n00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.935\nI mean, I'm sorry, with BitLocker.\n\n391\n00:21:12.935 --> 00:21:16.411\nThere're several operational\nmodes associated with BitLocker.\n\n392\n00:21:16.411 --> 00:21:18.300\nThere's TPM and Startup Key.\n\n393\n00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:20.340\nThere's TPM and Startup PIN.\n\n394\n00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:22.470\nThere's TPM only.\n\n395\n00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:24.130\nThere's Startup Key only.\n\n396\n00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:27.960\nAnd then there's TPM plus startup\nkey plus startup pin, all right.\n\n397\n00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:32.000\nSo basically, let's make that\na little more simple shall we.\n\n398\n00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.110\nEither you have a TPM or\nyou don't, all right.\n\n399\n00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:37.101\nAnd when you enable BitLocker,\n\n400\n00:21:37.101 --> 00:21:40.575\nyou can choose how do you want\nthe drive to be decrypted.\n\n401\n00:21:40.575 --> 00:21:45.080\nDo you want only store\nthe encryption key in the TPM?\n\n402\n00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.890\nSo as long as the hard drive's\nin the original computer, and\n\n403\n00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:51.350\nthe start-up files haven't changed,\nit could go to the TPM,\n\n404\n00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:55.570\nget the key, decrypt the drive,\nWindows starts, and we're good to go.\n\n405\n00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:57.620\nThat's TPM only.\n\n406\n00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:02.025\nBut I can enable multi-factor\nwith this BitLocker.\n\n407\n00:22:02.025 --> 00:22:06.318\nI can say, not only do you need\nthe key that's stored in the TPM.\n\n408\n00:22:06.318 --> 00:22:08.435\nBut you're also gonna need a pin.\n\n409\n00:22:08.435 --> 00:22:13.506\nSo in Boot process it'ill check the system\nintegrity, it can get the key from the TPN\n\n410\n00:22:13.506 --> 00:22:18.078\nchip to decrypt the drive but before it\ndoes it's gonna require you to type in\n\n411\n00:22:18.078 --> 00:22:23.170\na pin, some type of number that has been a\nsecurity code that you've assigned to it.\n\n412\n00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:27.559\nAnd so if you don't know the security code\nyou're not gonna be able to start Windows\n\n413\n00:22:27.559 --> 00:22:32.140\nso if you're in a situation where\nlet's say Zach walk up to my computer.\n\n414\n00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:33.571\nWell, if he turns it on and\n\n415\n00:22:33.571 --> 00:22:37.358\nI'm doing TPN Only then the computer\nwill boot up just fine, right?\n\n416\n00:22:37.358 --> 00:22:40.166\nBecause it can get the key out of the TPN,\nit can decrypt the drive and\n\n417\n00:22:40.166 --> 00:22:41.108\nit can start Windows.\n\n418\n00:22:41.108 --> 00:22:45.363\nAnd now Zach could sit on my log on screen\nand attempt to do password guessing or\n\n419\n00:22:45.363 --> 00:22:47.280\nwhatever else he's trying to do.\n\n420\n00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:51.390\nIf I do TPM plus pin,\nif he tries to start my computer, but\n\n421\n00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:55.430\nhe doesn't know the pin, it's never gonna\ndecrypt the drive to start Windows.\n\n422\n00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:57.144\nIt's not gonna get pass that boot process.\n\n423\n00:22:57.144 --> 00:23:01.724\nSo now not only do you need the decryption\nkey, which is stored in the TPM, but\n\n424\n00:23:01.724 --> 00:23:04.280\nyou also need a pin as well.\n\n425\n00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:09.650\nYou could do a startup key\nwhich is a second, key.\n\n426\n00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:12.690\nJust like we talk about the encryption\nkeys,, it's just another key.\n\n427\n00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:17.190\nSo we can store in the TPM,\nwe can store the decryption key,\n\n428\n00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:19.264\nas well as the start up key.\n\n429\n00:23:19.264 --> 00:23:21.930\nI'm sorry, the start up key\ndoesn't get stored in the TPM.\n\n430\n00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:25.470\nThe start up key gets\nstored on a thumb drive.\n\n431\n00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:27.836\nSo now you would have to\nstart the computer and\n\n432\n00:23:27.836 --> 00:23:31.240\ninsert the thumb drive that\ncontains the startup key.\n\n433\n00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.514\nSo even though the TPM\nhas the decryption key,\n\n434\n00:23:33.514 --> 00:23:37.782\nif you don't have the thumb drive with the\nstartup key, it's not gonna boot Windows.\n\n435\n00:23:37.782 --> 00:23:38.940\nIt's not gonna be able\nto decrypt the drive.\n\n436\n00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:41.690\nYou can do startup key only.\n\n437\n00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:43.401\nThis is the one we just talked about.\n\n438\n00:23:43.401 --> 00:23:45.629\nIf you don't have a TPM chip,\n\n439\n00:23:45.629 --> 00:23:50.279\nyou can use just the USB thumb\ndrive that's start up key only.\n\n440\n00:23:50.279 --> 00:23:53.937\nYou can also do TPM plus start\nup pin plus start up key.\n\n441\n00:23:53.937 --> 00:23:56.002\nYeah, you can bring all of them into play.\n\n442\n00:23:56.002 --> 00:24:00.990\nSo in order to boot your system, the\ndecryption key is stored in the TPM chip.\n\n443\n00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:03.345\nA start up key is stored on a thumb drive.\n\n444\n00:24:03.345 --> 00:24:05.280\nYou'd have to put in the start up key,\n\n445\n00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.210\nthe thumb drive that\ncontains the start up key.\n\n446\n00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:08.890\nYou'd have to boot your system.\n\n447\n00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:11.550\nAnd then you would have\nto supply a PIN as well.\n\n448\n00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:14.290\nAll right, so we need all three.\n\n449\n00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:19.410\nThe decryption key that's stored in the\nTPM chip, the PIN that you have to supply,\n\n450\n00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:22.680\nand the thumb drive that contains\nthe startup key, all right?\n\n451\n00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.780\nThat'd be just one more layer of security.\n\n452\n00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:26.747\n&gt;&gt; A triple layer of protection.\n\n453\n00:24:26.747 --> 00:24:32.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now, the TPM plus PIN plus\nstartup key, that's only available\n\n454\n00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:37.160\nin Enterprise environments where I can use\na GPO, a group policy, to enable that.\n\n455\n00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.968\nThat's really for\nhigh security systems, right?\n\n456\n00:24:39.968 --> 00:24:42.639\nTypically not done on your\nend user workstations.\n\n457\n00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.815\nAll right, so let's see.\n\n458\n00:24:45.815 --> 00:24:47.440\nWe talked about BitLocker.\n\n459\n00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.080\nWe talked about the different modes.\n\n460\n00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:52.240\nOne more thing with BitLocker,\nis something known as BitLocker To Go.\n\n461\n00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:55.210\nWhen we talk about BitLocker,\nwe're talking about\n\n462\n00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:58.890\nthe fixed drives within my computer,\nmy operating system drive.\n\n463\n00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:02.880\nAnd if I have other drives, data drives,\nother physical drives, solid state or\n\n464\n00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.090\nmechanical, doesn't matter.\n\n465\n00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:06.490\nThat's what we use BitLocker for.\n\n466\n00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:09.400\nBitlocker To Go is for thumb drives.\n\n467\n00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:14.700\nI love Bitlocker To Go, because we've\ntalked about how thumb drives are,\n\n468\n00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:16.980\nthey're one of the banes of security.\n\n469\n00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:20.360\nCuz people use them to copy sensitive\ninformation and move it from one computer\n\n470\n00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:24.330\nto the other, or take it home with them,\nand they're so easy to lose.\n\n471\n00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:27.080\nIf anybody picks that thumb drive up,\nthey can plug it in their computer,\n\n472\n00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.420\nand they can read that\ninformation on there.\n\n473\n00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:33.490\nBitLocker To Go allows me to\nencrypt those removal drives.\n\n474\n00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:37.150\nAnd so now I can encrypt my\nthumb drive using BitLocker.\n\n475\n00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:43.220\nAnd when I plug it in I'm gonna have to\nsupply a PIN, a code to decrypt the drive.\n\n476\n00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:46.140\nSo if I BitLocker To Go\nprotect the thumb drive, and\n\n477\n00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:49.485\nI leave it at a restaurant,\nif somebody picks that thumb drive up and\n\n478\n00:25:49.485 --> 00:25:51.930\ntries to put it into their computer,\nit's not gonna decrypt it.\n\n479\n00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:55.030\nThey're not gonna get to the information\non it because they don't know the PIN\n\n480\n00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:56.683\nneeded to decrypt that.\n\n481\n00:25:56.683 --> 00:26:00.020\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\nSo BitLocker To Go is a fantastic thing.\n\n482\n00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:01.880\nYou can even set it up to auto-unlock,\n\n483\n00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.390\nwhich is another one of\nmy favorite features.\n\n484\n00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:06.390\nBecause I encrypt my thumb drive,\nbut now it's a pain.\n\n485\n00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:10.590\nEvery time I put it in my computer I gotta\nremember that silly PIN and type it in.\n\n486\n00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:12.910\nOr I can to turn on auto-unlock.\n\n487\n00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:17.370\nAnd so, when I plug it into my\ncomputer it knows my computer and\n\n488\n00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:19.245\nit'll automatically\ndecrypt the thumb drive.\n\n489\n00:26:19.245 --> 00:26:21.120\nBut if anybody finds it and\n\n490\n00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:25.280\nplugs it their computer, it realizes\nit's not in the original computer and\n\n491\n00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.516\nit doesn't automatically unlock and\nthey will have to spry the PIN.\n\n492\n00:26:27.516 --> 00:26:29.270\n&gt;&gt; Wow, awesome.\n&gt;&gt; So it's a great little feature.\n\n493\n00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:32.950\n&gt;&gt; Do we have time to talk about\nmaybe some software based encryption?\n\n494\n00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:35.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so, I think we might be\nable to squeeze a little more in here.\n\n495\n00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:37.210\nI know I've been\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n496\n00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:39.450\n&gt;&gt; A lot to say about encryption here.\n\n497\n00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:40.471\n&gt;&gt; And you're doing a great job.\n\n498\n00:26:40.471 --> 00:26:44.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Software-based encryption is\nreally what we've been talking about.\n\n499\n00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.790\nEFS is software-based encryption.\n\n500\n00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:48.550\nBitLocker is software-based.\n\n501\n00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:53.110\nAnd basically it means we're using\nan application to do the encryption\n\n502\n00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:58.960\nversus hardware-based encryption is when\nwe have some type of offload process where\n\n503\n00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:04.430\nwe, because encryption can\nbe a processor intensive\n\n504\n00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:07.140\nprocess if that's not redundant, right?\n\n505\n00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:11.530\nAnd so we can offload some\nof that encryption work\n\n506\n00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:15.460\nto an actual hardware device\nthat does nothing but\n\n507\n00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:19.760\ndo the calculations required to encrypt or\ndecrypt.\n\n508\n00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.210\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n&gt;&gt; Another area we wanna talk about is\n\n509\n00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:23.750\nmail, right?\n\n510\n00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:29.140\nWe've said that e-mail just should\nbe considered insecure, right?\n\n511\n00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:31.520\nThere are some things we\ncan do to try to secure it.\n\n512\n00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:36.410\nAnd we can basically,\nwe can encrypt our e-mails.\n\n513\n00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:39.530\nThere's a couple of protocols that we want\nto be familiar with that can do this.\n\n514\n00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:40.910\nOne is SMIME.\n\n515\n00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:44.920\nAnd I always have to look,\ncause this is one I never verbalize.\n\n516\n00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:50.840\nSMIME is secure multi-purpose\nInternet mail extension.\n\n517\n00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:56.190\nMIME is an older protocol that we used\nwith e-mails to put on attachments and\n\n518\n00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:57.305\nphotos and things like that.\n\n519\n00:27:57.305 --> 00:28:00.150\nAnd that was multipurpose\nInternet mail extension.\n\n520\n00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:02.380\nAllowed me to extend\nthe functionality of e-mail, right?\n\n521\n00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:04.340\nAttachments and things like that.\n\n522\n00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:08.280\nSMIME, or secure multi-purpose\nInternet mail extension,\n\n523\n00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.670\nis a way that I can encrypt e-mails,\nright?\n\n524\n00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:15.500\nNow this is gonna be supported by whatever\napplication you used whether that's\n\n525\n00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:20.770\nOutlook or some Web based that\nyour e-mail application would\n\n526\n00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:23.590\nhave to support encrypting e-mails.\n\n527\n00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:27.870\nAnother protocol we can use to encrypt\ne-mail is something known as PGP,\n\n528\n00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:29.685\nor pretty good privacy.\n\n529\n00:28:29.685 --> 00:28:34.335\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHTER]\n&gt;&gt; It's a great name.\n\n530\n00:28:34.335 --> 00:28:35.640\nBut it is.\n\n531\n00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.830\nIt's been around for a long time.\n\n532\n00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:39.870\nI want to say Semantec now owns it.\n\n533\n00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:41.510\nIt's no longer free.\n\n534\n00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:44.440\nWe used to talk about it\nas a free alternative, but\n\n535\n00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.820\nunfortunately it's no longer free.\n\n536\n00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:49.330\nBut for this exam,\nbe aware of those two protocols.\n\n537\n00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:51.420\nIf you wanna encrypt e-mail,\n\n538\n00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:56.189\ntwo of the most popular ways to\ndo that are using S/MIME or PGP.\n\n539\n00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:00.580\nI think we've talked enough about VPNs or\nvirtual private networks.\n\n540\n00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:04.610\nIf you wanna rehash on that make sure you\ngo check out the episodes were we talked\n\n541\n00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:08.070\nabout VPNs as well as public and\nprivate key.\n\n542\n00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:09.990\nCheck out part one of this episode.\n\n543\n00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.900\n&gt;&gt; My goodness, yeah.\n\n544\n00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:14.250\n&gt;&gt; We talk all about the difference\nthere and what that means.\n\n545\n00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:16.709\nSo that leaves us with what, certificates.\n\n546\n00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:22.800\nAnd certificates\nare electronic documents that\n\n547\n00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:26.040\ntie your identity to a key pair, right?\n\n548\n00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.010\nThat's a technical definition, and\n\n549\n00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:30.810\nlet's break that down\na little bit further, right?\n\n550\n00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:32.490\nA certificate is an electronic document,\n\n551\n00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:34.320\nmeaning it's not a piece\nof paper we print out.\n\n552\n00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:38.540\nIt's a file, it's an electronic\ndocument on my system, and\n\n553\n00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:43.280\nit's issued by something known\nas a certificate authority.\n\n554\n00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:46.060\nA certificate authority\ngenerates certificates.\n\n555\n00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:47.280\nYou have to apply for them.\n\n556\n00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:50.660\nYou provide information, just like\nwhen you go get a driver's license.\n\n557\n00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:51.550\nYou can't just go in there and\n\n558\n00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:56.460\nsay, hey, my name's Bill Gates and I want\na driver's license that says that, right?\n\n559\n00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:57.210\nIt's not gonna work.\n\n560\n00:29:57.210 --> 00:29:59.840\nYou've gotta prove who you\nare before they're gonna issue you\n\n561\n00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:00.950\na driver's license.\n\n562\n00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:02.980\nYou gotta bring in birth certificates,\n\n563\n00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:07.690\nSocial Security numbers, utility bills,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n564\n00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:10.200\nSame thing happens with\nthe certificate authority.\n\n565\n00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.020\nYou're gonna provide information.\n\n566\n00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:14.640\nIf you are doing this through a third\nparty out on the Internet you might have\n\n567\n00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:18.640\nto mail them documents, you might\neven have to go visit them personally\n\n568\n00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.390\ndepending on how what type of\ncertificate I am trying to buy.\n\n569\n00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:26.840\nIf I am doing this internally in my\ncompany, that information could be pulled\n\n570\n00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:30.880\nfrom Active directory because it already\nknows who I am and stuff like that.\n\n571\n00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.490\nBut the point is you prove\nyour identity one way or\n\n572\n00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:35.670\nthe other to the certificate authority,\nand\n\n573\n00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:39.730\nthen the certificate authority does\ntwo things, it generates a key pair.\n\n574\n00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:42.470\nRemember we were talking about\nasymmetric and key pairs?\n\n575\n00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:46.960\nIt's gonna generate a key pair,\nit's gonna take your public key and\n\n576\n00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:51.150\nput it in the certificate along with\nyour other identifying information, and\n\n577\n00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:56.260\nit's going to then deliver to you\na certificate and a private key.\n\n578\n00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:59.720\nAnd the private key is gonna get\nstored securely on your hard drive.\n\n579\n00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.150\nAnd now you're gonna have\nthe certificate that goes with it.\n\n580\n00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:07.830\nSo now you have a certificate that has\na public key in it and a private key.\n\n581\n00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:12.120\nAnd you could now do asymmetric\nencryption using that certificate and\n\n582\n00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.660\nassociated private key.\n\n583\n00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:15.850\nAnd it's tied to your identity.\n\n584\n00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:19.520\nBecause that certificate is, like I said,\nlike a driver's license or a passport.\n\n585\n00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:22.380\nAll your identifying\ninformation was verified\n\n586\n00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:25.360\nbefore that certificate was generated and\nissued.\n\n587\n00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:29.340\nAnd that certificated is signed, just like\nthe state of Florida puts their seal on\n\n588\n00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.220\nthere before they laminate my\ndriver's license that says, hey,\n\n589\n00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:35.430\nwe verified all this information,\nwe're gonna seal it up.\n\n590\n00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:39.314\nAnd now when I had it to police officer,\nthey don't have to verify my info,\n\n591\n00:31:39.314 --> 00:31:43.570\nthey see the state of Florida seal, they\nknow they did their job before they issued\n\n592\n00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:47.535\nit so they can trust all the information\non that driver license is accurate.\n\n593\n00:31:47.535 --> 00:31:50.180\nWell, your computers when\nyou use certificates,\n\n594\n00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:53.081\nthose certificates run\nthrough a validation process.\n\n595\n00:31:53.081 --> 00:31:57.689\nPart of that is verifying\nthe the creator of the certificate.\n\n596\n00:31:57.689 --> 00:32:02.259\nMaking sure that the certificate authority\nthat issued the certificate in the first\n\n597\n00:32:02.259 --> 00:32:04.530\nplace is somebody I trust, right?\n\n598\n00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:08.050\nBecause what if Zach set up\nhis own certificate authority?\n\n599\n00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:11.640\nHe could technically issue\nhimself a certificate\n\n600\n00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:12.930\nthat said his name was Bill Gates.\n\n601\n00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:14.380\n&gt;&gt; I have done that several times.\n\n602\n00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:16.330\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And he might try to pawned that\n\n603\n00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:22.090\ncertificate off on some unwary a site or\nuser something like that.\n\n604\n00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:26.490\nBut the problem Zach's gonna have\nis that certificate was sign\n\n605\n00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:30.180\nby his own Private CA, right?\n\n606\n00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:33.500\nAnd nobody else in the world is gonna\ntrust that CA because it's not some\n\n607\n00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:37.040\npublic company that my\ncomputer knows to trust.\n\n608\n00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:41.020\nIt's not my internal CA that my\norganization knows to trust.\n\n609\n00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:44.270\nCertificates are all\nabout a chain of trust.\n\n610\n00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:50.100\nAnd you have to trust the person or the\nentity that's issuing the certificates.\n\n611\n00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:55.350\nJust like that Florida State Trooper\ntrusts the Florida DMV did their job.\n\n612\n00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:58.310\nBut if I take my drivers\nlicense to some other country,\n\n613\n00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:01.940\nare they gonna be as willing to\ntrust the information on there?\n\n614\n00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:03.070\nMaybe not, right?\n\n615\n00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:04.720\nCuz they don't know the State of Florida.\n\n616\n00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.500\nThey don't necessarily\ntrust the State of Florida.\n\n617\n00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:09.700\nAnd that's the same thing will\nhappen with certificates.\n\n618\n00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:11.980\nYou could try to create\na fake certificate.\n\n619\n00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:16.380\nBut if you try to use it anywhere, you're\nprobably not gonna be successful because\n\n620\n00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:21.020\nyou can't fake the signature.\n\n621\n00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:23.348\nYou can't make it look like it came\nfrom a trusted certificate authority.\n\n622\n00:33:23.348 --> 00:33:26.212\n&gt;&gt; I've said awesome about\n25 times in this show.\n\n623\n00:33:26.212 --> 00:33:27.014\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No really,\n\n624\n00:33:27.014 --> 00:33:28.600\nyou're information is so incredible.\n\n625\n00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:29.480\nThank you so much.\n\n626\n00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:30.170\n&gt;&gt; Good, good.\nAll right,\n\n627\n00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:32.170\nwe do have a little bit more\nof try to squeeze in here so\n\n628\n00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:36.300\nwe don't do a part three so pardon me for\ngoing a little bit over our 30 minutes.\n\n629\n00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:38.360\nWe talked about the certificates.\n\n630\n00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:44.920\nA term we need to be familiar with PKI or\npublic key infrastructure.\n\n631\n00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.560\nThis is the certificate server.\n\n632\n00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:51.460\nThese are the ones, this is\nthe infrastructure that we will set up\n\n633\n00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:56.430\nto generate, manage and maintain\ncertificates throughout their lifetime.\n\n634\n00:33:56.430 --> 00:34:00.460\nSo as an organization, if I want to\nissue all my users certificates,\n\n635\n00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:04.475\nthat I can put on smart cards and they can\nuse to log in or get through doorways.\n\n636\n00:34:04.475 --> 00:34:07.780\nOr if I wanted to issue certificates\nto all my computers, so\n\n637\n00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:12.550\nthey can do IPsec between them and\nthose secure file servers.\n\n638\n00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:17.280\nI will set up my own public key\ninfrastructure, where I have certificate\n\n639\n00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:21.770\nauthorities that I can tell\neverybody on my domain to trust, and\n\n640\n00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:24.090\nI can start issuing certificates, right.\n\n641\n00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:26.500\nThere are private CAs,\n\n642\n00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:29.460\npublic infrastructures that I\nmaintain within my organization.\n\n643\n00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:35.760\nThere are also public CAs, places like\nVeriSign, or Thought, or GTE, or EquiFax.\n\n644\n00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:38.820\nThese are companies that I can go and\nbuy certificates from.\n\n645\n00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:40.130\nNow, what's the difference?\n\n646\n00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:43.690\nWell, if I'm only using\nthe certificates internally,\n\n647\n00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:47.870\nwithin my organization, then I can set\nup my own public key infrastructure.\n\n648\n00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:49.138\nI can issue certificates.\n\n649\n00:34:49.138 --> 00:34:53.571\nAnd everybody inside my company can\nbe told, hey, trust CA number two,\n\n650\n00:34:53.571 --> 00:34:55.326\nbecause that's our own CA.\n\n651\n00:34:55.326 --> 00:34:57.660\nAnd you can trust the certificates\nthat it produces.\n\n652\n00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:03.470\nBut outside my organization,\nthey don't know to trust my CA so\n\n653\n00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:07.700\nmy certificates are only going\nto be good internally, right.\n\n654\n00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:11.860\nWe have public CAs though that issues\ncertificates that the public trusts,\n\n655\n00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:14.723\nif you go,\nI don't wanna go too far into this, but.\n\n656\n00:35:14.723 --> 00:35:15.704\n&gt;&gt; Verified by a Verisign.\n\n657\n00:35:15.704 --> 00:35:16.376\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n658\n00:35:16.376 --> 00:35:17.247\n&gt;&gt; I've seen that so many times.\n\n659\n00:35:17.247 --> 00:35:20.771\nExactly right, so when you go to\na public website and it says hey,\n\n660\n00:35:20.771 --> 00:35:23.420\nthis certificate was issued by Verisign.\n\n661\n00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:25.970\nYour computer already knows\nto trust Verisign, right?\n\n662\n00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:29.700\nBecause it's been configured\nthat way out of the box.\n\n663\n00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:34.630\nSo public CAs are useful if I need\nto provide a public resource,\n\n664\n00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:39.570\nwhereas private CAs are used\ninternally to issue certificates.\n\n665\n00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:40.790\nThere's much more to it than that.\n\n666\n00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:44.915\nI'm trying to sum up public key\ninfrastructure in three minutes or less.\n\n667\n00:35:44.915 --> 00:35:46.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that's plenty for\n\n668\n00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.960\nus to pass the MTA exam.\n\n669\n00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.459\nIf you want more information\non public key infrastructure,\n\n670\n00:35:51.459 --> 00:35:53.616\nmake sure you check out our\nWindows Server classes.\n\n671\n00:35:53.616 --> 00:35:57.025\nAnd some of those others where\nwe go into much more depth,\n\n672\n00:35:57.025 --> 00:36:01.147\ntalk about the hierarchy of public\nkey infrastructure, root CAs and\n\n673\n00:36:01.147 --> 00:36:04.648\nsubordinate CAs and\nall of that fun stuff and revocation.\n\n674\n00:36:04.648 --> 00:36:09.325\nThere's a lot more to it but we don't\nneed to know it for this particular exam.\n\n675\n00:36:09.325 --> 00:36:14.145\nLast thing I will talk about is\ngoing to be about token devices,\n\n676\n00:36:14.145 --> 00:36:16.775\nwhich is another one that we\ntalked about a little bit.\n\n677\n00:36:16.775 --> 00:36:20.610\nWhen we talked about authentication\nway back in episodes long ago.\n\n678\n00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:26.670\nA token, a security token is just a device\nthat I can use to authenticate with.\n\n679\n00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:28.370\nThis may be a smart card.\n\n680\n00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:31.210\nIt could be a little USB device.\n\n681\n00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:35.240\nIt might be something that I have to\nplug in in order to authenticate.\n\n682\n00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:38.100\nIt could also be something\nthat generates a code.\n\n683\n00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:41.310\nAnd when I go to authenticate,\nI have to look at the code\n\n684\n00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:45.350\nthat was generated by this device and\npunch that code in as well.\n\n685\n00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:49.230\nSo token devices are physical devices\n\n686\n00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:53.490\nthat we can use when we want to\nimplement multi-factor authentication.\n\n687\n00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:54.900\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic job as usual.\n\n688\n00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:59.370\nAnd like I said, I said awesome like\n150 times in the show Encryption and\n\n689\n00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:01.180\nthis is MTA security fundamentals.\n\n690\n00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:02.500\nThis is encryption part two.\n\n691\n00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:05.700\nThere is a part one, and there's so\nmuch more to be seen in the library,\n\n692\n00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:07.520\nwhich you have access to,\nbecause you're smart.\n\n693\n00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:08.490\nGood for you.\n\n694\n00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:11.590\nThanks so much Mike, and this ITProTV.\n\n695\n00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:15.310\nThanks for watching and\ndo you know an ITPro is always learning.\n\n696\n00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:16.250\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n697\n00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:17.050\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n698\n00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:20.213\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you very soon.\n\n699\n00:37:20.213 --> 00:37:26.292\n[MUSIC]\n\n700\n00:37:26.292 --> 00:37:29.176\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:12.330\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.760\n&gt;&gt; Hello everyone out there in TV Land,\nand welcome to ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.910\nI'm your host Wes Bryan,\nand in today's episode,\n\n6\n00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.660\nwe've got a great show for you in store.\n\n7\n00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.252\nWe are continuing along in our 98-367,\nthat's right,\n\n8\n00:00:23.252 --> 00:00:25.161\nthe MTA Security Fundamentals.\n\n9\n00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:28.080\nJoining us back in the studios is\nnone other than Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.310\nMike, how you doing sir?\n\n11\n00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.540\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.430\nThanks for having me back.\n\n13\n00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.180\nAnd yeah, today we're gonna\nbe talking about malware.\n\n14\n00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.320\nFun stuff, right?\n\n15\n00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.420\nReally for this exam, we need to have\nan understanding of what malware is and\n\n16\n00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.710\nthe different categories of\nmalware that we might face.\n\n17\n00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.340\nWe're not gonna go in depth and\nstart writing any viruses or code or\n\n18\n00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.920\nanything like that, right?\n\n19\n00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.650\nWe just need to make sure that\nsomebody talks about a Trojan horse or\n\n20\n00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.530\na worm we understand\nthe difference because\n\n21\n00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.290\nwe're gonna contain them differently,\nview with them differently.\n\n22\n00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.480\n&gt;&gt; Now I noticed that term malware Mike,\nit's singular, right?\n\n23\n00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.590\nBut there isn't any singularity here.\n\n24\n00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.270\nWe're talking about a lot of\ndifferent attack avenues.\n\n25\n00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.510\nMalware just being more the umbrella term,\nright?\n\n26\n00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.100\n&gt;&gt; It really is, is a great way to put it,\nan umbrella term.\n\n27\n00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.600\nMalware, it actually is a shortened\nversion of malicious software.\n\n28\n00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.500\nSoftware than intends to do harm to you,\nor your data, or your system, right?\n\n29\n00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.984\nSo anything that does bad things to my\nsystem would be considered malware.\n\n30\n00:01:25.984 --> 00:01:28.685\nAs you said, how I like that,\nthat's the umbrella term.\n\n31\n00:01:28.685 --> 00:01:31.029\nWithin that, we can create categories and\n\n32\n00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:34.361\nsometimes these categories\naren't quite black and white.\n\n33\n00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:39.284\nBut they give us a way to discuss\nsecurity and malware with other people in\n\n34\n00:01:39.284 --> 00:01:43.775\na way that we will all understand\nwhat the heck is going on.\n\n35\n00:01:43.775 --> 00:01:47.834\nSo let's start, let's just go down\nthis list, [COUGH] excuse me,\n\n36\n00:01:47.834 --> 00:01:52.410\nis gonna be in no particular order as\nfar as severity or anything like that.\n\n37\n00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.728\nI'm just covering each one that Microsoft\ncalls out on the exam objectives,\n\n38\n00:01:55.728 --> 00:01:57.940\nand we're gonna start with viruses.\n\n39\n00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.630\nViruses is one that I think most of us,\nwe've definitely heard that term.\n\n40\n00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.370\nIf you've watched the news or anything\nlike that, you've heard the term virus.\n\n41\n00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:13.990\nAnd a virus is malware that infects your\nmachine by attaching itself to files.\n\n42\n00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.491\nIt's changed over time,\n\n43\n00:02:15.491 --> 00:02:19.592\nway back in the day we used to have\nwhat they called boot sector viruses.\n\n44\n00:02:19.592 --> 00:02:25.440\nAnd so, you had Cd's and\nbefore that you had floppy discs.\n\n45\n00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.580\nAnd before, in all on those same times,\n\n46\n00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.520\nwe'd do it even to\na mechanical hard drive.\n\n47\n00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.140\nBut, the boot sector was what would,\nwhen you put a floppy disk in,\n\n48\n00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.990\nif some of you might not remember what\nthat is, you'll have to Google that.\n\n49\n00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.450\nBut when you put a floppy disk into\nthe system, it immediately spun it up and\n\n50\n00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.270\nread the first few sectors.\n\n51\n00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.110\nThat was that boot sector, so it knew what\nto do with the data that was on that disk.\n\n52\n00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.640\nIf we put malware in there then\nyou never had a chance, right?\n\n53\n00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.720\nYou put it in and automatically reads and\nboom, you're infected.\n\n54\n00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.333\nNot so much anymore, because we've gotten\nrid a lot of the auto run capabilities.\n\n55\n00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:06.360\nIt might, Windows for example,\npop up and say, what do you wanna do?\n\n56\n00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.260\nOpen this, execute this particular\nprogram, set this thing up for backup,\n\n57\n00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.300\nthings like that.\n\n58\n00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.440\nBut does not necessarily auto\nrun that sector anymore.\n\n59\n00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.108\n&gt;&gt; And you've mentioned in other\nepisodes when we're getting ready,\n\n60\n00:03:18.108 --> 00:03:21.061\ngetting used to our firmware platforms\nlike UEFI brings in secure boot now.\n\n61\n00:03:21.061 --> 00:03:23.149\nSo, I can just log down\nthat whole boot process and\n\n62\n00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:24.654\nkinda give her protected, right?\n\n63\n00:03:24.654 --> 00:03:25.516\n&gt;&gt; Yup, exactly, but\n\n64\n00:03:25.516 --> 00:03:29.650\nthat doesn't mean viruses run away because\nthere are other types of viruses now.\n\n65\n00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.240\nWe saw big virus over the last\nfew years of the macro viruses,\n\n66\n00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.480\nmacros coming from the,\n[COUGH] language we use and\n\n67\n00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.490\nlike our Office applications,\nVBA Visual Basic for Applications.\n\n68\n00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.720\nWe can create things from macros\nwhich are a way to automate steps\n\n69\n00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.710\nwithin those Office applications.\n\n70\n00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.502\nWell, bad guys came up with macro viruses\nwhere you download a spreadsheet.\n\n71\n00:03:53.502 --> 00:03:57.612\nAnd it would have macro or code in there\nthat would execute automatically when\n\n72\n00:03:57.612 --> 00:04:00.820\nyou open up that spreadsheet or\nthat word document.\n\n73\n00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.740\nAnd so,\nthat was malware loaded in there and\n\n74\n00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.980\nit would execute automatically and\ninfect your system or do bad things.\n\n75\n00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.304\nWe still see that today.\n\n76\n00:04:09.304 --> 00:04:14.860\nThis is why we really wanna make sure\nthat we trust who we get our files from.\n\n77\n00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.780\nIf somebody sends you a spreadsheet and\nyou don't know who that is, or weren't\n\n78\n00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.490\nexpecting anything from that person,\nremember, it's easy to fake emails.\n\n79\n00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.640\nI can send you an email that looks\nlike it came from Wes Brian.\n\n80\n00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.890\nAnd you're like I trust Wes, but wait,\nwere you expecting anything from Wes?\n\n81\n00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.310\nHow do I know it's really from Wes?\n\n82\n00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.790\nSo, anyway, that's a topic for\nanother episode.\n\n83\n00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.850\nHere, I wanna focus on what a virus is.\n\n84\n00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:45.080\nAnd a virus, we have macro viruses,\nwe got polymorphic viruses is another one.\n\n85\n00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.222\nThese are amazing.\n\n86\n00:04:46.222 --> 00:04:50.003\nI don't know if you can say\nviruses are amazing, right?\n\n87\n00:04:50.003 --> 00:04:53.428\nBut if we took all the bad stuff away and\nlooked at it just\n\n88\n00:04:53.428 --> 00:04:58.060\nfrom a coding perspective,\nit's impressive what these viruses can do.\n\n89\n00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.610\nThey can actually change themselves.\n\n90\n00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.968\nA lot of our viruses, we stop viruses\nby running anti-virus software,\n\n91\n00:05:04.968 --> 00:05:07.260\nor anti-malware software.\n\n92\n00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.410\nAnd these can be based on\na couple of different things.\n\n93\n00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.630\nThe most popular ones right\nnow are definition based.\n\n94\n00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.790\nYou go out and you download definitions\nto update your antivirus software,\n\n95\n00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.340\nlike Windows Defender\ninside a Windows system.\n\n96\n00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.064\nThose definitions are the anti-virus or\n\n97\n00:05:23.064 --> 00:05:28.220\nanti-malware vendors fighting a virus,\nwriting a definition so that their\n\n98\n00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.660\nengine knows what the virus looks like and\nthen when you download a file it scans it.\n\n99\n00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.060\nAnd if anything in there matches their\ndefinitions, it'll flag it as a virus and\n\n100\n00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.950\nsay hey, don't do this.\n\n101\n00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.250\nWe'll keep it quarantined,\nwe'll keep you safe, right?\n\n102\n00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.330\nPolymorphic viruses can\nchange themselves on the fly.\n\n103\n00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.390\nWhen they move from one file to another,\n\n104\n00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.990\nthey can actually rewrite their own code\nso they no longer match the definitions.\n\n105\n00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.442\nCrazy complex stuff that\nthese guys are doing.\n\n106\n00:05:55.442 --> 00:05:58.640\n&gt;&gt; All right Mike, I'll let you get away\nwith saying okay, yes, they are amazing.\n\n107\n00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.030\nI can be a mini wig commercial saying\nthe geek in me says they are amazing.\n\n108\n00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.524\nThe administrator in me\nsays they are horrible.\n\n109\n00:06:03.524 --> 00:06:04.088\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n110\n00:06:04.088 --> 00:06:06.086\nSo what do we got next\nin the list there Mike,\n\n111\n00:06:06.086 --> 00:06:08.570\nwhen it comes to different\ntypes of malware and stuff.\n\n112\n00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.620\nWe've looked at the polymorphic virus.\n\n113\n00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.748\nWe've talked about a couple\nof different viruses, but\n\n114\n00:06:12.748 --> 00:06:14.567\nthat's not the only thing on the list,\nright?\n\n115\n00:06:14.567 --> 00:06:16.581\n&gt;&gt; There's one thing that\nI forgot about viruses,\n\n116\n00:06:16.581 --> 00:06:19.980\nthat I want to make sure I throw in here,\nand that's how viruses get transmitted.\n\n117\n00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.782\nWe've talked about macro viruses\nbeing in word documents,\n\n118\n00:06:23.782 --> 00:06:26.473\nmost viruses attach themselves to files.\n\n119\n00:06:26.473 --> 00:06:29.053\nAnd what happens is you\ndownload an infected file or\n\n120\n00:06:29.053 --> 00:06:32.950\nyou copy an infected file to your machine,\nand you open that file up.\n\n121\n00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.180\nThat means you're gonna load\nthat file into memory so\n\n122\n00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.780\nyour system can work with it.\n\n123\n00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.360\nWell, the virus was attached to the files.\n\n124\n00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.080\nWhen you open the file and loaded it\nup in your memory on your computer,\n\n125\n00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.805\nit also loads the virus into\nmemory on your computer.\n\n126\n00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:48.275\nAnd what the virus is\nthen gonna do is jump to\n\n127\n00:06:48.275 --> 00:06:52.415\nany other files that you might\nhave open in memory at that time.\n\n128\n00:06:52.415 --> 00:06:56.835\nAnd then you close that other file that's\nnow infected and send it to a coworker or\n\n129\n00:06:56.835 --> 00:07:01.060\nwhat have you, and they open it up and\nthat virus loads up into their memory and\n\n130\n00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.310\nattaches to every single one of\ntheir files that they open or\n\n131\n00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.687\nopen in the near future.\n\n132\n00:07:05.687 --> 00:07:09.203\nAnd then they send those and put it up on\nthe server, and somebody downloads it.\n\n133\n00:07:09.203 --> 00:07:14.045\nAnd so viruses really need our\nhelp to spread is the point\n\n134\n00:07:14.045 --> 00:07:16.320\nI'm trying to make here.\n\n135\n00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.210\nThat'll differentiate from\nthe next topic that we've got.\n\n136\n00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.340\nSo viruses need our help to spread.\n\n137\n00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.436\nThey spread by, typically,\nby attaching to files, and\n\n138\n00:07:24.436 --> 00:07:27.926\nthen we transmit those files around\nfrom one person to the next.\n\n139\n00:07:27.926 --> 00:07:30.799\nAnd then worms would be the next one,\nright.\n\n140\n00:07:30.799 --> 00:07:34.990\nA worm is a self-replicating bit of code.\n\n141\n00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.690\nWorms do not attach themselves to files.\n\n142\n00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:43.900\nThey are standalone and they can replicate\nwithout any help from us, all right.\n\n143\n00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:49.367\nThey are scary fast in the way they\ndo this and how long it takes for\n\n144\n00:07:49.367 --> 00:07:54.746\nthem to propagate across the network or\nreplicate if you will.\n\n145\n00:07:54.746 --> 00:07:57.709\nThey're worse than any\nbunnies we might have.\n\n146\n00:07:57.709 --> 00:08:01.549\nThe, it was a code red if I remember,\nright.\n\n147\n00:08:01.549 --> 00:08:07.783\nIt was within Fifteen minutes or so, and\nit was spread across most of the globe.\n\n148\n00:08:07.783 --> 00:08:13.000\nGo out and look up some of the maps where\nthey share the spread of code word,\n\n149\n00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.140\ncode word, code red worm.\n\n150\n00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.440\nIf I can get that out.\n\n151\n00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:22.770\nSo worms, Malware, spreads on its own,\ndoesn't need our help.\n\n152\n00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:26.451\nOnce it gets on a machine,\nit begins its replication process.\n\n153\n00:08:26.451 --> 00:08:32.490\nAnd it starts replicating itself across\nthe network looking for other victims.\n\n154\n00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:35.283\nAnd so they do a couple of things.\n\n155\n00:08:35.283 --> 00:08:38.840\nOne, they spread and they're infecting\nmachine, after machine, after machine.\n\n156\n00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:43.520\nAnd they generate so much traffic,\nas they're doing this replication process,\n\n157\n00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.190\nthat they can shut networks down.\n\n158\n00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:47.030\nI remember one time Wes,\nI think you were there.\n\n159\n00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:50.226\nWe were working together at\nanother organization, and\n\n160\n00:08:50.226 --> 00:08:51.859\nwe got the SQL Slammer Worm.\n\n161\n00:08:51.859 --> 00:08:56.018\nAnd had one of our instructors\nwas running a lab machine,\n\n162\n00:08:56.018 --> 00:08:59.280\nrunning SQL Server, didn't patch it.\n\n163\n00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.930\nForgot about it,\nexposed it to the Internet, and\n\n164\n00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:05.010\nit picked up Sequel Slammer\nwithin no time flat.\n\n165\n00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:06.670\nAnd very shortly after that,\n\n166\n00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:09.620\nwithin minutes of that happening,\nour network shut down.\n\n167\n00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:12.472\nWe could not connect to anything,\nbecause there was so\n\n168\n00:09:12.472 --> 00:09:16.015\nmuch traffic being generated by this worm,\nas it was replicating.\n\n169\n00:09:16.015 --> 00:09:20.710\nYou start shutting systems down, and then\nbringing them back online one at a time/\n\n170\n00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:25.570\nTrying to find the infected machines\nat this point, and eliminate that worm.\n\n171\n00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:26.830\n&gt;&gt; Now each one of the replicas, Mike,\n\n172\n00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:31.375\ndo they become their own true legitimate\ncopy that's also self-generating,\n\n173\n00:09:31.375 --> 00:09:33.620\nself-sufficient, and\nthen it replicates too?\n\n174\n00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:34.480\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n175\n00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.490\nIt's like,\nsome of you may go back this far with old.\n\n176\n00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:39.160\nShampoo commercial or something.\n\n177\n00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.550\nAnd she told two friends,\nand so on, and so on.\n\n178\n00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:42.890\nAnd they start with one picture.\n\n179\n00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:43.520\nAnd then it's two.\n\n180\n00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.560\nAnd then it's four.\n\n181\n00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.770\nAnd then it's eight.\n\n182\n00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:46.280\nAnd then it's 16.\n\n183\n00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.670\nIt's replicating exponentially, and\n\n184\n00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:51.350\nthat's pretty much what's going\non on your network with a worm.\n\n185\n00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:54.630\nNow another interesting difference\nbetween viruses and worms.\n\n186\n00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:58.480\nViruses are actually a little\nbit harder to get rid of.\n\n187\n00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.151\nBecause they infect files,\n\n188\n00:10:00.151 --> 00:10:04.617\nit's sometimes difficult to determine\nwhat files are actually infected.\n\n189\n00:10:04.617 --> 00:10:07.010\nSo I might think I got rid of everything.\n\n190\n00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:09.755\nOpen up a file that I haven't\ntouched in a long time and\n\n191\n00:10:09.755 --> 00:10:13.304\nit happens to have that virus on it,\nand I reinfect my entire system.\n\n192\n00:10:13.304 --> 00:10:15.890\nSo sometimes,\ngetting rid of viruses can be tricky.\n\n193\n00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:18.590\nWhereas, worms are standalone, and so\n\n194\n00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:22.000\nthey're pretty easy to find and\nget rid of.\n\n195\n00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:27.820\nBut they just replicate so darn fast,\nthat it's a challenge in that respect, but\n\n196\n00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:28.360\neasier to find.\n\n197\n00:10:29.522 --> 00:10:32.700\nAll right, next category we've got,\nis Trojan horses, and\n\n198\n00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.820\nthis brings you back to the old Greek and\nTrojan mythology.\n\n199\n00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:43.696\nI shouldn't say mythology, it was part of\nour history, but the Trojan horse, right?\n\n200\n00:10:43.696 --> 00:10:46.200\nThey called it that, for a reason.\n\n201\n00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.600\nThe Trojan horse is a piece of software\nthat masquerades as something we want,\n\n202\n00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.050\nlike a big statue of a horse.\n\n203\n00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:55.970\nWho wouldn't want a big statue\nof a horse in their city?\n\n204\n00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:57.508\nSo, of course we're going\nto take that software.\n\n205\n00:10:57.508 --> 00:11:00.070\nWe're going to pull that\nhorse into our castle.\n\n206\n00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:02.880\nAnd then in the middle of the night,\nthe belly opens up, and\n\n207\n00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.120\nall the soldiers fall out and\nkill everybody in their sleep.\n\n208\n00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.344\nSame thing here.\nThat software,\n\n209\n00:11:08.344 --> 00:11:12.020\nthat we thought was something we wanted,\nall of a sudden we execute it.\n\n210\n00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:15.630\nAnd it might do what we wanted, but in the\nbackground it's also doing something else,\n\n211\n00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:18.220\nsomething that we definitely did not want.\n\n212\n00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:24.356\nAnd that is a Trojan Horse, it's more of\na delivery mechanism than actual malware.\n\n213\n00:11:24.356 --> 00:11:27.860\nUsually, the payload is\nthe malicious software, right?\n\n214\n00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:32.490\nThe Trojan horse is really just\na wrapper to conceal that,\n\n215\n00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:34.231\nto make you wanna download it, right?\n\n216\n00:11:34.231 --> 00:11:35.708\nI'm gonna send you a link.\n\n217\n00:11:35.708 --> 00:11:38.092\nAnd it's gonna say, hey, here's\na free game of Tetris you might like.\n\n218\n00:11:38.092 --> 00:11:40.640\nYou're gonna click on it, and\nit's going to install Tetris.\n\n219\n00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.860\nI mean,\nwho doesn't like a good game of Tetris?\n\n220\n00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:47.200\nBut in the background,\nit's gonna be installing some back doors.\n\n221\n00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.680\nThat is typically what these things do.\n\n222\n00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.980\nOr infecting your machine with\nsomething else, and you might or\n\n223\n00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.490\nmight not even notice it at the time.\n\n224\n00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:56.300\nIt might be a little flash in\nthe corner of the system tray,\n\n225\n00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:59.160\nor a Command Prompt window that opens and\ncloses real quick.\n\n226\n00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.130\nAnd hopefully, your so busy playing\nTetris, you don't even notice.\n\n227\n00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:06.280\n&gt;&gt; MIke, would you say that this falls\nalong the lines of for instance.\n\n228\n00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.670\nVirus is one of the big things that\nwe had with the viruses is the fact,\n\n229\n00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.435\nthat you don't open attachments.\n\n230\n00:12:11.435 --> 00:12:14.640\nYou don't open these E-mails that are\ncoming from people that you don't know.\n\n231\n00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:18.770\nCuz, they could look benign,\nbut when it comes down to it,\n\n232\n00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:22.500\nthat little glitter graphic that's in\nthat E-card that you received, from\n\n233\n00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.833\nwhat you thought was a friend, actually\nis masquerading with a Trojan involved.\n\n234\n00:12:25.833 --> 00:12:29.402\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, if it's too good\nto be true, it's probably true, right?\n\n235\n00:12:29.402 --> 00:12:32.591\nYou're not getting a free copy of Windows,\nor a free copy of, I mean,\n\n236\n00:12:32.591 --> 00:12:34.835\nI'm not saying that you can't.\n\n237\n00:12:34.835 --> 00:12:37.985\nBut, hopefully you get the idea,\nall right?\n\n238\n00:12:37.985 --> 00:12:43.705\nOne of the places I see a lot of this\noccurring is those free software sites,\n\n239\n00:12:43.705 --> 00:12:46.250\nthose free driver sites, right?\n\n240\n00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:50.788\nBecause people are going out and\nthey're like, I need a new driver for\n\n241\n00:12:50.788 --> 00:12:51.734\nmy video card.\n\n242\n00:12:51.734 --> 00:12:55.000\nAnd so, they'll just Google\ntheir video card driver.\n\n243\n00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.380\nAnd they'll take the first\none in the list or\n\n244\n00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:01.740\nwhichever one they click on, with no\nthought about who that actually is.\n\n245\n00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:05.006\nAnd if I'm a bad guy,\nit's a great way to infect machines.\n\n246\n00:13:05.006 --> 00:13:08.490\nI'm gonna open up a site, I'm gonna host,\nand I'll let you download the drivers,\n\n247\n00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:09.420\nabsolutely.\n\n248\n00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:10.990\nTake all the drivers you want.\n\n249\n00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:16.500\nEach one of them is loaded up as a Trojan\nwith some malware inside it, right?\n\n250\n00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:23.060\nSo just be careful, you've got to,\nwhat's a good way to say it.\n\n251\n00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:26.180\nYou just wanna make sure that\nyou trust who you're getting,\n\n252\n00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.970\nwhen you're downloading software,\nwhen you're downloading updates.\n\n253\n00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:31.010\nWhen you're downloading\nanything like that,\n\n254\n00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:35.010\nmake sure you trust the source\nof that information.\n\n255\n00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:36.752\nSpyware is next on our list.\n\n256\n00:13:36.752 --> 00:13:41.080\nAnd spywares is probably, well I\nshouldn't say it's the least harmful.\n\n257\n00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:46.140\nBut it is typically not doing\nanything active against you,\n\n258\n00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:47.730\nlike not harming your computer.\n\n259\n00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:50.330\nBut what it is doing is still very bad,\nand\n\n260\n00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.430\nthat is it's stealing your information.\n\n261\n00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:53.570\nHence the name spyware.\n\n262\n00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:55.170\nThey're gonna spy on you.\n\n263\n00:13:55.170 --> 00:14:00.809\nThis can be things like keystroke loggers,\nany number of things they can install.\n\n264\n00:14:00.809 --> 00:14:05.495\nThings into your browser that monitor\nyour browsing history, your habits,\n\n265\n00:14:05.495 --> 00:14:08.070\nwhat pages your clicking on.\n\n266\n00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:12.830\nLike I say, key stroke loggers that log\nevery key that you type, so they can try\n\n267\n00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:17.000\nto capture usernames and passwords, as\nyou enter that information in the fields.\n\n268\n00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.374\nOr credit card numbers,\nas you're shopping online.\n\n269\n00:14:20.374 --> 00:14:24.220\nThose keystroke loggers, that spyware,\ncan try to capture that information.\n\n270\n00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:28.225\nAnd it can either send it back home to\nthe bad guy, kinda like the old E.T.\n\n271\n00:14:28.225 --> 00:14:29.523\nphone home type thing.\n\n272\n00:14:29.523 --> 00:14:32.797\nOr it might be something that the bad\nguys has to come back to your computer\n\n273\n00:14:32.797 --> 00:14:35.275\nto acquire that file,\nwhere it's all been recorded.\n\n274\n00:14:35.275 --> 00:14:38.205\nIt could even be a hardware\ndevice honestly.\n\n275\n00:14:38.205 --> 00:14:39.825\nBut here we're talking about malware.\n\n276\n00:14:39.825 --> 00:14:43.075\nWe're typically talking\nabout software type malware.\n\n277\n00:14:43.075 --> 00:14:46.274\nBut spyware is malware that spies on you.\n\n278\n00:14:46.274 --> 00:14:52.060\nThat tries to capture to steal\nyour information, all right?\n\n279\n00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:57.850\nRansomware, this is one that's been in\nthe news way too many times lately.\n\n280\n00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:59.630\nAnd it's going to continue,\n\n281\n00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:04.550\nbecause the bad guys have really figured\nout a good way to monetize their efforts.\n\n282\n00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:08.600\nA way that they can get paid,\nrather than hack a server and go I'm cool.\n\n283\n00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.750\nNow, they can make money with it, right?\n\n284\n00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:13.890\nSo ransomware is not\ngoing away anytime soon.\n\n285\n00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:14.640\nWhat the heck is it?\n\n286\n00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:21.085\nRansomware is malware that gets on your\nsystem, and it encrypts your files.\n\n287\n00:15:21.085 --> 00:15:26.065\nAnd it then prompts you and says, hey,\nif you want your information back,\n\n288\n00:15:26.065 --> 00:15:29.558\nyou need to pay this much\nmoney to this bank account.\n\n289\n00:15:29.558 --> 00:15:34.469\nOr some kind of electronic currency\nlike BitCoin or Zcash, or a money order,\n\n290\n00:15:34.469 --> 00:15:38.140\nor something like that,\nin order to get your files back.\n\n291\n00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:42.401\nThe idea is, if your system gets\ninfected with mal with this ransom ware,\n\n292\n00:15:42.401 --> 00:15:47.367\nall your files get encrypted, you can't\naccess anything, until you pay the money.\n\n293\n00:15:47.367 --> 00:15:51.078\nYou pay the bad guy the money,\nand they'll give you the key.\n\n294\n00:15:51.078 --> 00:15:54.890\nWhat's necessary, the electronic key,\nto decrypt your information,\n\n295\n00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:57.172\nand get your information back, all right?\n\n296\n00:15:57.172 --> 00:15:59.789\nThat's what ransomware is all about.\n\n297\n00:15:59.789 --> 00:16:04.114\nWe saw just, at the time of this shooting,\n\n298\n00:16:04.114 --> 00:16:09.930\nWannaCry had just infected\nlots of systems globally.\n\n299\n00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:13.580\nA big, big one that just came out.\n\n300\n00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.180\nAnd that's bad, obviously that's bad, and\n\n301\n00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:19.960\nthe sad thing about ransomware is\na lot of people end up paying it.\n\n302\n00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.720\nBecause they need that information back.\n\n303\n00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:25.200\nIf you're a law office and\nyou've got cases pending and\n\n304\n00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.290\nthey've encrypted all your files,\nyou need that information back.\n\n305\n00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:31.260\nAnd if you don't have a good back up,\na current back up,\n\n306\n00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:32.870\nthe last back up was two days ago.\n\n307\n00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:36.220\nIf you don't pay it,\nyou're going to restore from back up and\n\n308\n00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.240\nyou're going to have\ninformation two days old.\n\n309\n00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.510\nYou have just lost 48 hours of work and\ninformation that,\n\n310\n00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:42.620\nthat might not be replaceable.\n\n311\n00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.880\nSo some companies do end up trying to pay.\n\n312\n00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.310\nThe downside of that is, one,\nit makes the bad guy realize, hey,\n\n313\n00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:51.660\nI can make money doing this.\n\n314\n00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:54.200\nTwo, there's no guarantee\nthey give you the key, right.\n\n315\n00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.940\nYou might pay them and they go,\nyeah, thanks for that, sorry,\n\n316\n00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.560\nit's gonna be double that now.\n\n317\n00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:03.240\nGo ahead and pay me again and\nI'll think about giving you the key.\n\n318\n00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.430\nIt's just a scary situation to be in.\n\n319\n00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:11.320\nSo again for this class, I wanna make sure\nwe just understand what ransomware is and\n\n320\n00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:13.800\nthat is malware that gets on a system.\n\n321\n00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:19.780\nAnd it will encrypt the files and\nyour data and then hold that data ransom.\n\n322\n00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:22.790\nFor usually, some type of monetary payoff.\n\n323\n00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:25.690\nThat might be your system at\nhome that you get that on.\n\n324\n00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:28.740\nIf it gets into a work network,\nit might hit your file servers,\n\n325\n00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.500\nyour database servers.\n\n326\n00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:34.110\nIt can spread from one machine to another,\njust like other malware.\n\n327\n00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:35.000\nAnd in fact,\n\n328\n00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.820\nthose machines then start encrypting\nother hard drives on the system.\n\n329\n00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:41.319\nSo that is what ransomeware is all about.\n\n330\n00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.940\nAdware, adware are those\nannoying pop ups that we get.\n\n331\n00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:51.605\nIt's another type of malware.\n\n332\n00:17:51.605 --> 00:17:52.467\nSpyware relativity benign.\n\n333\n00:17:52.467 --> 00:17:55.236\nI shouldn't say that though because\nspyware can steal your credit\n\n334\n00:17:55.236 --> 00:17:59.580\ncard information, your passwords,\nwhich can be a horrible, horrible thing.\n\n335\n00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.730\nAdware though, is rather benign.\n\n336\n00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:04.570\nIt does just pop up\nadvertisements on your system.\n\n337\n00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:07.210\nBut it can get to the point where\nyou can't be productive anymore.\n\n338\n00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:08.420\nYou can't use your system for\n\n339\n00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:13.000\nwhat you want, because every time you open\nup your browser, pop-ups are going crazy.\n\n340\n00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:16.630\nMakes it very difficult to work.\n\n341\n00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.710\nSo that's what adware is all about.\n\n342\n00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:22.465\nThen we've got rootkits.\n\n343\n00:18:22.465 --> 00:18:26.540\nRootkits are a nasty breed of malware\n\n344\n00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:31.190\nthat try to infect your system and take\nadministrative control of your system.\n\n345\n00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:35.900\nAnd it does this by getting in between\nwhat's known as the kernel mode and\n\n346\n00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:36.690\nthe user mode.\n\n347\n00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:42.030\nWithout getting too deep into that and\nour actual architecture of our systems.\n\n348\n00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:46.560\nYou've got your operating system,\nwhat is called your kernel.\n\n349\n00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:47.590\nAnd your user,\n\n350\n00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:52.580\nhow you interact with that, there's\na layer between that kinda gets filtered.\n\n351\n00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:57.272\nSo that you're only sending correct\ninstructions to your processor for work.\n\n352\n00:18:57.272 --> 00:19:02.830\nThe rootkit gets in between there and\nnow it has direct access to the kernel.\n\n353\n00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:07.450\nIt can pretty much do whatever it wants,\nincluding hiding stuff from the user.\n\n354\n00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:11.050\nBecause it's in between the user mode and\nthat kernel mode.\n\n355\n00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:13.790\nSo I might run, I might think wow,\nmy system is running really slow,\n\n356\n00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:17.540\nlet me pull up task manager and\nsee what's running in the background.\n\n357\n00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:22.960\nAnd that rootkit won't show up on there,\nbecause it sees me calling task manager\n\n358\n00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.660\nand the results that are coming back\nwhen that window opens up on my screen.\n\n359\n00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:30.010\nThe root could say yeah remove this\nbefore you show it to him right?\n\n360\n00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:32.630\nSo it completely hides\nitself from the end user,\n\n361\n00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:36.180\nextremely difficult to get\nrid of root kits like that.\n\n362\n00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.790\nTypically it's a format the machine and\n\n363\n00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:44.130\nlet's start all over with a known\ngood clean backup or reinstallation.\n\n364\n00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:47.410\nRootkits are nasty, back doors.\n\n365\n00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:49.750\nI mentioned that when I\ntalked about trojans.\n\n366\n00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:52.780\nBackdoors are remote access.\n\n367\n00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:57.650\nThey are a way that I can get back into\na system, through the backdoor, right?\n\n368\n00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:58.600\nThink about what we've,\n\n369\n00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.830\nwhen we think about back door, most\nplaces have a front door, a main entry.\n\n370\n00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:07.510\nA backdoor is some side entrance, one that\nnot everybody uses, or even knows about.\n\n371\n00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:11.210\nWell that's what they're trying to do\nwith this type of malware is set up\n\n372\n00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:12.320\na back door.\n\n373\n00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.670\nA way they can bypass\nyour normal security and\n\n374\n00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:17.230\nget into your system any time they want.\n\n375\n00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:20.350\nSo that trojan horse,\nthat delivery mechanism,\n\n376\n00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:26.090\na lot of times is a back door kit that\ngets installed and then it calls home.\n\n377\n00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:27.490\nAnd it says hey,\ndo you wanna connect to me?\n\n378\n00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:32.320\nIt's calling the bad guy, and saying hey,\nhere's your connection, bypassing, log on,\n\n379\n00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:35.600\nany other type of security that\nwe have in place on that system.\n\n380\n00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.610\nSo that's what a back door is all about.\n\n381\n00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:42.910\nAnd then we've got buffer overflows,\nanother category of malware.\n\n382\n00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:47.440\nA buffer overflow is something that\napplications, operating systems,\n\n383\n00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:52.990\ncan all be vulnerable to applications\nwhen they run, they're assigned a certain\n\n384\n00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:56.680\namount of memory and they can use that\nmemory like a scratch pad to perform\n\n385\n00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:01.870\ncalculations, to store data that the users\ninputting maybe, things like that.\n\n386\n00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:04.940\nBut they're assigned\na certain amount of memory.\n\n387\n00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:08.840\nA buffer overflow is when\nwe get the application to\n\n388\n00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.100\nsend more data then will fit.\n\n389\n00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:14.380\nIn that buffer, that amount of\nmemory they've been assigned.\n\n390\n00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:18.900\nAnd if we can do that, if the application\nallows us to trick it into sending more\n\n391\n00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:23.090\ndata than the buffer can hold,\nthe buffer overflows, right?\n\n392\n00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:24.360\nThink of it like a cup of water.\n\n393\n00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.220\nYou start your faucet,\nyou're filling that cup up.\n\n394\n00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.360\nAs it gets to the top,\nnormally we stop it.\n\n395\n00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.430\nThe application should be doing that.\n\n396\n00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:34.470\nBut if there's Issues\nwith the application.\n\n397\n00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:36.370\nIf they're not doing the proper checks.\n\n398\n00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:38.160\nIt might not turn the faucet off.\n\n399\n00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.160\nIn which case, my cup overflows.\n\n400\n00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:46.260\nNot once when an application runs\ninto a buffer overflow scenario.\n\n401\n00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:49.250\nIt's actually over,\nit's overflowed it's buffer.\n\n402\n00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:51.080\nA few different things can happen.\n\n403\n00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.500\nIt could end up crashing the application.\n\n404\n00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.960\nSometimes when the buffer\noverflows it writes over itself\n\n405\n00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.120\nbecause it runs out of room.\n\n406\n00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:01.310\nIt's like taking apiece of paper\nwriting from top to bottom,\n\n407\n00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:03.940\nrealizing you got more to say and\njust start writing at the top and\n\n408\n00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:06.250\nwriting over what you've written before.\n\n409\n00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:08.710\nThen I would say,\nI can't read that gobbledygook and\n\n410\n00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:11.680\nthat's the same thing that can happen\nto an application and it crashes.\n\n411\n00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:15.200\nNow, the operating system itself, the\ncomputer you're running the application on\n\n412\n00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:19.750\ncan crash as that buffer overflows,\nit could overwrite other areas of memory\n\n413\n00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:22.670\nthat are important to my operating\nsystem to continue functioning.\n\n414\n00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:25.600\nSo if it overwrites that,\nit can cause my whole system to crash.\n\n415\n00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:32.030\nOr it could overwrite, it could over\nflow into an unused portion of memory.\n\n416\n00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:35.450\nAnd if the bad guys can\nfigure out where that went,\n\n417\n00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:37.600\nthey could attempt to\nget that code executed.\n\n418\n00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:41.590\nAnd now they can run, say,\na command prompt window or\n\n419\n00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:44.670\na PowerShell window with\nadministrative access or\n\n420\n00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:48.810\nexecute some other type of malware\nto further infect your system.\n\n421\n00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:51.350\nThey can try to take over your system.\n\n422\n00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:56.530\nSo buffer overflows are when\nan application or some program has\n\n423\n00:22:56.530 --> 00:23:01.250\nIs allowing more data to be written to\nthe buffer than the buffer can hold.\n\n424\n00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:05.750\nAnd then we have a few different outcomes\nthat can occur on that buffer overflow.\n\n425\n00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:08.580\n&gt;&gt; Mike I mean no problem with that\nthere's a lot of information and\n\n426\n00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.580\nas you can see it's a very\nscary world out there.\n\n427\n00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:13.740\nBut what we do like you said there's\none more that we have to talk about and\n\n428\n00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.090\nthis is one that always confused me.\n\n429\n00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:17.710\nAnd that's the zero day attack,\ncan you help me out with that one?\n\n430\n00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:18.850\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question Wes.\n\n431\n00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:20.220\nLet's talk about a zero day attack.\n\n432\n00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:21.850\nAnd really to understand\na zero day attack.\n\n433\n00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:25.760\nLet's talk about the way\nwe work with malware.\n\n434\n00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:29.470\nRight, when we're talking\nabout the antivirus vendors.\n\n435\n00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:31.360\nMicrosoft Cisco, the big boys out there.\n\n436\n00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.170\nA lot of private companies.\n\n437\n00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:37.100\nThey will try to find\nvulnerabilities in software,\n\n438\n00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:40.460\nlike buffer overflow vulnerabilities and\nthe like.\n\n439\n00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:44.140\nAnd when they discover vulnerabilities,\nthey report them.\n\n440\n00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:46.880\nLets see they find a vulnerability\nin a Microsoft product,\n\n441\n00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:51.550\nthey'll talk to Microsoft, they'll\nwrite a patch, some sort of security\n\n442\n00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:56.880\nupdate that we can get from the Microsoft\nwebsite and we can apply to our systems.\n\n443\n00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:01.350\nAnd we're now safe from that\nparticular threat or vulnerability.\n\n444\n00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:05.400\nA zero day attack is when\nyou get some type of malware\n\n445\n00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.760\nthat hasn't been discovered yet,\nhasn't been seen before.\n\n446\n00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.790\nAlright, you're one of the lucky few\nthat is getting the first experience of\n\n447\n00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:16.740\nthis particular piece of malware\ndoesn't sound all that good does it.\n\n448\n00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:17.550\nIt's not.\n\n449\n00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:22.390\nBut that's what zero day attack are all\nabout, and we're really always going to be\n\n450\n00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:26.780\nvulnerable to zero day attacks\nbecause we didn't know about them yet.\n\n451\n00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:31.410\nWe hope we find vulnerabilities and patch\nthem before we ever get exposed to them,\n\n452\n00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:36.630\nbut somebody kinda has to get exposed to\nit before we go, wow, that's a bad thing.\n\n453\n00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:39.290\nLet's patch it up,\nlet's write some kind of definition so\n\n454\n00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:42.260\nwe can catch that before\nit affects other machines.\n\n455\n00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:45.330\nSomebody has to be the unfortunate\none to find it first and\n\n456\n00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:46.950\nthat's what zero day\nattacks are all about.\n\n457\n00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:50.990\nAnd there are some things we can do,\nit might seem like, well What can we do?\n\n458\n00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:52.210\nIf it hasn't been discovered yet.\n\n459\n00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:53.040\nThere's no updates.\n\n460\n00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.040\nThere's no patches.\n\n461\n00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.620\nThere's no definitions.\n\n462\n00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:58.130\nHow do I protect myself\nagainst zero data attacks?\n\n463\n00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:00.150\nAnd the answer is just following.\n\n464\n00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:02.420\nKeeping our network secure as possible.\n\n465\n00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:06.850\nApplying all possible patches, hardening\nour servers, reducing our attack surface.\n\n466\n00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:09.600\nNot clicking on silly links and emails.\n\n467\n00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.700\nJust good, safe network and\n\n468\n00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:17.620\ncomputer practices will hopefully\nprotect us from a lot of those types.\n\n469\n00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:19.810\nBut again, zero day attacks\nare just attacks that occur.\n\n470\n00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:24.430\nIt's when we run into a piece of\nmalware that hasn't been seen before.\n\n471\n00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:26.760\n&gt;&gt; Mike, that's a lot of great\ninformation when it comes to malware.\n\n472\n00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.770\nAnd as you can see, it's kinda scary out.\n\n473\n00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:31.480\nBut remember,\nfirst line of defense is awareness.\n\n474\n00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.930\nYou can't defend yourself against\nthings you aren't aware of.\n\n475\n00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:36.050\nSo that's what we were talking\nabout on this episode,\n\n476\n00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:38.470\njust the awareness of malware and\nthe different classifications.\n\n477\n00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:41.240\nMike, looking at that clock though,\nI don't we have any time left.\n\n478\n00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.190\nBut before we sign out,\n\n479\n00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:44.950\ndo you have any additional words maybe\nyou'd like to impart to the viewers?\n\n480\n00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:47.720\n&gt;&gt; Now the main thing is to make sure\nthat you're familiar with different\n\n481\n00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.700\ncategories of malware and\nhow they get spread.\n\n482\n00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:52.025\n&gt;&gt; Alright.\nWords of wisdom from\n\n483\n00:25:52.025 --> 00:25:56.540\nMike; Remember put your tin foil hats on;\njust kidding, but until we see you again.\n\n484\n00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:59.530\nSigning out for ITPROTV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n485\n00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:00.480\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n486\n00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.915\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n487\n00:26:01.915 --> 00:26:09.116\n[MUSIC]\n\n488\n00:26:09.116 --> 00:26:11.786\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:13.539\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV\n&gt;&gt; Hello everyone out there,\n\n4\n00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:14.694\nwelcome to ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.694 --> 00:00:17.697\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan,\nand in today's episode,\n\n6\n00:00:17.697 --> 00:00:21.499\nwe are continuing through our series\nin MTA security fundamentals.\n\n7\n00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:24.860\nAnd joining us back in the studios\nis none other than Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.830\nMike, how you doing, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.100\n&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm doing fantastic,\nWes, thanks for having me back.\n\n10\n00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.150\nAnd yeah, today we get to talk\nall about firewalls, right?\n\n11\n00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.920\nAnd firewalls are a very\nimportant part of our security.\n\n12\n00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.740\nThey really are kind of\nthat front line of defense,\n\n13\n00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.620\nwhen it comes to network security.\n\n14\n00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.988\nSo it's important that we understand what\na firewall is, what our options are,\n\n15\n00:00:45.988 --> 00:00:48.701\nwhen we talk about different\ntypes of firewalls.\n\n16\n00:00:48.701 --> 00:00:52.809\nThey can have different purposes, they can\nalso be hardware-based or software-based.\n\n17\n00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.585\nAnd we need to know if there's pros and\ncons to each one of those, and\n\n18\n00:00:56.585 --> 00:00:59.260\nwhy we might use one over the other.\n\n19\n00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.261\nSo let's start out just by\ntalking about different\n\n20\n00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:04.575\ntypes of hardware-based firewalls.\n\n21\n00:01:04.575 --> 00:01:08.375\nSo I almost think, maybe we should\ntake this a little bit out of order.\n\n22\n00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:11.018\nOr briefly, let's jump down for\na second and come back,\n\n23\n00:01:11.018 --> 00:01:13.460\nin my list of objectives\nfrom Microsoft here.\n\n24\n00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.030\nBecause we started out by saying,\n\n25\n00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.860\nlet's talk about the different\ntypes of hardware-based firewalls.\n\n26\n00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.900\nI was like, wait, we haven't defined\nhardware or software-based firewalls.\n\n27\n00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.150\nAlthough, I'm sure all of our good\nfolks out there in ITProTV Land\n\n28\n00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.050\ncould already tell us\nwhat the difference is.\n\n29\n00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.390\nBut let's make sure we're\nall on the same page.\n\n30\n00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.055\nHardware firewall is a set of\nhardware dedicated to that purpose.\n\n31\n00:01:36.055 --> 00:01:39.850\nIts goal in life, or\nits job in life, is to be a firewall.\n\n32\n00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.930\nSo it has the hardware, the processor,\n\n33\n00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.760\nthe memory, everything is one\nlittle box that is your firewall.\n\n34\n00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.595\nAnd that's all it does,\nis that firewall job.\n\n35\n00:01:49.595 --> 00:01:53.947\nA software-based firewall is\nan application that we can install on\n\n36\n00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:54.795\na computer.\n\n37\n00:01:54.795 --> 00:01:58.640\nMaybe a Windows 10 machine,\na Server 2016 machine.\n\n38\n00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.952\nOr whatever the case may be,\nother operating systems, as well.\n\n39\n00:02:01.952 --> 00:02:06.880\nBut it's an application that\nruns on an operating system.\n\n40\n00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.180\nThat would be a software-based firewall.\n\n41\n00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.850\nAll right, so\nnow that we've got that out of the way,\n\n42\n00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.720\nlet's talk about these different\ntypes of hardware-based firewalls.\n\n43\n00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.027\nI want to talk about packet filtering,\ncircuit-level filtering firewalls.\n\n44\n00:02:19.027 --> 00:02:24.420\nApplication-level firewalls,\nas well as stateful multi-level firewalls.\n\n45\n00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.370\nWe'll start off with the original, and\nthat is the packet-filtering firewall.\n\n46\n00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.100\nThis is what we all a gen-one firewall.\n\n47\n00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.230\nAnd let's also define\nwhat a firewall does.\n\n48\n00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.960\nWe don't wanna go too\nfar before we get there,\n\n49\n00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.800\nbecause some of you might\nbe newer to this concept.\n\n50\n00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.240\nA firewall is a device that we put\nin our network, typically in-line,\n\n51\n00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.680\nlike I said, at the perimeter of our\nnetwork, could also be on a host.\n\n52\n00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.890\nBut a firewall's job is to help\ncontrol the traffic, the packets,\n\n53\n00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.970\nthat are coming in and out of either\na network or a particular host, all right?\n\n54\n00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.938\nWhen we look at our networking basics,\nright?\n\n55\n00:03:03.938 --> 00:03:08.309\nWe learn that every device that can\ncommunicate on a network has a unique IP\n\n56\n00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:10.081\naddress associated with it.\n\n57\n00:03:10.081 --> 00:03:14.098\nAnd that's how I can address a packet\nthat's destined for that device.\n\n58\n00:03:14.098 --> 00:03:17.520\nBut we also learned about\nsomething known as port numbers.\n\n59\n00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.246\nMaybe, because let's say my laptop here,\nit has a unique IP address.\n\n60\n00:03:21.246 --> 00:03:25.175\nSo that people can send data, or can\nattach or connect to it, what have you.\n\n61\n00:03:25.175 --> 00:03:28.170\nBut I can run multiple\napplications on this device.\n\n62\n00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.840\nI might have my web browser open,\nas well as an FTP client,\n\n63\n00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.800\nas well as a remote desktop session going\nto one of the servers in my closet.\n\n64\n00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.170\nSo I've got all this traffic coming back,\nsome of it's VPN traffic or\n\n65\n00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.750\nremote desktop traffic.\n\n66\n00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.190\nSome of it's traffic from my browser, some\nof it's traffic for, what else did I say?\n\n67\n00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.660\nFTP traffic coming back in.\n\n68\n00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.818\nHow does my system know what\napplication to send that data to?\n\n69\n00:03:50.818 --> 00:03:52.629\nBecause it comes across\na specific port number.\n\n70\n00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.147\nLike 80, typically, for\nweb traffic, 20 or 21 for FTP,\n\n71\n00:03:57.147 --> 00:04:02.010\n3389 for remote desktop in\na Windows environment, by default.\n\n72\n00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.192\nSo we have 65,535 or 6?\n\n73\n00:04:06.192 --> 00:04:06.908\n&gt;&gt; 35.\n\n74\n00:04:06.908 --> 00:04:10.577\n&gt;&gt; 35 ports associated\nwith that IP address.\n\n75\n00:04:10.577 --> 00:04:14.490\nAnd you can think of each one of those\nports as a doorway in to your system.\n\n76\n00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.720\nI can establish a connection on\nthose different port numbers.\n\n77\n00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.130\nSo what a firewall does is basically say,\nwe're gonna stop everything, block it all.\n\n78\n00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.603\nAnd then I can pick and choose what\nports I wanna allow traffic to come in.\n\n79\n00:04:27.603 --> 00:04:32.215\nSo it gives me that ability to\ncontrol that traffic flow, all right.\n\n80\n00:04:32.215 --> 00:04:37.492\nNow technically, I guess a firewall could\nbe open, where it allows everything.\n\n81\n00:04:37.492 --> 00:04:41.630\nAnd we have to create rules\nthat tell it what to not allow.\n\n82\n00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.390\nMost firewalls nowadays, however,\nin fact, every one I've ever dealt with,\n\n83\n00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.450\nworks on what's known as an implicit deny.\n\n84\n00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.620\nMeaning I'm gonna block everything, and\nyou've gotta tell me what to allow, right.\n\n85\n00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.930\nSo we create rules within these firewalls\nthat say, yes, this traffic is allowed.\n\n86\n00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.595\nNo, don't allow anything that's coming\nthrough that port to be allowed into\n\n87\n00:05:01.595 --> 00:05:02.449\nthe network.\n\n88\n00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.784\nNow packet-filtering firewalls,\nthese are our original firewalls.\n\n89\n00:05:06.784 --> 00:05:12.769\nAnd they are capable of looking at\nthe header information in packets,\n\n90\n00:05:12.769 --> 00:05:16.170\nas they come across the wire.\n\n91\n00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:21.710\nNow in the packet, we can find things\nlike source and destination IP address.\n\n92\n00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.810\nWhere the packet's coming from,\nwhat its destination is.\n\n93\n00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.488\nWe can see source and\ndestination port information.\n\n94\n00:05:27.488 --> 00:05:30.554\nWhat port the computer that was\nsending the packet used to send it,\n\n95\n00:05:30.554 --> 00:05:32.105\nand what port it is destined for?\n\n96\n00:05:32.105 --> 00:05:35.210\nPort 80 on my web server, maybe.\n\n97\n00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.790\nWe can also look at the type of packet,\nis it TCP,\n\n98\n00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.210\nis it UDP, is it FTP, and what can\nof traffic is coming across there?\n\n99\n00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.350\nBut that's about all a packet-filtering\nfirewall can look at,\n\n100\n00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.470\nis that header information\non those packets.\n\n101\n00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.197\nIt can also look at interface IDs,\nwhen we look at routers.\n\n102\n00:05:56.197 --> 00:06:00.268\nBut it doesn't look at the content of\nthe packets, like the actual payload,\n\n103\n00:06:00.268 --> 00:06:02.845\nthe data,\nthe webpage that you've requested.\n\n104\n00:06:02.845 --> 00:06:05.446\nOr the piece of software\nthat you're downloading, or\n\n105\n00:06:05.446 --> 00:06:07.489\nthe email that somebody is sending to you.\n\n106\n00:06:07.489 --> 00:06:10.001\nDoesn't look at any of that,\njust the source and\n\n107\n00:06:10.001 --> 00:06:12.956\ndestination IP, source and\ndestination port numbers.\n\n108\n00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:15.016\nInterface IDs, type of package, or\n\n109\n00:06:15.016 --> 00:06:18.480\nbasically protocol that we're\nsending those packets with.\n\n110\n00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.310\nSo that's a very basic firewall.\n\n111\n00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.500\nDid a great job,\nit does what it's supposed to do.\n\n112\n00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.935\nBut that, again,\nis what we'll call a gen-one firewall.\n\n113\n00:06:28.935 --> 00:06:32.460\n&gt;&gt; And the reason we might need the next\ngeneration, Mike, if I understand right?\n\n114\n00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.260\nIs because attacks have got\nmuch more sophisticated.\n\n115\n00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.520\nIt's not just your basic\nblack-and-white type of attack,\n\n116\n00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.050\nwhere it's just an IP address,\nor just a port.\n\n117\n00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:42.448\nThey're getting a lot more sophisticated.\n\n118\n00:06:42.448 --> 00:06:46.820\nSo that basic-packet filtering\nfirewall isn't really gonna cut\n\n119\n00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:47.970\nthe mustard, per se, today.\n\n120\n00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a lot of other\nthings I can look at in the packet,\n\n121\n00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.210\nto determine whether or\nnot I'm gonna allow that data in.\n\n122\n00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.778\nSo we're gonna get more control,\nmore capabilities on our next-generation,\n\n123\n00:06:57.778 --> 00:06:59.870\nour later-generation firewalls.\n\n124\n00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:06.590\nSo the next one we'll talk about is\nwhat's known as a circuit-level firewall.\n\n125\n00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.910\nAnd a circuit level firewall looks at\nwhat we would call sessions, right?\n\n126\n00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.607\nA TCP session, for example.\n\n127\n00:07:12.607 --> 00:07:17.229\nWhen you connect to a web server,\nTCP goes through something known,\n\n128\n00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:19.950\nTCP, transmission control protocol.\n\n129\n00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.380\nGoes through something known\nas a three-way handshake.\n\n130\n00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:27.890\nIt establishes my computer and that\nweb server are establishing a session,\n\n131\n00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:30.420\nso we can start sending packets back and\nforth.\n\n132\n00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:34.186\nAnd it goes, there's a three step process\nthat bounces back and forth between there.\n\n133\n00:07:34.186 --> 00:07:38.344\nAnd circuit-level firewalls\nmonitor those TCP handshakes,\n\n134\n00:07:38.344 --> 00:07:42.193\nthose session creation portion\nof these conversations.\n\n135\n00:07:42.193 --> 00:07:43.750\nAnd it will keep track of those.\n\n136\n00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:49.681\nIt'll say, Wes' computer and\nNewegg.com have established a session.\n\n137\n00:07:49.681 --> 00:07:52.692\nAnd from then on,\ntraffic from Wes' computer to Newegg, or\n\n138\n00:07:52.692 --> 00:07:55.714\nfrom Newegg back to Wes' computer,\nis going to be allowed.\n\n139\n00:07:55.714 --> 00:07:58.057\nBecause it's part of that session.\n\n140\n00:07:58.057 --> 00:08:02.769\nIt has a memory that it stores information\nabout all of the sessions that have been\n\n141\n00:08:02.769 --> 00:08:06.110\nestablished on your network and\nit keeps track of those.\n\n142\n00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:09.410\nAnd so it's making its decisions based on,\nall right,\n\n143\n00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.980\nWes has established\na connection with Newegg.\n\n144\n00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.343\nI've got newegg.com or some other website.\n\n145\n00:08:14.343 --> 00:08:18.042\nI've got data coming back from Newegg.\n\n146\n00:08:18.042 --> 00:08:20.760\nIt's part of that same session, so\nI'm gonna go ahead and allow it.\n\n147\n00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.314\nIf Newegg had tried to send data in\nwithout any session we had established\n\n148\n00:08:24.314 --> 00:08:27.240\nfrom our inside users,\nthen it would not allow it, right?\n\n149\n00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:31.409\nThis data is not part of a session that\nsomebody's established, therefore,\n\n150\n00:08:31.409 --> 00:08:32.491\nI'm gonna drop it.\n\n151\n00:08:32.491 --> 00:08:34.740\nSo that's what a circuit\nlevel firewall is doing.\n\n152\n00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:38.090\nIt's looking at the sessions,\nthe TCP handshakes, and\n\n153\n00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:42.730\nthen it's restricting access\nto only authorized computers.\n\n154\n00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:46.390\nLike I said, they're the ones that are\ncoming from inside my network, all right?\n\n155\n00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:51.120\nNow the circuit level firewalls are also\nknown as what are called transparent\n\n156\n00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.090\nproxies.\n\n157\n00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:57.390\nCuz an interesting thing about the way\nthey do this process, the receiving end,\n\n158\n00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.420\nlike Newegg, in our example,\n\n159\n00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:03.430\ndoesn't ever see Wes as the one\nrequesting that webpage.\n\n160\n00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:07.830\nIt actually sees the firewall\nas requesting the webpage.\n\n161\n00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:12.780\nSo it hides our internal\nnetwork from the outside,\n\n162\n00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:17.590\nwhich is why we call it\na transparent proxy, all right?\n\n163\n00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:21.950\nTypically, these are run in conjunction\nwith other types of firewalls, though.\n\n164\n00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.520\nCuz they don't really give\nus that much control.\n\n165\n00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.480\nThey're only good at making sure only\n\n166\n00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.140\nauthorized computers are allowed\nto establish these sessions.\n\n167\n00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.260\nBut that's about it, right?\n\n168\n00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.660\nIt doesn't look at any\nof the other details,\n\n169\n00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.949\ncan't make any other decisions based\non information in those packets.\n\n170\n00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.250\nThen, you've got application\nlevel firewalls.\n\n171\n00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.680\nAnd application level firewalls\n\n172\n00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.400\nare able to do a much thorough\ninspection of the packet.\n\n173\n00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.100\nThey can look at the application data.\n\n174\n00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:54.800\nThe information that's\ninside those packets, right?\n\n175\n00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.730\nSo they can make sure that an application\nis following the rules that\n\n176\n00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:58.440\nit's supposed to.\n\n177\n00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.678\nThat it's always sending\nappropriate information.\n\n178\n00:10:01.678 --> 00:10:07.070\nIt gives us the ability to\nblock malicious activity.\n\n179\n00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:14.080\nWe can log user activity,\nwe can do content filtering.\n\n180\n00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.290\nThese are also known as a proxy server,\nright?\n\n181\n00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:21.560\nYou see this run in a lot of schools or\n\n182\n00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:27.195\nany place I need to control what\nmy users are accessing, right?\n\n183\n00:10:27.195 --> 00:10:32.440\nCuz unlike a packet filtering firewall,\nwhich is only looking at my IP address or\n\n184\n00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:36.350\nthe destination or the port numbers,\nthis can look at the data inside there.\n\n185\n00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:37.570\nSo I can set up rules and say, hey,\n\n186\n00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:43.320\nanybody that requests a page from\nbadsite.com, I can stop it right there.\n\n187\n00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.250\nI can look inside the packet.\n\n188\n00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:48.130\nI can see the URL you\nare trying to connect to and\n\n189\n00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.090\nI can stop it right there, right?\n\n190\n00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:54.448\nOr if you're downloading content\nthat's unauthorized, and we talk about\n\n191\n00:10:54.448 --> 00:10:58.952\npornography or things like that or\nillegally shared movies, we can see that.\n\n192\n00:10:58.952 --> 00:11:03.600\nThis can look inside the packets and\nsee that, and stop that type of activity.\n\n193\n00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.670\nSo we can do content filtering.\n\n194\n00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:10.250\nIt even gives us some protection against\ncertain types of malware, and viruses, or\n\n195\n00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:11.480\nspam.\n\n196\n00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.910\nIt can see that in those packets.\n\n197\n00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:17.640\nIf it recognizes a definition or something\ninside a packet matches a definition list,\n\n198\n00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.560\nyou can block those packets.\n\n199\n00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:25.762\nThose are application level firewalls or\nproxy servers.\n\n200\n00:11:25.762 --> 00:11:30.383\nThen we have something known as\nstateful multi-level firewalls,\n\n201\n00:11:30.383 --> 00:11:32.902\nstateful multi-level firewalls.\n\n202\n00:11:32.902 --> 00:11:37.925\nThese are basically a combination or\nthe best of my packet level firewalls or\n\n203\n00:11:37.925 --> 00:11:42.490\nmy packet filtering firewalls and\nmy application level firewalls.\n\n204\n00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:46.460\nIt's like we took both of those and\nkinda combined them together and\n\n205\n00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.740\ncame out with this one new super firewall.\n\n206\n00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.493\nThese do provide some of the highest\nlevels of security that we can get from\n\n207\n00:11:53.493 --> 00:11:54.437\nthese firewalls.\n\n208\n00:11:54.437 --> 00:11:59.425\nThey're also the most expensive and\nthey're typically a lot more complex to\n\n209\n00:11:59.425 --> 00:12:03.390\nconfigure, to get them set up initially,\nall right?\n\n210\n00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:08.260\nBut they do give us the best of\nall the different capabilities of\n\n211\n00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.965\nthe different generations of firewalls.\n\n212\n00:12:10.965 --> 00:12:16.464\nNow let's talk about what that means\nwhen we say stateful, all right?\n\n213\n00:12:16.464 --> 00:12:18.376\nStateful multi-level firewall.\n\n214\n00:12:18.376 --> 00:12:22.880\nWell, the multi-level is because it is\nlooking at different levels, right.\n\n215\n00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.510\nWe really should review a little bit\nof the OSI model when we're talking\n\n216\n00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:27.590\nabout this.\n\n217\n00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:32.620\nBecause when we talk about this\nrouter works at layer three, or\n\n218\n00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:37.120\nthis is a multi-level, or\nan application level firewall, what we're\n\n219\n00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:42.340\nreally saying is that it can look at\nthe packets as they go up that OSI model.\n\n220\n00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:46.121\nLet's see, Wes, it's has been a long\ntime since I've tried to do this.\n\n221\n00:12:46.121 --> 00:12:49.529\nGosh, now I can't even\nremember the acronym for it,\n\n222\n00:12:49.529 --> 00:12:52.440\nall people seem to need delicious pizza.\n\n223\n00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.450\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that'll work.\n\n224\n00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:54.260\n&gt;&gt; That was one of them.\n\n225\n00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.820\nThat was kind of top-down,\nwhat's the one from the bottom-up?\n\n226\n00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:57.788\n&gt;&gt; I can't remember that one.\n\n227\n00:12:57.788 --> 00:13:00.380\nI always remember all people\nseem to need data processing.\n\n228\n00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.342\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nall people seem to need data processing.\n\n229\n00:13:02.342 --> 00:13:07.473\nSo if we application, presentation,\n\n230\n00:13:07.473 --> 00:13:11.985\nsession, transport, network.\n\n231\n00:13:11.985 --> 00:13:12.503\n&gt;&gt; Data link?\n\n232\n00:13:12.503 --> 00:13:14.094\n&gt;&gt; Data link and physical, thank you.\n\n233\n00:13:14.094 --> 00:13:16.150\nWoo, brain cramp there for\na second, right?\n\n234\n00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:19.356\nThose were the different\nlayers of the OSI model.\n\n235\n00:13:19.356 --> 00:13:23.639\nAnd when we talk about like a packet level\nfirewall or a packet filtering firewall,\n\n236\n00:13:23.639 --> 00:13:25.299\nthose work down at layer three.\n\n237\n00:13:25.299 --> 00:13:28.910\nAnd they can look at the source and\ndestination address of those packets.\n\n238\n00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:30.826\nBut they're not looking\nat application data.\n\n239\n00:13:30.826 --> 00:13:34.536\nApplication level firewall is\nworking up at layer seven, and\n\n240\n00:13:34.536 --> 00:13:37.117\nit's working with the application data.\n\n241\n00:13:37.117 --> 00:13:42.092\nAnd that's what they mean by multi-level\nis this is working with those packets\n\n242\n00:13:42.092 --> 00:13:45.910\nat multiple levels within that OSI model,\nall right?\n\n243\n00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:47.370\nSo might wanna go back and review that.\n\n244\n00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:49.790\nGo back and\ntake a look at your basic networking.\n\n245\n00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:53.040\nIf you're like me, and you get some\nbrain cramps when you're trying\n\n246\n00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.610\nto remember the different\nlayers in the OSI model.\n\n247\n00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:59.750\nBut back to what we're talking about,\nstateful multi-level firewall,\n\n248\n00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:02.370\nnow we know why they say multi-level.\n\n249\n00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:06.319\nBecause it is working with the packets\nat multiple levels in the OSI.\n\n250\n00:14:06.319 --> 00:14:07.386\nSo also stateful,\n\n251\n00:14:07.386 --> 00:14:12.230\nbecause it does some of what we talked\nabout with the circuit-level firewall.\n\n252\n00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:14.560\nIt does pay attention to conversations or\n\n253\n00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:18.080\nto states,\nsessions that have been established.\n\n254\n00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.464\nBecause that makes it a little\nbit easier on the firewall\n\n255\n00:14:21.464 --> 00:14:24.497\nwhen it sees that a session\nhas been established.\n\n256\n00:14:24.497 --> 00:14:27.556\nIt can say, okay, that packet's going\nto be allowed because it's part\n\n257\n00:14:27.556 --> 00:14:29.122\nof an existing session, all right?\n\n258\n00:14:29.122 --> 00:14:32.686\nIt has memory, where it keeps track of\nthese sessions that have been established.\n\n259\n00:14:32.686 --> 00:14:35.103\nAnd when a packet comes through,\nit looks at the information,\n\n260\n00:14:35.103 --> 00:14:38.127\nit matches that to a session, it says,\nokay, already established session.\n\n261\n00:14:38.127 --> 00:14:39.970\nWe'll go ahead and\nallow that to come through.\n\n262\n00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:45.380\nIt can still do the detailed,\ndeep inspection\n\n263\n00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:51.560\nof those packets doing content filtering\nand things like that, all right?\n\n264\n00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:55.030\nLet's see what else I wanna\nmake sure we cover there.\n\n265\n00:14:55.030 --> 00:15:00.440\nSo we talked about stateless being\nwhat our packet filtering does, right?\n\n266\n00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.650\nIt's not paying attention.\n\n267\n00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:06.850\nEvery packet that comes through on\na stateless firewall has to be looked at\n\n268\n00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:08.290\nindividually, right?\n\n269\n00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:10.150\nOn its own honors, in other words.\n\n270\n00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.090\nIt has nothing to do with\nthe packet in front of it.\n\n271\n00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:14.430\nIt has nothing to do with\nthe packet coming after it.\n\n272\n00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:17.798\nHere's a packet, let's inspect it, run\nit through all of the rules, yes or no.\n\n273\n00:15:17.798 --> 00:15:20.050\nAllow it, throw it,\nwhatever we're gonna do with it.\n\n274\n00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:23.302\nNext one comes in,\nrepeat the process, right?\n\n275\n00:15:23.302 --> 00:15:27.709\nStateful pays attention to conversations,\nand it says, this packet is part of\n\n276\n00:15:27.709 --> 00:15:31.761\nthe conversation that that last packet\nthat I already allowed to go through.\n\n277\n00:15:31.761 --> 00:15:33.921\nTherefore, I can just\nput it on its coattails,\n\n278\n00:15:33.921 --> 00:15:36.570\nlet it go right through with it, right?\n\n279\n00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:38.600\nAs I said, with stateful, more expensive,\n\n280\n00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:42.780\nmore complex to configure these\ntypes of firewalls as well.\n\n281\n00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.270\nAnd then, let's go back and\n\n282\n00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:49.300\ntalk about hardware and\nsoftware based firewalls again.\n\n283\n00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.396\nLet's add a little bit more\nto what we discussed already.\n\n284\n00:15:52.396 --> 00:15:57.354\nA hardware firewall dedicated device has\nhardware dedicated to the job of being\n\n285\n00:15:57.354 --> 00:15:58.169\na firewall.\n\n286\n00:15:58.169 --> 00:16:01.976\nSo you can probably already\nguess that performance-wise,\n\n287\n00:16:01.976 --> 00:16:08.040\nA hardware based firewall is usually going\nto out perform a software based firewall.\n\n288\n00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:13.100\nNot because the software based\nfirewall is just that much worse or\n\n289\n00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.450\nnot able to perform as well.\n\n290\n00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:19.330\nBut because typically a software based\nfirewall is installed on a device that is\n\n291\n00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.205\nnot dedicated to acting as a firewall.\n\n292\n00:16:22.205 --> 00:16:25.320\nAt the minimum it probably\nit has an operating system\n\n293\n00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:28.270\nthat is running in the background and\ntaking up some resources.\n\n294\n00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:32.300\nIt might have other tasks, processes,\nservices that are running,\n\n295\n00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:35.820\nperforming other jobs,\nthat are taking up resources.\n\n296\n00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:39.200\nSo it's not dedicated like\na hardware firewall would be.\n\n297\n00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.330\nThat's not to say that you can beef\nup the heck out of that server and\n\n298\n00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:45.570\nmake a software based firewall\nthat performs really well, right.\n\n299\n00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:50.520\nIt's just that apples to apples,\nit's probably not gonna\n\n300\n00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:55.379\nperform as well as a hardware\nbased firewall, all right.\n\n301\n00:16:55.379 --> 00:16:58.277\nAvailability is another issue\nthat we have to talk about.\n\n302\n00:16:58.277 --> 00:17:02.540\nHardware based firewalls typically\nhave redundancy built into them.\n\n303\n00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:06.190\nThey might have multiple CPUs,\nthey might have multiple power supplies,\n\n304\n00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:08.120\nmultiple network adapters.\n\n305\n00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:10.140\nSo they've got redundancy built in.\n\n306\n00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.158\nSoftware based firewalls might or\nmight not,\n\n307\n00:17:12.158 --> 00:17:14.808\ndepending on how you've\nconfigured that machine, right.\n\n308\n00:17:14.808 --> 00:17:18.300\nWhether it has that level of\nredundancy and reliability.\n\n309\n00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:23.240\nIf I'm talking about operating systems,\nI mean our operating systems\n\n310\n00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.930\nnow a days are pretty darn reliable for\nthe most part.\n\n311\n00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:27.690\nBut we still have to\nreboot them now again.\n\n312\n00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:29.500\nWe have to apply updates.\n\n313\n00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.700\nAnd, I know, hardware based firewalls,\nmaybe you have to update firmware, but\n\n314\n00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:38.130\nnot nearly as often as I might have\nto reboot a software, or a server,\n\n315\n00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:42.090\nor a client operating system running\none of these software based firewalls.\n\n316\n00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:45.690\nSo reliability becomes an issue and\navailability becomes an issue,\n\n317\n00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:48.977\nbecause if I have to reboot that\nserver for some reason, well,\n\n318\n00:17:48.977 --> 00:17:52.143\nthe firewall service of\nthe application that I'm running,\n\n319\n00:17:52.143 --> 00:17:55.890\nthat software based firewall,\nis obviously gonna stop temporarily.\n\n320\n00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:58.390\nSo availability becomes an issue.\n\n321\n00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:02.600\nNow, when we're talking\nabout software firewalls,\n\n322\n00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.950\nwe also have to talk about different\ncategories of we can do there.\n\n323\n00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:11.079\nThere's host based software firewalls and\nthere's network based software firewalls.\n\n324\n00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.410\nHardware based firewalls are always,\nalmost always, network based.\n\n325\n00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:20.730\nYou could, well let's differentiate first,\nand then I'll explain.\n\n326\n00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:24.744\nA host based firewall\nprotects a single host.\n\n327\n00:18:24.744 --> 00:18:27.743\nSo a lot of you might run firewalls\non your client operating system,\n\n328\n00:18:27.743 --> 00:18:31.529\nmight be built into your operating system,\nlike Windows 10, it might be something\n\n329\n00:18:31.529 --> 00:18:35.450\nyou've downloaded and installed,\npurchased and installed on your system.\n\n330\n00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:39.290\nAnd that firewall protects your computer,\nright, traffic that's coming in and\n\n331\n00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:41.230\nout of that one system.\n\n332\n00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:42.765\nYou can have another\nsystem on the network,\n\n333\n00:18:42.765 --> 00:18:45.020\nit offers no protection to that one.\n\n334\n00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:50.180\nI'd have to install a host based software\nbased firewall on that one as well.\n\n335\n00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.710\nWhereas a network firewall is\ndesigned to protect the network.\n\n336\n00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:57.810\nWe might have a server that we\ninstall multiple network adapters, and\n\n337\n00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:01.810\nwe run a network based\nfirewall application on that.\n\n338\n00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:05.500\nAnd that would provide protection for\nthe network.\n\n339\n00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.010\nNo reason we can't use both.\n\n340\n00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:12.352\nThere are many times I might have network\nbase firewalls in place, but on particular\n\n341\n00:19:12.352 --> 00:19:17.637\nhosts I'm running software based firewalls\nor host based firewalls I should say.\n\n342\n00:19:17.637 --> 00:19:20.311\nIn fact Windows, honestly,\nis running a firewall by default.\n\n343\n00:19:20.311 --> 00:19:24.269\nSo if you've got a domain at\nyour corporate organization,\n\n344\n00:19:24.269 --> 00:19:28.228\nthey've got firewalls at your perimeter,\neach one of your\n\n345\n00:19:28.228 --> 00:19:32.995\nhost has the firewall as well unless\nthey've disabled it, all right.\n\n346\n00:19:32.995 --> 00:19:40.050\nHost based firewalls can\nend up being a bottleneck.\n\n347\n00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:41.900\nIf we take a server and\n\n348\n00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:47.240\nwe try to install a firewall on there,\nit can eat up a lot of resources.\n\n349\n00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.880\nEspecially of we start doing\nsome of that stateful or\n\n350\n00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.630\ndeep inspection on those packets.\n\n351\n00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:54.600\nIf you're talking about every\npacket that comes through and\n\n352\n00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.220\nI've got to take a look\ninside that packet.\n\n353\n00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:01.110\nIt's going to throw network down, it's\ngoing to cause a, something's going to\n\n354\n00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:06.550\nbottleneck on that server,\nwhether it's CPU or memory or hard drive.\n\n355\n00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:08.519\nAt some point you're gonna\nhave a bottleneck there.\n\n356\n00:20:11.337 --> 00:20:12.050\nWhat else?\n\n357\n00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:14.446\nI think we've covered\nhardware versus software.\n\n358\n00:20:14.446 --> 00:20:19.430\nOther issues,\nhost OSs might not be as hardened as well\n\n359\n00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:24.780\nas say a dedicated hardware firewall,\nbecause again,\n\n360\n00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:26.900\nwe've run other applications on there.\n\n361\n00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:29.700\nThose other applications can\nintroduce vulnerabilities.\n\n362\n00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.960\nThe operating system itself\ncan introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n363\n00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.480\nSo typically, not that you can't, but\n\n364\n00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:41.270\nif we don't really take the time, usually\nthey're not going to be as hardened\n\n365\n00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:44.820\nas say a dedicated hardware\nbased firewall, all right.\n\n366\n00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.520\nThe good thing though,\n\n367\n00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.100\nI mean there are some upsides to\nsoftware based firewalls, I sit here and\n\n368\n00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.700\ntalk about them like they're the most\nhorrible thing in the world.\n\n369\n00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:56.733\nAnd they're not, they're very cost\neffective, they're not nearly as expensive\n\n370\n00:20:56.733 --> 00:20:59.928\nas going out and buying a Juniper,\na Cisco hardware based router.\n\n371\n00:20:59.928 --> 00:21:04.530\nI can get a software based firewall for\na lot less money.\n\n372\n00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:07.980\nSo if cost is a major concern,\nif I'm a small organization, sure,\n\n373\n00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:11.790\nI'd love to put one f those high end\nfirewalls at the border of our network,\n\n374\n00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.020\nbut I can't afford it.\n\n375\n00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.660\nI can't justify that cost.\n\n376\n00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:17.900\nSo maybe I go with a software\nbased firewall cuz I can get\n\n377\n00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:21.050\nwhat I need at a lot less cost.\n\n378\n00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:25.310\nThey're typically a lot\nless complex to configure.\n\n379\n00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:29.470\nThere's probably a Wizard that comes with\nit or some kind of graphical interface.\n\n380\n00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:32.830\nAnd some of these hardware based one\nare a lot more difficult to configure,\n\n381\n00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:36.680\nyou might have to use a special connection\nto get to them, to configure them.\n\n382\n00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.370\nMight not be in a language\nthat we're familiar with.\n\n383\n00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:43.190\nCreating those rules can be very,\nvery complex.\n\n384\n00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:46.350\nSo, their software based might\nbe a lot easier to set up.\n\n385\n00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:51.170\nSo there are some pros to using\nsoftware based firewalls as well.\n\n386\n00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:56.790\nSo Wes, that is a,\nI think it pretty much covers firewalls.\n\n387\n00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:58.910\n&gt;&gt; You just gotta make sure that\nyou have them turned on, right.\n\n388\n00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:01.790\nAnd one of the great things, one of the\nthings that you mentioned about firewalls\n\n389\n00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:05.570\nthat I love, you say they are less\nexpensive, right, cost effective.\n\n390\n00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:09.990\nI love the fact that Windows comes\nbundled with a firewall in there.\n\n391\n00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:12.050\nMike, I know you're, and\nI'm going to age Mike here, and\n\n392\n00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:13.050\nhe probably won't like this one.\n\n393\n00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:16.210\nBut you've probably been around Windows\nwhen you didn't have a firewall\n\n394\n00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:16.920\nin it, right.\n\n395\n00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.220\nYou had to go to some third\nparty like Zone Alarm.\n\n396\n00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:20.780\nI remember I used to get\none from Zone Alarm.\n\n397\n00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.510\nAnd then somewhere around XP,\nsay, service pack two.\n\n398\n00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:24.500\n&gt;&gt; Two, three yeah.\n\n399\n00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:25.430\n&gt;&gt; Something like that.\n\n400\n00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:27.140\nWe started having them bundled in.\n\n401\n00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:29.580\nSo, a lot of good\ninformation on firewalls.\n\n402\n00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:32.700\nHowever, Mike, it does look like we\nare coming to the end of another episode.\n\n403\n00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:37.170\nBut before we do, any final words when\nit comes to firewalls in general?\n\n404\n00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:38.232\n&gt;&gt; No, I think we're good.\n\n405\n00:22:38.232 --> 00:22:40.740\n&gt;&gt; All right, well that's a great\nplace to wrap this one up.\n\n406\n00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:44.820\nSigning out for ITPRO.TV,\nremember, I'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n407\n00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:45.640\n&gt;&gt; And I'm

00:00:27.823\n&gt;&gt; Hey Zach.\n\n11\n00:00:27.823 --> 00:00:30.476\nHe's the one that feeds me the data\nwhen you guys aren't looking, so\n\n12\n00:00:30.476 --> 00:00:31.639\nI'm just regurgitating it.\n\n13\n00:00:31.639 --> 00:00:33.080\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sure, sure.\n\n14\n00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.620\nHey listen,\nI wanted to talk about something.\n\n15\n00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.273\nNetwork Isolation,\nnetwork isolation what is that?\n\n16\n00:00:39.273 --> 00:00:40.482\nExplain the whole model action.\n\n17\n00:00:40.482 --> 00:00:45.291\n&gt;&gt; It's a great question and\nwe should expound on that topic, right?\n\n18\n00:00:45.291 --> 00:00:50.271\nNetwork isolation, when you talk\nabout security in an IT networking,\n\n19\n00:00:50.271 --> 00:00:53.930\none of the techniques,\nif I can speak English here.\n\n20\n00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.350\nOne of the techniques that we\nwill use is network isolation.\n\n21\n00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.838\nWe can isolate portions of our\nnetwork to provide different levels of\n\n22\n00:01:00.838 --> 00:01:01.869\nsecurity, right?\n\n23\n00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:05.273\nNot everything on our network needs\nthe same level of security, and\n\n24\n00:01:05.273 --> 00:01:08.850\nwe can isolate things to further\ncontrol access to them as well.\n\n25\n00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.071\nIf it's isolated and hard to get to,\nor there's limited ways to get to it,\n\n26\n00:01:13.071 --> 00:01:14.684\nthen I can control, right?\n\n27\n00:01:14.684 --> 00:01:19.060\nIt's like a certain movie we all know,\nwe say, you shall not pass.\n\n28\n00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.700\nIf there is only one path to get in there,\nI can block that path, or\n\n29\n00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.960\nI can very well control who's\nallowed to come through there.\n\n30\n00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.042\nSo that's really, in a broad sense,\nwhat network isolation is about.\n\n31\n00:01:31.042 --> 00:01:34.490\nSo we'll talk about some of the different\ntechniques we can use to accomplish that.\n\n32\n00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.717\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\nAnd I guess a LAN comes into play here?\n\n33\n00:01:37.717 --> 00:01:42.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if we're gonna talk about network\nisolation we need to understand some basic\n\n34\n00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.050\nnetworking concepts, right?\n\n35\n00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.007\nAnd I know most of you\nare already familiar with this.\n\n36\n00:01:46.007 --> 00:01:47.370\nJust a real quick refresh.\n\n37\n00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.250\nWhen we talk about a LAN,\na local area network, we're talking about\n\n38\n00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.120\na group of devices that are connected,\nthat are typically in\n\n39\n00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.280\na single geographical location,\nand under a single administration.\n\n40\n00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.800\nLike your office building might\nbe your corporate LAN, or if you\n\n41\n00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.100\nhave a single floor in a tall building\nthat you own, that might be your LAN.\n\n42\n00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.794\nAt your house, all of your devices,\nyour computer, your DVD player,\n\n43\n00:02:14.794 --> 00:02:16.606\nyour smart TV and all that.\n\n44\n00:02:16.606 --> 00:02:20.030\nThey’re all connected together and\nthat is your own personal local\n\n45\n00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.730\narea network that you operate, right,\nthat’s under your administration.\n\n46\n00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.797\nNow, LANs are, when we connect\na computer to a LAN like that, the way\n\n47\n00:02:28.797 --> 00:02:33.496\nethernet works, we have to think about\nthe types of traffic we see on there, and\n\n48\n00:02:33.496 --> 00:02:37.803\nwe remember that there’s unicast,\nmulticast and broadcast traffic.\n\n49\n00:02:37.803 --> 00:02:41.822\nAnd if you remember, broadcast traffic\nis when there's no destination,\n\n50\n00:02:41.822 --> 00:02:44.385\nyou send it out to everybody on the LAN.\n\n51\n00:02:44.385 --> 00:02:46.750\nKinda like if you were in a group\nof people sitting at a table and\n\n52\n00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.960\nyou talk loudly so everybody can hear you.\n\n53\n00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.180\nYou're not talking\nspecifically to one person.\n\n54\n00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.414\nYou're talking to everybody in the group,\nright?\n\n55\n00:02:53.414 --> 00:02:58.857\nAnd that's fine, but as we start\nadding more and more and more devices\n\n56\n00:02:58.857 --> 00:03:04.774\nto that LAN, it gets harder and harder for\na node to communicate on that LAN.\n\n57\n00:03:04.774 --> 00:03:09.590\nAnd the amount of broadcast\ntraffic can start saturating it.\n\n58\n00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.340\nThink about that dinner\nparty of six people.\n\n59\n00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.650\nIt's pretty easy to\ncommunicate with everybody.\n\n60\n00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.830\nBut as you get to 20 people 40 people.\n\n61\n00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.319\nAll of a sudden there's just so much\nmurmuring going on that it's hard to make\n\n62\n00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.070\nout what the person next to you\nis trying to tell you, right?\n\n63\n00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.265\nAnd, that's like that broadcast traffic\non a LAN it will start saturating.\n\n64\n00:03:28.265 --> 00:03:33.715\nSo we can do a couple of different\nthings to try to alleviate or\n\n65\n00:03:33.715 --> 00:03:34.905\nhelp with that issue.\n\n66\n00:03:34.905 --> 00:03:41.173\nRemember LANs are against a single network\nunder a single administrative control,\n\n67\n00:03:41.173 --> 00:03:44.705\nall the devices are connected\nvia either hubs or\n\n68\n00:03:44.705 --> 00:03:48.160\nswitches in a local area network,\nor in a LAN.\n\n69\n00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.212\nIf we have more than one LAN, we'll\nconnect them together with something known\n\n70\n00:03:52.212 --> 00:03:55.610\nas a router, which we're gonna\ncome back and talk about later on.\n\n71\n00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.120\nBut a router connects multiple LANs.\n\n72\n00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.202\nLike your organization might\nhave two different buildings.\n\n73\n00:04:01.202 --> 00:04:05.284\nEach one's its own LAN and\nthere's a router that connects the two so\n\n74\n00:04:05.284 --> 00:04:07.870\nthat they can talk to\neach other all right.\n\n75\n00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.689\nSo if you have a situation where\nyour LAN is growing and growing and\n\n76\n00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:11.971\ntheres too many devices, and\n\n77\n00:04:11.971 --> 00:04:15.729\nyour seeing that the network bandwidth is\nbeing sucked up through broadcast traffic.\n\n78\n00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:20.559\nYou could break that LAN up into smaller\nchunks by putting routers in place right,\n\n79\n00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:23.980\ncuz routers will break\nit into smaller LANs.\n\n80\n00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.612\nBut one of the downsides of doing that is\nan increase in latency because routers\n\n81\n00:04:28.612 --> 00:04:32.403\nhave to process that information and\nit can slow the traffic down\n\n82\n00:04:32.403 --> 00:04:35.866\na little bit if we start just\nadding more and more routers.\n\n83\n00:04:35.866 --> 00:04:38.210\n&gt;&gt; Hey Mike, what is a VLAN?\n\n84\n00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.360\n&gt;&gt; That's another great question Zach.\n\n85\n00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.764\nAnd when we talk about ways that I\ncan break that local area network\n\n86\n00:04:43.764 --> 00:04:46.420\ndown without adding routers.\n\n87\n00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.440\nThat's where VLANS come in.\n\n88\n00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.446\nIt's really what they were designed for.\n\n89\n00:04:49.446 --> 00:04:52.630\nI need to divide this local area\nnetwork up because I get too many\n\n90\n00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.274\ndevices on there, and\nthere's too much traffic and\n\n91\n00:04:55.274 --> 00:04:58.470\nthey're unable to communicate\nat a reasonable rate.\n\n92\n00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.480\nI'm gonna break it up.\n\n93\n00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.610\nBut I don't wanna put routers.\n\n94\n00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:01.379\nRouters are expensive.\n\n95\n00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:03.543\nRouters take administration.\n\n96\n00:05:03.543 --> 00:05:08.430\nIt adds complexity to my\nnetworking my topology.\n\n97\n00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.870\nSo there's gotta be a better solution and\nthat's where they came out with VLANs or\n\n98\n00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.610\nvirtual local area networks\nis what a VLAN stands for.\n\n99\n00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.540\nThey're logical network\nsegments that break\n\n100\n00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.970\nup our LAN Into what we would\ncall VLANs or broadcast domains.\n\n101\n00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.850\nSo now broadcast traffic,\nif we take our one LAN and\n\n102\n00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.600\nif one computer hollers out, everybody\non that local area network hears it.\n\n103\n00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.360\nBut if I take that LAN and break it up\ninto two VLANs, a node on VLAN A, for\n\n104\n00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.880\nexample, when he sends\nout broadcast traffic,\n\n105\n00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.960\nevery other node of VLAN A will hear that\nthe nodes on VLAN B will not, right?\n\n106\n00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.834\nThey're on their own\nvirtual local area network.\n\n107\n00:05:45.834 --> 00:05:47.190\nSee how that works?\n\n108\n00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.520\nAnd so we're gonna do this\nlogically though, not physically.\n\n109\n00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.430\nWe're not taking routers and dropping them\ninto place, we're doing it logically.\n\n110\n00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.960\nTypically it's gonna be done with\nwhat's known as a VLAN switch.\n\n111\n00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.190\nSo we're still down at Layer\ntwo with a switch, right?\n\n112\n00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.649\nRouters are up there at layer three,\nbut we're down at layer two.\n\n113\n00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:12.932\nAnd we'll use VLANs to segregate this\ntraffic or divide it up and make smaller\n\n114\n00:06:12.932 --> 00:06:19.150\nbroadcast domains so we can, hopefully,\nincrease our throughput on our network.\n\n115\n00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.518\nAnd a key here is, remember that between\nthe VLANs the traffic is not routed.\n\n116\n00:06:23.518 --> 00:06:27.462\nIt's actually switch,\nbecause it's a more faster technology, so\n\n117\n00:06:27.462 --> 00:06:31.814\nwe get that performance or we don't get\nthe degradation of performance that\n\n118\n00:06:31.814 --> 00:06:33.850\nwe do if we throw in routers.\n\n119\n00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.690\nSo higher performance cuz of broadcast\ndomain are gonna be smaller,\n\n120\n00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.030\neasier management of devices.\n\n121\n00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.810\nBecause I can, with my VLANs I'm\nnot just going to do it randomly.\n\n122\n00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:47.061\nI'm not just going to create two VLANs and\nsay okay first node on this one,\n\n123\n00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:49.062\nfirst node on this one or\nanything like that.\n\n124\n00:06:49.062 --> 00:06:51.940\nI'm gonna make one VLAN for\nall of my clients.\n\n125\n00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.640\nI may make another VLAN for my servers.\n\n126\n00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.650\nAnother VLAN for\nI don't know, something else.\n\n127\n00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.786\nMy HR department that I kinda wanna\nsegregate out, because they access so\n\n128\n00:07:01.786 --> 00:07:03.111\nmuch sensitive information.\n\n129\n00:07:03.111 --> 00:07:07.600\nOr my research and development department,\nor something like that, right.\n\n130\n00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.808\nSo we can create these VLANs and\nthat allows for user administration,\n\n131\n00:07:11.808 --> 00:07:16.247\nbecause now I can administer each\nlittle section kind of independently.\n\n132\n00:07:16.247 --> 00:07:22.660\nAnd we get additional security\nbecause now they're separate.\n\n133\n00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:27.650\nWe wanna be careful with this because\nit's not a huge amount of security.\n\n134\n00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:32.281\nVLAN hopping is a very real thing and the\nbad guys know how to hop from one VLAN to\n\n135\n00:07:32.281 --> 00:07:35.790\nanother depending on\ntechnologies we're using.\n\n136\n00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:39.845\nBut, in its basic sense,\nyou are segregating out the network.\n\n137\n00:07:39.845 --> 00:07:42.360\nAnd nodes on VLAN one have to go\n\n138\n00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.850\nthrough this switch to talk\nto the nodes on VLAN two.\n\n139\n00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:49.143\nTherefore, I've got a chance to control\nthat traffic with access control lists, or\n\n140\n00:07:49.143 --> 00:07:52.315\nfirewalls, even,\nwe could use between those guys all right.\n\n141\n00:07:52.315 --> 00:07:56.044\nSo there is some additional\nsecurity by creating VLANs.\n\n142\n00:07:56.044 --> 00:08:00.887\nIt definitely keeps broadcast traffic\nlimited to that one Virtual LAN but\n\n143\n00:08:00.887 --> 00:08:03.696\ndo, like I say, keep in mind that's it not\n\n144\n00:08:03.696 --> 00:08:08.760\nthe end all in security because\nVLAN hopping is a very real thing.\n\n145\n00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.570\n&gt;&gt; How do we put a host on a VLAN.\n\n146\n00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:12.660\n&gt;&gt; That's a good question.\n\n147\n00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.993\nHow do I say okay-\n&gt;&gt; Off the top of my head.\n\n148\n00:08:15.993 --> 00:08:17.049\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's just one after the other.\n\n149\n00:08:17.049 --> 00:08:19.365\nThis guy's amazing.\n\n150\n00:08:19.365 --> 00:08:21.920\n[LAUGH] How do we assign a host to a VLAN?\n\n151\n00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.840\nHow do I say alright,\n\n152\n00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.620\nMike's laptop, you're on VLAN 1,\nthe server, you're on VLAN 2.\n\n153\n00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.250\nAnd there's a couple different\nways we can do this.\n\n154\n00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.020\nTypically, like I said,\nwe're using VLAN switch.\n\n155\n00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:35.461\nAnd we can do it by port number.\n\n156\n00:08:35.461 --> 00:08:37.550\nIf I've got a 48 plug switch.\n\n157\n00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:39.400\nIt's got 48 plugs on there.\n\n158\n00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.480\nAll the cables from all the computers\naround the building are coming\n\n159\n00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.670\ninto my server closet and\nI'm plugging them into the switch.\n\n160\n00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.110\nWell, I can divide that switch up.\n\n161\n00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:54.260\nI can say, ports 1 through 12, or\nwhat have you, is gonna be VLAN 1.\n\n162\n00:08:54.260 --> 00:09:00.082\n13 through 24 if VLAN 2, 25 through\n36 is 3, and 37 through 48 is VLAN 4.\n\n163\n00:09:00.082 --> 00:09:05.663\nSo if I take that cable and plug it\ninto port 10, you're not part of VLAN 1.\n\n164\n00:09:05.663 --> 00:09:09.700\nIt's about which port you're\nconnected to on the switch itself.\n\n165\n00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:15.140\nWorks fine, but I will tell you,\nworks best in a very static environment,\n\n166\n00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:18.365\ndesktop, servers, things that don't move.\n\n167\n00:09:18.365 --> 00:09:21.790\nBecause, let's say you wanted\nMy Laptop to be in VLAN or\n\n168\n00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:26.650\nMy Laptop to be in VLAN 1, and so you\nfound My Desk, you trace that cable back,\n\n169\n00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:30.220\nyou know which one it is, you plug it\ninto a port that's assigned to VLAN1.\n\n170\n00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:31.480\nWell, it's a laptop.\n\n171\n00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:35.380\nI can unplug and go sit somewhere else,\nplug into a different port in the wall,\n\n172\n00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.790\nwhich might or\nmight be patched down to VLAN 1.\n\n173\n00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:41.040\nSo now all of a sudden, you've got\nto go back in the server closet and\n\n174\n00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.610\ngo, Mike moved over here.\n\n175\n00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:45.730\nLet's move that cable over to VLAN 1,\nright?\n\n176\n00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:49.770\nSo a lot of physical re-arrangement\nif your devices move.\n\n177\n00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:54.820\nSo static environments,\nthe use of ports to assign VLAN is great.\n\n178\n00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.100\nThat dynamic environments, not so good.\n\n179\n00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.180\nAnother way we could do it\nis MAC addresses, right?\n\n180\n00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:03.600\nWe know that network adapters\nhave a relatively permanent, or\n\n181\n00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.970\na hard-coded identifier associated\nwith them, the MAC address,\n\n182\n00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:11.250\nthe Media Access Control address,\n12-digit hexadecimal number.\n\n183\n00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:12.830\nWell, I can use that.\n\n184\n00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:16.720\nI can say,\nthis MAC address is part of VLAN 1.\n\n185\n00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.600\nThis MAC address is part of VLAN 2.\n\n186\n00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.380\nSo when traffic comes in to that switch,\nthe switch can look at the packet,\n\n187\n00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:25.694\nthe header, see the MAC address\nit knows what VLAN it's part of.\n\n188\n00:10:25.694 --> 00:10:30.000\nAnd it will allow the traffic go\nto that particular VLAN, right?\n\n189\n00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.790\nWhich is a great dynamic environment\ncuz now it doesn't matter\n\n190\n00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:34.140\nwhere I plugged into.\n\n191\n00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:37.550\nEvery packet I send is gonna have my MAC\naddress in it, and the switch will be able\n\n192\n00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:41.650\nto tell what VLAN I'm in, no matter\nwhere I've plugged into in the building.\n\n193\n00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.645\nSo good for dynamic environments, but\n\n194\n00:10:43.645 --> 00:10:46.854\nit also means I've got to generate\nthat list of MAC addresses.\n\n195\n00:10:46.854 --> 00:10:49.976\nI've gotta find the MAC address of\nevery device in my network, and\n\n196\n00:10:49.976 --> 00:10:52.510\nI've gotta assign it to a particular VLAN.\n\n197\n00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:54.090\nSo as we change devices,\n\n198\n00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:57.990\nadd new devices in there, that's updates,\nmanagement that I've gotta do, so\n\n199\n00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:01.900\nit is a little more work to get it set up\ninitially and to maintain it over time.\n\n200\n00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:07.960\nAnother way we can do this is IP subnet,\nbased on your subnet address of your\n\n201\n00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:14.770\ndevice, because a VLAN switch is\nalso known as a Layer 3 switch.\n\n202\n00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:17.200\nNormally, we think a switch is\nat operating at Layer 2, right?\n\n203\n00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.330\nThey don't read the network address.\n\n204\n00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.500\nThey read the MAC address and\nthat information.\n\n205\n00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:26.220\nBut a VLAN switch is a switch that's\ncapable of operating at both 2,\n\n206\n00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:30.150\nstill does its switching jobs, but\nit can also peek up at Layer 3 and\n\n207\n00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.930\nit can see the network address.\n\n208\n00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:36.370\nAnd we can base our VLANs based on\nour network address, or the subnet.\n\n209\n00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:41.070\nSo if I configure my clients to a certain\nsubnet, that subnet can be VLAN 1.\n\n210\n00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:44.080\nA different subnet for\nmy servers, and that's VLAN 2.\n\n211\n00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:47.690\nSo, we can use those.\n\n212\n00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:51.050\nThat really can hurt performance, though,\nbecause now that switch has to pay\n\n213\n00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.860\nattention to every packet and\nevery MAC address that comes in.\n\n214\n00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.350\nSo, in a larger environment,\n\n215\n00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:58.240\nthe performance is not\ngonna be the best on those.\n\n216\n00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.480\nAnother one you can do is by protocol.\n\n217\n00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.670\nAll right, now by protocol, it'd be,\nokay, well if you're using IPHSPX,\n\n218\n00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:05.700\nyou're part of VLAN 1.\n\n219\n00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.270\nIf you're using TCPIP,\nyou're part of VLAN 2.\n\n220\n00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:12.805\nIf you're using, I don't know,\nApple Talk, you're part of VLAN 3.\n\n221\n00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.592\nThat used to be a way we could do it.\n\n222\n00:12:16.592 --> 00:12:20.786\nYou can still do it this way but\nthe problem is just about everybody uses\n\n223\n00:12:20.786 --> 00:12:25.694\nTCIP nowadays, whether it's Novel,\nLinux, Apple, Microsoft, most devices\n\n224\n00:12:25.694 --> 00:12:30.510\nare going to be speaking TCIP to\ncommunicate on an ethernet based network.\n\n225\n00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:34.410\nSo the whole protocol thing really\ndoesn't give me a good way to\n\n226\n00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:36.100\ndivide up my devices into VLAN.\n\n227\n00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.460\nSo still there, but not used much anymore.\n\n228\n00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.220\n&gt;&gt; Mike,\nwhen you were talking about routers.\n\n229\n00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:46.340\nOr we were talking about lands rather,\nyou mentioned a router.\n\n230\n00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:48.190\nHow does a router help?\n\n231\n00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:50.460\n&gt;&gt; You know, routers are Layer 3 devices.\n\n232\n00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.020\nSo these guys are working\nup at the next Layer,\n\n233\n00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.080\nthey can work with the network addresses.\n\n234\n00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.800\nAnd this is how we connect LANs, right?\n\n235\n00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.000\nBecause your LAN has a subnet ID.\n\n236\n00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.890\nA second LAN has a different subnet ID,\n\n237\n00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:06.620\nand all the nodes on that subnet can\ncommunicate with each other, but\n\n238\n00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.480\nthey can't communicate with\nanybody on a different subnet.\n\n239\n00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:13.810\nA router's job is to route\npackets between network, or\n\n240\n00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:17.180\nbetween local are networks,\nor between subnets, right?\n\n241\n00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:22.480\nBecause routers see the network address\nand they can understand that this network\n\n242\n00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:27.420\nover here is 192.168.1.0 and\nthis network over here is 192.168.2.0/24.\n\n243\n00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:32.710\nAnd so it can take those\npackets that are destined for\n\n244\n00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:38.070\na different network and route them\nacross the network to that destination.\n\n245\n00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:39.220\nThat is going to be their job.\n\n246\n00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.320\n&gt;&gt; And there's software and\nhardware routers, right?\n\n247\n00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.810\n&gt;&gt; There is,\nmuch like we were talking about,\n\n248\n00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:45.130\nI forget what we were\ntalking about the other day.\n\n249\n00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:47.716\nFirewalls, where we said there's\nhardware-based firewalls and\n\n250\n00:13:47.716 --> 00:13:49.320\nsoftware-based firewalls.\n\n251\n00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.540\nThere are software routers, and\nthere are hardware-based routers.\n\n252\n00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:56.820\nAnd there are pros and cons to each\none of those, very similar though,\n\n253\n00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.100\nto what we talked about\nalready with firewalls.\n\n254\n00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.830\nWe talked about software routers.\n\n255\n00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:02.580\nGood things about these,\n\n256\n00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.990\nthey're an application that\nruns on my operating system.\n\n257\n00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:08.840\nSo the interface is most likely gonna be\nvery simple, very similar to everything\n\n258\n00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:12.810\nelse I use in my operating system,\nso a very standard interface.\n\n259\n00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:15.960\nTypically not nearly as expensive\nbecause I’m not buying hardware.\n\n260\n00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.400\nI’m buying a program that’s going to run,\n\n261\n00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.290\na piece of software that’s\ngonna run on my server.\n\n262\n00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.690\nAnd they're typically very flexible,\n\n263\n00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:29.520\nvery easy to reconfigure, but\ndrawbacks are gonna be performance.\n\n264\n00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.240\nMuch like we talked about with\nthe software based firewalls,\n\n265\n00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.060\nthat server might be doing\nother things besides routing.\n\n266\n00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:38.020\nAnd so all of that is gonna take\naway resources that could be\n\n267\n00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:42.560\nput toward routing, which can hamper the\nperformance on your software-based router,\n\n268\n00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.300\nlower reliability and scalability.\n\n269\n00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.270\nI keep saying this, but\n\n270\n00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:48.990\nsame thing as we talked about with\nthe software-based firewalls.\n\n271\n00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:51.780\nNot as reliable, because the operating\nsystem is doing other things.\n\n272\n00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.110\nIt has to be patched.\n\n273\n00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:56.020\nOther things on it might\nconsume resources, and cause\n\n274\n00:14:56.020 --> 00:15:00.100\nthe software-based router to not be able\nto work or wait for resources, all right?\n\n275\n00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.930\nSo we get lower reliability and\n\n276\n00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:06.780\nscalability becomes difficult with\nsoftware-based routers because I've got to\n\n277\n00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:10.130\nput more hardware into that server,\nadd more network adapters.\n\n278\n00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:14.900\nI'm typically limited on how many\nexpansion cards I can dump in there, so\n\n279\n00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:16.530\nscalability becomes a problem.\n\n280\n00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.045\nAnd limited protocol support can be\nanother issue with some of these\n\n281\n00:15:21.045 --> 00:15:22.220\nsoftware-based routers.\n\n282\n00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:26.060\nThey might not run the latest and\ngreatest routing protocol,\n\n283\n00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.080\nwhich we're gonna talk about later.\n\n284\n00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:32.600\nLike 2008, I think it was,\nonly supported RIP, or an old,\n\n285\n00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.900\nwhich is an older routing protocol.\n\n286\n00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.940\nSo that could be an issue as well.\n\n287\n00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:37.940\nYou look at the hardware side.\n\n288\n00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:41.250\nAnd I'll say it one more time and\nI promise I won't say it again.\n\n289\n00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:44.040\nJust like hardware-based firewalls, right?\n\n290\n00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:48.538\nBenefits, performance, dedicated\nhardware that does nothing but routing.\n\n291\n00:15:48.538 --> 00:15:53.987\nNow granted in today's routers, we do\nsometimes see multiple services DHCP,\n\n292\n00:15:53.987 --> 00:15:59.047\nfirewall, some other things like that,\nbut it's dedicated hardware.\n\n293\n00:15:59.047 --> 00:16:01.988\nThat does nothing but primarily routing.\n\n294\n00:16:01.988 --> 00:16:05.250\nSo we usually get great performance,\ngreat reliability.\n\n295\n00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:06.860\nThey don't need updates.\n\n296\n00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:10.120\nWe don't have other software\nthat needs updates and reboots.\n\n297\n00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:15.800\nOccasionally, you have to update your\nfirmware but very stable and reliable.\n\n298\n00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:20.210\nAnd typically a wide protocol support\non these hardware based routers.\n\n299\n00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:23.220\nBut they're gonna cost me more money,\nright?\n\n300\n00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:26.415\nGo out and price them some routers and\nsee what you get.\n\n301\n00:16:26.415 --> 00:16:30.746\nDepending on what you're trying to buy,\nthey can go from expensive to very, very,\n\n302\n00:16:30.746 --> 00:16:31.665\nvery expensive.\n\n303\n00:16:31.665 --> 00:16:34.805\nConfiguration can be very tricky.\n\n304\n00:16:34.805 --> 00:16:38.811\nA lot of them you have to do a secure\nshell or a special connection to get to,\n\n305\n00:16:38.811 --> 00:16:41.593\nand you're using command\nline to configure them,\n\n306\n00:16:41.593 --> 00:16:45.236\nso it's not like your everyday\nserver admin or network admin job.\n\n307\n00:16:45.236 --> 00:16:49.347\nYou've gotta know these new set of\nrules or languages to type in or\n\n308\n00:16:49.347 --> 00:16:51.231\nto configure these routers.\n\n309\n00:16:51.231 --> 00:16:54.364\nAnd it can be complex setting\nup routing and thinking about,\n\n310\n00:16:54.364 --> 00:16:57.750\nokay I've got a route there but\nis there a route back, all right?\n\n311\n00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:00.482\nSo the traffic can get out and\nyou're wondering what's happening, but\n\n312\n00:17:00.482 --> 00:17:01.620\nit's never able to get back.\n\n313\n00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.775\nSo they can be much more complex to setup.\n\n314\n00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:06.715\n&gt;&gt; Question for you?\n\n315\n00:17:06.715 --> 00:17:07.610\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n316\n00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:10.805\n&gt;&gt; So now we've been talking\nabout routers, and software, and\n\n317\n00:17:10.805 --> 00:17:11.930\nhardware, and LAN.\n\n318\n00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:13.301\nAnd how does this all work?\n\n319\n00:17:13.301 --> 00:17:15.384\nHow does this all come together and\nhow does it all work?\n\n320\n00:17:15.384 --> 00:17:19.034\n&gt;&gt; Well, routers have what they\ncall a routing table, right again,\n\n321\n00:17:19.034 --> 00:17:22.050\nthink back to what we\nstarted at the beginning.\n\n322\n00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:24.870\nRouters connect multiple\nnetworks together.\n\n323\n00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:28.679\nSo a router keeps track of what\nnetworks it's connected to.\n\n324\n00:17:28.679 --> 00:17:29.879\nLet's see, we'll keep it real simple.\n\n325\n00:17:29.879 --> 00:17:32.131\nWe'll say I got a four port router.\n\n326\n00:17:32.131 --> 00:17:37.878\nAnd it's got one interface\nconnected to 192.168.1.0/24.\n\n327\n00:17:37.878 --> 00:17:41.756\nAnother interface is connected to 2.0/24.\n\n328\n00:17:41.756 --> 00:17:44.729\nAnd you get the idea,\nanother one is 3.0 and 4.0.\n\n329\n00:17:44.729 --> 00:17:48.888\nAnd in its table,\nit's gonna keep track of that information.\n\n330\n00:17:48.888 --> 00:17:53.418\nSo that it knows, okay, interface 1,\nany traffic that comes to me, and has\n\n331\n00:17:53.418 --> 00:17:58.880\na destination of 192.168.1., something,\nI know to send it out to interface 1.\n\n332\n00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.466\nCuz I can look at my table, and\nI know that's the network that's\n\n333\n00:18:02.466 --> 00:18:05.600\nconnected to that particular\ninterface on the router.\n\n334\n00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.540\nThough they keep tables so\nthat they know what they're connected to.\n\n335\n00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:16.800\nThey also can keep information about what\ntheir neighbor routers are connected to.\n\n336\n00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.725\nSo not only do they know\nwhat they're connected to,\n\n337\n00:18:19.725 --> 00:18:24.118\nbut routers that they're connected to,\nthey get their information as well.\n\n338\n00:18:24.118 --> 00:18:27.111\nRouters share this information, we'll\ncome back to that concept in a minute.\n\n339\n00:18:27.111 --> 00:18:30.810\nNow that table,\nhow does that information get populated?\n\n340\n00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:33.800\nHow do we get that\ninformation in that table?\n\n341\n00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:34.850\nAnd we can do it statically.\n\n342\n00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:38.230\nIn other words, I can go to my\nadministrative console from my router and\n\n343\n00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:39.850\nI can type all that information in.\n\n344\n00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:42.040\nThat's known as static configuration.\n\n345\n00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:45.990\nJust like when we always\ntalk about static,\n\n346\n00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:47.610\nthe problem with that is it never changes.\n\n347\n00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:49.150\nIt's a very manual process.\n\n348\n00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:50.650\nI have to go in there and do that.\n\n349\n00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:55.070\nIf anything changes, I have to manually\ngo in there and update that information.\n\n350\n00:18:55.070 --> 00:19:03.050\nSo very small, very static environment,\nstatic routing tables might work okay.\n\n351\n00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:07.870\nAlso in some high security environments,\nwe might prefer to go static.\n\n352\n00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:13.680\nBecause there's no way other routers, bad\nguys running rogue routers trying to slip\n\n353\n00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:18.590\nbad routing information into my router so\nthat it routes information the wrong way\n\n354\n00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:22.630\nand it gets outside of my network and\nthey can steal it, or something like that.\n\n355\n00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:27.290\nWith manual, you've gotta get into\nthe router to configure those routes.\n\n356\n00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:29.020\nAnd I can see in a high\nsecurity environment,\n\n357\n00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:31.910\nstatic might be a benefit, right?\n\n358\n00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:35.430\nBut normally,\nrouters are set up dynamically.\n\n359\n00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:37.660\nEspecially the ones that we\ndon't deal with everyday.\n\n360\n00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:40.520\nThe ones out on the internet\nthat allow us to\n\n361\n00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:44.610\nconnect to all the wonderful resources\nout there in the world wide web.\n\n362\n00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:45.540\nThose are gonna be dynamic.\n\n363\n00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.750\nNobody goes in and\nmanually updates those routing tables.\n\n364\n00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:54.460\nThey get their information\nby using routing protocols.\n\n365\n00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:59.210\nLanguages that we can use,\nthat routers use to talk to each other.\n\n366\n00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:02.210\nSo when you plug in a new router\nin a dynamic environment,\n\n367\n00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:04.910\nit doesn't know anything, right, blank.\n\n368\n00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:07.350\nYou plug that first cable into it, and\n\n369\n00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:10.250\nit learns what that network\nis by the traffic coming in.\n\n370\n00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:14.394\nAll that traffic is gonna be coming from\na particular subnet, and so it learns.\n\n371\n00:20:14.394 --> 00:20:18.720\nIt says, hey, all this traffic\nis coming from 192.168.1.0/24,\n\n372\n00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.677\nthat must be the network\nthat's out in that interface.\n\n373\n00:20:21.677 --> 00:20:25.897\nIt's gonna start building that table, and\nthen other routers that are connected to\n\n374\n00:20:25.897 --> 00:20:28.643\nthat network,\nthey'll start talking to each other.\n\n375\n00:20:28.643 --> 00:20:32.270\nWell, hey, I see you're connected to\none and two, I'm connected to subnet 3.\n\n376\n00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:35.710\nSo if you ever need to send anything to\nsubnet 3, I know you're not connected to\n\n377\n00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:38.830\nit, just send it to me and\nI'll pass it on to subnet 3, right?\n\n378\n00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:42.390\nThis is how they start sharing\ntheir information in building\n\n379\n00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:46.450\nbasically a layout or a map so\nthey learn where are these networks are.\n\n380\n00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:49.920\nAnd now that first router says,\nokay I'm connected to one and two, but\n\n381\n00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.900\nI've got a buddy that's\nconnected to subnet 3.\n\n382\n00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:55.150\nSo if any traffic comes in for subnet 1,\nI can send it right over there.\n\n383\n00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:58.060\nIf it comes in for subnet 2,\nI can send it right over there.\n\n384\n00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:01.650\nIf it comes in for subnet 3,\nI'm not connected to subnet 3 but\n\n385\n00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:02.450\nI know somebody that is.\n\n386\n00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:05.598\nI'll send it to him and\nhe can send it to subnet 3, right?\n\n387\n00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:09.449\nSo they start sharing the information and\nbuilding those routing tables up and\n\n388\n00:21:09.449 --> 00:21:10.799\nthat's dynamic routing.\n\n389\n00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:13.762\nAll right.\n&gt;&gt; Protocols.\n\n390\n00:21:13.762 --> 00:21:14.672\n&gt;&gt; Sure, protocol.\n\n391\n00:21:14.672 --> 00:21:15.490\n&gt;&gt; Do we have time for this?\n\n392\n00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:17.830\nOkay, so\nyou mentioned protocols before and\n\n393\n00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:20.350\nI know that's what you were\nalluding to here a second ago.\n\n394\n00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:21.700\nThat's a set of rules, right?\n\n395\n00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:25.450\nIt's like this is the way it is,\nit cannot be changed.\n\n396\n00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:26.330\n&gt;&gt; It's exactly right.\n\n397\n00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:28.560\nIt is a set of rules for communicating.\n\n398\n00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.050\nIt's just like a language, right?\n\n399\n00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:34.950\nWe have rules in the English language and\nevery other language has rules, right?\n\n400\n00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:36.570\nHow you conjugate verbs.\n\n401\n00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:40.200\nHow you have nouns and verbs and create\nsentences so that we can communicate.\n\n402\n00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:44.445\nCuz if there were no rules and I could say\nwhatever I wanted in any order I wanted\n\n403\n00:21:44.445 --> 00:21:47.205\nit, would be difficult to communicate,\nright?\n\n404\n00:21:47.205 --> 00:21:48.157\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n405\n00:21:48.157 --> 00:21:52.335\n&gt;&gt; Well, routers, when they share\ninformation, they use a protocol which is\n\n406\n00:21:52.335 --> 00:21:57.330\na language, or a set of rules of how\nthey go about sharing that information.\n\n407\n00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:59.690\nNow, there are different\nprotocols that we can implement.\n\n408\n00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:03.727\nThere's a couple that are called out\nin particular on the exam objective for\n\n409\n00:22:03.727 --> 00:22:04.303\nthis MTA.\n\n410\n00:22:04.303 --> 00:22:05.060\n&gt;&gt; Which is important.\n\n411\n00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:06.470\n&gt;&gt; Yes, which is definitely important.\n\n412\n00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:07.810\nSo we wanna make sure we cover those.\n\n413\n00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:14.550\nWhat I should say, these are classes\nof protocols rather than an individual\n\n414\n00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:19.430\nprotocol, like distance vector\nis a type of routing protocol.\n\n415\n00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:23.020\nLink state is another\ntype of routing protocol,\n\n416\n00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:26.720\nthere are examples like rip is\na distance vector protocol.\n\n417\n00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:30.630\nOSPF is a link state routing protocol,\nright?\n\n418\n00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:31.680\nSo what we're talking about here,\n\n419\n00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:35.790\njust the classes of protocols\nnot specific protocols.\n\n420\n00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:40.367\nWhen we're talking about distance vector,\nthis is an over routing protocols and\n\n421\n00:22:40.367 --> 00:22:45.170\nit used to work great until we had the\ninternet or all these wonderful things.\n\n422\n00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:48.980\nDistance vector, when the routers\nshare their information and\n\n423\n00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:53.860\nthey're using a distance vector protocol,\nthey send their entire routing table.\n\n424\n00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:57.650\nIf there's ever a change to that routing\ntable on a scheduled interval, or\n\n425\n00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:02.140\nwhen there's changes,\nthey will resend the entire routing table.\n\n426\n00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.697\nNow this routing table\ncan start to get big.\n\n427\n00:23:04.697 --> 00:23:06.848\nAnd only one thing might\nhave changed on there, or\n\n428\n00:23:06.848 --> 00:23:08.497\nit's just they're scheduled time.\n\n429\n00:23:08.497 --> 00:23:11.595\nThey will again send\nthe entire routing table,\n\n430\n00:23:11.595 --> 00:23:16.110\nwhich can generate unnecessary\ntraffic on my network.\n\n431\n00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:19.578\nSo it's not the most efficient\nof routing protocols, but\n\n432\n00:23:19.578 --> 00:23:21.558\nback in the day with Ubrban net and\n\n433\n00:23:21.558 --> 00:23:26.260\nthen back before we had the world wide web\nas we know it now, it was not that bad.\n\n434\n00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:27.590\nIt worked just fine.\n\n435\n00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:34.500\nThe issues we have with it now though\nis that there's a lot of overhead to\n\n436\n00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:37.610\ndistance vector protocols,\nand it doesn't scale well.\n\n437\n00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:41.900\nDistance vector, there's many\ndifferent metrics that we can use.\n\n438\n00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:44.920\nBut distance vector uses\nsomething known as a hop count.\n\n439\n00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:50.195\nAnd that is how many routers I have to\ngo through to get to the destination.\n\n440\n00:23:50.195 --> 00:23:53.345\nSo if I say subnet C is two hops away,\n\n441\n00:23:53.345 --> 00:23:58.806\nthat means there's two routers\nbetween the subnet I'm on And\n\n442\n00:23:58.806 --> 00:24:02.180\nSubnet C, the destination, right?\n\n443\n00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:07.170\nDistance vector has a limit of 15 hops.\n\n444\n00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:12.100\nIt's really 16,\nit's 0 through 15 if I'm not mistaken.\n\n445\n00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.422\nBut there's a limit to\nthe number of hops it can take.\n\n446\n00:24:14.422 --> 00:24:18.700\nAnd every router a packet goes through,\nit's gonna decrement or\n\n447\n00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.190\nreduce that hop count by one.\n\n448\n00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:25.820\nAnd when it gets to zero, the packet\ngets dropped, it can go no further.\n\n449\n00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:27.960\nWhich, again, was okay on small networks.\n\n450\n00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.630\nBut think about the Internet\nthat we have today.\n\n451\n00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:35.450\nIf I'm visiting some website, there could\nbe 15, 30 routers between me, who knows?\n\n452\n00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:38.650\nAnd the point is is this\ninspector won't go that far.\n\n453\n00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:41.100\nIt'll get to 15 hops and it'll just stop.\n\n454\n00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:44.160\nEven if the destination\nwas 1 more hop away, or\n\n455\n00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.760\n30 hops away,\nit's not gonna make it there.\n\n456\n00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.890\nSo it doesn't work on the Internet.\n\n457\n00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:52.725\nThere are some other big issues\nthat we have with distance vector.\n\n458\n00:24:52.725 --> 00:24:56.720\nThings like it takes a long time for\nconversions.\n\n459\n00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:03.970\nIf there's a change, it doesn't trigger\nthe sharing of that information.\n\n460\n00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:07.610\nThe next scheduled share,\nthey will share the routing information.\n\n461\n00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.323\nSo convergence can take a while.\n\n462\n00:25:11.323 --> 00:25:16.950\nConvergence is basically how long does it\ntake a change till everybody knows it.\n\n463\n00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:19.550\nI might change something, but\nZach doesn’t know about it yet.\n\n464\n00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:20.740\nAnd eventually, I'll tell Zach.\n\n465\n00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.090\nZach will tell Peter.\n\n466\n00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:23.125\nPeter will tell Titus.\n\n467\n00:25:23.125 --> 00:25:24.780\nAnd eventually,\nwe all know about it, right?\n\n468\n00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:25.590\nThat’s convergence,\n\n469\n00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:29.290\nhow long does it take before everybody\nis aware of a change like that?\n\n470\n00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:30.612\n&gt;&gt; Two and a half minutes.\n\n471\n00:25:30.612 --> 00:25:35.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH] and with distance vector,\nthat convergence time is very long.\n\n472\n00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:37.683\nWe end up with two other big\nissues with distance vector.\n\n473\n00:25:37.683 --> 00:25:41.548\nAnd that is routing loops and\ncount to infinity problems.\n\n474\n00:25:41.548 --> 00:25:44.111\n&gt;&gt; Well, Mike, I wanna hear all about\nthe protocols because it's very,\n\n475\n00:25:44.111 --> 00:25:44.760\nvery important.\n\n476\n00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.932\nBut it's gonna have to be in\npart two of Network Isolation.\n\n477\n00:25:48.932 --> 00:25:52.140\nAnd just give us a wrap up\nof what we've gone through.\n\n478\n00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:54.860\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yeah, so far we've\ntalked about some basics of networking.\n\n479\n00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.530\nWe talked about local area networks and\nhow they work.\n\n480\n00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:00.340\nAnd we talked about broadcast and\nhow we can use VLANs,\n\n481\n00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:03.940\nor virtual LANs to segment out that LAN.\n\n482\n00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:07.410\nTo make broadcast domains\nwithout the use of routers.\n\n483\n00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:08.700\nThen we talked about routers.\n\n484\n00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.550\nAnd hardware and software based routers.\n\n485\n00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:11.755\nAnd pros and cons of each.\n\n486\n00:26:11.755 --> 00:26:15.699\nAnd then we started talking about how\nrouters work with the routing table.\n\n487\n00:26:15.699 --> 00:26:19.590\nAnd the different protocols they use\nto share that routing information.\n\n488\n00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:22.490\n&gt;&gt; And there is more to come in part two,\nNetwork Isolation.\n\n489\n00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:23.750\nRound of applause for you, Mike.\n\n490\n00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:24.880\nYou did a marvelous job.\n\n491\n00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.020\nThis is MTA Security Fundamentals.\n\n492\n00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:28.050\nI'm your host, Zach Memos.\n\n493\n00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:32.650\nAnd did you know that an IT\npro is always learning?\n\n494\n00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:34.256\nA good IT pro is always learning.\n\n495\n00:26:34.256 --> 00:26:35.146\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n496\n00:26:35.146 --> 00:26:35.999\n&gt;&gt; I'm Zach Memos.\n\n497\n00:26:35.999 -->

00:00:13.240\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello again and\n\n4\n00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.850\nthanks for choosing ITPro TV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.380\nI'm your host, Zachary Memos,\n\n6\n00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.260\nas we continue on with\nMTA Security Fundamentals.\n\n7\n00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.490\nAnd the person bringing us all\nthe information we need to know about\n\n8\n00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.140\nnetwork isolation,\nright there, Mike Roderick.\n\n9\n00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.300\nMike, good to see you, sir.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Zach, good to be back.\n\n10\n00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.150\nGlad to be here talking about these\nfun network isolation topics, yes.\n\n11\n00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.930\n&gt;&gt; Part 2.\n\n12\n00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:36.870\n&gt;&gt; That's right, Part 2.\n\n13\n00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.973\nSo, Zach, we left off talking about\na particular routing protocol,\n\n14\n00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:45.297\nor a routing protocol class,\nI should say, distance vector protocols.\n\n15\n00:00:45.297 --> 00:00:49.979\nAnd we said that some of the things we\nlearned about them already was that they\n\n16\n00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:51.076\nused a hop count,\n\n17\n00:00:51.076 --> 00:00:56.900\nthe metric that they use to determine what\nis the best router is based of hop count.\n\n18\n00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.280\nSo which is the number of routers that\na packet's gonna have to travel through\n\n19\n00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.490\nto get to the destination.\n\n20\n00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.097\nWe also said the limit on that hop\ncount was 16, or 0 through 15.\n\n21\n00:01:06.097 --> 00:01:08.830\nIt gets decremented each time\nit goes through our router.\n\n22\n00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.170\nNow, we also said that there were some\nissues with distance vector protocols,\n\n23\n00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.430\nand those were routing loop issues, and\n\n24\n00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.200\ncount to infinity issues,\nas well as convergence issues, right?\n\n25\n00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.150\nWe said it takes a long time for a change\nin a routing table to propagate out to all\n\n26\n00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.490\nthe other routers because they only share\nthe routing information when they start up\n\n27\n00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.200\nand then on a scheduled interval.\n\n28\n00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.130\nSo if a change occurs right\nafter a scheduled interval,\n\n29\n00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.930\nit's not till the next scheduled interval\nbefore they are going to bother sending\n\n30\n00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.390\nanybody else that change.\n\n31\n00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.360\nMeans we have very long conversions\nwhich is never a good thing.\n\n32\n00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.130\nNow there are some things they put in\nplace to help with some of these issues or\n\n33\n00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.510\ndrawbacks of distance\nvector based protocols.\n\n34\n00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.180\nWith the routing loops,\nit's really configuring things properly.\n\n35\n00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.070\nA routing loop is when\nthere's more than one path.\n\n36\n00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.850\nA packet will end up bouncing\naround between routers, and\n\n37\n00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.550\ninstead of ending up at the destination,\nend up back where it started, and\n\n38\n00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.630\nthen kinda start the path all over.\n\n39\n00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.380\nAnd what's gonna happen is it's gonna loop\naround hoping to get to the destination\n\n40\n00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.400\nbut they keep sending it back\nto the original network.\n\n41\n00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.440\nAnd eventually, the hop count is gonna be\ndecremented all the way down to zero, and\n\n42\n00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.470\nthe packet's gonna get dropped, and\n\n43\n00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.130\nthe traffic will never make it to\nthe destination, not a good thing.\n\n44\n00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.370\nConfiguring our network\nproperly can help with that.\n\n45\n00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.450\nThe other issues, though,\n\n46\n00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.960\nlike the count to infinity, this has to do\nwith the way they share their information.\n\n47\n00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.700\nAnd we're not gonna go into super detail,\nbecause that's more of a higher end\n\n48\n00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.070\nepisode, if we were\ndoing a different exam.\n\n49\n00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.000\nFor this exam, I just want us to\nunderstand that count to infinity\n\n50\n00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.750\nbasically happens when\nrouters receive information.\n\n51\n00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.610\nLet's say that Zach was a router and\nI'm a router.\n\n52\n00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.610\nZach sent me some information about\na network that he's connected to.\n\n53\n00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.210\nI'm like, okay, and I update my\nrouting table with that information.\n\n54\n00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.300\nThen when it's my turn to share with Zach,\n\n55\n00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.980\nI tell him about the network\nthat I learned from him, right?\n\n56\n00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.010\nBut I add one more hop to it.\n\n57\n00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.328\nAnd so, now Zach adds it to his table but\n\n58\n00:03:09.328 --> 00:03:12.861\nincreases the number of hops\nthe way the networks is by one.\n\n59\n00:03:12.861 --> 00:03:16.014\nAnd then when he shares his information\nback with me he says by the way,\n\n60\n00:03:16.014 --> 00:03:19.220\nhere's a route to this network and\nI'm gonna increase it by one.\n\n61\n00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.680\nAnd what eventually happens is we keep\ngoing up and up and up, we hit 16,\n\n62\n00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.080\nand now that route is no longer reachable,\nright?\n\n63\n00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.760\nIt's a very basic way to\nlook at count to infinity.\n\n64\n00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.230\nThere's a little more to it than that,\n\n65\n00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.550\nbut we don't need to be\naware of that right now.\n\n66\n00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.710\nSo what do we do about it?\n\n67\n00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.100\nWell, with count to infinity\nthere's a couple solutions.\n\n68\n00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.703\nThey can do what's called a split horizon,\nwhich means if\n\n69\n00:03:42.703 --> 00:03:48.240\nZach shares information about a particular\nnetwork with me that I didn't know about,\n\n70\n00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.920\nI'm never gonna share that\ninformation back with Zach.\n\n71\n00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.380\nWhich kind of makes sense, right?\n\n72\n00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.650\nI learned about that network from Zach,\nwhy would I tell him about the network?\n\n73\n00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.060\nHe already knows about it.\n\n74\n00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.040\nSo that's called split horizon.\n\n75\n00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.980\nA router never will share\ninformation about a route\n\n76\n00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.640\nout of the interface that it learned\nabout the route in the first place.\n\n77\n00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.290\nAll right, I know that sounds crazy,\nbut that's how we prevent that.\n\n78\n00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.480\nWe can also do split horizon\nwith poison reverse.\n\n79\n00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.070\nWhere, if I do share it back with the\ninterface that I learned about the route\n\n80\n00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.680\nfrom, I will increase the hop count and\nI'll tell it, hey I learned about this.\n\n81\n00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.950\nActually learned about it from you,\nbut the hop count's 16.\n\n82\n00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.080\nWell, they won't even add that to the\nrouting table because it's already past\n\n83\n00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.780\nthe number of hops that's allowed.\n\n84\n00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.970\nSo that's split horizon\nwith poison reverse.\n\n85\n00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.000\nAnother way we can help with distance\nvector is triggered updates.\n\n86\n00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.020\nNewer edition to distance vector protocols\nthat says hey, instead of waiting for your\n\n87\n00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.890\nscheduled interval, let's go ahead and\nreplicate a change as soon as you get it.\n\n88\n00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.970\nIf something's updated it can trigger\na sharing of that information which\n\n89\n00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.980\nreduces that convergence time,\nwhich makes it better.\n\n90\n00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.980\nBut, as I said earlier, distance vector\nrouting protocols work great in small\n\n91\n00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.502\nenvironments like internally in\na routed environment in a building or\n\n92\n00:05:03.502 --> 00:05:04.652\nsomething like that.\n\n93\n00:05:04.652 --> 00:05:09.451\nBut because of that 16-hop count limit,\nit's not going to work on the Internet,\n\n94\n00:05:09.451 --> 00:05:12.100\non the world wide web,\nor anything like that.\n\n95\n00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.420\nIt's just not going to be enough.\n\n96\n00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.930\nSo, that's where our other routing\nprotocol comes into play, or\n\n97\n00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.870\nrouting class of protocols.\n\n98\n00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.640\nAnd that is going to be our link state,\nall right?\n\n99\n00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.891\nLink state protocols do things\na little bit differently.\n\n100\n00:05:27.891 --> 00:05:32.593\nThey share information about\nnetworks that they know\n\n101\n00:05:32.593 --> 00:05:37.940\nby sending what's called\na link state advertisement.\n\n102\n00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.630\nAnd this advertisement, again,\n\n103\n00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.170\nit only contains information about\nnetworks that they know about.\n\n104\n00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:48.920\nAnd they gather other advertisements from\nother routers that are connected and\n\n105\n00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.220\nthey slowly build up a map but\n\n106\n00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:56.680\nthey really call it a tree of the network,\nwith themselves as the root.\n\n107\n00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.780\nSo, you can think of internally it's\nbuilding this map of how to get to\n\n108\n00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:06.000\nall these different networks from itself\nas the root of that tree, all right?\n\n109\n00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.240\nBut it doesn't use hop counts.\n\n110\n00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.460\nIt's using other things like bandwidth,\nfor example,\n\n111\n00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:19.600\navailability, to determine\nwhich is the best route.\n\n112\n00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.680\nSo we don't have that limitation\nof that 16-hop count,\n\n113\n00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.620\nwhich means I can now use it on much\nbigger networks, like the Internet.\n\n114\n00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:31.110\nSo good things about link state protocols,\nsmaller routing tables,\n\n115\n00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.330\nwhich means less replication, less data\nI have to share with other routers.\n\n116\n00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.030\nVery, very scalable,\nworks on large, large networks,\n\n117\n00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:44.840\nmuch more efficient use of network\nbandwidth because once we converge\n\n118\n00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.870\nwe don't have to share that information as\noften, and a must faster convergence time.\n\n119\n00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:55.660\nSo when change does occur, that change\nis propagated out much more efficiently.\n\n120\n00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:56.480\n&gt;&gt; Is there any negatives,\n\n121\n00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.340\nis there a downside?\n&gt;&gt; There are some downsides, and\n\n122\n00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.920\nreally, it's two big things.\n\n123\n00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.192\nOne is the additional processing\npower which, in today's routers,\n\n124\n00:07:05.192 --> 00:07:08.028\nwe're not as worried about, so\nit's not that big of a deal.\n\n125\n00:07:08.028 --> 00:07:12.456\nBut the configuration is much\nmore complex, setting this up, so\n\n126\n00:07:12.456 --> 00:07:15.200\nthere's a little bit of an issue there.\n\n127\n00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.410\nAll right so those again,\njust to sum that right up again,\n\n128\n00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.280\nwe've got two different\nclasses of routing protocols.\n\n129\n00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.720\nRouting protocols being the language\nthat our routers use to share\n\n130\n00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.835\ntheir information.\n\n131\n00:07:26.835 --> 00:07:30.390\nYou've got your distance vector,\nwhich is based on distance or\n\n132\n00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:33.620\nnumber of hops between source and\ndestination.\n\n133\n00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:34.830\nIt's got that big limit of 16 hops.\n\n134\n00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.410\nThen you've got your link state protocols,\n\n135\n00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:43.403\nlike open shortest path first,\nwhich use different vectors,\n\n136\n00:07:43.403 --> 00:07:48.883\nbandwidth being one of them that\ndetermines which is the best route.\n\n137\n00:07:48.883 --> 00:07:53.196\nIt doesn't have those same limitations\nthat we deal with with our distance vector\n\n138\n00:07:53.196 --> 00:07:54.303\nprotocols.\n&gt;&gt; Mike,\n\n139\n00:07:54.303 --> 00:07:58.087\nIs it possible that we could talk\nabout one of my favorite things?\n\n140\n00:07:58.087 --> 00:08:00.550\nI don't know why like I just do,\nhoney pots.\n\n141\n00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:01.240\n&gt;&gt; Honey pots,\n\n142\n00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.930\nwho doesn't like honey right?\n\n143\n00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.290\nI mean I grew up watching Winnie\nthe Pooh so we're always looking for\n\n144\n00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:07.600\nthat honey pot.\n\n145\n00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.672\nAnd hopefully that's what the bad guys\nare doing too is they're looking for\n\n146\n00:08:10.672 --> 00:08:11.344\nour honey pots.\n\n147\n00:08:11.344 --> 00:08:15.651\nBecause a honey pot is,\nthe name is kind of appropriate.\n\n148\n00:08:15.651 --> 00:08:22.801\nWe're gonna use it as a way to attract or\ndistract the bad guys, the bad actors\n\n149\n00:08:22.801 --> 00:08:28.030\nfrom the real assets on our network.\n&gt;&gt; It's like bait.\n\n150\n00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:30.830\n&gt;&gt; It's much like bait.\n\n151\n00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:34.010\nI hesitate sometimes to use\ncertain words whether because\n\n152\n00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:38.670\nthere is some debate that goes back and\nforward whether or not it's entrapment.\n\n153\n00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:41.200\nAnd we know that entrapment,\nyou know, is not a good thing,\n\n154\n00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.580\nbecause if I try to prosecute,\nthey can claim entrapment.\n\n155\n00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:44.840\nThey can get it thrown out.\n\n156\n00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:49.110\nBut that's for\nanother story in another ethics class.\n\n157\n00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.020\nHere we're just talking about what\nin the heck a honey pot is and\n\n158\n00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.330\nwhat we would use them for and\nthat is, like you were saying,\n\n159\n00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:59.650\nit is a way to distract the bad guys and,\nhopefully, draw them to it.\n\n160\n00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:01.590\nNow a honey pot sits on your network.\n\n161\n00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:06.200\nIt's usually either a physical machine or\nvirtual machine that looks like\n\n162\n00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.970\nany other machine on your network,\nbut it looks a little more vulnerable.\n\n163\n00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:14.030\nIt looks like easy pickings or\nthat low hanging fruit on your network.\n\n164\n00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:17.880\nSo if a bad guy gets into your network,\nthat's where he's gonna try to go first.\n\n165\n00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.850\nAnd the idea is depending,\nwe can set up honey pots for\n\n166\n00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:23.770\na couple of different reasons.\n\n167\n00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:25.190\nIf you're in a corporate environment and\n\n168\n00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:30.490\nI'm trying to do what I just described\nthen the idea is they hit the honey pot.\n\n169\n00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:31.970\nThey set off alarms.\n\n170\n00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:35.760\nI can detect this, maybe capture some\ninformation about their attack, but\n\n171\n00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:41.060\nprimarily detect the attack, do something\nto stop it before they make it to real\n\n172\n00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.460\ninformation in real resources, right?\n\n173\n00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:47.560\nWe would load the honey pot up with\nfake data, fake credit card numbers,\n\n174\n00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.170\nfake health care information,\nyou know, whatever our business is.\n\n175\n00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:52.310\nBecause we don't want to\nmake it look too obvious,\n\n176\n00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:55.370\nlike it's just a silly server sitting\nthere that's vulnerable with nothing on\n\n177\n00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:57.280\nit, they would know what that was.\n\n178\n00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.830\nSo we loaded up with fake data.\n\n179\n00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:02.290\nWe make it look a little bit vulnerable,\nbut not too vulnerable.\n\n180\n00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:03.940\nSo it's not obvious, right?\n\n181\n00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.880\nAnd then they attack that and\nwe set off alarms.\n\n182\n00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.960\nWe can stop the attack,\nbefore they damage any of our actual data.\n\n183\n00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.890\nOther reasons though that we've\nused honey pots is for research.\n\n184\n00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:18.730\nA research honey pot is set up with the\nintention of attracting the bad actors,\n\n185\n00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.380\nbut not stopping them.\n\n186\n00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:24.010\nCapturing information about everything\nthey're doing, where they're coming from,\n\n187\n00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:28.050\nwhat techniques they're using, how they're\ngoing about doing what it is they do, so\n\n188\n00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.690\nwe can learn from it, and\nwe can better defend our networks.\n\n189\n00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:33.820\nWe can develop ways to stop these attacks,\nright?\n\n190\n00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.550\nBy seeing, because, how do we know\nwhat their next attack is gonna be,\n\n191\n00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:38.950\nwe can watch them practice\ntheir techniques or\n\n192\n00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:41.910\ntry new tools out,\nwithout using these research honey pots.\n\n193\n00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:45.260\nSo these guys,\nmuch more complex to set up, but\n\n194\n00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:49.450\nthey are loaded to the gills\nwith monitoring software.\n\n195\n00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:52.520\nSo they will capture just about everything\nthat's going on so we can go back and\n\n196\n00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.300\ndo research on it, all right?\n\n197\n00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.720\nThere's also a couple other terms I wanna\nmake sure we're familiar with honey pots.\n\n198\n00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:00.170\nThere's also something.\n\n199\n00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:04.760\nThere's a honey net, which is basically\nan entire network that's virtualized or\n\n200\n00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:09.250\nis fictitious or\nbait as you like to say there.\n\n201\n00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:13.040\nSo instead of just one server,\nsitting there looking like bait,\n\n202\n00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.960\nI might have an entire subnet that looks\nlike bait with some client computers and\n\n203\n00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:21.160\nthe whole nine, but again it's\nall just trying to distract them\n\n204\n00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.703\nfrom the real resources.\n&gt;&gt; So another question would be can you\n\n205\n00:11:24.703 --> 00:11:29.001\nset up the honeypots so that when\nthe bad actors actually infiltrate it,\n\n206\n00:11:29.001 --> 00:11:32.323\nthey go back home to their net\nwith a virus or something.\n\n207\n00:11:32.323 --> 00:11:33.144\n&gt;&gt; You can,\n\n208\n00:11:33.144 --> 00:11:38.700\nthat's another highly debated topic,\nthe old hack back idea.\n\n209\n00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.650\nHey I wanna get information\nabout these guys so\n\n210\n00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:44.880\nI can hack back and\nthere's lots of problems with that.\n\n211\n00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:49.850\nThere's legal issues that we have to deal\nwith, there's just time and resources,\n\n212\n00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:51.765\nand it's almost like poking the bear.\n\n213\n00:11:51.765 --> 00:11:55.445\n[CROSSTALK] You really don't want to.\n\n214\n00:11:55.445 --> 00:11:59.615\nI mean I know you get angry and you want\nto go after these guys that are doing this\n\n215\n00:11:59.615 --> 00:12:04.000\nto you and show them what it feels like,\nbut odds are they've got much more time.\n\n216\n00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:10.005\nAnd they've got some skills that we might\nnot have because they are doing this all\n\n217\n00:12:10.005 --> 00:12:13.745\nthe time, they've got friends they\ncan be even better than them and\n\n218\n00:12:13.745 --> 00:12:17.015\nyou really don't want to\nstir that pot typically.\n\n219\n00:12:17.015 --> 00:12:20.090\nSo the whole hack back\nthing is usually not\n\n220\n00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:21.860\na good idea from the corporate standpoint.\n\n221\n00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:26.800\nThere is some debate whether or\nnot countries, nation states, should\n\n222\n00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.053\nstart doing the whole hack back thing.\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n223\n00:12:29.053 --> 00:12:29.780\n&gt;&gt; But again,\n\n224\n00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:32.615\nthat's another story for another class.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n225\n00:12:32.615 --> 00:12:33.480\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n226\n00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.820\nwe know what honey pots are now.\n\n227\n00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:41.790\nNext on our list is going to be\nsomething known as perimeter\n\n228\n00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:46.690\nnetworks, all right.\n&gt;&gt; Perimeter networking means like a DMZ?\n\n229\n00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:48.400\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, I like it, man,\n\n230\n00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.013\nyou are god, you are on the ball today.\n&gt;&gt; I've been around here a little while.\n\n231\n00:12:51.013 --> 00:12:51.529\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n232\n00:12:51.529 --> 00:12:54.890\na DMZ is another name for\na perimeter network.\n\n233\n00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:59.650\nYou might hear it termed\nperimeter network, screen subnet,\n\n234\n00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:02.630\nDMZ, they're really all\nreferring to the same thing.\n\n235\n00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:06.320\nDMZ being short for\ndemilitarized zone right?\n\n236\n00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:10.120\nAnd I know when we hear that term\nwe think of the old war movies and\n\n237\n00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:14.100\nthat barbed wired, and that area that\nnobody went between the opposing forces\n\n238\n00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:18.510\nlike the dead men zone there or something,\nthat was our demilitarized zone.\n\n239\n00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:21.430\nAnd that's kind of what we're\ndoing here in our networks.\n\n240\n00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:24.750\nIt's similar in concept, all right?\n\n241\n00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:27.830\nThe idea is that I've got\nmy corporate network.\n\n242\n00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:31.130\nAnd my corporate network is\nwhere all my resources are.\n\n243\n00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:32.820\nAnd I wanna keep it safe and protected.\n\n244\n00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.170\nRight, we put firewalls out there.\n\n245\n00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:36.070\nWe've got our moat up if you will.\n\n246\n00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:40.010\nBut then just on the other side of that is\nthe Internet where all the bad people are,\n\n247\n00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:44.780\nthe bad actors, all the threats and things\nlike that right up against our network.\n\n248\n00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:50.396\nSo what if we put a little buffer between\nour corporate network and the Internet?\n\n249\n00:13:50.396 --> 00:13:53.043\nThat's a screen subnet, that's a DMZ,\n\n250\n00:13:53.043 --> 00:13:56.152\nthat's that space kind\nof in between those two.\n\n251\n00:13:56.152 --> 00:13:59.810\nAnd so now what we end up with is\na situation where I've got my corporate\n\n252\n00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:04.212\nnetwork, which is highly protected very\nsecure, nobody's allowed to come in from\n\n253\n00:14:04.212 --> 00:14:07.380\nthe outside without good\nstrong authentication.\n\n254\n00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:09.620\nAnd then we've got our DMZ,\n\n255\n00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:13.960\nwhere I can put some things that\nshould accessed by the public, right?\n\n256\n00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:18.020\nLike, if I'm an e-commerce site, I have to\nset up a web server so that the public,\n\n257\n00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.700\npeople I don't know I'm not gonna\nlimit it just to people I know,\n\n258\n00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.830\nI want anybody in the world\nto come buy my product.\n\n259\n00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:23.900\nI wanna be rich.\n\n260\n00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.980\nSo I put this web server out there and\nit can't be in my corporate subnet.\n\n261\n00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:30.210\nI can't allow public access,\nInto my corporate network.\n\n262\n00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:33.990\nSo we put the web server out in the DMZ,\nthe DMZ's outside my\n\n263\n00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:38.550\nhighly secured network but\nit's in a medium security portion, right?\n\n264\n00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.550\nIt's not as secure as my\ncorporate network, but\n\n265\n00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:44.288\nit's also not just out on\nthe Internet with no security at all.\n\n266\n00:14:44.288 --> 00:14:46.366\nThat's that DMZ, right?\n\n267\n00:14:46.366 --> 00:14:50.250\nNow DMZs can be set up in\na couple of different ways.\n\n268\n00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:55.660\nIt could be what some books\ncall a sandwiched subnet.\n\n269\n00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.140\nI've never heard that term before.\n\n270\n00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:59.770\nI was reading that the other day,\nit's kinda interesting.\n\n271\n00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:02.050\nBut the idea is, there are two firewalls.\n\n272\n00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:04.410\nRight, and if you can imagine on this.\n\n273\n00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:08.380\nYou know what, I'm gonna draw this up for\nyou guys real quick.\n\n274\n00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:10.130\nGive me one second there, Titus.\n\n275\n00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:14.080\nLet me pull up a new tab real quick, and\n\n276\n00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:20.010\nwe're just gonna try to draw this real\nquick, on the fly drawing, if you will.\n\n277\n00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:20.770\nOkay, you can pull me up.\n\n278\n00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:28.270\nSo let's say that we have our\ncorporate subnet back here,\n\n279\n00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:33.420\nright, and this is where all\nof my client machines are.\n\n280\n00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:37.040\nThis is where my file servers and\nmy domain controllers and\n\n281\n00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.800\nall that good stuff is right, and\nback here, my corporate subnet.\n\n282\n00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:44.360\nThen we've got our firewall\nthat sits in between, or\n\n283\n00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.400\nright there at the edge of my\ncorporate network, all right.\n\n284\n00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.771\nThen we're gonna take another firewall.\n\n285\n00:15:49.771 --> 00:15:53.128\nAnd actually just let me do it this way.\n\n286\n00:15:53.128 --> 00:15:55.051\nWe'll take another firewall.\n\n287\n00:15:55.051 --> 00:16:00.534\nAnd put it here, and then out here is,\nif we can get this guy to play along,\n\n288\n00:16:00.534 --> 00:16:06.350\nthe Internet, right, with all the bad\nactors and all that good stuff.\n\n289\n00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:11.020\nAnd then this area between the two\nfirewalls, this is my screen subnet,\n\n290\n00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.990\nthis is my DMZ, right?\n\n291\n00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:20.280\nSo in here I put my web server or\nwe put our mail relay server.\n\n292\n00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:27.570\nSo to get from the Internet to\none of those resources there.\n\n293\n00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:31.570\nAnd let's do a little arrow there,\nsure I wanna make it look good right?\n\n294\n00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:34.302\nTo get to there,\nthis firewall's a little lax.\n\n295\n00:16:34.302 --> 00:16:37.880\nIt's gonna allow some anonymous\naccess like to my web server and\n\n296\n00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:38.960\nthings like that.\n\n297\n00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.740\nBut very few things are allowed to go,\n\n298\n00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:47.560\nlet's see if I can do this here,\nfrom here back into here, right?\n\n299\n00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.330\nThis is highly controlled.\n\n300\n00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:52.820\nOnly my email server's allowed\nto come back through here or\n\n301\n00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:56.060\nmy VPN server is allowed\nto come back through here.\n\n302\n00:16:56.060 --> 00:17:01.420\nSo this is that demilitarized zone,\nscreen subnet that we can\n\n303\n00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:05.980\nput our resources that need less security\nthan our corporate network, all right?\n\n304\n00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:07.500\n&gt;&gt; So the term sandwich DMZ,\n\n305\n00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.660\nthat makes sense.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now it does, right?\n\n306\n00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:13.280\nNow when you say sandwich network, yeah,\nthere we go, or sandwich DMZ, yep.\n\n307\n00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.530\nNow this is not the only\nway you can do it.\n\n308\n00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:18.520\nThere's another way we can set up a DMZ.\n\n309\n00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:24.400\nWe can do it with a single firewall.\n\n310\n00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.890\nWe can take a firewall that\nhas multiple interfaces and\n\n311\n00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:31.030\nwe can setup something like this\nwhere we've got a connection here,\n\n312\n00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.210\nwe've got a connection here, and\nwe've got a connection here.\n\n313\n00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:40.030\nAnd I know this guy's actually\npointing maybe the wrong way.\n\n314\n00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:41.260\nSo let's do that one more time.\n\n315\n00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.460\nI've got a connection that comes in here.\n\n316\n00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:44.160\nAnd so in this case,\n\n317\n00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.760\nwell actually these should be\nbidirectional arrows at this point.\n\n318\n00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.760\nBut my drawing tool's not playing along.\n\n319\n00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.210\nSo this will be the same thing.\n\n320\n00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:54.229\nThis down here we should put\na little circle around there.\n\n321\n00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.640\nSo let's do that.\n\n322\n00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:02.640\nThis down here would be my DMZ, right.\n\n323\n00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:06.630\nSo now, as traffic comes in it can but\nthe firewall is gonna decide,\n\n324\n00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:09.805\nare you are you allowed to\naccess the corporate network or\n\n325\n00:18:09.805 --> 00:18:14.405\nwe gonna push you out to the DMZ to get\nto those publicly available resources.\n\n326\n00:18:14.405 --> 00:18:17.285\nSo, there's hardware involved\nin something like this but\n\n327\n00:18:17.285 --> 00:18:19.635\nthere is a downside to\nsetting it up like this.\n\n328\n00:18:19.635 --> 00:18:23.225\nIf the firewall becomes compromised,\nright,\n\n329\n00:18:23.225 --> 00:18:29.680\nnow they can go straight through all the\nway to my corporate network, all right.\n\n330\n00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:33.470\nSo that becomes a little bit of a weakness\nof a system like this, where is anyone has\n\n331\n00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:39.558\nthat same issue if we go back to\nwhere we had the sandwiched, right?\n\n332\n00:18:39.558 --> 00:18:43.750\nThey compromised this firewall, they have\nstill made it into my DMZ, which was\n\n333\n00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:47.990\nprobably allowing them to anyway, and they\nhave got to break through this firewall\n\n334\n00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:51.420\nand then this firewall before they ever\ngonna get to my corporate network.\n\n335\n00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.290\nAnd this firewall is very\ntightly controlled and\n\n336\n00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:57.290\nmonitored to watch for\nany attacks like that.\n\n337\n00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:00.550\nSo that's what a DMZ is all about.\n\n338\n00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:03.655\nIt's an area of our network that\nwe're gonna reduce the security on,\n\n339\n00:19:03.655 --> 00:19:06.495\nit's like a buffer between us and\nthe Internet.\n\n340\n00:19:06.495 --> 00:19:10.255\nIt's where I put any type of\nresources that need public access,\n\n341\n00:19:10.255 --> 00:19:14.815\nlike my web servers, proxy servers,\nreverse proxy servers,\n\n342\n00:19:14.815 --> 00:19:18.740\nmail relay servers, things like that.\n&gt;&gt; Mike, leads me to this.\n\n343\n00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:19.815\nWhat is NAT?\n\n344\n00:19:19.815 --> 00:19:20.650\nN-A-T?\n\n345\n00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:22.460\nWhat is that?\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad you spelled it cuz I\n\n346\n00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:26.188\nwas gonna say that annoying\nlittle fly that comes around and.\n\n347\n00:19:26.188 --> 00:19:28.473\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's not what you think.\n\n348\n00:19:28.473 --> 00:19:29.636\n&gt;&gt; NAT is an acronym for\n\n349\n00:19:29.636 --> 00:19:31.970\nnetwork address translation, right.\n\n350\n00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:36.240\nAnd network address translation, this\nkind of again goes back to some of our\n\n351\n00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.940\nbasic networking concepts that we wanna\nrefresh on and make sure we're ready for\n\n352\n00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:40.500\nthis exam.\n\n353\n00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.300\nAnd it also is part of network isolation,\n\n354\n00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:46.620\nit's how we can Isolate certain\nportions of our network.\n\n355\n00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:51.190\nNow we can go into the history of IPv4 and\naddress depletion and\n\n356\n00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:54.900\nall of that stuff and if you want\nwe got great shows in our library\n\n357\n00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:59.528\nthat cover that information if you want a\nlittle more in-depth knowledge about that.\n\n358\n00:19:59.528 --> 00:20:03.120\nWhat I'm gonna go ahead and do,\nis just jump to the fact that NAT\n\n359\n00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:07.720\ncame about because we were\nrunning out of IPv4 addresses.\n\n360\n00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:10.750\nIt was a way to extend the life of IPv4.\n\n361\n00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:14.700\nAnd what it did was it allowed me,\nremember with IPv4,\n\n362\n00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:21.430\nthere are certain ranges of addresses that\nare not allowed to traverse the Internet.\n\n363\n00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:23.370\nThey're called private addresses.\n\n364\n00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:25.610\nThey're not publicly routable, right.\n\n365\n00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:27.090\nThere's a range within class A.\n\n366\n00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:31.549\nAnything starts with a ten,\nthere's a range within class B,\n\n367\n00:20:31.549 --> 00:20:35.780\n19216, I'm sorry 172.16 to 172.31.\n\n368\n00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.606\nWithin class c it's 192.168.0.0.\n\n369\n00:20:38.606 --> 00:20:43.110\nSo there's these ranges of private\naddresses that we can use internally but\n\n370\n00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:44.670\nthey will not go out to the Internet.\n\n371\n00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:48.530\nIf a router, a border router receives\na packet that's destined for\n\n372\n00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:52.630\nthe Internet and the source address\nis within one of those private ranges\n\n373\n00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:54.930\nIt drops it, says you can't go\nout to the Internet with that.\n\n374\n00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:57.630\nThat allows me to use those\naddresses internally and\n\n375\n00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:59.650\nnot worry about conflicting\nwith anybody else.\n\n376\n00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:02.540\nBecause it's never going to go out\nto the world where it might conflict\n\n377\n00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:07.020\nwith somebody else, it's kept internal,\nhence the name private addresses.\n\n378\n00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:09.860\nBut I still wanna get to the Internet,\nright?\n\n379\n00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:13.860\nI've got all these users on my corporate\noffice that are sitting there at\n\n380\n00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:14.720\ncomputers.\n\n381\n00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.800\nThey log on private IP addresses.\n\n382\n00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.950\nBut a lot of the stuff they need to do\ntheir job is out on the web whether that's\n\n383\n00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:23.780\nconnecting to some resource or\na business partner's network or\n\n384\n00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:28.770\nwhatever the case may be, another branch\noffice sending emails, all that stuff.\n\n385\n00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:31.530\nWe need a connection to the outside.\n\n386\n00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:38.800\nSo NAT, network address translation,\nis a set of protocols that allows me to\n\n387\n00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:45.070\ntemporarily turn that private IP address\ninto a publicly routable IP address.\n\n388\n00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:49.840\nTypically it's provided by your border\nrouter, might be your NAT device,\n\n389\n00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.950\nyou might have a server that's\nproviding network address translation.\n\n390\n00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:56.840\nCould be doing other things like\nproxy server, things like that.\n\n391\n00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:57.700\nThat's what it does.\n\n392\n00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:02.360\nWhat basically happens, in the short\nversion here, is that as that NAT,\n\n393\n00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.640\ndevice the one that's performing\nnetwork address translation.\n\n394\n00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:09.462\nWhen your packet comes to it and it says\nyou can't go out of the Internet with\n\n395\n00:22:09.462 --> 00:22:11.659\na private IP address what are you, crazy?\n\n396\n00:22:11.659 --> 00:22:16.186\nIt's gonna take your IP address off the\npacket for just a second and it's gonna\n\n397\n00:22:16.186 --> 00:22:20.300\nput it a side and it's gonna take\na public IP address that is routable and\n\n398\n00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:25.480\nput it in his place and allow that packet\ngo out to the Internet just like normal.\n\n399\n00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.750\nThat packet is gonna come back\nto that public IP address,\n\n400\n00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:31.990\nwhich is the network\naddress translation device.\n\n401\n00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:34.160\nHe gets it back and he says what is this?\n\n402\n00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.760\nThat was the packet tried to go or\n\n403\n00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:39.180\nthe webpage that you tried to go\nget with our private IP address.\n\n404\n00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.760\nTakes the public IP address off.\n\n405\n00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:46.270\nPuts your private IP address back on and\nallows it to go back, right?\n\n406\n00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:50.300\nSo it's translating your address\nfrom private to public temporarily\n\n407\n00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.840\nwhile it goes out to the Internet, okay?\n\n408\n00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:56.500\nNow there's two methods we can\ndo network translation with.\n\n409\n00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:59.280\nThere's static and there's dynamic.\n\n410\n00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:04.680\nIn a static NAT, there's gonna be\nbasically a one-to-one mapping.\n\n411\n00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:08.870\nFor every device that needs to go out to\nthe Internet that currently has a private\n\n412\n00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:12.270\nIP address, I'm gonna have\na public IP address set aside.\n\n413\n00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:14.810\nAnd so when it tries to go out,\nI'm gonna take it off.\n\n414\n00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:19.110\nAnd wait, you're, this is your public IP\naddress and put it on, let's it go out.\n\n415\n00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:23.140\nSo every device that needs to\nget out is gonna have a reserved\n\n416\n00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:26.060\npublic IP address that it can use\ntemporarily while it goes out.\n\n417\n00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:27.640\nThat's static NAT.\n\n418\n00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.860\nAnd you might think,\n\n419\n00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:33.920\nwell why not just give that guy\na public address in the first place.\n\n420\n00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.990\nBecause we want to hide\nit from the Internet,\n\n421\n00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:38.920\nwe don't want them to see\nthe address of that machine.\n\n422\n00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:43.513\nSo if you've got a resource that\nneeds access from the outside, but\n\n423\n00:23:43.513 --> 00:23:47.637\nit has a private IP address,\nthen you can use the static NAT.\n\n424\n00:23:47.637 --> 00:23:52.443\nDynamic NAT is when the hosts that\nare trying to get to the outside\n\n425\n00:23:52.443 --> 00:23:55.558\ndon't need The same address every time.\n\n426\n00:23:55.558 --> 00:23:59.912\nLike my laptop, nobody out there on the\nInternet is trying to connect to my laptop\n\n427\n00:23:59.912 --> 00:24:04.280\nor at least legitimately, should be\ntrying to connect to my laptop, right?\n\n428\n00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:08.560\nSo I don't need a public IP address,\na permanent address assigned to my device.\n\n429\n00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.180\nI've got a private IP address.\n\n430\n00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:16.040\nWhen I go out to the Internet thNAT device\njust takes the next address in the pool.\n\n431\n00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.290\nIt doesn't have to look and say, wait,\n\n432\n00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:19.590\nif you're going out this is\nthe one that's reserved for you.\n\n433\n00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:21.410\nIt's just gets the next one in\nthe pool and says, all right,\n\n434\n00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:24.360\nI'm gonna take your IP address off, I'm\ngonna take the next one that's available,\n\n435\n00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.990\nthrow it on there, let it go out.\n\n436\n00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:30.000\nIt comes back, swap them back and\nnow that packet can go back to you.\n\n437\n00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000\nDoesn't matter which public\nIP address it gives me,\n\n438\n00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.360\nbecause nobody from the outside\nis trying to reach me.\n\n439\n00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.970\nSo if I use a different public IP address\nthe next time, doesn't matter, right?\n\n440\n00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:40.950\nBecause nobody, again,\nis trying to reach me.\n\n441\n00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:44.980\nSo that is dynamic network\naddress translation.\n\n442\n00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:48.570\nJust about everybody runs\nnetwork address translation.\n\n443\n00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:53.610\nEven if you have a limited\nnumber of nodes,\n\n444\n00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:57.990\nit's so much easier to work with and it\ngives us a little bit of security, right?\n\n445\n00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:02.450\nBecause think about that,\nwhen my packet leaves my network and\n\n446\n00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:05.490\nit goes out to that web page\nthat I'm trying to get to,\n\n447\n00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:10.100\nmy address is removed and\na temporary public address is put on.\n\n448\n00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:14.350\nSo if a bad guy intercepts that packet,\nhe's not gonna learn anything\n\n449\n00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:18.520\nabout my internal networking scheme,\nbecause my IP address is not on there.\n\n450\n00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:22.680\nSo we do get a little bit\nof security by obfuscating\n\n451\n00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.610\nmy internal IP addressing scheme, right?\n\n452\n00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:29.650\nBut that can also cause problems\n\n453\n00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:34.752\nwith something like IPsec which\nwe haven't talked about yet.\n\n454\n00:25:34.752 --> 00:25:38.840\nBut IPsec can end up,\ndepending on how we set it up,\n\n455\n00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:42.970\ncan digitally sign the packets,\nwhich is a way to provide integrity.\n\n456\n00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:46.730\nWhich means if anything changes,\nit'll no longer meet the integrity and\n\n457\n00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:47.930\nthe packet will be dropped.\n\n458\n00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:50.030\nWait a second Mike.\n\n459\n00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:53.260\nDidn't you just say the NAV device\nwas gonna take my IP address off and\n\n460\n00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:54.600\nput a public one on?\n\n461\n00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:59.110\nDoesn't that mean the header has change\nand it will no longer match the signature?\n\n462\n00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:00.050\nYes, it does.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n463\n00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:01.920\n&gt;&gt; And so what'll happen is it won't work.\n\n464\n00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:06.200\nYour packet won't ever go, cuz it's\ngoing to fail the integrity check and\n\n465\n00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:11.430\ndrop the packet, so initially IPsec and\nNAT did not play along at all.\n\n466\n00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:15.780\nWe'll talk about in a little bit,\nhow they fixed some of that\n\n467\n00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:19.325\nwith IPsec, right?\n&gt;&gt; Do we have enough time to go into\n\n468\n00:26:19.325 --> 00:26:22.120\nsomething else you think?\n&gt;&gt; You know what, let's go ahead and\n\n469\n00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:25.330\ndefine a VPN and then we'll stop there,\nbefore we get in IPsec,\n\n470\n00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:27.990\ncuz that will be a lengthy\nconversation there.\n\n471\n00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:31.715\nSo the last thing we'll talk about\nin this episode would be a VPN or\n\n472\n00:26:31.715 --> 00:26:33.768\na Virtual Private Network, okay.\n\n473\n00:26:33.768 --> 00:26:38.580\nVPN, short for Virtual Private Network\nis a way that I can protect\n\n474\n00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:43.407\nmy data as it travels across\npublic infrastructure, all right?\n\n475\n00:26:43.407 --> 00:26:46.407\nLet's look at this way, you've got your\ncorporate office sitting there and\n\n476\n00:26:46.407 --> 00:26:48.010\nit's connect to the Internet.\n\n477\n00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:51.910\nYou're at home or you're at a hotel and\nyou're connected to the Internet.\n\n478\n00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:54.556\nAnd the Internet is just one big,\nfat mesh network.\n\n479\n00:26:54.556 --> 00:26:55.770\nSo, if your a corporate office and\n\n480\n00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:59.200\nyou are both connected to this\nmesh network, doesn't it seem like\n\n481\n00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.340\nyou should be able to connect to\nyour work network from your hotel?\n\n482\n00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:03.720\nAnd the answer is yes, you can.\n\n483\n00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.037\nAbsolutely or from home or\nfrom wherever you are,\n\n484\n00:27:06.037 --> 00:27:07.867\nif you're connected to the Internet.\n\n485\n00:27:07.867 --> 00:27:11.482\nGreat, well great, but\nnot so great, right?\n\n486\n00:27:11.482 --> 00:27:13.280\nThere's an issue we gotta deal with.\n\n487\n00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:18.940\nRemember, between me and my corporate\nnetwork is this Internet and who-\n\n488\n00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:19.820\n&gt;&gt; Bad actors.\n\n489\n00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:21.089\n&gt;&gt; Yes, lots of bad actors,\n\n490\n00:27:21.089 --> 00:27:23.585\nlots of threats out there\nthat we have to deal with.\n\n491\n00:27:23.585 --> 00:27:26.977\nLots of people trying to see my data and\ncapture my information and\n\n492\n00:27:26.977 --> 00:27:28.740\ndo no who knows what with?\n\n493\n00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:33.110\nSo before I just go send my data across\nthe Internet to get to work network,\n\n494\n00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:34.520\nI need to protect it.\n\n495\n00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:38.980\nAnd that's what VPNs do,\nthey create a virtual private network.\n\n496\n00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:41.298\nIt's not a private network,\nit's the Internet, it's public.\n\n497\n00:27:41.298 --> 00:27:45.880\nBut we're gonna create what we like to\nrefer to as a tunnel through the Internet,\n\n498\n00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:48.140\nthat my traffic can travel through and\n\n499\n00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:51.260\nnobody can get to because\nthe tunnel is protecting it.\n\n500\n00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:54.340\nNow we obviously don't go out and\nlay tunnels down or anything like that.\n\n501\n00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:57.880\nBut we use protocols that\nwill wrap up our packets\n\n502\n00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.700\nin a way that the outside\nworld can't get to them.\n\n503\n00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:04.030\nThey might see them go by, but they\ncan't get inside them to figure out what\n\n504\n00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:07.870\nthey are and that is what VPNs or\nvirtual private networks are all about.\n\n505\n00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:11.040\nAnd there's really three big use cases for\nVPNs.\n\n506\n00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.820\nYou're usually talking about\na branch office connecting back to\n\n507\n00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:15.140\na corporate office.\n\n508\n00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.060\nA remote user being at home or\nthe hotel or\n\n509\n00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:20.660\nwhatever, connecting back\nto the corporate office.\n\n510\n00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:25.190\nOr a business partner, giving a business\npartner remote access to resources on your\n\n511\n00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:28.470\nnetwork, like web apps to order product or\n\n512\n00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:30.650\ncheck on the status of an order or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n513\n00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:33.780\nAnd we'll talk about those\nmore when we come back.\n\n514\n00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:35.320\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there's gonna be a part three.\n\n515\n00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:36.715\n&gt;&gt; Surprise, surprise.\n\n516\n00:28:36.715 --> 00:28:38.070\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Network isolation.\n\n517\n00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:40.420\nBut you know you want it and\nit's great information.\n\n518\n00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:42.770\nAnd can you just wrap up real\nquick what we just discussed?\n\n519\n00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:43.981\n&gt;&gt; I forgot everything we just\n\n520\n00:28:43.981 --> 00:28:44.670\ntalked about.\n\n521\n00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:45.430\nLet me go back and look.\n\n522\n00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:49.120\nSo we talked about, we finished up\ntalking about distance vector and\n\n523\n00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:52.090\nsome of the weaknesses there,\nrouting loops, count to infinity.\n\n524\n00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:53.500\nWe also talked about link state,\n\n525\n00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.860\na different class of routing protocols\nthat work in a different way and\n\n526\n00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:59.960\navoid some of the issues we\nhave with our distance vectors.\n\n527\n00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.740\nWe talked about what a honey pot was.\n\n528\n00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.620\nWe talked about perimeter networks and\n\n529\n00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:08.610\nhow we can do them with a sandwich\ntype situation with two firewalls and\n\n530\n00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:14.330\na DMZ in between or a single firewall\nwith multiple interfaces to set that up.\n\n531\n00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:16.850\nAnd then we talked about\nnetwork address translation.\n\n532\n00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:17.410\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n533\n00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:18.940\n&gt;&gt; And we wrapped it up with VPNs.\n\n534\n00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:20.120\n&gt;&gt; That's right, wonderful job\n\n535\n00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:24.270\nas usual Mike, fantastic, can't wait for\npart three of network isolation.\n\n536\n00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:26.740\nAnd you're watching MTA,\nSecurity Fundamentals.\n\n537\n00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:30.160\nThere's a whole bunch in this series,\nso catch them all in the library.\n\n538\n00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.840\nAnd you have access to that\nbecause you're an IT pro.\n\n539\n00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:36.290\nAnd did you know that an IT pro,\na good IT pro is always learning.\n\n540\n00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:38.090\nI'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n541\n00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:39.006\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n542\n00:29:39.006 --> 00:29:46.691\n[MUSIC]\n\n543\n00:29:46.691 --> 00:29:49.248\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Hello again, and thank you for choosing\nITPRO.TV, your intelligent choice,\n\n4\n00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.450\nwhere we are helping you\nlearn wherever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.400\nI'm your host Zach Memos, as we continue\non with MTA Security Fundamentals.\n\n6\n00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.570\nThis is part three of network isolation.\n\n7\n00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.280\nAnd who's bringing this information?\n\n8\n00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.525\nThis smart guy right there.\n\n9\n00:00:29.525 --> 00:00:30.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And Mike Rodrick,\n\n10\n00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:31.590\ngood to see you again, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.310\nPart three.\n\n12\n00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.030\n&gt;&gt; Part three, I know, it's another\none of those darn miniseries, right?\n\n13\n00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I'm getting good at this.\n\n14\n00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.990\n&gt;&gt; I love them, a lot.\n\n15\n00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.920\n&gt;&gt; All right, but\n\n16\n00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.500\nyeah, there's a lot of information\nwhen it comes to network isolation.\n\n17\n00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.190\nSo we left of Zach talking about VPNs and\n\n18\n00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.140\nnow what we're gonna do is talk about\na couple of the different protocols or\n\n19\n00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.730\nways we can create VPNs, or\nat least the ones they call on the exam.\n\n20\n00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.670\nCuz there are several out there.\n\n21\n00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.495\nBut for this one-\n&gt;&gt; IPsec.\n\n22\n00:00:56.495 --> 00:00:58.560\n&gt;&gt; IPsec it is, that's where we'll start.\n\n23\n00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.850\nWe had a couple to choose from.\n\n24\n00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.087\nAccess IPsec that's where\nwe'll go first then.\n\n25\n00:01:02.087 --> 00:01:02.623\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n26\n00:01:02.623 --> 00:01:07.385\n&gt;&gt; So IPsec is actually protocol suite,\nIPsec is short for\n\n27\n00:01:07.385 --> 00:01:14.390\nIP security which is really short for\nstill for Internet Protocol security.\n\n28\n00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.100\nIt is a way to add security\nto Internet protocol.\n\n29\n00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.207\nThat protocol we use to send packets\nback and forth on the Internet,\n\n30\n00:01:22.207 --> 00:01:24.490\nwe're on a TCP/IP based network.\n\n31\n00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.710\nI should say not necessarily the Internet.\n\n32\n00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.100\nSo it is a set of standards.\n\n33\n00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.810\nAnd it is a suite.\n\n34\n00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.590\nIn other words, there is more than\none protocol, it's not just a single\n\n35\n00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.230\nset of rules but as long as we know it's\na suite I think we are good enough there.\n\n36\n00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.630\nBut again,\nway to secure IP communications.\n\n37\n00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.220\nOther important thing we\nwant to know about this,\n\n38\n00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.718\nis it operates at layer\n3 of our OSI model.\n\n39\n00:01:45.718 --> 00:01:48.130\nAnd I might think well,\nwhy is that important?\n\n40\n00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.640\nI'll tell you why it's important because\nit's operating way down on the OSI model.\n\n41\n00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.290\nRemember your OSI model all people\nseem to need delicious pizza.\n\n42\n00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.590\nIf I have to translate that\nout application layer,\n\n43\n00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.470\npresentation layer, session, transport,\nnetwork, data link, physical.\n\n44\n00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.290\nIf I didn't skip any of those\nthere it should of been seven.\n\n45\n00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.870\nWe're way down on layer three,\nwe're at the network layer.\n\n46\n00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.282\nHave to double check myself there\ndo my little acronym real quick.\n\n47\n00:02:17.282 --> 00:02:18.590\nWith IPsec,\n\n48\n00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.566\nthe reason that's advantageous is my\napplications are up here at layer seven.\n\n49\n00:02:22.566 --> 00:02:27.000\nAt my application layer, my presentation\nlayer what this means to us\n\n50\n00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.230\nis that IPsec can be used with\njust about any application.\n\n51\n00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.325\nThe application doesn't have\nto understand IPsec, so\n\n52\n00:02:35.325 --> 00:02:38.469\nit makes it a very\nconvenient thing to use.\n\n53\n00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:41.631\nBecause by the time the traffic gets\ndown to IPsec it takes care of it,\n\n54\n00:02:41.631 --> 00:02:44.694\nit protects it it travels across\na network it gets to the other end.\n\n55\n00:02:44.694 --> 00:02:46.755\nIt goes back up the OSI model,\n\n56\n00:02:46.755 --> 00:02:51.360\nthe IPsec's removed well before\nthe application gets the data.\n\n57\n00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.220\nSo the application doesn't have to\nbe aware, which is a good thing.\n\n58\n00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.600\nLike with, say, SSL,\nthis occurs in your browser.\n\n59\n00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.950\nSo the application itself has to be\ncoded to understand how to work SSL.\n\n60\n00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.660\nNow with IPsec that's not the case.\n\n61\n00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.410\nIPsec is actually now a part of IPv6.\n\n62\n00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.110\nIt was an add-on for IPv4.\n\n63\n00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.690\nWith IPv4 security, when IPv4,\nif I can slow down a little bit,\n\n64\n00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.230\nwas developed, security was not\nat the forefront like it is now.\n\n65\n00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.460\nIt wasn't our top concern because\nof our smaller isolated networks.\n\n66\n00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.090\nDidn't have thought the Internet and\nthe World Wide Web as we see it today.\n\n67\n00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.400\nSo, as the World Wide Web and\nthe Internet came out and\n\n68\n00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.995\nwe saw our security issues,\nIPsec was kind of bolted on to IPv4.\n\n69\n00:03:40.995 --> 00:03:46.185\nSo it worked but add-ons never work as\nwell as if you design it from the ground\n\n70\n00:03:46.185 --> 00:03:49.795\nup with this built in and\nthat is the way IPv6 is.\n\n71\n00:03:49.795 --> 00:03:51.561\nBut back to what we want to talk about,\nand\n\n72\n00:03:51.561 --> 00:03:53.360\nthat's a little bit about IPsec itself.\n\n73\n00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.170\nIPsec is a protocol we can\nuse to create tunnels.\n\n74\n00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.500\nNow we said with the VPN or\n\n75\n00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.340\na virtual private network we're gonna\ntunnel through insecure portions of\n\n76\n00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.640\na network like the Internet to create\na secure way to send data back and forth.\n\n77\n00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.900\nAnd IPsec can be used to do that.\n\n78\n00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.730\nNow there is three big components that\nwe need to be familiar with with IPsec.\n\n79\n00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.580\nThere is something known\nas authentication header,\n\n80\n00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.170\nthere is something known as\nencapsulating security payload.\n\n81\n00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.570\nAnd there is also something\nknown as Internet key exchange.\n\n82\n00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.180\nAnd we'll talk about each one\nof these pieces of IPsec.\n\n83\n00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.040\nSo these are the inner\nworkings of IPsec if you will.\n\n84\n00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.180\nAuthentication header or For\nshort, is a way to provide\n\n85\n00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.450\nintegrity for packet headers, for\ndata, for user authentication.\n\n86\n00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.890\nIf you go back to some of our previous\nepisodes, we talked about the CIA triad,\n\n87\n00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.845\nwe talked about what integrity is.\n\n88\n00:04:51.845 --> 00:04:57.330\nSo a way to make sure that something has\nnot been modified either accidentally or\n\n89\n00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.500\nmaliciously.\n\n90\n00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.620\nSo when I say authentication header\nprovides integrity for data packets,\n\n91\n00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.170\ndata headers, for user authentication,\n\n92\n00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:09.850\nwhat I'm saying is that packet leaves\nthe source it gets digitally signed.\n\n93\n00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.760\nAnd when it gets to the other end,\nthat digital signature is verified\n\n94\n00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.140\nto make sure it still matches the data in\nthat packet or the header in that packet.\n\n95\n00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.060\nWhatever we are trying\nput that protections for.\n\n96\n00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.000\nIf it doesn't match anymore I\nknow something's been modified,\n\n97\n00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.280\nI don't know how I don't know why but\nI know it's not what was originally sent.\n\n98\n00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.430\nSo I drop the packet and\nI say, send it again.\n\n99\n00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.150\nAnd hopefully this time I'll get the\nactual packet the way it was meant to be.\n\n100\n00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.430\nThat is what we mean when we say\nauthentication header provides integrity.\n\n101\n00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.350\nIt can also provide some replay attack,\nreplay protection,\n\n102\n00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:45.920\nI should say, not replay attack.\n\n103\n00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.370\nTo protect against replay attacks.\n\n104\n00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.360\nSomebody capturing packets and\ntrying to reuse them later.\n\n105\n00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.610\nBut another key we want to remember about\nauthentication headers It doesn't encrypt.\n\n106\n00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.330\nIt's providing integrity,\nbut not confidentiality.\n\n107\n00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.690\nSo we're only providing one\nleg really of that CIA triad\n\n108\n00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.270\nwhen we're using authentication header.\n\n109\n00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.830\nBut that might be all we need.\n\n110\n00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.800\nIt might be a scenario where I'm\nnot worried about confidentiality,\n\n111\n00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.520\nI just have to make sure that the data\nmaintains its integrity as it travels.\n\n112\n00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.820\nMaybe it's not, IPsec can be used in\nmany places, not just VPN tunnels.\n\n113\n00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.680\nSo there are times when I don't\nnecessarily need the extra overhead of\n\n114\n00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.450\nsay encryption or something like that.\n\n115\n00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:30.119\nSo authentication header is all I need.\n\n116\n00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.420\nIf we're gonna use authentication header,\nanother key very possible test question.\n\n117\n00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.540\nHint, hint, write this one down.\n\n118\n00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.270\nIP protocol 51, it has to be enabled or\n\n119\n00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.820\nallowed on your firewalls in order\nto use authentication header.\n\n120\n00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:51.669\nIf a firewall blocks IP protocol 51, then\nauthentication header cannot function.\n\n121\n00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.740\nThe other mode, or another I should\nsay component not mode, is ESP.\n\n122\n00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.140\nSo IPsec is actually psychic.\n\n123\n00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:05.285\nIt knows what you're gonna\ndo before you do it.\n\n124\n00:07:05.285 --> 00:07:06.041\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm just kidding.\n\n125\n00:07:06.041 --> 00:07:07.058\n&gt;&gt; No you're not kidding.\n\n126\n00:07:07.058 --> 00:07:10.411\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] it's crazy.\n\n127\n00:07:10.411 --> 00:07:15.680\n&gt;&gt; Not ESP in that sense, but\nESP as in Encapsulating Security Payload.\n\n128\n00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.050\nAnd if you read that to yourself slowly.\n\n129\n00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.330\nYou're thinking about slowly.\n\n130\n00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:23.320\nYou probably come to the conclusion\nthat we're going to provide security for\n\n131\n00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:23.850\nthe payload.\n\n132\n00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:25.030\nThis is the data part right.\n\n133\n00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.890\nThis is how we can encrypt the packets.\n\n134\n00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:32.460\nTo make sure that any bad actors can't\nget to the data if they try to steal it.\n\n135\n00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.260\nAs it travels across the network.\n\n136\n00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.520\nSo this is going to provide authenticity.\n\n137\n00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.160\nIt's also gonna provide integrity\nas well as confidentiality.\n\n138\n00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.815\nYou get a lot of the CIA triad there,\nright?\n\n139\n00:07:43.815 --> 00:07:44.730\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n140\n00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:46.770\n&gt;&gt; By encrypting it,\nwe get confidentiality.\n\n141\n00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:51.260\nBecause if you don't know the decryption\nkey, you can't see the information.\n\n142\n00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.753\nSo it's confidential.\n\n143\n00:07:52.753 --> 00:07:57.645\nWe get authenticity and integrity,\nbecause encrypted data If it can\n\n144\n00:07:57.645 --> 00:08:01.270\nbe decrypted at the other\nend with your public key,\n\n145\n00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:05.845\nthen it had to be signed with your\nprivate key in the first place.\n\n146\n00:08:05.845 --> 00:08:09.050\nAnd I know that might be too deep for\nthis particular class.\n\n147\n00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.180\nBut it does provide authenticity.\n\n148\n00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.980\nI can verify the identity of the sender,\n\n149\n00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:17.250\njust by the fact that it\ndecrypts properly, right?\n\n150\n00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:18.798\nAnd integrity.\n\n151\n00:08:18.798 --> 00:08:21.244\nBecause it's very hard to\nchange encrypted data.\n\n152\n00:08:21.244 --> 00:08:23.897\nIf I can't see the data,\nif I can't understand the data,\n\n153\n00:08:23.897 --> 00:08:26.600\nhow can I change it to\nsomething meaningful, right?\n\n154\n00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.750\nIt's just a bunch of garbldy goop.\n\n155\n00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:31.180\nI don't know what to change it to to make\nsense when it gets to the other end.\n\n156\n00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:33.820\nSo it does provide integrity as well.\n\n157\n00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:38.520\nESP does require\nIP Protocol 50 to function.\n\n158\n00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.469\nSo another exception you've\ngotta make in your firewall.\n\n159\n00:08:41.469 --> 00:08:46.654\nIP Protocol 50 for ESP,\n51 for Authentication Header.\n\n160\n00:08:46.654 --> 00:08:50.332\nAnother component of IPsec is IKE or\n\n161\n00:08:50.332 --> 00:08:54.505\nInternet Key Exchange or IKE for short.\n\n162\n00:08:54.505 --> 00:08:58.169\nThis is, just like the name says,\nInternet Key Exchange.\n\n163\n00:08:58.169 --> 00:09:03.270\nThis is a protocol that we can use\nto exchange the keys necessary to\n\n164\n00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:08.750\ndo the encryption and to do the signing\nof these packets, all right.\n\n165\n00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:12.190\nSo IKE is used, or Internet Key Exchange\nis used, to create and\n\n166\n00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.350\nmanage what we call security associations.\n\n167\n00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:19.640\nI want to talk to, I want to set up\na tunnel between me and that destination,\n\n168\n00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.420\nbut before I can do that we need to\nexchange some keying information, so\n\n169\n00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:27.340\nthat I can decrypt what you send me, I\ncan encrypt stuff and you can decrypt it.\n\n170\n00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:28.331\nThat kind of thing.\n\n171\n00:09:28.331 --> 00:09:32.088\nIKE is what takes care of that key\nexchange, keeps that part safe.\n\n172\n00:09:32.088 --> 00:09:37.707\nFor this one, you need UDP port 500,\nhas to be allowed at the firewall.\n\n173\n00:09:37.707 --> 00:09:40.288\nAll right, so those are the components,\n\n174\n00:09:40.288 --> 00:09:43.475\nsome of the protocols within\nIPsec that we can use.\n\n175\n00:09:43.475 --> 00:09:48.177\nAuthentication header, ESP, and IKE.\n\n176\n00:09:48.177 --> 00:09:52.580\nIPsec also has two modes that we\ncan actually operate in, right?\n\n177\n00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.100\nThere's transport mode,\nand there's tunnel mode.\n\n178\n00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:59.746\nIn transport mode, we're talking\nabout host-to-host communications.\n\n179\n00:09:59.746 --> 00:10:02.706\nSo, my laptop wants to\ntalk to Zach's laptop, or\n\n180\n00:10:02.706 --> 00:10:06.798\nmy laptop wants to talk to a file\nserver here on my local area network.\n\n181\n00:10:06.798 --> 00:10:10.623\nWe can actually use transport mode,\nIPsec in transport mode,\n\n182\n00:10:10.623 --> 00:10:12.990\nto protect that traffic.\n\n183\n00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:15.800\nOnly the data is gonna be encapsulated.\n\n184\n00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:19.000\nThe header where the source and\ndestination information are,\n\n185\n00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.460\nthe addressing, remains untouched.\n\n186\n00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:25.280\nSo, it's really just encapsulating\nthe actual payload part,\n\n187\n00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.730\nthe email I'm sending, or\n\n188\n00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:32.140\nthe Word document I'm saving to the file\nserver, or whatever the case may be.\n\n189\n00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:35.860\nThe original header and all that\nrouting information is still used.\n\n190\n00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:43.740\nIf we're using NAT, then we cannot use\nAuthentication Header in transport mode,\n\n191\n00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:48.670\nbecause remember what NAT does and\nremember what Authentication Header does.\n\n192\n00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:53.240\nAuthentication Header signs the header\nportion to make sure it's not modified.\n\n193\n00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.032\nNat modifies it [LAUGH].\n\n194\n00:10:55.032 --> 00:10:57.778\nSo you got one piece trying to say,\nhey, make sure this isn't modified.\n\n195\n00:10:57.778 --> 00:11:00.340\nYou got another component saying,\nhey, modify this.\n\n196\n00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:01.090\nIt's not gonna work.\n\n197\n00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:05.550\nSo Authentication Header\ncannot be used with NAT.\n\n198\n00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:10.348\nBut this is used for\nwhat we call server or domain isolation,\n\n199\n00:11:10.348 --> 00:11:16.294\nwhich we're gonna come back to here at\nthe end of this episode, all right?\n\n200\n00:11:16.294 --> 00:11:23.830\nSo transport mode, host-to-host primarily\nused in server and domain isolation.\n\n201\n00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:27.011\nTunnel mode is the other\nmode we can run IPsec in.\n\n202\n00:11:27.011 --> 00:11:31.570\nAnd this one is what we would call\ngateway-to-gateway or gateway-to-host.\n\n203\n00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:34.375\nYou'll see this used when\nyou've got a branch office and\n\n204\n00:11:34.375 --> 00:11:36.020\nyou've got a corporate office.\n\n205\n00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.711\nAnd I've got lots of users\nat the branch office,\n\n206\n00:11:37.711 --> 00:11:40.280\nI've got lots of resources back\nthere at the corporate office.\n\n207\n00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.424\nThey're all trying to go\nacross the Internet, the WAN,\n\n208\n00:11:43.424 --> 00:11:46.581\nto connect to the corporate\noffice to access resources.\n\n209\n00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:49.670\nBut I've got to protect that data\nas it travels across the network.\n\n210\n00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:54.200\nRather than have every individual user\nset up a host-to-host connection back to\n\n211\n00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.050\nsome server that they're trying to\nconnect to at the corporate office,\n\n212\n00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.910\nwhat if we just built a tunnel\nbetween the two offices?\n\n213\n00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:03.458\nA nice, big tunnel that all\nthe users could kinda share.\n\n214\n00:12:03.458 --> 00:12:05.723\nA multi-lane tunnel if you will.\n\n215\n00:12:05.723 --> 00:12:09.570\nSo now all those users, they don't have to\nset up individual tunnels to connect to\n\n216\n00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:10.940\nthe corporate office.\n\n217\n00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:14.688\nThey can all just go through\nthis gateway-to-gateway or\n\n218\n00:12:14.688 --> 00:12:20.194\nsite-to-site tunnel that exists between\nthe border router of the branch office and\n\n219\n00:12:20.194 --> 00:12:23.038\nthe border router at the corporate office.\n\n220\n00:12:23.038 --> 00:12:27.332\nWhat's gonna happen with this one,\nis one, the entire packet is\n\n221\n00:12:27.332 --> 00:12:31.480\ngoing to get encapsulated, and\nthen a new header gets puts on.\n\n222\n00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.461\nSo, the original packet,\nwhich has the original source and\n\n223\n00:12:34.461 --> 00:12:37.034\ndestination, my laptop\nhere at the branch office,\n\n224\n00:12:37.034 --> 00:12:40.353\nis trying to send a packet to a file\nserver at the corporate office.\n\n225\n00:12:40.353 --> 00:12:44.075\nSo the source address is my laptop.\n\n226\n00:12:44.075 --> 00:12:48.172\nThe destination address is the file server\nover there at the corporate office.\n\n227\n00:12:48.172 --> 00:12:49.550\nI'm gonna send that packet.\n\n228\n00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:52.550\nIt's gonna get to the border\nrouter of my branch office.\n\n229\n00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:55.540\nThe border router is gonna say, hey you\nwant to send this through the tunnel?\n\n230\n00:12:55.540 --> 00:13:00.200\nOkay, and it's gonna encapsulate\nthe entire thing and it's gonna\n\n231\n00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:04.770\nput on the outside of that encapsulated\npacket, it's gonna put a brand new header.\n\n232\n00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:08.910\nAnd it's gonna put his own IP address\nas the source, and the other end of\n\n233\n00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:12.922\nthe tunnel as the destination,\nthe router at the corporate office.\n\n234\n00:13:12.922 --> 00:13:14.746\nSo now it travels through the tunnel,\n\n235\n00:13:14.746 --> 00:13:17.510\nit gets to the router at\nthe corporate office.\n\n236\n00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:21.150\nAnd that's the destination for\nthe encapsulated packet.\n\n237\n00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:24.960\nIt gets there, now that router\nat the corporate office can\n\n238\n00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:28.760\npeel back the encapsulation and\nwe're left with the original packet.\n\n239\n00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.240\nWhich has the original destination,\nthat file server, and\n\n240\n00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.540\nit can finish its destination.\n\n241\n00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:36.750\nIt's not encrypted anymore, but it's\nalready on to my corporate network, and\n\n242\n00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:37.360\nit's safe, right?\n\n243\n00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.672\nIt made it through the tunnel\nacross the Internet, and\n\n244\n00:13:40.672 --> 00:13:43.771\nnow it's on the corporate network and\nit's safe.\n\n245\n00:13:43.771 --> 00:13:46.995\n&gt;&gt; I love you explain things,\ncuz I followed everything you said.\n\n246\n00:13:46.995 --> 00:13:48.064\nIt makes perfect sense.\n\n247\n00:13:48.064 --> 00:13:53.665\nI can even a little man in a little\ncapsule in a tunnel going somewhere.\n\n248\n00:13:53.665 --> 00:13:55.828\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's what I like,\nI like to hear that.\n\n249\n00:13:55.828 --> 00:14:01.590\nI always try to think of analogies that\nmaybe are not quite computer-related.\n\n250\n00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:06.440\nI'm a very visual learner if you\nhaven't figured that out yet.\n\n251\n00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:11.740\nAll right, so that is our\ngateway-to-gateway, or gateway-to-host.\n\n252\n00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.440\nI say gateway-to-gateway,\nwhich is what I just described.\n\n253\n00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.960\nBranch office, corporate office.\n\n254\n00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.150\nBut this can also be used for\nthat remote office worker or\n\n255\n00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.750\nyou at home trying to connect\nto the corporate office.\n\n256\n00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:25.100\nExact same thing,\nexcept you're gonna set up the tunnel\n\n257\n00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:29.300\nfrom your laptop at home to that\nrouter at the corporate office.\n\n258\n00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:32.185\nBut the same thing is gonna happen,\nit's gonna get encapsulated,\n\n259\n00:14:32.185 --> 00:14:33.457\nit's gonna get a new header.\n\n260\n00:14:33.457 --> 00:14:37.080\nThe destination is the other end of\nthe tunnel, it gets there to the corporate\n\n261\n00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:40.146\nnetwork, it gets uncapsulated,\nif that's the right word, and\n\n262\n00:14:40.146 --> 00:14:43.710\nthen it's allowed to travel back\nthere on that corporate network.\n\n263\n00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:49.610\nSo the tunnel mode is gateway-to-gateway,\nor site-to-site, and remote access,\n\n264\n00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:54.350\ncreating that VPN tunnel from home\nto work or from that hotel to work.\n\n265\n00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:57.918\nAll right, Zach, what do we got next here?\n\n266\n00:14:57.918 --> 00:14:59.582\n&gt;&gt; Well I thought we were\ngonna talk about SSL.\n\n267\n00:14:59.582 --> 00:15:01.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like that, let's do that.\n\n268\n00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:07.295\nWe're gonna limit our conversation\nwith SSL and TLS to VPN, but\n\n269\n00:15:07.295 --> 00:15:12.230\nif you've, I'm trying to think\nof somebody that might not have.\n\n270\n00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:15.137\nIf you've ever been on the Internet and\ngone to a secure website, right?\n\n271\n00:15:15.137 --> 00:15:19.134\nYour bank, anyplace that you\nget the https, you've used SSL.\n\n272\n00:15:19.134 --> 00:15:23.597\nThat is secure socket layer\nthat is being used to\n\n273\n00:15:23.597 --> 00:15:28.515\ncreate that https connection,\nthat secure https.\n\n274\n00:15:28.515 --> 00:15:32.326\nAnd TLS is kind of\nthe standardized version of SSL,\n\n275\n00:15:32.326 --> 00:15:36.502\nbecause there was some proprietary with,\nwhat was it?\n\n276\n00:15:36.502 --> 00:15:37.432\nNetscape, I believe,\n\n277\n00:15:37.432 --> 00:15:41.000\nif I remember it right, that generated or\nthat came up with SSL in the first place.\n\n278\n00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.954\nAnyway, that's another story.\n\n279\n00:15:42.954 --> 00:15:47.465\nHere, what I wanna talk about is\nthe fact that we can use SSL/TLS,\n\n280\n00:15:47.465 --> 00:15:52.260\nbecause TLS is slowly taking\nover from SSL, to create VPNs.\n\n281\n00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.954\nRight?\nCrazy, I know.\n\n282\n00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:57.320\nIt's pretty neat technology, though.\n\n283\n00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.440\nWe primarily use this for\nremote access VPNs.\n\n284\n00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:03.520\nThis is not used for that site to site,\n\n285\n00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.270\nthe branch office back\nto the corporate office.\n\n286\n00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:11.490\nWe would still use something like\nIPsec in tunnel mode for that.\n\n287\n00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:16.820\nBecause SSL, TLS VPN connections\nare going to be application based.\n\n288\n00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:21.330\nThese are gonna be up,\nnot like IPsec down at layer three,\n\n289\n00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:25.290\nthese are gonna be up at layer four,\nor I should say five, six, seven.\n\n290\n00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:28.105\nThey're gonna be up there at\nthe top of that OSI model,\n\n291\n00:16:28.105 --> 00:16:30.950\nthey're going to be application based.\n\n292\n00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:34.730\nSo but it's really neat in the fact that\n\n293\n00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.410\njust about every computer\nsupports a browser.\n\n294\n00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:41.570\nAnd most browsers support this.\n\n295\n00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:44.840\nSo just about every device out\nthere already supports this.\n\n296\n00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:49.290\nSo there is no extra client to\ndistribute out to all of my workers or\n\n297\n00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:51.410\nmy remote office workers and\nthings like that.\n\n298\n00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:54.670\nIf they've got a browser,\nthey most likely support this already.\n\n299\n00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.740\nSo it's platform independent,\nit is browser based.\n\n300\n00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:05.250\nAgain, it's primarily used,\nas I said, for remote access.\n\n301\n00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:09.950\nSo I'm at the hotel, I'm gonna open up\na browser, I'm going to create that\n\n302\n00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:13.790\nconnection back to my corporate office and\nnow I can connect to those corporate\n\n303\n00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:18.070\nresources through a tunnel,\nprotected with SSL, so it's encrypted.\n\n304\n00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:20.850\nIt's protected as it\ntravels across the network.\n\n305\n00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:27.851\nNow, some upsides to using SSL, TLS,\nor using this for VPNs is newer.\n\n306\n00:17:27.851 --> 00:17:32.595\nIt's not new, but it is one of\nthe later tunneling protocols.\n\n307\n00:17:34.235 --> 00:17:36.925\nThere are some up sides to this.\n\n308\n00:17:36.925 --> 00:17:39.645\nOne, it's like I said,\nit's platform independent,\n\n309\n00:17:39.645 --> 00:17:43.000\nit's browser based, support for net.\n\n310\n00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.270\nBecause this is working up at layer\nfour and five or above the network layer\n\n311\n00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:50.810\nwithout messing with the source and\ndestination information.\n\n312\n00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:53.580\nSo, network address translation\nworks fine with this.\n\n313\n00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:57.460\nWith as few as firewall rules,\n\n314\n00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:01.920\nremember that I listed three that\nwe going to enable for doing IP 6,\n\n315\n00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:07.670\nIP protocol 50 and 51 and UTP 500,\nwith SSL TLS we're talking about 443 which\n\n316\n00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:13.200\nis probably already open on most firewalls\nfor secure websites, right, for HTTPS.\n\n317\n00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.250\nSo I make one,\nif any exceptions in my firewalls.\n\n318\n00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:20.270\nEspecially good when you're doing remote\naccess because you might be going through\n\n319\n00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:22.450\nfirewalls that are out of your control.\n\n320\n00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:24.630\nThat you can't just go and\nopen up a port on.\n\n321\n00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:27.970\nBut like I said, most firewalls\nalready allow port 80 and port 443.\n\n322\n00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:32.660\nSince this goes over 443,\nwe're good to go, right?\n\n323\n00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.890\nThere is also more granular access.\n\n324\n00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:40.930\nIt's a little different in the fact\nthat we create a tunnel basically\n\n325\n00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:45.900\nto the resource not just to the corporate\nnetwork like with IPsec, right.\n\n326\n00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.590\nSo the tunnel ends at that\nborder router there, and\n\n327\n00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:50.840\nnow you're on the corporate network and\nyou're free to do whatever you want,\n\n328\n00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.900\nwhatever you would\nnormally have access to.\n\n329\n00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:57.470\nWith SSL TLS, you're really connecting\nto a particular resource, a file server,\n\n330\n00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:01.140\na file on that file server and\nit's opening up in your browser here,\n\n331\n00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:05.780\nwhich means I've got a lot\nmore granular access control.\n\n332\n00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:09.550\nI can be very specific about what\nyou're allowed to access remotely, and\n\n333\n00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:10.770\nthat can be a good thing, right?\n\n334\n00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:13.370\nI don't want you getting somethings\nwhen you're making a remote connection.\n\n335\n00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:18.170\nAlso means a lot more configuration\non my end, setting things up.\n\n336\n00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:21.200\nDeciding what you have access\nto when you make that SSL VPN\n\n337\n00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.840\nback to my corporate network.\n\n338\n00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:27.440\nSo there's a little more work\ninvolved in setting this up as well.\n\n339\n00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:33.190\nBut, like I said, there's so\nmany pros to it, it is becoming more and\n\n340\n00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:40.100\nmore common to see SSL TLS type VPNs,\nand those are just a few.\n\n341\n00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:42.580\nWe could, I'm not going to,\nit's not on the exam.\n\n342\n00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:47.550\nBut just for your own benefit there\nare other protocols that we could use,\n\n343\n00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:50.670\nlike PPTP, Point to Point Tunnel Protocol.\n\n344\n00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:54.338\nWe could use L2TP,\nLayer 2 Tunneling Protocol.\n\n345\n00:19:54.338 --> 00:19:57.840\nThese are older but they're still,\n\n346\n00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:03.000\nyou still see them out there\ntoday being used to create VPNs.\n\n347\n00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.590\n&gt;&gt; Mike what about server and\ndomain isolation?\n\n348\n00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:08.590\n&gt;&gt; All right let's talk about that.\n\n349\n00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:11.430\nThat's really we've been talking this\nwhole time about network isolation,\n\n350\n00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:16.360\nways to isolate networks we talked about\nusing VLANs to create isolation by\n\n351\n00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:20.540\nsegregating out portions of out network,\nwe talked\n\n352\n00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:26.580\nabout parameter networks, to separate\nportions of my network that have reduced\n\n353\n00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:32.150\nsecurity, public available resources,\nwe talked about NAT.\n\n354\n00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:35.560\nThere's another segregation technique,\nas we're using private IP addresses.\n\n355\n00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:39.110\nThat's segregating that portion of\nmy network from say the internet or\n\n356\n00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:40.339\nfrom other portions of my network.\n\n357\n00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:45.940\nWhen it comes to, what they're referring\nto here though with server and\n\n358\n00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:47.960\ndomain isolation.\n\n359\n00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:51.990\nThis is a technique in where we're\ngonna use IPsec in transport mode,\n\n360\n00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:55.130\nremember I said this will\nbe transport mode, and\n\n361\n00:20:55.130 --> 00:21:00.660\nActive Directory to dynamically\nsegment out our network, all right?\n\n362\n00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:04.940\nAnd the way it works is we're\ngonna use the authentication\n\n363\n00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:08.330\nthat we do with IPsec cuz\nIPsec requires authentication.\n\n364\n00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:12.025\nI have to verify the identity of\nthe other end, both ends, actually.\n\n365\n00:21:12.025 --> 00:21:13.355\nWe can set up mutual authentication.\n\n366\n00:21:13.355 --> 00:21:18.655\nWhen you create an IPsec conversation you\nhave to prove the identity of each end so\n\n367\n00:21:18.655 --> 00:21:20.875\nthat you can set up\nthat secure connection.\n\n368\n00:21:20.875 --> 00:21:23.555\nCreate that security association.\n\n369\n00:21:23.555 --> 00:21:25.005\nSo there is some authentication going on.\n\n370\n00:21:25.005 --> 00:21:28.435\nAnd using IPsec we can use different\nmethods from user credentials\n\n371\n00:21:28.435 --> 00:21:29.920\nto computer credentials.\n\n372\n00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.758\nThey could be certificates, they could be\nKerboros, you could use different things.\n\n373\n00:21:33.758 --> 00:21:39.330\nWith server domain isolation we are going\nto use IPsec and transport mode and\n\n374\n00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:44.100\nthe machine credentials\nto create the isolation.\n\n375\n00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:51.330\nFor domain isolation all I'm gonna do\nis set up an IPsec rule that says,\n\n376\n00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:55.870\nif you wanna talk to any computer in my\ndomain you have to have a certificate\n\n377\n00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:59.300\nthat proves your identity, and\nyou have to be part of our domain.\n\n378\n00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:03.810\nSo your identity must be something\nsomething @itpro.tv, right?\n\n379\n00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:07.010\nIf you're not you can't talk to\nany of my machines in my network.\n\n380\n00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:11.067\nSo, I've in fact isolated my entire\ndomain from everything else.\n\n381\n00:22:11.067 --> 00:22:16.090\nIf you can't provide a certificate\nthat shows me you're part of ITProTV,\n\n382\n00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:18.850\nyou don't get to talk to any\nof my machines on my network.\n\n383\n00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:21.840\nSo all my machines within my network,\nthey can talk to each other no problem.\n\n384\n00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.290\nHey, I wanna talk to you Zack.\n\n385\n00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:25.215\nZack says are you a part of ITProTV?\n\n386\n00:22:25.215 --> 00:22:26.955\nYes I am.\nHere's my certificate.\n\n387\n00:22:26.955 --> 00:22:28.505\nOkay, we can talk, right.\n\n388\n00:22:28.505 --> 00:22:31.495\nWe can talk within ITProTV no problem.\n\n389\n00:22:31.495 --> 00:22:34.655\nBut if anybody from the outside\ntries to talk, not gonna work,\n\n390\n00:22:34.655 --> 00:22:36.445\nbecause they're not part of ITProTV.\n\n391\n00:22:36.445 --> 00:22:39.105\nSo we've isolated our entire domain.\n\n392\n00:22:40.195 --> 00:22:42.915\nThis might be done in a very\nsecure environment or\n\n393\n00:22:42.915 --> 00:22:46.795\nwould have set up a second domain or\na third domain within my forest.\n\n394\n00:22:46.795 --> 00:22:51.450\nAnd it's my RND domain and\nnobody from my normal users and\n\n395\n00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:56.340\nworkers, they don't need to talk to\nRND resources so I can isolate that\n\n396\n00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:00.780\ndomain by requiring authentication there\nproving that you are part of that domain.\n\n397\n00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:07.500\nMore often than not though, at least in my\nexperience what I see is server isolation.\n\n398\n00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.670\nAnd this is where I say,\nokay I'm gonna take this group of servers,\n\n399\n00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:14.720\nnot the entire domain, but these servers\nthat contain sensitive information.\n\n400\n00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.960\nAnd I'm going to limit\nwho can talk to them,\n\n401\n00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:22.390\nby again using either machine certificates\nor just the machine's passwords.\n\n402\n00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:25.670\nYou know, Kerberos,\nactive directory identification.\n\n403\n00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:30.460\nSo I might have a server that\nhas pay roll information.\n\n404\n00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.380\nAnd I can limit who can\ntalk to that server.\n\n405\n00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:35.700\nI can say I'm going to use IPsec,\ntransport mode.\n\n406\n00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:39.160\nAnd say only those five computers in HR.\n\n407\n00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.575\nIs it HR that sends your payroll out?\n\n408\n00:23:40.575 --> 00:23:41.398\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n409\n00:23:41.398 --> 00:23:44.275\nI'm going to say that those five servers,\nor\n\n410\n00:23:44.275 --> 00:23:48.981\nthose five laptops in HR can talk to\nthe server, nobody else can, right?\n\n411\n00:23:48.981 --> 00:23:52.002\nAll still part of the same domain,\nRight, but now if you're IP\n\n412\n00:23:52.002 --> 00:23:55.424\naddress isn't one of those five, or\nI shouldn't say your IP address.\n\n413\n00:23:55.424 --> 00:23:58.834\nIf your certificate doesn't match\none of those five computers or\n\n414\n00:23:58.834 --> 00:24:02.864\nyou're not authenticated through\nKerberos as one of those five computers,\n\n415\n00:24:02.864 --> 00:24:04.547\nyou won't talk to that server.\n\n416\n00:24:04.547 --> 00:24:07.800\nSo I've isolated that server,\nbut you see after we've done it,\n\n417\n00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:11.187\nit's physically it's still connected\nto the same network right.\n\n418\n00:24:11.187 --> 00:24:18.444\nBut we've used IPsec and authentication to\nlogically isolate it from everybody else.\n\n419\n00:24:18.444 --> 00:24:22.355\nRight, and it's not, I don't wanna say,\nit's not gonna be our\n\n420\n00:24:22.355 --> 00:24:26.280\nonly security solution,\nwe never put all our eggs in one basket.\n\n421\n00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:30.112\nBut it does a good job of making sure\nthat other machines are not allowed.\n\n422\n00:24:30.112 --> 00:24:34.699\nSo you might have a group of servers that\nR and D uses to store their research and\n\n423\n00:24:34.699 --> 00:24:37.679\ndevelopment proprietary information,\nright.\n\n424\n00:24:37.679 --> 00:24:41.441\nAnd I can setup server isolation there,\nI can say only the laptops or\n\n425\n00:24:41.441 --> 00:24:44.348\ncomputers that are in R and\nD are allowed to connect.\n\n426\n00:24:44.348 --> 00:24:48.470\nSo I'll issue special certificates to\nthose computers that prove they're part\n\n427\n00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:49.024\nof R and D.\n\n428\n00:24:49.024 --> 00:24:50.917\nAnd if you try to connect\nto one of those servers and\n\n429\n00:24:50.917 --> 00:24:53.680\nyou don't have that special certificate,\nyou don't get access to it.\n\n430\n00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.546\nSo even though you're\npart of the same network,\n\n431\n00:24:55.546 --> 00:24:57.283\nyou're not gonna get\naccess to that server.\n\n432\n00:24:57.283 --> 00:25:01.261\nSo that's what they mean when they say\nserver isolation and domain isolation.\n\n433\n00:25:01.261 --> 00:25:05.642\nUse an IPsec and transport mode and\nActive Directory, your certificates,\n\n434\n00:25:05.642 --> 00:25:09.065\nto isolate either this group of servers,\na single server or\n\n435\n00:25:09.065 --> 00:25:11.750\nthe entire domain from everybody else.\n\n436\n00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:16.462\n&gt;&gt; So, network isolation, we've learned an\nawful lot, did you wanna do like a little?\n\n437\n00:25:16.462 --> 00:25:17.066\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] Can I?\n\n438\n00:25:17.066 --> 00:25:21.760\nLet's see, in this one, we picked up\ntalking about, gosh, you know what,\n\n439\n00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.738\nwhere did we start with this one?\n\n440\n00:25:23.738 --> 00:25:27.669\nWe talked about IPsec with this one right,\nso we started off with IPsec,\n\n441\n00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:29.931\nwent through the different components.\n\n442\n00:25:29.931 --> 00:25:34.570\nAuthentication header, encapsulated\nsecurity payload, Internet key exchange.\n\n443\n00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:38.472\nWe talked about the different\nmodes we can run in IPsec in,\n\n444\n00:25:38.472 --> 00:25:40.714\ntransport mode and tunnel mode.\n\n445\n00:25:40.714 --> 00:25:44.876\nAnd then we talked about using\nSSL/TLS to create VPNs and\n\n446\n00:25:44.876 --> 00:25:48.961\nhow it's a kind of a newer\nfangled way of creating VPNs.\n\n447\n00:25:48.961 --> 00:25:53.074\nUses a browser and\na more common port, port 443,\n\n448\n00:25:53.074 --> 00:25:56.639\nto create those tunnels\nacross the network.\n\n449\n00:25:56.639 --> 00:26:02.441\nAnd primarily used for remote access,\nnot site to site, that would be IPsec.\n\n450\n00:26:02.441 --> 00:26:04.945\nAnd then it ended up with, sorry,\nended it up with server isolation and\n\n451\n00:26:04.945 --> 00:26:05.671\ndomain isolation.\n\n452\n00:26:05.671 --> 00:26:09.074\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh, that's right, well this\nis part three network isolations,\n\n453\n00:26:09.074 --> 00:26:12.217\nyou wanna make sure you watch part one,\npart two, and part three.\n\n454\n00:26:12.217 --> 00:26:16.217\nAnd you can because you have access to\nour library, you're so fortunate, and\n\n455\n00:26:16.217 --> 00:26:18.102\nthis is MTA Security Fundamentals.\n\n456\n00:26:18.102 --> 00:26:22.500\nAt ITProTV we help the IT pro\nlearn wherever they

choice to watch ITPRO TV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.015 --> 00:00:19.130\nHelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.140\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we continue\non with MTA security fundamentals.\n\n8\n00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.990\nToday we're talking about protocol\nsecurity with our very own Mike Roderick.\n\n9\n00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.816\nMike, hello.\n\n10\n00:00:27.816 --> 00:00:28.830\n&gt;&gt; Hey Zach.\n\n11\n00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.580\n&gt;&gt; Good to see you sir.\n\n12\n00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.740\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.\n\n13\n00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.980\nAnd you're right, we're talking\nabout protocol security today.\n\n14\n00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.180\nIn some of the books I read,\nI'm not sure that I agree with them, but\n\n15\n00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.220\nsome of the books that I'm reading will\ntry to say that protocol security is one\n\n16\n00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.740\nof the places network administrators or\ninformation security people\n\n17\n00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.120\nsometimes lack and I don't know, maybe,\nmaybe not, anyway who cares what they say.\n\n18\n00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.020\nWe're gonna make sure we understand it.\n\n19\n00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.370\nAnd they say that because information\nsecurity people deal with data,\n\n20\n00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.550\nsecuring files, securing access, and\nthey don't understand the networking,\n\n21\n00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.460\nthe protocols, the languages as much.\n\n22\n00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.550\nMaybe, maybe not.\n\n23\n00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.930\n&gt;&gt; So could you break down for\nus exactly what is protocol security?\n\n24\n00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nIt could be a trick question,\n\n25\n00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.420\nbecause there might be a couple of\ndifferent ways that we could look at\n\n26\n00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.010\nprotocol security.\n\n27\n00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.280\nOne thing,\nif you read about protocol security,\n\n28\n00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.370\nwhat you might be reading is\npeople using protocols in\n\n29\n00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.720\na way to hide certain data or to,\nI'm trying to have a good way to say it.\n\n30\n00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.260\nAnyway, that is not what we're\ntalking about in this case.\n\n31\n00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.780\nSo if you start reading anything about\nthat while you're doing your studying\n\n32\n00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:30.550\njust ignore it.\n\n33\n00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.770\nThat's not what I need.\n\n34\n00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.250\nWhat we're here to talk about when we\ntalk about protocol security it is really\n\n35\n00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.120\nthe different protocols\nAlso we have available and\n\n36\n00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.490\nwhat types of security\nare choosing the right protocol.\n\n37\n00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.550\nThe one that provides security for\n\n38\n00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.160\nyou I think is a good way to look\nat what we're here to talk about.\n\n39\n00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.740\nIf we talk about FTP,\nFile Transfer Protocol.\n\n40\n00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.960\nThis is a protocol that we can use to\ntransfer files across the network.\n\n41\n00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.120\nIt's been around forever and a day,\nback from the original ARPANET and\n\n42\n00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.000\nstuff like that,\nbefore HTTP was ever thought about.\n\n43\n00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.919\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good [INAUDIBLE].\n\n44\n00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:03.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n45\n00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.340\nBut back then,\n\n46\n00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.820\nfunctionality was much more important\nthan security, getting it to work, right?\n\n47\n00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.110\nI mean, it was in the infancy,\nso security wasn't thought of.\n\n48\n00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.979\nAnd FTP has no security,\neverything it sends is in plain text.\n\n49\n00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:21.895\nAnd that's what we're talking about here\nis, when we pick what protocol we wanna\n\n50\n00:02:21.895 --> 00:02:26.230\nuse, we wanna think about which one's\ngonna provide some of that security.\n\n51\n00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.680\nFTP would be an example\nof one that does not.\n\n52\n00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.385\n&gt;&gt; Right on.\nAnd so\n\n53\n00:02:29.385 --> 00:02:31.207\nit's not a one size fits all, is it?\n\n54\n00:02:31.207 --> 00:02:32.382\n&gt;&gt; No, it's definitely not.\n\n55\n00:02:32.382 --> 00:02:33.261\n&gt;&gt; But the application might be?\n\n56\n00:02:33.261 --> 00:02:34.600\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n57\n00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.580\nSometimes you have a choice,\nsometimes you don't.\n\n58\n00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.730\nIt might be the application is hard\ncoded to use a particular protocol.\n\n59\n00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.592\nThere are things we might or\nmight not be able to do about that.\n\n60\n00:02:43.592 --> 00:02:45.460\nBut anyway, for this class, and for\n\n61\n00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.820\nthis set of exam objectives when\nwe talk about protocol security\n\n62\n00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.980\nthey really want us to think about\nthe concept of encapsulation or tunneling.\n\n63\n00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.620\nAnd I think we've mentioned that before,\nZach.\n\n64\n00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.380\n&gt;&gt; Right, now tunneling,\n\n65\n00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.800\nthat's right, this is where we\ncreate almost a virtual tunnel or\n\n66\n00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.150\na wraparound to protect something as\nit travels from one place to another.\n\n67\n00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.970\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n68\n00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.854\nI think we were talking about VPNs, and\nwe talked about how we can encapsulate.\n\n69\n00:03:10.854 --> 00:03:14.550\nWhen we talk about tunneling that\nreally is the definition of tunneling,\n\n70\n00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.350\nis encapsulating one\nprotocol within another.\n\n71\n00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.340\nSo you can think of it as taking\na packet that's in one protocol and\n\n72\n00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.510\njust wrapping it up inside\na completely different protocol.\n\n73\n00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.290\nAnd we do this for a couple of reasons.\n\n74\n00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.650\nWe will tunnel or\nencapsulate when we have to\n\n75\n00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.090\ntransmit a protocol across a network\nthat doesn't support that protocol.\n\n76\n00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.790\nI was trying to think of an example.\n\n77\n00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.955\nOne of them we still see now and\nagain is Teredo, right?\n\n78\n00:03:41.955 --> 00:03:47.460\nTeredo has IPv6,\nthe latest version of Internet protocol\n\n79\n00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.290\nhas come out we still have portion of\nnetwork that don't support IPv6, and so\n\n80\n00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.180\nwe can't transmit IPv6 packet across it.\n\n81\n00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.800\nTeredo is just one\nprotocol that we could use\n\n82\n00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.980\nto encapsulate the IPv4\npacket inside an IPv6 packet.\n\n83\n00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.640\nI'm sorry,\nwe should do that the other way around.\n\n84\n00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.750\nWe should take that IPv6 packet and\nencapsulate it inside an IPv4 packet.\n\n85\n00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.030\nNow, it can travel across\nthat old school IPv4 network,\n\n86\n00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.600\nbecause the rest of the network\ndoesn't see what's inside.\n\n87\n00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.720\nAll they're seeing is that outer wrapper\nand as everybody sees it goes by.\n\n88\n00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.190\nEh, looks like an IPv4 packet, great.\n\n89\n00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.270\nWhen it gets to the end though,\n\n90\n00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.870\nwhen we peel that layer out, then your\nIPv6 packet is free to travel on its way.\n\n91\n00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.705\n&gt;&gt; So Teredo is not something you\ncan get at a taco restaurant?\n\n92\n00:04:29.705 --> 00:04:31.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It is not.\n\n93\n00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.180\nIf you see that on the menu,\nyou should order it.\n\n94\n00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.630\nTake a picture and send it to me.\n\n95\n00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.560\n[LAUGH] So\nthat's what tunneling is all about.\n\n96\n00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.330\nFor transmitting unsupported protocols\nacross unsupported networks.\n\n97\n00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.060\nAlso to provide security.\n\n98\n00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.220\nWe talked about that when\nwe talked about VPNs.\n\n99\n00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.850\nWe've got these packets, these IP packets\nthat are traveling across the public\n\n100\n00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.190\ninfrastructure, which means bad guys, bad\nactors could potentially see that data.\n\n101\n00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.500\nSo we encapsulated in\na protocol that allows for\n\n102\n00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.980\nencryption like IPSec and\nnow the bad guys can't see those packets.\n\n103\n00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.848\n&gt;&gt; So\ncan you give us some examples of timeline?\n\n104\n00:05:05.848 --> 00:05:12.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we talk about Teredo is one\nthat we see on internal networks mostly.\n\n105\n00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:17.940\nAnother one would be 6to4, which is\nanother type of IPv6 tunneling we can do.\n\n106\n00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.750\nVPN traffic, we've talked about\na few of them in previous episodes.\n\n107\n00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:28.360\nPPTP, Point to Point Tunneling Protocol\nis an old, older VPN protocol.\n\n108\n00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.680\nL2TP was Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol.\n\n109\n00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.610\nWe still see that.\n\n110\n00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.020\nBoth of those we still see in use.\n\n111\n00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.790\nThey're just not as common\nbecause they are older.\n\n112\n00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.160\nThey have been replaced or they're\npreferred, I should say there's other\n\n113\n00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:48.230\nprotocols that are more preferred like\nIPsec or TLS using Tunneling Over HTTPS.\n\n114\n00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:49.240\n&gt;&gt; GRE?\n\n115\n00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.210\n&gt;&gt; GRE, generic routing encapsulation\nwas a Cisco tunneling protocol.\n\n116\n00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:55.210\nVery good example there.\n\n117\n00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.030\nSo all those to be examples\nof tunneling protocols.\n\n118\n00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.640\nAnd again, for this exam, for\n\n119\n00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.360\nthese objectives, I just want you to be\nfamiliar with the concept of tunneling.\n\n120\n00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.290\nThat we are wrapping one\nProtocol inside another protocol.\n\n121\n00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.830\nAll right,\nanother protocol security that we\n\n122\n00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.771\nshould talk about is\nsomething known as DNSSEC.\n\n123\n00:06:16.771 --> 00:06:21.690\nDNSSEC or, DNS security, or\nif we wanna break the whole\n\n124\n00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.140\nthing down since this is like\nan acronym inside of an acronym.\n\n125\n00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:29.150\nTo mean name system security,\nshort, short, version DNSSEC, okay?\n\n126\n00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.245\nAnd this is to provide security for DNS.\n\n127\n00:06:31.245 --> 00:06:32.822\nI bet you never would have guessed that,\nright?\n\n128\n00:06:32.822 --> 00:06:34.381\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I thought that's what it meant.\n\n129\n00:06:34.381 --> 00:06:35.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n130\n00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.440\nAnd And that's exactly what it does.\n\n131\n00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.934\nBut let's talk about why and\nhow it works real quick.\n\n132\n00:06:39.934 --> 00:06:43.127\nAgain, they're not expecting to\ngo in the set up the DNSSEC and\n\n133\n00:06:43.127 --> 00:06:46.338\nexplain the protocol, or\nbreak it down in great detail.\n\n134\n00:06:46.338 --> 00:06:50.230\nBut we do need to know what it is and what\nit is used for and what we get out of it.\n\n135\n00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.490\nWhat are the benefits,\nwhy would I want to.\n\n136\n00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.490\nAnd we've talked about DNS, and\nwe've talked about some common attacks\n\n137\n00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:01.390\nthat take advantage of DNS, because DNS\nwas not a secure protocol, all right?\n\n138\n00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:05.140\nAgain, just been around for a long time,\nit was developed from functionality,\n\n139\n00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:09.340\ntook a higher priority than security.\n\n140\n00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.060\nSo with DNS, remember DNS or domain\nname system is the way your computer,\n\n141\n00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.370\nyour systems resolve\nnames into IP addresses.\n\n142\n00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.280\nWe know the computer systems\nconnect to IP addresses, not names.\n\n143\n00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.712\nBut we know, as human,\nit's a lot easier for\n\n144\n00:07:21.712 --> 00:07:23.888\nus to remember names than IP addresses.\n\n145\n00:07:23.888 --> 00:07:28.997\nSo we type in www.google.com,\nor Facebook.com or newegg.com.\n\n146\n00:07:28.997 --> 00:07:34.311\nBecause I can't remember that\nFacebook is 92.13.214.157.\n\n147\n00:07:34.311 --> 00:07:35.735\nJust not gonna be able to remember that.\n\n148\n00:07:35.735 --> 00:07:36.743\n&gt;&gt; I thought you just remembered that.\n\n149\n00:07:36.743 --> 00:07:38.123\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH] Well, I just made that up.\n\n150\n00:07:38.123 --> 00:07:41.075\nI just pulled that one out.\n\n151\n00:07:41.075 --> 00:07:45.235\nSo, DNS is what allows us to do that,\naccess resources by name.\n\n152\n00:07:45.235 --> 00:07:47.915\nIn the background, it's the phone\nbook that takes the name and\n\n153\n00:07:47.915 --> 00:07:49.885\nlooks up the number and\nactually connects to it.\n\n154\n00:07:49.885 --> 00:07:52.410\nThe problem is DNS was not real secure and\n\n155\n00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:55.520\nthere is a lot of attacks that can\nbe done taking advantage of that.\n\n156\n00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.530\nPeople can put bad information\non your DNS server.\n\n157\n00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:02.268\nAnd so if your DNS servers is\npassing out the wrong information,\n\n158\n00:08:02.268 --> 00:08:05.276\nthat means the client gets redirected\nto the wrong location, right?\n\n159\n00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:08.938\nFrom a bad guy, And\nI've got my fake Bank of America site, and\n\n160\n00:08:08.938 --> 00:08:12.720\nI want bad guys to come or\nI want victims to come to my site.\n\n161\n00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.850\nIf I can somehow tell DNS,\nhey, if somebody asks for\n\n162\n00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:20.260\nBank of America, give them this IP\naddress not the actual IP address, right?\n\n163\n00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.750\nAnd I can get people redirected.\n\n164\n00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:22.590\nThat's the kind of thing.\n\n165\n00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:25.200\nThat's pharming, right,\nwe've talked about pharming.\n\n166\n00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.480\nAnd this is the type of attack that can\nbe done by modifying those DNS records.\n\n167\n00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.070\nSo, the problem is,\n\n168\n00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:35.180\nI need to be able to validate\nthe answer that I'm getting from DNS.\n\n169\n00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:39.430\nCuz the bad guys, what they'll either do,\nis modify the DNS records themselves, so\n\n170\n00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:42.180\nthe DNS Servers passing\nout bad information, or\n\n171\n00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.390\nthey'll try to intercept your request.\n\n172\n00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.914\nIf your computer tries to talk to\nthe DNS Server to find out the IP address\n\n173\n00:08:47.914 --> 00:08:52.085\nof paypal.com, what I could do is kinda\nintercept that, and say hey, don't worry\n\n174\n00:08:52.085 --> 00:08:56.069\nabout asking the server, here's\nthe answer you're looking for, all right.\n\n175\n00:08:56.069 --> 00:08:59.286\nSo before you ever actually ask\nthe server, I've given you the answer,\n\n176\n00:08:59.286 --> 00:09:02.410\nit's just the wrong answer and\nits gonna lead you to a malicious site.\n\n177\n00:09:03.588 --> 00:09:10.120\nSo with DNSSEC, what we're really doing\nis digitally signing the DNS responses.\n\n178\n00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.590\nWhen that DNS Server\nresponds to your query,\n\n179\n00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:17.580\nyour question, with the IP address,\nit's going to be digitally signed.\n\n180\n00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:22.830\nYour computer then can validate that\nsignature and verify that the response,\n\n181\n00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:27.040\nthe answer that it's getting is\ncoming from the right DNS Server, and\n\n182\n00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:32.008\nnot a malicious DNS Server, and not some\nbad guy that's intercepting your request.\n\n183\n00:09:32.008 --> 00:09:34.340\nThat's what DNSSEC is all about.\n\n184\n00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.170\nIt uses public key encryption to do this.\n\n185\n00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:40.410\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nAnd what, public key encryption is?\n\n186\n00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.807\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we hadn't really\ntalked about it yet and we do.\n\n187\n00:09:43.807 --> 00:09:47.849\nWe're gonna talk about it in fact in\none of our next upcoming episodes, but\n\n188\n00:09:47.849 --> 00:09:51.828\npublic key cryptography is a form of\ncryptography that uses two keys, and\n\n189\n00:09:51.828 --> 00:09:55.760\nit allows me to validate who's\nactually doing the encryption.\n\n190\n00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.215\nSo when I get that response,\n\n191\n00:09:58.215 --> 00:10:01.775\nif I can validate who that\nresponse is coming from, right?\n\n192\n00:10:01.775 --> 00:10:05.235\nI can verify that it came\nfrom the authentic or\n\n193\n00:10:05.235 --> 00:10:08.295\nthe actual DNS Server that\nI'm supposed talking to.\n\n194\n00:10:08.295 --> 00:10:10.738\n&gt;&gt; Can we talk about protocol spoofing and\nwhat that is?\n\n195\n00:10:10.738 --> 00:10:15.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, protocol spoofing is\nwhen they try to take advantage\n\n196\n00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:20.390\nof the protocols and fake them out,\nI guess, spoof them.\n\n197\n00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:22.430\nLike there's different\ntypes of protocol spoofing.\n\n198\n00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:27.072\nWe might be talking about ARP spoofing,\nor IP spoofing, or DNS spoofing,\n\n199\n00:10:27.072 --> 00:10:30.626\nwhich is kind of what we were\njust talking about, right?\n\n200\n00:10:30.626 --> 00:10:31.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We're DNSSEC.\n\n201\n00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:36.260\nARP, for example,\nis Address Resolution Protocol.\n\n202\n00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.740\nAnd if you think back to\nyour basic networking\n\n203\n00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:42.280\nremember that when a packet\nis traveling across network,\n\n204\n00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:46.000\nrouter are what move that packet\nfrom one network to the other.\n\n205\n00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.550\nWhen it gets to the destination network,\n\n206\n00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:52.950\nall of a sudden we need to change\nthe IP address, into the MAC address.\n\n207\n00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:56.070\nThat's how it gets that\nfinal leg of delivery.\n\n208\n00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:58.749\nAddress Resolution Protocol\nis what does that.\n\n209\n00:10:58.749 --> 00:11:02.357\nWhen that packet gets to\nthe destination network we say, hey,\n\n210\n00:11:02.357 --> 00:11:05.773\nwhat's the MAC address of 192.168.10.14?\n\n211\n00:11:05.773 --> 00:11:08.930\nWell, that particular\ncomputer should respond, hey,\n\n212\n00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:11.823\nthat's my IP address,\nhere's my MAC address, and\n\n213\n00:11:11.823 --> 00:11:15.464\nwe can put that on the packet and\nget to the last leg of the journey.\n\n214\n00:11:15.464 --> 00:11:19.840\nWell, ARP spoofing is when\nI try to fake that, right.\n\n215\n00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.840\nIf I'm trying to do an attack,\nwhat I could do is try to say no, no, no,\n\n216\n00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.170\nthat's my Mac address,\n\n217\n00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:30.410\nsend that packet to me even though\nthat's not truly my MAC address.\n\n218\n00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:31.460\nThat's what ARP spoofing is.\n\n219\n00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:36.327\nProblem with ARP is it's, again another\none of those protocols that's not secure,\n\n220\n00:11:36.327 --> 00:11:39.783\nand it's done,\nARP resolution is done through broadcast.\n\n221\n00:11:39.783 --> 00:11:43.430\nAnd computers will cache any\nresponses that they hear.\n\n222\n00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:49.070\nSo even though nobody has asked, I can\nhaul around my IP address is 10.1.2.3 and\n\n223\n00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:51.140\nhere's my MAC address.\n\n224\n00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.450\nAll the computers that hear that\ncan cache that information.\n\n225\n00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.280\nAnd then later on they\ncan use that information.\n\n226\n00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.666\nThis is how we do\nman-in-the-middle attacks.\n\n227\n00:11:58.666 --> 00:12:03.420\nIf Zack is talking to a server and I wanna\nconvince Zack that I am the server he\n\n228\n00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:07.495\nwants to talk to and I need to\nconvince the server that I'm Zack,\n\n229\n00:12:07.495 --> 00:12:12.248\nI can get Zack's MAC address and then\ndo ARP spoofing to the server and say,\n\n230\n00:12:12.248 --> 00:12:15.650\nhey, no, that MAC address belongs to me.\n\n231\n00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:19.080\nAnd I do the same thing to Zack,\nI take that server's MAC address and\n\n232\n00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.230\nI spoof his computer.\n\n233\n00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:23.700\nI tell his computer that the server's\nMAC address is actually my network\n\n234\n00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:24.740\nadapter, right?\n\n235\n00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:29.020\nSo now, when Zack sends traffic to\nthe server, it's actually coming to me and\n\n236\n00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.100\nthen when the server responds to Zack,\nit's coming to me.\n\n237\n00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.640\nSo, all the traffic between Zack and\nthe server are flowing through me and\n\n238\n00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.050\nI can either just watch it go by and\nsteal information, or\n\n239\n00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:43.040\nI can even do an active man-in-the-middle\nattack where I modify that information.\n\n240\n00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.610\nBut it's all done through ARP poisoning.\n\n241\n00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:47.610\nSpoofing that ARP protocol.\n\n242\n00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:50.230\nDNS Spoofing.\n\n243\n00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:53.050\nWe just talked about that, so I don't\nneed to go into too much more in depth,\n\n244\n00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:56.480\nwe're talking about if\nI can intercept Zack's\n\n245\n00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.950\ncomputer is trying to look up\nthe IP address of newegg.com.\n\n246\n00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:05.340\nI see the request go out and as it's\ngoing to the DNS Server, I go ahead and\n\n247\n00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.780\nfake a response and\nsend it to Zack's computer.\n\n248\n00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:09.330\nI can beat the server, right?\n\n249\n00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.550\nI can respond quicker\nthan the server does and\n\n250\n00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:15.840\nthen Zack's computer will accept my\nanswer, that would be DNS spoofing.\n\n251\n00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.750\nI'm giving him the wrong IP address,\nall right?\n\n252\n00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:21.669\nTrying to do pharming for example.\n\n253\n00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:24.760\nAnother one would be IP address spoofing.\n\n254\n00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.275\nThis was very common when we had,\n\n255\n00:13:27.275 --> 00:13:31.140\nwhen all the firewalls we've\nran were simply packet filters.\n\n256\n00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.510\nThose 1st Gen firewalls.\n\n257\n00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:36.475\nThe only thing they could look at were\nsource and destination IP address, source\n\n258\n00:13:36.475 --> 00:13:40.458\nand destination port number, they could\nlook at protocol and that was about it.\n\n259\n00:13:40.458 --> 00:13:42.985\nThey couldn't look at anything else,\nand so\n\n260\n00:13:42.985 --> 00:13:46.188\nour rules were based on\nIP addresses primarily.\n\n261\n00:13:46.188 --> 00:13:49.920\nI mean it allow packets that come\nfrom this particular subnet or\n\n262\n00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.710\nfrom this particular range.\n\n263\n00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:56.430\nSo what I could do is get a program,\na little packet crafting utility, and\n\n264\n00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:59.466\nI could put a forged\nsource address in there.\n\n265\n00:13:59.466 --> 00:14:03.570\nA lot of techs what they would do is your\nfirewall, remember your firewall typically\n\n266\n00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:08.390\nwould be sitting on the border of your\nnetwork protecting you from the outside.\n\n267\n00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:11.350\nWell, as a bad guy what I need\nto do is get into your network.\n\n268\n00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.650\nBut I'm sitting outside your network.\n\n269\n00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:18.640\nSo I could forge a packet\nthat had one of your internal\n\n270\n00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:22.580\nIP addresses on it and send it into your\nfirewall and let it get onto your network.\n\n271\n00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:25.860\nAnd once it got onto your network it\nlooks like traffic from another node\n\n272\n00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.650\non your network cuz it's the same\nIP address range, all right.\n\n273\n00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:32.340\nAnd so\nthis is what we would do we would fake,\n\n274\n00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:35.280\nwe would forge the source\naddress on these packets.\n\n275\n00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:39.670\nNow, most firewalls nowadays are\nconfigured to where if you see an internal\n\n276\n00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:42.525\naddress coming from the outside\ninterface don't allow it,\n\n277\n00:14:42.525 --> 00:14:43.775\nthere's something fishy going on.\n\n278\n00:14:43.775 --> 00:14:47.875\nAnd so it's not a very common attack now,\nbut that doesn't mean IP spoofing is not.\n\n279\n00:14:47.875 --> 00:14:53.215\nIP spoofing is still used anywhere\nwe're using IP addresses as a way to\n\n280\n00:14:53.215 --> 00:14:58.285\nauthenticate or authorize or control\naccess, IP spoofing is a real possibility\n\n281\n00:14:58.285 --> 00:15:01.575\nand it's very easy for the bad guys\nto do with the certain utilities.\n\n282\n00:15:01.575 --> 00:15:07.620\nThey can create their own packets and put\na forged IP address in that source header.\n\n283\n00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.440\n&gt;&gt; Mike, what is network sniffing here?\n\n284\n00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.089\n&gt;&gt; It's,\nwe're not gonna be smelling the networks.\n\n285\n00:15:13.089 --> 00:15:14.049\n&gt;&gt; Thank goodness.\n\n286\n00:15:14.049 --> 00:15:17.434\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Network sniffing, [CROSSTALK] is a term\n\n287\n00:15:17.434 --> 00:15:22.553\nthat we used to when we were talking about\ncapturing raw data off of the network.\n\n288\n00:15:22.553 --> 00:15:26.940\nYou might hear it as packet capturing or\nnetwork monitoring.\n\n289\n00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.740\nNow this is the kind of thing we're doing,\nso when we talk about network sniffing,\n\n290\n00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:33.180\nwe're using some utility like Wireshark.\n\n291\n00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:37.836\nIt's probably the most common, or\none of the more common utilities used.\n\n292\n00:15:37.836 --> 00:15:42.727\nIt used to be called Ethereal, Network\nMonitor from Microsoft is another one,\n\n293\n00:15:42.727 --> 00:15:45.606\nthere's a lot of them out there.\n\n294\n00:15:45.606 --> 00:15:49.080\nWireshark is one of the more common ones,\nit's a freely available\n\n295\n00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.666\nwhich is a probably one of\nthe reason that we see it so often.\n\n296\n00:15:51.666 --> 00:15:56.920\nBut it do deals with capturing the raw\ntraffic as it travels across the network.\n\n297\n00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.375\nAnd as an admin for\na network this is a good thing.\n\n298\n00:15:59.375 --> 00:16:01.270\nI need to analyze what's\ngoing on my network.\n\n299\n00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:03.760\nSee what protocols are being used.\n\n300\n00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.917\nTake a look at the traffic\nthat's going back and forth.\n\n301\n00:16:05.917 --> 00:16:06.869\nBut as a bad guy,\n\n302\n00:16:06.869 --> 00:16:11.500\nthis means I could potentially see\ndata that I'm not authorized to see.\n\n303\n00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:16.089\nI can capture traffic that wasn't\ndestined for my computer, right?\n\n304\n00:16:16.089 --> 00:16:19.513\nIt's not stuff that's meant for\nme yet I'm able to capture that.\n\n305\n00:16:19.513 --> 00:16:21.140\nIt can be done in a wired network.\n\n306\n00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:25.210\nIt can also be done in a wireless network\nand even easier in a wireless network\n\n307\n00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:28.213\nbecause the packets are just,\nit's an unbound media.\n\n308\n00:16:28.213 --> 00:16:29.920\nThey're floating out in space.\n\n309\n00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.840\nIn a wired network, sniffing becomes\na little bit more difficult because I need\n\n310\n00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:37.500\nto get in the path of\nthe traffic that I wanna sniff.\n\n311\n00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.160\nAnd remember in today's networks,\n\n312\n00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.120\nalmost all networks nowadays\nare switched based Ethernet.\n\n313\n00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:47.610\nMeaning that every node has a point to\npoint connection back to the switch.\n\n314\n00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:49.780\nAnd so if I plug in to a port in the wall,\n\n315\n00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.970\nI've got a point to point\nconnection back to the switch.\n\n316\n00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:55.910\nAnd the only traffic that's coming out\nthat port is stuff that's destined for\n\n317\n00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:58.790\nmy computer, because that's what a switch\ndoes, he looks at the MAC address and\n\n318\n00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:00.600\nhe allows that traffic out that port.\n\n319\n00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.285\nSo if I'm sniffing traffic on a switched\nEthernet the only thing I see is traffic\n\n320\n00:17:04.285 --> 00:17:07.595\nthat was coming to me anyway so\nwhoop dee doo I'm not seeing a whole lot-\n\n321\n00:17:07.595 --> 00:17:08.491\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n322\n00:17:08.491 --> 00:17:10.308\n&gt;&gt; But we can get into what we call\n\n323\n00:17:10.308 --> 00:17:13.745\npromiscuous mode if your\nnetwork adapter supports it.\n\n324\n00:17:13.745 --> 00:17:14.856\n&gt;&gt; Promiscuous mode.\n\n325\n00:17:14.856 --> 00:17:16.168\n&gt;&gt; Promiscuous mode, yes.\n\n326\n00:17:16.168 --> 00:17:17.186\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n327\n00:17:17.186 --> 00:17:20.861\nthis allows me to capture traffic\nthat was not destined for me.\n\n328\n00:17:20.861 --> 00:17:24.429\nI still need to somehow get though in\nbetween where the traffic's actually\n\n329\n00:17:24.429 --> 00:17:25.410\noccurring.\n\n330\n00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:30.900\nSo I'll try to hook up to\na monitoring port on that switch,\n\n331\n00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:33.190\nor I'll try to hook in before the switch.\n\n332\n00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:37.423\nAll traffic is coming through there,\nand I'll be able to capture that.\n\n333\n00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:41.740\nLet me show you an example a real quick\nof what I mean by network sniffing.\n\n334\n00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.560\nSo I've got my Win 10 box here.\n\n335\n00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.511\nI'm gonna fire up Wireshark.\n\n336\n00:17:46.511 --> 00:17:51.087\nMy favorite packet capture utility but\nas I said thee are several out there.\n\n337\n00:17:51.087 --> 00:17:54.550\nAnd I'm also gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna go and\n\n338\n00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:58.543\nconnect to a shared folder\nover my domain controller.\n\n339\n00:17:58.543 --> 00:18:03.006\nAnd I'm going to start capturing packets.\n\n340\n00:18:03.006 --> 00:18:05.170\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nchoose my network adapter and\n\n341\n00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:07.580\nI'll zoom in here in a minute to\nshow you exactly what I'm doing.\n\n342\n00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.300\nRight now I'm just telling\nyou which network adaptor\n\n343\n00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.080\nI can have more than one in this machine.\n\n344\n00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.100\nWhich network adapter I wanna try\nto capture the traffic off of.\n\n345\n00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.710\nAnd I'll go ahead and click the shark\nfin to start that capture up.\n\n346\n00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:23.131\nAnd now that it's doing its thing I'm\ngonna go over here and grab a file and\n\n347\n00:18:23.131 --> 00:18:24.783\ncopy it over to my desk top.\n\n348\n00:18:24.783 --> 00:18:29.360\nAnd then I'm going to go ahead and\nlet's do a couple pings too, why don't we.\n\n349\n00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:33.920\nLet's say CMD and I'll ping DC01.\n\n350\n00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:37.617\nAnd that's not how you spell DCO1.\n\n351\n00:18:37.617 --> 00:18:39.462\n[LAUGH] Try that.\n\n352\n00:18:39.462 --> 00:18:41.734\nWe've got a few packets going there.\n\n353\n00:18:41.734 --> 00:18:43.440\nAnd we'll stop it.\n\n354\n00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:46.270\nWe'll exit out of that and\nwe'll stop my Packet Capture.\n\n355\n00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:49.150\nAnd again, remember, for this exam,\ndon't think you've gotta understand or\n\n356\n00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:52.990\ngo out and figure out exactly how to\nuse this tool, I mean it'd be great.\n\n357\n00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:56.380\nYou should know this at\nsome point in your career,\n\n358\n00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:00.260\nyou'll wanna play around with some\nnetwork pack of caps utilities.\n\n359\n00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:03.680\nBut what I wanted to show you,\nwas as we look at these,\n\n360\n00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:08.340\neach one of these lines is\nactually a packet, all right.\n\n361\n00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:10.560\nAnd so I can see things like source and\n\n362\n00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.930\ndestination IP address,\nwhat protocol is being used?\n\n363\n00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:18.520\nIn this case SMB or SMB version two,\nServer Message Block that's the protocol\n\n364\n00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.130\nwe used to connect to shares\nin a Windows environment.\n\n365\n00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:24.918\nTells me some info about it\nthen below there I can start\n\n366\n00:19:24.918 --> 00:19:29.546\nseeing things like the IP Field,\nthere's my source IP address,\n\n367\n00:19:29.546 --> 00:19:32.253\nthere's my destination IP address.\n\n368\n00:19:32.253 --> 00:19:35.157\nIf I look at TCP/IP I\ncan see my port numbers,\n\n369\n00:19:35.157 --> 00:19:39.000\nsource port 449918 that's a dynamic port.\n\n370\n00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.750\nDestination port 445 see things\nlike sequence numbers and flags and\n\n371\n00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.110\nall kinds of good stuff.\n\n372\n00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:47.885\nIf you wanna learn your protocols,\nthis is the way to do it,\n\n373\n00:19:47.885 --> 00:19:50.063\nplay around with the packet\ncapture utility.\n\n374\n00:19:50.063 --> 00:19:54.884\nBut what I wanna show you is as\nwe look down here, let's see.\n\n375\n00:19:54.884 --> 00:19:57.719\nI'm gonna keep going down to these\npackets and let me zoom back out so\n\n376\n00:19:57.719 --> 00:20:00.570\nI can see what's going on, and\nI'll zoom back in for you.\n\n377\n00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:03.050\nSo each one is packet just\nbasically my computer.\n\n378\n00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:07.180\nConnecting to the server, starting to\ntalk, saying hey I wanna connect to\n\n379\n00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:12.300\nthe share, well here's the directory,\ndisplay it in your file explorer.\n\n380\n00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.654\nBut what I wanna show you is right down,\n\n381\n00:20:15.654 --> 00:20:20.170\nlet's see, if I can find it.\n\n382\n00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:23.257\nThere it was right there, all right.\n\n383\n00:20:23.257 --> 00:20:24.738\nSo this read response,\n\n384\n00:20:24.738 --> 00:20:29.280\nthis is actually when the file is\nbeing sent back across the network.\n\n385\n00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:34.010\nRemember I copied it from the share to my\ndesktop which means I'm copying that file\n\n386\n00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:38.790\noff of the file server to my local machine\njust like you do every day at work, right?\n\n387\n00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:42.104\nBut let's take a look at what's\ngonna on in this packet capture.\n\n388\n00:20:42.104 --> 00:20:44.995\nYou see this right here where it says,\nLuke I am your father.\n\n389\n00:20:44.995 --> 00:20:48.461\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That is funny, I think so.\n\n390\n00:20:48.461 --> 00:20:49.810\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n391\n00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:50.740\n&gt;&gt; But that's what's in the file.\n\n392\n00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:52.670\nHold on, let me show you.\n\n393\n00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:54.180\nI open up this file.\n\n394\n00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.530\nThere's where it's getting that from.\n\n395\n00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:58.185\nThat is the data in the file, all right?\n\n396\n00:20:58.185 --> 00:21:03.053\nSo what I'm trying to show or what you're\nhopefully getting here is when we use\n\n397\n00:21:03.053 --> 00:21:07.702\nunsecure protocols and we transmit\ndata in plain text across the network,\n\n398\n00:21:07.702 --> 00:21:12.100\nanybody that can intercept\nthat data can read that data.\n\n399\n00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:16.616\nThis might have been Zach copying that\nfile from a file server down to his\n\n400\n00:21:16.616 --> 00:21:17.379\ncomputer.\n\n401\n00:21:17.379 --> 00:21:20.140\nAnd it might not have been\na silly line from a movie.\n\n402\n00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:24.950\nIt could have been payroll information or\ncompany proprietary information.\n\n403\n00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:29.920\nAnd if I'm running a network sniffer,\nI could potentially see all that data.\n\n404\n00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.220\nAnd that's why choosing a secure\nprotocol is so important.\n\n405\n00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:37.360\nUnderstanding what protocols\nare secure and which ones aren't and\n\n406\n00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:41.320\nusing the right one in the right\nplace is how we keep our data safe.\n\n407\n00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:43.062\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n408\n00:21:43.062 --> 00:21:46.934\n&gt;&gt; All right, so there's a quick little\nexample of a packet capture utility.\n\n409\n00:21:46.934 --> 00:21:48.937\nNext thing I wanna talk about and\n\n410\n00:21:48.937 --> 00:21:52.726\nthey do call out IPsec in this\nparticular set of objectives.\n\n411\n00:21:52.726 --> 00:21:56.570\nBut we've already talked about it\nquite a bit, so let's just refresh.\n\n412\n00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:58.920\nIPsec is Internet Protocol security,\n\n413\n00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:03.310\nit's a way that I can encrypt traffic\nas it travels across the network.\n\n414\n00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:05.635\n&gt;&gt; Question for you, Mr. Cotter?\n\n415\n00:22:05.635 --> 00:22:09.040\nCommon attack methods, let's maybe\nconclude the segment with that.\n\n416\n00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:09.690\n&gt;&gt; Okay, absolutely.\n\n417\n00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:12.617\nOne more thing I do wanna throw\nin though about the IPsec.\n\n418\n00:22:12.617 --> 00:22:15.172\nIf I had created an IPsec\ntunnel between me and\n\n419\n00:22:15.172 --> 00:22:18.334\nthat final server and\nthen copy that information down,\n\n420\n00:22:18.334 --> 00:22:23.085\nthat packet capture utility would not have\nbeen able to read what was in the packet.\n\n421\n00:22:23.085 --> 00:22:26.380\nIt see the packet and\nit would capture the packet and say, look,\n\n422\n00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:29.540\nit's coming from that file server,\nit's going to Mike's laptop, but\n\n423\n00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:32.870\nin the payload area, it wouldn't be\nable to display the information.\n\n424\n00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:36.199\nIt would just show gobbledygook\nbecause it would be encrypted.\n\n425\n00:22:36.199 --> 00:22:36.699\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n426\n00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.261\n&gt;&gt; All right, last thing we'll talk\nabout then, as Zach pointed out,\n\n427\n00:22:40.261 --> 00:22:41.535\nis good old common attack methods.\n\n428\n00:22:41.535 --> 00:22:44.529\nAnd some of these, we've already\ntalked about before, but again,\n\n429\n00:22:44.529 --> 00:22:47.071\nlet's refresh and\nmake sure we've gone over all of them.\n\n430\n00:22:47.071 --> 00:22:51.830\nThe first one is something called DOS or\nDDOS, double D, right?\n\n431\n00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:53.210\nDOS or DDOS.\n\n432\n00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:53.921\n&gt;&gt; Double D a?\n\n433\n00:22:53.921 --> 00:22:58.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, short for denial of service or\ndistributed denial of service.\n\n434\n00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:03.154\nAnd a denial of service attack is\nwhere we try to deny service, right?\n\n435\n00:23:03.154 --> 00:23:04.690\nWe're gonna attack a service.\n\n436\n00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:09.286\nRemember a service is something that runs\non the network that provides a service to\n\n437\n00:23:09.286 --> 00:23:13.433\nthe end users or the client machines or\nwhat have you like DNS is a service.\n\n438\n00:23:13.433 --> 00:23:16.828\nIt's just sitting there waiting for\nanybody to ask it hey what's the IP\n\n439\n00:23:16.828 --> 00:23:20.950\naddress of this computer and\nthat's it's job that's what it does.\n\n440\n00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:24.090\nDenial of service is when we\nattack that and try to make it so\n\n441\n00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:26.650\nbusy that it can't do it's normal job.\n\n442\n00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:29.640\nA lot of times we see this in web servers\nit's a very common attack against\n\n443\n00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:30.460\nwebsites.\n\n444\n00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.040\nA website like Newegg.\n\n445\n00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.830\nYou wanna go buy some computer products.\n\n446\n00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:38.710\nSo you type in www.newegg.com,\nyour request goes out to that web server,\n\n447\n00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:42.990\nthe web server sends the web page back and\nit’s displayed in your browser, all right?\n\n448\n00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:47.840\nHow many of you have been to a site\nthat seems a little slow, right?\n\n449\n00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.669\nIt could be like around Christmas time or\nholiday time,\n\n450\n00:23:50.669 --> 00:23:52.905\nsome of those sites get\na little bit slower.\n\n451\n00:23:52.905 --> 00:23:53.709\n&gt;&gt; Well, Amazon for that matter.\n\n452\n00:23:53.709 --> 00:23:55.072\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because they're busy, right?\n\n453\n00:23:55.072 --> 00:23:57.775\nYou have a lot of people\ntrying to use that site.\n\n454\n00:23:57.775 --> 00:24:01.871\nWe used to call it something called\na slash dotted Where you'd get mentioned\n\n455\n00:24:01.871 --> 00:24:06.415\nin a popular forum and your website would\nget hammered cuz everybody that's reading\n\n456\n00:24:06.415 --> 00:24:09.359\nthe forum is now trying to go\nto your site check it out and\n\n457\n00:24:09.359 --> 00:24:13.210\nyou get this huge surge in traffic\nthat you're not ready for.\n\n458\n00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:16.060\nWell, a denial of service is\nwhen they do that on purpose,\n\n459\n00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:20.770\nwhere I try to make that web server so\nbusy that it cannot do its normal job.\n\n460\n00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:24.610\nWe're gonna send, we're gonna flood\nthat web server with requests for\n\n461\n00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:29.030\nexample and make it so busy, but\na normal user that's trying to go to\n\n462\n00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:33.160\nthe website it not gonna be able to\nbecause the server just can't respond.\n\n463\n00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.430\nThat's known as a denial of service or\n\n464\n00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:39.920\nif I try to flood your network with IC and\nP traffic, so\n\n465\n00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:44.400\nthat normal traffic is getting slowed\ndown more and more and getting congested.\n\n466\n00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.447\nIt's like taking a highway and\ndumping 100,000 cars on there.\n\n467\n00:24:47.447 --> 00:24:50.445\nYou're just not gonna get where you're\nwanting to go because there's so\n\n468\n00:24:50.445 --> 00:24:51.860\nmuch traffic out there.\n\n469\n00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.230\nNow that's a denial of service.\n\n470\n00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:57.780\nTechnically unplugging your router would\nbe a denial of service on your network.\n\n471\n00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:01.220\nBecause the router can no longer do\nit's job because I've cut it's power,\n\n472\n00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:03.145\nphysical security trumps all else, right?\n\n473\n00:25:03.145 --> 00:25:04.390\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n474\n00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:05.660\n&gt;&gt; So that's a denial of service.\n\n475\n00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.910\nIt can be against, like I said,\nany number of different services.\n\n476\n00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:13.610\nA distributed denial of service\nis when we take the attack and\n\n477\n00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:17.560\nlaunch it for\nmore than one attacker, right.\n\n478\n00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.070\nHence we distribute the attack.\n\n479\n00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:24.580\nWhat bad guys found out was,\nif they wanted to attack a website,\n\n480\n00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:29.040\nthey wanted to bring them down, they\nneeded more horsepower than the other end.\n\n481\n00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:29.610\nRight?\n\n482\n00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:34.100\nBecause let's say I'm trying to\nflood a website with requests so\n\n483\n00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.250\nthat it's so busy it can't do its job.\n\n484\n00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:40.550\nWell if the website has more bandwidth\nthan I do, I'm trying to generate enough\n\n485\n00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:44.560\ntraffic to make that website so\nbusy that it can't do anything,\n\n486\n00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.510\nI'm gonna run out of bandwidth\nbefore the website does.\n\n487\n00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:50.440\nSo in a sense I'll end up doing\na denial of service on myself\n\n488\n00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.880\nbefore I do any damage to the website.\n\n489\n00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.250\nSo what I could do is say, all right, I\ngot your website, instead of you attacking\n\n490\n00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:59.670\nyou from one machine,\nI'm gonna attack you from five machines.\n\n491\n00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:04.347\nNow I got five guys ganging up on you,\nand maybe now, I can generate enough\n\n492\n00:26:04.347 --> 00:26:09.496\ntraffic to where you can't do your job,\nor not five, but 500 or 5,000.\n\n493\n00:26:09.496 --> 00:26:13.090\nThis is where you've heard of botnets or\nzombie farms.\n\n494\n00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:14.410\nThis is what the bad guys are doing.\n\n495\n00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:17.990\nWhat they do is they attack all these\nmachines out there in the world.\n\n496\n00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:19.380\nBusinesses just like yours and\n\n497\n00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:23.340\nours where the computers aren't in use\nat night but they're still connected.\n\n498\n00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:25.360\nAnd so they put malware on there.\n\n499\n00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.460\nMalware that doesn't do anything,\nyou don't suspect it's there.\n\n500\n00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:32.713\nBut in the middle of the night they can\nuse what's called an IRC channel to send\n\n501\n00:26:32.713 --> 00:26:35.330\nout a magic signal that\ngoes to all the thousands\n\n502\n00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:38.473\nof machines that they've\ninfected with this malware and\n\n503\n00:26:38.473 --> 00:26:42.215\nall of a sudden they all perk up and\nstart attacking the same victim.\n\n504\n00:26:42.215 --> 00:26:44.850\nThat would be a distributed\ndenial of service attack.\n\n505\n00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:47.260\n&gt;&gt; And the reason this is being\ndone is just to be malicious?\n\n506\n00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:48.520\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; That's the intent.\n\n507\n00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:51.690\n&gt;&gt; That is absolutely you know I'm\ntrying to bring down that website.\n\n508\n00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:54.423\nAnd the reasoning behind might vary.\n\n509\n00:26:54.423 --> 00:26:58.230\nIt might be that, you know, they test\nstuff on animals, and I'm against that.\n\n510\n00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:00.060\nSo, I'm gonna attack their website.\n\n511\n00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:01.750\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Or it might be that, you know,\n\n512\n00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:04.680\nthat company fired my father,\nI'm gonna attack their website.\n\n513\n00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:09.060\nSo, different reasonings behind terrorism,\nstate sponsored attacks, what have you.\n\n514\n00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.970\nBut in the end, a denial service and\ndistributed denial of service that is\n\n515\n00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:17.190\nthe end goal is to deny that from\ndoing what it's supposed to do.\n\n516\n00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:21.870\nThere's been attacks on the DNS servers\non the backbone on the Internet and\n\n517\n00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:25.530\nif they can bring those down\nname resolutions stops.\n\n518\n00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:28.790\nSo, yeah, it's a nasty thing,\nit really is.\n\n519\n00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:29.570\nAll right.\nLet's see if we can get\n\n520\n00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:30.260\nthrough the rest of these.\n\n521\n00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.390\nWe might go a hair over on our time, Zack,\n\n522\n00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:35.190\nbut not enough to really\nbreak out another episode.\n\n523\n00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:36.120\nSo\n&gt;&gt; That's good.\n\n524\n00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.370\nWe'll keep on trucking.\n\n525\n00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:38.230\n&gt;&gt; IP spoofing.\n\n526\n00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:39.180\nWe talked about that.\n\n527\n00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:44.260\nThis is how I might be able to bypass\ncertain security measures if I can pretend\n\n528\n00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.670\nmy IP address is something\nother than it is.\n\n529\n00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:50.740\nSo I can forge a packet, and\nput a fake source IP address in there.\n\n530\n00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:54.590\nNot the one I might actually have but\none that I know is on your allow list.\n\n531\n00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:57.135\nAnd I can try to get around\nsome of your security.\n\n532\n00:27:57.135 --> 00:28:00.030\nMan-in-the-middle attack,\nI've talked about that just a minute ago.\n\n533\n00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:04.340\nThis is where I get in between two\npeople that are having a conversation,\n\n534\n00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:07.340\ntwo nodes on a computer network\nthat are having a conversation.\n\n535\n00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:11.540\nAnd I can either just watch the traffic\ngo by and intercept valuable data,\n\n536\n00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:14.420\npotentially, or I could even modify.\n\n537\n00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:15.370\nZach's my boss,\n\n538\n00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:20.690\nI know he's getting ready to send\nan email to his boss, so I intercept it.\n\n539\n00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:21.890\nAnd I stop it.\n\n540\n00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:23.710\nAnd it says, Mike needs to be fired.\n\n541\n00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:25.750\nAnd I just change it, Mike needs a raise.\n\n542\n00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:26.740\nAnd I send it on, right?\n\n543\n00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:29.410\nThat'd be a man in the middle attack,\nall right?\n\n544\n00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:35.245\nBackdoor attacks, backdoors are ways\nthat we can bypass the security.\n\n545\n00:28:35.245 --> 00:28:40.265\nA lot of times, old programmers\nwould put back towards in so\n\n546\n00:28:40.265 --> 00:28:42.745\nthat if something happen with\nthe front door you know,\n\n547\n00:28:42.745 --> 00:28:45.375\nthe main authentication about that they\ncould still get in and fix things.\n\n548\n00:28:45.375 --> 00:28:48.650\nOr network admins do this all the time,\nthey have\n\n549\n00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:52.225\nbackdoors to get into their networks so\nthey can remotely manage, administer it.\n\n550\n00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:58.210\nBut a backdoor attack is when a bad guy\ntries to put a backdoor in your system,\n\n551\n00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:00.760\nwe talked about it when we\ntalked about trojan horses.\n\n552\n00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.831\nTypically, a trojan horse it\nmasquerades to something you want, but\n\n553\n00:29:03.831 --> 00:29:06.641\nit delivers something in\nthe background that you didn’t want,\n\n554\n00:29:06.641 --> 00:29:08.160\na lot of times that's a backdoor.\n\n555\n00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:11.759\nSomething that’s gonna call home, open up\na hole for the bad guys to get in, but\n\n556\n00:29:11.759 --> 00:29:15.120\nthrough the back and not through\nthe front door where all the security is.\n\n557\n00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:18.010\nDNS poisoning, we talked about that.\n\n558\n00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:21.630\nPutting fake information, or\nbad information on a DNS server, or\n\n559\n00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:23.780\nin a DNS cache.\n\n560\n00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:28.590\nReplay attacks, this where you're\ngoing to use a utility like Wireshark.\n\n561\n00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:32.800\nCapture a packet, and\nthen replay it later on.\n\n562\n00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:36.650\nI think I mentioned this, if Zach was\ntrying to authenticate to a server,\n\n563\n00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:40.749\nif I wanted to authenticate as Zach,\nI could break his username and password or\n\n564\n00:29:40.749 --> 00:29:43.357\nI can try to capture his\nauthentication traffic,\n\n565\n00:29:43.357 --> 00:29:47.581\nwait until he tries to make a connection,\ncapture his authentication traffic,\n\n566\n00:29:47.581 --> 00:29:52.020\nwait until later on in the day, And then\nreplay that authentication packet myself.\n\n567\n00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:55.518\nAnd maybe I can convinced the server,\nhey I'm Zach I got the right username and\n\n568\n00:29:55.518 --> 00:29:57.010\npassword and be a replay attack.\n\n569\n00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:01.130\nWeak encryption key,\nanother common attack.\n\n570\n00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:05.930\nWhen we think of something like WEP, and\nwe haven't really gone into encryption yet\n\n571\n00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:10.980\nthat's coming up here, but\nkeys are what we use along\n\n572\n00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:17.290\nwith encryption algorithm to provide\nuniqueness and strength to the encryption.\n\n573\n00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:22.290\nAnd if a particular encryption\nalgorithm uses weak or short keys.\n\n574\n00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:24.590\nThat means there's not\nthat many possibilities.\n\n575\n00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:28.868\nAnd if there's not that many\npossibilities, the bad guys can guess.\n\n576\n00:30:28.868 --> 00:30:31.509\nAnd they can try to figure\nout what the key will be, and\n\n577\n00:30:31.509 --> 00:30:33.320\nthey can break that encryption.\n\n578\n00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:36.760\nWe'll expand on that when we\ntalk about our encryption,\n\n579\n00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.230\nwhen we do our encryption episode.\n\n580\n00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:39.660\n&gt;&gt; So make sure you watch that one.\n\n581\n00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:41.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n582\n00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.680\nSocial engineering, this is when we try\nto take advantage of the human element.\n\n583\n00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:52.050\nWe try to convince a user, or a person, to\ngive up information that they shouldn't.\n\n584\n00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:54.640\nSocial engineering takes on many,\nmany, many forms.\n\n585\n00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.480\nWe'll talk about phishing, that's\nreally a form of social engineering.\n\n586\n00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:01.920\nMe, putting on a fake worksuit and\ngoing up to the front desk of your\n\n587\n00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:05.740\nbusiness saying hey,\nI'm here to repair the electrical system.\n\n588\n00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:07.350\nCan you let me in the server closet?\n\n589\n00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:08.980\nThat's social engineering.\n\n590\n00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:14.080\nMe calling you up on the phone and saying\nhey, this is JoJo from the helpdesk and\n\n591\n00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:17.580\nwe need your password so I can make sure\nyou get inputted into the new system.\n\n592\n00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:19.180\nRight, so that's social engineering.\n\n593\n00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:22.090\nTrying to convince somebody\nto give up information\n\n594\n00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:24.940\nthat they shouldn't be giving out.\n\n595\n00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:27.040\nTakes advantage of human nature.\n\n596\n00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.770\nWe want to be liked, we want to help.\n\n597\n00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:34.140\nLots of episodes in the course\nlibrary on social engineering.\n\n598\n00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:37.760\nSoftware vulnerability,\ntaking advantage of vulnerable software.\n\n599\n00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:41.150\nIf you're not patching your software,\nif you're not paying attention when they\n\n600\n00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:45.270\nput out updates for software, you could be\nrunning software that has vulnerabilities.\n\n601\n00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:48.830\nAnd so even though your network is secure,\nyour operating system is secure,\n\n602\n00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:53.735\nif you're not patching your software\nas well, then you're gonna be exposed.\n\n603\n00:31:53.735 --> 00:31:55.617\nNow, for overflows,\nwe've talked about that.\n\n604\n00:31:55.617 --> 00:31:58.917\nThat is when applications,\noperating systems included,\n\n605\n00:31:58.917 --> 00:32:01.690\nhave buffers that they\nuse to store information.\n\n606\n00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:05.356\nAnd if I can feed too much\ninformation into that buffer,\n\n607\n00:32:05.356 --> 00:32:07.462\nThat buffer will overflow, and\n\n608\n00:32:07.462 --> 00:32:13.156\nthen what'll happen is either the system\nwill crash, or the application will crash,\n\n609\n00:32:13.156 --> 00:32:17.696\nor potentially I could run malicious\ncode with system level access.\n\n610\n00:32:17.696 --> 00:32:20.570\nSQL injections,\nthis is an oldie but a goodie.\n\n611\n00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:25.949\nIt's been around for a long time, and\nit's still a very, very common attack,\n\n612\n00:32:25.949 --> 00:32:30.385\nbecause this is where a lot of\nwebsites nowadays are data driven.\n\n613\n00:32:30.385 --> 00:32:33.995\nIn other words when you go to a website,\nit reaches out and\n\n614\n00:32:33.995 --> 00:32:38.435\ntalks to a database to pull up information\nlike when you go to Newegg and\n\n615\n00:32:38.435 --> 00:32:41.390\nyou wanna see all\nthe motherboards they sell.\n\n616\n00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:45.330\nWell, it queries a database and it shows\nyou a list of all the motherboards their\n\n617\n00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:47.590\nfeatures, that are priced,\nthat are manufactured.\n\n618\n00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:49.430\nAll that's stored in a database.\n\n619\n00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:51.720\nIf your website is allowing user input,\n\n620\n00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:56.860\nmaybe you've got a form that they can fill\nout to create an account or what have you.\n\n621\n00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:00.710\nIf those forms are done properly,\nI could potentially type my own\n\n622\n00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:05.680\nSQL commands in that form and have\nthem executed against your SQL server.\n\n623\n00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.220\nNot what's intended.\n\n624\n00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:11.680\nBut if the code is not done properly and\nif there are not validation checks done\n\n625\n00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:15.860\non input forms, this is a very,\nvery real possibility.\n\n626\n00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:19.336\nAnd it's extremely dangerous\nbecause as a bad guy,\n\n627\n00:33:19.336 --> 00:33:24.392\nif I can submit SQL queries against\nyour database, I could potentially pull\n\n628\n00:33:24.392 --> 00:33:30.010\nback all the information that's in there,\nwipe out information, delete things.\n\n629\n00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:33.669\nIt's dangerous,\nit's a very bad, bad thing.\n\n630\n00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:36.012\nIt's really simple to prevent, [LAUGH] but\n\n631\n00:33:36.012 --> 00:33:39.201\nunfortunately sometimes when\nwe create these web pages,\n\n632\n00:33:39.201 --> 00:33:43.709\nsecurity is not at the forefront, and\nit's not something that they think about.\n\n633\n00:33:44.788 --> 00:33:49.920\nBut anyway SQL Injection is when I\ninject SQL commands into a website\n\n634\n00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:53.160\nin hopes that it will get\nexecuted by your SQL server.\n\n635\n00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:56.603\nAnd the last one on the list\nis Cross-Site Scripting.\n\n636\n00:33:56.603 --> 00:34:01.648\nAnd Cross-Site Scripting is a way that\nthe bad guy, if I want to attack you,\n\n637\n00:34:01.648 --> 00:34:06.710\nrather than attack you directly, I will\nattack a web server that you are known to\n\n638\n00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:11.760\nfrequent and\nI can put malicious code on the website.\n\n639\n00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:15.900\nIf I can find a vulnerable web server,\nI can put my malicious code up there and\n\n640\n00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:18.750\nthen wait for people to visit\nthe website and when they download\n\n641\n00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:23.150\nthe web pages like normal it's\ndownloading the malicious code as well.\n\n642\n00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:27.490\nAnd that's getting executed and\nbeing run on that victim's machine.\n\n643\n00:34:27.490 --> 00:34:29.532\nThis is what's called\nCross-Site Scripting.\n\n644\n00:34:29.532 --> 00:34:33.451\nI think way back in one of our beginning\nepisodes, I talked about how it's no\n\n645\n00:34:33.451 --> 00:34:37.490\nlonger where if as long as you don't\nclick on something you're safe.\n\n646\n00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:40.805\nNowadays, just visiting a website,\nyou can infect your machine.\n\n647\n00:34:40.805 --> 00:34:44.809\nCross-Site Scripting is one of,\nin fact, this one makes the top ten.\n\n648\n00:34:44.809 --> 00:34:45.825\nIt's been in the top ten.\n\n649\n00:34:45.825 --> 00:34:48.249\nThere's a place called\nOWASP that records or\n\n650\n00:34:48.249 --> 00:34:51.428\nkeeps tracks of all the different attacks.\n\n651\n00:34:51.428 --> 00:34:56.150\nAnd Cross-Site Scripting, I would say,\nin the top five in the last several years.\n\n652\n00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:57.580\nIt is a very, very common attack.\n\n653\n00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:01.200\n&gt;&gt; In fact, I remember an IT\nguru that I used to listen to.\n\n654\n00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.130\nI knew him well.\n\n655\n00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:04.950\nBut he said he doesn't go on the Internet.\n\n656\n00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:05.802\nHe simply doesn't do it.\n\n657\n00:35:05.802 --> 00:35:06.681\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n658\n00:35:06.681 --> 00:35:09.435\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's not enough security you can\n\n659\n00:35:09.435 --> 00:35:12.897\nbuild around, but of course he was\nalso a governing a huge network,\n\n660\n00:35:12.897 --> 00:35:14.920\nin a company we've all both belong to.\n\n661\n00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:19.542\n&gt;&gt; It is scary out there, you don't want\nto put the fear in humanity, and say,\n\n662\n00:35:19.542 --> 00:35:21.745\nnever going in the Internet again.\n\n663\n00:35:21.745 --> 00:35:23.733\nAlmost like saying, hey don't drive a car.\n\n664\n00:35:23.733 --> 00:35:26.382\nThere's risk you have when\nyou get in the automobile,\n\n665\n00:35:26.382 --> 00:35:28.890\nthere's risks being out there on the road.\n\n666\n00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:30.940\nBut the benefits hopefully\nout weigh the risk.\n\n667\n00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:32.250\nIt's the same thing here.\n\n668\n00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:36.340\nYeah, the Internet can be a scary place,\nbut if we follow common sense.\n\n669\n00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:40.750\nIf we follow best practices we can really\nkeep ourselves and our network safe.\n\n670\n00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:41.690\n&gt;&gt; Protocol security.\n\n671\n00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:43.020\nGreat episode as usual Mike.\n\n672\n00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:45.000\nThanks for all the wonderful information.\n\n673\n00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.360\nMTA Security Fundamentals.\n\n674\n00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:50.490\nThere's a lot of episodes in this series,\nmake sure you watch them

00:00:12.228\n&gt;&gt; Your watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.228 --> 00:00:16.998\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you again for making\nthat intelligent choice to watch ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:16.998 --> 00:00:19.080\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.639\nI'm your host Zach Memos we're continuing\non with MTA Security Fundamentals.\n\n7\n00:00:23.639 --> 00:00:27.820\nAnd today, we’re talking about client\nprotection, that could even mean you.\n\n8\n00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.170\nAnd who’s bringing you the information but\n\n9\n00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.040\nour very own Mike Rodrick right here,\nhello sir.\n\n10\n00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.565\n&gt;&gt; Hi, Zach,\nhow’s everybody doing out there?\n\n11\n00:00:33.565 --> 00:00:37.130\nHope you doing well on this fantastic day.\n\n12\n00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.430\nAnd yeah, you’re right, we’re gonna be\ntalking about client protection, right?\n\n13\n00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.070\nSome of the stuff we’ve already\nhinted at in other episodes, so\n\n14\n00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.570\nit might be a little bit of a rehash.\n\n15\n00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.470\nBut hearing things more than once\nis always a good thing, right?\n\n16\n00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.260\nThat's why you can go back to our library\nand watch this stuff any time you want.\n\n17\n00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.530\nAs many times as you want.\n\n18\n00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.815\n&gt;&gt; Or as they say [FOREIGN]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I like that.\n\n19\n00:00:56.815 --> 00:01:00.070\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So lets define client protection.\n\n20\n00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.500\nHow can we ensure client protection?\n\n21\n00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.560\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question.\n\n22\n00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.620\nAnd first lets make sure we understand\nwhen we say client we're talking about\n\n23\n00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.000\na client operating system.\n\n24\n00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.650\nThis is one that you would run on your\ncomputer at home or on your laptop or\n\n25\n00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.290\non your computer at work.\n\n26\n00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.280\nA client operating systems are meant for\ndaily use.\n\n27\n00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.960\nThey really put most of their power\nin whatever application you're\n\n28\n00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.620\ncurrently running.\n\n29\n00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.911\nSo like when you open up a program,\n\n30\n00:01:24.911 --> 00:01:27.999\nit gets most of the resources\ndelivered to it.\n\n31\n00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:30.280\nAgain, it's meant to be a daily driver.\n\n32\n00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.650\nVersus a server operating system\nwhich is very, very similar, but\n\n33\n00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.380\nservers are really designed to provide\nservices and run things in the background.\n\n34\n00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.550\nWe don't sit at a server everyday and\nsurf the internet and check our e-mail.\n\n35\n00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.330\nBut in the background, on a server, it's\nperforming things like DHC, and DHCP, and\n\n36\n00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.830\nDNS, and Active Directory, right?\n\n37\n00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.870\nBackground services are what gets\nthe majority of the resources\n\n38\n00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:53.900\nas it is on servers.\n\n39\n00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.750\nBut, so now we know what a client is,\na client operating system.\n\n40\n00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.508\nAnd it is very important that we\nkeep these protected because they\n\n41\n00:02:02.508 --> 00:02:04.331\nare where our users sit.\n\n42\n00:02:04.331 --> 00:02:08.987\nAnd they're one of those things that gets\nexposed a lot to the dangerous parts of\n\n43\n00:02:08.987 --> 00:02:09.830\nour network.\n\n44\n00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.420\nThey go out to the internet so they can be\nexpose to many things out there untrusted\n\n45\n00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.870\nnetwork laptops move,\na server sits in my network and\n\n46\n00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.602\nit never leaves there, it remains in\nthat trusted confine of my network.\n\n47\n00:02:22.602 --> 00:02:26.940\nWhereas your laptop is at work,\nbut then it goes to Starbucks, or\n\n48\n00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.150\nto McDonald's, or\nto some other hotel hotspot, right?\n\n49\n00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.980\nThese untrusted networks\npicking up who knows what,\n\n50\n00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.140\nand then coming back to my network or\nour network and plugging in, and\n\n51\n00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.070\npossibly bringing things\nin that we didn't want.\n\n52\n00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.730\nSo, client protection is\nobviously very important.\n\n53\n00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.690\nWe've got users surfing the Internet,\nchecking emails,\n\n54\n00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.440\nclicking on links maybe they shouldn't\nclick on, installing software.\n\n55\n00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.628\nSo, very important that we protect them.\n\n56\n00:02:49.628 --> 00:02:54.989\nNow, your question then, how do we\nprovide this level of protection?\n\n57\n00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.024\nSeveral ways that we can,\n\n58\n00:02:57.024 --> 00:03:02.460\nthat we want to make sure we\nare providing adequate protection.\n\n59\n00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.150\nFirst and foremost, is probably, well,\nmaybe I won't say first and foremost,\n\n60\n00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.490\nbut one important thing is\nantivirus software, righ?\n\n61\n00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.440\nWe spent some time on malware, we talked\nabout the different classes of malware,\n\n62\n00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.170\nviruses, worms, trojans, all that fun\nstuff, right, all that dangerous stuff.\n\n63\n00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.040\nAntivirus software is software that's\nmeant to protect us from that.\n\n64\n00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.870\nHopefully prevent it, if not prevent it,\ndetect it, quarantine it,\n\n65\n00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.090\nprevent it from spreading and\ninfecting anything else on our machine.\n\n66\n00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.960\nAnd then possible removing that.\n\n67\n00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.460\nSo, running good antivirus\nsoftware is extremely important.\n\n68\n00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.814\nWe almost can't run without it nowadays or\nyou're really at risk.\n\n69\n00:03:41.814 --> 00:03:45.196\nZach, it's funny, years ago, decade ago,\n\n70\n00:03:45.196 --> 00:03:50.595\nI wouldn't run anti virus software\nbecause it would slow my system down.\n\n71\n00:03:50.595 --> 00:03:51.922\nIt took a lot of resources.\n\n72\n00:03:51.922 --> 00:03:53.455\n&gt;&gt; You're talking about the n word, right?\n\n73\n00:03:53.455 --> 00:03:57.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it would be kind of clunky.\n\n74\n00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.320\nAnd I knew that as long as I\ndidn't go to bad websites,\n\n75\n00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.150\ndownload things I didn't trust, click\non links in e-mails I was pretty safe.\n\n76\n00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.410\nThat's not the case anymore today.\n\n77\n00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.140\nWe get drive by infections.\n\n78\n00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.240\nWe can visit a website, not do anything,\njust open up a website and\n\n79\n00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.120\nit can infect us.\n\n80\n00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.858\nWe can open up an email and\nit can infect our system.\n\n81\n00:04:14.858 --> 00:04:17.991\nWe can open up a Word document and\nit can infect our system.\n\n82\n00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:20.816\nSo anti-virus is very important.\n\n83\n00:04:20.816 --> 00:04:22.432\nIt doesn't matter which one.\n\n84\n00:04:22.432 --> 00:04:25.938\nThat's something that you or\nyour organization is going to decide.\n\n85\n00:04:25.938 --> 00:04:29.220\nBut there are some things that we need\nto do when we run anti-virus software.\n\n86\n00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.648\nThe one thing is, make sure it's installed\nand then two keep it up to date.\n\n87\n00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:37.618\nRight, because anti-virus software,\nit's changing a little bit, But\n\n88\n00:04:37.618 --> 00:04:40.463\na lot of anti-virus software\nworks on definitions.\n\n89\n00:04:40.463 --> 00:04:45.138\nIn other words, these anti-virus vendors,\nlike Semantec, or\n\n90\n00:04:45.138 --> 00:04:47.770\nNorton or McAfee or whomever.\n\n91\n00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.422\nThey sell you their product, and\n\n92\n00:04:49.422 --> 00:04:52.969\nthen their product relies on definitions\nthat you download from them.\n\n93\n00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:57.672\nAnd as new viruses and malware is\ndiscovered, they write new definitions so\n\n94\n00:04:57.672 --> 00:05:01.960\nthat their program will know\nwhat to look for and stop it.\n\n95\n00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.380\nBut if you're not getting\nthose new definitions,\n\n96\n00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.280\nthen your program's not\ngonna be able to identify\n\n97\n00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.610\nthose new types of malware that\nare coming out on a daily basis.\n\n98\n00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:12.640\nSo when I say keep it up to date,\n\n99\n00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.590\nI don't mean once a month go update your\nprogram, your antivirus application.\n\n100\n00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.920\nIt should be updated on a daily basis.\n\n101\n00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.320\nIn some environments, more than once\na day is actually not too much.\n\n102\n00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.280\nSo keeping it up to date\nis extremely important.\n\n103\n00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.270\n&gt;&gt; And I need to define something when\nI said, in word I've referring to,\n\n104\n00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.000\nthe early versions of a certain\nproduct made by a certain company, and\n\n105\n00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.620\nnow it's much, much better of course.\n\n106\n00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Norton I think is the,\nwe can say them.\n\n107\n00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:40.532\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good.\n\n108\n00:05:40.532 --> 00:05:42.077\n&gt;&gt; I will give them all credit.\n\n109\n00:05:42.077 --> 00:05:46.140\nThe other thing we want to make sure we\nhave in a good anti-virus application.\n\n110\n00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.511\nIs real time protection, right?\n\n111\n00:05:48.511 --> 00:05:52.691\nReal time protection means it's\ngonna analyze things as they happen,\n\n112\n00:05:52.691 --> 00:05:54.580\nrather than after they happen.\n\n113\n00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.600\nIt's okay, it's still better than nothing.\n\n114\n00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.930\nIf it finds something\nafter it's infected you,\n\n115\n00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.050\nthat's good, quarantine and get rid of it.\n\n116\n00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.200\nBut I'd really like it to\nwatch things as they happen.\n\n117\n00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.520\nFiles I download?\n\n118\n00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.220\nScan it.\n\n119\n00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.428\nBefore I even get to open it,\nlet me know if it's a bad thing.\n\n120\n00:06:09.428 --> 00:06:12.331\nAnd that's what's called\nreal time protection, and\n\n121\n00:06:12.331 --> 00:06:17.100\nmost anti-virus software today does\nreal time protection if we turn it on.\n\n122\n00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.855\n&gt;&gt; Question, is the virus hoax a thing?\n\n123\n00:06:19.855 --> 00:06:21.021\nI've seen it.\n\n124\n00:06:21.021 --> 00:06:22.729\n&gt;&gt; I've seen which is-\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you've got a virus but\n\n125\n00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:23.780\nthere really wasn't one.\n\n126\n00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:24.900\nWhat is that all about?\n\n127\n00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.161\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, hoax is just that,right.\n\n128\n00:06:27.161 --> 00:06:29.940\nA virus hoax is not really a virus.\n\n129\n00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.600\nIt could be an e-mail, a phone call or\n\n130\n00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.351\nanything like that where\nthey say you're infected.\n\n131\n00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:38.426\nI've seen a couple of pop-up windows.\n\n132\n00:06:38.426 --> 00:06:41.016\nI've had to deal with people who say yeah,\nI've got this window and\n\n133\n00:06:41.016 --> 00:06:42.482\nit tells me that I've been infected.\n\n134\n00:06:42.482 --> 00:06:46.433\nI've got 432 pieces of malware on my\nsystem, please buy our software and\n\n135\n00:06:46.433 --> 00:06:48.600\nwe'll help you get rid of it, right?\n\n136\n00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.465\nYou're not infected, it's a hoax but\n\n137\n00:06:50.465 --> 00:06:56.010\nthey're trying to get you to purchase\ntheir software or it's an email that says,\n\n138\n00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:00.370\nhey look this is your help desk, and\nyour machine is potentially infected.\n\n139\n00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.048\nLook on your hard drive if you have\nthis file, delete it, and call us.\n\n140\n00:07:04.048 --> 00:07:07.760\nThey're trying to trick you into deleting\nimportant system files that would keep\n\n141\n00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.090\nyour system running.\n\n142\n00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:10.312\nSo, those are hoaxes.\n\n143\n00:07:10.312 --> 00:07:15.335\nIt's crazy to think that a hoax can be\njust as dangerous as an actual virus,\n\n144\n00:07:15.335 --> 00:07:16.304\nbut they can.\n\n145\n00:07:16.304 --> 00:07:19.832\nLike I said, they can get you to delete\nfiles that you shouldn't be deleting,\n\n146\n00:07:19.832 --> 00:07:21.770\nthey can get you to try to buy things.\n\n147\n00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:24.380\nThey can just steal your credit card\ninformation when you attempt to buy it.\n\n148\n00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:25.548\nYou're not actually buying anything,\n\n149\n00:07:25.548 --> 00:07:28.580\nyour'e just giving them your\ncredit card information.\n\n150\n00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.220\nThey can cause email floods as users\ntry to help other users and say, hey,\n\n151\n00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:32.880\ndid you see this?\n\n152\n00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.500\nCheck your computer, things like that.\n\n153\n00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.600\nThey can be a mess.\n\n154\n00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.960\nSo hoaxes can be just as bad.\n\n155\n00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:43.960\nNow, before we move on, I do wanna\ntake a look at an anti-virus solution.\n\n156\n00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.330\nI'm gonna pull up my Windows 10 box here.\n\n157\n00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:52.875\nAnd Microsoft Windows 10 comes with\na free built-in antivirus solution.\n\n158\n00:07:52.875 --> 00:07:55.535\nSo I am going to open that up.\n\n159\n00:07:55.535 --> 00:07:57.000\nAnd it's telling me that I'm in danger.\n\n160\n00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.142\nLet's see what we got going on here.\n\n161\n00:08:00.142 --> 00:08:02.202\nSo this is known as Windows Defender.\n\n162\n00:08:02.202 --> 00:08:07.099\nNow, Windows Defender actually\ncame out A few versions ago,\n\n163\n00:08:07.099 --> 00:08:10.430\nand originally, it was anti-spyware.\n\n164\n00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:13.618\nAll it did was try to protect\nyou from spyware and malware,\n\n165\n00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:16.883\nand you needed something else\nto protect you from viruses.\n\n166\n00:08:16.883 --> 00:08:19.086\nMicrosoft came out with\nSecurity Essentials,\n\n167\n00:08:19.086 --> 00:08:22.110\nwhich was a free antivirus\nsolution that you could use.\n\n168\n00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:26.240\nWith Windows 10, Windows Defender and\nMicrosoft Essentials have now been\n\n169\n00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.047\ncombined, and\nthey just call it Windows Defender.\n\n170\n00:08:29.047 --> 00:08:31.995\nSo Windows Defender is\na full-blown antivirus or\n\n171\n00:08:31.995 --> 00:08:35.372\nanti-malware, is probably a better term,\nsolution.\n\n172\n00:08:35.372 --> 00:08:37.270\nNow let's take a look at some\nof the settings in here.\n\n173\n00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:41.642\nEach anti-malware, antivirus solution\nis gonna be slightly different, but\n\n174\n00:08:41.642 --> 00:08:44.914\nthey're all gonna have kind\nof the same concepts, right?\n\n175\n00:08:44.914 --> 00:08:47.351\nThis Home tab shows me Current status.\n\n176\n00:08:47.351 --> 00:08:49.775\nAnd see that real time\nprotection is turned on.\n\n177\n00:08:49.775 --> 00:08:51.085\nI'm gonna zoom in there for you.\n\n178\n00:08:51.085 --> 00:08:55.239\nBut my definitions are out of date and\nit's giving me a big bad warning.\n\n179\n00:08:55.239 --> 00:09:00.203\nNow this is a virtual machine that doesn't\nhave network access so it's isolated, and\n\n180\n00:09:00.203 --> 00:09:02.800\nI'm not worried about that for\nmy labs here.\n\n181\n00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.285\nBut if this were an actual user's machine\nor my machine, this would concern me very\n\n182\n00:09:07.285 --> 00:09:11.510\nmuch and first thing I would do was\nmake sure I went out and got my updates.\n\n183\n00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:12.068\nAnd then,\n\n184\n00:09:12.068 --> 00:09:16.172\nI wanna figure out why it had been seven\ndays since I've gotten those updates.\n\n185\n00:09:16.172 --> 00:09:17.610\nSomething is wrong.\n\n186\n00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.966\nAlso, I can see over here on the right,\nthe ability to do some scans.\n\n187\n00:09:20.966 --> 00:09:22.650\nI wanna do a quick scan.\n\n188\n00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:26.014\nThis will usually check areas that\nare most commonly infected rather than\n\n189\n00:09:26.014 --> 00:09:27.597\nscan your entire your hard drive.\n\n190\n00:09:27.597 --> 00:09:30.170\nSo it's a little bit faster,\nbut not as thorough.\n\n191\n00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:34.072\nYou can do a full scan, which scans\nyour entire hard drive, everything.\n\n192\n00:09:34.072 --> 00:09:35.337\nIt can take a long time, but\n\n193\n00:09:35.337 --> 00:09:38.240\nit's definitely something\nyou should do initially.\n\n194\n00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.403\nDo a sweep of your entire machine,\nmake sure you're clean.\n\n195\n00:09:41.403 --> 00:09:44.321\nAnd then, periodically, especially if\nyou think something is wrong, all right?\n\n196\n00:09:44.321 --> 00:09:46.600\nIf you see symptoms of an infection.\n\n197\n00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.820\nWe'll come back to that concept\nof symptoms here in a second-\n\n198\n00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:49.845\n&gt;&gt; Especially if you're buying\n\n199\n00:09:49.845 --> 00:09:50.667\na pre-owned machine.\n\n200\n00:09:50.667 --> 00:09:52.559\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n201\n00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:56.147\nAnd then Custom,\nI can go scan particular files.\n\n202\n00:09:56.147 --> 00:09:58.873\nI've done this before where\nI've downloaded something but\n\n203\n00:09:58.873 --> 00:10:01.260\nI'm not quite sure about,\nwho I got it from?\n\n204\n00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.435\nSo before I open that zip file or\ndouble-click on that file,\n\n205\n00:10:04.435 --> 00:10:06.688\nI'm gonna come in here, do a custom scan.\n\n206\n00:10:06.688 --> 00:10:09.323\nPoint it to that folder, or that file, and\n\n207\n00:10:09.323 --> 00:10:13.070\nhave it scan it real quick just\nto see if it detects anything.\n\n208\n00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.929\nOn my updates tab I can see when\nmy updates were last done, and\n\n209\n00:10:16.929 --> 00:10:19.502\nyou can see I am a little bit behind here,\n\n210\n00:10:19.502 --> 00:10:23.290\nI am almost a week out of date\nwhich is not a good thing.\n\n211\n00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:26.575\nAnd it's telling me, hey this is bad,\nyou need to go update, and so\n\n212\n00:10:26.575 --> 00:10:28.201\nI should update my definitions.\n\n213\n00:10:28.201 --> 00:10:33.573\nThere's also a History tab on this one,\nand it can show me my quarantined items,\n\n214\n00:10:33.573 --> 00:10:38.480\nitems that it has found and then removed\nor moved off to a secure location.\n\n215\n00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.144\nAnd it does this,\nit doesn't immediately remove them,\n\n216\n00:10:41.144 --> 00:10:44.925\nalthough we can configure that, because\nit might have misdetected something.\n\n217\n00:10:44.925 --> 00:10:47.439\nSo it's given us a chance to\ngo look at it, and say hey,\n\n218\n00:10:47.439 --> 00:10:49.212\nis this something you want to remove?\n\n219\n00:10:49.212 --> 00:10:51.336\nI'll tell you that in the security field,\n\n220\n00:10:51.336 --> 00:10:55.560\nI have a ton of tools that most anti-virus\napplications will try to remove.\n\n221\n00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:00.288\nSo I have a folder that I've set aside for\nthose tools ,I know they're good.\n\n222\n00:11:00.288 --> 00:11:03.370\nAnd I've told my anti-virus program\nto hey, leave that folder alone.\n\n223\n00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.146\nSo sometimes they do make mistakes,\n\n224\n00:11:05.146 --> 00:11:08.832\nbut I'd rather it get something by\nmistake than missed something, right?\n\n225\n00:11:08.832 --> 00:11:09.690\nAlways better.\n\n226\n00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:14.602\nSo that's a typical anti-virus\nsolution that's got options in here\n\n227\n00:11:14.602 --> 00:11:19.070\nwhere I can go in and turn on or\noff real-time protection.\n\n228\n00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:23.068\nThis one Microsoft Windows Defender\nnow includes Cloud based protection,\n\n229\n00:11:23.068 --> 00:11:26.327\nwhich we're seeing more and\nmore anti-virus solutions do.\n\n230\n00:11:26.327 --> 00:11:29.890\nYou can do sample submissions so\nthey can see what they found.\n\n231\n00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:33.080\nYou can add exclusions,\nlike I said, my Tools folder.\n\n232\n00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.490\nEach one will have some\ndifferent options available.\n\n233\n00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:39.564\nSo, anti-virus,\nreally should call it anti-malware,\n\n234\n00:11:39.564 --> 00:11:43.804\nI'm sure we will at some point,\nis a must-have, all right?\n\n235\n00:11:43.804 --> 00:11:46.802\nAll right,\nthe next thing I wanna talk about here,\n\n236\n00:11:46.802 --> 00:11:50.100\nprotecting against unwanted\nsoftware installation.\n\n237\n00:11:53.617 --> 00:11:57.818\nI was trying to give a good way to talk\nabout this, and I often think back to my\n\n238\n00:11:57.818 --> 00:12:01.776\nfolks, and some of the things I've\nhad to deal with helping out them.\n\n239\n00:12:01.776 --> 00:12:05.143\nWhen we talk about unwanted\nsoftware installation,\n\n240\n00:12:05.143 --> 00:12:08.449\nusually what we're referring\nto here is add-ons.\n\n241\n00:12:08.449 --> 00:12:12.880\nLet's say I go and download a program\nfrom the Internet and I go to install it.\n\n242\n00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.084\nAnd it installs that program but\n\n243\n00:12:15.084 --> 00:12:19.664\nit also installs a toolbar in my browser,\nor an extra little tool.\n\n244\n00:12:19.664 --> 00:12:27.050\nA tittle freebie that it throws along with\nit, that's unwanted, typically, software.\n\n245\n00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:31.198\nAnd so, what we have to remember is that\none, free typically isn't free, all right?\n\n246\n00:12:31.198 --> 00:12:34.640\nIf they're giving you something free\nthey've gotta get paid somehow, and\n\n247\n00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:38.120\nthat's usually through advertisement or\nselling your information.\n\n248\n00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.974\nHey, you can download this for free,\njust give us your email address.\n\n249\n00:12:40.974 --> 00:12:41.818\nWell, okay, yeah.\n\n250\n00:12:41.818 --> 00:12:43.580\nWell, guess what they're gonna\ndo with your email address.\n\n251\n00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.992\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, back in the day, this is when\nI would choose gateway go back, mm-hm.\n\n252\n00:12:46.992 --> 00:12:49.001\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly right.\n\n253\n00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:53.442\nSo, understand that when they\ngive you something free,\n\n254\n00:12:53.442 --> 00:12:56.687\nthere's a catch somewhere most likely.\n\n255\n00:12:56.687 --> 00:12:59.415\nMake sure you're getting your\nsoftware from trusted sites,\n\n256\n00:12:59.415 --> 00:13:01.980\nsome place that you've\ngotten stuff from before.\n\n257\n00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:03.761\nCheck out reviews on it.\n\n258\n00:13:03.761 --> 00:13:09.729\nNo fly-by-night sites that offer all\nthis amazing free stuff for no cost.\n\n259\n00:13:09.729 --> 00:13:12.830\nYeah, there's probably a catch there,\nespecially on your work machines.\n\n260\n00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:17.468\nTypically you might not be an\nadministrator anyway and install software,\n\n261\n00:13:17.468 --> 00:13:19.683\nbut if you are you need to make sure.\n\n262\n00:13:19.683 --> 00:13:22.122\nCheck with your help desk, your IT staff.\n\n263\n00:13:22.122 --> 00:13:24.380\nSay hey,\nis it okay if I install this program?\n\n264\n00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:27.764\nGive them a chance to look at it,\nresearch it and see what it's gonna do.\n\n265\n00:13:27.764 --> 00:13:31.879\nBecause some of these programs you get,\nhave back doors in them, have malware in\n\n266\n00:13:31.879 --> 00:13:36.130\nthem, might open up ports on your computer\nthat violates your security policies.\n\n267\n00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:38.136\nA lot of things to consider there.\n\n268\n00:13:38.136 --> 00:13:41.144\nLastly, I'll say don't be\nwhat I call a Jiminy Clickit.\n\n269\n00:13:41.144 --> 00:13:42.973\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I like it.\n\n270\n00:13:42.973 --> 00:13:47.114\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is something, I should\nsay this out loud, my step-mother.\n\n271\n00:13:47.114 --> 00:13:49.720\nI used to tell her all the times,\nlike she would,\n\n272\n00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.050\nif a dialog box pops up you just click it.\n\n273\n00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:54.733\nNot read what was going on there.\n\n274\n00:13:54.733 --> 00:13:56.960\nMake sure you take\nthe time to read things.\n\n275\n00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.647\nThis is where they get that\nsoftware installed on your machine.\n\n276\n00:13:59.647 --> 00:14:02.725\nYou download something and you're trying\nto install it and you just click Next,\n\n277\n00:14:02.725 --> 00:14:04.990\nNext, Next, Next, Next, Next, Install.\n\n278\n00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:06.933\nRead those screens.\n\n279\n00:14:06.933 --> 00:14:09.810\nIt's gonna say hey, would you like\nto install the Jeeves toolbar?\n\n280\n00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:12.298\nUncheck that, all right?\n\n281\n00:14:12.298 --> 00:14:14.400\nMake sure you're just paying\nattention to what you're clicking on.\n\n282\n00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.561\nDon't just click, Next, Next,\nNext because they're counting on that.\n\n283\n00:14:17.561 --> 00:14:20.092\nAnd they want you to just\nbreeze through it, and\n\n284\n00:14:20.092 --> 00:14:23.020\ninstall what you want plus\nstuff that you don't want.\n\n285\n00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.132\nWhat about user account control?\n\n286\n00:14:26.132 --> 00:14:27.057\nThe UAC.\n&gt;&gt; The UAC.\n\n287\n00:14:27.057 --> 00:14:31.185\nYeah the good old UAC, this is something\nthat Microsoft started a few years ago,\n\n288\n00:14:31.185 --> 00:14:34.523\nactually came out with Vista and\nit's got a really bad rap I know,\n\n289\n00:14:34.523 --> 00:14:35.754\nwhen it first came out.\n\n290\n00:14:35.754 --> 00:14:38.660\nIt's gotten much better and I think\npeople have started getting used to it.\n\n291\n00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:42.603\nIts a very good thing,\nit's designed to keep us safe,\n\n292\n00:14:42.603 --> 00:14:46.819\nfrom ourselves and\nfrom malicious software, all right?\n\n293\n00:14:46.819 --> 00:14:49.769\nWhat the UAC does, the user count control,\n\n294\n00:14:49.769 --> 00:14:53.208\nit tries to limit administrative access,\nright?\n\n295\n00:14:53.208 --> 00:14:57.684\nIf you log on as an administrator,\nsoftware things that you do\n\n296\n00:14:57.684 --> 00:15:02.170\nare now potentially running\nas administrator as well.\n\n297\n00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:03.770\nSo if that software has malware in it,\n\n298\n00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:06.329\nthat malware could be running\nwith administrative access.\n\n299\n00:15:06.329 --> 00:15:08.250\nAccess anything on your\nsystem that it wants,\n\n300\n00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:10.940\npotentially even reaching\nout to the network.\n\n301\n00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:14.373\nWhat the UAC does is when\nyou log on as administrator,\n\n302\n00:15:14.373 --> 00:15:16.753\nit really limits your credentials.\n\n303\n00:15:16.753 --> 00:15:20.702\nEven though yes,\nyou've provided administrative password,\n\n304\n00:15:20.702 --> 00:15:22.393\nyou are an administrator.\n\n305\n00:15:22.393 --> 00:15:26.259\nBut when you click on something,\nthe UAC is gonna stop it for a second and\n\n306\n00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:30.770\nsay hey look, this program is trying to\ndo this, did you mean for it to do that?\n\n307\n00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:32.354\nAnd you can say yes or no.\n\n308\n00:15:32.354 --> 00:15:34.441\nAnd again, it's another one of\nthose things where you don't wanna\n\n309\n00:15:34.441 --> 00:15:35.640\nbe Jiminy Clickit.\n\n310\n00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:36.533\nRead what it says.\n\n311\n00:15:36.533 --> 00:15:41.370\nDon't just assume, it's the UAC, yes,\nwhat a pain, yes, and just click on it.\n\n312\n00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:45.796\nMake sure you're reading what it's telling\nyou cuz it very well could be telling you\n\n313\n00:15:45.796 --> 00:15:48.974\nthat it's doing something that\nyou did not intend it to do and\n\n314\n00:15:48.974 --> 00:15:51.869\nthis is your chance to say no,\nwait, let me stop that.\n\n315\n00:15:51.869 --> 00:15:56.855\nIf you log on as a standard user, when you\ndon't have administrative username and\n\n316\n00:15:56.855 --> 00:16:00.321\npassword, then what the UAC\ndoes is it still pops up, but\n\n317\n00:16:00.321 --> 00:16:02.508\nnow it can't just ask you yes or no.\n\n318\n00:16:02.508 --> 00:16:05.720\nBecause you're not an admin so you just\nhave the rights to say just yes or no.\n\n319\n00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:09.489\nWhat it's gonna do is give you\na log on dialogue box and say hey,\n\n320\n00:16:09.489 --> 00:16:10.842\nprovide a username and\n\n321\n00:16:10.842 --> 00:16:15.772\npassword that has administrative access\nif you truly wanna allow this to happen.\n\n322\n00:16:15.772 --> 00:16:19.779\nSo it limits application software and\nthings that are running from getting\n\n323\n00:16:19.779 --> 00:16:22.331\nadministrative access\nwithout us knowing it.\n\n324\n00:16:22.331 --> 00:16:25.000\nThat's the whole idea there and\nit's customizable.\n\n325\n00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.709\nWe can go in and\nconfigure it on an individual user basis.\n\n326\n00:16:29.709 --> 00:16:34.310\nLet's take a look at some of the settings\nthat we have for the good old UAC.\n\n327\n00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:37.425\nSo I'm gonna come over here and\nopen up my,\n\n328\n00:16:37.425 --> 00:16:43.238\nwell attempt to open up my settings and\nwe'll just go in the old school way here.\n\n329\n00:16:43.238 --> 00:16:48.131\nWe'll open up the control panel, and\nI'm gonna go into user accounts, and\n\n330\n00:16:48.131 --> 00:16:51.580\nthen I'm gonna click on user\naccounts one more time.\n\n331\n00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:56.006\nHere I have changes to, or\nchange user account control settings, and\n\n332\n00:16:56.006 --> 00:17:00.896\nwhen I click on that, I get this dialogue\nbox and I've got four options here.\n\n333\n00:17:00.896 --> 00:17:05.087\nAt the very top, always notify,\nthis is the strongest setting if you will,\n\n334\n00:17:05.087 --> 00:17:07.118\napps try to install, make changes,\n\n335\n00:17:07.118 --> 00:17:10.870\nit's gonna notify me even when I\nmake changes to Windows settings.\n\n336\n00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:14.873\nSo if I go in and try to modify\nmy network adaptor settings or\n\n337\n00:17:14.873 --> 00:17:17.256\nsomething it's gonna notify me.\n\n338\n00:17:17.256 --> 00:17:19.865\nThat can get a little annoying,\nespecially if you are an admin and\n\n339\n00:17:19.865 --> 00:17:22.660\nyou do a lot of things that\nrequire administrative rights.\n\n340\n00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.047\nSo we can drop this down,\nthis is the default,\n\n341\n00:17:25.047 --> 00:17:28.123\nnotify me only when apps try to\nmake changes to my computer.\n\n342\n00:17:28.123 --> 00:17:30.961\nSo now if an application that I\nclick on tries to do something,\n\n343\n00:17:30.961 --> 00:17:33.340\nit's gonna make sure I'm aware of that.\n\n344\n00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:34.880\nBut if I'm trying to\ndo something directly,\n\n345\n00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.680\nlike change my network adaptor settings,\nit's gonna go ahead and let me.\n\n346\n00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:38.870\nIt's gonna say all right, you're an admin,\n\n347\n00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:41.500\nI'm not even gonna bother asking you for\nthat.\n\n348\n00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:46.411\nI can slide it down one further,\nthese two, the last one I just did and\n\n349\n00:17:46.411 --> 00:17:51.596\nthis one, are exactly the same except for\nit doesn't dim your desktop.\n\n350\n00:17:51.596 --> 00:17:55.255\nNormally when the UAC pops up,\neverything else grays out and\n\n351\n00:17:55.255 --> 00:17:57.890\nyou can only click on the UAC window.\n\n352\n00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:01.730\nThat's called a modal,\nM-O-D-A-L, dialog box, and\n\n353\n00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:05.540\nit's more secure because everything\nelse freezes while you decide whether or\n\n354\n00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.150\nnot you give this administrative access or\nnot.\n\n355\n00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:12.584\nSome computers, older computers that don't\nhave the processing or graphics power,\n\n356\n00:18:12.584 --> 00:18:16.238\nthat can really choke them and\nmake them chug, so you can turn that off.\n\n357\n00:18:16.238 --> 00:18:20.230\nThe down side is now the UAC will\npop up but nothing else is frozen.\n\n358\n00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:23.420\nSo that application could technically\nstill be trying to do things in\n\n359\n00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.500\nthe background while you're sitting\nthere starting at that UAC.\n\n360\n00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:30.901\nSo it's not as secure, but if you've got\nan older system that the UAC bogs down,\n\n361\n00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:32.740\nmight be something you wanna do.\n\n362\n00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.927\nBottom option, never notify me.\n\n363\n00:18:34.927 --> 00:18:36.590\nIn this case, it won't bother you.\n\n364\n00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:38.846\nIt's gonna say alright, all right,\nI'm not gonna bother you.\n\n365\n00:18:38.846 --> 00:18:41.020\nIf you're an administrator,\nit'll let you do it.\n\n366\n00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.703\nIf an application tries to do it and\nyou're logged in as an administrator,\n\n367\n00:18:43.703 --> 00:18:44.604\nit'll just let it do it.\n\n368\n00:18:44.604 --> 00:18:45.220\nWon't care.\n\n369\n00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.250\nYou told it not to notify you.\n\n370\n00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:50.836\nIf you're a standard user however,\nit won't notify you, and\n\n371\n00:18:50.836 --> 00:18:54.740\nyou can't do anything that\nrequires administrative access.\n\n372\n00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.009\nCuz you're never gonna get\na pop-up that says, hey,\n\n373\n00:18:57.009 --> 00:19:00.183\nprovide credentials that have\nadministrative access, so it won't work.\n\n374\n00:19:00.183 --> 00:19:03.680\nSo those are your options there for\nconfiguring the UAC.\n\n375\n00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.531\nAgain, that's on an individual basis.\n\n376\n00:19:05.531 --> 00:19:06.578\nSo I would need to do that for\n\n377\n00:19:06.578 --> 00:19:09.160\nthe different user accounts\nthat are on this system.\n\n378\n00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.706\nIn a domain,\nwe'd do that through group policy,\n\n379\n00:19:11.706 --> 00:19:15.540\nmaking sure we could set it once and\nnot have to touch every single machine.\n\n380\n00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.290\n&gt;&gt; Mike, what about Windows Firewall?\n\n381\n00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:20.039\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nwe've talked about that firewall before.\n\n382\n00:19:20.039 --> 00:19:23.958\nWe talked about the concept of a firewall,\nwhat it does.\n\n383\n00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:27.030\nWe've talked about host-based\nversus network-based.\n\n384\n00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:31.454\nAnd on Windows 10, I think it was actually\nstarted with XP Service Pack 2 or\n\n385\n00:19:31.454 --> 00:19:34.526\nService Pack 3,\nWindows has a built-in firewall.\n\n386\n00:19:34.526 --> 00:19:38.456\nSo it's a host-based firewall\nthat is turned on by default and\n\n387\n00:19:38.456 --> 00:19:40.467\nthat we can go in and configure.\n\n388\n00:19:40.467 --> 00:19:43.035\nAnd this is gonna to protect not\nany other machines on my network,\n\n389\n00:19:43.035 --> 00:19:44.680\nit's gonna protect the host.\n\n390\n00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.069\nAnd a lot of people think,\nwell why do I need that?\n\n391\n00:19:47.069 --> 00:19:51.212\nIf I've already got firewalls at the\nperimeter of our network, my company has\n\n392\n00:19:51.212 --> 00:19:56.290\nfirewalls, ao I'm inside the firewall,\nI should be safe, and you are kind of.\n\n393\n00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:59.989\nBut the problem is, if something\ngets through the firewall, and\n\n394\n00:19:59.989 --> 00:20:03.697\nthere's no other firewalls like\non your host, it has free rein.\n\n395\n00:20:03.697 --> 00:20:05.120\nThere's nothing left to stop it.\n\n396\n00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.523\nWe never put all of our eggs in\none basket, so to say, right?\n\n397\n00:20:08.523 --> 00:20:13.380\nNot one layer of defense, the perimeter\nis not our only line of defense.\n\n398\n00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.680\nSo even though we've got\ndefenses at the perimeter,\n\n399\n00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.520\nwe still put up the firewall\non our individual machines.\n\n400\n00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:23.102\nThat way, if something does get in and\nit affects Zach's computer,\n\n401\n00:20:23.102 --> 00:20:25.217\nit can't just jump over to my computer.\n\n402\n00:20:25.217 --> 00:20:30.927\nBecause my computer has a firewall on it,\nespecially on your sensitive hosts.\n\n403\n00:20:30.927 --> 00:20:35.098\nIf you've got servers that you need to\ncontrol access to, will run of course our\n\n404\n00:20:35.098 --> 00:20:39.690\nnetwork based firewall but also host\nbased firewalls on those as well.\n\n405\n00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:42.980\nThe Windows Firewall,\nlets take a peek at it real quick.\n\n406\n00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.345\nI'm just going to go to my Start Menu and\ntry typing firewall.\n\n407\n00:20:46.345 --> 00:20:48.060\nWe'll see if it wants to play along.\n\n408\n00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:51.472\nNow what you'll see here is there's\nactually two different options.\n\n409\n00:20:51.472 --> 00:20:54.066\nThat's an interesting zoom.\n\n410\n00:20:54.066 --> 00:20:57.516\nThe top one here says Windows Firewall\nwith Advanced Security and\n\n411\n00:20:57.516 --> 00:20:59.407\nthen I also have Windows Firewall.\n\n412\n00:20:59.407 --> 00:21:00.730\nThere is only one firewall.\n\n413\n00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:02.530\nThere's just two different consoles.\n\n414\n00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:06.183\nThe Windows Firewall, which I'm looking\nat now, gives me basic control.\n\n415\n00:21:06.183 --> 00:21:11.704\nI can turn it on, turn it off, allow\na particular app through the firewall.\n\n416\n00:21:11.704 --> 00:21:14.310\nLet me expand this out and\nI'll zoom in for you, and\n\n417\n00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:18.540\nyou can see over here I've got options,\nturn Windows Firewall on or off.\n\n418\n00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.440\nSo I can turn the firewall on or\n\n419\n00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:24.020\noff, depending on the network\nthat I'm connected to.\n\n420\n00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.080\nI'm gonna zoom back out cuz\nI can't see anything there.\n\n421\n00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:30.565\nI can allow an app or\nfeature through the Windows firewall.\n\n422\n00:21:30.565 --> 00:21:34.274\nSo I can click on that, and I can come\nin here and I can say you know what?\n\n423\n00:21:34.274 --> 00:21:37.860\nI need,\nlet's see what's a good one to show you.\n\n424\n00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:42.892\nI don't know, let's just pretend\nwe were gonna do Twitter.\n\n425\n00:21:42.892 --> 00:21:45.930\nWell, Twitter already has\nan exception on here.\n\n426\n00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:47.250\nBut whatever the case is,\n\n427\n00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:51.277\nlet's say that SNMP trap was something\nI wanted to allow through the Firewall.\n\n428\n00:21:51.277 --> 00:21:53.782\nCome in here and I could say,\nyes, I wanna allow you and\n\n429\n00:21:53.782 --> 00:21:56.760\nthen I can choose domain network,\nprivate, or public.\n\n430\n00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:00.010\nSo if I only want this app to\nwork when I'm on the domain, but\n\n431\n00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:03.731\nnot when I'm at Starbucks,\nI can just check domain and not public.\n\n432\n00:22:03.731 --> 00:22:07.672\nNow the other firewall option,\nlet's go back to the Start Menu.\n\n433\n00:22:07.672 --> 00:22:09.596\nAnd I'll show you the long\nway to get there,\n\n434\n00:22:09.596 --> 00:22:13.680\nwe'll type firewall again, is\nthe Windows Firewall of Advanced Security.\n\n435\n00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.649\nWhat I wanna make sure we understand\nis it's still the same firewall.\n\n436\n00:22:16.649 --> 00:22:19.422\nThere's only one firewall\nrunning on this client, but\n\n437\n00:22:19.422 --> 00:22:21.690\nthis gives me more granular control.\n\n438\n00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:25.627\nNow I can see inbound rules\nversus outbound rules.\n\n439\n00:22:25.627 --> 00:22:27.479\nThe traffic is coming into my computer,\n\n440\n00:22:27.479 --> 00:22:30.280\nversus traffic that's\ngoing out of my computer.\n\n441\n00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:34.924\nAlso I can work with IP6, we talked\nabout that in some other episodes.\n\n442\n00:22:34.924 --> 00:22:37.490\nSo I can work with that\nwithin this consoles list.\n\n443\n00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:42.617\nSo again, same firewall it's\njust a more granular control.\n\n444\n00:22:42.617 --> 00:22:46.754\nLast thing I want to say about firewalls,\none of things I hear people say,\n\n445\n00:22:46.754 --> 00:22:48.442\nis should I run more than one?\n\n446\n00:22:48.442 --> 00:22:54.784\nYou can, but it's really not necessary and\nit's going to make more work for you.\n\n447\n00:22:54.784 --> 00:22:59.050\nIf you think about it, the firewall\ncloses all the ports, and then you make\n\n448\n00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:03.340\nexceptions to open up some of those\nports to allow traffic either in or out.\n\n449\n00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.372\nNow if I put two walls and\nI make a hole in the first one,\n\n450\n00:23:06.372 --> 00:23:09.686\nit gets through the first one and\nthen hits the second one.\n\n451\n00:23:09.686 --> 00:23:12.072\nSo now I've got to make an exception\non the second one as well.\n\n452\n00:23:12.072 --> 00:23:14.842\nSo every program that I wanna\nallow through has to go through,\n\n453\n00:23:14.842 --> 00:23:17.360\nI have to make exceptions in for\nboth firewalls.\n\n454\n00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:20.949\nNot really getting any extra protection\ncuz the first one's doing it just fine,\n\n455\n00:23:20.949 --> 00:23:24.243\nI'm just making more work for myself\nbecause now I've got to do it twice.\n\n456\n00:23:24.243 --> 00:23:28.919\nSo, running more than one firewall really\ndoesn't get you anything other than\n\n457\n00:23:28.919 --> 00:23:29.841\nfrustration.\n\n458\n00:23:29.841 --> 00:23:34.911\n[LAUGH] Is what I will say,\nin my humble opinion.\n\n459\n00:23:34.911 --> 00:23:37.340\nAll right, so\nwe talked about anti-virus software.\n\n460\n00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:40.469\nWe talked about hoaxes,\nunwanted software, UAC, firewall.\n\n461\n00:23:40.469 --> 00:23:41.530\nWhat's next on our list here?\n\n462\n00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:42.560\n&gt;&gt; Software updates?\n\n463\n00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:45.450\n&gt;&gt; Software updates, all right.\n\n464\n00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:48.160\nWe've mentioned this in other episodes,\nas well.\n\n465\n00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:51.444\nWe know that our operating system,\nfor example Windows.\n\n466\n00:23:51.444 --> 00:23:55.453\nMicrosoft puts out updates all the time\nand we wanna get those updates because\n\n467\n00:23:55.453 --> 00:23:58.669\nthose updates are usually\nfixing something that's broken.\n\n468\n00:23:58.669 --> 00:23:59.730\nA security flaw,\n\n469\n00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:04.690\na bug, some other thing that maybe the bad\nguys can try to take advantage of.\n\n470\n00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:05.840\nand compromise my machine.\n\n471\n00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:10.079\nSo here I just want to stress, it's very\nimportant that we keep our systems up to\n\n472\n00:24:10.079 --> 00:24:12.443\ndate and that were applying those patches.\n\n473\n00:24:12.443 --> 00:24:13.630\nNow we can do that in different ways.\n\n474\n00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:15.486\nWe can go use Windows update,\n\n475\n00:24:15.486 --> 00:24:19.727\nwhich is the update client that is\nbuilt in to our operating system.\n\n476\n00:24:19.727 --> 00:24:23.387\nReaches out to Microsoft servers and\nit says, hey, I'm running Windows 10.\n\n477\n00:24:23.387 --> 00:24:25.242\nWhat updates do you have for me?\n\n478\n00:24:25.242 --> 00:24:28.174\nAnd it looks at your system,\nsees what updates you already have.\n\n479\n00:24:28.174 --> 00:24:31.538\nAnd then Microsoft Server says, here's\nthe list of updates you don't have yet,\n\n480\n00:24:31.538 --> 00:24:33.111\nthat apply to your operating system.\n\n481\n00:24:33.111 --> 00:24:36.930\nWould you like to get them, and\nwe can choose to get them or not.\n\n482\n00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:38.513\nBut not only the operating system,\n\n483\n00:24:38.513 --> 00:24:41.483\nwe've got to think about\nthe applications we run as well, right?\n\n484\n00:24:41.483 --> 00:24:45.021\nIf I'm running Adobe software, well I\nneed to check with Adobe periodically and\n\n485\n00:24:45.021 --> 00:24:46.852\nmake sure I'm updating their software.\n\n486\n00:24:46.852 --> 00:24:50.430\nBecause even if my operating system is\npatched the software I'm running on\n\n487\n00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:54.089\nthe operating system has a vulnerability,\nthen I'm vulnerable, right?\n\n488\n00:24:54.089 --> 00:24:57.263\nSo I need to make sure that\nI'm updating the software,\n\n489\n00:24:57.263 --> 00:24:59.127\nnot just the operating system.\n\n490\n00:24:59.127 --> 00:25:03.778\nCorporate environments,\nit might be centrally managed.\n\n491\n00:25:03.778 --> 00:25:07.676\nThey might run something called\na Windows Server Update Service,\n\n492\n00:25:07.676 --> 00:25:10.607\nwhere they download\nthe updates from Microsoft.\n\n493\n00:25:10.607 --> 00:25:14.458\nAnd then your client machines are\nconfigured to connect to your local server\n\n494\n00:25:14.458 --> 00:25:15.791\nto download the updates.\n\n495\n00:25:15.791 --> 00:25:19.602\nReason they do this is because they can\nnow control which updates you get and\n\n496\n00:25:19.602 --> 00:25:20.280\ndon't get.\n\n497\n00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:24.046\nSome updates have been known to cause\nproblems with software maybe that you're\n\n498\n00:25:24.046 --> 00:25:26.018\nrunning or printers that you connect to.\n\n499\n00:25:26.018 --> 00:25:27.121\nSo by doing WSUS,\n\n500\n00:25:27.121 --> 00:25:31.619\nyour company can test updates first\nbefore you apply them to the system.\n\n501\n00:25:31.619 --> 00:25:36.823\nIt can save them a lot of headache\nlater on if an update causes a problem.\n\n502\n00:25:36.823 --> 00:25:40.794\nBut you're still going to be\napplying those updates as often, or\n\n503\n00:25:40.794 --> 00:25:43.770\nas soon as we get them\nonce they've been tested.\n\n504\n00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:48.127\nSystem center configuration\nmanager is even higher end way to\n\n505\n00:25:48.127 --> 00:25:52.911\ncentralize this process in very large,\ncorporate environments.\n\n506\n00:25:52.911 --> 00:25:56.431\nNow as far as the update\nclassifications go,\n\n507\n00:25:56.431 --> 00:25:59.955\nI tell you what Zach,\nyou give me the signal.\n\n508\n00:25:59.955 --> 00:26:02.661\nWe're getting close on time, and\nI get about three more topics and\n\n509\n00:26:02.661 --> 00:26:04.075\nI don't think it's going to fit.\n\n510\n00:26:04.075 --> 00:26:05.221\n&gt;&gt; We'll fit in two minutes.\n\n511\n00:26:05.221 --> 00:26:10.018\n&gt;&gt; It won't [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Keep pre bowing everything\n\n512\n00:26:10.018 --> 00:26:10.806\nyou've been saying so.\n\n513\n00:26:10.806 --> 00:26:11.697\n&gt;&gt; Okay, absolutely.\n\n514\n00:26:11.697 --> 00:26:14.718\nSo far we've been talking about\nkeeping our clients secure,\n\n515\n00:26:14.718 --> 00:26:16.003\nprotecting our clients.\n\n516\n00:26:16.003 --> 00:26:19.461\nAnd we've said we need to be\nrunning anti-virus software.\n\n517\n00:26:19.461 --> 00:26:23.133\nAnd we need to make sure we´re keeping\nthat anti-virus software up to date.\n\n518\n00:26:23.133 --> 00:26:26.538\nWhether that's Windows Defender\nthat's built into Windows 10 or\n\n519\n00:26:26.538 --> 00:26:29.894\nsome other third party,\nwe need to make sure we're updating that.\n\n520\n00:26:29.894 --> 00:26:34.680\nWe talked about the UAC and\nhow we can use that to control,\n\n521\n00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:38.671\nto kind of protect us from\nsoftware doing things\n\n522\n00:26:38.671 --> 00:26:42.682\nin the background without our consent,\nokay?\n\n523\n00:26:42.682 --> 00:26:45.717\nAnd we talked about the Windows Firewall,\n\n524\n00:26:45.717 --> 00:26:48.929\nas well as the beginning\nof Windows Updates.\n\n525\n00:26:48.929 --> 00:26:54.190\n&gt;&gt; So this is Part One of MTA Security\nFundamentals Client Protection.\n\n526\n00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:56.864\nOr how we can ensure client protection,\npart one.\n\n527\n00:26:56.864 --> 00:26:59.097\nPart two will be coming up and\nthere's a lot more.\n\n528\n00:26:59.097 --> 00:27:00.943\nHey, thank you so much, terrific.\n\n529\n00:27:00.943 --> 00:27:02.610\nGreat information as usual.\n\n530\n00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:05.703\nITPRO.TV, we are helping\nyou learn wherever

00:00:06.713\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.713 --> 00:00:08.566\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:11.784\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.784 --> 00:00:14.794\n&gt;&gt; Hello again, and\nthank you for choosing ITProTV,\n\n7\n00:00:14.794 --> 00:00:17.220\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n8\n00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.230\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, as we continue\non with MTA security fundamentals.\n\n9\n00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.680\nThis is part two of client protection.\n\n10\n00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.372\nPart one was excellent and\nbrought to you by Michael Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:26.372 --> 00:00:27.779\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thank you, thank you.\n\n12\n00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.990\n&gt;&gt; Could you give us a little wrap\nup of what our part one was about?\n\n13\n00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.286\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\nWe talked about a few different ways that\n\n14\n00:00:33.286 --> 00:00:37.240\nwe could provide client protection,\nthings like antivirus software,\n\n15\n00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.811\nworking with the firewall.\n\n16\n00:00:38.811 --> 00:00:42.008\nZach, it's been so\nlong I forgot what else we talked about.\n\n17\n00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:46.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The UAC, we talked about hoaxes and\n\n18\n00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.630\npreventing unwanted software\nfrom being installed.\n\n19\n00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.565\nAnd then we ended up talking\nabout Windows updates.\n\n20\n00:00:51.565 --> 00:00:53.385\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, Windows firewall.\n\n21\n00:00:53.385 --> 00:00:56.180\n&gt;&gt; And how important they were and some of\nthe different ways we could get updates on\n\n22\n00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.550\nour system, going out to Microsoft\ndirectly, using our Windows update client.\n\n23\n00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.420\nUsing WSUS in a corporate environment or\n\n24\n00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.900\na System Center Configuration Manager\nto centrally manage that.\n\n25\n00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.910\nAnd then we were gonna talk about\nthe different classifications.\n\n26\n00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.892\n&gt;&gt; And that's where we're at because we're\ngonna talk about updates classification.\n\n27\n00:01:11.892 --> 00:01:15.790\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and in the end, well,\nI shouldn't say that, so I won't say that.\n\n28\n00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.203\n[LAUGH] I might come back to that\nin a minute if you guys are lucky.\n\n29\n00:01:19.203 --> 00:01:21.315\nWhen we're talking about classifications,\n\n30\n00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:25.310\nreally we are saying that Microsoft\nputs out different types of updates.\n\n31\n00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.780\nThey've got their important updates,\noptional updates, and recommended updates.\n\n32\n00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:31.623\nAnd it's kind of self-explanatory.\n\n33\n00:01:31.623 --> 00:01:36.310\nImportant updates are updates\nthat are considered important.\n\n34\n00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.080\nThese are usually security related\nupdates where they found a flaw,\n\n35\n00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.265\nand if not patched a bad guy\ncould compromise your system,\n\n36\n00:01:43.265 --> 00:01:45.920\ntaking advantage of that vulnerability.\n\n37\n00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.980\nSo that's something I really want.\n\n38\n00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.060\nThat's important.\n\n39\n00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.660\nReliability updates, maybe there's been\na bug discovered that causes the system to\n\n40\n00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.290\ncrash, so you get stability issues.\n\n41\n00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.200\nAn update like that is gonna be very\nimportant, so we wanna get those.\n\n42\n00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.710\nRecommended updates\nare usually non-critical.\n\n43\n00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.600\nIt might things that you would like,\nand would be good, but\n\n44\n00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.120\nthey're not security related.\n\n45\n00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.080\nThey're not considered an issue.\n\n46\n00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.180\nYou should get them, but if you don't,\nit's not gonna be the end of the world.\n\n47\n00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.852\nYou're not putting your system at risk.\n\n48\n00:02:16.852 --> 00:02:20.170\nAnd then there's optional updates which\nare that, just completely optional.\n\n49\n00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.420\nHey, there's a new driver.\n\n50\n00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.130\nIf you want it, great.\n\n51\n00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.286\nIf you don't, that's okay, all right?\n\n52\n00:02:24.286 --> 00:02:25.600\nOr it could be new software.\n\n53\n00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.780\nMicrosoft has put out Paint 3D for\nexample.\n\n54\n00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.430\nIf you don't want it,\nthen don't download it.\n\n55\n00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.630\nIt's okay.\n\n56\n00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.810\nIt's an optional thing.\n\n57\n00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.570\nSo they do classify their updates.\n\n58\n00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.230\nSecurity updates are another one.\n\n59\n00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.330\nAnd really when we talk\nabout the important updates,\n\n60\n00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.530\nwe can kinda subclassify those\nas security, critical, and\n\n61\n00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.310\nthen there are service packs that\nwe need to talk about as well.\n\n62\n00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.118\nCritical updates are fixing\na specific non-security\n\n63\n00:02:55.118 --> 00:02:59.330\nrelated issue, all right,\nlike a bug that, like I said,\n\n64\n00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.335\nis gonna cause a system crash, or\na hang or something like that.\n\n65\n00:03:03.335 --> 00:03:07.868\nWhereas the security updates\nare security related, right?\n\n66\n00:03:07.868 --> 00:03:10.748\nThey're important updates that\nare also related to security.\n\n67\n00:03:10.748 --> 00:03:13.568\nAnd then within the security updates,\n\n68\n00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:18.448\nthey can be considered critical,\nimportant, moderate, or low.\n\n69\n00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:21.557\nNow what I started to say at\nthe beginning of this was in the end,\n\n70\n00:03:21.557 --> 00:03:23.150\ndoes it really matter?\n\n71\n00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.300\nAnd I thought about it for a second.\n\n72\n00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.760\nAnd yes, it does.\n\n73\n00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.940\nSo I didn't wanna say that.\n\n74\n00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.880\n&gt;&gt; So Mike,\nwhy do we have these classifications?\n\n75\n00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.940\nDoes it really matter, or-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n76\n00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.990\nsometimes I'm tempted to say it doesn't,\nbut it does in the end, right?\n\n77\n00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.230\nBecause like the security updates, the\ncritical updates, those kind of things,\n\n78\n00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.140\nI wanna make I'm getting\nthose as quickly as possible.\n\n79\n00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.010\nSo typically,\nI'll set my machine to download and\n\n80\n00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.700\ninstall that classification automatically.\n\n81\n00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.670\nDon't even bother asking me.\n\n82\n00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.241\nAt 2 o'clock in the morning,\nwhen you go out and\n\n83\n00:03:51.241 --> 00:03:54.332\ncheck if there is a critical update,\ninstall it, right?\n\n84\n00:03:54.332 --> 00:03:58.077\nOptional updates, stuff that provides\nadditional software and things like that,\n\n85\n00:03:58.077 --> 00:03:59.670\nI wanna make that decision myself.\n\n86\n00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.190\nSo I don't want them to\nautomatically install.\n\n87\n00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.360\nYou can let me know that they're\navailable, and I'll decide whether or not.\n\n88\n00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.980\nAnd the same thing in the corporate world.\n\n89\n00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.610\nAnd we wanna make sure we know what\nupdates are getting installed.\n\n90\n00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.220\nSo by classifying them, I can make\nsure that I am getting those critical\n\n91\n00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.960\nsecurity related updates\ninstalled automatically.\n\n92\n00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.780\nThe others I can postpone, make a decision\non, decide whether or not I want them.\n\n93\n00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.050\nThe last one we didn't talk\nabout was the service packs.\n\n94\n00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.427\nAnd service packs are really\nkind of a roll up, if you will.\n\n95\n00:04:28.427 --> 00:04:32.211\nWhen an operating system comes out,\nwe'll take Windows 7 or\n\n96\n00:04:32.211 --> 00:04:35.880\nsomething like that, or\nWindows 8, it doesn't matter.\n\n97\n00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.690\nWhen it first comes out,\npeople install it, people use it.\n\n98\n00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.680\nAnd then over time we get updates that\nare coming out that fix problems,\n\n99\n00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.690\nbugs that were exposed,\nvulnerabilities, what have you.\n\n100\n00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.220\nAnd at some point, what Microsoft\nwill typically do is say, all right,\n\n101\n00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.120\nwe're gonna make a service pack.\n\n102\n00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.220\nMaybe it's been a year,\nsix months, two years, whatever.\n\n103\n00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.440\nThey're going to take all those updates\nand fixes that have come out and\n\n104\n00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.480\nkind of bundle them up into one.\n\n105\n00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.560\nAnd so now I can just go download\nthat one service pack instead\n\n106\n00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.554\nof downloading all these\nindividual updates, all right?\n\n107\n00:05:09.554 --> 00:05:11.943\nAnd then sometimes service packs\neven add new functionality.\n\n108\n00:05:11.943 --> 00:05:15.469\nLike I mentioned XP, I wanna say\nit was either service pack two or\n\n109\n00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:20.390\nservice pack three that added the Windows\nfirewall as a component of Windows.\n\n110\n00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.920\nSo service packs, cumulative updates.\n\n111\n00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.152\nA lot of organizations out there actually\nwait for the first service pack.\n\n112\n00:05:27.152 --> 00:05:32.197\nThey won't install a brand new operating\nsystem until service pack one for\n\n113\n00:05:32.197 --> 00:05:34.860\nthat operating system comes out.\n\n114\n00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.220\nBecause between that time,\nrelease, service pack one,\n\n115\n00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.420\nthat's when they are finding\nall the kinks and the bugs.\n\n116\n00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.520\nAnd so\na lot of organizations just say yeah,\n\n117\n00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.655\nonce it gets to service pack one, we'll\nlet everybody else iron out the kinks and\n\n118\n00:05:46.655 --> 00:05:48.695\nwe'll install it once\nservice pack one is out.\n\n119\n00:05:50.005 --> 00:05:54.926\nAll right, next thing we wanna talk about,\nZach, is good old offline files, right?\n\n120\n00:05:54.926 --> 00:05:56.555\nYeah.\n\n121\n00:05:56.555 --> 00:06:00.572\nAnd offline files,\nthe name kinda gives it away, right?\n\n122\n00:06:00.572 --> 00:06:04.737\nThese are files that we can\naccess when we're not online,\n\n123\n00:06:04.737 --> 00:06:06.958\nhence the name offline files.\n\n124\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:11.356\nA lot of the resources that you access at\nwork are going to be stored on a server\n\n125\n00:06:11.356 --> 00:06:15.688\non your network somewhere, a file server,\nright, a SharePoint server,\n\n126\n00:06:15.688 --> 00:06:17.371\nsomething like that.\n\n127\n00:06:17.371 --> 00:06:20.581\nSo when you're at work and you're\nconnected to the network, you can connect\n\n128\n00:06:20.581 --> 00:06:25.200\nto those files and you can read, write,\nwhatever you have permissions to do.\n\n129\n00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.581\nBut what if you wanna work with that\nfile when you leave the office,\n\n130\n00:06:28.581 --> 00:06:31.970\nright, when you disconnect your\nlaptop from the network and\n\n131\n00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:36.550\nyou go out to the park for lunch or\nyou go home for the evening.\n\n132\n00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.052\nWell, you're no longer\nconnected to the network,\n\n133\n00:06:38.052 --> 00:06:39.519\nyou don't get access to those files.\n\n134\n00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.586\nOffline files allows you to\ndownload a copy of those files and\n\n135\n00:06:44.586 --> 00:06:46.934\nstore them locally on your system.\n\n136\n00:06:46.934 --> 00:06:50.940\nAnd that way when you're away from\nthe network, you can still work with them.\n\n137\n00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.320\nAnd then when you connect back\nto the network the next day or\n\n138\n00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.880\nwhen you get back from lunch,\nit'll say, you're reconnected, and\n\n139\n00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.020\nit'll synchronize your changes with the\noriginal copy that’s on the work network.\n\n140\n00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.050\nSo that’s what offline files is all about.\n\n141\n00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.860\nWhat people forget sometimes is that\n\n142\n00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.070\nwe’re taking those files out of\nour corporate network, right?\n\n143\n00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:16.124\nThat trusted computer, that trusted\nnetwork, I’m bringing a file down\n\n144\n00:07:16.124 --> 00:07:21.353\nto my machine, and I'm going to\nthe local eatery, the coffee shop, home.\n\n145\n00:07:21.353 --> 00:07:23.560\nSo there's not the same\nlevel of protection.\n\n146\n00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.240\nAnd that could be sensitive\ncorporate information\n\n147\n00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.970\nthat I'm now storing on my machine.\n\n148\n00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:30.430\nSo somebody could get access to that.\n\n149\n00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:34.890\nSomebody could steal my laptop and\nget access to that information.\n\n150\n00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:39.000\nSo what we should do is\nencrypt those offline files.\n\n151\n00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.510\nFortunately, they're not\nencrypted by default.\n\n152\n00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.810\nIf I encrypt them,\nthen if somebody steals my machine or\n\n153\n00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.610\ngets access to my machine,\nhopefully if they don't get my password,\n\n154\n00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.610\nthey won't be able to access those files,\nright.\n\n155\n00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:55.170\nIf they try to steal the hard drive out\nof it, plug it into their computer,\n\n156\n00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:56.130\nthe files are encrypted.\n\n157\n00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.325\nSo without the proper key,\nyou're not gonna be able to decrypt them.\n\n158\n00:07:58.325 --> 00:08:02.224\n&gt;&gt; So you're saying we should encrypt\nthe offline files if they're sensitive,\n\n159\n00:08:02.224 --> 00:08:04.640\nif we feel like they could be in jeopardy?\n\n160\n00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:05.160\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n161\n00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.720\nAnd honestly,\nwhy not just encrypt them all, right?\n\n162\n00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.490\nSo let's take a look at how this works.\n\n163\n00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.012\nSo I'm gonna go to my Windows 10 machine,\nand\n\n164\n00:08:12.012 --> 00:08:14.130\nI am currently connected to the network.\n\n165\n00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:18.740\nSo in fact,\nlet's even prove that to ourselves.\n\n166\n00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:19.940\nLet's open up command prompt.\n\n167\n00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.820\nLet me bump that font up a wee bit so\neverybody can see it out there.\n\n168\n00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.970\nWe'll change that,\nmake it a little whiter.\n\n169\n00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:34.370\nAnd I'm gonna ping DC01,\nwhich is my domain controller.\n\n170\n00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:36.750\nSo I'm connected and\nI'm talking to that server.\n\n171\n00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.441\nSo now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nnavigate over to that server, and\n\n172\n00:08:40.441 --> 00:08:43.469\nthere's a shared folder over\nthere called offline demo.\n\n173\n00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:46.780\nAnd there's three files in there.\n\n174\n00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.097\nAnd I can open up these files, and oops,\n\n175\n00:08:49.097 --> 00:08:52.060\nI almost gave away my little\nsecret message there.\n\n176\n00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.040\nI can open up these files, and\n\n177\n00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.100\nI can work with them cuz I'm\nconnected to the network.\n\n178\n00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.390\nIf I disconnect from the network,\n\n179\n00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.880\nit probably makes sense I\nwouldn't have access to them.\n\n180\n00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.860\nSo what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna\nright-click on this file02, and\n\n181\n00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:07.670\nI'm gonna choose Always available offline,\nright?\n\n182\n00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:13.542\nAnd if offline files was not turned on\nalready, it's gonna turn it on for me.\n\n183\n00:09:13.542 --> 00:09:16.310\nIf it was already turned on,\nit wouldn't bother with that.\n\n184\n00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:18.540\nI'll tell you that you can\ngo in the Control Panel and\n\n185\n00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:23.300\nyour sync center to enable offline\nfiles as well if it's not turned on.\n\n186\n00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.770\nThis really isn't about enabling offline\nfiles, we do that in some other episodes.\n\n187\n00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:29.440\nThere are some other courses\nthat we have in our library.\n\n188\n00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.540\nIt's more about encrypting\nthe offline files.\n\n189\n00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:35.880\nSo once I've made that file available\noffline, let's see what happens.\n\n190\n00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:40.390\nWhat I'm gonna do is I'm going\nto disconnect my network.\n\n191\n00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.550\nSo I'm going to open up\nmy network settings.\n\n192\n00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:46.210\nAnd I'm gonna close this window just for\na second.\n\n193\n00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:49.060\nAnd I'm going to change my adapter app,\noops.\n\n194\n00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:55.570\nIt's not gonna let me do that because\nI'm logged on as the local admin.\n\n195\n00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:57.720\nSo I'm gonna have to go a different way.\n\n196\n00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.989\nLet me go through Control Panel.\n\n197\n00:10:00.989 --> 00:10:02.220\nLet me see if I can get there this way.\n\n198\n00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:08.840\nNetwork and Sharing Center, and\nthen change it after settings.\n\n199\n00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.430\nAgain, this really isn't\nthe important part.\n\n200\n00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:13.190\nWhat I'm doing is,\njust like you would at lunch,\n\n201\n00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:16.090\nyou're unplugging from the network and\ntaking your laptop with you.\n\n202\n00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:18.900\nI can't unplug my virtual machine,\nso I'm just gonna turn off\n\n203\n00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:22.330\nthe network adapter to simulate\nunplugging from the network.\n\n204\n00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:26.300\nSo at this point, if I try to ping DC01,\n\n205\n00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:30.280\nit's gonna tell me that I can't, right,\nbecause I am not connected to the network.\n\n206\n00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.048\nSo let's go check those offline files.\n\n207\n00:10:33.048 --> 00:10:39.730\nIf I go //dc01, offline demo,\nnotice I only see one file now.\n\n208\n00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:41.290\nI don't see all three of them,\n\n209\n00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:44.070\nonly the one file that I chose\nto make available offline.\n\n210\n00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:47.008\nThis is now stored locally on my system.\n\n211\n00:10:47.008 --> 00:10:49.133\nAll right, now the next thing,\n\n212\n00:10:49.133 --> 00:10:53.960\nwhat we really wanna talk about then\nis how do I protect that, all right?\n\n213\n00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.210\nBecause where is this file?\n\n214\n00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:57.340\nIt's not in a folder.\n\n215\n00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.830\nIt's not in My Downloads.\n\n216\n00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:00.500\nIt's not in My Documents.\n\n217\n00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.780\nIt's actually a hidden location.\n\n218\n00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:06.890\nIf I remember right,\nit's CRC on your C drive, but it's hidden.\n\n219\n00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:09.941\nNotice the path I typed to get into it.\n\n220\n00:11:09.941 --> 00:11:13.107\n\\\\DC01\\ offline demo.\n\n221\n00:11:13.107 --> 00:11:14.963\nWell, wait a second, Mike,\nyou're not connected to the network.\n\n222\n00:11:14.963 --> 00:11:17.530\nYou can't type in a UNC path.\n\n223\n00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:19.080\nBut I did, right?\n\n224\n00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.870\nThe computer's smart enough to know, hey,\nhe's trying to connect to a UNC path but\n\n225\n00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.460\nhe's not connected to the network.\n\n226\n00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.950\nLet me see if maybe he's cached this and\nmade it available locally.\n\n227\n00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:31.070\nAnd it found it and said, sure enough,\nI'll go ahead and show it to you, right?\n\n228\n00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:32.850\nI can open up this file.\n\n229\n00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:33.660\nThere's nothing in it.\n\n230\n00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:40.605\nBut I can type in here, If I could spell.\n\n231\n00:11:42.744 --> 00:11:43.901\nI can save it.\n\n232\n00:11:45.626 --> 00:11:47.530\nAnd I can close it, right?\n\n233\n00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.780\nBut I don't know, like I said,\nit's in a hidden location.\n\n234\n00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:54.150\nSo I can't really,\nhow is a good way to say it?\n\n235\n00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.430\nI need to make sure that content is safe.\n\n236\n00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:00.815\nSo what I wanna do is I\nwanna encrypt those guys.\n\n237\n00:12:00.815 --> 00:12:05.381\nNow to encrypt my offline files, I’m gonna\nneed to open up my Sync Center settings.\n\n238\n00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:08.071\nSo let’s see if I can get\nMicrosoft to play along with me.\n\n239\n00:12:11.121 --> 00:12:12.540\nSync your settings, maybe that’ll work.\n\n240\n00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.662\nThat is not what we want.\n\n241\n00:12:16.662 --> 00:12:18.700\nSync your settings.\n\n242\n00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:19.710\nThe problem I'm having,\n\n243\n00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:23.090\nmy machine has not been connected to\nthe Internet to do a lot of the indexing.\n\n244\n00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.000\nFor some reason, it doesn't index well if\nit doesn't have access to the Internet.\n\n245\n00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.710\nStrange with my Windows 10.\n\n246\n00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.210\nI need to hook it up just temporarily.\n\n247\n00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:32.980\nLet's do this.\n\n248\n00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:33.810\nLet's say Offline.\n\n249\n00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.981\nI cannot type today, off-\n&gt;&gt; Something always gets in the way,\n\n250\n00:12:39.981 --> 00:12:40.605\ndoesn't it?\n\n251\n00:12:40.605 --> 00:12:45.410\n&gt;&gt; Line, there we go,\nManage Offline Files, there we go.\n\n252\n00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:48.460\nSo this is my Offline Files setting.\n\n253\n00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:49.871\nAgain, you shouldn't\nhave the same trouble.\n\n254\n00:12:49.871 --> 00:12:52.640\nGo to your Control Panel,\ngo to your Sync Center.\n\n255\n00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.160\nYou should be able to find this.\n\n256\n00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.990\nAnd the one I'm looking for\nis this one right here, encryption.\n\n257\n00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:59.820\nYour offline files are not encrypted,\n\n258\n00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.080\nso by default,\nWindows is not gonna encrypt those files.\n\n259\n00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:08.210\nSo I'm gonna click Encrypt, and\nthen click OK, and that's it.\n\n260\n00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:09.810\nThat was all it took.\n\n261\n00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:13.618\nNow I can still access that\nfile just fine, right,\n\n262\n00:13:13.618 --> 00:13:16.907\nif I go back to that \\\\DC01 Office Demo.\n\n263\n00:13:16.907 --> 00:13:17.729\nThe file's still there.\n\n264\n00:13:17.729 --> 00:13:18.880\nI can double-click on it.\n\n265\n00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.152\nI can see everything.\n\n266\n00:13:20.152 --> 00:13:22.200\nI can, again, type in here.\n\n267\n00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:27.520\nI can save it and close it, no problem.\n\n268\n00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.600\nThe encryption doesn't bother me at all\nbecause I'm the one that encrypted it, so\n\n269\n00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.342\nI'm authorized to decrypt it.\n\n270\n00:13:33.342 --> 00:13:36.250\nNow if a bad guy steals my\nhard drive at this point\n\n271\n00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:38.500\nthey will not be able to\nget access to those files.\n\n272\n00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:42.820\nSo very important, if you are going\nto store copies of network files,\n\n273\n00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.870\nyou're gonna use offline files,\nenable that encryption.\n\n274\n00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:49.895\nMake sure you're providing a level\nof security for those cached files.\n\n275\n00:13:49.895 --> 00:13:52.632\nCuz people forget and\nthey don't think about it.\n\n276\n00:13:52.632 --> 00:13:58.400\nI need to take this file home and work on\nit for that project that's due on Monday.\n\n277\n00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.270\nAnd you end up copying a bunch of\ncorporate sensitive documents down to your\n\n278\n00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:03.880\nlocal computer not thinking about it,\njust thinking about the fact\n\n279\n00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:07.740\nthat you've gotta get that job done,\nnot thinking about the fact that\n\n280\n00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:11.430\nI now have corporate data on my computer\nthat could be potentially compromised.\n\n281\n00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:13.176\nSo make sure you apply that encryption.\n\n282\n00:14:13.176 --> 00:14:15.455\n&gt;&gt; Mike, maybe we can wrap this up.\n\n283\n00:14:15.455 --> 00:14:17.083\nWhat is the principle of least privilege?\n\n284\n00:14:17.083 --> 00:14:17.675\nWhat is that?\n\n285\n00:14:17.675 --> 00:14:20.232\n&gt;&gt; The principle of least privilege, we've\nhad to do that before I think a few times\n\n286\n00:14:20.232 --> 00:14:22.237\nas well, probably more than hinted,\nwe've talked about it.\n\n287\n00:14:22.237 --> 00:14:26.240\nBut it applies to client\nprotection as well.\n\n288\n00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.670\nRemember, principle of least\nprivilege is simply saying,\n\n289\n00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:32.260\nonly give people what they need\nto do their job and nothing more.\n\n290\n00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:36.230\nAnd I say people, that goes for\nservices, applications as well.\n\n291\n00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:38.960\nWe'll focus on users here since\nthis is client protection.\n\n292\n00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:41.530\nAnd when it comes to client protection,\n\n293\n00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:45.430\nreally what we're trying to say when we\ntalk about principle of least privilege is\n\n294\n00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.830\nnot everybody needs to be\nan administrator, right?\n\n295\n00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:53.759\nYou need administrative rights to do\ncertain tasks, but most of my end users\n\n296\n00:14:53.759 --> 00:14:58.468\nshouldn't be doing things that\nrequire administrative credentials.\n\n297\n00:14:58.468 --> 00:15:01.751\nA while back we had the old\nlazy admin syndrome and\n\n298\n00:15:01.751 --> 00:15:07.490\nwe made everybody local admins on their\nmachines because it simplified things.\n\n299\n00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:10.426\nIf they downloaded and\nwanted to install some software,\n\n300\n00:15:10.426 --> 00:15:14.167\nthey didn't have to come find us and\nask us to install software for them.\n\n301\n00:15:14.167 --> 00:15:17.730\nSo like I said,\nwe did the lazy admin thing.\n\n302\n00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:20.420\nBut it turns out,\nthat's not a very good idea.\n\n303\n00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:25.080\nBecause users either intentionally or\nunintentionally are gonna get into things\n\n304\n00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:28.120\nthat they don't know what their doing,\nshouldn't be messing around with.\n\n305\n00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.800\nAnd if they've got those credentials,\nsomething's gonna go wrong.\n\n306\n00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:35.790\nAnd it's it gonna end up causing more\nwork for us in IT as well as downtime and\n\n307\n00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.260\nfrustration for them as well.\n\n308\n00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.410\nSo in the end,\n\n309\n00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:42.470\nnot giving them administrative access\nreally is gonna make everybody happy.\n\n310\n00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:46.242\nNow it is tough to take it away\nif they've already had it.\n\n311\n00:15:46.242 --> 00:15:47.768\nI feel-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n312\n00:15:47.768 --> 00:15:49.599\n&gt;&gt; Your pain there because as soon as you\n\n313\n00:15:49.599 --> 00:15:53.940\ntell somebody, hey, you're not gonna be\nan administrator on your machine any more.\n\n314\n00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:58.550\nThey might've never once used anything\nthat required administrative access, but\n\n315\n00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:00.580\nyou tell them they're not gonna\nbe an administrator any more,\n\n316\n00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:02.280\nthey're not gonna be happy.\n\n317\n00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.090\nBut that's not the point.\n\n318\n00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:04.900\nWe're not here to keep them happy.\n\n319\n00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:08.050\nWe're here to make sure that they're safe,\nand that our network is safe, and\n\n320\n00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:09.560\nthat their computer's safe.\n\n321\n00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:13.893\nAnd so principle of least privilege means\ndon't give them anything more than they\n\n322\n00:16:13.893 --> 00:16:15.795\nneed to do their job.\n\n323\n00:16:15.795 --> 00:16:19.673\nThat's the old saying, my mom use to love\nto throw at me, I give you an inch and\n\n324\n00:16:19.673 --> 00:16:20.744\nyou take a mile.\n\n325\n00:16:20.744 --> 00:16:22.940\n&gt;&gt; My, I've heard that so\nmany times, my gosh.\n\n326\n00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthat's what happens with our users.\n\n327\n00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:28.970\nYou give them administrative access,\nand it might not even be intentional,\n\n328\n00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:32.050\nbut they're gonna get somewhere that\nthey shouldn't be and goof something up.\n\n329\n00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:35.150\nThen you're gonna get the call\nat the help desk that says, hey,\n\n330\n00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:37.070\nI can't get access to\nany network resources.\n\n331\n00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:38.480\nI don't know what's going on.\n\n332\n00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.363\nAnd you go, and you find that their\nTCP/IP information is all changed.\n\n333\n00:16:41.363 --> 00:16:43.110\nWe're like, were you?\n\n334\n00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:44.230\nNo, I wasn't in there.\n\n335\n00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:45.970\nIt wasn't me, I don't know.\n\n336\n00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:50.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nfollow that principle of least privilege.\n\n337\n00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:51.190\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's it.\n\n338\n00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:53.060\nClient protection part two wrapped up.\n\n339\n00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.450\nAnything else you'd like to add?\n\n340\n00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:57.150\n&gt;&gt; No, we've pretty much covered.\n\n341\n00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:58.670\nAgain, with client protection,\n\n342\n00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:03.080\nsome of this stuff that we've talked about\ncan be done at a group policy level.\n\n343\n00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:06.840\nIn other words, not on an individual\nmachine, but have that setting pushed out.\n\n344\n00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:09.690\nRemember, we talked about domain\ncontrollers in a prior episode.\n\n345\n00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:14.200\nSo just keep in mind that\nif you go to a machine and\n\n346\n00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.150\nsome of those settings are grayed out.\n\n347\n00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:20.310\nIf you find that you go to a laptop or\na desktop in your environment and\n\n348\n00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:23.410\nyou open up those firewall settings and\nall the check marks are gray and\n\n349\n00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:27.220\nyou can't change anything, it could\nbe that they're pushing settings out\n\n350\n00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:31.360\nto your machine so that they can\nconfigure from a central location.\n\n351\n00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:35.570\nAnd you won't be able to undo or change\nthose, and that's typically a good thing.\n\n352\n00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:38.970\nBut just to be aware, don't go,\nmy gosh, what's wrong with my machine?\n\n353\n00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.430\nIt should give you a little\nmessage across the top that says,\n\n354\n00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:44.510\nsome settings are controlled\nby your system administrator.\n\n355\n00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:46.140\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, Mike, as usual.\n\n356\n00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:49.960\n&gt;&gt; And that is client protection part two,\nMTA security fundamentals.\n\n357\n00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:50.700\nThere is part one.\n\n358\n00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.010\nMake sure you watch that and\n\n359\n00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:54.460\nwatch everything in this series\nof MTA security fundamentals.\n\n360\n00:17:54.460 -->

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:10.767 --> 00:00:16.401\n&gt;&gt; Lucky you, you've made the smart\nchoice to watch ITPRO TV, thank you.\n\n4\n00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:18.339\nYou know, an ITPRO is always learning.\n\n5\n00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:20.015\nI'm Zach Memos, your host for\n\n6\n00:00:20.015 --> 00:00:23.311\nMCA Security Fundamentals as\nwe continue with this series.\n\n7\n00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:26.453\nAnd today, we're talking about\nemail protection with a man who\n\n8\n00:00:26.453 --> 00:00:28.619\nknows everything about it, I know he does.\n\n9\n00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.463\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Mike Rodrick, right over here.\n\n10\n00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:31.777\n&gt;&gt; I don't know about everything.\n\n11\n00:00:31.777 --> 00:00:34.020\nThat might be overstating it a little bit,\nbut thank you for that, Zach.\n\n12\n00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.884\nAnd yeah, email protection, right?\n\n13\n00:00:35.884 --> 00:00:39.914\nWe need to make sure we understand part\nof security fundamentals is going to be\n\n14\n00:00:39.914 --> 00:00:43.838\nemail, protecting ourselves from\nemail because email can be dangerous.\n\n15\n00:00:43.838 --> 00:00:45.930\nIt's like wait,\nhow can email be dangerous?\n\n16\n00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.780\nWell, email is a big avenue for\nthe bad guys to get into your system.\n\n17\n00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.290\nSo, we need to make sure we're\nfollowing best practices and\n\n18\n00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.550\njust being safe when\nwe're approaching emails.\n\n19\n00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.934\nSo, let's talk about some of\nthe things that we can do with email.\n\n20\n00:01:01.934 --> 00:01:04.103\nAnd the first one is spam, right?\n\n21\n00:01:04.103 --> 00:01:06.360\nWe were having this\nconversation the other day.\n\n22\n00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.300\nWe were talking about the good\nold snail mail or here in the US,\n\n23\n00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.745\nthe US Postal Service, and I had recently\ngone on vacation, put my mail on hold.\n\n24\n00:01:15.745 --> 00:01:19.176\nI went to pick it up when I got back, and\nI'm gonna have a stack of mail like this.\n\n25\n00:01:19.176 --> 00:01:22.766\n95% of that went right in the trash.\n\n26\n00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:25.007\nIt was junk fail, right?\n\n27\n00:01:25.007 --> 00:01:28.382\nBut with snail mail like that,\nregular postal mail,\n\n28\n00:01:28.382 --> 00:01:33.033\nthe worst thing that happens is we lose\na tree or two and my garbage is full.\n\n29\n00:01:33.033 --> 00:01:35.350\nBut nothing bad happens to me, right?\n\n30\n00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.570\nWith email, however,\nspam can be a little bit different.\n\n31\n00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.640\nStill junk mail, but\nit can potentially be dangerous.\n\n32\n00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.070\nBecause sometimes that spam has links in\nit, they want us to click on things and\n\n33\n00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.950\nthose links can take us to bad places and\ncan end up infecting our machine.\n\n34\n00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.010\nSo, now we're talking about spam,\nhow do we protect ourselves from it?\n\n35\n00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.297\nWell, one is use common sense, right?\n\n36\n00:01:59.297 --> 00:02:02.040\nI get emails all the time from\nthings that I don't recognize.\n\n37\n00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.762\nI don't even open them up.\n\n38\n00:02:02.762 --> 00:02:04.110\nYou just delete them.\n\n39\n00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.270\nYou get rid of them.\n\n40\n00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.755\nA better solution is to have some\ntype of spam filter in place.\n\n41\n00:02:09.755 --> 00:02:13.745\nMost corporate networks, or\ncorporations spend a lot of money and\n\n42\n00:02:13.745 --> 00:02:16.505\neffort on trying to reduce\nthe amount of spam that's\n\n43\n00:02:16.505 --> 00:02:19.795\ncoming into their users' inboxes,\nbecause it reduces productivity.\n\n44\n00:02:19.795 --> 00:02:22.125\nYou know, you've got 40 emails.\n\n45\n00:02:22.125 --> 00:02:26.140\nTwo of them are work related,\nthe rest are advertising fences, or\n\n46\n00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.949\nsome pill you don't need,\nor who knows what.\n\n47\n00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:32.599\nSo, stopping those before they\nget to the inbox can make for\n\n48\n00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.358\na more productive end user.\n\n49\n00:02:34.358 --> 00:02:38.496\nCan also keep our system safe,\nbecause there is no chance of opening up\n\n50\n00:02:38.496 --> 00:02:43.140\na malicious email, or clicking on a link\nthat's taking you to some bad place.\n\n51\n00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.916\nThis can be done on your email server,\ncould be a special device that we put in.\n\n52\n00:02:47.916 --> 00:02:52.539\nWe have a barracuda device that all stuff\ncomes thru before it even comes to my\n\n53\n00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:53.486\nemail server.\n\n54\n00:02:53.486 --> 00:02:57.230\nAnd it has, much like anti virus,\nit has definitions that it uses.\n\n55\n00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.093\nAnd it scans those emails looking for key\nphrases that we know that we associate,\n\n56\n00:03:02.093 --> 00:03:05.036\nor words that we associate\nwith a lot of the spam.\n\n57\n00:03:05.036 --> 00:03:10.300\nAnd it'll prevent it from\neven getting to your system.\n\n58\n00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.310\nNow we do have to be careful with\nthose because of a couple things.\n\n59\n00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.432\nOne, they're not gonna be 100% accurate.\n\n60\n00:03:15.432 --> 00:03:19.686\nThey're gonna let a few come through,\nbut that's okay.\n\n61\n00:03:19.686 --> 00:03:22.473\nBut I do have to make sure that they\ndon't get anything that shouldn't be\n\n62\n00:03:22.473 --> 00:03:23.210\nconsidered spam.\n\n63\n00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.180\nYou want to make sure\nyou're tweaking these.\n\n64\n00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.355\nThese kind of devices usually\nneed a tuning period and\n\n65\n00:03:30.355 --> 00:03:33.980\na constant maintenance where we go in and\nsee.\n\n66\n00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.848\nLike our Barracuda, for example,\ngave us the option as an end user,\n\n67\n00:03:38.848 --> 00:03:40.876\nwe could go see what had been blocked.\n\n68\n00:03:40.876 --> 00:03:45.320\nAnd if any of it was not spam, that we\nwanted it come through, we could mark it.\n\n69\n00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.124\nAnd it would learn, right?\n\n70\n00:03:46.124 --> 00:03:48.636\nIt would add to its engine.\n\n71\n00:03:48.636 --> 00:03:51.610\nSay, okay,\nwe're not gonna stop that anymore.\n\n72\n00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.858\nCuz if somebody happened to use\nthe word free in their subject,\n\n73\n00:03:54.858 --> 00:03:57.813\nmaybe it catches it,\nbecause it thinks its a sales ploy.\n\n74\n00:03:57.813 --> 00:04:02.041\nSo reducing the amount of spam\ncan keep our client computers,\n\n75\n00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:04.003\nas well as our network safe.\n\n76\n00:04:04.003 --> 00:04:07.771\nAntivirus, I think we've spent enough\ntime on that, we understand what that is.\n\n77\n00:04:07.771 --> 00:04:12.643\nBut antivirus can also be used along\nwith email, where it scan your emails\n\n78\n00:04:12.643 --> 00:04:17.529\nthat are coming in, checking for\npotential malware inside your emails.\n\n79\n00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.710\nSpoofing is another issue that we have\nto deal with when we talk about email.\n\n80\n00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.270\nIt is very easy for\na bad actor to forge the to field.\n\n81\n00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.530\nMake it look like it's from\nsomebody that you recognize or\n\n82\n00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.900\nsomebody that you know,\ntempting you to open up that email.\n\n83\n00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.300\nThey can forge the from field,\n\n84\n00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.960\nwho it's from,\nthey can forge the source IP addresses.\n\n85\n00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.590\nSo, again, we have to do our part.\n\n86\n00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.390\nWe have to think,\nI'm not expecting an email from Zach.\n\n87\n00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.460\nHe never told me he was\nsending me this spreadsheet.\n\n88\n00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.052\nSo, before I click on that attachment and\nopen up that spreadsheet,\n\n89\n00:04:58.052 --> 00:04:59.566\nI'm gonna call Zach.\n\n90\n00:04:59.566 --> 00:05:01.630\nWe say, hey, Zack,\ndid you just send me a spreadsheet?\n\n91\n00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.880\nYeah, that was the thing I told\nyou I wanted you to look at.\n\n92\n00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.130\nThat's right, I forgot about that.\n\n93\n00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.670\nNow I feel safe and I can click on that.\n\n94\n00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.258\nBut if he tells me, no,\nI didn't send you a spreadsheet.\n\n95\n00:05:10.258 --> 00:05:12.074\nI'm gonna delete the email, right?\n\n96\n00:05:12.074 --> 00:05:14.879\nBecause it's not from him,\nit's probably spoofed and\n\n97\n00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:17.394\nthe spreadsheet probably\nhas a macro virus in it.\n\n98\n00:05:17.394 --> 00:05:20.640\nAnd as soon as I open it up,\nI'm going to infect my system.\n\n99\n00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.100\nSo, yeah, using common sense.\n\n100\n00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:27.012\nIf I get a notice, if i looked at my junk\nmail right now on my personal account,\n\n101\n00:05:27.012 --> 00:05:31.851\nI guarantee you I can see at least five\nemails in there telling me about Amazon\n\n102\n00:05:31.851 --> 00:05:34.065\norders that have been cancelled.\n\n103\n00:05:34.065 --> 00:05:36.996\nI haven't ordered a thing\nfrom Amazon lately.\n\n104\n00:05:36.996 --> 00:05:41.754\nIt's not really from Amazon,\nthere is no order that they canceled.\n\n105\n00:05:41.754 --> 00:05:44.358\nOr a Fed Ex notification about\na package that wasn't delivered and\n\n106\n00:05:44.358 --> 00:05:45.900\nI need to come down there and pick it up.\n\n107\n00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.690\nOr they need more information\nin order to ship it to me.\n\n108\n00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.470\nI didn't order anything,\nI'm not expecting anything from Fed Ex.\n\n109\n00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.940\nThat's most likely spam, it's trying\nto get me to click on something.\n\n110\n00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.450\nSo, not just assuming that everything\nthat comes into my inbox is safe.\n\n111\n00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.760\nWe've gotta help keep our machines safe.\n\n112\n00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.850\nA couple other terms I want you to be\nfamiliar with, phishing and pharming.\n\n113\n00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.690\nThese are things you've probably\nseen on the news lately.\n\n114\n00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.560\nThey are very common attacks.\n\n115\n00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.079\nPhishing is when I try to get\nsomebody to give up information,\n\n116\n00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:22.478\nlike their username and their password,\nor their credit card information,\n\n117\n00:06:22.478 --> 00:06:24.994\nor personally identifiable information.\n\n118\n00:06:24.994 --> 00:06:28.190\nUsually it's done by email, but\nit can be done through phone and text, and\n\n119\n00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.180\nother methods.\n\n120\n00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.312\nBut email phishing scams are very popular.\n\n121\n00:06:32.312 --> 00:06:35.308\nHey, it’s PayPal and\nyour account password is expired,\n\n122\n00:06:35.308 --> 00:06:38.440\nyou need to change it before you\nlose access to your account.\n\n123\n00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.610\nHere's a link to update your password.\n\n124\n00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:42.954\nDon't click on that.\n\n125\n00:06:42.954 --> 00:06:47.270\nGo to your browser, go to PayPal, log in.\n\n126\n00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.550\nSee if you really need\nto change your password.\n\n127\n00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.164\nPretty sure that email\nwas not from PayPal.\n\n128\n00:06:52.164 --> 00:06:56.799\nYou can almost be guaranteed,\nnowadays, that no legitimate business\n\n129\n00:06:56.799 --> 00:07:01.500\nis ever going to ask you for\nany personal information via email.\n\n130\n00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.440\nEmail is not secure.\n\n131\n00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.160\nIt's just not.\n\n132\n00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.820\nYou have to get that in your brain.\n\n133\n00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.001\nEmail is not secure.\n\n134\n00:07:09.001 --> 00:07:12.490\nIt's not a way to send secure information.\n\n135\n00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.640\nI'm never gonna try to send personal\ninformation in an email, and\n\n136\n00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.650\nI'm never gonna respond to an email that's\nrequesting for information like that.\n\n137\n00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:23.774\nIf my bank really needs my social\nsecurity number, I'll call them up, or\n\n138\n00:07:23.774 --> 00:07:27.318\nI'll stop by on my way home from work,\nor something like that.\n\n139\n00:07:27.318 --> 00:07:30.346\nI'm not gonna click on that link\nin an email, cuz it's too easy for\n\n140\n00:07:30.346 --> 00:07:33.990\nthe bad guys to spoof that stuff and make\nit look like it's from Bank of America.\n\n141\n00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.144\nAnd click on a link and it opens up a web\npage that looks just like Bank of America,\n\n142\n00:07:38.144 --> 00:07:40.200\nand I try to login and nothing happens.\n\n143\n00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.070\nWell, something happened.\n\n144\n00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.299\nThe bad guys just got my password and\nnow they're logging into my actual bank\n\n145\n00:07:45.299 --> 00:07:48.990\naccount while I'm sitting here staring at\nthis fake Bank of America page, all right?\n\n146\n00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:52.290\nSo that's phishing,\nusing email typically, or\n\n147\n00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:56.015\nsome other method to try to\nfish information out of you.\n\n148\n00:07:56.015 --> 00:08:01.609\nPharming is when the bad guys\nset up bogus websites and\n\n149\n00:08:01.609 --> 00:08:04.728\ntry to redirect you to there.\n\n150\n00:08:04.728 --> 00:08:10.200\nWhere it might be a fake Bank of\nAmerica site or a fake PayPal site.\n\n151\n00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.840\nBut they're using a different technique.\n\n152\n00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:18.880\nPharming typically involves modifying the\nway your computer connects to those sites.\n\n153\n00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.600\nWithout going too deep,\nour computers use something known as DNS,\n\n154\n00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.120\nDomain Name System.\n\n155\n00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:28.381\nWe type in names,\nwe type in www.bankofamerica,\n\n156\n00:08:28.381 --> 00:08:31.340\nwww.paypal.com, what have you.\n\n157\n00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:36.490\nAnd our computers turn that name into an\nIP address and connect to the IP address.\n\n158\n00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.563\nMuch like you type in,\nyou look up a name in a phonebook and\n\n159\n00:08:39.563 --> 00:08:41.300\nthen you dial the phone number.\n\n160\n00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.450\nThat's kind of what's going\non with our computers.\n\n161\n00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:48.771\nWell, if a bad guy can forge those DNS\nentries, and points you to a different IP\n\n162\n00:08:48.771 --> 00:08:54.110\naddress, not the actual Bank of America,\nbut this fake Bank of America site.\n\n163\n00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:59.950\nThat's pharming, they're trying to farm\npeople to come to their fake site.\n\n164\n00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:05.010\nAnd still, the end result is, giving up\npersonal information, your user name,\n\n165\n00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:09.310\nyour password, your credit card numbers,\nyour social security numbers, things that\n\n166\n00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:14.250\nthey can use to do more damage to you,\nsteal your identity, things like that.\n\n167\n00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:15.908\n&gt;&gt; And these are not friendly farmers.\n\n168\n00:09:15.908 --> 00:09:17.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No way.\n\n169\n00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.152\nWhat's a SmartScreen Filter?\n\n170\n00:09:20.152 --> 00:09:22.483\n&gt;&gt; A SmartScreen Filter,\nas I almost fall over here.\n\n171\n00:09:22.483 --> 00:09:24.213\nSmartScreen Filters\nare something that's built\n\n172\n00:09:24.213 --> 00:09:24.871\nin-\n&gt;&gt; I would have caught you.\n\n173\n00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:25.582\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you.\n\n174\n00:09:25.582 --> 00:09:27.140\n&gt;&gt; I would've grabbed you.\n\n175\n00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:30.585\nSmartScreen Filter is something that\nMicrosoft has built into their browser\n\n176\n00:09:30.585 --> 00:09:32.872\nthat's trying to protect\nme from known bad sites.\n\n177\n00:09:32.872 --> 00:09:37.306\nThey maintain a list of known\npharming sites, malware sites,\n\n178\n00:09:37.306 --> 00:09:40.410\nsites that if you go to\nyou can get infected.\n\n179\n00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:44.329\nAnd what the SmartScreen Filter does is,\nwhen you type in a URL or\n\n180\n00:09:44.329 --> 00:09:49.410\nattempt to go to a link, the browser's\ngonna send that information to Microsoft,\n\n181\n00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:52.480\ncompare it against their\nlist of known bad sites.\n\n182\n00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.450\nAnd if it pops up on the list, it's gonna\nstop your browser from going there.\n\n183\n00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:59.160\nAnd it's gonna pop up a warning saying,\nhey,\n\n184\n00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.089\nthis could be potentially\nbad news if you go here.\n\n185\n00:10:02.089 --> 00:10:03.550\nAre you sure you want to?\n\n186\n00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:06.000\nYou should really heed those warnings.\n\n187\n00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.020\nThey don't put sites in there just\nbecause they think they might be bad.\n\n188\n00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.650\nThese are known bad sites.\n\n189\n00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:15.343\nSo, if your browser tells you,\nhey, this is a bad site.\n\n190\n00:10:15.343 --> 00:10:17.096\nAre you sure you want to continue?\n\n191\n00:10:17.096 --> 00:10:18.976\nSay no, don't go to that site.\n\n192\n00:10:18.976 --> 00:10:21.590\nI can show you an example here.\n\n193\n00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:25.651\nIf I open up my Internet Explorer, and\nI just want to show you the settings for\n\n194\n00:10:25.651 --> 00:10:27.884\nwhere it can work with that SmartScreen.\n\n195\n00:10:27.884 --> 00:10:31.856\nTypically, the first time you open up\nyour browser, at least on Windows,\n\n196\n00:10:31.856 --> 00:10:34.540\nit will ask you if you want\nto enable SmartScreen.\n\n197\n00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:38.233\nAnd it's a good idea, like I said,\nit's taking a look at known bad sites and\n\n198\n00:10:38.233 --> 00:10:39.870\nmaking sure you don't go there.\n\n199\n00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.979\nThis machine does not have Internet\naccess, so it's not actually gonna connect\n\n200\n00:10:42.979 --> 00:10:45.380\nto anything, but\nI can still show you this setting.\n\n201\n00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:49.832\nIf I go under the little gear icon up\nhere in that top right hand corner,\n\n202\n00:10:49.832 --> 00:10:54.222\nI can go down to Safety, and\nthen here is turn on Smartscreen Filter.\n\n203\n00:10:54.222 --> 00:10:58.784\nI'll center this guy a little bit,\nand there are my options.\n\n204\n00:10:58.784 --> 00:11:02.729\nDesigned to warn you if a website you're\nvisiting is impersonating another website\n\n205\n00:11:02.729 --> 00:11:04.570\nor contains threats to your computer.\n\n206\n00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:08.910\nNow you can see that I do have it turned\non, and that is the recommended option.\n\n207\n00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:13.500\nSo, just another way that we can try to\nkeep ourselves safe from known bad sites.\n\n208\n00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.270\nAnd why not take advantage of that, right?\n\n209\n00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:18.480\nThey've got a list of known bad sites.\n\n210\n00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.004\nWhy would I wanna ignore that and\ngo to one of those sites anyway?\n\n211\n00:11:22.004 --> 00:11:25.637\nAnd again, if you get a warning from\nsomething like SmartScreen or whatever\n\n212\n00:11:25.637 --> 00:11:29.400\nprogram you happen to be using, heed\nthose warnings, pay attention to them.\n\n213\n00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.466\nUnless you know that the site is okay,\ndon't go there.\n\n214\n00:11:32.466 --> 00:11:39.785\nAll right Zach, now we look at\nclient versus server protection.\n\n215\n00:11:39.785 --> 00:11:43.360\nA kind of a topic that doesn't really\nfit with everything else here.\n\n216\n00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.853\nBut I wanna make sure I\nthrow it in somewhere,\n\n217\n00:11:45.853 --> 00:11:48.480\nbecause it is an exam objective.\n\n218\n00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.253\nReally what we wanna keep in mind when\nwe're talking about client versus server\n\n219\n00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:55.425\nis that when we talk about\nprotecting a client, it's important.\n\n220\n00:11:55.425 --> 00:11:59.303\nBut at the end of the day, if something\nhappens to this clients' machine that\n\n221\n00:11:59.303 --> 00:12:02.580\nI'm sitting at, or\nthat one you're sitting at.\n\n222\n00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.950\nWho's actually getting affected by that?\n\n223\n00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:06.730\nJust that one person, right?\n\n224\n00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:08.052\nThe user of that system, bad.\n\n225\n00:12:08.052 --> 00:12:12.175\nAnd I want to get them back online or\nget their system working again and\n\n226\n00:12:12.175 --> 00:12:14.250\nmake them a productive employee.\n\n227\n00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:19.270\nBut it is only affecting one\nperson versus my servers.\n\n228\n00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.030\nIf a server goes down for\n\n229\n00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:25.560\nsome reason, that's affecting multiple\nusers, my entire staff potentially.\n\n230\n00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:32.655\nSo we usually spend a little more time,\neffort, resources\n\n231\n00:12:32.655 --> 00:12:37.685\non hardening or protecting our servers\nthan we do our client systems, all right?\n\n232\n00:12:37.685 --> 00:12:39.687\nSo servers are going to require a little\nmore protection for that reason.\n\n233\n00:12:39.687 --> 00:12:44.800\nAlso, because servers are exposed more,\nright?\n\n234\n00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.402\nBecause they have to open up ports for\nthese services that we depend on.\n\n235\n00:12:48.402 --> 00:12:50.822\nWe wanna connect to them\nto get to those files.\n\n236\n00:12:50.822 --> 00:12:53.342\nWe wanna connect to them to do DNS lookup.\n\n237\n00:12:53.342 --> 00:12:56.840\nWe wanna connect to them to\nget an IP address from DHCP.\n\n238\n00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.730\nSo they're open to provide these services.\n\n239\n00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:03.380\nEach one of those openings\nthough is an avenue of attack.\n\n240\n00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:07.630\nIt's part of what we call, their attack\nsurface, and so there's a lot more work\n\n241\n00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:11.750\ninvolved hardening and\nprotecting servers than there are clients.\n\n242\n00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.440\nNow not to diminish or\n\n243\n00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.660\nsay that we shouldn't spend\nany time protecting clients.\n\n244\n00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.700\nI mean, we're spending a whole\nepisode here talking about it, or\n\n245\n00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:19.659\nwe did previously.\n\n246\n00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.930\nBut more efforts typically\ngoes into servers.\n\n247\n00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:29.548\nAll right, back to email protection Zach,\nsender policy framework.\n\n248\n00:13:29.548 --> 00:13:30.800\n&gt;&gt; That's the SPF, right?\n\n249\n00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.092\n&gt;&gt; That is, SPF is the acronym for that.\n\n250\n00:13:33.092 --> 00:13:33.917\nAnd really,\n\n251\n00:13:33.917 --> 00:13:39.140\nfor this exam, we're not gonna go into\na lot of details of how to create these.\n\n252\n00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.855\nBut I do want you to be familiar with\nwhat they are and what their purpose is.\n\n253\n00:13:41.855 --> 00:13:44.410\nCuz we are talking about email here.\n\n254\n00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:47.138\nAnd we're talking about spam and\nhow bad that is.\n\n255\n00:13:47.138 --> 00:13:52.009\nAnd what the bad guys do is they love to\ntry to find email servers that are not\n\n256\n00:13:52.009 --> 00:13:57.522\nprotected, that have what we call open\nrelay, where they will forward emails on.\n\n257\n00:13:57.522 --> 00:13:59.650\nBecause they want to send\nout a whole bunch of emails.\n\n258\n00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:02.290\nAnd they need an email\nserver to bounce those off\n\n259\n00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:04.990\nto make it more difficult\nto trace back to them.\n\n260\n00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:08.004\nSo they're looking for\nservers that would allow them to do that.\n\n261\n00:14:08.004 --> 00:14:10.459\nAnonymously send a whole bunch of emails,\n\n262\n00:14:10.459 --> 00:14:13.410\nkind of bouncing them\noff your email server.\n\n263\n00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:15.280\nEnds up looking like it came from you.\n\n264\n00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:19.790\nYour company can end up on blacklist and\nhave problems delivering\n\n265\n00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:23.950\nemails to legitimate users or\nbusiness partners because of this.\n\n266\n00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:26.540\nSo, this is not what we're gonna\ntalk about protecting email servers.\n\n267\n00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:32.025\nBut this part, we are talking about SPF,\nthat's really what we are doing.\n\n268\n00:14:32.025 --> 00:14:34.415\nA SPF record,\n\n269\n00:14:34.415 --> 00:14:39.415\nor the Sender Policy Framework\nrecords are added to our DNS zones.\n\n270\n00:14:39.415 --> 00:14:43.555\nAnd our DNS zone,\nthis is where we store resource records,\n\n271\n00:14:43.555 --> 00:14:46.135\nname to IP address mappings.\n\n272\n00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:50.500\nAnd what an SPF record does,\nis it states who or\n\n273\n00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:57.180\nwhat machines are allowed to send\nemails on our domain's behalf, right?\n\n274\n00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.297\nAnd when a receiving unit,\n\n275\n00:14:59.297 --> 00:15:03.720\nlike those Barracuda Spam filters and\nthings like that.\n\n276\n00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.282\nWhen they get these emails,\n\n277\n00:15:05.282 --> 00:15:08.770\nthey can look at the IP address\nthat the email came from.\n\n278\n00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:10.258\nAnd they can do what's\ncalled a reverse lookup.\n\n279\n00:15:10.258 --> 00:15:13.873\nThey're gonna use something\nknown as PTR records,\n\n280\n00:15:13.873 --> 00:15:19.295\nwhich are pointer records,\nto turn that IP address back into a name.\n\n281\n00:15:19.295 --> 00:15:24.075\nAnd if that name doesn't match\nwho the email came from,\n\n282\n00:15:24.075 --> 00:15:26.455\nit can mark it as spam or it can drop it.\n\n283\n00:15:26.455 --> 00:15:30.125\nIt can say nope, that's no good, and\nthat's what the SPF record does.\n\n284\n00:15:30.125 --> 00:15:32.650\nThat sender policy framework denotes\n\n285\n00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:36.670\nwhat machines are allowed to send\nout emails on behalf of our domain.\n\n286\n00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:39.895\nSo you go a new DNS, and again we're not\ngoing to get into the technical details.\n\n287\n00:15:39.895 --> 00:15:46.430\nIt's a text record that gets placed in\nDNS that lists your valid email servers.\n\n288\n00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:50.835\nAnd that way, when somebody's trying to\ndetermine whether your email is spam or\n\n289\n00:15:50.835 --> 00:15:53.122\nnot, they can look that information up.\n\n290\n00:15:53.122 --> 00:15:56.173\nAnd if it's something you sent\nthat came off your email server,\n\n291\n00:15:56.173 --> 00:15:58.080\neverything should be good.\n\n292\n00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:01.520\nBut if it's a bad guy trying to\nfake an email from your company,\n\n293\n00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.660\nit's gonna be able to detect that.\n\n294\n00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:07.610\nAnd it's gonna mark those as spam,\nand not allow them to be delivered.\n\n295\n00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.320\nAnd I kind of already, then,\nhinted at the last topic.\n\n296\n00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.560\nIt was the-\n&gt;&gt; The PTR records?\n\n297\n00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.792\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the PTR records.\n\n298\n00:16:12.792 --> 00:16:17.140\nNormally, when we talk about DNS,\nwe do what's called a forward lookup.\n\n299\n00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:21.440\nWhere I know the name, I wanna go to\nnewegg.com or I wanna go to facebook.com.\n\n300\n00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:25.420\nI know the name,\nwhat I need is the IP address.\n\n301\n00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:29.020\nSo DNS provides what's called forward\nlook up, give me the name and\n\n302\n00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.600\nI'll tell you the IP address.\n\n303\n00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.460\nJust like when you take a phone book out,\nyou look up the name and\n\n304\n00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.020\nyou find the number that you want to call.\n\n305\n00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.330\nThat'd be a forward lookup.\n\n306\n00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:40.410\nOccasionally, however, we need to know\nthe name that goes with the number.\n\n307\n00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:43.550\nI know the number,\nI want to know the name that goes with it.\n\n308\n00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:46.680\nYou guys might have done this before,\nif you've ever got a call and\n\n309\n00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:50.084\nit just shows a phone number instead\nof a name and you go look that number\n\n310\n00:16:50.084 --> 00:16:54.060\nup to try to figure out what names\ngoes with it, that's a reverse lookup.\n\n311\n00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:55.840\nWe can do that with DNS as well.\n\n312\n00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:00.690\nSo PTR records are reversed\nlook up records.\n\n313\n00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:04.710\nThey'll say, hey, this IP address\ngoes to this particular name.\n\n314\n00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:09.826\nAnd those are used in conjunction\nwith SPF and other things, but\n\n315\n00:17:09.826 --> 00:17:16.190\nit's one of the ways we can verify the\nvalidity of the originator of that email.\n\n316\n00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:17.166\n&gt;&gt; Wow, lots of good information.\n\n317\n00:17:17.166 --> 00:17:19.338\nYou know MTA, security fundamentals, and\n\n318\n00:17:19.338 --> 00:17:23.160\nwe're looking to email protection right\nthis second and you did a great job.\n\n319\n00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.350\nLet's wrap it all up, though.\n\n320\n00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:28.344\n&gt;&gt; In the end, I think the biggest\nthing we can do is one, just for\n\n321\n00:17:28.344 --> 00:17:30.310\nour own benefit not so much for the exam.\n\n322\n00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:32.590\nKeep in mind that email is not secure.\n\n323\n00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:37.074\nIt is not a way to transmit sensitive\ninformation, it cannot be trusted.\n\n324\n00:17:37.074 --> 00:17:39.617\nI mean,\nI don't want to scare everybody and\n\n325\n00:17:39.617 --> 00:17:42.665\nsound like I'm running\naround with a tin foil hat.\n\n326\n00:17:42.665 --> 00:17:47.341\nEmail definitely has it's purposes, but\nnot for sensitive information, not for\n\n327\n00:17:47.341 --> 00:17:49.560\npersonal identifiable information.\n\n328\n00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:55.500\nNever trust the origin validate,\nverify, call.\n\n329\n00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.032\nSay, hey, did you send me that email.\n\n330\n00:17:57.032 --> 00:17:59.282\nBecause email is a easy way for\n\n331\n00:17:59.282 --> 00:18:04.610\nthe bad guys to bypass our security,\nand infect our machines.\n\n332\n00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:05.930\nSo be careful with email.\n\n333\n00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:08.920\nYeah, I think that's where we'll leave it.\n\n334\n00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:09.446\n&gt;&gt; That's perfect, though.\n\n335\n00:18:09.446 --> 00:18:10.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's absolutely perfect.\n\n336\n00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:13.980\nMTA Security Fundamentals,\nthere is lots of episodes in this series.\n\n337\n00:18:13.980

it.\n\n340\n00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:18.978\n&gt;&gt; Great job, Mike.\n\n341\n00:18:18.978 --> 00:18:22.564\nYou know a good IT Pro is always learning.\n\n342\n00:18:22.564 --> 00:18:23.624\nI'm Zach

ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:15.154 --> 00:00:17.970\nwhere we help you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.920\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we continue\non with MTA Security Fundamentals.\n\n8\n00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.340\nAnd today, we're talking about server\nprotection with the man who can give us\n\n9\n00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.010\nall the information we need about that,\nMike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.940\nHey, Mike, how you doing?\n\n11\n00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.080\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic, Zach.\n\n12\n00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.090\nThanks for having me back.\n\n13\n00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.530\nAnd yeah, good old server protection.\n\n14\n00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:33.500\nA lot to talk about that.\n\n15\n00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.750\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure that there's a lot\nto know about server protection.\n\n16\n00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.647\nSo let's just jump right in and\nget started.\n\n17\n00:00:39.647 --> 00:00:40.750\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a plan.\n\n18\n00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.954\nAll right, so the first thing\nwe really wanna talk about.\n\n19\n00:00:43.954 --> 00:00:47.620\nI think we mentioned in another episode,\nwhere we were talking about client\n\n20\n00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.027\nprotection, email protection and\nwe said that,\n\n21\n00:00:50.027 --> 00:00:53.831\nservers require a little more protection\nthan we typically spend on clients.\n\n22\n00:00:53.831 --> 00:00:55.681\nAnd that's because of a few things.\n\n23\n00:00:55.681 --> 00:01:00.290\nOne, an outage on a server typically\naffects a lot more than just one person.\n\n24\n00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.120\n&gt;&gt; It could be devastating.\n\n25\n00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's never gonna be good.\n\n26\n00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.120\nAnd that they are exposed a little\nmore than our clients, usually,\n\n27\n00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.010\nbecause they are offering services.\n\n28\n00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.830\nThey have listeners that are waiting for\nconnections.\n\n29\n00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.940\nThat's all just avenues of attack for\nthe bad guys.\n\n30\n00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.110\nThey like that.\n\n31\n00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.240\nSo they do require a little more work\nwhen it comes to protecting them.\n\n32\n00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.920\nAnd we call it hardening a server.\n\n33\n00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.080\nAnd we'll kind of come back around to\nthat concept and what it means, but\n\n34\n00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.518\nreally that's what we\nare talking about here.\n\n35\n00:01:28.518 --> 00:01:32.790\nAnd one of the first things we can do is,\nwhen we are getting ready to deploy a new\n\n36\n00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.680\nserver, what we need to think about is,\nwhere are we deploying it?\n\n37\n00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.350\nAnd I mean physically\nas well as logically.\n\n38\n00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.100\n&gt;&gt; Like offsite or onsite,\nthat type of thing?\n\n39\n00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.700\n&gt;&gt; Well, more about like,\nit could be though,\n\n40\n00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.360\nwe might be running it out on the cloud,\nor\n\n41\n00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.280\nwe might be renting rack space from\nsomewhere, it might be on-premise.\n\n42\n00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.380\nBut let's say we're doing it on-premise,\n\n43\n00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.480\nbecause that's really\nwhere we have the control.\n\n44\n00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.186\nUsually, we've talked about this before,\nwe've talked about layers of defense and\n\n45\n00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:02.645\nwetalked about the zones and\nthe perimeter.\n\n46\n00:02:02.645 --> 00:02:06.279\nAnd then the exterior of our building,\nand then inside our building, and\n\n47\n00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:08.610\nthen secure zones within our building.\n\n48\n00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.260\nWell when we deploy a new server,\n\n49\n00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.970\nwe don't just put it under\nthe receptionist desk, right?\n\n50\n00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.090\nOr in a corner somewhere, we want good\nphysical security over those servers.\n\n51\n00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.770\nWe typically have an area\nwithin our building that has\n\n52\n00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.860\nanother layer of security on it.\n\n53\n00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.610\nIf we were to go look at\nour server closet, and\n\n54\n00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.430\na lot of you have seen it in Studio Four\nover there, when you look there,\n\n55\n00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.550\nthere's a door that leads in that server\ncloset, and it has a keypad on it.\n\n56\n00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.640\nSo even if you have an access\ncard to get in the building,\n\n57\n00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.780\nyou might not be able to\nget into the server closet.\n\n58\n00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.260\nThat's an extra layer of security there.\n\n59\n00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.780\nNot everybody needs to be able to\nlay hands on those servers, right?\n\n60\n00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.050\nThat physical access.\n\n61\n00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.980\nSo that's the first thing, is just\nphysical security on the those servers.\n\n62\n00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.088\nThen logically as well, even though its\nsecured physically inside a server closet,\n\n63\n00:02:57.088 --> 00:03:00.770\nlogically I wanna protect it\nfrom the rest of the network.\n\n64\n00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.200\nThat means isolating it,\nwe've talked about domain and\n\n65\n00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.230\nserver isolation, we talked about VLANs,\n\n66\n00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.892\nthis is how I can separate that\nserver from the rest of our network.\n\n67\n00:03:10.892 --> 00:03:14.092\nIt's gonna help performance, first of all,\nbecause if I put it on its own subnet or\n\n68\n00:03:14.092 --> 00:03:17.060\nits own VLAN, it doesn't have to\ncompete with all the other nodes and\n\n69\n00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.900\nall the other broadcast traffic.\n\n70\n00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.360\nIt also gives us a chance to\ncontrol what types of traffic or\n\n71\n00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.660\nwho is allowed to connect to\nthat particular VLAN or subnet.\n\n72\n00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.970\nSo that's another, again,\nlayer of security.\n\n73\n00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.698\nSo when you deploy it, there's some things\nyou gotta think about before you even put\n\n74\n00:03:32.698 --> 00:03:34.024\nthat server on your network.\n\n75\n00:03:34.024 --> 00:03:35.742\nWhere am I gonna deploy it physically?\n\n76\n00:03:35.742 --> 00:03:37.960\nAnd then,\nhow am I gonna deploy it logically?\n\n77\n00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.270\nHow am I gonna segregate it out from\nthe rest of my network, all right?\n\n78\n00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.770\nAnd then there's something known\nas a read-only domain controller.\n\n79\n00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.960\nThey throw this in the objectives,\nso I wanna go ahead and cover it.\n\n80\n00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.070\nAgain, this class,\nthis is not our MCSA or MCSE.\n\n81\n00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.740\nAt this point, we just wanna\nkinda understand these topics.\n\n82\n00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.250\nSo don't kill yourself learning\nhow to install read-only\n\n83\n00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.770\ndomain controller, things like that.\n\n84\n00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.790\nJust be familiar with this concept.\n\n85\n00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.164\nAnd really the name kinda\ntells you a lot about it.\n\n86\n00:04:05.164 --> 00:04:10.420\nRead-only domain controller,\njust from that I can infer that one,\n\n87\n00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.120\nit's a domain controller, and two, I'm\nnot gonna be able to make changes on it.\n\n88\n00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.337\nI can read things on it, but\nI can't make changes to it.\n\n89\n00:04:18.337 --> 00:04:22.820\nRead-only domain controllers were\ndesigned for a specific purpose.\n\n90\n00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:30.430\nPlaces where I do not have a good level of\nphysical security, like my branch office.\n\n91\n00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.890\nHere at the corporate office we\ngot all the bells and whistles.\n\n92\n00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.620\nWe've got our server closet,\nwe've got big IT staff.\n\n93\n00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.560\nEverything's hunky-dory.\n\n94\n00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.175\nOut there at the branch office,\nthere is no server closet, right?\n\n95\n00:04:40.175 --> 00:04:44.230\nIt's a little small office space,\nI've got four employees out there.\n\n96\n00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.660\nBut when they go to login in the morning,\nthey're having to go across the WAN to\n\n97\n00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.080\nconnect to the corporate office\nto talk to the domain controller.\n\n98\n00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.850\nWhich can be lengthy, and if there's\nany congestion or network outage,\n\n99\n00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.010\nthey can't authenticate,\nthey can't connect to resources.\n\n100\n00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.500\nSo that becomes a problem.\n\n101\n00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.910\nSo hey, let's put a domain controller\nout there at the branch office.\n\n102\n00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.920\nNow think back to what we just said,\nwhen you deploy a server, what do we do?\n\n103\n00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.550\nI'm talking about physically deploying\nit to a secure location, and logically.\n\n104\n00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.630\nWell, the branch office,\nthere is no server closet, right?\n\n105\n00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.220\nSo I don't have that luxury,\nthat physical security.\n\n106\n00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.810\nSo what I can do is deploy\na read-only domain controller.\n\n107\n00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.280\nThis is gonna reduce\nmy risk because I know\n\n108\n00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.780\nI don't have the physical\nsecurity I would like.\n\n109\n00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.280\nSo how can I deal with that?\n\n110\n00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.810\nMake a read-only domain controller.\n\n111\n00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.546\nThat way, if the bad guy is able to\nget into that branch office, like when\n\n112\n00:05:36.546 --> 00:05:40.725\nnobody's looking or pretending to be\na phone repair guy or something like that.\n\n113\n00:05:40.725 --> 00:05:43.567\nAnd he tries to get access to that\ndomain controller cuz it's not\n\n114\n00:05:43.567 --> 00:05:45.800\nlocked away in another level of security.\n\n115\n00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.932\nIf he does get access to it,\nhe can't do anything but read information,\n\n116\n00:05:49.932 --> 00:05:53.858\nwhich is bad, but not as bad as if\nhe could make new accounts on there,\n\n117\n00:05:53.858 --> 00:05:55.625\ngive himself-\n&gt;&gt; Or corrupt it.\n\n118\n00:05:55.625 --> 00:05:59.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or corrupt it, and have that\ncorruption replicate back to my corporate\n\n119\n00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.518\noffice and hit all those\ndomain controllers, all right?\n\n120\n00:06:01.518 --> 00:06:06.160\nSo read-only domain controllers\nallow me look up information,\n\n121\n00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.800\nto authenticate things like that, but\nnot make changes, not create new accounts.\n\n122\n00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.320\nI can't even change passwords.\n\n123\n00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.350\nIf a legitimate user is trying to\nchange a password, the read-only\n\n124\n00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.220\ndemand controller has to forward it\nback to a read-write domain controller,\n\n125\n00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.140\none of my normal domain controllers.\n\n126\n00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.150\nSo it's a way I can provide\na little bit of security or\n\n127\n00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.480\nreduce my risk when I don't have\nthat physical security I would like.\n\n128\n00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.150\n&gt;&gt; Can you run all services on one server\nor through one server, or should you?\n\n129\n00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:34.015\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a better question.\n\n130\n00:06:34.015 --> 00:06:35.042\n&gt;&gt; That's a better question.\n\n131\n00:06:35.042 --> 00:06:35.563\nShould you do that?\n\n132\n00:06:35.563 --> 00:06:37.520\n&gt;&gt; The answer to the first\nquestion is absolutely.\n\n133\n00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.420\nI mean, if you've got enough horsepower,\nyou can do that.\n\n134\n00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:41.488\nShould you?\n\n135\n00:06:41.488 --> 00:06:43.390\nNo.\n&gt;&gt; No, I didn't think so.\n\n136\n00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:45.740\n&gt;&gt; I think I've used the old\nphrase several times,\n\n137\n00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:46.980\nputting all your eggs in one basket.\n\n138\n00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.200\nAnd that's really what you're doing if\nyou try to run all your services on\n\n139\n00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.060\na single server.\n\n140\n00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.450\nIf that one server goes down,\nand it will eventually, right?\n\n141\n00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:57.560\nI mean, something is gonna happen,\n\n142\n00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.930\nyou lose everything,\nall of a sudden nothing is available.\n\n143\n00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.800\nWhereas if I had separated\nout my services,\n\n144\n00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.750\nif I had put my website on a different\nserver from my domain controller,\n\n145\n00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.650\nif that server that's hosting the website\ngoes down, I still have Active Directory.\n\n146\n00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.350\nI still have DNS, whatever.\n\n147\n00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:20.940\nSo splitting services is up is a way\nthat I can provide a little bit\n\n148\n00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:26.500\nof protection against that failure, of not\nlosing everything if it all goes down.\n\n149\n00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.480\nTypically what we say is\nthink about the services and\n\n150\n00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.270\nthe level of security they require.\n\n151\n00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:37.330\nLike Active Directory, that's a sensitive\nservice, not everybody has access to that.\n\n152\n00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.135\nI don't want that exposed to the public.\n\n153\n00:07:39.135 --> 00:07:42.630\nA web server does need\naccess to the public,\n\n154\n00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:46.540\nI want them to be able to come to\nmy website and buy my product.\n\n155\n00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:49.737\nSo I'm not gonna put those two\nroles on the same machine,\n\n156\n00:07:49.737 --> 00:07:52.747\nbecause they require\ndifferent levels of security.\n\n157\n00:07:52.747 --> 00:07:57.775\nThat's usually how we divide things up,\nis based on security requirements,\n\n158\n00:07:57.775 --> 00:08:02.207\nas well as access requirements,\nas well as resource requirements.\n\n159\n00:08:02.207 --> 00:08:04.750\nThat's typically what\nwe're looking at there.\n\n160\n00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.017\nAnd then earlier you mentioned hardening.\n\n161\n00:08:07.017 --> 00:08:07.841\nSo can we go back to that?\n\n162\n00:08:07.841 --> 00:08:09.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's do.\n\n163\n00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:15.210\nWhen we talk about hardening, it's a name\nthat we've given to really applying\n\n164\n00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:20.510\nthe best security practices to our\nmachines, hardening them against attack.\n\n165\n00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.170\nIt is really what they're\ntalking about there.\n\n166\n00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:24.280\nAnd there's several things that we can do.\n\n167\n00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.320\nYou've heard me mention this term as well,\nattack surface.\n\n168\n00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.680\nA server, well, any machine, but\n\n169\n00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.420\nwe're talking about servers here,\nhas what's known as an attack surface.\n\n170\n00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:36.250\nAnd that is all of the different ways\nthat this machine might be vulnerable.\n\n171\n00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:40.860\nThe different ways that bad guys\nmight try to compromise that machine.\n\n172\n00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.760\nAnd so what we do,\nwhen we're hardening a server,\n\n173\n00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.010\nis we try to reduce that attack surface.\n\n174\n00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.670\nWe wanna eliminate as many as possible\n\n175\n00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:51.688\nof those different ways that\nthe bad guys can get in.\n\n176\n00:08:51.688 --> 00:08:55.860\nBy reducing the attack surface we're\nreducing the risk we're exposed to\n\n177\n00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.260\nby operating that server.\n\n178\n00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.080\nAnd so,\nhow do we reduce that attack surface?\n\n179\n00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.430\nWell we eliminate\nunnecessary applications.\n\n180\n00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.830\nWe don't run anything that we don't need.\n\n181\n00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:11.810\nServices that are running,\nif we don't need them, we turn them off.\n\n182\n00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:14.960\nThe services that are running,\nwe follow our best practices.\n\n183\n00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:19.210\nYou know Microsoft puts out all\nkinds of security best practices and\n\n184\n00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:21.720\nbase lines that we can\napply to our servers.\n\n185\n00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:27.060\nWhen I say base line, these are base\nsecurity settings that should be applied.\n\n186\n00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:31.050\nSo Microsoft has baseline security\nsettings for a server in general.\n\n187\n00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:33.490\nThese are things you should do\nto every one of your servers.\n\n188\n00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:37.100\nAnd then if that server is running DNS,\nwe can go out to Microsoft and\n\n189\n00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.072\nwe can get a DNS best practice.\n\n190\n00:09:39.072 --> 00:09:42.500\nAnd it'll tell us, hey this is the kind\nof things you should do to harden a DNS\n\n191\n00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.290\nserver, or if it's a DHCP server,\nor a domain controller.\n\n192\n00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:49.550\nSo take advantage of that, go out there\nto Microsoft and get those resources.\n\n193\n00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:53.340\nYou can download them freely, Microsoft\nhas been doing this for some time.\n\n194\n00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:57.640\nThey have a lot of experience,\nthey deal with a lot of customers and\n\n195\n00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.830\nover time they've developed\nthese best practices.\n\n196\n00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.030\nAnd so rather than start from scratch and\n\n197\n00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:06.380\nhave to learn everything on our own,\nwhy not take advantage?\n\n198\n00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.810\nWhat is it they say about standing\non the shoulders of giants,\n\n199\n00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:10.722\nthat's what we wanna do.\n\n200\n00:10:10.722 --> 00:10:15.360\nWe wanna take advantage of that\ninformation that's out there.\n\n201\n00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.620\nSo apply your best practices.\n\n202\n00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.890\nApply those security guidelines.\n\n203\n00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.210\nWe've talked about updates and patching.\n\n204\n00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:23.260\nServers are no different than clients.\n\n205\n00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:27.510\nWe have to go out to Microsoft or\nuse our WSUS or whatever it is and\n\n206\n00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:30.760\napply those critical and\nsecurity related updates.\n\n207\n00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.070\nAny applications that are running\non that server also need to be\n\n208\n00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:35.460\npatched and updated.\n\n209\n00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.840\nSo make sure we're paying\nattention to that.\n\n210\n00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.472\n&gt;&gt; Can you put a firewall around a server?\n\n211\n00:10:40.472 --> 00:10:43.830\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, we talked about that\nwhen we were talking about clients.\n\n212\n00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:47.270\nI can have a perimeter firewall\nthat protects my entire network.\n\n213\n00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.500\nI might have a firewall at\nthe edge of that VLAN or\n\n214\n00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.350\nsubnet that protects\njust that little subnet.\n\n215\n00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:54.590\nBut then I'm also gonna have\na firewall on the host or\n\n216\n00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:57.638\nthe server itself that's\nprotecting that server.\n\n217\n00:10:57.638 --> 00:11:00.820\nBecause that's gonna allow me to\ncontrol the traffic that's going in and\n\n218\n00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:03.230\nout of that particular machine.\n\n219\n00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:05.170\nSo, definitely run, especially,\n\n220\n00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:09.540\nyour servers, we want that firewall\non there to protect it again.\n\n221\n00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.400\nIt's really all about\nreducing that attack surface.\n\n222\n00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.355\n&gt;&gt; I'm just full of questions today,\nI can't help myself.\n\n223\n00:11:14.355 --> 00:11:16.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Do we need to update a server,\n\n224\n00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:20.260\nwe update devices, we update personal\ncomputers, do we update servers as well?\n\n225\n00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n226\n00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.930\nMake sure that you're going\nto be applying those.\n\n227\n00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:27.930\nAgain, whatever your company is doing,\nif you're using WSUS or\n\n228\n00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:32.760\nSystem Center Configuration Manager to\ncontrol what updates are going out,\n\n229\n00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.616\ngiving you the ability to test\nthem before you apply them,\n\n230\n00:11:35.616 --> 00:11:39.640\ncuz you don't wanna apply an untested\nupdate to a production server.\n\n231\n00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:43.660\nSo it's important that we test\nthem first in a test environment\n\n232\n00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:46.420\nbefore we deploy them out because\nremember what we said a little bit ago,\n\n233\n00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:49.420\nclient goes down,\nthat's bad for that user.\n\n234\n00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.650\nServer goes down, that's bad for\nmy entire network.\n\n235\n00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:55.040\nSo we definitely want to be careful.\n\n236\n00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:58.975\nWe want to apply updates, but\nwe wanna test them as well.\n\n237\n00:11:58.975 --> 00:12:02.710\nSo, all of that together is really\nwhat hardening is all about.\n\n238\n00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:06.230\nLike I mentioned services,\ndisabling unnecessary services.\n\n239\n00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:09.230\nIt's a lot better nowadays with\nour modern operating systems.\n\n240\n00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:12.100\nI remember back in, Server 2000 or\n\n241\n00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:17.400\n2000 Server, where you would install IIS\nbecause you wanted to run a website.\n\n242\n00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:21.890\nIIS is internet information services,\nit's Microsoft's web server role.\n\n243\n00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:25.080\nAnd when you installed it,\nit installed IIS but\n\n244\n00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:29.110\nit also installed your network\nnews transfer protocol, your NNTP,\n\n245\n00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:33.620\nit installed FTP, I think it installed,\nI forget what else it installed.\n\n246\n00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:37.102\nIt installed three or four different\nthings, things you didn't ask for.\n\n247\n00:12:37.102 --> 00:12:40.784\nSo you as an admin would go and\nconfigure and harden IIS, but\n\n248\n00:12:40.784 --> 00:12:46.030\nmight not even realize that your server\nwas now listening on FTP ports 20 and 21.\n\n249\n00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:51.100\nSo, turning things like that off and\nhow do we find these things?\n\n250\n00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:52.950\nWell, we look at task manager.\n\n251\n00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:56.280\nWe scan our own systems looking for\nopen ports and\n\n252\n00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.170\ntrying to determine what services\nare listening on those ports.\n\n253\n00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:02.260\nAnd if we find they are unnecessary,\nturn them off.\n\n254\n00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.790\nThat's reducing your attack service.\n\n255\n00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:11.040\n&gt;&gt; Mike, are all authentication protocols,\nare they all the same?\n\n256\n00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.730\n&gt;&gt; They're not and that's another\nthing we can do to harden our\n\n257\n00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:17.110\nservers is pay attention to\nthe authentication protocols we're using.\n\n258\n00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:18.260\nWith Windows and\n\n259\n00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:22.790\nActive Directory we're using Kerberos\ntypically as our authentication protocol.\n\n260\n00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:27.290\nBut when we start installing other\nservices, like web services or we wanna\n\n261\n00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:31.618\nrun an FTP server, we then have to choose\nwhat authentication method is going to be.\n\n262\n00:13:31.618 --> 00:13:35.870\nNow if we're just using it in-house,\nso it's just employees,\n\n263\n00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:37.600\npeople that are part of my domain,\n\n264\n00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.110\nwe can stay with Kerberos, which is\na good strong authentication protocol.\n\n265\n00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:45.570\nBut if we're setting up a website that\nthe public is gonna access or business\n\n266\n00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:49.190\npartners are gonna access, they're not\ngonna have accounts in our directory.\n\n267\n00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:52.500\nSo Kerberos is not gonna be available\nas an authentication protocol.\n\n268\n00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.960\nSo there are several others\nwe can choose from and\n\n269\n00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.640\nit's important that we choose wisely.\n\n270\n00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.900\nBecause there's things like\npassword authentication protocol,\n\n271\n00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:04.800\nwhich is an older authentication protocol,\nbut it sent the password in plain text.\n\n272\n00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:09.250\nIn other words, if someone was using a\npacket capture utility, they could capture\n\n273\n00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:12.280\nyour authentication packet, and\nthey could see the password in there.\n\n274\n00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.170\nFTP uses plain text when it authenticates.\n\n275\n00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.070\nSo when you send your\npassword to an FTP server,\n\n276\n00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:22.580\nif anybody is watching that traffic\nthey can see your password.\n\n277\n00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:26.660\nSo we do things like on our website,\nwe choose better authentication methods.\n\n278\n00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:31.490\nWe uncheck PAP,\ndon't turn that authentication method on.\n\n279\n00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:33.780\nStick with things that we know are secure.\n\n280\n00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:38.730\nWith FTP, this is gonna sound like an odd\none, but with FTP we have two choices.\n\n281\n00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:43.380\nWe could run secure FTP,\nwhich does encrypt the traffic, or\n\n282\n00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.620\nwe could just run FTP with no passwords.\n\n283\n00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:48.190\nYou're like well wait\nhow is that more secure?\n\n284\n00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:50.350\nWell, it depends.\n\n285\n00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:53.770\nIf it's sensitive information that needs\nto be protected, that's not an option.\n\n286\n00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:57.390\nBut if it's publicly\navailable information,\n\n287\n00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:00.700\nyou wanna run an FTP site,\njust don't use passwords.\n\n288\n00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.500\nBecause typically what a user\nis gonna do is use their work\n\n289\n00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.860\npassword as their password\nof that FTP site.\n\n290\n00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:10.010\nAnd so, FTP transmits in plain text,\nsomebody can steal that password.\n\n291\n00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:13.020\nNow, they're gonna see if they happen\nto use the same password as their\n\n292\n00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:14.550\nwork password.\n\n293\n00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:16.380\nSo by using FTP in anonymous mode,\n\n294\n00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:19.680\nI don't have to worry about\nusers sending their passwords.\n\n295\n00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.180\nNow it doesn't protect my resources,\n\n296\n00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.920\nso these have gotta be\npublicly available resources.\n\n297\n00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.656\nOne way they will tell you to secure\nyour FTP is to use anonymous access,\n\n298\n00:15:27.656 --> 00:15:31.410\ncuz you're not sending\npasswords across the network.\n\n299\n00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:32.900\nNow the last thing I want to talk about,\nZach,\n\n300\n00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.860\nis something known as\nsecure dynamic updates.\n\n301\n00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:38.620\nAnd this has to do with the service\nknown as DNS which we've\n\n302\n00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:42.090\ntalked a little bit about\nin previous episodes.\n\n303\n00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:47.380\nAnd DNS is my domain name system, it's\nhow we resolve names into IP addresses.\n\n304\n00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.997\nIt's like a phone book for computers.\n\n305\n00:15:49.997 --> 00:15:54.621\nWell when you set up a network, a domain,\nall the client machines and servers for\n\n306\n00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:59.313\nthat matter, your Windows operating\nsystems, they're gonna connect to DNS And\n\n307\n00:15:59.313 --> 00:16:03.393\ncreate an entry just like when you\nget phone service for the first time,\n\n308\n00:16:03.393 --> 00:16:06.453\nthey have to make a new entry for\nyou in the phonebook so\n\n309\n00:16:06.453 --> 00:16:08.502\npeople can look you up and call you.\n\n310\n00:16:08.502 --> 00:16:12.370\nWell when you add new computers to the\ndomain that same thing has to happen and\n\n311\n00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:16.460\nthere is a dynamic process where\nthe computers can do that on their own.\n\n312\n00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:19.950\nWhen I set up this laptop and\nconnect it to my domain the first time,\n\n313\n00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:21.620\nthis computer is gonna\nreach out to DNS and\n\n314\n00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:26.410\nsay hey my name is laptop 01 and\nthis is my IP address.\n\n315\n00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:28.517\nCan you make a record for me in DNS so\n\n316\n00:16:28.517 --> 00:16:32.748\nif anybody ever looks up my name you\ncan tell them how to connect to me.\n\n317\n00:16:32.748 --> 00:16:36.165\nAnd that's a good thing because if we\ndidn't have dynamic updates we'd have to\n\n318\n00:16:36.165 --> 00:16:39.633\ndo all that manually, I'd have to go in\nthere and type all these records out, and\n\n319\n00:16:39.633 --> 00:16:43.270\nI'd make typos, I'd forget to do\nsomething and it'd be a bad day.\n\n320\n00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:46.000\nBut the downside of that\nwhile that's convenient.\n\n321\n00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.680\nRemember, convenience and security\ntypically don't go together, right?\n\n322\n00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.989\nIt's usually one or the other, so\nthat's very convenient, not very secure,\n\n323\n00:16:53.989 --> 00:16:56.901\nbecause what if somebody\nthat comes into my network.\n\n324\n00:16:56.901 --> 00:16:59.555\nLet's say we have a vendor come by,\na contractor,\n\n325\n00:16:59.555 --> 00:17:01.710\na salesperson from some company.\n\n326\n00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:06.110\nIf they connect to my network, their\ncomputer can connect to my DNS server and\n\n327\n00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:07.910\nmake a record in there.\n\n328\n00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:09.520\nAnd if they can do that,\n\n329\n00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.790\nthat means they might be able to try\nto put malicious records in there.\n\n330\n00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:16.500\nRemember we talked about farming and\nhow I can put a record in DNS and\n\n331\n00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:20.540\ntry to redirect you to a fake\nBank of America site or a fake\n\n332\n00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:25.320\nfile server that you think is my file\nserver on my network, but it's not, right?\n\n333\n00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.900\nSo having those dynamic updates is good.\n\n334\n00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.420\nBut it can also be a risk as well.\n\n335\n00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:36.000\nThe way we would deal with that is\nto enable secure dynamic updates and\n\n336\n00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.180\nit's not on by default but we can turn\nit on to where only domain members\n\n337\n00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.120\nare allowed to make those\nnew records in DNS.\n\n338\n00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:48.292\nThis is going to allow new laptops that\nwe add to our network to still do that\n\n339\n00:17:48.292 --> 00:17:51.119\ndynamic process, but\nwhen that vendor comes in or\n\n340\n00:17:51.119 --> 00:17:55.256\nthat guy sitting outside in that\ncreepy van connecting to your network.\n\n341\n00:17:55.256 --> 00:17:57.776\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They're not gonna be able to make\n\n342\n00:17:57.776 --> 00:18:01.641\nconnect, they're not going to be able\nto create new records in DNS and\n\n343\n00:18:01.641 --> 00:18:04.000\nit's going to help keep me safe.\n\n344\n00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.713\nNow I'll show you how to do it\njust because I like demoing stuff.\n\n345\n00:18:06.713 --> 00:18:09.313\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This exam is not going to get you\n\n346\n00:18:09.313 --> 00:18:11.990\non the particular how-tos on most of this.\n\n347\n00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:14.456\nIt's really just making sure\nyou understand the concepts.\n\n348\n00:18:14.456 --> 00:18:15.501\nBut let's take a look at it.\n\n349\n00:18:15.501 --> 00:18:16.290\nIt's easy breezy.\n\n350\n00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:17.329\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Security fundamentals.\n\n351\n00:18:17.329 --> 00:18:17.991\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n352\n00:18:17.991 --> 00:18:18.668\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n353\n00:18:18.668 --> 00:18:22.538\n&gt;&gt; So if you take a look at my screen\nhere, I've got my DNS console open, and\n\n354\n00:18:22.538 --> 00:18:24.260\nI've got my zone sitting here.\n\n355\n00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:25.749\nAnd you can see, not a big domain.\n\n356\n00:18:25.749 --> 00:18:27.520\nI have two computers.\n\n357\n00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:34.137\nBut you can see client 01 is 10108125,\nDC 01 is 10108200.\n\n358\n00:18:34.137 --> 00:18:35.379\nSo this is what DNS does.\n\n359\n00:18:35.379 --> 00:18:38.448\nIf somebody wants to connect to DC 01.\n\n360\n00:18:38.448 --> 00:18:41.970\nOr like when I connected to that\nshare in that other episode.\n\n361\n00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:43.730\nMy machine needs the IP address.\n\n362\n00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:47.240\nSo It called up DNS and said,\nhey, I wanna connect to DCO1.\n\n363\n00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.790\nWhat's its IP address?\n\n364\n00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:53.783\nAnd the DNS server said,\nwell DCO1, that's 10.10.8.200.\n\n365\n00:18:53.783 --> 00:18:56.310\nAnd then my client machine\nwas allowed to connect to it.\n\n366\n00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:59.849\nSo, that's just a real\nquick refresher on DNS.\n\n367\n00:18:59.849 --> 00:19:02.360\nNow, the whole dynamic update thing.\n\n368\n00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.718\nI'm gonna go over to my zone here,\nlab.itpro.tv.\n\n369\n00:19:05.718 --> 00:19:09.690\nI'm gonna right-click on it and\nI'm gonna choose properties.\n\n370\n00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:12.582\nAnd here, I can see that option for\ndynamic updates.\n\n371\n00:19:12.582 --> 00:19:14.358\nIt's right there on the general tab, and\n\n372\n00:19:14.358 --> 00:19:18.230\nyou can see I've already changed this to\nsecure, but let me show you the options.\n\n373\n00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:22.870\nThere's none which now there\nwon't be any dynamic updates.\n\n374\n00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:26.313\nIn a high security environment,\nthis might be what you do.\n\n375\n00:19:26.313 --> 00:19:30.590\nOn public facing DNS servers,\nyou're gonna set this to none.\n\n376\n00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:35.360\nI do not want anybody on the outside\nworld creating records on my DNS server.\n\n377\n00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:39.731\nSo I'm gonna sacrifice the convenience\nof dynamic updates for security.\n\n378\n00:19:39.731 --> 00:19:44.470\nYes I'll have to manually create the\nrecords on that public facing DNS server.\n\n379\n00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:46.420\nBut usually there's only a few, right?\n\n380\n00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.290\nAll the publically available\nresources like my web server,\n\n381\n00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:51.080\nmail server things like that.\n\n382\n00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.010\nInternal DNS servers though.\n\n383\n00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:57.320\nI really want to take advantage of that\ndynamic updates so my options are either,\n\n384\n00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:01.710\nnonsecure and secure which means\nsecure update's gonna happen.\n\n385\n00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:04.860\nBut if it doesn't support security or\nif somebody that's not part of my domain,\n\n386\n00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:09.150\nthere'll still be able to do it cuz\nit says nonsecure as well as secure.\n\n387\n00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:10.825\nThe last option is secure only.\n\n388\n00:20:10.825 --> 00:20:13.650\nAnd this is really what you\nwanna set in most environments.\n\n389\n00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:14.320\nThis way,\n\n390\n00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:19.910\nonly authorized computers are allowed\nto create records on your DNS server.\n\n391\n00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:21.050\nAnd it's simple as that, right.\n\n392\n00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:25.080\nIt's one little drop down list that I\njust have to go in and click okay to and\n\n393\n00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.550\nnow my DNS server is more secure.\n\n394\n00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.662\nSo when we look at hardening servers and\n\n395\n00:20:29.662 --> 00:20:34.279\nserver protection in general there's a few\nthings that we really wanna keep in mind.\n\n396\n00:20:34.279 --> 00:20:38.742\nWe look at the location of where\nwe're gonna deploy that server both\n\n397\n00:20:38.742 --> 00:20:41.110\nlogically and physically.\n\n398\n00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:43.875\nWe wanna think about the services\nthat we're running and\n\n399\n00:20:43.875 --> 00:20:45.435\nwe wanna split them up if we can.\n\n400\n00:20:45.435 --> 00:20:47.934\nI mean I'm not saying you have\nto have a separate server for\n\n401\n00:20:47.934 --> 00:20:49.920\nevery service you're running.\n\n402\n00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.637\nBut you don't want everything\non one machine, right?\n\n403\n00:20:52.637 --> 00:20:56.578\nSo split them up according to load,\nresource load,\n\n404\n00:20:56.578 --> 00:21:00.720\nsecurity requirements and\naccess requirements.\n\n405\n00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.650\nIf It's publicly available,\nput all those roles on one server.\n\n406\n00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:07.900\nKeep your internal only resources\n\n407\n00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:11.540\non servers that host other\ninternal only resources.\n\n408\n00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:17.744\nHarden your servers, and that means doing\nthings like applying all of your security\n\n409\n00:21:17.744 --> 00:21:22.698\npatches and your updates, reducing your\nattack surface by eliminating unnecessary\n\n410\n00:21:22.698 --> 00:21:24.642\nservices, running firewalls.\n\n411\n00:21:24.642 --> 00:21:28.951\nSo applying all of your patches, so\nkeeping those servers up to date, and\n\n412\n00:21:28.951 --> 00:21:32.979\nthen like I showed you with DNS,\nyou know, making sure that DNS, and\n\n413\n00:21:32.979 --> 00:21:34.455\nDNS is just one example.\n\n414\n00:21:34.455 --> 00:21:38.485\nThat's the one they call out on the exam\nobjective, but all of your services,\n\n415\n00:21:38.485 --> 00:21:42.685\nlike I said, go out and take advantage\nof Microsoft's extensive knowledge base.\n\n416\n00:21:42.685 --> 00:21:44.405\nLook for those baselines.\n\n417\n00:21:44.405 --> 00:21:45.785\nFind their best practices.\n\n418\n00:21:45.785 --> 00:21:50.030\nIf you're gonna set up an exchange server,\ndo a little research first.\n\n419\n00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:53.456\nDon't just go in there and click next,\nnext, next, install, and then go,\n\n420\n00:21:53.456 --> 00:21:54.788\nI wonder, how I secure this?\n\n421\n00:21:54.788 --> 00:21:57.920\nGo out to Microsoft,\nget their best practices guide.\n\n422\n00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:02.260\nThey'll talk about what you need to\ndo to securely install exchange.\n\n423\n00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.830\nThey'll tell you what accounts you\nshould create ahead of time in\n\n424\n00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:06.380\nactive directory, right?\n\n425\n00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.796\nWhat ports need to be open and\n\n426\n00:22:07.796 --> 00:22:11.749\nwhat ports don't need to be open to run\nthat Exchange Server or that SQL Server or\n\n427\n00:22:11.749 --> 00:22:15.006\nwhatever it is you're trying to setup so\ntake advantage of that.\n\n428\n00:22:15.006 --> 00:22:20.720\nAnd then lastly you know, make sure we're\nusing good authentication protocols.\n\n429\n00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.765\nTry to avoid things that,\ntry to completely avoid any type of\n\n430\n00:22:23.765 --> 00:22:28.090\nauthentication protocol that sends its\nusername or password in plain text.\n\n431\n00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:31.502\n&gt;&gt; Well Microsoft has dona a great job,\nand you've done an awesome job as well.\n\n432\n00:22:31.502 --> 00:22:35.303\nMTA
