Yeah, sure, not a problem, the MTA\nsecurity fundamentals is all about, well,\n\n6\n00:00:18.081 --> 00:00:18.786\nsecurity.\n\n7\n00:00:18.786 --> 00:00:22.884\nHoping you get that start in that\nsecurity road down that field, so\n\n8\n00:00:22.884 --> 00:00:25.883\nthat you can start to\nunderstand the concepts and\n\n9\n00:00:25.883 --> 00:00:30.220\npractices inside of a Windows\nenvironment when it comes to security.\n\n10\n00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.243\nThat's what they're trying to do,\nthey're trying to build that foundation.\n\n11\n00:00:32.243 --> 00:00:35.674\nSo that as you become more and\nmore of a security practitioner,\n\n12\n00:00:35.674 --> 00:00:38.328\nyou have a solid set of skills,\nunderstanding,\n\n13\n00:00:38.328 --> 00:00:42.234\nand precepts to continue your\nconversation with regards to security.\n\n14\n00:00:42.234 --> 00:00:44.604\n&gt;&gt; So in a broader view,\nwho is the show targeted towards?\n\n15\n00:00:44.604 --> 00:00:49.206\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question as well, it's\ntargeted toward people that wish to have,\n\n16\n00:00:49.206 --> 00:00:54.005\nA, a really good foundational knowledge of\nsecurity practices in a Windows operating\n\n17\n00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:55.580\nsystem environments.\n\n18\n00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.750\nSo this will be Windows desktops,\nas well as Windows servers.\n\n19\n00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.369\nAs well as the person that says,\nyou know what,\n\n20\n00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:08.210\nI want to not only be an IT worker, but\nI would like to focus in on security.\n\n21\n00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.338\nThis will help you move\nin towards your MCSA,\n\n22\n00:01:10.338 --> 00:01:12.303\nif you intend to go\ndown that trek as well.\n\n23\n00:01:12.303 --> 00:01:15.407\n&gt;&gt; Is there a certification\ninvolved in this course?\n\n24\n00:01:15.407 --> 00:01:17.710\n&gt;&gt; Yes, this is a certification course.\n\n25\n00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.731\nWe do have tech skill courses, but\nthis is one of our certification areas.\n\n26\n00:01:22.731 --> 00:01:26.887\nWhere you will, if you take the exam and\nare able to successfully pass it,\n\n27\n00:01:26.887 --> 00:01:30.778\nwill receive a certification from\nMicrosoft that labels you an MTA,\n\n28\n00:01:30.778 --> 00:01:33.770\nand says that you have\nsome security knowledge.\n\n29\n00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.171\nThat way, you are able to show an employer\nor any other person that wishes to ask,\n\n30\n00:01:38.171 --> 00:01:42.702\nto be honest with you, about your security\nknowledge, you can say, check it out,\n\n31\n00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:44.260\nI'm MTA certified.\n\n32\n00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.100\nAnd we do need to understand some of\nthe minutiae when it comes to the exam.\n\n33\n00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.640\nSo let's jump on to my\ncomputer very quickly, and\n\n34\n00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.560\nlet's take a look at Microsoft page\nthey gave us about the MTA exam.\n\n35\n00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.050\nSo here it is,\nthe exam number is the 98-367, so\n\n36\n00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.560\nif you want to look it up by that,\nthat's totally fine.\n\n37\n00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.710\nIt tells you when it was published, and\nthe languages that they offer it in.\n\n38\n00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.692\nThe audience, it's telling you, is a bit\nacademic, but hey, it's no problem for\n\n39\n00:02:09.692 --> 00:02:10.800\nus, right?\n\n40\n00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.260\nTechnologies will be Windows 10,\neven though it says Windows Server here.\n\n41\n00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.090\nI will tell you, you will need to know\na bit about both, heavily on Windows 10,\n\n42\n00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.290\nthough, and\nthe Windows desktop environment, I'll say.\n\n43\n00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.377\n&gt;&gt; And Daniel, what topics are covered\nin MTA security fundamentals?\n\n44\n00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:26.113\n&gt;&gt; That is a great question as well,\n\n45\n00:02:26.113 --> 00:02:30.210\nI do wanna point out that you'll\nnotice that this does cost you money.\n\n46\n00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.670\nIt's right here, $127 US as of\nthe filming of this little overview for\n\n47\n00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.450\nyou good folks.\n\n48\n00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.220\nSo if you're there, and\nyou can schedule with Certiport or\n\n49\n00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.680\nPearson VUE if you wanna go ahead and\ntake the exam, if you're ready for it.\n\n50\n00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.000\nBut the topics that are covered, tells\nyou right here, skills that are measured.\n\n51\n00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.590\nYou can read through that, but the\nobjectives that they give you will give\n\n52\n00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.270\nyou a really good understanding of\nwhat's gonna be on the exam itself.\n\n53\n00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.260\nAnd how much of the exam focuses\non each one of those domains.\n\n54\n00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.685\nYou have understand course security\nprinciples, understand physical security,\n\n55\n00:02:59.685 --> 00:03:01.912\nunderstand Internet security,\nwireless security.\n\n56\n00:03:01.912 --> 00:03:03.967\nAnd then it gives you some resources, and\n\n57\n00:03:03.967 --> 00:03:06.266\neach one of these domains\nwill do that as well.\n\n58\n00:03:06.266 --> 00:03:10.688\nUnderstand user authentication,\npermissions, password policies,\n\n59\n00:03:10.688 --> 00:03:12.660\naudit policies, encryption.\n\n60\n00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.421\nMalware, we're gonna cover all\nthis stuff in this series.\n\n61\n00:03:15.421 --> 00:03:18.655\nEvery one of these domains,\nwe will cover from stem to stern,\n\n62\n00:03:18.655 --> 00:03:19.976\nno stone left unturned.\n\n63\n00:03:19.976 --> 00:03:24.251\nOthers that we have is network security,\nso dedicated firewalls,\n\n64\n00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:26.952\nnetwork isolation, protocol security.\n\n65\n00:03:26.952 --> 00:03:29.832\nAnd last but not least,\nwe have security software,\n\n66\n00:03:29.832 --> 00:03:34.280\nwhich is client protection,\nemail protection, and server protection.\n\n67\n00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.220\nThose are the main bullet points that\nwe're gonna cover, and you can see,\n\n68\n00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.510\nthere are subpoints underneath that.\n\n69\n00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.224\nSo look through this list,\n\n70\n00:03:41.224 --> 00:03:44.656\nthere is the URL right here\nto help you get to this page.\n\n71\n00:03:44.656 --> 00:03:48.076\nOr you can just search it on your\nfavorite search engine and look this up,\n\n72\n00:03:48.076 --> 00:03:51.518\ngo to this page right here, check it\nout and make yourself a copy of this.\n\n73\n00:03:51.518 --> 00:03:55.897\nIt'll help you in your endeavor of making\nsure you're on track when you're studying.\n\n74\n00:03:55.897 --> 00:03:59.139\n&gt;&gt;
