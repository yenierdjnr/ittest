          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:07.220\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.068\nIn this segment, we're gonna\ntake you through an overview of\n\n3\n00:00:11.068 --> 00:00:15.742\nthe MTA Windows Server Administration\nFundamentals 98-365 exam.\n\n4\n00:00:15.742 --> 00:00:16.694\nWow, that was a mouthful.\n\n5\n00:00:16.694 --> 00:00:17.320\n>> [LAUGH] It is.\n\n6\n00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.350\n>> But, it is a really good exam for you,\n\n7\n00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.750\nespecially if you're trying to get\ninto server administration itself.\n\n8\n00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.300\nIt does help for us to have a core\nknowledge of Windows server\n\n9\n00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.820\noperating systems if that is the\nenvironment which we are going to support.\n\n10\n00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.650\nMicrosoft does a great job of\nbreaking this exam down for\n\n11\n00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.325\nus, telling us exactly what we need to\ndo to pass it, how much it's gonna cost,\n\n12\n00:00:36.325 --> 00:00:38.425\nwhere we can get signed up for it.\n\n13\n00:00:38.425 --> 00:00:41.375\nMike, you're gonna give us some of\nthe details according to this, right?\n\n14\n00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:42.295\n>> Yes, I am.\n\n15\n00:00:42.295 --> 00:00:46.895\nThe MTA exams, and there are several of\nthem, are really foundational skills.\n\n16\n00:00:46.895 --> 00:00:50.020\nThey're designed to to test\nour core knowledge and\n\n17\n00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.810\nsee if we're ready to move on\ninto a career based in idea.\n\n18\n00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:00.150\nIf we want to move into that MCSA track or\nthat MCSE track if we take these exams,\n\n19\n00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.220\nthese will let us know, hey, are we ready\nor maybe we need to do some more studying?\n\n20\n00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.216\n>> Another good reason as to look at\ntaking one of these exams is just to get\n\n21\n00:01:08.216 --> 00:01:12.713\nyour feet wet and see if maybe this is\na career you're interested in pursuing.\n\n22\n00:01:12.713 --> 00:01:17.752\nMaybe you've never done anything in IT and\nyou're thinking about it.\n\n23\n00:01:17.752 --> 00:01:19.780\nThis is a great exam to start with.\n\n24\n00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.110\nMaybe you've worked with\ncomputers outside, at home,\n\n25\n00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.160\nyou've dibble-dabbled here and there.\n\n26\n00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.350\nLet's see how much you know, how close\nare you to starting that MTSA track.\n\n27\n00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.340\nOr for an IT person maybe that got\nthe job without any certification,\n\n28\n00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.248\nback in the day before\nthe certifications were really used,\n\n29\n00:01:36.248 --> 00:01:41.400\nor just got promoted within a company and\nnow you want to get certified.\n\n30\n00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.740\nAre you ready to make that next step?\n\n31\n00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.390\nThis is a great starting point for you.\n\n32\n00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.030\nAnd the Microsoft Technology\nAssociate Program,\n\n33\n00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.620\nthey have several different exams that\nyou can take, as Daniel mentioned.\n\n34\n00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.420\nThis is the server\nadministration fundamentals.\n\n35\n00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.360\nSo let's take a look at it.\n\n36\n00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.920\nHere on my screen I've got,\nMicrosoft has a great page,\n\n37\n00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.060\nall you gotta do is go out there,\nuse your favorite search engine.\n\n38\n00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.110\nSearch for Microsoft Technology Associate\nand you can find this page, and\n\n39\n00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.770\nMicrosoft talks about the fact that it's\nan introductory Microsoft certification\n\n40\n00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.440\nfor people considering\na career in technology.\n\n41\n00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.850\nNow these exams are not going\nto qualify you for the MCP,\n\n42\n00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.120\nthe Microsoft Certified Professional.\n\n43\n00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.430\nYou need to take one of our MCSA or\nMCSE tracks to get that qualification.\n\n44\n00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.900\nBut also not a prereq for\nan MCSA or an MCSE or an MCSD.\n\n45\n00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.387\nSo don't think that you have to take\nthis if you're moving on into an MCSA or\n\n46\n00:02:38.387 --> 00:02:41.678\nMCSD, but it is, like I said,\na good starting point.\n\n47\n00:02:41.678 --> 00:02:46.440\nIf you don't have any certifications, this\nis probably where you'd like to start.\n\n48\n00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.210\nDown below, I can see I've got\nthe choice of these different tracks.\n\n49\n00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.170\nAm I thinking about going\ninto IT infrastructure?\n\n50\n00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.060\nI want to manage clients and servers, and\nwork with the network infrastructure.\n\n51\n00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.120\nAm I gonna,\nam I thinking I might be interested\n\n52\n00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.810\nin pursuing a career working with\ndatabases, with Microsoft SQL Server?\n\n53\n00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.490\nOr do I want to be a developer, do I want\nto learn to program and things like that?\n\n54\n00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.770\nSo, whichever one you want.\n\n55\n00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.980\nThis one falls under\nthe IT infrastructure and\n\n56\n00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.690\nwe can see down here, Windows Server\nadministration fundamentals.\n\n57\n00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.990\nAnd as Daniel gave us that exam number,\n98-365\n\n58\n00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.590\nis the one we're going to be going\nover in the episodes to come.\n\n59\n00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.850\nNow, this exam is going to cost\nyou about $115 US, all right?\n\n60\n00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.210\nAnd you can take that exam through\neither Certiport or Pearson VUE.\n\n61\n00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.770\nThe exam itself, we can come down here and\nwe can take a look at the objectives.\n\n62\n00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.260\nI'll just go ahead and click show all.\n\n63\n00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.330\nAnd I love these pages, cause if\nyou're getting ready for a test, and\n\n64\n00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.090\nyou wanna make sure you're\nready to walk into that booth,\n\n65\n00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.540\nthis is a great place to go,\nstart checking these things off.\n\n66\n00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.884\nIt talks about understanding\nserver installation.\n\n67\n00:03:55.884 --> 00:04:00.053\nI've gotta be familiar with the way\ndrivers work, how I can make sure they're\n\n68\n00:04:00.053 --> 00:04:04.172\nrunning, and start them and stop them,\nand change who they're running as.\n\n69\n00:04:04.172 --> 00:04:08.090\nI've got understand, I'm sorry,\nit was the services and drivers.\n\n70\n00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.000\nI've got understand my different\nserver options for installation,\n\n71\n00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.760\nlike core versus full,\ndoing unattended installs, doing images.\n\n72\n00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.710\nWhen it gets down to server roles,\n\n73\n00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:23.320\nI've gotta be familiar with all those\ndifferent roles that are out there.\n\n74\n00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.020\nApplication servers, web servers,\nremote access servers, file and\n\n75\n00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.740\nprint servers, server virtualization.\n\n76\n00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.420\nWe keep going down.\n\n77\n00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.480\nActive directory,\nwe gotta be familiar with that.\n\n78\n00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.640\nThat's a major part of\nmanaging IT infrastructure.\n\n79\n00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.350\nActive Directory is our authentication,\nis part of it.\n\n80\n00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.760\nIt does so much more.\n\n81\n00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.810\nWorking with domain accounts,\nworking with organizational units and\n\n82\n00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.840\nunderstanding the way the infrastructure\nis laid out, like your forest, and\n\n83\n00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.150\nyour parent domains,\nand your child domains.\n\n84\n00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.880\nGroup policy,\n\n85\n00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.450\nanother huge part of managing a network\ninfrastructure is gonna be on this exam.\n\n86\n00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.980\nUnderstanding different types of storage.\n\n87\n00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.420\nAll of our different SATA or\nSCSI or iSCSIs,\n\n88\n00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.820\nunderstanding RAID,\nbasic disks, dynamic disks.\n\n89\n00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.939\nThen we move on down into server\nperformance management, you know,\n\n90\n00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:22.219\nworking with the different subsystems,\nright?\n\n91\n00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:27.244\nThe main four, processor, memory, disk and\nnetwork, learning how to monitor those,\n\n92\n00:05:27.244 --> 00:05:31.465\nso that I know if a server is performing\nas it should or is not performing like\n\n93\n00:05:31.465 --> 00:05:35.490\nit should or is unable to handle\nthe workload and what I can do about it.\n\n94\n00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.565\nI've gotta be able to figure that out.\n\n95\n00:05:37.565 --> 00:05:40.950\nReading log files, one of the most\nexciting jobs you'll have in IT.\n\n96\n00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.725\n[LAUGH] Reading log files.\n\n97\n00:05:42.725 --> 00:05:43.725\nJust kidding.\n\n98\n00:05:43.725 --> 00:05:45.025\nBut it's a part of it, right?\n\n99\n00:05:45.025 --> 00:05:46.435\nI've gotta understand it.\n\n100\n00:05:46.435 --> 00:05:48.289\nI've gotta know what I'm looking for.\n\n101\n00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:53.935\nServer maintenance,\ntroubleshooting the start-up process.\n\n102\n00:05:53.935 --> 00:05:59.020\nBusiness continuity, disaster recovery,\nhot sites, cold sites.\n\n103\n00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.820\nUpdates, right?\n\n104\n00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.194\nRunning your own update server, going\nout to Microsoft and getting updates,\n\n105\n00:06:04.194 --> 00:06:07.122\ntesting updates,\ntroubleshooting methodology.\n\n106\n00:06:07.122 --> 00:06:09.096\nAnd I think that was\nthe last domain there.\n\n107\n00:06:09.096 --> 00:06:15.560\nSo you can see a very broad spectrum of\nskills that this exam is gonna go over.\n\n108\n00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.340\nWith that being said,\nit's not a very deep exam, right?\n\n109\n00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.390\nThis is a foundational knowledge,\nso yes it's broad.\n\n110\n00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.910\nIt's like we say, it's like a mile\nwide but an inch deep type thing.\n\n111\n00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.500\nYou're gonna need to know little\nbits about all of this stuff, but\n\n112\n00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.150\nthey're not gonna expect you to set up\na Federation Services Server on this exam.\n\n113\n00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.630\n>> You probably won't even need to know\nwhat that is, to be honest with you.\n\n114\n00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.340\nMike is right, it does cover\na myriad of different topics, but\n\n115\n00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.880\nit doesn't want you to go super in-depth.\n\n116\n00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.590\nIt's all about, do I understand\nthe fundamentals, hence the idea here,\n\n117\n00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.310\nright, Server Administrator Fundamentals.\n\n118\n00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.330\nUnderstand the fundamental terms and\nideas and\n\n119\n00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.530\nadministration behind\na Microsoft server environment.\n\n120\n00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.020\nThe stuff we talked about,\nright, understanding storage.\n\n121\n00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.360\nStorage is a big part of\nbeing a server administrator.\n\n122\n00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.640\nYou have to have at least some basic\nknowledge of the different storage types\n\n123\n00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.140\nso that you can help\nadministrate that system.\n\n124\n00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.570\nIf you have no idea what iSCSI is, well,\n\n125\n00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:18.070\nyou're going to have a difficult time\nhelping out when it comes to that.\n\n126\n00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:22.090\nAnd that's what this exam is\nreally designed to help you grasp,\n\n127\n00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:26.280\nreally give you that core\nfoundational knowledge so\n\n128\n00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.200\nthat when you're ready,\nyou can work as a server administrator.\n\n129\n00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:35.840\nThen you go into that MCSA and then\neventually that MCSE and start building\n\n130\n00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.900\nyour certifications through Microsoft so\nthat you can say, I have started from\n\n131\n00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:44.040\nthat foundation to their apex of their\nlittle triangle that they love to show.\n\n132\n00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.900\nIt is, it is a good little\ngraphic that they give you\n\n133\n00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.520\nto say I've worked my way\nthrough all of these.\n\n134\n00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.260\nIt starts right here with the MTA.\n\n135\n00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:51.830\n>> Exactly.\n\n136\n00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.740\nNow that's what this exam is designed for.\n\n137\n00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.300\nIf you're already in the field and\nyou want to move up the food chain.\n\n138\n00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:01.140\nYou want to get off of the,\nwhere ever you're at and move into the IT\n\n139\n00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.850\npart of your company and work your way up,\nthis is a good one to start with.\n\n140\n00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.130\nIt proves that core knowledge.\n\n141\n00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:10.760\nIf you've never been in IT, this is a\ngreat one to say, let me come in here and\n\n142\n00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.190\nstudy for this exam, and\ntake this exam, pass it,\n\n143\n00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:15.780\nit does a couple of things for you.\n\n144\n00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:20.060\nOne, hopefully,\nIs it that got you excited, right?\n\n145\n00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.900\nIn studying for this you're like,\noh this is really great stuff.\n\n146\n00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:27.340\nThis is something I can see\nmyself doing for a living, right?\n\n147\n00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.230\nTwo, it gives you your\nfirst certification.\n\n148\n00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.850\nSo now when you go apply for that job,\nyou've already got a certification.\n\n149\n00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:36.580\nYou can walk in and say look,\nI've got an MTA and\n\n150\n00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.930\nWindows server\nadministration fundamentals.\n\n151\n00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:41.600\nAnd that proves to that\nemployer that you've got that\n\n152\n00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.790\ncore foundational knowledge already.\n\n153\n00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:48.190\nAnd so if they're gonna hire you, they\nknow you've already got that information\n\n154\n00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:51.340\nand it won't take much to get\nyou to move to that next step.\n\n155\n00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:55.400\nSo it's a really good stepping stone,\nwhether you're in IT or\n\n156\n00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.330\nwhether you're just getting started.\n\n157\n00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.970\n>> Well hopefully that has piqued\nyour curiosity on the MTA exam.\n\n158\n00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.735\nAnd stay tuned, because we're gonna\nhave great episodes coming up, and\n\n159\n00:09:03.735 --> 00:09:04.991\nhopefully we'll see you there.\n\n160\n00:09:04.991 --> 00:09:11.659\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
