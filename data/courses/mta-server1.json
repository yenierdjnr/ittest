          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:07.220\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.068\nIn this segment, we're gonna\ntake you through an overview of\n\n3\n00:00:11.068 --> 00:00:15.742\nthe MTA Windows Server Administration\nFundamentals 98-365 exam.\n\n4\n00:00:15.742 --> 00:00:16.694\nWow, that was a mouthful.\n\n5\n00:00:16.694 --> 00:00:17.320\n>> [LAUGH] It is.\n\n6\n00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.350\n>> But, it is a really good exam for you,\n\n7\n00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.750\nespecially if you're trying to get\ninto server administration itself.\n\n8\n00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.300\nIt does help for us to have a core\nknowledge of Windows server\n\n9\n00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.820\noperating systems if that is the\nenvironment which we are going to support.\n\n10\n00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.650\nMicrosoft does a great job of\nbreaking this exam down for\n\n11\n00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.325\nus, telling us exactly what we need to\ndo to pass it, how much it's gonna cost,\n\n12\n00:00:36.325 --> 00:00:38.425\nwhere we can get signed up for it.\n\n13\n00:00:38.425 --> 00:00:41.375\nMike, you're gonna give us some of\nthe details according to this, right?\n\n14\n00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:42.295\n>> Yes, I am.\n\n15\n00:00:42.295 --> 00:00:46.895\nThe MTA exams, and there are several of\nthem, are really foundational skills.\n\n16\n00:00:46.895 --> 00:00:50.020\nThey're designed to to test\nour core knowledge and\n\n17\n00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.810\nsee if we're ready to move on\ninto a career based in idea.\n\n18\n00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:00.150\nIf we want to move into that MCSA track or\nthat MCSE track if we take these exams,\n\n19\n00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.220\nthese will let us know, hey, are we ready\nor maybe we need to do some more studying?\n\n20\n00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.216\n>> Another good reason as to look at\ntaking one of these exams is just to get\n\n21\n00:01:08.216 --> 00:01:12.713\nyour feet wet and see if maybe this is\na career you're interested in pursuing.\n\n22\n00:01:12.713 --> 00:01:17.752\nMaybe you've never done anything in IT and\nyou're thinking about it.\n\n23\n00:01:17.752 --> 00:01:19.780\nThis is a great exam to start with.\n\n24\n00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.110\nMaybe you've worked with\ncomputers outside, at home,\n\n25\n00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.160\nyou've dibble-dabbled here and there.\n\n26\n00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.350\nLet's see how much you know, how close\nare you to starting that MTSA track.\n\n27\n00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.340\nOr for an IT person maybe that got\nthe job without any certification,\n\n28\n00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.248\nback in the day before\nthe certifications were really used,\n\n29\n00:01:36.248 --> 00:01:41.400\nor just got promoted within a company and\nnow you want to get certified.\n\n30\n00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.740\nAre you ready to make that next step?\n\n31\n00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.390\nThis is a great starting point for you.\n\n32\n00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.030\nAnd the Microsoft Technology\nAssociate Program,\n\n33\n00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.620\nthey have several different exams that\nyou can take, as Daniel mentioned.\n\n34\n00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.420\nThis is the server\nadministration fundamentals.\n\n35\n00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.360\nSo let's take a look at it.\n\n36\n00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.920\nHere on my screen I've got,\nMicrosoft has a great page,\n\n37\n00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.060\nall you gotta do is go out there,\nuse your favorite search engine.\n\n38\n00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.110\nSearch for Microsoft Technology Associate\nand you can find this page, and\n\n39\n00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.770\nMicrosoft talks about the fact that it's\nan introductory Microsoft certification\n\n40\n00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.440\nfor people considering\na career in technology.\n\n41\n00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.850\nNow these exams are not going\nto qualify you for the MCP,\n\n42\n00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.120\nthe Microsoft Certified Professional.\n\n43\n00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.430\nYou need to take one of our MCSA or\nMCSE tracks to get that qualification.\n\n44\n00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.900\nBut also not a prereq for\nan MCSA or an MCSE or an MCSD.\n\n45\n00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.387\nSo don't think that you have to take\nthis if you're moving on into an MCSA or\n\n46\n00:02:38.387 --> 00:02:41.678\nMCSD, but it is, like I said,\na good starting point.\n\n47\n00:02:41.678 --> 00:02:46.440\nIf you don't have any certifications, this\nis probably where you'd like to start.\n\n48\n00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.210\nDown below, I can see I've got\nthe choice of these different tracks.\n\n49\n00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.170\nAm I thinking about going\ninto IT infrastructure?\n\n50\n00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.060\nI want to manage clients and servers, and\nwork with the network infrastructure.\n\n51\n00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.120\nAm I gonna,\nam I thinking I might be interested\n\n52\n00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.810\nin pursuing a career working with\ndatabases, with Microsoft SQL Server?\n\n53\n00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.490\nOr do I want to be a developer, do I want\nto learn to program and things like that?\n\n54\n00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.770\nSo, whichever one you want.\n\n55\n00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.980\nThis one falls under\nthe IT infrastructure and\n\n56\n00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.690\nwe can see down here, Windows Server\nadministration fundamentals.\n\n57\n00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.990\nAnd as Daniel gave us that exam number,\n98-365\n\n58\n00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.590\nis the one we're going to be going\nover in the episodes to come.\n\n59\n00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.850\nNow, this exam is going to cost\nyou about $115 US, all right?\n\n60\n00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.210\nAnd you can take that exam through\neither Certiport or Pearson VUE.\n\n61\n00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.770\nThe exam itself, we can come down here and\nwe can take a look at the objectives.\n\n62\n00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.260\nI'll just go ahead and click show all.\n\n63\n00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.330\nAnd I love these pages, cause if\nyou're getting ready for a test, and\n\n64\n00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.090\nyou wanna make sure you're\nready to walk into that booth,\n\n65\n00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.540\nthis is a great place to go,\nstart checking these things off.\n\n66\n00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.884\nIt talks about understanding\nserver installation.\n\n67\n00:03:55.884 --> 00:04:00.053\nI've gotta be familiar with the way\ndrivers work, how I can make sure they're\n\n68\n00:04:00.053 --> 00:04:04.172\nrunning, and start them and stop them,\nand change who they're running as.\n\n69\n00:04:04.172 --> 00:04:08.090\nI've got understand, I'm sorry,\nit was the services and drivers.\n\n70\n00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.000\nI've got understand my different\nserver options for installation,\n\n71\n00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.760\nlike core versus full,\ndoing unattended installs, doing images.\n\n72\n00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.710\nWhen it gets down to server roles,\n\n73\n00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:23.320\nI've gotta be familiar with all those\ndifferent roles that are out there.\n\n74\n00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.020\nApplication servers, web servers,\nremote access servers, file and\n\n75\n00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.740\nprint servers, server virtualization.\n\n76\n00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.420\nWe keep going down.\n\n77\n00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.480\nActive directory,\nwe gotta be familiar with that.\n\n78\n00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.640\nThat's a major part of\nmanaging IT infrastructure.\n\n79\n00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.350\nActive Directory is our authentication,\nis part of it.\n\n80\n00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.760\nIt does so much more.\n\n81\n00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.810\nWorking with domain accounts,\nworking with organizational units and\n\n82\n00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.840\nunderstanding the way the infrastructure\nis laid out, like your forest, and\n\n83\n00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.150\nyour parent domains,\nand your child domains.\n\n84\n00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.880\nGroup policy,\n\n85\n00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.450\nanother huge part of managing a network\ninfrastructure is gonna be on this exam.\n\n86\n00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.980\nUnderstanding different types of storage.\n\n87\n00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.420\nAll of our different SATA or\nSCSI or iSCSIs,\n\n88\n00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.820\nunderstanding RAID,\nbasic disks, dynamic disks.\n\n89\n00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.939\nThen we move on down into server\nperformance management, you know,\n\n90\n00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:22.219\nworking with the different subsystems,\nright?\n\n91\n00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:27.244\nThe main four, processor, memory, disk and\nnetwork, learning how to monitor those,\n\n92\n00:05:27.244 --> 00:05:31.465\nso that I know if a server is performing\nas it should or is not performing like\n\n93\n00:05:31.465 --> 00:05:35.490\nit should or is unable to handle\nthe workload and what I can do about it.\n\n94\n00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.565\nI've gotta be able to figure that out.\n\n95\n00:05:37.565 --> 00:05:40.950\nReading log files, one of the most\nexciting jobs you'll have in IT.\n\n96\n00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.725\n[LAUGH] Reading log files.\n\n97\n00:05:42.725 --> 00:05:43.725\nJust kidding.\n\n98\n00:05:43.725 --> 00:05:45.025\nBut it's a part of it, right?\n\n99\n00:05:45.025 --> 00:05:46.435\nI've gotta understand it.\n\n100\n00:05:46.435 --> 00:05:48.289\nI've gotta know what I'm looking for.\n\n101\n00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:53.935\nServer maintenance,\ntroubleshooting the start-up process.\n\n102\n00:05:53.935 --> 00:05:59.020\nBusiness continuity, disaster recovery,\nhot sites, cold sites.\n\n103\n00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.820\nUpdates, right?\n\n104\n00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.194\nRunning your own update server, going\nout to Microsoft and getting updates,\n\n105\n00:06:04.194 --> 00:06:07.122\ntesting updates,\ntroubleshooting methodology.\n\n106\n00:06:07.122 --> 00:06:09.096\nAnd I think that was\nthe last domain there.\n\n107\n00:06:09.096 --> 00:06:15.560\nSo you can see a very broad spectrum of\nskills that this exam is gonna go over.\n\n108\n00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.340\nWith that being said,\nit's not a very deep exam, right?\n\n109\n00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.390\nThis is a foundational knowledge,\nso yes it's broad.\n\n110\n00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.910\nIt's like we say, it's like a mile\nwide but an inch deep type thing.\n\n111\n00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.500\nYou're gonna need to know little\nbits about all of this stuff, but\n\n112\n00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.150\nthey're not gonna expect you to set up\na Federation Services Server on this exam.\n\n113\n00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.630\n>> You probably won't even need to know\nwhat that is, to be honest with you.\n\n114\n00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.340\nMike is right, it does cover\na myriad of different topics, but\n\n115\n00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.880\nit doesn't want you to go super in-depth.\n\n116\n00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.590\nIt's all about, do I understand\nthe fundamentals, hence the idea here,\n\n117\n00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.310\nright, Server Administrator Fundamentals.\n\n118\n00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.330\nUnderstand the fundamental terms and\nideas and\n\n119\n00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.530\nadministration behind\na Microsoft server environment.\n\n120\n00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.020\nThe stuff we talked about,\nright, understanding storage.\n\n121\n00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.360\nStorage is a big part of\nbeing a server administrator.\n\n122\n00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.640\nYou have to have at least some basic\nknowledge of the different storage types\n\n123\n00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.140\nso that you can help\nadministrate that system.\n\n124\n00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.570\nIf you have no idea what iSCSI is, well,\n\n125\n00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:18.070\nyou're going to have a difficult time\nhelping out when it comes to that.\n\n126\n00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:22.090\nAnd that's what this exam is\nreally designed to help you grasp,\n\n127\n00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:26.280\nreally give you that core\nfoundational knowledge so\n\n128\n00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.200\nthat when you're ready,\nyou can work as a server administrator.\n\n129\n00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:35.840\nThen you go into that MCSA and then\neventually that MCSE and start building\n\n130\n00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.900\nyour certifications through Microsoft so\nthat you can say, I have started from\n\n131\n00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:44.040\nthat foundation to their apex of their\nlittle triangle that they love to show.\n\n132\n00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.900\nIt is, it is a good little\ngraphic that they give you\n\n133\n00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.520\nto say I've worked my way\nthrough all of these.\n\n134\n00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.260\nIt starts right here with the MTA.\n\n135\n00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:51.830\n>> Exactly.\n\n136\n00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.740\nNow that's what this exam is designed for.\n\n137\n00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.300\nIf you're already in the field and\nyou want to move up the food chain.\n\n138\n00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:01.140\nYou want to get off of the,\nwhere ever you're at and move into the IT\n\n139\n00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.850\npart of your company and work your way up,\nthis is a good one to start with.\n\n140\n00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.130\nIt proves that core knowledge.\n\n141\n00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:10.760\nIf you've never been in IT, this is a\ngreat one to say, let me come in here and\n\n142\n00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.190\nstudy for this exam, and\ntake this exam, pass it,\n\n143\n00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:15.780\nit does a couple of things for you.\n\n144\n00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:20.060\nOne, hopefully,\nIs it that got you excited, right?\n\n145\n00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.900\nIn studying for this you're like,\noh this is really great stuff.\n\n146\n00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:27.340\nThis is something I can see\nmyself doing for a living, right?\n\n147\n00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.230\nTwo, it gives you your\nfirst certification.\n\n148\n00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.850\nSo now when you go apply for that job,\nyou've already got a certification.\n\n149\n00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:36.580\nYou can walk in and say look,\nI've got an MTA and\n\n150\n00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.930\nWindows server\nadministration fundamentals.\n\n151\n00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:41.600\nAnd that proves to that\nemployer that you've got that\n\n152\n00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.790\ncore foundational knowledge already.\n\n153\n00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:48.190\nAnd so if they're gonna hire you, they\nknow you've already got that information\n\n154\n00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:51.340\nand it won't take much to get\nyou to move to that next step.\n\n155\n00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:55.400\nSo it's a really good stepping stone,\nwhether you're in IT or\n\n156\n00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.330\nwhether you're just getting started.\n\n157\n00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.970\n>> Well hopefully that has piqued\nyour curiosity on the MTA exam.\n\n158\n00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.735\nAnd stay tuned, because we're gonna\nhave great episodes coming up, and\n\n159\n00:09:03.735 --> 00:09:04.991\nhopefully we'll see you there.\n\n160\n00:09:04.991 --> 00:09:11.659\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

everyone.\n\n4\n00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.590\nWelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.740\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n6\n00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.270\nHere with me today,\nlook at that, it's Mike Rodrick.\n\n7\n00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:20.880\n[LAUGH] How about that?\n\n8\n00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.470\nWhat's up, Mikey?\n\n9\n00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.480\nHow are you doing today?\n\n10\n00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.500\n>> I'm doing great, Daniel.\n\n11\n00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.950\nI'm excited as always because we're\ncoming at you with our MTA Content.\n\n12\n00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.830\nOur Windows Server\nadministration fundamentals.\n\n13\n00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.630\nThis is where you get to learn all about\nthe basics of server administration before\n\n14\n00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.140\nyou dive into those later certifications\nso you get your feet wet,\n\n15\n00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.830\nsee what you think or just a good starting\npoint to get that foundational knowledge,\n\n16\n00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.650\nand that's what we're doing today.\n\n17\n00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.490\n>> That's right, we're gonna put the fun\nback in fundamentals for everybody here.\n\n18\n00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.440\nAnd we'll walk over just a few of\nthe things that we need to know when it\n\n19\n00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.350\ncomes to Microsoft servers cuz you're\ngonna get into IT, this is a great\n\n20\n00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.810\nplace to start cuz server administration\nis a big part of IT administration.\n\n21\n00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.060\nYou have to know\nthe Windows Server environment.\n\n22\n00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.110\nSo we're gonna try to walk you\nthrough some of the do's and\n\n23\n00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.050\ndon'ts, and how-tos and this-and-thats so\nthat all the little terminology that we\n\n24\n00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.680\nuse as we go through the show\nthat starts making sense.\n\n25\n00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.130\nAnd as you move into the job itself you\nunderstand what is being talked about,\n\n26\n00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.740\nwhy they're doing certain things and\nthings of that nature.\n\n27\n00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.330\nSo Mike, what else?\n\n28\n00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.990\nAny specific things we want to call out?\n\n29\n00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.900\n>> Yeah, today we're gonna be looking at\ndrivers, it is gonna be the big thing.\n\n30\n00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.610\nThere's a lot to managing drivers.\n\n31\n00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.890\nWe gotta understand what they are,\nwhy we need them.\n\n32\n00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.344\nAnd how to make them work, and how to,\n\n33\n00:01:30.344 --> 00:01:33.260\nwell there's a lot of things really\nthat we need to talk about with drivers.\n\n34\n00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.390\nSo let's start just by talking\nabout what a driver is.\n\n35\n00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.600\nSo basically a driver is\na software block of code\n\n36\n00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.030\nthat allows my operating system to\ncommunicate with some hardware,\n\n37\n00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.150\nsome device that my computer wants to use.\n\n38\n00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.800\nSo that could be like you throw\nin a new network adapter.\n\n39\n00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.370\nYour operating system knows\nwhat a network adapter is.\n\n40\n00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.640\nBut that particular brand,\nthat manufacturer,\n\n41\n00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.250\nthat network adapter might have\nsome special things that it can do.\n\n42\n00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.210\nThe operating system needs to know how to\ncommunicate with that particular vendor's\n\n43\n00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.010\nnetwork adapter.\n\n44\n00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.690\nso they create a driver.\n\n45\n00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.590\nWe install that driver\nin our operating system.\n\n46\n00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.040\nAnd now the operating system can\ncommunicate with that piece of hardware,\n\n47\n00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.650\nthat network adapter for example.\n\n48\n00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.450\nSame thing for a video card or\nwhen you plug in a thumb drive.\n\n49\n00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.190\nYou'll see your system whir and\ngrind for a second.\n\n50\n00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.530\nIt installs a driver that allows\nit to communicate with that drive.\n\n51\n00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.620\nSo we have device, so\nwe have lots of drivers that\n\n52\n00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.230\nwe end up installing again to extend\nthe functionality of our machine.\n\n53\n00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.813\nWhen we add additional hardware,\n\n54\n00:02:32.813 --> 00:02:35.660\nour operating system needs to\nbe able to communicate with it.\n\n55\n00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.940\n>> I always think of\ndrivers as an interpreter.\n\n56\n00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.000\nYou've got that piece of hardware.\n\n57\n00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.885\nIt speaks a certain language.\n\n58\n00:02:42.885 --> 00:02:46.950\nWell how does your computer operating\nsystem know what to tell what to do.\n\n59\n00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.250\nIt's not made by the same company.\n\n60\n00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.480\nIt's got completely different programmers,\ncompletely different builders.\n\n61\n00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.390\nYou name it.\n\n62\n00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.670\nSo we have to have a guidance\nsystem in the middle.\n\n63\n00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.980\nAnd talks both peoples' languages.\n\n64\n00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.175\nThat's where our driver comes in.\n\n65\n00:02:58.175 --> 00:02:59.280\nHe says, you know what?\n\n66\n00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.080\nI know this guy.\n\n67\n00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.225\nI was actually made in\nthe same factory as he was.\n\n68\n00:03:02.225 --> 00:03:04.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I'm built to help you talk to him,\n\n69\n00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.300\nso drivers are a very important thing.\n\n70\n00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.760\nYou get the wrong driver and\n\n71\n00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.220\nthen you start seeing weird things happen\nto your computers, maybe results that you\n\n72\n00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.040\ndidn't necessarily don't want, so we\nwanna make sure that that doesn't happen.\n\n73\n00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.230\nWe always wanna make sure we get the\ncorrect driver for the correct product.\n\n74\n00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.910\n>> Absolutely, you know that Microsoft and\n\n75\n00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.680\nthe Windows operating system comes\nwith a pool of drivers built into it.\n\n76\n00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.780\nAnd so a lot of times you plug in a device\nand it might be able to use that device\n\n77\n00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.450\nalready, just using the stock\ndrivers that are built in.\n\n78\n00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.570\nThey got a driver cab that gets expanded\nout and goes inside our driver pool.\n\n79\n00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.490\nSo it already has a bunch of drivers and\nif you plug in a device,\n\n80\n00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.080\nit might be able to find\na driver that it can use\n\n81\n00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.380\nto communicate with that device and\nyou don't have to do anything else.\n\n82\n00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.850\nBut typically we do want to find\nthe driver that goes with that device.\n\n83\n00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.720\nWhile Windows might have a,\nlike a video card is a very common one,\n\n84\n00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.670\nvideo card, Microsoft has, Windows has\nbuilt into it several drivers that it\n\n85\n00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.540\ncan use to communicate\nwith most video cards.\n\n86\n00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.580\nFor basic video, you know,\ndisplaying the desktop, things like that.\n\n87\n00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.110\nI'm sure it'll get along just fine.\n\n88\n00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.250\nBut if that video card has special\nfunctionality, typically not so\n\n89\n00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.180\nmuch in servers.\n\n90\n00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.130\nAt least this example.\n\n91\n00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.440\nBut for gaming systems and\n\n92\n00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.430\nthings like that, you know that generic\ndriver doesn't understand all the cool\n\n93\n00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.680\ncapabilities of that new video\ncard you just went and bought.\n\n94\n00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.100\nSo while yes, you could use that generic\ndriver and get your desktop displayed on\n\n95\n00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.140\nyour computer there, without the actual\ndriver from the manufacturer,\n\n96\n00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.980\nyou might miss out on a lot of\nthat functionality of that device.\n\n97\n00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.830\nSo getting the device or getting\nthe correct driver definitely important.\n\n98\n00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.060\nWhere do you get it?\n\n99\n00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.790\nWell, typically from the manufacturer.\n\n100\n00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.900\nSome of them can be available\nthrough Windows Update.\n\n101\n00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.080\nIf the manufacturer has goes through\nthe process of getting that or\n\n102\n00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.270\ngetting their driver to Microsoft,\nhaving it checked, having it tested, and\n\n103\n00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.880\nsigned by Microsoft then it can actually\nbe made available through Windows Update.\n\n104\n00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.360\nYou can go out to the vendor's website and\nyou can obtain that driver or\n\n105\n00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.950\nit might come with a media\nwhen you buy that device.\n\n106\n00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.860\nIt might have a DVD or CD that comes\nwith it that has that driver on there.\n\n107\n00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.950\nI'll tell you Daniel,\nI always go out to the vendors website and\n\n108\n00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.790\ngrab the driver from them.\n\n109\n00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.210\nBecause if that device came with a DVD,\nfor\n\n110\n00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.420\nexample, well that driver could be\nmonths old at this point, right?\n\n111\n00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.300\nIf you think about the manufacturing\nprocess that got built in\n\n112\n00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.850\nsome other country, they stamp that CD,\n\n113\n00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.168\nthey put it in a box, they put it on\na freighter, it ships across the ocean.\n\n114\n00:05:37.168 --> 00:05:42.020\nIt gets into a warehouse here, finally\nsent out to the brick and mortar stores,\n\n115\n00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.160\nor wherever you're buying it from.\n\n116\n00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.268\nYou get it, I think it was\nmanufactured six months ago, right.\n\n117\n00:05:47.268 --> 00:05:52.059\nAnd so just because that disc comes\nwith the device doesn't mean that that\n\n118\n00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:54.450\ndriver is the latest driver.\n\n119\n00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.450\nSo always, I think,\na good idea to go out and\n\n120\n00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:57.920\nget the latest one from the vendor itself.\n\n121\n00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.195\n>> Oh yeah, yeah, definitely the way\nto fly because then you know for\n\n122\n00:06:01.195 --> 00:06:05.450\n100% sure you have the latest and greatest\npiece of software to run that hardware.\n\n123\n00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.600\nYou don't have to worry about,\nlike Mike said, is it 6 months old?\n\n124\n00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.760\nIt could have gotten here 6 months ago and\neven farther than that.\n\n125\n00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.620\nIt could have just been sitting on\nthe shelf for who knows how long.\n\n126\n00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.770\nYou know, they do have an order in\nwhich they put things on the shelf.\n\n127\n00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.010\nThere's one in the front and\nthen there's one in the back.\n\n128\n00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.500\nAnd it's going to take a while for\n\n129\n00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.050\nthat one in the back to move to be the one\nin the front could take a little bit and\n\n130\n00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.360\ntherefore that drivers\neven more out of date.\n\n131\n00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.876\nSo you have to make sure that you're\ngetting the best driver possible.\n\n132\n00:06:30.876 --> 00:06:34.485\nThis is gonna save you from things like\nif there are any security problems\n\n133\n00:06:34.485 --> 00:06:35.185\nwith the drivers.\n\n134\n00:06:35.185 --> 00:06:37.115\nSo you gotta remember,\nit's software, right?\n\n135\n00:06:37.115 --> 00:06:40.155\nIt is a piece of code that someone has\nwritten and there are people out there\n\n136\n00:06:40.155 --> 00:06:43.315\ntrying to exploit code, so\nthat's why they update the drivers.\n\n137\n00:06:43.315 --> 00:06:44.435\nThis is part of it, anyway.\n\n138\n00:06:44.435 --> 00:06:47.815\nOther's that add more\nfunctionality to the device.\n\n139\n00:06:47.815 --> 00:06:49.295\nI want all the functionality I can get.\n\n140\n00:06:49.295 --> 00:06:53.135\nPlus I wanna be as secure as I can be\nwith every piece of software that I put\n\n141\n00:06:53.135 --> 00:06:54.205\non my system.\n\n142\n00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:58.390\nTherefore, going to the device\nmanufacturer themselves.\n\n143\n00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.680\nGo to their website, download the drivers.\n\n144\n00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.640\nThey usually have a support page or\n\n145\n00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.350\na downloads page that you should\nbe able to find these things from.\n\n146\n00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:10.040\nA lot of them even have\na device drop-down menu.\n\n147\n00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.560\nYou can say this is my device point you\nright to the correct driver that you need,\n\n148\n00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.190\nthen you can download it from there and\n\n149\n00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.460\nyou're off to the races,\nyou're good to go.\n\n150\n00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.760\nIt's just basically double-clicking\nit after that, usually.\n\n151\n00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.620\n>> Absolutely.\n\n152\n00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.030\nThe other thing you've gotta think\nabout when you get a driver is it's\n\n153\n00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:25.890\nplatform specific.\n\n154\n00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:30.550\nIn other words, if you're running a 32\nbit system, versus a 64-bit system.\n\n155\n00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.870\nThese drivers are written for\na particular platform, so you can't\n\n156\n00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:39.860\ntake that 32-bit driver and install\nit on a 64-bit system or vice versa.\n\n157\n00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.170\nIt's not gonna work, so you've gotta make\nsure you're getting the right one for\n\n158\n00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.980\nthe operating system that\nyou're supporting, all right?\n\n159\n00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.110\nNow once you've obtained that driver,\n\n160\n00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.240\nthe next thing to do then would\nbe to install the driver, right?\n\n161\n00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.855\nWe'd need to install it in\nour operating system so\n\n162\n00:07:53.855 --> 00:07:57.668\nthat my operating system can begin\ncommunicating or using that device.\n\n163\n00:07:57.668 --> 00:08:01.308\nAnd installing a driver requires\nadministrative credentials.\n\n164\n00:08:01.308 --> 00:08:05.356\nSo you need to be an administrator on\nthat local machine in order to install\n\n165\n00:08:05.356 --> 00:08:09.145\nthe driver, if we're talking about\njust downloading the driver and\n\n166\n00:08:09.145 --> 00:08:11.070\ndouble-clicking on it.\n\n167\n00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:14.430\nNow as Daniel said,\nmost drivers nowadays are executables.\n\n168\n00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:17.790\nIn other words, you download\nan executable, you double-click on it.\n\n169\n00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:22.330\nIt runs the setup program, and it goes\nabout installing the driver for you.\n\n170\n00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.900\nThat's the way most of them are.\n\n171\n00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.150\nI go back to do the day when you had\nto download a little zip file or\n\n172\n00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:29.980\nsomething and extract it out.\n\n173\n00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:33.540\nIt was a folder full of INIs or\nINFs and it had to point it.\n\n174\n00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:35.600\nIt was a much more manual process.\n\n175\n00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.354\nNowadays, pretty darn simple\nto get these guys installed.\n\n176\n00:08:39.354 --> 00:08:46.050\n[COUGH]\nWe can give standard users permissions\n\n177\n00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:51.850\nto install a driver if we want, and\nI'll show you the way we would do that.\n\n178\n00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:55.607\nOn this server what I'm going to do is I'm\ngoing to open up the local group policy.\n\n179\n00:08:55.607 --> 00:08:58.207\nDPedit.msc.\n\n180\n00:08:58.207 --> 00:09:00.860\nAnd this is my local policy.\n\n181\n00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.010\nAnd there's a setting in here.\n\n182\n00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:06.136\nIf I go into my\nadministrative templates and\n\n183\n00:09:06.136 --> 00:09:10.269\nthen system and then driver installation.\n\n184\n00:09:10.269 --> 00:09:14.648\nRight here I can see allowed\nnon-administrators to install drivers for\n\n185\n00:09:14.648 --> 00:09:16.990\nthese device setup classes.\n\n186\n00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:18.600\nSo I can actually go in here and\n\n187\n00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.440\nstart giving them the ability\nto install drivers.\n\n188\n00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.990\nNow that's on a per class basis\nmeaning I'd have to find the class for\n\n189\n00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:30.335\nthat device like if it\nwas a removable media or\n\n190\n00:09:30.335 --> 00:09:35.080\nvideo card class or a sound card,\nor something like that.\n\n191\n00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.920\nAnd I figure what that class ID was,\nand I would throw that it in there.\n\n192\n00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.040\nAnd then that would give them\nthe ability to install drivers.\n\n193\n00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.720\nThat's one way we could go about doing it.\n\n194\n00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:48.560\nThe downside of doing that is they can\ninstall any drivers from that class.\n\n195\n00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:53.580\nAnd that might not be what I want\nbecause now I'm letting the user\n\n196\n00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.920\nfigure out what the best driver\nis in this scenario, right?\n\n197\n00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:01.260\nAnd we know that's\nusually not a good thing.\n\n198\n00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:06.130\n>> Yeah, the users typically aren't\nAztec savvy as maybe you and I might be.\n\n199\n00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:09.100\nSo that's usually why we\nkeep that ball in our court.\n\n200\n00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.180\nNow it is always nice to delegate\nsome work out to other people.\n\n201\n00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.970\nSo if you know somebody that's in\nthe department that has a little IT\n\n202\n00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.960\nbackground, maybe they're\ntech savvy a little bit,\n\n203\n00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.180\nyou can maybe delegate them\nthose responsibilities.\n\n204\n00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:25.210\nBut you gotta remember,\nunless it's specifically said that that is\n\n205\n00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:28.530\nan okay thing to do, I'd probably\nstay away from that, just because\n\n206\n00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:31.480\nwhat if they do make a mistake,\nwho gave them that responsibility?\n\n207\n00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.090\nWell, you did.\n\n208\n00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.290\nIf you didn't have\nauthorization to do that,\n\n209\n00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:37.110\nprobably gonna get you in\na little bit of hot water.\n\n210\n00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:39.310\nSo for administrative tasks, well,\n\n211\n00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:41.660\nwe wanna be the administrators\nthat are doing it.\n\n212\n00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:45.810\n>> Yeah, that's why it's not given to\nstandard users in the first place, right?\n\n213\n00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:47.040\nBecause we're supposed to be the admins.\n\n214\n00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.670\nWe're the ones that know what's best for\nthat system.\n\n215\n00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.930\nWe can do our research,\nfind out if that driver's appropriate,\n\n216\n00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:54.020\nwhether it's even worth installing.\n\n217\n00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.900\nJust because they come out with a new\ndriver, maybe it doesn't patch any\n\n218\n00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.980\nvulnerabilities, maybe it adds new\nfunctionality that we don't need.\n\n219\n00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:03.630\nMaybe that driver needs to be tested\nbefore we go and put it in the network,\n\n220\n00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:05.460\ncuz it might break something else, right.\n\n221\n00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.090\nIt might have a conflict somewhere.\n\n222\n00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:10.330\nSo usually not the best idea, so\nit really depends on the environment.\n\n223\n00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:14.380\nIf you've got a small shop and you want\nthose users to be able to install drivers\n\n224\n00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:18.680\nif they need to, or maybe it's your R and\nD, and they're not admins on their machine\n\n225\n00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.280\nbut you want them to be able to change\nout drivers and things like that.\n\n226\n00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.910\nThen you can do that.\n\n227\n00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:27.150\nThere's a better way, though, that\nMicrosoft gives this to allow users to\n\n228\n00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:31.080\ninstall drivers and that's through\nwhat's called the driver store.\n\n229\n00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.570\nWindows has what's called a driver\nstore and when you go install a device,\n\n230\n00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:40.560\nit will look in that driver store\nto find out if there's a driver for\n\n231\n00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.210\nthat particular device.\n\n232\n00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:45.930\nAnd if it finds it in there it can\ngo ahead and install that, and\n\n233\n00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:49.750\nwhat we can do as administrators is\nwe can preload that driver store.\n\n234\n00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:52.650\nWe can use a program called\nPNP Util which is Plug and\n\n235\n00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:58.160\nPlay Utility and we can add drivers\nto the driver store ahead of time.\n\n236\n00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.896\nAnd then if they plug in a device it\ncan look through that driver store and\n\n237\n00:12:01.896 --> 00:12:06.500\nfind that driver and grab it and go, and\nthey don't need administrative access.\n\n238\n00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:10.570\nIt's that prestaging, or that adding\nthe driver to the driver store.\n\n239\n00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:12.870\nThat's really what requires\nthe administrative access.\n\n240\n00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:16.180\nAnd when you install a driver,\nthat's what happening.\n\n241\n00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:19.440\nYou're adding it to the driver store and\nthen copying it over to the OS for\n\n242\n00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.300\nit to use.\n\n243\n00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.080\nSo if we can do that ahead of time,\n\n244\n00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.780\nwell then the users can install\nthe driver whenever they need.\n\n245\n00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:29.960\nA common scenario for this might be, let's\nsay we're pushing out new network adapters\n\n246\n00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.760\nto some of our machines, but\nnot all the machines are getting them.\n\n247\n00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:34.900\nWhat I could do is in my image,\n\n248\n00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:39.070\nI could preload that driver into that\ndriver store as part of my image.\n\n249\n00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:42.985\nThat means all machines have\nthat driver ready to go.\n\n250\n00:12:42.985 --> 00:12:46.124\nAnd so, if they ever put one of\nthose video cards in that machine,\n\n251\n00:12:46.124 --> 00:12:47.780\nit'll find that driver.\n\n252\n00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.990\nIf they don't ever put\nthat video card in there,\n\n253\n00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:52.970\nit wouldn't matter just sitting\nthere in the driver store.\n\n254\n00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:55.580\nBut the point is,\nthey wouldn't need administrative access\n\n255\n00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:56.770\nwhen they install that device.\n\n256\n00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:59.070\nThey'll just grab it from the store and\ngo.\n\n257\n00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.590\nAnd I could show you that command.\n\n258\n00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:04.139\nI don't really have a driver that\nI could throw onto my server here.\n\n259\n00:13:04.139 --> 00:13:08.280\nBut PNPUtil is the command\nthat we would use.\n\n260\n00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:12.776\nAnd the switch we're typically gonna\nuse to do the install is a -A.\n\n261\n00:13:12.776 --> 00:13:15.410\nAnd it's a pretty straightforward one,\nright?\n\n262\n00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:16.720\nYou see PNPUtil.\n\n263\n00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:19.824\nIf I can get that to highlight,\nit doesn't want to.\n\n264\n00:13:19.824 --> 00:13:20.810\nPNPUtil.\n\n265\n00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:23.202\nThen a -A to add.\n\n266\n00:13:23.202 --> 00:13:27.823\nThen the path to the location of\nthose lNF files for that driver.\n\n267\n00:13:27.823 --> 00:13:28.740\nAnd that's it.\n\n268\n00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:32.500\nAgain, you've got to be\nan administrator to run that command.\n\n269\n00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.590\nThat'll add it to the driver store.\n\n270\n00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:37.203\nAnd then if they ever plug in\na device that can use that driver,\n\n271\n00:13:37.203 --> 00:13:39.410\nit can grab it from the driver store and\ngo.\n\n272\n00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:41.440\nAnd they don't need that\nadministrative access.\n\n273\n00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.060\nSo that way we still get the chance to\ntest drivers, make sure the ones we want.\n\n274\n00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:48.300\nWe're only loading it into the driver\nstore the appropriate drivers.\n\n275\n00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:52.390\nAnd I don't have to worry about my\nusers trying to make any decisions.\n\n276\n00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:53.405\nRight?\n\n277\n00:13:53.405 --> 00:13:55.455\nNow, the other thing we\ngotta keep in mind, so so\n\n278\n00:13:55.455 --> 00:13:56.895\nfar we gotta get the right driver right?\n\n279\n00:13:56.895 --> 00:14:00.180\nIt's platform specific, 32 bit, 64 bit.\n\n280\n00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.499\nYou've gotta be an administrator\nto load that driver up.\n\n281\n00:14:03.499 --> 00:14:07.270\nWe can pre-stage it or\nwe can load it in in the driver store so\n\n282\n00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.730\nit's available for any user to install.\n\n283\n00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:12.820\nThird thing we gotta worry\nabout is the signature.\n\n284\n00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:16.750\nStarting with Windows, gosh I think it was\nWindows Vista if I remember correctly,\n\n285\n00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:19.550\nthe drivers have to be digitally signed.\n\n286\n00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:26.050\nAnd my system needs to trust\nthe certificate that signed that driver.\n\n287\n00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:27.850\nNow real quick recap or\n\n288\n00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:31.130\nif you're unfamiliar with\nwhat I mean by a signature.\n\n289\n00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:32.760\nA digital signature for\n\n290\n00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:37.370\na file is just a way to make sure\nthat that file hasn't been changed.\n\n291\n00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:41.520\nWe'll scan that file, we'll use an\nalgorithm, a hashing algorithm typically\n\n292\n00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:46.480\nto run that in this case a driver, the INF\nFile for it through this hashing algorithm\n\n293\n00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.810\nand generate a thumbprint or\na hash value that identifies that file.\n\n294\n00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:54.070\nAnd if anything ever changes\nwithin the file itself,\n\n295\n00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:56.490\nthat thumbprint will no longer match.\n\n296\n00:14:56.490 --> 00:15:00.290\nSo that gives Windows the ability\nto tell if that's been modified.\n\n297\n00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:02.000\nA real easy way for\n\n298\n00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.585\nbad guys to get malware on your system\nis to offer free drivers, right?\n\n299\n00:15:06.585 --> 00:15:07.780\nCuz you go out there and you search.\n\n300\n00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.090\nYeah, I need a driver for this.\n\n301\n00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:11.000\nAnd you go here it is,\ndownload it from me, you know?\n\n302\n00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:11.580\nAnd you don't care.\n\n303\n00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:15.280\nYou just click, you download it, and they\ncould put all kinds of stuff in there and\n\n304\n00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.030\nyou wouldn't know.\n\n305\n00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:18.160\nUntil your system starts going haywire.\n\n306\n00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.300\nSo requiring these\ndrivers to be signed and\n\n307\n00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:25.280\nby a trusted vendor,\nit helps keep us safe.\n\n308\n00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.980\nMost of these drivers are going\nto be signed by Microsoft.\n\n309\n00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:31.270\nThe vendors give their drivers\nthe Microsoft for testing.\n\n310\n00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:33.580\nThey add their digital signature to it and\n\n311\n00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:37.880\nthen we go to install it, it's going to\nverify that whoever signed it is somebody\n\n312\n00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:42.270\nthat's trusted like Microsoft or\nwhomever, all right.\n\n313\n00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:44.548\nYou can also sign your own.\n\n314\n00:15:44.548 --> 00:15:49.400\nYou know if you're, if you've got a device\nfor example that you can't get a signed\n\n315\n00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:53.906\ndriver for, cuz not everybody goes\nthrough that process, it costs money for\n\n316\n00:15:53.906 --> 00:15:56.607\nthat vendor to go out to Microsoft and\nsay hey,\n\n317\n00:15:56.607 --> 00:15:59.338\nwill you add a digital\nsignature to my driver?\n\n318\n00:15:59.338 --> 00:16:02.458\nAnd that cost money,\nit's a time consuming process as well.\n\n319\n00:16:02.458 --> 00:16:06.500\nSo maybe you don't, or maybe you're\ndeveloping your own drivers in house for\n\n320\n00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.375\nsome reason, or for some product.\n\n321\n00:16:08.375 --> 00:16:10.050\nOkay,that's all right.\n\n322\n00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.011\nYou can sign it yourself, but\n\n323\n00:16:12.011 --> 00:16:16.877\nyou do have to remember whatever\ncertificate you use to sign that device,\n\n324\n00:16:16.877 --> 00:16:21.998\nhas to be added to the trusted root\ncertificate store in all of your machines.\n\n325\n00:16:21.998 --> 00:16:26.492\nDrivers have to be signed, has to be\nsigned by somebody that's trusted.\n\n326\n00:16:26.492 --> 00:16:29.449\nYou can create your own and\nsign your own drivers, but\n\n327\n00:16:29.449 --> 00:16:34.420\nyou've got to make sure that you're using\na certificate that your machines trust.\n\n328\n00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:38.300\nAnd in the future, if that driver\never gets changed or modified,\n\n329\n00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:39.400\nit won't match that and\n\n330\n00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:43.840\nyour system will try to load it up,\npreventing us from some potential malware.\n\n331\n00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.480\n>> Yeah.\nIf you've ever seen that, warning!\n\n332\n00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.815\nWe do not know this digital signature!\n\n333\n00:16:48.815 --> 00:16:53.993\nWe don't, we can't verify\nthat this signature is good.\n\n334\n00:16:53.993 --> 00:16:57.550\nIf you've ever seen that warning then,\nthat's exactly what Mike is talking about.\n\n335\n00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:59.675\nI've downloaded some third\nparty software before,\n\n336\n00:16:59.675 --> 00:17:05.210\nwhere the operating system will just go\nhaywire, saying hey, this isn't signed.\n\n337\n00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:08.710\nThis is just some crazy software\nyou downloaded off the internet.\n\n338\n00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:12.780\nI'm like yeah, that's exactly what it is,\nand I happen to know what I'm doing so\n\n339\n00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:13.860\nit's okay.\n\n340\n00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:14.640\nYou know the vendor.\n\n341\n00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.910\nYou know that the software is good.\n\n342\n00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.760\nYou know the source from\nwhich you got it from.\n\n343\n00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:19.260\nThat's fine.\n\n344\n00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.930\nYou can still install the software,\nbut it will bark at you.\n\n345\n00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:22.860\nIt will tell you.\n\n346\n00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:26.815\nWe don't recognize the signature,\nor there is no signature.\n\n347\n00:17:26.815 --> 00:17:27.864\nSo you need to be careful.\n\n348\n00:17:27.864 --> 00:17:29.245\nDo you really wanna do this?\n\n349\n00:17:29.245 --> 00:17:31.775\nSo, that's nice that\nMicrosoft does that for us.\n\n350\n00:17:31.775 --> 00:17:33.895\nLets us know if you've downloaded this,\n\n351\n00:17:33.895 --> 00:17:36.005\nor you've gotten this from somewhere else,\nand\n\n352\n00:17:36.005 --> 00:17:40.230\nyou're not sure of where it comes from, or\nwho the source is or anything like that.\n\n353\n00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:43.450\nThen you might not want to install\nthat software at that time.\n\n354\n00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:45.410\n>> And you can disable that as well.\n\n355\n00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:47.990\nObviously it's not recommended.\n\n356\n00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:49.069\nIt's a temporary thing.\n\n357\n00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:52.691\nWhat you can do is you can use your\ngood old F8 boot options right?\n\n358\n00:17:52.691 --> 00:17:57.150\nWhen you start up that server operating\nsystem you hit F8 to get your boot menu.\n\n359\n00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:02.830\nOne of the options in there is going to\nbe disable driver signature verification.\n\n360\n00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:04.240\nSo if you've got a driver, as Daniel said,\n\n361\n00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.590\nmaybe you've got a driver that's not\nsigned, but you know the vendor.\n\n362\n00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:11.270\nOr you trust that the driver is good,\nand you wanna install it anyway.\n\n363\n00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:14.880\nWell you go through that boot menu, and\nyou choose to disable the driver signature\n\n364\n00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.720\nverification, you launch\ninto your operating system.\n\n365\n00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.400\nYou can install that driver.\n\n366\n00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:23.298\nWhen you reboot that system however,\nfuture drivers are gonna have to be\n\n367\n00:18:23.298 --> 00:18:26.910\nsigned, and it's just a temporary\nthing until the system reboots.\n\n368\n00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:31.006\nThere are some registry hacks that you can\ndo to completely prevent driver signature\n\n369\n00:18:31.006 --> 00:18:31.822\nverification.\n\n370\n00:18:31.822 --> 00:18:34.573\nThat's obviously not gonna\nbe a recommended practice,\n\n371\n00:18:34.573 --> 00:18:36.990\nnot anything Microsoft\nwould ever tell you to do.\n\n372\n00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:39.707\n>> Probably not going to be on the exam.\n\n373\n00:18:39.707 --> 00:18:42.288\nHow to do what we don't want you to do.\n\n374\n00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:43.970\n>> They're not going to\nwant you to do that.\n\n375\n00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:47.370\nIf you've got to do it for some reason,\nuse that temporary method,\n\n376\n00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:48.890\nget that driver installed.\n\n377\n00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:52.307\nBetter option of course on the exam,\nor if they ask you,\n\n378\n00:18:52.307 --> 00:18:56.161\nit's gonna be to obtain a driver\nthat does have a signature, or\n\n379\n00:18:56.161 --> 00:18:59.599\nif you trust it, go ahead and\nsign it yourself, right?\n\n380\n00:18:59.599 --> 00:19:02.460\nIf you've got this vendor says,\nI don't have a signature for it,\n\n381\n00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.983\nwell I just told you guys, we can sign it\nourselves with our own certificates, and\n\n382\n00:19:05.983 --> 00:19:07.539\nwe can add that to the trusted root.\n\n383\n00:19:07.539 --> 00:19:11.094\nThat way we don't have to worry about\ntemporarily disabling the security feature\n\n384\n00:19:11.094 --> 00:19:12.340\nand installing the driver.\n\n385\n00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:14.580\nWe'll just sign it, and\nthen we're good to go.\n\n386\n00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:15.390\nAll right?\n\n387\n00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.260\nAs far as, let's see what else\nwe need to talk to you about.\n\n388\n00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:19.870\nThese guys.\n\n389\n00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:23.120\nDisabling a device and removing a driver.\n\n390\n00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.190\nWell, I've still got PMP Util up here.\n\n391\n00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:30.200\nYou can remove a driver with the switch\nD to delete the package, right?\n\n392\n00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.620\nNow, that switch D by itself\n\n393\n00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:34.910\nwill just remove the package\nfrom the driver's store.\n\n394\n00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:36.710\nIt doesn't remove\nthe driver that's in use.\n\n395\n00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:39.430\nIt's already loaded it out\nof the driver's store and\n\n396\n00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:41.660\nonto the system if you're\nusing that device, right?\n\n397\n00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:46.180\nSo, you can add a switch f, and\na switch d, and that will force\n\n398\n00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:50.160\nthe deletion of the package and\nremove the driver from the system.\n\n399\n00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.000\nAll right?\n\n400\n00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.379\nOther options I have,\n\n401\n00:19:52.379 --> 00:19:57.256\nin fact let's go into my control panel\nhere, we're working with the devices.\n\n402\n00:19:57.256 --> 00:19:59.935\nThe first thing you do in the control\npanel is switch it off of that\n\n403\n00:19:59.935 --> 00:20:00.937\ndarned category view.\n\n404\n00:20:00.937 --> 00:20:02.910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I can find everything.\n\n405\n00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:07.008\nWe'll go to large icons here and\nthen I'm gonna choose device manager,\n\n406\n00:20:07.008 --> 00:20:09.912\ncuz this is where we work\nwith our drivers, right.\n\n407\n00:20:09.912 --> 00:20:13.900\nWe can see all the devices in our system,\nand we can work with the drivers for\n\n408\n00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:15.210\nthose devices.\n\n409\n00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:18.330\nSo I'm gonna come out here to say mice and\nother pointing devices, and\n\n410\n00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:22.440\nI'm just gonna grab my\nmouse properties here, and\n\n411\n00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.990\nI can see what driver this\nguy is currently using.\n\n412\n00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:29.483\nI can see his provider, Microsoft,\nthe date that driver was released,\n\n413\n00:20:29.483 --> 00:20:30.520\nthe version number.\n\n414\n00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.798\nSo if I'm out on that vendor's website and\nthey're saying, hey,\n\n415\n00:20:33.798 --> 00:20:35.940\nwe've got version 6.2.7 available.\n\n416\n00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:38.530\nI can say oh,\nthat's newer than the one I've got.\n\n417\n00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:40.790\nMaybe I wanna go and\nget that driver right?\n\n418\n00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:43.570\nSo I can come in here and\nfigure out what driver, or\n\n419\n00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:46.860\nwhat current version of\nthat driver I'm using.\n\n420\n00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:51.939\nIf I want to disable this device really I\ncan do that a couple of different ways.\n\n421\n00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:58.670\nFrom here I can, it's not gonna let\nme disable my mouse unfortunately,\n\n422\n00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:02.632\nbut I could probably,\nlet's see how I can show you that guy.\n\n423\n00:21:02.632 --> 00:21:05.960\nHow about if I go to one\none of my disk drives?\n\n424\n00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.230\nNot that I wanna do this,\nbut just to show you.\n\n425\n00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:09.430\n>> Audio driver?\n\n426\n00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:11.050\n>> Yeah, that's true.\n\n427\n00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:12.490\nWe don't need sound in here.\n\n428\n00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:15.860\nNow let's go check out one of those guys.\n\n429\n00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:20.840\nSound, video, and game and my high\ndefinition audio device, and I'll go\n\n430\n00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:24.760\nby driver, good idea there, Daniel, and\nthere's my good old disable button.\n\n431\n00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:29.080\nSo, if I want to disable it,\nI choose that and see what it says.\n\n432\n00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:33.090\nDisabling this device will cause\nit to stop functioning, right?\n\n433\n00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:35.490\nBecause, as Daniel explained\nto you at the beginning,\n\n434\n00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:38.850\nthat drivers that translator between\nthe operating system and the device,\n\n435\n00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:42.780\nif I disable it, it's not gonna be able\nto use that device anymore, all right.\n\n436\n00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:44.850\nIt's all loose sound at this point.\n\n437\n00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:50.130\nI can turn it back on by choosing\nenabled and it should come out.\n\n438\n00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:51.905\nOops, did I already enable it?\n\n439\n00:21:51.905 --> 00:21:52.625\nWasn't paying attention.\n\n440\n00:21:52.625 --> 00:21:53.690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I was looking at you guys while\n\n441\n00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:56.250\nI'm clicking down here,\nit enabled it before I even knew it.\n\n442\n00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:58.802\nSo there we go, it is enabled again.\n\n443\n00:21:58.802 --> 00:22:00.021\n>> And what a lovely audience we have.\n\n444\n00:22:00.021 --> 00:22:00.636\n>> I know.\n\n445\n00:22:00.636 --> 00:22:02.693\n[LAUGH] All right so, enabling or\n\n446\n00:22:02.693 --> 00:22:06.520\ndisabling it pretty straight\nforward control panel.\n\n447\n00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:11.414\nFind the device, pull up it's properties,\nand we can do it from there, or\n\n448\n00:22:11.414 --> 00:22:14.848\nyou can use that PMP Util with the dash D,\nall right.\n\n449\n00:22:14.848 --> 00:22:18.424\nNext thing they wanna talk\nabout is upgrading a driver.\n\n450\n00:22:18.424 --> 00:22:23.282\nYou can see right here on my screen there\nis a upgrade or update driver button,\n\n451\n00:22:23.282 --> 00:22:25.470\nand this allows me to do just that.\n\n452\n00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:27.860\nThey come out with a new\nversion of that driver.\n\n453\n00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:28.700\nI can come in here.\n\n454\n00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:32.040\nI can click update driver and\nI can point it to the files, but\n\n455\n00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:35.460\nagain this is really the old\nschool method of doing this.\n\n456\n00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:39.000\nThis is when you get, I'm trying to\nthink of the last thing, Daniel,\n\n457\n00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.260\nthat I used that was like this.\n\n458\n00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:44.840\nIt was an old three com card,\nthat didn't have an actual executable.\n\n459\n00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:47.480\nYou extracted out a couple of INF files,\nand so\n\n460\n00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.670\nto do the update this\nis exactly what I do.\n\n461\n00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:53.150\nI click on this, and I can browse\nmy computer for that software.\n\n462\n00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:56.500\nI would tell it where those files were,\nand I could go from there.\n\n463\n00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:01.158\nWindows again does have a list of drivers\nthat it could try to find for that device,\n\n464\n00:23:01.158 --> 00:23:02.992\nor you can go out to the vendors.\n\n465\n00:23:02.992 --> 00:23:05.231\nHonestly though,\nmost of our devices nowadays,\n\n466\n00:23:05.231 --> 00:23:08.391\nyou're just going to download\nthe new set-up.exe for that driver.\n\n467\n00:23:08.391 --> 00:23:11.165\nYou're gonna double click on it and\nit's gonna install it.\n\n468\n00:23:11.165 --> 00:23:16.170\nSo, updating it is really done\nthrough the executable nowadays.\n\n469\n00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:17.470\nKnow about this button though.\n\n470\n00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:20.949\nRight, if they ask you on the exam, they\ntell you've extracted out some INF files,\n\n471\n00:23:20.949 --> 00:23:22.377\nand you gotta update that driver.\n\n472\n00:23:22.377 --> 00:23:25.920\nYou're just gonna choose update driver,\nand point it to those files, and\n\n473\n00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.113\nyou should be good to go.\n\n474\n00:23:27.113 --> 00:23:31.690\nNow I'm gonna go back over to my mouse,\ncuz I am gonna update my driver.\n\n475\n00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:36.320\nBecause the next thing I wanna talk about,\nis driver rollback all right?\n\n476\n00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:39.430\nSo let me go through the update process\nfirst, and then I'll explain that guy.\n\n477\n00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:43.816\nSo I'm going to browse my computer for\ndriver software, and\n\n478\n00:23:43.816 --> 00:23:49.590\npick from a device and let's see I have,\nlet's show incompatible stuff here.\n\n479\n00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:52.210\nI'm gonna say, I don't know,\nwheel mouse optical.\n\n480\n00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:54.250\nWe'll do that one.\n\n481\n00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:57.864\n>> That have disc button used to be\nthe The hot tamale when it came to driver\n\n482\n00:23:57.864 --> 00:23:58.853\nupdates, right?\n\n483\n00:23:58.853 --> 00:24:01.541\nCuz you actually had a disc,\nyou popped it in, and\n\n484\n00:24:01.541 --> 00:24:03.534\ninstead of trying to browse around.\n\n485\n00:24:03.534 --> 00:24:06.856\nYou could just hit I have disc,\npoint it to the DVD drive or\n\n486\n00:24:06.856 --> 00:24:09.362\na CD drive if you were older than Mike and\nI.\n\n487\n00:24:09.362 --> 00:24:10.511\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or\n\n488\n00:24:10.511 --> 00:24:13.740\nmaybe even a floppy drive back in the day.\n\n489\n00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:17.220\nAnd it would find it immediately, and\nyou'd just click on it and hit OK.\n\n490\n00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.190\nBut nowadays,\nwe just get to search around for it.\n\n491\n00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.940\n>> Absolutely.\n\n492\n00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:21.090\nSo I found that driver.\n\n493\n00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:22.750\nI'm gonna go ahead and install it.\n\n494\n00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:25.550\nIf you ever change a driver,\nyou're gonna have to reboot the system,\n\n495\n00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:28.640\nbecause the drivers are loaded\nup when that system starts.\n\n496\n00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.750\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nrestart this guy.\n\n497\n00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:33.373\nIt'll take Server 2008\njust a minute to reboot.\n\n498\n00:24:33.373 --> 00:24:37.167\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] We'll log back in,\n\n499\n00:24:37.167 --> 00:24:39.375\nit's pretty darn quick.\n\n500\n00:24:39.375 --> 00:24:42.547\nOnce we get logged back in,\nwe'll go back into Device Manager and\n\n501\n00:24:42.547 --> 00:24:44.920\nwe'll see,\nit should now be using that new one.\n\n502\n00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:48.476\nAnd hopefully I picked one that I was\ntrying to find one that would still\n\n503\n00:24:48.476 --> 00:24:49.689\nallow my mouse to work.\n\n504\n00:24:49.689 --> 00:24:52.205\nWe'll see, I might not have\na mouse at this point, but\n\n505\n00:24:52.205 --> 00:24:54.077\nyou don't really need a mouse, right?\n\n506\n00:24:54.077 --> 00:24:55.168\n>> Who needs a mouse?\n\n507\n00:24:55.168 --> 00:24:55.969\nHighly overrated.\n\n508\n00:24:55.969 --> 00:24:56.596\n>> I know.\n\n509\n00:24:56.596 --> 00:24:58.816\n>> Highly overrated.\n>> You really don't need them.\n\n510\n00:24:58.816 --> 00:25:02.170\nI will say I used to tell my\nstudents that all the time.\n\n511\n00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:05.650\nPractice navigating around\nthe computer without a mouse,\n\n512\n00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:08.720\nbecause one day you're gonna\nhave that problem, and\n\n513\n00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.395\nyou're not gonna be able to get\naround if you don't have it.\n\n514\n00:25:11.395 --> 00:25:13.190\n[LAUGH] All right, so here we go.\n\n515\n00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:14.280\nI'm back into my system.\n\n516\n00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.710\nI'm gonna go back over\nto my control panel.\n\n517\n00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:22.320\nOpen up my Device Manager and\npull up my mouse again.\n\n518\n00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:26.530\nAnd I can see I'm now using,\nif we can go over to that General tab.\n\n519\n00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:27.420\nOr where can I see it?\n\n520\n00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:30.830\nI can see the Microsoft USB wheel mouse.\n\n521\n00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:33.790\nOptical, so I've updated that driver.\n\n522\n00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:35.935\nNow, and\nthe reason I wanted to do that first,\n\n523\n00:25:35.935 --> 00:25:38.830\nokay, one we need to know\nhow to update a driver.\n\n524\n00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:41.200\nTwo, I wanna talk about this next feature,\n\n525\n00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.470\nthe roll back driver feature\ncuz this is an important one.\n\n526\n00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:49.250\nRoll back driver gives me the ability\nto go back to a previous driver.\n\n527\n00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:50.530\nHence the name rollback driver.\n\n528\n00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:53.670\nIt pretty much explains itself there.\n\n529\n00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:56.690\nWhen you install a new driver,\nhopefully you've done your research and\n\n530\n00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:59.020\nyou've found that this is\nthe driver that you need.\n\n531\n00:25:59.020 --> 00:25:59.660\nNot always.\n\n532\n00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:01.360\nSometimes, that doesn't work.\n\n533\n00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.260\nMaybe you got the wrong one accidentally.\n\n534\n00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:07.382\nMaybe your user did this, and you're\njust trying to pick up the pieces and\n\n535\n00:26:07.382 --> 00:26:09.191\nget the machine working again.\n\n536\n00:26:09.191 --> 00:26:12.980\nIt's wonderful that Microsoft gives\nus this feature, because what happens\n\n537\n00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:16.260\nis that you update that driver,\nand the new driver doesn't work.\n\n538\n00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:20.130\nAnd now the device doesn't work, or\nworse yet your screen locks up, or\n\n539\n00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:24.280\nyour blue screen, or something like that,\nand now what do you do?\n\n540\n00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:27.500\nDo you remember the driver that was\non there before that actually worked?\n\n541\n00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.230\nDo you know what version it was?\n\n542\n00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:33.140\nI don't remember what driver we put\nthere six months ago, a year ago,\n\n543\n00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:35.803\nwhatever how am I gonna\nfind that driver again?\n\n544\n00:26:35.803 --> 00:26:39.063\nWell, I can simply choose\nroll back driver and\n\n545\n00:26:39.063 --> 00:26:42.501\nthat will go back to\nthe previously used driver.\n\n546\n00:26:42.501 --> 00:26:46.480\nNow, one notice the button wasn't\nthere before I had updated.\n\n547\n00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:51.200\nIf you've never updated the driver, then\nthere's nothing to roll back to, right?\n\n548\n00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:55.060\nSo if you've never updated it\nthat button will be grayed out.\n\n549\n00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:58.250\nTwo, it only remembers\nthe last used driver.\n\n550\n00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:00.650\nIt doesn't remember every\ndriver you've used.\n\n551\n00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:04.100\nSo if you've updated it from driver\nA to driver B, and then from B to C,\n\n552\n00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:08.810\nand then from C to D,\nI can go back from D back to C.\n\n553\n00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:10.170\nI can't go back to B or A, right?\n\n554\n00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:14.675\nIt only remembers the one previous driver,\nbut it's simple,\n\n555\n00:27:14.675 --> 00:27:17.148\nI just say yes, and I click close.\n\n556\n00:27:17.148 --> 00:27:19.144\nAnd it's gonna tell me I got to restart,\n\n557\n00:27:19.144 --> 00:27:21.862\nor it should tell me I got to\nrestart to get back to that.\n\n558\n00:27:21.862 --> 00:27:23.661\nI might have hidden that\nbutton behind there.\n\n559\n00:27:23.661 --> 00:27:25.669\nLet's see.\n\n560\n00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:26.761\nWow.\n\n561\n00:27:26.761 --> 00:27:29.187\nThis is actually not [CROSSTALK].\n\n562\n00:27:29.187 --> 00:27:32.043\nDefinitely does to get\nthat thing rolling again.\n\n563\n00:27:32.043 --> 00:27:34.946\nMake sure I rolled it back.\n\n564\n00:27:34.946 --> 00:27:37.500\nMaybe it doesn't.\n\n565\n00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:40.100\nI've still got a warning\nover here on my thing.\n\n566\n00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:46.225\nLet's refresh this guy real quick,\nand see what we've got here.\n\n567\n00:27:46.225 --> 00:27:50.318\n[SOUND] Well,\nlet's just close device manager.\n\n568\n00:27:50.318 --> 00:27:52.950\nIt doesn't give me a nice\neasy refresh option.\n\n569\n00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:57.740\nWe'll open that guy back up, and yeah,\nit's still got a little warning on there,\n\n570\n00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:59.520\nbut that's okay.\n\n571\n00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.230\nSo anyway, I'm gonna go ahead and\nrestart it, just for giggles,\n\n572\n00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:04.600\ncuz I understand,\neven though Windows doesn't.\n\n573\n00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.650\nI know to start using that new driver.\n\n574\n00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:10.216\nIt is gonna have to be restarted,\nall right, but, so\n\n575\n00:28:10.216 --> 00:28:12.980\nrollback driver is a great option.\n\n576\n00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:15.420\nEven if, what if that machine,\nwhat if it was a graphics driver and\n\n577\n00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:19.310\nthat machine had blue screen and\nyou couldn't log on because of it?\n\n578\n00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:21.240\nWell, you can go into safe mode and\n\n579\n00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:25.420\nthen open up device manager from the\ncontrol panel and rollback that driver.\n\n580\n00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:27.559\nSo always keep that option in mind.\n\n581\n00:28:27.559 --> 00:28:31.379\nIf that doesn't work, or\nif there's more than one driver, or for\n\n582\n00:28:31.379 --> 00:28:34.246\nsome reason that rollback\ndriver is not working,\n\n583\n00:28:34.246 --> 00:28:37.194\nanother option you could\ndo is the last known good.\n\n584\n00:28:37.194 --> 00:28:41.076\nAll right, when you reboot that server,\nyou can hit F8, pull up your boot menu,\n\n585\n00:28:41.076 --> 00:28:42.779\nand you can choose last known good.\n\n586\n00:28:42.779 --> 00:28:47.323\nAnd that's basically rolling your\nregistry back, which is gonna roll back\n\n587\n00:28:47.323 --> 00:28:52.020\nthe drivers that you were using the last\ntime the system successfully booted.\n\n588\n00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:53.971\nAll right.\n\n589\n00:28:53.971 --> 00:28:57.477\nSorry, let me log back in here.\n\n590\n00:28:57.477 --> 00:29:02.113\nAnd we'll open up device\nmanager one more time,\n\n591\n00:29:02.113 --> 00:29:06.648\njust to make sure I'm\nback to the right driver.\n\n592\n00:29:06.648 --> 00:29:09.110\nOkay, my system is giving me fits here.\n\n593\n00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:10.960\nDidn't like it.\n\n594\n00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.750\nAnd there we go, now my mice and\n\n595\n00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:17.090\npointing device is back to my good old\nPS2 compatible mouse with no warning.\n\n596\n00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:18.390\nSo easy to do, right?\n\n597\n00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:20.420\nWe go into device manager,\nyou find the device,\n\n598\n00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:23.206\nif you've gotta update a driver,\nthe button is there.\n\n599\n00:29:23.206 --> 00:29:26.560\nIf it's not an executable,\nif it's an executable, you just run it and\n\n600\n00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.620\nit's gonna go an update the driver for\nyou.\n\n601\n00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.900\nIf it's not an executable,\nthis is where you do it.\n\n602\n00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:34.650\nControl panel, properties,\nupdate driver button.\n\n603\n00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:38.005\nIf you've updated the driver and\nthat driver's causing you problems,\n\n604\n00:29:38.005 --> 00:29:40.322\nthen you can choose that\nroll back driver button.\n\n605\n00:29:40.322 --> 00:29:45.496\nSame place, control panel, device manager,\nor you can do your boot options,\n\n606\n00:29:45.496 --> 00:29:49.761\nF8 last known good, and\nthat will roll that driver back as well.\n\n607\n00:29:49.761 --> 00:29:52.754\nNow the last thing I wanna go\nover with this one Daniel,\n\n608\n00:29:52.754 --> 00:29:56.480\nactually there's a few more things\nwe gotta go over aren't there?\n\n609\n00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.720\n[CROSSTALK] Talking you\nguys ear off out there.\n\n610\n00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.765\nAll right.\n\n611\n00:29:59.765 --> 00:30:02.470\nNext thing I want to talk\nabout then is plug and play.\n\n612\n00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:06.077\nPlug and play, PNP,\nhas been around since '98 I think?\n\n613\n00:30:06.077 --> 00:30:08.200\n>> For awhile now, yeah.\n\n614\n00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:08.920\nIt's good stuff.\n\n615\n00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:09.750\nThat's why.\n\n616\n00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:11.345\n>> It's a wonderful thing.\n\n617\n00:30:11.345 --> 00:30:15.283\nPlug and play means when you plug that\ndevice in, it's gonna automatically detect\n\n618\n00:30:15.283 --> 00:30:18.950\nthat there's a new piece of hardware and\nit's gonna try to find that driver.\n\n619\n00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:22.230\nAnd we should be familiar with\nthe steps that it goes through.\n\n620\n00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:24.049\nThe operating system's\ngonna detect the change,\n\n621\n00:30:24.049 --> 00:30:26.010\nit's gonna see that new piece of hardware.\n\n622\n00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:29.840\nNow if it's a hot swappable, like a USB\nthumb drive, or something like that,\n\n623\n00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.713\nI didn't have to turn the system off.\n\n624\n00:30:31.713 --> 00:30:33.872\nI just plug it in, it detects it.\n\n625\n00:30:33.872 --> 00:30:37.900\nIf it's not hot-swappable,\nI power the machine down.\n\n626\n00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:39.370\nI crack open the case.\n\n627\n00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:42.930\nI throw in that new sound card, or\nthat video card, or that hard drive.\n\n628\n00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:45.060\nI reboot the system, same thing happens.\n\n629\n00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:47.210\nI log in, it detects that new hardware.\n\n630\n00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:49.380\nSo either way it's\ndetecting the new hardware.\n\n631\n00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.840\nWhether it requires a reboot or\nnot, depends on the device.\n\n632\n00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.330\nThen it's gonna query\nthe device itself for an ID.\n\n633\n00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:57.170\nIt says hey, what are you?\n\n634\n00:30:57.170 --> 00:31:01.230\nAnd that device should report back, I'm\na video card right, or I'm a sound card.\n\n635\n00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:03.230\nIt'll give it that class ID.\n\n636\n00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:05.900\nThen Windows is gonna go into\nthe driver store and look and\n\n637\n00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:08.960\nsee if it can find a driver\nthat matches that ID.\n\n638\n00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:13.080\nAnd if it does,\nit can grab that out of the driver store,\n\n639\n00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:17.570\ninstall it where the operating system can\nget to it, and then It will tell us we\n\n640\n00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:20.960\nneed to reboot our system for\nthose changes to take effect all right.\n\n641\n00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:24.015\nIf it doesn't find it\nin the driver's store,\n\n642\n00:31:24.015 --> 00:31:28.490\nPNP can actually go after Windows\nupdate and find it there.\n\n643\n00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:30.540\nIf it doesn't find it\nin any of those places.\n\n644\n00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:31.800\nIt's gonna prompt you.\n\n645\n00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.490\nIt's gonna say, hey, I don't know\nwhere the drivers for this device.\n\n646\n00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:36.310\nDo you have a disc that came with it?\n\n647\n00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:42.168\nGive you the opportunity to put that disc\nin there and upload or add that driver.\n\n648\n00:31:42.168 --> 00:31:46.271\nAnd then Windows installs the driver,\nconfigures it, or I'm sorry, PNP Util,\n\n649\n00:31:46.271 --> 00:31:50.433\nthe plug-and-play service installs that\ndriver and Windows configures it, and\n\n650\n00:31:50.433 --> 00:31:51.688\nthen you're good to go.\n\n651\n00:31:51.688 --> 00:31:54.094\n>> It's always usually a good idea too,\nand\n\n652\n00:31:54.094 --> 00:31:58.518\nif it comes with a disk Install a disk\nfirst, and then install the hardware.\n\n653\n00:31:58.518 --> 00:32:01.670\nIt'll find it immediately, and you don't\nhave to go through oh, do you have a disk?\n\n654\n00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:03.000\nI couldn't find this.\n\n655\n00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.840\nAnd kind of work it a little easier way,\nanyway.\n\n656\n00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:10.937\n>> And then the last thing on our list\nof objectives that we gotta cover for\n\n657\n00:32:10.937 --> 00:32:12.678\ndrivers is the good old IRQs.\n\n658\n00:32:12.678 --> 00:32:15.394\nAnd this is another one that,\nhonestly Daniel,\n\n659\n00:32:15.394 --> 00:32:17.592\nwhen's the last you dealt with an IRQ.\n\n660\n00:32:17.592 --> 00:32:18.986\n>> No.\nFifth and never.\n\n661\n00:32:18.986 --> 00:32:19.840\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, right.\n\n662\n00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:22.920\nAn IRQ is interrupt request.\n\n663\n00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.780\nAnd when you have devices,\n\n664\n00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:27.620\nthey need to talk to the processor,\nthey can send a signal.\n\n665\n00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:31.890\nI remember the way my old teacher years\nago taught me, it's like being on the bus.\n\n666\n00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:35.380\nYour stop is coming up and you pull that\nlittle cable, it rings that bell up there\n\n667\n00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:39.610\non the driver to get his attention and\nsay, hey, I need this bus to stop here.\n\n668\n00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:40.710\nSame thing for these devices,\n\n669\n00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:44.350\nlots of devices are talking to\nthe processor need processing time.\n\n670\n00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:46.960\nThey can send an interrupt\nrequest to the processor, and\n\n671\n00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:49.620\nit's just like sending\na signal to the bus driver.\n\n672\n00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:51.350\nHey processor, I need some time.\n\n673\n00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:54.340\nWill you perform this\nmathematical calculation for me,\n\n674\n00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:56.500\nor whatever the case may be.\n\n675\n00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:00.470\nAnd so our devices were assigned IRQs.\n\n676\n00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:04.096\nIRQ was assigned to the device, and\nthat way when that device called at\n\n677\n00:33:04.096 --> 00:33:08.480\nthe processor, it knew what device\nwas asking for its attention.\n\n678\n00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.970\nWell, they've really changed this process.\n\n679\n00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:14.180\nIt used to be a limited number\nof IRQs you could assign.\n\n680\n00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:18.602\nAnd, way back in the day, I remember\nhaving conflicts because my sound card\n\n681\n00:33:18.602 --> 00:33:21.709\nwanted to use the same IRQ\nthat my video card was for and\n\n682\n00:33:21.709 --> 00:33:23.319\nI will tell you how old I am.\n\n683\n00:33:23.319 --> 00:33:27.551\nThere were dip switches on the sound\ncard that you would flip to change what\n\n684\n00:33:27.551 --> 00:33:29.542\nIRQ is hard coated to use, right?\n\n685\n00:33:29.542 --> 00:33:32.966\nNowadays that's all done dynamically\nthrough the operating system.\n\n686\n00:33:32.966 --> 00:33:37.641\nThere is virtual IRQs so we're not limited\nto one through whatever at least if you\n\n687\n00:33:37.641 --> 00:33:39.440\nwant 15 I think originally.\n\n688\n00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:45.000\nNow we've got an unlimited number\nbecause they're basically virtualized.\n\n689\n00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.740\nI can't think of any reason why how\nyou're ever gonna run into a situation\n\n690\n00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:51.110\nwhere you need to worry about that, but\n\n691\n00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:54.480\nfor the exam we should talk about it and\nknow what it is.\n\n692\n00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:56.640\nSo let's take a look at\nmy screen here again.\n\n693\n00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.375\nAnd I'm going to look at, I don't know.\n\n694\n00:33:58.375 --> 00:34:00.320\nI'll look at my display adapter here.\n\n695\n00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.170\nAnd I'm just going to go\nover the resources tab.\n\n696\n00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:04.140\nAnd here you can see a few things.\n\n697\n00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:07.170\nOne of which, I'll see if I got my IO.\n\n698\n00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:08.340\nI got my input output.\n\n699\n00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:10.820\nThat one actually doesn't have an IRQ.\n\n700\n00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:13.450\nGo back to my mouse cuz\nI know he's got one.\n\n701\n00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.660\nAnd there's an example of an IRQ.\n\n702\n00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:20.650\nSo he's got IRQ number 12\nthat's been assigned to him.\n\n703\n00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:24.930\nAgain, I don't think there's any reason I\nwould ever need to change any of these.\n\n704\n00:34:24.930 --> 00:34:30.220\nBut if you need to know what the IRQ\naddress is or IDs for that device.\n\n705\n00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:34.210\nYou can come in here and you can see that,\ndynamically handled by Windows.\n\n706\n00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:35.600\nWe really don't mess with them anymore.\n\n707\n00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:39.277\n>> Yeah, thank you so much Windows for\n[LAUGH] handling that for us cuz, I mean,\n\n708\n00:34:39.277 --> 00:34:43.086\nIRQs and when I was learning all this\nstuff, that was the bane of my existence.\n\n709\n00:34:43.086 --> 00:34:47.690\nI hated trying to have to memorize\nexactly what IRQ went with what device.\n\n710\n00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:49.220\nIt was so confusing to me.\n\n711\n00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:53.470\nSo the fact that it's all dynamically\nassigned now, oh, the heavens have opened.\n\n712\n00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:54.595\n>> Yes.\n>> And it is a glorious day.\n\n713\n00:34:54.595 --> 00:34:56.350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So thank goodness.\n\n714\n00:34:56.350 --> 00:34:57.040\nAll right, Mike.\n\n715\n00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:00.030\nHave we got anything else we need to\ntalk about when it comes to these\n\n716\n00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:00.760\ndevice drivers?\n\n717\n00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:02.280\n>> For\ndrivers I think we've covered it all.\n\n718\n00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:05.630\nThe main thing to remember is that you've\ngot to get the driver for the device.\n\n719\n00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:08.910\nWindows has a few built-in but\ngo to the manufacturer's website.\n\n720\n00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:11.861\nGet the appropriate one, 32-bit or 64-bit.\n\n721\n00:35:11.861 --> 00:35:15.279\nMake sure you're an administrator\nto install it or\n\n722\n00:35:15.279 --> 00:35:19.260\nhave it pre-loaded into that\ndriver store using PNP Util.\n\n723\n00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:23.729\nIf you ever have a problem with a drive\nthat you've installed, you can rollback\n\n724\n00:35:23.729 --> 00:35:28.148\nto the previous by using that rollback\ndriver button there in device manager.\n\n725\n00:35:28.148 --> 00:35:29.530\nAnd I think those are the big points.\n\n726\n00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:30.120\n>> Yep.\n\n727\n00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:30.820\nAll right.\n\n728\n00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:33.090\nWell everybody out there,\nhopefully you've got all that down, and\n\n729\n00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:35.190\nyou are now device driver savvy.\n\n730\n00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:37.230\nThat being said,\nwe're gonna go ahead and call it a day.\n\n731\n00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:40.730\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n732\n00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:41.493\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n733\n00:35:41.493 --> 00:35:42.839\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n734\n00:35:42.839 --> 00:35:49.470\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

--> 00:00:16.410\nWelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.130\nI'm your host Daniel Lowry, and here\nwith me yet again is Mr. MIke Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.035\nHow's it going Mikey?\n\n7\n00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:23.530\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's going well Daniel,\n\n8\n00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.380\nI'm excited to be here.\n\n9\n00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.170\nWe're continuing our MTA, our Windows\nserver fundamentals episodes, and\n\n10\n00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.570\nin this one we're gonna be taking a look\nat services and service accounts and\n\n11\n00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.980\nwhat they mean to us and how we can\nmanage those guys on our servers.\n\n12\n00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.920\n>> That's right, we gotta have a good\nunderstanding of the services that\n\n13\n00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.520\nlie on our computer,\nwhat even are the services?\n\n14\n00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.590\nWhat do they do?\n\n15\n00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.370\nWhy are they there?\n\n16\n00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.180\nWell that's stuff we're\ngonna tackle today.\n\n17\n00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.320\nMike's got some great demonstrations for\nus.\n\n18\n00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.770\nHe's gonna explain these things so that\nwe, as administrators, know what to do\n\n19\n00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.710\nwhen it comes time to messing around\nwith the services on our servers.\n\n20\n00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.194\nI know it's a lot of server-s-s going on.\n\n21\n00:00:59.194 --> 00:01:02.990\n[LAUGH] But by the end of this show,\nhopefully you guys We'll have this down\n\n22\n00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.570\npat, you'll understand what they're for\nand how you can work with them.\n\n23\n00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.330\nSo, Mike, where do we begin?\n\n24\n00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.300\n>> I think we should define a service,\nthat's probably a good place to start.\n\n25\n00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.490\nWhen we talk about a service, a service is\nsomething that runs in the background and\n\n26\n00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.630\njust load it up automatically.\n\n27\n00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.800\nEither when the operating system starts or\nwhen a particular application starts.\n\n28\n00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.320\nAnd it provides some type of\nfunctionality to the operating system or\n\n29\n00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.000\nto that application.\n\n30\n00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.836\nOr to, if it's the operating system,\n\n31\n00:01:32.836 --> 00:01:37.630\nit's really kind of something that we are\ntrying to perform or do on that system.\n\n32\n00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.720\nFor example, the DNS resolver service,\nor the DNS client service, I should say.\n\n33\n00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.940\nWhen we type a name into our browser,\nsomething is responsible for\n\n34\n00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.360\ntaking that name, generating a query,\nsending it over to the DNS server,\n\n35\n00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.890\nreturning that IP address, so that my\nbrowser can connect to that webpage.\n\n36\n00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.870\nAnd I can buy my product from XYZ,\nor whatever the case may be.\n\n37\n00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.670\nWell that DNS client service is\nrunning in the background, and\n\n38\n00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.350\nthat's what's doing that for us.\n\n39\n00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.030\nWithout that,\nmy browser would go nowhere, right.\n\n40\n00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.330\nWe've got all kinds of\nservices running on our system\n\n41\n00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.820\nthat are performing that\ntype of functionality.\n\n42\n00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.260\nAnd again, it could be for the operating\nsystem or it could be functionality for\n\n43\n00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.510\nan application.\n\n44\n00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.916\nIf you install IIS, right,\na web server service.\n\n45\n00:02:23.916 --> 00:02:28.316\nWell, there's a service that runs in\nthe background that when people connect to\n\n46\n00:02:28.316 --> 00:02:30.980\nyour web server,\nit sends them those web pages.\n\n47\n00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.910\nIt responds to those requests\nwhen you install Exchange.\n\n48\n00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.750\nThere's several service accounts that\nget created to handle the functioning of\n\n49\n00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.840\nwhen you click send mail, or\nwhen you click go check your mailbox,\n\n50\n00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.952\nand you retrieve a list of\ne-mails that are in your mailbox.\n\n51\n00:02:44.952 --> 00:02:48.400\nThese are service accounts running in\nthe background that are performing these\n\n52\n00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.260\nservices.\n\n53\n00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.320\nAnd so they are very important to is and\nwe've got to understand how they work and\n\n54\n00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.160\nhow we can take care of them.\n\n55\n00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.750\nSo the first thing I want to do is\nsimply open up my services console.\n\n56\n00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.840\nIf I go to my administrative tools,\nI should be able to find services.\n\n57\n00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.330\nAnd I can launch my services console.\n\n58\n00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.900\nAnd here, I'll get a list,\nas it builds out here,\n\n59\n00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.150\nof all the different services running.\n\n60\n00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.570\nWell, not necessarily running.\n\n61\n00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.950\nLet me rephrase that.\n\n62\n00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.900\nAll the different services\nthat are on my system.\n\n63\n00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.100\nAnd as I scroll through this list,\nyou can see there's quite a few of them.\n\n64\n00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.165\n>> Suffering succotash Mike,\nthese services are seriously specific.\n\n65\n00:03:26.165 --> 00:03:30.630\n>> [LAUGH] They are indeed and\nwe've gotta be able to manage and\n\n66\n00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.675\ntake care of these guys.\n\n67\n00:03:31.675 --> 00:03:36.190\nSo, one of the first things I wanna\ntalk about is this status column, right.\n\n68\n00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.640\nBecause that's how I can verify if I think\none of my services is giving me a problem,\n\n69\n00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.125\nor if something isn't working, I can come\ncheck the service that that application or\n\n70\n00:03:45.125 --> 00:03:49.005\nwhatever it is I'm trying to do,\nrelies on and see what's going on.\n\n71\n00:03:49.005 --> 00:03:52.625\nI can see in the status columns,\nseveral of these are started.\n\n72\n00:03:52.625 --> 00:03:54.750\nThat means they're up and running and\n\n73\n00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.660\ndoing whatever it is\nthey're supposed to do.\n\n74\n00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.820\nThe others though have\nthese blanks in there.\n\n75\n00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.110\nAnd there's really four\nstates a service can be in.\n\n76\n00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.670\nI'll go ahead and\ngrab this DNS client here and\n\n77\n00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.130\nright here I can see service status.\n\n78\n00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.900\nNow it says started here,\non the exams, started and\n\n79\n00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.660\nrunning really means the same thing.\n\n80\n00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.010\nStarted or running means it's done\ndoing its startup process and\n\n81\n00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.400\nnow it's performing its job.\n\n82\n00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.585\nBut it could be in the starting state.\n\n83\n00:04:27.585 --> 00:04:28.480\nI-N-G, right?\n\n84\n00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.270\nThe verb.\n\n85\n00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.170\nIt could be in the process\nof getting started.\n\n86\n00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.690\nSo it's loading up.\n\n87\n00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.960\nIt could be started, meaning it's\ndone loading up and now it's running,\n\n88\n00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.000\nthat's your second status.\n\n89\n00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.880\nIt could be paused,\nthat means it was running and we for\n\n90\n00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.000\nsome reason decided to\nhalt it temporarily.\n\n91\n00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.150\nWe didn't want to turn it off, but\nwe've decided to pause the service.\n\n92\n00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.770\nMaybe we're troubleshooting or\ndoing something like that.\n\n93\n00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.930\nOr it could be stopped,\nmeaning that it is not running.\n\n94\n00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.210\nSo you've got starting,\nstarted, paused, and stopped.\n\n95\n00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.600\nThose are my four statuses I\ncan have on my services here.\n\n96\n00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.440\nNow if you wanna break it down,\nit can get a little more granular.\n\n97\n00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.610\nAt this point, though,\nI really think that's all we need.\n\n98\n00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.910\nThere's a starting, pausing,\n\n99\n00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.440\nthere's some in-between statuses that\nwe really don't have to worry about.\n\n100\n00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.760\nAll right, so we've got our startup,\nor our service status.\n\n101\n00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.080\nThe other thing we need to worry about\nwhen we're troubleshooting services\n\n102\n00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.980\nis this startup type, right?\n\n103\n00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:32.360\nThe startup type controls how or\nwhen that service starts up.\n\n104\n00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.640\nThis one is listed as automatic.\n\n105\n00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.080\nWhich means when I start this computer,\n\n106\n00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.910\nthat service is going to\nstart up automatically.\n\n107\n00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:46.560\nIf I reboot this computer, that service\nwill start up as that server reboots.\n\n108\n00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.640\nThat's what automatic means.\n\n109\n00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.130\nI don't have to worry about it.\n\n110\n00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.700\nI want to make sure it's running.\n\n111\n00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.740\nEvery time I start up this machine,\nI set the start up type to automatic, and\n\n112\n00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.140\nthat's what's gonna happen.\n\n113\n00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.850\nAll right?\n\n114\n00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:01.620\nThe other start up types that I\nhave available are gonna be manual.\n\n115\n00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.730\nManual means when the computer starts up,\nit's not gonna start.\n\n116\n00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:06.390\nAll right?\n\n117\n00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.280\nBut if I want to start it, I can come up\nhere and in fact let me go up here and\n\n118\n00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.780\nstop this guy real quick.\n\n119\n00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.295\nIf I set it to manual that means it's not\ngoing to start up automatically when I\n\n120\n00:06:17.295 --> 00:06:22.464\nstart the machine but if I wanna start it\nI can come in here into the properties and\n\n121\n00:06:22.464 --> 00:06:24.802\nI can click start or I could do a CMD.\n\n122\n00:06:24.802 --> 00:06:28.370\nI could use my net commands\nto start that service.\n\n123\n00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.530\nThere are power shell commands that\nI could use to start that service.\n\n124\n00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.770\nSo I come in here and\nstart it up with this button.\n\n125\n00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.430\nI could use my commands and application.\n\n126\n00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.460\nIf this service is set to manual,\n\n127\n00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.770\nan application could decide\nto launch this service.\n\n128\n00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.510\nAlso means that malware code people\nwrite could try to start a service.\n\n129\n00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.500\nMaybe you don't like that principle or\nservice.\n\n130\n00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.950\nDaniel, has one that has a lot of\nvulnerabilities associated with it.\n\n131\n00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:53.470\n>> Yeah.\nAnd\n\n132\n00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.970\nit can just be troublesome,\nthat's for sure.\n\n133\n00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.085\nStinking principle,\nthey're always giving me issues.\n\n134\n00:06:58.085 --> 00:06:58.680\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so\n\n135\n00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.330\nif this machine is never\ngonna be a print server,\n\n136\n00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.710\nI don't want that service\nrunning on this machine.\n\n137\n00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.450\nI can change the start up type.\n\n138\n00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.930\nIf I change it manual it won't\nstart up automatically but\n\n139\n00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:14.000\nsome piece of malware can come in and\ntry to start that service up.\n\n140\n00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.660\nSo if you truly want it to not start,\n\n141\n00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.820\nnot be able to start, you're gonna\nchange it to disabled, all right?\n\n142\n00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.300\nAnd let me go ahead and apply that and\nshow you the difference.\n\n143\n00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.740\nBoth manual and disabled,\n\n144\n00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.840\nit's not gonna start up automatically\nwhen I start the server.\n\n145\n00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.730\nThe difference is, when it's set to\ndisabled, look at my start button.\n\n146\n00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.670\nI can't even start it manually.\n\n147\n00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:38.500\nAn application or malware would\nnot be able to start this service.\n\n148\n00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.410\nIn order to start the service now, I'm\ngonna have to first change the start up\n\n149\n00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:47.170\ntype, to one of these other options and\napply those changes.\n\n150\n00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:52.110\nThen I could go ahead and\nstart up that service, all right?\n\n151\n00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.204\nSo disabled,\nit will not start automatically.\n\n152\n00:07:54.204 --> 00:07:57.026\nAnd you can't even start it manually or\nprogramatically.\n\n153\n00:07:57.026 --> 00:07:59.429\nYou're gonna have to come in and\nchange the start up type.\n\n154\n00:07:59.429 --> 00:08:01.948\nFirst, and then you can start the service.\n\n155\n00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:06.300\n>> So Mike, when would we want to use that\ndisabled feature [INAUDIBLE] and just say,\n\n156\n00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.780\nnever start this service?\n\n157\n00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.550\n>> Primarily if you know that\nservice is not gonna be needed.\n\n158\n00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.890\nThis is my domain controller and\n\n159\n00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:17.030\nI know I am never going to install\na printer on this domain controller.\n\n160\n00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:21.923\nI don't want that print spooler\nservice running on this guy.\n\n161\n00:08:21.923 --> 00:08:22.520\nAll right?\n\n162\n00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:27.690\nSo I could come in here and I would\nfirst stop it if it's already running.\n\n163\n00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:29.330\nI go ahead and stop that guy and\n\n164\n00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:34.630\nthen the next thing I would do is change\nthat to Disabled, and Apply that.\n\n165\n00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:39.600\nAnd now I don't have to worry about that\nservice accidentally getting started,\n\n166\n00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.090\nor programmatically getting started.\n\n167\n00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.350\n>> And also,\ndon't forget there are some programs,\n\n168\n00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:50.190\nMike kind of eluded to this just a minute\nago, that are inherently insecure.\n\n169\n00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:53.140\nNow, you may need to run them,\nbut you may not.\n\n170\n00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.580\nAnd if it's installed and\nit's got a service.\n\n171\n00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.378\nIt could get started if it's in manual.\n\n172\n00:08:57.378 --> 00:08:59.030\nWe probably wanna go in and\n\n173\n00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:03.780\nhit that Disable button, just to verify\nthat is not gonna get up and running\n\n174\n00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:07.730\nunless we specifically go in and take\nthe time necessary to make sure it runs.\n\n175\n00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:10.660\nFor whatever reason at that point.\n\n176\n00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:11.930\n>> Exactly.\nNow the next I wanna talk about,\n\n177\n00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:15.840\nthe last start up type here that I\ndidn't mention was this automatic, or\n\n178\n00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.350\ndelayed, start.\n\n179\n00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:20.680\nAnd what this means it will start up\nautomatically, just like automatic.\n\n180\n00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.551\nSo the system starts up,\nthis service will end up running, but\n\n181\n00:09:24.551 --> 00:09:28.290\nit's not gonna do it right\nwhen the system starts up.\n\n182\n00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.310\nIt's gonna wait a little bit and\nthen it's gonna start up.\n\n183\n00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:33.680\nHence the name delayed start.\n\n184\n00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.655\nAnd that's because, and\nlet me find a better one to show you.\n\n185\n00:09:37.655 --> 00:09:40.335\nHere, I'll find one that's\nin delayed start mode.\n\n186\n00:09:40.335 --> 00:09:42.545\nHere we go.\nI've got my .Net Framework.\n\n187\n00:09:42.545 --> 00:09:44.195\nLet's find a better one.\n\n188\n00:09:44.195 --> 00:09:44.935\nHere we go.\n\n189\n00:09:44.935 --> 00:09:47.085\nDTC.\nMy distributed transaction coordinator.\n\n190\n00:09:47.085 --> 00:09:50.430\nThis is to automatic delayed start.\n\n191\n00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.660\nNow, why would I want it to delay?\n\n192\n00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.320\nWell, because this guy has dependencies.\n\n193\n00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.050\nA service dependency means if\na service has a dependency\n\n194\n00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.760\nthat means it relies on other\nservices to perform it's job.\n\n195\n00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.340\nIt's got a job to do.\n\n196\n00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.300\nBut it needs other services\nto help it do its job.\n\n197\n00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.340\nAnd without those other services,\nit can't do its job.\n\n198\n00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:15.820\nSo it's dependant on those other\nservices being up and running.\n\n199\n00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:19.970\nWell if I try to start them all at once\nwhat can happen is this service starts up\n\n200\n00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.040\nand it's dependent on RPC.\n\n201\n00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.720\nAnd my security account manager.\n\n202\n00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.960\nWell what if it gets started before RPC?\n\n203\n00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.230\nIt freak out.\n\n204\n00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:29.440\nIt says I can't start, RPC's not there.\n\n205\n00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.270\nI can't do my job without it.\n\n206\n00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:35.060\nSo what we do is we say all right,\nwe're going to delay your start.\n\n207\n00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.940\nThat'll give these other\nservices time to get up and\n\n208\n00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.930\nrunning when I reboot the system.\n\n209\n00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:44.130\nThen, once this one tries to start,\nthe distributed transaction coordinator.\n\n210\n00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:47.400\nThose other services are already running,\nand he's happy, and\n\n211\n00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.950\nhe can start up properly.\n\n212\n00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:52.110\nAll right, so that's what that\ndelayed start is used for.\n\n213\n00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.310\nAnd then any time I need\nto slow a service down,\n\n214\n00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:59.080\nmake it wait a little bit before it starts\nup, typically when I've got dependencies.\n\n215\n00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.560\nThat I wanna make sure have\nstarted successfully first\n\n216\n00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.435\nbefore I try to start this guy.\n\n217\n00:11:04.435 --> 00:11:06.090\nRight?\nThe other side of that,\n\n218\n00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:07.960\nwith those dependencies.\n\n219\n00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.360\nIs, that yes this\n\n220\n00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.770\nservice distributor transaction\ncoordinator relies on these guys.\n\n221\n00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.850\nBut what about this\nbottom window down here?\n\n222\n00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.010\nLet it go find my remote procedure call.\n\n223\n00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.630\nAnd I look at that Dependencies tab.\n\n224\n00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:26.500\nI'll see that it relies\non a few things itself.\n\n225\n00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:31.000\nAnd it gives me a list of all the things\nthat rely on remote procedure call.\n\n226\n00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.430\nWhy is this important?\n\n227\n00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:35.070\nWell what if I'm thinking about\nstopping that remote procedure call?\n\n228\n00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.510\nI need to restart that service for\nsome reason.\n\n229\n00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:40.010\nAll these other services\nthat are depending on it.\n\n230\n00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:43.340\nWill stop as well because\nthey can't run without that.\n\n231\n00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:47.230\nAnd I might not want, be willing\nto stop all those other services.\n\n232\n00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.370\nRight?\nIf it's in the middle of a production day,\n\n233\n00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:50.905\nI can't kill all those services.\n\n234\n00:11:50.905 --> 00:11:52.890\nThat's gonna take half my server down.\n\n235\n00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:56.110\nSo you've got two things you've got\nto worry about with dependencies.\n\n236\n00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:59.240\nThings that this service\ndepends on to run.\n\n237\n00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.445\nAnd things that depend on this service.\n\n238\n00:12:01.445 --> 00:12:02.340\nRight?\n\n239\n00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.220\nSo both halves of the spectrum there.\n\n240\n00:12:05.672 --> 00:12:09.010\nAll right so we've got our dependencies,\nwe've got our delayed start.\n\n241\n00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:12.070\nWe got our startup types,\nall very important here.\n\n242\n00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:17.390\nNext thing I wanna take a look at, Daniel,\nis gonna be some recovery options and\n\n243\n00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:20.730\nlet's, heck we'll just go back\nto that principle service there.\n\n244\n00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:22.390\nIt's one that I don't care about anyway.\n\n245\n00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:23.960\n>> Yeah, blow it away.\n\n246\n00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:24.560\n>> Yeah.\n\n247\n00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.020\nOn the properties again of this service.\n\n248\n00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:29.070\nI've got my recovery tab.\n\n249\n00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:32.390\nAnd this is something I can\nuse to control what happens\n\n250\n00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:34.900\nif this service fails to start.\n\n251\n00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.340\nLet's say I got it set to automatic,\nright?\n\n252\n00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.980\nSo it should start up automatically,\nevery time that server reboots.\n\n253\n00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.260\nWhat if it doesn't?\n\n254\n00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.390\nWhat do I want to have happen?\n\n255\n00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:48.780\nWell, I've got a few options here,\nI've got first failure, second failure and\n\n256\n00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.780\nsubsequent failures.\n\n257\n00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:51.880\nPretty self explanatory, right?\n\n258\n00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.690\nFirst failure, the first time it fails,\nwhat do you want me to do?\n\n259\n00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:58.840\nThe choices are, take no action,\ndon't do anything,\n\n260\n00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.870\noh well it didn't start\nI'm okay with that.\n\n261\n00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.210\nRestart the service,\nmaybe something was hung up,\n\n262\n00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:09.910\nmaybe a dependent service had been slow at\nstarting, and so just try to restart it.\n\n263\n00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:14.370\nBy now, everything else should be good and\nmaybe it'll start successfully this time.\n\n264\n00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:15.210\nRun a program.\n\n265\n00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:17.760\nMaybe you've got some\nprogram you wanna run.\n\n266\n00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:22.160\nA script really,\nis typically what you're talking about.\n\n267\n00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.430\nIf this service fails to start,\nrun this other program.\n\n268\n00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:26.100\nRight?\n\n269\n00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.730\nOr, restart the computer.\n\n270\n00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:29.810\nSo, I can pick any one of these.\n\n271\n00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:31.540\nI'll leave it on restart the service.\n\n272\n00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.040\nSecond failure, let's say it fails again.\n\n273\n00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.270\nWhat do I wanna do?\n\n274\n00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:38.440\nMaybe I wanna restart the service\nif it fails the first time.\n\n275\n00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.220\nI wanna restart the whole computer.\n\n276\n00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.930\nIf it fails to start a second time.\n\n277\n00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:43.650\nMaybe something is wrong.\n\n278\n00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:44.910\nSubsequent failures.\n\n279\n00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:45.742\nWhat do you wanna do?\n\n280\n00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:48.730\nRight?\nRun [INAUDIBLE] restart the computer.\n\n281\n00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.750\nYou can change these to anything you want.\n\n282\n00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:52.940\nMaybe you want to restart\nthe service twice.\n\n283\n00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:56.735\nAnd then any brief subsequent failures,\nrestart the entire computer.\n\n284\n00:13:56.735 --> 00:13:58.170\nRight.\n\n285\n00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:02.180\nBelow that,\nI have my reset fail count after.\n\n286\n00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:06.380\nThis is how long it\nremembers a service failure.\n\n287\n00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.890\nSo if it failed to start this morning.\n\n288\n00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.560\nAnd then it restarted the service and\neverything was good.\n\n289\n00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:15.080\nThen it fails again tomorrow,\nis that the second failure?\n\n290\n00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.480\nAm I supposed to do this?\n\n291\n00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.670\nOr is that the first\nfailure by doing this?\n\n292\n00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:21.230\nDepends on how many days\nyou're remembering.\n\n293\n00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:22.670\nThat failure for.\n\n294\n00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:24.220\nRight?\nSo if you're remembering these for\n\n295\n00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.550\nseven days.\n\n296\n00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.350\nThat failure on the second day\nwould be failure number two and\n\n297\n00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:29.840\nI'd be doing my second failure option.\n\n298\n00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:34.240\nAnd then the restart service after\nis a way I can put a little bit of\n\n299\n00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.380\na lag in there.\n\n300\n00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:37.100\nIf it tries to start it.\n\n301\n00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.750\nMaybe I want it to simmer down for\na minute let everything calm down.\n\n302\n00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:41.458\nAnd then try to start it a minute later.\n\n303\n00:14:41.458 --> 00:14:44.290\nI don't wanna trying to start, try to\nstart, try to start, and try to start it.\n\n304\n00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:49.550\nI want to try to start it, wait a little\nbit and then try to start it again,\n\n305\n00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:53.410\nso you can adjust all of this and\nit's pretty cool that Microsoft does this.\n\n306\n00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:55.033\nIt's relatively new is that.\n\n307\n00:14:55.033 --> 00:14:59.090\nI wanna say 2008 or two,\nis when this came out, may have been 2008.\n\n308\n00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:03.390\nThe relatively new options\nhere the recovery, and\n\n309\n00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:05.717\nthey give us some pretty\ncool capabilities.\n\n310\n00:15:05.717 --> 00:15:09.020\nAll right,so we've got\nour recovery options\n\n311\n00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.985\nnext thing we're gonna talk about\nDaniel is the good old log-on.\n\n312\n00:15:11.985 --> 00:15:16.393\nAnd the log-on tab controls what\naccess this service is gonna have.\n\n313\n00:15:16.393 --> 00:15:21.340\nBecause what we're doing is we're\ntelling it what account to use.\n\n314\n00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.943\nSo, just like when I wanna use a computer.\n\n315\n00:15:23.943 --> 00:15:25.879\nI need an account to log on with.\n\n316\n00:15:25.879 --> 00:15:28.027\nSo that my access can be controlled.\n\n317\n00:15:28.027 --> 00:15:29.740\nMy access can be logged.\n\n318\n00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:30.240\nRight?\n\n319\n00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:34.500\nSo it knows who I am to keep track\nof what's going on, and deny me or\n\n320\n00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.890\nallow me access to resources.\n\n321\n00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:40.720\nIt's the same thing with the service,\na service needs an account to run under.\n\n322\n00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.210\nJust like you or I.\n\n323\n00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:47.692\nSo we have a few built in accounts we\ncan use and we can create our own.\n\n324\n00:15:47.692 --> 00:15:50.652\nThe built in accounts,\nI've got local system.\n\n325\n00:15:50.652 --> 00:15:52.393\nI've got local service.\n\n326\n00:15:52.393 --> 00:15:54.066\nand I've got network service.\n\n327\n00:15:54.066 --> 00:15:58.233\nIf I choose local system, in fact,\nlet's back out of here for a second.\n\n328\n00:15:58.233 --> 00:16:02.330\nYou can see in this column all\nthese services have a log on as.\n\n329\n00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:06.790\nSome of them are listed as local system,\nsome of them are listed as local service,\n\n330\n00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:08.610\nothers are network service.\n\n331\n00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:11.860\nLocal system is a very powerful account.\n\n332\n00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:16.760\nIf you give that service,\nif you tell it to run as local system,\n\n333\n00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.580\nyou're giving it full\ncontrol over that machine.\n\n334\n00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:23.670\nBasically it's an admin, it has\naccess to everything on that machine.\n\n335\n00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:26.530\nNow, that service might\nneed that level of access.\n\n336\n00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:29.440\nBut remember, we only want to give\nthese services the level they need and\n\n337\n00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.550\nnothing more.\n\n338\n00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:34.030\nSo if it doesn't need administrative\naccess to that local machine,\n\n339\n00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:36.340\ndon't run it under local system.\n\n340\n00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:38.400\nLocal service might be better.\n\n341\n00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.960\nIt's gonna have access to most of\nthe resources on the computer,\n\n342\n00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.090\nlike any standard user would, but\n\n343\n00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:46.710\nit's not gonna have that\nadministrative access on that machine.\n\n344\n00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:50.300\nNeither one of these are gonna\nhave network access.\n\n345\n00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:54.680\nSo, if that service needs to reach out and\ntalk to other machines on the network,\n\n346\n00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.100\nit's gonna have to run\nunder the network service.\n\n347\n00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.700\nLike if I look at DNS client,\n\n348\n00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.310\nI told you earlier when I was\ntalking about DNS client, and\n\n349\n00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:07.770\nit's gonna generate a query and send it\nover to the dns server for resolution.\n\n350\n00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:09.450\nWell, that means it needs network access.\n\n351\n00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:11.290\nIt needs to be able to talk\nto my network adapter,\n\n352\n00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:13.900\ngenerate packets,\nsend 'em out there, right?\n\n353\n00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.170\nSo, it's running under network service.\n\n354\n00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:20.330\nSo you pick the log on as\nbased on what level of access\n\n355\n00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:22.550\nthat service needs to do it's job.\n\n356\n00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:28.910\nNow, as I said earlier, it's just\na user account, I can create my own.\n\n357\n00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:30.070\nIn fact, if I want to,\n\n358\n00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:34.430\none of the things that we have to think\nabout when we're installing applications.\n\n359\n00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:37.960\nThey might tell us hey, you're gonna need\na service account for this applications.\n\n360\n00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.000\nMy job then is to look\nat that application and\n\n361\n00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.360\ndetermine what level of\naccess it's going to need.\n\n362\n00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:47.190\nI could create a local account\nin the local SAM file, right?\n\n363\n00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:49.800\nAnd I could give it\njust local user access,\n\n364\n00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.360\njust like a local user account would.\n\n365\n00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.440\nIt have access to local resources.\n\n366\n00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.440\nI can add it to access control list.\n\n367\n00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.520\nI can give it whatever access it needs but\n\n368\n00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:01.620\nit would be curtailed to\njust that local machine.\n\n369\n00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.360\nI can create a domain account.\n\n370\n00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.800\nI can go into active directory and create\na user account and call it my service.\n\n371\n00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:12.656\nAll right, and then come in here to one of\nthese services and go to that log on and\n\n372\n00:18:12.656 --> 00:18:15.242\nchange it to account that I just created.\n\n373\n00:18:15.242 --> 00:18:17.761\nNow it will be just like\na normal domain user.\n\n374\n00:18:17.761 --> 00:18:21.546\nIt will be part of the authenticated\nusers, it will have access to any\n\n375\n00:18:21.546 --> 00:18:26.770\nresource, Than a normal domain user would\nhave, including access to the network.\n\n376\n00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:31.300\nAnd so that's something we do.\n\n377\n00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:35.470\nWhen you install SQL, as a good example,\nyou have to create two or\n\n378\n00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:39.130\nthree different service accounts, and\nyou have to decide what level of access.\n\n379\n00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:42.420\nAnd for the longest time in Windows,\nthat's the way we did it.\n\n380\n00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:46.720\nWe would go into Active Directory,\nwe'd create a standard user account, and\n\n381\n00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:51.190\nthen what happens is these programs would\nask you when you're installing SQL.\n\n382\n00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:54.680\nIt says what account do you wanna use for\nthe SQL server service?\n\n383\n00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.008\nAnd you would give it the username and\npassword and\n\n384\n00:18:57.008 --> 00:19:00.905\nthen it would take care of assigning the\nappropriate permissions to that account.\n\n385\n00:19:00.905 --> 00:19:04.942\nOther programs you might have to figure\nout what that service account needs and\n\n386\n00:19:04.942 --> 00:19:06.908\nmanually assign those permissions.\n\n387\n00:19:06.908 --> 00:19:09.230\nAll right?\nAnd that's a better way to do it,\n\n388\n00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:13.140\nbecause now the account only\nhas access to what it needs,\n\n389\n00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.650\nrather than just making it an admin,\nright?\n\n390\n00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:17.020\nThink about what we do with our users.\n\n391\n00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:19.560\nWe don't make them admins on the machine,\njust so\n\n392\n00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.120\nthey can install a program because yes,\n\n393\n00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:27.020\nthey can install a program but now they\ncan do everything else on that machine.\n\n394\n00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:30.720\nI don't give a service local system access\n\n395\n00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.250\njust because I want to make\nsure nothing goes wrong.\n\n396\n00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:35.830\nHere, make it an administrator that\nway it can do whatever it wants.\n\n397\n00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:38.040\nWhat if somebody compromises that service?\n\n398\n00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.180\nThey now have access as\nan administrator of that system, right?\n\n399\n00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:44.010\nSo we would much rather\ncreate user accounts, and\n\n400\n00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:46.660\nthen assign those accounts\nto the user account,\n\n401\n00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.880\nthat resigns permissions to that user\naccount to support that service.\n\n402\n00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.503\n>> Now Mike, you're messing up\nmy ease of administration here.\n\n403\n00:19:52.503 --> 00:19:56.252\n[LAUGH] I like just being able to\nsay have all the rights you need and\n\n404\n00:19:56.252 --> 00:19:57.580\nrun as necessary.\n\n405\n00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.320\nI don't want to have to worry about it.\n\n406\n00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.870\nBut, that's not really our job.\n\n407\n00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:04.410\nOur job is to go and figure out exactly\nwhat these service accounts need,\n\n408\n00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:08.120\ngive them the access required, and\nthen set the permissions on them, right?\n\n409\n00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:08.750\n>> Exactly.\n\n410\n00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:09.970\nPrinciple of least privilege.\n\n411\n00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:12.150\nI know it's a lot more\nwork in the beginning, but\n\n412\n00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:14.260\nit's a way to keep our system secure.\n\n413\n00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:18.510\nNow the downside of using a user account\nlike that is, they are just user accounts.\n\n414\n00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:19.930\nAnd in our domain environments,\n\n415\n00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:24.330\nwe have password policies that say you've\ngotta change your password every 30 days,\n\n416\n00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:28.070\nor every 42 days by default, or\nwhatever your company has decided.\n\n417\n00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:29.370\nWell, guess what.\n\n418\n00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:32.320\nThose service accounts have\nto follow those same rules.\n\n419\n00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:35.190\nThey are gonna have to change\ntheir password as well.\n\n420\n00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:39.690\nNow, you can go into that account and\nsay, password never expires.\n\n421\n00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:41.970\nThere's a reason we don't use that option,\nright?\n\n422\n00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:43.340\nThat is a security vulnerability.\n\n423\n00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:47.530\nThat gives the bad guy forever to\ntry to break that password and\n\n424\n00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:50.530\nwhatever access that server's gonna\nhave if they break that password and\n\n425\n00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:54.610\ncan get access to that account they're\ngonna have that same level of access.\n\n426\n00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:59.590\nSo Microsoft came out with something\ncalled Managed Server Accounts and\n\n427\n00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:04.220\nManaged Server accounts, it's still\ngonna be creating a user account,\n\n428\n00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:08.020\nthat I'm gonna assign to this service for\nit to use.\n\n429\n00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:12.790\nBut instead of me managing the password,\nWindows is gonna manage the password.\n\n430\n00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:15.600\nAnd I don't have to worry about it, right?\n\n431\n00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.300\nIt's nothing new to Windows.\n\n432\n00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.760\nWindows changes my computer's password\nin the background by it's self.\n\n433\n00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.770\nSo it makes sense that we can do this for\nservice accounts as well.\n\n434\n00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:27.650\nOtherwise if I don't do that I've gotta\nkeep a list of all the different service\n\n435\n00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:30.650\naccounts I have on my network and\nwhen I change their password and\n\n436\n00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:34.240\nwhen they're gonna have to be changed\nagain and on a large environment\n\n437\n00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:38.410\nthat could be a full time job just\nchanging passwords for service accounts.\n\n438\n00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:40.658\n>> Yeah that sounds awesomely not fun.\n\n439\n00:21:40.658 --> 00:21:41.170\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n440\n00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:43.080\n>> And it's exactly what it wouldn't be.\n\n441\n00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.180\nIt would be an administrative\nnightmare and\n\n442\n00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.940\nyou do not want to have to\nget into that business.\n\n443\n00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:49.980\nOf course we can always do like\nMike said before and you know,\n\n444\n00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:53.230\nset that really long\npassword that never expires.\n\n445\n00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:55.770\nBut again, time is not on our side here.\n\n446\n00:21:55.770 --> 00:22:00.310\nEventually, regardless of the length and\nthe strength of that password, if someone\n\n447\n00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:04.280\nis determined enough, they're probably\ngonna get through that line of defense.\n\n448\n00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:07.500\nSo, we need to have some\nother form of administration.\n\n449\n00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.615\nSo we can keep the security tight.\n\n450\n00:22:09.615 --> 00:22:12.573\nAnd yet still work with these\nservice accounts as we need and\n\n451\n00:22:12.573 --> 00:22:14.949\nthat is where this comes\ninto play right Mikey?\n\n452\n00:22:14.949 --> 00:22:19.135\n>> Exactly Windows service\naccounts we create the account but\n\n453\n00:22:19.135 --> 00:22:20.905\nwe don't set the password.\n\n454\n00:22:20.905 --> 00:22:23.850\nMicroSoft Windows does,\nWindows sets the password.\n\n455\n00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:26.780\nWindows will change the password every so\noften in the background.\n\n456\n00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:29.170\nSo now, I don't have to worry\nabout setting that password,\n\n457\n00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:32.260\nit never expires and\nviolating all my security policies,\n\n458\n00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.990\nmake an exceptions in a policy for\nservice accounts and things like that.\n\n459\n00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:38.830\nSo, let me show you how to do that.\n\n460\n00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:43.050\nI'm gonna use PowerShell,\nBut I do need my,\n\n461\n00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:46.550\nI'm gonna fire up the active directory\nmodule for Windows power shell,\n\n462\n00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:50.190\ncause I need those active directory\ncommands loaded up in power shell.\n\n463\n00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:55.180\nAnd I'm gonna simply type in\nnew dash AD service account.\n\n464\n00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:57.040\nAnd if I remember this command here.\n\n465\n00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.990\nI've got my cheat sheet sam account name.\n\n466\n00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:04.480\nAnd I'm going to call\nthis one web service.\n\n467\n00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:09.610\nAnd let's see what we've got here.\n\n468\n00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:12.310\nSupply the following for\nparameters the name and I did.\n\n469\n00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:18.560\nWe'll call it web service and there we go.\n\n470\n00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:22.300\nSo now I've got my service\naccount called web service.\n\n471\n00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.460\nThe next thing I'm going to do.\n\n472\n00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:25.380\nAnd let me see.\nActually,\n\n473\n00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.290\nlet's see if we can view that guy.\n\n474\n00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:30.030\nI don't know if it'll\ntry to show up just yet.\n\n475\n00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:33.360\nIf I opened up active directory users and\ncomputers.\n\n476\n00:23:35.741 --> 00:23:38.400\nWe turn on our advanced view.\n\n477\n00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.770\nLet me make sure that's on there.\n\n478\n00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:43.497\nLet me go down into my\nmanaged servers accounts.\n\n479\n00:23:43.497 --> 00:23:47.560\nAnd there is my service account,\ngood old WebSvc, right?\n\n480\n00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.580\nSo I've created the account.\n\n481\n00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:56.600\nStep two is to Add that account to\nthe machine that you wanna use it on.\n\n482\n00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:02.480\nSo I'm gonna type in add dash\nAD computer service account.\n\n483\n00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.940\nAnd I need to know\nthe identity of the machine.\n\n484\n00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:11.593\nI'm gonna do DC01, that's the machine\nI'm on, identity is going to be DC01.\n\n485\n00:24:11.593 --> 00:24:14.054\nAnd then what account am I talking about?\n\n486\n00:24:14.054 --> 00:24:18.605\nSo -service account, and\nwhat did I call that guy?\n\n487\n00:24:18.605 --> 00:24:20.120\nWeb Svc.\n\n488\n00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:24.676\nSo that adds it, it says, all right,\n\n489\n00:24:24.676 --> 00:24:28.133\nI'm gonna add that to the accounts\nthat you can use on this machine.\n\n490\n00:24:28.133 --> 00:24:29.199\nAll right.\n\n491\n00:24:29.199 --> 00:24:30.507\nThen I need to install it.\n\n492\n00:24:30.507 --> 00:24:37.579\nInstall-ADServiceAccount and\nthen the -Identity and\n\n493\n00:24:37.579 --> 00:24:42.740\nwe're going to do web SVC and there we go.\n\n494\n00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.830\nSo three different commands I had to run.\n\n495\n00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:48.950\nI've gotta create the account,\nI've gotta add that account to the list of\n\n496\n00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:53.300\nservice accounts that are on this machine\nand I've got to install it and it hey,\n\n497\n00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.470\nI'm gonna start using that account.\n\n498\n00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:59.050\nNow that I've got that set,\nnow that I've created that,\n\n499\n00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:03.690\nI can go back over to my services console,\nand let's use that print server service,\n\n500\n00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:05.650\ncuz that's not gonna mess anything up.\n\n501\n00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:08.790\nI'm gonna go ahead and turn this guy back\non, so I'm gonna change it's start up\n\n502\n00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:12.150\ntype back to automatic I'm\ngonna start that service up.\n\n503\n00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:19.180\nTo use that manage service account,\nI'm gonna go over to the log on tab,\n\n504\n00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:22.080\nchoose this account, and for\n\n505\n00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:26.990\nthe name of this guy,\nwe're gonna do Let's see here.\n\n506\n00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:29.904\nI don't know that it will\nlet me browse for this guy.\n\n507\n00:25:29.904 --> 00:25:33.166\nLet's do a $webSVC, and for\n\n508\n00:25:33.166 --> 00:25:38.517\nthe password I don't know\nwhat the password is,\n\n509\n00:25:38.517 --> 00:25:42.186\nWindows is going to maintain it.\n\n510\n00:25:42.186 --> 00:25:43.681\nI'm just going to blank it out there and\n\n511\n00:25:43.681 --> 00:25:45.549\nsay I don't know what\nthe password Password is.\n\n512\n00:25:45.549 --> 00:25:49.813\nWe'll click apply and it doesn't like,\noh you know what I did?\n\n513\n00:25:49.813 --> 00:25:51.330\nDang, I did that wrong.\n\n514\n00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:55.274\nWeb SVC dollar sign.\n\n515\n00:25:55.274 --> 00:25:56.598\nThat should work a little better.\n\n516\n00:25:56.598 --> 00:25:58.337\n>> Mike's dyslexia kicking in today.\n\n517\n00:25:58.337 --> 00:26:00.489\n[LAUGH]\n>> Dollar sign go\n\n518\n00:26:00.489 --> 00:26:01.304\nat the beginning or the end?\n\n519\n00:26:01.304 --> 00:26:02.667\n[LAUGH] So\n\n520\n00:26:02.667 --> 00:26:09.400\nthe local account ./webserivce has been\ngranted the log on as a service right.\n\n521\n00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.800\nThe new log on name will not take effect\nuntil you stop and restart the service, so\n\n522\n00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:13.590\nI'll click okay.\n\n523\n00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.750\nAnd then I'm going to go back\nover to the general tab and\n\n524\n00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:22.480\nI'm going to stop it and then I'm going\nto go ahead and start it back up.\n\n525\n00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.960\nAnd it did not like that.\n\n526\n00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:31.500\nPrivilege that the service requires to\nfunction properly does not exist in\n\n527\n00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:32.080\nthe service account.\n\n528\n00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.790\nOkay so this goes back to saying remember.\n\n529\n00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:34.910\nI'm gonna create my own account,\n\n530\n00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:37.340\nI've gotta make sure I give it\nthe appropriate permissions.\n\n531\n00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:42.270\nSo probably not the best example here\ncuz honestly I don't know by heart\n\n532\n00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:45.700\nwhat permissions that print service needs.\n\n533\n00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:47.600\nI would need to go to that account and\n\n534\n00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:51.290\ngive it those permissions before it'll\nactually let me start that guy back up.\n\n535\n00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:53.060\nIt's not gonna do it for\nme, in other words.\n\n536\n00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.300\nBut once I had figured that out and\nassigned the appropriate rights and\n\n537\n00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:01.360\npermissions to that web service,\nI could then start this service up.\n\n538\n00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.210\nAnd now I've got an account that\nI don't have to worry about.\n\n539\n00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:07.390\nIt's going to change its\npassword automatically.\n\n540\n00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:10.720\nI'm giving it just\nthe permissions it needs.\n\n541\n00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.700\nAnd I'm not setting that\npassword to never expire, so\n\n542\n00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:17.480\nI end up with the much more\nsecure solution for my services.\n\n543\n00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.010\n>> Well, Mike,\nwe've talked a lot about services,\n\n544\n00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:22.170\na lot that we can do with our services.\n\n545\n00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:25.780\nObviously you can start them, stop them,\ndelay them, make them automatic.\n\n546\n00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.230\nMaybe, if you need to,\nmake them manual or disable the thing.\n\n547\n00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:29.700\nAnd then our service accounts,\n\n548\n00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:34.700\nthat's definitely where the metal meets\nthe meat, as they like to say, where.\n\n549\n00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.800\nWe are going to secure those\nservices especially the ones that\n\n550\n00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:38.900\nmight be insecure by nature.\n\n551\n00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:43.185\nYou can create those service accounts,\nmake sure they are locked down tight, so\n\n552\n00:27:43.185 --> 00:27:46.211\nif anybody tries to compromise\nthe computer using them,\n\n553\n00:27:46.211 --> 00:27:48.811\nyou've got a way to curtail\nthat kind of action.\n\n554\n00:27:48.811 --> 00:27:51.844\nMikey, anything else that we need to\ngo over when it comes to services?\n\n555\n00:27:51.844 --> 00:27:55.583\n>> I was gonna try to assign that account\nto one more service just to see if\n\n556\n00:27:55.583 --> 00:27:59.830\nI could get it to fire up, to prove\nto you guys it does actually work.\n\n557\n00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:01.170\nSo let me try this, guy.\n\n558\n00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:05.820\nI'm gonna use my Webs Server service,\nand I'll click okay.\n\n559\n00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:07.970\nAnd now I'm gonna restart that service.\n\n560\n00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:18.392\nAnd it needs a couple more permissions to,\nso I'll have to, again same thing.\n\n561\n00:28:18.392 --> 00:28:20.985\nI have to go and figure out what\npermissions that account needs and\n\n562\n00:28:20.985 --> 00:28:21.794\nassign those to it.\n\n563\n00:28:21.794 --> 00:28:25.634\nSo keep that in mind by creating those\nmanual servers account that doesn't mean\n\n564\n00:28:25.634 --> 00:28:29.040\nit automatically picks up all\nthe rights it needs to run.\n\n565\n00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.760\nIt's just saying hey,\nhere's an account that\n\n566\n00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.060\nWindows will maintain the password for,\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n567\n00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:38.060\nYou still have to figure out what\npermissions that account needs and\n\n568\n00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.540\nassign them appropriately.\n\n569\n00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:40.210\nAnd that Daniel,\n\n570\n00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:44.170\nI think, covers just about everything\nwe need to know about services for now.\n\n571\n00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:46.690\n>> Well, it was definitely\na little bit for us to chew on.\n\n572\n00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:48.780\nGot to do our homework when\nit comes to these services,\n\n573\n00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:51.250\nmake sure that we're ready when\nwe go sit down to the exam.\n\n574\n00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:55.250\nWe have a very good grasp on how\nthey work and what we want to do.\n\n575\n00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:56.230\nI see Mike's face.\n\n576\n00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:59.390\nI think he just had a little\nmoment of something.\n\n577\n00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:01.541\n>> One more thing I wanted\nto mention to you guys.\n\n578\n00:29:01.541 --> 00:29:04.548\nThese manage service\naccounts came out in 2008.\n\n579\n00:29:04.548 --> 00:29:08.729\nThose accounts I can only use on and\nindividual machine, in other words,\n\n580\n00:29:08.729 --> 00:29:12.639\nif I had three web servers,\nI could create a manage server account and\n\n581\n00:29:12.639 --> 00:29:17.247\nuse it on web server one, I would have to\ncreate a second manage service account.\n\n582\n00:29:17.247 --> 00:29:22.518\nUse it on web server two, a third one\nto use it on web server three alright?\n\n583\n00:29:22.518 --> 00:29:27.153\nSo you can only use a Managed Service\naccount can only be used on a single\n\n584\n00:29:27.153 --> 00:29:27.789\nserver.\n\n585\n00:29:27.789 --> 00:29:32.290\nIn 2012, they came out with\ngroup managed service accounts.\n\n586\n00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:34.802\nAnd now I can take a single\nservice account and\n\n587\n00:29:34.802 --> 00:29:36.731\nuse it across multiple machines.\n\n588\n00:29:36.731 --> 00:29:40.201\nSo a lot more efficient in that respect,\nbut for the exam note,\n\n589\n00:29:40.201 --> 00:29:42.176\nthat didn't come until 2012.\n\n590\n00:29:42.176 --> 00:29:45.530\n>> An important safety tip out there\nwhen playing with the services.\n\n591\n00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:48.950\nAll right, Mikey, it looks like we've come\nto the end of yet another great episode.\n\n592\n00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:50.150\nHopefully you guys have enjoyed it.\n\n593\n00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:51.510\nWe thank you for watching.\n\n594\n00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:54.470\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n595\n00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:55.176\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n596\n00:29:55.176 --> 00:29:56.976\n>> We'll see you next

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.920\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.660\nHere with me yet again today is Mr.\nMike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.550\nHow's it going today, Mike?\n\n6\n00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.250\n>> Oh, it's going fantastic, Daniel.\n\n7\n00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.060\nI'm excited, we're continuing our MTA,\nour server fundamental track.\n\n8\n00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.640\nAnd in this one we're gonna be talking\nabout server installation options, because\n\n9\n00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.720\nif we're going to be installing server,\nwe've got some choices we need to make.\n\n10\n00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.930\nWe've got different versions of\nserver that we can choose from, and\n\n11\n00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.590\nwe've got to know which one\nis appropriate for our needs.\n\n12\n00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.640\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n13\n00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.520\nChoosing the correct installation for your\nserver methodologies or whatever it is\n\n14\n00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.770\nyou're trying to do with Microsoft Server\nis a very important part of our job.\n\n15\n00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.550\nSome servers are better suited for\n\n16\n00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.890\nthis type of job, while other servers\nwould be better suited for others.\n\n17\n00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.480\nWe have to know the difference between all\nthe different ones that we have available\n\n18\n00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.110\nto us so we can choose that\ncorrect server for the job.\n\n19\n00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.440\nThat being said, Mike, installing\nservers is definitely one of the more\n\n20\n00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.340\nbasic things that we need to know.\n\n21\n00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.430\nBut it is something we do a lot of, right?\n\n22\n00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.490\n>> It really is.\n\n23\n00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.280\nAnd when it comes down to it,\nthere's our main three editions\n\n24\n00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.350\nthat we're gonna deal with out there\nin the production environment.\n\n25\n00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.207\nWe've got our standard,\nour enterprise and our data center.\n\n26\n00:01:26.207 --> 00:01:28.982\nWhen it comes to Server 2008, 2008 R2.\n\n27\n00:01:28.982 --> 00:01:32.810\nBut there are some other ones\nthat you'll see occasionally.\n\n28\n00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.600\nUsually specialized circumstances.\n\n29\n00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.316\nAnd for the exam, we really need just to\nbe familiar with some basics about why I\n\n30\n00:01:39.316 --> 00:01:42.832\nmight choose one of those\nother editions of 2008 R2.\n\n31\n00:01:42.832 --> 00:01:45.100\nSo, let's take a look at my screen here.\n\n32\n00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.200\nI've got a chart that\nI've got from Microsoft.\n\n33\n00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.550\nAnd it's just their addition\ncomparison by server role and\n\n34\n00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.760\nwhen it comes down to making a decision\na lot of times it is based on what roles I\n\n35\n00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.260\nplan on running on that server as well\nas some licensing considerations and\n\n36\n00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.690\nwhat I plan on doing with\nthat machine in the end.\n\n37\n00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.270\nSo, let's take a look here.\n\n38\n00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.500\nWhen we talk about, as I said earlier,\n\n39\n00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.830\nthat the main three that we're gonna\ndeal with in a production environment,\n\n40\n00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.460\nare gonna be Enterprise,\nDatacenter, and Standard.\n\n41\n00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.250\nAnd the differences here,\n\n42\n00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.920\nnow this, the differences are gonna\nbe what roles we can install.\n\n43\n00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.200\nLike you can see Active Directory\ncertificate services.\n\n44\n00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.480\nIt has partial support on standard,\nnot full support.\n\n45\n00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.190\nSo if you want to run\na certificate authority,\n\n46\n00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.080\nyou need to run either Enterprise or\ndata center.\n\n47\n00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.080\nYou can see Federation Services\ndoesn't run at all on standard.\n\n48\n00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.630\nIn other words when you go to add a roll,\nif you're running 2008 R two standard.\n\n49\n00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.030\nAnd you launch your wizard,\nadd rolls and features.\n\n50\n00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.790\nAnd you go to look through that list,\n\n51\n00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.440\nyou will not see federation\nservices in the list.\n\n52\n00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.570\nIf it's enterprise, you would see that.\n\n53\n00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.390\nSo, that's one of your big\ndecision points there.\n\n54\n00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.810\nWhat roles you plan on running.\n\n55\n00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.050\nYou see, standard is missing.\n\n56\n00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.410\nFederation has limited support for\nsome of the files services.\n\n57\n00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.630\nSome of the other roles that\nare behind file services like DFS\n\n58\n00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.218\nmight not be available on standard.\n\n59\n00:03:10.218 --> 00:03:13.750\nNetwork policy and access service,\nremote desktop service, and\n\n60\n00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.690\nthey've got some limitations as well.\n\n61\n00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.110\nHere you can see limited to\none stand alone DFS root.\n\n62\n00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.970\nThat's what this little two is for.\n\n63\n00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.000\nAnd so in an enterprise I'm probably\ngonna want fault tolerance.\n\n64\n00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.020\nI'm gonna want more than one DFS route.\n\n65\n00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.890\nAnd it's okay if you don't know\nwhat DFS is at this point.\n\n66\n00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.770\nJust think of it, it's a way to replicate\nfiles from one server to another.\n\n67\n00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.990\nAnd if I have more than one site I'm\nprobably gonna put a DFS server at each\n\n68\n00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.550\nlocation and replicate that around.\n\n69\n00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.610\nAnd standard won't do that for me.\n\n70\n00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:42.290\nSo again, not so\n\n71\n00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.650\nimportant that you understand what I'm\ntalking about with DFS at this point.\n\n72\n00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.450\nJust understand that when I'm choosing\nmy edition, this is what I'm looking at.\n\n73\n00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.680\nI'm thinking about,\nwhat do I plan on doing with this server?\n\n74\n00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.430\nIs it supported on that\nparticular edition?\n\n75\n00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.800\nIf not, I gotta get a different edition.\n\n76\n00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.700\nSo those are the main three.\n\n77\n00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.619\nAll right, then you've got itanium for\nyour itanium based processors.\n\n78\n00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:07.048\nAnd Daniel honestly I think this is\nthe last edition that supported itanium,\n\n79\n00:04:07.048 --> 00:04:09.539\ndon't quote me on that I'll have to go and\nlook that up.\n\n80\n00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:13.964\nBut for the exam just know that 2008 R2\ndoes come in an itanium version so if\n\n81\n00:04:13.964 --> 00:04:19.420\nyou're running itanium processors on that\nserver, this would be the version for you.\n\n82\n00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.850\nThere's also a web version,\nand if you notice,\n\n83\n00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.550\nit has very little support when\nit comes to the other rules,\n\n84\n00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.620\nexcept for DNS and, surprise surprise,\nweb services, right?\n\n85\n00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.879\nBecause it's called web.\n\n86\n00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:35.488\nAnd if you wanna run a web server,\nyou can buy web version,\n\n87\n00:04:35.488 --> 00:04:38.135\nthe web edition of 2008 R2.\n\n88\n00:04:38.135 --> 00:04:39.500\nIt's a lot cheaper, right?\n\n89\n00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.560\nIt's a slimmed-down version of Server.\n\n90\n00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.680\nAnd if you never plan on using\nthat as a domain controller or\n\n91\n00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.830\nanything like that, why pay full price for\nenterprise when you can buy that.\n\n92\n00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.870\nSlim down cheaper version for\nyour web server, right?\n\n93\n00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.050\nMakes financial sense.\n\n94\n00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.696\n>> Yeah Mike you bring\nup a really good point.\n\n95\n00:04:55.696 --> 00:04:58.400\nActually, this cost does come into play\n\n96\n00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.560\nwhen you are choosing the version\nof the serve that you want to use.\n\n97\n00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.230\nIf you don't have the money to buy a more\nfull featured server operating system,\n\n98\n00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.560\nyou may have to go with a little less.\n\n99\n00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.980\nNow if you need that, it's a must have,\nI have to have these types of services\n\n100\n00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.672\navailable in my server, then well, you're\njust gonna have to pony up the dough,\n\n101\n00:05:16.672 --> 00:05:19.194\ncome off of the wallet and\nbuy what you need.\n\n102\n00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:22.259\nBecause in the end you're really,\nwhat's the point of installing something\n\n103\n00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:23.941\nthat's not gonna do\nwhat you need it to do?\n\n104\n00:05:23.941 --> 00:05:25.533\nNo, it'd be a waste of money.\n\n105\n00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:29.509\nSo we want to definitely take into account\nin the fact that it will cost you money,\n\n106\n00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:32.320\nmore money for\nthis type versus more money for that type.\n\n107\n00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.300\nAnd then again, services as well.\n\n108\n00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.080\nI don't need all those DFS services.\n\n109\n00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.650\nI just wanna run a web server.\n\n110\n00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.910\nThat's all I'm trying to do is\nget a web server installed.\n\n111\n00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.220\nThat web option's probably my best bet.\n\n112\n00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.830\nNow will the other options\nallow me to run a web server?\n\n113\n00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:46.770\nSure.\n\n114\n00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.880\nYou can see from Mike's chart, there's a\nlot of them that support that web ability\n\n115\n00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.140\nbut if that's all I need it for and\nI don't see any group outside of that,\n\n116\n00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.170\nI'm never gonna scope out\nof that web environment,\n\n117\n00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.150\nthat's probably the guy I'm\ngonna go ahead and choose with.\n\n118\n00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:05.040\nSo it's all about the application,\nwhat type of server for what type of job.\n\n119\n00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.610\nAnd that's what this chart, thank you\nMicrosoft for giving us this chart, so\n\n120\n00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.750\nwe know exactly what it is each\none of their server products do,\n\n121\n00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.530\nso that I can choose the right one for\nmy environment.\n\n122\n00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:15.280\n>> Exactly.\n\n123\n00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.410\nNow, there's a couple more specialized\neditions that you might run into, and\n\n124\n00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.080\nprobably should be\nfamiliar with on the exam.\n\n125\n00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.070\nWe pull that little chart back up here,\nI can see one called Foundation and\n\n126\n00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.800\none called HBC.\n\n127\n00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.580\nFoundation is actually one,\nyou cannot buy this at the store.\n\n128\n00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.670\nYou can't go and get a retail copy of it.\n\n129\n00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:38.585\nThis is gonna come preloaded on the server\nfrom your OEM like Dell or HP or whomever.\n\n130\n00:06:38.585 --> 00:06:40.889\n>> Or you can get it from\nMike's bootleg site right now.\n\n131\n00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:41.393\n>> [LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE]\n>> That's a joke.\n\n132\n00:06:41.393 --> 00:06:42.289\n>> [INAUDIBLE] Shh.\n\n133\n00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:42.811\nDon't tell anybody that, right?\n\n134\n00:06:42.811 --> 00:06:44.384\n>> Not doing that.\n\n135\n00:06:44.384 --> 00:06:47.279\n>> And it does have limited support.\n\n136\n00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:48.379\nYou can see it does support quite\n\n137\n00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:49.219\na few roles.\n\n138\n00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:51.720\nYou know, and it is limited.\n\n139\n00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.940\nThere's a couple other limitations that\nI'll come back to that in just a second.\n\n140\n00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:01.110\nHPC is my high performance\ncluster operator edition.\n\n141\n00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:05.560\nSo it's really very similar to Standard,\nexcept it's got all\n\n142\n00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:11.090\nthe cluster tools preloaded up in it, and\nit's designed to be run in a cluster.\n\n143\n00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:15.410\nIf you're not familiar with that, so when\nwe take more than one physical server and\n\n144\n00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.290\nmake it look like one\nserver to the network.\n\n145\n00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:23.880\nSo when your users connect to the server,\nthey basically see this virtual front-end,\n\n146\n00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.720\nbut behind it,\nthere might be four physical machines.\n\n147\n00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.840\nAnd if one those guys fails\nthe other three are still going\n\n148\n00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.530\nthe users don't notice any difference.\n\n149\n00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:35.780\nIt can also help spread that workload\nacross those four physical machines.\n\n150\n00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:40.130\nSo this is an addition that's\nreally designed for those clusters.\n\n151\n00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:44.306\nSo one of the primary things is\nprobably gonna be the role support and\n\n152\n00:07:44.306 --> 00:07:49.288\nas we scroll down here, there's also\nanother thing we're gonna consider, and\n\n153\n00:07:49.288 --> 00:07:50.626\nthat is server core.\n\n154\n00:07:50.626 --> 00:07:55.420\nNow, server core we're gonna talk a lot\nabout in just a little bit, but core is\n\n155\n00:07:55.420 --> 00:08:00.668\na version, or a way to install, I should\nsay, the operating system without the GUI.\n\n156\n00:08:00.668 --> 00:08:03.126\nAnd we'll talk about what\nthe heck I mean and why.\n\n157\n00:08:03.126 --> 00:08:04.251\nIn just a little bit.\n\n158\n00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:06.959\nBut you can see Enterprise,\nData Center, and Standard.\n\n159\n00:08:06.959 --> 00:08:08.800\nAll of these go web.\n\n160\n00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.190\nComes in Core.\n\n161\n00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:13.950\nItanium and Foundation does not\nhave a Core version for that.\n\n162\n00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:15.810\nSo if you wanted to\ninstall without the GUI,\n\n163\n00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:18.250\nyou would be using one\nof these first four.\n\n164\n00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:22.760\nAnd then down below this,\ncomparison by technical specification.\n\n165\n00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.830\nI'm not too worried about this stuff,\nespecially for this exam.\n\n166\n00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.950\nNot too worried about\nthe top part of this, but\n\n167\n00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:31.130\nthis bottom part could\ndefinitely come into play.\n\n168\n00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:34.490\nIf you need remote access connection.\n\n169\n00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:37.940\nYou can see if I go back up to\nthe top here this first one is web and\n\n170\n00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:42.140\nit doesn't support any\nnetwork access connection.\n\n171\n00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:46.390\nSo you can't use this addition if\nyou want to set up a VPN server.\n\n172\n00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:48.360\nA routing and remote access server.\n\n173\n00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.680\nIf you wanna go to standard, you're\nlimited to 250 concurrent connections.\n\n174\n00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.090\nThat might be perfect for your company,\n\n175\n00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.590\nyou've only got 50 users,\n30 of them are on the road.\n\n176\n00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:58.470\nPerfect, I can get away with that.\n\n177\n00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.190\nIf I have more than that, though,\nthat edition isn't gonna work for me.\n\n178\n00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.890\nI'm gonna have to move up here\nto Enterprise or Data Center,\n\n179\n00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:09.380\nwhich has unlimited number of routing or\nmode access connections, right.\n\n180\n00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.150\nWhat else could we look at?\n\n181\n00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.100\nThe rest of these are pretty much\nthe same, or the remote desktop admins,\n\n182\n00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:18.200\nis the same, if you're setting up\na remote desktop gateway service again,\n\n183\n00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:23.120\nlimited number of concurrent\nconnections on some of those additions.\n\n184\n00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:28.470\nVirtual image usage, this is a big one\nhere, as far as the rights that you get.\n\n185\n00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:33.040\nWhen you buy this edition of server,\nyou get your license, right?\n\n186\n00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.170\nYou guys are used to doing\nthis on your home machine.\n\n187\n00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:38.070\nYou buy that PC, you've got that\nsticker on the side of the machine.\n\n188\n00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:41.860\nThat's your license to run that operating\nsystem on that piece of hardware.\n\n189\n00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.630\nWhen I look at buying server,\nthis web doesn't have any.\n\n190\n00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:48.900\nYou can run it as a guest.\n\n191\n00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:53.870\nWhat that means is if I buy\nthe web edition of Server 2008 R2.\n\n192\n00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:56.490\nI can install it inside a virtual machine.\n\n193\n00:09:56.490 --> 00:10:00.290\nI'll get one license, and I can either\ninstall it on a physical machine, or\n\n194\n00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:02.300\nI could install it in a virtual machine.\n\n195\n00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:06.260\nWhen I go over here to standard,\nI buy one copy of standard and\n\n196\n00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.950\nI can set up one physical machine, and\n\n197\n00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:14.540\none virtual machine running that\nedition of 2008 R2 for one price.\n\n198\n00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:18.850\nRight, so I'm really getting two licenses,\none physical and one virtual.\n\n199\n00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:24.170\nWhen I get up to Enterprise,\nI get one physical and four virtuals.\n\n200\n00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.690\nWhen I get up to data center,\nit's unlimited.\n\n201\n00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:30.540\nI get an unlimited number of\ninstalls of that with that license,\n\n202\n00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.880\nas far as virtualization goes, right?\n\n203\n00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.520\nAnybody think well, so\nhow would I make that decision?\n\n204\n00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:41.430\nWell, if I need one host and three or\n\n205\n00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:44.550\nfour virtual machines,\nthis one makes sense, right.\n\n206\n00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:45.780\nIf I need five or\n\n207\n00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:50.010\nsix virtual machines, maybe I buy\ntwo editions of Enterprise, right,\n\n208\n00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:53.730\nbecause that's still gonna be cheaper\nthan buying an edition of Data Center.\n\n209\n00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.670\nData Center is much more\nexpensive than Enterprise.\n\n210\n00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.560\nBut there's gonna be a tipping\npoint that I'm gonna get to.\n\n211\n00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.940\nIf my boss comes to me and says, look,\nwe're gonna need four physicals,\n\n212\n00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:07.800\nwe're gonna need like 20 virtual machines,\nit might be cheaper to just buy\n\n213\n00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.630\none edition of Data Center, take advantage\nof the unlimited number of virtuals I\n\n214\n00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:15.600\ncan create rather than buying\nfour Enterprise licenses.\n\n215\n00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.100\nRight?\n\n216\n00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:19.090\nSo, something else we've gotta think\nabout when we're choosing that edition.\n\n217\n00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:22.370\nFeatures or\nroles that are available and licensing,\n\n218\n00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:24.640\nthat's the other big decision maker there.\n\n219\n00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.760\nAnd again,\nyou can get this chart from Microsoft.\n\n220\n00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.340\nI'll see if I can put up\nthe show notes for you.\n\n221\n00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:33.180\nI wouldn't worry about\nmemorizing most of this stuff.\n\n222\n00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.540\nThe licensing,\nthat's pretty easy to memorize.\n\n223\n00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.320\nI would remember that.\n\n224\n00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.490\nAnd then I'd remember some of the features\nthat are missing from standard, and\n\n225\n00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:44.600\nthen I'd realize that web is\na great version to get or\n\n226\n00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.980\naddition to get if all\nI need is a web server.\n\n227\n00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:48.490\nRight?\n\n228\n00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:51.420\nOn the exam, that's the kind of\nthing they're gonna ask you.\n\n229\n00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.480\nYou wanna set up a web\nserver out in your DMZ.\n\n230\n00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.390\nWhat version of,\nwhat edition of 2008 R2 should you buy?\n\n231\n00:11:58.390 --> 00:11:59.847\nWhich would be the most economical?\n\n232\n00:11:59.847 --> 00:12:02.840\nThe web would be the most economical, so\n\n233\n00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.330\nthose are the kinds of things\nwe're going to think about.\n\n234\n00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:06.290\nAll right, so\n\n235\n00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:09.990\nwe've got these different editions\nof server that we have to deal with.\n\n236\n00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:13.230\nThat's when we're buying it,\nwhen we're getting those licences.\n\n237\n00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:16.837\nNow, I'm gonna kinda jump around on you,\nDaniel here,\n\n238\n00:12:16.837 --> 00:12:19.570\nwell, we'll go into partitioning.\n\n239\n00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:22.510\nThe objectives, they call them\nout in a very strange order.\n\n240\n00:12:23.805 --> 00:12:25.265\nThat's Microsoft for you.\n\n241\n00:12:25.265 --> 00:12:26.705\n>> We don't write the objectives.\n\n242\n00:12:26.705 --> 00:12:28.295\nWe just try to teach you about them.\n\n243\n00:12:28.295 --> 00:12:29.625\n>> Next on the list is partitioning.\n\n244\n00:12:29.625 --> 00:12:33.145\nI don't know how we go from editions\nof Windows to partitioning, but\n\n245\n00:12:33.145 --> 00:12:34.215\nthat's what we're going to do.\n\n246\n00:12:34.215 --> 00:12:37.130\n>> Maybe it's because,\nwhen you're installing a server,\n\n247\n00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:39.710\none of the first things you're gonna do is\nyou're gonna partition a hard drive and\n\n248\n00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:42.340\nthat's what we're getting\nready to talk about.\n\n249\n00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:46.640\nSo it does kind of tie into\ninstallation here now that I've got my\n\n250\n00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.180\nversion I know exactly which one\nI need I've made my purchase,\n\n251\n00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.520\nI have my licenses I'm ready to go.\n\n252\n00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:56.080\nWell once I slap that media\ninto a drive or a USB or\n\n253\n00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.480\naccess it through a network or\nhowever I'm doing my installation,\n\n254\n00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.700\none of the things I'm gonna\ndo is partition a hard drive.\n\n255\n00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.460\nSo maybe that was their line of thinking.\n\n256\n00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:04.950\n>> Yeah, you know that would make sense.\n\n257\n00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:07.200\nAnd I'll tell you what,\nlet's talk about install and\n\n258\n00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.370\nthen we'll talk about partitioning as we\ngo through talking about install as well.\n\n259\n00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:13.290\n>> Makes sense.\n>> We kinda do it all at once.\n\n260\n00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:15.640\nWe'll kind of make one\nbig party out of it.\n\n261\n00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.610\nAll right, so when we talked about\ninstalling the operating system,\n\n262\n00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:22.030\nwe picked the edition that we want,\nnow we're going to do an install.\n\n263\n00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.250\nWe've got a decision to make.\n\n264\n00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.730\nWe're either going to\nbe doing an upgrade or\n\n265\n00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.900\nwe're going to be doing what\nwe call a clean install.\n\n266\n00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:35.950\nNow, an upgrade that means I've already\ngot server running on my operating system.\n\n267\n00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:39.850\nAnd let me see if I can find\nthat real quick for us here.\n\n268\n00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:41.250\nActually I can tell you.\n\n269\n00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.480\nI know it by heart.\n\n270\n00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.550\nUpgrade again,\nyou're running a previous version or\n\n271\n00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:48.120\na previous edition of Windows and\nnow you wanna upgrade.\n\n272\n00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:53.780\nLet's say you were running 2003 and,\nnow you want to install a 2008 R2,\n\n273\n00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:57.390\nbut your 2003 server has been in\nproduction for a little while.\n\n274\n00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:59.370\nAnd, it's got certain roles on it.\n\n275\n00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:02.580\nIt's got DNS on there,\nit's got DHCP on there.\n\n276\n00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:05.160\nAll configured the way you need it for\nyour enterprise.\n\n277\n00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:09.330\nIf I just build a new server and\ninstall 2008, I've gotta redo all that.\n\n278\n00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.990\nIf I wanna keep all that configuration,\nI can do an upgrade, right?\n\n279\n00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.920\nWe're just swapping out\nthe operating system.\n\n280\n00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.260\nWe're upgrading that OS,\neverything should,\n\n281\n00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:22.030\nand that's the operative term there,\nshould still be there.\n\n282\n00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:24.220\nWhen I'm done with the upgrade.\n\n283\n00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.820\nSo, I've got my 2003 DNS server.\n\n284\n00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.660\nI grab my 2008 R2 disk.\n\n285\n00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:28.750\nI slap it in there.\n\n286\n00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:30.750\nI go through the upgrade process.\n\n287\n00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:33.310\nWhen I'm done, it's still running DNS.\n\n288\n00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:35.920\nAnd DHCP or\nwhatever it was running before.\n\n289\n00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.200\nAll my scopes, all my zones,\nall my configuration, is still there.\n\n290\n00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.885\nSo, very nice, very easy, right.\n\n291\n00:14:41.885 --> 00:14:42.990\nIt's a lot less work.\n\n292\n00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:45.600\nIt's very easy to do an upgrade.\n\n293\n00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.180\nAgain, you just slap the disk in and\nyou go.\n\n294\n00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.870\nNot really any decisions to make.\n\n295\n00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.700\nNot a lot of extra work to make.\n\n296\n00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.090\nSounds like the way to go.\n\n297\n00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:55.509\nThat is what you wanna do.\n\n298\n00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:57.230\nNot really.\n\n299\n00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.070\nI mean, it's actually not\nthe recommended way to go.\n\n300\n00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:02.300\nAnd you might think, well, why?\n\n301\n00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.230\nAnd that's because when we do an upgrade\n\n302\n00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:10.150\nsometimes what happens is there's certain\nthings don't get cleaned up properly.\n\n303\n00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:13.670\nThere might be a DLL file\nthat doesn't get overwritten\n\n304\n00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.990\nby the new operating system and\nit should have.\n\n305\n00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:19.310\nOr there's one that does get\noverwritten and it shouldn't have.\n\n306\n00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:22.930\nLittle, what's a good term for it?\n\n307\n00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:23.890\n>> Inconsistencies.\n\n308\n00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:25.600\n>> Inconsistencies, yes.\n\n309\n00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.130\nLittle things get left from\nthe old operating system and\n\n310\n00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:32.930\nthey end up causing problems\nin my new operating system and\n\n311\n00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:35.840\nthey can be very very\ndifficult to trouble shoot.\n\n312\n00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.320\nIt's quirky little gremlins\nstart appearing in this server.\n\n313\n00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.780\nAnd I don't know why.\n\n314\n00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:44.030\nAnd you find out it was an upgrade and\nthat's usually when I say, oh, well,\n\n315\n00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:45.850\nthere's probably your problem.\n\n316\n00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:47.370\n>> Yeah.\nDefinitely.\n\n317\n00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:50.766\nYou don't want to migrate any issues\nthat you had from your previous version,\n\n318\n00:15:50.766 --> 00:15:52.160\nanyway, into the new version.\n\n319\n00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.732\nBecause, let's just face it, a lot of\ntimes, after a system's been in place for\n\n320\n00:15:56.732 --> 00:16:00.793\na little bit of while, and it does\nstart to, you need to do some cleanup.\n\n321\n00:16:00.793 --> 00:16:03.543\nAnd sometime's that's just\nnot Feasible to be done.\n\n322\n00:16:03.543 --> 00:16:04.657\nThis is a perfect time,\n\n323\n00:16:04.657 --> 00:16:08.130\nthat you’re ready you know what I’m\ngonna upgrade my operating system.\n\n324\n00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:11.010\nI wanna move from this\nversion to the newer version.\n\n325\n00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:12.590\nGet that installed, started using that.\n\n326\n00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:15.210\nIt’s a perfect time to go ahead and\nclean that mess up.\n\n327\n00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:18.130\nStart with a clean install\ninstead of that upgrade path.\n\n328\n00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:22.400\nYou can do an upgrade path again just\nusually most people would tell you that's\n\n329\n00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.040\nnot the best way to go.\n\n330\n00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:27.330\nThat's the way you have to go\nbecause maybe the documentation for\n\n331\n00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:30.240\nyour settings and\nstuff isn't what it's supposed to be and\n\n332\n00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:34.220\nyou're gonna have a hard time getting\nit rebuilt the way you need it.\n\n333\n00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:37.775\nThat might be a good way to go to\nuse the upgrade path, but you're\n\n334\n00:16:37.775 --> 00:16:40.795\nprobably gonna experience some of those\nissues like what Mike was talking about.\n\n335\n00:16:40.795 --> 00:16:44.495\nThe better way to go is the clean install.\n\n336\n00:16:44.495 --> 00:16:47.075\nMake sure that none of those\nold issues are around.\n\n337\n00:16:47.075 --> 00:16:49.880\nThey're not gonna migrate\ninto the new system\n\n338\n00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.740\nyou have no inconsistencies\nfrom the old to the new.\n\n339\n00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:57.280\nYou just have a new clean installation,\nand everything should start working.\n\n340\n00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.741\nThen it's our job as administrators, to go\nin there and make sure all the settings\n\n341\n00:17:00.741 --> 00:17:03.669\nget put where they need to be, so\nthat our systems run as we need them.\n\n342\n00:17:03.669 --> 00:17:06.003\n>> Exactly, and\nyou make an excellent point Daniel.\n\n343\n00:17:06.003 --> 00:17:08.270\nYou're upgrading your problems.\n\n344\n00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:10.320\nPeople think that an upgrade\nis gonna fix their problem.\n\n345\n00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.190\nOh, I've got this Server 2003\nserver that's been here for\n\n346\n00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:16.570\na while it's got some issues,\nit's been a little weird lately, so\n\n347\n00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:20.070\nI'm gonna upgrade it to 2008 R2 and\nexpect everything to go away and\n\n348\n00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:23.140\nit's gonna work like this brand new\nbeautiful server it's not gonna happen.\n\n349\n00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.360\nAll your doing is upgrading your problems.\n\n350\n00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:26.800\nNot the best way to go.\n\n351\n00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.210\nBut as you said,\nif it's software that I don't have,\n\n352\n00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:31.600\nI can't get the source files for anymore.\n\n353\n00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:36.490\nI won't be able to recreate that then an\nupgrade might be the way you have to go.\n\n354\n00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:40.190\nBut the recommendation is going\nto be to do a clean install.\n\n355\n00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:41.980\nThat means I am starting\nwith a clean slate.\n\n356\n00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.500\nThat machine might have\nan operating system on it already.\n\n357\n00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:45.420\nI'm gonna blow it away.\n\n358\n00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:46.740\nI'm not saving anything from it.\n\n359\n00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.510\nI'm gonna format that drive.\n\n360\n00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:53.270\nOr I'm building a brand new machine,\nand I'm installing 2008 R2 on there.\n\n361\n00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:55.900\nAnd then I can reinstall those roles,\n\n362\n00:17:55.900 --> 00:18:00.630\nreconfigure them from my documentation or\nI can migrate roles.\n\n363\n00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.720\nMicrosoft has great documentation\nout there available for\n\n364\n00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.480\nmigrating roles from\none machine to another.\n\n365\n00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:11.560\nSo if I would need to move DNS from that\n2003 to the 2008, I can go to Microsoft,\n\n366\n00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.330\nI can get their documentation\non migrating DNS and\n\n367\n00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:17.160\nthey'll give me step by\nstep of what I need to do.\n\n368\n00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:23.810\nInstall it over here, set up a zone\ntransfer from the 2003 to In 2008.\n\n369\n00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:26.820\nBlow away your 2003,\nnow you're good to go.\n\n370\n00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:27.820\nThat kind of thing.\n\n371\n00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.440\nThey'll have those step by steps for you,\n\n372\n00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:33.210\nso they try to help you make\nit a little bit easier.\n\n373\n00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:36.440\nClean install, though, is definitely\nthe way to go and I'm gonna show you here.\n\n374\n00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:41.610\nWhen we go to install on my screen, and\nwe'll talk about it as we go through here.\n\n375\n00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:45.460\nI've got the 2008 R2 DVD\nloaded up in this machine.\n\n376\n00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:49.630\nThere's nothing on the hard drive so it\nimmediately boots to the DVD cause there's\n\n377\n00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:54.370\nnothing to boot to on the hard drive and\nnow it's launching that install process.\n\n378\n00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:56.350\nSo we'll get this guy up and running.\n\n379\n00:18:56.350 --> 00:19:00.750\nAnd while that's going-,\nwhat the heck was I going to?\n\n380\n00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.270\nI was going to talk about something else.\n\n381\n00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:08.865\nAnd it completely just slipped my mind.\n\n382\n00:19:08.865 --> 00:19:12.810\n[LAUGH] Oh, I know what it was\nyou know when we do an install\n\n383\n00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:17.870\nwe can do what we call an interactive\ninstall or an attended install.\n\n384\n00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:19.190\nWhich is what I'm doing here.\n\n385\n00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:20.720\nI've gotta interact with this machine.\n\n386\n00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.870\nI've got decisions to make.\n\n387\n00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:23.670\nI've got questions to answer.\n\n388\n00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:28.065\nThe wizard's prompting me here for what\nlanguage I want to install in, my time and\n\n389\n00:19:28.065 --> 00:19:30.753\ncurrency format,\nmy keyboard and input method.\n\n390\n00:19:30.753 --> 00:19:33.627\nAnd I'll go ahead and click Next.\n\n391\n00:19:33.627 --> 00:19:36.560\nAnd then I'll click Install Now.\n\n392\n00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:39.010\nAnd it's gonna start the process, right.\n\n393\n00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:39.960\nWhile this is going,\n\n394\n00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:44.840\nanother way that I might do an install\nis called an unattended install.\n\n395\n00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:47.910\nAn unattended install means I'm gonna\n\n396\n00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:52.510\ncreate a file that has all the answers\nthat I'm doing here right now manually.\n\n397\n00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:57.090\nWhat my language is, my keyboard layout,\nmy time and currency format.\n\n398\n00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:59.840\nI can save all those answers\nin an answer file, and\n\n399\n00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:05.090\nthen I can run setup.exe,\nwhich is what starts this little wizard.\n\n400\n00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:09.870\nAnd from a command line, I can run it from\na command line with a switch unattend,\n\n401\n00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:12.390\ncolon, and\nthen the path to that answer file.\n\n402\n00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:14.380\nAnd then the wizard doesn't need me.\n\n403\n00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:17.620\nI can just sit back and relax,\ngo watch TV, do whatever.\n\n404\n00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:19.280\nIt's got all the information it needs.\n\n405\n00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.510\nIt can pull it from the answer file.\n\n406\n00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:23.610\nWhen I come back,\nI've got a server ready to go.\n\n407\n00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:25.840\nSo you can do an interactive install.\n\n408\n00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:26.990\nI can do it here or\n\n409\n00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:30.970\nwe can do that unattended install\nif we create an answer file.\n\n410\n00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:34.230\nAnd I'll show you an example of\nan answer file here in just a minute.\n\n411\n00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:39.660\nThis particular DVD has several editions\nof Windows Server 2008 R2 available on it.\n\n412\n00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:41.460\nAnd I can pick the one I want.\n\n413\n00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:44.480\nI am just going to go 2008 R2 Enterprise.\n\n414\n00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.150\nFull install, and I will click Next.\n\n415\n00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:51.330\nI will agree to the EULA because otherwise\nI will not be able to click Next.\n\n416\n00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:55.420\nHere is where I would\nchoose to do an upgrade.\n\n417\n00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:59.242\nIf this had an operating\nsystem on it already, or\n\n418\n00:20:59.242 --> 00:21:03.543\nI can do my custom,\nwhich lets me do the clean install.\n\n419\n00:21:03.543 --> 00:21:05.503\nUpgrade paths, I didn't mention that.\n\n420\n00:21:05.503 --> 00:21:12.027\nFor 2008 R2,\nif I'm running 2003 Service Pack 2,\n\n421\n00:21:12.027 --> 00:21:16.550\nOr 2008 I can upgrade to 2008 R2.\n\n422\n00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:20.950\nIf I'm running anything older than that,\n2003 without the service pack,\n\n423\n00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:24.200\nI would need to Service Pack it\nfirst before I could do an upgrade.\n\n424\n00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:28.020\nIf it's older than that you might\nas well just do a clean install.\n\n425\n00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:32.470\nI mean, if you were running Windows 2000,\ntechnically you could upgrade 2000 to\n\n426\n00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:37.670\n2003, and then Service Pack 2003 a couple\ntimes, and then upgrade to 2008.\n\n427\n00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:40.910\nBut we just told you that an upgrade\nis not the best way to go.\n\n428\n00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:44.251\nYou darn sure don't want to do four\nupgrades to get it installed, right?\n\n429\n00:21:44.251 --> 00:21:45.679\n[LAUGH].\n>> Yeah that wouldn't' be fun\n\n430\n00:21:45.679 --> 00:21:46.252\nat all [LAUGH].\n\n431\n00:21:46.252 --> 00:21:48.575\n>> All right, so\nnow it's asking me about the drive, and\n\n432\n00:21:48.575 --> 00:21:49.837\nthis is where we can go back and\n\n433\n00:21:49.837 --> 00:21:53.293\ntalk about that partitioning because\nI've got to install my operating system.\n\n434\n00:21:53.293 --> 00:21:58.085\nIt sees a 40 gigabyte drive and it's says,\nhey is this the drive you want me to use?\n\n435\n00:21:58.085 --> 00:22:02.090\nIf you had more than one physical drive\nin that machine they would show up here.\n\n436\n00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:03.630\nYou'd pick the one you want.\n\n437\n00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:05.530\nNow, I might wanna use,\n\n438\n00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:10.400\nin fact, most likely I would,\nuse all 40 gigabytes for my OS.\n\n439\n00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:14.960\nTechnically with Server 2008 R2 I can\nget away with less space than that.\n\n440\n00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:18.620\nBut then if you ever wanna put a service\npack and updates and the applications and\n\n441\n00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:20.750\nthings like that,\nyou're gonna need a little more space.\n\n442\n00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:23.630\nBut let me show you,\nif I click drive option this\n\n443\n00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:26.890\nis where I can give it the ability\nto create new volumes, right?\n\n444\n00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:30.260\nI can take that 40 gigabytes and\ndivide it up.\n\n445\n00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.160\nCreate those volumes on there.\n\n446\n00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:37.110\nAnd if this was a four terabyte drive\nI might want to set aside 60 gigs\n\n447\n00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:42.860\nfrom my operating system and\nthen use the other 340 gigs for,\n\n448\n00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:45.460\nif I did my math right there,\nfor something else, right?\n\n449\n00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:49.837\nWhat did I say?\nFour terabyte drive.\n\n450\n00:22:49.837 --> 00:22:52.378\n>> I don't know, I'm not good at math.\n\n451\n00:22:52.378 --> 00:22:55.844\n>> Four terrabyte drive, yeah,\nanyway, minus 60 gigabytes,\n\n452\n00:22:55.844 --> 00:22:57.711\ngives me 3.4 terrabytes left.\n\n453\n00:22:57.711 --> 00:22:58.211\nThere we go.\n\n454\n00:22:58.211 --> 00:22:59.045\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n455\n00:22:59.045 --> 00:23:00.160\n>> That's what we'll say.\n\n456\n00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:00.950\nAll right.\n\n457\n00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:03.320\nYeah, I didn't do so\ngood in math in school.\n\n458\n00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.800\nSo you might want to do that, right?\n\n459\n00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.670\nAnd this is where you can.\n\n460\n00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:12.820\nI can come in here and say alright,\nyou've got 40 gigs of unallocated space.\n\n461\n00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.780\nI'll click new, and it says well\nhow big do you want to make it?\n\n462\n00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:21.570\nAnd let's say I want to do 30 gigs so\nwe'll just do about 30,000 there.\n\n463\n00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:27.586\nI'll click apply, and this is a nice\nround number, then I'll click okay.\n\n464\n00:23:27.586 --> 00:23:31.336\nThere I've got my new partition\nthat I've created, 29.2.\n\n465\n00:23:31.336 --> 00:23:32.880\nNow notice what Windows did.\n\n466\n00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.110\nIt created this little 100\nmegabyte partition and\n\n467\n00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:38.910\nthat's where some of my system\nfiles are gonna reside.\n\n468\n00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:40.920\nIt's gonna do that automatically.\n\n469\n00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:44.230\nAnd I have ten gigs left that I\ncould do something else with.\n\n470\n00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:47.240\nNow, I could go ahead and\ncreate another volume here, but\n\n471\n00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.690\nI'm not installing the OS there.\n\n472\n00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:51.667\nThis is the one I'm going to\ninstall the operating system on.\n\n473\n00:23:51.667 --> 00:23:56.424\nAnd what Microsoft will recommend is,\nif you want to create multiple volumes or\n\n474\n00:23:56.424 --> 00:24:00.543\npartitions on that drive,\nDon't do it during the install process.\n\n475\n00:24:00.543 --> 00:24:03.947\nCreate the one you need to\ninstall your operating system and\n\n476\n00:24:03.947 --> 00:24:06.830\nthen install your operating system, right.\n\n477\n00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:09.950\nThen when you get done installing,\nyou can go back into disk management and\n\n478\n00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:14.010\nyou can take the rest of the unallocated\nspace and divide it up anyway you want.\n\n479\n00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:18.990\nBut during the install don't go and create\na whole bunch of different partitions.\n\n480\n00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:21.370\nJust create the one you need,\nget it installed, and\n\n481\n00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:25.650\nthen use the operating system itself to\ncreate those additional volumes, right.\n\n482\n00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:29.630\nSo I'll choose the one I want there,\nand I'll go ahead and click Next, and\n\n483\n00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:30.620\nthen it begins to process.\n\n484\n00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:34.910\nIt's gonna copy over the files,\nit's going to expand them all out,\n\n485\n00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:39.070\nset up Windows, and eventually I'm\ngonna come up to my operating system.\n\n486\n00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:42.214\nAnd it's that easy, right,\nit's really not that difficult.\n\n487\n00:24:42.214 --> 00:24:44.530\nI mean how many questions\ndid I have to answer?\n\n488\n00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:48.520\nWhat my language was, my keyboard layout,\nmy time and currency format.\n\n489\n00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:50.750\nI had to agree to the EULA.\n\n490\n00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:54.650\nI had to pick a destination for\ninstalling the operating system.\n\n491\n00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:59.060\nI got a chance to partition the drive\nif I wanted to, and that was it.\n\n492\n00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:02.490\nThere's really not a lot\nto installing 2000 NR2.\n\n493\n00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:04.520\nIt doesn't get too much easier.\n\n494\n00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:09.250\nNow I do want to show you,\nlet's see if I can find it right here,\n\n495\n00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:12.700\nI've got a sample answer\nfile that I wanna pull up.\n\n496\n00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:18.350\nCuz if we wanna automate that, here's\nmy little unattend file that I made.\n\n497\n00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:23.450\nAnd I can see here a lot of the\ninformation that we haven't seen at all.\n\n498\n00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:27.100\nLike when that installation\nprocess finishes,\n\n499\n00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:30.230\nthere's gonna be a few more questions\nthat I'm gonna have to answer.\n\n500\n00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:32.440\nJust like if you've ever\ngot a brand new PC, right.\n\n501\n00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.180\nYou gotta give it your name.\n\n502\n00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.520\nWhat do you wanna call the computer?\n\n503\n00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.010\nThings like name the machine,\nthings like that.\n\n504\n00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:40.140\nThose are still to come.\n\n505\n00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:43.910\nWe haven't seen that yet but\nthat's what all these are.\n\n506\n00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:47.420\nIf you look at what the domain\nI want to belong to,\n\n507\n00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.950\nwhat my username is going to be.\n\n508\n00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:52.320\nHere's the drive I want to install on.\n\n509\n00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:55.910\nDisc ID zero that's the first\ndrive in the system.\n\n510\n00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:58.980\nHere's the partition I want to\ninstall it on on that drive.\n\n511\n00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:01.520\nThe first partition on that drive.\n\n512\n00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.800\nNow there are ways to\ncreate these partitions.\n\n513\n00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:06.710\nIn fact, that's what they're doing here.\n\n514\n00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:09.010\nWill wipe disc, false.\n\n515\n00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:13.670\nModify partitions, order one,\npartition one, letter c, right.\n\n516\n00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:16.030\nGive that volume a name.\n\n517\n00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:17.620\nAgain, not important for\n\n518\n00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:21.630\nthis exam that you understand\nthe details of this answer file.\n\n519\n00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:26.000\nWhat I want you to understand is that\nI can automate the installation.\n\n520\n00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.400\nI don't have to sit there and\ngo through that wizard manually.\n\n521\n00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:32.890\nI can create an answer file,\nand I can automate the install.\n\n522\n00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:36.420\nBecause on the exam they're gonna ask you,\nwhat's the most efficient way to install\n\n523\n00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:39.640\nif you've got 20 servers to roll out,\nwhat should you do?\n\n524\n00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.880\nTake the DVD one at a time and\ngo machine to machine to machine?\n\n525\n00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:46.670\nOr maybe set up an answer file and\ntry to automate that installation process.\n\n526\n00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:49.200\nSo just understanding\nthe options that you have\n\n527\n00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.110\nwhen it comes to installing\nthe operating system.\n\n528\n00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:55.840\nThat's what we need for\nour fundamentals exam.\n\n529\n00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:56.510\nAll right, let's see.\n\n530\n00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:59.070\nLet's check on how the AST\nis already rebooting.\n\n531\n00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:02.570\n2008 are installs lightning quick.\n\n532\n00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:05.430\nIt's finishing up the install.\n\n533\n00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:08.250\nThe copying of all the files from the ISO.\n\n534\n00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:13.800\nNow you can see it's starting up services\nand it's gonna complete my install,\n\n535\n00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:17.590\nand in a minute we'll be back to my,\nwe'll be out of our desktop.\n\n536\n00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:22.100\nWell actually I should say we've got\na little wizard to finish at the end here,\n\n537\n00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:23.550\nand then we'll have a full blown server.\n\n538\n00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:26.410\n>> A little post installation\nthat goes along with it.\n\n539\n00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:29.950\nBut again, as you've seen,\nthis isn't a very difficult process.\n\n540\n00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:32.170\nActually it's come a long\nway from when Mike and\n\n541\n00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:34.440\nI first started installing\nserver software.\n\n542\n00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:38.850\nThis is amazing compared to back in\nthe day when we were working with\n\n543\n00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:40.570\nNT4 and Server 2000.\n\n544\n00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:43.080\nThat could be a little bit of a bear.\n\n545\n00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:44.540\nThis is very, very nice.\n\n546\n00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:46.770\nIt didn't take very long at all.\n\n547\n00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:48.440\nAnd that is the best part about it.\n\n548\n00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:51.080\nAnybody that has a little bit of\nwherewithal, a little bit of computer\n\n549\n00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:54.080\nknowledge, you can probably dive right\ninto one of these installations.\n\n550\n00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.460\nSo if you can get your hands on a,\nmaybe an evaluation copy or\n\n551\n00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:59.310\nsomething like that,\nbuild a virtual machine.\n\n552\n00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:02.390\nDon't be afraid to slap that, maybe you've\ngot some old hardware sitting around,\n\n553\n00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:04.200\nyou wanna play with that server software.\n\n554\n00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.333\nThat would be the best place to do it,\nright.\n\n555\n00:28:06.333 --> 00:28:09.930\nUse a virtual machine, old server\nsoftware, or I'm sorry, hardware.\n\n556\n00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:13.617\nSlap that guy on there, see how easy\nit really is to get it installed.\n\n557\n00:28:13.617 --> 00:28:17.620\nI mean, Mike, I don't think that took\nyou ten minutes to be honest with you.\n\n558\n00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:18.460\n>> Yeah, it didn't right.\n\n559\n00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:23.320\nIn the time it took to shoot this show,\nI'm gonna have a brand new server set up,\n\n560\n00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:24.950\nand we didn't start at\nthe beginning of the show.\n\n561\n00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:26.490\n>> I know.\n>> It's pretty impressive.\n\n562\n00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:29.470\nNow there is one more way I wanna show you\nthat we can install Windows that they will\n\n563\n00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:33.470\nask you about on the exam, and\nthat's Windows Deployment Services.\n\n564\n00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:36.060\nWindows Deployment Services, or WDS for\n\n565\n00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:40.320\nshort, is another way to get\nserver installed on machines.\n\n566\n00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.970\nAnd it's a relatively automated process.\n\n567\n00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:45.570\nIt takes a little more\nconfiguration to get set up.\n\n568\n00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:46.650\nI've got a diagram here so\n\n569\n00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:50.300\nI can try to explain to you\nguys how this is gonna work.\n\n570\n00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:54.330\nWhat we're gonna do, we're gonna install\nWindows Deployment Services on a server.\n\n571\n00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:57.220\nSo this is my WDS server,\nmy deployment server,\n\n572\n00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:01.120\nand what we're gonna do is we're gonna\ncreate what we call a reference machine.\n\n573\n00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:05.115\nAnd that's simply a machine that\nI've installed 2008 R2 on, and\n\n574\n00:29:05.115 --> 00:29:07.525\nI've done some basic configuration to it.\n\n575\n00:29:07.525 --> 00:29:11.995\nI've got the operating system installed,\nmaybe given it a generic name.\n\n576\n00:29:11.995 --> 00:29:16.370\nIf there's any applications, maybe,\nthat I wanna include on that.\n\n577\n00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:20.060\nThat all my servers are gonna need,\nwhatever I want to do.\n\n578\n00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:23.230\nThen we're going to CIS prep it,\n\n579\n00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:26.740\nwhich is a way that I can remove any\nuniquely identifying information.\n\n580\n00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:29.040\nBasically generify?\n\n581\n00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:29.955\nIs that a word?\n\n582\n00:29:29.955 --> 00:29:32.510\n>> [LAUGHS]\n>> We're gonna generalize the OS which\n\n583\n00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:35.330\nmeans strip out any unique GUI,\n\n584\n00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:40.110\nnumbers, that identify this machine,\nright, make it very neutral.\n\n585\n00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:43.140\nAnd then we're gonna copy,\nwe're gonna take a picture\n\n586\n00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:46.820\nof that machine's hard drive, we're\ngonna create an image of that machine,\n\n587\n00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:51.540\nand we're gonna load that image\nover here on my deployment server.\n\n588\n00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:56.170\nOnce I've got that image of that reference\nmachine loaded up on my deployment server,\n\n589\n00:29:56.170 --> 00:30:00.530\nI can simply go to a machine on my\nnetwork, connect it across the network to\n\n590\n00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:05.760\nthe deployment sever, pick that image,\nand deploy it out to this machine.\n\n591\n00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.070\nAnd then, I can walk over to the next\ndo one and do the same thing.\n\n592\n00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:10.360\nAnd walk over to the next one and\ndo the same thing.\n\n593\n00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:13.020\nAnd within the time that I\njust installed one server, but\n\n594\n00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:17.230\nhere on this show, I could have\nmultiple servers installed, right.\n\n595\n00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:20.440\nSo, you're just basically creating\nan image of that hard drive, and\n\n596\n00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.550\nthen you're applying\nthat image to these guys.\n\n597\n00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:28.002\nAnd as soon as one of these guys boots up,\nit will replace all that information that\n\n598\n00:30:28.002 --> 00:30:32.214\ngot stripped out before I created it,\nthat it will be unique to this machine.\n\n599\n00:30:32.214 --> 00:30:36.470\nThis guy will create his own GUI,\nthis guy will create his own GUI, right.\n\n600\n00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:41.288\nSo in a big environment, in an enterprise\nenvironment, when you're responsible for\n\n601\n00:30:41.288 --> 00:30:45.974\ndeploying many servers, or you need to be\nable to roll out new servers very quickly,\n\n602\n00:30:45.974 --> 00:30:48.090\nDeployment Services is the way to go.\n\n603\n00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:49.680\nAnd this is free.\n\n604\n00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.400\nThis is a role that I can install.\n\n605\n00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:55.590\nIf I have a Server 2008 R2 machine\non my network, I can install\n\n606\n00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:59.620\nDeployment Services, and I can set all\nthis up without any additional cost.\n\n607\n00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:04.000\nI mean I need the licensing,\nright, to go on these guys here.\n\n608\n00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.250\nBut as far as this goes, it's great.\n\n609\n00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:10.845\nThis guy doesn't even need an operating\nsystem, I can boot him up to the network\n\n610\n00:31:10.845 --> 00:31:15.180\nadapter using something called PXE boot,\nPre Executable Environment.\n\n611\n00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:17.480\nI can connect him to\nthat Deployment Server.\n\n612\n00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:22.430\nIf I have multiple, I might have several\nimages stored up on a Deployment Server.\n\n613\n00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:26.340\nHere's an image of a Server\n2008 R2 DHCP server.\n\n614\n00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:29.580\nHere's an image of a 2008 R2 DNS server.\n\n615\n00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:32.880\nWhen I go to connect this guy across\nthe network to my Deployment Server,\n\n616\n00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.160\nI can pick from a list.\n\n617\n00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:37.390\nWhich image do I wanna\ndeploy out to this machine?\n\n618\n00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:39.770\nFantastic, I love Deployment Services.\n\n619\n00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:42.360\nAnd this guy's finished already.\n\n620\n00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:44.006\nAll I gotta do is set up the password.\n\n621\n00:31:47.006 --> 00:31:50.720\nAnd I get to log in and there we go.\n\n622\n00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:55.040\nI now have a brand new 2008\nR2 server sitting here.\n\n623\n00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:55.910\n>> That's very awesome.\n\n624\n00:31:55.910 --> 00:32:01.040\nAs we saw, it's very, very simple, it\ndoesn't take a lot of crazy configuration.\n\n625\n00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:04.170\nYou don't need to be some\ncomputer genius to get\n\n626\n00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:06.060\nServer 2008 R2 installed on a machine.\n\n627\n00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:07.850\nIt's very, very simple.\n\n628\n00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:12.070\nYou pop your disc in, walk through\nthe questionnaire that they give you,\n\n629\n00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:13.240\ndo a little partitioning.\n\n630\n00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.250\nNothing to it.\n\n631\n00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:18.500\nAnd within just 15 minutes maybe\nyou should be up and running.\n\n632\n00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:21.940\nI do love that unattended answer file that\ndoes make our lives a whole lot easier.\n\n633\n00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:22.480\n>> It sure does.\n\n634\n00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:25.530\n>> All right Mikey, is there anything else\nwe need to discuss to these good people\n\n635\n00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:27.200\nabout this installation?\n\n636\n00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:32.080\n>> I will mention that with the Deployment\nServices, because you make that image\n\n637\n00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.990\ngeneric, you run it through,\nyou generalize it, and then put it up on\n\n638\n00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:38.800\nthe deployment server, and then push\nit out to as many servers as you need.\n\n639\n00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.720\nWhen they start up for the first time,\nthey've got to generate that information\n\n640\n00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:45.710\nthat got stripped out and they're going\nto go through that initial set up wizard.\n\n641\n00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:47.680\nYou can automate that as well.\n\n642\n00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:51.490\nYou can create an answer file for\nWDS deployment, and so\n\n643\n00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:53.830\nI don't even have to just sit there and\nwait for those guys to finish.\n\n644\n00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:56.950\nI can have an answer file, and\ncompletely automate that process as well.\n\n645\n00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:59.175\n>> Huge fan of automation,\nI love it, love it.\n\n646\n00:32:59.175 --> 00:33:00.030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n647\n00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:04.080\nwell hopefully you guys have gotten a good\ntaste of what is involved when you install\n\n648\n00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.670\nthe server software itself and\nhow to get that done.\n\n649\n00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:09.710\nWe're going to go ahead and sign off,\nand thank you for watching.\n\n650\n00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:10.980\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n651\n00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:11.960\n>> And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n652\n00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.340\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n653\n00:33:14.340 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:20.391\nI'm your host Daniel Lowry, here with me\ntoday is none other than Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:20.391 --> 00:00:21.420\nHow's it going today Mikey?\n\n5\n00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.576\n>> Oh, it's going great Daniel.\n\n6\n00:00:22.576 --> 00:00:27.315\nI am excited because we've got more of our\nMTA Windows server fundamentals coming\n\n7\n00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:27.940\nyour way.\n\n8\n00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.102\nWindows server administration\nfundamentals, nice long title for\n\n9\n00:00:31.102 --> 00:00:31.605\nthat one.\n\n10\n00:00:31.605 --> 00:00:35.620\nAnd we're actually continuing on\nwith our installation options.\n\n11\n00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.815\nSo we got a few more things\nthat we weren't able to squeeze\n\n12\n00:00:37.815 --> 00:00:39.030\ninto that previous episode.\n\n13\n00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.546\nIf you missed it,\nmake sure you go back and watch it.\n\n14\n00:00:41.546 --> 00:00:43.670\nWe're continuing on here.\n\n15\n00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.675\nAnd Daniel, the next thing to call out\non our objectives is the F8 options.\n\n16\n00:00:48.675 --> 00:00:51.688\n>> It's a good question right there, Mike.\n\n17\n00:00:51.688 --> 00:00:54.807\nYou notice he didn't ask a question,\nbut I said, that's a good question?\n\n18\n00:00:54.807 --> 00:00:58.656\nThat's because it's very odd to us that\nthis would be part of the installation\n\n19\n00:00:58.656 --> 00:00:59.560\noptions.\n\n20\n00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.400\nNormally this is something that you\nwould do for troubleshooting, but\n\n21\n00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.450\nthey put it here so we're gonna\ncall it out here for you as well.\n\n22\n00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.750\nF8 options Mike, like I said,\nnormally used for troubleshooting.\n\n23\n00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.790\nCan you think of any reason that we\nmight use them for installation?\n\n24\n00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.165\n>> I don't even think they're\navailable before the install but\n\n25\n00:01:15.165 --> 00:01:16.863\nI mean maybe I'm wrong, never tried that.\n\n26\n00:01:16.863 --> 00:01:18.821\nBut, I don't think they are.\n\n27\n00:01:18.821 --> 00:01:23.308\nBut regardless, it's gonna be on the exam,\nor it could be a question on the exam so\n\n28\n00:01:23.308 --> 00:01:25.073\nwe're gonna cover it, right.\n\n29\n00:01:25.073 --> 00:01:27.638\nWhere maybe they just couldn't\nfigure out where else to put it, and\n\n30\n00:01:27.638 --> 00:01:28.859\nthis is where it ended up going.\n\n31\n00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:31.980\nSo F8, you might have done this\non your own machine at home.\n\n32\n00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.220\nIt's also available in server.\n\n33\n00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.766\nIt how we get into our advanced boot\noptions, is basically what it is.\n\n34\n00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:40.492\nI'm gonna try to do it\nhere on this server.\n\n35\n00:01:40.492 --> 00:01:45.084\nWe are virtualizing these machines and\nsometimes in a virtual environment,\n\n36\n00:01:45.084 --> 00:01:48.343\nit can be really tricky because\nthey boot so darn fast.\n\n37\n00:01:48.343 --> 00:01:49.655\nBut, I'll go ahead and show you here.\n\n38\n00:01:49.655 --> 00:01:54.326\nSo, basically, what you would do is, you\nwould reboot your server and during that\n\n39\n00:01:54.326 --> 00:01:58.466\nreboot, during that post process\nbefore the operating system kicks in,\n\n40\n00:01:58.466 --> 00:02:01.289\nyou're going to be hitting\nF8 on your keyboard.\n\n41\n00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:04.230\nAnd that should bring you to\nyour advanced boot options.\n\n42\n00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.980\nIt means I don't want Windows to\nboot normally because, most likely,\n\n43\n00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.810\nsomething is going wrong.\n\n44\n00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:11.720\nSo let's try it here.\n\n45\n00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.860\nI'm gonna go ahead and restart this guy.\n\n46\n00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.010\nI'll just go to my Start menu and\nchoose Restart.\n\n47\n00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.162\nAnd I'll give it a reason,\na very descriptive reason there.\n\n48\n00:02:21.162 --> 00:02:22.088\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n49\n00:02:22.088 --> 00:02:25.350\nI'm getting my finger ready\non the F8 button right now.\n\n50\n00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.165\nSo as soon as that thing starts going\nblack, I'm hitting F8, and we'll see.\n\n51\n00:02:29.165 --> 00:02:32.950\nNow if you see the Windows bar load up\nlike that, that means you missed it.\n\n52\n00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.046\nAnd you must wait for Windows to finish\nbooting, and then you can try it again.\n\n53\n00:02:37.046 --> 00:02:40.140\n>> Now, Mike, I'm sure you did that for\npurely demonstration purposes.\n\n54\n00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.580\nNot that it was just too quick for you.\n\n55\n00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.370\n>> [LAUGH] Exactly yes.\n\n56\n00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.137\n>> Even if they're the speed of a mongoose\nand the reflexes of a cat I'm sure.\n\n57\n00:02:46.137 --> 00:02:47.377\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah exactly,\n\n58\n00:02:47.377 --> 00:02:52.052\nthat's what I'm gonna say, that's my\nstory now and I'm sticking to it, right?\n\n59\n00:02:52.052 --> 00:02:56.112\nSo here we go and fortunately on server\nyou can't restart it from the log on\n\n60\n00:02:56.112 --> 00:02:59.190\nscreen otherwise somebody\ncould walk by your server and\n\n61\n00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.350\njust hit the client down at\nthe bottom right hand corner.\n\n62\n00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.409\nYou can restart it right from\nthe log on screen on server, not so.\n\n63\n00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.543\nI don't want anybody to\nbe able to walk by and\n\n64\n00:03:08.543 --> 00:03:10.690\nreboot my server without authenticating.\n\n65\n00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.977\nSo I know who it is that\ndecided to reboot my server.\n\n66\n00:03:13.977 --> 00:03:15.290\nSo we'll try this one more time.\n\n67\n00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.317\nI'll go over here and\nI'll choose Restart and\n\n68\n00:03:19.317 --> 00:03:23.870\nagain I'll get my fingers\nready on that F8 button.\n\n69\n00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.770\nWho knows, maybe I pushed F7 by mistake\nI might've fat fingered that guy.\n\n70\n00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.210\nI'm pushing it up there we go.\n\n71\n00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.645\nI will tell you what I do personally.\n\n72\n00:03:31.645 --> 00:03:34.740\nAs soon as that screen goes black,\nI just start tapping it.\n\n73\n00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.559\nYou don't wanna do it like [SOUND] cuz\nthen you'll actually get a keyboard\n\n74\n00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:39.445\nfailure error.\n\n75\n00:03:39.445 --> 00:03:42.578\nBut you do wanna go tap,\ntap, tap, tap, tap, tap,\n\n76\n00:03:42.578 --> 00:03:47.120\nuntil it either gives you the Windows\nlogon screen or you come to this.\n\n77\n00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.750\nAnd this is what we were shooting for,\nso here we go.\n\n78\n00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.420\nHere's our advanced boot options for\nserver 2008 R2.\n\n79\n00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.340\nI can launch into repair mode.\n\n80\n00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.680\nThis would allow me try to\nrepair the installation.\n\n81\n00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.059\nMaybe that's why this falls under\nserver installation as a possibility.\n\n82\n00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:05.960\nYou basically start this.\n\n83\n00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.332\nYou would hit, if I choose restart.\n\n84\n00:04:08.332 --> 00:04:09.686\nI should've gone through\nthe rest of the menu.\n\n85\n00:04:09.686 --> 00:04:12.980\nNow I'm going to have to\nhit that thing again.\n\n86\n00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.242\nBut this is gonna bring you,\n\n87\n00:04:14.242 --> 00:04:17.302\nit's gonna look like it's installing\nthe operating system again.\n\n88\n00:04:17.302 --> 00:04:20.130\nAnd it does freak some\npeople out sometimes.\n\n89\n00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.710\nThey panic, they go hey,\nI didn't want to reinstall.\n\n90\n00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.635\nAnd there was nothing,\nI just wanted to fix,\n\n91\n00:04:24.635 --> 00:04:26.470\nI was having trouble booting the machine.\n\n92\n00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.330\nI got some start up files\nthat need to be replaced.\n\n93\n00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.300\nDon't worry, it's not actually gonna\nreinstall the operating system.\n\n94\n00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.700\nHere's my recovery options.\n\n95\n00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.621\nI can click next on that, and\nI would authenticate with my local admin,\n\n96\n00:04:39.621 --> 00:04:41.353\nusername and password.\n\n97\n00:04:41.353 --> 00:04:44.530\nAnd here I can get into\nmy System Image Recovery.\n\n98\n00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.090\nSo if I had a system image that\nI had created ahead of time,\n\n99\n00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.220\nright, I could try to restore that.\n\n100\n00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.100\nI can also launch my\nWindows Memory Diagnostics, or\n\n101\n00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.939\nI could go into a Command Prompt.\n\n102\n00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:58.565\nAnd maybe I've got some command\nline utilities that I wanna try\n\n103\n00:04:58.565 --> 00:05:00.010\nto run to fix the system.\n\n104\n00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.759\nLike, I don't know,\nmaybe I'm doing some scan disk, or\n\n105\n00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:07.058\nsome other type of commands\nthat I might try to run.\n\n106\n00:05:07.058 --> 00:05:10.734\nI'm just gonna go ahead and choose restart\ncuz there's nothing wrong with this, and\n\n107\n00:05:10.734 --> 00:05:14.060\nI wanna show you the rest of\nthe options on that advanced boot menu.\n\n108\n00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.066\nSo we're gonna try it one more time,\nlet's see how my reflexes are.\n\n109\n00:05:17.066 --> 00:05:21.199\nWhat you do is restart,\nI'll do my F8 and there we go.\n\n110\n00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.481\nAll right, Safe Mode.\n\n111\n00:05:22.481 --> 00:05:23.988\nThere's a whole bunch of options here,\n\n112\n00:05:23.988 --> 00:05:27.050\nthere's really a few of them that\nyou need to be familiar with.\n\n113\n00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.813\nSafe Mode is one of them, right?\n\n114\n00:05:29.813 --> 00:05:31.510\nSafe Mode is an important one.\n\n115\n00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.640\nTypically if my system\nwon't boot properly,\n\n116\n00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.560\nin other words, I start up this server and\nit goes into a boot loop.\n\n117\n00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.812\nOr it boots up and it blue screens, and\nthen it restarts and it blue screens.\n\n118\n00:05:43.812 --> 00:05:45.350\nHow do I fix that system?\n\n119\n00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.010\nI need to get it up and running so\n\n120\n00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.590\nI can try to get in there and fix it,\nSafe Mode is what I'm gonna use.\n\n121\n00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:57.440\nSafe Mode basically loads only known\ngood drivers from the driver store.\n\n122\n00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.506\nUsually when we have a blue screen or\nsomething, a good majority of the time,\n\n123\n00:06:01.506 --> 00:06:03.509\nis because I've done something bad,\n\n124\n00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:08.130\nI've installed a driver that's not\ncompatible and it's causing a problem.\n\n125\n00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:11.942\nSafe Mode, but there's other reasons\nthat you can end up blue screening,\n\n126\n00:06:11.942 --> 00:06:18.120\nSafe Mode allows me to get into that\nsystem by just loading known good drivers.\n\n127\n00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.720\nAnd let's take a peek at Safe Mode,\nit does look a little bit different.\n\n128\n00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.114\nYou can see all the drivers\nthat it's loading up,\n\n129\n00:06:25.114 --> 00:06:27.002\nnone of your custom drivers will load.\n\n130\n00:06:27.002 --> 00:06:33.490\nLike if you had any video drivers,\nsoundcard drivers or anything like that.\n\n131\n00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.920\nAnd so, it's a good troubleshooting tip.\n\n132\n00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:40.702\nIf I can't boot the system normally,\nbut I can boot the system in Safe Mode,\n\n133\n00:06:40.702 --> 00:06:45.338\nthere's a good bet that the problem\nlies with something in the registry of\n\n134\n00:06:45.338 --> 00:06:46.708\nthe driver, right?\n\n135\n00:06:46.708 --> 00:06:48.370\nAnd here's good old Safe Mode.\n\n136\n00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:53.656\nYou can see it's very low resolution,\n800 by 600, something like that.\n\n137\n00:06:53.656 --> 00:06:56.910\nIt's got Safe Mode in\nthe corner of all these guys,\n\n138\n00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.440\nletting me know that I'm in Safe Mode.\n\n139\n00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.220\nBut, now I can at least function, and I\ncan try to go do a driver rollback, right.\n\n140\n00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.961\nWe've seen that in another episode where\nnow I can get into device manager, and\n\n141\n00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:13.023\nI could go roll back a driver that\nI thought was causing the problem.\n\n142\n00:07:13.023 --> 00:07:14.820\nSo Safe Mode is handy.\n\n143\n00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:19.052\nSafe Mode has no network access,\nall right.\n\n144\n00:07:19.052 --> 00:07:19.923\nYou get a GUI but\n\n145\n00:07:19.923 --> 00:07:24.860\nyour machine is basically at this point\nisolated from the rest of the network.\n\n146\n00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.370\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nrestart this one more time.\n\n147\n00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.563\nAnd get ready for my good old F8 options.\n\n148\n00:07:36.209 --> 00:07:37.000\nAll right?\n\n149\n00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.160\nIf I need network access,\n\n150\n00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.050\nmaybe the tool I wanna use to troubleshoot\nthis machine is located on the network.\n\n151\n00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.610\nOr I wanna copy some files down to it,\nanother copy of some startup files,\n\n152\n00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.720\nor something like that, that are located\nup on a store in the network.\n\n153\n00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.640\nI can do Safe Mode with Networking.\n\n154\n00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.303\nIf I don't need that GUI, if I think part\nof the problem lies with loading up file\n\n155\n00:07:55.303 --> 00:07:59.316\nexplorer, you know Windows Explorer, what\ngives me that graphical user interface.\n\n156\n00:07:59.316 --> 00:08:01.442\nI can go Safe Mode with Command Prompt,\nand\n\n157\n00:08:01.442 --> 00:08:05.418\nall I would get was a command prompt,\nno task bar, no start menu, none of that.\n\n158\n00:08:05.418 --> 00:08:09.932\nI can do boot logging if I think the\nproblem lies with the driver figure it out\n\n159\n00:08:09.932 --> 00:08:14.733\nwhat driver it is I can do boot logging\nwhich all show me everything has happening\n\n160\n00:08:14.733 --> 00:08:19.032\nduring that boot process there's\na video driver I can do low res video,\n\n161\n00:08:19.032 --> 00:08:23.810\nlast known good It is an option we've\ntalked about in a previous episode.\n\n162\n00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.430\nThis again goes to the registry.\n\n163\n00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:30.650\nIn your registry you have what we call\ncontrol sets, and these control sets\n\n164\n00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:35.360\ndetermine what drivers and services\nare loaded up when that system starts.\n\n165\n00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.540\nAnd once the system boots up, and\n\n166\n00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:42.150\nyou log on to the system,\nit says hey, that boot worked.\n\n167\n00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:44.970\nEverything I did, the drivers I loaded,\nthe services I started,\n\n168\n00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:49.420\neverything else all worked because the\nuser just logged on and got to a desktop.\n\n169\n00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:50.220\nSo I'm gonna mark that.\n\n170\n00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.790\nI'm gonna say this is a good control set.\n\n171\n00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.200\nRight?\nAnd it flags it.\n\n172\n00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.390\nIf we make changes,\nit creates a new control.\n\n173\n00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.040\nIt says hey, this person just\ninstalled a new driver, so\n\n174\n00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:04.050\nthe next time I boot,\nI've got to load up this driver as well.\n\n175\n00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:06.970\nBut it saves that known, good control set.\n\n176\n00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:11.210\nAnd if that driver gives me a problem,\nthe one I just installed,\n\n177\n00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:14.590\nI can now go back and say you know\nwhat use the configuration set,\n\n178\n00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:17.760\nthe control set that allowed\nme to log in the last time.\n\n179\n00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.545\nBecause I know that one worked.\n\n180\n00:09:19.545 --> 00:09:22.795\nSo it's basically a way to\nroll back all your drivers and\n\n181\n00:09:22.795 --> 00:09:26.635\nsettings in the registry to\nthe last time somebody logged on.\n\n182\n00:09:26.635 --> 00:09:28.545\nKey point there to remember.\n\n183\n00:09:28.545 --> 00:09:36.017\nThe last known good, is only marked when\nsomebody actually logs onto the system.\n\n184\n00:09:36.017 --> 00:09:40.507\nThat's when it flags that control\nset as a known good control set.\n\n185\n00:09:40.507 --> 00:09:44.307\nDSR error, directory service restore mood,\nthis is for domain controllers.\n\n186\n00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.290\nDomain controllers are special machines\nin our network that are responsible for\n\n187\n00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:52.980\nsecurity and\nthe authentication process on our network.\n\n188\n00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:58.030\nWhen we create a domain controller,\nwe lose access to the local SAN file.\n\n189\n00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:00.700\nIn other words,\nyou can't log on with a local account,\n\n190\n00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:04.950\nyou can only log on to domain\ncontrollers with domain based accounts.\n\n191\n00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.940\nBut what if I'm trying to\ntroubleshoot that machine?\n\n192\n00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.080\nIf I'm trying to go\ninto Safe Mode with it,\n\n193\n00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:13.330\nI really can't, because I don't\nhave a local admin account anymore.\n\n194\n00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:16.280\nAnd Active Directory isn't booting\nup because the server's broken, so\n\n195\n00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.300\nI can't log on with the domain account.\n\n196\n00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.970\nThis is like Safe Mode for\ndomain controllers.\n\n197\n00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:24.830\nIt gives me the ability to log on, even\nthough Active Directory won't load up.\n\n198\n00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:27.270\nAnd I can fix problems\nin Active Directory.\n\n199\n00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:31.650\nThere's debugging mode, which is a very\ndetailed logging, that let's me, outputs\n\n200\n00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:36.490\na lot of information about what's going\non, so I can send that to Microsoft and\n\n201\n00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:40.240\nlet them analyze it, and see if they can\nfigure out what's going on with my server.\n\n202\n00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.420\nThere's the disable automatic\nrestart on system failure.\n\n203\n00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.560\nThis can help you prevent\nsome of those boot loops,\n\n204\n00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.435\nor some of those restart\nloops we can get in to.\n\n205\n00:10:48.435 --> 00:10:52.750\nIf something's wrong, it boots up, it blue\nscreens, it boots up, it blue screens,\n\n206\n00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.590\nit boots up, and\nthat can be really hard on our hardware.\n\n207\n00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:57.050\nSo we can disable that.\n\n208\n00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:59.540\nAnd something else we talked\nabout in another episode was,\n\n209\n00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.550\ndisable driver signing or\ndriver signature enforcement.\n\n210\n00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:07.710\nIf I need to install a driver and\nit does not have a signature, remember,\n\n211\n00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:12.030\n2008 R2 requires these drivers be\nsigned by a trusted certificate.\n\n212\n00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:16.610\nIf I've got a driver that's not signed,\nI can't sign it myself.\n\n213\n00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.450\nBut I trust the driver and\nI want to install it anyway,\n\n214\n00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:24.200\nI can temporarily disable that\nsignature enforcement right here.\n\n215\n00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:28.200\nIt will boot up, I can install the driver,\nthen I can reboot normally and\n\n216\n00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.990\nwe're good to go.\n\n217\n00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.950\nThen if I accidentally hit F8,\nor I decide, you know what,\n\n218\n00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:35.485\nI don't like any of those options,\nI'll let somebody else work on this.\n\n219\n00:11:35.485 --> 00:11:37.210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I can just say start Windows normally,\n\n220\n00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:40.500\nand walk away, and then let Daniel\ncome and find the server and\n\n221\n00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.750\ngo, oh, what's wrong with this?\n\n222\n00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:42.780\nI'll let him troubleshoot shit.\n\n223\n00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.671\n>> Mike calls that\nthe Daniel's problem option.\n\n224\n00:11:45.671 --> 00:11:46.757\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n225\n00:11:46.757 --> 00:11:51.520\nAnd that's a good one to do, if we\nhave anyone, no, I shouldn't say that.\n\n226\n00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.720\n>> Now, Mike we're taking a look at all\nthese F8 options obviously they have their\n\n227\n00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.910\nplace and we need to use them,\nwe need to understand them and\n\n228\n00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:01.220\nhow we can implement them especially\nin a troubleshooting that's\n\n229\n00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:05.560\nusually where we're gonna jump on that\nF8 key when we're rebooting a server.\n\n230\n00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.470\nBut there's also a couple of\nthings we need to know about\n\n231\n00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.810\nsome types of server installations, right?\n\n232\n00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:15.050\n>> Yes, absolutely when we mention I think\nin part 1 of here, we were talking about\n\n233\n00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:20.950\nthe different additions of server and\nI mentioned something called server core.\n\n234\n00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:25.920\nWhen you go to install server 2008 r2,\nyou've got the choice of either installing\n\n235\n00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:30.350\nwhat we call the full installation or\na core installation.\n\n236\n00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:36.390\nAnd basically Microsoft saw a need for\na stripped down version of the Windows\n\n237\n00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:40.590\noperating system, of the 2000 NR2s server\noperating system and that's what they did.\n\n238\n00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:44.880\nThey stripped out all of\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n239\n00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.870\nWe're left with just the core.\n\n240\n00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:51.100\nAnd the reason, there's a few\nreasons that they did this, and\n\n241\n00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.020\nwhy people like the core version.\n\n242\n00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:57.930\nOne is without the GUI, without all\nthose graphical user interfaces,\n\n243\n00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:01.935\nwhen I say GUI, graphical user interface,\nI'm talking about like the desktop,\n\n244\n00:13:01.935 --> 00:13:06.680\nyour start menu, the task bar, all those\nadministrative tools, the wizards and\n\n245\n00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.630\nthings like that I can click on.\n\n246\n00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:11.990\nThose take a lot of resources and\ngraphical power to run and\n\n247\n00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:15.000\nthat's where a lot of my\nvulnerabilities come in.\n\n248\n00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.020\nA lot of security patches are patching\nthings in that graphical user interface.\n\n249\n00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:23.440\nAnd if I remove all that I don't\nhave those to worry about anymore.\n\n250\n00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:28.880\nI can eliminate some of those security\nvulnerabilities by doing server core.\n\n251\n00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.530\nThe other thing is resource utilization.\n\n252\n00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:34.080\nWithout all that other extra\nstuff to draw on the screen\n\n253\n00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.680\nit uses a whole lot less resources.\n\n254\n00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.960\nI'm talking about CPU and RAM primarily.\n\n255\n00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:45.080\nAnd if I'm virtualizing my environment,\nI've got a physical machine, that has so\n\n256\n00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.010\nmany resources, right?\n\n257\n00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:51.190\nIt's got so much CPU, it's got so much\nmemory, and I've gotta divide that up and\n\n258\n00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:55.220\nshare it among all the virtual machines\nthat I'm going to be creating.\n\n259\n00:13:55.220 --> 00:14:00.390\nIf that virtual machine Is using\nless resources, it doesn't need as\n\n260\n00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:05.560\nbig of a slice of resources, I can\ncreate more virtual machines on that.\n\n261\n00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:10.160\nAnd so it makes sense,\nwe can use this core installation and\n\n262\n00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.800\nbe a little more secure and\nuse a whole lot less resources.\n\n263\n00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.550\nSo let me show you.\n\n264\n00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:17.300\nThis is server core, all right?\n\n265\n00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.260\nAs you can see, there's not a lot here.\n\n266\n00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:20.530\nIt's just a command prompt.\n\n267\n00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:22.430\nAnd that's all I get.\n\n268\n00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:28.730\nThere are a couple of GUIs left in here,\nlike task manager's still there.\n\n269\n00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:33.460\nAnd a couple others, but\nthey're none of my normal tools.\n\n270\n00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:34.670\nAll right?\n\n271\n00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:37.520\nAnd the first thing I wanna\nshow you about core is,\n\n272\n00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.110\nhow to get back to this window right here.\n\n273\n00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:42.070\nBecause they never talk about it in any\nof the Microsoft documentation, and\n\n274\n00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:44.040\nI think it's a good thing to know.\n\n275\n00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.160\nBecause, I don't know about you Daniel,\n\n276\n00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.310\nwhen I'm done with the command prompt,\nI typically just type exit and hit enter.\n\n277\n00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:50.230\nAnd I close it, right?\n\n278\n00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:52.250\nI go about my business on my server.\n\n279\n00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:56.910\nThe problem is, with Core,\nthat's the only interface I get.\n\n280\n00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:57.800\nAnd, now what do I do?\n\n281\n00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.690\nI'm looking at this blue screen.\n\n282\n00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:01.670\nI can't.\nI'm trying to right click right now.\n\n283\n00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:03.160\n>> We are undone Michael.\n\n284\n00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.695\nWhat will we do?\n\n285\n00:15:04.695 --> 00:15:06.553\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] There's no right click,\n\n286\n00:15:06.553 --> 00:15:10.100\nthere's no start menu to go to,\nthere's no hidden taskbar down here.\n\n287\n00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:11.690\nThere's nothing, all right.\n\n288\n00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:13.630\nSo, if you ever get into this situation,\n\n289\n00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:17.190\none solution would be to hard\nreboot the server, right?\n\n290\n00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:20.325\nBut in a production environment,\nthat's probably not a good choice.\n\n291\n00:15:20.325 --> 00:15:22.480\n>> Yeah, the boss is probably\ngonna have a few words for\n\n292\n00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:26.160\nyou, going, why are you rebooting\nthe server like six times a day?\n\n293\n00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.390\nWell I accidentally closed command prompt.\n\n294\n00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:29.722\nYeah, let's go to HR for a little bit\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n295\n00:15:29.722 --> 00:15:30.779\n>> You and I have to talk.\n\n296\n00:15:30.779 --> 00:15:32.580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n297\n00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.710\ninstead of pulling the plug on the server\nor holding the power button down, or\n\n298\n00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:38.900\nanything like that, what you're gonna do\nis you're gonna act like you're logging\n\n299\n00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:43.860\noff, all I did was my control, alt, delete\nkeystroke combination on my keyboard and\n\n300\n00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.640\nit brings up this screen here.\n\n301\n00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.970\nAnd I can launch Task Manager from here.\n\n302\n00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:51.950\nAnd I can go up here and choose New Task.\n\n303\n00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:54.344\nAnd I can do cmd.exe.\n\n304\n00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.790\nAnd then I can close task manager.\n\n305\n00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:58.670\nAnd there we go.\n\n306\n00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:00.300\nI've got my command prompt back.\n\n307\n00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:00.890\nAll right?\n\n308\n00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:03.300\nSo that is Server Core.\n\n309\n00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.473\nYour first look at Server Core.\n\n310\n00:16:05.473 --> 00:16:10.668\nNow, it's intimidating, is what I'd like\nto say, cuz it's not that it's difficult.\n\n311\n00:16:10.668 --> 00:16:13.330\nBut it can be intimidating\nworking with Server Core.\n\n312\n00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:17.440\nBecause if I install this,\nthis is all I get.\n\n313\n00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.130\nHow do I change the name of this computer?\n\n314\n00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:20.390\nHow do I join it to the domain?\n\n315\n00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:22.570\nHow do I set my TCP/IP settings?\n\n316\n00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:24.440\nHow do I install rolls?\n\n317\n00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.380\nWhat the heck am I supposed to do with it?\n\n318\n00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:27.996\n>> There's no training wheels on this.\n\n319\n00:16:27.996 --> 00:16:28.873\n>> There's none right.\n\n320\n00:16:28.873 --> 00:16:29.704\n>> None at all, yeah.\n\n321\n00:16:29.704 --> 00:16:32.120\n>> [LAUGH] But\nthere is a really cool thing we can do.\n\n322\n00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.800\nIt's called server configurator,\nactually that's what I call it.\n\n323\n00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.860\nS config is what I'm gonna type\nin here at the command prompt.\n\n324\n00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.000\nAnd it loads up this really cool utility.\n\n325\n00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.820\nAnd it's basically a menu driven\nsystem from the command prompt.\n\n326\n00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:50.040\nAnd I can see here I've got options\nlike domain workgroup is number one,\n\n327\n00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.450\nnumber two is computer name.\n\n328\n00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:55.330\nThere's others for network settings,\ndate and time, and things like that.\n\n329\n00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.450\nAnd this is how I do my\ninitial configuration.\n\n330\n00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:03.500\nBecause in the end, Server Core is\ngonna be managed remotely, most likely.\n\n331\n00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.110\nWhat's really cool about Server and\nmanaging this,\n\n332\n00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:12.710\nis I can go to another machine that has\na GUI and I can remotely manage this core.\n\n333\n00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:15.060\nI don't have to be on this\nmachine to manage it.\n\n334\n00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:19.520\nSo I go to another machine that does\nhave those nice clickable wizards and\n\n335\n00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:24.080\nadministrative interfaces and I can just\npoint those administrative interfaces\n\n336\n00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:28.330\nto the install of Server Core and\nmanage it remotely, all right.\n\n337\n00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:31.040\nIn fact,\nthe recommended way to manage these\n\n338\n00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.660\nis from your client operating system.\n\n339\n00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:35.040\nYou're gonna be sitting on\nyour Windows 7 machine, and\n\n340\n00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.160\nyou're gonna install the remote\nserver administration tools,\n\n341\n00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.460\nwhich we're gonna talk all\nabout in another episode.\n\n342\n00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:43.330\nAnd that gives you all those same\nadministration tools you would normally\n\n343\n00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:44.760\nfind on a server.\n\n344\n00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.990\nAnd I can sit at my cubicle, with my\nlittle laptop running Windows 7 and\n\n345\n00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:50.130\nI can remotely manage these guys.\n\n346\n00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:55.290\nBut I can't do that until I get\nthe initial setup done, right?\n\n347\n00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:58.120\nI can't remotely manage it,\nif it doesn't have an IP address.\n\n348\n00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:01.670\nAnd I can't remotely manage\nit if it's not set up.\n\n349\n00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:05.700\nThe firewall has to be enabled to allow\nthat remote management to come in.\n\n350\n00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:07.810\nI need to join it to my domain.\n\n351\n00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:09.860\nI need to change the name of the computer,\nright?\n\n352\n00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.670\nSo there are some things\nI have to do locally and\n\n353\n00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:14.880\nthat's where this server\nconfiguration comes in.\n\n354\n00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.800\nIt gives me the ability, you can see\nI've already gone through it, so\n\n355\n00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.570\nI can show you Server Core here, but\nI can show a couple of these options.\n\n356\n00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:25.710\nAnd if I want to change my date and\ntime, I hit number nine and hit enter.\n\n357\n00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:29.060\nAnd this is one of the few little\nwizard that still pops up.\n\n358\n00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:32.750\nI can change my time zone or\nI can change my time if I want to.\n\n359\n00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:34.935\nIf I want to change\nthe name of the computer,\n\n360\n00:18:34.935 --> 00:18:37.460\nI hit and\nyou see it is number two in the list.\n\n361\n00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:41.950\nSo number two and enter and it says\nright here, what are you going to rename\n\n362\n00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:46.590\nthe computer to and I'm going to cancel as\nit says blank for cancel and I hit enter.\n\n363\n00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:48.920\nAnother one I haven't done yet,\nbecause I wanted to show you guys,\n\n364\n00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:53.080\nwas configure remote management.\n\n365\n00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.100\nRight?\nI've already joined it to the domain,\n\n366\n00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:58.120\nI've already set the TCPIP settings.\n\n367\n00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.610\nLet me show you the TCPIP settings though,\n\n368\n00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:01.750\nbecause there's a little\ntwist to that one.\n\n369\n00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:06.260\nIf I do number eight, that's my\nnetwork settings and then I hit enter.\n\n370\n00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:10.290\nIt gives me this little menu and you\nmight have more than one network adapter\n\n371\n00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:15.420\nin that machine, in fact very common in a\nserver to have multiple network adapters.\n\n372\n00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.160\nYou've got to tell it which\none you want to work with.\n\n373\n00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.390\nIt will list them all here and\nit will give you an index number.\n\n374\n00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:23.270\nSo if I want to work with this\nparticular network adapter I hit\n\n375\n00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:26.098\nthe number 0 and hit enter.\n\n376\n00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:28.410\nAnd there it shows you\nthe current configuration, and\n\n377\n00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:31.240\nif I want to change the network address,\nI just use number one.\n\n378\n00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.640\nIts got this little mini menu here.\n\n379\n00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.310\nAnd the one caviot I want to, I want to,\nmention, I'm gonna change it and\n\n380\n00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:39.840\njust set it to the same so,\njust to show you.\n\n381\n00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.370\nSo if I do a number one.\n\n382\n00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:48.483\nNetwork adapter IP address, I'll hit enter\nand I'm gonna do a static IP address and\n\n383\n00:19:48.483 --> 00:19:53.192\nit's gonna be 10.1.1.221 and\nI hit enter and\n\n384\n00:19:53.192 --> 00:19:59.428\nthen it wants to know what my sub\nnet mask ask is, 255 255 255 0.\n\n385\n00:19:59.428 --> 00:20:02.309\nOops .0 would be better.\n\n386\n00:20:02.309 --> 00:20:08.825\nAnd in my default gateway,\n10.1.1.2 and I hit Enter.\n\n387\n00:20:08.825 --> 00:20:11.251\nNow, you might think okay, I'm done.\n\n388\n00:20:11.251 --> 00:20:13.560\nBut I didn't set any DNS settings, right?\n\n389\n00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.900\nWhen you're in the GUI interface and\nyou pull up the TCP/IP properties for\n\n390\n00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.650\nyour network adapter,\nIt's all on one little window there.\n\n391\n00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:23.770\nYou've got IP address subnet mass,\ndefault gateway, preferred DNS server,\n\n392\n00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:27.550\nalternate DNS server, all right there\nin the one thing so you don't forget.\n\n393\n00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:30.430\nWhen I went this way it never\nasked me anything about DNS.\n\n394\n00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:32.380\nIf I don't have DNS set.\n\n395\n00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:36.070\nIf I go to try to join this computer to\nthe domain, it won't be able to resolve\n\n396\n00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:38.590\nthe name of the domain controller and\nI won't be able to.\n\n397\n00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:40.760\nSo, you've got to set your DNS settings.\n\n398\n00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:45.320\nIt's a separate option, number two,\nset DNS server address, and\n\n399\n00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:49.680\nthen I can tell it 10.1.1,\n200, in my case.\n\n400\n00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.560\nAnd I say okay.\n\n401\n00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:56.130\nIt's strange that this one option actually\nhas a little message box that pops up.\n\n402\n00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:59.370\nAnd then if I have an alternate DNS,\nI don't, I'm gonna do blank for\n\n403\n00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:00.660\nnone, and I'm good to go.\n\n404\n00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.660\nAnd now all of my TCP/IP settings are set,\nand\n\n405\n00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:07.360\nthen it's a number four to return\nback out to the main menu.\n\n406\n00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:13.660\nAll right, and the other one I want to\nshow you here is the, where did we go.\n\n407\n00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:16.060\nConfigure remote management,\nso that's number four.\n\n408\n00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:19.950\nYou know what, before I do that,\nlet's do this.\n\n409\n00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:23.440\nIf I was gonna manage this guy remotely,\nwhat I would do\n\n410\n00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.900\nis go to a machine that has the GUI\ninterface on it, and open up that tool.\n\n411\n00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:32.800\nLike let's say, let's just use server\nmanager since it's right here.\n\n412\n00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:38.710\nWhat I can do is I can click on this, and\nI can say connect to another computer.\n\n413\n00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:47.000\nAnd I can say I want to\nconnect to core01.lab.net,\n\n414\n00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.660\nand it's gonna attempt to connect,\nbut it's gonna fail.\n\n415\n00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.370\nBecause I haven't opened\nup the firewall yet.\n\n416\n00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:56.300\nI haven't allowed for\nthat remote administration.\n\n417\n00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:05.280\nSo while that's failing I can't really\ncancel it there's no, unless I do a maybe.\n\n418\n00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.630\nYeah no it won't let cancel that.\n\n419\n00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:09.750\nEventually what it's gonna say\nis I can't connect to core 01.\n\n420\n00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:12.020\nThere we go.\nCan't connect to core01.lab.net.\n\n421\n00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:13.890\nClick retry to connect again,\n\n422\n00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:16.680\nI look at my details,\nthey fail with the following error.\n\n423\n00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:20.990\nThe WinRM client can not complete\nthe operation, check your firewall,\n\n424\n00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:22.940\ncheck your network settings, right.\n\n425\n00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:24.670\nSo I'll click cancel.\n\n426\n00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:30.060\nI'll flip back over to core, and I'll do\noption number, again option number four.\n\n427\n00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.050\nI get this little mini menu, down here.\n\n428\n00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:33.380\nAnd what do I want to allow?\n\n429\n00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:35.970\nWell, I want to allow\nMMC remote management.\n\n430\n00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:39.190\nThat's those Microsoft\nmanagement consoles, right?\n\n431\n00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:40.710\nAnd I'll go ahead and hit enter.\n\n432\n00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:42.490\nAnd it's gonna enable the firewall.\n\n433\n00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:45.460\nIt's gonna make the exception\nin the firewall for me.\n\n434\n00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.200\nRight?\n\n435\n00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.900\nIf I want to do remote PowerShell,\nthat'd be a number two.\n\n436\n00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.090\nAllow server manager remote management,\nhey that's what I was just trying to do.\n\n437\n00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:55.770\nSo let's do that, a number three.\n\n438\n00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:56.590\nAll right?\n\n439\n00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:59.796\nAnd it tells me I've gotta do PowerShell\nfirst, so I'll enable PowerShell.\n\n440\n00:23:02.954 --> 00:23:07.320\nRight, and it's going to again create\nthose firewall exceptions for me.\n\n441\n00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.880\nAnd it's telling me that this\none's gonna have to reboot.\n\n442\n00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:14.210\nSo it's setting my\nPowerShell execution policy.\n\n443\n00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:18.040\nAnd then once this is done, I don't\nhave to log onto this machine anymore.\n\n444\n00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:22.570\nI can do all my management remotely,\nand I'm good to go, right?\n\n445\n00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:28.290\nSo I could have dozens of servers all\nrunning Core, using very little resources.\n\n446\n00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:31.200\nAnd I just sit back at my Windows\n7 box and remotely manage them.\n\n447\n00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:33.870\nI'll go ahead and reboot this guy.\n\n448\n00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:37.620\nAnd Server Core,\n2008 R2 reboots really fast.\n\n449\n00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.420\nServer Core, even faster.\n\n450\n00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.610\nExcept for now it's making\nsome configuration changes,\n\n451\n00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:44.810\nso it might take a little bit longer.\n\n452\n00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:49.460\nBut pretty darn quick when it\ncomes to the reboot process.\n\n453\n00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:53.700\n>> That's kind of one of the benefits\nof using Server Core is it is\n\n454\n00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.180\na stripped down drag racer, right?\n\n455\n00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:57.900\nIt is high speed, low drag.\n\n456\n00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.350\nIt is ready to rock and roll.\n\n457\n00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:02.424\nIt doesn't have a bunch of bells and\nwhistles on it to slow it down.\n\n458\n00:24:02.424 --> 00:24:05.470\nYou need speed,\nyou just need some management,\n\n459\n00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:10.538\nyou wanna stick a server somewhere that's\nnot gonna require a lot of resources.\n\n460\n00:24:10.538 --> 00:24:11.422\nThis is the way to go.\n\n461\n00:24:11.422 --> 00:24:15.750\nIt's a very, very nice feature\nthat they've added to the server.\n\n462\n00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:17.190\nStable of operating systems.\n\n463\n00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.898\n>> Absolutely.\n\n464\n00:24:17.898 --> 00:24:23.124\nAll right, so it's rebooted, I've logged\nin, I'm back to my command prompt,\n\n465\n00:24:23.124 --> 00:24:27.824\nI just gonna launch sconfig again,\nand we'll finish configuring remote\n\n466\n00:24:27.824 --> 00:24:32.671\nmanagement, so I go back into a number\nfour, and now I'm gonna allow server\n\n467\n00:24:32.671 --> 00:24:37.800\nmanager remote management, that's\na number three and it's going to create.\n\n468\n00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:40.910\nIt's going to set the Windows power\nto execution policy to remote sign.\n\n469\n00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:43.490\nIt lets me issue remote\npower shell command.\n\n470\n00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:46.730\nSo, if I'm one of those guys,\nand I do I love power shell.\n\n471\n00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:50.820\nI want to sit at my machine and\nissue power shell commands\n\n472\n00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:55.420\nagainst that remote machine I'm\ngonna be able to do that now.\n\n473\n00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:57.110\nAnd let's see what happens here.\n\n474\n00:24:57.110 --> 00:25:01.210\nWe'll return out to the main menu, and\nI'll exit back to my command prompt.\n\n475\n00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:06.550\nAnd I'll flip back over here\nto my server that's got a GUI.\n\n476\n00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:10.600\nAnd I'm gonna change machines again.\n\n477\n00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:14.887\nAnd we'll say core01.lab.net.\n\n478\n00:25:17.941 --> 00:25:19.438\nAnd it's gonna attempt to connect.\n\n479\n00:25:22.224 --> 00:25:24.910\nThinks about it, you can see it's\nalready connecting over here.\n\n480\n00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:28.190\nI can see the name has changed and\n\n481\n00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:32.380\nnow, this console is not managing\nthe machine I'm at anymore.\n\n482\n00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:34.590\nThis console is managing\nthat other machine.\n\n483\n00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:37.960\nThat might be the server\ncloset next to this machine.\n\n484\n00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.260\nIt might be in another\noffice somewhere right,\n\n485\n00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:42.570\nas long as I've got that\nnetwork connectivity.\n\n486\n00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:44.330\nAnd if I want to solve a roll.\n\n487\n00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:51.749\nI can simply go here and\nwait for my screen to launch.\n\n488\n00:25:51.749 --> 00:25:54.040\nRole installation option that's odd.\n\n489\n00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.280\nI think I'm getting a little\nbit of lag here on this guy.\n\n490\n00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:00.690\nHe's thinking about it, but we can\nfire up power shell against this guy.\n\n491\n00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:04.310\nWe can trying to think, we can saw roles.\n\n492\n00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:05.840\nCould you do this locally?\n\n493\n00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:06.690\nAbsolutely.\n\n494\n00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:09.820\nRight, I can go over to server core,\nand if I know my commands,\n\n495\n00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:13.310\nI can type them in here,\nlike setting the name of the computer.\n\n496\n00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:15.190\nI can use netdom to do that.\n\n497\n00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:17.470\nTo join the domain I can use netdom.\n\n498\n00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:23.720\nTo set my TCP/IP address and all my DNS\nsettings, I can use Net SH to configure\n\n499\n00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:28.320\nmy firewall, I can use my Net SH commands,\nbut I don't have those memorized.\n\n500\n00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.900\nIt's not something I do every day,\nI'd have to go look them up.\n\n501\n00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:35.340\nThis server configuration,\nS config, it's beautiful.\n\n502\n00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:36.580\nI don't have to remember all those,\n\n503\n00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.130\nti's going to issue those same\ncommands in the background.\n\n504\n00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:40.190\nI don't have to know.\n\n505\n00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:42.540\nIt makes it very easy to work with core.\n\n506\n00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:45.408\nSo, now you know you've got\ntwo installation options,\n\n507\n00:26:45.408 --> 00:26:47.932\nwhen it comes to installing server 2008r2.\n\n508\n00:26:47.932 --> 00:26:50.240\nYou still got your edition to pick.\n\n509\n00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.940\nBut, now, when you install that edition,\n\n510\n00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.890\ndo you want a full install\nwith the GUI and everything?\n\n511\n00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:57.530\nOr do you want server core,\nwhere you don't get that GUI?\n\n512\n00:26:57.530 --> 00:26:58.560\nEverything is.\n\n513\n00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.720\nStripped out, it's a smaller foot print,\n\n514\n00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:05.198\na smaller security footprint and\na lot more resource friendly.\n\n515\n00:27:05.198 --> 00:27:09.210\nSo, a couple of options there with\ninstalling server, full install and\n\n516\n00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:09.920\nserver core.\n\n517\n00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.960\n>> And obviously it's gonna\nkeep just the passer by\n\n518\n00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:16.790\nfrom just sitting down going this is a\nnice computer, let's see what's on there.\n\n519\n00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:19.410\nThey're going to be treated with that\nlovely command prompt, and they're going\n\n520\n00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:22.930\nto have no idea, your average user is\nnot going to know what to do with that.\n\n521\n00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:27.200\nSo, as administrators, one day, right,\nyeah, you might become, that's a nice\n\n522\n00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.760\nthing for us that, it's actually a little\nbit of security to be honest with you,\n\n523\n00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.790\nbecause they don't know what to do,\nthey're not going to mess with it.\n\n524\n00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:36.070\nAnybody can sit down behind a GUI\ninterface and start clicking on stuff.\n\n525\n00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:38.910\nAnd change in settings,\nit's really simple to do.\n\n526\n00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:42.340\nIt might not be the right settings,\nbut you can change them.\n\n527\n00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:43.500\nWith that black command prompt,\n\n528\n00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:47.540\nthat's gonna deter probably about 95%\nof your population out there, so.\n\n529\n00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:49.430\n>> I couldn't agree with you more, Daniel.\n\n530\n00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:51.140\nIt's funny, Microsoft won't say that,\n\n531\n00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:55.820\nit's not in their documentation that's\na security feature but you're absolutely\n\n532\n00:27:55.820 --> 00:28:00.990\nright because I guarantee you most people\nwill look at that and go ew and move on.\n\n533\n00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:05.430\n>> Yeah, now real quickly we do wanna talk\nabout the idea of firmware updates and\n\n534\n00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:08.760\nbios updates and\nthis is something that you might need to\n\n535\n00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:12.930\ntake a part of when you are installing\na server operating system and that's for\n\n536\n00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:13.940\na very good reason right Randy?\n\n537\n00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:16.840\nEach piece of firmware\nhas it's own software\n\n538\n00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.120\nit's basically a software\nthat runs hardware, right?\n\n539\n00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.680\n>> Yeah, it is.\nFirmware is usually stored in\n\n540\n00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.890\na chip on that machine and\nit can be upgraded.\n\n541\n00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:28.600\nSo, if you've got a server that's\nbeen around for a little while,\n\n542\n00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:32.410\nyou had it running 2000,\n2003, now it's running 2008.\n\n543\n00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:33.810\nThat firmware could be old and\n\n544\n00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:37.700\nit is one of those things that we tend to\nforget about as well as your bios, right.\n\n545\n00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.680\nYour basic input output\nyou've gotta update that.\n\n546\n00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:45.460\nSo, go to the manufacturer check and see\nif there is a new bios version out yet.\n\n547\n00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:47.530\nGo to Dell, go to HP or what have you.\n\n548\n00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:49.640\nThey're gonna have a procedure\nin place for you to.\n\n549\n00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.730\nDownloaded install that new BIOS.\n\n550\n00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:55.640\nFirmware could be for the system itself.\n\n551\n00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.970\nIt could be for\nthe individual hardware device.\n\n552\n00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:00.710\nIt's just like updating your\noperating system, right?\n\n553\n00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:03.250\nExcept for the fact that when you\nblow the operating system away,\n\n554\n00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:04.370\nyou don't have to do that again.\n\n555\n00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:05.141\nRight?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n556\n00:29:05.141 --> 00:29:06.450\n>> Because that's not part of UOS, so\n\n557\n00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:09.660\nyour firmware and your BIOS You\nupdate those and you're good to go.\n\n558\n00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:13.370\nSo, that is one advantage there,\nbut it is almost always forgotten.\n\n559\n00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:18.250\n>> Yeah I was telling Mike that one of the\nfun things about being an administrator is\n\n560\n00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:21.270\nwhen you're trying to get something\nto work, and it's not working.\n\n561\n00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:23.400\nSo, you call the hardware vendor, you say.\n\n562\n00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.990\nI'm trying to get this thing that's\non server and it's not working.\n\n563\n00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:29.300\nThey say, well,\ndid you upgrade the firmware?\n\n564\n00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.040\nWell, no, but it's not that.\n\n565\n00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:32.620\nDid you update the firmware?\n\n566\n00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:34.030\nNo, I didn't update the firmware.\n\n567\n00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:36.870\nWell, update the firmware and then call\nus back if you're still having trouble.\n\n568\n00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:39.205\nAnd then you update the firmware and\neverything starts working and\n\n569\n00:29:39.205 --> 00:29:39.962\nyou're like [NOISE].\n\n570\n00:29:39.962 --> 00:29:41.810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I should have just done that and\n\n571\n00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:42.780\nnow I feel like a fool.\n\n572\n00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:46.330\nSo, definitely,\nany time you start giving installations.\n\n573\n00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:49.450\nJust periodically check,\nespecially if you're doing installation,\n\n574\n00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:51.190\nyou definitely would want\nto check at that point.\n\n575\n00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:54.470\nSee is there any updates to the firmware,\nmaybe the BIOS.\n\n576\n00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:59.060\nThey add features, they add functionality,\nso you would probably want that anyway.\n\n577\n00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:01.100\nSo, you just go ahead and\nmake that happen.\n\n578\n00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:02.061\nAll right, Mike,\n\n579\n00:30:02.061 --> 00:30:06.401\nit looks like we've finally rounded out\nthis installation of server 2008 show.\n\n580\n00:30:06.401 --> 00:30:08.850\nHopefully you guys have enjoyed it.\n\n581\n00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:10.680\nMike, I know we had a great\ntime making it for them.\n\n582\n00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.440\n>> Yeah, we did.\n>> So, we're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n583\n00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.966\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n584\n00:30:14.966 --> 00:30:15.744\n>> And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n585\n00:30:15.744 --> 00:30:16.881\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n\n586\n00:30:16.881 --> 00:30:23.530\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.653\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.653 --> 00:00:20.810\nHere with me today is, well it's\nmy good friend, Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:21.420\nHow's it going, Mike?\n\n6\n00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.710\n>> Oh, it's going great, Daniel.\n\n7\n00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.900\nExcited as always.\n\n8\n00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.560\nWe've got our MTA contact coming\nyour way in this episode.\n\n9\n00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.660\nWe're gonna take a look at an objective\ncalled identify application servers.\n\n10\n00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.560\nWe need to be familiar with all\nthe different application servers\n\n11\n00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.100\nthat are out there and\nwhere we might use them.\n\n12\n00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.380\nIn this exam, remember, this is my Windows\nServer Administration Fundamentals.\n\n13\n00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.030\nWe're not diving into setting up\nthese servers, configuring them, or\n\n14\n00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.190\nanything like that.\n\n15\n00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.560\nIt's a very high level overview.\n\n16\n00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.880\nSo don't kill yourself studying and\n\n17\n00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.540\nreading Technet pages on how to\nset up Exchange, things like that,\n\n18\n00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.260\njust understand what these servers'\npurposes are so that you can identify\n\n19\n00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.370\nthe right technology for the solution that\nthey're asking you about on the exam.\n\n20\n00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.462\nSo pretty straight forward,\n\n21\n00:01:06.462 --> 00:01:09.330\npretty high level overview is what\nwe're gonna take a look at here.\n\n22\n00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.530\nThere are a few that they call out\non the exam objectives specifically,\n\n23\n00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.900\nI'm gonna go over those.\n\n24\n00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.740\nThen I'm gonna throw in some additional\none as well, because I think it's\n\n25\n00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.590\njust great information and\nit's gonna help you in the end right?\n\n26\n00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.730\nThe first thing they talk\nabout is a mail server.\n\n27\n00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.790\nA mail server is probably a pretty\nstraight forward concept.\n\n28\n00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.290\nBut you know, we're talking about.\n\n29\n00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.490\n>> This is the guy that takes\nmy order at the restaurant.\n\n30\n00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.990\nThe male server.\n\n31\n00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.602\n>> Then I guess we.\n\n32\n00:01:33.602 --> 00:01:34.825\n>> [LAUGH] Easy.\n\n33\n00:01:34.825 --> 00:01:37.746\n>> We better go over\nwhat a mail server is.\n\n34\n00:01:37.746 --> 00:01:38.990\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n35\n00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.110\n>> Answers that question.\n\n36\n00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.140\nIt's not as straightforward as I thought.\n\n37\n00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.780\nSo yeah, M-A-I-L server,\nwould be what I'm talking about.\n\n38\n00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.850\nAnd this is how we send email back and\nforth, right?\n\n39\n00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.690\nWe use a mail server.\n\n40\n00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.140\nA mail server on a network is\ngonna host your mailboxes and\n\n41\n00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.710\nthat's where incoming\nemail's gonna be sent to.\n\n42\n00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.520\nAnd then you're gonna use your client,\nwhatever that is,\n\n43\n00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.180\non your machine to connect to\nthat mail server, so that you can\n\n44\n00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.225\nopen up your mailbox and retrieve\nall your emails that are in there.\n\n45\n00:02:10.225 --> 00:02:12.915\nNow I know this probably\nnot a huge jump in,\n\n46\n00:02:12.915 --> 00:02:16.605\nI'm trying to think of\na good way to say it.\n\n47\n00:02:16.605 --> 00:02:18.505\nMost of us have probably sent\nan email back and forth, right?\n\n48\n00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:20.090\nBefore once or twice.\n\n49\n00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.210\nYou know what I'm talking about.\n\n50\n00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.440\nBut, again, for this exam we gotta\nbe able to recognize that hey,\n\n51\n00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.760\nthat's the solution we need.\n\n52\n00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.340\nIf they ask you hey, you need to set up\na way so that users can communicate with\n\n53\n00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.530\neach other via email,\nyou're gonna set up a mail server.\n\n54\n00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.390\nNow they can get complex.\n\n55\n00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.330\nThey can be very simple solutions.\n\n56\n00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.250\nLike you're on a single mail server and\nthat's where everything happens, to very\n\n57\n00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.530\ncomplex where we break out the individual\ncomponents within the mail server.\n\n58\n00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.670\nLike in Exchange we've got our transport\nserver that might sit out there,\n\n59\n00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.840\nwe've got your edge server\nthat sits out in the DMZ.\n\n60\n00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.850\nThat's kinda the entry point for\nthe email.\n\n61\n00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.640\nI've got a hub transport server that might\n\n62\n00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.880\nsplit it between different\nmailbox servers.\n\n63\n00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.020\nThe mailbox server itself\nis another component.\n\n64\n00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.500\nSo as the organization grows,\nit can definitely get much more complex.\n\n65\n00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.350\nAn Exchange is Microsoft's solution,\nright?\n\n66\n00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.230\nMicrosoft Exchange Server is\ntheir mailbox application,\n\n67\n00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.050\nor email application, however you want\nto say that, that we would be using.\n\n68\n00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.750\nAnd obviously it's a very\nimportant component.\n\n69\n00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.880\nI mean, most businesses rely on email\n\n70\n00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.770\nto communicate with each other within the\ncorporation and with other organizations.\n\n71\n00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.460\nYou know, placing orders or requesting\ninformation, or whatever the case may be.\n\n72\n00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.130\nSo a mailbox server is simply a server\nthat we run that hosts the mailboxes and\n\n73\n00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.740\nthat is the,\nwhere we go to check our email, right?\n\n74\n00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.100\nIt has the actual emails themselves.\n\n75\n00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.170\n>> Yeah, and that's exactly right.\n\n76\n00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.450\nIf you spent any time with\nserver administration,\n\n77\n00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.820\nemail is gonna be part of your job,\nit's just a day to day thing.\n\n78\n00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.780\nI've had countless people call me up and\nsay,\n\n79\n00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.530\nI'm having trouble sending this email, or\nI'm trying to set up a mailbox over here,\n\n80\n00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.600\nI'm trying to access somebody\nelse's mailbox, what's going on?\n\n81\n00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.010\nThat is where we come\nin as administrators.\n\n82\n00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.160\nWe have to know a little bit\nabout mail servers, and hey,\n\n83\n00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.020\nwe have to be able to identify\nwhich is our mail server.\n\n84\n00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.930\nMike hit the nail on the head,\nMicrosoft loves their server for\n\n85\n00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.340\nmail which is called Exchange, but\nthere are many others out there.\n\n86\n00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.290\nThere's good old fashioned SendMail.\n\n87\n00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.430\nIt's been around for quite some time.\n\n88\n00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.200\nIt's great for sending emails.\n\n89\n00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.690\nIt's on old Unix systems.\n\n90\n00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.690\nThere's even free applications if\nyou wanna go out and play with it.\n\n91\n00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:30.640\nCheck out hMail.\n\n92\n00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.830\nIt's a downloadable thing.\n\n93\n00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.990\nYou download it and\ninstall it on your computer.\n\n94\n00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.980\nAnd you'll learn some of the ins and\nouts of how email works.\n\n95\n00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.330\nYou don't need to do that for the exam.\n\n96\n00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.060\nThat's just for your own benefit, for\n\n97\n00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:46.160\nyou to get some tires on the asphalt\nkind of thing when it comes to email.\n\n98\n00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.960\nBut being able to identify, okay,\nif I'm having a problem here,\n\n99\n00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.530\nif they ask me a question on the exam in\nthe vein of messaging between two users,\n\n100\n00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.320\nthey've got clients.\n\n101\n00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.940\nAnd what am I probably\nhaving the trouble with?\n\n102\n00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.180\nProbably an email server.\n\n103\n00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.330\nSomeone says, I can't send an email?\n\n104\n00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.280\nWell, it's probably because\nthe mail server might be down.\n\n105\n00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.900\nThat could be one of those answers.\n\n106\n00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.710\nSo we gotta be able to identify that, guy.\n\n107\n00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.340\nExchange, Microsoft solution.\n\n108\n00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.780\n>> Yeah, and you know, we could talk\nabout the Cloud solutions as well.\n\n109\n00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.180\nThere's several Cloud solutions.\n\n110\n00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.160\nMicrosoft has their Office 365, very\ncommon thing you're seeing nowadays for\n\n111\n00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.310\nsmaller organizations to move to a Cloud\nbased solution, because Exchange for\n\n112\n00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:30.170\nexample, is a relatively complex\nenvironment and it always seems to have\n\n113\n00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:35.590\nproblems like you were saying\nit's not that it's a bad product.\n\n114\n00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:36.330\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n115\n00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.260\n>> It's actually one of the best\nemail servers out there I would say.\n\n116\n00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.070\n>> Oh absolutely but\nit seems like one user or\n\n117\n00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.230\nanother is always having a problem with\nemail and so we've got to go in there and\n\n118\n00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.850\ncheck settings and things like that and\nfor a small organization.\n\n119\n00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.590\nThat's a lot of effort that\nthey're putting into just one\n\n120\n00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:53.840\naspect of their business.\n\n121\n00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.570\nSo it might be easier to move that out\nto say Office 365 or we just pay so\n\n122\n00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.690\nmuch money per month per user and\nthey host the exchange server for us.\n\n123\n00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.480\nRight?\nAnd that way I don't have to worry\n\n124\n00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.010\nabout maintaining that mail server.\n\n125\n00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.790\nThere's also things like Hotmail,\nthat's another Microsoft product.\n\n126\n00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.310\nIt's a POP3 system.\n\n127\n00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.030\nExchanges is imap.\n\n128\n00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:19.910\nSo there's different protocols we can use\nto send and receive those emails, but\n\n129\n00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.370\nagain for this exam, there's probably\nalready gonna be an understanding that\n\n130\n00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.390\nan exchange server or a mailbox server is\nwhat I would set up if we need to be able\n\n131\n00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:32.380\nto communicate electronically with other\norganizations or within our organization.\n\n132\n00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.650\nAnother one that they're\ngonna call out on the exam or\n\n133\n00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.530\npossibly if they do call out\nthe objectives is a database server.\n\n134\n00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.180\nAnd you can't go to just about any\ncorporate network nowadays and\n\n135\n00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.360\nnot find a database server sitting there,\nbecause businesses are data driven.\n\n136\n00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.380\nWebsites are data driven.\n\n137\n00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.880\nA database server is a server\nthat hosts a database, right,\n\n138\n00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.860\nit really uses what we call\na relational database engine.\n\n139\n00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.540\nIt's a way to store data in tables.\n\n140\n00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.170\nAnd then retrieve that\ninformation by generating and\n\n141\n00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.620\nsending queries or\nquestions to that database.\n\n142\n00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.370\nI might have a database that\nhas tables in it that store\n\n143\n00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.190\nall my customer order information for\nthe last ten years or something.\n\n144\n00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:21.320\nSo I can go back in there and\nI can generate a query that says,\n\n145\n00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.040\nhey show me all the people that\nhave ordered product xyz, but\n\n146\n00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.600\nwe can do really cool things we it.\n\n147\n00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.790\nWe can say, show me all the customer\nthat have ordered product xyz\n\n148\n00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:35.400\nin the last six months from this zip code,\nwith this quantity or\n\n149\n00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.390\ngreater, and\nwe can do really powerful queries.\n\n150\n00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:41.030\nMost of the databases that are,\nI'm sorry, not the databases, but\n\n151\n00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.520\nmost of the websites you go to\nnowadays are database driven.\n\n152\n00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.449\nIn other words, all that information\nthat's being populated on that\n\n153\n00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:50.846\nwebpage has to come from somewhere right,\n\n154\n00:07:50.846 --> 00:07:54.708\nway back in the day when the web first\nstarted becoming what it is now,\n\n155\n00:07:54.708 --> 00:07:58.571\nwe had a lot of static pages where\nsomebody had to generate the code and\n\n156\n00:07:58.571 --> 00:08:01.860\nwhen you went to that page it\nwas the same thing every time.\n\n157\n00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:06.063\nNot so much any more right, you go to\na webpage it says welcome back Michael,\n\n158\n00:08:06.063 --> 00:08:07.062\nit knows who I am.\n\n159\n00:08:07.062 --> 00:08:09.126\nIt knows what I ordered in the past.\n\n160\n00:08:09.126 --> 00:08:10.308\nIt knows what my favorite.\n\n161\n00:08:10.308 --> 00:08:13.342\nTopics are when I go to Amazon and\nthings like that.\n\n162\n00:08:13.342 --> 00:08:17.370\nThat's because all that information\nabout me is stored in a database.\n\n163\n00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:21.130\nAnd when I log into that website, it can\nrun a query against that database and\n\n164\n00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:22.960\nretrieve all that information.\n\n165\n00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.930\nThe catalog that gets displayed\nof all the products they have,\n\n166\n00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:29.445\nwhen I pick a particular product,\nthe image that displays next to it,\n\n167\n00:08:29.445 --> 00:08:32.020\nthe description of the product.\n\n168\n00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.790\nAll that's stored in a database server.\n\n169\n00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:35.570\nVery, very powerful stuff.\n\n170\n00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:38.570\nAnd databases are prolific.\n\n171\n00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:41.250\nYou're gonna see them everywhere.\n\n172\n00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:46.630\nSQL server, sequel server,\nis Microsoft's Database server.\n\n173\n00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.940\nThere's definitely a lot of others.\n\n174\n00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:54.720\nI know I've played with, what,\nMySQL, Oracle's another big one,\n\n175\n00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.710\nand I'm trying to think of a couple\nothers we could throw out there.\n\n176\n00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:01.470\n>> Well I guess there's now, MySQL has\nbeen around for a little while, and\n\n177\n00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.500\nit used to be a free solution, but\nnow, if I understand correctly,\n\n178\n00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.380\nthey're a corporative type entity.\n\n179\n00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.460\nBut there is a free solution that\nis similar to it, which is MariaDB.\n\n180\n00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.240\nBasically the exact same product.\n\n181\n00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:18.620\nI mean, everything about it is\nidentical to the good old MySQL.\n\n182\n00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:19.590\n>> Mm.\nAnd then just\n\n183\n00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:21.650\nregular Microsoft SQL server, right?\n\n184\n00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:24.540\n>> Yeah, and\nof course on this is Microsoft exam.\n\n185\n00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.700\nSo SQL server should be the one we think\nof when we think of a database server.\n\n186\n00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:33.060\nSQL, when I say SQL,\nthey abbreviate that S-Q-L.\n\n187\n00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:37.600\nSQL actually stands for\nstructured query language.\n\n188\n00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.710\nAnd that's a platform independent term.\n\n189\n00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:43.130\nThat's the language we use\nto talk to these databases.\n\n190\n00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:47.320\nMicrosoft just happened to\nname their product SQL server.\n\n191\n00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.050\nWhich we pronounce sequel server.\n\n192\n00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:54.700\nSo don't get the two confused\nSQL versus Microsoft SQL server.\n\n193\n00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.130\nRight?\nBut, database servers,\n\n194\n00:09:56.130 --> 00:10:00.530\nif your solution says, hey,\nI need to be able to store information and\n\n195\n00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.260\nretrieve that information\nin different ways.\n\n196\n00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:03.900\nRight?\n\n197\n00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.960\nA database server is the way to go.\n\n198\n00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.400\nI could take that information and\n\n199\n00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.170\nput it in a spreadsheet, like a simple\nspreadsheet or a Word document.\n\n200\n00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:12.780\nBut the problem is, how do I filter it?\n\n201\n00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.690\nHow do I show just the sales\nfrom quarter three?\n\n202\n00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:18.650\nRight?\nAnd I know Excel from Microsoft Office is\n\n203\n00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:24.790\na very powerful program, it's almost a\nrelational database engine at this point.\n\n204\n00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:25.320\nIt's close.\n\n205\n00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:30.100\nBut it's much more difficult to\ndo some of those filters, or\n\n206\n00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.480\nit takes a little bit\nmore to filter that data.\n\n207\n00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:37.780\nSo when you think of storing data in\na way that I can easily retrieve it and\n\n208\n00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:44.360\nmanipulate my results by changing what I'm\nlooking for, without modifying the data.\n\n209\n00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.820\nNone of that data changes.\n\n210\n00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.720\nIf I say I wanna see all\nthe stuff from quarter three and\n\n211\n00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.550\nit pulls back that information, well\nquarter one is still in that database,\n\n212\n00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:54.230\nquarter two is still in that database.\n\n213\n00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.520\nAnd I can go back and\nget that information.\n\n214\n00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.320\nRight.\n\n215\n00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:04.090\nSo it's just a good way to store data and\nretrieve that data dynamically and\n\n216\n00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:08.380\nbe able to decide, on the fly if\nI need to, what I want to see.\n\n217\n00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.090\nWhat information I wanna get back.\n\n218\n00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:12.670\nFor example, you might have a database\nthat has customer information and\n\n219\n00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:16.348\nit stores customer's name,\naddress, city, state, zip,\n\n220\n00:11:16.348 --> 00:11:22.140\ntheir customer ID, and\nall kinds of information about them.\n\n221\n00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.890\nBut I just want a simple report that\nsays give me the customer's name and\n\n222\n00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:28.700\nthe state and\nzip code that they're located in.\n\n223\n00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:29.210\nRight?\n\n224\n00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:31.120\nI can narrow it down\nto just those results.\n\n225\n00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.680\nI don't need to see the rest\nof that information.\n\n226\n00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.330\nThe database server is very cool,\nvery powerful.\n\n227\n00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.360\nI love databases.\n\n228\n00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.180\nIt's a great thing to get\ninto if you're a geek.\n\n229\n00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.860\nBecause you do spend a lot of\ntime in front of the keyboard.\n\n230\n00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:44.920\nThey tease, you know?\n\n231\n00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:49.123\nUsually, database guys are the less\nthan social people, you know?\n\n232\n00:11:49.123 --> 00:11:50.320\n>> [LAUGH] That's you, Michael.\n\n233\n00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.560\n>> Yeah.\nAnd I'm not saying that in a bad way.\n\n234\n00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.940\n>> There was a time.\n\n235\n00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:53.450\nThere was a time.\n\n236\n00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:56.290\nI remember you couldn't\nget him out of his house.\n\n237\n00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:57.030\nIt was hard.\n\n238\n00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:00.160\nBut he's right though\ndatabases are everywhere.\n\n239\n00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.840\nI remember when I got into IT.\n\n240\n00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:06.170\nWe had to learn Microsoft Access which was\nanother database solution that they had.\n\n241\n00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:09.710\nAnd you had to learn how to\nwrite programs in Visual Basic\n\n242\n00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:11.690\nwhich accessed the database.\n\n243\n00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:15.520\nAnd we would create cool little front\nend apps that would, you know maybe you\n\n244\n00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.670\nworked for a, I think we worked for\na doctor, that was the scenario.\n\n245\n00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:22.080\nYou work for a doctor's office, and\nyou want to create them a front-end for\n\n246\n00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:22.900\na database.\n\n247\n00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.720\nAnd that's basically why we use databases.\n\n248\n00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.880\nI need all that data in some sort\nof searchable, usable format.\n\n249\n00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:35.220\nI can't just have a flat file with a bunch\nof random bits of information in it,\n\n250\n00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.220\nI need it to be structured.\n\n251\n00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:40.110\nI need it to be organized in such\na way that I can call it and say,\n\n252\n00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:42.550\nokay this is the type of data that I need.\n\n253\n00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:45.790\nAnd that's why database servers are so\nimportant for\n\n254\n00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:48.000\njust about every environment today.\n\n255\n00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:48.640\n>> Absolutely.\n\n256\n00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.490\nIf you want to get into a field\nthat makes a little money,\n\n257\n00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:53.430\ndatabase are the way to go.\n\n258\n00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:59.850\nCompanies love to find somebody that has\ngood skills at working with databases.\n\n259\n00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.450\nOptimizing those databases, making it so\n\n260\n00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:05.870\nthose web servers can retrieve\nthat data lightning fast.\n\n261\n00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:08.931\nIt's a really fun field to get in to,\nI think anyway.\n\n262\n00:13:08.931 --> 00:13:14.110\n[LAUGH] Another one might call it on\nthe exam would be collaboration servers.\n\n263\n00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:18.750\nAnd collaboration servers\nprovide us a way to collaborate.\n\n264\n00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:20.940\nHence the name collaboration\nservers right?\n\n265\n00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:26.240\nNow what I mean by that is multiple\npeople working with the same information\n\n266\n00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.120\nat the same time.\n\n267\n00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.710\nBecause I can have a file on my desktop\nand I can work with it and I've got it\n\n268\n00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:35.740\nopen, I could even share it out on\nthe network so other people can get to it.\n\n269\n00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.160\nBut not while I've got it open.\n\n270\n00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.680\nRight?\nMy operating system locks that file while\n\n271\n00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:40.460\nI've got it open.\n\n272\n00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:44.090\nOnce I close it,\nsomebody else could open it up.\n\n273\n00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:48.390\nCollaboration allows us to all\nwork with the same information.\n\n274\n00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:54.560\nTo work as a team together, on particular\ndocuments or whatever the case may be.\n\n275\n00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:59.140\nMicrosoft's solution for\na collaboration server is SharePoint.\n\n276\n00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.690\nSharePoint is actually\na combination of a few things.\n\n277\n00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:05.100\nIt has a database running in the backend.\n\n278\n00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.660\nThat's what's storing all that\ninformation, our files and\n\n279\n00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.120\nour settings and things like that.\n\n280\n00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.790\nAnd it's a web based interface that\n\n281\n00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:14.410\nwe deal with when we\nconnect to that SharePoint.\n\n282\n00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:18.520\nBut through SharePoint, we can upload\nfiles to it, and then other users\n\n283\n00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:23.500\ncan connect to it, and we can set it so\nmultiple people can open up the same file.\n\n284\n00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.600\nWe can lock a file so\nthat only I can make changes to it.\n\n285\n00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:30.910\nAnd then I can load those, unlock the file\nwhen I'm done making those changes.\n\n286\n00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:33.400\nVery, very common.\n\n287\n00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.070\nA lot of websites are actually\nSharePoint driven.\n\n288\n00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:38.940\nYou wouldn't see it, you wouldn't know\nit unless you knew what to look for.\n\n289\n00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:42.140\nBut a lot of websites are actually\nSharePoint interfaces.\n\n290\n00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:46.032\nVery commonly we use it here,\nwe've got a SharePoint site.\n\n291\n00:14:46.032 --> 00:14:51.120\nWe use Cloud services here for uploading\nlike our show notes and things like that.\n\n292\n00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.870\nSo that, if I'm working on show notes at\nhome, Daniel can see what I've done and\n\n293\n00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:56.880\nhe can work on the other part,\nthings like that.\n\n294\n00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.960\nThat's what I mean by collaboration\nsolutions or collaboration servers.\n\n295\n00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:06.470\nAnd again, SharePoint is Microsoft's\nsolution for that, right?\n\n296\n00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:09.330\nAnd then we've got monitoring servers,\nright?\n\n297\n00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:13.750\nMonitoring servers are servers that\nallow me to monitor my network and\n\n298\n00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:15.780\nsee what's going on.\n\n299\n00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:20.890\nMicrosoft has a solution called\nSystem Center Operations Manger.\n\n300\n00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:24.280\nAnd Systems Center's actually\na suite of utilities.\n\n301\n00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.910\nThere's several components\nthat we can get if we want.\n\n302\n00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:30.340\nOperation Manager is the component\nthat allows me to monitor things.\n\n303\n00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:36.220\nI can run reports on what operating\nsystems exist out there on my network,\n\n304\n00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:39.900\nwhat version they're running,\nwhat updates they have,\n\n305\n00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.120\nwhat software they have installed.\n\n306\n00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:41.800\nInstalled.\n\n307\n00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.830\nBasically hardware inventories,\nsoftware inventories,\n\n308\n00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:49.400\nall of that can be done through operation\nsystem center, operation manager.\n\n309\n00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:55.910\nYou'll see it abbreviated SCOM, or\nSCOM for system center operation manager.\n\n310\n00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:57.250\nFantastic product from Microsoft.\n\n311\n00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:58.890\nIt's not free, and\nnone of these, actually,\n\n312\n00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:00.520\nthat we've talked about are free.\n\n313\n00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.520\nExchange is not part of\nthe operating system.\n\n314\n00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:07.198\nI have to go out and\nbuy license for Exchange.\n\n315\n00:16:07.198 --> 00:16:10.698\nIf I wanna run a SQL server,\nI have to go out to Microsoft and\n\n316\n00:16:10.698 --> 00:16:15.642\nbuy SQL server, Microsoft SQL server and\ninstall it on our 2008 R2 machine.\n\n317\n00:16:15.642 --> 00:16:17.100\nSharePoint's the same way.\n\n318\n00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:21.112\nI've gotta go out and\npurchase this from Microsoft, And then,\n\n319\n00:16:21.112 --> 00:16:24.467\ninstall it on my servers then\nset it up and configure.\n\n320\n00:16:24.467 --> 00:16:30.750\nSo monitoring servers, operations manager,\nagain, not part of my operating system.\n\n321\n00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:35.130\nIt's something that I have to get,\nobtain, and run on a server.\n\n322\n00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.970\nAnd that's typically what they mean when\nthey talk about application servers.\n\n323\n00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:40.600\nYes, there are some that are built\ninto the operating system and\n\n324\n00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.480\nthose are the ones I'm gonna point out\nhere in a minute but a lot of these\n\n325\n00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:48.050\nare separate products outside of\nthe server operating system itself.\n\n326\n00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:52.630\nSo system center operations manager is a\ngreat monitoring server, again, monitor my\n\n327\n00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:56.930\nnetwork, monitor my machine, my hardware,\nmy software that exists on my network.\n\n328\n00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:57.760\nWhy is that important?\n\n329\n00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.530\nWell, I need to make sure that\nall the machines are up to date.\n\n330\n00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:07.983\nI need to make sure that all my employees\nhave access to access, I should say.\n\n331\n00:17:07.983 --> 00:17:12.770\nAnd make sure they all have\naccess to the Microsoft Excel.\n\n332\n00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:13.320\nAnd I can do that.\n\n333\n00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:14.470\nI can do software inventories.\n\n334\n00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:16.870\nI can see what computers\nhave Excel installed on it.\n\n335\n00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:21.440\nI can even push out software using that in\ncombination with some other technologies\n\n336\n00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:26.080\nthat Microsoft makes, to make sure that\nthey do have that software installed.\n\n337\n00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:30.881\nBut the operation manager is more about\nthe viewing of it than the actual\n\n338\n00:17:30.881 --> 00:17:32.331\ninstallation of it.\n\n339\n00:17:32.331 --> 00:17:36.393\nIt gives me a central point because\nif I have dozens or hundreds or\n\n340\n00:17:36.393 --> 00:17:41.513\nthousands of machines on my network and\nthey're scattered across the country or\n\n341\n00:17:41.513 --> 00:17:44.470\naround the world,\nhow do I manage all of that?\n\n342\n00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:46.090\nHow do I see what's going on?\n\n343\n00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:48.710\nHow do I get that overview\nof what I've got out there?\n\n344\n00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:50.590\nIt's a monitoring solution like this.\n\n345\n00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:53.800\nThat allows me to do\ncentralized management or\n\n346\n00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:56.570\ncentralized monitoring because\nI'm not gonna run around and\n\n347\n00:17:56.570 --> 00:18:00.580\ntry to touch each machine or call\nother offices and see what's going on.\n\n348\n00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:04.938\nI can see them from right through\nthat operations manager console.\n\n349\n00:18:04.938 --> 00:18:09.527\nAnd then, they've got threat management\ngateway or threat management is what they\n\n350\n00:18:09.527 --> 00:18:14.180\nactually call that on the objectives and\nthreat management in a Microsoft world.\n\n351\n00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:18.180\nThis is gonna be Microsoft Forefront\nThreat Management Gateway.\n\n352\n00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:23.140\nIt's a big long name, TMG is what most\npeople will shorten it down to TMG for\n\n353\n00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.755\nthreat management gateway.\n\n354\n00:18:24.755 --> 00:18:28.540\nAnd it's actually a product\nthat can do several things,\n\n355\n00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.850\ndepending on how you\nchoose to implement it.\n\n356\n00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:36.370\nIt can sit at the front of your\nnetwork and act like a firewall.\n\n357\n00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:38.050\nAnd that's the entry\npoint into your network.\n\n358\n00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:41.170\nSo everything from the outside\nhas to go through there.\n\n359\n00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:44.080\nAnd it gives me a chance to observe it.\n\n360\n00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.200\nSee what it is.\n\n361\n00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.738\nSee if it's a threat and\nstop it from coming into my network.\n\n362\n00:18:48.738 --> 00:18:51.850\nAnalyze content that's coming in.\n\n363\n00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:55.080\nWe can also set it up\ninternally where it's\n\n364\n00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:59.150\nsegregates a portion of my network\nthat's maybe a little more sensitive.\n\n365\n00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:02.760\nThere's several different ways\nyou can go about configuring\n\n366\n00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.370\nforefront thread management gateway.\n\n367\n00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.490\nAnother great product from Microsoft.\n\n368\n00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:14.413\nAnd it kinda gives me a one solution for\ncanning a lot of antivirus solution.,\n\n369\n00:19:14.413 --> 00:19:18.560\na firewall solution,\nthe anti-malware type thing.\n\n370\n00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.350\nSo another good product from Microsoft.\n\n371\n00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:22.958\nAny one of these all you have to do\nis go out to Microsoft's website.\n\n372\n00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:26.541\nNow, if you wanna know some technical\ndetails about it, like I said,\n\n373\n00:19:26.541 --> 00:19:30.200\nI wouldn't worry as much about that,\nstudying for this exam.\n\n374\n00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:35.260\nRemember, this exam is designed to get\nyou ready to move into that next step.\n\n375\n00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:39.380\nDecide if this is something that\nyou wanna do for your career.\n\n376\n00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.725\nSo we're talking very,\nvery high level overview.\n\n377\n00:19:41.725 --> 00:19:45.694\n[COUGH] Now, I do wanna mention a few\napplication servers that they don't\n\n378\n00:19:45.694 --> 00:19:47.906\nspecifically call that on the exam, but\n\n379\n00:19:47.906 --> 00:19:50.980\nI can definitively see them\ndoing something like that.\n\n380\n00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:54.040\nI thought we should be familiar with them,\nas well.\n\n381\n00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.136\nOne is a domain controller.\n\n382\n00:19:56.136 --> 00:19:58.520\nOr, what's a good way?\n\n383\n00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.226\nAn authentication server.\n\n384\n00:20:01.226 --> 00:20:06.228\nActive Directory Domain Services is\nMicrosoft's identification solution,\n\n385\n00:20:06.228 --> 00:20:08.550\nor their authentication solution.\n\n386\n00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:11.700\nIf you want to centralize,\n\n387\n00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:15.940\nif the question was something like, you're\ncurrently in a Workgroup Environment, but\n\n388\n00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:19.140\nyou wanna move into a more\ncentralized management, where I\n\n389\n00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:22.990\ndon't have to create accounts on every\nsingle machine, for every single person.\n\n390\n00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:24.810\nI wanna centralize all that.\n\n391\n00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:25.760\nWhat would I choose?\n\n392\n00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.730\nWell, that'd be an Active Directory\ndomain control.\n\n393\n00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:31.640\nThose are the kind of things\nthat they might ask you.\n\n394\n00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:36.010\nWhat's the best solution to store data to\nmake it retrievable from your web servers?\n\n395\n00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:37.682\nA database server.\n\n396\n00:20:37.682 --> 00:20:40.000\nA SQL server, in Microsoft Land.\n\n397\n00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:44.185\nAnother one that we're gonna see\non just about every network is\n\n398\n00:20:44.185 --> 00:20:46.650\na name resolution server.\n\n399\n00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:50.030\nName resolution allows me\nto resolve host names,\n\n400\n00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:53.460\nfully qualified domain names,\ninto IP addresses.\n\n401\n00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.360\nAnd everything we do relies on this.\n\n402\n00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.152\nWhen you go to log into your computer,\n\n403\n00:20:57.152 --> 00:21:00.682\nyour computer has to find that domain\ncontroller I was just talking about.\n\n404\n00:21:00.682 --> 00:21:05.550\nIt knows the name and it can query DNS\nwhich is my name resolution server\n\n405\n00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:09.200\nin Microsoft and retrieve the IP address.\n\n406\n00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.940\nMy computer cannot connect to a name.\n\n407\n00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:12.850\nIt can only connect to IP addresses.\n\n408\n00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:14.300\nAnd I say mine, yours as well.\n\n409\n00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:16.270\n[LAUGH] All computers.\n\n410\n00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:21.030\nWhen you type a name into your browser,\nwhen you type in www.newegg.com,\n\n411\n00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:23.210\nwell your computer cannot\nconnect to that name.\n\n412\n00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:24.990\nIt has no idea what that means.\n\n413\n00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:27.660\nBut what it can do is talk to\na name resolution server and\n\n414\n00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:32.580\nsay, hey, my user just typed in this,\nwhat is the IP address for this?\n\n415\n00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:37.031\nAnd that name resolution server's\nlike a phone book for computers.\n\n416\n00:21:37.031 --> 00:21:40.567\nAnd it says, oh,\nif you wanna connect to www.newegg.com,\n\n417\n00:21:40.567 --> 00:21:42.295\nthen here's its IP address.\n\n418\n00:21:42.295 --> 00:21:45.930\n12.1.2.4, whatever the case may be.\n\n419\n00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:48.820\nAnd now, your computer goes,\ncool, I can connect to that.\n\n420\n00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:51.161\nI can connect to the IP address.\n\n421\n00:21:51.161 --> 00:21:56.540\nSo names resolution servers allows us to\nresolve those names and IP addresses.\n\n422\n00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:58.980\nIn a Microsoft world,\nthat's gonna be a DNS server.\n\n423\n00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:02.561\nIt's a role that I can install on a\nserver, it doesn't cost me any money other\n\n424\n00:22:02.561 --> 00:22:05.993\nthan the license for the server itself,\nbut it's not the only solution.\n\n425\n00:22:05.993 --> 00:22:09.947\nLinux has what they're buying\ntheir Berkeley Internet Name,\n\n426\n00:22:09.947 --> 00:22:14.873\nDaemon is another solution that's very,\nvery common out there especially on\n\n427\n00:22:14.873 --> 00:22:19.070\nthe Internet itself internally\na lot of organizations do run DNS.\n\n428\n00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:22.900\nWhat else have we got, Daniel?\n\n429\n00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:24.047\nWeb servers.\n\n430\n00:22:24.047 --> 00:22:26.170\n>> It's a very common server to have.\n\n431\n00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:29.880\nYou wanna look at a webpage, well how the\nheck is that gonna show up on my browser?\n\n432\n00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.860\nYou gotta have a server that's\nserving up those pages.\n\n433\n00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.450\nA very, very common server.\n\n434\n00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:35.729\nWe have one.\n\n435\n00:22:35.729 --> 00:22:39.988\nI'm sure any other website that you're\nactually perusing has to be on that web\n\n436\n00:22:39.988 --> 00:22:43.861\nserver, basically just running some\nsoftware that takes requests and\n\n437\n00:22:43.861 --> 00:22:48.181\nholds the copy of the website itself, so\nthat when you ask for it, it says, oh,\n\n438\n00:22:48.181 --> 00:22:49.860\nthat's what you want.\n\n439\n00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:50.780\nHere you go.\n\n440\n00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:54.370\nThere are obviously some subsets of\ncommands that are going on the background\n\n441\n00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:55.660\nbut when you type in a browser,\n\n442\n00:22:55.660 --> 00:23:00.440\nyou click on a link, that sends\na request to that server and the server\n\n443\n00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.820\ndishes up the page that you requested\nas long as you have access to it.\n\n444\n00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:07.390\nAnd that's basically a web server but\nit's used for plenty of stuff.\n\n445\n00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:10.040\nI mean, web servers they work\ntogether with a lot of like\n\n446\n00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.190\nmail servers as well and\nthing's like that.\n\n447\n00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:14.320\n>> Absolutely, I mean you guys\nare connected to one right now.\n\n448\n00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.830\nYou're watching the show.\n\n449\n00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:19.231\nYou browse to www.itpro.tv.\n\n450\n00:23:19.231 --> 00:23:20.390\nYou type in a name.\n\n451\n00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:25.053\nAnd hey, guess what, your computer\ncan't connect to www.itpro.tv,\n\n452\n00:23:25.053 --> 00:23:27.430\nit had to talk to a DNS server,\n\n453\n00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:32.150\na name resolution server, to figure out\nwhat our web server's IP address was.\n\n454\n00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:34.353\nAnd then, you connected to that,\nand it sent a request.\n\n455\n00:23:34.353 --> 00:23:37.706\nAnd said, hey, my user has typed\nthis name into its browser,\n\n456\n00:23:37.706 --> 00:23:39.450\nwhat have you got for me?\n\n457\n00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:43.550\nAnd that web server sends back that\nwebpage, and then you see our banners, and\n\n458\n00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:46.200\nall that stuff, and our login dialog box.\n\n459\n00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:51.020\nAnd then, once you log in and you get that\ncourse library, it's hitting a SQL server,\n\n460\n00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.730\nor a database server, and it's\nretrieving all the courses we have and\n\n461\n00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:56.790\nwhat the categories are and the\ndescriptions, and things like that, and\n\n462\n00:23:56.790 --> 00:24:00.580\nit's populating that webpage and\nit's sending that HTML content\n\n463\n00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:03.230\nback over to your browser and\nit shows up on your screen.\n\n464\n00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:06.511\nSo all of these guys\ndefinitely work together.\n\n465\n00:24:06.511 --> 00:24:10.955\nAnd then, you click that link down there\nthat says, contact us and now you're gonna\n\n466\n00:24:10.955 --> 00:24:14.710\nsend an email and that's gonna come\ninto our mail servers and when I open\n\n467\n00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:18.930\nup my computer and I go to my inbox, I see\nthat mail sitting there waiting for me.\n\n468\n00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:20.654\nSo it definitely all-\n>> Not before it hits our threat\n\n469\n00:24:20.654 --> 00:24:21.283\nmanagement server.\n\n470\n00:24:21.283 --> 00:24:23.570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Check it for viruses and spam.\n\n471\n00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:24.662\n>> Make sure you guys\naren't sending anything.\n\n472\n00:24:24.662 --> 00:24:26.403\n>> You naughty viewers out there.\n\n473\n00:24:26.403 --> 00:24:27.564\nOut there, we know how you think.\n\n474\n00:24:27.564 --> 00:24:29.069\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] I bet you I can get\n\n475\n00:24:29.069 --> 00:24:29.863\nMike to click on this.\n\n476\n00:24:29.863 --> 00:24:30.420\n>> That's right.\n\n477\n00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:33.650\n>> [LAUGH] Let's see,\nwhat's some other ones?\n\n478\n00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:34.460\nWe talked about DNS,\n\n479\n00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:39.900\nwe talked about web servers, trying to\nthink of some other application services.\n\n480\n00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:40.760\n>> Monitoring.\n>> Monitoring,\n\n481\n00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.960\nwe talked about monitoring servers.\n\n482\n00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.200\nFTP is still out there, you know,\nfile transfer protocol.\n\n483\n00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:50.810\nYou can set up an FTP server if you're\nnot, don't need all of that overhead\n\n484\n00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:54.360\nfrom the graphics and\nthings like that that you get with HTML.\n\n485\n00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:59.679\nFTP might be the way to go because I can\ntransfer files back and forth very easily.\n\n486\n00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.610\nA DHCP, right?\n\n487\n00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:06.300\nThat's another application server.\n\n488\n00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:10.670\nIf I want to provide IP addresses\ndynamically to my network,\n\n489\n00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:14.360\nthen a DHCP server is the way to go,\nright?\n\n490\n00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.670\nBecause I know that DHCP\n\n491\n00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:20.430\nassigns IP addresses to my\nclients that are requesting.\n\n492\n00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:23.640\nSo these are the kind of things that they\nwant you to think about on the exam.\n\n493\n00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:26.550\nIf your solution is calling for,\nyou want your company and\n\n494\n00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:32.610\nyou want a portal that users,\nthat potential customers can come to and\n\n495\n00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:35.770\nget information about your company and\npotentially order product.\n\n496\n00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:38.700\nWell then a web server is\nwhat you're gonna need.\n\n497\n00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:45.080\nIf you wanna make those pages dynamic and\nhave it dynamically generate content,\n\n498\n00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:48.040\nyou might need a database server\nto hold all of that data.\n\n499\n00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:51.556\nSo, lots of different types\nof application servers.\n\n500\n00:25:51.556 --> 00:25:55.320\nWe need to be, at this point, for\nthis exam, I want you to be familiar with\n\n501\n00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:59.590\nwhat they are, their name, and\nwhat solution they provide.\n\n502\n00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:03.240\nBecause that's the kind of thing that\nthey're gonna ask you on this exam is,\n\n503\n00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:06.810\nwhat would you use to host a web site?\n\n504\n00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:10.100\nA web server, a mail server,\nor a domain controller?\n\n505\n00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:12.700\nYou guys need to know\nthe difference between those.\n\n506\n00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:13.860\nThat's about it.\n>> That's right.\n\n507\n00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:15.740\nYeah, well, wise words from Mr. Mike.\n\n508\n00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:18.250\nHeed them, listen to them, because when\nyou're sitting in on an exam that's\n\n509\n00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:21.630\nexactly the type of questions that\nthey're gonna be tossing your way.\n\n510\n00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:25.530\nSo you gotta know the difference between\neach of the application servers that you\n\n511\n00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:27.500\nmight run into on a daily basis.\n\n512\n00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.890\nAnd hey, you can even make a game\nof it as you surf the web.\n\n513\n00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:32.370\nTry to figure out,\nwhat server am I accessing?\n\n514\n00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:35.040\nWhat many servers maybe am I accessing?\n\n515\n00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.190\nDNS?\nMaybe this is a will.\n\n516\n00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:39.000\nObviously, if I'm on a web page,\nweb servers, if I want to send an email,\n\n517\n00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.130\nit's an email server, or\nmailbox server and try to figure out,\n\n518\n00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:44.950\nhey, what can I be going\nthrough at this point in time.\n\n519\n00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:48.660\nOnce you get that idea solidified in\nyour mind you're pretty much good to go.\n\n520\n00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:53.160\nIt's not a difficult concept,\nit just takes a little bit of forethought,\n\n521\n00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.840\nof concentration, to say hey, I know that\nthere are multiple servers out there.\n\n522\n00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:01.310\nLet me make sure I can distinguish between\nthe ones that I am using on a daily basis.\n\n523\n00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:02.270\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n524\n00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:03.640\nI don't mean to downplay it.\n\n525\n00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.390\nIf you're brand new to this stuff,\n\n526\n00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:08.400\nall of the things that we just talked\nabout might be completely foreign to you.\n\n527\n00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.370\nThat's perfectly fine.\n\n528\n00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:11.540\nThis is the exam for you.\n\n529\n00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:15.560\nThis is where you get started so, just\ngo over some of those different types of\n\n530\n00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:18.610\napplication servers,\nunderstand what their function is and\n\n531\n00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:21.550\nwhere I might need them or\nwhen I might need them.\n\n532\n00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:23.915\n>> All right, well hopefully\nyou enjoyed this episode and\n\n533\n00:27:23.915 --> 00:27:27.080\nyou got a lot out of it and\nget you ready for that MTA exam.\n\n534\n00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:30.310\nAs for us though, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n535\n00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:31.399\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n536\n00:27:31.399 --> 00:27:32.153\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n537\n00:27:32.153 --> 00:27:33.012\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n538\n00:27:33.012 --> 00:27:39.880\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

to\nanother fantastic episode of ITproTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.500\nI'm your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n5\n00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.200\nHere with me in the studio today is\nnone other than Mr Mike Roderick.\n\n6\n00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.160\nHow's it going today, Mikey?\n\n7\n00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.210\n>> Oh, it is going great.\n\n8\n00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.020\nI am excited to be here because\nwe've got some more great\n\n9\n00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.764\nMTA Windows server administration\nfundamentals coming your way.\n\n10\n00:00:31.764 --> 00:00:32.903\n>> That's a mouthful, isn't it?\n[LAUGH] >> It really is,\n\n11\n00:00:32.903 --> 00:00:35.355\nit's one of their longer\nexam titles there.\n\n12\n00:00:35.355 --> 00:00:37.980\n[LAUGH] But it's great stuff, and\n\n13\n00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.240\nin this episode we're gonna\nbe looking at a web server.\n\n14\n00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.320\nWe're gonna break down a little bit more.\n\n15\n00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.900\nIn previous episodes we've talked\nabout application servers,\n\n16\n00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.500\nwe've mentioned a web server.\n\n17\n00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.410\nNow we just wanna take a little bit\ncloser look at what a web server is and\n\n18\n00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.140\nwhat it looks like.\n\n19\n00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.082\nAgain, we're not really concerned\nwith diving way down in there and\n\n20\n00:00:56.082 --> 00:01:01.240\nconfiguring, but I was trying to think,\nhost name URLs and things like this.\n\n21\n00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.070\nWe just need to have a good understanding\nof what that web server is really doing\n\n22\n00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.980\nand how it's going about doing it.\n\n23\n00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.220\nAnd that's what we're gonna do.\n\n24\n00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.900\nSo what I've got here is I've got a web\nsever running on my 2008 R2 machine,\n\n25\n00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.770\nmake sure I'm on the right one,\nnot the client there.\n\n26\n00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.390\nGot a 2008 R2 server and\nI have installed IIS.\n\n27\n00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.060\nNow IIS is my internet\ninformation services.\n\n28\n00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.070\nIn 2008 R2 we're talking\nabout IIS version seven.\n\n29\n00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.218\nAnd it's easy to install.\n\n30\n00:01:28.218 --> 00:01:28.720\nAll right?\n\n31\n00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.610\nI you take a server, and you've\nalready got your server installed and\n\n32\n00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.170\nall of that, you don't pay any additional\nmoney, all you do is go to add roles, and\n\n33\n00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.130\nyou launch the wizard, and you click next,\nif you can get to that button down there.\n\n34\n00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.370\n>> It's hiding from you.\n\n35\n00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.740\n>> Yeah.\nAnd you can see I've already installed it.\n\n36\n00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.120\nBut all I did was check web server, and\nthen moved on through the wizard, and\n\n37\n00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.000\nclicked finish.\n\n38\n00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.210\nNow there are some other decisions\nyou have to make along the way, but\n\n39\n00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.710\nI can show you what those\nwere after the fact.\n\n40\n00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.010\nI didn't want you guys to sit here and\nwait for me to install it.\n\n41\n00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.390\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nquit out of this wizard.\n\n42\n00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.430\nAnd as I said,\nI've already got IIS installed.\n\n43\n00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.640\nAn IIS, as I've said, is a web server.\n\n44\n00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.180\nSo once I've got that installed and\nconfigured, let's see what it gives me.\n\n45\n00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.545\nIf I open up a browser on this client,\nand I point this guy over to\n\n46\n00:02:14.545 --> 00:02:21.398\nhttp://, what's the name of my server?\n\n47\n00:02:21.398 --> 00:02:24.273\nWeb01.lab.net.\n\n48\n00:02:24.273 --> 00:02:25.550\nThere you go.\n\n49\n00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.180\nMy client, I typed in this URL, right?\n\n50\n00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.626\nThis resource locator.\n\n51\n00:02:31.626 --> 00:02:32.927\nUniversal resource locator?\n\n52\n00:02:32.927 --> 00:02:35.488\n[CROSSTALK] Gosh, I almost got that wrong.\n\n53\n00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:39.165\nYou type that in and\nDNS resolves that into an IP address and\n\n54\n00:02:39.165 --> 00:02:42.330\nyou send what's called\nan http get packet again.\n\n55\n00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.440\nWe really don't need to\ndive too far into it.\n\n56\n00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.480\nBut you send a request.\n\n57\n00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.350\nYou say, hey, web server,\nsend me your default page.\n\n58\n00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.800\nWhat's your landing page,\nyour homepage, your index,\n\n59\n00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.670\nyou can hear it referred\nto in different ways.\n\n60\n00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.180\nWhere do you want me to start?\n\n61\n00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.460\nAnd it sends back via HTTP,\nif we're talking on secured\n\n62\n00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:06.090\nhypertext transfer protocol,\nit uses that to send back the HTMl,\n\n63\n00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.400\nthe hypertext mark up language,\nthat this webpage is made up of.\n\n64\n00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.470\nAll right?\n\n65\n00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.250\nAnd, there we go.\nAnd, now, as you can see,\n\n66\n00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.420\nI'm not much of a web designer, so I kinda\nthrew a couple things together here and\n\n67\n00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.350\nI didn't really even get it centered,\nand I squished our logo, so\n\n68\n00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.240\nI know Rob is probably\nfreaking out right now,\n\n69\n00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.910\nlooking at that going please tell\nthem that I didn't design that.\n\n70\n00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.380\nRob didn't design this, all right?\n\n71\n00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.840\n>> Mike, don't sell yourself short.\n\n72\n00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.800\nIt's beautiful.\n\n73\n00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.090\n>> Oh, thank you.\n\n74\n00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.330\n>> Okay, everyone.\n\n75\n00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.035\nI love it.\n\n76\n00:03:33.035 --> 00:03:34.005\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He works hard.\n\n77\n00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:34.835\n[LAUGH]\n>> I really did, too.\n\n78\n00:03:34.835 --> 00:03:35.493\nThat's the sad thing about it.\n\n79\n00:03:35.493 --> 00:03:37.440\n[LAUGH]\n>> Really spent some time-\n\n80\n00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.060\n>> Took me about an hour to get this\n\n81\n00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.492\nready, you know?\n\n82\n00:03:40.492 --> 00:03:42.480\nSo- [LAUGH] That's what's going on, right?\n\n83\n00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.570\nYour client, or whatever machine\nyou're sitting at, you open up your\n\n84\n00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.010\nbrowser of choice, you type in that\nURL to connect to that web server, and\n\n85\n00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.060\nit sends back the content that\ngets displayed in your browser.\n\n86\n00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.870\nSame thing is happening when you go to\nNewegg, or Best Buy, or microsoft.com or\n\n87\n00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.970\nwhen you come to our webpage, itpro.tv,\nyou're talking to our web servers, and\n\n88\n00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.190\nit's sending back that content\nto display in your browser.\n\n89\n00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.529\nSo now, let's take a look, and\nwe're gonna close that for now,\n\n90\n00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:12.700\nlet's go back over to my web server and\nopen up good old IIS.\n\n91\n00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:19.220\nSo, Internet Information Services,\nand here is my console that I get.\n\n92\n00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.850\nAnd we can see that we\nhave a few things here.\n\n93\n00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.250\nI've got my, and again, this is not\na class to teach you how to manage IIS,\n\n94\n00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.250\nthat's a whole nother week\nlong topic in and of itself.\n\n95\n00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.060\nWe just wanna kinda see\nwhat the heck is going on.\n\n96\n00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.250\nOn my web server we create\nwhat we call sites.\n\n97\n00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.600\nAnd a site is basically a container, and\n\n98\n00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.600\nthat container is gonna\ncontain my applications.\n\n99\n00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.160\nSo, if this site had some type of app that\nwas running on it, like a, I don't know,\n\n100\n00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.670\nan order form, or a calendar, who knows?\n\n101\n00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.470\nWhatever.\nIt could be several different types\n\n102\n00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.410\nthat would be contained within my site.\n\n103\n00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.070\nAnd then my virtual directories\nare also contained within this site,\n\n104\n00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.370\nand the virtual directories are where\nthe actual files are located.\n\n105\n00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.350\nAll right?\nSo I made this site, ITProTV, and\n\n106\n00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.570\nif I expand it out, I can see that\nI've got these little folders here,\n\n107\n00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.130\nHTML, and images, and\n\n108\n00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:21.730\nscripts and I really didn't put anything\nin there other than a couple basic things.\n\n109\n00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.900\nBut I simply just created that site, and\n\n110\n00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.850\nI created a couple static pages,\nand I set this up.\n\n111\n00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.110\nUp at the top I have application pools,\nand\n\n112\n00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.140\nyou'll see that I have an application\npool for that ITProTV site.\n\n113\n00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.350\nWhen you create a site you're typically\ngonna get an application pool.\n\n114\n00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.670\nAnd an application pool's what's\ndoing the work in the background.\n\n115\n00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.910\nSo if there's something\nthat has to be generated or\n\n116\n00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.690\nsome process that has to happen,\ndata has to be manipulated,\n\n117\n00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.410\nthat application pool is what's\ndoing it in the background.\n\n118\n00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.650\nAnd you can create different\napplication pools for different sites.\n\n119\n00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.120\nYou can host multiple sites\non the same web server even.\n\n120\n00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.620\nYou have to just give them different URLs,\ndifferent ways to connect to them, so\n\n121\n00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.110\nwhen you send that query\nover to that web server,\n\n122\n00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.262\nit knows what site you're\ntrying to connect to.\n\n123\n00:06:09.262 --> 00:06:10.605\nAll right?\n\n124\n00:06:10.605 --> 00:06:12.880\nWe'll back out here to it ITPro.\n\n125\n00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.870\nSo again, that's the site I created.\n\n126\n00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.050\nAnd it's currently using HTTP.\n\n127\n00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.080\nHTTP again, Hypertext Transfer Protocol.\n\n128\n00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.540\nThat's the protocol I'm using to\nconnect over to that web server and\n\n129\n00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.850\ncommunicate with it.\n\n130\n00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.860\nAnd the default port for\nthat is gonna be port 80.\n\n131\n00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.340\nWhich means if I wanna run a web server,\nand\n\n132\n00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.650\nI want to host a web page via HTTP,\nI need to open up port 80 because\n\n133\n00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.920\nthat is what they're gonna\ntry to connect to by default.\n\n134\n00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:49.220\nIf you ever change that,\nthe user's gonna have to\n\n135\n00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.790\nknow because what happens is my\nbrowser defaults to port 80.\n\n136\n00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:58.280\nIf my admin told me that, hey,\nit's on a different URL, or\n\n137\n00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.040\nI'm sorry different port number,\nI could come over here and\n\n138\n00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:08.360\nsay http:// web01.lab.net: and\n\n139\n00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.710\nthen 88 for example, a different port\nnumber, connect to a non default port.\n\n140\n00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:16.340\nNow that port on my server is not open\nbecause I'm using the default port, but\n\n141\n00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.620\nthat's what you would do is you could\nspecify a different port number\n\n142\n00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.230\nif you were, again,\nhosting multiple web sites.\n\n143\n00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:24.820\nAll right?\n\n144\n00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:29.000\nHTTP is plain text, meaning that all\nthe data that's being sent back and\n\n145\n00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.230\nforth between you and\nthat web server is not encrypted.\n\n146\n00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.260\nIt's not protected.\n\n147\n00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:39.390\nSo anybody in between you could intercept\nthat information and read that.\n\n148\n00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:40.920\nAnd, well who's in between you?\n\n149\n00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.348\nWell, if you're connecting to Newegg,\nor to your bank, or what have you,\n\n150\n00:07:44.348 --> 00:07:47.671\nanybody on the internet could potentially,\nright, be in between you and\n\n151\n00:07:47.671 --> 00:07:50.962\nthat server because you're going\nacross that public infrastructure.\n\n152\n00:07:50.962 --> 00:07:54.109\nAnd that's where HTTPS comes into play.\n\n153\n00:07:54.109 --> 00:08:02.930\nHTTPS is my Using SSL, it's called Secure\nSocket Layer or TLS is a newer form.\n\n154\n00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.820\nBut for this example I think\nwe'll just stick with SSL.\n\n155\n00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.510\nYou put that S on the end of it and\n\n156\n00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.250\nit changes the port number\nyou're connecting to.\n\n157\n00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:15.500\nAnd now you're gonna be going over port\n443 by default again that can be changed\n\n158\n00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.110\nand that's the port we\nattempt to connect to.\n\n159\n00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:21.260\nBut it has to be set up on\nthe server-side of things.\n\n160\n00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.853\nLike we'll this site that I\njust made again is using HTTP,\n\n161\n00:08:25.853 --> 00:08:28.870\nthe website has what we call binding.\n\n162\n00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:31.520\nAll right, and I'm gonna come over\nhere and I'm gonna click binding.\n\n163\n00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:36.322\nAnd I can see I've got one binding\ncurrently for HTTP port 80.\n\n164\n00:08:36.322 --> 00:08:39.840\nIf I go to edit and maybe we can see\na little more information about it.\n\n165\n00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:43.780\nUsing protocol HTTP,\nIP address all unassigned.\n\n166\n00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:47.040\nThis web server could have\nmultiple network adapters in it.\n\n167\n00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.570\nAnd I don't care which network\nadapter you're connecting to,\n\n168\n00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:52.702\nthis website can respond on it and\nit's using port 80.\n\n169\n00:08:52.702 --> 00:08:57.960\nAll right, if I want to set up SSL,\nif I want you to make a secure connection\n\n170\n00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.750\non my website, well I'll have to create\na new binding for that port, for port 443.\n\n171\n00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:06.150\nAnd I also need something\ncalled a certificate.\n\n172\n00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:10.350\nA certificate is the way that my server\ncan prove its identity, first of all.\n\n173\n00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:15.070\nAnd then it contains keying information\nthat we can use to encrypt the data\n\n174\n00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:16.640\nas it travels back and forth.\n\n175\n00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.370\nI'm sure all of you out there\nare familiar with this.\n\n176\n00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:21.690\nIf you've ever done any banking or\nordered anything online.\n\n177\n00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:23.660\nYou made a secure connection to your bank.\n\n178\n00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.010\nHopefully, [LAUGH] you did anyway.\n\n179\n00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:25.640\nRight?\n\n180\n00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:29.032\nOr when you ordered something before\nyou put your credit card in there.\n\n181\n00:09:29.032 --> 00:09:33.070\nYou wanna make sure that little lock icon\nor whatever your particular browser does\n\n182\n00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:35.320\nshows you that I've got\na secure connection.\n\n183\n00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.431\nThat way I know the traffic being\nsent back and forth between me and\n\n184\n00:09:38.431 --> 00:09:39.912\nthat web server is encrypted.\n\n185\n00:09:39.912 --> 00:09:43.670\nSo if somebody does intercept that\ninformation they can't read it.\n\n186\n00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.620\nIt's gonna look like garblygook to\nthem because they don't know how to\n\n187\n00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.950\ndecrypt it only you and that web server,\n\n188\n00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:53.119\nwhich have already negotiated security,\nknow how to decrypt the information.\n\n189\n00:09:53.119 --> 00:09:56.280\n[COUGH] So\nif I wanna set up HTTPS on this website\n\n190\n00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.474\nit wouldn't be that difficult when I say\nthat we'll find out here in a second.\n\n191\n00:09:59.474 --> 00:10:04.050\nAll right, if I go to my server, I need\na certificate, so I'm gonna go to server\n\n192\n00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:08.460\ncertificates and I'm gonna create\na self signed certificate.\n\n193\n00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:14.534\nAnd I'm gonna give it a name,\nI'm gonna call it web01.lab.net.\n\n194\n00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:16.600\nNow click.\n\n195\n00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.610\nDid I get that right?\n\n196\n00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:19.174\nYeah.\nI'll click Next.\n\n197\n00:10:19.174 --> 00:10:24.710\nAll right, and there we go, I now\nhave a certificate for web01.lab.net,\n\n198\n00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:29.770\nand I go back over here to my site,\nand I create a new binding.\n\n199\n00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:32.410\nAnd I say I'm gonna add a new binding.\n\n200\n00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:34.900\nAnd I wanna do port,\nnotice it says 80 over here?\n\n201\n00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:40.610\nI'm gonna change this to HTTPS and\nit automatically switches over to 443.\n\n202\n00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:43.530\nThen I'm gonna browse for the certificate.\n\n203\n00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.320\nThen I'm gonna choose that,\nand I'm gonna click OK, but\n\n204\n00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.920\nlet's view that certificate first.\n\n205\n00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:53.310\nThis is what got generated when I clicked\non that create a self-signed certificate.\n\n206\n00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:57.850\nThis is a way, it's very similar to a way\na driver's license works if you're here in\n\n207\n00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:01.272\nthe U.S.,\nit's a way that you can identify yourself.\n\n208\n00:11:01.272 --> 00:11:03.990\nAl lright when I connect\nto Bank of America,\n\n209\n00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.980\nI wanna know that's actually\nBank of America and\n\n210\n00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:10.632\nI didn't get redirected to some fishing\nscam or something crazy like that.\n\n211\n00:11:10.632 --> 00:11:15.720\nSo my machine says hey, Bank of America\nweb server, show me your certificate,\n\n212\n00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.740\nprove to me you're actually\nare Bank of America.\n\n213\n00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:23.100\nAnd it'll show me this and\nit'll say issued to bankofamerica.com or\n\n214\n00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.600\nwhatever their server's name is,\nor that kind of thing.\n\n215\n00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:32.460\nAnd I can look at that, and I can say, oh\nokay, so it says you are Bank of America.\n\n216\n00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.870\nNow how do I know that that\ncertificate is not faked?\n\n217\n00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:36.410\nRight?\n\n218\n00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:39.970\nWell I need to trust the people\nthat are issuing that certificate.\n\n219\n00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.830\nThese certificates are bought from these\npublic certificate authorities, and\n\n220\n00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:49.360\nmy computer knows to trust\nthose places like Thought, or\n\n221\n00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.470\nVerisign, or Equifax, or GTE, or whomever.\n\n222\n00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:54.550\nRight?\n\n223\n00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.150\nAnd if my computer trusts\nthe certificate it says, oh,\n\n224\n00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:00.590\nI know who issued this certificate,\nthat was VeriSign.\n\n225\n00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:03.020\nI trust them, so\nthe certificate must be good.\n\n226\n00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.458\nI'll go ahead and allow this connection,\nset up this secure connection.\n\n227\n00:12:06.458 --> 00:12:11.350\nAll right, mow in my case, I'm gonna go\nahead and click OK to create this binding.\n\n228\n00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:12.740\nAnd now I've got that binding there.\n\n229\n00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:18.758\nIn this case though I could have\njust self signed certificate, so\n\n230\n00:12:18.758 --> 00:12:21.120\nmy client, if I go to connect.\n\n231\n00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:26.151\nAll right, now I'm gonna change my HTTPS\n\n232\n00:12:26.151 --> 00:12:31.650\ninstead of http://web01.lab.net.\n\n233\n00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:37.290\nAnd it's gonna attempt to\ncreate that secure connection.\n\n234\n00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:41.630\nIt's thinking about it here,\nand there we go.\n\n235\n00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:42.560\nAnd this is what I get.\n\n236\n00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:46.020\nIt says there is a problem with this\nwebsite's security certificate.\n\n237\n00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.890\nSo my computer reached\nout to the web server and\n\n238\n00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:51.500\nsaid hey, I wanna create a secure\nconnection, I don't want anybody able to\n\n239\n00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.650\nintercept any of this data that\nwe're sending back and forth.\n\n240\n00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:57.880\nSo sending your certificate\nwith your keying information so\n\n241\n00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.020\nwe can start encrypting data.\n\n242\n00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:04.230\nThe web server sent it back, my computer\nlooked at this certificate and said wait,\n\n243\n00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:06.320\nthis was signed by web01.\n\n244\n00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.590\nWho the heck is that?\n\n245\n00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:14.600\nMy computer has a whole bunch,\nI'm just gonna pull it up over here,\n\n246\n00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:19.630\noops, Content tab, Certificates,\nand then Trusted Root.\n\n247\n00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:23.130\nThese are all the companies\nthat my computer trusts.\n\n248\n00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:23.970\nRight here.\n\n249\n00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:24.510\nAll right?\n\n250\n00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:27.250\nSo any certificate issued\nby anyone of these people,\n\n251\n00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:30.800\nmy computer will automatically say,\noh yeah, as long as they say you're good,\n\n252\n00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.420\nI'm gonna go ahead and trust you as well.\n\n253\n00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.480\nAll right?\n\n254\n00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.825\nBut nowhere in here is web01.\n\n255\n00:13:35.825 --> 00:13:37.370\nSo my computer is warning me.\n\n256\n00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:40.780\nIt's gonna say, hey,\nI don't know who created this certificate.\n\n257\n00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:42.660\nIt's nobody that's in my list.\n\n258\n00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.140\nAre you sure you wanna connect to them?\n\n259\n00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:48.100\nAll right, and\nthat's what's going on here.\n\n260\n00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.665\nNow, I can choose to connect anyway.\n\n261\n00:13:50.665 --> 00:13:52.460\nRight?\nI can continue to this website.\n\n262\n00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:53.420\nNot recommended.\n\n263\n00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.535\n>> Don't do it, Michael.\n\n264\n00:13:54.535 --> 00:13:56.400\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> Boom, this is a warning.\n\n265\n00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.660\n>> It's interesting.\n\n266\n00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:58.470\nI've dealt with this a lot.\n\n267\n00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:01.450\nI've done a lot of user\nhelp desk type of stuff.\n\n268\n00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:04.300\nAnd people will see things like this and\nthink this is an error.\n\n269\n00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.580\nAnd it's not necessarily an error.\n\n270\n00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:09.050\nIt is a warning letting you know\nthat there is some information that\n\n271\n00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:10.300\nyou might not be aware of.\n\n272\n00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.200\nThat's what this page\nis trying to tell you.\n\n273\n00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.030\nIt is saying that I am\ngetting a certificate.\n\n274\n00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:14.664\nRight?\nThere,\n\n275\n00:14:14.664 --> 00:14:18.942\nthis SSL thing that you're trying to do\nthe secure connection that's trying to be\n\n276\n00:14:18.942 --> 00:14:22.476\nbuilt up, it will happen but\nthe certificate that they're using,\n\n277\n00:14:22.476 --> 00:14:23.966\nI just don't recognize it.\n\n278\n00:14:23.966 --> 00:14:25.750\nSo it gives you that warning information.\n\n279\n00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:28.717\nA lot of times you see screens like this,\nthey're just informational.\n\n280\n00:14:28.717 --> 00:14:32.107\nAnd It's up to us to read, and know,\nand see what that information is and\n\n281\n00:14:32.107 --> 00:14:33.950\nwhether or not we need to discern this.\n\n282\n00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:37.570\nNow if you're at a user level you're\nprobably not gonna know whether or\n\n283\n00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:41.490\nnot the self signed SSL certificate that\nMike has generated is good or not, so\n\n284\n00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.385\nyou might generate a help desk call.\n\n285\n00:14:43.385 --> 00:14:48.043\nBut as a help desk technician, as server\nadministrators we're going to know,\n\n286\n00:14:48.043 --> 00:14:51.750\nwe're gonna see you have tried\nto contact our own server.\n\n287\n00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:56.347\nWe do self sign that certificates, so we\ncan with confidence tell those users yeah,\n\n288\n00:14:56.347 --> 00:15:00.513\nyou're fine with that, if you see it\non anything other than our equipment.\n\n289\n00:15:00.513 --> 00:15:04.630\nIf you're trying to access somewhere out\nin the Internet, and not a local resource.\n\n290\n00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:08.760\nThat would be a good idea for\nyou to not press the OK continue,\n\n291\n00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:12.350\nunless you're sure that\nserver is legitimate.\n\n292\n00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:15.873\nSo just a helpful safety tip for\nall of us out there.\n\n293\n00:15:15.873 --> 00:15:16.715\n>> Absolutely.\n\n294\n00:15:16.715 --> 00:15:21.645\nYou do not want to go, if I connected\nto some random website.com and\n\n295\n00:15:21.645 --> 00:15:23.560\nwanted to order product.\n\n296\n00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:28.190\nAnd when I went to that order page and\nit tried to connect to HTTPS and\n\n297\n00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:32.580\nit says wait, we don't trust this\ncertificate, you can darn sure believe I'm\n\n298\n00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:36.230\nnot going to click continue and I'm not\ngonna put my credit card number in there.\n\n299\n00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:38.750\nBecause I can't verify the identity\nof that server on the other end,\n\n300\n00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:39.759\nI don't know who they are.\n\n301\n00:15:39.759 --> 00:15:44.315\nBut as Daniel said, if my company tells\nme, hey look, when you're outside and\n\n302\n00:15:44.315 --> 00:15:46.697\nyour trying to check your company email.\n\n303\n00:15:46.697 --> 00:15:51.525\nAnd our email server and web server, their\ncertificates are having issues right now,\n\n304\n00:15:51.525 --> 00:15:53.390\nbut you can go ahead and trust it.\n\n305\n00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:56.340\nOkay, that's okay, they're telling\nme they know there's a problem.\n\n306\n00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:00.298\nCuz it could be that the certificate is\nexpired and they're waiting for a new one\n\n307\n00:16:00.298 --> 00:16:04.035\nto come in from Verisign or Thawte or\nwhoever they got it from, no big deal.\n\n308\n00:16:04.035 --> 00:16:07.310\nBut if you don't know who they are and you\nget that kind of warning, you better stop.\n\n309\n00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:09.810\nDon't put any kind of\ninformation in there,\n\n310\n00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:11.278\nbecause you don't know\nwho you're dealing with.\n\n311\n00:16:11.278 --> 00:16:16.180\nNow, and you can see, I've got a secure\nconnection, but it's warning me.\n\n312\n00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:18.160\nIt's saying hey,\nI don't know if you better,\n\n313\n00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.020\nyou might not wanna put any personal\nidentifiable information or\n\n314\n00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:25.690\nsensitive information in there,\ncuz we don't know who the heck this is.\n\n315\n00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:28.620\nThe end user can view the certificate and\nsay, oh, you know what,\n\n316\n00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:31.040\nI know who they are, I'm okay with that.\n\n317\n00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.902\nAnd they can continue on just like normal.\n\n318\n00:16:33.902 --> 00:16:37.260\nAll right, now let's see what we can do,\nI'm gonna try this here.\n\n319\n00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:42.760\nThe way you fix a problem like that is,\nyou trust the certificate.\n\n320\n00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.820\nIn a large corporate environment,\nwe're not gonna have to deal with this.\n\n321\n00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.410\nI just wanna show you guys though,\njust for giggles.\n\n322\n00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:50.630\nWell not for giggles,\nI shouldn't say that.\n\n323\n00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:54.221\nTo show you how we could fix something\nlike that, maybe you're in an organization\n\n324\n00:16:54.221 --> 00:16:57.610\nthat can't afford to go buy a certificate,\nso you create your own.\n\n325\n00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:01.150\nAnd what I can do is I can go ahead and\nexport this certificate.\n\n326\n00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:02.200\nAnd I'll export it out to,\n\n327\n00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:06.200\nI don't know, let's do my desktop here,\nthat'll be an easy one to find.\n\n328\n00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.370\nAnd I'll call it web01.\n\n329\n00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:14.556\nAnd because it's gonna contain\na private key, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n330\n00:17:14.556 --> 00:17:15.317\nget a password.\n\n331\n00:17:15.317 --> 00:17:19.312\nActually it shouldn't contain\nthe private key, but that's all right.\n\n332\n00:17:19.312 --> 00:17:23.270\nAnd now that should be on my desktop.\n\n333\n00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:28.228\nSo there's that certificate, and I'm gonna\nput it in this little shared folder here.\n\n334\n00:17:28.228 --> 00:17:30.887\nWell, evidently, I'm not-\n>> You're not putting into that shared\n\n335\n00:17:30.887 --> 00:17:31.490\nfolder [LAUGH].\n\n336\n00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:33.197\n>> Gonna put it in that shared [LAUGH]\nfolder, that's great, all right.\n\n337\n00:17:33.197 --> 00:17:36.714\nLet's copy that, and\nstick it on my C drive.\n\n338\n00:17:40.197 --> 00:17:44.354\n[SOUND] All right, and\nsee if we can grab it anyway.\n\n339\n00:17:44.354 --> 00:17:46.930\nI'll go grab this guy real quick, oops.\n\n340\n00:17:49.171 --> 00:17:54.123\nWhat do we got, web01/c$,\nget to that hidden share, and\n\n341\n00:17:54.123 --> 00:17:56.894\nI'll drag that baby over to here.\n\n342\n00:17:56.894 --> 00:18:00.149\n>> Now, normally, we would get this\nother means, obviously, you wouldn't be\n\n343\n00:18:00.149 --> 00:18:03.360\nlogging in and trying to browse\nthrough servers and stuff like that.\n\n344\n00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.504\nWe, as administrators,\n\n345\n00:18:04.504 --> 00:18:07.624\nwould hand that out to our users in\nsome other fashion, maybe as an email\n\n346\n00:18:07.624 --> 00:18:10.378\nattachment or some other [CROSSTALK]\n>> Could be in a shared folder that they\n\n347\n00:18:10.378 --> 00:18:12.306\ncan get to-\n>> Yeah, shared folder, yeah.\n\n348\n00:18:12.306 --> 00:18:13.952\n>> Or something like that.\nAnd all I would do is I would say,\n\n349\n00:18:13.952 --> 00:18:15.985\nall right,\nI'm going to install this certificate.\n\n350\n00:18:15.985 --> 00:18:18.757\nAnd I'm gonna to install it for\nmy Local Machine,\n\n351\n00:18:18.757 --> 00:18:23.647\nI'm gonna click Next, and there's the file\nname, that's fine, we'll click Next.\n\n352\n00:18:23.647 --> 00:18:30.268\nI have to know what that password\nwas to get access to that.\n\n353\n00:18:30.268 --> 00:18:33.978\nAnd I'm gonna put it in because,\nin this situation, it's gonna look at that\n\n354\n00:18:33.978 --> 00:18:37.490\ncertificate and go, I don't know\nwho that is, I don't trust it.\n\n355\n00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:39.470\nIt's gonna put it in my\nUntrusted Certificates and\n\n356\n00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:43.690\nI'm gonna be right back to square one\nwhere it pops up as not being trusted.\n\n357\n00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:47.503\nI'm gonna tell it, hey look,\nI trust this certificate, so go ahead and\n\n358\n00:18:47.503 --> 00:18:50.392\nput it in your\nTrusted Root Certification Authority.\n\n359\n00:18:50.392 --> 00:18:55.797\nI'll click OK > Next > Finish, and\nit tells me it was successful.\n\n360\n00:18:55.797 --> 00:19:00.074\nAnd if I open up my browser now and\ngo take a look at those settings,\n\n361\n00:19:04.767 --> 00:19:08.580\nAnd I go back over to Content and\nCertificates.\n\n362\n00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:14.360\nAnd what I'm hoping to see is\na certificate for web01 listed in here.\n\n363\n00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:19.070\nSo now I've just told my computer,\nit's okay, I trust them.\n\n364\n00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:22.800\nEvery time I connect to that,\nyou don't have to warn me, I trust them.\n\n365\n00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.832\nNow I click Close > OK, and\nnow let's see what happens.\n\n366\n00:19:32.633 --> 00:19:35.452\nWe should-\n>> Cranking away, drum roll please.\n\n367\n00:19:35.452 --> 00:19:36.533\n>> Yeah, right, [LAUGH].\n\n368\n00:19:36.533 --> 00:19:38.656\n>> This is always the moment of truth,\nright?\n\n369\n00:19:38.656 --> 00:19:42.498\n>> [LAUGH] It's thinking about it,\nit's thinking about it, come on baby.\n\n370\n00:19:42.498 --> 00:19:45.336\nIt's looking at the certificate,\nand there we go.\n\n371\n00:19:45.336 --> 00:19:47.720\nNotice I've got a little lock icon there,\n\n372\n00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.590\nit's telling me that I\nhave a secure connection.\n\n373\n00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:53.000\nI can also see my HTTPS connection.\n\n374\n00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.720\nNow, another thing I want to point out,\n\n375\n00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.580\njust because I did that,\nlet's say you're setting this up and\n\n376\n00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:01.190\nyou want to make sure that every\nconnection to that web server is secure.\n\n377\n00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:02.975\nWell, what if I try to connect unsecure?\n\n378\n00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.780\nNotice that it let me connect anyway,\nright.\n\n379\n00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.760\nLock's gone, I'm connected.\n\n380\n00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.930\nOn this web server, remember,\nI had those bindings, and\n\n381\n00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:14.900\nI didn't remove that default binding for\nthe HTTP.\n\n382\n00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:17.180\nSo if I go back over to this site and\n\n383\n00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:21.540\nI take a look at my bindings, see now\nI can have people connect either way.\n\n384\n00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:26.840\nThey can connect via HTTPS on 443, or\nthey can connect via HTTP on port 80.\n\n385\n00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.175\nWell, I can take this and remove it.\n\n386\n00:20:31.496 --> 00:20:34.916\nAnd now if I go back over here and\nI try to refresh this page,\n\n387\n00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:40.210\nUsing HTTP, it shouldn't let me.\n\n388\n00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:42.880\nBecause it's saying, oh,\nthat server no longer has a binding.\n\n389\n00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:47.490\nThe server's not listening for\npeople coming in on port 80 anymore.\n\n390\n00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:49.480\nHe's gonna ignore port 80 all together.\n\n391\n00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:55.463\nAlthough it did connect,\nit might be a using a cached copy here.\n\n392\n00:20:55.463 --> 00:20:56.695\n[COUGH] He shouldn't connect.\n\n393\n00:20:56.695 --> 00:21:02.305\nHttp:, [SOUND] oh, webo1.lab.net,\nI might need to flush some things out.\n\n394\n00:21:02.305 --> 00:21:05.420\nYeah, he's still got that cached copy but\nthat's normally what you do,\n\n395\n00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.238\nis you remove that binding from port 80.\n\n396\n00:21:07.238 --> 00:21:13.019\nOh, you know what, I forgot, and again,\nI'm not an IIS admin by any means.\n\n397\n00:21:13.019 --> 00:21:16.425\nLet's move over here and say,\nRequire SSL, I almost forgot to do that.\n\n398\n00:21:16.425 --> 00:21:23.059\nSo take out that binding and then choose\nto Require SSL and apply those changes.\n\n399\n00:21:23.059 --> 00:21:24.162\nAnd now let's see what happens.\n\n400\n00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:32.405\nVia http, and it thinks and it's trying,\nit's saying, hey let me connect,\n\n401\n00:21:32.405 --> 00:21:33.240\nhey let me connect.\n\n402\n00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.910\nAnd it tries more than once, it's saying,\n\n403\n00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:37.550\nlet me get this guy's webpage open for\nhim.\n\n404\n00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:40.840\n>> It's a good thing that they don't\njust say, well I tried one time and\n\n405\n00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:41.820\nnothing happened.\n\n406\n00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:44.750\nSorry about your luck guy and\nyou get your error.\n\n407\n00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:49.369\nThey do continually try to make a few\nattempts to access the website.\n\n408\n00:21:49.369 --> 00:21:52.748\nBecause you never know, sometimes,\nespecially with web sites that\n\n409\n00:21:52.748 --> 00:21:56.610\nare accessible via the Internet, right,\nthings that can anybody can get to.\n\n410\n00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:59.770\nYou just type in a web address and\nyou can attach yourself to it.\n\n411\n00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:02.610\nWhat can happen is,\nmaybe you got too many people,\n\n412\n00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:05.700\nmaybe they don't have enough robustness.\n\n413\n00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:09.130\nMaybe you've got a ton of people that are\nlike, man, have you checked out that site?\n\n414\n00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:10.910\nAnd you go to check it out and\nyou're getting,\n\n415\n00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:14.220\npage cannot be displayed, file not found,\nthings of that nature, right?\n\n416\n00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.155\nNothing is showing up.\n\n417\n00:22:15.155 --> 00:22:16.870\nWell, it doesn't mean\nthe website's not there.\n\n418\n00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:20.111\nIt could just mean that it's\ngot too many requests and\n\n419\n00:22:20.111 --> 00:22:24.087\nit's not able to handle all those\nrequests at this point in time.\n\n420\n00:22:24.087 --> 00:22:25.820\nMaybe try back in a few minutes.\n\n421\n00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:27.280\nThat's the kind of thing that can happen.\n\n422\n00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:30.661\nOr, like Mike's trying to do,\nwhere he's got the SSL connection and\n\n423\n00:22:30.661 --> 00:22:33.373\nhe's trying to get rid of\nthat old regular connection.\n\n424\n00:22:33.373 --> 00:22:36.617\nBut your computer says,\nwell, to speed things up,\n\n425\n00:22:36.617 --> 00:22:39.216\nI'll keep a copy of that local to myself.\n\n426\n00:22:39.216 --> 00:22:42.790\nThat way if nothing's changed,\nthere's no need to look for it.\n\n427\n00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:46.189\nI mean, you just looked at this site,\nI'd be surprised if anything's changed in\n\n428\n00:22:46.189 --> 00:22:48.326\nthe last two seconds since\nyou were attached to it.\n\n429\n00:22:48.326 --> 00:22:49.172\n>> [LAUGH] right.\n\n430\n00:22:49.172 --> 00:22:50.854\n>> So\nwe'll just look to my local copy, and\n\n431\n00:22:50.854 --> 00:22:52.690\nI think that's what you're dealing with.\n\n432\n00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:56.556\nNow Mike, sometimes when that happens,\none of my favorite tricks is to go into\n\n433\n00:22:56.556 --> 00:22:58.968\nthe Internet Explorer options,\nyour browser.\n\n434\n00:22:58.968 --> 00:23:03.923\nAnd in there, there is an option that\nsays, always check for new content.\n\n435\n00:23:03.923 --> 00:23:04.968\nAnd that should probably\nget you past that.\n\n436\n00:23:04.968 --> 00:23:05.943\n>> Let me try that real quick.\n\n437\n00:23:05.943 --> 00:23:07.546\nAlthough we were really-\n>> I would hope so.\n\n438\n00:23:07.546 --> 00:23:09.484\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I think that would work.\n\n439\n00:23:09.484 --> 00:23:12.295\nBut let's go ahead and move on from this\ncuz we've only got a little bit left and\n\n440\n00:23:12.295 --> 00:23:14.520\nthere's a couple of things\nthat I wanna talk about.\n\n441\n00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.350\nAnd again, the test really isn't\ngonna get that detailed on you.\n\n442\n00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:23.734\nSo as long as you understand HTTP is\nport 80 and that is my unsecured page.\n\n443\n00:23:23.734 --> 00:23:27.414\nHTTPS, by default, port 443,\nthat is my secure connection.\n\n444\n00:23:27.414 --> 00:23:30.300\nAnd I need certificates in order for\nthat to work so\n\n445\n00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.910\nI can prove the identity of that server.\n\n446\n00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:38.360\nThe other thing I want to throw out\nhere next is some of the components.\n\n447\n00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:42.249\nRemember I said when I installed IIS,\nI didn't add everything.\n\n448\n00:23:42.249 --> 00:23:47.880\nSo if I go over here to Web Servers and\nfind my Web Services role,\n\n449\n00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:52.894\nthis is a list of all the role\nservices that I installed.\n\n450\n00:23:52.894 --> 00:23:56.170\nAnd you can see there are several\nthat are not installed.\n\n451\n00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:58.480\nFor example,\nI've got Windows Authentication.\n\n452\n00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.350\nThat's installed.\n\n453\n00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:02.100\nBut if I want to use\nBasic Authentication or\n\n454\n00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:05.010\nClient Certificate Mapping,\nI'm gonna have to add those features.\n\n455\n00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:07.350\nAnd if I want to add, or\nmaybe I want to run an FTP server.\n\n456\n00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:09.802\nI think I've already\ngot it installed there.\n\n457\n00:24:09.802 --> 00:24:12.900\nBut, yeah, if I wanted to run\nFTP I would have to add that.\n\n458\n00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:16.130\nAnd when we look at services\nlike this in 2008 R2, it's very,\n\n459\n00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:20.115\nwhat's a good way to say it?\n\n460\n00:24:20.115 --> 00:24:24.150\nComponentized or It's very modular,\nis a good way to say it.\n\n461\n00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:27.080\nYou have to pick and\nchoose the pieces that you want to use.\n\n462\n00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.670\nIt's not gonna install everything.\n\n463\n00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:32.270\nBecause if you're not running FTP,\nwhy install it, right?\n\n464\n00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:34.080\nThat's just a vulnerability.\n\n465\n00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.270\nThat you're not monitoring, not managing.\n\n466\n00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:38.870\nSo if you ever have to add or remove\ncomponents you can come over here and\n\n467\n00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:40.810\nchoose add role services.\n\n468\n00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:44.870\nAnd basically takes you right back to\nthe wizard that I used to install it but\n\n469\n00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:47.880\nit skips on to the role services screen.\n\n470\n00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:51.190\nSo if I want to add that basic\nauthentication I can come in here and\n\n471\n00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.790\ncheck it.\n\n472\n00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:54.870\nI can add that if I don't\nwant to do FTP anymore,\n\n473\n00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:58.380\nI'd have to use the other wizard that\nremoves rolls or removes features.\n\n474\n00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:01.270\nThen I click next and finish.\n\n475\n00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:06.320\nAnd it's going to add the ability to\ndo basic authentication, in this case.\n\n476\n00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.484\nAnd while that's running I'm gonna go\nback over to my web server because FTP,\n\n477\n00:25:10.484 --> 00:25:14.730\nwell actually, [INAUDIBLE], is another\nthing that we should be familiar with.\n\n478\n00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:20.810\nWe got web servers, WWW or\nHTTP but we also have FTP.\n\n479\n00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:23.470\nFTP is my file transfer protocol.\n\n480\n00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:27.500\nIIS in a Microsoft world does FTP as well.\n\n481\n00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:32.350\nAnd it's a way that you can transfer\nfiles without all the graphical overhead.\n\n482\n00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:36.215\nIn fact before we had\nthe World Wide Web as we know it now,\n\n483\n00:25:36.215 --> 00:25:41.419\nFTP was the protocol we used to\ncommunicate out there across the Internet.\n\n484\n00:25:41.419 --> 00:25:44.381\nI'm gonna go ahead and finish that up, and\n\n485\n00:25:44.381 --> 00:25:49.893\nI'm not running an FTP server on there,\nbut I do wanna show, where did that go,\n\n486\n00:25:49.893 --> 00:25:54.225\nhow it can connect over to an FTP\nserver and what it looks like.\n\n487\n00:25:54.225 --> 00:25:57.820\nftp.dell.com would be a good one.\n\n488\n00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:04.060\nIt'll take it a second and you can do\nthis from a command prompt as well.\n\n489\n00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:08.400\nI can go up to a terminal and\nI can say FTP and\n\n490\n00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:15.790\nI can type in open ftp.dell.com and\nit's gonna ask for my authentication.\n\n491\n00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:18.870\nSome FTP sites will allow\nanonymous authentication.\n\n492\n00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:20.035\nI'm not sure if they will.\n\n493\n00:26:24.038 --> 00:26:25.600\nAnonymous access allowed.\n\n494\n00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:29.200\nWhen you do anonymous access,\nyou're supposed to type in anonymous for\n\n495\n00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.540\nyour user name, and\nthen your email address for your password.\n\n496\n00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:34.190\nNot because they need that to log in,\n\n497\n00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:38.480\nthey don't know who you are,\nbut just out of courtesy.\n\n498\n00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:41.920\nThey can keep track of all their\nvisitors and things like that.\n\n499\n00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:46.850\nAnd Dell makes a lot of files available\nvia FTP, so if I want to do like\n\n500\n00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:51.190\na LS here, I can list all of the files\nthat they're making available.\n\n501\n00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:55.130\nBut notice it's not like browsing a pretty\nwebpage where I can click on a little drop\n\n502\n00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:59.420\ndown like this as I have a Dell\n960 show me the drivers for that.\n\n503\n00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.757\nIt's just a-\n>> A mess.\n\n504\n00:27:01.757 --> 00:27:05.570\n>> Exactly,\nthere is no pretty pictures to it, right.\n\n505\n00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:10.630\nI would have to know the exact\nname of what I was looking for.\n\n506\n00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:12.950\n>> Plus the command structure for\nit as well.\n\n507\n00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:14.710\nFTP has it's own commands.\n\n508\n00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:15.910\nYou need to know that.\n\n509\n00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:18.480\nWhereas, where,\nif you use a solution something like IIS,\n\n510\n00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.630\nI can just go to my browser.\n\n511\n00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:22.420\nType in FTP instead of HTTP.\n\n512\n00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:24.500\nThe web address, it opens up.\n\n513\n00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.330\nWe see the index in the files.\n\n514\n00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:29.133\nAnd with a nice, graphical\nrepresentation of all that stuff,\n\n515\n00:27:29.133 --> 00:27:30.525\nall I gotta do is click.\n\n516\n00:27:30.525 --> 00:27:32.765\nOkay, I want to go in this folder,\nI want to go in that.\n\n517\n00:27:32.765 --> 00:27:36.005\nIt's nothing dissimilar from any other\n\n518\n00:27:36.005 --> 00:27:38.665\ngraphical file structure we've\nencountered in the past.\n\n519\n00:27:38.665 --> 00:27:40.740\nIt becomes very, very simple to be used.\n\n520\n00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:44.870\nAnd that is one of the main reasons\nto use something like that in IS.\n\n521\n00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:46.070\nIt just makes it so much easier.\n\n522\n00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:50.210\n>> Yeah it's kind of funny how you can\nsee like on my terminal window here,\n\n523\n00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:54.070\nit's just listing out the files, listing\nout the files, listing out the files.\n\n524\n00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:57.862\nOn my browser,\nthat I'm trying to use as an FTP client,\n\n525\n00:27:57.862 --> 00:28:00.781\nit's still thinking about that, right?\n\n526\n00:28:00.781 --> 00:28:04.310\nI'm trying to think of a good\nway to say that, Daniel.\n\n527\n00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:07.390\nIt's still populating that list,\nbecause it's-\n\n528\n00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:08.270\n>> That's a lot of data.\n\n529\n00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:10.370\n>> Yeah.\nIt's a ton of data.\n\n530\n00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:13.130\nBut If we don't use a browser we're\nnot worried about all that kind of\n\n531\n00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:14.930\nstuff from a terminal window like this.\n\n532\n00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:16.360\nIt can be a whole lot faster.\n\n533\n00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.400\nA lot less overhead with FTP.\n\n534\n00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.760\nI'm gonna go ahead and close that.\n\n535\n00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.910\nSo FTP, you need to be familiar\nagain with the FTP name.\n\n536\n00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:26.890\nIt's file transfer protocol.\n\n537\n00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:33.015\nNeed to be familiar with WWW or\nyour World Wide Web and HTTP and HTTPS.\n\n538\n00:28:33.015 --> 00:28:36.975\nBy plain text, HTTP, port 80 by default.\n\n539\n00:28:36.975 --> 00:28:43.460\nBy secure SSL, my secure Socket Layer,\nHTTPS with port 443 by default.\n\n540\n00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:47.420\nYou have to understand that IIS is\nMicrosoft's Web service solution.\n\n541\n00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.060\nThat's how we create a web service.\n\n542\n00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:51.120\nWe install IIS.\n\n543\n00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:56.520\nIf I want to do a secure web page I need\nto issue a certificate to my server.\n\n544\n00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.940\nIn most environments if it's\ngonna be public facing,\n\n545\n00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:02.690\nI'm gonna wanna make sure that\nall my visitors trust it.\n\n546\n00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:06.240\nSo I'm gonna go to one of those places I\nshowed you listed Internet Explorer, and\n\n547\n00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:10.030\nmy trusted root certification authorities.\n\n548\n00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:13.390\nIf I'm gonna start a business and\nI want you to come to my website and\n\n549\n00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:16.310\nfeel comfortable putting your\ncredit card number in there,\n\n550\n00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:18.870\nI've gotta make sure that you\ndon't get that red warning, right?\n\n551\n00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:21.110\nI want you to get that green bar up there.\n\n552\n00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:25.057\nSo I'm gonna buy a certificate from one\nof those public companies like Bot or\n\n553\n00:29:25.057 --> 00:29:25.890\nVeriSign.\n\n554\n00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:29.250\nThat way I don't have to worry about it,\nyour computer already trusts it.\n\n555\n00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:32.810\nInside my organization,\nI might not wanna spend that money.\n\n556\n00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:36.570\nIf it's a website only used internally,\nall right, or\n\n557\n00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:38.740\nby my users when they're outside.\n\n558\n00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:41.990\nAnd I can tell them, hey,\nit's okay, trust it.\n\n559\n00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:44.340\nI can run my own certificate authority.\n\n560\n00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:46.340\nCertificate authority is\nwhat's responsible for\n\n561\n00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:47.900\ngenerating those certificates.\n\n562\n00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:49.500\nAnd I can issue those.\n\n563\n00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:52.010\nOr I can do just like\nI did on screen here.\n\n564\n00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:57.034\nI generated my own certificate,\non the fly, from the IIS interface.\n\n565\n00:29:57.034 --> 00:29:59.636\nAnd that will work, like I said,\nfine internally but not so\n\n566\n00:29:59.636 --> 00:30:01.110\ngood out there in the public.\n\n567\n00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:05.040\nSo, that's probably what we\nneed to know I think about IIS.\n\n568\n00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:08.245\nI mean, there's a lot more to it,\nbut this is not an IIS test,\n\n569\n00:30:08.245 --> 00:30:13.385\nwe just need to be familiar with the basic\nconcepts of running a web server.\n\n570\n00:30:13.385 --> 00:30:15.265\n>> Excellent stuff, he's absolutely right.\n\n571\n00:30:15.265 --> 00:30:18.215\nHopefully this episode has done that for\nyou.\n\n572\n00:30:18.215 --> 00:30:20.235\nIf it hasn't, well you know what,\nwatch it again.\n\n573\n00:30:20.235 --> 00:30:21.510\nWatch it again and again.\n\n574\n00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:25.090\nUntil you get these concepts down you're\ngonna want to get that hard-coded.\n\n575\n00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:29.900\nUnderstand exactly what it is that\na web server does or can do for us for\n\n576\n00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:30.810\nthat exam.\n\n577\n00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:33.290\nMike, thanks today for\nthe great demonstrations and\n\n578\n00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:34.682\nall the great explanations you gave us.\n\n579\n00:30:34.682 --> 00:30:36.380\n>> You're welcome.\n>> We really appreciate that.\n\n580\n00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:39.209\nAnd we appreciate your viewership,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n581\n00:30:39.209 --> 00:30:41.588\nFor ITPro Tv,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n582\n00:30:41.588 --> 00:30:42.379\n>> And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n583\n00:30:42.379 --> 00:30:43.482\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n584\n00:30:43.482 -->

excited as always.\n\n10\n00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.150\nWe got more MTA content coming your way,\ngood old server fundamentals.\n\n11\n00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.480\nAnd in this one we're gonna be looking\nat remote access, always a cool concept,\n\n12\n00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.360\ngreat idea, very handy for\n\n13\n00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.330\nseveral different reasons that we're gonna\ngo over and should be pretty exciting.\n\n14\n00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.160\n>> I'm looking forward to it.\n\n15\n00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.050\nRemote access, obviously it's,\nwell it's a good topic for\n\n16\n00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.350\nus to learn, cuz there's a lot of times\nthat you're gonna run into the, well,\n\n17\n00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.420\nyou know what, it's not really practical\nfor me to be able to go and actually\n\n18\n00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.880\nphysically sit down, behind a keyboard,\nmouse, and monitor of a computer.\n\n19\n00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.710\nWe're gonna need to remotely\naccess that system.\n\n20\n00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.590\nAnd well, Microsoft, they've come\nto our rescue on that as well.\n\n21\n00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.640\nThere are third party tools out there that\nyou may even experience in your career,\n\n22\n00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.630\nbut, a lot of times we end up falling\nback, I'll be honest with you,\n\n23\n00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.630\nwith the tools that Microsoft gives us.\n\n24\n00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.915\n>> Heresy, heresy!\nMicrosoft all the way!\n\n25\n00:01:09.915 --> 00:01:10.681\n>> All the way!\n\n26\n00:01:10.681 --> 00:01:13.260\n[LAUGH] Paid for by Microsoft.\n\n27\n00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.280\n>> That's right.\n[LAUGH] All right,\n\n28\n00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.630\nso let's talk about\ngood old remote access.\n\n29\n00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.190\nYou know when we're talking\nabout remote access,\n\n30\n00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.750\nobviously it kind of\nexplains itself right?\n\n31\n00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.800\nAccessing something remotely\nas Daniel was saying, and\n\n32\n00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.520\nthat's a very common\nthing that we have to do.\n\n33\n00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.470\nWhether that's us as an administrator or\n\n34\n00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.640\na help desk person needing to access\nservers that are in the server closet.\n\n35\n00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.860\nThey might not even be in the same\nbuilding or the same state or\n\n36\n00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.400\nthe same country, right.\n\n37\n00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.960\nI can remotely access those\nservers to administer them.\n\n38\n00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.450\nI might have to remotely access a client\nmachine so that I can fix a problem there,\n\n39\n00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.010\nbecause I can't very well jump in\nthe car and drive up to New York.\n\n40\n00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.870\nI mean, I'd love to, but I don't\nthink my company's going to pay for\n\n41\n00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.720\nthe three day trip, or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n42\n00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.810\nSo we can use that.\n\n43\n00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.670\nOr when people are outside\nof the office and\n\n44\n00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.120\nthey want to be able to access resources\nback in the corporate network.\n\n45\n00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.550\nThat would be another\ntype of remote access.\n\n46\n00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.450\nMaybe they're working from home.\n\n47\n00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.080\nMaybe they're at the hotel, or they're\ntraveling and they're at the airport.\n\n48\n00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.120\nOr whatever the case may be.\n\n49\n00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.240\nA client site and\nthey're remoting back into the network.\n\n50\n00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.890\nSo lots of different places\nwe're gonna see remote access.\n\n51\n00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.870\nAnd so let's start with probably\nthe most basic one, and\n\n52\n00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.550\nthat's gonna be remote desktop.\n\n53\n00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.070\nThis is a concept that most of us at this\npoint are probably familiar with, and\n\n54\n00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.320\nwhere the name, again,\nsays it all, remote desktop.\n\n55\n00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.480\nI'm gonna take a remote machine,\ntake its desktop and bring it back to me.\n\n56\n00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.780\nThat's essentially what we're doing.\n\n57\n00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.750\nI'm gonna have a window on my screen.\n\n58\n00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.943\nIn that window I'm gonna see\nthat remote machine's desktop,\n\n59\n00:02:46.943 --> 00:02:52.580\nand I can interact with it just like I\nwas sitting physically at that machine.\n\n60\n00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.370\nLet's see how we can do it.\n\n61\n00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.580\nLike I said,\nthis is a very common use is for,\n\n62\n00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.650\nremote administration of servers,\nand that's what we'll do here.\n\n63\n00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.520\nNow it does have to be set up, so if we\nlook my screen I go over to my server and\n\n64\n00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.900\nI can see that remote desktop\nis currently disabled.\n\n65\n00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.160\nSo I'm simply gonna go over here and\nclick Configure Remote Desktop,\n\n66\n00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.980\nopens up my System Properties\non the Remote Tab, handy enough.\n\n67\n00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.120\nDown here at the bottom I can\nsee Do Not Allow Connections.\n\n68\n00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.380\nSo I'm gonna choose to Allow Connections.\n\n69\n00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.990\nI've got two options here.\n\n70\n00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.990\nOne says less secure,\none says more secure.\n\n71\n00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.510\n>> Hm.\n\n72\n00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.130\n>> Which one should we use, Daniel?\n\n73\n00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.806\n>> Less secure.\n\n74\n00:03:26.806 --> 00:03:27.603\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Less secure.\n\n75\n00:03:27.603 --> 00:03:29.535\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's always the fun way to go, right?\n\n76\n00:03:29.535 --> 00:03:32.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you like living on the edge,\n\n77\n00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.160\nthat's the way to go.\n\n78\n00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:39.140\nNow, In all seriousness, this involves\nwhat we call network level authentication.\n\n79\n00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.400\nXP service pack three and later support\nthis network level authentication.\n\n80\n00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.560\nPrior to that, they do not.\n\n81\n00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.240\nSo, if you had to remote into these\nservers using down level clients,\n\n82\n00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.360\nyou would enable the option,\nthe less secure option.\n\n83\n00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.250\nIf everything's later than XP service\npack three, then you're good to go.\n\n84\n00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.030\nJust use the more secure one.\n\n85\n00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.520\nObviously that's gonna be a better route.\n\n86\n00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.170\nWhen you turn this on, it says it's\ngonna open up the firewall hole.\n\n87\n00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.900\nIt's gonna make an exception, or rule,\n\n88\n00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.640\nin my firewall to allow this\ntraffic to come into this server.\n\n89\n00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.670\nRemote desktop by default\nruns on port 3389.\n\n90\n00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.370\nSo, that's a good one.\n\n91\n00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.470\nAnd you can change that if you so desire.\n\n92\n00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.240\nI'll click OK.\n\n93\n00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.090\nAnd then the next thing I\nneed to do is decide who\n\n94\n00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.420\nis allowed to make this\nremote desktop connection.\n\n95\n00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.240\nAnybody in the local\nAdministrators group on the server\n\n96\n00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.500\nalready has access by\ndefault a local admins group\n\n97\n00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.440\nis part of what we call\nthe remote desktop users group.\n\n98\n00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.820\nThat is a local group on the server.\n\n99\n00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.000\nI can add anybody else I would need to,\n\n100\n00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.540\nwhoever maybe I had the help desk or\nwhomever I want to remote into the server.\n\n101\n00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.670\nI'm logged on as the admin, so I'm just\ngonna go ahead and click OK, and OK.\n\n102\n00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.590\nAnd now Remote Desktop is enabled.\n\n103\n00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.690\nSo I'm gonna flip over to my client,\nand I'm gonna fire up Remote Desktop.\n\n104\n00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.820\nSo we'll find our good old remote\ndesktop connection, built into Windows,\n\n105\n00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.930\nit's nothing I had to download,\nit's part of my OS.\n\n106\n00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.060\nAnd then I can type in either the name or\nthe IP address and\n\n107\n00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.520\nsince I don't remember the name\nwe'll do 10.1.1.0 203.\n\n108\n00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.900\nI think I remember the IP address.\n\n109\n00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.430\nWe'll click Connect, and there we go.\n\n110\n00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.240\nIt's asking me for my credentials so\nI'll type in my super secret password.\n\n111\n00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:32.460\nAnd hopefully if all goes well,\nmy connection will be established.\n\n112\n00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.790\nSo we'll let it whir and\ngrind in the background, here.\n\n113\n00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.340\nIt's thinking about it.\n\n114\n00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.580\nSometimes it can take a minute.\n\n115\n00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.380\nIt shouldn't.\n\n116\n00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.430\nI'm on the same network as\nthe server here in this case.\n\n117\n00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.680\nThere we go.\n\n118\n00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.520\nNow this is telling me, remember,\nnetwork level authentication.\n\n119\n00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.990\nMy computer is saying hey,\nprove to me who you are.\n\n120\n00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.280\nLet's do some authentication and\n\n121\n00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.490\nIt's presenting a certificate\nthat my computer doesn't trust.\n\n122\n00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.130\nAnd that's because in my test environment\nI haven't set up something called\n\n123\n00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.240\na certificate authority, and\nissued trusted certificates to everybody.\n\n124\n00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.200\nSo in the real world,\nif you see this you want to stop and\n\n125\n00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.310\nthink, do you know that server,\ndo you trust it?\n\n126\n00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.960\nIf so, go ahead and click yes.\n\n127\n00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.920\nIf you don't, click no, right?\n\n128\n00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.890\nDon't make that connection to that server.\n\n129\n00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:17.490\nSo I'll go ahead and connect.\n\n130\n00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.010\nAnd I could have added that\ncertificate to my trusted route and\n\n131\n00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.360\nthen in the future I wouldn't\nget that warning again.\n\n132\n00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.370\nSo, slowly but surely.\n\n133\n00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.200\nMan, it is taking its time this morning.\n\n134\n00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.490\nIt going to establish this\nremote desktop connection.\n\n135\n00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:32.060\nThere we go.\n\n136\n00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.982\n>> It hasn't had its coffee this morning,\nMichalel obviously.\n\n137\n00:06:33.982 --> 00:06:35.220\n>> [LAUGH] Evidently not, right?\n\n138\n00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.590\nWe'll have to boil up a second pot, here.\n\n139\n00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:38.730\nAnd there we go.\n\n140\n00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.750\nThis is the server's desktop, right?\n\n141\n00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.990\nI can see server manager here.\n\n142\n00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.050\nAnd I could do whatever I wanted.\n\n143\n00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.880\nIf I wanted to go in and\nadd Roles, I can launch wizards.\n\n144\n00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.660\nI can do whatever I want and\nnotice it's in a window.\n\n145\n00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:57.680\nIf I minimize this or restore down,\nyou'll see here's my Windows 7 desktop.\n\n146\n00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.470\nIn this window is that server's desktop.\n\n147\n00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:01.819\n>> Reminds me of that Portal game.\n\n148\n00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:04.520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Kind of looking through to\n\n149\n00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.750\nsomewhere else.\n\n150\n00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.290\nAnd that's the basic idea really,\nis that we're sitting here and\n\n151\n00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:14.590\nI kind of am looking through a window into\nanother computer and having access to it.\n\n152\n00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:16.370\nAnd when you fullscreen it,\n\n153\n00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.440\nit's kind of like you're sticking your\nhands through it with your keyboard,\n\n154\n00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.614\nmouse, and monitor and controlling\nthat server, gaining that access.\n\n155\n00:07:21.614 --> 00:07:22.640\nAnd I'll tell you what,\n\n156\n00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.980\nI've used this a lot in server\nadministration because a lot of times,\n\n157\n00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.010\nservers specifically production servers,\nthey don't like you to mess with them.\n\n158\n00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.320\nEspecially things like updates,\n\n159\n00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.750\nlike additional software,\nI can't take them down.\n\n160\n00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.710\nI've got to do things after hours.\n\n161\n00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.270\nWell, where am I after hours?\n\n162\n00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:40.010\nI'm at home.\n\n163\n00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.352\nI'm not going to sit at work for\nhours on end and\n\n164\n00:07:42.352 --> 00:07:46.335\nwait until everybody leaves until it's\na convenient time for me to go to work.\n\n165\n00:07:46.335 --> 00:07:49.636\nNo, I'll go home, eat dinner and\nthen I'll take up my laptop,\n\n166\n00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:52.633\nI'll create a connection,\nprobably a VPN connection and\n\n167\n00:07:52.633 --> 00:07:55.401\nI'll remote desktop into\nthe service that I need to.\n\n168\n00:07:55.401 --> 00:07:57.598\nDo some work on and go to town on them.\n\n169\n00:07:57.598 --> 00:07:58.237\n>> Absolutely.\n\n170\n00:07:58.237 --> 00:08:03.100\nThat is a big time saver, makes it so\nconvenient to manage these servers.\n\n171\n00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.640\nEven when I'm in the same building,\n\n172\n00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.060\nmy server closet is just\naround the corner from me.\n\n173\n00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.855\nA couple doors and\na hallway down and I'm there.\n\n174\n00:08:09.855 --> 00:08:11.565\nWhy?\nWhy am I gonna get up, walk in,\n\n175\n00:08:11.565 --> 00:08:13.285\ngo unlock the server closet?\n\n176\n00:08:13.285 --> 00:08:15.615\nIt's noisy, it's cold in there.\n\n177\n00:08:15.615 --> 00:08:18.565\nGonna pull out that crazy KVM,\nand work with that.\n\n178\n00:08:18.565 --> 00:08:21.870\nWhy not sit here at the comfort\nof my cubicle in my little\n\n179\n00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.420\ncrappy chair they give me.\n\n180\n00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.830\nAnd remote into those severs and\nmanage them this way, right?\n\n181\n00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:28.900\nSo, very very convenient.\n\n182\n00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.480\nIf we look at the server,\nnotice it's locked,\n\n183\n00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:35.230\nit locked the screen\nfrom this perspective.\n\n184\n00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:39.260\nWith servers licensing they call\nthat out on the objectives.\n\n185\n00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:44.220\nI want you to keep in mind, with remote\ndesktop, you get two licenses to connect\n\n186\n00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:48.420\nto a sever via remote desktop\nwithout any additional licensing.\n\n187\n00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.580\nIn other words,\nif you buy server 2008 r2 and\n\n188\n00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:54.710\nyou install it,\nthat includes two remote desktop licenses.\n\n189\n00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:58.130\nThat means two administrators\ncan be remoted into that server\n\n190\n00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:59.390\nsimultaneously, right?\n\n191\n00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.150\nAnd administering that server.\n\n192\n00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:06.930\nIf any more than that need to access\nthat server simultaneously or\n\n193\n00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:11.400\nconcurrently, you are gonna need to do\nsome remote desktop licenses for that.\n\n194\n00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.770\nThat gets into remote desktop services,\n\n195\n00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.830\nor what used to be known\nas terminal services.\n\n196\n00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.740\nBut we get two for\nadministration purposes, and\n\n197\n00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.710\nif that's all we're doing, then we don't\nneed to worry about anything else.\n\n198\n00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:25.210\nNow, the other thing I want to keep,\nshow you guys,\n\n199\n00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:28.590\nif you, I'm just gonna open\nup a couple of things here.\n\n200\n00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:29.180\nRight?\n\n201\n00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.950\nWhen you end a remote desktop session,\n\n202\n00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:32.900\nthere is two ways I can\ngo about doing that.\n\n203\n00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.310\nI could log off.\n\n204\n00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.160\nRight?\nI am going to log off of my\n\n205\n00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.930\nremote desktop session.\n\n206\n00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:42.590\nOr I could close this window, and\nyou might think, well, same thing.\n\n207\n00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:43.330\nRight?\n\n208\n00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:43.880\nNo.\n\n209\n00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.140\nRight?\nIf you just close this window,\n\n210\n00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.320\nit's gonna disconnect your session.\n\n211\n00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.460\nBut, everything on that\nserver's still running.\n\n212\n00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:51.090\nAll right?\n\n213\n00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:54.010\nIf I flip over to the server,\nand I go and I log in,\n\n214\n00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:57.240\nyou can see administrator\nis still showing logged in.\n\n215\n00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.893\nAnd, if I log into that.\n\n216\n00:09:59.893 --> 00:10:00.811\nAll right?\n\n217\n00:10:00.811 --> 00:10:04.797\nThere's the windows that I had opened\nbefore I closed the window on my client\n\n218\n00:10:04.797 --> 00:10:06.230\nmachine, right?\n\n219\n00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:08.310\nSo, something we've gotta keep in mind.\n\n220\n00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:12.570\nRemember, you only get two licenses for\nremote administration by default.\n\n221\n00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:16.440\nSo, if Daniel comes in, in the morning,\nremotes into that server,\n\n222\n00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.110\ncloses his window, but\ndoesn't kill his session, and then,\n\n223\n00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:22.980\nlater on Nate remotes into that server and\ndoes the same thing.\n\n224\n00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.320\nCloses his window but doesn't log off.\n\n225\n00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.880\nAnd then, later on,\nI try to remote into that server.\n\n226\n00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.730\nIt's gonna say, nope, stop, you've\nalready got two connections established.\n\n227\n00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:32.870\nThat's all I can do.\n\n228\n00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.750\nNow, I gotta go find Daniel, go find Nate.\n\n229\n00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:39.960\nTry to get them to disconnect or try to\nforce their connection to end somehow.\n\n230\n00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.570\nThey could lose work if they\nhaven't saved something.\n\n231\n00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:43.490\nBecomes a real nightmare.\n\n232\n00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.050\nSo make sure if you need\nsomething to continue running,\n\n233\n00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:48.730\nlike you've run a script, and\nit's a long running script.\n\n234\n00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:49.940\nClose that window, and let it run.\n\n235\n00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:50.930\nThat's fine.\n\n236\n00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:54.360\nBut if you're done,\nlog off, kill your session.\n\n237\n00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.520\nMake sure you don't clog up\nall those other sessions.\n\n238\n00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:02.180\nAll right now, remoting into\na client machine, same thing really.\n\n239\n00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:03.040\nLet's take a look at this,\n\n240\n00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:08.560\nI've got a second client here I do need to\nmake sure that remote access in enabled.\n\n241\n00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:14.730\nOr remote desktop, so I'm going to pull up\nthe properties of this client machine and\n\n242\n00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:20.220\nI'm going to go to my remote settings,\nand I'm going to allow remote desktop.\n\n243\n00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.650\nAnd again, I could select users but\n\n244\n00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:25.120\nI know anybody in the local admins\ngroup is automatically given access.\n\n245\n00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.860\nSo I click OK and that should make\nmy firewall exception for me.\n\n246\n00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.840\nI have seen a couple\ntimes where it does not.\n\n247\n00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:37.060\nLet's just go double check that if we\ngo firewall, we'll take a look at my\n\n248\n00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:42.350\ninbound rules and let's see if we have\nsome remote desktop enabled here.\n\n249\n00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:50.590\nWe come down here there's remote\nassistance and remote desktop tcpn for\n\n250\n00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:55.270\nthe domain and private profile is enabled\nso it did what it was supposed to do.\n\n251\n00:11:55.270 --> 00:12:00.813\nNow if I flip over to here Same thing,\nremote desktop connection and\n\n252\n00:12:00.813 --> 00:12:06.566\nthe IP address of that guy if I\ncan remember, 1.1.52 I believe.\n\n253\n00:12:06.566 --> 00:12:07.866\nAnd I'll authenticate.\n\n254\n00:12:11.928 --> 00:12:14.460\nAnd then we wait, right.\n\n255\n00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.860\nIt's doing that network level\nauthentication in the background.\n\n256\n00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.160\nIt's gonna say,\nI don't like that certificate.\n\n257\n00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.500\nAre you sure you want to connect?\n\n258\n00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.440\nAnd what I want to show you here,\nyou know?\n\n259\n00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.820\nServer management, great.\n\n260\n00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.340\nRemote desktop, fantastic.\n\n261\n00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:26.630\nAnd I'll go ahead and click, yes.\n\n262\n00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:27.310\nI could say, you know?\n\n263\n00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:29.130\nDon't ask me again for this connection.\n\n264\n00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:30.960\nOr again, I could trust that certificate.\n\n265\n00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.320\nRemote desktop for fixing a client PC.\n\n266\n00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.300\nGood as well, right?\n\n267\n00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.140\nHere I am, remoted into that machine.\n\n268\n00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:39.710\nI can see its desktop.\n\n269\n00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:41.540\nI could do whatever I wanted,\njust like [INAUDIBLE].\n\n270\n00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:42.710\n>> Your background is gone.\n\n271\n00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:46.890\n>> My background is gone, it is something\nyou can adjust in the settings,\n\n272\n00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:49.440\nyou could say,\nI wanna bring all the pretty stuff.\n\n273\n00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.580\nIt will remove some of that\nto keep performance up,\n\n274\n00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:58.180\nbut if you got a good fat bandwidth pipe\nthere you could turn that stuff back on.\n\n275\n00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.110\nAll right, but for fixing a PC.\n\n276\n00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:04.330\nIf I'm help desk I wanna remote into that,\nsomebody's called me up saying,\n\n277\n00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.600\nhey I'm having problem with this machine,\ncan you help me?\n\n278\n00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.670\nI could remote desktop into their\nmachine and try to fix their problem.\n\n279\n00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:14.230\nThe downside of it is though,\nis look what happened to their machine.\n\n280\n00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:15.370\nThis is what they're gonna be looking at.\n\n281\n00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:17.640\nThey're gonna say hey,\ncan you remote in and fix it?\n\n282\n00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.340\nI say sure, let me get in there.\n\n283\n00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:24.120\nAnd they get logged out,\nwhich means I can fix their problem.\n\n284\n00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:28.760\nI can sit here and do whatever it\nis I want on their desktop, right?\n\n285\n00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.470\nBut they can't see what I'm doing.\n\n286\n00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:34.100\nWhich is a problem for\na couple of reasons.\n\n287\n00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:38.670\nOne, depending on the situation, and\nif you're a support technician that\n\n288\n00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:42.180\ndoesn't work for the company,\nthey've hired you to be their support.\n\n289\n00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.220\nThey may not like you\nbeing into that machine,\n\n290\n00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:45.520\nwhere they can't see what you're doing.\n\n291\n00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.120\nThat makes them a little nervous.\n\n292\n00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.710\nTwo, I can't teach the user anything.\n\n293\n00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:51.890\nIn a corporate environment\nwhere I'm help desk,\n\n294\n00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:56.520\nif I'm fixing a problem on a user's\nmachine, I like to try to teach them.\n\n295\n00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:00.900\nBecause, I can, say, maybe prevent calls\nin the future for the same problem.\n\n296\n00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.120\nThis does not allow me to do that.\n\n297\n00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.510\nI can't share the session.\n\n298\n00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.900\nBut I could fix whatever\nit was I needed to fix.\n\n299\n00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:08.540\nAgain.\n\n300\n00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:09.420\n>> I was gonna say, Mike,\n\n301\n00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:13.460\nit also gives you the other caveat\nof kinda the other way around.\n\n302\n00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.040\nThe user can't help you, right?\n\n303\n00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.730\nThey can't, you can't go,\nis it on the left side of the screen,\n\n304\n00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:19.380\nis the right screen,\nis this it, is that it,.\n\n305\n00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.880\nThey can't see anything,\nwhere you're moving the mouse,\n\n306\n00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.130\nare you in the correct area?\n\n307\n00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:24.510\nThey don't know.\n\n308\n00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:28.030\nAll they see is that Control+Alt+Delete,\nthis computer is locked screen.\n\n309\n00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:29.710\nWhat are we supposed to do?\n\n310\n00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:30.900\n>> That's a great point.\n\n311\n00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:34.320\nHow are they gonna explain the problems\nto you if all they see is that screen?\n\n312\n00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.450\n>> Same thing is,\n\n313\n00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:41.650\nwith the server, I wanna make sure I\nlog off and not just close the windows,\n\n314\n00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:44.830\nespecially on a client because I don't\nget two connections, I only get one.\n\n315\n00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.860\nAnd they wouldn't be able to log on or\n\n316\n00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:51.680\nthey would have to kick me off in order to\nlog back into their machine, all right.\n\n317\n00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.700\nNow that I've logged off,\n\n318\n00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:57.490\nthey could log back in and,\nhopefully, the problem is fixed.\n\n319\n00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:59.180\nAnd now I've gotta wait for\nthem to call me back and\n\n320\n00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.460\ntell me if I actually fixed their problem.\n\n321\n00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.120\nAlright, so that's remote desktop.\n\n322\n00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:07.390\nThere is another solution we can\nuse that's particularly useful\n\n323\n00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:11.760\nwhen it comes to helping end-users and\nthat's known as remote assistance.\n\n324\n00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:16.510\nSimilar to remote desktop, the big\ndifference is it's a shared session,\n\n325\n00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:21.460\nrather than being a one person,\nlike we just saw, remote assistance allows\n\n326\n00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:26.450\nme to view their screen while\nthey're viewing it, all right?\n\n327\n00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:28.130\nSo let's see how that works.\n\n328\n00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.060\nI'm gonna come over here to the one\nwith the pretty background.\n\n329\n00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.860\nWe're gonna say this is my end user,\ncuz you know they gotta have their fancy\n\n330\n00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.730\nbackgrounds, and their dogs,\nand their kids, or whatever.\n\n331\n00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.370\nAnd what they would do, if they need help\n\n332\n00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:42.380\nthen they can simply go to their\nmachine and look for remote assistance.\n\n333\n00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:46.681\nAnd it'll take just a second for\nthis to fire up.\n\n334\n00:15:46.681 --> 00:15:50.512\nWhat they need to do is they need to\ncreate what's called an invitation.\n\n335\n00:15:50.512 --> 00:15:54.889\nAnd then they're gonna send that\ninvitation to me or to the help desk.\n\n336\n00:15:54.889 --> 00:15:57.315\nI'm gonna respond to that invitation and\n\n337\n00:15:57.315 --> 00:16:02.420\nit's gonna allow me to connect to their\nmachine and see what they're seeing.\n\n338\n00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.650\nAnd it's going to give us a chat room.\n\n339\n00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:07.190\nHere we go, so\ninvite someone you trust to help you.\n\n340\n00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.480\nAnd I'm gonna save it as a file.\n\n341\n00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.600\nYou could see,\nyou can use email to send the invitation,\n\n342\n00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.530\nthere is something called Easy Connect,\nwhere if you're on the same network,\n\n343\n00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:21.010\nit should be able to locate\nthe machine that's asking for help.\n\n344\n00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:22.520\nI'm gonna do the invitation file.\n\n345\n00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.320\nIt's just a more common way doing it.\n\n346\n00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.370\nBut you can also IM these invitations.\n\n347\n00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:29.280\nThere's many different\nways that you can do this.\n\n348\n00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:34.110\nSo, I'll save this guy as a file and I'm\njust gonna dump it out on my desktop so\n\n349\n00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:36.280\nI can find it real easy.\n\n350\n00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:39.770\nActually, you know what I'm gonna put it,\nyeah we'll put it on the desktop.\n\n351\n00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:42.670\nJust call it invitation,\nthat's fine, and I'll click Save.\n\n352\n00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.600\nAnd then here's the password.\n\n353\n00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:49.540\nIt generates a password so that if\nsomebody else finds this invitation.\n\n354\n00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:50.640\nLet's say I email it out and\n\n355\n00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:54.020\nsomebody intercepts that email, make\nsure you don't send the invitation and\n\n356\n00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:58.250\nthe password in the same email because\nthen it wouldn't do as much good.\n\n357\n00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:02.060\nBut hopefully I've sent them the\ninvitation via email, I've called them and\n\n358\n00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:05.510\ngive them the password or\nIM them a separate channel so\n\n359\n00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:08.170\nthat somebody can't intercept both.\n\n360\n00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:10.940\nAnd then all I would do is need\nto give them that invitation.\n\n361\n00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:16.210\nNow I'm gonna cheat here in this,\nif I can remember my keystrokes,\n\n362\n00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:19.880\nI'm on Windows so we've got our,\nlet's copy that and\n\n363\n00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.510\nI'm going to put this in a little share\nthat both of these machines have.\n\n364\n00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:25.410\nNormally, again, I'd email it to them or\n\n365\n00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:30.360\nmaybe there's a share on a file server\nthat I dump it in or what have you and\n\n366\n00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:35.190\nthen the helpdesk person, me, says,\nhey, I've got a new invitation.\n\n367\n00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:38.380\nI'm gonna come in here and\nsay there's that invitation.\n\n368\n00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:39.890\nSomebody needs my help.\n\n369\n00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:44.004\nSo I'm gonna double-click on that,\nwait for this guy to open up.\n\n370\n00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:49.350\nSlowly but surely.\n\n371\n00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:51.120\nAnd then I'll need this password, so\n\n372\n00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.110\nI might as well write that down while I'm\nwaiting for that invitation to open up.\n\n373\n00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:59.255\nWell, we got got five,\nbravo, juliet, niner,\n\n374\n00:17:59.255 --> 00:18:05.980\nfour, kilo, tango, lima,\nbravo, niner delta, lima.\n\n375\n00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:07.918\n>> Roger that gold leader.\n\n376\n00:18:07.918 --> 00:18:09.810\n>> [LAUGH] Anyway [SOUND].\n\n377\n00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:12.220\n>> Right, all right, there we go.\n\n378\n00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:16.940\nAnd now I've got my dialogue box for my\npassword, so again we'll do that one more\n\n379\n00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:22.190\ntime, five, bravo, gilliard, niner, four,\n\n380\n00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:26.970\nkilo, tango, lima, bravo,\nniner, delta, lima.\n\n381\n00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:28.230\nHopefully, I got all that right.\n\n382\n00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:31.580\nWe'll click OK,\nif I didn't it won't connect.\n\n383\n00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:33.980\nIf I did, it should connect.\n\n384\n00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:36.630\nNow, at this point, me the helper or\n\n385\n00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:40.030\nthe one that's trying to provide\nhelp put the password in.\n\n386\n00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:41.810\nOn the helpee side, it says hey,\n\n387\n00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:45.040\nthe person you invited is now trying\nto connect do you want to let them?\n\n388\n00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.540\nMaybe you're in the middle of something\nand you're like, not right now.\n\n389\n00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:50.250\nSorry I sent you that invitation but\nI can't do that right now.\n\n390\n00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:51.929\nI could say no, I'm going to say yes.\n\n391\n00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:58.450\nAll right, and\nnow if I flip back over to my screen,\n\n392\n00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:03.240\nI can see their window in my screen.\n\n393\n00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:07.570\nSo if we make a new icon out here for\nsomething, I don't know,\n\n394\n00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:12.610\nlet's just make a new file,\na new folder, all right?\n\n395\n00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:17.028\nAs it pops up right here, I'm seeing\nwhat they're doing in real time.\n\n396\n00:19:17.028 --> 00:19:21.120\nIf I wanna chat with them,\nI can type in chat here, and\n\n397\n00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.520\nnow I have this chat window.\n\n398\n00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:28.130\nI can say, so\nwhat seems to be the problem?\n\n399\n00:19:30.708 --> 00:19:32.640\nAnd I can click Send.\n\n400\n00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.420\nOn their end, it's kinda weird now,\nyou have to be careful.\n\n401\n00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:39.010\nYou're seeing your stuff come\nup on their screen, right?\n\n402\n00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:42.155\nAnd I've so many times tried to click and\ntype in here, it's crazy.\n\n403\n00:19:42.155 --> 00:19:44.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> On their end they can say I'm having\n\n404\n00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:48.540\na problem with blah, blah,\nblah and they can send it back.\n\n405\n00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:52.340\nAnd we can sit here and chat back and\nforth and they can walk me through it.\n\n406\n00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:54.730\nNotice I can't control their screen.\n\n407\n00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:56.190\nBut I can tell them what to do and\n\n408\n00:19:56.190 --> 00:20:01.380\nI can watch what they're doing and\nguide them through the process.\n\n409\n00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:05.550\nIf it gets to the point where I\ncan't help them that way, right?\n\n410\n00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:09.280\nI'm trying to tell them go here and\nclick on this.\n\n411\n00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.680\nYou know what, can I take over, right?\n\n412\n00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:16.610\nI can say request control, cuz we all\nknow sometimes we try to help that user,\n\n413\n00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:19.450\nwe're trying to tell him to click,\nand they're going the other way and\n\n414\n00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:21.170\nthey're, what do you mean, right-click?\n\n415\n00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:24.710\n>> It's the Start button, no, the left.\n\n416\n00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:25.590\nYour other left.\n\n417\n00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:26.410\nGo to the bot note.\n\n418\n00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:29.105\nNever mind, just give me control,\njust give me control.\n\n419\n00:20:29.105 --> 00:20:32.160\n>> Exactly, so\nif we flip back over here it says,\n\n420\n00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.910\nhey this person has asked to\ntake control of your machine.\n\n421\n00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:37.820\nNotice it's in their hands.\n\n422\n00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:38.800\nI couldn't force it.\n\n423\n00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.660\nI couldn't say I'm taking\ncontrol of your machine, right?\n\n424\n00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:46.030\nThey have to agree to it, which it\ngives them that level of confidence,\n\n425\n00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:48.440\nbecause they can say, yes, if they want.\n\n426\n00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:52.470\nBut at any time they can click\nStop Sharing or Stop Control,\n\n427\n00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:54.850\nthey can hit Escape and\nit'll kill my controls.\n\n428\n00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:58.940\nSo, if they think I'm getting into their\npersonal stuff they can stop my control.\n\n429\n00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.870\nNow I can move things on their window,\nright.\n\n430\n00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:04.230\nAnd I can try to fix the problem for them.\n\n431\n00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:11.180\nThe other thing I can't do is\nI can not send files, right?\n\n432\n00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:15.828\nI can't drag and drop files onto here,\nbut I can ask them.\n\n433\n00:21:15.828 --> 00:21:20.633\nLet's see if I can figure, where did they\n\n434\n00:21:20.633 --> 00:21:26.100\nhide that, maybe not my file option is.\n\n435\n00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:31.120\nBut I'm not allowed to send files\nto them without their consent,\n\n436\n00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.090\nand I can't take files from them.\n\n437\n00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:38.010\nI can't take this invitation,\nall right, for example.\n\n438\n00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:41.600\nAnd I can't try to drag\nthis off of their screen.\n\n439\n00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:44.730\nWell, now it's really mad at me.\n\n440\n00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:45.825\n>> You made it angry.\n\n441\n00:21:45.825 --> 00:21:48.990\n>> [INAUDIBLE] I've messed up,\nit's all squeezed up here.\n\n442\n00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:52.379\nAnyway, it's not gonna let me do it.\n\n443\n00:21:52.379 --> 00:21:54.150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And it's definitely not gonna let me do\n\n444\n00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:55.480\nit now, right?\n\n445\n00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.580\nWithout their consents.\n\n446\n00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:01.730\nSo again, it's just a very\n\n447\n00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:06.100\nhandy way to help that end user,\nwe already have our mode session open yet.\n\n448\n00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.750\nI thought I was trying to click on that.\n\n449\n00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:10.850\nWhich I might have accidentally so\nlet me try.\n\n450\n00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:16.030\nAnd see I can't drag that off of there and\ndump it onto my desktop.\n\n451\n00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:17.780\nI can't drag things over here.\n\n452\n00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:20.220\nNotice I got the big no symbol there.\n\n453\n00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:24.160\nIt's not gonna allow me to do that.\n\n454\n00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.190\nLet's see what else we wanna do.\n\n455\n00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:29.260\nAnd that's pretty much remote assistance.\n\n456\n00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:33.500\nAgain, the big thing here is the fact\nthat we're sharing this session.\n\n457\n00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:37.120\nThat's the difference from remote\ndesktop and remote assistance.\n\n458\n00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.790\nThey can see what I'm doing.\n\n459\n00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:42.030\nIf I get control,\nif they wanna give me control and\n\n460\n00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:43.650\nit's a great teaching tool, right.\n\n461\n00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:47.550\nI'm gonna click stop sharing and\nwe'll see on the other end of things.\n\n462\n00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:54.280\nI have lost control, I'm no longer,\nall I'm doing is viewing the screen there.\n\n463\n00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.760\nSo they've killed my remote control.\n\n464\n00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.150\nAnd when they're done and\n\n465\n00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:01.660\nthey don't want any more help\nthey just start closing this out.\n\n466\n00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:07.600\nand like see here I have lost the remote\nassistance connection has ended and\n\n467\n00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.010\nI can no longer see their screen.\n\n468\n00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:11.010\nSo the cool thing is I can teach them.\n\n469\n00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:12.980\nI can help them and they're in control.\n\n470\n00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.050\nIt gives them that sense of security.\n\n471\n00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:17.990\n>> Yes, it's a, it's a very nice option\nespecially if you work on something like\n\n472\n00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:19.010\na help desk.\n\n473\n00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:23.840\nOr you're a top level help desk support,\nmaybe they need to bump something up.\n\n474\n00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.030\nYou gotta take a look at other\npeoples' screen at a remote location.\n\n475\n00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:31.430\nAnd even if you were at the same location,\na lot of times it's just not practical for\n\n476\n00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:33.870\nyou to go to the desk and sit down.\n\n477\n00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:34.630\nThat's all you would do.\n\n478\n00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:39.231\nYou'd definitely get your pedometer\n[LAUGH] plenty of steps for that day, but\n\n479\n00:23:39.231 --> 00:23:41.940\nagain it's just really\nnot a practical solution.\n\n480\n00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:46.240\nNow speaking of not practical solutions,\nwe did talk about Desktop Connection for\n\n481\n00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.300\nwhen we need to administer\nmaybe some server.\n\n482\n00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:49.968\nNow that does work.\n\n483\n00:23:49.968 --> 00:23:51.184\nIt is handy dandy, but\n\n484\n00:23:51.184 --> 00:23:54.578\nthere are times when that is not\na practical solution for that.\n\n485\n00:23:54.578 --> 00:23:59.329\nSpecifically if Say Mike and I are both\nadministrating the same server and\n\n486\n00:23:59.329 --> 00:24:03.670\nmaybe we've got a couple of\nother administrators as well.\n\n487\n00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:05.510\nNow, how do we do RDP, right?\n\n488\n00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:08.490\nWe only have two connections,\nwe could buy more licensing for that but\n\n489\n00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:09.920\nthat might get too costly.\n\n490\n00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:13.990\nNow, the cool thing is is that Microsoft\nagain has realized that not everyone's\n\n491\n00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:17.770\ngonna chuck the wall and\nopen for all those licenses.\n\n492\n00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:19.290\n>> They've created a set of tools for\n\n493\n00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:25.100\nus to be able to use our systems to\nremotely administrate a different server.\n\n494\n00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:26.760\nEven though we're not\nsitting at that server.\n\n495\n00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.290\nAnd it's not in the same way in which\nwe've been showing them, right.\n\n496\n00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:31.530\n>> Yep, absolutely, and it's really cool.\n\n497\n00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:35.500\nWhen you look at a server, let's flip over\nhere and take a look at maybe this guy.\n\n498\n00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.170\nThis is my domain controller.\n\n499\n00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:38.510\nSo, he's got a couple rolls installed.\n\n500\n00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:40.690\nHe's got active directory domain services.\n\n501\n00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:41.770\nAnd DNS.\n\n502\n00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:45.660\nSince, those roles are installed\nthen I have tools to manage them.\n\n503\n00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:48.960\nI have active directory tools here,\nI have DNS and\n\n504\n00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:52.830\nI can launch that DNS console and\ni'm good to go, alright.\n\n505\n00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:57.760\nBut from my client I don't have any of\nthat, I don't have my DNS console or\n\n506\n00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.080\nmy active directory console or\nanything like that.\n\n507\n00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:04.250\nAs Daniel said, we might not want to use\nRemote Desktop cuz we've got too many\n\n508\n00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:06.340\npeople trying to get into those servers.\n\n509\n00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:09.930\nMaybe we don't want to open\nup those default RDP cords.\n\n510\n00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:10.790\nWho knows what.\n\n511\n00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:12.640\nWe don't want the licensing, and\n\n512\n00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:16.550\nthe other reason would be, maybe I've\ngot somebody that's in charge of DNS.\n\n513\n00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:19.670\nAnd I wanna give them\nthe ability to manage DNS.\n\n514\n00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:21.550\nBut they can't manage active directory.\n\n515\n00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:22.620\nThey can't manage DHCP.\n\n516\n00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:27.460\nThere's other things on that server, that\nI don't want them even trying to access.\n\n517\n00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:28.210\nRight?\n\n518\n00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:29.870\nWhat I can do instead, is say hey,\n\n519\n00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:33.310\nlook you sit at your client\nat your little cubicle there.\n\n520\n00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:36.680\nAnd I'm going to put the DNS\nconsole on your computer for you.\n\n521\n00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:41.200\nAnd that DNS console is gonna point,\nreach out, and talk to that DNS server.\n\n522\n00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.980\nSo, you'll be able to manage DNS.\n\n523\n00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:45.380\nBut, you're not seeing the entire desktop,\nright.\n\n524\n00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:47.590\nAll you're seeing is DNS.\n\n525\n00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:50.410\nThat's the idea behind what I'm\ngetting ready to show you now.\n\n526\n00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:55.110\nAnd it's known as the remote server\nadministration tools, RSAT for short.\n\n527\n00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:57.380\nYou can download these from Microsoft.\n\n528\n00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:01.590\nI've already downloaded them and installed\nthem because it does take a little bit.\n\n529\n00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:04.640\nBut, you can see here,\nthis is actually the update.\n\n530\n00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:09.460\nIt is a Windows update as you download\nfrom Microsoft, you run that and in solid,\n\n531\n00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:14.400\nand that adds all those administrative\nconsoles to my client operating system.\n\n532\n00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.400\nYou do have to be careful.\n\n533\n00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.960\nMake sure you get the right version.\n\n534\n00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.180\nThis is Windows 8.\n\n535\n00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:19.240\nI'm sorry.\n\n536\n00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.090\nWindows 7 so\n\n537\n00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:24.770\nI had to make sure I downloaded the remote\nadministration tools for Windows 7.\n\n538\n00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:26.540\nDifferent set of tools for Windows 8,\n\n539\n00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:30.860\nWindows 8.1, Windows XP,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n540\n00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:35.000\nNow, with Windows 7,\nonce you install it, nothing changed.\n\n541\n00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.950\nRight, I have no additional\ntools on my system, so\n\n542\n00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:39.190\nit's like what the heck did I just do?\n\n543\n00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:42.270\nI downloaded it,\nit took forever to install.\n\n544\n00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:44.160\nAnd yet I got a whole lot of zip.\n\n545\n00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.060\nAnd that's because they figure\nyou don't need all of them.\n\n546\n00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:48.560\nRight?\n\n547\n00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.330\nSo, why bother installing all of them?\n\n548\n00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:51.730\nWe'll go ahead and put them there and\n\n549\n00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:54.540\nmake them available,\nyou pick which ones you want.\n\n550\n00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:58.492\nSo, I'm simply going to go into add,\nremove programs, and\n\n551\n00:26:58.492 --> 00:27:00.672\nturn Windows features on or off.\n\n552\n00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.870\nAnd we'll try that one more time.\n\n553\n00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:07.940\nThere we go.\nNow, I'll build up my list,\n\n554\n00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:12.120\nwhich sometimes takes a minute, and here's\nmy remote server administration tools.\n\n555\n00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:15.880\nAnd underneath there, I'll see I\nhave featured administration, and\n\n556\n00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:16.940\nroll administration,\n\n557\n00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:22.050\nif I expand out roll administration maybe\nthis user is going to be my DNS admin.\n\n558\n00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:25.020\nSo, I'm going to come in here and\nconfigure his dns console for him.\n\n559\n00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:25.880\nI'll click okay.\n\n560\n00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:28.660\nAnd, it might take an hour or two.\n\n561\n00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:30.180\nOkay, that's good.\n\n562\n00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:31.600\nIt shouldn't take too long.\n\n563\n00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.030\nAnd, we'll get this set up.\n\n564\n00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:36.960\nIt's just going to now give me\naccess to that one console.\n\n565\n00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:40.069\nI love it, when they make it to the very\nend and then it just [CROSSTALK]\n\n566\n00:27:40.069 --> 00:27:40.828\n>> And it still takes 2 minutes.\n\n567\n00:27:40.828 --> 00:27:41.328\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n568\n00:27:41.328 --> 00:27:42.578\nIt just stops right there.\n\n569\n00:27:42.578 --> 00:27:43.690\nIt's like, come on.\n\n570\n00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:46.440\nNow, that I've installed that one,\nI go Tools or\n\n571\n00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:50.460\nI go to Administrative Tools And\nthere's my DNS console.\n\n572\n00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:51.220\nIt's that easy.\n\n573\n00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:54.800\nNotice, not all of them are there,\njust the one I picked.\n\n574\n00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:57.780\nI opened up DNS, well who's running DNS?\n\n575\n00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:01.570\nNot this computer, this is my client that\nI sit at every day, this is my laptop.\n\n576\n00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:05.130\nThe following computer, and\nI put in DC, actually, what's his name?\n\n577\n00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:12.420\nSBR One.Lab.ITPro.TV,\ncould we make those names any longer?\n\n578\n00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:13.680\n>> I was about to say, Michael.\n\n579\n00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.490\nI think you went a little crazy there.\n\n580\n00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:20.250\n>> And we'll click okay, and there's my\nDNS console and I can expand this out,\n\n581\n00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:22.020\nI can look at my zones.\n\n582\n00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:25.460\nI can see all my records,\nI can make new records.\n\n583\n00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.410\nAssuming now that I have permissions,\nright?\n\n584\n00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:30.090\nI'm logged on as administrator\nThat's a separate show.\n\n585\n00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:32.840\nWe'd have to make sure that\nthis person had rights\n\n586\n00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.190\non the DNS server to be able to do this.\n\n587\n00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:37.540\nBut as far as giving him\nthat remote access or\n\n588\n00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.030\nher that remote access, it's that easy.\n\n589\n00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:43.030\nDownload RSAT,\nthrow that console on there.\n\n590\n00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:43.560\nPoint it.\nSo,\n\n591\n00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:45.810\nit's just another way we\ncan do remote access.\n\n592\n00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:50.520\nBut again, the big thing here to keep in\nmind Is when I wanna limit their access.\n\n593\n00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.950\nI don't wanna give them\naccess to the entire desktop,\n\n594\n00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:55.490\nbecause they can do whatever they want,\nright?\n\n595\n00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:57.430\nThey could try to install things.\n\n596\n00:28:57.430 --> 00:29:00.660\nThey can open Internet Explorer and\nbrowse the Internet from my server.\n\n597\n00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:01.840\nI don't want that happening.\n\n598\n00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:06.140\nRight, they might try to open up DHCP\nconsole and I don't want them doing that.\n\n599\n00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:09.160\nNow, all they get to see is DNS.\n\n600\n00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:12.870\nAnd the other cool thing about this, is,\nwhat if I had five DNS servers, right?\n\n601\n00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:16.330\nI could actually come back and\nadd another server.\n\n602\n00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:17.360\nI don't have a second one.\n\n603\n00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.680\nBut I could say, connect to DNS server,\nand I could add another computer.\n\n604\n00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:23.740\nAnd I could manage all\nfive of my DNS servers.\n\n605\n00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:26.210\nFrom this one console and\nthose DNS servers might be,\n\n606\n00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:27.920\nI got one here in Gainesville.\n\n607\n00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.020\nI got one up there in Atlanta.\n\n608\n00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:30.800\nI got another one in New York.\n\n609\n00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.300\nI can sit at a comfy\nchair at my cubicle and\n\n610\n00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:37.080\nmanage all of them right here\nfrom my little operating system.\n\n611\n00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.580\nYes, it is a very,\nvery handy item to have.\n\n612\n00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:43.430\nI've used those Rset tools more\noften times than I can count.\n\n613\n00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:45.630\nThey are very,\nvery handy to have on my system.\n\n614\n00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:48.270\nI don't have to keep remote desktop handy.\n\n615\n00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:48.800\n>> I've done that.\n\n616\n00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:52.240\nI've done the whole remote desktop,\nhave 25 remote desktop connections.\n\n617\n00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.960\nIt's not worth the price.\n\n618\n00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:58.150\nJust have those tools Point to\nthe server that you need to work on.\n\n619\n00:29:58.150 --> 00:29:58.990\nAnd you're off to the races.\n\n620\n00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:00.710\nIt's a whole lot more simple.\n\n621\n00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:01.760\n>> It really is.\n\n622\n00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.500\nI mean, it does get confusing as you say.\n\n623\n00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:06.290\nWhen you've got 15 different\nwindows opened up, it is a pain.\n\n624\n00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:08.460\nThere are some really\ncool third party tools.\n\n625\n00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:12.320\nMicrosoft does make a remote\ndesktop's snap in that you can use.\n\n626\n00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:18.220\nBut, it's still, it's not nearly as\nconvenient, I think, as using those tools.\n\n627\n00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:22.070\nBut, if I need access to\nthe entire desktop Then\n\n628\n00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:23.470\nremote desktop is the way to go.\n\n629\n00:30:24.622 --> 00:30:26.540\nAll right, now the last couple\nthings we want to talk about,\n\n630\n00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:31.250\nI just want to explain the concepts\nto you, remote desktop gateway,\n\n631\n00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:33.450\nis the first one I want to look at.\n\n632\n00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:36.320\nAnd we've talked about remote desktop,\nwe know what it is.\n\n633\n00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:39.620\nI can sit here on one machine,\nI can remote onto another machine But\n\n634\n00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.410\nwhat about when I'm out here at home,\nright?\n\n635\n00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:45.010\nI want to be able to connect from outside.\n\n636\n00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:48.330\nWell, these machines back here\nhave private IP addresses.\n\n637\n00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:53.410\nAs long as they're not in my DMZ, they\nmost likely have private IP addresses.\n\n638\n00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:55.700\nMy servers, or even better,\nwhat about my users?\n\n639\n00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:58.150\nI want my user to be able to\nremote into the Their machine,\n\n640\n00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:01.360\nthey've got their own computer at work,\nin their cubicle.\n\n641\n00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.490\nWhen they're home, I want them to be\nable to remote into that machine.\n\n642\n00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:07.870\nWell, you have to type in the name or\nIP address to connect to it.\n\n643\n00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:10.727\nIf they go home and type in\nthe name of their computer at work,\n\n644\n00:31:10.727 --> 00:31:12.420\nit's not going to happen, right?\n\n645\n00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:14.420\nBecause those names, or internal names,\n\n646\n00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:17.550\nare not gonna be resolvable\nOut there from the Internet.\n\n647\n00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:19.680\nTheir IP addresses are private.\n\n648\n00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.730\nMy router's not even going to allow,\nyou know,\n\n649\n00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:24.358\nmy router at home's not even gonna\nallow that request to go out.\n\n650\n00:31:24.358 --> 00:31:28.260\nIt's going to say, that's a private\nIP address, you can't do that.\n\n651\n00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:29.280\nAll right?\nSo, what we do is,\n\n652\n00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:32.860\nwe can set up what's called\na remote desktop gateway.\n\n653\n00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:37.630\nThis becomes the access point\nthat you hit From the outside.\n\n654\n00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:41.340\nIt has two interfaces,\nthe public and a private IP address.\n\n655\n00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:44.980\nAnd you're going to establish\na connection to your machine.\n\n656\n00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:48.030\nBut, in there, you're gonna put\nthe IP address of this guy as well.\n\n657\n00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:51.931\nAlmost like you would be setting up\na proxy server for Internet access.\n\n658\n00:31:51.931 --> 00:31:53.905\nIt's really almost the same thing.\n\n659\n00:31:53.905 --> 00:31:57.562\nAnd so your machine will first\nconnect to the Remote Desktop Gateway.\n\n660\n00:31:57.562 --> 00:32:00.886\nOnce you've established that connection,\nthen it can be routed,\n\n661\n00:32:00.886 --> 00:32:04.209\nthat private IP address of your\ncomputer can be routed in there, and\n\n662\n00:32:04.209 --> 00:32:06.880\nyou can establish that remote connection.\n\n663\n00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.770\nNow, I don't have,\nwe're not out here on the Internet.\n\n664\n00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:16.030\nBut I can show you, if I go to my\nRemote Desktop connection, right?\n\n665\n00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:18.480\nAnd I take a look at options, right?\n\n666\n00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.810\nLet's say I was trying to connect\nto a private IP address, like that.\n\n667\n00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:23.070\nBut I needed to go to that\nRemote Desktop Gateway first.\n\n668\n00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:26.820\nI would simply go over\nhere to my advanced tab.\n\n669\n00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:30.310\nAnd then connect from anywhere, settings.\n\n670\n00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:32.700\nAnd then use Remote Desktop Gateway.\n\n671\n00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.746\nAnd this is where I would put\nthe public side IP address of that\n\n672\n00:32:35.746 --> 00:32:37.432\nRemote Desktop Gateway server.\n\n673\n00:32:37.432 --> 00:32:41.309\nAnd then I would click OK,\nand I would click Connect.\n\n674\n00:32:41.309 --> 00:32:44.110\nAnd yeah, I know it's not gonna like it,\ncuz I didn't fill anything in.\n\n675\n00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:44.770\nBut that's it.\n\n676\n00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:49.230\nAll I have to do is tell it who that\nRemote Desktop Gateway server is.\n\n677\n00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:53.410\nThen it can connect to there first,\nthen establish the connection there, and\n\n678\n00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:55.120\nI remote it into my computer at work.\n\n679\n00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:55.710\nVery, very cool.\n\n680\n00:32:56.790 --> 00:33:02.160\nLast thing we gotta show, I know we're\ngetting short here, is going to be my VPN.\n\n681\n00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:07.170\nDaniel mentioned this,\nanother very common remote access method.\n\n682\n00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:10.730\nThis is a VPN, it stands for\nVirtual Private network, and\n\n683\n00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:15.070\nit allows me to connect back\nto work across the Internet.\n\n684\n00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:18.220\nAnd if you think about it,\nwork is connected to the Internet.\n\n685\n00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:21.690\nWherever you are, the hotel, Starbucks,\nhome, you're connected to the Internet.\n\n686\n00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:23.870\nThe Internet is a big, fat, mesh network,\n\n687\n00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:27.230\nso I should be able to connect\nto work from wherever I am.\n\n688\n00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:27.790\nAnd you can.\n\n689\n00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:29.050\nIt's easy, right?\n\n690\n00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:31.790\nThe problem is,\nthis is public infrastructure.\n\n691\n00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:34.950\nWho knows what's trying to grab\ntraffic as it goes across there.\n\n692\n00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:35.660\nYou have no idea.\n\n693\n00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:37.150\nIt's not your control.\n\n694\n00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:38.860\nSo we use tunneling protocols.\n\n695\n00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:43.455\nLike point to point tunneling protocol or\nlayer two tunneling protocol to\n\n696\n00:33:43.455 --> 00:33:48.760\nencapsulate my packets as they travel\nacross that public infrastructure.\n\n697\n00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:53.830\nAnd then very similar, that Remote Desktop\nGateway, I have a server that has a public\n\n698\n00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:58.850\nand a private facing network adapter,\nI establish a tunnel to here.\n\n699\n00:33:58.850 --> 00:33:59.740\nAnd then from there,\n\n700\n00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:05.090\nthis remote access server can route my\npackets back into that corporate network.\n\n701\n00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:07.670\nThe difference is I will,\nwhat's the difference between that and\n\n702\n00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:09.260\nRemote Desktop Gateway?\n\n703\n00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:13.460\nRemote Desktop Gateway, I went to\na single machine on my network, and\n\n704\n00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:16.180\nI'm seeing that machine's desktop.\n\n705\n00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:22.370\nWith a VPN, I'm connecting this machine to\nthe network, and I can access anything.\n\n706\n00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:25.851\nIt's just like I took a really long\nethernet cable and ran it to work and\n\n707\n00:34:25.851 --> 00:34:28.751\nplugged it into one of the switches\nin your server closet.\n\n708\n00:34:28.751 --> 00:34:32.478\nSo I'm not taking over a machine\nthat's already on the network.\n\n709\n00:34:32.478 --> 00:34:35.950\nThat's remote desktop, taking over\na machine that's already on the network.\n\n710\n00:34:35.950 --> 00:34:39.510\nHere, I'm adding another\nmachine to the network, right?\n\n711\n00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:43.530\nThis guy's gonna give me an IP address\nthat's valid on the corporate network.\n\n712\n00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:45.310\nAnd I'm gonna be able to\nconnect to file servers,\n\n713\n00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:48.820\nprinters, whatever I want\nthrough that VPN connection.\n\n714\n00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:52.680\nIt's a little bit different from\nthat Remote Desktop Gateway.\n\n715\n00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:56.230\nLast thing we're gonna throw in\nhere is application virtualization.\n\n716\n00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:58.188\nJust be familiar with this concept.\n\n717\n00:34:58.188 --> 00:35:01.280\nWhen we're talking about application\nvirtualization, we can run what's called\n\n718\n00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:05.780\nan App-V server, and\nI can host applications up on this server.\n\n719\n00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:09.970\nAnd, instead of installing them locally,\nwe're just gonna connect to them across\n\n720\n00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:14.120\nthe network, typically internally,\nbut it can be done externally as well.\n\n721\n00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:17.300\nI'm trying to think of an analogy there,\n\n722\n00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:20.930\nbut if you wanna provide an application\nbut you don't wanna install it\n\n723\n00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:24.790\non everybody's machine, application\nvirtualization is one way you can do that.\n\n724\n00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:28.199\nEspecially if you've got applications\nthat are maybe not compatible with their\n\n725\n00:35:28.199 --> 00:35:29.400\noperating system.\n\n726\n00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.890\nRight, I can install it locally.\n\n727\n00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:33.760\nI can run it up here on this server,\nand they could just connect to it.\n\n728\n00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:37.860\nAnd what they get on their screen is\njust the output from the application,\n\n729\n00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:39.150\nall right?\n\n730\n00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:41.530\nThey're seeing it,\nit looks like it's running locally.\n\n731\n00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:45.540\nKeystrokes and\nmouse clicks are being sent to the server,\n\n732\n00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:48.880\nthey're actually manipulating\nthe application up on the server.\n\n733\n00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:51.880\nAnd then all they're seeing is\nthe video output from that application.\n\n734\n00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:54.190\nThat's application virtualization.\n\n735\n00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:55.500\n>> All right, very cool stuff, Michael.\n\n736\n00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:59.870\nLots of ways of which we can remotely\nadministrate a lot of different systems,\n\n737\n00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:01.800\nspecifically here the Microsoft stuff.\n\n738\n00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.290\nThey have great tools.\n\n739\n00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:06.240\nSo you should play with them if you get,\nif you've got access to those guys.\n\n740\n00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.140\nCheck them out.\nStart moving around and\n\n741\n00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:12.340\nsee if you can access, maybe set up\ntwo machines and remote into one.\n\n742\n00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:16.570\nAnd then try to remote assistance,\nsend out one of those lovely invitations.\n\n743\n00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:18.131\nSee if everything works that way for you.\n\n744\n00:36:18.131 --> 00:36:22.316\nGet that kinda skill underneath your belt,\ncuz that's gonna really be helpful for\n\n745\n00:36:22.316 --> 00:36:23.530\nyou as you move into IT.\n\n746\n00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:25.468\nMichael, is there anything\nelse you can think of for\n\n747\n00:36:25.468 --> 00:36:27.290\nthis here episode before we wrap it up?\n\n748\n00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:28.780\n>> I think we covered most of it.\n\n749\n00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:29.500\n>> All right.\n\n750\n00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:31.570\nWell, looks like we've come to\nthe end of another great episode.\n\n751\n00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:32.530\nHopefully, you've enjoyed it.\n\n752\n00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:34.720\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off from ITProTV.\n\n753\n00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.780\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n754\n00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:37.590\n>> And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n755\n00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:39.575\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n756\n00:36:39.575 --> 00:36:44.939\n[SOUND]\n\n",

another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.492\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, joining\nme again today is my good friend, Mr.\n\n5\n00:00:20.492 --> 00:00:21.270\nMike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:21.870\nHow is it going, Mike?\n\n7\n00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.130\n>> Oh, it's going great.\n\n8\n00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.510\nAnother day in paradise,\nas we like to say around here.\n\n9\n00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.320\nWe're going over our MTA content,\nin particular, our server fundamentals.\n\n10\n00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.864\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be\nfocused on file and print services and\n\n11\n00:00:33.864 --> 00:00:37.876\nreally, mostly, print services, although\nwe are printing files, I suppose so.\n\n12\n00:00:37.876 --> 00:00:38.480\n>> I guess so.\n\n13\n00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.478\n>> Yeah, in a way.\n\n14\n00:00:39.478 --> 00:00:42.460\nAnyway, yeah, printers, right?\n\n15\n00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.820\nI'll be honest with you, and everybody\naround here knows it, I hate printers.\n\n16\n00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.030\nPrinters are one of those things that\njust always seems to be going wrong.\n\n17\n00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.610\nIt's just a constant\ncall to the help desk.\n\n18\n00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.550\nBut, using the right tools,\n\n19\n00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.420\nat least it makes it easy to\nadminister them and work with them.\n\n20\n00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.480\nAnd it's one of those things we're\ngonna have to deal with, right?\n\n21\n00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.600\nBecause the printers aren't going away.\n\n22\n00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.100\n>> Yeah, unfortunately,\nit's just part of the job.\n\n23\n00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.396\nYeah, so what you're signing up for\nif you're getting in to IT, and\n\n24\n00:01:09.396 --> 00:01:12.590\nthose printers,\nthey are the red devil of our day.\n\n25\n00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.400\nThat is for sure, because like Mike said,\nthey tended just, for\n\n26\n00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.390\nwhatever reason, there's some sort of\nvoodoo curse on every printer ever made.\n\n27\n00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.539\nThere's a witch doctor at the end\nof assembly line throwing ashes and\n\n28\n00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.090\nbones at it or something.\n\n29\n00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.440\nAnd they'll work great,\nwhen they're working, they're fantastic.\n\n30\n00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.710\nHere comes your print job, it's amazing.\n\n31\n00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.250\nWhen they don't work, we have to dive\nin to find out what is going on.\n\n32\n00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.083\nNow, Microsoft does give us some\ntools to be able to do that so\n\n33\n00:01:37.083 --> 00:01:39.990\nwe can see the printers that we\nhave connected to our systems.\n\n34\n00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.620\nWe can even work with the printers and\ntheir properties and their print queues,\n\n35\n00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.360\nand all the little caveats that can\ncome into play, when it comes to trying\n\n36\n00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.830\nto keep that printer hummin and\ndrummin the way it's supposed to.\n\n37\n00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.390\nMike, that's what you're gonna\nhelp us with today, right?\n\n38\n00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.522\nCuz, I don't know anything about printers.\n\n39\n00:01:54.522 --> 00:01:55.558\n>> I'm sure gonna try.\n\n40\n00:01:55.558 --> 00:01:57.079\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't know, I don't either.\n\n41\n00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:58.701\nI always call Ronnie [CROSSTALK].\n\n42\n00:01:58.701 --> 00:01:59.294\n>> Where's that Ronnie?\n\n43\n00:01:59.294 --> 00:02:00.615\nI don't know anything about printers,\nright?\n\n44\n00:02:00.615 --> 00:02:04.330\n[LAUGH] That's my story and\nI'm sticking to it.\n\n45\n00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.215\n>> Absolutely, so in this exam,\nwe're not gonna dive, don't worry,\n\n46\n00:02:08.215 --> 00:02:13.225\nwe're not diving into replacing rollers or\ngears or anything like that.\n\n47\n00:02:13.225 --> 00:02:16.407\nFor this exam what we need to focus\non is making the printers available.\n\n48\n00:02:16.407 --> 00:02:20.007\nI want my user to be able to find\nthe printer and send a print job to it.\n\n49\n00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:22.980\nI wanna make sure that I've got some\nfault tolerance built in there.\n\n50\n00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.570\nSo if one of my printers does crap\nout on me, they can still print,\n\n51\n00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.460\nthings like that.\n\n52\n00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:33.130\nAs Daniel said, managing that print queue\nfor when jobs get stuck or pausing jobs.\n\n53\n00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.670\nOr making sure that the boss's print\njob gets moved up in the list.\n\n54\n00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.940\nThings like that is really\nwhat we wanna focus on here.\n\n55\n00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.830\nSo we'll start off with a discussion\nof printers, just local versus network.\n\n56\n00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.800\nAnd a local printer, is a printer\nthat you've attached to a machine.\n\n57\n00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.800\nAnd most likely, most of you have\ndone this once or twice even in your\n\n58\n00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.770\nhome environments because we all\nknow we have printers at home.\n\n59\n00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.070\nI hate those too, but\nit's pretty straightforward stuff.\n\n60\n00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.138\nMost printers nowadays are either\ngoing to be USB or wireless.\n\n61\n00:03:05.138 --> 00:03:08.825\nAnd USB, you just plug the thing\ninto your client machine,\n\n62\n00:03:08.825 --> 00:03:11.849\nit recognizes new hardware,\nit uses that UPnP or\n\n63\n00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.854\nwhat have you to install the drivers,\nto get everything ready.\n\n64\n00:03:15.854 --> 00:03:20.400\nAnd now you've got a new a printer and\nyou can start printing to it, no big deal.\n\n65\n00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.418\nBut in a corporate environment,\nI've got hundreds or\n\n66\n00:03:23.418 --> 00:03:27.486\nthousands of users and I really\ndon't want to buy 1,000 printers and\n\n67\n00:03:27.486 --> 00:03:30.583\nI don't wanna have to plug\none in to everybody's desk.\n\n68\n00:03:30.583 --> 00:03:35.216\nAnd I darn sure don't wanna have to worry\nabout troubleshooting 1,000 different\n\n69\n00:03:35.216 --> 00:03:39.214\nprinters, because then it is going to\nbe 50% of what I do during the day,\n\n70\n00:03:39.214 --> 00:03:42.020\ncuz one of those things is\ngoing to be acting up on me.\n\n71\n00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.023\nNot to mention costs of ink and\nthings like that for\n\n72\n00:03:46.023 --> 00:03:48.910\nthose small desktop-based printers.\n\n73\n00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.820\nBut we can use local printers,\nand printers can be shared out.\n\n74\n00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.330\nIn fact, if I flip over to a client here,\nI can go into my Devices and Printers.\n\n75\n00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.510\nAnd we can do Add a printer, and\nI could Add a local printer.\n\n76\n00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.760\nAgain, USB,\nit's gonna do it all on its own.\n\n77\n00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.295\nIt says use this option only if\nyou don't have a USB printer.\n\n78\n00:04:09.295 --> 00:04:11.815\nSo if you're probably never\ngonna come in here and do this.\n\n79\n00:04:11.815 --> 00:04:13.895\nI'm gonna lie to it, just to fake it out.\n\n80\n00:04:13.895 --> 00:04:18.255\nI'll just say it's an LPT based printer\nand I'm gonna say that it's a Brother or\n\n81\n00:04:18.255 --> 00:04:20.570\nwhatever we've got there.\n\n82\n00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.240\nNormally you would, obviously,\ngo through this list,\n\n83\n00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.270\nfind your printer, pick the right one,\nso it knows what driver.\n\n84\n00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.250\nWindows has a big driver CAB that's\ngonna have the appropriate driver for\n\n85\n00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.270\nus, hopefully.\n\n86\n00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.860\nIf you bought the printer,\nyou've got the media that came with it,\n\n87\n00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.240\nthat has your driver.\n\n88\n00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.700\nGo to the manufacturer's website, download\nthe driver, whatever you've gotta do.\n\n89\n00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.658\nAnd I can go ahead and\ninstall this printer.\n\n90\n00:04:41.658 --> 00:04:45.359\nIt might balk at me because\nit's not really there, right,\n\n91\n00:04:45.359 --> 00:04:46.848\nI'm kinda lying to it.\n\n92\n00:04:46.848 --> 00:04:49.295\nAnd then it gives me option\nto share this printer.\n\n93\n00:04:49.295 --> 00:04:53.693\nSo if I've plugged a printer to one\ncomputer, maybe I'm in a SOHO and I can't\n\n94\n00:04:53.693 --> 00:04:58.026\ngo and buy one of those big, monster\nnetwork printers that sits out there and\n\n95\n00:04:58.026 --> 00:05:02.250\ndoes everything and staples, and\ncollates, and makes my coffee for me.\n\n96\n00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.540\nI buy one printer.\n\n97\n00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.010\nI put it on one person's desk and\n\n98\n00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.120\nI plug it in, but everybody in\nthe office needs to be able to print.\n\n99\n00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.150\nI share the printer out.\n\n100\n00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.626\nI give it a name, maybe something\na little bit more useful than that,\n\n101\n00:05:13.626 --> 00:05:15.718\nlike Mike's Desktop Printer.\n\n102\n00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.464\nRight, share it out, click Next.\n\n103\n00:05:22.464 --> 00:05:26.190\nSet it as my default printer\non my machine, click Finish.\n\n104\n00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.620\nAnd I now have a new printer\nattached to my machine.\n\n105\n00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.680\nAnd because I've shared it out,\nif we go over to another client, and\n\n106\n00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.800\nthey go to their Devices and Printers,\nwe can do a little Add printer here.\n\n107\n00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.930\nAdd a network, wireless or\nBluetooth printer.\n\n108\n00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.155\nAnd I can say the printer\nwasn't listed because, and\n\n109\n00:05:47.155 --> 00:05:51.015\nwe'll talk about that option here\nwith a listing of Active Directory.\n\n110\n00:05:51.015 --> 00:05:56.141\nBut for desktop printers, typically you're\ngonna be just typing in \\\\name of that\n\n111\n00:05:56.141 --> 00:06:00.998\ncomputer that's got that printer attached,\nand then the name of that printer.\n\n112\n00:06:03.179 --> 00:06:07.070\nNotice it downloaded the driver\nfrom the machine, right?\n\n113\n00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.230\nOn the first client,\nI installed the driver.\n\n114\n00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.260\nThis client is now connecting\nover the network to that.\n\n115\n00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.200\nThat other client is becoming\nthe print server and says, hey,\n\n116\n00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.470\nif you wanna print, here it is.\n\n117\n00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.190\nI shared this printer out,\nyou can connect to it, by the way,\n\n118\n00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.642\nyou're gonna need a driver for\nit, here's the driver.\n\n119\n00:06:22.642 --> 00:06:26.009\nAll right, and\nI click Next and Finish, and\n\n120\n00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:31.100\nnow I've got that printer on Client1,\nhere on Client2.\n\n121\n00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.900\nSo easy enough to work with\nthat in a SOHO environment.\n\n122\n00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.790\nNow, in a corporate environment,\n\n123\n00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.860\nwe're typically dealing with those\nbig old network-based printers.\n\n124\n00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.350\nAnd a network printer's simply a printer\nthat's connected directly to the network.\n\n125\n00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:45.600\nHas a network adapter in there,\n\n126\n00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.760\nit's plugged in, it doesn't get\nconnected directly to a machine.\n\n127\n00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.130\nWe do still need a server though.\n\n128\n00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.970\nWe need somebody to manage the queue for\nthat and so,\n\n129\n00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:03.300\nover here I've installed the Print and\nDocument Services role.\n\n130\n00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.570\nAnd this sometimes can take a little bit,\nso\n\n131\n00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.100\nI've already actually\ninstalled a printer here.\n\n132\n00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.120\nAgain, cuz I'm lying to it,\nI don't actually have a printer.\n\n133\n00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.210\nBut if I open up Print Management, and\nwe wait for that console to open up,\n\n134\n00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:21.090\nwe'll see that on this particular server,\nServer 02, I have a printer listed\n\n135\n00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:25.470\nas this Canon IR68 or C6870.\n\n136\n00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.800\nAnd it's ready to go,\nI've told it what the IP address is.\n\n137\n00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.050\nAnd I can show you, I won't wait for it.\n\n138\n00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:35.130\nIf I do Add Printer > Add a TCP or\nWeb Services Printer.\n\n139\n00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:39.720\nI would click Next, I would type\nin the IP address of that printer.\n\n140\n00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.130\nMost of those printers have a web\ninterface that you might go to or\n\n141\n00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.570\na touch pad on it where you can set\nthe IP address, things like that.\n\n142\n00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.420\nAnd then you end up walking through that.\n\n143\n00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:53.870\nIf I do this right now, it's gonna try\nto reach out to that IP address and\n\n144\n00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.000\nfind that printer.\n\n145\n00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.240\nAnd it's gonna whir and grind for a good\nfour to five minutes before it says,\n\n146\n00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.220\nall right, I give up, and so\nI spared you guys that pain.\n\n147\n00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.220\nIn the real world though, if it was\nactually on the network it wouldn't\n\n148\n00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.890\ntake that long, it's not nearly that bad.\n\n149\n00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.698\nSo there's my network printer.\n\n150\n00:08:11.698 --> 00:08:15.958\nAnd now, once I've got that shared out,\nIn a domain environment,\n\n151\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:20.130\none of the things we wanna do\nis list it in Active Directory.\n\n152\n00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:23.420\nI've already done that, but\nI can show you in here.\n\n153\n00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.980\nIf we take a look at the Sharing tab,\n\n154\n00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.390\nthere's where I have listed\nthis is an Active Directory.\n\n155\n00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:33.030\nWhat that does is it makes an object for\nthis printer in Active Directory and\n\n156\n00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:36.590\nthat makes it easy for\nmy users to find that printer.\n\n157\n00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:40.180\nThey don't have to know the name or\nthe IP address or anything like that.\n\n158\n00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:44.130\nAll they're gonna do is on their client\nmachine, their little desktop or\n\n159\n00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:46.090\nlaptop that they sit at everyday.\n\n160\n00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:48.530\nThey're gonna say, hey,\nI wanna add a printer.\n\n161\n00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.150\nAnd it's a network-based printer.\n\n162\n00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:51.720\nAnd look at there,\n\n163\n00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.900\nit shows up in the list because I\npublished it in Active Directory.\n\n164\n00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.200\nIf I hadn't published it,\n\n165\n00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.100\nthey'd have to click the printer\nthat I want isn't listed.\n\n166\n00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.750\nThen, they would have\nto know that UNC path.\n\n167\n00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:08.350\nBackslash, backslash, name of the server,\nbackslash, name of the shared printer.\n\n168\n00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:12.420\nBut, since I listed it,\nit's right there, I click Next.\n\n169\n00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.880\nAgain, it's gonna download\nthis driver from that server.\n\n170\n00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.710\nI could change the name if I wanted to,\n\n171\n00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:19.870\nactually it won't let me change the names,\nsorry.\n\n172\n00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:21.150\nClick next.\n\n173\n00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.920\nMaybe I want to set it\nas my default printer.\n\n174\n00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.830\nI click Finish and\n\n175\n00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:29.800\nnow I've got that network base printer\nadded and I can send print jobs to that.\n\n176\n00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.020\nAll right,\nin fact let's send one over there.\n\n177\n00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.960\nLet's create a new little text document.\n\n178\n00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:39.110\nI'll call it something fancy\nlike new text document.\n\n179\n00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:41.790\nAnd we'll dump some content in there.\n\n180\n00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:42.500\nTesting.\n\n181\n00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:45.020\nWe'll save it.\n\n182\n00:09:47.365 --> 00:09:48.730\nAnd now, let's print it.\n\n183\n00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:50.700\nSo, I'll say Print.\n\n184\n00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.053\n>> Also known as breaking the printer.\n\n185\n00:09:53.053 --> 00:09:55.053\n[LAUGH] A little joke.\n\n186\n00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:56.655\n>> So, exactly.\n\n187\n00:09:56.655 --> 00:10:00.344\nI'll choose the printer I want,\nyou can see the Cannon is my default, so\n\n188\n00:10:00.344 --> 00:10:03.510\nit's already selected,\nI click Print, and I'm good to go.\n\n189\n00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:07.480\nI can see my little print icon down here,\nis sending that printer over now.\n\n190\n00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.400\nBecause there's not really a printer\nthere, obviously that's going to fail but\n\n191\n00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.920\nit is gonna give me something to look at.\n\n192\n00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.990\nIn fact I should send,\nlet's do that from here as well.\n\n193\n00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:20.980\nLet's go ahead and\nadd that printer real quick,\n\n194\n00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.990\nsince it finds it in the directory\nit shouldn't take but a second.\n\n195\n00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.050\nAnd then I'll create a new file over here.\n\n196\n00:10:30.328 --> 00:10:32.240\nAnd I'm gonna dump some content, and\n\n197\n00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.180\nit doesn't really need content\nto send it to the printer.\n\n198\n00:10:39.094 --> 00:10:41.450\nAnd I'll send it over that same printer.\n\n199\n00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:45.790\nAll right, so\nthat’s doing our network printing.\n\n200\n00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:50.340\nNext thing I wanna show you is some\nprint job management, all right?\n\n201\n00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:54.260\nWhen we send print jobs to a printer, they\ngo into what’s called the print queue.\n\n202\n00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.830\nThey get spooled up and they’re converted,\nthey use that driver to convert it.\n\n203\n00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:00.060\nInto something the printer's\ngonna be able to understand,\n\n204\n00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.700\nbe able to render it on that printer.\n\n205\n00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:07.940\nThe print queue's a temporary storage,\nor that list,\n\n206\n00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.170\nthat holding pattern, if you will.\n\n207\n00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:14.010\nSo what I'm gonna do on this guy,\nthis is the wrong server.\n\n208\n00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:16.420\nIs, we can take a look\nat the print queue here.\n\n209\n00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.130\nI'm just gonna double click on this guy.\n\n210\n00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:22.600\nNow, I can work with my properties here,\nand that's actually not what I want.\n\n211\n00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.800\nLet's do this.\n\n212\n00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.961\nLet's see if I can view\nthe queue from here, no?\n\n213\n00:11:27.961 --> 00:11:34.010\nI know I can, dun, dun, dum.\n\n214\n00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:37.290\nThere we go, open print queue,\nright clicking on the wrong area.\n\n215\n00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:40.680\nAnd there's my two jobs that I've\ngot waiting in that print queue.\n\n216\n00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.090\nIf this printer was really there,\nthe would've already printed and\n\n217\n00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:45.150\nthey'd be gone from this list.\n\n218\n00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:48.180\nBut, if you're trouble shooting printers,\nnow, if your users are telling you,\n\n219\n00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.680\nhey I sent a print job and\nit's not printing.\n\n220\n00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.930\nOr it's telling me that it's stuck or\nwhat have you.\n\n221\n00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:54.850\nThis is where you'd wanna come and look.\n\n222\n00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:57.180\nAnd I can see those print\njobs that are waiting.\n\n223\n00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:58.350\nWhat can I do?\n\n224\n00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:00.990\nWell, I could pause a print job.\n\n225\n00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:05.570\nI could Restart a print job or\nI could Cancel a print job, right.\n\n226\n00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:08.210\nDepending on what I need to do,\nmaybe I wanna pause it.\n\n227\n00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:11.330\nOr this one's got an error, so\nmaybe I wanna get rid of that one.\n\n228\n00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:14.990\nSo I'll say, Cancel, that'll remove\nthat job from the print queue.\n\n229\n00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:19.290\nAnd then sometimes it does take\na minute for this console to update.\n\n230\n00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:23.050\nAnd eventually that is\ngonna remove itself.\n\n231\n00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:24.560\nIt'll be gone from the queue.\n\n232\n00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:25.900\nThe next one will move up.\n\n233\n00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:30.776\nBut, of course, that one's gonna fail\ntoo because there is no printer, right.\n\n234\n00:12:30.776 --> 00:12:34.292\nSo manage the printer, again,\nyou can come in here, look at this queue,\n\n235\n00:12:34.292 --> 00:12:37.500\nyou can see from this menu,\nI can look at my printing preferences.\n\n236\n00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.880\nThere we go.\nThat one finally quit.\n\n237\n00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:41.690\nSo that cancelled.\n\n238\n00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.320\nNow this one's gonna try to print.\n\n239\n00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.815\nOf course it's gonna fail as well and\n\n240\n00:12:44.815 --> 00:12:46.906\nthat's typically what\nhappens on a printer, so.\n\n241\n00:12:46.906 --> 00:12:48.040\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] That's exactly right.\n\n242\n00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:52.470\n>> All right, so that's a little about\nmanaging the printer is really looking at\n\n243\n00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:56.320\nthat print queue and\nworking with those jobs.\n\n244\n00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.090\nNow another cool thing\nwe can do with printers\n\n245\n00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:02.300\nis we can set up web based printing,\nall right?\n\n246\n00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.810\nWeb based printing just means I'm\ngonna create a web interface for\n\n247\n00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:07.510\npeople to connect to the printer.\n\n248\n00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:11.493\nAnd we can manage the printer\nthrough this web interface, or\n\n249\n00:13:11.493 --> 00:13:14.395\nwe can print through this print interface.\n\n250\n00:13:14.395 --> 00:13:15.698\nIt's web printing.\n\n251\n00:13:15.698 --> 00:13:18.545\nNow on the objectives,\nthey're gonna say web printing,\n\n252\n00:13:18.545 --> 00:13:21.799\nit's really called IP printing,\nor internet printing, or IPP,\n\n253\n00:13:21.799 --> 00:13:24.480\ninternet printing protocol,\nis what we're doing.\n\n254\n00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.020\nBut I've already set it up on this guy.\n\n255\n00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:29.840\nAll you do Is you install that\nprint services role, in fact,\n\n256\n00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.210\nlet's take a peek at that.\n\n257\n00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:37.490\nI'm gonna go back up here,\nroles and I could do add roles,\n\n258\n00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:39.380\nI suppose, or I could just\nshow you down here, let's see.\n\n259\n00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:43.673\nIf I go down to Roles Services,\nyou'll see where I have,\n\n260\n00:13:43.673 --> 00:13:47.261\nyou can tell IIS is installed,\nlet's do this.\n\n261\n00:13:47.261 --> 00:13:50.800\nPrint services,\ncouple of different ways I could do this.\n\n262\n00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.994\nI was gonna go through the menu.\n\n263\n00:13:53.994 --> 00:13:55.772\nWow, now I've really made it mad.\n\n264\n00:13:55.772 --> 00:13:56.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> See, printers,\n\n265\n00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.180\nI hate printers, they hate me.\n\n266\n00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:59.580\n[LAUGH]\n>> Voodoo curse.\n\n267\n00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.640\n>> All right, if I go down to\nRole Services, you can see not only\n\n268\n00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:07.450\ndo I have the print server role installed,\nI also have Internet printing installed.\n\n269\n00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.030\nWhen you do that, when you go through\nthat wizard and you say you wanna do\n\n270\n00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:14.140\nInternet printing, it's gonna\ntell you hey, this requires IIS.\n\n271\n00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:15.040\nMakes sense, right?\n\n272\n00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.580\nI need a web server.\n\n273\n00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:19.980\nTo be able to set up web based or\nInternet printing.\n\n274\n00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.400\nSo, it installed that web\nservices role as well.\n\n275\n00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:29.370\nAnd, now if I take a look, what we can do,\nthen go back over to one of these clients.\n\n276\n00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:30.470\nI can open up a browser.\n\n277\n00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.470\nAs you can see,\nmy document failed to print there.\n\n278\n00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:37.990\nAnd that's okay,\nwe knew that was gonna happen.\n\n279\n00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:40.670\nAnd then from here I can type in \\\\,\nI'm sorry not backslash,\n\n280\n00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:44.385\nit's not a UNC it's a web base so\nit's gonna be a URL.\n\n281\n00:14:44.385 --> 00:14:49.176\nHttp://, name of that\nserver which I've already\n\n282\n00:14:49.176 --> 00:14:53.973\nvisited before, there we go,\nsvr02/printers.\n\n283\n00:14:53.973 --> 00:14:56.700\nSo whatever the name of the server is,\n\n284\n00:14:56.700 --> 00:15:01.910\n/printers should get you to\nthe web-based interface for that server.\n\n285\n00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:04.860\nSo there you go, al printers on svr02.\n\n286\n00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.590\nAnd I can see I can come in here and\nof course it's got that error.\n\n287\n00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:09.310\nSo maybe I'm remotely\nmanaging this printer.\n\n288\n00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:10.390\nI can come in and take a look at it.\n\n289\n00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:14.300\nI'll click on that, and\nI can look at the document list.\n\n290\n00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:18.980\nAnd I can say you know what, we're\ngoing to cancel that print job as well.\n\n291\n00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.930\nSo same thing I was doing\nfrom the queue earlier\n\n292\n00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:24.090\nI'm now doing through\nthis web-based interface.\n\n293\n00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:27.530\nI'm going to cancel all documents.\n\n294\n00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:29.240\nThere we go,\nwe'll get everything out of there.\n\n295\n00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.460\nBut you can see I can get a status,\n\n296\n00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:33.270\nI can see the print queue,\nthe pending documents.\n\n297\n00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:38.850\nSo, a very handy interface if you wanna\nallow this type of interaction with your\n\n298\n00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:44.162\nprinters to your users you can set up\na web-based portal that they can access,\n\n299\n00:15:44.162 --> 00:15:46.730\nall right.\n\n300\n00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.410\nWhat else are we gonna talk about, Daniel?\n\n301\n00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:49.350\n>> Driver deployment.\n\n302\n00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:51.350\n>> Yeah, drive deployment,\nwe kinda saw, right?\n\n303\n00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:54.610\nThe main thing is to make sure\nthe drivers are available.\n\n304\n00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:58.260\nNow, when I did that on my\nWindows 7 machine here,\n\n305\n00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:02.680\nwhile the other client was also running\nWindows 7, so it was the same driver.\n\n306\n00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.090\nI didn't have to worry about it.\n\n307\n00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:07.237\nWhen you're managing\na print server however,\n\n308\n00:16:07.237 --> 00:16:12.597\nyou might have to install additional\ndrivers for different client, all right?\n\n309\n00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:14.654\n>> Yeah,\nthis can definitely be one the most,\n\n310\n00:16:14.654 --> 00:16:18.491\nthe larger administrative headaches when\nit comes to printing because Mike might\n\n311\n00:16:18.491 --> 00:16:22.104\nnot have the driver to make the printer\nthat he's trying to connect to work And\n\n312\n00:16:22.104 --> 00:16:25.631\nif that happens, it's not gonna be\nable to print very well, are you Mike?\n\n313\n00:16:25.631 --> 00:16:29.090\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's not gonna very well at all.\n\n314\n00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:30.360\nSo let's take a look here.\n\n315\n00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:30.970\nAnd you know what, Dan?\n\n316\n00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:34.210\nI gotta make sure I get\ninto the right place.\n\n317\n00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:37.954\nWe got drivers, and you can see I've\nalready got quite a few drivers loaded up\n\n318\n00:16:37.954 --> 00:16:39.400\nhere, and that's the idea.\n\n319\n00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.570\nWhat you would do is Add Driver, right?\n\n320\n00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:46.800\nSo if you know you've got Windows 7\nclients as well as Windows XP clients or\n\n321\n00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.710\nyou want them connecting from\nother operating systems.\n\n322\n00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:52.800\nYou need to obtain the drivers for\nthose operating systems and\n\n323\n00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.090\ncome through here and load them up.\n\n324\n00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:58.705\nMaybe I've got 64-bit, but\nif I've got 32-bit printer, or\n\n325\n00:16:58.705 --> 00:17:02.820\n32-bit clients out there,\nthey can't use that 64-bit driver.\n\n326\n00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:07.430\nSo we'll tell it, hey,\nload up the x86 driver for this as well.\n\n327\n00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:11.100\nAnd maybe I want to do that same,\nwhat did I do, a Canon?\n\n328\n00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:14.180\nOh my gosh,\nnow I gotta remember what I actually used.\n\n329\n00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:17.866\nAn IR There we go.\n\n330\n00:17:17.866 --> 00:17:20.186\n6870, I think, is the one I did.\n\n331\n00:17:20.186 --> 00:17:22.820\nWe'll go to next and we'll click finish.\n\n332\n00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:23.900\n>> We'll find out soon enough, won't we?\n\n333\n00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.310\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes, we will!\n\n334\n00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.720\nAnd now it wants the driver.\n\n335\n00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:30.720\nOf course, I don't have the driver,\nso I'm gonna have to cancel this out.\n\n336\n00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.350\nBut that would be our job, is to make\nsure we have obtain those drivers.\n\n337\n00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:38.210\nYou gotta think about all the clients that\nare gonna be connecting to this printer.\n\n338\n00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:41.540\nMake sure you get all the drivers,\ncuz remember what they do is they go to\n\n339\n00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:45.750\nAdd Printers, they browse and they find\nthat printer listed in the directory.\n\n340\n00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:49.790\nAnd then they query that print server\nthat that object points them to.\n\n341\n00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:51.150\nAnd say, hey, I wanna print.\n\n342\n00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:53.010\nThen it says okay, here's the driver.\n\n343\n00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:55.440\nAnd it downloads the driver\nfrom your print server.\n\n344\n00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.240\nWell, if that print server doesn't\nhave the driver, it's gonna say,\n\n345\n00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.780\nI'm sorry, you can't use me because\nI don't have a driver for you.\n\n346\n00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:06.090\nAnd as Daniel said, this can be a crazy\nnightmare cuz you forget about the oh,\n\n347\n00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:07.870\nthat's right,\nI've got somebody running XP.\n\n348\n00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:10.510\nI forgot about that person.\n\n349\n00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:12.610\nAnd now you've gotta go and\nadd that driver for\n\n350\n00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:15.130\nthem, so\nsomething we've got to think about.\n\n351\n00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:16.950\nYou can see, relatively easy to do.\n\n352\n00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:20.970\nThe biggest challenge is trying to\nfigure out all the drivers you need,\n\n353\n00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:23.587\nmaking sure they're up there and\navailable.\n\n354\n00:18:23.587 --> 00:18:27.439\nAll right, so, last thing I want to show\nyou about printing with something known as\n\n355\n00:18:27.439 --> 00:18:28.350\nprinter pools.\n\n356\n00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:31.660\nAnd this is something I love to,\nto do with my printers.\n\n357\n00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:34.040\nI make myself my little mai\ntai with my umbrella drink.\n\n358\n00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:37.560\nI take my printer out to the pool and\nI throw it in.\n\n359\n00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.358\nAnd I watch it sink down and\ngo bloop, bloop, bloop.\n\n360\n00:18:38.358 --> 00:18:39.553\n>> Listening to gangster rap.\n\n361\n00:18:39.553 --> 00:18:42.002\n>> That's right.\n\n362\n00:18:42.002 --> 00:18:45.005\n[LAUGH] No, that's not what\nthey mean by printer pooling.\n\n363\n00:18:45.005 --> 00:18:49.210\nA printer pool is a way to take\nmultiple physical printers and\n\n364\n00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:51.960\nmake one logical printer out of them,\nall right?\n\n365\n00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.070\nAnd you might think,\nwell why the heck would I do that?\n\n366\n00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:56.640\nTwo reasons, right?\n\n367\n00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.480\nOne is for full tolerance, right?\n\n368\n00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:04.760\nIf my printer pool contains four printers,\none of those printers goes down,\n\n369\n00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:05.700\nit doesn't matter.\n\n370\n00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.760\nThe users connect to the logical printer,\nand\n\n371\n00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:12.610\nthen it sends the job to one\nof the printers in that pool.\n\n372\n00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:15.290\nSo, if one of the printers is unavailable\nbecause it's failed for some reason,\n\n373\n00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:19.690\nit's out of paper, or it's mechanically\nbroke, what have you, no big deal.\n\n374\n00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:22.630\nIt just sends it to another one of\nthe printers in the printer pool.\n\n375\n00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:23.830\nSo now I'm getting fault tolerance.\n\n376\n00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:27.260\nI have a printer fail and I don't\nhave to worry about people going, oh,\n\n377\n00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.170\nnow you've gotta add a different printer.\n\n378\n00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:30.620\nSorry, that printer's out of commission.\n\n379\n00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.080\nYou're gonna have to add another printer.\n\n380\n00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:35.140\nWe got this one over\nhere that we've set up.\n\n381\n00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.200\nThey don't change anything.\n\n382\n00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.162\nThat printer fails,\n\n383\n00:19:37.162 --> 00:19:40.752\nthey can still print because again\nthey're printing to that logical printer.\n\n384\n00:19:40.752 --> 00:19:45.546\nAnd it'll query the printers in the pool,\nsee which one's least busy and\n\n385\n00:19:45.546 --> 00:19:49.980\navailable and send the print\njob to that particular printer.\n\n386\n00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.460\nSo I get fault tolerance,\n\n387\n00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:57.440\nI also get load balance because I've\ngot four printers in this printer pool.\n\n388\n00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.370\nThey're all printing to\nthat logical printer.\n\n389\n00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:01.690\nIf I find that that's not good enough.\n\n390\n00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:03.940\nThose four printers are busy all the time.\n\n391\n00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:06.390\nThe queues are always really long.\n\n392\n00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:09.670\nI just add another physical\nprinter to the printer pool.\n\n393\n00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:14.413\nAnd I've increased my capacity by what,\n4 to 5, 20%.\n\n394\n00:20:14.413 --> 00:20:15.920\nThey didn't change anything.\n\n395\n00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.880\nThey're still printing at\nthat same logical printer.\n\n396\n00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.900\nThey don't even know that I've added\nanother printer to the printer pool, and\n\n397\n00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.580\nyet I've increased my capacity by 20%.\n\n398\n00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:28.610\nSo, very easy to provide fault tolerance.\n\n399\n00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:32.300\nVery easy to provide scalability.\n\n400\n00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.070\nNow the one thing Microsoft will tell you,\nis that well,\n\n401\n00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:36.480\nthere's a couple of requirements.\n\n402\n00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.540\nThey call them requirements.\n\n403\n00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.770\nI like to make a joke out of it.\n\n404\n00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:42.720\nFirst, the requirement is they've\nall gotta be the same printer.\n\n405\n00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.160\nOr at least use the same driver.\n\n406\n00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.600\nRight, because when you print to\nthe logical printer, you don't know what\n\n407\n00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.420\nprinter is actually what physical\ndevice is printing your print job.\n\n408\n00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.270\nSo, it needs to be the same driver.\n\n409\n00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:58.615\nWhen it renders that job, it could go to\nanyone of those four in the printer pool\n\n410\n00:20:58.615 --> 00:21:02.273\nit's gonna understand and\nbe able to convert that into my print.\n\n411\n00:21:02.273 --> 00:21:05.800\n[COUGH] So they all need to\nbe basically the same model.\n\n412\n00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.640\nHave the same capabilities, right.\n\n413\n00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.900\nI don't want,\nsometimes I can print in color but\n\n414\n00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:12.720\nsometimes by job comes out black and\nwhite.\n\n415\n00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:16.980\nI want to make sure the printers\nare the same model, same capabilities.\n\n416\n00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:18.480\nThat's a requirement, right.\n\n417\n00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.590\nOtherwise it's not gonna\nwork too well at all.\n\n418\n00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:24.370\nThey also say a requirement is to\nput all the printers in the same\n\n419\n00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:26.020\nphysical location.\n\n420\n00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:29.620\nI will tell you this is not\nactually a requirement.\n\n421\n00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:36.202\nBut unless this is part of your employee\nexercise program, it is a good idea.\n\n422\n00:21:36.202 --> 00:21:38.796\nIf I've got a printer pool with\nfour printers in there and\n\n423\n00:21:38.796 --> 00:21:40.102\nthere's one on each floor.\n\n424\n00:21:40.102 --> 00:21:42.309\nWell, when you send it\nto the logical printer,\n\n425\n00:21:42.309 --> 00:21:44.620\nyou don't know which one it's going to.\n\n426\n00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:47.540\nSo, you're gonna run to each one of\nthose printers trying to figure out\n\n427\n00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:48.680\nwhere your print job spit out.\n\n428\n00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.833\nYou're going to have some angry employees.\n\n429\n00:21:50.833 --> 00:21:51.440\n[LAUGH].\n\n430\n00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.420\nOr some thin ones.\n\n431\n00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:52.936\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH].\n\n432\n00:21:52.936 --> 00:21:53.888\nOr both.\n\n433\n00:21:53.888 --> 00:21:54.630\n[LAUGH].\n\n434\n00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:58.260\nYou could have fun time setting up\na bunch of web cams over each printer.\n\n435\n00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:01.110\nAnd you just browse\nthrough the web address.\n\n436\n00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:03.000\nOh, there it is, it's on floor three.\n\n437\n00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.080\nLet me go ahead and\nget on the elevator for that.\n\n438\n00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.160\n>> I mean, I can see them.\n\n439\n00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.530\nI need this job right now.\n\n440\n00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:08.830\nI'm walking into a meeting.\n\n441\n00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:10.170\nI tried to print it off.\n\n442\n00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:13.140\nAnd gosh dang it, it's not here,\nor running up the steps, but yeah.\n\n443\n00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:14.768\n>> Come in all red faced and sweaty.\n\n444\n00:22:14.768 --> 00:22:17.860\n[LAUGH] I'm here for the presentation.\n\n445\n00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.431\n>> And Danny's back there,\ndrinking his soda, going ha, ha, ha.\n\n446\n00:22:21.431 --> 00:22:23.960\n[LAUGH] But yeah, so not a requirement.\n\n447\n00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:27.870\nI mean, printer pools will work just fine\nif the printers are spread across your\n\n448\n00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:29.915\nbuilding, but it's not very efficient.\n\n449\n00:22:29.915 --> 00:22:31.930\nThat's not what we're trying to do for\nour employees, so\n\n450\n00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:35.430\nyes, put them all in\nthe same physical location.\n\n451\n00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:36.560\nBecause the point is,\n\n452\n00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:39.660\nthey don't know which printer is\nactually gonna spit their print job out.\n\n453\n00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.500\nSo you want them all together there.\n\n454\n00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.750\n>> Now Mike, another topic we probably\nneed to broach when it comes to printing\n\n455\n00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:47.410\nis the idea, of rights and permissions.\n\n456\n00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:51.270\nThis is something that can get a little\nbit confusing, so help us out with this.\n\n457\n00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:52.518\n>> Yeah, I'll tell you what there, Daniel,\n\n458\n00:22:52.518 --> 00:22:54.425\nlet me show you guys setting up\na print pool before we jump in there.\n\n459\n00:22:54.425 --> 00:22:55.980\n>> Yes, by all means.\n\n460\n00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:56.880\n>> I wanna show you that.\n\n461\n00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.040\nIt's pretty easy to do.\n\n462\n00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:01.210\nWe've got a printer here\nthat I've already added.\n\n463\n00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:02.700\nThat Canon IR.\n\n464\n00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:05.140\nAnd when I added that,\nI gave it the IP address.\n\n465\n00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:09.235\nIn fact if we pull up the properties for\nthis guy, and we go to that Ports tab.\n\n466\n00:23:09.235 --> 00:23:13.708\nI'll see there's the IP address that's\nthe port I created for this printer,\n\n467\n00:23:13.708 --> 00:23:15.100\n10.1.1.10.\n\n468\n00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:18.580\nNow, again, I did this ahead of\ntime because I'm lying to it.\n\n469\n00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:21.440\nAnd, it'll whir and grind and\ntry and try to find it,\n\n470\n00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.170\nwhen you type in an IP address.\n\n471\n00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:27.090\nEventually it will time out and let you do\nit anyway, assuming that you're gonna fix\n\n472\n00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:31.700\nwhatever connectivity problems you have\nwhenever you get ready to actually use it.\n\n473\n00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:32.940\nSo, I've already done this.\n\n474\n00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:37.220\nBut there's my IP address of that network\nprinter that I added to this print server.\n\n475\n00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:41.850\nNow I've went and bought another Canon IR,\nand I want to create a printer pool.\n\n476\n00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:45.840\nSo I create a second port, maybe that\nsecond Canon has an IP address of 1.11.\n\n477\n00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:51.425\nSo I want to add that to this pool,\nand all you do is choose both of them.\n\n478\n00:23:51.425 --> 00:23:54.780\nUh-oh, it's only letting me select one.\n\n479\n00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.840\nEasy enough to fix.\n\n480\n00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.930\nThere's a little check mark down here\nat the bottom: enable printer pooling.\n\n481\n00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:05.790\nAs soon as I check that,\nnow I can select both ports.\n\n482\n00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:09.190\nAnd I can click okay, and\nnow I have a printer pool.\n\n483\n00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:10.900\nIt was that easy, right?\n\n484\n00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.530\nSo when they print, they're gonna browse,\n\n485\n00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:14.600\nthey're gonna find that\nobject in Active Directory.\n\n486\n00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.170\nOh, there's the Canon I know\nI'm supposed to print to.\n\n487\n00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:19.587\nWhat they don't know is when\nthey send that print job,\n\n488\n00:24:19.587 --> 00:24:21.701\nit might be going to that 10.1.1.10.\n\n489\n00:24:21.701 --> 00:24:24.858\nIt might be going to 10.1.1.11, right?\n\n490\n00:24:24.858 --> 00:24:25.402\nThat easy.\n\n491\n00:24:25.402 --> 00:24:29.211\nIf I had another printer, I simply go\nback and rinse and repeat that process.\n\n492\n00:24:29.211 --> 00:24:32.940\nCreate a port for that particular printer,\nthat physical device.\n\n493\n00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.060\nGo back to the properties of this guy.\n\n494\n00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:38.780\nCheck that third check mark and I've\ngot three printers in my printer pool.\n\n495\n00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:42.390\nSo, easy breezy to set\nup those printer pools.\n\n496\n00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:44.770\nAll right,\nnow Daniel was mentioning file folder and\n\n497\n00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:46.990\nshare permissions versus rights.\n\n498\n00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:50.340\nThis objective does call out file and\nprint services.\n\n499\n00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:52.225\nWe've covered NTFS permissions and\n\n500\n00:24:52.225 --> 00:24:55.150\nwe've covered share permissions\nin several episodes.\n\n501\n00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:57.930\nIf you've got any questions about those,\nmake sure you go back and\n\n502\n00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:01.460\nwatch those,\nbecause it is a lengthy topic.\n\n503\n00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:05.720\nHere, what they wanna talk about is\nmake sure we understand the differences\n\n504\n00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.400\nbetween permissions and rights.\n\n505\n00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:08.960\nAll right?\n\n506\n00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.710\nAnd it's pretty easy.\n\n507\n00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:13.130\nPermissions are over an object.\n\n508\n00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:15.950\nSo when you assign permissions,\nyou go to an object and\n\n509\n00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:17.590\nyou decide what permission somebody has.\n\n510\n00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:21.594\nFor example, I don't know,\nlet me just open up File Explorer here.\n\n511\n00:25:21.594 --> 00:25:26.366\nGo into my C drive and let me just make,\nso I don't mess anything up here,\n\n512\n00:25:26.366 --> 00:25:28.029\nI'll make a new folder.\n\n513\n00:25:30.374 --> 00:25:32.170\nI'll call it something like New Folder.\n\n514\n00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:34.150\nI'll pull up the properties for\nthat folder.\n\n515\n00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:38.530\nAnd I go to my security tab, and\n\n516\n00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:41.670\nthis is where I can control\nwhat permission somebody has.\n\n517\n00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:45.050\nIf I want to edit this list,\nI can come in here.\n\n518\n00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:49.140\nI can click Add and\nthen I can maybe, find somebody.\n\n519\n00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.070\nSay I wanna make sure\nthat authenticated users.\n\n520\n00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:53.710\nRight?\n\n521\n00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:56.510\nI can add them to\nthe access control list and\n\n522\n00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:59.490\nI can give them say modify\npermissions over this right.\n\n523\n00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:01.820\nThat is assigning permission.\n\n524\n00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:05.900\nPermission are over an object,\na file, a folder, a computer or\n\n525\n00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:09.180\nwhatever the case maybe, like\na computer object and active directory.\n\n526\n00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:10.830\nI can assign permissions over that.\n\n527\n00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:12.321\nIt's over a single object.\n\n528\n00:26:12.321 --> 00:26:14.367\nRights are systemwide.\n\n529\n00:26:14.367 --> 00:26:17.386\nYou have the right to\nlog on to this server.\n\n530\n00:26:17.386 --> 00:26:19.840\nYou have the right to\nlog on to this client.\n\n531\n00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.140\nYou have the right to change\nthe system time on this server.\n\n532\n00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:25.740\nYou have the right to reboot\nthis domain controller.\n\n533\n00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:28.660\nYou have the right to back up the server.\n\n534\n00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:29.230\nRight?\n\n535\n00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:34.620\nSo, Permissions over an object,\nRights are over a system itself.\n\n536\n00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:37.680\nAnd, that's really the big\ndifference there, Daniel.\n\n537\n00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:42.497\nAll right, now the last thing that\nthey call out on here is Auditing.\n\n538\n00:26:42.497 --> 00:26:46.375\nAnd Auditing just means I wanna document,\nor I wanna track,\n\n539\n00:26:46.375 --> 00:26:49.048\nI wanna log what is happening on a system.\n\n540\n00:26:49.048 --> 00:26:51.670\nAnd there's several different\ncategories that we can audit.\n\n541\n00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:53.770\nIf we go back over to\nmy domain controller,\n\n542\n00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:58.380\nI'll just open up my\nGroup Policy Management console here.\n\n543\n00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:04.452\nWe'll take a look at what we can do.\n\n544\n00:27:04.452 --> 00:27:08.796\nAll right, if I wanted to allow\nauditing on one of those servers.\n\n545\n00:27:08.796 --> 00:27:10.424\nThen, let's see what we got here.\n\n546\n00:27:10.424 --> 00:27:12.029\nI'm having trouble with my mouse today.\n\n547\n00:27:12.029 --> 00:27:16.966\nI'm gonna create a GPO and link it here.\n\n548\n00:27:16.966 --> 00:27:20.119\nAnd again we covered this kinda\nthing in several episodes as\n\n549\n00:27:20.119 --> 00:27:22.820\nfar as creating GPOs and things like that.\n\n550\n00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:25.220\nI'll go ahead and click, we're just\ngonna walk through it really fast,\n\n551\n00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:28.860\ncuz I wanna show you the settings for\nthis particular episode.\n\n552\n00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.795\nSo, in my Group Policy\nthat I just created.\n\n553\n00:27:31.795 --> 00:27:35.467\nIf I expand out policies and\nthen Windows settings.\n\n554\n00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:40.970\nAnd sometimes it takes a minute\nto expand out Windows settings.\n\n555\n00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:48.450\nAnd in Security settings, and then I've\ngot my Local Policies and my Audit Policy.\n\n556\n00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:52.760\nAnd here's the old, this is nine\ncategories that I can choose to audit.\n\n557\n00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:56.930\nThere's things like account log on,\ndirectory service access,\n\n558\n00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:59.610\nobject access, privileged use.\n\n559\n00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:01.200\nI've assigned privileges to my users.\n\n560\n00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.320\nAnd I wanna know when they take\nadvantage of those privileges.\n\n561\n00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:05.340\nObject access,\n\n562\n00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:09.350\nif I wanna know when somebody,\nmaybe I've got an employee handbook.\n\n563\n00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.940\nRight?\nThat's up on this file server, and\n\n564\n00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:15.010\nI need to know when somebody\ntries to make changes to that.\n\n565\n00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:15.867\nCuz they're not supposed to.\n\n566\n00:28:15.867 --> 00:28:18.029\nThey're only supposed\nto be able to read it.\n\n567\n00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:18.560\nRight?\n\n568\n00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:21.320\nOr I wanna see when somebody\nwrites to this folder.\n\n569\n00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.900\nWhatever the case is,\nwe can document that.\n\n570\n00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:27.790\nYou come in here, and you turn it on and\nyou decide you wanna do Success or\n\n571\n00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:28.550\nFailure or both.\n\n572\n00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:30.120\nAll right,\n\n573\n00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:34.610\nSuccess means they successfully did\nwhatever they it is they're trying to do.\n\n574\n00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:36.850\nFailure would be that they didn't succeed.\n\n575\n00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:37.690\nRight?\n\n576\n00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:41.330\nFor log ons, for example,\nI wanna audit successful log ons,\n\n577\n00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:43.910\nI wanna know who's logging\non to this server.\n\n578\n00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:47.850\nFailure, I might wanna know when\nsomebody is trying to log onto a machine\n\n579\n00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:49.380\nat three o'clock in the morning.\n\n580\n00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:50.900\nHopefully, they don't succeed.\n\n581\n00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:53.010\nBut, I need to know when\nthey made those attempts.\n\n582\n00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:54.820\nRight?\nI see these random attempts at three\n\n583\n00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:55.842\no'clock in the morning.\n\n584\n00:28:55.842 --> 00:28:57.400\nSomebody is logging into\none of my clients and\n\n585\n00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.320\nI know my building is\nclosed at that point.\n\n586\n00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:00.700\nI need to know that kind of thing.\n\n587\n00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:02.870\nThat's what auditing allows me to do.\n\n588\n00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:05.500\nSo you decide you wanna do success,\nfailure, or both.\n\n589\n00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.390\nSomething you've got to plan out.\n\n590\n00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:08.350\nAnd I'll click OK on that one.\n\n591\n00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:11.730\nAnd I'll go ahead and close this.\n\n592\n00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:17.060\nNow, that says,\nthat tells the server that's in this OU,\n\n593\n00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:19.430\nyou're allowed to audit object access.\n\n594\n00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:20.620\nAll right?\nCuz that's the category I\n\n595\n00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:21.260\nchose to turn on.\n\n596\n00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.960\nYou can do success or failure, but\n\n597\n00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:26.440\nwhat it didn't define,\nwas what object I wanna audit.\n\n598\n00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:30.820\nIt just said you're allowed to do it,\nso it's kind of a two step process here.\n\n599\n00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:35.420\nNow that I've got the capability turned\non, on that server, I'm gonna go over to\n\n600\n00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:41.510\nthat server and first, refresh policy\nbecause I just made that policy.\n\n601\n00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:45.510\nIf I can type and talk at the same\ntime and evidently I can't.\n\n602\n00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:47.780\nSo, let's throw in my\nlittle slash in there.\n\n603\n00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:50.610\nAnd, we'll update policy.\n\n604\n00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:53.770\nAnd, now that my server is gonna know\nthat he's allowed to do auditing,\n\n605\n00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:57.360\nbut I've still gotta define\nwhat I want to audit.\n\n606\n00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.990\nFor that we're gonna open\nup File Explorer, and\n\n607\n00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:02.520\nlet's say I drag them over here.\n\n608\n00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.690\nAnd let's make a new folder.\n\n609\n00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:06.930\nWe'll call it EmpDocs.\n\n610\n00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:11.920\nAnd in the side there I'm\ngonna make a new file.\n\n611\n00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:16.610\nLet's say I'm going to, and\nI will darn it, I said I would.\n\n612\n00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:19.446\nAnd we're gonna call this Handbook.\n\n613\n00:30:22.952 --> 00:30:28.365\nAll right, and if I wanna audit access to\nthis, now that my policy is refreshed.\n\n614\n00:30:28.365 --> 00:30:31.695\nAll right, so I'm gonna go to that\nobject and pull up its properties.\n\n615\n00:30:33.747 --> 00:30:37.707\nAnd I'm gonna go to security,\nbut I won't see it here.\n\n616\n00:30:37.707 --> 00:30:42.507\nI've gotta click Advanced, and\nthen over on the Auditing tab.\n\n617\n00:30:42.507 --> 00:30:45.757\nAnd this is where I can turn\non the auditing capabilities.\n\n618\n00:30:45.757 --> 00:30:49.857\nAnd I'll say Edit and Add.\n\n619\n00:30:49.857 --> 00:30:51.741\nAll right, who do I wanna audit?\n\n620\n00:30:51.741 --> 00:30:57.344\nMaybe all my users are allowed to come\nin here, but my contractors are not.\n\n621\n00:30:57.344 --> 00:30:59.980\nRight, so\nI could pick to choose just those.\n\n622\n00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:04.320\nYou can decide who you wanna audit, or\nI'm gonna do like authenticated users,\n\n623\n00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.250\nwhich would just be everybody.\n\n624\n00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:09.460\nSo first you decide, what object,\nand you go to that object,\n\n625\n00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:12.800\nyou pull up its properties, you go to\nthe Security tab, you click Advanced.\n\n626\n00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:15.030\nThen you decide, who do you wanna audit?\n\n627\n00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:17.970\nWho do I need to track that's\ndoing something to this?\n\n628\n00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:19.610\nI said, authenticated users.\n\n629\n00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:21.980\nThen you gotta decide\nwhat you wanna audit.\n\n630\n00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:23.990\nRight?\nAnd you can be very specific,\n\n631\n00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:29.200\nif everybody is supposed to be able to\nread, do I really wanna audit read access?\n\n632\n00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.830\nI'm just gonna get a bunch of success\nmessages and that's okay, I expect that.\n\n633\n00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:35.837\nWhat I really want in my case is I\nwanna know when somebody is making\n\n634\n00:31:35.837 --> 00:31:36.558\nchanges to it.\n\n635\n00:31:36.558 --> 00:31:42.397\nSo I'm gonna wanna know when\nthey do write type permissions.\n\n636\n00:31:42.397 --> 00:31:45.745\nAll right, so create files, write data,\ncreate folders, append data,\n\n637\n00:31:45.745 --> 00:31:49.960\nI'll even do attributes, although that\nwouldn't be necessary in this case.\n\n638\n00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.620\nAnd I click OK.\n\n639\n00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:56.654\nAnd now it says that it's gonna audit when\nthey try to make changes to that document.\n\n640\n00:31:56.654 --> 00:32:01.484\nAnd I click OK, and OK, and OK.\n\n641\n00:32:01.484 --> 00:32:03.174\nAnd there we go.\n\n642\n00:32:03.174 --> 00:32:05.610\nNow, let's see if we can\nkick this in real quick.\n\n643\n00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:07.180\nI know we're getting a little short here.\n\n644\n00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:11.350\nI'm gonna open up that file and\nadd some content to it.\n\n645\n00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:12.981\nSave it.\n\n646\n00:32:12.981 --> 00:32:15.492\nAnd close it.\n\n647\n00:32:15.492 --> 00:32:19.700\nAll right, where you would see the results\nof auditing is in your security log.\n\n648\n00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:25.046\nSo you'd open up your Event Viewer, and\n\n649\n00:32:25.046 --> 00:32:30.234\nin here I'll open up my Security Log and\n\n650\n00:32:30.234 --> 00:32:35.121\nwe'll give it a second to populate.\n\n651\n00:32:37.641 --> 00:32:39.240\nAnd here we go.\n\n652\n00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.290\nLet's see if we got anything.\n\n653\n00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:42.600\nAnd there is some audits.\n\n654\n00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:46.404\nThis aren't the, there is an audit\nfailure down there as well.\n\n655\n00:32:46.404 --> 00:32:49.850\nI've got access.\n\n656\n00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:52.240\nAnd there, you can see,\nI'm trying to find the one.\n\n657\n00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.320\nYou can see a ton of\nentries get generated.\n\n658\n00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:00.640\nIt's one of the things that you've got to\nreally be careful with, because it will\n\n659\n00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.590\nfill up a log file really fast,\ngenerate a lot of entries.\n\n660\n00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:09.240\nThat's why I say the big part\nof auditing is planning it.\n\n661\n00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.130\nDeciding what it is you\nreally need to see.\n\n662\n00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:15.796\nYou've gotta be careful, cuz if I audit\ntoo much, like I said if they're supposed\n\n663\n00:33:15.796 --> 00:33:20.080\nto be able to read and I audit success\nread, I'm just filling up my log file.\n\n664\n00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:23.573\nNot that they take up much space,\nmaybe they can if you let them grow, but\n\n665\n00:33:23.573 --> 00:33:26.519\nthe biggest thing is being able\nto find the important stuff.\n\n666\n00:33:26.519 --> 00:33:29.737\nRight?\nIf I've got 100,000 successes,\n\n667\n00:33:29.737 --> 00:33:32.760\nand two failures, am I gonna see that?\n\n668\n00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:35.240\nRight?\nI'm scrolling, scrolling, scrolling, and\n\n669\n00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:37.140\nas I'm scrolling through here,\n\n670\n00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:40.820\nam I gonna notice that one little\nfailure that popped in there?\n\n671\n00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:42.060\nGood chance I might miss it.\n\n672\n00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:44.880\nSo, when it comes to auditing,\nyou gotta enable it.\n\n673\n00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:49.160\nYou've gotta pick the objects and\nthen you've gotta plan.\n\n674\n00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:53.160\nYou've got to make sure you decide\nwhat it is you actually want on it.\n\n675\n00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.440\nAnd, that allows me to track.\n\n676\n00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.460\nThere's industry regulations, like HIPAA,\n\n677\n00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:01.080\nsays I've got to know every time somebody\naccesses these healthcare records.\n\n678\n00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.106\nRight?\nThis is how we do things like that.\n\n679\n00:34:03.106 --> 00:34:07.250\n>> Yeah, auditing can definitely be\nas much of an art as it is a science.\n\n680\n00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:11.910\nSo it will take a little fine tuning for\nyou to be able to do that efficiently and\n\n681\n00:34:11.910 --> 00:34:15.840\neffectively for your environment but\nit is something we do need to do.\n\n682\n00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:19.730\nSo, well, you're gonna have to just\ndive into that pool and enjoy it.\n\n683\n00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:22.633\nMichael, is there anything else we need to\ntalk about before we close the show today?\n\n684\n00:34:22.633 --> 00:34:23.498\n>> Oh, probably a million things.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n685\n00:34:23.498 --> 00:34:25.124\n>> But nothing has to do with printing or\n\n686\n00:34:25.124 --> 00:34:26.125\nauditing, so [LAUGH].\n\n687\n00:34:26.125 --> 00:34:28.440\n>> We're gonna wax eloquent about\nexistentialism or something.\n\n688\n00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.605\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right, Michael.\n\n689\n00:34:30.605 --> 00:34:32.590\nThank you so much for\nthose demonstrations,\n\n690\n00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:36.090\nteaching us how to well, manage these\nprinters inside of our environment using\n\n691\n00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:37.830\nthe Windows Server Operating System.\n\n692\n00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:40.950\nIt's gonna be a handy tool for\nus, especially passing this exam.\n\n693\n00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:43.560\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for the ITProTV.\n\n694\n00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:45.590\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n695\n00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:46.300\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n696\n00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:47.859\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n697\n00:34:47.859 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:17.694\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.694 --> 00:00:20.773\nJoining me on the show today well\nis my good friend colleague Mr.\n\n5\n00:00:20.773 --> 00:00:22.890\nMike Rodrick how's it going today Mike?\n\n6\n00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.110\n>> Oh its going great Daniel.\n\n7\n00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.200\nI'm excited to be here we're\ncontinuing on with our MTA content,\n\n8\n00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.720\nand in this episode we're gonna be looking\nat server virtualization something that's\n\n9\n00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.690\nI don't even know if I want to say its\nthe buzzword now because its beyond that.\n\n10\n00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.600\nIt is gonna be in just about every\nnetwork that you go to nowadays.\n\n11\n00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.360\n>> Yeah, virtualization's been around for\na little while now, so\n\n12\n00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.480\nit's something that we need\nto have a good grasp and\n\n13\n00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.900\nunderstanding of before we get\ninto this type of job role.\n\n14\n00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.580\nIf you're gonna be supporting IT,\n\n15\n00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.440\nbeing in the IT business, virtualization\njust walks hand in hand with it.\n\n16\n00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.250\nAnd basically all we're doing is we're\nsaying, you know what, we're gonna take\n\n17\n00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.580\nthat operating system, the software\nthat we use to put on hardware, and\n\n18\n00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.070\nwe're gonna put it on hardware, but in a\ndifferent way so that everyone can use it.\n\n19\n00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.705\nIt's a little bit about sharing.\n\n20\n00:01:07.705 --> 00:01:10.990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Sharing, caring all that good\n\n21\n00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.330\n>> So Mike, that's what you're here for.\n\n22\n00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.060\nYou're really going to help\nus demystify a little bit and\n\n23\n00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.450\nunderstand this topic better.\n\n24\n00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.240\n>> I'm sure gonna try.\n\n25\n00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.450\nVirtualization, the concept, then again,\nfor this exam, don't worry about,\n\n26\n00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.580\nI mean we're going to go through the\nprocess of setting up a virtual server.\n\n27\n00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.460\nI'm going to show you a bunch of\nthe options, the configuration that\n\n28\n00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.740\nyou want to do to one of those machines,\nbut I don't want you to think that\n\n29\n00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.840\nto get into this exam you've gotta be able\nto install hyper v and all of this stuff.\n\n30\n00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.190\nYou just gotta have a good grasp of what\nit is, some of those basic configurations,\n\n31\n00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.730\noptions that we can set on these virtual\nservers and just understand that process.\n\n32\n00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.150\nSo, first, as Daniel explained there, the\nwhole idea behind server virtualization is\n\n33\n00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.030\nto separate the operating system\nfrom the physical hardware, right.\n\n34\n00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.390\nBecause nowadays when you go out and\nbuy a server those servers are beefy.\n\n35\n00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.200\nThey've got four quad core processors\nin them, they've got 64 gigs or\n\n36\n00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.740\nmore of RAM in there.\n\n37\n00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.770\nThey're attached to dozens of drives or\nthey're attached to SANS,\n\n38\n00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:06.920\nthey got tons of storage.\n\n39\n00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.660\nAnd you're not gonna take one of those\nmachines, throw it in your rack, and\n\n40\n00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.600\ninstall Active Directory and DNS on it,\n\n41\n00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.320\nbecause you're only using a percentage\nof all of those resources right.\n\n42\n00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.152\nSo what we're gonna do is we're\ngoing to take those resources and\n\n43\n00:02:21.152 --> 00:02:24.234\nwe're gonna divide them up\namongst virtual servers.\n\n44\n00:02:24.234 --> 00:02:30.010\nOn the physical machine we're\ngonna run some type of hypervisor.\n\n45\n00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.820\nIn a Microsoft world that's gonna be hyper\nv and that's a type one hypervisor and\n\n46\n00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.000\nit sits in between the hardware,\nthe physical hardware and\n\n47\n00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.330\nour guest operating systems that we're\ngonna create, our virtual servers.\n\n48\n00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.020\nAnd that hypervisor is what\nallows all these different\n\n49\n00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.200\nguest operating systems\naccess to that hardware.\n\n50\n00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.750\nAnd it's like the traffic police,\n\n51\n00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.200\nyou know, that's controlling\nthe access to that hardware.\n\n52\n00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.210\nAnd each one of those guest operating\nsystems is a separate server,\n\n53\n00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.620\nit's just virtual instead of physical.\n\n54\n00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.745\nSo now I can take that one physical\nmachine that has dual quad cores or\n\n55\n00:03:06.745 --> 00:03:08.540\n4our quad cores in there and\n64 gigs of RAM,\n\n56\n00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.370\nand I can run ten virtual\nservers on top of that.\n\n57\n00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.250\nSo take one physical machine and\nend up with ten individual servers\n\n58\n00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.520\nthat my network sees, and we do that again\nto take advantage of those resources.\n\n59\n00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.020\nThink about when our network\nhere started going to virtual.\n\n60\n00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.760\nWe had fifteen,\neighteen physical servers in our closet.\n\n61\n00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.470\nNow that we virtualized\neverything we're down to three.\n\n62\n00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.120\nAnd the only reason there's three\nis because we want redundancy and\n\n63\n00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.170\nfault tolerance, right?\n\n64\n00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.100\nWe could, really,\ntake one of those servers and\n\n65\n00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.490\nrun just about everything on it.\n\n66\n00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.230\nWe're not a huge shop.\n\n67\n00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.980\nSo, it saves a lot of power, because\nI'm only powering one physical machine,\n\n68\n00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.710\nwhich means I'm generating\na lot less heat.\n\n69\n00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.670\nWhich means I save on air conditioning,\nI save on rack space,\n\n70\n00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.050\nit's a much greener solution.\n\n71\n00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.480\nMoving a virtual machine\naround is super easy,\n\n72\n00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.030\nbacking them up,\nbecause they're all just files.\n\n73\n00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.320\nIt's a pretty cool process.\n\n74\n00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.890\nSo that's some basics of virtualization.\n\n75\n00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.670\nBut let's get into what\nthe objectives call out, and\n\n76\n00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.570\nDaniel what I've got here is I've\nremoted into our hyper v server.\n\n77\n00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.300\nSo I've got my hyper v server set up here,\nagain hyper v is Microsoft's\n\n78\n00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.050\nvirtualization solution, and\nit is a type one hypervisor,\n\n79\n00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:24.990\nversus a type two which would be\nmore like Virtual PC or Virtual Box.\n\n80\n00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.940\nThese are applications that you\nrun on your operating system and\n\n81\n00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.320\nit allows some virtualization,\nbut it's not enterprise level.\n\n82\n00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.300\nThat's great for\ntest environments things like that,\n\n83\n00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.700\nwhen you close one of those virtual PC\nwindows, you're turning off that machine.\n\n84\n00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.170\nWith Hyper V and type one hypervisors,\nthese guys run more like a service,\n\n85\n00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:45.610\nlike you might think, in the background.\n\n86\n00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.510\nYou can remote into them and\nopen a window, but you close that window,\n\n87\n00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.660\nthe server is still running,\nproviding services to the network.\n\n88\n00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.960\nSo that's what they mean by\ntype one versus type two.\n\n89\n00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.450\nThe first thing I want to talk about,\nI guess, is the virtual hard drives.\n\n90\n00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:04.850\nThe virtual hard drive is a hard\ndrive that's been virtualized.\n\n91\n00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:05.860\nSimple enough, right?\n\n92\n00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:06.638\n>> And then.\n[LAUGH]\n\n93\n00:05:06.638 --> 00:05:07.480\n>> [LAUGH] And moving on.\n\n94\n00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.480\nNow a VHD, or a virtual hard drive,\n\n95\n00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.030\nis a file that is gonna be\ntreated like a hard drive.\n\n96\n00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.970\nIt's actually pretty cool.\n\n97\n00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.030\nYou create this VHD, this file,\nand to the operating systems,\n\n98\n00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.760\nto the computer,\nit looks like a hard drive.\n\n99\n00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.350\nI mean, you can mount it up and\n\n100\n00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.920\nyou can see it in Windows Explorer,\nyou can save files to it.\n\n101\n00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.140\nIn virtualization, heck, I'm installing\nan operating system into this VHD,\n\n102\n00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.380\ninto this file.\n\n103\n00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.000\nRight?\nAnd it's just a file that resides on\n\n104\n00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.220\na physical hard drive.\n\n105\n00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.910\nAnd I can take that VHD and I can move\nit from one server to the other, right?\n\n106\n00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.900\nFor when we talk about fault tolerance,\n\n107\n00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.160\nif I've got a virtual server running\non one physical machine, and\n\n108\n00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.620\nthat physical machine's getting ready to\nfail, depending on how I've got it set up,\n\n109\n00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.330\nit can actually move that entire virtual\nserver to another physical machine.\n\n110\n00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.350\nJust grab that hard drive move it over, or\ntypically we're using shared storage so\n\n111\n00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.970\nthey don't even have to move that,\nit's just moving the configuration files.\n\n112\n00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.130\nBut VHDs are my virtual hard drives,\n\n113\n00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.680\nso those become the hard drives for\nthe virtual servers that we create.\n\n114\n00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.360\nNow Windows,\nwe've got two formats that we can create.\n\n115\n00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.760\nWe've got VHD, which has been around\nsince Microsoft started doing\n\n116\n00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.310\nthe virtualization, and\nnow we have a new one called VHDX.\n\n117\n00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.260\nThat's the newer type of virtual\nhard drive that I can create and\n\n118\n00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.290\nthe big difference there\nis size limitations.\n\n119\n00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:25.880\nAnd let me show you, on my screen here,\n\n120\n00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.520\nwhat i'm gonna do is I'm just\ngonna click new hard disc and\n\n121\n00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.570\nwalk through this wizard because it\nwill show us the options we have.\n\n122\n00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:36.710\nI'll click next and there's my first\nchoice, do I want to create a VHD or\n\n123\n00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.190\ndo I want to create a VHDX?\n\n124\n00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:43.090\nYou can see the big limitation here\nis two terabytes size limit for\n\n125\n00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:44.990\nthe virtual hard drives.\n\n126\n00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.870\nVHDX, 64 terabytes, all right.\n\n127\n00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.515\nSo a lot larger,\nit supports a much larger size.\n\n128\n00:06:51.515 --> 00:06:56.260\n[COUGH] But if you note down here\nthe format is not supported in OS\n\n129\n00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.060\nsystems earlier than Server 2012.\n\n130\n00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:04.080\nSo really this for our later,\nour newer, operating systems.\n\n131\n00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.770\nIf you've got a choice, and\nyou're installing 2012 or\n\n132\n00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.790\nanything like that,\nyou definitely want to go with the VHDX.\n\n133\n00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.960\nI'm going to go with VHD simply\nbecause we're working with 2008 R2 in\n\n134\n00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.700\nthis particular setup,\non the MTA they focus on 2008 R2.\n\n135\n00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:22.270\nSo we'll go VHD, click next,\n\n136\n00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:27.480\nthen I've gotta choose if it's gonna\nbe fixed, dynamic, or differencing.\n\n137\n00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:32.720\nNow fixed size means if\nI create a 20 gigabyte\n\n138\n00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.020\nvirtual hard drive it's going to create\na file that's 20 gigabytes in size.\n\n139\n00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:41.113\nIt's going to go ahead and claim all of\nthe space on the physical storage media.\n\n140\n00:07:41.113 --> 00:07:45.649\nIt's going to create something that's\n20 gigabytes in size even though\n\n141\n00:07:45.649 --> 00:07:48.601\nthere's nothing in it,\nit's a blank file, but\n\n142\n00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:53.511\nit is going to claim 20 gigabytes worth\nof physical storage space, all right?\n\n143\n00:07:53.511 --> 00:07:57.742\nDynamically expanding, it starts\nout teenie-tiny I create that same\n\n144\n00:07:57.742 --> 00:08:02.950\n20 gigabyte drive, but its only going to\nbe a few megs in size if I go look at it.\n\n145\n00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:07.110\nAnd then as I start adding data to it,\nlike installing an operating system or\n\n146\n00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:13.750\nwhat have you, it will expand out to give\nit enough space up to the maximum, which\n\n147\n00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:17.830\nis the size you picked when you created\nit, let's say that 20 gigabytes in size.\n\n148\n00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:22.870\nSo instead of taking all the space ahead\nof time, I can slowly give it space,\n\n149\n00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:26.710\nright, as I put data in there,\nit slowly grows and grows and grows.\n\n150\n00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:28.980\n>> Now, Mike,\nthat brings up a good question,\n\n151\n00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:33.850\nis why would I ever use a fixed drive size\nif I'm just gonna be sitting there with\n\n152\n00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:38.240\nreally for\nthe most part a file with just a bunch\n\n153\n00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.705\nof blank space in it taking up like 20\nGigs, that's 20 gigs off of my hard drive.\n\n154\n00:08:42.705 --> 00:08:44.525\nI cannot use that space.\n\n155\n00:08:44.525 --> 00:08:47.825\nI've got this lovely dynamic\nportion I can go and say, hey,\n\n156\n00:08:47.825 --> 00:08:52.035\nonly use what you need up\nto what I've designed for\n\n157\n00:08:52.035 --> 00:08:55.660\nyou to be able to use, and\nI'm not eating up all those resources.\n\n158\n00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:59.020\nWhy the heck would I ever use the fixed?\n\n159\n00:08:59.020 --> 00:08:59.520\n>> The fixed?\n\n160\n00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.780\nYeah it's a great question, and\none most people are gonna have.\n\n161\n00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:06.730\nAnd the answer is performance, right,\nbecause if I have a dynamically expanding\n\n162\n00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:11.040\ndrive, what happens as I put more and\nmore data in there it has to stop and\n\n163\n00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.490\ngrow that file, and\nthat can hinder performance.\n\n164\n00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:18.940\nThe other thing that\ncan happen is the VHD,\n\n165\n00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.680\nthe virtual hard drive,\ncan become fragmented.\n\n166\n00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.410\nLet's say, you guys know how hard\ndrives work at this point, right?\n\n167\n00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:28.130\nWhen you created that dynamically\nexpanding drive, it was only a few megs,\n\n168\n00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:31.000\nit was blank, so\nit put it here on the hard drive, and\n\n169\n00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.930\nthen other people are using\nthat same server, or you are,\n\n170\n00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:37.290\nyou're creating other files and\nit's stacking them on that hard drive.\n\n171\n00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:41.230\nNow when that dynamically expanding drive\ntries to grow, there's things in the way.\n\n172\n00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:45.330\nThere's no more contiguous disk space so\nit has to jump around those recently\n\n173\n00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.200\ncreated files and\ngrab some space over there.\n\n174\n00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.250\nNow my VHD is fragmented,\n\n175\n00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.460\njust like we think of fragmenting\nfiles on our client operating system.\n\n176\n00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.950\nAnd that's gonna hurt performance because\nit's not all in contiguous space.\n\n177\n00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:02.210\nSo dynamically expanding drives\nare fantastic for test environments, for\n\n178\n00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.280\ndevelopment areas, things like that,\n\n179\n00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:08.420\nbecause as you said, I'm only gonna\nuse the space that I actually need.\n\n180\n00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:09.860\nThat's great.\n\n181\n00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.810\nBut in a production environment,\n\n182\n00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:16.610\n99.9% of the time you're gonna be using\nfixed because of that performance benefit.\n\n183\n00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:19.740\nWhen it comes to moving that file,\nit has one contiguous chunk of space.\n\n184\n00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.990\nIt's just the way we want to go.\n\n185\n00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:26.330\nI'm gonna choose dynamically expanding\nbecause this is a test environment right,\n\n186\n00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.880\nI'm not putting this in production and\nit will take a while.\n\n187\n00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:34.250\nLike if you create an 80\ngigabyte fixed drive it has to,\n\n188\n00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:37.640\njust like you would on a physical driver,\nit has to claim that space, it has to\n\n189\n00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:42.140\nformat it, it takes a little bit longer,\nwhereas if I do dynamic it's much quicker.\n\n190\n00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:46.540\nNow the differencing drive is something\nthat's a little bit trickier to\n\n191\n00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:50.120\nunderstand, but\nlet's see if we can put this in terms,\n\n192\n00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.140\ntrying to think of a good way to say that.\n\n193\n00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.400\nSometimes media gets to be\na little bit mentally confusing.\n\n194\n00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.140\nI can't even talk today.\n\n195\n00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:02.090\nA differencing drive is a way that I can\n\n196\n00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:06.380\ncreate a parent child\nrelationship between VHDs.\n\n197\n00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:10.900\nFor example, let's say that I need\nthree Server 2008 R2 machines.\n\n198\n00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:14.890\nI could create three fixed drives and\n\n199\n00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:19.700\ninstall 2008 R2 on each one of those,\nso install it three times.\n\n200\n00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:23.410\nThen I've got three separate virtual\nservers that I can install roles on,\n\n201\n00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:23.979\nwhat have you.\n\n202\n00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:29.090\nOr what I could do is I could\ninstall 2008 R2 once, create\n\n203\n00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:35.550\none parent VHD, then create three\n\n204\n00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:41.122\nchild VHDs based off that parent, and\nthen those three differencing discs,\n\n205\n00:11:41.122 --> 00:11:46.340\nthose child VHDs are what I use to\nmake my three servers that I need.\n\n206\n00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:50.290\nAnd so,\nwhen I go an install a role on one,\n\n207\n00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:54.990\nthose changes are stored in that\nchild VHD, that differencing drive.\n\n208\n00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:58.530\nThe parent drive,\nthe original installation, isn't modified.\n\n209\n00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:01.420\nThose are all the files that all three\nof those machines have in common, right,\n\n210\n00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.130\nthe base operating system.\n\n211\n00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:07.800\nChanges I make to each individual\nserver are gonna be stored in those\n\n212\n00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.550\ndifferencing drives,\nhence the name differencing, right.\n\n213\n00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:15.010\nStoring the changes or the differences\nbetween the parent drive and\n\n214\n00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:16.720\nthat virtual machine you created.\n\n215\n00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.820\nAnd that can be fantastic.\n\n216\n00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:22.560\nIn a test environment I don't wanna\nhave to install a server 2008,\n\n217\n00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.670\nthree, four, ten, 20 times.\n\n218\n00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:26.450\nCreate that one parent drive and\n\n219\n00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:30.360\njust create differencing drives\nevery time I need a new server.\n\n220\n00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:35.410\nBut we have a performance issue, because\nnow every time I fire up that machine,\n\n221\n00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:38.480\nit's got to hit the differencing drive and\nthat parent drive.\n\n222\n00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.370\nI fire up another server that's\nbased off of that parent,\n\n223\n00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:45.030\nit's got its own differencing drive but\nit's hitting that same parent drive.\n\n224\n00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:46.940\nNow I've got contention, right?\n\n225\n00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:51.030\nI've got two virtual servers that are both\nvying for time on that parent drive.\n\n226\n00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:52.120\nAll right.\n\n227\n00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.840\nSo again, great for production.\n\n228\n00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.410\nGreat for\nthrowing out machines really quick, but\n\n229\n00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:00.330\nnot ideal for production environments.\n\n230\n00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:03.320\n>> Yeah, it seems like every\ncool tool they give us to\n\n231\n00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:08.490\nmake our lives a little bit easier tend\nto give us performance degradation.\n\n232\n00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:15.480\nAnd it does really come down to okay, do I\nneed my life to be easier, or do I need my\n\n233\n00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:19.550\nperformance to be as spot on as possible,\nand you start playing the weighing game.\n\n234\n00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:24.910\nOkay, that server gets hammered daily, so\nwe've gotta go with performance on that.\n\n235\n00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:27.230\nThese servers they're not so\nimportant you know, we use them for\n\n236\n00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:31.440\ncertain things, they're not huge\nmissions critical kind of stuff.\n\n237\n00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:35.250\nMaybe I can add a little ease of my\nlife on that administration side and\n\n238\n00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.520\nuse some of the cool tools\nthey've given us to do that.\n\n239\n00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.240\nBut that's really what it boils down to,\nor at least it seems.\n\n240\n00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:41.920\n>> Yep, exactly.\n\n241\n00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.710\nAnd we're gonna show you, actually Hyper V\ndoes use those differencing drives\n\n242\n00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:47.610\nin a slightly different way.\n\n243\n00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:48.570\nAnd I'll show you.\n\n244\n00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:49.310\nAnd it is pretty cool.\n\n245\n00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:53.350\nAll right, so I'll go ahead and choose\nDynamically Expanding, we'll click Next.\n\n246\n00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:57.765\nI'll give it a name,\nI'll call this I don't know,\n\n247\n00:13:57.765 --> 00:14:01.390\nsvr01_0 for its first drive,\nor something like that.\n\n248\n00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:02.700\nWe'll click Next.\n\n249\n00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.300\nChoose my location, of course.\n\n250\n00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:06.870\nAnd then my size.\n\n251\n00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:09.810\nAnd for my size,\nI'm just gonna keep this sweet.\n\n252\n00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:13.830\nWe'll do 64 gigs, it's dynamically\nexpanding, it shouldn't take it very long.\n\n253\n00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:19.880\nAnd I'll click Next, and\nthen Finish and where do they go,\n\n254\n00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:26.040\nSQL and vms, and now if I go look in\nmy C: drive in a folder called vms\n\n255\n00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:31.820\nthere is my virtual hard drive that\nI just created, 64 gigs in size.\n\n256\n00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:35.800\nNotice it's only 136\nkilobytes at this point.\n\n257\n00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.966\n>> Yeah, that's tiny.\n\n258\n00:14:36.966 --> 00:14:37.472\n[LAUGH]\n>> It is.\n\n259\n00:14:37.472 --> 00:14:38.407\n[LAUGH] That's a big\n\n260\n00:14:38.407 --> 00:14:39.600\ndifference, all right.\n\n261\n00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.850\nAll right, so\nthat is creating a virtual hard drive.\n\n262\n00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:47.190\nNow, the next thing we wanna talk about\nis memory, but I wanna go ahead and\n\n263\n00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:49.180\nstart creating a virtual machine so\n\n264\n00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.010\nthat I can show you some of\nthese options as we go through.\n\n265\n00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.660\nSo i'm gonna go New and\nthen Virtual Machine, and\n\n266\n00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.480\nit launches my handy dandy wizard.\n\n267\n00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.380\nAnd I'm gonna click next, and\nI'm gonna call this guy SVR,\n\n268\n00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.260\nyou know what,\nI think I already have a server one.\n\n269\n00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.631\nWe'll call it server 101, all right.\n\n270\n00:15:05.631 --> 00:15:12.260\nClick Next, and then here I'm gonna\nchoose generation one or generation two.\n\n271\n00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:18.150\nGeneration two is obviously the later\nversion and it supports things like\n\n272\n00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:23.130\nbooting from a SCSI disc,\npixie boot with a standard\n\n273\n00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:27.750\nnetwork adapter, secure boot like,\nUEFI, things like that.\n\n274\n00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:30.830\nSo it's really the way you want to go, but\nagain it's another one of those things\n\n275\n00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:34.250\nthat only supports the latest operating\nsystems, 2012, windows 8 and later.\n\n276\n00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:38.240\nSo if you're working with 2008\nR2 you definitely want to stick\n\n277\n00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.096\nwith generation one, and\nyou can't change this after the fact.\n\n278\n00:15:42.096 --> 00:15:45.753\nSo choose wisely Padawan, right.\n\n279\n00:15:45.753 --> 00:15:47.633\nAll right we'll click Next.\n\n280\n00:15:47.633 --> 00:15:50.211\nAnd then how much memory\ndo I wanna give it?\n\n281\n00:15:50.211 --> 00:15:55.160\nI'm gonna go ahead and say, notice\nthis is what we call startup memory.\n\n282\n00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.960\nWe'll go back in and we'll look at\nthese configuration options, but\n\n283\n00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.150\nI want to give this guy.\n\n284\n00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:02.750\nI don't know two gigs of ram there.\n\n285\n00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:06.330\nI'm also gonna go ahead and say use\ndynamic memory, we'll come back and\n\n286\n00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:09.050\nwe'll see that after we create\nthis guy I'll click Next.\n\n287\n00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.920\nAnd then from my network I'm gonna go\nahead and choose a network here well,\n\n288\n00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.350\nyou know what Daniel I changed my mind\nlet's go back and talk about this.\n\n289\n00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:19.580\nMaybe we'll talk about it\nwhile we're going through it.\n\n290\n00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:22.670\nNow with memory,\njust like a physical machine, right.\n\n291\n00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:25.870\nIt's gotta have RAM to be able to operate.\n\n292\n00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:28.140\nSo you gotta choose how\nmuch you wanna give it.\n\n293\n00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:32.570\nNow, we're giving it, what we specify here\nis what's known as the startup memory.\n\n294\n00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:36.470\nAnd you wanna make sure that you\ngive that machine enough memory\n\n295\n00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.020\nto go through the boot process.\n\n296\n00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:42.130\nSo believe it or not, Daniel,\nthe startup memory for a 2008 R2, 512.\n\n297\n00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:44.340\n>> 512 megabytes.\n\n298\n00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:45.220\n>> Absolutely.\n\n299\n00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:46.670\n>> Well that's not a whole lot Mike.\n\n300\n00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:50.570\n>> It's not you know, I typically if i've\ngot the memory I'm gonna give it to it\n\n301\n00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:53.510\nbecause it's gonna make it\nload the operating system that\n\n302\n00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:56.576\nmuch faster especially through\nthe installation process.\n\n303\n00:16:56.576 --> 00:17:00.242\nBut what you got to keep in mind is you\nneed to make sure you assign enough\n\n304\n00:17:00.242 --> 00:17:03.119\nmemory, startup memory so\nthat the machine can boot.\n\n305\n00:17:03.119 --> 00:17:05.771\nMicrosoft has a page that you\ncan go to and you can look and\n\n306\n00:17:05.771 --> 00:17:09.567\nsee what the minimum boot requirements\nare for these operating systems again.\n\n307\n00:17:09.567 --> 00:17:13.610\n2008 R2 is actually 512.\n\n308\n00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:18.040\nThen below that, I've got use dynamic\nmemory for this virtual machine.\n\n309\n00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.738\nThis is a pretty cool feature.\n\n310\n00:17:19.738 --> 00:17:23.840\nThis allows Hyper-V to dynamically manage\n\n311\n00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:27.330\nthe memory that's being assigned\nto these virtual servers.\n\n312\n00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:31.790\nIn the past, you could not change\nthe amount of RAM a machine was assigned\n\n313\n00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:33.500\nwithout powering it down.\n\n314\n00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:37.210\nIf you had given this guy 2 gigs of RAM,\nand then later on you decide, you know\n\n315\n00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:42.150\nwhat, he'll run fine with just 1 gig,\nI can use the memory for something else.\n\n316\n00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:46.030\nYou'd have to power that machine down,\ngo into the Settings and\n\n317\n00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:49.080\nchange that memory allocation and\nthen power it back up.\n\n318\n00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.570\nWith dynamic memory, Hyper-V can do it.\n\n319\n00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:55.090\nIt can say, hey, you know what,\nthis guy's got 2 gigs of ram but\n\n320\n00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:58.180\nhe's only using about 800 megs right now.\n\n321\n00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.900\nI'm gonna reduce how much\nmemory's assigned to him.\n\n322\n00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.940\nAnd I can give it to this other guy cuz\nhe's chugging along, he needs more.\n\n323\n00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.260\nI'll go ahead and give it to him.\n\n324\n00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:11.200\nSo it can dynamically manage the RAM\nallocation on these virtual servers.\n\n325\n00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:11.770\nVery cool.\n\n326\n00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:14.850\nWe'll click Next.\n\n327\n00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:18.920\nFor the networking we've\ngot a few choices here.\n\n328\n00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.840\nThis one I will save until\nwe go into the wizard.\n\n329\n00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:24.520\nI'm just gonna click Private for\nnow, Click next.\n\n330\n00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.480\nAnd then, here we get to create a VHD.\n\n331\n00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:32.708\nNow, in this wizard, you can only\ncreate dynamically expanding drives.\n\n332\n00:18:32.708 --> 00:18:33.733\nAll right?\n\n333\n00:18:33.733 --> 00:18:34.840\nSo you see this first option.\n\n334\n00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:38.555\nUse this option to create\na dynamically expanding VHD.\n\n335\n00:18:38.555 --> 00:18:43.002\nI can use an existing virtual hard disk or\nattach a virtual hard disk later.\n\n336\n00:18:43.002 --> 00:18:46.632\nThe reason I wanna point this out is cuz I\njust told you fixed drives are the way to\n\n337\n00:18:46.632 --> 00:18:48.020\ngo for production.\n\n338\n00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:51.460\nWell, this wizard doesn't give you\nan option to create a fixed drive.\n\n339\n00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:53.950\nSo what you do is you do what we did here.\n\n340\n00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:58.762\nYou first create that fixed drive by\ngoing through the virtual Disk wizard,\n\n341\n00:18:58.762 --> 00:19:01.103\nright, create your 64 gig drive.\n\n342\n00:19:01.103 --> 00:19:04.847\nThen what you're gonna do is choose use an\nexisting as you go through this wizard and\n\n343\n00:19:04.847 --> 00:19:06.540\ngo and browse and find that.\n\n344\n00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:09.590\nNow remember I created dynamically\nexpanding just for the show,\n\n345\n00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:11.330\nbut let's pretend it was fixed.\n\n346\n00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:12.572\nI click Browse.\n\n347\n00:19:12.572 --> 00:19:14.371\nI'll go find that drive.\n\n348\n00:19:14.371 --> 00:19:15.417\nI'll click Open.\n\n349\n00:19:15.417 --> 00:19:16.170\nAll right?\n\n350\n00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:20.590\nSo you can either create a dynamically\nexpanding as you're creating the virtual\n\n351\n00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:24.230\nserver, or you can go ahead and\npre-make your fixed size drive and\n\n352\n00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:26.375\nthen just attach it when you're done.\n\n353\n00:19:26.375 --> 00:19:28.812\nI'll click Next, and then Finish.\n\n354\n00:19:30.891 --> 00:19:34.234\nAnd there you go,\nwe now have a new virtual server.\n\n355\n00:19:34.234 --> 00:19:36.816\nNow there's no operating system installed\non there or anything like that, right?\n\n356\n00:19:36.816 --> 00:19:39.370\nIt's just a blank hard drive.\n\n357\n00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:41.460\nSo let's take a look at some\nof the options here, for\n\n358\n00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.550\nthis guy,\nbefore we try to do anything else.\n\n359\n00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:47.799\nI'm gonna right-click on it and\nI'm going to choose Settings.\n\n360\n00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:51.310\nAnd in here we've got\na few different options.\n\n361\n00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:53.510\nFirst one is Add Hardware.\n\n362\n00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:57.090\nIt already comes with a few bits\nof hardware attached to it.\n\n363\n00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:59.710\nI can see there's two IDE controllers,\n\n364\n00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:02.700\nthere's a hard drive attached\nto that Controller 0.\n\n365\n00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.340\nThere's a DVD drive\nattached to Controller 1.\n\n366\n00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.600\nIts got a SCSI controller\nthere's nothing attached to it.\n\n367\n00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.882\nIts got one network adapter in there,\na couple COM ports,\n\n368\n00:20:10.882 --> 00:20:14.430\nit got my processor up here,\nthere's my memory that I have assigned.\n\n369\n00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:18.470\nIf I needed more, let's say I wanted to\nmake this a dual home to machine it's\n\n370\n00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:20.820\na server it probably need more\nthan one network adapter.\n\n371\n00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:22.990\nI can just go ahead and click Add, and\n\n372\n00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:25.605\nnow you see I have a second\nnetwork adapter over there.\n\n373\n00:20:25.605 --> 00:20:26.890\nRight?\n\n374\n00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:29.780\nIf I go back up, BIOS,\nnot a lot exciting here.\n\n375\n00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:33.300\nYou can choose,\nit's really difficult to do like an F8 and\n\n376\n00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.090\ntry to get into your boot\noptions on a virtual machine.\n\n377\n00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:38.170\nSo this is where you could choose\nyour startup order, right,\n\n378\n00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:40.760\ninstead of getting into the BIOS,\nyou do it here.\n\n379\n00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:46.230\nFor memory there's that 20 or the 2 gigs\nthat I assigned to it and you can see\n\n380\n00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:50.170\nit's got dynamic memory enabled because\nI did that when I created the machine.\n\n381\n00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:52.840\nThen I've got my minimum and\nmy maximum, so\n\n382\n00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:56.820\nas it's fluctuating that dynamic\nmemory this is where I can control.\n\n383\n00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.732\nThe lowest it'll be able to go and\nthe highest.\n\n384\n00:20:59.732 --> 00:21:05.487\nMaybe I never want it going over that\n2048 and that two gigs of RAM, all right?\n\n385\n00:21:05.487 --> 00:21:10.370\nSo you can set the minimum and the maximum\nwhen you do that dynamic memory.\n\n386\n00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:14.150\nIf I uncheck if I'm not doing dynamic\nmemory then I lose all of those options,\n\n387\n00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:17.870\nand it's just gonna have 2048,\nor 2 gigs, all the time.\n\n388\n00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:19.700\nWe'll leave it on dynamic.\n\n389\n00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:22.441\nAnd below that is my Memory Buffer.\n\n390\n00:21:22.441 --> 00:21:26.738\nWhat Windows is gonna do, what Hyper V\nis gonna do, it's gonna say all right,\n\n391\n00:21:26.738 --> 00:21:31.181\nyou've said, I could adjust the RAM\nsomewhere between 512 megs and 2 gigs.\n\n392\n00:21:31.181 --> 00:21:34.605\nThe server right now is using 1gig.\n\n393\n00:21:34.605 --> 00:21:38.541\nBut instead of dropping it down to\n1 gig it's gonna have a buffer.\n\n394\n00:21:38.541 --> 00:21:40.759\nAnd by default that's 20%.\n\n395\n00:21:40.759 --> 00:21:42.859\nSo what's 20% of a gig?\n\n396\n00:21:42.859 --> 00:21:45.703\n200 somewhat megabytes I think, right?\n\n397\n00:21:45.703 --> 00:21:49.794\nSo it's instead of dropping it down to a\ngig it's gonna drop it down to about 1,200\n\n398\n00:21:49.794 --> 00:21:51.040\nmegabytes or so, right?\n\n399\n00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.897\nMy math is not exactly correct but\nyou get the idea.\n\n400\n00:21:53.897 --> 00:21:57.269\nIt's gonna say, all right,\nthis is what the machine is using what it\n\n401\n00:21:57.269 --> 00:22:00.080\nneeds right now I'm gonna\ngive it 20% more than that.\n\n402\n00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:04.370\nThat way as new processes fire up or what\nhave you, it's got a little bit of room\n\n403\n00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:07.210\nbefore I have to actually\ndynamically adjust that amount.\n\n404\n00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:08.080\nAnd you can change this.\n\n405\n00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:11.330\nIf you're low on memory you're trying\nto split that up between many different\n\n406\n00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:16.100\nvirtual servers maybe you don't want a 20%\nbuffer, maybe you wanna do a 10% buffer.\n\n407\n00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:20.700\nOr maybe you find that that's causing some\nperformance hits because it's only got 10%\n\n408\n00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:24.170\nand once it hits that it has\nto readjust memory allocation.\n\n409\n00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:28.586\nSo maybe you wanna go to 30% or\nsomething like that, whatever you choose.\n\n410\n00:22:28.586 --> 00:22:31.715\nBelow that is our memory weight.\n\n411\n00:22:31.715 --> 00:22:35.355\nAnd what this is gonna do is\nspecify how important the RAM\n\n412\n00:22:35.355 --> 00:22:37.015\nis to this particular machine.\n\n413\n00:22:37.015 --> 00:22:41.415\nIf I'm dynamically expanding, or\ndynamically adjusting or allocating memory\n\n414\n00:22:41.415 --> 00:22:44.440\nbetween several different virtual\nmachines, and they're all asking for\n\n415\n00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:48.170\nmore, but I don't have enough to give\nthem all what they're asking for.\n\n416\n00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:50.020\nWhich one takes priority, all right?\n\n417\n00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:51.420\nSo that's the weight, here.\n\n418\n00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.509\nYou can say, all right, this machine,\nif it asks for more memory, give it to it.\n\n419\n00:22:54.509 --> 00:22:58.024\nThose other machines, if they ask for\nmore memory, try, but\n\n420\n00:22:58.024 --> 00:23:01.684\nthis guy absolutely needs it,\nand let him have a higher weight.\n\n421\n00:23:01.684 --> 00:23:02.288\nAll right.\n\n422\n00:23:02.288 --> 00:23:04.702\nSo a lot of things we can\nadjust in there in the memory.\n\n423\n00:23:04.702 --> 00:23:08.675\nYou've got your startup RAM, you got\nyour dynamic memory, the minimum and\n\n424\n00:23:08.675 --> 00:23:09.429\nthe maximum.\n\n425\n00:23:09.429 --> 00:23:14.158\nThen you've got the memory buffer and\nthen you got that memory weight.\n\n426\n00:23:14.158 --> 00:23:18.350\nThe next thing we wanna talk about\nis going to be the network adapters.\n\n427\n00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:22.810\nNow, I've got that one, that was created\nwhen I created the virtual server itself,\n\n428\n00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:25.360\nand I picked Private1.\n\n429\n00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.680\nThe second one here is not connected.\n\n430\n00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:31.230\nThis is where you're basically\nplugging it into a network, right?\n\n431\n00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:35.330\nAnd I can chose from all the networks\nthat have already been created.\n\n432\n00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:36.530\nThat's the key here.\n\n433\n00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:38.390\nThese virtual networks\nhave already been created.\n\n434\n00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.160\nI'll show you where I can\ncreate those here in a second.\n\n435\n00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.540\nI'll go ahead and connect it to,\nI don't know, we'll just pick one there.\n\n436\n00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:48.372\nAll right, and then once I wanna save,\nobviously, there's many,\n\n437\n00:23:48.372 --> 00:23:50.092\nmany more settings in\nhere that we can go over.\n\n438\n00:23:50.092 --> 00:23:53.771\nWe've got lots of great episodes in our\nlibrary that deal with virtualization\n\n439\n00:23:53.771 --> 00:23:55.956\nwhere we cover each one of those for\nthis exam.\n\n440\n00:23:55.956 --> 00:23:59.746\nI just wanna focus on the options\nthat they're gonna be calling out and\n\n441\n00:23:59.746 --> 00:24:00.590\nasking you on.\n\n442\n00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:06.190\nI'll go ahead and click OK on that, and\nnow I've adjusted my settings for that.\n\n443\n00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:07.810\nNow let's talk about those networks again.\n\n444\n00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:10.990\nOver here, in Hyper-V,\nI've got my Virtual Switch Manager.\n\n445\n00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:14.830\nAnd this is where I can create\nnew virtual networks, right?\n\n446\n00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:18.270\nI have to decide,\nwhat do I want this network to do?\n\n447\n00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:18.940\nDo I want,\n\n448\n00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:23.940\nyou can create three types, you can\ncreate external, private, and internal.\n\n449\n00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:28.807\nExternal is gonna bind to a physical\nadapter in the Hyper-V host.\n\n450\n00:24:28.807 --> 00:24:32.822\nWhich means if I plug a virtual\nserver into that external network,\n\n451\n00:24:32.822 --> 00:24:36.170\nit'll have access to\nthe rest of the network.\n\n452\n00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:37.460\nTypically what I want to do, right?\n\n453\n00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:41.760\nIf it's a file server, I need clients on\nmy network to be able to connect to it, or\n\n454\n00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.610\nit's not much of a file server.\n\n455\n00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:45.690\nOr if I need to give it Internet access or\n\n456\n00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:48.625\nanything like that,\nexternal is going to be the way to go.\n\n457\n00:24:48.625 --> 00:24:52.760\nBut I can simply choose External\n> Create virtual switch.\n\n458\n00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.680\nI'll give it a name,\nwe'll call it MTA External.\n\n459\n00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:59.910\nAnd then I've gotta choose what\nnetwork adapter to bind it to.\n\n460\n00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:03.590\nNow it might scream at me because I\nthink one's already bound to this.\n\n461\n00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:06.200\nYou can only have one external network\n\n462\n00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:09.800\nper physical network adapter\nin the physical server.\n\n463\n00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.120\nSo let's see,\nI don't think anybody's using this one.\n\n464\n00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:16.050\nSo I'll grab that one, and\nI'll go ahead and click Apply.\n\n465\n00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:20.770\nAnd actually, I'm gonna not do that.\n\n466\n00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:22.740\nI almost forgot,\nif you create an external,\n\n467\n00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:25.500\nwhat's gonna happen is, I don't know\nif I'm connected to that there.\n\n468\n00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.174\nI don't know which network\nI'm remoted into that.\n\n469\n00:25:27.174 --> 00:25:31.018\nAnd if I go and create a virtual network\nconnection here using that external\n\n470\n00:25:31.018 --> 00:25:34.557\noption, it's gonna temporarily\ndisable the network adapter, and\n\n471\n00:25:34.557 --> 00:25:36.950\nI might lose connectivity\nto my virtual host.\n\n472\n00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:39.770\nSo let me not create that,\nI'm gonna cancel that.\n\n473\n00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:40.606\n>> Err on the side of safety, Michael.\n\n474\n00:25:40.606 --> 00:25:42.210\n>> Yes.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n475\n00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:44.019\n>> And that's typically why you have\n\n476\n00:25:44.019 --> 00:25:47.610\nmultiple network adapters in\nyour Hyper-V server, right?\n\n477\n00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:51.110\nOne for management purposes,\nlike what I'm doing now, remoted into it.\n\n478\n00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:55.680\nSeparate physical network adapters,\nthat I can create virtual networks with,\n\n479\n00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:59.140\nthat don't affect my management\nbandwidth or my management interface.\n\n480\n00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:04.860\nThe other ones that I can create in there,\noops, I mis-clicked.\n\n481\n00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:07.470\nThe other ones that I\ncan create is Internal.\n\n482\n00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:11.690\nAnd if I do Internal, you can see,\ncreates a virtual switch.\n\n483\n00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:15.090\nCan only be used by virtual machines\nthat run on this physical computer\n\n484\n00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:17.790\nbetween the virtual machines and\nthe physical computer.\n\n485\n00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:19.300\nThat's the key there.\n\n486\n00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:23.030\nInternal means, if I connect\nvirtual servers to that internal,\n\n487\n00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:24.350\nthey can communicate with each other.\n\n488\n00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:27.170\nLet's say I've got three\nvirtual servers on here.\n\n489\n00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:29.520\nI connect them to an internal network,\n\n490\n00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:33.720\nthey can communicate with each other\nas well as the Hyper-V host itself.\n\n491\n00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:37.735\nSo if I need to copy files or\nanything like that between the host and\n\n492\n00:26:37.735 --> 00:26:40.600\nthose virtual machines,\nthen internal's gonna be the way to go,\n\n493\n00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.030\nif they don't need access\nto the rest of the network.\n\n494\n00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:46.475\nI typically use this when I'm\ndoing my test, my development.\n\n495\n00:26:46.475 --> 00:26:50.000\nI don't want those machine reaching out\nand talk to the rest of the network.\n\n496\n00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.040\nLet's say you're trying to test a\ndeployment on a server that you've got in\n\n497\n00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.270\nyour physical environment.\n\n498\n00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:58.560\nYou've got a virtual machine\nthat mimics that, well,\n\n499\n00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.890\nthat duplicates that machine so\nyou can do your testing on it.\n\n500\n00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:03.980\nYou can't have it connected to the\nphysical network because now you're gonna\n\n501\n00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:05.700\nhave a duplicate name, duplicate SSID.\n\n502\n00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.370\nThings like that, right?\n\n503\n00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:10.455\nWith my internals, I don't have to\nworry as much about patching them.\n\n504\n00:27:10.455 --> 00:27:12.411\nI can do quick tests and blow them away.\n\n505\n00:27:12.411 --> 00:27:14.203\nThey're never gonna\nconnect to the Internet,\n\n506\n00:27:14.203 --> 00:27:15.928\nthey're not gonna get any viruses, right?\n\n507\n00:27:15.928 --> 00:27:20.680\nThey're not connected to the rest of my\nnetwork, just to the host and those VMs.\n\n508\n00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.660\nPrivate would be VMs only,\n\n509\n00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:27.530\nnot even the host machine can\ncommunicate with those virtual machines.\n\n510\n00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:31.690\nAnother one you would use typically\nin test or development environments.\n\n511\n00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:33.740\n>> Now, Mike, can you jump around\nthese different environments?\n\n512\n00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:37.130\nSo if I'm in a external network and\nI'm like, you know what,\n\n513\n00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:38.750\nI need to make this\nthing go super private.\n\n514\n00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:41.980\nI'm gonna install some, what I think\nis malware software or something and\n\n515\n00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:44.120\nsee if it causes havoc.\n\n516\n00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:47.790\nCan I jump in to that private network,\ndo what I need to do, fix it all up, and\n\n517\n00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:49.730\nthen jump back in to the external?\n\n518\n00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:51.400\n>> Absolutely, and\nI do that all the time, right?\n\n519\n00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.532\nIf I'm creating those machines I\nmight want to temporarily give\n\n520\n00:27:54.532 --> 00:27:57.620\nit external access,\nlet me do some Windows updates.\n\n521\n00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:59.510\nAnd then switch it back\nto that internal network.\n\n522\n00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:02.460\nSo all you're doing is,\nlet's take one of these machines here.\n\n523\n00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:06.650\nI'll just pull up its settings, and\nI can go to that network adapter,\n\n524\n00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:07.940\nand say, you know what?\n\n525\n00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:10.900\nLet's connect over to\nthe external network.\n\n526\n00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:13.639\nApply those changes, and\nyou can do this while the machine's on.\n\n527\n00:28:13.639 --> 00:28:16.589\nYou can't add hardware,\njust like a physical machine,\n\n528\n00:28:16.589 --> 00:28:19.730\nI can't add a new network adapter\nif the machine is running.\n\n529\n00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:21.730\nI have to power it down and add it.\n\n530\n00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:25.880\nSame thing here, I can't add new hardware\nif the machine is up and running.\n\n531\n00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:29.120\nBut as far as changing what\nnetwork it's connected to,\n\n532\n00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:32.410\nthat's like going into your server\ncloset and moving cables around.\n\n533\n00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:34.700\nYou don't have to shut that\nserver down to do that.\n\n534\n00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:37.080\nYou're not gonna have to\nshut it down here either.\n\n535\n00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.240\nSo you absolutely can switch it.\n\n536\n00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.350\nNow it's connected to\nthat external network.\n\n537\n00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:45.966\nAll right, let's fire up one of\nthese machines here, Daniel.\n\n538\n00:28:45.966 --> 00:28:47.230\nWe'll see what we've got.\n\n539\n00:28:49.496 --> 00:28:51.240\nLet me start this guy up.\n\n540\n00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.832\nSo this is one that we created earlier.\n\n541\n00:28:52.832 --> 00:28:56.168\nWe didn't want to bore you guys with\nthe watching the install process\n\n542\n00:28:56.168 --> 00:28:59.230\nof Server 2008, and\nI think this guy is running 2008.\n\n543\n00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:00.842\nWe shall find out [LAUGH].\n\n544\n00:29:00.842 --> 00:29:02.061\n>> [LAUGH] Which is he?\n\n545\n00:29:02.061 --> 00:29:05.830\n>> Yeah, cuz there are a couple more\nthings that I wanna show you here.\n\n546\n00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:10.515\nWe've talked about the virtual hard\ndrives, the idea behind virtualization.\n\n547\n00:29:10.515 --> 00:29:14.240\nWe've talked about that dynamic memory,\nreally cool feature there.\n\n548\n00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.934\nWe talked about the different networks,\nthe external, the internal,\n\n549\n00:29:16.934 --> 00:29:17.607\nand the private.\n\n550\n00:29:17.607 --> 00:29:19.703\nThe last thing they're\ngonna call out on the exam,\n\n551\n00:29:19.703 --> 00:29:22.749\nthat we've got to be familiar with,\nis something known as checkpoints.\n\n552\n00:29:22.749 --> 00:29:27.305\nAnd checkpoints are basically a saved\nstate, all right, or almost like a restore\n\n553\n00:29:27.305 --> 00:29:31.476\npoint that you might be familiar with\nfrom your client operating systems.\n\n554\n00:29:31.476 --> 00:29:37.240\nThey're point-in-time\nsnapshots of that server.\n\n555\n00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:41.430\nAnd that's gonna create, and let's expand\nthis out, that's gonna create this\n\n556\n00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:46.160\ncheckpoint, this point-in-time,\nimage of that machine, if you will.\n\n557\n00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.840\nNow, what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna go over to this machine and\n\n558\n00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:51.190\nlet's install a role real quick.\n\n559\n00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:55.220\nI'll say Add Roles,\nwe'll launch this little wizard here.\n\n560\n00:29:55.220 --> 00:30:00.160\nAnd just for giggles, I'll do, Fax Server\nought to be quick and painless, right?\n\n561\n00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.079\nI say that, it's probably the longest\ninstalling roles [LAUGH].\n\n562\n00:30:04.079 --> 00:30:05.623\n>> [LAUGH] Two hours later.\n\n563\n00:30:05.623 --> 00:30:08.908\n>> Yeah, [LAUGH] we'll go Next\n> Next > Next > Next > Next.\n\n564\n00:30:08.908 --> 00:30:12.090\nI'm just clicking right through here,\ndoesn't matter, yada yada.\n\n565\n00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:13.600\nWow, it was-\n>> That is quite lengthy.\n\n566\n00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:15.329\n>> That was [LAUGH] a pretty long wizard.\n\n567\n00:30:15.329 --> 00:30:17.024\nDNS might have been\na little easier to install.\n\n568\n00:30:17.024 --> 00:30:17.906\n>> To get a little fax going.\n\n569\n00:30:17.906 --> 00:30:22.130\n>> [LAUGH] I was hoping it wouldn't take\nlong to finish so that was the idea.\n\n570\n00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:23.990\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ninstall this role.\n\n571\n00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:26.336\nWhile this is going though,\nlet me explain these checkpoints again.\n\n572\n00:30:26.336 --> 00:30:30.544\nPoint-in-time, just like your restore\npoints on your client machine at\n\n573\n00:30:30.544 --> 00:30:31.420\nhome, right?\n\n574\n00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:33.240\nThey're great for testing.\n\n575\n00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:36.980\nLet's say I'm getting ready to do some\nconfiguration change to this server, but\n\n576\n00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:39.150\nI'm worried,\nI'm not sure if it's gonna go well.\n\n577\n00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:43.380\nI can take a checkpoint first, and then\nI can go ahead and do my configuration.\n\n578\n00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:47.820\nAnd if something goes wrong, I'm gonna\nbe able to go back to that checkpoint.\n\n579\n00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:50.360\nAll right, so there it finished,\nI'll click Close.\n\n580\n00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:53.924\nAnd if I look at my roles we'll\nsee I now have Fax Server and\n\n581\n00:30:53.924 --> 00:30:56.832\nPrint Document Services\nrunning on this guy.\n\n582\n00:30:56.832 --> 00:31:01.281\nAll right,\nI'm gonna go back over here to Hyper-V and\n\n583\n00:31:01.281 --> 00:31:06.131\nI'm going to grab this snapshot and\nI'm going to apply it.\n\n584\n00:31:06.131 --> 00:31:09.822\nAll right, and it says are you sure\nyou want to apply the checkpoint?\n\n585\n00:31:09.822 --> 00:31:12.013\nThe current state will be lost.\n\n586\n00:31:12.013 --> 00:31:14.894\nAnd again, if it's a test gone wrong,\nthat's fine with me.\n\n587\n00:31:14.894 --> 00:31:16.031\n>> It's exactly what you want, right?\n\n588\n00:31:16.031 --> 00:31:17.210\n>> Yeah, shake your head.\n\n589\n00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:17.859\n>> Please.\n\n590\n00:31:17.859 --> 00:31:20.398\n>> Or\nyou can get really infinite loopy here and\n\n591\n00:31:20.398 --> 00:31:24.376\nyou can create a checkpoint before\nyou go back to your checkpoint, so\n\n592\n00:31:24.376 --> 00:31:27.280\nthat you could go back to the checkpoint,\nyeah.\n\n593\n00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.210\n>> Yeah.\n>> Exactly and-\n\n594\n00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:30.150\n>> It's called a time paradox, folks, and\n\n595\n00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:31.245\nwe all die.\n\n596\n00:31:31.245 --> 00:31:33.130\n[LAUGH]\n>> A black hole opens up here in\n\n597\n00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:33.672\nthe studio.\n\n598\n00:31:33.672 --> 00:31:34.554\n>> The universe collapses.\n\n599\n00:31:34.554 --> 00:31:37.150\n>> Yeah, [LAUGH] so\nI'm gonna go ahead and click Apply.\n\n600\n00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:42.420\nAll right, and then you'll see\nthat my machine is restoring.\n\n601\n00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:46.750\nAnd shouldn't take it too long,\n99%, there we go.\n\n602\n00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:49.166\nAnd look at there, 0 roles installed.\n\n603\n00:31:49.166 --> 00:31:51.390\nSo that's the idea behind\nthese checkpoints.\n\n604\n00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:53.396\nAnd you can create several checkpoints,\n\n605\n00:31:53.396 --> 00:31:55.869\nyou can have a whole tree\nof checkpoints down here.\n\n606\n00:31:55.869 --> 00:31:59.037\nAnd by using that Create\na Checkpoint before I roll back,\n\n607\n00:31:59.037 --> 00:32:02.602\nyou can actually branch the tree,\nit can get really confusing.\n\n608\n00:32:02.602 --> 00:32:04.646\nBut here's what you've gotta remember.\n\n609\n00:32:04.646 --> 00:32:08.622\n>> When you create a checkpoint, basically\nwhat Hyper-V is doing in the background is\n\n610\n00:32:08.622 --> 00:32:11.340\ncreating one of those differencing disks,\nright?\n\n611\n00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:14.720\nBecause you're saying I want to freeze\nthis computer the way it is right here.\n\n612\n00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.260\nAny new changes I make to it,\nlike the roll I installed,\n\n613\n00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:21.640\nare going to be stored in this AVHD,\nthat differencing disk.\n\n614\n00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:22.190\nAll right?\n\n615\n00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:25.890\nAnd then if I did a roll back to that\nprevious snapshot it's just gonna throw\n\n616\n00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:29.530\naway that differencing disk, all right,\nand then I'm back to that original drive.\n\n617\n00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:31.710\nSo remember what I said\nabout differencing disks?\n\n618\n00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:33.200\nThere's a performance issue, right?\n\n619\n00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:36.760\nBecause we're going through\nseveral drives to get the disk.\n\n620\n00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.590\nWe gotta connect to all these drives.\n\n621\n00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:40.370\nSo the same thing's gonna happen here.\n\n622\n00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:43.120\nIn a production environment, you start\nfeeding checkpoints on your production\n\n623\n00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:48.110\nserver, your performance is gonna\nslowly drop on those virtual servers.\n\n624\n00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:52.570\nSo Microsoft recommends that we\ndon't use checkpoints except for\n\n625\n00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:53.740\nthings like I just did.\n\n626\n00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:56.770\nBefore you make a big configuration\nchange go ahead and create a checkpoint.\n\n627\n00:32:56.770 --> 00:33:00.240\nThat way if something goes\nwrong you can roll it back.\n\n628\n00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.350\nBefore you put that Service Pack\n2 on there, checkpoint the thing.\n\n629\n00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:06.600\nThen if Service Pack 2 causes a problem,\nyou can just roll back, right?\n\n630\n00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.910\nThat's what we're gonna use them for.\n\n631\n00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:10.030\nNot permanent though.\n\n632\n00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:14.470\nOnce I have rolled that thing back,\nI'm typically gonna go and\n\n633\n00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:15.572\ndelete that checkpoint.\n\n634\n00:33:15.572 --> 00:33:16.670\nAll right?\nLike here,\n\n635\n00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:18.200\nI've already restored that machine.\n\n636\n00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:20.660\nIf I can find him, there he is.\n\n637\n00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:22.490\nSo he's back to zero roles.\n\n638\n00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:26.510\nI can go to that checkpoint and\nI can delete the checkpoint.\n\n639\n00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:28.360\n>> Yeah.\nThese things tend to pile up on us if we\n\n640\n00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:31.480\ndon't perform a little\npreventative maintenance on them.\n\n641\n00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:34.000\nSay, I've got some checkpoints\nfrom two years ago.\n\n642\n00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.682\nProbably not gonna need those,\nlet's go ahead and delete that.\n\n643\n00:33:36.682 --> 00:33:38.060\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Eating up disk space,\n\n644\n00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:39.030\nhurting performance.\n\n645\n00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:43.730\nI mean, again, they're great for what\nthey're for, but just keep in mind for\n\n646\n00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:44.522\nthe they're for.\n\n647\n00:33:44.522 --> 00:33:45.530\nAll right.\nLast thing, Daniel.\n\n648\n00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:48.010\nI think we've got to talk about\nwas the physical to virtual and\n\n649\n00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:49.310\nvirtual to physical.\n\n650\n00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:53.380\nAnd the concept is, let's say I've got a\nmachine that I want to virtualize, right?\n\n651\n00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:56.187\nWe talked about my network\nhere how we went from fifteen,\n\n652\n00:33:56.187 --> 00:33:57.820\neighteen physical servers down to three.\n\n653\n00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:59.190\nWe virtualized everything.\n\n654\n00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:01.410\nWell, do I want to start from scratch and\n\n655\n00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:05.610\ninstall the operating system,\nrecreate all the servers that I have?\n\n656\n00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:06.660\nNot really.\n\n657\n00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:08.810\nWhat I can do is I can do a conversion.\n\n658\n00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:11.410\nI can take a picture, basically,\n\n659\n00:34:11.410 --> 00:34:16.190\nof that physical hard drive and\nturn it into a virtual hard drive.\n\n660\n00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:16.752\nRight?\nAnd\n\n661\n00:34:16.752 --> 00:34:19.390\nthat's a physical to virtual conversion.\n\n662\n00:34:19.390 --> 00:34:23.350\nOnce I've created a virtual hard drive\nthat's a duplicate of that physical drive\n\n663\n00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:27.250\non that server, I go through my wizard and\nI create a new virtual machine.\n\n664\n00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:28.240\nOops, not import.\n\n665\n00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:30.210\nI create a new virtual machine.\n\n666\n00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:32.282\nAnd then when I get to that one page,\nright,\n\n667\n00:34:32.282 --> 00:34:34.790\nI point it to an existing\nvirtual hard drive.\n\n668\n00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:38.800\nAnd it's that VHD that I created\na copy of the physical drive from.\n\n669\n00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:42.350\nAnd now I've got a virtual\nrepresentation of that physical server.\n\n670\n00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:43.540\nIt's that easy, all right?\n\n671\n00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:44.770\nThat's what you do.\n\n672\n00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:46.420\nThere's a couple of ways you can do that.\n\n673\n00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:50.440\nYou've probably saw in my wizard, whoops\nand I clicked the wrong wizard again.\n\n674\n00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.750\nWhen we got to that one screen,\nNew Virtual Machine,\n\n675\n00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:56.580\nand I'm just gonna go through and\nuse the defaults here real quick.\n\n676\n00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:57.170\nAll right.\n\n677\n00:34:57.170 --> 00:35:01.920\nWhen we get to that hard drive screen,\nthere was an option, where did it go?\n\n678\n00:35:07.063 --> 00:35:10.400\nYou know, have I lost it?\n\n679\n00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.150\nOh, I'm sorry.\n\n680\n00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:12.390\nI went to the wrong one.\n\n681\n00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:14.510\nNew Virtual Hard Disk.\n\n682\n00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:15.180\nThere we go.\n\n683\n00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.850\nI did the New Virtual Machine there.\n\n684\n00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:20.890\nI'm gonna go back and use the VHD.\n\n685\n00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:22.250\nI'll click next.\n\n686\n00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:24.150\nWe'll do a dynamically expanding.\n\n687\n00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:25.640\nWe'll click next.\n\n688\n00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:27.420\nGive it a name.\n\n689\n00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:28.200\nAnd then here.\n\n690\n00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:31.558\nCopy the contents of\nthe specified physical disk.\n\n691\n00:35:31.558 --> 00:35:33.244\nAll right?\n\n692\n00:35:33.244 --> 00:35:37.140\nNow, if you're doing a bootable,\nthen this is not gonna work, right?\n\n693\n00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:41.050\nThis method, here,\nif you're copying data drives, works fine.\n\n694\n00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:42.910\nIf you need to do a bootable, and\n\n695\n00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:46.230\nI don't know why I clicked finish on that,\nthen you're gonna need a different tool.\n\n696\n00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:48.810\nMicrosoft provides one called Disk2vhd.\n\n697\n00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:50.980\nYou can download it free.\n\n698\n00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:51.990\nIt was from Sysinternals.\n\n699\n00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:53.312\nMicrosoft took over Sysinternals.\n\n700\n00:35:53.312 --> 00:35:58.560\nMark Russinovich,\nif I say his name correctly,\n\n701\n00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:02.880\nwritten so many really cool tools, but\nthis will allow you to go through and\n\n702\n00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:07.560\nyou can point it to a physical disk and\nyou can make a VHD out of it.\n\n703\n00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:10.320\nAnd it allows you to include,\nlike that system partition,\n\n704\n00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:14.150\nthat bootable part right, so that you\ncan get a true bootable VHD out of it.\n\n705\n00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:19.260\nThe other method is basically copying\nthe contents of a single volume.\n\n706\n00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:23.100\nAnd so, you might have issues\ntrying to create that bootable.\n\n707\n00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:26.480\nThe other thing you can do is\ngo from virtual to physical.\n\n708\n00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:27.970\nAt least they say that on the objectives.\n\n709\n00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:29.480\nI will tell you,\nyou go out there and search and\n\n710\n00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:32.020\nyou look and you'll find that there\nreally isn't anything on doing that.\n\n711\n00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:37.940\nWhat they mean is that\nI can take a VHD and\n\n712\n00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:43.710\nI can copy it over to a physical machine,\nand I can add it to its boot process.\n\n713\n00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:49.080\nYou can actually add to the boot list\non a physical machine a VHD file.\n\n714\n00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:51.130\nJust like you were doing\na dual boot system, right?\n\n715\n00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:53.690\nAnd so, when you boot that\nsystem up it's gonna say, hey,\n\n716\n00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:57.650\ndo you want me to boot to C:, or\ndo you want me to boot to this VHD file?\n\n717\n00:36:57.650 --> 00:37:02.140\nAnd I can choose that VHD file, and\nif that VHD file is running server\n\n718\n00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:04.192\n2008 R2 it's gonna boot that up and\nit's gonna run.\n\n719\n00:37:04.192 --> 00:37:05.180\nAll right?\n\n720\n00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:07.560\nSo it's a way that you\ncould do a dual boot.\n\n721\n00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:10.455\nWe've actually run machines\nhere in our network\n\n722\n00:37:10.455 --> 00:37:12.855\nthat had no operating system\ninstalled on them at all.\n\n723\n00:37:12.855 --> 00:37:15.975\nThe physical machine had\nno operating system.\n\n724\n00:37:15.975 --> 00:37:18.115\nIt had a drive that was formatted.\n\n725\n00:37:18.115 --> 00:37:23.052\nWe copied two separate virtual hard drives\nover to that physical disk, added them\n\n726\n00:37:23.052 --> 00:37:27.122\nboth to BCD, the boot configuration\ndatabase, and then when you started that\n\n727\n00:37:27.122 --> 00:37:31.672\nmachine up, you picked which virtual\nhard drive you wanted to boot to, right?\n\n728\n00:37:31.672 --> 00:37:33.272\nThat's really pretty cool, right?\n\n729\n00:37:33.272 --> 00:37:35.180\nI've never installed\nan operating system on there.\n\n730\n00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:38.340\nYou can actually deploy those out\nto machines on your network and\n\n731\n00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:39.470\nhave them boot to those and\n\n732\n00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:42.980\nnever touch a machine as far as\ninstalling the operating system goes.\n\n733\n00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:47.040\nSo when they say virtual to\nphysical conversion, it's not so\n\n734\n00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:51.810\nmuch that you're copying the contents\nof the VHD onto a physical disk, you're\n\n735\n00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:56.960\njust taking that VHD and you're saying\nI'm gonna allow this physical machine to\n\n736\n00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:01.730\nboot to that VHD and\nthat's the physical to virtual conversion.\n\n737\n00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:04.390\n>> Still two very cool\noptions that we can do\n\n738\n00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:07.900\nbecause we have these two\ntypes of virtualizations.\n\n739\n00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:12.330\nOne, obviously, going from virtual to\nphysical, and then the other way around.\n\n740\n00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:16.030\nYou never know which one of those is gonna\nbe helpful for you in your environment.\n\n741\n00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:19.108\nMike, is there anything else we need to\ncover when it comes to virtualization?\n\n742\n00:38:19.108 --> 00:38:21.543\n>> You know, for\nthis exam I would say no, all right?\n\n743\n00:38:21.543 --> 00:38:23.710\n[LAUGH] I mean, I could talk-\n>> [LAUGH] There is more!\n\n744\n00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:25.450\n>> I could talk about virtualization for\n\n745\n00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:28.400\ndays on end but,\nthat's not what we need for this exam.\n\n746\n00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:31.440\nRemember, studying for\nthis MTA you've gotta know the basics,\n\n747\n00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:34.940\nyou've gotta understand where would you\nuse this, why would you use this, and\n\n748\n00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:36.450\na little bit about it.\n\n749\n00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:39.120\nIf you want more information on\nvirtualization make sure you check out\n\n750\n00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.520\nthe other episodes in our library.\n\n751\n00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:41.360\n>> Awesome.\nVery cool.\n\n752\n00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:44.370\nThank you so much for\nthose demonstrations and explanations.\n\n753\n00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:45.590\nVery skillful, Michael.\n\n754\n00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:47.145\nYou are learned man.\n\n755\n00:38:47.145 --> 00:38:49.420\nAs for you out there, hopefully you\nare a little more learned at the end of\n\n756\n00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:51.860\nthis episode, but\nwe have come to the end of it.\n\n757\n00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:53.050\nSo, we're gonna sign off.\n\n758\n00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:54.730\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n759\n00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:55.490\n>> And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n760\n00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:57.398\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n761\n00:38:57.398 --> 00:38:58.490\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.748\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n4\n00:00:17.748 --> 00:00:22.130\nHere with me today is well, it's Mike\nRodrick, how's it going today Michael?\n\n5\n00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.280\n>> It's going great Daniel.\n\n6\n00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.280\nI'm excited to be here,\n\n7\n00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:30.170\nwe're continuing on with our MTA server\nadministration fundamentals episodes.\n\n8\n00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.250\nAnd in this one, we're gonna be\ndiving in to Active Directory.\n\n9\n00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.043\nWe actually go a lot of things we\nwanna cover with Active Directory.\n\n10\n00:00:36.043 --> 00:00:40.056\nThis first one is gonna focus\nin on accounts and groups.\n\n11\n00:00:40.056 --> 00:00:44.433\nAnd this is a very important part\nof managing Active Directories, so\n\n12\n00:00:44.433 --> 00:00:47.986\nwe need to have a good knowledge\nof what we do with these.\n\n13\n00:00:47.986 --> 00:00:51.762\nHow we use them to effectively\nadminister permissions, and\n\n14\n00:00:51.762 --> 00:00:54.610\nuser access and all kinds of fun stuff.\n\n15\n00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.500\n>> Yeah, I gotta be honest with you,\nwhen I think the words Active Directory,\n\n16\n00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.408\nor say the words Active Directory,\nI think user and group administration.\n\n17\n00:01:00.408 --> 00:01:03.432\nBecause it's where I spend the bulk,\na lot of my time anyway,\n\n18\n00:01:03.432 --> 00:01:05.950\nwhen I'm in a Windows Server environment.\n\n19\n00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.990\nI'm always creating new users, I have\nto set new groups, permissions thereof.\n\n20\n00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.910\nGotta make sure that if I have somebody\nthat comes in they're in the right\n\n21\n00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:13.730\ndepartment.\n\n22\n00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.570\nEverything is set as it needs to be.\n\n23\n00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.160\nAnd typically I'm pulling up\nthe good old AD Users and Computers.\n\n24\n00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.970\nA little roll there inside\nof your Window Server.\n\n25\n00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:24.950\nThat being said Mike,\n\n26\n00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.330\nI guess we gotta kind of understand\nwhat we can do with that directory.\n\n27\n00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.290\nGroups and user's is probably\na really good place to start.\n\n28\n00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.712\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n29\n00:01:32.712 --> 00:01:35.620\nAnd remember,\nthis exam is not expecting you\n\n30\n00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.910\nto be an Active Directory domain\nadministrator, anything like that.\n\n31\n00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.400\nWe need that foundation of knowledge.\n\n32\n00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.790\nWe need to understand the basics.\n\n33\n00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.416\nWe need to be able to get around there,\nunderstand the terminology, and\n\n34\n00:01:46.416 --> 00:01:47.114\nthings like that.\n\n35\n00:01:47.114 --> 00:01:48.380\nAnd so, let's take a look.\n\n36\n00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.021\nWhat we're gonna start off with,\nagain, accounts and groups for\n\n37\n00:01:51.021 --> 00:01:52.115\nthis particular episode.\n\n38\n00:01:52.115 --> 00:01:56.912\nAnd I wanna start out by talking about\nthe difference between domain accounts\n\n39\n00:01:56.912 --> 00:01:59.660\nversus local accounts, all right?\n\n40\n00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.082\nAnd I've got a little drawing\nI'm gonna show you here, and\n\n41\n00:02:02.082 --> 00:02:05.345\nthen we'll take a look at Active Directory\nand maybe even some local accounts.\n\n42\n00:02:05.345 --> 00:02:08.157\nAnd we'll see how we can go\nabout creating those guys,\n\n43\n00:02:08.157 --> 00:02:10.860\nbut when we talk about a domain account,\nall right?\n\n44\n00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.150\nWhat we mean is, that account\nis created in Active Directory.\n\n45\n00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.930\nNow Active Directory domain services,\nthat's a role that we install on a server.\n\n46\n00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.610\nAnd that makes it a domain controller.\n\n47\n00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.928\nAnd the name kind of infers that that\nmachine is in charge of something, right?\n\n48\n00:02:26.928 --> 00:02:32.646\nA domain controller, he is in charge of\ncontrolling security or the authentication\n\n49\n00:02:32.646 --> 00:02:37.660\nprocess and assigning tokens so\nthat we can get access to resources.\n\n50\n00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.020\nSo if we wanna make a domain account,\nwe go to our domain controller.\n\n51\n00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.530\nAnd we make a new user account.\n\n52\n00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.980\nLet's say we hire a new person to work for\nour company.\n\n53\n00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.620\nWell, they need an account so they can log\ninto their system and perform their job.\n\n54\n00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.040\nSo we go into Active Directory and\nwe make them a new user account.\n\n55\n00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.260\nThat account gets stored\nin Active Directory,\n\n56\n00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.210\nin the database behind Active Directory.\n\n57\n00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.360\nAnd once that account is created, they can\ngo to any machine that's part of my domain\n\n58\n00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.700\nand they can log on,\nassuming they have the right to log on.\n\n59\n00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.817\nLike certain servers they would have to\nbe given special rights to log on to, but\n\n60\n00:03:12.817 --> 00:03:16.640\nif we think about just the client\nmachines, like here I've got a domain.\n\n61\n00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.750\nThe domain is the triangle wrapped\naround here, and up at the top,\n\n62\n00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.840\nI've got what's supposed to be a server.\n\n63\n00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.360\nAnd that's my domain controller.\n\n64\n00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.100\nAnd then I've got my\nActive Directory database that\n\n65\n00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.910\nresides on the domain controller.\n\n66\n00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.920\nAnd I'll create a new user in that\ndatabase in Active Directory.\n\n67\n00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.970\nWell now that person can go over to\nthis machine and they could log on.\n\n68\n00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.260\nThey could go to this machine and log on\nor they could go over to this machine and\n\n69\n00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.390\nthey could log on.\n\n70\n00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.340\nThat one account gives them the ability\nto log in to any one of these machines.\n\n71\n00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.490\nCuz what's going to happen,\nwhen they sit down at this machine and\n\n72\n00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.080\nthey log on, it's gonna reach out and\ntalk to Active Directory.\n\n73\n00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.640\nAnd say, hey,\nsomebody just typed in Mike and\n\n74\n00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.140\nthis password, am I supposed to allow\nthem to log on, and it can say yes or no.\n\n75\n00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.731\nThe great thing about this,\nis I have one account, right?\n\n76\n00:04:05.731 --> 00:04:09.335\nI don't have to have a separate\naccount on each one of these machines.\n\n77\n00:04:09.335 --> 00:04:12.930\nI've one account stored in Active\nDirectory and that allows me access or\n\n78\n00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.130\nthe ability to log onto\nanyone of these machines.\n\n79\n00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.290\nI can use that account to control access\nto resources across the entire domain\n\n80\n00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.580\nwhether I wanna give read or\nwrite access to some folder,\n\n81\n00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.710\nI'll give them management\nrights over a server.\n\n82\n00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:31.713\nWhatever the case may be.\n\n83\n00:04:31.713 --> 00:04:33.460\nI've got that one account.\n\n84\n00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.930\nAnd that's one of the big\nadvantages of being in a domain,\n\n85\n00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.070\nis the fact that I can\nhave a single account.\n\n86\n00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.130\nIt's storage central.\n\n87\n00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.970\nThat's what you'll hear Microsoft say,\n\n88\n00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.030\nit's centralized management\nof these user accounts.\n\n89\n00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.430\nVersus where we talked about\na work group environment or\n\n90\n00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.800\nwe talk about local accounts.\n\n91\n00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.080\nLocal accounts are created\non the machine itself.\n\n92\n00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.320\nEvery Windows machine has what we call\na local SAM file or a SAM database.\n\n93\n00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.890\nSAM is an acronym for\nsecurity account manager.\n\n94\n00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.150\nAnd when you create a local account,\nthat's where it gets stored.\n\n95\n00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.460\nAnd that gives me access to that machine.\n\n96\n00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.563\nI could log onto it,\nassuming I have permissions.\n\n97\n00:05:11.563 --> 00:05:13.289\nI can do whatever it is I want to do.\n\n98\n00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:16.864\nBut if I go over to this machine,\nI'm not gonna be able to log on,\n\n99\n00:05:16.864 --> 00:05:21.510\nbecause in his SAM account file, there\nis no user account called Mike, okay?\n\n100\n00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:22.830\nIt's not there.\n\n101\n00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.120\nSo, with local accounts,\nthey're stored on the local machine, but\n\n102\n00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.410\nthey only give you access\nto that one machine.\n\n103\n00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:37.470\nIf I wanted to access this machine,\nI would need another account over there.\n\n104\n00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.130\nWhoa, and\nI just stretched myself really wide there,\n\n105\n00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.495\nwhich is what I feel like\nafter I have my Taco Bell.\n\n106\n00:05:43.495 --> 00:05:46.132\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now I would need an account on that\n\n107\n00:05:46.132 --> 00:05:48.535\nmachine so that I could log on to that.\n\n108\n00:05:48.535 --> 00:05:53.255\nIf I was logged on to this machine and\nwanted to access a resource over here.\n\n109\n00:05:53.255 --> 00:05:58.403\nWell, with local accounts, again, they\nwould have to create another account for\n\n110\n00:05:58.403 --> 00:06:03.430\nme, over here, and give that account\npermissions over that resource.\n\n111\n00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.500\nAt this machine down here,\n\n112\n00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.370\ndoes not trust accounts stored\nin another machines SAM file.\n\n113\n00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.980\nThere's no sharing of account\ninformation with these local accounts.\n\n114\n00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.460\nWhereas in a domain environment,\nI've got one account.\n\n115\n00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.395\nAnd if I add another machine, all right?\n\n116\n00:06:21.395 --> 00:06:23.850\nOr more machines, it doesn't matter.\n\n117\n00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:28.200\nI still have one account, and\nI can access any one of these machines\n\n118\n00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.920\nthat I've been given permission\nto access with that same account.\n\n119\n00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.225\nSo I don't have multiple\naccounts to manage.\n\n120\n00:06:34.225 --> 00:06:37.110\nAnd we talk about work group environments,\n\n121\n00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.400\nevery person needs an account on every\nmachine that they're gonna be accessing.\n\n122\n00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.680\nSo let's say I had an office with\nfive people and five computers.\n\n123\n00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.460\nBut they all need to be able to access\neach other's computer to share resources\n\n124\n00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:49.600\nand things like that.\n\n125\n00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.620\nThat means each person needs\nan account on each machine.\n\n126\n00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.270\nThat's five machines.\n\n127\n00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.467\nFive accounts on each machine.\n\n128\n00:06:56.467 --> 00:06:59.560\nIf I do my math right,\nDaniel, 5 times 5 is 25.\n\n129\n00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.580\nThat's 25 accounts I'm managing,\nfor an office of 5 people.\n\n130\n00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.350\nNot good.\n\n131\n00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:05.610\nAnd scale the numbers up, right?\n\n132\n00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.930\n10 computers, 10 people,\nnow you've got 100 accounts.\n\n133\n00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:14.080\nAnd even if I give this account, and this\naccount the exact same name, and the exact\n\n134\n00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.760\nsame password, they might look similar,\nbut they're still not the same account.\n\n135\n00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.760\nIf I change my password here, that does\nnot change the password over here, right?\n\n136\n00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.860\nSo now, me as a user, in this little\nenvironment, I've got three accounts and\n\n137\n00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.290\nthree passwords that I have to remember,\nright?\n\n138\n00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:30.687\nJust to get access to different machines.\n\n139\n00:07:30.687 --> 00:07:31.763\nNot very efficient.\n\n140\n00:07:31.763 --> 00:07:35.683\n>> Yeah, using the Active Directory\nis definitely a much more convenient\n\n141\n00:07:35.683 --> 00:07:36.630\nway to go.\n\n142\n00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:39.660\nNow, that being said,\nit can be cost prohibitive or\n\n143\n00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.042\njust out maybe out of\nthe scope of what you need.\n\n144\n00:07:42.042 --> 00:07:45.970\nMaybe you only have two or three\ncomputers for a business environment,\n\n145\n00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:48.290\nmaybe a small office, home office,\nkind of thing going on.\n\n146\n00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:50.807\nThat's fine, that work group\nwill work just fine with you.\n\n147\n00:07:50.807 --> 00:07:54.031\nYou're gonna have a little more\nadministration from time to time,\n\n148\n00:07:54.031 --> 00:07:56.588\ntrying to set users anytime,\nif you did add someone.\n\n149\n00:07:56.588 --> 00:07:59.563\nBut at that point, if you start\nseeing growth in the business,\n\n150\n00:07:59.563 --> 00:08:03.288\nyou know you're gonna add more new\ncomputers, you're gonna add more users.\n\n151\n00:08:03.288 --> 00:08:06.706\nNow all of a sudden looking at the Active\nDirectory becomes a little more feasible.\n\n152\n00:08:06.706 --> 00:08:11.329\nNow it's spending all my time creating\nuser accounts, and setting those users\n\n153\n00:08:11.329 --> 00:08:16.460\ninto certain groups, and granting access\non five, 10, 15 different computers.\n\n154\n00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.710\nWell now we're out of the realm\nof being feasible, and\n\n155\n00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:21.640\nactive directory Is the way to go.\n\n156\n00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:26.290\nUltimately unless you stay small forever,\nyou are going to want to move\n\n157\n00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:30.310\ninto that centralized management\nbecause of it's ease of use.\n\n158\n00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:34.210\nRemember as administrators we don't want\nto get bogged down doing a bunch of.\n\n159\n00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:35.670\nMenial tasks.\n\n160\n00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:39.040\nI should have one centralized location\nwhere I sit down and I do all the tasks I\n\n161\n00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.440\nneed to do when it comes to users and\ngroup accounts, and that's it.\n\n162\n00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:46.020\nI have all the access that I\nneed from one single point.\n\n163\n00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.130\nThat is the model we wanna follow.\n\n164\n00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:49.720\n>> Exactly.\nAll right, let's take a look at,\n\n165\n00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.620\nI'm gonna flip over here,\ndo my this is a web server.\n\n166\n00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.710\nIt's a domain computer, right?\n\n167\n00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:59.810\nBut what I want to do is I want to take\na look at my local users on this machine.\n\n168\n00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:03.000\nSo I'm going to go over here\nto administrative tools and\n\n169\n00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.680\nthen computer management, and\nthere's my local users and groups.\n\n170\n00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.930\nAnd so\nI could create an account right here.\n\n171\n00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:15.459\nI could say new user, and\nI call it Mike and I give it a password.\n\n172\n00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:21.225\nAnd out of habit I just do that.\n\n173\n00:09:21.225 --> 00:09:22.985\nIn lab environment please don't take that.\n\n174\n00:09:22.985 --> 00:09:24.865\nIt's not a recommended practice.\n\n175\n00:09:24.865 --> 00:09:26.055\nMy password never expires.\n\n176\n00:09:26.055 --> 00:09:27.895\nI don't want to have to change it.\n\n177\n00:09:27.895 --> 00:09:28.915\nI've created a new account.\n\n178\n00:09:28.915 --> 00:09:32.485\nSo now Mike is in the local SAM file.\n\n179\n00:09:32.485 --> 00:09:37.365\nSo I could log on locally to this\nmachine with that account, but\n\n180\n00:09:37.365 --> 00:09:41.095\nI would only be able to access\nresources on this one server.\n\n181\n00:09:41.095 --> 00:09:41.615\nRight?\n\n182\n00:09:41.615 --> 00:09:43.515\nI couldn't reach out on the network and\nget access.\n\n183\n00:09:43.515 --> 00:09:44.375\nNot with that account.\n\n184\n00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.710\nLet's flip over to my\ndomain controller and\n\n185\n00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:51.030\ntake a look at what we've\ngot going on over here.\n\n186\n00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:55.899\nAll right?\nIf I open up Computer Management, Don't\n\n187\n00:09:55.899 --> 00:09:57.657\neven know if it'll, there we go.\n\n188\n00:09:57.657 --> 00:09:59.745\nNotice I don't have Local users in groups.\n\n189\n00:09:59.745 --> 00:10:02.355\nA little thing I want to\nmake sure we're clear on,\n\n190\n00:10:02.355 --> 00:10:06.345\ndomain controllers are a special machine\non the network that when you install\n\n191\n00:10:06.345 --> 00:10:10.645\nthe Active Directory role you lose\naccess to the local SAN file.\n\n192\n00:10:10.645 --> 00:10:13.070\nThere are no local accounts\non domain controllers.\n\n193\n00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:15.350\nYou can only login with domain accounts.\n\n194\n00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:16.570\nAll right.\n\n195\n00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:19.350\nSo no local accounts on\nthe main controllers.\n\n196\n00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:24.070\nIf I want to make a domain account,\nthen we use Active Directory Users and\n\n197\n00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:24.770\nComputers.\n\n198\n00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:28.585\nSo here I am on my domain controller, I am\ngonna open up Active Directory Users and\n\n199\n00:10:28.585 --> 00:10:29.210\nComputers.\n\n200\n00:10:31.285 --> 00:10:32.610\nIt's gonna think about it.\n\n201\n00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:34.650\nAnd here I can make a new account.\n\n202\n00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:37.290\nSay I go over here and choose new user.\n\n203\n00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:39.793\nAnd I type in a user name.\n\n204\n00:10:43.276 --> 00:10:46.115\nAnd we'll give him a little log on name.\n\n205\n00:10:46.115 --> 00:10:47.330\nSet his password.\n\n206\n00:10:52.996 --> 00:10:55.824\nAnd now, I have a new user account for\nRonnie Wong.\n\n207\n00:10:55.824 --> 00:10:58.155\nNow, that account,\nbecause it's not a local account, right?\n\n208\n00:10:58.155 --> 00:11:00.615\nThat's stored in the active\ndirectory database.\n\n209\n00:11:00.615 --> 00:11:04.495\nHe could log onto any machine that\ntrusts this domain controller.\n\n210\n00:11:04.495 --> 00:11:05.290\nAny machine that's.\n\n211\n00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.440\nPart of this domain.\n\n212\n00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:07.950\nAll right?\n\n213\n00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.900\nI don't have to make an account on every\nsingle machine in the network for Ronnie.\n\n214\n00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.230\nYou can use this one account.\n\n215\n00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:14.260\nAll right?\n\n216\n00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.860\nSo that's a little look\nat just the [INAUDIBLE],\n\n217\n00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.770\nwe didn't dive deep into the user\naccounts and the properties.\n\n218\n00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:19.820\nNot yet, anyway.\n\n219\n00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.800\nJust want to make sure we're clear on\nthe difference between a local account\n\n220\n00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.990\ngives me access to the local machine,\nstored in the local SAN file, and\n\n221\n00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:29.390\na domain account stored\nin active directory,\n\n222\n00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:33.700\ncreated on my domain controllers,\ngives me access to the entire network.\n\n223\n00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.840\nCan give me access to the entire network.\n\n224\n00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.870\nOne account instead of one on\neach machine, and remember,\n\n225\n00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.880\ndomain controllers,\nno local accounts on there.\n\n226\n00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:43.490\nRight?\n\n227\n00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:47.360\nAll right, Daniel, so that's our accounts,\ndomain versus local accounts.\n\n228\n00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.950\nThe next thing I think we want to look\nat is good old user profile, right?\n\n229\n00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:56.190\nAnd a user profile is\na collection of folders and\n\n230\n00:11:56.190 --> 00:12:00.500\nsettings for your user account, is\nprobably a good way to think of it, right?\n\n231\n00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.630\nYou have certain folders that\nare part of your profile.\n\n232\n00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:07.030\nAnd you guys are familiar with this if\nyou've ever used a Windows PC, right?\n\n233\n00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:10.410\nWhen you log on you've got your documents\nfolder, your pictures, your videos,\n\n234\n00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:13.710\nyour music, your favorites,\nyour desktop, right?\n\n235\n00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:15.610\nThose are all part of your profile.\n\n236\n00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.880\nThere's also some hidden things that\nwe don't see that include a lot of our\n\n237\n00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.380\nsettings that are custom to us.\n\n238\n00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:25.170\nWhen I log on I want this background and\nI want this double-click mouse speed,\n\n239\n00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:27.870\nor maybe I've reversed my mouse buttons.\n\n240\n00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:31.700\nAnd things like that, those settings\nthat occur when you log on but\n\n241\n00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.160\nmight be different when\nsomebody else logs on.\n\n242\n00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.490\nThose are all part of my profile, right?\n\n243\n00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:40.410\nAnd when I log on and\nI make changes to settings or\n\n244\n00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:42.770\nI add new files to my folders or\nwhat have you.\n\n245\n00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:44.510\nThose get saved when I log off.\n\n246\n00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:46.480\nThat's saved as part of my profile so\n\n247\n00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.980\nthat when I log in the next time\nthose settings are still there.\n\n248\n00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:50.790\nAlright?\n\n249\n00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:53.710\nNow as far as where that\nprofile is concerned that's\n\n250\n00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:56.170\nreally what this exam is\ngoing to call out on.\n\n251\n00:12:56.170 --> 00:13:00.490\nWe need to be familiar with the types\nof profiles that we could do.\n\n252\n00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:04.210\nAnd the first one we're going to talk\nabout is simply a local profile.\n\n253\n00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:10.650\nAnd I'm going to flip back over to this\nweb server here and open up File Explorer,\n\n254\n00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:16.890\nand navigate over to the C drive,\nAnd go down here to users.\n\n255\n00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:20.890\nAlright, and underneath users\nI see a couple of, of folders.\n\n256\n00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:22.840\nThese are profiles.\n\n257\n00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.150\nAlright, Im logged on as what?\n\n258\n00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:25.770\nAdministrator for the lab.\n\n259\n00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:28.595\nSo if I open that up,\nnow let me expand this out so\n\n260\n00:13:28.595 --> 00:13:30.583\nyou can see the tree view as well.\n\n261\n00:13:32.494 --> 00:13:37.723\nAll right, these are my folders\nthat make up my profile.\n\n262\n00:13:37.723 --> 00:13:43.130\nThere's my downloads, my documents,\nand all of that good stuff.\n\n263\n00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:47.275\nSo, this is stored right here\non the C drive of this machine.\n\n264\n00:13:47.275 --> 00:13:51.940\n[SOUND] If I go to another machine,\nand I log onto that machine,\n\n265\n00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:56.539\nI'm gonna get a profile built for\nme on that machine as well.\n\n266\n00:13:56.539 --> 00:14:00.110\nAnd let me get, I've got a drawing here\nI think, I can show you a little better.\n\n267\n00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:00.705\nHere we go.\n\n268\n00:14:02.569 --> 00:14:05.737\nRight, so\nhere I've got two little computers, and\n\n269\n00:14:05.737 --> 00:14:09.050\nwhen I log on to this machine\nit builds my user profile.\n\n270\n00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:13.040\nNow there's a hidden default\nprofile that exists in Windows.\n\n271\n00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.800\nAnd anytime a person logs onto the machine\nfor the first time, it basically just\n\n272\n00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:21.730\nmakes a copy of that default profile,\nand renames it for your user account.\n\n273\n00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:23.690\nRight?\nSo now, that's your profile.\n\n274\n00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:27.740\nIt starts out as the default, and then\nyou can customize it any way you want.\n\n275\n00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:32.284\nSo there's your profile, if you go\nover to another machine and log on,\n\n276\n00:14:32.284 --> 00:14:37.540\nwell it's gonna make a new profile for\nyou, stored on this machines local drive.\n\n277\n00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:38.709\nAnd what that means is,\n\n278\n00:14:38.709 --> 00:14:42.222\nsettings are not gonna be the same\nbetween these two machines, right?\n\n279\n00:14:42.222 --> 00:14:45.828\nIf I change my background here\nI go log on to this machine,\n\n280\n00:14:45.828 --> 00:14:49.220\nI'm not gonna see that same background.\n\n281\n00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.630\nIf I put a file in my\ndocuments on this machine,\n\n282\n00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:56.940\nand then go log on to this machine,\nI'm not gonna see that same file right?\n\n283\n00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:00.840\nThey're two separate profiles,\nthat's what they mean by local profile,\n\n284\n00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.960\nit's local to that machine, all right?\n\n285\n00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.140\n>> You know Mike, that's true even\nin a domain environment, right?\n\n286\n00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:10.190\nThat if I log on to one machine even\nthough [INAUDIBLE] domain join.\n\n287\n00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:12.150\nI login using my domain credentials.\n\n288\n00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:15.290\nIt creates a profile, but\nit stays local to that machine.\n\n289\n00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:18.020\nIt doesn't cross pollinate to\nevery other machine I log into.\n\n290\n00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.560\n>> Exactly right, Daniel.\n\n291\n00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.960\nIt's gonna be specific\nto that one machine.\n\n292\n00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.000\nAnd as you can see that,\n\n293\n00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.680\nyou can probably think of a couple\nreasons that's problematic, right?\n\n294\n00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:32.200\nIf you have users that bounced\nbetween machines a lot,\n\n295\n00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:36.120\nthat's a problem for them, because\nthey've put stuff in their My Documents,\n\n296\n00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.530\nthey go to that other machine and\nthey don't have that stuff there.\n\n297\n00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:43.860\nA lot of environments, we don't move from\nmachine to machine very much, I've got my\n\n298\n00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:48.050\ndesk and my cubicle and my computer and\nthat's the only one I ever sit at.\n\n299\n00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:50.670\nAnd in that case the local\nprofile is perfectly fine.\n\n300\n00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:55.489\nAnd if I go to another machine, once\nin a while it's not that big of a deal.\n\n301\n00:15:55.489 --> 00:15:59.167\nBut if we're one of those shops where\nwe're Maybe you check out a laptop on\n\n302\n00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:01.599\nyour way in and\nthat's what you use for the day and\n\n303\n00:16:01.599 --> 00:16:04.700\nwhen you're done you turn it\nback in at the end of the day.\n\n304\n00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.188\nTomorrow you might get\na different lap top, right?\n\n305\n00:16:06.188 --> 00:16:08.390\nOr you do hot desking.\n\n306\n00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:10.030\nThese companies that\nwhere you bounce around.\n\n307\n00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:13.310\nYou never know where you're gonna be,\nthose kind of things.\n\n308\n00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:14.470\nThat's problematic.\n\n309\n00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:18.210\nCan't just put stuff in my documents and\nexpect it to be there tomorrow.\n\n310\n00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:19.920\nI've got to put everything\nup on a file share.\n\n311\n00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.440\nI got to put everything\non a removable media and\n\n312\n00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.165\nmake sure I bring that with me,\nand that's kind of clunky.\n\n313\n00:16:25.165 --> 00:16:29.690\nAnd that's where roaming profiles\ncan come into play, right?\n\n314\n00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:31.340\nRoaming profiles,\n\n315\n00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:35.380\nthe name kind of gives you a good idea\nof what's gonna happen here, right?\n\n316\n00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:38.590\nThat profile is gonna\nroam around with you.\n\n317\n00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:43.120\nAnd the way it's done is instead\nof storing the profile locally\n\n318\n00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.850\non that machine,\nwe put it up on the network somewhere.\n\n319\n00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:50.450\nTypically a file server,\nthat I've made a share folder, and\n\n320\n00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:53.210\ncreate a sub folder for\neach one of my users.\n\n321\n00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:56.410\nAnd then I go to your user\naccount properties and I tell it,\n\n322\n00:16:56.410 --> 00:17:01.000\nhey your profile is actually located\nup here on this file server.\n\n323\n00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.010\nAnd now, when you login to this machine,\n\n324\n00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:07.180\nit doesn't look at the local\nhard drive to find your profile.\n\n325\n00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.190\nIt says, wait this profile's up here\non the network, let me go check it out.\n\n326\n00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:14.870\nIt goes and it finds his profile and\nit copies it down to the machine and\n\n327\n00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:17.240\nthere's all your stuff just like normal.\n\n328\n00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.480\nBut when you make changes\nto your settings,\n\n329\n00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:23.760\nwhen you add files to your documents and\nthings like that when you log off,\n\n330\n00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:28.270\nit's going to sync that back up\nwith that network copy up here.\n\n331\n00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:31.930\nSo if you go to another machine later\non or the next day or whatever and\n\n332\n00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:36.710\nyou log in, it again pulls your\nprofile down to this machine from that\n\n333\n00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:39.490\nfile server and tada,\nyour settings are there,\n\n334\n00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:43.600\nthose files that you put into my\ndocuments yesterday are all right there.\n\n335\n00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.380\nAnd that's the idea\nbehind roaming profiles.\n\n336\n00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.340\nDid you say you use those\nat the farm bureau?\n\n337\n00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:53.550\n>> Yeah, from time to time the companies\nI have worked for use roaming profiles\n\n338\n00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:58.210\nbecause they can be advantageous for those\nmobile users that are never sitting still.\n\n339\n00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:00.580\nThat are always bouncing around\nfrom one computer to the other,\n\n340\n00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.810\nthey never have a permanent home.\n\n341\n00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:06.227\nSo every now and then, if you're in that\nkind of shop where you have users that do\n\n342\n00:18:06.227 --> 00:18:09.389\nthat, this roaming profile business\ncan really be a lifesaver for that.\n\n343\n00:18:09.389 --> 00:18:13.230\n>> Now, there are a couple downsides to\nroaming profiles and that's why I was kind\n\n344\n00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:16.338\nof wondering if you ever used them and\never ran into any of these.\n\n345\n00:18:16.338 --> 00:18:20.674\nOne issue that we have, you saw, if you\nlistened to what I was just saying it's\n\n346\n00:18:20.674 --> 00:18:23.800\ncopying your profile down\nto that local machine.\n\n347\n00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:24.710\nRight?\n\n348\n00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:26.640\nOkay.\nDoesn't sound too bad.\n\n349\n00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.550\nNow wait a second.\n\n350\n00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:29.280\nWhat's in your profile, right?\n\n351\n00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.140\nHow much do you have in your My Documents.\n\n352\n00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.860\nWhat's in your My Pictures and\nthings like that?\n\n353\n00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.340\nThat could be a lot of data.\n\n354\n00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:41.160\nIf you've got 500,\na thousand plus employees,\n\n355\n00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.630\nall logging on between 8,\n8:15 in the morning,\n\n356\n00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:48.820\nthe network is gonna get saturated with\ntraffic, copying all these profiles down,\n\n357\n00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:53.190\nand then again at the afternoon, when\neverybody's logging off at the same time.\n\n358\n00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:57.630\nAll this stuff is copying back up and\nlet's say I go to log off and\n\n359\n00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:00.930\n150 other people are logging\noff at the same time.\n\n360\n00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:02.680\nNow I get that spinning cheerio,\n\n361\n00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:07.210\nit's sitting there trying to write my data\nback up to the file server and it's busy.\n\n362\n00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:10.660\nThat file server is choking on all the,\nthis [INAUDIBLE] that's\n\n363\n00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:14.545\ncoming through it and\nit makes my log off process take longer.\n\n364\n00:19:14.545 --> 00:19:15.720\nRight?\nSame thing in the morning.\n\n365\n00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.490\nI go to log on and\nI might have to go get a cup of coffee and\n\n366\n00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:21.650\ncome back depending on how\nyour network is set up\n\n367\n00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:25.900\nbefore my profile actually loads and\nthat's not a good thing either.\n\n368\n00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:29.960\nSo it is something that you've gotta keep\nin mind when we deal with roaming profiles\n\n369\n00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.879\nthat you could have a performance hit.\n\n370\n00:19:31.879 --> 00:19:35.377\nThe organizations Daniel and I worked\nat a lot of time this was done for\n\n371\n00:19:35.377 --> 00:19:39.057\nthe sea level people because they were\nthe ones who signed the paycheck so\n\n372\n00:19:39.057 --> 00:19:42.582\nwe wanna make sure wherever they go,\nthey've got their documents.\n\n373\n00:19:42.582 --> 00:19:47.050\nAnd a few special individuals that\nneeded access, we would do it for them.\n\n374\n00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:50.580\nBut maybe not everybody, because most\npeople did sit at a single machine.\n\n375\n00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:55.890\n>> Yeah, those c level people he's talking\nabout, CEOs, CIOs, COOs, you name it,\n\n376\n00:19:55.890 --> 00:20:00.580\nthose kind of folks, they tend to have\na little weight behind them, their name.\n\n377\n00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:02.270\nSo when they want something\nthey tend to get it.\n\n378\n00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:05.622\nWe even had, our CEO had a Cisco ASA.\n\n379\n00:20:05.622 --> 00:20:07.300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> At his house, for\n\n380\n00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:11.814\na permanent VPN tunnel so that he never\nlost connectivity with the business.\n\n381\n00:20:11.814 --> 00:20:12.384\n>> Right.\n\n382\n00:20:12.384 --> 00:20:14.048\n>> That roaming profile he got that too.\n\n383\n00:20:14.048 --> 00:20:15.396\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Well, and\n\n384\n00:20:15.396 --> 00:20:16.810\nI do it again today, right?\n\n385\n00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:17.695\n>> Absolutely.\nYes, sir.\n\n386\n00:20:17.695 --> 00:20:18.531\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Just sign the checks.\n\n387\n00:20:18.531 --> 00:20:20.100\n[LAUGH] Whatever you need, sir.\n\n388\n00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:21.633\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n389\n00:20:21.633 --> 00:20:22.580\nLet's see.\n\n390\n00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:26.480\nNext on our list of stuff to talk\nabout here is gonna be group types and\n\n391\n00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.000\ngroup scopes.\n\n392\n00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.760\nAnd we're gonna primarily deal\nwith Active Directory groups.\n\n393\n00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.830\nThere are local groups that\nyou can create on a machine.\n\n394\n00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:39.070\nBut just like a local user, local groups\nare stored in a local SAM file and\n\n395\n00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:44.100\nthey could only use them to give access to\nresources on that local machine, right?\n\n396\n00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.230\nTypically we're talking about\na domain environment and\n\n397\n00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:48.070\nthat's where we're gonna go with this and\n\n398\n00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:53.270\nI'm gonna flip back over to my domain\ncontroller and take a look at some groups.\n\n399\n00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:55.320\nSo first of all, what the heck is a group?\n\n400\n00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:59.480\nA group is simply a membership list,\nthat's all it is.\n\n401\n00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:03.630\nIt's a way that I can simplify\nassigning permissions and\n\n402\n00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:06.120\ndelegating administrative control, right?\n\n403\n00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:09.190\nBecause if I have a hundred salespeople,\nand\n\n404\n00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:14.000\nI've got a resource that I need to\ngive them all read access to, right?\n\n405\n00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.730\nI could add each person,\none at a time and give them read access.\n\n406\n00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:20.520\nOne, that's gonna take me forever.\n\n407\n00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.950\nTwo, my access control\nlist is gonna be huge.\n\n408\n00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:26.140\nIf I want to find a particular user and\ntake away their permissions or\n\n409\n00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:29.220\nchange their permissions, I gotta scroll,\nscroll, scroll, scroll, and\n\n410\n00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.440\ntry to find them in there.\n\n411\n00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:33.942\n>> Then you've gotta write up your\nresume and your letter of resignation.\n\n412\n00:21:33.942 --> 00:21:34.558\nYou're not doing that.\n\n413\n00:21:34.558 --> 00:21:36.137\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I hope not, anyway.\n\n414\n00:21:36.137 --> 00:21:38.040\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Right?\n\n415\n00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.350\nSo, we use groups.\n\n416\n00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:41.690\nGroups allow me to take\nthose 100 salespeople.\n\n417\n00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:43.870\nI create a group, so they called sales.\n\n418\n00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:44.420\nRight?\nAnd\n\n419\n00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:48.100\nI put all those sales people\nin that group called sales.\n\n420\n00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.550\nNow I can treat that group\nas a salesperson, right?\n\n421\n00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:54.410\nI can assign permissions to that group and\n\n422\n00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:57.350\neverybody in the group\ngets those permissions.\n\n423\n00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:01.430\nAnd what's really cool about it is if hire\nten new people tomorrow that are all part\n\n424\n00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:04.700\nof the sales team, I just have to\ndump them in that group, right?\n\n425\n00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:08.770\nThat group might be used to give\nthe sales people permissions\n\n426\n00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:10.750\nover hundreds of resources, right?\n\n427\n00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:14.492\nAnd when I hire ten new people,\nI'm like, my gosh.\n\n428\n00:22:14.492 --> 00:22:17.700\nNow I have to go through all\nthose different resources and\n\n429\n00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.890\nadd these ten people to those resources.\n\n430\n00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:22.920\nI've got a list a mile long\nof resources I've gotta do.\n\n431\n00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:27.280\nNow the sales group has already been\npermission to all those resources.\n\n432\n00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:31.410\nAll you gotta do is take that list of\nnew hires, dump them in that group and\n\n433\n00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:32.098\nI'm done.\n\n434\n00:22:32.098 --> 00:22:32.819\nThat was it.\nAll right.\n\n435\n00:22:32.819 --> 00:22:35.570\nSo groups simplify administration.\n\n436\n00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:40.855\nThey give me the ability to\nbasically collect up users that have\n\n437\n00:22:40.855 --> 00:22:47.220\nthe same job scope, and treat them\nas a unit instead of an individual.\n\n438\n00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:49.269\n>> Now Mike, there's a couple of group\ntypes that we probably need to be familiar\n\n439\n00:22:49.269 --> 00:22:50.115\nwith as well, there are right?\n\n440\n00:22:50.115 --> 00:22:51.250\n>> There are.\n\n441\n00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:52.525\nWhen you to create a group,\n\n442\n00:22:52.525 --> 00:22:55.652\nyou gotta decide first of all what\ntype of group you want to create.\n\n443\n00:22:55.652 --> 00:22:58.300\nAnd then I'll show you,\nI'll watch this little wizard here.\n\n444\n00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.540\nSo in active directory I can right click,\nor I can click on my little\n\n445\n00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:05.060\nbutton up there at the top, and\nI'll give the group a name.\n\n446\n00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:06.980\nI'll call it development or something.\n\n447\n00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.750\nIf I can spell development.\n\n448\n00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:11.890\nAll right, and\nthen I've really got two decisions and\n\n449\n00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:14.600\nwhat Daniel's talking about\nhere is the group type.\n\n450\n00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:18.210\nNow there's security and\nthere's distribution.\n\n451\n00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:21.900\nA security group is a group\nthat I can use that I can use\n\n452\n00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.302\nto control access to resources.\n\n453\n00:23:24.302 --> 00:23:29.100\nNow the key here is that a security\ngroup is given a security identifier.\n\n454\n00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:34.520\nWhen you create this object, a unique\nnumber is assigned to this object.\n\n455\n00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:38.080\nAnd now I can use that group\nto assign permissions.\n\n456\n00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.820\nLike to say you have read\npermission over this folder,\n\n457\n00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.240\nyou have write permission in this folder,\nright?\n\n458\n00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:46.180\nSo security groups are used for\nsigning permissions.\n\n459\n00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:51.039\nBecause they have an SID, or a Security\nIdentifier associated with them.\n\n460\n00:23:51.039 --> 00:23:54.244\nDistribution groups,\non the other hand, do not have an SID.\n\n461\n00:23:54.244 --> 00:23:56.311\nWhen I create a distribution group,\n\n462\n00:23:56.311 --> 00:23:59.588\nit doesn't generate a unique\nidentifying number for it.\n\n463\n00:23:59.588 --> 00:24:03.973\nDistribution groups can only\nbe used in email applications.\n\n464\n00:24:03.973 --> 00:24:08.325\nIf I want to send an email out, instead\nof trying to list 100 different people,\n\n465\n00:24:08.325 --> 00:24:11.530\nI can grab this group that\ncontains the 100 people.\n\n466\n00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:15.150\nLike here we have a distribution\ngroup called hosts, right?\n\n467\n00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:18.020\nSo instead of me having to think about,\nokay, who do we have?\n\n468\n00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:20.100\nMake sure I include them in the email.\n\n469\n00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.120\nI can just send the email to hosts and\n\n470\n00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.310\nit'll go to everyone that's\na member of the group.\n\n471\n00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:26.470\nAnd same thing if I add new people to it.\n\n472\n00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:30.580\nThey'll get that email the next time\nsomebody uses that distribution group.\n\n473\n00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:34.590\nBut I cannot add a distribution\ngroup to an access control list.\n\n474\n00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:38.350\nI can't use it to assign permissions\nbecause it doesn't have an SID.\n\n475\n00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:41.770\nSecurity groups can actually also\nbe used for email distribution.\n\n476\n00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:47.870\nYou can assign an email\naddress to the security group.\n\n477\n00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:49.760\nAnd then I can actually send\nan email to the the group, and\n\n478\n00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.370\neverybody in the group\nwould get the email.\n\n479\n00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:53.930\nSo security groups can do both.\n\n480\n00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:58.730\nI can use them for email distribution\nas well as permission assignment.\n\n481\n00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:02.458\nDistribution groups, only email, right?\n\n482\n00:25:02.458 --> 00:25:05.170\nOnly distribution lists for\nthose distribution groups.\n\n483\n00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:08.050\n>> Now Mike, you also got a couple\nof scopes there, as well.\n\n484\n00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:09.110\nWhat the heck is that all about?\n\n485\n00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:13.160\n>> That's where it starts getting a little\nbit twisty, with the group scopes.\n\n486\n00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:16.600\nAgain, luckily,\nthis our high-level overview.\n\n487\n00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:21.160\nSo group scopes, I've got domain local,\nglobal, and universal.\n\n488\n00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:25.270\nAnd it's all about who can\nbe a member of the group and\n\n489\n00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:28.520\nwhere I can use the group, all right?\n\n490\n00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.870\nNow Microsoft has a great chart, and\nI should've gone and grabbed that chart.\n\n491\n00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:34.610\nMaybe I'll make sure I try to throw\nthat in the show notes for us.\n\n492\n00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:41.200\nBut domain local groups,\nall three of these are domain based.\n\n493\n00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.660\nSo they're gonna be stored\nin Active Directory.\n\n494\n00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:46.346\nAnd when we look at a domain local group,\n\n495\n00:25:46.346 --> 00:25:49.902\nMicrosoft has a best practice\nthat we should follow.\n\n496\n00:25:49.902 --> 00:25:51.402\nAnd let's jump down to that and\n\n497\n00:25:51.402 --> 00:25:55.150\nthen I think this will make a little\nmore sense as we go through here.\n\n498\n00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:59.070\nMicrosoft talks about something\ncalled AGDLP, all right?\n\n499\n00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:00.970\nAnd I'm gonna grab my drawing here.\n\n500\n00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.950\nWhat they say we should do,\nis take our accounts,\n\n501\n00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:09.550\nthat's the A in the acronym, and\ngather them up in global groups.\n\n502\n00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:11.510\nThat's the G right?\n\n503\n00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:17.170\nAnd we create global groups,\ntypically based off of job rules or\n\n504\n00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:20.530\npeople that needs similar access,\nlike I'm gonna make a group for hosts,\n\n505\n00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:22.331\nbecause all of my hosts\nneed the same permissions.\n\n506\n00:26:22.331 --> 00:26:26.018\nI'm gonna make a group for developers\ncuz they need the same permissions.\n\n507\n00:26:26.018 --> 00:26:27.140\nI'm gonna make a group for\n\n508\n00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:30.080\nexecutives because they need\nthe same permissions, right?\n\n509\n00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.590\nAnd so I take all my hosts and\nput them in the host group.\n\n510\n00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:36.370\nI take all my developers and\nput them in the developer group etc, etc.\n\n511\n00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:40.240\nSo these global groups\nare used to gather up people\n\n512\n00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:43.910\nthat have the same job requirements or\nneed the same sets of permissions.\n\n513\n00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:49.160\nDomain local groups we use\nto assign the permissions.\n\n514\n00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.830\nThat's the DL, A-G-D-L-P, right?\n\n515\n00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:58.190\nDomain local groups are given\naccess to the resource, or\n\n516\n00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:59.560\nthey're assigned permissions.\n\n517\n00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:06.490\nLike this group might be,\nI don't know, Corp Data Read, right?\n\n518\n00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:09.640\nAnd so, I'm gonna assign this group\npermissions over this resource,\n\n519\n00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.905\nI'll give it read access.\n\n520\n00:27:11.905 --> 00:27:16.070\nDomain local groups are named based\non the resource that we're going to\n\n521\n00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:19.920\nuse to give permissions over and\nthe permission that's given, typically.\n\n522\n00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.810\nLike I said, Sales Folders, read.\n\n523\n00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:26.570\nOr Quarterly Reports, full control, right?\n\n524\n00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:32.230\nThen we take our global group, like Sales,\nand put them the Domain Local group.\n\n525\n00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:35.295\nWe nest, this is called group nesting,\nall right?\n\n526\n00:27:35.295 --> 00:27:39.510\nWe take one group and\nput it inside another group.\n\n527\n00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:43.290\nAnd now, the sales people\nare all in the Global group.\n\n528\n00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:45.860\nThe Global group is a member\nof the Domain Local group.\n\n529\n00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:48.580\nThe Domain Local group is given\nPermission over the Resource.\n\n530\n00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:51.950\nTherefore, these users get\naccess to this resource.\n\n531\n00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:57.580\nAnd that's the A, G, DL, P.\n\n532\n00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:02.010\nThat's Microsoft's recommendation or\nbest practice for managing groups.\n\n533\n00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:03.710\nAnd it might seem like it's crazy.\n\n534\n00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:08.280\nIt's like why not just take these accounts\nand put them in this Global group and\n\n535\n00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.720\ngive the Global group\npermissions over the Resource?\n\n536\n00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:11.260\nAnd you could.\n\n537\n00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:12.740\nYou most definitely could.\n\n538\n00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:14.470\nBut its the flexibility and\n\n539\n00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:17.190\nthe scalability that I'm\ngonna get with this solution.\n\n540\n00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:24.515\nLets say I come up with a couple other\ngroups that need access to that Resource.\n\n541\n00:28:24.515 --> 00:28:27.935\nMy boss comes to me tomorrow,\nand, let's say this was Sales.\n\n542\n00:28:27.935 --> 00:28:28.732\nWe'll change this up.\n\n543\n00:28:28.732 --> 00:28:30.458\nWe'll call this, sales.\n\n544\n00:28:30.458 --> 00:28:37.770\nWe're gonna call this, Reports_RW.\n\n545\n00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:39.866\nWe're gonna call this the Reports folder.\n\n546\n00:28:43.859 --> 00:28:49.759\nAll right, and we'll call this one,\nwe'll call Marketing.\n\n547\n00:28:49.759 --> 00:28:54.589\nAnd we'll call this one Execs or\nsomething.\n\n548\n00:28:54.589 --> 00:29:00.488\nAll right, I followed the strategy,\nand I got all my Sales people.\n\n549\n00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:08.422\nAnd we'll say Sales Users.\n\n550\n00:29:08.422 --> 00:29:11.500\nAll right, and\nwe'll put them in that group called Sales.\n\n551\n00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:17.270\nWe'll put that Sales group inside a group,\ndomain local group called, Reports_RW.\n\n552\n00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:21.880\nAnd I assign read write permission over\nthe Reports folder to this Reports group.\n\n553\n00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.210\nNow tomorrow my boss comes to me and\n\n554\n00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:28.380\nsays hey, Marketing also needs read write\npermission over that Reports folder.\n\n555\n00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:31.278\nWell, all I have to do at that point,\n\n556\n00:29:31.278 --> 00:29:36.340\nis dump them into that domain\nlocal group and I'm done, right?\n\n557\n00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:37.070\nThat was it.\n\n558\n00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:40.585\nI didn't have to go and modify the access\ncontrol list on the resource or\n\n559\n00:29:40.585 --> 00:29:41.646\nanything like that.\n\n560\n00:29:41.646 --> 00:29:45.190\nThen the next day he says you know\nwhat the Execs also need read write\n\n561\n00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:46.090\naccess to that.\n\n562\n00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:50.014\nWell again, I'm just going to go ahead and\n\n563\n00:29:50.014 --> 00:29:53.728\ndump them in to that group and I'm done.\n\n564\n00:29:53.728 --> 00:29:56.706\nAnd then they come to me the next week and\nthey say, you know what,\n\n565\n00:29:56.706 --> 00:29:59.710\nMarketing doesn't need access\nto that folder anymore.\n\n566\n00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:01.470\nI don't have to modify\nthe access control list.\n\n567\n00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:03.500\nI just go in to Active Directory and\n\n568\n00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:06.400\nI take them out of the group,\nand I'm done, right?\n\n569\n00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.372\nSo, in a small organization,\nsometimes it's hard\n\n570\n00:30:09.372 --> 00:30:13.558\nto see the benefit of following this\nstrategy, but as your system grows,\n\n571\n00:30:13.558 --> 00:30:18.375\nas your corporation grows, you'll be very\nglad you followed this basic strategy.\n\n572\n00:30:18.375 --> 00:30:22.596\nAGDLP, accounts into global group,\nglobal groups into domain local groups,\n\n573\n00:30:22.596 --> 00:30:25.890\npermissions get assigned\nat the domain local groups.\n\n574\n00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:29.970\nNow, as you're studying for this,\nif you start reading anything beyond 2008,\n\n575\n00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:35.220\nyou're gonna see that Microsoft\nchanged it up a little bit.\n\n576\n00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:41.580\nThere gonna call it IGDLA, just to\nconfuse us, because why keep it the same?\n\n577\n00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:42.840\nLet's change it.\n\n578\n00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.460\nIt's the exact same strategy, all right?\n\n579\n00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:51.550\nExcept accounts are now called identities\nand permission is now called access.\n\n580\n00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:55.770\nSo identities go in to global groups\nglobal groups in domain local groups,\n\n581\n00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:58.610\ndomain local groups are given\naccess to the resource.\n\n582\n00:30:58.610 --> 00:31:01.425\nIGDLA, it's the same thing as AGDLP,\n\n583\n00:31:01.425 --> 00:31:06.218\njust a little different twist on\nthe actual terms there at the end.\n\n584\n00:31:06.218 --> 00:31:09.670\n>> For this exam, AGDLP will get you by.\n\n585\n00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:10.990\nThat's what you want to learn.\n\n586\n00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:13.700\nSo stick with that, and\nthen once you move beyond this, and\n\n587\n00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:17.390\nyou maybe move into higher certifications,\nthen you can start worrying about\n\n588\n00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:20.620\nhow they've changed a little bit\ndifferently for newer exams.\n\n589\n00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:24.580\nAll right Mike, well we've covered a lot\nof users and groups with Active Directory.\n\n590\n00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:27.230\nIs there anything else we need to\nadd to this or are we good to go?\n\n591\n00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:28.443\n>> I think that's it.\n\n592\n00:31:28.443 --> 00:31:31.616\nIf I'm gonna give you any parting words,\ngo in there and\n\n593\n00:31:31.616 --> 00:31:34.800\nplay if you've got a virtual\nenvironment to play with.\n\n594\n00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.290\nTry signing permissions.\n\n595\n00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:38.310\nTry creating some of those groups.\n\n596\n00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:39.360\nLook at your different options.\n\n597\n00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.650\nPut some accounts in there.\n\n598\n00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:41.330\nCreate some folders.\n\n599\n00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:42.430\nAssign supervisions.\n\n600\n00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:46.000\nPlay around with it and\nget used to to the way those work.\n\n601\n00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.150\nTry roaming profiles too.\n\n602\n00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:47.810\n>> That's right.\n\n603\n00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:49.250\nI second that motion.\n\n604\n00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:51.782\nMost of them pass, all in favor say, aye.\n\n605\n00:31:51.782 --> 00:31:54.490\nAll right Michael, looks like we've come\nto the right of yet another great episode.\n\n606\n00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:58.381\nHopefully you guys have enjoyed it, we're\ngonna go ahead and sign off for ITProTV.\n\n607\n00:31:58.381 --> 00:32:00.020\nI've been your host

great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.476\nI'm your host Daniel Lowery,\nhere with me today is Mr. Mike Roderick.\n\n5\n00:00:20.476 --> 00:00:21.550\nHow's it going today Michael?\n\n6\n00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:22.730\n>> It's going great Daniel.\n\n7\n00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.500\nI'm excited because we've\ngot more of our MTA,\n\n8\n00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.710\nWindows Server administration\nfundamentals coming your way and\n\n9\n00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.310\nin this one we're gonna be\nlooking at OU's and containers.\n\n10\n00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.980\nOUs being organizational units.\n\n11\n00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.960\nSorry, I hate using acronyms\nbefore I define them, but\n\n12\n00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.325\nthat's the title of the objective.\n\n13\n00:00:41.325 --> 00:00:42.844\nO-Using containers [LAUGH].\n\n14\n00:00:42.844 --> 00:00:46.610\n>> Yeah, we tend to get a little used\nto using the Microsoft terminology.\n\n15\n00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.590\nOnce you've been acclimated\nto Microsoft's way, as it is,\n\n16\n00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.540\nyou'll be spitting out terminology left\nand right, acronyms left and right.\n\n17\n00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.160\nMichael is right.\n\n18\n00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.280\nRight now we need to give you the meat and\npotatoes of it.\n\n19\n00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.580\nOU is organizational unit.\n\n20\n00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.670\nAnd it's a hinky little thing inside\nof the Active Directory, eh, Mike?\n\n21\n00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.975\n>> Yeah!\n>> It's weird and ambiguous and yet,\n\n22\n00:01:05.975 --> 00:01:07.889\ndefined all at the same time [LAUGH].\n\n23\n00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:08.830\n>> It's so wonderful.\n\n24\n00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.180\nYou will learn to love OUs, and honestly\nif you're new to Active Directory and\n\n25\n00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.059\nyou're trying to figure these things out,\n\n26\n00:01:14.059 --> 00:01:16.550\nwell, one,\nwhat I'm gonna explain them to you.\n\n27\n00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.510\nAnd two, you're gonna find that there's a\nlot of similarities to folders, all right?\n\n28\n00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.800\nBetween an OU and so\nif you take that concept of folders, cuz\n\n29\n00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.030\nmost of you are used to creating folders\nthen subfolders most likely, right?\n\n30\n00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.520\nLike you've got your My Pictures\nfolder on your computer.\n\n31\n00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.740\nYou don't dump all of your pictures\ninto that folder most likely.\n\n32\n00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.271\nYou make subfolders within there,\nChristmas, 2015, New Year's 2016.\n\n33\n00:01:42.271 --> 00:01:44.923\nYou make different subfolders,\nand that makes it easier for\n\n34\n00:01:44.923 --> 00:01:47.940\nyou to find a picture when\nyou're looking for it, right?\n\n35\n00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.690\nWell, the same thing in Active Directory\nwhen we look at organizational units,\n\n36\n00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.800\nthe name kind of implies,\nwe're organizing things using these units.\n\n37\n00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.465\nAnd they are in that respect,\nsome very similar folders.\n\n38\n00:02:00.465 --> 00:02:03.560\nNow they go well beyond\nwhat we use folders for,\n\n39\n00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.380\nlot of cool things we can do with OU's.\n\n40\n00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.363\nSo let's dive in, I'm gonna go\njump over here to my computer.\n\n41\n00:02:08.363 --> 00:02:12.069\nWe're going to open up Active Directory\nand we're gonna take a look\n\n42\n00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.330\nat what these OUs look like and\ntalk a little bit about them.\n\n43\n00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.770\nSo I am going to jump over\nto the domain controller\n\n44\n00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.980\nbecause that's where I would\nfind Active Directory.\n\n45\n00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.270\n[LAUGH] And I'm going to launch\nActive Directory, users and computers.\n\n46\n00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.750\nFunny how its not on my web server Daniel?\n\n47\n00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.940\n>> It's amazing how that works\nout isn't it, Micheal [LAUGH]?\n\n48\n00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.366\n>> [LAUGH] It is.\nAll right, so here we are,\n\n49\n00:02:32.366 --> 00:02:35.770\nall the domain controller, I've launched\nActive Directory users and computers.\n\n50\n00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.680\nI'm gonna kind of\ncollapse this up just for\n\n51\n00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.130\na second so\nwe can start from the very beginning.\n\n52\n00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.480\nNow when you open up Active Directory,\nyou've got your domain.\n\n53\n00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.370\nIn this case, my domain is named lab.net.\n\n54\n00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.540\nAnd underneath here,\nI've got what looks like folders.\n\n55\n00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.750\nAnd there's a couple of different ones.\n\n56\n00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.270\nI know it's probably really hard for\nyou to see on my screen here.\n\n57\n00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.980\nSo, make sure you fire up\na domain controller, or\n\n58\n00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.920\ngo look at our practice labs, or\nwhatever, to get a little closer look.\n\n59\n00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.870\nBut the folders here, the little icons,\nsome of them look like plain\n\n60\n00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.620\nyellow folders, the other ones have\na little, what's supposed to be a book, or\n\n61\n00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.350\nI've always thought it kind of\nlooked like a little scroll.\n\n62\n00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.000\nIt's really hard to see, and\nI've never bothered trying to\n\n63\n00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.390\nbreak out a magnifying glass and\ntake a close look at it.\n\n64\n00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.370\nBut, that is a key distinction here when\n\n65\n00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.370\nwe're looking in Active Directory,\nall right?\n\n66\n00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.760\nThe ones with the little book or\nscroll icon on them,\n\n67\n00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.370\nthose our organizational units,\nor OUs for short.\n\n68\n00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.190\nThe other ones, the little plain yellow\nones there, those are known as containers.\n\n69\n00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.760\nNow here's where it gets a little twisty,\nso pay attention.\n\n70\n00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.810\nOU's are a type of container, right?\n\n71\n00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.990\nSo, really they're both containers,\nbut the yellow ones,\n\n72\n00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.090\nthe ones with out the little icon,\nthose are known as built in containers.\n\n73\n00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.087\nThe OU's are a special class of\ncontainers that I can create and\n\n74\n00:04:01.087 --> 00:04:05.848\nthey have more functionality than\nthose built in containers, all right?\n\n75\n00:04:05.848 --> 00:04:07.610\nAnd that's the last that\nI'll confuse you with that.\n\n76\n00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.060\nWe're gonna stick with containers and OUs.\n\n77\n00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.520\nBut just for the exam and for\n\n78\n00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.430\nyour information,\nknow that an OU is also a container.\n\n79\n00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.100\nIt's just a special class of container,\nall right?\n\n80\n00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.540\nAnd when I say it's a container,\nthat's because it contains objects, right?\n\n81\n00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.360\nJust like folders that you create in your\nfile explorer on your desktop, right?\n\n82\n00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.730\nThose can contain objects,\n\n83\n00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.900\nyou can put things inside them, files,\nother folders, pictures, things like that.\n\n84\n00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.360\nThese are containers as well and\n\n85\n00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.980\nwhen I go into these guys,\nI'll find things inside them.\n\n86\n00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.260\nJust like I would if I was navigating\nthrough my file system on my computer.\n\n87\n00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.280\nSo for example, here's the built\nin container called BuiltIn.\n\n88\n00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.040\nThere's some more confusion for you.\n\n89\n00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.532\nIt's a built in container called BuiltIn,\nyeah well.\n\n90\n00:04:54.532 --> 00:04:55.660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's Microsoft.\n\n91\n00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.148\nThere's a Computers container.\n\n92\n00:04:57.148 --> 00:04:58.960\nNow some of these you don't normally see.\n\n93\n00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.080\nLet me change this back\nto the default view.\n\n94\n00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.450\nI'm gonna turn off my advanced features.\n\n95\n00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.508\nThis is what you'd normally\nsee when you come in here.\n\n96\n00:05:05.508 --> 00:05:09.900\nYou'll see that my list got shorter,\nright?\n\n97\n00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.680\nSome of those containers,\nI don't see by default.\n\n98\n00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.400\nIf I want to see them, I've gotta\nturn on that Advanced view, right?\n\n99\n00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.570\nAlso, when you're looking at these guys,\nif I right-click on one and\n\n100\n00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.310\npull up Properties,\nI don't see the security tab, right?\n\n101\n00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.583\nI don't see that until I\nturn on my advanced view.\n\n102\n00:05:28.583 --> 00:05:29.780\nI go to my View menu.\n\n103\n00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.100\nTurn on Advanced features and\nnow you see my list here gets longer.\n\n104\n00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.850\nAnd as well when I right-click\non one of these guys and\n\n105\n00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.840\nchoose Properties I now\nget a few extra tabs.\n\n106\n00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.510\nOne of them being that Security tab.\n\n107\n00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.270\nThough not specifically called\nout in the objectives but\n\n108\n00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.130\nsomething I wanted to let you guys know.\n\n109\n00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.730\nYou're not seeing everything when\nyou go into Active Directory\n\n110\n00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.440\nuntil you turn on that\nAdvanced features view.\n\n111\n00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.030\nAll right, so let's go back through here,\nand I'm gonna make it a little bit easier\n\n112\n00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.630\nto look at just by turning off\nthat Advanced features for now.\n\n113\n00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.700\nSo BuiltIn, these yellow one's again,\nBuiltIn containers.\n\n114\n00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.140\nThere's one called BuiltIn.\n\n115\n00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.470\nAnd this has a bunch of\ngroups in it already.\n\n116\n00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.230\nThis was all created when I\ninstalled Active Directory.\n\n117\n00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:13.710\nI didn't make any of this,\nas far as the containers go and\n\n118\n00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.380\nwhat's contained in them.\n\n119\n00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.250\nHence the name BuiltIn containers, right?\n\n120\n00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.290\nThat came with Active Directory,\nthe computers container.\n\n121\n00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.990\nThis is actually left over\nfrom the NT days, all right?\n\n122\n00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.012\nAnd this is the default location for\na new computer account.\n\n123\n00:06:30.012 --> 00:06:33.825\nIn other words, when I get that\nnew Windows 7 box in, and I go and\n\n124\n00:06:33.825 --> 00:06:37.075\nI join it to the domain,\nI'm gonna find the account for\n\n125\n00:06:37.075 --> 00:06:40.483\nthat computer here in\nthe computers container, right?\n\n126\n00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:42.210\nThat's what it's for.\n\n127\n00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.430\nThere's a Foreign Security Principals\ncontainer, a Manage Security Accounts or\n\n128\n00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.220\nService Accounts container,\nand a Users container.\n\n129\n00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.960\nAnd the Users container contains\nadditional groups as well as a couple key\n\n130\n00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.952\naccounts, Administrator and Guest, okay?\n\n131\n00:06:56.952 --> 00:06:58.552\nNow all that stuff that\nI just talked about,\n\n132\n00:06:58.552 --> 00:07:01.440\nthat all comes with an Active Directory,\nI didn't create any of that.\n\n133\n00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.918\nThat's what we call our default creators.\n\n134\n00:07:03.918 --> 00:07:07.900\nAgain, that BuiltIn there,\n\n135\n00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:13.300\nthis is for service administrator\naccounts, so you'll see things like IIS,\n\n136\n00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:18.570\nI users, performance log users\nprint operators, server operators.\n\n137\n00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.380\nWhat we call our service\nadministrator account.\n\n138\n00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.670\nAnd that's where they're\nlocated by default.\n\n139\n00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:24.780\nNow I can move them.\n\n140\n00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.260\nMicrosoft says we probably should just\nleave them in there, and that's fine.\n\n141\n00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.643\nThat said, the Computer's container\nis the default location for\n\n142\n00:07:33.643 --> 00:07:36.624\nnew computer objects and Active Directory.\n\n143\n00:07:36.624 --> 00:07:40.624\nForeign Security Principles, honestly\nI'll tell you that I've never really used\n\n144\n00:07:40.624 --> 00:07:43.399\nthis container in the 12 years\nthat I've been doing it.\n\n145\n00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:46.020\nManage Service Accounts,\n\n146\n00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:51.180\nwe've talked about in other episodes how\nwe can create a manage service account.\n\n147\n00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.707\nThat's where they would show up.\n\n148\n00:07:52.707 --> 00:07:55.140\nAnd then this default Users container.\n\n149\n00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.582\nThis is where new user\naccounts are gonna go.\n\n150\n00:07:57.582 --> 00:08:01.089\nJust like new computers go\nin the Computers container,\n\n151\n00:08:01.089 --> 00:08:03.740\nnew users go in the Users container.\n\n152\n00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.744\nAgain, by default, right?\n\n153\n00:08:05.744 --> 00:08:10.580\nWhat I'm trying to get you to get\nthere is that I can change that.\n\n154\n00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.750\nI don't have to stick with the default.\n\n155\n00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.530\nRight, but those containers,\n\n156\n00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:18.780\nas I said a minute ago, when I install\nactive directory, it creates those,\n\n157\n00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:24.180\nit populates them with\nall of those options.\n\n158\n00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.580\nThere's only one OU that we\nget by default out of the box\n\n159\n00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.430\nwhen we first install Active Directory.\n\n160\n00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.179\nAnd that is the Domain Controllers OU.\n\n161\n00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:35.660\nIt is an organizational unit, you can\nsee the icon is slightly different.\n\n162\n00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:39.668\nAnd this is the default location for\nthe computer accounts for\n\n163\n00:08:39.668 --> 00:08:41.850\nmy domain controllers.\n\n164\n00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:43.900\nAll the others are gonna\ngo into Computers.\n\n165\n00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:44.800\nDomain controllers,\n\n166\n00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:50.220\na special computer on my network,\nthey go into the Domain Controllers OU.\n\n167\n00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.250\nAnd so that's what I get by default.\n\n168\n00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:54.630\nEverything else,\nI get to create on my own.\n\n169\n00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.450\nLike I've got an OU here\ncalled Client Computers.\n\n170\n00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:01.410\nAnd inside there,\nI've got GNV and NYC, right.\n\n171\n00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:03.480\nI created those, those weren't there.\n\n172\n00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.920\nI've got an Employee's container,\nI mean OU, sorry.\n\n173\n00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.820\nAnd inside there I've got Groups,\nand Hosts, and Managers,\n\n174\n00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.740\nand Operations, right?\n\n175\n00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:16.470\nAnd we create these OUs for\na couple of different reasons.\n\n176\n00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.440\nFirst and foremost is just to\norganize by objects, right?\n\n177\n00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.350\nBecause if I'm looking for\nDaniel's account, well,\n\n178\n00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:25.480\nI know Daniel's an employee here and\nhe's a host.\n\n179\n00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.984\nSo I could expand out Employees,\ngo down to Hosts.\n\n180\n00:09:28.984 --> 00:09:31.420\nAnd it's chugging along.\n\n181\n00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.730\nBut sure enough, there's the account for\nDaniel, all right.\n\n182\n00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:39.386\nSo just organizing my objects\nis the first reason we use OUs.\n\n183\n00:09:39.386 --> 00:09:43.527\nNow, Microsoft actually doesn't put\nthat as part of their uses for OUs.\n\n184\n00:09:43.527 --> 00:09:46.412\nI'll tell you,\nthat's a really good use for these OUs.\n\n185\n00:09:46.412 --> 00:09:47.310\n>> Yeah, Mike.\n\n186\n00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:51.730\nI'm super surprised at how many people\ndon't really pay a lot of attention to\n\n187\n00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:54.260\nactually organizing\ntheir Active Directory,\n\n188\n00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:58.790\nusing the organizational unit structure\nthat we've been given in Active Directory.\n\n189\n00:09:59.795 --> 00:10:01.145\nI've looked at Active Directories before.\n\n190\n00:10:01.145 --> 00:10:04.625\nI've even had to rebuild them,\njust because they are so\n\n191\n00:10:04.625 --> 00:10:05.870\ndisjointed and convoluted.\n\n192\n00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.805\nIt made it very difficult for\nany administrator to sit down,\n\n193\n00:10:08.805 --> 00:10:12.065\ntake a look at what was going on in Active\nDirectory, and understand the structure.\n\n194\n00:10:12.065 --> 00:10:13.880\nBecause there was no structure.\n\n195\n00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.080\nAnd even though Microsoft doesn't call\nthis out, it is a good habit to get into.\n\n196\n00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.870\nTry to build your Active Directory\nin a logical way,\n\n197\n00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.990\nin a way that makes sense\nto your organization.\n\n198\n00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:27.550\nIt's gonna help you out\nas an administrator.\n\n199\n00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:31.280\nAnd it's gonna help out anybody else that\nis also looking at your Active Directory.\n\n200\n00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.644\nIt's just common courtesy for\nyour other admins.\n\n201\n00:10:33.644 --> 00:10:34.673\n>> [LAUGH] Absolutely, please do that.\n\n202\n00:10:34.673 --> 00:10:35.375\n>> [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n203\n00:10:35.375 --> 00:10:37.510\n>> I don't wanna have to come to your\nneighborhood and go, what the heck?\n\n204\n00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:38.790\n>> No.\n\n205\n00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:42.030\n>> All right, so\nlet's see how we created an OU, very easy.\n\n206\n00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:43.440\nI'm gonna go up to my domain here.\n\n207\n00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.400\nI could just right-click.\n\n208\n00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.740\nWell, if I can right-click.\n\n209\n00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.060\nI'm not real good with a mouse.\n\n210\n00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:53.120\nI can right-click and I can go,\nNew > Organizational Unit.\n\n211\n00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.340\nIf I have the container selected\nthat I wanna make the OU in,\n\n212\n00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:01.250\nI could right-click out here and\ndo, New > Organizational unit.\n\n213\n00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:04.180\nOr, I could use my handy dandy,\nlittle button up here at the top, and\n\n214\n00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:07.280\nclick on that\nNew Organizational Unit button.\n\n215\n00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.630\nThat's gonna launch the wizard.\n\n216\n00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:11.410\nAnd to create an organizational unit,\nI have to give it a name.\n\n217\n00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:17.960\nI'm gonna call this one Servers,\nand I'll click OK.\n\n218\n00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.740\nAnd that was it, it's that easy.\n\n219\n00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:24.195\nI mean, it's just like creating a folder\nin your My Documents or My Pictures.\n\n220\n00:11:24.195 --> 00:11:25.741\nRight-click New Folder, give it a name.\n\n221\n00:11:25.741 --> 00:11:27.010\nBada-bing, you're done, right.\n\n222\n00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:28.084\n>> You're now OU masters.\n\n223\n00:11:28.084 --> 00:11:30.028\n[LAUGH]\n>> You are OU masters, I like it.\n\n224\n00:11:30.028 --> 00:11:33.180\nAll right, so, and we can nest OUs.\n\n225\n00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.010\nAs you can see already, I've done that.\n\n226\n00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:38.660\nBut maybe within the servers,\njust like I said about your pictures.\n\n227\n00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.300\nYou can choose how many\nlevels you want to go.\n\n228\n00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:45.300\nMaybe you've got your Pictures folder, and\nthen inside that, you've got Christmas.\n\n229\n00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:49.414\nAnd then inside that,\nyou've got 2013, 2014, and 2015.\n\n230\n00:11:49.414 --> 00:11:51.380\nRight, maybe you want to do it that way.\n\n231\n00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:55.502\nOr maybe you're happy with just Pictures,\nand then Christmas 2014, and\n\n232\n00:11:55.502 --> 00:11:57.820\na separate folder for Christmas 2015.\n\n233\n00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.900\nIt's really up to you, and\nit's the same thing with these OU's.\n\n234\n00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.940\nIt's whatever works best for\nyou and your organization.\n\n235\n00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:08.550\nNow I'm gonna tell you a couple\nthings of what we use these OUs for.\n\n236\n00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:12.280\nAnd that's really gonna guide you\nin how you should set these up.\n\n237\n00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:17.640\nBut there is no right or wrong way to set\nup your Active Directory infrastructure.\n\n238\n00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.480\nThere's better ways and\n\n239\n00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.280\nworse ways, [LAUGH] but\nthere's not really a wrong way, per se.\n\n240\n00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.906\nAll right, so within servers,\nmaybe instead of having one OU with\n\n241\n00:12:25.906 --> 00:12:30.840\nall off my server accounts in there, maybe\nI want to divide it up a little further.\n\n242\n00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:35.155\nI could do File Servers, all right.\n\n243\n00:12:35.155 --> 00:12:39.130\nI'm having trouble typing today.\n\n244\n00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:42.590\nAnd then maybe I want to go back out\nto Servers, and make another one.\n\n245\n00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:47.570\nAnd call it something like DNS Servers,\nall right.\n\n246\n00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:49.380\nAnd I can go on and on.\n\n247\n00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.870\nAnd then I can use that,\nagain, to organize my objects.\n\n248\n00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:56.700\nNow when we start out, you know what?\n\n249\n00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.260\nActually, I don't know that I have any.\n\n250\n00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.555\nLet's see, here we go.\n\n251\n00:12:59.555 --> 00:13:03.070\n[INAUDIBLE] Remember I said the default\nlocation is the Computers container.\n\n252\n00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:07.195\nThat's where new computer accounts\ngo as I join them to the domain.\n\n253\n00:13:07.195 --> 00:13:09.390\nI'm not stuck with that, I can move them.\n\n254\n00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:13.020\nLike I wanna move,\nlet's pretend this guy's a file server.\n\n255\n00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:16.980\nI can right-click on him and choose Move.\n\n256\n00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.560\nAnd I could move him to that\nFile Servers OU, right?\n\n257\n00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:24.300\nOr I go say this guy's a file server too.\n\n258\n00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:29.350\nI can click, and drag and\ndrop him on that File Servers OU.\n\n259\n00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.450\nNow notice when I right-click Move,\nit didn't warn me.\n\n260\n00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:36.650\nBut when I drag and drop, it does warn me\nthat moving objects in Active Directory\n\n261\n00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:41.070\ncan cause changes in the way policies\nare applied and permissions are assigned.\n\n262\n00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:42.530\nAre you sure you want to do that?\n\n263\n00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.300\nAnd I'll say yes, and\nthat's because, oops.\n\n264\n00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.640\nI'll say yes, and that's because, I don't\nknow if you've ever done this, Daniel.\n\n265\n00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.723\nI know I've done it a few times.\n\n266\n00:13:49.723 --> 00:13:53.363\nHave you ever been in File Explorer,\nand you go to drag a file and\n\n267\n00:13:53.363 --> 00:13:56.530\ndrop it somewhere, and\nit disappears on you, right?\n\n268\n00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:58.530\nYou let go a little too soon and you drop.\n\n269\n00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:01.350\nOr what's the worst one is,\nright at the last minute,\n\n270\n00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:04.640\nthe folder expands out to all the sub\nfolders right as you're dropping it.\n\n271\n00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.772\nAnd now you don't know which\nfolder you've dropped it in.\n\n272\n00:14:06.772 --> 00:14:08.350\n>> Yeah,\nI've been down that road once or twice.\n\n273\n00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:11.030\nSo dragging and dropping,\nwhile convenient,\n\n274\n00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:14.995\ncan also have some pitfalls and\nroadblocks you need to look out for.\n\n275\n00:14:14.995 --> 00:14:17.960\nThat is definitely one of them,\nI hate when I do that.\n\n276\n00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:18.633\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or\n\n277\n00:14:18.633 --> 00:14:20.307\nI hate when the computer does that to me.\n\n278\n00:14:20.307 --> 00:14:20.880\n>> That's right.\n\n279\n00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.749\n[LAUGH]\n>> Because you're like, I got this,\n\n280\n00:14:22.749 --> 00:14:24.035\nlet me drag this over there.\n\n281\n00:14:24.035 --> 00:14:28.130\nAnd you accidentally let go of the mouse,\nor it expands out a folder, and\n\n282\n00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:30.920\nas soon as you let go,\nit dropped into some folder.\n\n283\n00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.995\nI don't know which one it was,\nit's one of these.\n\n284\n00:14:32.995 --> 00:14:34.162\n[CROSSTALK] And\nI now gotta go find the thing.\n\n285\n00:14:34.162 --> 00:14:35.060\n>> [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n286\n00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.350\n>> So yeah, it can be a headache.\n\n287\n00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:38.830\n>> So that's why it gives you that\nwarning, hey did you mean to drag and\n\n288\n00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:39.630\ndrop that thing?\n\n289\n00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:43.010\nAnd if you had dropped it on the wrong\none, you can simply say, no.\n\n290\n00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:45.471\nAnd it'll put it back where it was and\nyou could try it again.\n\n291\n00:14:45.471 --> 00:14:49.457\nWhen you right-click Move, it's really\nhard to accidentally right-click,\n\n292\n00:14:49.457 --> 00:14:52.360\nchoose Move, pick the one you\nwanna move it to, click OK.\n\n293\n00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.389\nSo it doesn't bother warning\nyou at that point, all right.\n\n294\n00:14:55.389 --> 00:15:00.240\nAnd let's say I'll take WEB, and maybe\nI'll move him down here to DNS Servers,\n\n295\n00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.330\njust for giggles.\n\n296\n00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.030\nNow there's a little check mark,\nDon't show this warning again.\n\n297\n00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:08.671\nBut if you read it closely, Don't show\nthis warning while the snap-in is open.\n\n298\n00:15:08.671 --> 00:15:10.141\nSo if I check that and\n\n299\n00:15:10.141 --> 00:15:14.650\nsay yes, well, it won't warn me\nnow if I drag and drop again.\n\n300\n00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:16.330\nBut if I close this console,\n\n301\n00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.060\nopen the console again,\nit's gonna warn me the next time I do it.\n\n302\n00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:20.490\nSo it won't make it go away forever.\n\n303\n00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:23.150\nAll right, let's see where we're at.\n\n304\n00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:27.990\nSo we talked about the containers,\nthe built-in containers versus the OUs.\n\n305\n00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:30.610\nWe talked about all\nthe different defaults there.\n\n306\n00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:32.620\nThe next thing I want to talk about,\n\n307\n00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.450\nI did mention that I can\nchange that default location.\n\n308\n00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:38.392\nWell actually, before I do that,\n\n309\n00:15:38.392 --> 00:15:42.390\nlet's talk about the other reasons\nwe use organizational units.\n\n310\n00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:46.204\nAnd then changing the default will make\na little more sense to us, all right.\n\n311\n00:15:46.204 --> 00:15:50.664\nSo I said simply organizing my objects,\nthat's a good reason to make these OUs.\n\n312\n00:15:50.664 --> 00:15:54.259\nBut it's really not the primary reason,\nbelieve it or not.\n\n313\n00:15:54.259 --> 00:15:58.856\nThe primary reason we create\norganizational units is to\n\n314\n00:15:58.856 --> 00:16:04.170\ndelegate administrative control and\nassign group policy.\n\n315\n00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.640\nFor the exam, know those two, right?\n\n316\n00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:10.630\nDelegate administrative control and\nassign group policy.\n\n317\n00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:13.550\nNow, delegation is a really cool thing.\n\n318\n00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:18.560\nWe can delegate to people certain\nresponsibilities within active directory.\n\n319\n00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.330\nAs a domain admin, I've got full control.\n\n320\n00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.280\nI can do whatever I want\nin active directory.\n\n321\n00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.340\nI might want to give other\npeople pieces of my job, right?\n\n322\n00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.320\nI love delegation, that just means\nI'm taking part of my job and\n\n323\n00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.800\nassigning it to somebody else.\n\n324\n00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:31.350\nRight?\n\n325\n00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:33.340\nThat's the great thing about delegation,\nexcept for\n\n326\n00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:34.620\nthe fact that you've got\nto check up on them.\n\n327\n00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.780\nIf they do their job poorly,\nit comes back on you.\n\n328\n00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.500\nThat's besides the point.\n\n329\n00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.380\nDelegating allows me to assign\npeople the ability to do certain\n\n330\n00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:47.120\nthings with an active directory and\nMicrosoft makes it very easy to do that.\n\n331\n00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:51.160\nFor example, let's say I have,\nwhat's a good one here.\n\n332\n00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.730\nLet's look at,\nwho do I have on this computer, Daniel?\n\n333\n00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:56.800\nWe've got operations down here.\n\n334\n00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:01.100\nOh and I've got Jason and Nate,\nwe'll use them as our guinea pigs here.\n\n335\n00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:05.450\nNow I'm gonna follow best practices and\nI'm gonna make a new group.\n\n336\n00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:11.530\nAnd I'm gonna call this group my\nGNV Help Desk, if I can spell help and\n\n337\n00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:16.980\ndesk at the same time, there we go.\n\n338\n00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:20.422\n>> The j is silent, [LAUGH] remember.\n\n339\n00:17:20.422 --> 00:17:21.680\n>> All right.\n\n340\n00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:27.766\nAnd I'm going to create another group,\nand I'm gonna call it my NYC Help Desk.\n\n341\n00:17:27.766 --> 00:17:28.900\nAll right?\n\n342\n00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:36.120\nAnd I'm gonna dump Nate and\nI'm gonna add him to the GNV help desk.\n\n343\n00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:42.480\nAnd I'm gonna add Jason here\ncuz we're really ready for\n\n344\n00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.860\nhim to move on up to New York.\n\n345\n00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:48.850\nI'm gonna add him to the NYC help desk.\n\n346\n00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:50.340\nAll right.\n\n347\n00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.620\nSo cuz best practice says you\nshould always delegate to a group.\n\n348\n00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:57.360\nNever delegate to a user account,\nand here's why.\n\n349\n00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.200\nTwo reasons.\n\n350\n00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.581\nOne, maybe I only have Jason\nworking out at that New York help\n\n351\n00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:03.240\ndesk at this point, right.\n\n352\n00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.640\nBut next week, next month,\n\n353\n00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.780\nnext year I might have other people\nthat need that same set of permissions.\n\n354\n00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:11.440\nI don't want to have to delegate all\nover again, I delegate to the group and\n\n355\n00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.530\nI just add people to the group\nas they need those permissions.\n\n356\n00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:17.770\nIf Jason quits or moves back to\nGainesville I just take him out of\n\n357\n00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:20.150\nthat group,\nhe no longer has that permission.\n\n358\n00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:24.350\nAlways delegate to\na group never to a user.\n\n359\n00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:27.820\nThe other reason is there's\nno un-delegation right,\n\n360\n00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.550\nif I delegate something to\nJason's user account and\n\n361\n00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:33.760\nthen I decide he doesn't need\nthose permissions anymore.\n\n362\n00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.200\nI've got to actually dive through\nall the access control lists and\n\n363\n00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:41.910\nmanually remove those permissions,\nthere is no easy un-delegate wizard.\n\n364\n00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:42.510\nRight.\n\n365\n00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:43.580\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n366\n00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.500\nAlways delegate to a group.\n\n367\n00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.450\nSo what we're going to do is,\n\n368\n00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:49.580\nwe're going to delegate to,\nlet's go to GNV here to delegate.\n\n369\n00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:55.120\nI simply right-click on the OU,\nand I choose delegate control.\n\n370\n00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:58.860\nAnd then I'm going to\ngo through my wizard.\n\n371\n00:18:58.860 --> 00:18:59.710\nI'll click Next.\n\n372\n00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.980\nAnd I'll add first thing,\nwho do you want to delegate to?\n\n373\n00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.250\nWell I want to delegate\nto that GNV help desk.\n\n374\n00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:09.420\nSo I'll find my group, I'll click OK,\n\n375\n00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.910\nand I'll move onto the next\nstep of the wizard.\n\n376\n00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:14.780\nAnd then what do I want to delegate?\n\n377\n00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:19.000\nWell there are several common tasks that\nI can pick from, there's like 13 or so or\n\n378\n00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.380\nsomething like that.\n\n379\n00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:21.430\nAnd I can pick from these.\n\n380\n00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:24.880\nThings like create, delete,\nmanage user accounts etc., etc.\n\n381\n00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.820\nThere's a really cool file you can\n\n382\n00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:32.230\ngo get from Microsoft that's\ncalled Delegwix.inf or ini.\n\n383\n00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:34.100\nAnd you can replace\nthe default one with that.\n\n384\n00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.180\nIt has 72 common tasks.\n\n385\n00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:41.070\nJust a little FYI not exam material, but\nyou can make this list a whole lot longer.\n\n386\n00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:43.650\nIf one of the tasks you want\nto delegate is on this list\n\n387\n00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:45.520\nyou just pick it and move on.\n\n388\n00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:49.450\nIf what you're trying to delegate is\nnot on this list, is not a common task.\n\n389\n00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:52.000\nYou can choose create custom task and\n\n390\n00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.630\nyou can assign exactly what\nit is you want to this group.\n\n391\n00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:00.770\nNow what I want, I want to give my\nhelp desk administrative access or\n\n392\n00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:03.780\nfull control over those\ncomputers in Gainesville.\n\n393\n00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:04.290\nRight?\n\n394\n00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:07.780\nWell, there's no common task for\ncomputers, so I already know that, so\n\n395\n00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:10.210\nI'm gonna choose Custom,\nand I'll click Next.\n\n396\n00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:14.710\nAnd only the following\nobjects in this folder.\n\n397\n00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:16.740\nI'm gonna say computer objects.\n\n398\n00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:20.550\nThis is really cool with the delegation\nwizard, it's very specific.\n\n399\n00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:23.670\nIf I delegate these\npermissions over that GNVOU and\n\n400\n00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:27.930\nI give them full control over the\ncomputers, if there were user accounts or\n\n401\n00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:30.880\ngroups in that OU,\nthey would have no permissions over those.\n\n402\n00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:35.230\nIt's very specific what you're delegating,\nand I'll say I want them to be able to\n\n403\n00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:38.370\ncreate but maybe I don't want\nthem to be able to delete.\n\n404\n00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:42.320\nAnd that's something an admin would do and\nnot a help desk person.\n\n405\n00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.600\nDon't let them create computer\nobjects I'll click Next.\n\n406\n00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.150\nAll right.\n\n407\n00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:50.990\nAnd I'm going to give them full\ncontrol over those objects all right?\n\n408\n00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:53.950\nBut as you can see I can\nchoose whatever permission,\n\n409\n00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:57.940\nlike resetting passwords is a common\none to give to your help desk\n\n410\n00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.260\nbecause that's something that\npeople are always calling up for.\n\n411\n00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.790\nThey need to get their password reset.\n\n412\n00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:06.210\nI could delegate to my help desk\nthe ability to reset passwords.\n\n413\n00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:09.120\nThey could go into your account,\nreset your password, but\n\n414\n00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.450\nthey couldn't delete your account.\n\n415\n00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:12.070\nThey couldn't change your phone number.\n\n416\n00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:13.310\nThey couldn't do any of that.\n\n417\n00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:15.000\nIt's very, very specific.\n\n418\n00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.100\nYou can get very granular with\nthis delegation wizard, and\n\n419\n00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.190\nthat's a good thing.\n\n420\n00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:23.000\nI'll click Next and Finish.\n\n421\n00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.140\nAnd that was it.\nIt's all I had to do.\n\n422\n00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.000\nI just go through the wizard,\ntell it what I want.\n\n423\n00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.680\nAnd I wanna do the same thing down here.\n\n424\n00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:32.930\nI'm gonna right-click on this guy and\nchoose delegate control.\n\n425\n00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:35.750\nAnd I'll go through this a little\nquicker since we've seen it once.\n\n426\n00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:37.130\nWho do I want to delegate to?\n\n427\n00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:41.010\nThe New York City help desk and\n\n428\n00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:46.130\nI'll click Next and I'm gonna go with\nthe Create a Custom Task and Next and\n\n429\n00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:52.010\nthat's gonna be computer objects,\nchoose that guy there, computer objects.\n\n430\n00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:54.157\nCreate, not delete, Next.\n\n431\n00:21:54.157 --> 00:22:01.080\nFull Control and Next and\nFinish and I'm done.\n\n432\n00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:04.000\nNow what I delegated to the people for\nthe GNV helpdesk,\n\n433\n00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.230\nthey have full control over the computers.\n\n434\n00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:07.730\nIn the GNVOU.\n\n435\n00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:11.400\nThey do not have any control\nover the computers in the NYCOU.\n\n436\n00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:11.950\nRight?\n\n437\n00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:15.180\nThat's the cool thing about this\nis that it's very specific.\n\n438\n00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:17.700\nIt's specific about what\npermission you're assigning\n\n439\n00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.480\nas well as where you delegate it.\n\n440\n00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.230\nI right clicked on this and\n\n441\n00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:24.970\ngave that New York City Help Desk\npermission over this OU.\n\n442\n00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:26.930\nNot any other OUs.\n\n443\n00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:28.270\nRight?\nI might give help desk\n\n444\n00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:33.010\nthe ability to reset passwords for\nhosts, and operations.\n\n445\n00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:34.090\nBut not managers.\n\n446\n00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:35.790\nI don't want them resetting\nmanagers' passwords so\n\n447\n00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:37.550\nthen they would know the password for\nthe manager,\n\n448\n00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:39.450\nand they could logon as the manager.\n\n449\n00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:40.040\nRight?\n\n450\n00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.710\nSo very specific.\n\n451\n00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:43.510\nBut I can also go up one level.\n\n452\n00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:48.830\nWhat if I had a corporate help\ndesk that had to be able to,\n\n453\n00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:55.200\nwell say Corp Help Desk, all right.\n\n454\n00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.580\nAnd evidently I can't spell Corp, but-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n455\n00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:58.759\n>> We'll work with it, right?\n\n456\n00:23:00.182 --> 00:23:06.490\nI'll right-click up here, delegate control\nnext find that group that I'm not exactly\n\n457\n00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:12.247\nsure how I spelled that, yeah let's remove\nthat, I think it was C-O-R-O, C-O-R-O-P.\n\n458\n00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:15.730\nThere it is, Corrup help desk.\n\n459\n00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:16.339\n>> Corrup help desk.\n\n460\n00:23:16.339 --> 00:23:17.328\n[LAUGH]\n>> That'll work right?\n\n461\n00:23:17.328 --> 00:23:20.764\nWe'll click OK,\nnow it knows who I want to delegate to and\n\n462\n00:23:20.764 --> 00:23:25.272\nI'll tell them I want to give them,\nwe're gonna create a custom task, and\n\n463\n00:23:25.272 --> 00:23:28.807\nwe're gonna do only the following objects,\ncomputers.\n\n464\n00:23:28.807 --> 00:23:32.850\nAnd since they're corporate I'm gonna\ngive them both create and delete.\n\n465\n00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:38.943\nClick Next, I'll give them full control,\nthen Next, then Finish.\n\n466\n00:23:38.943 --> 00:23:43.314\nBecause I did that here the client\ncomputer's OU,just like NTFS\n\n467\n00:23:43.314 --> 00:23:45.858\npermissions this will inherit down so\n\n468\n00:23:45.858 --> 00:23:50.479\ncorporate now has full control over\nGNV and New York City computers.\n\n469\n00:23:50.479 --> 00:23:54.285\nSo very cool ability to delegate,\nto be able to run that wizard,\n\n470\n00:23:54.285 --> 00:23:55.557\nvery simple wizard.\n\n471\n00:23:55.557 --> 00:23:58.630\nRemember delegate to groups,\nnot to individual users.\n\n472\n00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:02.481\nBecause if I want to remove those\npermissions I would actually have to pull\n\n473\n00:24:02.481 --> 00:24:04.157\nup the properties of this guy and\n\n474\n00:24:04.157 --> 00:24:07.653\nstart unchecking permissions,\nthere's no undelegate wizard.\n\n475\n00:24:07.653 --> 00:24:11.998\nBut since I did it to a group if I remove\nthe user from the group even though\n\n476\n00:24:11.998 --> 00:24:17.299\nthe group still has permissions there's\nnobody in the group, so it doesn't matter.\n\n477\n00:24:17.299 --> 00:24:18.080\nRight?\n\n478\n00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.040\nNext week we hire somebody that is gonna\nbe on help desk we put them in the group,\n\n479\n00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.700\nI don't have to go\nthrough the wizard again.\n\n480\n00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:28.470\nIt works out really well if you follow\nthat practice of delegating to groups,\n\n481\n00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:29.240\nnot to users.\n\n482\n00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.310\nAll right, now, the next thing I want to\ntalk about, remember we were talking about\n\n483\n00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:38.610\nwhy we create these OUs, and I said we\ncan delegate administrative control,\n\n484\n00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:41.815\nyou cannot delegate over a container.\n\n485\n00:24:41.815 --> 00:24:42.990\nRight?\n\n486\n00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:47.290\nSo I can't go to this computer's\ncontainer and delegate control.\n\n487\n00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:50.320\nIt looks like it's gonna let me,\nbut trust me, it's gonna fail.\n\n488\n00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:51.790\nIt won't work, all right?\n\n489\n00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:54.690\nI can't delegate control\nover that user's container.\n\n490\n00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:59.730\nSo you can't delegate control, you also\ncannot link group policy, we'll come\n\n491\n00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:06.320\nback to that concept in a second which is\nwhy a lot of times we change the default.\n\n492\n00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:11.230\nI don't want this my computer's to go\nto here by default because when they do\n\n493\n00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:14.342\nI can't link policy there, I can't\ndelegate administrative control there.\n\n494\n00:25:14.342 --> 00:25:18.600\nI'm gonna end up having to move them\nmanually to these other locations.\n\n495\n00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.180\nRight?\n\n496\n00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:21.910\nSo if I wanna change\nthat default location,\n\n497\n00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:24.500\nI can change it to say\nthe client computers.\n\n498\n00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:27.280\nI still might have to move them to G and\nV and New York City,\n\n499\n00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:31.350\nwhichever was appropriate, but at least\nthey're here where now the corporate\n\n500\n00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:33.360\nhelp desk has administrative control.\n\n501\n00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:36.120\nOnce I move them into the proper sub OU\n\n502\n00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:39.790\nthen that local helpdesk would get\nthe appropriate level of control as well.\n\n503\n00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:43.040\nRight?\nBut while they're here corporate helpdesk\n\n504\n00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:46.680\nor GNV helpdesk or New York City helpdesk\nhas no administrative rights over.\n\n505\n00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.240\nRight?\n\n506\n00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.140\nSo I really don't want\nthat to be my default.\n\n507\n00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:53.947\nThe command is simply, let me pull up my\n\n508\n00:25:53.947 --> 00:25:58.183\ncommand prompt here, re dir cmp.\n\n509\n00:25:58.183 --> 00:26:03.621\nAll right, a funny little name and\nthen I'd have to give\n\n510\n00:26:03.621 --> 00:26:09.870\nit the distinguished name of\nthe container which would be gosh,\n\n511\n00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:15.539\nif I could remember that's\ngonna be CN equals computers,\n\n512\n00:26:15.539 --> 00:26:18.690\nDC equals lab, DC equals nets.\n\n513\n00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:19.590\nSee if it likes that CN.\n\n514\n00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:20.160\nThere you go.\n\n515\n00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.700\nRedirection was successful.\n\n516\n00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.464\nAll right,\nthat's known as the distinguished name.\n\n517\n00:26:24.464 --> 00:26:27.633\nWe'll cover that in other episodes\nif you're not familiar with it.\n\n518\n00:26:27.633 --> 00:26:31.325\nSo now, wait I just redirected\nit right back to the same one.\n\n519\n00:26:31.325 --> 00:26:33.012\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That didn't work.\n\n520\n00:26:33.012 --> 00:26:35.154\n>> So you can't do this in\nthe graphical interface,\n\n521\n00:26:35.154 --> 00:26:36.843\nit has to be done to the command prompt.\n\n522\n00:26:36.843 --> 00:26:40.427\nRight?\n>> It does have to be done in the command\n\n523\n00:26:40.427 --> 00:26:47.450\nprompt here, so what I should say\nis OU equals client computers.\n\n524\n00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:50.990\nI spelled that right, which is in\nthe DC lab, which is in DC net.\n\n525\n00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:52.210\nThat one should be better.\n\n526\n00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:53.932\nThere we go.\nRedirection was successful.\n\n527\n00:26:53.932 --> 00:26:56.900\nSo, now,\nwhen I add new computers to the domain,\n\n528\n00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:00.166\nthey'll go here instead of\nthe computers container.\n\n529\n00:27:00.166 --> 00:27:00.806\nRight?\n\n530\n00:27:00.806 --> 00:27:03.230\nSo what was that?\n\n531\n00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:05.065\nSo that's how we can change that.\n\n532\n00:27:05.065 --> 00:27:08.188\nLast thing Daniel that I think I wanna\ntalk about is the group policy thing.\n\n533\n00:27:08.188 --> 00:27:08.804\nRight?\n\n534\n00:27:08.804 --> 00:27:12.116\nBecause group policy is\nsomething else that we've got,\n\n535\n00:27:12.116 --> 00:27:16.129\nother episodes we're gonna dive in\nto look at these group policies.\n\n536\n00:27:16.129 --> 00:27:19.692\nBut a quick overview of group\npolicy is a way that I can apply\n\n537\n00:27:19.692 --> 00:27:24.661\nsettings on machines on my network without\nhaving to go to every single machine.\n\n538\n00:27:24.661 --> 00:27:28.378\nI could say, maybe I want to\nset the screen saver time out\n\n539\n00:27:28.378 --> 00:27:31.870\nto ten minutes on all\nthe computers in Gainesville.\n\n540\n00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:32.767\nRight?\n\n541\n00:27:32.767 --> 00:27:38.130\nI don't wanna go to each and every\nmachine, I can do it through group policy.\n\n542\n00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:42.030\nAnd I'll show you that when we get into\nthat particular set of objectives.\n\n543\n00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:43.810\nFor now what I want you to know is,\n\n544\n00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:47.460\nI cannot link group policy to\nthis computer's container.\n\n545\n00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.720\nSo I can't apply settings\nif they're still in here.\n\n546\n00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:54.920\nI can only link group policies to\nthe site, to the domain, to the OU.\n\n547\n00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:58.000\nAnd so that's why we do,\nwe create these OU's.\n\n548\n00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.173\nTo delegate administrative control and\nlink group policy.\n\n549\n00:28:01.173 --> 00:28:02.856\nIt's also why we create this hierarchy.\n\n550\n00:28:02.856 --> 00:28:06.812\nAgain organization is important but\nif I have all my computers,\n\n551\n00:28:06.812 --> 00:28:11.282\nboth Gainesville computer and\nNew York City computers in this one client\n\n552\n00:28:11.282 --> 00:28:14.590\ncomputers OU,\nI didn't make those sub OUs in there.\n\n553\n00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:19.062\nHow would I apply a setting to\njust the computers in Gainesville?\n\n554\n00:28:19.062 --> 00:28:22.733\nWell, they're all in the same container,\nI apply the policy to container,\n\n555\n00:28:22.733 --> 00:28:24.041\nthey're all gonna get it.\n\n556\n00:28:24.041 --> 00:28:27.910\nNow there are ways we can do this,\nbut it's a lot more work.\n\n557\n00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:30.980\nWhereas if I divide them up,\nnow it's really easy.\n\n558\n00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:35.450\nIf I have a setting that only applies to\nGainesville computers, I can link it here.\n\n559\n00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:40.000\nIf I have a setting that applies to just\nNew York computers I can link it here.\n\n560\n00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.690\nIf I have a setting that applies\nto all computers, New York and\n\n561\n00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:45.170\nGainesville, I can link it here.\n\n562\n00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:49.010\nSo by setting up that hierarchy\nI'm easing administration.\n\n563\n00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:50.550\nRight?\nI'm making it easier for\n\n564\n00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:53.320\nme to apply these policies.\n\n565\n00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:57.700\nAnd so, when we talk about OUs,\nI say use them to organize your objects.\n\n566\n00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:59.690\nThat's my first reason for creating them.\n\n567\n00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:02.690\nBut when it comes down to it,\nand for exam objectives, it's for\n\n568\n00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:07.180\ndelegating administrative control and\nfor linking group policy.\n\n569\n00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:10.120\nAnd making it easier to\ndo both of those tasks.\n\n570\n00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:10.764\n>> Awesome stuff, Mike.\n\n571\n00:29:10.764 --> 00:29:15.681\nHopefully you users, or viewers should I\nsay, got me all in administrator mode,\n\n572\n00:29:15.681 --> 00:29:17.785\nI'm thinking users everywhere.\n\n573\n00:29:17.785 --> 00:29:19.550\nRight?\nGroups, it's all good stuff.\n\n574\n00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:22.640\nHopefully you viewers out\nthere are understanding this,\n\n575\n00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.850\nstarting to get this down.\n\n576\n00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:26.360\nStart seeing the importance\nof that hierarchy,\n\n577\n00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:29.980\nthat organization that we\nuse very logical flow,\n\n578\n00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:33.500\nwhen it comes down to stuff like\ndelegation and setting the group policy.\n\n579\n00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:35.312\nIt's very, very important stuff.\n\n580\n00:29:35.312 --> 00:29:37.057\nAll right, Mike,\nhave we skipped over anything or\n\n581\n00:29:37.057 --> 00:29:38.896\nhave we come to the end of\nanother excellent episode?\n\n582\n00:29:38.896 --> 00:29:40.184\n>> I think we're at the end.\n\n583\n00:29:40.184 --> 00:29:42.690\n>> All right,\nwell hopefully you guys have enjoyed.\n\n584\n00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:44.220\nWe had a great time making it for you.\n\n585\n00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.080\nWe do appreciate you watching.\n\n586\n00:29:46.080 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.821 --> 00:00:17.620\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.990\nHere with me yet again,\nis Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.080\nHow's it going today, Michael?\n\n6\n00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.280\n>> Oh, it's going great, Daniel.\n\n7\n00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:22.880\nI'm excited.\n\n8\n00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.780\nWe're continuing our MTA Windows Server\nAdministration Fundamentals course.\n\n9\n00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.006\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be diving\ninto some of my favorite stuff, and that\n\n10\n00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:36.013\nis Active Directory and, in particular,\nActive Directory Infrastructure.\n\n11\n00:00:36.013 --> 00:00:37.746\nSo we're gonna take a look at really,\n\n12\n00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:41.600\nwhat Active Directory is like when we\nbreak it down, when we look at it.\n\n13\n00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.230\nHow is it set up, how does it replicate,\nand good things like that so.\n\n14\n00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.030\nLots of fun times, lots of good times\nwith good old Active Directory.\n\n15\n00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.180\n>> Yeah Mike, we've gotta understand\nhow the Active Directory is built,\n\n16\n00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.806\nto kind of differences inside of it when\nwe get into those lovely different MMCs or\n\n17\n00:00:58.806 --> 00:01:02.139\nthe consoles,\nthe Management Consoles that are built for\n\n18\n00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:03.994\nthe good old Active Directory.\n\n19\n00:01:03.994 --> 00:01:07.110\nSo we know what each one of them does,\nhow we can work with them.\n\n20\n00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.280\nSo that as we move into\nthe administration role,\n\n21\n00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.990\nit's not some uncharted waters for us.\n\n22\n00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.752\nSo Mike, you're gonna help us out\nwith that today, that's your job.\n\n23\n00:01:15.752 --> 00:01:17.760\n>> All right.\n>> Is to teach us all,\n\n24\n00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.260\nwhat to do when we finally have\ninstalled Active Directory, and\n\n25\n00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.590\nall the little bells and\nwhistles that go along with it.\n\n26\n00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.120\nFire away.\n[LAUGH]\n\n27\n00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.220\n>> Sound's good, where do we start.\n\n28\n00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.970\nStart with domain controllers, right?\n\n29\n00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.630\nThe first thing we need to understand,\nis that until we have a domain controller,\n\n30\n00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.130\nwe don't have a domain, right?\n\n31\n00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.150\nThat's the basics of it.\n\n32\n00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.763\nWhen you start out, let's say you go to\na company and they're just a work group.\n\n33\n00:01:38.763 --> 00:01:41.730\nThey got a bunch of computers,\nsome laptops, some desktops,\n\n34\n00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.940\nand they're in a work group environment.\n\n35\n00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.320\nAnd they're growing, they're getting\nbeyond, Microsoft's recommendation is ten,\n\n36\n00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.920\nit's really what ever your\nadministration can handle.\n\n37\n00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.190\nAnd I'll tell you by ten,\nyou have ten different users and\n\n38\n00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.150\ncomputers you're gonna pray for\na domain, all right.\n\n39\n00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.980\nBut as we move up in those numbers,\n\n40\n00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.260\nwe want to move to that\nActive Directory domain.\n\n41\n00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.390\nBecause it simplifies administration,\nmakes it a whole lot easier to work with.\n\n42\n00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.990\nSo we decide yeah,\nwe wanna go to Active Directory.\n\n43\n00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.610\nWe wanna use a domain.\n\n44\n00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.280\nHow do I do it?\n\n45\n00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.870\nWell, you take a server\nthat's running 2008 R2.\n\n46\n00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.410\nAnd you install the role,\nActive Directory Domain Services.\n\n47\n00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.730\nThat's really what you do.\n\n48\n00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.050\nAnd once you do that you've\ncreated your first domain.\n\n49\n00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.010\nThen you can take additional servers, and\nyou can install Active Directory on them,\n\n50\n00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.835\nto create additional domain controllers\nwithin that Active Directory domain.\n\n51\n00:02:29.835 --> 00:02:34.460\nCuz, we never want just one domain\ncontroller, minimum of two.\n\n52\n00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.560\nBecause the domain controller is gonna be\nresponsible for security in your domain.\n\n53\n00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.600\nEverybody has to talk to a domain\ncontroller to authenticate, to log on.\n\n54\n00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.118\nIt's where all my group policies come\nfrom, and they're being applied.\n\n55\n00:02:46.118 --> 00:02:49.903\nSo if that domain controller goes down,\nnobody can log on, nobody can\n\n56\n00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:54.220\nauthenticate, things are gonna come to\na screeching halt, not gonna be good.\n\n57\n00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.030\nSo more than one domain controller,\nminimum of two, all right?\n\n58\n00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.390\nAnd it's simply a role,\nlike I said, that I install.\n\n59\n00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.270\nI've got a domain controller here.\n\n60\n00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.720\nI'll flip over to this other server,\nand I can go to roles.\n\n61\n00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.450\nAnd I can choose to add roles.\n\n62\n00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.610\nAnd I'll click Next here, and\n\n63\n00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.740\nthere you can see my Active Directory\nDomain Services role does require .net.\n\n64\n00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.710\nAnd I'm not gonna go through\nthe installation process here, that's for\n\n65\n00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:19.550\nanother episode.\n\n66\n00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.780\nBut that's it, it's just a role\nthat I'm going to install.\n\n67\n00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.650\nUnderstand though, that it is a two part\nprocess, you install the role, right?\n\n68\n00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.330\nThat unpacks everything necessary to make\nthat machine into domain controller, but\n\n69\n00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.080\nthen you have to go back and\nconfigure it as a domain controller.\n\n70\n00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.110\nSo until you do that second step,\nyou don't have a domain.\n\n71\n00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.090\nYou've got a server that's ready\nto become a domain controller, but\n\n72\n00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.810\nyou've gotta go through\nthe Active Directory configuration wizard\n\n73\n00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.350\nto actually complete the process,\nand make your domain controller.\n\n74\n00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.760\nAnd once you do, you've got a domain\ncontroller like I've got here.\n\n75\n00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.940\nAnd since this is a domain controller, I'm\ngonna see new tools like Active Directory,\n\n76\n00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.460\nUsers and Computers, and Sites and\nServices, and Domains and\n\n77\n00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.590\nTrusts, and the Administrative Center,\nand all this other stuff.\n\n78\n00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.110\nAnd I can open up one of these tools, and\nI can now administer Active Directory.\n\n79\n00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.280\nI can see all my OU's and my built-in\ncontainers, and I can come in here and\n\n80\n00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.090\nwork with my user accounts, and\n\n81\n00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.330\nmy computer accounts,\nwhatever it is I need to do.\n\n82\n00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:19.580\nI go down to Server's there.\n\n83\n00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.110\nI can look at my DNS servers, right?\n\n84\n00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.160\nActive Directory is now installed.\n\n85\n00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.740\nAnd when we install Active Directory\nwe get a couple of things,\n\n86\n00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.660\nwe get these administrative tools first\nof all, to manage Active Directory.\n\n87\n00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.740\nWe also get a copy of\nthe Active Directory database.\n\n88\n00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.560\nAnd if we take a look at file explorer\nhere on this domain controller.\n\n89\n00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.820\nI can go into c:Windows.\n\n90\n00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:49.195\nLet me find it down here, NTDS, and there\nis the actual Active Directory database.\n\n91\n00:04:49.195 --> 00:04:53.820\nNtds.dit, that is the actual database.\n\n92\n00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.020\nThe file itself.\n\n93\n00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.252\n>> So right click, delete,\nyou're good to go.\n\n94\n00:04:57.252 --> 00:04:58.890\n[LAUGH] Let's go.\n\n95\n00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.402\n>> That's what we call an RGE, right.\n\n96\n00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:07.580\nAnd if you never heard of what an RGE is,\nthat's a resume generating event.\n\n97\n00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.932\nWhen you delete that,\nyou better go polish up your resume.\n\n98\n00:05:09.932 --> 00:05:10.445\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n99\n00:05:10.445 --> 00:05:12.700\n>> No but of course you got a great backup\n\n100\n00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.972\nof it, so they can just put it back.\n\n101\n00:05:13.972 --> 00:05:14.700\n>> That's right.\n>> You're good to go,\n\n102\n00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.200\nnobody will even be the wiser.\n\n103\n00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.140\nAll right.\n\n104\n00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.600\nSo you get the administrative tools, and\n\n105\n00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.260\nyou get a copy of that\nActive Directory database.\n\n106\n00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.960\nYou also get a copy,\n\n107\n00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.650\nlocated SQL in Windows as well,\nof something called SYSVOL.\n\n108\n00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.310\nSYSVOL is where a few things are stored.\n\n109\n00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.930\nFor now, we're just gonna say, this is\nwhere most of my group policy information\n\n110\n00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.970\nis going to be stored, all right.\n\n111\n00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.870\nNow, next thing so,\nset up a domain controller, you get\n\n112\n00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.810\na copy of the Active Directory database,\nand you get a copy of that SYSVOL folder.\n\n113\n00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.560\nThose replicate to other\ndomain controllers.\n\n114\n00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.630\nIf you have more than\none domain controller,\n\n115\n00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.030\nthose are gonna be replicating, so\nif I go to one domain controller and\n\n116\n00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.370\nmake a new user, it gets stored in\nthat Active Directory database.\n\n117\n00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.830\nYou go to another domain controller\n,and you open Active Directory,\n\n118\n00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.860\nyou're gonna see that user, because\nit's a copy of the database, right.\n\n119\n00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.690\nThat's why I said when you install Active\nDirectory, you get a copy of the database.\n\n120\n00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.600\nNow the very first one you create,\nof course there's nothing to copy, so\n\n121\n00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.268\nit creates a blank database with\njust the default stuff in it.\n\n122\n00:06:15.268 --> 00:06:19.420\nBut as you make more domain controllers,\nif I create a second one right now,\n\n123\n00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.410\nit's gonna talk to my first one and\nsay, hey, I'm a new domain controller.\n\n124\n00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.560\nGive me a copy of the Active Directory\ndatabase in SYSVOL, right?\n\n125\n00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.640\nAdd a third one, hey, one of you guys give\nme a copy of that database in SYSVOL, so\n\n126\n00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.400\nI can be a domain controller too.\n\n127\n00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.730\nAnd then any changes will replicate\nto those other domain controllers.\n\n128\n00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:36.580\nAnd we'll come back and\n\n129\n00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.580\nwe'll talk a little bit about that\nreplication process in just a second.\n\n130\n00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.050\nSo, high level, that's really\nwhat a domain controller it is.\n\n131\n00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.540\nIt contains a copy of the Active Director\ndatabase, and that SYSVOL folder, and all\n\n132\n00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:53.310\nmy administrative tools for administering\nthat Active Directory database.\n\n133\n00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:58.540\nNow, next concept we need to grasp,\nis the concept of a forest, right,\n\n134\n00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.780\nand really domains as well.\n\n135\n00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:06.390\nBecause I said when we start out with\nnothing, we take our first server, and\n\n136\n00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.020\nI'm gonna dump a server out here.\n\n137\n00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.740\nSo we start out with nothing.\n\n138\n00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:15.325\nI take my first server, and let's make\nhim a little less obnoxious there.\n\n139\n00:07:15.325 --> 00:07:18.285\n>> [LAUGH] The hacker green's not-\n>> Yeah, let's move that.\n\n140\n00:07:18.285 --> 00:07:19.720\nAll right, so lets say lab.net.\n\n141\n00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.790\nI decide I wanna make a domain\ncalled lab.net, all right.\n\n142\n00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.450\nSo I take a server, and\nI install Active Directory on it.\n\n143\n00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.870\nAnd I go through the configuration wizard,\nand\n\n144\n00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:32.100\nI make my very first domain,\nand I name it lab.net.\n\n145\n00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.100\nWhen I do that, I also create a forest.\n\n146\n00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.550\nIt doesn't really say,\nwell it kind of does,\n\n147\n00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:41.440\nbut you're creating a forest as well,\nall right.\n\n148\n00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.140\nSo, now I've got this forest with\na single domain in it, called lab.net.\n\n149\n00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:49.774\nThe forest actually takes the name\nof that first domain, right.\n\n150\n00:07:49.774 --> 00:07:53.546\nThen we can add additional\ndomain controllers, and\n\n151\n00:07:53.546 --> 00:07:58.013\nI'll shrink him down a little bit and\nadd a couple more there.\n\n152\n00:07:58.013 --> 00:08:01.728\nAnd then again, I want more then\none domain controller, right?\n\n153\n00:08:01.728 --> 00:08:06.111\nNow, as our organization grows for\nadministrative reasons,\n\n154\n00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:09.200\nwe might make additional domains.\n\n155\n00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.111\nAnd when we do that,\nwe can make child domains.\n\n156\n00:08:13.111 --> 00:08:14.590\nRight?\n\n157\n00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:18.373\nSo, and I know I'm kinda jumping\na little bit on the objectives here, but\n\n158\n00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:22.108\nour lab.net, if we want to make\nanother domain we need another server.\n\n159\n00:08:22.108 --> 00:08:22.630\nAll right?\n\n160\n00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:28.330\nSo let me grab one here, and we're\ngonna install active directory on it.\n\n161\n00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.370\nAnd we're gonna make another domain.\n\n162\n00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:34.540\nWhen we go through the wizard,\nthe configuration wizard, it's gonna say,\n\n163\n00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:36.550\ndo you want to create a brand new forest,\n\n164\n00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:39.840\nwhich is the only option I had\nwhen I created that first domain.\n\n165\n00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.860\nRight?\nBecause there was nothing else.\n\n166\n00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.630\nDo you want to create a brand new forest?\n\n167\n00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:48.310\nDo you want to add an additional domain\ncontroller to an existing domain?\n\n168\n00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:52.600\nOr do you want to make a new\ndomain in an existing forest?\n\n169\n00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.380\nRight?\nAnd so,\n\n170\n00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.770\nI'm gonna say I'll make a new\ndomain in an existing forest.\n\n171\n00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:01.200\nThen when I name that new domain, I've\ngotta decide what I'm gonna name it, and\n\n172\n00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:07.850\nif I name it like this, us.lab.net,\nthat is what we call a child domain.\n\n173\n00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:11.940\nAnd this is what's known\nas a contiguous name space.\n\n174\n00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:16.795\nYou see how the child took the parent's\nname and put his name out in front of it.\n\n175\n00:09:16.795 --> 00:09:19.220\nRight?\nI got another child domain over here.\n\n176\n00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:26.089\nSo, I take another server, and\nI make another domain called au.lab.net.\n\n177\n00:09:26.089 --> 00:09:26.720\nRight?\n\n178\n00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.490\nWell, that's another\nchild domain of lab.net.\n\n179\n00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:32.940\nAgain, contiguous name space.\n\n180\n00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.020\nAnd then, of course,\nI've got that one here, west.au.lab.net.\n\n181\n00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:39.694\nThat would be a child of au.lab.net.\n\n182\n00:09:39.694 --> 00:09:41.563\nAgain, contiguous name space.\n\n183\n00:09:41.563 --> 00:09:46.354\nContiguous name space means the names\nare building on each other, right?\n\n184\n00:09:46.354 --> 00:09:51.531\nThat the child just adds his name\nto the front of the parent's name.\n\n185\n00:09:51.531 --> 00:09:54.375\nBut I don't have to stick\nwith that name space.\n\n186\n00:09:54.375 --> 00:09:58.930\nAnd what if I want another domain and\nI want to call this one contoso.com?\n\n187\n00:09:58.930 --> 00:09:59.740\nAll right.\n\n188\n00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.390\nSo I make another domain controller.\n\n189\n00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:06.650\nAnd I still choose add an,\nexcuse me, add a new domain\n\n190\n00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:10.532\nto an existing forest, but this time I\nuse a completely different name space.\n\n191\n00:10:10.532 --> 00:10:12.800\nAll right?\nI don't use that same name space,\n\n192\n00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.420\nI use contoso.com.\n\n193\n00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:15.010\nRight?\n\n194\n00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:19.450\nStill part of this forest, but\nthis is what we call a separate tree.\n\n195\n00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:24.050\nAll these four domains over here are all\npart of a domain tree because they all\n\n196\n00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:28.600\nshare that common route name,\ntheir names just build on each other.\n\n197\n00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.690\nThis, completely different name space.\n\n198\n00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:34.850\nStill part of my forest,\nbut separate name space.\n\n199\n00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:38.890\nAnd then I've got a child domain\nover here, us.contoso.com, right?\n\n200\n00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:42.660\nThis is a separate tree within my forest.\n\n201\n00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:46.080\nSo right now I've got a forest\nthat has two trees in it.\n\n202\n00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.820\nA tree could be a single domain.\n\n203\n00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:52.250\nIn a small environment,\nyour forest might consist of one domain.\n\n204\n00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.540\nSo you've got one short little stubby\ntree out there, and that's all you got.\n\n205\n00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.050\nAnd I will tell you that for\n\n206\n00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:00.642\nmost environments that's all\nyou're ever going to need.\n\n207\n00:11:00.642 --> 00:11:02.500\nRight?\nBut in certain environments,\n\n208\n00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.700\nin complex environments,\nwe need to break it up.\n\n209\n00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.900\nLike this a lot of times\nhappens with business mergers.\n\n210\n00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:09.400\nAll right?\n\n211\n00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.510\nBecause I need to bring their\ninfrastructure into my control,\n\n212\n00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:14.550\nin my forest.\n\n213\n00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.700\nBut I don't want to lose their namespace.\n\n214\n00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:21.050\nThat would be like saying, hey,\nI'm gonna go buy the Nike organization, or\n\n215\n00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.120\nsomething like that, and\nI'm gonna bring that in,\n\n216\n00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.650\nand I'm gonna just change everything, and\nI'm gonna call it Mike's Tennis Shoes.\n\n217\n00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:27.726\nCall it Mikey.\n\n218\n00:11:27.726 --> 00:11:28.226\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n219\n00:11:28.226 --> 00:11:29.219\n>> Call it Mikey. There we go.\n\n220\n00:11:29.219 --> 00:11:32.802\n[LAUGH] That was a good\none I have my moments.\n\n221\n00:11:32.802 --> 00:11:34.504\n[LAUGH] But you know,\n\n222\n00:11:34.504 --> 00:11:37.878\nI lose that recognition, right?\nNobody knows out there knows\n\n223\n00:11:37.878 --> 00:11:40.129\nMikey Tennis Shoes.\nEverybody knows Nike.\n\n224\n00:11:40.129 --> 00:11:42.108\n>> They'll think you're ripping them off.\n\n225\n00:11:42.108 --> 00:11:42.617\n>> Right, exactly.\n\n226\n00:11:42.617 --> 00:11:43.170\n[LAUGH] So,\n\n227\n00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:45.855\nI might wanna keep that brand\nrecognition and that name.\n\n228\n00:11:45.855 --> 00:11:48.310\nSo, that's when you see things like this.\n\n229\n00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:51.970\nThat's one of the reasons you see\nthis discontiguous name space.\n\n230\n00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:54.490\nOr maybe my organization\nis just branching out and\n\n231\n00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:58.730\nwe got separate sister organizations or\ncompanies that we run, and\n\n232\n00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:00.905\nagain they have a different names space.\n\n233\n00:12:00.905 --> 00:12:02.300\nAll right?\n\n234\n00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.130\nSo that's a forest.\n\n235\n00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:05.770\nThat's a domain tree.\n\n236\n00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:09.702\nWe talked about name spaces, and\ncontiguous name spaces there.\n\n237\n00:12:09.702 --> 00:12:11.770\nAll right?\nNow, a forest,\n\n238\n00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:13.520\nthere's something about a forest.\n\n239\n00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.050\nWe need to talk about\nwhat makes this forest.\n\n240\n00:12:17.168 --> 00:12:22.360\nAnd a forest is really defined is,\nwhat's a good way to say this?\n\n241\n00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:26.710\nA forest is all of the domains that\nare under the same administrative control.\n\n242\n00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:29.790\nYou guys have probably all\nheard of domain admins, right?\n\n243\n00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:31.780\nThat's the uber account within a domain.\n\n244\n00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.800\nThey have full control over\neverything within their domain.\n\n245\n00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.240\nSo, in lab.net there's\na group called Domain Admins.\n\n246\n00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.750\nAnd if you're in that group you've got\nfull control over everything there.\n\n247\n00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:45.030\nBut you would have no\ncontrol over au.lab.net.\n\n248\n00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:46.460\nYou're not a Domain Admin down here.\n\n249\n00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:48.210\nThey've got there own Domain Admins.\n\n250\n00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:50.480\nCompletely separate domain.\n\n251\n00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.370\nThere is, however,\na group known as the Enterprise Admins.\n\n252\n00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:58.422\nAnd they have full control\nover the forest itself, right?\n\n253\n00:12:58.422 --> 00:13:01.520\nSo if they can make changes\nthat effect all domains,\n\n254\n00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:05.490\nthey can add new domains to the forest,\nthey can remove domains from the forest.\n\n255\n00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:09.300\nA Domain Admin can't do that because\na Domain Admin only has rights\n\n256\n00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.620\nwithin his domain, right?\n\n257\n00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:14.970\nThat boundary there, that triangle,\nthat's a security boundary.\n\n258\n00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:19.750\nThe Domain Admin cannot go outside\nof his domain, cannot make changes\n\n259\n00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:23.350\nthat would affect other domains, cuz he\nhas no rights in those other domains.\n\n260\n00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:24.230\nAll right?\n\n261\n00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:27.962\nAnd a forest also shares a common schema.\n\n262\n00:13:27.962 --> 00:13:32.420\nIn a schema, when we look at active\ndirectory, there's several objects I could\n\n263\n00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:37.140\ncreate inside active directory, like\na new user or a new computer or a new OU.\n\n264\n00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.470\nBut when I right click new user,\n\n265\n00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:43.010\nif I go back over to my domain\ncontroller here, is this the same?\n\n266\n00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:44.195\nYeah.\n\n267\n00:13:44.195 --> 00:13:47.430\nI go into active directory,\nI may go down to host and\n\n268\n00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:50.580\nlet's say we hire a new host here.\n\n269\n00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:55.560\nSo I'll launch my little new, wait,\nwhat was I talking about, new user.\n\n270\n00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:57.565\nWait, what was I talking about?\n\n271\n00:13:57.565 --> 00:14:00.370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I make a new user, Don Pezet, or\n\n272\n00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:01.100\nwhat have you.\n\n273\n00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.151\n>> Val Kilmer.\n\n274\n00:14:02.151 --> 00:14:02.778\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n275\n00:14:02.778 --> 00:14:06.262\nYou see this dialogue opens up and it's\nasking for me a first name, a last name,\n\n276\n00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:08.550\na log on name,\nit's gonna prompt me for a password.\n\n277\n00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:11.827\nWell, how does Active Directory\nknow what a new user is, and\n\n278\n00:14:11.827 --> 00:14:15.489\nthat it should have a first name,\nand a last name, and a password and\n\n279\n00:14:15.489 --> 00:14:18.970\nall those other attributes\nthat describe a user account?\n\n280\n00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:22.340\nIf we look at an existing user,\nlook at all these things.\n\n281\n00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:25.620\nStreet, PO, account information,\nprofile, telephones.\n\n282\n00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.200\nI mean, it goes on and on.\n\n283\n00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.660\nAll of these are attributes that I can\nfill in that describe that user object.\n\n284\n00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.280\nWell, the schema is the blueprints.\n\n285\n00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.390\nYou can think of the schema as\nthe blueprints for Active Directory.\n\n286\n00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:42.090\nThat's how it knows, when I right click\nnew user, it knows what a new user is.\n\n287\n00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:45.830\nIf I right click new group, it knows\nwhat a new group is because it looks at\n\n288\n00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:49.400\nthe schema and says, oh, a group needs\na name and this and this and this, right?\n\n289\n00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.190\nSo you can think of\nthe schema as the blueprints.\n\n290\n00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.775\nIf it's not in the schema,\nyou can't make an active directory.\n\n291\n00:14:54.775 --> 00:14:55.650\nRight?\n\n292\n00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:58.250\nYou can change the schema,\nyou can make modifications to it,\n\n293\n00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:00.310\nalthough it's not recommended,\n\n294\n00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:04.780\nit's only done usually programmatically\nby installing things like Exchange.\n\n295\n00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.046\nBut anyway, we'll save that for\nanother show.\n\n296\n00:15:07.046 --> 00:15:11.510\nAgain, it's the blueprints for\nActive Directory,\n\n297\n00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:15.370\nit defines all the objects that I\ncan create within Active Directory.\n\n298\n00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:18.060\nAnd the forest shares a common schema.\n\n299\n00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:21.443\nIn other words,\nthe blueprints they use in contoso.com,\n\n300\n00:15:21.443 --> 00:15:24.930\nit's the exact same set of\nblueprints they use in lab.net.\n\n301\n00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:28.250\nIt's the same set of blueprints\nthey use in au.lab.net,\n\n302\n00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.260\nand throughout the entire forest.\n\n303\n00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.570\nSo if I make a change to the schema,\nlet's say I want to add,\n\n304\n00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:35.650\nlet's say I did buy a shoe company,\nall right,\n\n305\n00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:40.780\nand I want to give all my users new, all\nmy employees, new shoes every Christmas.\n\n306\n00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.410\nWell, I wanna track their shoe size.\n\n307\n00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:46.940\nIf I look at the properties of a user\naccount, there is no shoe size attribute.\n\n308\n00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.860\nI could go to the schema, and\nI could add a shoe size attribute.\n\n309\n00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.420\nI could say, I'm going to add\nthis to what a user account is.\n\n310\n00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:55.635\nAnd then from on, I create new users and\nthere's a shoe size.\n\n311\n00:15:55.635 --> 00:15:57.386\nAnd I can fill it in, right?\n\n312\n00:15:57.386 --> 00:15:59.018\nBut when I did that,\n\n313\n00:15:59.018 --> 00:16:04.108\nevery user in this entire forest\nnow has a shoe size attribute.\n\n314\n00:16:04.108 --> 00:16:06.348\nIt didn't just do it in one domain.\n\n315\n00:16:06.348 --> 00:16:09.140\nThey all share the same set of blueprints.\n\n316\n00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:13.310\nAnd in order to make that change I need to\nbe an enterprise admin, because, again,\n\n317\n00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:16.650\nI'm affecting the forest,\nnot just one domain.\n\n318\n00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:20.810\nSo when we think about a forest,\nthink the common administration,\n\n319\n00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:26.270\nthey're all under that enterprise admin\ncontrol and they share a common schema.\n\n320\n00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:30.740\n>> Yeah, Mike when you talk about the\nschema it almost makes me think of the DNA\n\n321\n00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:31.810\nof the actual force.\n\n322\n00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:32.700\nHow is it made up?\n\n323\n00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.790\nHow can it react?\n\n324\n00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:37.530\nIf it's not within a DNA\nit's like able to do it\n\n325\n00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:41.930\nif you need to able to do it you need to\nadd to the DNA to make sure that it has\n\n326\n00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:47.290\na stabilities that you can manipulate\nthat as you need very very cool stuff\n\n327\n00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:50.048\n>> Exactly I love it it's fantastic\n\n328\n00:16:50.048 --> 00:16:53.655\n>> [CROSSTALK] absolutely.\n\n329\n00:16:53.655 --> 00:16:58.380\n>> All right so now we know what\na forest is, we've really seen a domain.\n\n330\n00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:02.160\nSo I guess the next thing\nwe want to talk about is\n\n331\n00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.980\nreally replication would be\na good place to go from here,\n\n332\n00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:09.660\nbecause we've kind of hinted\nat it a little bit already.\n\n333\n00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:14.110\nSo let's talk about the active\ndirectory database for a second.\n\n334\n00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:16.360\nWhen you, again,\nwhen you install the active directory,\n\n335\n00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:19.230\nyou get a copy of that\nactive directory database.\n\n336\n00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:20.150\nIt's a single file.\n\n337\n00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:21.005\nI showed it to you.\n\n338\n00:17:21.005 --> 00:17:23.330\nNtds.dit.\n\n339\n00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:26.830\nBut logically it's actually broken\nup into what we call partitions.\n\n340\n00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:29.090\nSo even though it's a single file,\n\n341\n00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:33.840\nthe database is broken up into these three\nby default, three different partitions.\n\n342\n00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.650\nThere's the schema partition,\nthe configuration partition, and\n\n343\n00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:39.270\nthe domain partition.\n\n344\n00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:44.120\nWithin the schema partition, that's where\nthe schema is stored those blueprints.\n\n345\n00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.350\nAnd again this replicates to all\nthe other domain controllers so\n\n346\n00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:49.790\nthey all have a copy of that schema.\n\n347\n00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:53.870\nThe configuration partition stores\ninformation about the forest itself.\n\n348\n00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:57.650\nThe domains that it exists, the domain\ncontrollers that exist within those\n\n349\n00:17:57.650 --> 00:18:02.120\ndomains, that's how it keeps track of what\nother domain controllers are out there and\n\n350\n00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.880\nreally who is gonna replicate\nwith things like that.\n\n351\n00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.680\nAnd then there's the domain partition\nthat the last one down here and\n\n352\n00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:12.510\nthat's where all my domain\nspecific objects are going to go.\n\n353\n00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:15.280\nLike users that I create and computers and\n\n354\n00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:20.020\nOUs and policy information and\nthings like that.\n\n355\n00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:24.850\nThe first two that I've colored green\nhere, those are forestwide partitions.\n\n356\n00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:29.110\nRemember the schema's a forest-wide thing,\nit applies to everything in the forest.\n\n357\n00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:32.169\nSo when I say it's\na forest-wide partition,\n\n358\n00:18:32.169 --> 00:18:37.100\nthis part of the Active Directory database\nreplicates to all the main controllers,\n\n359\n00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:41.220\nno matter what domain they're in\nbecause they all share the same schema.\n\n360\n00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.740\nSo they all get a copy of it.\n\n361\n00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.740\nOops, we're going the wrong way there.\n\n362\n00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:45.600\nWhere'd my drawing go?\n\n363\n00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:49.680\nSame page, different tab here.\n\n364\n00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:51.040\nSo again,\n\n365\n00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:55.040\nthat particular partition replicates\nto all these domain controllers,\n\n366\n00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:59.490\neven though they're in different domains,\nthey all get a copy of that schema.\n\n367\n00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:03.310\nSame thing with\nthe configuration partition.\n\n368\n00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:05.260\nThat's a forest wide partition.\n\n369\n00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.580\nIt replicates to all the main\ncontrollers in the forest.\n\n370\n00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:12.840\nThe domain partition, however,\nhas domain specific objects.\n\n371\n00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:17.530\nSo it only replicates to other domain\ncontrollers in the same domain.\n\n372\n00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:21.330\nSo I've got a little drawing here I\nthink that will make that more clear.\n\n373\n00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:25.620\nI've got domain A with blue,\nand I've got domain B in red.\n\n374\n00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:29.110\nAnd then I've got my forest-wide\ninformation in green, and so\n\n375\n00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:31.880\nthese four domain controllers\nare part of domain B.\n\n376\n00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:36.410\nThese four domain controllers\nare part of domain A.\n\n377\n00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:40.560\nAnd you see domain A replicates it's\ndomain partition just amongst itself.\n\n378\n00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:44.190\nDomain B doesn't need domain\nA's partition information.\n\n379\n00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:46.280\nIt doesn't care about domain A's user.\n\n380\n00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:49.180\nDomain B replicates its domain partition,\n\n381\n00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:52.910\njust amongst the domain\ncontrollers that make up Domain B.\n\n382\n00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:55.800\nBut those schema in\nthe configuration partition,\n\n383\n00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.530\nthey don't care what\ndomain you're part of.\n\n384\n00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.790\nThat replicates to all domain controllers.\n\n385\n00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:02.950\nSo that's the way that replication works.\n\n386\n00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:06.423\nAnd it's a weird concept, because you\nthink of it being a single file, yet\n\n387\n00:20:06.423 --> 00:20:08.863\npart of it replicates to\nthese domain controllers.\n\n388\n00:20:08.863 --> 00:20:12.438\nThe other part replicates the this\nare main controllers like,\n\n389\n00:20:12.438 --> 00:20:17.170\nhey that's the actually the way it works\nin the background behind the scene there.\n\n390\n00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:21.596\nNext thing, operation masters,\n\n391\n00:20:21.596 --> 00:20:27.550\nwe're talking about this guys when we\nwell, that's good we're leading this.\n\n392\n00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.840\nWhen we look in active directory,\n\n393\n00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:35.150\nactive directory uses what we\ncall multi-master replication.\n\n394\n00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:37.830\nWhat that means is all\ncopies are writable.\n\n395\n00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:41.050\nIf we go way back to\nWindows NT It wasn't that way.\n\n396\n00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:44.620\nBack when we first, first started\nwith domains and stuff, you had\n\n397\n00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:48.920\none writeable copy, and then a whole bunch\nof read only copies for fault tolerance.\n\n398\n00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:52.140\nWell, starting with Windows 2000,\nand again until 2008,\n\n399\n00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:54.920\nlike we have now, 2008 R2.\n\n400\n00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.750\nAll copies are writeable.\n\n401\n00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:58.570\nWe don't have that one writeable copy.\n\n402\n00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:03.050\nThat's what they mean by multi master,\nyou can go to anyone of those domain\n\n403\n00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:05.920\ncontrollers in your domain and\nmake a new object.\n\n404\n00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:06.840\nAnd as soon as you make it,\n\n405\n00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.000\nit will replicate to the other\ndomain controllers in your domain.\n\n406\n00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.760\nSo that's what they mean by multimaster.\n\n407\n00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:15.870\nThere are however somethings\nthat are not multimaster,\n\n408\n00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:19.040\neven though the majority of\nactive directory is multimaster,\n\n409\n00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.570\nthere's some things that\nare a little too sensitive for that.\n\n410\n00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:24.020\nAny time you do multi master like this,\n\n411\n00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:28.670\nif there's more than one writable copy,\nthere's a chance for conflict.\n\n412\n00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:35.273\nIf I go to domain controller one, and\nI change Ronnie's phone number to 5551212.\n\n413\n00:21:35.273 --> 00:21:38.861\nDaniel at the same time goes\nto domain controller 2 and\n\n414\n00:21:38.861 --> 00:21:42.145\nchanges Ronnie phone number to 5551313.\n\n415\n00:21:42.145 --> 00:21:44.950\nNow two different main controllers\nhave different information for\n\n416\n00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:46.470\nRonnie's phone number.\n\n417\n00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:47.390\nWhen they replicate,\n\n418\n00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:51.210\nwhen they go to share their information,\none of them's gonna lose.\n\n419\n00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:53.720\nI can't keep both changes, so\n\n420\n00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:57.140\nI've gotta keep one change,\nthrow the other change away.\n\n421\n00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:59.143\nActive Directory has ways\nof dealing with that.\n\n422\n00:21:59.143 --> 00:22:02.950\nThat's for another show.\n\n423\n00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:04.130\nThere are some things in active\ndirectory that are too sensitive.\n\n424\n00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:07.090\nI can't take a chance on their\nbeing a replication conflict and\n\n425\n00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:08.720\nlosing any information.\n\n426\n00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:13.890\nAnd that's where we get our flexible\nsingle master operations or FSMOs.\n\n427\n00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:15.547\nThese are special roles.\n\n428\n00:22:15.547 --> 00:22:18.660\nThey're really sub-roles\nof active directory\n\n429\n00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.220\nthat only exist on certain\ndomain controllers.\n\n430\n00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:26.270\nAnd for this exam, really I just want you\nto be familiar with what those roles are,\n\n431\n00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:31.460\nand kind of a high level overview of\nwhat they do, and where they exist.\n\n432\n00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.160\nThere's five of them.\n\n433\n00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:38.280\nThere's two forest-wide roles and\nthere's three domain-wide roles.\n\n434\n00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:43.716\nAnd I've got a little drawing that's\ngonna help us out with this over here.\n\n435\n00:22:43.716 --> 00:22:46.990\nNow the two forest-wide roles,\n\n436\n00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:50.480\nthere's the schema master and\nthe domain-naming master.\n\n437\n00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:55.020\nThe schema master, what you need to know,\nagain we're gonna stay high level here.\n\n438\n00:22:55.020 --> 00:23:00.480\nThe schema master is the only\nwritable copy of the schema.\n\n439\n00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:05.750\nEvery domain controller in the forest\nhas a copy of that schema partition.\n\n440\n00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:08.840\nThere's only one domain controller\nin the entire forest that\n\n441\n00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:12.790\nhas a writable copy of that partition,\nand that's the schema master.\n\n442\n00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:17.060\nI do not want to take a chance on somebody\nbeing able to make changes to the schema,\n\n443\n00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:20.520\nat two different places and\nthen having a replication conflict.\n\n444\n00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.780\nIt's too important for active directory.\n\n445\n00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:26.910\nThe schema to active directory is a lot\nlike the registry is to your computer.\n\n446\n00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:30.620\nWe know we can go in and make changes to\nit, but we better know what we're doing or\n\n447\n00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.600\nwe could end up hosing our machine.\n\n448\n00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:33.540\nThe schema's the same way.\n\n449\n00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:37.770\nYou can make changes to it, it's not\nlike it's gonna blow up if you do.\n\n450\n00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:40.670\nBut if you make bad changes,\nyou can hose everything up.\n\n451\n00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:43.340\nSo one writable copy of the schema master.\n\n452\n00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:46.170\nThe domain naming master,\nhe's got an easy job.\n\n453\n00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:49.880\nHe keeps track of all these\ndomains that exist within a force.\n\n454\n00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:55.550\nNow remember, that replicates to all\ndomain controllers in the force.\n\n455\n00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:59.790\nAnd there's only one guy that's in\ncharge of keeping track of that, and\n\n456\n00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:01.819\nthat's my domain naming master.\n\n457\n00:24:01.819 --> 00:24:05.162\nSo anytime you add a domain to the forest,\nyou have to check with\n\n458\n00:24:05.162 --> 00:24:08.900\nthe domain naming master to make\nsure that name isn't in use already.\n\n459\n00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.411\nIf two people,\nif two people were responsible,\n\n460\n00:24:11.411 --> 00:24:15.950\nif two different domain controllers\nwere in charge of keeping that list.\n\n461\n00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:22.800\nWhat if I made a new domain and\ncalled it west.lab.net and\n\n462\n00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.990\nthis guy knows about it, but\nhasn't told the other guy about it.\n\n463\n00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:27.110\nYou go to make a new domain,\n\n464\n00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:29.880\nyou call it west.lab.net and\nyou happen to talk to this guy.\n\n465\n00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.845\nHe doesn't know about it yet,\nhe allows you to make it,\n\n466\n00:24:31.845 --> 00:24:34.060\nnow you've got two domains\nwith the same name.\n\n467\n00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.500\nThat cannot happen.\n\n468\n00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:39.280\nSo one person is responsible for\nkeeping track of the domains that exist\n\n469\n00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:42.290\nwithin my forest and\nthat's the Domain Naming Master.\n\n470\n00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:44.360\nThen again, one of those per forest.\n\n471\n00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.520\nI don't care if you have\na thousand domain controllers,\n\n472\n00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:50.090\nthere's only one Domain Naming Master and\none schema master.\n\n473\n00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:54.130\nThen there's the three domain wide roles,\n\n474\n00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:58.639\nthere's the PDC Emulator, the\nInfrastructure Master and the RID Master.\n\n475\n00:24:58.639 --> 00:25:01.658\nThe PDC Emulator is responsible for\nseveral things.\n\n476\n00:25:01.658 --> 00:25:05.190\nWithout going too far,\nhe does password changes,\n\n477\n00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:08.530\nare all handled through the PDC Emulator.\n\n478\n00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:11.410\nIt's also responsible for\ntime synchronization.\n\n479\n00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:14.710\nTime is very important part of\nsecurity within a domain environment.\n\n480\n00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:15.220\nAnd so\n\n481\n00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:20.180\nwe pick one machine to sync everybody's\nclocks too, the PDC emulator is it.\n\n482\n00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.600\nHe also does it with password changes,\n\n483\n00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:26.800\ntime synchronization, he's also\nthe master browser list generator.\n\n484\n00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.354\nAnd it emulates a PDC, I forgot that one.\n\n485\n00:25:30.354 --> 00:25:32.244\n>> [LAUGH] The PDC emulator.\n\n486\n00:25:32.244 --> 00:25:35.240\n>> [LAUGH] Sorry,\na little brain cramp there.\n\n487\n00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.650\nAnother important job of his\nis to pretend he's a PDC.\n\n488\n00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:41.920\nRemember, I said back in the NT\ndays you had one writeable copy,\n\n489\n00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.600\nthe rest were all read-only.\n\n490\n00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.320\nThat one writeable copy was\na Primary Domain Controller.\n\n491\n00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:50.280\nSome applications are hard coded to\nlook for that one writeable copy,\n\n492\n00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.665\nbecause they know that's the only\nplace they can make a change.\n\n493\n00:25:52.665 --> 00:25:57.010\nWell, we don't have a PDC\nanymore in modern networks.\n\n494\n00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:58.760\nBut you might have some\napplication that says look,\n\n495\n00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:01.430\nthe only person I can talk\nto is the PDC emulator.\n\n496\n00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:04.140\nThat's the one I gotta talk\nto cuz he's writeable.\n\n497\n00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:07.520\nWell, since we don't have any anymore,\nthis guy says, oh yeah,\n\n498\n00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.380\nthat's me, wink wink, I'm the PDC, right?\n\n499\n00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:13.510\nSo he pretends he's a PDC for\nthe rest of the network.\n\n500\n00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:17.390\nThe infrastructure master has\na strange job, it's hard to describe.\n\n501\n00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:22.710\nHe keeps track of, he updates references\nto objects from other domains.\n\n502\n00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:28.190\nStrange, but\nbasically I can have a group in domain A.\n\n503\n00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:32.210\nAnd within that group,\nthere could be another group nested or\n\n504\n00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:35.040\nuser accounts from a separate domain,\nright?\n\n505\n00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:38.060\nWell, my domain controller looks in\nits Active Directory database and\n\n506\n00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:39.900\nhe's got no reference to those objects.\n\n507\n00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:43.100\nBecause they're in that domain\npartition in that other domain, so\n\n508\n00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:44.750\nif changes are made.\n\n509\n00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:47.510\nMy domain controller has\nno way of seeing that.\n\n510\n00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:51.480\nThe infrastructure master can keep track\nof those references to those objects and\n\n511\n00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.450\nother domain.\n\n512\n00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:57.070\nAnd update or keep track of those changes\nthat are occurring, one per domain.\n\n513\n00:26:57.070 --> 00:27:00.590\nThe RID Master generates\nthe relative identifiers.\n\n514\n00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:05.722\nThe relative identifiers are the unique\ncomponent of a security identifier.\n\n515\n00:27:05.722 --> 00:27:09.289\nIf you don't know what a security\nidentifier is, that's a unique number that\n\n516\n00:27:09.289 --> 00:27:12.320\ngets generated for every object\nwe create in Active Directory.\n\n517\n00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:15.360\nWell, every security principal\nin Active Directory.\n\n518\n00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:19.470\nIf more than one person was\ngenerating those unique numbers,\n\n519\n00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:21.150\nwe'd have a chance for duplication.\n\n520\n00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:24.310\nSo there's one person responsible for\ngenerating those numbers and\n\n521\n00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:26.383\nthat is your RID Master.\n\n522\n00:27:26.383 --> 00:27:29.215\nNow that domain-wide rules mean just that,\nright.\n\n523\n00:27:29.215 --> 00:27:33.930\nForest-wide meant one per forest,\ndomain-wide means means one per domain.\n\n524\n00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:38.064\nSo this second domain down here,\nit has its own PDC emulator for\n\n525\n00:27:38.064 --> 00:27:43.681\ntime synchronization, and PDC emulation,\nand browser lists and things like that.\n\n526\n00:27:43.681 --> 00:27:47.760\nHas its own infrastructure master for\nchecking references to foreign objects.\n\n527\n00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.980\nHas its own RID Master for\ngenerating those relative identifiers.\n\n528\n00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:54.830\nThis domain over here,\nhas its own PDC emulator,\n\n529\n00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:57.730\ninfrastructure master and RID Master.\n\n530\n00:27:57.730 --> 00:28:00.130\nBut notice they don't\nhave a schema master or\n\n531\n00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:05.270\na Domain Naming Master,\nbecause those two are forest-wide, right.\n\n532\n00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:08.110\nAnd that's probably good for\nnow, there's a ton more.\n\n533\n00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:11.552\nI mean I could talk about FSMOs for\nprobably another hour or two.\n\n534\n00:28:11.552 --> 00:28:12.320\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n535\n00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:16.944\n>> But since Daniel's eyes were glazing\nover, it means yours probably are too, so\n\n536\n00:28:16.944 --> 00:28:18.584\nwe'll stop there, right.\n\n537\n00:28:18.584 --> 00:28:23.017\n[LAUGH] All right, so we've talked about\ndomain controllers, we've talked about\n\n538\n00:28:23.017 --> 00:28:27.670\nforest, we're talked about domains,\nwe've talked about operation masters.\n\n539\n00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:31.890\nWhat else, we talked about contiguous\nnamespaces and child domains.\n\n540\n00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:35.110\nWe talked about namespaces,\n\n541\n00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:40.360\nwe need to talk about sites,\ntrusts and functional levels here.\n\n542\n00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:44.520\nSites, well,\nlet's go back to replication for a second.\n\n543\n00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.010\nWhen we talk about replication, right,\n\n544\n00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:51.170\nthat's how changes propagate from\none domain controller to another.\n\n545\n00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:53.337\nIf I make a change on\ndomain controller one,\n\n546\n00:28:53.337 --> 00:28:56.333\nthat change is gonna replicate\nover domain controller two.\n\n547\n00:28:56.333 --> 00:28:58.580\nLet's say I create a new user account,\nright?\n\n548\n00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:01.750\nWell, when you log on,\nif I've got two domain controllers,\n\n549\n00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:05.030\nI don't know which domain controller\nyour talking to when you go to log on.\n\n550\n00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:08.260\nIf I make your user account\non domain controller one,\n\n551\n00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:10.280\nwhat if you talked to\ndomain controller two?\n\n552\n00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:13.830\nHe needs to know about your user account\nas well, so that's what replication does.\n\n553\n00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:17.050\nIt replicates the data to\nthe different domain controllers.\n\n554\n00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:21.390\nAnd within a domain,\nreplication occurs quickly, all right.\n\n555\n00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:25.960\nIt's really within, oh gosh,\nlet me think about it,\n\n556\n00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:29.220\nit's no more than three hops,\nit's within five minutes.\n\n557\n00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:31.196\nNo, is that right?\n\n558\n00:29:31.196 --> 00:29:32.356\nYeah, five ten minutes,\n\n559\n00:29:32.356 --> 00:29:35.570\nthat change will be replicated\nthroughout your entire domain.\n\n560\n00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:37.740\nIt does not take long at all,\n\n561\n00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:40.440\nbecause as soon I make a change\non one domain controller.\n\n562\n00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.930\nHe's gonna notify his\nreplication partners say hey,\n\n563\n00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:45.650\nI've got a change that\nthese will be replicating.\n\n564\n00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:49.555\nHe's gonna call right back and say, let's\ngo ahead and replicate, all right, and\n\n565\n00:29:49.555 --> 00:29:50.490\nhe'll replicate.\n\n566\n00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:54.460\nAnd then he's gonna send it to his\nreplication partner, and so on and\n\n567\n00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:55.480\nso forth.\n\n568\n00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:58.720\nAnd so it replicates very quickly.\n\n569\n00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:03.590\nWell, we won't go into\nthe three hop rule just yet,\n\n570\n00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:05.040\nwe'll save that for another show.\n\n571\n00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.960\nSometimes though I don't\nneed that process to happen.\n\n572\n00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:12.440\nIn other words, I've got domain\ncontrollers here in Gainesville.\n\n573\n00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:15.930\nI've got another office in Pensacola and\nI've got domain controllers there.\n\n574\n00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:17.900\nAll part of the same domain, right?\n\n575\n00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:21.220\nBut I've got an office here, and\nI've got an office out in Pensacola.\n\n576\n00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:24.980\nSo when I make a change here, I got two or\nthree domain controllers here and\n\n577\n00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:27.120\nit replicates very quickly and\nthat's great.\n\n578\n00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:30.950\nBut what about replicating\nit over to Pensacola?\n\n579\n00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:32.960\nNow I'm going across this WAN link.\n\n580\n00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.753\nAnd that WAN link might be slow and\n\n581\n00:30:34.753 --> 00:30:38.034\nI've got users trying to access\nresources on the Internet.\n\n582\n00:30:38.034 --> 00:30:41.710\nI don't need Active Directory replication\nsucking up all the bandwidth.\n\n583\n00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:45.458\nReplicating every single change\nimmediately right over to Pensacola,\n\n584\n00:30:45.458 --> 00:30:46.000\nright?\n\n585\n00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.160\nSo we create what we call sites.\n\n586\n00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:55.665\nSites within Active Directory are way\nto really define physical boundaries.\n\n587\n00:30:55.665 --> 00:30:59.310\nCuz a domain is logical,\nI can have an office here and in Tokyo,\n\n588\n00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:01.037\nand it can all be part of the same domain,\nright?\n\n589\n00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:06.410\nBut my physical separation,\nhow do I define that in Active Directory?\n\n590\n00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:09.720\nWe create sites, I have a GNV site.\n\n591\n00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:14.970\nI have a Pensacola or\nNew York City site, all right.\n\n592\n00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:16.940\nAnd why do I do this?\n\n593\n00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:21.780\nBecause within a site,\nreplication occurs almost immediately.\n\n594\n00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:25.410\nBetween sites,\nI can control when it happens.\n\n595\n00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:27.270\nBy default it's every three hours.\n\n596\n00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:31.050\nI can slow that down, I can speed\nit up but it's under my control.\n\n597\n00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:34.020\nSo if I have limited bandwidth\nbetween Gainesville and New York.\n\n598\n00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:38.050\nI can say look, don't replicate in five\nminutes, let's give it an hour, right.\n\n599\n00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:42.250\nIf I'm making a new user account here,\nthe user's logging on here most likely,\n\n600\n00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:46.350\nI don't need that change to get up\nto New York immediately, right?\n\n601\n00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:52.170\nSo sites for now, what I want you to\nthink about sites is a way to define my\n\n602\n00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:59.900\nareas of my network that have high\nspeed reliable connectivity, all right.\n\n603\n00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:04.800\nThe other thing that sites do for me,\nis they allow me to localize services.\n\n604\n00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:09.920\nAs I said earlier, domain controllers\nhave all the same information,\n\n605\n00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.470\nthey all replicate with each other.\n\n606\n00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:14.520\nSo if I'm sitting here in the Gainesville\noffice and I go to log on,\n\n607\n00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:17.325\nI could talk to to either one of these\ndomain controllers in Gainesville.\n\n608\n00:32:17.325 --> 00:32:19.815\nI could also talk to either one of\nthese domain controllers in New York.\n\n609\n00:32:19.815 --> 00:32:22.665\nThey all know about my user account.\n\n610\n00:32:22.665 --> 00:32:25.605\nBut if I'm in Gainesville, wouldn't it\nmake more sense to talk to the domain\n\n611\n00:32:25.605 --> 00:32:28.690\ncontroller that's right here on\nthe same high speed network as me?\n\n612\n00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:33.010\nWhy wait for my log on traffic to make\nall the way to New York and come back.\n\n613\n00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:36.130\nWhen I've got a domain controller\non the network right next to me,\n\n614\n00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:37.855\nsites allow me to do that.\n\n615\n00:32:37.855 --> 00:32:38.980\nThose sites allow me to say,\n\n616\n00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:43.680\nwhen you log on log on with a domain\ncontroller in the same site as you.\n\n617\n00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:46.120\nThere's other services and things\nthat can take advantage of this, but\n\n618\n00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.010\nI know I'm getting the evil eye.\n\n619\n00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:53.866\nWe're running out of time and for\nthis exam, the main thing is we understand\n\n620\n00:32:53.866 --> 00:32:59.173\nthat sites are just a way to define\nthe portions of my network that have\n\n621\n00:32:59.173 --> 00:33:04.740\nhigh speed, reliable connectivity and\nto localize services.\n\n622\n00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:07.232\nAnd that I think Daniel,\ndid I get through most of it?\n\n623\n00:33:07.232 --> 00:33:09.149\n>> I think you got through\neverything my friend.\n\n624\n00:33:09.149 --> 00:33:10.760\n>> That was a lot of information, right?\n\n625\n00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:14.620\n>> It is definitely a lot of information,\nbut it shows you how important it is\n\n626\n00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:17.530\nto understand the Active Directory\ninfrastructure.\n\n627\n00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:21.720\nIt's not a small thing, it is a very\nlarge thing as a matter of fact.\n\n628\n00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:23.750\nThere's a lot of detail\nthat goes along with it.\n\n629\n00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:29.910\nBut the more you master that detail,\nthe better you'll do at controlling\n\n630\n00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:33.390\nthe Active Directory infrastructure,\nthe better set up it will be.\n\n631\n00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:35.040\nAll right Mikey,\nyou did a great job though.\n\n632\n00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:35.900\nWe thank you so much for\n\n633\n00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:40.100\nthose demonstrations, those explanations\nof the Active Directory infrastructure.\n\n634\n00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:41.950\nI guess we're gonna go ahead and\ncall it a day.\n\n635\n00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:45.550\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n636\n00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:46.260\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n637\n00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:47.823\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n638\n00:33:47.823 --> 00:33:54.230\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

to\nanother exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.040\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.190\nHere with me today is none\nanother than Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.045\nHow's it going today, Mikey?\n\n7\n00:00:22.045 --> 00:00:23.540\n>> Oh, it's going great, Daniel.\n\n8\n00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.450\nI am truly excited to be\nhere cuz we're doing our MTA\n\n9\n00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.950\nserver administration fundamentals.\n\n10\n00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.630\nAnd the topic we're gonna be looking\nat today is on my top five list,\n\n11\n00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:33.600\ngroup policy.\n\n12\n00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.340\nWe're gonna dive into the wonderful\nworld of group policy and\n\n13\n00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.430\ntake a look at how it works,\nhow we can use it to really implement,\n\n14\n00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.990\nwe call it\nCentralized Configuration Management.\n\n15\n00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.590\nAnd it's definitely one of my top five,\none my faves.\n\n16\n00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.181\n>> Oh, yeah,\n\n17\n00:00:49.181 --> 00:00:53.158\nit's something you gotta know about if\nyou're gonna be working with servers at\n\n18\n00:00:53.158 --> 00:00:57.096\nall because it's basically how we make\nminute little changes here and there.\n\n19\n00:00:57.096 --> 00:01:00.638\nAnd not just for one computer,\nbut for all our computers, or\n\n20\n00:01:00.638 --> 00:01:02.390\na subset of those computers.\n\n21\n00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.930\nWe have so many.\n\n22\n00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.590\nIt's very, very flexible.\n\n23\n00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.010\nSo it is why it becomes, like Mike said,\nit's part of his top five.\n\n24\n00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.020\nIt is for very good reason.\n\n25\n00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.840\nWe use it a lot because as administrators\nwe need that kind of control.\n\n26\n00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.650\nSometimes we need to use a scalpel.\n\n27\n00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.100\nSometimes we use a shotgun.\n\n28\n00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.892\nSometimes we use an A-bomb.\n\n29\n00:01:19.892 --> 00:01:24.510\nAnd the group policy is normally where\nwe pull that firearm out of our pocket.\n\n30\n00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.703\nSo, Mike, you're gonna help us out,\n\n31\n00:01:25.703 --> 00:01:27.305\nyou're gonna show us how\nto work with group policy.\n\n32\n00:01:27.305 --> 00:01:30.053\n>> If I can stop laughing after all that,\nthat was good.\n\n33\n00:01:30.053 --> 00:01:31.500\n[LAUGH]\n>> I have my moments.\n\n34\n00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.170\n>> Yeah it is very true.\n\n35\n00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.989\nAnd as Daniel said there so eloquently,\nwe have the ability to affect all\n\n36\n00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:42.970\nthe machines on the network or all\nthe users on the network, or a subset of.\n\n37\n00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.630\nMaybe just the computers in\nthe marketing department, or\n\n38\n00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.010\njust the users that work for the help\ndesk, or any combinations thereof.\n\n39\n00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.020\nWe can do some really cool things with it.\n\n40\n00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.420\nAnd without group policy,\nadministration would be a nightmare.\n\n41\n00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.433\nI mean, in a small shop where you've got\nfive, ten machines, sure, you might be\n\n42\n00:01:59.433 --> 00:02:03.408\nable to run around to each one of those\nmachines and configure a setting, right?\n\n43\n00:02:03.408 --> 00:02:08.115\nBut when you get up to 20, 100,\n1,000, 10,000 machines, right, and\n\n44\n00:02:08.115 --> 00:02:12.007\nthey're not all in your office,\nthey're spread around the country, or\n\n45\n00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:15.300\nspread around the world,\nthat doesn't make sense anymore.\n\n46\n00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.580\nWe used to call it the sneaker net.\n\n47\n00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.840\nRunning around from machine\nto machine to machine, and\n\n48\n00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.360\nyou end up wearing out your\ntennis shoes trying to do it.\n\n49\n00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.270\nAnd not only that,\nyou end up missing things, right?\n\n50\n00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.690\nIf the company policy says, all of our\nclient machines need to use a screen\n\n51\n00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.420\nsaver timeout of ten minutes, and\nit has to be password protected, well,\n\n52\n00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.080\nI could run around to every machine and\nconfigure that setting.\n\n53\n00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.100\nWhat if I missed that one machine\nover there in the corner, or\n\n54\n00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.700\nI don't go in to one of those offices?\n\n55\n00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.200\nNow I've got computers that\nare out of compliance.\n\n56\n00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.450\nThat's going to be a problem, right?\n\n57\n00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.100\nIf we get audited,\nthat could be big time trouble.\n\n58\n00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.670\nIt could be fines, and, granted,\nthat's a pretty mild example, but\n\n59\n00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.110\nif you're HIPAA compliant and one of those\nsettings isn't applied to a machine, that\n\n60\n00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.210\ncan end up costing your company money,\nit could even cost you a job, right?\n\n61\n00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.170\nSo, group policy makes it so easy for\n\n62\n00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.130\nus to apply changes from\na centralized location.\n\n63\n00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.890\nI sit here at my little laptop and\nI connect into my domain controller and\n\n64\n00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.300\nI make this change, and\nI could, within a few minutes,\n\n65\n00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.560\nmake a change that affects\nevery machine in the network.\n\n66\n00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.498\nAnd it's done, and it's that easy.\n\n67\n00:03:16.498 --> 00:03:19.843\nAnd so I love group policy,\nit's a fantastic thing.\n\n68\n00:03:19.843 --> 00:03:23.785\nHopefully, I can get you guys excited\nabout it as well, or at least\n\n69\n00:03:23.785 --> 00:03:27.175\ngive you enough information to pass the\nexam so that you can decide to get into\n\n70\n00:03:27.175 --> 00:03:30.722\nthis field and think that it is something\nthat you want to do for rest of your life.\n\n71\n00:03:30.722 --> 00:03:32.756\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] That sounds bad doesn't it?\n\n72\n00:03:32.756 --> 00:03:36.218\n>> Yes,\nit's like chain me to the radiator, Mike.\n\n73\n00:03:36.218 --> 00:03:37.110\n[LAUGH]\n>> No, it really is a good\n\n74\n00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.628\nthing, you know?\n\n75\n00:03:37.628 --> 00:03:39.218\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it is good.\n\n76\n00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:43.537\n>> All right, so we're gonna start by\ntalking about the group policy processing\n\n77\n00:03:43.537 --> 00:03:45.650\nand the way that it gets applied.\n\n78\n00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.662\nAlthough, that's what they start out with,\nthe objectives.\n\n79\n00:03:47.662 --> 00:03:50.100\nI'm gonna back up just a step\n\n80\n00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.211\nbecause I do think it makes it a little\nbit easier to understand how it's,\n\n81\n00:03:54.211 --> 00:03:57.800\nif you're talking about how something is\nprocessed, what are we talking about?\n\n82\n00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.735\nWhat is it, all right?\n\n83\n00:03:58.735 --> 00:04:02.029\nSo, we've kind of hinted at it and\njoked about it here,\n\n84\n00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:06.590\nbut basically a group policy object,\nor a GPO, is a container object.\n\n85\n00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.260\nAnd within that container are thousands,\nliterally thousands of settings\n\n86\n00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.200\nthat I can apply to either users or\nto computers.\n\n87\n00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.540\nAnd what I do is I go in there and\nI make my setting, right?\n\n88\n00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.940\nThe same settings you\nwould see on your machine.\n\n89\n00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.090\nLike the example I used,\nscreensaver time-out, right?\n\n90\n00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.620\nYou guys know, you can go to your desktop,\nright-click, pull up your properties for\n\n91\n00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.500\nyour display and\nyou can change your screensaver time-out,\n\n92\n00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.750\nhow long it takes before\nthe screensaver kicks in.\n\n93\n00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.450\nThe same settings that you would configure\non your machine are available in\n\n94\n00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:37.163\nthis policy.\n\n95\n00:04:37.163 --> 00:04:38.740\nAnd I can configure them.\n\n96\n00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.200\nI can login to my\nGroup Policy Management Console,\n\n97\n00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.460\nI can configure one of these policies,\nand, then we have to scope it.\n\n98\n00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.370\nWe have to decide who\nit's going to apply to.\n\n99\n00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.790\nLike I said, every computer in the domain,\njust the client machines,\n\n100\n00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.390\njust the servers, just the users in\nmarketing, whatever the case may be.\n\n101\n00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.470\nThat's called scoping a policy,\ndetermining who it's supposed to apply to.\n\n102\n00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.490\nAnd then Active Directory, in group policy\nhas its own built in mechanisms for\n\n103\n00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.070\napplying that change out to the systems,\nor\n\n104\n00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.310\nto the users out there on the network,\nright?\n\n105\n00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.410\nAnd that's what we're\ngoing to talk about today,\n\n106\n00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.840\nis that system,\nhow we go about applying these policies.\n\n107\n00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.580\nSo, later in this episode we'll take\na look at some of the settings that we can\n\n108\n00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.810\nconfigure, but primarily, like I said,\ntalking about the application mechanism,\n\n109\n00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.140\nmaking sure we understand how that works.\n\n110\n00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.510\nSo the first thing we're gonna need to\ntalk about they call out the processing\n\n111\n00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:31.140\norder.\n\n112\n00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.860\nSo, on my screen here I've got\na little diagram that I whipped up\n\n113\n00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.300\nthat kind of explains\nthis processing order.\n\n114\n00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.700\nThere's really four different\nplaces I can see group policy.\n\n115\n00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.670\nWell, three and a kind of a half.\n\n116\n00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.380\nI don't know, we'll call it a half.\n\n117\n00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.130\nThere is a local policy.\n\n118\n00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.097\nEvery Windows machine has a local policy.\n\n119\n00:05:51.097 --> 00:05:54.110\nThey don't really call it a group policy,\nit's called a local policy.\n\n120\n00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.820\nBut it's pretty much the same thing,\n\n121\n00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.160\nit's just local to that machine, rather\nthan being done in Active Directory.\n\n122\n00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.360\n>> That makes sense, Mike.\n\n123\n00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.610\nThere is no group at all,\njust a local machine.\n\n124\n00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:04.420\nIt's just itself,\n\n125\n00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.255\nso I could see where they went with\na different terminology there.\n\n126\n00:06:07.255 --> 00:06:08.850\n[LAUGH]\n>> So we'llleave that word out,\n\n127\n00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.650\nwe'll leave out the word group and\nwe'll just call it local policy, right?\n\n128\n00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.500\nAnd every machine has\none of these policies,\n\n129\n00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.930\nand it only applies to that machine.\n\n130\n00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.640\nJust like in other episodes,\nwe've talked about local users, and\n\n131\n00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.740\nthey only get access to the local machine,\n\n132\n00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.500\nlocal groups can only be given\npermissions on that local machine.\n\n133\n00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.600\nLocal policy only applies to that machine.\n\n134\n00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.710\nBut if you're in an environment where\nyou don't have a domain, right,\n\n135\n00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.260\na small worker, a little Soho,\nyou only got three or\n\n136\n00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:40.030\nfour client machines, then the local\npolicy might be the way you go.\n\n137\n00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.885\nYou have to do it on each machine\nindividually, but you can ensure those\n\n138\n00:06:43.885 --> 00:06:48.337\nsettings are applied to, say, all users\nthat log on to that machine, all right?\n\n139\n00:06:48.337 --> 00:06:50.090\nSo the local policy is still there.\n\n140\n00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.540\nEven in a domain environment,\nit does not go away.\n\n141\n00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.910\nAnd the local policy is applied first,\nall right?\n\n142\n00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.040\nSo that's the first thing.\n\n143\n00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:03.840\nAll the settings that are [COUGH]\nspecified in that local policy are gonna\n\n144\n00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.910\nbe applied to the system, or to the user,\ndepending on what type of setting it is.\n\n145\n00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.680\nOnce that's done, that computer's gonna\nquery Active Directory and say, hey,\n\n146\n00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.590\nI need to apply policy.\n\n147\n00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.420\nI need a list of all the policies\nthat I'm supposed to apply.\n\n148\n00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.480\nWhich policies apply to me?\n\n149\n00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.240\nAnd it's an ordered list\nbecause it's very important,\n\n150\n00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.810\nthe order that these policies\nare going to be applied in.\n\n151\n00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:30.790\nAfter the local policy is applied,\n\n152\n00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.360\nthen any policies linked to\nthe site will be applied.\n\n153\n00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.822\nNow, if you watched our other episodes\nyou remember that a site is a way we can\n\n154\n00:07:38.822 --> 00:07:41.919\ndefine the physical layout of our network,\nright?\n\n155\n00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:45.689\nI might have a domain that,\nI have an office in Gainesville and\n\n156\n00:07:45.689 --> 00:07:50.200\nI have an office in Jacksonville, but\nwe're all part of the same domain.\n\n157\n00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.459\nBut there's a slow WAN link between us,\nright?\n\n158\n00:07:53.459 --> 00:07:57.238\nSo I would have a Gainesville site,\none of my parts of my network,\n\n159\n00:07:57.238 --> 00:08:00.280\nthat has high speed reliable connectivity.\n\n160\n00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.290\nJacksonville is it's own site, because it\nhas good high speed connectivity between\n\n161\n00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:06.570\nthe machines there at that location.\n\n162\n00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.970\nBetween the two sites, not so\nhigh speed, not so reliable.\n\n163\n00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:10.570\nRight?\nSo\n\n164\n00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.790\nthat's a quick recap on what a site does.\n\n165\n00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:14.720\nIt does more than that, but\nthat's all we need for now.\n\n166\n00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.430\nI can link a policy to the site.\n\n167\n00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:22.860\nIf I wanna apply a setting to all\nthe computers that are in the Gainesville\n\n168\n00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.700\nlocation, I can link it to\nthe Gainesville site, and\n\n169\n00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.200\nthen it would apply to\nall those computers.\n\n170\n00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.680\nIt wouldn't affect the computers,\n\n171\n00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.720\nbetter over there in\nthe Jacksonville site, right?\n\n172\n00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.400\nSo it's a site linked policy, and\nthose policies are applied next.\n\n173\n00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:41.590\nThen, any policies linked to the domain\nitself are going to be applied.\n\n174\n00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.210\nSo if they're scoped to the entire domain,\n\n175\n00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:48.640\nthen policies linked to\nthe OU are gonna be applied.\n\n176\n00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.985\nAnd then, if there's any nested OUs,\nthose policies would come next.\n\n177\n00:08:52.985 --> 00:08:56.099\nAnd those are the only\nplaces we can link policies.\n\n178\n00:08:56.099 --> 00:08:58.986\nI cannot link a policy to a group.\n\n179\n00:08:58.986 --> 00:09:01.827\nI cannot link a policy to a user.\n\n180\n00:09:01.827 --> 00:09:06.737\nOnly to OUs, the domain sites, and\nthen of course there's that local policy,\n\n181\n00:09:06.737 --> 00:09:07.480\nall right.\n\n182\n00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:14.000\nAnd they're applied in that order, local\nsite domain, OU, and then nested OUs.\n\n183\n00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.910\nLSDO, just write that down, LSDO.\n\n184\n00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:20.410\nThat's how you're gonna remember\nthe order those policies are applied in.\n\n185\n00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.400\nAnd the reason I say it's so\n\n186\n00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.530\nimportant, because the order they're\napplied changes the outcome.\n\n187\n00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:30.070\nYou've gotta think of them, I've got\nthese little three pieces of paper here,\n\n188\n00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:32.100\nsupposed to represent policies.\n\n189\n00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.350\nAnd I wanted to show that they're kinda\nlayered, one on top of another, right.\n\n190\n00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:41.370\nWhen that first policy applies, like that\nlogo policy those settings are in effect.\n\n191\n00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:45.076\nThen the next layer of settings\ngets applied on top of that.\n\n192\n00:09:45.076 --> 00:09:49.430\nAnd if there's a policy\nthat's applied later,\n\n193\n00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:54.780\nwhat if my local policy specifies one\nsetting, but then that same setting is\n\n194\n00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:59.970\nalso configured in a policy linked at the\ndomain, but to a different value, right.\n\n195\n00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:04.700\nWell the last policy that applies,\nor as those layers get laid down,\n\n196\n00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.420\nthey can override those previous layers.\n\n197\n00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:09.980\nThat's why the order's important.\n\n198\n00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.740\nBecause if I change the order,\nthat could change the outcome.\n\n199\n00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:16.200\nThe end result of the settings that\nare being applied to that machine or\n\n200\n00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.450\nto that user.\n\n201\n00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.590\nNow, that end result has a name.\n\n202\n00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:23.620\nIt's known as the Resultant Set of Policy,\nor RSoP.\n\n203\n00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.810\nTypically they'll actually\nput a little o there.\n\n204\n00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:29.690\nI kind of made a typo there, but\nRSoP, Resultant Set of Policy.\n\n205\n00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:32.380\nLot of time when we're troubleshooting,\nthat's really what we're looking for.\n\n206\n00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:37.326\nWe wanna see what settings in the end,\nall things considered, all the different\n\n207\n00:10:37.326 --> 00:10:41.928\nlayers considered, what is the end\nresult of those settings, all right?\n\n208\n00:10:41.928 --> 00:10:45.648\nAnd let me just do a quick\nlittle example here.\n\n209\n00:10:45.648 --> 00:10:49.359\nLet's say at the domain\nlevel I set a screensaver,\n\n210\n00:10:49.359 --> 00:10:54.721\nlet's say at the local level I set\na screensaver timeout of 30 minutes.\n\n211\n00:10:54.721 --> 00:10:58.590\nAnd let's use some white here.\n\n212\n00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:03.402\nOkay, so we'll set that\nscreensaver timeout to 30 minutes.\n\n213\n00:11:03.402 --> 00:11:06.937\nAnd that's done at that local level.\n\n214\n00:11:06.937 --> 00:11:12.919\nAnd then we're going to do the same\nthing down here at the domain level,\n\n215\n00:11:12.919 --> 00:11:16.120\nbut it's gonna be set to ten minutes.\n\n216\n00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:24.690\nWell the end result is going to be,\ndrum roll please, very good.\n\n217\n00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:26.460\nIt's gonna be ten minutes.\n\n218\n00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:32.210\nBecause this is applied first, but then\nlater on through the application process,\n\n219\n00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:35.430\nthis ten minutes overrides\nthat 30 minutes.\n\n220\n00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:39.370\nAnd we end up in the end,\nwith a ten minute screensaver time out.\n\n221\n00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:45.440\nNow if I had a policy at\nthe OU level that was set to\n\n222\n00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.980\nfifteen minutes, well then that would\nend up overrideing the domain policy,\n\n223\n00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:55.190\nand I'd end up with a screen saver\ntime out of 15 minutes, all right?\n\n224\n00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:56.770\nSo hopefully that kind of clears that up.\n\n225\n00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:58.350\nAs each layer's applied,\n\n226\n00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:02.540\nit has a chance to override any\npreviously applied settings.\n\n227\n00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.830\nBut it's on a per setting basis.\n\n228\n00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:05.990\nIt's not the entire policy.\n\n229\n00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:08.950\nFor example,\nlet's say at the domain level,\n\n230\n00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:14.000\nI said to password protect\nthat screen saver.\n\n231\n00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:18.750\nBecause I wanna make sure that they\nhave to type in their password\n\n232\n00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:21.100\nwhen they wake that thing up.\n\n233\n00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:26.290\nWell this OU linked policy\noverrode this ten minutes.\n\n234\n00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:28.480\nSo does it override this as well?\n\n235\n00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.290\nAnd the answer would be no.\n\n236\n00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:36.930\nBecause, no policy applied after that one\n\n237\n00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:40.480\nsaid anything about whether or not we had\nto password protect the screen saver.\n\n238\n00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.980\nSo nothing changed it on the way down.\n\n239\n00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:46.730\nAnd that yes was able to make it all\nthe way through down to the bottom,\n\n240\n00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:48.560\nto our result and set up policies.\n\n241\n00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:53.020\nSo it's not that one policy completely\nwipes out any previously applied policies.\n\n242\n00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:54.920\nIt's on a per setting basis.\n\n243\n00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:59.050\nAnd the fact that the local policy\napplies first is a very good thing and\n\n244\n00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:00.300\nit's another important thing, right.\n\n245\n00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.460\nI said order's important.\n\n246\n00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:05.960\nI don't want, in a domain environment\nwe've got settings that we have to apply\n\n247\n00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.580\nto the machines to remain compliant.\n\n248\n00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:13.380\nLike a ten minute screen saver time out,\nor a 15 minute screen saver time out.\n\n249\n00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:14.220\nUsers don't like that.\n\n250\n00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.660\nThey don't want to have to wake up their\ncomputer every 15 minutes if they don't\n\n251\n00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:18.480\ntouch it, right?\n\n252\n00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.930\nSo they go to their machine, and\nmaybe they're an admin on their machine.\n\n253\n00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:24.450\nAnd they can modify their setting,\nchange their local policy,\n\n254\n00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:26.450\nand set it to 30 minutes or an hour.\n\n255\n00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:27.690\nThey're not gonna get away with it.\n\n256\n00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.890\nBecause my domain policy\napplies after the local policy,\n\n257\n00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:33.090\nit's not gonna affect the machine, right.\n\n258\n00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:36.120\nIt's gonna get overwritten\nby my domain based policy.\n\n259\n00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:40.644\nThe users aren't gonna be able\nto bypass your domain settings.\n\n260\n00:13:40.644 --> 00:13:44.026\nAnd when I say domain settings, I mean\nsettings linked at the site domain OU.\n\n261\n00:13:44.026 --> 00:13:48.316\nI should say corporate settings, right,\nare not gonna be overwritten by somebody\n\n262\n00:13:48.316 --> 00:13:52.130\nmaking changes to their local policy,\nand that's a good thing, right?\n\n263\n00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:53.400\n>> Yeah, definitely a good thing.\n\n264\n00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.680\nWe wanna maintain the control,\nbecause well that's what we do.\n\n265\n00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.720\nWe know what's best for\nusers on our network.\n\n266\n00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.432\nAnd we know the policies that we\nneed to adhere to, they don't and\n\n267\n00:14:03.432 --> 00:14:07.163\nI notice sometimes for them,\nit's a little bit of an annoyance.\n\n268\n00:14:07.163 --> 00:14:10.300\nBut you know what, other things annoy us\nas well, and we just have to deal with it.\n\n269\n00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.660\nThis is gonna have to be one of them for\nthem.\n\n270\n00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.920\nNow Mike,\nwe're talking about group policy here,\n\n271\n00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.890\nobviously there's mission control for\ngroup policy.\n\n272\n00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:18.100\nThe place that we go,\n\n273\n00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:21.520\nto set all these wonderful thousands\nof settings and make a change.\n\n274\n00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.450\n>> There is, but before we get there\nlet's talk about when these policies\n\n275\n00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:25.075\nget applied.\n\n276\n00:14:25.075 --> 00:14:28.470\nCuz I wanna make sure we're\nclear on that as well.\n\n277\n00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:32.320\nWhen your machine starts up\nThat's when it's going to go and\n\n278\n00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.780\nretrieve that order list of policies.\n\n279\n00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:39.600\nThis is before you ever get\nyour log on screen, right.\n\n280\n00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.950\nWhen you boot that machine up,\nit goes through its boot process.\n\n281\n00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:47.440\nAnd you might have seen it on days that\nthe network is slow or congested or\n\n282\n00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.850\nthe domain controller's chugging along,\nor what have you.\n\n283\n00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:51.790\nYou might see this,\nbefore you get to the log on screen,\n\n284\n00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:55.910\nit says applying computer settings, and\nyou've got a little spinning cheerio or\n\n285\n00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:59.680\nwhatever version of Windows you're\nrunning, you get their busy icon.\n\n286\n00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:00.770\nThat's what it's doing.\n\n287\n00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.660\nWhen it says applying computer settings,\nthat means it's talking to that domain\n\n288\n00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:07.380\ncontroller, and it's retrieving that list,\nthat ordered list, and\n\n289\n00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:10.890\nit's applying those policies one after\nthe other, configuring those settings.\n\n290\n00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:15.310\nAnd you don't get to log on until it's\nfinished that process, for the most part.\n\n291\n00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:19.030\nNow technically there are ways that can\nchange some of that behavior but, For\n\n292\n00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:24.040\nthis exam, and for us just know that,\nonce that finishes applying the policy,\n\n293\n00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.330\nthat's when you get your log on screen,\nright?\n\n294\n00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:28.970\nAnd let me back up one step from there.\n\n295\n00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:29.940\nWhen we look at a GPO,\n\n296\n00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:33.620\nwhich we're going to in a minute,\nthere's actually two halves to it.\n\n297\n00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.540\nThere's a computer half.\n\n298\n00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.080\nAnd then there's a user half.\n\n299\n00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.190\nThe computer half has settings\nthat apply to the computer.\n\n300\n00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:43.688\nThe user half has settings\nthat apply to a user.\n\n301\n00:15:43.688 --> 00:15:45.988\nWhen that computer's\nretrieving those policies,\n\n302\n00:15:45.988 --> 00:15:47.668\nhe cares nothing about the user half.\n\n303\n00:15:47.668 --> 00:15:51.190\nHe's saying hey, give me all\nthe policies that apply to me, and\n\n304\n00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:53.875\nI just need the computer\nhalf of those policies.\n\n305\n00:15:53.875 --> 00:15:54.750\nI'm a computer.\n\n306\n00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:55.334\nAll right?\n\n307\n00:15:55.334 --> 00:15:56.751\nDon't care about user settings.\n\n308\n00:15:56.751 --> 00:15:59.250\nIt's applying all the computer settings.\n\n309\n00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:05.860\nThen, when it finally finishes, then you\nget your log on dialogue box, you log on.\n\n310\n00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:09.980\nComputer goes back to Active Directory and\nsays, hey, Mike Rodrick is logging on.\n\n311\n00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.770\nWhat policies are supposed\nto apply to Mike?\n\n312\n00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:15.670\nAnd it looks at where my user\naccount is in active directory\n\n313\n00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:19.690\nto determine what OU I'm in, and\nit gets those site and those domain,\n\n314\n00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:22.760\nand those OU policies, and\nit sends those back to the machine.\n\n315\n00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.630\nAnd now I'm logging on.\n\n316\n00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:29.350\nAnd again, sometimes you get that busy\nsignal while this process is going.\n\n317\n00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:32.980\nSometimes it'll process some of the last\nones in the background and you'll actually\n\n318\n00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:37.230\nget your desktop but the user settings\nare applied when the user logs on.\n\n319\n00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:42.370\nSo to sum that up, computer settings\napplied when the computer starts up,\n\n320\n00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:45.420\nuser settings are applied\nwhen the user logs on.\n\n321\n00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:49.190\nBut it doesn't stop there, right,\nbecause what if I change a policy?\n\n322\n00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:51.220\nWhat if I create a new policy?\n\n323\n00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:55.440\nIf you never reboot the machine, your\nmachine would never get those new computer\n\n324\n00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.350\nsettings, right, because I said they\napply when the computer starts up.\n\n325\n00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:59.900\nIf you never log off,\n\n326\n00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:03.360\nthen you might not get those user\nsettings that I'm trying to apply.\n\n327\n00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:08.570\nSo to fix that, what happens is it\nrefreshes policy in the background.\n\n328\n00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:12.110\nThe default interval is 90 minutes,\nwith a random 30 minute offset,\n\n329\n00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:13.690\nso from 90 to 120 minutes.\n\n330\n00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:17.340\nAnd it's independent, so\nif the computer starts up at 8:00,\n\n331\n00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:21.780\nyou walk into the office, you turn your\ncomputer on, it's 8:00, it applies policy.\n\n332\n00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:25.535\n90 Minutes later, there, 9:30,\nsomewhere between 9:30 and\n\n333\n00:17:25.535 --> 00:17:28.990\n10:00, It's going to refresh\nthose computer settings, and\n\n334\n00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:34.410\nthen again in 90 to 120 minutes, so\nevery 90 to 120 minutes, refreshes those.\n\n335\n00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:38.470\nThen you turn the computer on,\nyou go down to the coffee machine,\n\n336\n00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:40.770\nstart talking about last night's game,\nor what have you.\n\n337\n00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:43.390\nYou don't actually log onto\nyour computer until 8:30.\n\n338\n00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:47.860\nWell, user settings replied when you log\non, and then they're gonna be refreshed\n\n339\n00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:51.140\nan hour and a half,\n90 minutes to 120 minutes after that.\n\n340\n00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:54.240\nSo it's an independent cycle,\nsame time period, but\n\n341\n00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.180\nthey're independent of each other.\n\n342\n00:17:56.180 --> 00:18:00.590\nYou can also refresh policy by using a,\nyou can force a refresh,\n\n343\n00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:01.950\nI guess I should say.\n\n344\n00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:06.090\nIf I've got a user that's logged on and\nI've made a new user setting, but\n\n345\n00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:09.570\nthey can't log off and log back on,\nmaybe they're doing something.\n\n346\n00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:10.990\nThey're in the middle of something.\n\n347\n00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:12.840\nWe can open up a command prompt and\n\n348\n00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:18.060\nrun a command called GP update,\nGroup Policy update, GP update.\n\n349\n00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:20.000\nAnd that will trigger the refresh cycle,\n\n350\n00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.030\nindependent of the 90 to 120 minutes\nthat it's normally refreshing.\n\n351\n00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:25.420\nAlright.\nSo that's important,\n\n352\n00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:29.760\nwe understand when these policies are\napplied because if we're troubleshooting\n\n353\n00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.470\nand a user calls us up and says, hey,\nI just got the message that everybody\n\n354\n00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:37.870\nshould have a mapped drive on their\ndesktop at this point, I don't have it.\n\n355\n00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:41.220\nWell have you logged off and logged\nback on recently, when did you log on,\n\n356\n00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.220\nthat kind of thing.\n\n357\n00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:46.895\nOr if I make a setting and I want to test\nit, I don't want to sit here and wait for\n\n358\n00:18:46.895 --> 00:18:49.040\n90 minutes to test that setting.\n\n359\n00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.910\nI can force it to go through the refresh\ncycle from the command prompt and\n\n360\n00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:54.830\nwe can also do it from\nactive directory as well.\n\n361\n00:18:55.872 --> 00:19:00.790\nAlright so, now we'll get back to Daniel's\nquestion here about command central.\n\n362\n00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:01.880\n>> Where do we do this?\n\n363\n00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:02.540\n>> Yeah, where do we?\n\n364\n00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.270\n>> You've talked up a great game,\nI've gotta see this.\n\n365\n00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:06.580\nI wanna see, where can I go and\n\n366\n00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.406\nstart making changes I got\npeople I gotta lock down.\n\n367\n00:19:09.406 --> 00:19:11.290\n[LAUGH] Let's do it,\nthey're getting the hammer.\n\n368\n00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:12.480\n>> They are.\n\n369\n00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.540\nAlright so let's do it, let's take a look,\n\n370\n00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:18.690\nI've got my domain controller up here I'm\nin server manager and what I'm gonna do is\n\n371\n00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:23.650\nI'm gonna go over to my start menu\nsince I'm on Windows 2008 R2,\n\n372\n00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:28.070\nadministrative tools and\nthen Group Policy Management.\n\n373\n00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:29.560\nThis is the console.\n\n374\n00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:34.580\nAlright, this is the one where I\nmanage all of my group policy.\n\n375\n00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:37.100\nAnd I'm gonna expand out my forest.\n\n376\n00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.555\nAnd I'm gonna expand out domains.\n\n377\n00:19:39.555 --> 00:19:42.535\nAnd then I'm gonna expand\nout my domain lab.net and\n\n378\n00:19:42.535 --> 00:19:48.185\nhere I can see the OU's that exist and\nI can work with my group policies here.\n\n379\n00:19:48.185 --> 00:19:49.825\nFirst thing I wanna do,\nI wanna show you something.\n\n380\n00:19:49.825 --> 00:19:54.820\nIf I open up Active Directory users and\ncomputers, and slide this guy over just\n\n381\n00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:59.520\na wee bit, you're gonna see a slight\ndifference in what I'm looking at, right.\n\n382\n00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.390\nNotice what's missing.\n\n383\n00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:05.540\nIn another episode we talked about\nhow I can not attach root policy,\n\n384\n00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:10.490\nI can't link policy, to those built in\ncontainers like built in computers,\n\n385\n00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:15.070\nforeign security principals, users, notice\nthose don't show up over here, right?\n\n386\n00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:16.310\nI can't link policy to them so\n\n387\n00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:19.980\nit's not even gonna bother showing them\nin the group policy management console.\n\n388\n00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.780\nBut in the OU's that I've created\nlike let's make a new OU.\n\n389\n00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:25.370\nLet's call it test.\n\n390\n00:20:27.045 --> 00:20:31.305\nAlright well that's an organizational\nunit not a built in container so\n\n391\n00:20:31.305 --> 00:20:34.345\nif I come over here and\nrefresh, there's test.\n\n392\n00:20:34.345 --> 00:20:36.715\nI can now link a GPO to that.\n\n393\n00:20:37.815 --> 00:20:40.665\nSo group policy management is where\nwe're gonna do all of this and\n\n394\n00:20:40.665 --> 00:20:42.265\nlet's take a look at a GPO.\n\n395\n00:20:42.265 --> 00:20:46.925\nAlright here's the default domain policy,\nthere's two policies that you get by\n\n396\n00:20:46.925 --> 00:20:50.670\ndefault when you install active directory\nthere's the default domain policy.\n\n397\n00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:52.590\nThat's linked to the domain it's self.\n\n398\n00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:55.326\nIn there I'm going to find\npassword settings,right,\n\n399\n00:20:55.326 --> 00:20:59.400\nprimarily passwords, settings,\nand account lockout settings.\n\n400\n00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.820\nNow all the settings are available, but\n\n401\n00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:06.710\nMicrosoft would recommend we just use\nthat one for our password settings.\n\n402\n00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:09.370\nIf we need other settings we\nshould really create our own GPO,\n\n403\n00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:10.900\nwhich I'll show you how to do in a minute.\n\n404\n00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.270\nBut the first thing I wanna point out\nis notice there's two different halves.\n\n405\n00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:17.300\nThere's the computer configuration, and\nthen there's the user configuration.\n\n406\n00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:18.550\nAnd under the computer half,\n\n407\n00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:22.340\nif I expand out policies I'll\nsee all kinds of settings.\n\n408\n00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:27.390\nI can expand out Windows settings and\nI've got my security settings over here.\n\n409\n00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:28.860\nI'll just start expanding some things out.\n\n410\n00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:30.750\nThere's all these different\nsecurity settings.\n\n411\n00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:36.200\nHere's my account policies,\nI've got my password policy, right.\n\n412\n00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:39.790\nAnd this is one that you should\nprobably be familiar with,\n\n413\n00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:43.940\nthe password policy you can see\nthings like enforce password history.\n\n414\n00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:46.510\nThis is the default settings that\ncomes with active directory,\n\n415\n00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:48.470\n24 passwords remembered.\n\n416\n00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:51.735\nPasswords has to be at\nleast 7 characters long.\n\n417\n00:21:51.735 --> 00:21:53.905\nIt has to be complex.\n\n418\n00:21:53.905 --> 00:21:55.585\nRight?\nThese are the settings that I'm\n\n419\n00:21:55.585 --> 00:21:58.115\npushing out to the machines on my network.\n\n420\n00:21:58.115 --> 00:22:01.193\nSince it scopes, since this one\nis linked to the domain itself,\n\n421\n00:22:01.193 --> 00:22:04.044\nthat means it applies to all\nmachines in the entire domain.\n\n422\n00:22:04.044 --> 00:22:08.670\nAll right, to change a setting\nyou simply double click on it.\n\n423\n00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:12.450\nAnd if I want the password to be\nten characters instead of seven,\n\n424\n00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:15.760\nI change that value to a ten and\nI click Okay.\n\n425\n00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.620\nAnd it's as easy as that.\n\n426\n00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.990\nI just modified this group policy, right.\n\n427\n00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:25.690\nIf I go back down a little further,\nI've got my administrative templates, and\n\n428\n00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:29.550\nunder the administrative templates is\nwhere you will find settings that apply\n\n429\n00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:30.850\nto the registry.\n\n430\n00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:33.710\nAnd just for giggles I want to show you,\nI'm going to click on All Settings.\n\n431\n00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:34.885\nThey're organized.\n\n432\n00:22:34.885 --> 00:22:37.230\nSo we can find them a little bit\neasier when we're looking for\n\n433\n00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:38.440\na particular setting.\n\n434\n00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.430\nBut you can go down to All Settings and\nsee everything and\n\n435\n00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:44.840\nthis is just the computer half,\n1757 settings.\n\n436\n00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:48.190\nIf I go down to the user half,\n\n437\n00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:53.630\npolicies administrative templates and all\nsettings, there's another 1551 settings.\n\n438\n00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:56.400\nThose are just\nthe administrative templates.\n\n439\n00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.310\nThat's not including the Windows\nsettings and things like that.\n\n440\n00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:03.530\nSo as I said thousands and\nthousands of settings, well over 4000.\n\n441\n00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:04.690\nBut don't worry.\n\n442\n00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:06.360\nYou don't have to memorize them all.\n\n443\n00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.622\nThey don't expect you to.\n\n444\n00:23:07.622 --> 00:23:08.830\nRight.\n\n445\n00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:13.580\nYou need to know how this works and how\nto configure these settings and really,\n\n446\n00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:16.400\nmore importantly,\nwhy we would use group policy.\n\n447\n00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:20.219\nAnd that is to apply changes to\nmultiple machines out there.\n\n448\n00:23:20.219 --> 00:23:21.390\nRight?\n\n449\n00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:22.260\nLet's do this.\n\n450\n00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.240\nI'm going to make a- I made\na change to that policy.\n\n451\n00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.890\nI'm going to close it.\n\n452\n00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:29.395\nShoot.\nI forgot to save it, just kidding.\n\n453\n00:23:29.395 --> 00:23:31.840\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well played, sir.\n\n454\n00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.650\nWell played.\n\n455\n00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:34.680\n>> I love doing that.\n\n456\n00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.260\nIt's more fun when I can see you\nguy's faces and you go, oh no,\n\n457\n00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:39.810\nI did all that work and\nyou forgot to tell me to save it.\n\n458\n00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:40.720\nYeah, don't worry.\n\n459\n00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.210\nWhen you make changes to policies\nthey're saved automatically.\n\n460\n00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:45.834\nThere is no file save or\nanything like that.\n\n461\n00:23:45.834 --> 00:23:46.891\nAll right, so\n\n462\n00:23:46.891 --> 00:23:52.540\nlet's say I've got a setting that I\nwant to apply to my file server, right.\n\n463\n00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:56.704\nI told you that if I link a policy to the\ndomain then it applies to all machines in\n\n464\n00:23:56.704 --> 00:23:57.417\nthe domain.\n\n465\n00:23:57.417 --> 00:24:01.043\nWhat if I've got a policy that\nonly applies to my file servers?\n\n466\n00:24:01.043 --> 00:24:03.090\nWell, I can come over here\nto the file server's OU.\n\n467\n00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:07.910\nRemember in another episode, we said we\nset these OUs up for a reason, right?\n\n468\n00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:12.210\nWe create them to delegate administrative\ncontrol and apply group policy.\n\n469\n00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:17.190\nBecause I've got all my file servers\nin an OU, I can easily apply a setting\n\n470\n00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:22.620\nto all my file servers by simply right\nclicking on that guy, creating a GPO,\n\n471\n00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:25.990\ngiving it a name, let's say,\nwe'll just call it test for this one.\n\n472\n00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:30.210\nAnd now I've got a group policy\nlinked to the file server's OU.\n\n473\n00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:37.660\nAnd I could go in there and edit it, if I\ncan right-click, and I can make a change.\n\n474\n00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:40.840\nLet's say I want to set the, what's\na good one to play around with here?\n\n475\n00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:46.780\nNow we're going to Control Panel,\nor maybe Network.\n\n476\n00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:47.850\nI don't know.\n\n477\n00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:50.650\nI'm trying to think of one that I would\nactually want to do to my file service and\n\n478\n00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:52.740\nI can't really think of anything to do.\n\n479\n00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:55.900\nBut I will do forward redirection maybe,\nand\n\n480\n00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:57.690\nyou see I'm just picking one from random.\n\n481\n00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:01.550\nThis wouldn't actually make sense,\nand I just choose enabled, and\n\n482\n00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:04.560\nI click okay, and I close that.\n\n483\n00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.780\nAnd now that particular setting will\nbe applied to all my file servers.\n\n484\n00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:12.300\nNot immediately, because if that\nfile server's already up and\n\n485\n00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:14.090\nrunning then it's gonna have to wait for\n\n486\n00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:18.510\nthe next refresh cycle, that 90 to 120\nminutes, before that setting kicks in.\n\n487\n00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:20.072\n>> Or you can just reboot it Mike.\n\n488\n00:25:20.072 --> 00:25:20.983\n[LAUGH] That's always fun.\n\n489\n00:25:20.983 --> 00:25:21.720\n>> Or I can just reboot it.\n\n490\n00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:22.590\nThat's always fun during production hours.\n\n491\n00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:23.331\nDon't do that.\n\n492\n00:25:23.331 --> 00:25:26.100\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, we don't really want to\n\n493\n00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:30.000\ndo that, right, not in the middle\nof production day, typically.\n\n494\n00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.240\nAll right, so since I don't want\nto wait that 90 to 120 minutes and\n\n495\n00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.530\nI can't reboot that server in the middle\nof the day, I'm gonna flip over to that\n\n496\n00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:41.800\nserver, open up a command prompt,\nand run a little GP update.\n\n497\n00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.570\nI do a forward slash force.\n\n498\n00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:46.720\nIt's a way to make sure all\npolicies are reapplied.\n\n499\n00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:50.860\nNormally during a refresh cycle of policy,\nif the policy hasn't changed\n\n500\n00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:54.130\nsince the last time it was applied,\nit doesn't apply it again.\n\n501\n00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:55.270\nThere's really no need to right?\n\n502\n00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:56.620\nNothing has changed.\n\n503\n00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:57.800\nI will tell you personally,\n\n504\n00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:02.200\nI've seen too many times if you just do\na GP update, the setting doesn't kick in.\n\n505\n00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.250\nSo I say a GP update force, and\n\n506\n00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:07.770\nthat says you know what I'm gonna reapply\nall policies whether they've changed or\n\n507\n00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:11.130\nnot and that ensures that\nthat policy is kicked in.\n\n508\n00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:14.710\nAnd there you go, you can see user\npolicy update completed successfully\n\n509\n00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:18.720\nas well as the computer policy\ncompleted successfully.\n\n510\n00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:19.470\nAll right, Daniel,\n\n511\n00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:22.242\nthe last think I want to talk about\nis those local policies again.\n\n512\n00:26:22.242 --> 00:26:26.050\nWe're gonna come full circle and go back\nto local policy because they did make\n\n513\n00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:30.350\na change to that starting in Windows 7,\nactually it might have been in Vista, but\n\n514\n00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:33.150\nwe don't really count Vista, right?\n\n515\n00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:37.240\n>> Well, it was the,\nit wasn't a good operating system,\n\n516\n00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:41.260\nnot a lot of people enjoyed that one,\nso seven came out quite quickly.\n\n517\n00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:42.460\n>> It did.\n\n518\n00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.870\nit did.\nSo starting with Windows 7,\n\n519\n00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:48.490\nwe have more than one local policy now.\n\n520\n00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:51.440\nRemember I said every Windows\nmachine has a local policy.\n\n521\n00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:56.020\nAnd that local policy is very similar\nto what we just saw in a domain\n\n522\n00:26:56.020 --> 00:27:00.380\nenvironment where it's got user settings\nand it has computer settings in it.\n\n523\n00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:02.450\nAll right?\nThat's the one we've always had.\n\n524\n00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:06.160\nBut they added three new local policies.\n\n525\n00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:09.110\nThere's an administrator local policy.\n\n526\n00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:15.090\nThere's a non-administrator local policy,\nand there's a user specific local policy.\n\n527\n00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:17.590\nAnd in these three,\nthere are only user settings.\n\n528\n00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:19.079\nI mean you can kinda tell by the name,\n\n529\n00:27:19.079 --> 00:27:21.112\nthey're geared towards user accounts,\nright?\n\n530\n00:27:21.112 --> 00:27:25.200\nSo there's no computer settings\nin these three new policies.\n\n531\n00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.030\nThe administrator policy will be in effect\n\n532\n00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:32.090\nif you log on with an account that's\nin the local administrator's group.\n\n533\n00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:35.960\nThe non-administrators policy would be\nin effect if you log on with an account\n\n534\n00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:38.835\nthat's not in the local\nadministrator's group.\n\n535\n00:27:38.835 --> 00:27:43.495\nThe users specific policy would only\nbe applied if it was for you, right?\n\n536\n00:27:43.495 --> 00:27:47.785\nSo I can make a policy and make sure\nthat that one user gets a particular\n\n537\n00:27:47.785 --> 00:27:50.750\nsetting and that's something\nthat's really kind of cool.\n\n538\n00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:52.038\nWeren't able to do that before.\n\n539\n00:27:52.038 --> 00:27:56.840\nNow all four of these\npolicies won't apply.\n\n540\n00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.360\nThe local policy is always in effect,\nright?\n\n541\n00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.340\nIt's the first policy that gets applied.\n\n542\n00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:04.840\nAnd then either the administrator or\nthe non-administrator.\n\n543\n00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:08.900\nYou cannot log in with an account that's\nboth in the local admins group but\n\n544\n00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:11.750\nat the same time not in\nthe local admins group, right?\n\n545\n00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:14.910\nSo, it just makes sense that\nonly one of those two policies\n\n546\n00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:16.650\nis going to be in effect.\n\n547\n00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:20.180\nAnd then this one will only be in\neffect if there's a policy for you.\n\n548\n00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:22.760\nThere could be a user specific policy for\nDaniel, and\n\n549\n00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:25.620\nwhen he logs onto that machine,\nthat setting kicks in.\n\n550\n00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:29.090\nBut when I log on, I'm not Daniel,\nso that setting doesn't kick in.\n\n551\n00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:32.950\nThe other thing I want to make sure we're\naware of is to create a user specific\n\n552\n00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:33.760\npolicy.\n\n553\n00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:37.400\nThe user has to have logged on\nto that machine at least once.\n\n554\n00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:41.379\nIn other words, it looks at the profile,\nthat list of profiles within users,\n\n555\n00:28:41.379 --> 00:28:45.800\nand it says, okay, you can make a specific\npolicy for any one of these people.\n\n556\n00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:48.220\nIf they've never logged\nonto the machine before,\n\n557\n00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:50.450\nthey don't have a profile on that machine,\n\n558\n00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:55.460\ntheir name won't show up in the list when\nyou go to create a user specific policy.\n\n559\n00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:57.240\nAnd this is the processing order.\n\n560\n00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:02.650\nSo if we think back to my processing\norder here, local, site, domain, OU.\n\n561\n00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:07.310\nIf we said local was first, one, and then\nsite was two, and then domain was third,\n\n562\n00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:12.460\nand then OU was fourth, well now we've\ngot to kind of look at it like well local\n\n563\n00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:17.630\npolicy is one, administrator or\nnon-administrator is like one A, user\n\n564\n00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:23.330\nspecific might be one B, and then back\nto site, and then domain, and then OU.\n\n565\n00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:24.300\nRight?\n\n566\n00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:29.070\nSo, it's really local, and then\nadministrators and non-administrators, and\n\n567\n00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:34.300\nthen users specific if there is one, and\nthen site, and then domain, and then OU.\n\n568\n00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.875\nBut the acronym doesn't work out\nnearly as well when you do all that.\n\n569\n00:29:36.875 --> 00:29:38.592\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you just called it LSDO, and\n\n570\n00:29:38.592 --> 00:29:41.157\nthen we threw all this over here to say,\noh by the way,\n\n571\n00:29:41.157 --> 00:29:44.220\nyou have more than one local\npolicy that you have to deal with.\n\n572\n00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:45.960\nAnd important that we\nunderstand that order as well,\n\n573\n00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:50.210\nbecause if we change the order,\nwe change the outcome of the policy.\n\n574\n00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:51.950\nRight, remember what I was showing you.\n\n575\n00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:56.570\nIf we applied this one,\nif I could switch, if I apply the OU\n\n576\n00:29:56.570 --> 00:30:01.480\npolicy first, that sets screen saver\nto 15, domain policy is second,\n\n577\n00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:05.240\nand then that would be ten, so\nthis would change the outcome, right?\n\n578\n00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.798\nSo they order these policies are applied,\nvery, very important.\n\n579\n00:30:08.798 --> 00:30:13.060\nAnd that, Daniel, I think is the basics\nof group policy in a nutshell.\n\n580\n00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:17.450\n>> Well Mikey, thank you so much for those\ngreat explanations and demonstrations.\n\n581\n00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:20.180\nHopefully our viewers our\nthere are getting a good idea\n\n582\n00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.850\nof what it means to work\nwith group policies.\n\n583\n00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:23.270\nNot really that difficult.\n\n584\n00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:26.240\nThere's a lot that are in there,\nall the settings and stuff so\n\n585\n00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:30.270\nyou can spend half a lifetime\ngoing through each one of them but\n\n586\n00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:33.920\nthe basics of it, just linking a group\npolicy obviously creating a GPO,\n\n587\n00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:38.090\nlink it to where you need to, and then\nmaking sure that order, that its being\n\n588\n00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:41.960\napplied is in the correct one so that you\nget the outcome that you're looking for.\n\n589\n00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.100\nThanks a lot again, Mike.\n\n590\n00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.780\nYou-\n>> And like I said, like Daniel said,\n\n591\n00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:46.200\nwe've really just scratched the surface.\n\n592\n00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.440\nThat is the basics of it.\n\n593\n00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.460\nThere is a ton more we can learn,\n\n594\n00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:54.490\nbut for now, we understand that\nthe basic processing of those GPOs.\n\n595\n00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:55.310\n>> That's right.\n\n596\n00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:56.130\nAll right, everyone.\n\n597\n00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:57.380\nI hope you enjoyed this episode.\n\n598\n00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:59.420\nWe're gonna go go ahead and\ncall it a day thanks for\n\n599\n00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:02.173\nwatching I've been your host Daniel Lowrey\n>> And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n600\n00:31:02.173 --> 00:31:04.315\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n601\n00:31:04.315 --> 00:31:10.810\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.176 --> 00:00:18.021\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n4\n00:00:18.021 --> 00:00:20.861\nJoining me today is none other than Mr.\nMike Roderick.\n\n5\n00:00:20.861 --> 00:00:22.310\nHow's it going today, Mike?\n\n6\n00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.680\n>> It's another day in\nparadise here at ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.137\nWe're doing out MTA content,\nour server fundamentals.\n\n8\n00:00:28.137 --> 00:00:31.929\nAnd in this one, we're gonna be\nlooking at storage technologies,\n\n9\n00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:34.332\na very important part of our environment.\n\n10\n00:00:34.332 --> 00:00:35.658\nWe have lots of data,\n\n11\n00:00:35.658 --> 00:00:40.156\nwe have lots of information that we\nneed to make sure it's safe, sound,\n\n12\n00:00:40.156 --> 00:00:45.050\naccessible, protected from unwanted\nmodifications, all that good stuff.\n\n13\n00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.280\nBut in this episode,\n\n14\n00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.910\nwe're really going to focus on\nthe technologies that we have available.\n\n15\n00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.670\nThere's several different\nones that we can choose from.\n\n16\n00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.150\nEach one has advantages and\ndisadvantages, and\n\n17\n00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.040\nmost likely you'll end up using a\ncombination of these in your environment.\n\n18\n00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.720\n>> That's right, in today's age you\nneed some of these high powered storage\n\n19\n00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.582\nsolutions to be able to adapt for things\nlike virtualization or large databases.\n\n20\n00:01:10.582 --> 00:01:13.940\nYou gotta remember, in a corporate\nenvironment, there is tons and\n\n21\n00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.070\ntons of data.\n\n22\n00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.402\nI've worked in a corporate environment\nmyself where we've had 90s and\n\n23\n00:01:20.402 --> 00:01:25.226\n100s of terabytes,\nI don't know if 100s is a real word, but\n\n24\n00:01:25.226 --> 00:01:25.771\n>> [LAUGH] Lots of [CROSSTALK]\n\n25\n00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:28.221\n>> Lots of terabytes of data.\n\n26\n00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:29.020\n>> Plethora.\n\n27\n00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.790\n>> That's right, there you go, a myriad,\nas it were, a cornucopia of data,\n\n28\n00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.260\nthere's gonna be a lot of it,\nthat's basically what we're talking about.\n\n29\n00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.240\nAnd these storage solutions help us with\nthat, because they give us high speed and\n\n30\n00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.570\nhigh volume, and\nthat's what we're looking for.\n\n31\n00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.820\nAnd Mike, you're gonna show\nus these cool technologies,\n\n32\n00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.900\nhow we can work with them, and again,\nwhat's the disadvantages, advantages,\n\n33\n00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.160\npros and cons kind of thing, right?\n\n34\n00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.263\n>> And that's the big for this exam.\n\n35\n00:01:51.263 --> 00:01:53.574\nWe're gonna take a look\nat a couple of them.\n\n36\n00:01:53.574 --> 00:01:55.652\nI'm even gonna show you how to set up one,\nbut\n\n37\n00:01:55.652 --> 00:01:59.490\nI don't want you to dive too deep into\nit as you're studying for this exam.\n\n38\n00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.950\nBe familiar with the technologies that\nare available, what the advantages are,\n\n39\n00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.050\nwhat the disadvantages are.\n\n40\n00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.120\nBecause you're going to need to pick\nthe appropriate one for the solution for\n\n41\n00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.660\nthe problem that they\ngive you on the exam.\n\n42\n00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.830\nThey're not going to actually make\nyou configure host bus adaptors and\n\n43\n00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.750\nfiber channels and all that good stuff.\n\n44\n00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.460\nSo let's talk about it.\n\n45\n00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.740\nLet's start with local.\n\n46\n00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.250\nRight, we know we've got to have local\nstorage and a few years ago I would have\n\n47\n00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.160\nsaid you've got to have a local storage\nto install your operating system on.\n\n48\n00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.630\nThat's really not the case anymore,\nbut that's another story.\n\n49\n00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.977\nOur PCs that we sit at,\nwe've got local storage.\n\n50\n00:02:31.977 --> 00:02:36.531\nOur servers that sit on our racks,\nthey typically have local storage, and\n\n51\n00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:41.085\nwhat I mean by local storage is it's\nphysically attached to that machine,\n\n52\n00:02:41.085 --> 00:02:44.000\ntypically internally, inside that machine.\n\n53\n00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.050\nYou crack open your case,\nyou've got hard drives in there.\n\n54\n00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.320\nThey might be mechanical, solid state,\nthere's different technologies we can use,\n\n55\n00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.170\nand If we go back,\nif we travel back in time a little bit,\n\n56\n00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.340\nIDE was a very common way to connect\nthese hard drives to our systems.\n\n57\n00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.131\nGosh, I don't even remember, Dan do you\nremember off hand what IDE stands for?\n\n58\n00:03:04.131 --> 00:03:05.188\n>> IDE?\n\n59\n00:03:05.188 --> 00:03:10.996\nOh, integrated [CROSSTALK] adapter, I\ndon't even remember, it's been that long.\n\n60\n00:03:10.996 --> 00:03:12.144\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n61\n00:03:12.144 --> 00:03:14.370\nAnd you don't have to worry about it,\njust know IDE.\n\n62\n00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.760\nAnd somebody out there in the chat room,\nhelp me out, tell me what IDE stands for.\n\n63\n00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.916\nBut this is what we used to use,\nused a parallel technology.\n\n64\n00:03:21.916 --> 00:03:26.874\nIf you remember those old ribbon cables\nthat you would see inside your machine,\n\n65\n00:03:26.874 --> 00:03:30.925\nthis is how you connect those\nhard drives to your motherboard.\n\n66\n00:03:30.925 --> 00:03:33.430\nYou'd have, typically, two controllers.\n\n67\n00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.441\nEach IDE channel could then have\ntwo devices connected to it.\n\n68\n00:03:37.441 --> 00:03:40.889\nSo you could have a total of\nfour IDE devices in there.\n\n69\n00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:46.514\nYour hard drive would typically take one,\nif you had a DVD, CD-ROM drive in there,\n\n70\n00:03:46.514 --> 00:03:52.160\nthat would connect to one, but you could\nadd additionals, up to four, typically.\n\n71\n00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.882\nOlder technology, a little bit slower than\nother technologies that we have today.\n\n72\n00:03:57.882 --> 00:04:02.818\nOnce we got past that IDE,\nthe next evolution was serial ATA.\n\n73\n00:04:02.818 --> 00:04:07.690\nIDE you can also here call parallel ATA.\n\n74\n00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.290\nSerial ATA was the next evolution and\nit's almost like we went\n\n75\n00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.340\nbackwards to go forwards, because serial\nis when we send one bit at a time.\n\n76\n00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.440\nSo, you can imagine like a train of bits,\nright?\n\n77\n00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.430\nOne after the other, just streaming.\n\n78\n00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.550\nWe went to parallel, and\nwe all of a sudden had many more lanes.\n\n79\n00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.020\nInstead of just one lane for\nthat data to go down, we had many lanes.\n\n80\n00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.900\nAnd we could send eight bits at a time,\n\n81\n00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.990\nif it was an eight bit bus or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n82\n00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.880\nThen we went back to serial.\n\n83\n00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.730\nIt actually becomes, once these computers\nhit a certain speed and we were sending so\n\n84\n00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.470\nmuch data down these that serial became a\nlittle more efficient than parallel, a lot\n\n85\n00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.390\nto do with the traces on the motherboard,\nthe distances, and the crosstalk.\n\n86\n00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.580\nThe interference we could\nget between those wires and\n\n87\n00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.460\nthose parallel type connections.\n\n88\n00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.070\nSo serial ATA is really one of the most\n\n89\n00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.120\ncommon ones we see nowadays in\nmost of your personal PCs, right?\n\n90\n00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.450\nYou crack your case open at home, and\nyou've probably got a serial connection or\n\n91\n00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.480\na serial ATA connection inside there.\n\n92\n00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:17.220\nAnother option would be SCSI,\nsmall computer systems interface.\n\n93\n00:05:18.275 --> 00:05:20.180\nSCSI is much more fun to say.\n\n94\n00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.210\nThis is not typically found\nin your workstations, though.\n\n95\n00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.560\nI don't know, David out there in the chat\nroom I think told me that some of\n\n96\n00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.680\nthe older IBMs actually\ncame with some scuzzy,\n\n97\n00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.990\nsome high end workstations might have\nSCSI, because a little better performance\n\n98\n00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.790\nout of those SCSI drives, a little bit\nmore difficult to configure, though.\n\n99\n00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.250\nThere's a little more to it\nbecause you can only have so\n\n100\n00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.000\nmany SCSI devices on a bus and\neach one has to have an identifier.\n\n101\n00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.270\nAgain, not something you typically\nsee inside a home machine unless\n\n102\n00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.020\nit's a high end work station of some kind.\n\n103\n00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.130\nServers, it's almost always going\nto be SCSI or serial, depending\n\n104\n00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.930\non the level of server that you have in\nthere as far as their internal drives.\n\n105\n00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.470\nBut that's all local search, and\n\n106\n00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.270\nwe need that, but, as we move\ninto that enterprise environment,\n\n107\n00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.170\nwe start finding a need for\ncentralized storage, for\n\n108\n00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:20.580\na way that I can have storage that's\naccessible to more than one machine.\n\n109\n00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.550\nNow with our local storage we\ncan share things out, right?\n\n110\n00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:28.310\nI can create a folder and I can share it\nout with a network, on a file server.\n\n111\n00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.940\nI can create a shared folder.\n\n112\n00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.470\nPeople can reach out and connect to\nthat share, and they can save files or\n\n113\n00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:35.860\nwhatever they need to do.\n\n114\n00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.920\nBut it's a little bit limited,\nand the next evolution for\n\n115\n00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:48.730\ncentralized storage would be something\ncalled NAS, or network attached storage.\n\n116\n00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:53.320\nAnd I've got a drawing here somewhere if\nI can find it, if we can pull that up\n\n117\n00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.078\non my screen, and this is an example\nof network attached storage.\n\n118\n00:06:57.078 --> 00:07:00.120\nNetwork attached storage,\nthat would be this green guy over here,\n\n119\n00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:05.272\nis storage that's attached to the network,\ncrazy the way that works, right?\n\n120\n00:07:05.272 --> 00:07:06.520\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n121\n00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.710\n>> All right, but it is.\n\n122\n00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:11.250\nIt looks like any other\nnode on the network,\n\n123\n00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:17.150\nlike an example might be\na Buffalo TeraStation or a Drobo.\n\n124\n00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.920\nSeveral different brands of never detached\nstorage out there that you can find.\n\n125\n00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.158\nYou can get an enclosure and\nyou slap drives inside that enclosure and\n\n126\n00:07:25.158 --> 00:07:29.060\nthen that enclosure has\na network adaptor built into it.\n\n127\n00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.410\nYou plug it into your network,\n\n128\n00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:34.520\nthey typically have a web interface that\nwe can use to configure them, and then\n\n129\n00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:39.490\nanybody else on the network can go across\nthe network and connect to that storage.\n\n130\n00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.920\nFor a home, this is what I use,\nlike this is to share media amongst all\n\n131\n00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:51.120\nthe different devices in my home network,\nin a SOHO network attached\n\n132\n00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:57.020\nstorage is a relatively inexpensive\nsolution for shared storage.\n\n133\n00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.980\nThere are some downsides to this though,\nall right?\n\n134\n00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.861\nAnd let me go back up\nto the local storage.\n\n135\n00:08:01.861 --> 00:08:04.557\nThe serial ATA, the IDE, that SCSI,\n\n136\n00:08:04.557 --> 00:08:08.106\nI didn't talk about some\nof the down sides there.\n\n137\n00:08:08.106 --> 00:08:12.550\nBiggest downside of that technology ,is\nthat it's attached to a single machine.\n\n138\n00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.770\nAnd if that machine fails\nI lose access to that.\n\n139\n00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.140\nI've got that file server,\n\n140\n00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.870\neverybody's dumping their stuff\nup on that file server, or\n\n141\n00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:24.150\nI've done folder redirection, so their\nMy Documents is up on that file server.\n\n142\n00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:28.500\nThat's great, until that file server's not\navailable, and now I can't connect to it.\n\n143\n00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.920\nSo my storage is tied to\nthat physical device, and\n\n144\n00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.580\nif that device fails,\nwe lose all that storage.\n\n145\n00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.470\nWhere as never catch storage is not\nattached directly to a machine.\n\n146\n00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.200\nRight?\nIt's attached to the network itself.\n\n147\n00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.010\nSo now it's independent of my servers or\nwhatever.\n\n148\n00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:47.830\nIt exists on its own on the network.\n\n149\n00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:49.370\nDownside of network cache stores,\n\n150\n00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:54.200\nthough, is access speeds,\nis what it comes down to.\n\n151\n00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.920\nIn a home office, a small office\nwhere you've got four or five,\n\n152\n00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.230\nten users, not too bad.\n\n153\n00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:01.310\nBut if you get 10, 20, 50,\n\n154\n00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:06.300\n100 people trying to connect to that\nnetwork attached storage concurrently.\n\n155\n00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.750\nYou're going to see that thing just choke.\n\n156\n00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:12.510\nIt typically is not going to be\nable to handle that type of access\n\n157\n00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.570\nin the network itself\nthat it's attached to.\n\n158\n00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.680\nIt's attached to the same\nnetwork you guys are, so\n\n159\n00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.360\nit's limited if you've got gigabit,\nethernet, 100 megabit ethernet or\n\n160\n00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.760\nwhatever the case may be It's\ngonna be limited by that as well.\n\n161\n00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.640\nAnd TCP/IP has some overhead\ninvolved with, all right.\n\n162\n00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.740\nIt does error checking,\ncorrection, and things like this.\n\n163\n00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:36.400\nAnd all of that goes and\nslows down my access to the data.\n\n164\n00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.130\nNow we had a network-attached\nstorage here for\n\n165\n00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.430\na while,\nthat we used to host some of our images.\n\n166\n00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:45.050\nAnd if you're imaging one computer great,\nman, speeds were fantastic.\n\n167\n00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:49.150\nIf you're imaging two computers at a time,\ndidn't really notice too much difference.\n\n168\n00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:50.810\nBy the time I would get to that sixth one,\n\n169\n00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:54.160\nI'd go down the row and\nI'd say I'd start the imaging on this one,\n\n170\n00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.580\nstart the imaging on the next one by\nthe time I got to the fourth or fifth one.\n\n171\n00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:00.780\nIt took me forever just to connect to it,\n\n172\n00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.230\nto see the list of images\nI could pick from.\n\n173\n00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:06.330\nBecause it was already serving up\nimages to five other machines.\n\n174\n00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:06.980\nRight.\n\n175\n00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.690\nIt's just not designed for that.\n\n176\n00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:13.640\nSo, it's typically something\nyou're going to see in Soho's or\n\n177\n00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.550\nin an enterprise environment.\n\n178\n00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:18.410\nBut for something that's not\naccessed by a lot of people.\n\n179\n00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:21.590\nI, like I said, we have NAS here,\nto store some things, but\n\n180\n00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:23.310\nnothing that I need that performance.\n\n181\n00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:28.388\nI would not put a database for\na web server, most likely, on my NAS.\n\n182\n00:10:28.388 --> 00:10:29.658\nAll right.\n\n183\n00:10:29.658 --> 00:10:34.900\n[COUGH] As we, sorry, move along from\nthere, we get into something called a SAN.\n\n184\n00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:44.570\nSAN is the next step up in performance,\nas well price, typically, right?\n\n185\n00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:49.010\nGood thing about a NAS, some advantages\nthere, no new technology, right?\n\n186\n00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:50.820\nI mean I'm using my existing switches.\n\n187\n00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.920\nI've got ethernet cables all over\nthe place, they're pretty cheap.\n\n188\n00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.750\nI'm just buying the device, the drives,\nplugging it in in my network and\n\n189\n00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:58.640\nI'm good to go.\n\n190\n00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.590\nEasy, breezy, not too expensive.\n\n191\n00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:07.320\nYou get in sans now we're talking\nabout storage area networks all right.\n\n192\n00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:12.160\nAnd it's just that,\nit's a network dedicated to storage.\n\n193\n00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:17.317\nThis is what you're gonna move up to when\nyou need that enterprise level everything.\n\n194\n00:11:17.317 --> 00:11:22.730\nThe enterprise-level performance,\nthe enterprise-level redundancy and\n\n195\n00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:25.780\nthings like that but\nit is gonna be a little more expensive.\n\n196\n00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:29.500\n>> Yeah, they're definitely, they cost\na pretty penny, that is for sure.\n\n197\n00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.500\nYou wanna make sure that if\nthis is something you need,\n\n198\n00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:32.800\nwell you've the wallet.\n\n199\n00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.310\nIf you're in a SOHO environment, you're\nprobably not gonna go with the sand.\n\n200\n00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:40.270\nAnd on the servers, you're thinking,\nwell other than having a little more\n\n201\n00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:44.940\nstorage and maybe some better performance,\nwhy does it cost so much more money?\n\n202\n00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.640\nWell, it really is the next level.\n\n203\n00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.420\nWhen we say, it's leaps and bounds\nabove nas, even though on the surface,\n\n204\n00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:56.710\nthey're kind of similar in\nthe way they operate, other than.\n\n205\n00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:58.220\nLike I said, on the surface.\n\n206\n00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:00.780\nWhen you look down in the guts of the\nthing though, there is a big difference.\n\n207\n00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:01.580\n>> There absolutely is.\n\n208\n00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.360\nAnd let's take a look at this\ndrawing I've got here, and\n\n209\n00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.320\nyou'll see immediately that it\nlooks a little bit different here.\n\n210\n00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.760\nHere's my local area network\nwhere my clients are.\n\n211\n00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.940\nMy servers are attached to\nthis local area network.\n\n212\n00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:16.740\nThis would all be most likely ethernet,\nright, gigabit ethernet.\n\n213\n00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.140\nBut behind there I've got my SAN, or\n\n214\n00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:24.410\nmy storage area network, and see I drew\nthe lines with a different color, here.\n\n215\n00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:27.190\nThese are typically going to be fiber,\nalright?\n\n216\n00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:31.140\nThis whole entire network\nback here is all gonna be.\n\n217\n00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.230\nFiber because I need that speed.\n\n218\n00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:37.930\nI don't want that limitation that I get\nwith that TCP/IP and with that ethernet.\n\n219\n00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:43.210\nWe're going to be sending SCSI commands\nover this fiber channel much less overhead\n\n220\n00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:48.410\nand you guys know, fiber, much,\nmuch, much faster technology.\n\n221\n00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:48.910\nAll right.\n\n222\n00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:51.180\nSo we got fiber.\n\n223\n00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:54.350\nThe other thing you'll notice is,\nthe redundancy that we typically build in,\n\n224\n00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:57.260\nbecause this is enterprise level storage.\n\n225\n00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.760\nAnd one of the things we've got to think\nabout when we think about shared storage.\n\n226\n00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.120\nAlright, is if everything is\non this shared storage and\n\n227\n00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.860\nI lose that then I'm losing,\neverybody's losing access to it.\n\n228\n00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.950\nRight?\nIf my machine's hard drive fails,\n\n229\n00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.030\nI lose access to my data.\n\n230\n00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:16.730\nIf my NAS fails,\nthe entire network can't get to it.\n\n231\n00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:19.280\nRight?\nIf I've got 50 servers and\n\n232\n00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:22.450\nthey're all pointing back to this\nstorage area network for their\n\n233\n00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:25.990\nvirtual hard drives an things like that,\nif that storage area network goes down,\n\n234\n00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.770\nthey didn't lose one server,\nthey lost 50, right?\n\n235\n00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:31.030\nSo we're gonna build some\nserious redundancy in here,\n\n236\n00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:34.730\nbecause now we're where we're kind of\ncreating a single point of failure, and\n\n237\n00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:36.910\nthen removing the single point of failure,\nright?\n\n238\n00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:41.190\nSo you can see each one of these servers\nhas multiple connections, right?\n\n239\n00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:45.200\nI've got two SAN devices here,\nstorage area network devices.\n\n240\n00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.190\nThese are boxes that have just\nstacks of drives in them.\n\n241\n00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.290\nAnd each server's connected to either one.\n\n242\n00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:57.840\nNow I would need some kinda replication\ntechnology to replicate data from\n\n243\n00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:01.520\none to the other, it depends,\nthis would be a very expensive solution.\n\n244\n00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:06.190\nThese guys here,\nthis little SAN device, you might\n\n245\n00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:11.220\nbreak into the market ten, 15, $20,000,\nyou can go well over $100,000.\n\n246\n00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:14.870\nYeah that's right, Lamborghini, sand.\n\n247\n00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:16.040\nYou pick.\n\n248\n00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:21.554\nSo having two of those is like saying yeah\nI've got two Lambos in the garage [LAUGH].\n\n249\n00:14:21.554 --> 00:14:23.900\n>> In case one breaks down [CROSSTALK].\n\n250\n00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:27.389\n>> That's right, if you need that if\nyou can not drive to work without your\n\n251\n00:14:27.389 --> 00:14:30.440\nLamborghini than you got a second one\nin case the first one breaks down.\n\n252\n00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.380\nAnd that's what we're doing here.\n\n253\n00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.270\nI mean if this is mission critical data,\n\n254\n00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.550\nthink about a company like,\nI don't know, Amazon.\n\n255\n00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:43.870\nHow much would they lose per hour, heck,\nper 15 minutes that their site was down?\n\n256\n00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:48.100\nIt's well worth the money I'm\ngonna spend on this second SAN.\n\n257\n00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:51.820\nThese are all done through fiber so\nwe've got extremely fast speeds.\n\n258\n00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:54.980\nThese guys are gonna be\nrunning Ray 10 most likely, so\n\n259\n00:14:54.980 --> 00:15:00.560\nyou've got stripes of mirrors or mirrors\nof stripes however you want to do that.\n\n260\n00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.720\n1001.\nAll redundant, right?\n\n261\n00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.990\nNow what I didn't draw in\nhere was some switches.\n\n262\n00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:07.000\nThese would most likely be hooked up to a.\n\n263\n00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.210\nA switch, and then to here, and\nI would have two switches as well, right?\n\n264\n00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:14.150\nOne for\neach one of these guys to pass through.\n\n265\n00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:17.680\nAgain, if we meet that fall tolerance,\nthat ability to survive,\n\n266\n00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:22.330\nif one of my cables bust,\none of those switches goes down,\n\n267\n00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.840\nwhatever it is,\nI'm still able to access that information.\n\n268\n00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.120\nAnd while we're on the topic\nof fiber channel here,\n\n269\n00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.380\nlet's talk about how you connect.\n\n270\n00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:32.410\nBecause it is a little bit\ndifferent than ethernet right.\n\n271\n00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:36.630\nMy network adapter on the back of my\nmachine has a RJ-45 plug in there.\n\n272\n00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:39.730\nWell, that's not gonna\nwork with a fiber network.\n\n273\n00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:42.820\nFiber is sending light, not electricity.\n\n274\n00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:47.270\nSo we need a different medium to send that\nover that's my fiber cables, all right?\n\n275\n00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:50.250\nIt's that optical or it's light.\n\n276\n00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.290\nIt could be LED, it could be laser.\n\n277\n00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:55.510\nBut you got that glass tube\nrunning down that cable.\n\n278\n00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:56.642\nSo that's our fiber.\n\n279\n00:15:56.642 --> 00:16:02.342\nYou connect that to what's call\na fiber HBA, or a Host Bus Adapter.\n\n280\n00:16:02.342 --> 00:16:06.567\nJust a fancy term for\na Fiber optic network adapter, right?\n\n281\n00:16:06.567 --> 00:16:07.881\nWhich is really what it is.\n\n282\n00:16:07.881 --> 00:16:09.858\nSo you throw HBAs in your servers,\n\n283\n00:16:09.858 --> 00:16:13.140\nnow you can plug that fiber\noptic cable into that server.\n\n284\n00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:16.100\nYou would also need different switches.\n\n285\n00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.860\nI can't use my RJ 45 or\nmy ethernet switches,\n\n286\n00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:23.010\nbecause sending electricity or\nsending light.\n\n287\n00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:26.930\nSo I've got to got buy new switches for\nthis fiber network or\n\n288\n00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:28.610\nmy storage area network.\n\n289\n00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:31.500\nAnd that's where that\nprice starts increasing.\n\n290\n00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.580\nI've already got the cost of\nthose SAN devices back there.\n\n291\n00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:35.960\nStart laying fiber out there,\n\n292\n00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:40.610\nstarting to put HBAs in all of my servers,\nfiber-based switches.\n\n293\n00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:43.670\nAll of that compounds that cost.\n\n294\n00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:46.300\nBut, as I said,\nthis is not meant for a SOHO, right?\n\n295\n00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.850\nThis is meant for an enterprise.\n\n296\n00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:53.490\nAnd we're typically dealing\nwith data to the point where\n\n297\n00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:58.070\nthe cost is outweighed by\nthe performance that I'm gonna get, and\n\n298\n00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:00.610\nthat high availability that I\ncan get with this, all right?\n\n299\n00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:04.600\nSo, you got your fiber channel HBAs and\nyour fiber channel switches.\n\n300\n00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.550\nWhat else?\n\n301\n00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:10.310\nAnd that's probably good for\nus for a storage area network.\n\n302\n00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:12.670\nAgain, the big thing to realize there.\n\n303\n00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:16.360\nAdvantages, usually redundancy and speed.\n\n304\n00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.250\nPerformance is gonna be through the roof.\n\n305\n00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.690\nThe disadvantage is cost, right?\n\n306\n00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:24.460\nAnd maintenance, that's something\nwe should also mention in here.\n\n307\n00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.170\nWorking with this sand a device is much\n\n308\n00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:29.670\ndifferent than creating\nvolumes on a server.\n\n309\n00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:34.040\nWe're working with logical unit numbers or\nLUNs, so configuring one of those,\n\n310\n00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:38.520\nif you've got a bunch of server admins,\nthey're certified, they're MTSAs or MTSEs,\n\n311\n00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.410\nthere's a good chance they've\nnever worked on one of these guys.\n\n312\n00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:43.980\nAnd they're gonna say, huh?\n\n313\n00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.550\nAnd so having somebody trained and\n\n314\n00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:48.630\nworking with those sands is\nanother thing I gotta think about.\n\n315\n00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:50.490\nI'm gonna have to send\nsomebody from training, or\n\n316\n00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:53.300\nI'm gonna have to get the guy from HP or\nDell, or\n\n317\n00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:57.660\nwhomever, to come out and and help me set\nthis thing up, and get it all configured.\n\n318\n00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.320\nAnd then, down the road, six months,\n\n319\n00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.780\neight months later what\nhappens when something fails?\n\n320\n00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.990\nDo I have anybody that can get in\nthere and work with that technology?\n\n321\n00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:08.720\nSo that's another thing we've gotta think\nabout with those fiber channel sands.\n\n322\n00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.630\n>> Yeah they, and\n\n323\n00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:12.790\nthey'll definitely cost you a little more\nmoney because of the switch technology,\n\n324\n00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:16.460\nit's gonna be more expensive,\nall the fiber cables, don't forget that.\n\n325\n00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:21.300\nMike says, he's not joking around, these\nthings can be seriously expensive, but, if\n\n326\n00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.900\nthat's what the network is really calling\nfor, if that's what your environment\n\n327\n00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:29.130\nreally necessitates, well then that's\njust gonna have to be how it has to be.\n\n328\n00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:34.680\nI remember I think we spent\n$2.5 million one time on IT.\n\n329\n00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.280\nThat was the IT budget of\nthe company I worked for, and\n\n330\n00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:43.219\nabout 40% of that went to servers and\nstorage, so do the math on that.\n\n331\n00:18:43.219 --> 00:18:45.850\n[LAUGH] And, that'll tell you\nhow much money we were throwing\n\n332\n00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:48.518\nat having this environment available,\nbecause that's what we needed.\n\n333\n00:18:48.518 --> 00:18:53.665\nSo you're spending that money cuz\nyou're making that money, as well.\n\n334\n00:18:53.665 --> 00:18:55.170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So don't think that that's not\n\n335\n00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:57.470\nbringing in the bacon, because it is.\n\n336\n00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.310\nThat technology is very, very helpful.\n\n337\n00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:00.740\nBut it's not the only game in town.\n\n338\n00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:03.095\nThis connectivity fiber channel is\n>> Is nice but\n\n339\n00:19:03.095 --> 00:19:05.195\nit does have a competitor doesn't it Mike?\n\n340\n00:19:05.195 --> 00:19:08.475\n>> It does and\nwe jokingly refer to it as poor man sand,\n\n341\n00:19:08.475 --> 00:19:12.825\nI can't afford those Lambo's in\nthe garage, I just wanna get that BMW or\n\n342\n00:19:12.825 --> 00:19:15.590\nthat Porsche sitting out there or\nwhat have you.\n\n343\n00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:18.690\nWe go with our poor man's scan,\npoor man's san.\n\n344\n00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:21.095\nAnd that's using iSCSI.\n\n345\n00:19:21.095 --> 00:19:27.500\niSCSI gives me the ability to send SCSI\ncommands across an IP based network.\n\n346\n00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.980\nBut wait, that means I don't need fiber.\n\n347\n00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:32.274\nI don't need HPH.\n\n348\n00:19:32.274 --> 00:19:33.310\nI don't need fiber switches.\n\n349\n00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:34.730\nRight?\n\n350\n00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:40.410\nI can use my existing technology to\nset up this storage area network.\n\n351\n00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:42.270\nNow we still gotta pay for\nthe SAN itself, right?\n\n352\n00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:46.840\nThat's a hunk, but I can save a lot\nwith the fact that I'm not using fiber.\n\n353\n00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.240\nEasy to work with,\nheck I can work with Ethernet, right?\n\n354\n00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.490\nI can cut cables, I can set IP addresses.\n\n355\n00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:55.160\nI mean we're back to technology\nthat we as Windows administrators\n\n356\n00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.150\nare a little more comfortable and\nfamiliar with.\n\n357\n00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:00.330\nAnd it's relatively easy to set up.\n\n358\n00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:04.315\nNow, I've actually got a little demo for\nus here that I can show you.\n\n359\n00:20:04.315 --> 00:20:07.930\niSCSI, again it really,\nit's a way to create,\n\n360\n00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:09.410\nwhat's another way they'll define iSCSI?\n\n361\n00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:12.920\nIt's a way to take remote storage and\nmake it look local.\n\n362\n00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.810\nAnother big advantage of iSCSI is\nI can do this over long distances.\n\n363\n00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:17.550\nFiber, right?\n\n364\n00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:21.150\nAm I gonna run a fiber cable from my\nbranch office here in Gainesville\n\n365\n00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:23.250\nback down to corporate in Tampa?\n\n366\n00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:24.360\nProbably not.\n\n367\n00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.970\nBut if I'm using iSCSI\nI can do lease lines or\n\n368\n00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:31.015\nI can use existing cables that are already\nthere if that's not redundant.\n\n369\n00:20:31.015 --> 00:20:32.970\n[LAUGH] You know what I mean though.\n\n370\n00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:36.860\nWe've got cables already in place that\nI can dump my technology on top of.\n\n371\n00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.900\niSCSI can travel long distances.\n\n372\n00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.720\nSo it can go over local area networks.\n\n373\n00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.690\nThey can go over wide area networks..\n\n374\n00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:43.850\nIt's IP right?\n\n375\n00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:45.940\nIP is what we drive the web with.\n\n376\n00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:47.040\nA TCP IP so\n\n377\n00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:51.280\nthis is technology that's gonna take\nadvantage of the existing infrastructure.\n\n378\n00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:55.010\nIt might not be the same performance\nthat I get from fiber, but\n\n379\n00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:57.200\nit's a lot lighter on the wallet.\n\n380\n00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:01.700\nAnd if you're a Soho that's\nmoving up to that next level.\n\n381\n00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.330\nYou're enterprise, but\nyou're not the Fortune 500.\n\n382\n00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:09.440\nYou don't have two point some million\ndollars to throw away at servers and\n\n383\n00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.480\nstorage, this might be the way to go.\n\n384\n00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:15.355\nWe use it here It's actually something\nbuilt into our server technologies.\n\n385\n00:21:15.355 --> 00:21:16.895\nI can set up and\nthat's what I'm gonna do for\n\n386\n00:21:16.895 --> 00:21:22.505\nyou here is set up a server as set\nup a server as an iSCSI target.\n\n387\n00:21:22.505 --> 00:21:24.335\nNow some terminology we\nneed to be familiar with,\n\n388\n00:21:24.335 --> 00:21:29.220\nwith iSCSI You've got an iSCSI target and\nyou've got iSCSI initiator.\n\n389\n00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:34.210\niSCSI target is the storage that we want\nto expose to the network, all right.\n\n390\n00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:40.670\nThe iSCSI initiator is what it used\nto connect to that iSCSI target.\n\n391\n00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:43.710\nNow, in 2008 R2,\nwhich is what this exam focuses on\n\n392\n00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:47.710\nthe eyes of the initiator is part\nof the server operating system.\n\n393\n00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:51.510\nYeah, cuz the target isn't download\nthat you have to get from Microsoft.\n\n394\n00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:55.220\nSo you just Google there,\nthey're gonna go out and look for iSCSI.\n\n395\n00:21:55.220 --> 00:22:00.330\nServer 2008 r2, you can download\nthe iSCSI target software,\n\n396\n00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:02.010\nwhich is what I've done here.\n\n397\n00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.230\nSo if we take a peak, I can open up,\nwe've taken a look at my screen here.\n\n398\n00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:10.380\nI can open up the iSCSI target software,\nand here's what we're looking at.\n\n399\n00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:11.880\nNow I've set some of\nthis up ahead of time,\n\n400\n00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.190\njust to save us a little bit of time.\n\n401\n00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:15.920\nBut I basically went in on my.\n\n402\n00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.650\nPhysical machine.\n\n403\n00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:21.400\nAll right, I've got a drive or\na few drives.\n\n404\n00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:27.790\nAll right, so this Local Disk (E)\nhere is a drive inside this computer.\n\n405\n00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:31.911\nAnd then on that drive,\nI created a virtual hard drive, all right.\n\n406\n00:22:31.911 --> 00:22:37.220\n2008 R2, we need to use virtual\nhard drives as the iSCSI target.\n\n407\n00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:39.990\nThis changes in the later\nversions of the operating system.\n\n408\n00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:42.590\nThis exam, this is the way\nit's going to work, all right?\n\n409\n00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:46.290\nSo you create this VHD,\nyou see I've got a 10 gigabyte VHD\n\n410\n00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:49.760\nsitting on this local disk on server,\nwe're on server three.\n\n411\n00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:56.250\nAll right, and there it shows up,\nand then I've created iSCSI target.\n\n412\n00:22:56.250 --> 00:23:00.760\nAnd you know what, let's create another\none so we can see this process actually.\n\n413\n00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:01.530\nWhat time do we got?\n\n414\n00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:02.320\nYeah we got time.\n\n415\n00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.580\nLet's do it.\n\n416\n00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:06.030\nIf I go back over here, and\nI take a look at the storage.\n\n417\n00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:08.360\nI am going to go to disc management.\n\n418\n00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:13.103\nAnd I'm gonna grab another one of these\ndrives I have in this computer and\n\n419\n00:23:13.103 --> 00:23:14.731\nI'm gonna format it real quick.\n\n420\n00:23:17.006 --> 00:23:21.110\nAnd we'll just use all my defaults\nhere except for volume labels.\n\n421\n00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:22.343\nI do hate volume labels.\n\n422\n00:23:24.631 --> 00:23:25.370\nAll right.\n\n423\n00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:27.530\nAnd we'll format that real quick.\n\n424\n00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:31.000\nSo now I've got some disk space and\nthat's gonna be F colon.\n\n425\n00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.870\nSo now, and I can do my iSCSI\ntarget from right here as well, or\n\n426\n00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:37.680\nI've got that iSCSI\nconsole that I can use.\n\n427\n00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:42.552\nAnd here I can create a new virtual disc.\n\n428\n00:23:42.552 --> 00:23:47.077\nSo I can right click, create virtual disc,\n\n429\n00:23:47.077 --> 00:23:52.213\nclick next, and\nthen I'm gonna put that on F: and\n\n430\n00:23:52.213 --> 00:23:56.004\nI'm gonna call it vhd02 That VHD,\n\n431\n00:23:56.004 --> 00:24:00.895\nnow click Next, and\nI'll go ahead and make it,\n\n432\n00:24:00.895 --> 00:24:06.641\nwe'll make it 15 GB here,\nor somewhere around that,\n\n433\n00:24:06.641 --> 00:24:13.287\nso we can tell the difference,\nand I'll call it VHD02 again.\n\n434\n00:24:13.287 --> 00:24:15.932\nClick Next, and\nthen I've got to add a target,\n\n435\n00:24:15.932 --> 00:24:20.540\nI've got to say who is allowed to\nreach out and connect to the storage.\n\n436\n00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:24.005\nSo I'll click Add and I'm going select,\n\n437\n00:24:24.005 --> 00:24:29.264\nthat's not what I wanted,\nI need to create that target first.\n\n438\n00:24:29.264 --> 00:24:32.680\nHere, as long as you go ahead and\nclick Next and Finish.\n\n439\n00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.920\nAnd that's gonna create that storage.\n\n440\n00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:39.180\nSo these are my iSCSI drives,\nthese are my iSCSI targets,\n\n441\n00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:41.740\nwhat other machines can now connect to.\n\n442\n00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:43.850\nAnd I've already created one target,\n\n443\n00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:47.040\nI'll show you that process there,\nI'll just right click.\n\n444\n00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:51.100\nCreate iSCSI target,\nI'll click next on my wizard.\n\n445\n00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:54.143\nMy target name, we'll call this SVR 01.\n\n446\n00:24:56.824 --> 00:25:02.584\nAnd my identifier, I can use what's\ncalled an iSCSI qualifying name,\n\n447\n00:25:02.584 --> 00:25:04.607\nThose are kind of weird.\n\n448\n00:25:04.607 --> 00:25:08.530\nIt's gonna be IQN: 1901- 55.\n\n449\n00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:10.720\nIt's a strange format.\n\n450\n00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.620\nI'm gonna choose to do,\nI clicked Advanced.\n\n451\n00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:16.430\nAnd I'm actually gonna\ndo a IP address instead.\n\n452\n00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:18.226\nA little bit easier for me.\n\n453\n00:25:18.226 --> 00:25:22.778\n10.1.2.01, I think is his IP address.\n\n454\n00:25:22.778 --> 00:25:26.820\nAnd I'm listing who I'm gonna allow\nto connect to this particular target.\n\n455\n00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:30.470\nAnd we're typically gonna create\ndifferent targets for different servers.\n\n456\n00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:34.050\nOne thing with iSCSI,\nwe can end up with some conflicts if\n\n457\n00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:37.500\ntwo machines are connected\nto that same target.\n\n458\n00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:41.100\nI'll click OK, I'll click Next and Finish.\n\n459\n00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:43.370\nAnd now I've got one for Server 01.\n\n460\n00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:47.270\nSo, that's kinda the process\nof creating these iSCSIs.\n\n461\n00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:49.720\nAgain, I wouldn't worry too\nmuch about this on the exam.\n\n462\n00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.660\nIt's cool to see,\nI want to show you how it works,\n\n463\n00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:54.665\nbut don't think you're going to have to\ngo back and memorize those wizards or\n\n464\n00:25:54.665 --> 00:25:57.509\nanything like that, it's more about\nunderstanding this technology.\n\n465\n00:25:57.509 --> 00:26:01.149\nSo now if I flip over here,\nthis is server two, and\n\n466\n00:26:01.149 --> 00:26:06.885\nthat first one I setup storage one,\nI listed server two as the target.\n\n467\n00:26:06.885 --> 00:26:11.584\nSo, to connect to it,\nI'm simply gonna open my iSCSI Initiator.\n\n468\n00:26:11.584 --> 00:26:14.380\nThis is what you use to\nconnect to the iSCSI target.\n\n469\n00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.930\nThat's part of the OS,\ndon't have to download it.\n\n470\n00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:22.878\nAnd as far as connecting to it,\nI can say my target is over there on what,\n\n471\n00:26:22.878 --> 00:26:28.770\nsbr03, I can do a quick connect and\nit's gonna find.\n\n472\n00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:31.930\nWhoops, persis logon failed, interesting.\n\n473\n00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:37.459\nThere I am, I am now connected\nto that storage01 target and\n\n474\n00:26:37.459 --> 00:26:39.435\nI'll click OK, all right?\n\n475\n00:26:39.435 --> 00:26:40.399\nAnd I go, great, Mike.\n\n476\n00:26:40.399 --> 00:26:43.160\nWell, what the heck did that do for\nme, right?\n\n477\n00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:47.560\nOpen up File Explorer and\ngo to My Computer.\n\n478\n00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.780\nActually, I'm not going to see it yet.\n\n479\n00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:50.970\nI almost forgot.\n\n480\n00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:56.230\nLet's go to Storage over here on\nthis guy and and Disk Management.\n\n481\n00:26:57.530 --> 00:26:58.830\nAnd there it is, right there.\n\n482\n00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:01.130\nThere is that iSCSI disk, right?\n\n483\n00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:02.760\nThis looks like a local disk.\n\n484\n00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:06.880\nTo this server it looks exactly\nlike local disk, but in fact,\n\n485\n00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.110\nit's located on server three.\n\n486\n00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:12.350\nAnd server three could be another\nserver in the same closet,\n\n487\n00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:14.490\nanother server in Timbuktu, right?\n\n488\n00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:16.940\nThat's the cool thing\nabout iSCSI like this.\n\n489\n00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:22.836\nIf I bring that disk online and\nI initialize that drive,\n\n490\n00:27:22.836 --> 00:27:26.359\nI can now create volumes on here.\n\n491\n00:27:26.359 --> 00:27:31.500\nI can do whatever I need to do,\nsort storage and out.\n\n492\n00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:35.734\nI've got this remote storage and\nthe storage is remote.\n\n493\n00:27:35.734 --> 00:27:37.693\nThat's a little redundant\nthere as well but-\n\n494\n00:27:37.693 --> 00:27:38.250\n>> It's not here.\n\n495\n00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:40.980\n>> It's not here,\nexactly what I'm trying to say.\n\n496\n00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.140\nIt's not located on this server.\n\n497\n00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:44.990\nBut again, this server doesn't know that.\n\n498\n00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:48.060\nThis server sees it as\njust another local disk.\n\n499\n00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:50.595\nNotice it's listed right here,\nDisk 0, Disk 1.\n\n500\n00:27:50.595 --> 00:27:52.806\nIt doesn't know.\n\n501\n00:27:52.806 --> 00:27:54.617\nI mean,\nI shouldn't say that it doesn't know,\n\n502\n00:27:54.617 --> 00:27:57.264\nbecause it's definitely going across\nthe network to get to it, but for\n\n503\n00:27:57.264 --> 00:28:00.466\napplications for example, running on\nthe server, that's local storage for them.\n\n504\n00:28:00.466 --> 00:28:04.250\nAll right,\nwe can do the same thing over here.\n\n505\n00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:10.350\nI can go to my iSCSI Initiator,\nif I can find it.\n\n506\n00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:14.656\nAnd this was the second one I did.\n\n507\n00:28:14.656 --> 00:28:17.227\nAnd when you first turn this,\nif you've never used this before,\n\n508\n00:28:17.227 --> 00:28:18.830\nthe service isn't running by default.\n\n509\n00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:21.712\nIt's installed, it's not running,\nso I turn it on.\n\n510\n00:28:21.712 --> 00:28:23.140\nAll right, and\nlet me get this out of the way.\n\n511\n00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:28.907\nAnd then we'll launch\nthat iSCSI Initiator.\n\n512\n00:28:32.239 --> 00:28:35.250\nAnd it's gonna think about it, maybe\nit's gonna show us and maybe it's not.\n\n513\n00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:39.420\nAre you gonna do the Jiminy click it,\nnope better not, there it is.\n\n514\n00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:41.930\nAnd my target is SVR0.\n\n515\n00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:43.590\nThree is gonna contain this.\n\n516\n00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:46.179\nWe'll say quick connect, and there it is.\n\n517\n00:28:46.179 --> 00:28:49.370\nI can see that server one target.\n\n518\n00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:50.970\nActually that looks like the same one.\n\n519\n00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:53.400\nBut it is connected.\n\n520\n00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.890\nYou can pull up the properties, guys, and\n\n521\n00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:59.050\nyou can start looking at\nthe drives that are there.\n\n522\n00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:04.500\nI can see the devices, things that\nwe really don't need to dive in for\n\n523\n00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:05.130\nthis exam.\n\n524\n00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:06.630\nBut there's things like MPIO,\n\n525\n00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:10.150\nMulti Path Input Output,\nto give me some fall tolerance, right?\n\n526\n00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:13.780\nRemember how the fiber had\nthat great redundancy?\n\n527\n00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:17.630\niSCSI, little bit easier to provide\nredundancy cuz it's ethernet, right?\n\n528\n00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:24.110\nI can do the same thing as we did here,\nthis would be all ethernet.\n\n529\n00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:25.970\nAdd two switches, right?\n\n530\n00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:29.880\nRunning ethernet to them, and\nthen I would create two separate targets.\n\n531\n00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:33.342\nI would say, all right,\nover this network adapter connect.\n\n532\n00:29:33.342 --> 00:29:37.503\nAlso connect to this network adaptor, use\nthis network adapter to connect multi path\n\n533\n00:29:37.503 --> 00:29:40.352\ninput output, so\nnow I've got two different paths to go.\n\n534\n00:29:40.352 --> 00:29:43.530\nEach one of those network adaptors\nis connected to a different switch.\n\n535\n00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:46.400\nNow I can provide that\nsame type of redundancy.\n\n536\n00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:49.520\nIt'll actually double up my\nbandwidth if both links are up.\n\n537\n00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:53.460\nBut if one of them fails,\nI still have connectivity to that iSCSI.\n\n538\n00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:58.570\nSo iSCSI really is what I like\nto say is the poor man's SAN but\n\n539\n00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:00.600\nI don't wanna make that sound derogatory.\n\n540\n00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:04.360\nI mean it's a good technology,\nit's got really good performance and\n\n541\n00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:08.410\nif your enterprise or\nyour corporation is not ready to spend\n\n542\n00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:12.470\nthe kinda bucks we do on fiber,\nthis is a fantastic solution.\n\n543\n00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:17.466\nSo for the exam, understand this is\na very viable way to create a storage\n\n544\n00:30:17.466 --> 00:30:22.148\narea network using iSCSI and\nnot moving to that fiber technology.\n\n545\n00:30:22.148 --> 00:30:24.430\nSo lots of different technologies we have.\n\n546\n00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:27.270\nI do have one more that's not\nnearly as exciting as these guys.\n\n547\n00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:29.079\nIn fact, it's pretty boring.\n\n548\n00:30:29.079 --> 00:30:32.109\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, in a mixed environment,\n\n549\n00:30:32.109 --> 00:30:38.850\nwe've been talking about Windows servers,\nWindows using NTFS as my file system.\n\n550\n00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:42.960\nIn a mixed environment you might find\nthat you have Windows servers and\n\n551\n00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.040\nand Unix space servers.\n\n552\n00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:49.570\nUnix space servers use NFS or\nnetwork file systems.\n\n553\n00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:52.150\nWindows now supports NFS.\n\n554\n00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:56.250\nI can create NFS shares, so\nif I go back over here to my\n\n555\n00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:03.710\nroles and if I can get my scroll to work,\nI can choose add rolls.\n\n556\n00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:06.380\nClick Next.\n\n557\n00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:08.450\nAnd do my file services.\n\n558\n00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:12.020\nAnd Next, and Next.\n\n559\n00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:17.420\nAnd under here I should have services for\nnetwork file system.\n\n560\n00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:18.040\nOr NFS.\n\n561\n00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:22.380\nI'll click Next and Install.\n\n562\n00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:26.970\nAnd that's gonna whir and grind for\na second and install that capability.\n\n563\n00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:29.660\nAnd as it finishes up there,\nI'm getting impatient,\n\n564\n00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:32.250\nI'm ready to click,\nwaiting for it to finish.\n\n565\n00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:33.540\nIt's like come on.\n\n566\n00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:37.842\nIt's going to give me the ability to\ncreate an NFS space share, so that I can\n\n567\n00:31:37.842 --> 00:31:42.691\nhave a share available to my Unix servers\nin their native protocol, rather than them\n\n568\n00:31:42.691 --> 00:31:47.502\nhave to use something like, what is it,\nSamba or some way to convert that, right?\n\n569\n00:31:47.502 --> 00:31:51.402\n>> Yeah, the SMB, they tend to\nuse that to create Samba shares.\n\n570\n00:31:51.402 --> 00:31:55.012\nVery, very common, but NFS is probably\nan easier way to go about it,\n\n571\n00:31:55.012 --> 00:31:56.640\nI'll be honest with you.\n\n572\n00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:00.870\nJust create that NFS file share,\nand now the Windows host and\n\n573\n00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:06.300\nthe Unix host will see that as, even\nthough it's a remote type of file access,\n\n574\n00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:09.340\nit sees it as a local,\njust kind of like we saw with that iSCSI.\n\n575\n00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:15.070\nIt treats it just the same as a locally\nconnected type of a storage device,\n\n576\n00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:16.350\nso it's very nice.\n\n577\n00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:18.530\n>> Absolutely and\nagain there's no conversion, right?\n\n578\n00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:21.120\nThey don't have to convert their request\n\n579\n00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.060\nto something their\nWindows would understand.\n\n580\n00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:27.851\nI'm gonna say Share with,\nSpecific people again this is not a best\n\n581\n00:32:27.851 --> 00:32:30.550\npractice cuz I just want to get\nthis done quickly for the demo.\n\n582\n00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:36.372\nWe'll say Everyone Read Write,\nand I'll share that guy out.\n\n583\n00:32:36.372 --> 00:32:40.380\nAll right, so far no different\nthan creating a share in Windows.\n\n584\n00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:43.560\nBut now that I've installed that role, and\n\n585\n00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:49.640\nI go back over here to the Properties I've\ngot an NFS Sharing tab.\n\n586\n00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:53.240\nAnd notice I shared it out to Windows,\nright, it's already shared.\n\n587\n00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.790\nBut now I can add an NFS share to it,\n\n588\n00:32:55.790 --> 00:33:01.410\nI can choose to Manage NFS Share,\nShare this folder.\n\n589\n00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:04.850\nLot of the same properties,\nI create a normal share.\n\n590\n00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:08.020\nName, different authentication protocols.\n\n591\n00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:09.750\nFor this one I'm not gonna\nworry about permissions.\n\n592\n00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:14.354\nThis is more about understanding that\nwe can do NFS on a Windows environment.\n\n593\n00:33:14.354 --> 00:33:15.660\nI'll click OK.\n\n594\n00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.380\nAnd I'll click Close.\n\n595\n00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:21.300\nAnd if I go back into those Properties,\nand that NFS share,\n\n596\n00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:24.010\nI can see it's now shared out.\n\n597\n00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:27.599\nYou'll notice that it's not a UNC\npath like we deal in Windows, right.\n\n598\n00:33:27.599 --> 00:33:31.039\nIt's server 02:/nfs.\n\n599\n00:33:31.039 --> 00:33:31.662\nRight.\n\n600\n00:33:31.662 --> 00:33:34.520\nSo that shows you it's\na different protocol being used.\n\n601\n00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.750\nBut now, my Windows machines\ncan connect to that share.\n\n602\n00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:41.294\nMy other servers, my Window servers and my\nUnix servers can connect to that share and\n\n603\n00:33:41.294 --> 00:33:42.520\neverybody's happy.\n\n604\n00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:46.071\n>> That's right we live in a lovely\nenvironment where everyone plays nicely\n\n605\n00:33:46.071 --> 00:33:47.800\ntogether and that's what we like.\n\n606\n00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.370\nBecause you know what, like it or\n\n607\n00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:53.840\nnot you're probably going to be in a mixed\nenvironment, so this is a nice thing for\n\n608\n00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.370\nus to be able to do,\nmake those servers talk to each other.\n\n609\n00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:58.830\nMike, is there anything else we need\nto cover before we let them go?\n\n610\n00:33:58.830 --> 00:33:59.860\n>> I don't think so.\n\n611\n00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:05.400\nJust remember in this exam don't spend\ntoo much time getting into Protocols and\n\n612\n00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:09.120\nhow iSCSI works over IP or\nanything like that.\n\n613\n00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.840\nGreat information,\nif you want to get into that, fantastic.\n\n614\n00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:14.370\nFor the exam,\nbe familiar with the advantages and\n\n615\n00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:16.651\ndisadvantages of these\ndifferent technologies.\n\n616\n00:34:16.651 --> 00:34:20.309\nAnd more importantly, where I would\nchoose, why I would choose this\n\n617\n00:34:20.309 --> 00:34:24.550\none in this situation versus choosing\na different solution in this situation.\n\n618\n00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:25.660\n>> That's it.\nAwesome stuff.\n\n619\n00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:29.621\nHopefully now you're a little more in tune\nwhen it comes to storage solutions in our\n\n620\n00:34:29.621 --> 00:34:31.210\nWindows server environment.\n\n621\n00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:32.950\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nclose this episode down.\n\n622\n00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:36.240\nSo signing off for ITPro TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n623\n00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:37.161\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n624\n00:34:37.161 -->

[LAUGH]\n>> We all grew up watching\n\n14\n00:00:38.476 --> 00:00:39.460\nthe commercials, Mike.\n\n15\n00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.920\nWe know all about Raid.\n\n16\n00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.600\n>> That's right.\n\n17\n00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.200\nBut in this one we're not gonna\nbe talking about the bug spray.\n\n18\n00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.033\nWe're gonna be talking about ways that we\ncan set up hard drives to provide better\n\n19\n00:00:49.033 --> 00:00:52.740\nperformance and redundancy,\nor some combination thereof.\n\n20\n00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.960\nOver and beyond what we would\nget normally from our drives.\n\n21\n00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.330\nThat's really where RAID comes into play.\n\n22\n00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.530\n>> Yeah.\nWhen Mike says RAID,\n\n23\n00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.250\nhe's actually talking about an acronym.\n\n24\n00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.085\nAnd it stands for\nRedundant Array of Inexpensive or Or\n\n25\n00:01:05.085 --> 00:01:07.920\nindependent discs depending\non where you come from.\n\n26\n00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.875\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I do believe nowadays the one that most\n\n27\n00:01:11.875 --> 00:01:16.355\npeople go by is independent discs because,\nwell most discs are pretty inexpensive.\n\n28\n00:01:16.355 --> 00:01:17.335\nSome of them are expensive.\n\n29\n00:01:17.335 --> 00:01:18.767\nBut, most of them are some\nare pretty inexpensive.\n\n30\n00:01:18.767 --> 00:01:22.737\nSo it's not usually referred\nto as independent disks.\n\n31\n00:01:22.737 --> 00:01:25.617\nBasically all we're saying is we're gonna\ntake a bunch of hard drives, we're gonna\n\n32\n00:01:25.617 --> 00:01:29.007\nlink them together in a bunch of different\nways, so that we can get different types\n\n33\n00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:33.428\nof performance or redundancy out of them,\ndepending on what it is we're looking for.\n\n34\n00:01:33.428 --> 00:01:37.178\nAnd Mike, you've got a bunch of cool stuff\nset up for us to help learn this thing in\n\n35\n00:01:37.178 --> 00:01:40.638\nour little brains, so that we can go\nto that exam with confidence, right?\n\n36\n00:01:40.638 --> 00:01:41.618\n>> Absolutely I do.\n\n37\n00:01:41.618 --> 00:01:43.148\nSo let's start talking about RAID.\n\n38\n00:01:43.148 --> 00:01:46.350\nFirst thing we need to know is RAID\nthey create what we call RAID levels or\n\n39\n00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.470\nthey call them RAID levels.\n\n40\n00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.270\nAnd there's several different ones.\n\n41\n00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.930\nIf you go out there and do your studying,\nyou're doing your research,\n\n42\n00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.810\nyou're gonna find that there's RAID zero,\nRAID one.\n\n43\n00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.530\nThere's RAID two, RAID three, RAID four,\nRAID five and all the way up to 100.\n\n44\n00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.640\nNo, just kidding.\n\n45\n00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.920\nYou know, it goes 5, 6, and\nI know of vertebrae 10.\n\n46\n00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.260\nThere's probably more than that.\n\n47\n00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.520\nFor this exam though, we're gonna\nfocus on just the ones we mainly see.\n\n48\n00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.310\nThe ones we'd normally see.\n\n49\n00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.440\nIn a production environment.\n\n50\n00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.130\nSome of those other levels either were\nfolded into other working groups or\n\n51\n00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.030\nnever panned out the way they wanted.\n\n52\n00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.400\nOr just didn't really benefit us and\nwere never used or implemented.\n\n53\n00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.520\nSo the ones we're going to focus on\nare gonna be RAID zero, RAID one,\n\n54\n00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.540\nRAID five and RAID ten some people\nare gonna call that RAID one plus zero,\n\n55\n00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.080\nsometimes they just leave out the plus and\nthey call it RAID ten, but\n\n56\n00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.510\ntechnically it is RAID one plus zero,\nbut if you call it RAID ten,\n\n57\n00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.760\nDaniel, I don't think anybody is\nreally gonna bite your head off.\n\n58\n00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.710\n>> No, that is fine to reference in as\nRAID ten, so be happy in doing that\n\n59\n00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.400\nif that's what you like and we'll get into\nsome particulars on why that might be.\n\n60\n00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.580\nWe'll get to that here in a minute, but\nMike, the first thing I think of when I\n\n61\n00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.190\nthink of RAID is, well RAID zero,\nand that's because performance or\n\n62\n00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.600\nmy computer might be smoking mics\neven though we got the same hardware.\n\n63\n00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.960\nAnd why might that be?\n\n64\n00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.120\nRAID zero might be the culprit there.\n\n65\n00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.720\n>> RAID zero could definitely be why\nbecause RAID zero is basically striping\n\n66\n00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.750\nand let us take a look at my screen\nhere and I will explain what I mean.\n\n67\n00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.460\nNormally you got a single\nhard drive in your system.\n\n68\n00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.500\nAnd you've got a single read write head\nif we're talking about mechanical drives,\n\n69\n00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.230\nright, or magnetic drives.\n\n70\n00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.540\nWe've got that read write head bouncing\naround on top of those platters,\n\n71\n00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.140\nwriting that data, so you've got\nwhat we call a single IO, right?\n\n72\n00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.400\nA single input output process\nthere with that hard drive.\n\n73\n00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.290\nWith RAID 0 we're gonna take two drives,\nand\n\n74\n00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.860\nwe're going to create\nwhat we call a stripe.\n\n75\n00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.640\nWe're gonna make it look to\nthe operating system as a single drive.\n\n76\n00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.250\nAnd when it goes to write something,\n\n77\n00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.310\nit's gonna split that write job\nto two separate read-write heads.\n\n78\n00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.250\nAnd you can think about one guy, if you\nwanna think about it in human terms,\n\n79\n00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.110\nthis guy is writing down\nthe first part of that paragraph.\n\n80\n00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.220\nThis guy is writing down the second\npart of the paragraph, and\n\n81\n00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.310\nthey can do it at the same time, right?\n\n82\n00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.530\nSo, instead of one person writing the\nentire paragraph out to keep track of it\n\n83\n00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.730\nI got two guys,\neach one doing half of the work, right.\n\n84\n00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.550\nI can actually get the job\ndone in half the time.\n\n85\n00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.730\nThat's the idea behind the stripes.\n\n86\n00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.920\nAnd so\nbasically what I've tried to do here,\n\n87\n00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.250\nyou can see A1, A2, then A3, A4, A5, A6.\n\n88\n00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.710\nSo, I get a really nice\nperformance Performance benefit\n\n89\n00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.300\nwhen it comes to my write speeds\non the RAID 0 or a striped volume.\n\n90\n00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.650\nYou also get read performance benefits.\n\n91\n00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.860\nMaybe not quite as much as you do\nfrom the write, but same thing.\n\n92\n00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.950\nYou've got two separate read/write heads.\n\n93\n00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.830\nEach reading part of the data, can feed it\nback to whatever's requesting that data,\n\n94\n00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.860\nwhatever is requesting that IO process,\nthat input output process.\n\n95\n00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.300\nSo, we get great performance\nbenefits out of RAID zero, but\n\n96\n00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.350\nthere's a drawback, right.\n\n97\n00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.560\nThere's a price we've gotta pay for\nthat level of performance, and\n\n98\n00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.320\nthat is the redundancy side of things.\n\n99\n00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.590\nThere is no redundancy, there's no\nfault tolerance built in to RAID 0.\n\n100\n00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.000\nMy data is striped across\ntwo separate hard drives.\n\n101\n00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.930\nHalf of it's over here,\nhalf of it's over here.\n\n102\n00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.770\nAnd if I lose either one of those drives.\n\n103\n00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.960\nI lose all of my data, not half.\n\n104\n00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.450\nIf I lose this drive on the left,\n\n105\n00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.280\nI cannot recover the data from what's\nleft on this drive on the right.\n\n106\n00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.970\nIt's just not going to work.\n\n107\n00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.980\nSo, in reality, you're actually\nincreasing the points of failure for\n\n108\n00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:36.960\nyour data, right?\n\n109\n00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.750\nIf it was all on one drive,\nif that drive fails, you lose your data.\n\n110\n00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:46.330\nWell, now with RAID 0, either one of those\ndrives fails and I lose all of my data.\n\n111\n00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.960\nSo, I'm increasing the points of failure.\n\n112\n00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.420\nI'm increasing the chance\nthat I'm gonna lose my data.\n\n113\n00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.040\nWhich really doesn't sound like\na good idea, does it Daniel?\n\n114\n00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.870\n>> No, you would think, okay you had\nme there at performance and then.\n\n115\n00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.540\nYou totally lost me with doubling\nmy chances of losing my data.\n\n116\n00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.440\nAnd that might be true.\n\n117\n00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.060\nAnd obviously there are probably\na lot of reasons you\n\n118\n00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.350\nwould not want to go with RAID 0.\n\n119\n00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.510\nBut there are some applications where\nRAID 0 does come in handy, right?\n\n120\n00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:14.200\n>> There is.\n\n121\n00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.080\nWhat you're talking about here is\nusing this type when you talk about\n\n122\n00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.870\nusing RAID 0,\n\n123\n00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.130\nyou're gonna use this in a place where I'm\nnot worried about losing the data, right?\n\n124\n00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.360\nBecause I'm definitely not gonna put\nmy corporate data on a RAID 0 array.\n\n125\n00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.940\nThe performance benefit is not worth\nthe risk of losing all that information.\n\n126\n00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.830\nSo I'm not putting databases on here.\n\n127\n00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:39.180\nI'm not setting up file servers with\ndata volumes with array at zero array.\n\n128\n00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.660\nRight?\nBut\n\n129\n00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.670\nwhat about my operating system drives,\nright?\n\n130\n00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.050\nIf my operating system fails,\nI slap a new image on there.\n\n131\n00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.080\nAll right, as long as I put\nmy data on a separate drive,\n\n132\n00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.020\nand we're talking about\nlike in file servers or\n\n133\n00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.240\nin a high end work stations I've\ngot multiple drives in there.\n\n134\n00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.640\nI've got five, six, eight drives in there.\n\n135\n00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.730\nI can take two of those drives, stripe\nthem together and put my operating system\n\n136\n00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:06.110\non there Alright, I do this on\nmy home machine for a long time.\n\n137\n00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.840\nI had two 10,000 rpm rapture drives\nstriped and I used those for\n\n138\n00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.140\nmy operating system.\n\n139\n00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:15.090\nI had separate 500 gigabyte drives\nin there for all my data and\n\n140\n00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:19.130\nI redirected all my documents and\nmy pictures and all that stuff.\n\n141\n00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.400\nOver to those other data drives.\n\n142\n00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.010\nI installed, this was back in Windows XP.\n\n143\n00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.930\nAnd you were still using\na DVD at that time.\n\n144\n00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.320\nAnd I installed it in under 15 minutes,\nright.\n\n145\n00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.300\nMy machine was lightning.\n\n146\n00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.320\nIt was just incredibly responsive\nwith that striped set.\n\n147\n00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.970\nAnd if one of those drives failed,\nand it did actually, I was okay.\n\n148\n00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.840\nI went and got another drive,\nI put it in there, and\n\n149\n00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.390\nI reinstalled my operating system.\n\n150\n00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.450\nAll my data was still fine.\n\n151\n00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:45.723\nI had to reinstall my applications, but\nI still have all the source files for\n\n152\n00:07:45.723 --> 00:07:46.402\nthat, right?\n\n153\n00:07:46.402 --> 00:07:50.197\nSo, that's a scenario where I'm\nputting data on this stripe for\n\n154\n00:07:50.197 --> 00:07:52.959\nperformance and\nI don't care about losing it.\n\n155\n00:07:52.959 --> 00:07:57.293\nPlace you might see this in a Corporate\nenvironment in a server, might be for\n\n156\n00:07:57.293 --> 00:07:58.183\nthe page file.\n\n157\n00:07:58.183 --> 00:08:01.081\nWhen you've got all these\ndrives in this server,\n\n158\n00:08:01.081 --> 00:08:04.590\nyou can dedicate two drives\njust to the page file.\n\n159\n00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:06.650\nPage file's temporary memory, right?\n\n160\n00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:12.500\nSo I don't care if one of those drives\nfails and I lose it, no big deal.\n\n161\n00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:16.924\nBut the performance I get from using\na striped set from a page file.\n\n162\n00:08:16.924 --> 00:08:19.735\nI mean, it's never gonna be\nquite as fast as memory, but\n\n163\n00:08:19.735 --> 00:08:23.309\nthat's a big drawback of the page file,\nis it's writing it to a drive and\n\n164\n00:08:23.309 --> 00:08:25.710\nthat's much, much slower than memory.\n\n165\n00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:28.810\nWell now we've creeped up a little\nbit towards the speed that we\n\n166\n00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:29.850\nmight get from memory.\n\n167\n00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:34.520\nNot getting there, but again, it's when\nyou've got performance desires, but\n\n168\n00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.690\nyou don't care about the redundancy.\n\n169\n00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.820\nThat's where you're gonna\nsee a raid zero array.\n\n170\n00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.380\n>> Yeah,\nI see this a lot actually with gaming.\n\n171\n00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.958\nYou think of gaming as a leisure activity.\n\n172\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.708\nBut anymore it's a big business and\nthey've got testers,\n\n173\n00:08:46.708 --> 00:08:48.964\nthey've got people that\ndo it professionally.\n\n174\n00:08:48.964 --> 00:08:53.675\nGoing with a rate zero can give you that\nincrease in performance of your computer\n\n175\n00:08:53.675 --> 00:08:55.660\nso you get the nice look and feel.\n\n176\n00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:56.920\nEverything runs nice and fast and\n\n177\n00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.082\nyou don't care about the data\nbecause it's just a game.\n\n178\n00:08:59.082 --> 00:09:05.090\nIf the drive goes wonky on you, get a new\ndrive, slap it in, reinstall the game.\n\n179\n00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:06.670\nYou're back in action,\nit's not a big deal.\n\n180\n00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:11.070\nYou see it there, you also see it in audio\nand video rendering and manipulation.\n\n181\n00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:14.383\nBecause you have a hard copy of\nthe file on a file server and\n\n182\n00:09:14.383 --> 00:09:18.662\nyou copy that over to your RAID 0, and\nthen doing things like rendering or\n\n183\n00:09:18.662 --> 00:09:20.890\nprocessing, is much, much faster.\n\n184\n00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.540\nSo you see it there as well.\n\n185\n00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.674\nIt does have its application so\n\n186\n00:09:24.674 --> 00:09:30.186\ndon't discount RAID 0 even though it\nmight not be for you in your environment.\n\n187\n00:09:30.186 --> 00:09:33.845\nNow, that being said, Mike, we've\nobviously talked about a couple other\n\n188\n00:09:33.845 --> 00:09:36.160\nlevels of RAID we need to go over as well.\n\n189\n00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.055\nRAID, I guess we'll just move\nup the line with RAID 1.\n\n190\n00:09:39.055 --> 00:09:41.150\n>> I like it,\nlet's just keep on going in order.\n\n191\n00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.203\nSo we'll move up to RAID 1 and I've got\nanother fancy drawing for you here.\n\n192\n00:09:44.203 --> 00:09:48.888\nAnd you can actually see I cheated and\nI just copied my drive and changed some of\n\n193\n00:09:48.888 --> 00:09:53.475\nthe, or copied my RAID 0 picture and\nchanged some of the letters up on you.\n\n194\n00:09:53.475 --> 00:09:56.320\nCuz it is similar to\nthe way it looks here, but\n\n195\n00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.570\nit is a lot different in\nthe way that it functions.\n\n196\n00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:02.380\nRAID 1 is a mirrored volume, and\n\n197\n00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:07.650\nthat name probably gives you a good\nindication of where I'm heading with this.\n\n198\n00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:11.710\nIf we pay attention to the little data\nindicators I've got on here, two drives.\n\n199\n00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:16.750\nBut instead of spreading the data across\nthe drives in a stripe, like with RAID 0,\n\n200\n00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:19.570\nhere we're gonna duplicate the data.\n\n201\n00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:23.900\nWe're gonna write it to here,\nA1, and also write it to here.\n\n202\n00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:27.043\nSo I still have two read\nwrite heads in this case, but\n\n203\n00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:29.050\neach one is doing all the work.\n\n204\n00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:33.440\nOne of them is actually duplicating\neverything the other one has already done,\n\n205\n00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.890\nor they do it at the same time.\n\n206\n00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:37.050\nHe doesn't have to wait until\nhe's finished or anything.\n\n207\n00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:38.620\nSo, from this you can see,\n\n208\n00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:41.850\nI'm not gonna get any performance\nbenefit when it comes to writing.\n\n209\n00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.660\nBecause this guy still has\nto write all of the data.\n\n210\n00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.420\nHe's not getting any help from anybody.\n\n211\n00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:50.420\nThis guy has to write all of the data,\nnot getting any help from anybody.\n\n212\n00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:53.700\nSo why do we use RAID 1?\n\n213\n00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.760\nBecause I've got an exact\ncopy of the data.\n\n214\n00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:03.040\nAnd now if this drive on the left fails, I\nhave an exact copy over here on the right.\n\n215\n00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.620\nAnd I can continue to function.\n\n216\n00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.081\nThere's no down time at this point.\n\n217\n00:11:07.081 --> 00:11:11.548\nI still have access to the data, cuz I've\ngot a mirror, or an exact duplicate,\n\n218\n00:11:11.548 --> 00:11:13.040\nof that data.\n\n219\n00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.070\nThere's no performance benefit\nwhen it comes to write.\n\n220\n00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:19.420\nThere's a little bit of performance\nbenefit when it comes to read,\n\n221\n00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.431\nbecause I do have two copies of the data.\n\n222\n00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:25.637\nBut it's definitely not worth doing,\nmirroring a RAID 1.\n\n223\n00:11:25.637 --> 00:11:29.790\nYou're not gonna do RAID 1 to say,\nooh, I get better read speeds, right?\n\n224\n00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.146\nI mean, you do a little bit but\n\n225\n00:11:31.146 --> 00:11:33.493\nthat wouldn't be why you\nwould implement RAID 1.\n\n226\n00:11:33.493 --> 00:11:37.270\n>> Yeah, RAID 1,\nthat sucker's all about the redundancy.\n\n227\n00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:39.680\nLike Mike said, I can lose a drive.\n\n228\n00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.110\nA drive can be gone, that data can\nbe erased, it never work again.\n\n229\n00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:47.440\nDoesn't matter, I've got a copy of that\ndata, gives me another point of failure.\n\n230\n00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.431\nWhere in In the previous RAID 0,\nwe increased our points of failure.\n\n231\n00:11:51.431 --> 00:11:55.444\nHere, we are giving ourselves a fallback,\nright?\n\n232\n00:11:55.444 --> 00:11:59.370\nSo if something does happen to a drive,\nwell now it's not a big deal.\n\n233\n00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:01.211\nI have a copy of that data.\n\n234\n00:12:01.211 --> 00:12:03.880\nAnd the best part about it is,\nbecause it's built in,\n\n235\n00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.028\nit's part of the software and everything,\n\n236\n00:12:06.028 --> 00:12:09.299\nthe operating system is looking at\nthis and expects it to be there.\n\n237\n00:12:09.299 --> 00:12:11.800\nYou don't have to do anything\nspecial if you lose a drive.\n\n238\n00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:12.980\nIt just keeps rocking.\n\n239\n00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:15.890\nIt flags you and lets you know,\nhey, one of those drives are dead.\n\n240\n00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:17.850\nYou might want to do something about that.\n\n241\n00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:20.920\nBut other than that, you just keep on\nmoving along your merry little way.\n\n242\n00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:25.617\nYou could continue to bet on that other\ndrive to keep on going as long as you\n\n243\n00:12:25.617 --> 00:12:28.319\ndon't feel like changing the drive out.\n\n244\n00:12:28.319 --> 00:12:30.090\nObviously, I would say go ahead and\n\n245\n00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.873\nchange the drive out [LAUGH]\nas soon as humanly possible.\n\n246\n00:12:32.873 --> 00:12:34.220\n>> Absolutely, that's a good point.\n\n247\n00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.852\nWhat we would do in the event of\na failure of one of these drives is,\n\n248\n00:12:37.852 --> 00:12:41.964\nI would remove that failed drive,\ngo put another drive back in its place.\n\n249\n00:12:41.964 --> 00:12:45.541\nAnd the RAID system,\nwhether it's hardware or software based,\n\n250\n00:12:45.541 --> 00:12:49.063\nis gonna go about its business\nrecreating that mirror, right?\n\n251\n00:12:49.063 --> 00:12:52.397\nIt might slow your system down a little\nbit while it's doing this, but\n\n252\n00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:55.168\nit's basically gonna start\ncopying that data back over,\n\n253\n00:12:55.168 --> 00:12:58.000\nrebuilding that duplicate\ncopy on that new drive.\n\n254\n00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.620\nAnd now I'm back up and running and\nI've got my full tolerance back.\n\n255\n00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.500\nSo, it's a really good system.\n\n256\n00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:07.270\nAnd where you would see this would\nbe where your data is important.\n\n257\n00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:08.770\nWhere as RAID 0 we said,\n\n258\n00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:11.920\nyou use RAID 0 where I'm not\nworried about losing the data.\n\n259\n00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.930\nAs Daniel said, this is where you're\ngoing to use for those other drives.\n\n260\n00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:18.150\nThat system I was talking about at my\nhouse, where I've got the RAID 0 for\n\n261\n00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:22.990\nmy operating system, and I said I had\nsome 500 gig drives in there for my data.\n\n262\n00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:25.410\nThose guys were set up in a RAID 1 array.\n\n263\n00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:27.720\nSo that way, if one of those drives fails,\n\n264\n00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.660\nI didn't lose my legally\nobtained MP3 collection, right?\n\n265\n00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.500\nAnd all that good stuff.\n\n266\n00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.697\nI've got a copy of it.\n\n267\n00:13:34.697 --> 00:13:39.569\nCuz we all know mechanical drives,\nmagnetic-based mechanical drives,\n\n268\n00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:42.670\nit's not a matter if they're gonna fail.\n\n269\n00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:44.510\nIt's when are they going to fail?\n\n270\n00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:46.430\nThey might fail six\nmonths after you buy it.\n\n271\n00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:47.820\nThey might fail six years from now.\n\n272\n00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.740\nYou can get lucky on some of these and\nhave them go for a long time.\n\n273\n00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.430\nThough, we're talking about moving parts.\n\n274\n00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:58.057\nWe're talking about bearings in there, and\nthese guys are spinning around at 5,400,\n\n275\n00:13:58.057 --> 00:14:01.040\n7,200, 10,000, 15,000 RPMs.\n\n276\n00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.110\nI got this read write head floating\nmicrons above the surface.\n\n277\n00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:06.100\nThings are gonna happen.\n\n278\n00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.090\nDrives are going to fail.\n\n279\n00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:09.520\nIt's just a matter of when.\n\n280\n00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:14.590\nThis allows me to protect\nmyself against a known risk,\n\n281\n00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:18.620\na known failure that's going\nto occur at some point.\n\n282\n00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.087\nSo RAID 1 gives me that redundancy.\n\n283\n00:14:22.087 --> 00:14:25.352\nAll right, so\nthe next one up then is gonna be RAID 5.\n\n284\n00:14:25.352 --> 00:14:26.585\n>> RAID 5.\n\n285\n00:14:26.585 --> 00:14:32.327\n>> We're gonna skip two and three and\nfour, and I'll explain four.\n\n286\n00:14:32.327 --> 00:14:35.350\nTwo and three,\nI really don't even know that much about.\n\n287\n00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:38.440\nI don't know if they ever even finished or\nwere used.\n\n288\n00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.926\n>> From what I understand, a lot of\nthe RAIDs that we don't commonly see out\n\n289\n00:14:41.926 --> 00:14:44.857\nin a production environment,\nor anywhere for that matter.\n\n290\n00:14:44.857 --> 00:14:49.436\nA lot of them were either test bids for\ncreating another level of RAID, or\n\n291\n00:14:49.436 --> 00:14:51.388\nthey were very proprietary for\n\n292\n00:14:51.388 --> 00:14:55.311\nonly certain types of systems\nthat would never be in the wild.\n\n293\n00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:58.985\nThey would be only for those systems\nbecause that company developed it for\n\n294\n00:14:58.985 --> 00:15:00.593\nthe systems that they created.\n\n295\n00:15:00.593 --> 00:15:01.711\nSo that's why we don't see a lot of them.\n\n296\n00:15:01.711 --> 00:15:06.223\n>> Optimized for that particular scenario\nof environment of something like that.\n\n297\n00:15:06.223 --> 00:15:08.522\nAll right, so RAID 5,\nlet's pull up my screen here.\n\n298\n00:15:08.522 --> 00:15:14.252\nRAID 5 is striping, which we've\nalready seen with RAID 0, right?\n\n299\n00:15:14.252 --> 00:15:17.730\nBut didn't give me any fault tolerance,\nthere was no redundancy.\n\n300\n00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:21.290\nWell, RAID 5 is stripping with parody.\n\n301\n00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:24.106\nParody is gonna give me redundancy.\n\n302\n00:15:24.106 --> 00:15:28.894\nAnd basically, parody is information about\nthe data is a simple way to look at it.\n\n303\n00:15:28.894 --> 00:15:32.267\nAnd what I've got here with RAID 5,\nlet's back up to make sure.\n\n304\n00:15:32.267 --> 00:15:36.364\nI've forgot to mention, RAID 0,\nRAID 1, minimum of two disks.\n\n305\n00:15:36.364 --> 00:15:39.220\nI can't really create a stripe\nwith one drive, right?\n\n306\n00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:41.516\nSo I gotta have at least two\ndrives to create that stripe.\n\n307\n00:15:41.516 --> 00:15:44.822\nI've gotta have at least two\ndrives to create that mirror.\n\n308\n00:15:44.822 --> 00:15:49.129\nDepending on your operating system or how\nyou're implementing it, Implementing it\n\n309\n00:15:49.129 --> 00:15:53.870\nmight change your maximum number of drives\nthat are supported, but two's a minimum.\n\n310\n00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:57.980\nRAID 5 however, has a three disc minimum,\nand that's because of this\n\n311\n00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:02.220\nparity information that's gonna be\ninterspersed amongst your data.\n\n312\n00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:08.530\nAs it stripes across these drives,\nyou see A1, A2, A3, A parity,\n\n313\n00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:14.410\nA4, then, it goes back and writes\nthe next stripe, B1, 2, parity, B3, B4.\n\n314\n00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:19.340\nAnd then again for the next drive,\nC1, parity, C2, 3,\n\n315\n00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:23.050\n4, and so on and so on, all right.\n\n316\n00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:26.720\nThe parity, again,\nis what gives me the redundancy.\n\n317\n00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:32.185\nWhat's really cool is if I were\nto lose one of these drives.\n\n318\n00:16:32.185 --> 00:16:35.965\n[NOISE] All right, it's gone, it fails.\n\n319\n00:16:35.965 --> 00:16:40.370\nMy system can still run,\neven though some of the data's missing,\n\n320\n00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:44.790\nright, A3 is missing, C2 is missing,\nthat data's just gone.\n\n321\n00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:48.830\nThere's no mirror, that data doesn't\nreside anywhere else except for\n\n322\n00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:50.240\non that failed drive.\n\n323\n00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:54.210\nBut from the parity that's\nleft on the remaining drives,\n\n324\n00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:57.550\nit can figure out what\nthe missing data is.\n\n325\n00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:59.380\nI mean just like poof, right.\n\n326\n00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:02.340\nI know the first time I learned about this\nlike, what do you mean it can Figure out\n\n327\n00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:06.370\nwhat, the data's got algorithms that\nit can look at, using that parity and\n\n328\n00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:10.950\nit can figure out what ones and\nzeros are missing from that data stripe.\n\n329\n00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:14.265\nTo me it's magical,\nit's pretty mind-blowing.\n\n330\n00:17:14.265 --> 00:17:16.030\nBut it's very cool and\n\n331\n00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:19.550\nvery useful because, think about this,\nwe're striping right?\n\n332\n00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:23.370\nWe talked about the advantage of a stripe,\nperformance.\n\n333\n00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:25.110\nIn this case I've got five drives and\n\n334\n00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:29.020\nI'm spreading that write operation\nacross five read write heads.\n\n335\n00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:33.130\nSo I'm definitely gonna get\na boost in my right performance.\n\n336\n00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:36.790\nNot as much as a straight up stripe\nbecause I do have to spend time\n\n337\n00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:39.850\ncalculating and\nwriting this parity information, but\n\n338\n00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:42.220\nI do get a right performance.\n\n339\n00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:46.310\nAnd I definitely get redundancy because\nas you can see, or as I just told you,\n\n340\n00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:50.050\nI could lose that drive and\nit would still function.\n\n341\n00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:52.420\nNow it's not gonna function at top speed.\n\n342\n00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.130\nIt's not even gonna be close.\n\n343\n00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:58.550\nIt's gonna slow down, but\nthe point is I haven't lost my data and\n\n344\n00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:03.410\nthat gives me time to go in and\nreplace that drive, and\n\n345\n00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:06.960\nit will start rebuilding from\nthe parity left on the other drive,\n\n346\n00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.430\nit will start rebuilding and\nreplacing that missing information.\n\n347\n00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:14.270\nAnd again, that can take some time\ndepending on how big that stripe is,\n\n348\n00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:18.120\nhow many gigs of data are in that stripe.\n\n349\n00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.860\nBut I'm okay with that,\nrather than lose all of that data, right?\n\n350\n00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.970\nThat's what RAID 5 is all about,\nstriping with parity.\n\n351\n00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:27.990\nAnd it's important to understand\nthat the parity is interspersed,\n\n352\n00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:31.200\nor dispersed across multiple drives there.\n\n353\n00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:35.750\nRAID 4, one we didn't talk about,\nwas actually striping with parity, but\n\n354\n00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:38.510\nall the parity was on a single drive,\nall right?\n\n355\n00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:41.890\nAnd they found for performance\nreasons that didn’t work out too well.\n\n356\n00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:46.200\nThat parody drive was taken\na lot of hits calculating and\n\n357\n00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:50.933\nwriting parody information and they found\nit was much better performance if they\n\n358\n00:18:50.933 --> 00:18:55.759\nspread that parity out, so RAID 4, I'd\nnever saw it in the wild or in production.\n\n359\n00:18:55.759 --> 00:18:56.900\nI'm sure it was, or\n\n360\n00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:00.900\nmaybe they tested it just said we're\ngonna scrap that one and move on.\n\n361\n00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.950\nSo RAID5, striping with parity.\n\n362\n00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:06.040\nI can handle a single disk failure.\n\n363\n00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:12.323\nSo I could lose this disk again,\n[SOUND] and I could survive.\n\n364\n00:19:12.323 --> 00:19:17.288\nIf I lose one more drive,\nthough, all right, I'm done.\n\n365\n00:19:17.288 --> 00:19:21.820\nI can only handle a single drive failure,\nand that's why with RAID 5,\n\n366\n00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:26.590\nwhen one of those drives goes bad, you\nneed to get another drive in there soon,\n\n367\n00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:30.920\nbecause now you're just riding on\nthin ice or walking on thin ice.\n\n368\n00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.370\nIf you've got four drives left,\nany one of those four drives,\n\n369\n00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:37.480\nfour points of failure now\ncould cost me all of my data,\n\n370\n00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:41.490\nand it's most likely a large volume if\nyou've got it spread across five drives.\n\n371\n00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:42.030\nRight?\n\n372\n00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:46.620\nSo you do not want to waste any\ntime replacing those drives.\n\n373\n00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:50.930\nMake sure you get it back in there as\nsoon as possible and that's RAID 5.\n\n374\n00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:53.510\n>> Yeah, I think the technical term for\n\n375\n00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:58.140\nRAID 5 is striping with distributed\nparity and you gotta throw up your pinky\n\n376\n00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.022\nfinger up in the air when you say that\ncuz it makes it sound more official.\n\n377\n00:20:01.022 --> 00:20:01.810\n>> Absolutely [LAUGH].\n\n378\n00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:03.728\n>> Throw a British accent on\nthere if you do that too.\n\n379\n00:20:03.728 --> 00:20:07.970\nThat's right, because it's distributing\nthat load across those different drives\n\n380\n00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:11.110\ninstead of doing like old RAID\n4 where it's just on one drive.\n\n381\n00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:14.470\nAnd they said, hey you know, I think I've\ngot a better idea make this run work\n\n382\n00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:16.610\na little bit better for us,\nand they surely did that.\n\n383\n00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:21.760\nYou'll see RAID 5 in a lot of places,\nit's a very, very common RAID level.\n\n384\n00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:25.260\n>> And one more thing I wanna mention\nabout RAID 5 is the amount of space that\n\n385\n00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:25.970\nyou're gaining.\n\n386\n00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:27.520\nAnd let's go back and look at RAID 0 and\n\n387\n00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:31.820\nRAID 1 as well, cuz that's something else\nthey could possibly ask you on the exam.\n\n388\n00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:36.557\nWith RAID 0, it's a stripe volume, so\nif each one of these were, let's say for\n\n389\n00:20:36.557 --> 00:20:40.280\nnice round numbers, we'll say 10GB drives.\n\n390\n00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:44.590\nWhen I stripe,\nI'm going to have 20GB of usable space.\n\n391\n00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:48.690\nTwo 10GB drives,\nI get to use all of that space.\n\n392\n00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:53.230\nRAID 1, because I'm writing the exact\nsame amount of data to the other drive,\n\n393\n00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:54.970\nI got two ten gigabyte drives.\n\n394\n00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:56.490\nI got 20 gigs of total space.\n\n395\n00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:59.410\nI've only got ten gigs of usable space,\n\n396\n00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:03.830\nbecause I have to have enough space\nto make an exact copy of that data.\n\n397\n00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:08.830\nSo I'm losing half of my storage\nspace when I set up RAID 1.\n\n398\n00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:11.380\nIt's worth it for the redundancy,\ntypically, all right?\n\n399\n00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:13.350\nBut remember,\nyou're losing half of your space,\n\n400\n00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:16.580\nso that means you gotta buy\ntwice as many drives, right?\n\n401\n00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:20.844\nIf you're planning out how much space you\nneed, and you say okay, we're gonna need\n\n402\n00:21:20.844 --> 00:21:25.160\nfour4 terabytes of space, and I wanna do\nit in RAID 1, well you got to go out and\n\n403\n00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:30.240\nbuy eight terabytes worth of drive right,\nto get four terabytes of space.\n\n404\n00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:34.360\nWith RAID 5 it’s a weird way\nit works out to be one drive.\n\n405\n00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:39.510\nThe size of those stripes across\nthose drives has to be equal so\n\n406\n00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:41.216\nif this is ten gigabytes, this is ten,\n\n407\n00:21:41.216 --> 00:21:46.560\nthese are all going to be ten gigabytes\nand you lose one drives worth.\n\n408\n00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:50.690\nSo, the more drives you put in a RAID\n5 array, the more efficient it is.\n\n409\n00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:54.230\nIf I got three ten gigabyte drives,\nthat's thirty gigs total,\n\n410\n00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:58.780\nI only get to use twenty gigs of usable\nspace, one drive is lost for parity.\n\n411\n00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:00.500\nIf I've got five drives,\n\n412\n00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:05.280\nthat's fifty gigs, I lose one,\nI've got forty gigs of useable space.\n\n413\n00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:08.370\nSo the percentage of\nuseable space increases\n\n414\n00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:11.770\nas I add additional drives\nto that RAID 5 array.\n\n415\n00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:15.410\n>> Right, if it's three drives,\nyou lose a third, if it's five drives,\n\n416\n00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:16.740\nyou lose a fifth, and so on and so forth.\n\n417\n00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.190\n>> Yep, exactly right.\n\n418\n00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:21.470\nAll right, then we move on into the big,\nbad boy of RAID.\n\n419\n00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:24.140\nAnd that is gonna be RAID one plus zero,\n\n420\n00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:28.360\nor RAID ten as I like to call it,\nor a stripe of mirrors.\n\n421\n00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.680\nThat sounds like a TV show-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n422\n00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:31.520\n>> We could produce maybe.\n\n423\n00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:32.140\nGame of Thrones.\n\n424\n00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:33.830\n>> Welcome to a stripe of mirrors.\n\n425\n00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:35.035\n>> Stripe of mirrors, yeah.\n\n426\n00:22:35.035 --> 00:22:36.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I like it.\n\n427\n00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.880\nSo RAID 10 is really\na combination of RAID.\n\n428\n00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.360\nWhat you can see is I've\ngot two RAID 1 arrays.\n\n429\n00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.430\nI've got two mirrored sets here.\n\n430\n00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:48.370\nData is duplicated across these two guys.\n\n431\n00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:52.710\nData is duplicated here and\nthen it's striped across the whole thing.\n\n432\n00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:56.720\nSo basically what's happening is as I\nstripe that data, I'm gonna write it here,\n\n433\n00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:00.860\ngo over to here and write the exact\nsame thing, go over here and write\n\n434\n00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:04.660\nthe remainder of that stripe over here,\nand write the exact same thing again.\n\n435\n00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:09.240\nSo I'm creating a stripe, but each part\nof the stripe is getting written twice.\n\n436\n00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:13.190\nSo I mirrored my stripe, if you will.\n\n437\n00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:15.750\nIt's kind of twisty in\nthe brain to think about.\n\n438\n00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:17.015\n>> You just striped your mirrors.\n\n439\n00:23:17.015 --> 00:23:20.260\n[LAUGH].\n>> I striped my mirrors, exactly.\n\n440\n00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:23.850\nAnd what's really twisty is you\ncan also mirror your stripes.\n\n441\n00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:27.730\nThere is a RAID zero plus one,\nwhich would reverse this.\n\n442\n00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:32.015\nThe bottom set would be stripes, and then\nI would just mirror the entire stripe set.\n\n443\n00:23:32.015 --> 00:23:33.540\n[LAUGH] I know.\n\n444\n00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:35.280\nYou would know?\n\n445\n00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.501\n>> It gets fun,\ndoesn't it ladies and gentlemen?\n\n446\n00:23:37.501 --> 00:23:38.001\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n447\n00:23:38.001 --> 00:23:39.361\nI don't know how to make that\n\n448\n00:23:39.361 --> 00:23:42.401\nany less complicated.\nIt makes my brain hurt looking at it.\n\n449\n00:23:42.401 --> 00:23:44.558\nBut it's okay, because this exam,\n\n450\n00:23:44.558 --> 00:23:47.025\nhere's what you need to know.\nRAID 10,\n\n451\n00:23:47.025 --> 00:23:51.250\nRAID one plus zero is the combination\nof RAID 1 mirrored, or I mean stripes,\n\n452\n00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:55.654\nsee I get confused even saying it.\nSo it's two mirrored sets, RAID 1,\n\n453\n00:23:55.654 --> 00:24:00.606\nRAID 1, and then we're gonna stripe\nacross those two mirrored sets, and\n\n454\n00:24:00.606 --> 00:24:02.806\nthat gives you the RAID 10, and\n\n455\n00:24:02.806 --> 00:24:08.154\nreally you're getting decent performance\nout of this, cuz you are striping and\n\n456\n00:24:08.154 --> 00:24:10.681\nyou're getting redundancy.\nAt this point,\n\n457\n00:24:10.681 --> 00:24:12.480\nI could lose this drive, right?\n\n458\n00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:16.380\nLet me get through to that.\n\n459\n00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.760\nAnd I’m still good to go because I’ve\ngot an exact copy of it over here.\n\n460\n00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.330\nI could lose this drive and\n\n461\n00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:25.940\nI’m still good to go because I\nstill have all of my data, right?\n\n462\n00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:29.540\nBut it I lose two drives\nin the same mirrored set,\n\n463\n00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:32.520\nthat's when I have a problem.\n\n464\n00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:33.090\nAll right?\n\n465\n00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:34.280\nSo it is kinda weird.\n\n466\n00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.060\nYou can lose more than one drive, but\n\n467\n00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:41.470\nit kinda depends on which drive it is when\nwe're talking about losing those guys.\n\n468\n00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:43.020\nAnd that is RAID 10.\n\n469\n00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:46.150\nAll right, and those are really the only\nones that you have to worry about.\n\n470\n00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:48.190\nIf you go out and do your research.\n\n471\n00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:51.580\nAs Daniel and I said,\nyou're gonna see those other RAID levels.\n\n472\n00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:52.890\nI wouldn't worry about those right now.\n\n473\n00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:57.390\nFor this exam,\nfocus in on these four types of RAID and\n\n474\n00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:00.160\nyou should be good to go,\nand don't dive so\n\n475\n00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:05.020\ndeep into RAID 10 that you're reading\nRFC's, understand the basics of it.\n\n476\n00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:08.450\nI mean, when you start looking at the\nformulas that they use to calculate this\n\n477\n00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:10.110\nstuff out.\n\n478\n00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:14.510\nI'm gonna have to go call Stephen Hawking\nand get him in here to explain this stuff.\n\n479\n00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:15.620\nIt's pretty impressive.\n\n480\n00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:17.720\nBut we don't have to deal with that,\nthankfully.\n\n481\n00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:20.560\nAll right.\nSo the next thing we wanna talk about then\n\n482\n00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:25.540\nis hardware versus software raiding as\nraid can be implemented in different ways.\n\n483\n00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:28.930\nI can go out and\nI can buy a raid controller.\n\n484\n00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:33.270\nIt's an expansion card that I can\nput in my machine, my server, or\n\n485\n00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:37.990\nmy client and all the drives\nattached to that expansion card and\n\n486\n00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:40.630\nthat expansion card has the chips and\nthe controllers.\n\n487\n00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:42.380\nAnd that's what's gonna be doing the raid.\n\n488\n00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:46.340\nThe operating system sends it over to the\ncontroller, the controller then takes care\n\n489\n00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:50.110\nof splitting the data to the multiple\ndrives and handling the parody and\n\n490\n00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:52.280\nall of those operations there.\n\n491\n00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:56.930\nSo, it's a very good solution when\nperformance is important, right?\n\n492\n00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:00.270\nBecause I'm not demanding\nanything of the operating system.\n\n493\n00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:02.660\nThe controller is doing all of the work.\n\n494\n00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:06.670\nBut we can do software based raid,\nwhich would save me some bucks.\n\n495\n00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:10.420\nBecause I don't have to go out and buy\none of those expensive raid controllers.\n\n496\n00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:15.350\nBut it also means my operating system now\nhas to deal with the operation of raid.\n\n497\n00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:20.320\nIt has to take care of splitting the data\nbetween the drives and things like that.\n\n498\n00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.870\nSo it's a trade off.\n\n499\n00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:24.630\nRight, it's a little less expensive\nto go with software based rate.\n\n500\n00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:28.150\nYou're also not going to get\nthe same performance that you would\n\n501\n00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:31.210\nversus say a hardware based rate.\n\n502\n00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:33.340\nSo now let's take a look at\nhow we could do some rate.\n\n503\n00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:35.780\nI've got a server 2008\nmachine sitting here.\n\n504\n00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:38.340\nAnd I've tossed a few\nextra drives in here.\n\n505\n00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:39.950\nAnd the first thing I'm going to do.\n\n506\n00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:41.297\nWe'll create a couple.\n\n507\n00:26:41.297 --> 00:26:43.141\nWe'll do a Raid 0 and a Raid 1.\n\n508\n00:26:43.141 --> 00:26:45.615\nAnd we'll try to do even a Raid 5,\nif we can.\n\n509\n00:26:45.615 --> 00:26:46.647\nSo [INAUDIBLE].\n>> First of all, Mike.\n\n510\n00:26:46.647 --> 00:26:48.035\n>> Yes?\n>> How do we get to this screen?\n\n511\n00:26:48.035 --> 00:26:48.820\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh, I don't know.\n\n512\n00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:49.980\nIt was just on my computer.\n\n513\n00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:50.820\n>> It just showed up.\n\n514\n00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:51.490\n>> It was just there.\n\n515\n00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:53.215\n>> Mike said, computer, show me the disks.\n\n516\n00:26:53.215 --> 00:26:54.610\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n517\n00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:55.160\nYes, Siri.\n\n518\n00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.490\nI mean, no, no, wait, wait, Cortona.\n\n519\n00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:57.520\nNo, wait, wait.\n\n520\n00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:58.520\nNothing in 2008, sorry.\n\n521\n00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:59.670\n>> That's right.\n\n522\n00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:01.430\n>> So\nwhat I did was I went to my Start Menu and\n\n523\n00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:05.900\nthen Administrative Tools and\nthen Computer Management.\n\n524\n00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:09.750\nThen from Computer Management I\ncan go down to Disc Management.\n\n525\n00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:14.390\nThere's also an MMC or a snap-in so\nyou can create your own custom console for\n\n526\n00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:17.200\nthis that didn't have all\nthe other tools in it as well.\n\n527\n00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:21.360\nAnd then I'm gonna just drag this up\na wee bit, give me a little more room for\n\n528\n00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.290\nmy graphical part down here.\n\n529\n00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:28.020\nSo we got these three drives you can\nsee 20 gigs each unallocated space, and\n\n530\n00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:29.870\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna click on this drive and\n\n531\n00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:32.690\nI'm gonna choose a new striped volume.\n\n532\n00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:34.000\nLook, it's right there in my list.\n\n533\n00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.953\nI've got stripe,\nwhich is gonna be my RAID 0.\n\n534\n00:27:36.953 --> 00:27:39.987\nI've got mirror,\nwhich is gonna be my RAID 1 and\n\n535\n00:27:39.987 --> 00:27:43.320\nthen I've got RAID 5 through\nthe operating system.\n\n536\n00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.670\nI cannot do RAID 10.\n\n537\n00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:46.195\nAll right?\nYou're going to have to get\n\n538\n00:27:46.195 --> 00:27:47.402\na controller to do that.\n\n539\n00:27:47.402 --> 00:27:48.730\nSo, I'm going to do striped volume.\n\n540\n00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:51.400\nNow the first thing it's probably going\nto tell me is, well, maybe it'll wait\n\n541\n00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:56.310\nto the end of the wizard, is it's going to\nconvert my drives from basic to dynamic.\n\n542\n00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:59.440\nYou can only do these types of\nvolumes on dynamic volumes.\n\n543\n00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:02.640\nGot another episode, I'll teach you\nall about those dynamic volumes, so,\n\n544\n00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.420\nit seems I've got one disk.\n\n545\n00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:05.670\nThat's the one I right-clicked on.\n\n546\n00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:09.120\nBut, if I want to do a stripe,\nI need a minimum of two drives so\n\n547\n00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.990\nI'm going to grab another one of\nmy drives and add that over there.\n\n548\n00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:16.170\nNotice that before I did that,\nmy next button is grayed out.\n\n549\n00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:19.410\nCan't very well make\na stripe with one drive.\n\n550\n00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:21.350\nI could add a third drive if I wanted.\n\n551\n00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.990\nHeck, why don't we.\n\n552\n00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:23.603\nWe'll go ahead and add it in there anyway.\n\n553\n00:28:23.603 --> 00:28:26.981\nAnd notice that I've got 60 gigs total.\n\n554\n00:28:26.981 --> 00:28:33.349\nThe amount of space that in megabytes\nthat I want to create there, maximum 61.\n\n555\n00:28:33.349 --> 00:28:36.460\nSo I can use all the space\nI have to create this.\n\n556\n00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:37.310\nNow I'm gonna keep it short and\n\n557\n00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:40.410\nsweet because I don't want this to\ntake all day trying to create it.\n\n558\n00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:44.970\nI'm just gonna do a 500\nmegabyte stripe there.\n\n559\n00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:49.680\nSo I'll get about a little over a gig,\na gig and a half, of usable space there.\n\n560\n00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.190\nI'll click Next.\n\n561\n00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:53.690\nI'll give it a drive letter for my stripe.\n\n562\n00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:55.037\nLet's choose S.\n\n563\n00:28:55.037 --> 00:28:56.257\nIsn't that clever?\n\n564\n00:28:56.257 --> 00:28:58.190\n>> I like that.\n>> [LAUGH] And we'll click Next.\n\n565\n00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:02.640\nAnd I'm gonna give it\na label of striped as well.\n\n566\n00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:07.450\nI'll do a quick format, and\nI'll click next, and finish.\n\n567\n00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:10.080\nAnd now it's gonna tell me it's gonna\nconvert those over to dynamic disks.\n\n568\n00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.140\nI can't use basic disk for\nthis type of volume.\n\n569\n00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:14.530\nAnd it's gonna go ahead and\nconvert them first.\n\n570\n00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:17.570\nYou'll actually see them\nchange to dynamic over here.\n\n571\n00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:20.090\nAnd then it's gonna go ahead and\ncreate my stripe set.\n\n572\n00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:22.900\nOnce it does that,\nassigns the drive letter.\n\n573\n00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:24.300\nEverything's looking healthy.\n\n574\n00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.550\nI open up File Explorer.\n\n575\n00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:29.640\nThere's my S, and\nI can make my nice new folder out here.\n\n576\n00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.910\nI call it striped just for giggles.\n\n577\n00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:34.520\nSo that was that easy.\n\n578\n00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.390\nNow let's take a look at a mirror.\n\n579\n00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:38.710\nI'm gonna right click.\n\n580\n00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:40.400\nI'm gonna choose new mirrored volume.\n\n581\n00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:43.070\nI'll click next.\n\n582\n00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:46.100\nI can't click next again, because I\ndon't have a second drive in there.\n\n583\n00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:46.940\nI'm gonna add that.\n\n584\n00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:50.610\nAnd for this one,\nnotice even though I've got.\n\n585\n00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:52.169\nWhat is that?\n20, 20,\n\n586\n00:29:52.169 --> 00:29:56.000\n40 gigs of space maximum size is 20 right?\n\n587\n00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.880\nBecause I’ve got to\nduplicate all of that data.\n\n588\n00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.230\nI’m going to do the same thing,\nI’m going to do 500 but\n\n589\n00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:04.840\nthis time I’m only going to have\n500 megabytes of usable space.\n\n590\n00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:07.550\nI'll click next, and for this one,\n\n591\n00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:11.390\nguess what drive letter we're gonna use,\nI say an M for mirror.\n\n592\n00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:18.090\nWe'll call it mirrored,\nquick format, next, finish.\n\n593\n00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:20.240\nDoesn't have to convert,\nit already converted them.\n\n594\n00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.850\nAnd there goes my mirrored volume.\n\n595\n00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:26.692\nAnd if I pop open file explorer,\nthere's my mirrored volume, and\n\n596\n00:30:26.692 --> 00:30:30.321\nI can make a new folder on here and\nI can call it, for\n\n597\n00:30:30.321 --> 00:30:33.629\nlack of creativity, mirrored, all right.\n\n598\n00:30:33.629 --> 00:30:37.963\nAnd then the last one we're going to try\nto create here is going to be a RAID 5, so\n\n599\n00:30:37.963 --> 00:30:39.993\nwe'll go down to new RAID 5 volume.\n\n600\n00:30:39.993 --> 00:30:43.780\nAnd I'll tell you this sometimes doesn't\nwork so well in Windows, RAID 5.\n\n601\n00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:46.710\nI've had trouble with it personally, and\n\n602\n00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:49.450\nthat's why I say we're\ngonna try to do this.\n\n603\n00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:53.910\nSo there again I've got 60 gigs of space,\nnotice I'm only gonna get about 40 gigs of\n\n604\n00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:57.330\nusable space, that's that one third\nrule cuz I've got three drives,\n\n605\n00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:00.720\nI'm gonna go with 500 so\nwe can kinda compare apples to apples.\n\n606\n00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.360\nNotice this one I get 1,000.\n\n607\n00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:03.750\nOne third, right?\n\n608\n00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:05.650\nWhereas the stripe, I got all of it.\n\n609\n00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:07.000\nFor the mirror, I only got half of it.\n\n610\n00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.320\nThis is one third.\n\n611\n00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:09.900\nClick Next.\n\n612\n00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.290\nWe'll call this, wait there's no five.\n\n613\n00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:15.205\nWe'll do-\n>> R?\n\n614\n00:31:15.205 --> 00:31:18.170\n>> A P for parody,\nbecause we're throwing parody in there.\n\n615\n00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:19.490\nThat's what I'll do.\n\n616\n00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:25.960\nAnd now we'll call this parity,\nquick format, next, finish.\n\n617\n00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:27.690\nKeep your fingers crossed.\n\n618\n00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:28.860\n[LAUGH] And there we go.\n\n619\n00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:30.590\nBeautiful.\nLook at that nice color\n\n620\n00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:32.230\ncoding that it gives me there.\n\n621\n00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:34.640\nI open up File Explorer,\nthere's my parody volume.\n\n622\n00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:37.350\nI'm going to create a new folder here.\n\n623\n00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:41.166\nAnd we're gonna call it parody.\n\n624\n00:31:41.166 --> 00:31:43.020\nAll right, so, easy enough to make them.\n\n625\n00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:47.426\nLast thing I wanna show you, and I promise\nI'll stop talking, is drive failures.\n\n626\n00:31:47.426 --> 00:31:48.727\nOkay?\nLet's see what's happening.\n\n627\n00:31:48.727 --> 00:31:50.920\nWe're gonna simulate a drive failure.\n\n628\n00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.302\nI'm gonna take this drive.\n\n629\n00:31:52.302 --> 00:31:57.341\nThis Disk 2 has part of the stripe on it,\nand it has half of the mirror on it.\n\n630\n00:31:57.341 --> 00:31:59.312\nAnd it has part of my RAID 5 on it.\n\n631\n00:31:59.312 --> 00:32:01.450\nSo I'm gonna take that\none out of the picture.\n\n632\n00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:03.820\nI'm gonna go offline with that drive.\n\n633\n00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:08.000\nAnd you'll see all kinds of\ncrazy things happen down here.\n\n634\n00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.430\nLet me just drag that up just a wee bit.\n\n635\n00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:14.210\nIf I can get my mouse to play along,\nall right?\n\n636\n00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:16.800\nSo Disk 2 is now listed as offline.\n\n637\n00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.819\nAnd it also shows it a second\ntime as missing, right,\n\n638\n00:32:19.819 --> 00:32:21.977\nit doesn't know where this has gone.\n\n639\n00:32:21.977 --> 00:32:25.690\nYou can see I've got a little\nexclamation point here on Disk 3.\n\n640\n00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:30.940\nAnd notice my stripe is listed as failed,\nright, it says it can't.\n\n641\n00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:33.548\nRemember with the stripe, if you lose\nany drive that's part of the stripe,\n\n642\n00:32:33.548 --> 00:32:35.055\nyou lose the entire stripe.\n\n643\n00:32:35.055 --> 00:32:37.150\nMirrored says failed redundancy, but\n\n644\n00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:40.798\ndoesn't say anything about losing\nmy data or failed the parity.\n\n645\n00:32:40.798 --> 00:32:44.610\nSo it has failed redundancy, but it\ndoesn't say anything about losing my data.\n\n646\n00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:45.725\nLet's see what happens.\n\n647\n00:32:45.725 --> 00:32:49.946\nIf we go back over here,\nsure enough Mirrored is still there,\n\n648\n00:32:49.946 --> 00:32:52.180\nmy folder is still there.\n\n649\n00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:55.963\nI could, can I do this in Windows?\n\n650\n00:32:55.963 --> 00:32:57.640\nLet's see, oops.\n\n651\n00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.900\nWe could, well, I can still write to it.\n\n652\n00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:02.840\nThat's what I was trying to show you,\nI can still write to it.\n\n653\n00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.050\nI can make a new folder there.\n\n654\n00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:07.990\nI can go to my Parity,\nI can make a new folder here.\n\n655\n00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:09.900\nThey're all still chugging right along,\nright?\n\n656\n00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:12.140\nEverything's working just\nfine with those guys.\n\n657\n00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:16.810\nBecause those are two types of RAID that\ngive me redundancy or fault tolerance.\n\n658\n00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:19.270\nThe stripe, however, is gone.\n\n659\n00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:22.990\nIf the drive hadn't failed,\nif it was a cable, or something like that,\n\n660\n00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:25.100\nwe can bring that guy back online.\n\n661\n00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:26.690\nAnd let's see what happens.\n\n662\n00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:28.375\nMy stripe comes back to life.\n\n663\n00:33:28.375 --> 00:33:32.981\nAnd if we give it a minute, we should\nsee that the mirror, it might happen so\n\n664\n00:33:32.981 --> 00:33:34.680\nfast that we don't see it.\n\n665\n00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.979\nLet's see if I can refresh here.\n\n666\n00:33:36.979 --> 00:33:38.700\nSo my stripe is already healthy again.\n\n667\n00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:42.220\nA lot of times, what you would see in the\nreal world on that mirror is it would say\n\n668\n00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:47.110\nrebuilding or something like that,\nas it reconstructs that.\n\n669\n00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:48.330\nWith one folder on there and\n\n670\n00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:51.130\nnothing in it,\nit's going to pretty much instantaneous.\n\n671\n00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:54.860\nAnd as soon as this thing refreshes,\nit'll probably just say Healthy again.\n\n672\n00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:58.220\nBut in the real world, if you ever see\nthat happening, or you come in here and\n\n673\n00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:02.160\nthe status says rebuilding,\nyou know that the drives have replaced and\n\n674\n00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.960\nit's trying to come back to life.\n\n675\n00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:08.610\nSo there you have a good look at how we\ncan do those software-based RAID levels\n\n676\n00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:10.200\nright there within our operating system.\n\n677\n00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:12.380\n>> Excellent demonstration,\nMike, and thank you for that.\n\n678\n00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:13.390\nIt was awesome.\n\n679\n00:34:13.390 --> 00:34:15.716\nAs you can see, it wasn't very\ndifficult to set this stuff up.\n\n680\n00:34:15.716 --> 00:34:19.110\nYou just get in the server,\nuse the tools that are built into it, and\n\n681\n00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:20.850\nchoose the type of RAID\nthat's gonna help you out.\n\n682\n00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:21.365\nSo now,\n\n683\n00:34:21.365 --> 00:34:23.971\nnot only do we know how to kill bugs dead-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n684\n00:34:23.971 --> 00:34:26.133\n>> We have a great storage solution for\n\n685\n00:34:26.133 --> 00:34:27.001\nus, as well.\n\n686\n00:34:27.001 --> 00:34:29.636\nAll right everyone, looks like we've come\nto the end of another great episode.\n\n687\n00:34:29.636 --> 00:34:30.586\nI hope you enjoyed it.\n\n688\n00:34:30.586 --> 00:34:33.085\nThanks for watching,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n689\n00:34:33.085 --> 00:34:33.925\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n690\n00:34:33.925 --> 00:34:36.850\n>> And we'll see you next

great episode of\nITpro.tv I'm your host Daniel Lowry here\n\n4\n00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.711\nwith me yet again, that's right the\nkeyboard cowboy himself, Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:23.560\nHow's it going Mike?\n\n6\n00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.801\n>> Yehaw.\n>> That's right.\n\n7\n00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:27.230\n>> I'm doing great Daniel,\nglad to be here.\n\n8\n00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.141\nExcited with our good old MTA content.\n\n9\n00:00:30.141 --> 00:00:34.060\nAnd with this one we are going\nto be looking at Disk types.\n\n10\n00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.700\nIn another episode we talked\nabout different levels of rate.\n\n11\n00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.490\nNow we gotta look at Disk types.\n\n12\n00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.930\nAnd it's something that we\ngotta be familiar with this.\n\n13\n00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.270\nAs we were talking between the break,\n\n14\n00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.650\nstorage is a very important\npart of our enterprise today.\n\n15\n00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.610\nWe've got tons and tons of data.\n\n16\n00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.120\nSo, we've gotta make sure we understand\nall the different options that we have\n\n17\n00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.950\nwhen it comes to storing our data.\n\n18\n00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.730\n>> That's right, we're gonna be looking\nat file systems, and mount points, and.\n\n19\n00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.784\n>> Optical drives and\nthis, that, and the other.\n\n20\n00:00:58.784 --> 00:01:02.590\nMight be a little bit of oh, okay,\nyou're starting to scare me here.\n\n21\n00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.950\nBut, by the end of the show you should\nbe like okay, that's not that bad.\n\n22\n00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.220\nThat's the goal anyway, right, Mike?\n\n23\n00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.440\n>> What's mount point?\n\n24\n00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.145\nOh no, I'm just kidding.\n\n25\n00:01:11.145 --> 00:01:12.230\n[LAUGH]\n>> We know.\n\n26\n00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.786\nWe swear.\n\n27\n00:01:12.786 --> 00:01:14.142\n[LAUGH]\n>> Google.\n\n28\n00:01:14.142 --> 00:01:15.480\n[LAUGH]\n>> That being said.\n\n29\n00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.703\n>> Let me bing that real quick.\n\n30\n00:01:17.703 --> 00:01:19.984\n[LAUGH] These are easy.\n\n31\n00:01:19.984 --> 00:01:22.134\nCut to Michael!\n[LAUGH]\n\n32\n00:01:22.134 --> 00:01:23.905\n>> Yeah we're gonna learn all about this\n\n33\n00:01:23.905 --> 00:01:26.837\ngood stuff as Daniel said we've\ngot a few different things that\n\n34\n00:01:26.837 --> 00:01:29.769\nwe're gonna go over and\nthe first thing that we wanna talk about\n\n35\n00:01:29.769 --> 00:01:33.418\nis file systems right because if we take\na hard drive and slap it in our machine,\n\n36\n00:01:33.418 --> 00:01:35.470\nit doesn't do us any good until we've.\n\n37\n00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.650\nFormatted that drive.\n\n38\n00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.580\nWe've got to lay down a file system.\n\n39\n00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.880\nAnd a file system is\nbasically the rules for\n\n40\n00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.620\nhow I'm gonna store data on that drive.\n\n41\n00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.140\nAnd the file system can actually\nbring along features, as well,\n\n42\n00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.160\nlike NTFS, the file system of\nchoice in a Windows environment.\n\n43\n00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.100\nBrings along EFS,\nmy encrypting file system, and file and\n\n44\n00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.030\nfolder level security.\n\n45\n00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.260\nMost of these modern file systems provide\nsome type of journaling capabilities where\n\n46\n00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.190\nit helps with disk errors and\nthings like that.\n\n47\n00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.525\nSo, the file system that\nyou choose is important.\n\n48\n00:02:09.525 --> 00:02:11.307\nThey also have limitations,\n\n49\n00:02:11.307 --> 00:02:15.725\nsome of the older file systems they're\nlimited to the maximum file size,\n\n50\n00:02:15.725 --> 00:02:19.590\nmaximum volume size, so\nwe've got a few things to think about.\n\n51\n00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.210\nAnd on the exam they just say file systems\nand I'm going to talk about the common\n\n52\n00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.800\nWindows one and\na couple others that you see out there.\n\n53\n00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.520\nNTFS, my new technology file system is.\n\n54\n00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.450\nIt's not new.\n\n55\n00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.390\nIt's been around since\nthe old Windows NT days.\n\n56\n00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.800\nIt has gone through a few\nupdates over the years, but\n\n57\n00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.830\nNTFS is the final system of choice\nin a Windows environment now.\n\n58\n00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.870\nIt could be changing here soon.\n\n59\n00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.820\nThey've got a new one out called REFS,\nor my Resilient File System,\n\n60\n00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.360\nthat hasn't really gained a foothold yet.\n\n61\n00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.237\nBut, it probably is soon ,but NTFS like we\nsaid file system of choice in why Windows\n\n62\n00:02:58.237 --> 00:03:02.500\nenvironments and that's because of\nthe functionality we get out of it.\n\n63\n00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.110\nIt's a very efficient file system\nas far as storing the data,\n\n64\n00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.510\nnot a huge amount of overhead on it.\n\n65\n00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.060\nAnd it gives us that EFS, my encrypting\nfile system, so that I can encrypt files,\n\n66\n00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.080\nand the most important thing is that file\nand folder level security where every\n\n67\n00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.240\nobject that we write to that file\nsystem gets a access control list.\n\n68\n00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.810\nAnd I can control who has what permissions\nover those different resources.\n\n69\n00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.410\nRead, write, full control,\nmodify, things like that.\n\n70\n00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.750\nIf we go back before NTFS,\nwe had things like FAT32 and\n\n71\n00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.650\nwith FAT32 you didn't have\nany of that capability.\n\n72\n00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.710\nThe only things you could really set\non files were archived and hidden.\n\n73\n00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.140\nThere wasn't a whole lot we could\ndo as far as permissions go.\n\n74\n00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.130\nSo, NTFS is typically what\nyou're going to see and\n\n75\n00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.390\nthis is a Microsoft exam, so\nthat's probably the one you know,\n\n76\n00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.530\nthat they're gonna ask you about or\nexpect you to know.\n\n77\n00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.650\nX fat is one you probably\nshould be familiar with.\n\n78\n00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.240\nExternal fat.\n\n79\n00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.760\nTypically for your thumb drive and\nyour external drive, and things like that.\n\n80\n00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.270\nX fat is nice too because you can\ngo back and forth in between,\n\n81\n00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.740\nsay, Windows and the Mac OS X.\n\n82\n00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.800\nWhereas NTFS and Mac OS X can read it.\n\n83\n00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.120\nBut, it can't write to it.\n\n84\n00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.480\nAnd that can be a problem\nin a mixed environment.\n\n85\n00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.360\nSo, those are the kind of things you're\nthinking about when you're choosing\n\n86\n00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.970\nwhat file system you're gonna\nlay down on those hard drives.\n\n87\n00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.650\nBut, you do have to put a file\nsystem on there so we can use them.\n\n88\n00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.700\nThey don't come with a file system,\nnot hard drives anyway,\n\n89\n00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.090\nthumb drives typically do come\nformatted with expat on them.\n\n90\n00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.760\nAll right, so we got our file system, but\nI'll show you how we're going to do that.\n\n91\n00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.530\nThe next thing I want to talk about though\nis basic disks versus dynamic disks.\n\n92\n00:04:51.776 --> 00:04:54.820\nFirst thing we need to understand is that\nwhen you go out and buy a hard drive.\n\n93\n00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.730\nYou don't buy a basic disk,\nyou don't buy a dynamic disk, right?\n\n94\n00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.520\nYou buy a hard drive.\n\n95\n00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.425\nAnd when you initialize that\ndrive in that computer,\n\n96\n00:05:03.425 --> 00:05:08.212\nit's by default in Windows,\nit's gonna come in as a basic disk.\n\n97\n00:05:08.212 --> 00:05:09.647\nAnd with basic disk,\n\n98\n00:05:09.647 --> 00:05:14.290\nbasic is what we've had since as\nlong as I've been doing computers.\n\n99\n00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.810\nBasic disks have been around forever.\n\n100\n00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.420\nIn fact, we didn't call them basic disks,\n\n101\n00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.200\nwe just called them disks,\ncause there was nothing else.\n\n102\n00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.910\nAnd there were some limitations\nto the basic disk system.\n\n103\n00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.245\nAnd with the basic disk you're\nlimited to four primary partitions.\n\n104\n00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:30.610\nAll right?\n\n105\n00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:36.570\nMeaning I can divide that one drive\nup into four separate partitions.\n\n106\n00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.960\nEach one of those can get a drive letter.\n\n107\n00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.550\nAnd I can then see that in Windows\nExplorer, and I can store files on it.\n\n108\n00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.730\nBut, I could I can't create\nanything other than a partition,\n\n109\n00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.305\nwhat we call a simple volume nowadays.\n\n110\n00:05:50.305 --> 00:05:55.289\nBut, gosh Daniel I can't remember\nwhen dynamic came out, but\n\n111\n00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:00.192\ndynamic disks are,\nI think it came out in XP in 2003 but I.\n\n112\n00:06:00.192 --> 00:06:02.211\n>> That's what's tickling\nmy brain as well,\n\n113\n00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:04.170\nI think that's about the time that this.\n\n114\n00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.700\nShowed up.\n\n115\n00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.420\n>> Somewhere around there.\n\n116\n00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.350\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, it's nothing new.\n\n117\n00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.450\nIf it's been around for a while,\n\n118\n00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:12.430\nwe can take a drive and\nwe can convert it from basic to dynamic.\n\n119\n00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.980\nAnd when we do, we get to create some\nnew and exciting types of volumes.\n\n120\n00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.680\nOn dynamic disks they don't\ncall them partitions anymore\n\n121\n00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.230\nthere gonna call them volumes, and\nyou can create a simple volume,\n\n122\n00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.710\nwhich is just like a partition\nis on a basic disk.\n\n123\n00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.820\nIt gets a drive letter,\nit gets a file system,\n\n124\n00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.600\nit shows up in Windows explorer,\nand it resides on a single volume.\n\n125\n00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:40.100\nWith a basic disk, I could extend\na partition, if there was available space.\n\n126\n00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.710\nIn fact, what?\n\n127\n00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:41.930\nWe'll pull up disk management.\n\n128\n00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.610\nKind of do it and\ntalk about it at the same time.\n\n129\n00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.990\nSo, I'm gonna go to my server, here.\n\n130\n00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.560\nI'm gonna open up computer management.\n\n131\n00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.630\nAnd I threw a couple extra\ndrives in this server, so\n\n132\n00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.790\nwe'd have something to play with.\n\n133\n00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.800\nWell, let me drag this\nguy up a little bit.\n\n134\n00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.560\nAnd let me bring them online, so\nI'm gonna right-click on this guy and\n\n135\n00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.760\nbring it online, and I'll do that for\nall of these guys real quick.\n\n136\n00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.280\nWe'll get all three of those guys online,\nand then I'm going to initialize them.\n\n137\n00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.590\nNow, when I initialize them I get\na choice between MBR and GPT, and\n\n138\n00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:14.950\nthey don't the objectives.\n\n139\n00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.840\nSo, you can pretty much tune out for\nthe next minute or two while I talk about\n\n140\n00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.150\nthis, or you can pay attention and\nthis is really good information,\n\n141\n00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.400\nand heck maybe they even ask you\nabout it on the exam, right.\n\n142\n00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.400\nJust the basics of it, so MBR, Master Boot\nRecord, this is what we've had forever.\n\n143\n00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.160\nAgain, it's that limit to\nfour primary partitions.\n\n144\n00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:35.490\nGosh, test my memory here.\n\n145\n00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:40.180\nMax size is 2 Terabytes on the volume.\n\n146\n00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.540\nI'll double check on that, but\n2 Terabytes on that volume.\n\n147\n00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:46.270\nI think 2 Terabytes.\n\n148\n00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.090\nLet me double check on that.\n\n149\n00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:50.670\nGPT is the newer system.\n\n150\n00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:56.968\nGUI partition table and these allow for\nmuch larger partition sizes so\n\n151\n00:07:56.968 --> 00:08:02.314\nyou just choose that when you\nthrow it in and default is NBR.\n\n152\n00:08:02.314 --> 00:08:04.950\nAnd that's gonna leave them as.\n\n153\n00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.105\nThe rule of thumb is, in fact,\nyeah, they've got it down here.\n\n154\n00:08:07.105 --> 00:08:10.750\nFor disks larger than two terabytes,\nuse GPT.\n\n155\n00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:12.380\nBecause an NBR based disk.\n\n156\n00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.460\nWhen NBR was written.\n\n157\n00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.700\nI mean, NBR has been around forever.\n\n158\n00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.670\nI mean, since as long as I can remember.\n\n159\n00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:21.160\nWe didn't have, there was not concept\nof a drive that was gonna be bigger\n\n160\n00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.760\nthat two terabytes in size right?\n\n161\n00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.740\nSo that's the limit on those\nMBR disks is two terabytes.\n\n162\n00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.120\nIt has to do with the number of bits\nit has to store information about\n\n163\n00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.530\nthe starting and\nending points of these partitions.\n\n164\n00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:38.670\nGPT however is a relatively newer one and\nit supports drives much larger in size so\n\n165\n00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:43.160\nthe rule of thumb is just use MBR,\nunless your drive is bigger than 2 TB or\n\n166\n00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:47.900\nyou want to make a drive a volume\nbigger than 2TB, then go GPT.\n\n167\n00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.160\nSo I'll leave it as a good old MBR and\nI'll click OK.\n\n168\n00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.220\nAnd there we go.\n\n169\n00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.000\nAnd notice they're all basic, right?\n\n170\n00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.420\nAnd when I right-click on this guy,\n\n171\n00:08:55.420 --> 00:09:00.000\nthey've changed this in Windows,\nit's a little misleading.\n\n172\n00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.030\nThey've changed the menu.\n\n173\n00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:07.560\nIt used to be if this drive was basic\nyou would see new partition all right?\n\n174\n00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.090\nAnd you wouldn't see these other\noptions until you converted it\n\n175\n00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:14.570\nbecause a striped volume,\na spanned volume.\n\n176\n00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.000\nA mirrored volume, a raid 5 volume.\n\n177\n00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.040\nThese are only available on dynamic disks.\n\n178\n00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.970\nIf I was to choose one of these, it would\nactually go and at the very end, and\n\n179\n00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.860\nsay, do you want to convert this drive?\n\n180\n00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.530\nBut I don't want to yet, so\nI'm just gonna do a simple volume.\n\n181\n00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:32.400\nAnd to keep it quick and easy,\nI'm just gonna use all my defaults here.\n\n182\n00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.650\nI'm gonna drop that down\nto 200 megs in size.\n\n183\n00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:39.210\nActually you know let's do 500.\n\n184\n00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:40.310\nJust to make it nice and\n\n185\n00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:45.020\nquick I will leave the default drive\nletter, I hate the volume labels,\n\n186\n00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:49.490\nanyway we'll take that out and click\nnext and finish and we're good to go.\n\n187\n00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:53.630\nThat is a partition or a simple volume.\n\n188\n00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.770\nNow I will tell you\ntechnically it's the partition.\n\n189\n00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:59.450\nOnce I converted the dynamic\nthen it's a volume.\n\n190\n00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:02.300\nBut it's the same darn thing.\n\n191\n00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.360\nThat's just a little bit\nof a technicality there.\n\n192\n00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.320\n>> Now Mike what's the purpose\nof partitioning a drive?\n\n193\n00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.530\nI mean, I see they are basically\nmaking a separation.\n\n194\n00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:14.090\nInside of the drive itself\na logical saying okay this is,\n\n195\n00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:15.590\nwe got one actual drive.\n\n196\n00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.570\nWe are kind of like saying that it is.\n\n197\n00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.110\nWhat is the purpose of doing that?\n\n198\n00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:20.710\n>> Well you could do it for\na couple of reasons.\n\n199\n00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:24.510\nOne would be to segregate data for\nsecurity reasons.\n\n200\n00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:26.450\nRight?\nBecause a drive comes with\n\n201\n00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:31.240\ndefault permissions and I can set those at\nthe volume level itself and if I want to,\n\n202\n00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:35.540\nif I got certain people that may\n\n203\n00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:39.600\nwanna control access to this data and\nkeep certain people out of it.\n\n204\n00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.130\nWe'll if it's all on one volume,\nI gotta get into my NTFS permissions,\n\n205\n00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:45.040\nI gotta block inheritance and\nthings like that.\n\n206\n00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.270\nAnd that works, that's just fine, we've\ngot episodes where we talk about that.\n\n207\n00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:52.150\nAnother way to accomplish that though is\nto would be to create a separate volume\n\n208\n00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:56.080\nand then I can control the security\non that volume itself and\n\n209\n00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.670\nI don't have to worry about the sub\nfolders and things like that.\n\n210\n00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:04.320\nThat would be one reason, two is back\nups right, because I might have data,\n\n211\n00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.560\nsome data that I need to backup once\na month that doesn't change that often.\n\n212\n00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.410\nOther data that I really need to\nbackup once a week or even more often.\n\n213\n00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:15.860\nAnd it would be a lot easier if\nthey were in separate partitions.\n\n214\n00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.530\nRight?\nIf it's all in one partition,\n\n215\n00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:21.470\nI'd have to somehow manually go and\npick what I want backup everyday.\n\n216\n00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:23.260\nAnd then the other stuff\nback it up once a week and\n\n217\n00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.080\nthe other stuff back it up once a month.\n\n218\n00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.020\nOr I could have separate partitions\nwhere I back up this entire partition,\n\n219\n00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.370\nI don't have to go pick anything.\n\n220\n00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.640\nI say back up E every day.\n\n221\n00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.140\nBack up the next volume every month.\n\n222\n00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:34.830\nYou know and what have you.\n\n223\n00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:38.535\nSo, that's really why we would\nend up doing something like,\n\n224\n00:11:38.535 --> 00:11:43.615\nseparate that data out, for\neither security or back up purposes.\n\n225\n00:11:43.615 --> 00:11:44.215\nAll right?\n\n226\n00:11:44.215 --> 00:11:46.425\nSo now that I've got that,\nyou'll notice that it formatted,\n\n227\n00:11:46.425 --> 00:11:49.585\nI should have done that a little slower,\nlet's do another one.\n\n228\n00:11:49.585 --> 00:11:52.235\nI'm gonna right click New Simple Volume\none more time, cuz I did skip\n\n229\n00:11:52.235 --> 00:11:56.899\nthrough that wizard pretty quickly, and I\nforgot to show you my file system choices.\n\n230\n00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.810\nSo, let's say F there.\n\n231\n00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:03.820\nHere, on this screen, I actually left\nthe default, which was NTFS, but\n\n232\n00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.100\nif I hit this drop down list,\nyou see I could do FAT or FAT32.\n\n233\n00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.220\nNow, why would I do that?\n\n234\n00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.940\nFor compatibility with some\nother operating system or\n\n235\n00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.770\nsome program that didn't understand NTFS.\n\n236\n00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:16.695\nBack in the day,\nthat might have been a real issue.\n\n237\n00:12:16.695 --> 00:12:19.690\nNowadays, just about everything\nunderstands NTFS, so\n\n238\n00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:21.170\nI don't have that issue.\n\n239\n00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:25.150\nBut it could be that you've got an older\nprogram that can't write to NTFS, or\n\n240\n00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:28.720\nyou've got other operating systems on your\nnetwork, and they can't read NTFS, and\n\n241\n00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.350\nyou want to share some of these resources\nwith those different operating systems.\n\n242\n00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:36.490\nYou might have to choose another\nfile type here, or file system.\n\n243\n00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:37.450\nRight?\n\n244\n00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:41.880\nI'll go ahead and\nclick Next one more time.\n\n245\n00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.010\nAnd we'll create one more.\n\n246\n00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:46.550\nAll right now, with this basic disk,\nI've created these guys,\n\n247\n00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:50.110\none of the cool things you can do is,\nI can extend this volume.\n\n248\n00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:51.270\nRight.\nI can make it bigger.\n\n249\n00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:54.500\nI have space on this drive\nthat's not used yet.\n\n250\n00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.390\nSo, I can click on this guy and\nI can choose Extend Volume, and\n\n251\n00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:01.910\nI can go through my wizard, and\nI can use that same disk and\n\n252\n00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:05.150\nknows it's telling me all of\nthe unallocated space there.\n\n253\n00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:08.910\nI can go ahead and extend that out\nanother file, another megabytes, and\n\n254\n00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:12.120\nI click Next, and Finish and\nwe're good to go.\n\n255\n00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.069\nNow I got a thousand megabytes.\n\n256\n00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:17.583\nAll right, and\nI could make four more two more and\n\n257\n00:13:17.583 --> 00:13:22.480\nonce I got to that limit I wouldn't\nbe able to make more partitions.\n\n258\n00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.770\nI can create an extended partition and\n\n259\n00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:30.620\ncreate logical drives within that,\nbut primarily limited to four.\n\n260\n00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:36.860\nI can only extend this out to include\nthis data, or this portion of the drive.\n\n261\n00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.540\nIn other words, the volume itself,\n\n262\n00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:42.790\nthe partition I should say,\ncan only reside on a single hard drive.\n\n263\n00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:45.140\nAnd you might think well duh,\nthat makes sense.\n\n264\n00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:46.079\nIt has to be on that drive.\n\n265\n00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.370\nWith dynamic disks I can get really fancy.\n\n266\n00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:51.520\nAnd let's do this.\n\n267\n00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.920\nWatch what I'm gonna do.\n\n268\n00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:57.440\nI'm gonna extend this guy out again.\n\n269\n00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.750\nI don't know if it will let me\nshow you the conversion here.\n\n270\n00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:04.260\nI could throw another disk over here.\n\n271\n00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.790\nAnd what do I got left\non that first drive?\n\n272\n00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:12.640\nAbout 20 GB, 18, let's just say 20 here.\n\n273\n00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.140\nAll right, and oops.\n\n274\n00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:17.350\nIs that enough zeroes?\n\n275\n00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:19.550\nTwo, three, four, five.\n\n276\n00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:21.381\nThere we go.\n\n277\n00:14:21.381 --> 00:14:22.650\nOh, it's not going to let me do it.\n\n278\n00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:24.050\nYeah, it's going to make\nme convert it first.\n\n279\n00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.870\nI was going to see if, sometimes\nwhat it would do is it'll say, hey,\n\n280\n00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:29.200\nwe're going to have to\nconvert this dynamic.\n\n281\n00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.900\nFor the extension though I'm going\nto have to convert it first.\n\n282\n00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:37.070\nSo with a basic disk I can only extend\nthis out to take up the remaining space\n\n283\n00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:38.810\non that physical drive.\n\n284\n00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:39.690\nAll right?\n\n285\n00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:43.960\nBut with dynamic disk,\nI could do some pretty cool things.\n\n286\n00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.920\nFirst let's see how we can convert it,\nright?\n\n287\n00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:46.710\nA couple of ways.\n\n288\n00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:50.210\nOne, I can right-click on this guy and\nchoose convert to dynamic.\n\n289\n00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:52.820\nIt's gonna say,\nwell which one do you want to convert.\n\n290\n00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.190\nI'll just convert, I'll go ahead and\ncovert all of them at this point.\n\n291\n00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:57.350\nWell, yeah, I'll convert all of them.\n\n292\n00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:58.220\nAnd I'll say okay.\n\n293\n00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.720\nAll right?\n\n294\n00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.730\nIt says, hey dude, are you sure?\n\n295\n00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:01.910\nThis is what's gonna happen.\n\n296\n00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:04.680\nI'll say convert and I'll say, yes.\n\n297\n00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:08.970\nIt's warning me that if it's the OS drive,\nit might not be able to boot to it,\n\n298\n00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:11.480\ndepending on the operating\nsystem version I'm running.\n\n299\n00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.350\nAnd there we go.\n\n300\n00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.850\nNow they are all listed as dynamic drives.\n\n301\n00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:18.650\nAnd notice,\nit changed the color coding up here.\n\n302\n00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:22.790\nIt's no longer a primary partition,\nit's a simple volume.\n\n303\n00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:23.510\nAll right?\n\n304\n00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:26.480\nBecause volumes are created\nin a dynamic disk,\n\n305\n00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.370\npartitions are created on basic disks.\n\n306\n00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:34.000\nAnd now that I have done that,\nI can create what we call a span volume.\n\n307\n00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:34.930\nAll right?\n\n308\n00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:38.430\nI can either extend an existing\nvolume out, to take up space from\n\n309\n00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:43.230\nmore than one drive, or I can create\na span volume, which is exactly that.\n\n310\n00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:46.120\nRight?\nSo this span volume I'm gonna make,\n\n311\n00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:50.884\nI've got 18.5 there, new span volume,\nI'm gonna click Next, and\n\n312\n00:15:50.884 --> 00:15:53.402\nI'm gonna add another drive in here.\n\n313\n00:15:53.402 --> 00:15:54.714\nAll right.\n\n314\n00:15:54.714 --> 00:15:57.890\nI'm going to click, let's see.\n\n315\n00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:03.463\nLet's make that take up,\nwe'll say 25 there.\n\n316\n00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:06.675\nIt's really not like [INAUDIBLE].\n\n317\n00:16:06.675 --> 00:16:12.470\nHm, interesting why's it not liking\nthat maximum space available.\n\n318\n00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.975\nOh duh, I'm being such a silly goof.\n\n319\n00:16:17.975 --> 00:16:22.495\nFair, all right I forgot to change what\ndrive I was working with up at the top so\n\n320\n00:16:22.495 --> 00:16:25.095\nlet's say I wanna take the maximum size,\nand\n\n321\n00:16:25.095 --> 00:16:29.215\nin fact I'm gonna go, let's remove that so\nI don't have to type it again.\n\n322\n00:16:29.215 --> 00:16:31.230\nAll right, so I'm gonna add disk one.\n\n323\n00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:34.520\nAnd it says all right, this is how much\nspace you're gonna take from disk one, I'm\n\n324\n00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:40.140\ngonna add disk two, and it says well from\ndisk two you could take up to this much,\n\n325\n00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:43.920\nand I'm just gonna grab a little bit of\ndisk two to prove the point there, we'll\n\n326\n00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:50.360\nsay 1000, I'll click next, and finish,\nafter I get rid of that drive label.\n\n327\n00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.730\nAnd let it whir and grind for a second.\n\n328\n00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:56.680\nAnd ta-dah, there we go.\n\n329\n00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:01.080\nNotice that g colon is actually\nlisted on two physical disks.\n\n330\n00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:04.830\nNow, when I go into file explorer,\nthere is only one g colon, right?\n\n331\n00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:07.430\nIt's all one space.\n\n332\n00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:09.970\nIf I look at the properties of this guy,\n\n333\n00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:13.450\nI see that's a total of\nabout 20 gigs in size there.\n\n334\n00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:14.510\nAll right?\n\n335\n00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:19.260\nBut the underlying data is actually\nspanned across more than one\n\n336\n00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.690\nphysical disk.\n\n337\n00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:21.290\nAll right?\n\n338\n00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:25.950\nAnd it's not like a stripe, there's\nno RAID involved, as it writes data,\n\n339\n00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:28.580\nit's gonna fill this up first, alright?\n\n340\n00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:32.450\nOnly once it fills that up,\nwill it move on to the next part and\n\n341\n00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:33.680\nstart writing data here.\n\n342\n00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:36.040\nAlright?\n\n343\n00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.200\nSpan volumes,\n\n344\n00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:41.900\nrarely are you going to use a span volume,\nbecause I now have two points of failure.\n\n345\n00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:45.580\nIf either one of these drives fail,\nI lose all the data in G,\n\n346\n00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:49.760\nI would lose all of it not just\nthe part on the failed drive.\n\n347\n00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:53.640\nSo spanned volumes are used\ntypically as a stop gap measure.\n\n348\n00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.610\nMy original drive is full,\nI need more space in G colon so\n\n349\n00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:01.150\nI'm gonna go grab another drive,\nslap it in there.\n\n350\n00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:04.880\nAnd span g onto the next\ndrive to give me some space,\n\n351\n00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.950\nuntil I can come up with a bigger drive or\na better solution.\n\n352\n00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:11.890\nBecause you really don't want to\nput your data on a span volume.\n\n353\n00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:14.890\nBecause you're increasing\nthe points in failure.\n\n354\n00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:17.880\nNow I'm going to show you something,\nI'm going to create a simple volume.\n\n355\n00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.460\nI'm just going to do a little one here.\n\n356\n00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:24.490\nI'll do another 500,\nI'll click next and next and\n\n357\n00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:27.705\nI'll wipe that guy out and\nnext and finish.\n\n358\n00:18:27.705 --> 00:18:31.410\nIt'll whir and grind and\ncreate another simple volume.\n\n359\n00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:35.410\nAnd what I wanted to show you is I\ncan continue to span this guy out.\n\n360\n00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:40.580\nI can right click on this guy,\nchoose extend volume, and\n\n361\n00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:44.177\nlet's see from disk two I can\ntake another 2000 megabytes.\n\n362\n00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.930\nThen I click next and finish.\n\n363\n00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:50.480\nNotice it just goes around\nthat H colon there.\n\n364\n00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:55.320\nAnd gives me more space for G colon, so\nwhen you span a volume, span volumes can\n\n365\n00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:01.170\ngo across multiple physical drives and\nit does not have to be continuous space.\n\n366\n00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:05.320\nSo if you've got this extra space\nover here and you need to make\n\n367\n00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:10.090\nF colon bigger right, I could actually add\nto F colon, I could add this space to F.\n\n368\n00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:11.530\nI could go over here.\n\n369\n00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:16.980\nAnd I could say extend volume, I say next,\nthere's no space left on drive one but\n\n370\n00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.620\nI could grab some space from drive two and\nI could say hey,\n\n371\n00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:25.210\ngo give another 2000\nmegabytes from over there and\n\n372\n00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:27.740\nthere it goes, now F colon is,\nnotice the color change.\n\n373\n00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.610\nIt's no longer a simple volume.\n\n374\n00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:32.350\nA simple volume resides on a single drive.\n\n375\n00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:36.680\nAs soon as you take space from more than\none drive, it becomes a span volume,\n\n376\n00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.470\nas far as the terminology goes.\n\n377\n00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:41.660\nAgain, not a good thing, because I've\nincreased the points of failure,\n\n378\n00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.970\nit's really a stop gap measure, right?\n\n379\n00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:46.200\nBut these are some of the things that\nI can do with dynamic disks, and\n\n380\n00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.010\nthis is why Microsoft came up with it.\n\n381\n00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:50.460\nBecause our basic disks were very limited.\n\n382\n00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.320\nAnd dynamic disks give us\nthe ability to do this.\n\n383\n00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:57.450\nIf you've watched our RAID episode,\nwhere we talked about RAID.\n\n384\n00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:59.920\nI can do software based\nRAID on dynamic disks.\n\n385\n00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:00.650\nI can do RAID 0.\n\n386\n00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:02.430\nIn fact, you see the list here.\n\n387\n00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:04.110\nI can do RAID 0.\n\n388\n00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:05.290\nWhich is my stripe.\n\n389\n00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:09.120\nI can do a mirrored volume\nwhich is rated one.\n\n390\n00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:13.240\nIf I had a third drive\nI could do a RAID five.\n\n391\n00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:16.790\nNow rules about that span volume,\nminimum two, right?\n\n392\n00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:19.090\nIf I only have one drive\nit's a simple volume.\n\n393\n00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:22.320\nSo for a span volume minimum\nof two drives, up to 32.\n\n394\n00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:27.110\nI could actually span my data\nacross 32 different drives.\n\n395\n00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.830\nSounds great, man.\n\n396\n00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:30.300\nI can just keep throwing drives in there,\nkeep adding more and\n\n397\n00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.400\nmore space to that volume.\n\n398\n00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.245\n32 points of failure, right?\n\n399\n00:20:34.245 --> 00:20:37.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So probably not a good idea.\n\n400\n00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.470\nBut you could temporarily.\n\n401\n00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:46.100\nAll right, so that's dynamic and basic you\ncan convert them without losing any data.\n\n402\n00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:50.690\nThe conversion process I don't lose any\ndata, I can convert from basic to dynamic.\n\n403\n00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:55.320\nI can go from dynamic back to basic\nif I don't violate any of the rules.\n\n404\n00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.350\nRight?\nI've got span volumes that are taking\n\n405\n00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:59.690\nup space for more than one drive.\n\n406\n00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:03.490\nThere is nothing in a basic disk\nthat even comes close to that.\n\n407\n00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:06.280\nSo it's not gonna let\nme convert them back.\n\n408\n00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:11.390\nIf I had only created simple volume, and\nI wanted to convert it back to basic for\n\n409\n00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:15.680\nsome reason I could do that because the\nsimple volumes would simply be converted\n\n410\n00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.910\ninto primary partitions and\nI'd be good to go.\n\n411\n00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:21.790\nBut if you've made anything like a RAID,\nthe stripe or\n\n412\n00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:25.850\nthe mirror or the RAID five or\nspan volumes that take up space for\n\n413\n00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:28.200\nmore than one drive,\nyou won't be able to convert back.\n\n414\n00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.320\nThen again the conversion\nprocess you don't lose your.\n\n415\n00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.810\nShouldn't lose any data if you've\nactually got data on the drives,\n\n416\n00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:36.890\nit would probably be a good idea\nto back it up just in case.\n\n417\n00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:42.060\nRight, cuz you know the rule,\nif it can go wrong, it will go especially.\n\n418\n00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:43.872\n>> It has gone wrong, it's already wrong.\n\n419\n00:21:43.872 --> 00:21:47.616\n[LAUGH] Well Mike, obviously dynamic disc\nis very awesome even though basic discs\n\n420\n00:21:47.616 --> 00:21:50.750\nstill have their function that's\nwhy they're still around.\n\n421\n00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:53.670\nBut as a flexibility built\ninto those dynamic discs,\n\n422\n00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:58.000\nis why we tend to lean in heavily\nin that direction anymore nowadays.\n\n423\n00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.910\nNow another topic we need to cover though\nMike is mount points and mounting drives.\n\n424\n00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:06.290\n>> Yeah mount points is another\nway that I can add more space.\n\n425\n00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:10.211\nLike that span volume is really all about,\nmy volume's out of space,\n\n426\n00:22:10.211 --> 00:22:13.564\nI've got a program that's\nhard-coded to look at G colon.\n\n427\n00:22:13.564 --> 00:22:15.850\nI can't just throw another\ndrive in there and\n\n428\n00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:18.230\nmake an H colon,\nbecause that program won't work.\n\n429\n00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:20.650\nI need to make G colon bigger.\n\n430\n00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:23.920\nBut I'm out of space on that drive,\nso I convert them to dynamic, and\n\n431\n00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.060\nI span that volume onto a second drive.\n\n432\n00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:28.350\nI'm adding more space to it.\n\n433\n00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:31.790\nMount points is another way I\ncan add more space to a drive,\n\n434\n00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:36.630\nand it's really designed to do it\nwithout eating up a drive letter.\n\n435\n00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:41.070\nRight, because we are limited in\nthe number of drive letters I can have.\n\n436\n00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:42.080\nI mean, it's, like, 20.\n\n437\n00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.230\nI mean, A, B, C are taken.\n\n438\n00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:48.910\nD is typically, if you still have one,\nyour optical drive.\n\n439\n00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:54.130\nSo there's still quite a few letters left,\nand I've never run into the scenario.\n\n440\n00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:56.190\nI did have enough drive letters, but\n\n441\n00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:59.300\nthat would be one reason\nyou could do a malpoint.\n\n442\n00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:03.580\nIs to save you from having\nto use another drive letter.\n\n443\n00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:08.610\nThe biggest reason is typically to\nmake it easier for end users, or to,\n\n444\n00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:11.830\nyou know that's really the biggest\nreason I can think of.\n\n445\n00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:13.710\nTo make it easy on my end users.\n\n446\n00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:18.410\nOne of the scenarios that Microsoft\nalways uses is let's say I got a user and\n\n447\n00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:22.910\nthey have a folder in their documents\nthat they've created, called Art or\n\n448\n00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:24.205\nsomething like that.\n\n449\n00:23:24.205 --> 00:23:28.390\nThey're in the marketing department,\nthey work with large files, .tifs and\n\n450\n00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:29.470\nthings like this and\n\n451\n00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:32.720\nthey are putting them in this folder\ncalled Art in their my documents.\n\n452\n00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:36.250\nBut they've got a small drive,\nthat C drive is not all that big, and\n\n453\n00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:39.630\nthey don't want to eat up all the space\nwith all these big image files and\n\n454\n00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:40.540\nthings like that.\n\n455\n00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:43.190\nBut they still want a user to\nbe able to go file save and\n\n456\n00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:45.100\nput it in this folder into my documents.\n\n457\n00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:46.610\nVery easy on my user.\n\n458\n00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:49.760\nSometimes teaching a user hey,\nyou don't have any space there,\n\n459\n00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.810\nbut you should go to H colon and\nput your stuff there.\n\n460\n00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:54.870\nWe're trying to map drives.\n\n461\n00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:57.844\nWhile you and I might find that\npretty simple, sometimes for\n\n462\n00:23:57.844 --> 00:23:59.193\nusers it's not so simple.\n\n463\n00:23:59.193 --> 00:24:00.270\nRight?\n>> Yeah, Mike,\n\n464\n00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:02.073\nit's hard to teach an old dog new tricks.\n\n465\n00:24:02.073 --> 00:24:04.078\nPeople get ingrained in\nthe way they do things.\n\n466\n00:24:04.078 --> 00:24:08.079\nThey get used to that art folder\nbeing there and you telling them,\n\n467\n00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:09.983\nhey just point to that H drive.\n\n468\n00:24:09.983 --> 00:24:13.701\nYou might as well just told them,\nfirst you need to solve this algorithm for\n\n469\n00:24:13.701 --> 00:24:16.100\nquantum physics, before you can save your.\n\n470\n00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:18.113\nThat's the way they feel about it,\nthat's the way they think about it.\n\n471\n00:24:18.113 --> 00:24:19.899\nSo, mount points can really\nhelp us out with that.\n\n472\n00:24:19.899 --> 00:24:21.010\n>> They can, absolutely.\n\n473\n00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:22.410\nAnd let me show you how to do it.\n\n474\n00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:23.600\nA couple things we're gonna need.\n\n475\n00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.670\nOne is, I need an empty folder\nto create this mount point.\n\n476\n00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:29.920\nSo I'm gonna go over here, and\nI'm gonna go into Documents.\n\n477\n00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.140\nAnd I'll make sure I'm in\nMy Documents here and not public.\n\n478\n00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:39.507\nAnd I'll make a new folder, and\nI'm gonna call it Art, all right?\n\n479\n00:24:39.507 --> 00:24:42.810\nSo we've told our user, hey, in your\ndocuments, there's a folder called Art.\n\n480\n00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:44.980\nThat's where you can put\nall those large files.\n\n481\n00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:49.170\nBut I don't want it eating up all their\ndisk space on their primary drive.\n\n482\n00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:54.045\nSo what I'm gonna do is slap\nanother drive in their computer,\n\n483\n00:24:54.045 --> 00:24:56.774\nand it's unallocated down here.\n\n484\n00:24:56.774 --> 00:24:58.412\nWell, I'll just do a simple volume for\nthis one.\n\n485\n00:24:58.412 --> 00:24:59.534\nI'll click Next.\n\n486\n00:24:59.534 --> 00:25:05.300\nAnd let's say I want to give them\nanother 4 gigs or so, all right?\n\n487\n00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.024\nI'll click Next.\n\n488\n00:25:07.024 --> 00:25:10.678\nAnd instead of assigning a drive\nletter like I normally would, and\n\n489\n00:25:10.678 --> 00:25:14.395\nthat would show up in Windows Explorer,\nI'm gonna say mount this,\n\n490\n00:25:14.395 --> 00:25:18.750\nmount in the following empty,\nmake sure it's empty, NTFS folder.\n\n491\n00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:24.940\nI'm gonna click browse, and\nI'm gonna expand out C: and then Users.\n\n492\n00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:28.250\nAnd then I'm logged on as\ntheir lab administrator, and\n\n493\n00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:31.460\nin My Documents,\nthere's my folder called Art.\n\n494\n00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.430\nAnd I'll click Okay.\n\n495\n00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:34.970\nAnd then Next.\n\n496\n00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:37.738\nAnd I'm gonna leave off\nthe drive label there.\n\n497\n00:25:37.738 --> 00:25:41.691\nThen do a quick format, and\nI'll click Next and Finish.\n\n498\n00:25:41.691 --> 00:25:44.624\nAnd it's gonna whir and\ngrind, and there we go.\n\n499\n00:25:44.624 --> 00:25:46.390\nNotice it does not have a drive left.\n\n500\n00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:49.770\nIt's not gonna show up in\nWindows Explorer as a separate volume.\n\n501\n00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:53.970\nBut when they go to their folder,\nit does change the icon,\n\n502\n00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:55.670\nthat might throw them a little bit.\n\n503\n00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:59.960\nBut when they create stuff in here,\nall right,\n\n504\n00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:03.830\nit's not actually being written to their C\ndrive where their My Documents is located.\n\n505\n00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:06.870\nIt's actually being written\nto this partition over here.\n\n506\n00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:07.860\nSo that's a mount point.\n\n507\n00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:13.462\nI can grab space from another drive and\nmount it to an empty NTFS folder.\n\n508\n00:26:13.462 --> 00:26:15.265\nAnd so when you put stuff in the folder,\n\n509\n00:26:15.265 --> 00:26:18.860\nit's actually being redirected\nover to that other drive there.\n\n510\n00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:19.840\nSo very handy.\n\n511\n00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.950\nYou don't see them used that often.\n\n512\n00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:25.490\nIt really is a special circumstance\nwhen you need to do that, but\n\n513\n00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:26.890\nreally cool that we can.\n\n514\n00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:31.036\nI might have a program that doesn't\nunderstand map drives or something, and I\n\n515\n00:26:31.036 --> 00:26:36.462\nwanted to write data to this other drive,\nthis is one of the ways I can do it.\n\n516\n00:26:36.462 --> 00:26:39.660\nAll right, next thing I want to show\nyou is mounting a virtual hard drive.\n\n517\n00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:46.812\nNow, a virtual hard drive, or\nVHD is a virtual hard drive.\n\n518\n00:26:46.812 --> 00:26:48.405\n[LAUGH]\n>> So basically it's self explanatory.\n\n519\n00:26:48.405 --> 00:26:51.162\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's all you need to know.\n\n520\n00:26:51.162 --> 00:26:56.500\nNo, a VHD or a virtual hard drive is\na file that I treat like a hard drive.\n\n521\n00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.690\nIt's a pretty twisty concept.\n\n522\n00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:02.790\nBut it is a file that resides\non your physical hard drive but\n\n523\n00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:05.680\nto the computer it looks like\na completely separate drive.\n\n524\n00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.270\nAnd we have to format it,\njust like I would a real drive.\n\n525\n00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:10.064\nI have to give it a file system.\n\n526\n00:27:10.064 --> 00:27:14.771\nI have to assign that drive all of\nthat stuff, and for all intents and\n\n527\n00:27:14.771 --> 00:27:19.490\npurposes, for the OS,\nit is a separate drive, but it's virtual.\n\n528\n00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:23.060\nIt's really just a file\nresiding on your file system.\n\n529\n00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:24.380\nWhy the heck would you use them?\n\n530\n00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:26.210\nWell, primarily with virtual machines,\nright?\n\n531\n00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:29.048\nVirtual machines that we run,\n\n532\n00:27:29.048 --> 00:27:34.405\nuse virtual hard drives as\ntheir hard drive, primarily.\n\n533\n00:27:34.405 --> 00:27:37.670\nI'm trying to think of another reason to\nuse one outside of virtual machines, and\n\n534\n00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:39.055\nI I haven't thought of a good one.\n\n535\n00:27:39.055 --> 00:27:42.980\nThe one thing that's really cool\nabout VHDs is they're portable.\n\n536\n00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:45.056\nBecause they're a file, right?\n\n537\n00:27:45.056 --> 00:27:49.822\nI can take that VHD, I can copy it to a\nremovable thumb drive or a USB hard drive,\n\n538\n00:27:49.822 --> 00:27:54.300\ntake it to another machine, copy it\nback over to their physical disk, and\n\n539\n00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:57.610\nmount it up and\nthey would see that drive, right?\n\n540\n00:27:57.610 --> 00:27:59.630\nWith all those files in all it's glory.\n\n541\n00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:02.120\nAnd they're really easy\nto create in Windows.\n\n542\n00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:06.275\nAll I'm going to do is right click\nover here on disk management and\n\n543\n00:28:06.275 --> 00:28:09.340\nchoose create VHD, all right?\n\n544\n00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:11.773\nAnd I'll give it a, I'm gonna browse,\nor, actually, you know what?\n\n545\n00:28:11.773 --> 00:28:13.410\nI'll just kind of type it in here.\n\n546\n00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:15.500\nLet's say I put it in C:.\n\n547\n00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:18.470\nWell, actually,\nI got all these other cool drives.\n\n548\n00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:19.873\nLet's use one of those.\n\n549\n00:28:19.873 --> 00:28:27.070\nI'll put it on G:\\ and I'll call\nit testVHD, so we can go find it.\n\n550\n00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:30.040\nAnd I'll make it 500 megs in size.\n\n551\n00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.180\nAnd I'm gonna do a fixed size.\n\n552\n00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:36.370\nFixed size versus dynamic,\nwith a virtual hard drive.\n\n553\n00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:39.370\nIf it's fixed,\nthen what's gonna happen is,\n\n554\n00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:42.300\nit's gonna create a file\nthat's 500 megabytes in size.\n\n555\n00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.759\nEven though it's empty,\nthere's nothing in it,\n\n556\n00:28:44.759 --> 00:28:47.000\nit's gonna create a file 500 megs in size.\n\n557\n00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.514\nDynamically expanding, it would create a\nfile that's about a couple of ks in size,\n\n558\n00:28:51.514 --> 00:28:52.796\na couple of kilobytes.\n\n559\n00:28:52.796 --> 00:28:57.461\nAnd then, as I add data to it,\nit's gonna grow and grow and\n\n560\n00:28:57.461 --> 00:29:01.840\ngrow, up to a maximum of\n500 megabytes in size.\n\n561\n00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.181\nSo you might think\ndynamic is the way to go.\n\n562\n00:29:04.181 --> 00:29:07.420\nThe only thing that you want to keep\nin mind is the way hard drives work.\n\n563\n00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:10.620\nIf you make a virtual hard drive\nthat's dynamically expanding, and\n\n564\n00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:13.510\nit starts out really small,\nand then you happen to write\n\n565\n00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:17.910\nother files to the hard drive, and then\nthat virtual hard drive needs to grow.\n\n566\n00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:19.650\nIt has to jump around those and\n\n567\n00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:22.927\nfind some unallocated space\nto continue to grow there.\n\n568\n00:29:22.927 --> 00:29:26.746\nOr not un-allocated, but other spots\nwhere data hasn't been written yet.\n\n569\n00:29:26.746 --> 00:29:30.460\nAnd my virtual hard drive\nbecomes fragment, right?\n\n570\n00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:34.460\nSimilar to fragmentation we think\nof with our hard drives, but yeah,\n\n571\n00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:39.190\nnow that VHD file itself is in\nchunks all over the hard drive and\n\n572\n00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:40.599\nperformance is going to take a hit.\n\n573\n00:29:40.599 --> 00:29:43.345\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ncreate fixed, I'll click okay.\n\n574\n00:29:43.345 --> 00:29:45.970\nAnd it's going to create it and mount it.\n\n575\n00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:49.070\nOne of the things when you do\nit through disk management,\n\n576\n00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:51.030\nit is going to mount it automatically.\n\n577\n00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:54.800\nYou can also do this from the command\nprompt or from PowerShell, and\n\n578\n00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.080\nit would not mount it.\n\n579\n00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.321\nYou'd have to create it, and\nthen you'd come in here, or\n\n580\n00:29:59.321 --> 00:30:02.840\nthrough the command prompt, and\nyou could choose attach VHD.\n\n581\n00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:06.390\nOr if I had moved this to another\ncomputer, copied it over,\n\n582\n00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:09.650\nI could then attach it\nusing this option here.\n\n583\n00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:11.630\nBut it just looks like another drive,\nright?\n\n584\n00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:14.310\nIt's coming in as unknown,\nnot initialized.\n\n585\n00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:19.406\nI'm gonna go ahead an initialize\nthat disk, and I'll do MBR.\n\n586\n00:30:19.406 --> 00:30:20.990\nAnd now it's online.\n\n587\n00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:22.180\nI can right click on it.\n\n588\n00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:24.540\nI can create a new simple volume.\n\n589\n00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:28.860\nAnd I can make that volume, I'll make\nthe whole thing there, I'll do 500 megs.\n\n590\n00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:32.614\nGive it a drive letter, I'll do V for VHD.\n\n591\n00:30:32.614 --> 00:30:37.500\nI'll click Next, wipe out my volume label,\nNext, and Finish.\n\n592\n00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.121\nAnd there we go.\n\n593\n00:30:39.121 --> 00:30:43.890\nAnd so if I open up File Explorer,\nI'm gonna see V:.\n\n594\n00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:45.480\nThere it is.\nI can write to this,\n\n595\n00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.960\nI can create new files, new folders.\n\n596\n00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:51.137\nThis is where it's gonna get\nreally twisty on you, so\n\n597\n00:30:51.137 --> 00:30:54.466\nmake sure you take the right\npill before you watch this.\n\n598\n00:30:54.466 --> 00:30:58.180\nI've got this, which is a drive,\nand I can create files in it.\n\n599\n00:30:58.180 --> 00:30:59.874\nWhat if I go over to G:?\n\n600\n00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:02.010\nThere's the VHD.\n\n601\n00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:04.970\nHow's that for twisty, right?\n\n602\n00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:08.850\nSo this is the virtual hard drive,\nthat is V:, right?\n\n603\n00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:13.800\nSo when I write to here, I'm actually\nwriting to this file, right here.\n\n604\n00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:17.117\nThis is the file that\ngot formatted with NTFS.\n\n605\n00:31:17.117 --> 00:31:18.620\nPretty crazy, right?\n\n606\n00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:22.085\n>> That's 100% distilled\nconfusion feel right there.\n\n607\n00:31:22.085 --> 00:31:23.492\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n608\n00:31:23.492 --> 00:31:26.160\nNow I can take that disk though,\nand I can unmount it.\n\n609\n00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.617\nI can come over here and\nI can say all right, you know what?\n\n610\n00:31:28.617 --> 00:31:32.800\nI've got all these files on there, I need\nthose files on a different machine now.\n\n611\n00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:37.100\nAll I would have to do is come in here and\ndetach VHD.\n\n612\n00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:40.382\nAnd it's gonna say, hey, it's not gonna\nbe available when you do that, and\n\n613\n00:31:40.382 --> 00:31:41.100\nI realize that.\n\n614\n00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:42.400\nI'll click OK.\n\n615\n00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.595\nIt's no longer there.\n\n616\n00:31:43.595 --> 00:31:46.200\nIt no longer shows up\nin the File Explorer.\n\n617\n00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:49.640\nBut the VHD itself It's\nstill sitting right here.\n\n618\n00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:54.062\nI could copy that to a thumb drive,\ntake it to another machine,\n\n619\n00:31:54.062 --> 00:31:59.920\ngo into disk management on that machine,\nand choose mount, or attach VHD.\n\n620\n00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:03.009\nGo find that guy, which was over on G:.\n\n621\n00:32:07.055 --> 00:32:09.580\nOpen that guy up, click OK.\n\n622\n00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:11.490\nAnd there it is.\n\n623\n00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:12.310\nIt's right back.\n\n624\n00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:17.390\nIf I go back in here, there's my V drive\nand there's my new folder, still up.\n\n625\n00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:19.460\nRight?\nSo that's a virtual hard drive.\n\n626\n00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:22.640\nIt's a file that gets\ntreated as a hard drive,\n\n627\n00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.880\nthe operating system sees\nit just like a hard drive.\n\n628\n00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:29.120\nAll right last thing we are going to talk\nabout to couple things that are pretty\n\n629\n00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.030\nquick and easy.\n\n630\n00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:33.740\nDistributed file system,\nthis is just a file system that can be\n\n631\n00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:37.260\naccessed by more than\none machine at a time.\n\n632\n00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:41.180\nThings like clustered chair\nvolumes in a Microsoft world.\n\n633\n00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:45.040\nWhat a cluster is when you take\nmultiple physical servers and\n\n634\n00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.470\nmake them look like one\nmachine to the network.\n\n635\n00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:51.300\nI can do load balancing across them, I get\nfault tolerance because if one of those\n\n636\n00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:54.890\nmachines fails the other nodes\nin that cluster are still up and\n\n637\n00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:59.600\nrunning so to the network they still\nsee that machine that we've created.\n\n638\n00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.510\nWell, they all need\naccess to the same data.\n\n639\n00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:05.760\nCuz any one of those nodes in that cluster\nhas to be able to access that file you're\n\n640\n00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.530\ntrying to retrieve, or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n641\n00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:12.610\nSo I need some kind of storage that can\nbe accessed by more than one machine.\n\n642\n00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:14.390\nAt the same time, all right?\n\n643\n00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:16.340\nThere's others for\nthe other operating systems.\n\n644\n00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:19.130\nI'm not real familiar with the other OSs,\nbut there's several.\n\n645\n00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:26.140\nSun has theirs, Linux has one that has\nwhat they call distributive file system.\n\n646\n00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:29.580\nAnd then the last thing they call it\non the objective is optical drives or\n\n647\n00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:30.499\noptical discs.\n\n648\n00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:34.620\nMost of you are probably familiar\nwith this as well, right?\n\n649\n00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:40.260\nWe're talking about CDs, DVDs, things\nthat are written not as magnetic bits,\n\n650\n00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:45.400\nwith our magnetic hard platters, and read\nwrite eds, but their written with a laser.\n\n651\n00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.060\nThey're read with light.\n\n652\n00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:55.330\nThat would be, like I said, CDs, DVDs, Blu\nRays fall under there, it's a type of DVD.\n\n653\n00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:59.540\nHonestly Daniel, I don't know what\nelse to say about the modem there.\n\n654\n00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:02.730\nMost of you might not even have\none on your computer anymore.\n\n655\n00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:05.140\n>> Well you may have one sitting\non your entertainment center.\n\n656\n00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.500\nBut yeah they're not common with so\n\n657\n00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:11.550\nmany computers anymore because,\nwell we've got flash media and\n\n658\n00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:15.370\nthat solid state storage media starting\nto get a whole lot more prevalent.\n\n659\n00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:16.880\nBut optical drives are still around.\n\n660\n00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:19.718\nLike just a CD-ROM, or a DVD-ROM drive,\n\n661\n00:34:19.718 --> 00:34:22.660\nmaybe a Blu Ray drive\nthat's in your computer.\n\n662\n00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:25.860\nIt takes a disk, you slap it in,\nit shoots a little laser beam at it, and\n\n663\n00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:29.840\nit reads the data off of it that way.\n\n664\n00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:33.470\n>> One of the problems with them is\nthey're limited in capacity, right?\n\n665\n00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:36.490\nI can't remember CDs is\nwhat 700 some odd megabyte.\n\n666\n00:34:36.490 --> 00:34:37.230\n>> I think 750.\n>> Yeah 750,\n\n667\n00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:40.810\nDVDs depending if it's single layer or\ndual layers.\n\n668\n00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:44.780\nSomewhere around 4.7 gigs, don't quote me\non that, but it's somewhere around there.\n\n669\n00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:47.640\nSo a little limited in capacity.\n\n670\n00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:50.480\nTechnically, you could use\nit as your backup media.\n\n671\n00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:56.420\nOne nice thing about most optical media is\nit's read only, or it's write once, right?\n\n672\n00:34:56.420 --> 00:35:00.410\nIt depends.\nBecause you can get rewritable media, but\n\n673\n00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:02.010\nusually you write to it and\n\n674\n00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:04.240\nthen it's really difficult\nto modify that data, right?\n\n675\n00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.320\nSo it a nice way to save data.\n\n676\n00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.360\nIt's still a great way\nto distribute media.\n\n677\n00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:13.320\nLike when you go buy software, it's very\neasy for a vendor to stamp out these DVDs,\n\n678\n00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:17.395\nslap them in a box put them on a shelf,\nand sell it to you, right?\n\n679\n00:35:17.395 --> 00:35:18.845\nVery cheap, very easy.\n\n680\n00:35:19.945 --> 00:35:22.555\nRelatively hardy, not like when\nthey first came out, they said,\n\n681\n00:35:22.555 --> 00:35:24.055\noh they're indestructible.\n\n682\n00:35:24.055 --> 00:35:27.870\nYeah, until you scratch it,\nthen it's pretty much useless, right.\n\n683\n00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:29.053\nSo that's the thing to think about.\n\n684\n00:35:29.053 --> 00:35:33.290\nI think in regards to this exam,\nthat's probably what they're referring to.\n\n685\n00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:37.500\nIt's really another storage\nmedium that we could use.\n\n686\n00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:41.020\nThe problem with doing, say, backups to\nit, if your backup is small enough, sure.\n\n687\n00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:43.180\nBut what if your backup is 20 gigs.\n\n688\n00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:47.230\nNow you got to swap DVDs out you know\nwhen it finishes writing to one.\n\n689\n00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:50.980\nWhen you got to restore you got to\nhave that entire stack of DVDs.\n\n690\n00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:52.750\nI do not see it as being very efficient.\n\n691\n00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:54.110\nMaybe in smaller environments.\n\n692\n00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:56.820\n>> Yeah plus writing through\nthem takes a little bit of time\n\n693\n00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:58.610\nespecially if it is capacity.\n\n694\n00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:05.030\nIt's an option, but it's probably not\na modern option that we use anymore.\n\n695\n00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:07.490\nAnd that's why they're\nkind of phasing that out.\n\n696\n00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:11.630\nBut, to know it for the exam, that is\nbasically what we're talking about.\n\n697\n00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:13.130\nIt's a nice piece of media.\n\n698\n00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:14.430\nIt is removable.\n\n699\n00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:16.840\nYou take it wherever you need to go,\nyou slap it in the drive,\n\n700\n00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:20.020\nit reads it using the laser,\nand, bada bing, you've got data.\n\n701\n00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:21.200\nRight?\n>> That's it.\n\n702\n00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:23.350\nI mean, well, this,\nI don't even have a DVD on here.\n\n703\n00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:27.230\nIf I wanted to play something off of\nthat or install software from a DVD,\n\n704\n00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:30.543\nI'd have to get an external DVD player and\nplug it in via USB.\n\n705\n00:36:30.543 --> 00:36:33.970\nBecause, everything's getting us so\nthin, that small form factor,\n\n706\n00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:37.400\nthat they can't even fit\nthe mechanisms in there anymore.\n\n707\n00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:37.990\n>> All right, Mike.\n\n708\n00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:40.640\nIt looks like we've gotten through\nall the objectives for this.\n\n709\n00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:41.670\nHave we skipped anything?\n\n710\n00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:42.690\nDid I miss anything?\n\n711\n00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:43.360\n>> I don't think so.\n\n712\n00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.070\nI think we're good to go.\n\n713\n00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:45.390\n>> All right.\nSounds good.\n\n714\n00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:49.210\nHopefully you guys out there watching\nat home have picked up a lot about\n\n715\n00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:52.780\nhow to

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.320\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.490\nJoining my today in the studio is Mr.\nMike Roderick and Mike,\n\n5\n00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.420\nyou've got something really cool\nlined up for us today, don't you?\n\n6\n00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.970\n>> I do.\n\n7\n00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.980\nIt is show and tell day here at ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.640\nIt was always my favorite day in school.\n\n9\n00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.090\nYou can bring something in.\n\n10\n00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.260\nYou can show all your friends what kind\nof cool stuff you have, well that's what\n\n11\n00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.410\nwe're gonna do here today, is I've got\na server sitting in front of me and\n\n12\n00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.980\nwe're gonna take a look at some\nof the different components.\n\n13\n00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.810\nOn the MTA exam objectives,\n\n14\n00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.900\nthey're gonna call out identify\nmajor server hardware components.\n\n15\n00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.150\nSo we need to be able to recognize what\nthese different pieces are in here.\n\n16\n00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.370\nNow you're gonna find that if you've\never cracked open a PC, your own PC,\n\n17\n00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.210\nyour home PC, or anything like that,\nit's pretty similar to that.\n\n18\n00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.890\nThere might be a few extra pieces here.\n\n19\n00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.230\nA lot more redundancy when\nit comes to these servers.\n\n20\n00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.830\nBut the components are very similar.\n\n21\n00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.810\nOne of the biggest things\nwe'll see is form factor.\n\n22\n00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.880\nThat's a big difference\nwith these servers.\n\n23\n00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.450\nNow servers come in a few\ndifferent form factors.\n\n24\n00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.310\nYou do have a tower form factor, and\n\n25\n00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.560\nit's gonna look much like your\ntower that sits next to your desk.\n\n26\n00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.180\nAlthough it's gonna be a lot\ndeeper than your tower is,\n\n27\n00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.160\nand a lot heavier, typically.\n\n28\n00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.030\nBut that's usually for\nwhat we call SOHO environments or\n\n29\n00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.260\nsmall homes, small home office type\nscenarios, where you don't have a rack.\n\n30\n00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.780\nYou don't have a place to\nput all these servers.\n\n31\n00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.020\nIn fact, you probably only have\nthat one server and that's fine.\n\n32\n00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.850\nWe also have something known as blade\nservers and these are high end,\n\n33\n00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.730\nyou find these in large environments.\n\n34\n00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.360\nWhere it's just an enclosure,\nand each server looks a lot like\n\n35\n00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.510\nthe motherboard you would\nfind in your machine at home.\n\n36\n00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.810\nAnd when you need a new server,\nyou just buy a new blade and\n\n37\n00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.970\nyou slide it into this enclosure.\n\n38\n00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.870\nAnd all the common connecting components,\nthe drives,\n\n39\n00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.730\nthe networking, is on what's called a back\nplane, and you're just sliding a new board\n\n40\n00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.430\nwith a processor and\nthings like that, into there.\n\n41\n00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.850\nSo you're adding multiple\nservers with these blades.\n\n42\n00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.320\nBut the one I've got in front of me here\nis what we call a rack mount server, and\n\n43\n00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.320\nthis is probably,\n\n44\n00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.170\nwhat you'll see more often than not\nin most corporate environments.\n\n45\n00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.550\nIt's designed to go in one of those racks,\nthose floor standing racks.\n\n46\n00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.920\nThey can be half height,\nthey can be whole height.\n\n47\n00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.850\nThese guys slide in real easy.\n\n48\n00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:32.990\nAnd if we take a look at this thing,\n\n49\n00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.860\nyou'll see that I've taken\nthe cover off and it's pretty long.\n\n50\n00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.225\nAs I slide it back and forth,\nI'm gonna guess, somewhere around,\n\n51\n00:02:40.225 --> 00:02:42.075\ntwo, little over two feet.\n\n52\n00:02:42.075 --> 00:02:45.077\nI don't want to go too far to where I\ndump this thing right off of the edge of\n\n53\n00:02:45.077 --> 00:02:45.580\nthe table.\n\n54\n00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.590\n>> They are a little heavy.\n\n55\n00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.623\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n56\n00:02:47.623 --> 00:02:49.885\n>> So you can see I can't even slide it\n\n57\n00:02:49.885 --> 00:02:51.770\nall the way in view.\n\n58\n00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.460\nBut that's a rack mount.\n\n59\n00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.970\nSo we can design to slide into those\nracks you see, in the server closet.\n\n60\n00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.770\nThis guy's only a few inches tall,\nmaybe three at the most,\n\n61\n00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.860\nsomething like that, all right?\n\n62\n00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.150\nOnce we crack the case open on this,\nthough, we'll find that the hardware is\n\n63\n00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.520\npretty easily recognizable,\nif you've ever cracked a PC open before.\n\n64\n00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.930\nIf not, let's take a look.\n\n65\n00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.010\nLet's dive in here and see what we've got.\n\n66\n00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.690\nA couple things that we need\nto be able to recognize.\n\n67\n00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.830\nFirst would be memory, right?\n\n68\n00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.700\nNow on this server as I slide\nthis guy up just a wee bit,\n\n69\n00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.670\nunderneath this little cover here,\nI'm gonna find my memory.\n\n70\n00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.090\nSo there's my sticks of RAM just\nlike you would see in a home PC,\n\n71\n00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.150\nalthough, you'll notice there's\nquite a few slots in here.\n\n72\n00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.790\nAnd then, of course,\n\n73\n00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.580\ndepending on the server,\nis gonna depend on how much it supports.\n\n74\n00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.050\nOn this one, we've actually got\nexpansion slots off to the side.\n\n75\n00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.490\nOr you can see the top of\na stick of RAM over here, and\n\n76\n00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.921\nI can put more RAM over there, all right?\n\n77\n00:03:52.921 --> 00:03:58.466\nIt's got a lot of memory of\nthe capabilities to hold a lot of memory,\n\n78\n00:03:58.466 --> 00:03:59.460\ndisk wise.\n\n79\n00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.610\nWell, let's stay inside here.\n\n80\n00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.830\nLet's do, so we got our RAM, other things\nwe need to be able to recognize CPUs.\n\n81\n00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.730\nI'll slide this guy back just a wee bit.\n\n82\n00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.270\nYou're not going to be able to see\nthe CPUs because they're residing\n\n83\n00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.200\nunderneath these heat sinks.\n\n84\n00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.620\nThese are my big heat sinks that\nare probably, I don't know, an inch and\n\n85\n00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.130\na half by five inches or so.\n\n86\n00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.340\nThere's two of them.\n\n87\n00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.420\nBecause I have two processors\nin the server, one for\n\n88\n00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.020\neach one to keep those processors cool.\n\n89\n00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.950\nIf I can get Jason to\npull up my screen here,\n\n90\n00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.850\nI've got a picture that I took of\nthis server just a minute ago.\n\n91\n00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.060\nSo from the side, you can kinda\nsee underneath these heat sinks,\n\n92\n00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.025\nis where my processors\nare going to reside, all right.\n\n93\n00:04:41.025 --> 00:04:42.660\nThey're gonna look like\nany other processor,\n\n94\n00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.670\nnothing too fancy to look at there.\n\n95\n00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.270\nBut again, there's two of them, right.\n\n96\n00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.900\nWhich you might not see that often on\na home PC, because this is a server\n\n97\n00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.890\ndesigned to support connections from\nmultiple users simultaneously, and\n\n98\n00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.270\nproviding services to the network,\nwe need that extra power.\n\n99\n00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.520\nSo we've got our memory,\nwe've got our CPU.\n\n100\n00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.540\nAnd then while we're in here,\nwe'll flip back over to that sky cam.\n\n101\n00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.010\nWe can see some of the cooling\ninvolved in here, all right?\n\n102\n00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.920\nSo right in front of each one of\nthese heat sinks, are some fans.\n\n103\n00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.170\nAnd these fans,\n\n104\n00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.090\nthere's actually four of them,\nif I can get this little latch to open up.\n\n105\n00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.990\nOne of these guys will pop out for\nme, there we go.\n\n106\n00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.670\nYou can see these\nare actually smaller fans.\n\n107\n00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.790\nBut there are four of them, two sitting\nin front of each one of those processors.\n\n108\n00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.380\nAlso notice, how easy it was for\nme to pop that fan out and put it back in.\n\n109\n00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.630\nThese servers are designed\nto be very modular,\n\n110\n00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.120\nvery easy to get in and\nreplace any component that has failed.\n\n111\n00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.950\nThere's also some more fans towards the\nback of this server that help pull that\n\n112\n00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.440\nhot air out then blow it\nout the back of the case.\n\n113\n00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.000\nSo we've got our CPU, we've got our RAM,\nwe've got our cooling in here,\n\n114\n00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.310\nwhat else do we need to look at there,\nDaniel?\n\n115\n00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.560\n>> Let's see here, well,\nthere's power supplies.\n\n116\n00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.070\n>> Power supplies.\n\n117\n00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.650\nYou've got to have power to run this guy,\nright?\n\n118\n00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.770\nI don't think I can slide this up\nfar enough for you to see, but\n\n119\n00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.600\nI do have a picture of\nthe back of this machine.\n\n120\n00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.740\nAnd on the back here, you're gonna\nsee these two little handles and\n\n121\n00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.400\nthese are two separate power supplies.\n\n122\n00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.020\nAgain, redundancy.\n\n123\n00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.240\nIf one of those power supplies, and\n\n124\n00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.770\nthe server can run off just\none of those power supplies.\n\n125\n00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.740\nIf one of them fails, however, the other\none is still there, keeps on truckin',\n\n126\n00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.240\nserver's still up and running.\n\n127\n00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.790\nAnd then watch how easy this is,\n\n128\n00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.608\nif we flip back over to that sky cam for\na second.\n\n129\n00:06:34.608 --> 00:06:37.380\nYou're not gonna see this actual process,\nbut all I'm doing is lifting\n\n130\n00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.060\nup that little black handle, and there's\nthe power supply that I just took out.\n\n131\n00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.170\nThere's that black handle,\nwe were just looking at the picture of.\n\n132\n00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:46.493\n>> More modularity, right?\n\n133\n00:06:46.493 --> 00:06:50.398\nSaying if that power supply goes bad, well\nyou've got the redundant power supply,\n\n134\n00:06:50.398 --> 00:06:52.060\nthe server's gonna keep rocking.\n\n135\n00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.880\nYou can go right into that server closet,\n\n136\n00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.040\nsnatch the power cable out of the back\nof that thing, pull this guy out,\n\n137\n00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.430\ndo a warranty job, or maybe you've\ngot a hot spare sitting there.\n\n138\n00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.290\nSlide it right back in, plug the cable\nback in, and you're off to the races.\n\n139\n00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:09.802\nThis is what makes servers really up and\nabove the home PC.\n\n140\n00:07:09.802 --> 00:07:14.262\nEven though you can use that type of PC\nas a server because basically, servers\n\n141\n00:07:14.262 --> 00:07:19.203\nare usually just a type of software giving\nyou a service, but for the redundancy, for\n\n142\n00:07:19.203 --> 00:07:23.490\nthat mission critical type of environment,\nthis is the way you wanna go.\n\n143\n00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.790\n>> Absolutely, and he's exactly right, I\nmean, I should have a few of these sitting\n\n144\n00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:32.310\nin my closet somewhere, so that when that\npower supply fails, I don't have to wait.\n\n145\n00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:35.810\nDell can ship me another one, but\nI already got one in there and\n\n146\n00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:39.910\nthat new one that comes in just goes into\nthe closet, and becomes my new spare.\n\n147\n00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.970\nSo we'll pop that guy back in there.\n\n148\n00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:45.020\nAs we got our power supply again,\nredundancy there.\n\n149\n00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.187\nAnother one we gotta deal with,\nDaniel, is networking, right?\n\n150\n00:07:48.187 --> 00:07:52.762\nNow you're not gonna see a big network\nadapter, like you might on your home PC.\n\n151\n00:07:52.762 --> 00:07:55.955\nIn this, it's built in or\nit's on the motherboard.\n\n152\n00:07:55.955 --> 00:07:57.734\nA lot of our home PCs have that, as well.\n\n153\n00:07:57.734 --> 00:08:00.590\nYou have that integrated network\nadapter on the motherboard.\n\n154\n00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:04.540\nA lot of times we'll add an expansion\ncard if we want a faster one.\n\n155\n00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.330\nThis guy actually has two of them.\n\n156\n00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.204\nAnd if we take a look at one of\nthese pictures again over here.\n\n157\n00:08:08.204 --> 00:08:11.230\nIf I can find it, there she is.\n\n158\n00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:12.370\nThere's the other side.\n\n159\n00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.740\nThis is still on the back of the server,\n\n160\n00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.290\nyou can see the edge of that power supply\nover here to the left of that image.\n\n161\n00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:21.600\nBut then over here I can\nsee my network adapters.\n\n162\n00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:27.302\nI got two gigabit network adapters\nbuilt in or integrated on this board.\n\n163\n00:08:27.302 --> 00:08:31.470\nAnd again, redundancy,\nI'm gonna have those cables.\n\n164\n00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:35.450\nI'm gonna have this server hooked\nup to two separate switches.\n\n165\n00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.270\nSo if one of those switches fails,\nthis guy's still communicating.\n\n166\n00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:41.240\nHe's still on the network,\npeople can still access resources.\n\n167\n00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:46.076\nWhen both of them are up, we can do some\nbinding or some NIC Teaming where we\n\n168\n00:08:46.076 --> 00:08:50.683\nstart doubling up on our throughput but\nthe whole idea is redundancy.\n\n169\n00:08:50.683 --> 00:08:54.580\nIf one of those guys fails my\nserver is not out of commission.\n\n170\n00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.060\nEverything is still working.\n\n171\n00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.440\nI just have to get in there and\nfigure out how to fix that.\n\n172\n00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.380\nNow, in this case, because it's integrated\nfixing it's not gonna be so easy.\n\n173\n00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.510\nSo we could limp along until\nwe can figure that out.\n\n174\n00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:08.100\nWe might have to replace\nthe board at that point.\n\n175\n00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.600\nThat is the downside of\nintegrated components.\n\n176\n00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:15.080\nBut NICs like that typically don't fail.\n\n177\n00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.740\nSo hopefully we'll be okay there.\n\n178\n00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.090\n>> And these are usually pretty safe\nfrom environmental factors, lightning,\n\n179\n00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:21.990\npower surges and things like that.\n\n180\n00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:25.990\nHopefully, you have something that\ncosts this much money on some sort of\n\n181\n00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:29.960\nuninterruptible power supply with surge\nprotection, all that, spike protection.\n\n182\n00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.150\nThere's a lot of line conditioners and\nthings you can install, make sure that\n\n183\n00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:37.810\nthe power's always clean coming through\nthere and of course, on networking, you're\n\n184\n00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:41.690\nnot gonna have to worry about a lightning\nstrike coming through your internal LAN.\n\n185\n00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:43.440\nThat's not likely to happen.\n\n186\n00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.294\n>> Exactly right.\n\n187\n00:09:44.294 --> 00:09:46.900\nNow, let's see,\nnext on our list there Daniel,\n\n188\n00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.020\nI think we wanna talk about hard drives.\n\n189\n00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.000\n>> Hard drives!\n>> We gotta have hard drives.\n\n190\n00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:51.750\nThis is pretty cool.\n\n191\n00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.110\nIf you've never been around a server,\ncheck this out.\n\n192\n00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:57.580\nI'm gonna slide this guy up so\nDaniel can get a better view of the front.\n\n193\n00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.381\nAnd Daniel, why don't you grab you\none of those hard drives there?\n\n194\n00:10:00.381 --> 00:10:02.691\n[SOUND] What?\n\n195\n00:10:02.691 --> 00:10:04.160\n>> There you go.\n\n196\n00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.830\n>> It was that easy.\n\n197\n00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.480\nThis is all hot swappable, well,\nI shouldn't say hot swappable,\n\n198\n00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:12.509\nit's gonna depend on the technology, but\nas far as ease of removal and replacement.\n\n199\n00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:14.910\nThese guys are fantastic.\n\n200\n00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:17.060\nHe was just able to slide that drive out.\n\n201\n00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:21.505\nAnd if we flip that over,\nwe take a look at that Skycam again,\n\n202\n00:10:21.505 --> 00:10:25.090\nyou can see it's just\na hard drive inside a tray.\n\n203\n00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:30.040\nAnd it's the tray that's giving me\nthe ability to slide that out so\n\n204\n00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.610\neasy and pop it back in.\n\n205\n00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:32.937\nI'll see if I can put Daniel to the test,\n\n206\n00:10:32.937 --> 00:10:34.549\nlet's see if you can get\nit back in there Daniel.\n\n207\n00:10:34.549 --> 00:10:37.950\nDaniel's doing this from\nthe side without looking.\n\n208\n00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.610\n>> Let's see here.\n\n209\n00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:40.947\n>> All right.\n>> There you go.\n\n210\n00:10:40.947 --> 00:10:41.806\n>> How easy is that.\n\n211\n00:10:41.806 --> 00:10:45.141\nAnd if these drives\nare configured properly,\n\n212\n00:10:45.141 --> 00:10:50.613\nif we're doing RAID arrays, where I\ncan can handle a single drive failure,\n\n213\n00:10:50.613 --> 00:10:55.080\nwe can do that while the server's up and\nrunning.\n\n214\n00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.530\nI mean if Daniel comes in in the morning\nand his job is to walk down and\n\n215\n00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:59.070\nlook at the lights on\nthe front of those drives.\n\n216\n00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:01.180\nGreen, green, green, green, green, red.\n\n217\n00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:05.040\nPop it out, pop another one in,\nslam it closed.\n\n218\n00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.430\nIt'll start rebuilding that RAID\narray on the fly, we're good to go.\n\n219\n00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:12.360\nNow, performance is gonna be\nhorrible during this time but\n\n220\n00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.630\nhey, it's still up, it's still running.\n\n221\n00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.820\nSo hard drives are gonna be\nswappable out there and that,\n\n222\n00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.490\nagain, it depends on the form factor.\n\n223\n00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:24.520\nLike I said, this guy's only, in fact,\nwe look at the front of this machine.\n\n224\n00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.170\nOne of my pictures I have here.\n\n225\n00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:32.570\nYou see I basically have six drive bays,\nI have two, two, and then two.\n\n226\n00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:34.730\nSo six total drives there.\n\n227\n00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:38.120\nAnd this is only about three inches or\nso tall.\n\n228\n00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:42.820\nYou can get a larger server form factor,\nstill rack mount, but\n\n229\n00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.320\nlet's say double the height.\n\n230\n00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.400\nNow, all of a sudden, I can flip\nthose drives up on their edges and\n\n231\n00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:51.040\nwe can start putting them in this way,\nand we can fit even more in there.\n\n232\n00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.000\nSo it depends on the form\nfactor of the server,\n\n233\n00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.146\nhow many drives we can fit in there.\n\n234\n00:11:56.146 --> 00:11:58.050\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n235\n00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:03.200\nSo we've got drives, let's see, graphics\ncards, that was a little tricky to show.\n\n236\n00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.222\n>> Actually,\nI can see the graphics chip on the board.\n\n237\n00:12:06.222 --> 00:12:08.390\n>> Let's see, let's see if we can find it.\n\n238\n00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:13.360\n>> Go ahead and slide her forward a little\nbit there, little more, little more, and\n\n239\n00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:18.450\nalmost to the edge there, and\nif you can look, right there it says ATI.\n\n240\n00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:22.050\nIt's a little hard to see, but\nit does say mobility Radeon.\n\n241\n00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:23.580\nBut its integrated graphics chip.\n\n242\n00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.560\nSo trying to stay away from\nanything on that they can\n\n243\n00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.590\nintegrate on the board that's\nnot missions critical.\n\n244\n00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:31.610\nGraphics drivers, I'm sorry,\nthe graphics card itself.\n\n245\n00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:32.690\nThe NICs as well.\n\n246\n00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:35.489\nThey're gonna integrate it on the board,\nit takes up less space and\n\n247\n00:12:35.489 --> 00:12:37.168\nallows us to use the one uniform factor.\n\n248\n00:12:37.168 --> 00:12:39.914\nIf we had a larger board or\nif we needed more graphics,\n\n249\n00:12:39.914 --> 00:12:42.130\nwe might need an expansion card for that.\n\n250\n00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:43.890\nBut on this one right in.\n\n251\n00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:44.710\n>> Exactly.\n\n252\n00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:45.480\nIt's a server.\n\n253\n00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:49.700\nWe're not playing the latest and greatest\ngames out there or anything like that.\n\n254\n00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.058\n>> No Master Chief, right?\n\n255\n00:12:51.058 --> 00:12:53.640\n[LAUGH]\n>> We don't need 60 frames per second\n\n256\n00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.330\non my server here.\n\n257\n00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.031\nSo you see that integrated NIC there and\nit's exactly right.\n\n258\n00:12:58.031 --> 00:13:00.450\nWe integrated graphics card.\n\n259\n00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:04.300\nWe don't have all those expansion slots\nthat you see in your tower at home, right.\n\n260\n00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.570\nWhen you guys are building your machine,\n\n261\n00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:11.500\nyou're getting that motherboard that has\nsix, eight, nine expansion slots in there.\n\n262\n00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.272\nDon't have that in here we're\ntrying to keep as Daniel said,\n\n263\n00:13:13.272 --> 00:13:14.273\ntrying to keep that size compact.\n\n264\n00:13:14.273 --> 00:13:18.670\nNetwork adapters,\ngraphics just integrative.\n\n265\n00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:22.400\nWe don't need top of the line,\nwe need stability and\n\n266\n00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:28.000\nperformance and just good stable\nperformance, is what I mean there.\n\n267\n00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.940\n>> With service it's really more, like\nyou said, that stability by having what\n\n268\n00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.480\nthe beefy, Macdaddy power supplies.\n\n269\n00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.950\nHaving the ability to have large\nstorage capacities built in.\n\n270\n00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:42.089\nOr you probably don't have\nthat in your home PC.\n\n271\n00:13:42.089 --> 00:13:43.800\nYou maybe get two drives in there.\n\n272\n00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.050\nMaybe even three if you take\nsome other components out.\n\n273\n00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:48.000\nBut that's about it.\n\n274\n00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.425\nWhereas these, I've got six drives.\n\n275\n00:13:49.425 --> 00:13:50.505\nI can do a RAID.\n\n276\n00:13:50.505 --> 00:13:53.642\nIt's probably got a third party\nRAID controller on it, so\n\n277\n00:13:53.642 --> 00:13:56.630\nthat I can do hardware\nRAID on these things.\n\n278\n00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:59.880\nThat's what it's for,\nthat's what it's giving the room over to\n\n279\n00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.850\nmake sure you have those capabilities,\nand not so much that we can play Halo.\n\n280\n00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:05.820\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] It's hard to Van Mark.\n\n281\n00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.912\nBecause we were getting ready to spin\nit up and say, hey, frag each other.\n\n282\n00:14:08.912 --> 00:14:12.745\n[LAUGH] Let's see, other things we need\nto be aware of are gonna be ports.\n\n283\n00:14:12.745 --> 00:14:16.200\nAnd let's take a look at\nanother picture I have here.\n\n284\n00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.780\nI'll go to the back of this machine.\n\n285\n00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:21.140\nThere we go.\n\n286\n00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.010\nRemember, we're looking at\nthose network adapters, and\n\n287\n00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:25.800\nyou can see several other\nports along there, as well.\n\n288\n00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:32.640\nThere's a VGA port, looks like a, well,\nthere's a serial port over there.\n\n289\n00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.590\nThat's some kind of\nmaintenance uplink port.\n\n290\n00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:37.308\nYou got some PS2?\n\n291\n00:14:37.308 --> 00:14:40.280\nWow, good old PS2s,\nbeen around for a while.\n\n292\n00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.770\n>> If all you've got's that\nold PS2 keyboard and mouse,\n\n293\n00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:44.960\nI mean, it's like,\nlying around in the server room.\n\n294\n00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.060\nYou can grab them and plug them in.\n\n295\n00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:46.758\nOr even KVMs.\n\n296\n00:14:46.758 --> 00:14:48.035\n>> Yeah, KVMs, exactly.\n\n297\n00:14:48.035 --> 00:14:50.816\nAnd then,\nwe've got just underneath my picture,\n\n298\n00:14:50.816 --> 00:14:53.208\nif I can get him to take\naway that box in box for\n\n299\n00:14:53.208 --> 00:14:57.840\njust a second you'll see it does have\na couple USB ports over there, as well.\n\n300\n00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.280\nAnd then, if I flip around to\nthe front of this machine,\n\n301\n00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.362\nI got a little jittery\nwith the camera here.\n\n302\n00:15:03.362 --> 00:15:04.162\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I apologize.\n\n303\n00:15:04.162 --> 00:15:05.956\nIt's a little blurry.\n\n304\n00:15:05.956 --> 00:15:11.250\nWhich there's a couple of USB ports\nright here, another VGA port here.\n\n305\n00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.535\nI don't think this has the PS2s on\nthe front, not this particular one.\n\n306\n00:15:16.535 --> 00:15:19.380\nSome of them will also have\nthose PS2 ports up there, but\n\n307\n00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:22.100\nif you're using a USB keyboard and mouse,\nheck, you can plug them right there.\n\n308\n00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.090\nYou don't even have to go around\nto the back of the computer.\n\n309\n00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:29.960\nSo they do have some ports that gives us a\nlittle bit of expandability there on these\n\n310\n00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:34.700\nservers, but probably not what you're\naccustomed to on say your own machines.\n\n311\n00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:38.260\n>> Yeah, Mike, I don't know if you've ever\nseen the backside of a server closet.\n\n312\n00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:42.650\nIt's usually a tangled web of\nbird nests and spider webs.\n\n313\n00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.682\nIt's just crazy with all the wires, so\n\n314\n00:15:44.682 --> 00:15:47.514\nhaving that port like that\nVGA port right on the front,\n\n315\n00:15:47.514 --> 00:15:51.578\nhaving a couple USBs right on the front,\nthat does make it a whole lot easier for\n\n316\n00:15:51.578 --> 00:15:55.245\nus to gain access to the server using\na keyboard, mouse and a monitor.\n\n317\n00:15:55.245 --> 00:15:58.539\nBecause it's usually a whole [LAUGH] lot\ncleaner on the front side than it is on\n\n318\n00:15:58.539 --> 00:15:59.216\nthe back side.\n\n319\n00:15:59.216 --> 00:15:59.877\n>> Oh, absolutely.\n\n320\n00:15:59.877 --> 00:16:04.272\nWe've got a KVM in there, in our server\ncloset, I can Never remember the command\n\n321\n00:16:04.272 --> 00:16:07.591\nto switch from one machine to another,\nso its frustrating.\n\n322\n00:16:07.591 --> 00:16:10.830\nBut exactly, like you say, if I walk\nin there with a keyboard and mouse and\n\n323\n00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:13.911\nmonitor, I can just plug into that server,\ncheck it out, unplug it,\n\n324\n00:16:13.911 --> 00:16:16.627\nmove it to another server, so\nyou can just have a little cart,\n\n325\n00:16:16.627 --> 00:16:20.022\nthere you can roll that stuff around on,\nwe do need to upgrade our KBM though,\n\n326\n00:16:20.022 --> 00:16:21.607\nour KBM [CROSSTALK]\n>> The IP KBM,\n\n327\n00:16:21.607 --> 00:16:23.445\nthat's the way to go [LAUGH].\n\n328\n00:16:23.445 --> 00:16:25.244\n>> Instead of running\nall those crazy cables.\n\n329\n00:16:25.244 --> 00:16:28.090\nAll right, let's see what else\nwe've got for components here.\n\n330\n00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:30.470\nWe talked about power usage ports, heck,\n\n331\n00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:34.180\nDaniel, I think we've hit\nmost of the major components.\n\n332\n00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:38.760\nWe didn't call out the board itself, but\nyou know you probably have seen it before.\n\n333\n00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:43.670\nOh, I can show you a back plane if\nI slide this guy up, just a wee bit\n\n334\n00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:48.120\nyou know where we were pulling all those\ndrives out, is right here on the front.\n\n335\n00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:52.120\nSo those drives are coming in, and\nthey're ending about right there,\n\n336\n00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:55.510\nnotice we didn't have any cables when we\npulled that drive out right there was\n\n337\n00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:59.410\nnothing to no power cable, no SATA cable,\nno nothing going to the back of it.\n\n338\n00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:03.705\nAnd that's cuz there's a board\nright under this metal rail,\n\n339\n00:17:03.705 --> 00:17:07.320\nthat actually sitting\nvertically like this.\n\n340\n00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:10.470\nAnd on that board are the connectors for\nthe drive but\n\n341\n00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:12.720\nthey're soldered to that board.\n\n342\n00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:16.870\nSo when you're sliding these drives in,\nthe back of the drive is hitting that\n\n343\n00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:21.940\nboard and those sockets are lined up\nperfectly, so it's plugging that drive in.\n\n344\n00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:25.530\nAnd that's why I don't have to worry about\nrunning cables, or pulling the drive\n\n345\n00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:28.570\nhalfway out, and trying to get that cable\noff the back or anything like that.\n\n346\n00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:30.580\nThat's known as the back plane.\n\n347\n00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:33.330\nThat's the connectivity point for\nall of these drives.\n\n348\n00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:36.480\nThis is a rare server,\nyou don't see it as much anymore.\n\n349\n00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.930\nIt has a floppy drive on it,\nsitting up here on the top.\n\n350\n00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:41.740\nIt has a DVD drive sitting up here.\n\n351\n00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.750\nSomething you don't see in\na lot of servers nowadays.\n\n352\n00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:45.800\n>> No no.\nThey're not coming with those as much as\n\n353\n00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:46.520\nthey used to.\n\n354\n00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.470\nSo, this is a rare bird, indeed.\n\n355\n00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:52.810\nI did also like the fact,\nthat if you take a look at the fans,\n\n356\n00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:55.710\nyou'll notice that everything's\nkind of built to flow.\n\n357\n00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:58.550\nYou'll see it, Mike if you could move\nthe server forward just a hair here.\n\n358\n00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:02.070\nYou see all these fans right here,\nand you've got these heat sinks, and\n\n359\n00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:05.230\nthis black piece of plastic that Mike\nwas moving out of the way so we can\n\n360\n00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:09.470\nsee the ram slots, what is it on the back\nside of that but a couple of other fans.\n\n361\n00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:12.680\nAir is designed to flow from\nthe front through the back\n\n362\n00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.350\ncooling the entirety of the board.\n\n363\n00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:16.470\nKeeping those RAM sticks cool.\n\n364\n00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.180\nKeeping obviously our processors,\nwe gotta keep that cool.\n\n365\n00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.550\nAs move through here,\nthat's how its designed to work.\n\n366\n00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:24.720\nAnd then any of these that go bad on us,\nwell,\n\n367\n00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.280\nwe can just grab them and pull them out.\n\n368\n00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.890\nProbably, have a bunch of hot\nspares sitting around somewhere,\n\n369\n00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:31.360\nbut it's a really smart design.\n\n370\n00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:35.180\nAnd if you've ever been on the backside of\na server closet again, as you wade through\n\n371\n00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.750\nthe tangled mess, you'll notice\nit's a whole lot warmer back there.\n\n372\n00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:43.090\nI know a lot of guys, just huddling up\nlike, oh, it's so much [INAUDIBLE].\n\n373\n00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:47.520\nServer closets tend to be quite cool cuz\nthese things generate a bit of heat.\n\n374\n00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:52.660\nAnd they build these fans, in such a way\nas to flow that heat away from it.\n\n375\n00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.340\nSo, all those servers\nare pushing heat out the back.\n\n376\n00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.920\nAnd that's how that's designed to do that.\n\n377\n00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.760\nFrom the front to back\nyou see all those fans.\n\n378\n00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.070\n>> Yeah, everything is put in there for\na reason.\n\n379\n00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:02.340\nThere's nothing extra in here.\n\n380\n00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:05.920\nIn fact, this little shroud\nthat I've got is broken.\n\n381\n00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:08.160\nOne of the little hinges\nhas actually broke off.\n\n382\n00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.103\nSo you might think,\n[SOUND] we'll just throw that away.\n\n383\n00:19:10.103 --> 00:19:10.870\nHeck, no, right.\n\n384\n00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:15.784\nI wanna put this back in here as best\nas I can cuz that's what's helping make\n\n385\n00:19:15.784 --> 00:19:19.996\nthat air, as Daniel said,\nflow in across those sticks of RAM and\n\n386\n00:19:19.996 --> 00:19:24.131\nthen out to these two fans in\nthe back that he was pointing out and\n\n387\n00:19:24.131 --> 00:19:27.190\nthen out the back side of that computer.\n\n388\n00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:30.700\nWithout that shroud, these fans\nare gonna be pulling that cold air in.\n\n389\n00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.920\nIt's gonna hit these heat sinks and\nthen it's gonna dissipate around.\n\n390\n00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:37.530\nAnd some of it's gonna go this way, and\nthese fans are still pulling air, but\n\n391\n00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:38.420\nit's not efficient.\n\n392\n00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:39.350\nNot like they designed it.\n\n393\n00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:41.870\nYou're gonna see temperatures,\nit won't take long.\n\n394\n00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:43.580\nTemperatures will start\nrising in that server,\n\n395\n00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:45.550\nyou're gonna get overheating issues.\n\n396\n00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:47.010\nAnd it's not gonna be a good day.\n\n397\n00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:47.894\nThat server's not gonna last that long.\n\n398\n00:19:47.894 --> 00:19:48.858\n>> I've got two words for you, Mike.\n\n399\n00:19:48.858 --> 00:19:50.274\n>> Uh-huh?\n>> Thermal shut down.\n\n400\n00:19:50.274 --> 00:19:53.060\n[LAUGH] On a production server?\n\n401\n00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.776\nThose are two words you don't wanna hear.\n\n402\n00:19:54.776 --> 00:19:55.276\n[LAUGH]\n>> No you don't.\n\n403\n00:19:55.276 --> 00:19:56.250\nAnd that's why it's so\n\n404\n00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:58.950\nfrigid inside the server\ncloset as Daniel was saying.\n\n405\n00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:01.854\nAlthough [LAUGH] sometimes it is\nnice to get behind those guys there.\n\n406\n00:20:01.854 --> 00:20:02.376\n>> Very toasty.\n\n407\n00:20:02.376 --> 00:20:03.290\n>> Yes it is.\n\n408\n00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:05.270\nAll right, so\nthat is most of the components,\n\n409\n00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:09.250\nI think, that we really need to worry\nabout at this point for the MTA exam.\n\n410\n00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:10.750\nBe able to recognize those.\n\n411\n00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:15.070\nUnderstand what a processor is,\nwhat memory is, what a hard drive is.\n\n412\n00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:18.290\nYou should have those\nconcepts down pat by now.\n\n413\n00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:19.850\nIf not, do a refresher.\n\n414\n00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:21.660\nIn fact, we can do a quick recap.\n\n415\n00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:24.860\nJust to make sure everybody's familiar\nwith this cuz you might just be diving\n\n416\n00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:28.430\ninto the IT field, that is one\nof the reasons this exam exists.\n\n417\n00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:32.180\nThe CPU that we talk about, that's the\nbrains of the computer, that's where all\n\n418\n00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:37.150\nthe calculations are occurring and\nthe RAM, the random access memory,\n\n419\n00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:42.370\nthat is where all of the data that's\nbeing manipulated or worked with resides.\n\n420\n00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:45.560\nThen you've got the hard drives,\nthat's our permanent storage.\n\n421\n00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.210\nThat's where we save things to,\n\n422\n00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:52.720\nwhen we shut down everything goes to\nthe hard drive because RAM is volatile.\n\n423\n00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.270\nThe information that's\nstored in RAM disappears\n\n424\n00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:56.930\nwhen you power the machine down.\n\n425\n00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:00.220\nSo it all gets written to the hard\ndrive and then the machine shuts down.\n\n426\n00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.610\nWhen that operating system\nloads up again the next day and\n\n427\n00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:05.900\nwhen you power that server up again,\neverything gets written back to RAM,\n\n428\n00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:06.980\nloads up the operating system,\n\n429\n00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:10.760\nwhatever applications you're running,\nthings like that get loaded in RAM.\n\n430\n00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.360\nWhat else do we talk about?\n\n431\n00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.740\nNetwork adapters,\nconnect us to the network right?\n\n432\n00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:21.530\nWhat else, power supplies, take that AC\ncurrent that we're getting from the wall,\n\n433\n00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:25.470\nconvert it into DC or direct current\nthat we can use inside this server.\n\n434\n00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:26.520\n>> Graphics.\n\n435\n00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:29.810\n>> Graphics cards, right, that's what's\ngiving me that on screen display.\n\n436\n00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:33.590\nTaking all those 1's and\n0's that the computer's manipulating and\n\n437\n00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:37.000\nturning it into something my little old\neyes can recognize, pretty pictures,\n\n438\n00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.140\nwizards,\n>> That's kind of helpful.\n\n439\n00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:42.040\n>> You know it is, it's not the matrix, I\ncan't read those green numbers coming down\n\n440\n00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.530\nthere, so graphics are very important.\n\n441\n00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:45.510\nDid I miss anything in there?\n\n442\n00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:49.450\n>> Just some ports and power supplies,\nI guess but you already covered that.\n\n443\n00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:50.890\n>> Yeah ports you know.\n\n444\n00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:51.760\nExpandability.\n\n445\n00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:55.340\nThe only other thing I do want to mention,\nthey call it out, it's a strange place but\n\n446\n00:21:55.340 --> 00:22:00.310\nthey do call it out in these objectives,\nthat's 32 bit versus 64 bit.\n\n447\n00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:03.260\nAnd what they're referring to\nthere is the architecture,\n\n448\n00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:05.760\nthe platform architecture of the machine.\n\n449\n00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:10.050\nWe can either get 32 bit machines or\nwe can get 64 bit machines.\n\n450\n00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:12.908\nWhat that means is, remember,\na bit is a one or a zero.\n\n451\n00:22:12.908 --> 00:22:18.280\nA 32 bit system has a data bus\nthat's going into that processor\n\n452\n00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.740\nthat's 32 bits wide.\n\n453\n00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:24.360\nYou can think of it like a 32 lane\nhighway feeding data into that processor.\n\n454\n00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:27.580\nSo in that processor,\nI can take 32 ones and\n\n455\n00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:31.650\nzeros at one time, and\nfeed it to the processor.\n\n456\n00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:33.711\nA 64 bit system doubles\nup the number of lanes.\n\n457\n00:22:33.711 --> 00:22:38.230\nRight, now I've got 64 lanes or 64 ones\nand zeros being fed across that bus say,\n\n458\n00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:42.320\ngoing into the processor and\ngoing into the other components as well.\n\n459\n00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.420\nRight.\nSo that's 64 bit.\n\n460\n00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:47.070\nAnd there's a big advantage of\nrunning 64 bit over 32 bit.\n\n461\n00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:50.510\nIn fact, the later versions\nof server operating system\n\n462\n00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:54.190\nare no longer available in 32 bit,\nthey're only gonna be 64 bit.\n\n463\n00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:57.870\n2008 was right about that line where they\nsaid, you know what, we're gonna stop\n\n464\n00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:02.100\nmaking 32 bit operating systems for\nserver, we're going to only make 64 bit.\n\n465\n00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:05.490\nOur client operating systems\nare slowly going that way.\n\n466\n00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.570\nFor servers at this point, its all 64 bit.\n\n467\n00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:11.650\nThe reason is, the efficiency.\n\n468\n00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:15.800\nSo much more data can be traversed\nacross that BUS, into the processor.\n\n469\n00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:21.298\nAs well as another big key to 64 bit\nis how much memory it can recognize.\n\n470\n00:23:21.298 --> 00:23:25.380\nWith a 32 bit system,\nyou're gonna be limited to 4 gigabytes.\n\n471\n00:23:26.455 --> 00:23:31.210\nCuz of the way the addressing scheme\nworks, and I tried to draw this up here.\n\n472\n00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:35.850\nI've got a little drawing I did here on my\nmachine to see if we could visualize this.\n\n473\n00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:38.430\nBut basically, when you look at memory,\n\n474\n00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:43.980\nevery bit needs an address If I've\ngot four gigabytes of RAM.\n\n475\n00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:47.880\nThen I've got four billion,\ntwo hundred and some odd million, so\n\n476\n00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:51.390\nmany thousand bits of data that\nI can store in there, right?\n\n477\n00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:56.080\nAll the way from zero,\nthat very first bit, to the very last bit,\n\n478\n00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:58.080\nwhich is gonna be, this is its address.\n\n479\n00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:03.200\nWhen the system wants to write data to\nthis spot or read data to that spot,\n\n480\n00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:08.010\nor write data to it or read data from\nit it has to call at its address.\n\n481\n00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:13.250\nThere's 32 ones right there\nthat would reference the very\n\n482\n00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:19.190\nlast spot in four gigs of RAM, all right,\nwhat if I have more then four gigs of RAM,\n\n483\n00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:26.280\nwhat if I want to address something\nover here, well, let's do that again.\n\n484\n00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:30.480\nIt's not going to give me my\nlittle tiny box there, but\n\n485\n00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:33.970\nimagine I wanted to address\nsomething way over here.\n\n486\n00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:37.150\nWell, I'm going to need more ones.\n\n487\n00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:40.640\nRight?\nThis is as far as I can go with 32 bits.\n\n488\n00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.320\nI can't make a bigger number.\n\n489\n00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:47.100\nSo with 64 bits I double\nthe number of bits I had there.\n\n490\n00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:52.360\nSo now, I can address RAM way\nbeyond that four gigabyte barrier.\n\n491\n00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:56.680\nAll right, and we know in today's systems,\nwe need more then four gigabytes of RAM,\n\n492\n00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:00.870\neven in your home systems, you have\nat least two probably if not more,\n\n493\n00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:05.790\nin these servers we're talking 64,\n128 gigs of RAM that we want to use,\n\n494\n00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:10.110\nwe need that 64 bit operating system\nto take advantage of all that memory.\n\n495\n00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:14.050\n>> Well, and fortunately, most of the\nserver that you buy today are going to be\n\n496\n00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:18.480\na 64 bit architecture cuz heck, that's the\nway we're going its cause like he said,\n\n497\n00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.530\nwe need that much ram especially\nwhen it comes to virtualization.\n\n498\n00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:25.970\nThey need tons of RAM cuz you're\nusing one piece of physical hardware\n\n499\n00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:29.038\nto support multiple\nvirtualized pieces of hardware.\n\n500\n00:25:29.038 --> 00:25:32.340\nSo they're gonna be allocating two gigs\nfor that server, two gigs for that server.\n\n501\n00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.470\nYou think it sounds, 64 sounds like a lot,\n\n502\n00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:39.320\nuntil you work in a large environment and\nyou've got 15, 20, 30,\n\n503\n00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:42.770\n50 servers all trying to share this\nresources, they run out really quickly.\n\n504\n00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:46.960\nSo even though it sounds like a lot,\nit just depends on where you're working.\n\n505\n00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.944\nMike we've covered a lot today.\n\n506\n00:25:48.944 --> 00:25:50.791\n>> We did.\n>> Hopefully, our viewers now,\n\n507\n00:25:50.791 --> 00:25:54.674\neven though you might have been familiar\nwith what a processor is, what is memory,\n\n508\n00:25:54.674 --> 00:25:56.515\nhow do you find that inside of a server.\n\n509\n00:25:56.515 --> 00:25:58.385\nHopefully, that's where you're at now.\n\n510\n00:25:58.385 --> 00:26:02.795\nYou can, this is a dell server, you crack\nopen an HP server, you crack open whatever\n\n511\n00:26:02.795 --> 00:26:06.435\ntype of server, you're gonna be able\nto go, oh, yes, just from looking.\n\n512\n00:26:06.435 --> 00:26:07.155\nThere's the fans,\n\n513\n00:26:07.155 --> 00:26:12.210\nthere's the power supplies, there's\nthe graphics, hard drives, you name it.\n\n514\n00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:13.300\nYou're a little easier.\n\n515\n00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.312\nWell, Michael, thank you so\nmuch for pointing these out for us,\n\n516\n00:26:15.312 --> 00:26:16.851\ngetting your [INAUDIBLE]\n>> I love show and tell.\n\n517\n00:26:16.851 --> 00:26:19.970\n>> That's right, getting the cool\nserver out and cracking the case open.\n\n518\n00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:22.070\nBut for this show,\nwe're gonna go ahead and call it a day.\n\n519\n00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:25.150\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n520\n00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:25.880\n>> And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n521\n00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.430\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n522\n00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:32.960\n[SOUND]\n\n",

another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.435 --> 00:00:20.263\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, joining me\non the show today is my good friend and\n\n5\n00:00:20.263 --> 00:00:21.897\ncolleague, Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:21.897 --> 00:00:22.910\nHow's it going today Mike?\n\n7\n00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.060\n>> Oh, it's going great Daniel.\n\n8\n00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.580\nI'm as always excited to be here because\nwe've got our MTA content coming your way.\n\n9\n00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.271\nThis is what we're looking at,\nserver fundamentals.\n\n10\n00:00:31.271 --> 00:00:35.785\nAnd in this particular episode we're gonna\nbe looking at performance monitoring.\n\n11\n00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:38.625\nA very important part of\nour job as an IT person is\n\n12\n00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:43.169\ngonna be to make sure those servers\nare giving us the performance that we need\n\n13\n00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:47.710\nto make sure everybody else can do\ntheir job, make our company money.\n\n14\n00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.800\nAll that good stuff, right?\n\n15\n00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.241\nDoesn't do any good to set\nall these servers up and\n\n16\n00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:54.978\nthen if people have to wait to log on,\nif they have to wait for DNS responses.\n\n17\n00:00:54.978 --> 00:00:58.300\nSo our job is to make sure that those\nservers are performing adequately,\n\n18\n00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.940\ngiving us the performance we need.\n\n19\n00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.876\nAnd if not, finding out about it and\ndoing something about it, right?\n\n20\n00:01:03.876 --> 00:01:04.981\n>> Yeah, that's exactly right.\n\n21\n00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:08.795\nSo we're going to spend half of our time\nfielding on wondering is this server\n\n22\n00:01:08.795 --> 00:01:09.880\nrunning optimally?\n\n23\n00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.780\nIs it handling the load necessary?\n\n24\n00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.566\nDo I need to upgrade?\n\n25\n00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:13.550\nDo I need to add more RAM?\n\n26\n00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.210\nDo I need to add a new CPU to this thing?\n\n27\n00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.872\nWho knows.\n\n28\n00:01:16.872 --> 00:01:20.630\nWell we're going to use some tools today\nto take a look into that to find out if\n\n29\n00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.822\nour servers are actually even doing\nwhat it is we need them to do.\n\n30\n00:01:23.822 --> 00:01:26.573\nAre they performing in a way\nthat is working for us?\n\n31\n00:01:26.573 --> 00:01:30.996\nMike's gonna show us some neat ways\nto figure that kind of thing out, but\n\n32\n00:01:30.996 --> 00:01:35.130\nfirst we need to figure out what\nactually causes computers to work,\n\n33\n00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.358\nto have to trudge along and maybe even\nget slow on us from time to time.\n\n34\n00:01:39.358 --> 00:01:40.685\n>> So we're gonna plug them into the wall,\n\n35\n00:01:40.685 --> 00:01:43.092\nwe're gonna give them a little\nelectricity, and they should work now.\n\n36\n00:01:43.092 --> 00:01:43.711\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n37\n00:01:43.711 --> 00:01:45.640\n>> Yeah, Daniel's absolutely right.\n\n38\n00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.260\nWhen we set up our network, our networks\nsorta are dynamic, things change, right?\n\n39\n00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.310\nWe hire more people, we add new services.\n\n40\n00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.090\nSo while those servers might have been\nable to handle the workload we had\n\n41\n00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.920\nthem under initially.\n\n42\n00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.790\nIf we don't stay on top of it,\nand monitor these changes, and\n\n43\n00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.370\nsee how these changes\nare effecting our servers then, we\n\n44\n00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.860\ncould end up in a situation where all of\na sudden performance just hit the floor.\n\n45\n00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.520\nWe wanna try to figure that out well\nbefore we get to that point, right?\n\n46\n00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.210\nWe wanna see that downward\nslope in performance and\n\n47\n00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.690\ndo something about it before it gets\ntoo bad, to where people on the network\n\n48\n00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.440\nare noticing or applications are noticing,\nthings like that.\n\n49\n00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.452\nSo as Daniel said, the first thing we want\nto talk about is just the effects and\n\n50\n00:02:26.452 --> 00:02:27.517\nwhat you might see.\n\n51\n00:02:27.517 --> 00:02:30.850\nAnd most of this, you've probably\nseen it on your own machines.\n\n52\n00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.349\nIt's gonna be no different when we\nlook at a sever operating system.\n\n53\n00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.270\nYou've got the four main subsystems\nthat we typically monitor.\n\n54\n00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.300\nThat's gonna be CPU,\nmemory, disk and network.\n\n55\n00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.835\nSo those are the four main subsystems.\n\n56\n00:02:44.835 --> 00:02:47.945\nAnd of course, there's lots of other\nthings that we can monitor, but\n\n57\n00:02:47.945 --> 00:02:49.009\nthose are the biggies.\n\n58\n00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:53.832\nCPU, my Central Processing Unit,\nthe brains of my machine,\n\n59\n00:02:53.832 --> 00:02:58.395\nif that guy is busy then everything\nseems to come to a halt.\n\n60\n00:02:58.395 --> 00:03:02.223\nIf you've ever been on your machine and\nit's just not responding and\n\n61\n00:03:02.223 --> 00:03:04.672\nyou click on things, nothings happening.\n\n62\n00:03:04.672 --> 00:03:09.094\nIf you can even get task manager to open\nup, which is a tool we're gonna look at,\n\n63\n00:03:09.094 --> 00:03:12.394\nyou'll see that that CPU\nutilization is through the roof.\n\n64\n00:03:12.394 --> 00:03:16.922\nIt's at 99 or 100%, and\nif the CPU is at 100% utilization or\n\n65\n00:03:16.922 --> 00:03:21.708\n99% utilization, your computer\nreally can't do anything, right?\n\n66\n00:03:21.708 --> 00:03:25.619\nEverything has to talk to the,\njust about everything, I should say,\n\n67\n00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:27.260\nhas to talk to that CPU.\n\n68\n00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.467\nAnd they're all waiting in\nline to talk to that CPU.\n\n69\n00:03:29.467 --> 00:03:33.233\nAnd if he's too busy, the line just\nkeeps getting longer and longer, and\n\n70\n00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:34.580\nnothing is getting done.\n\n71\n00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.220\nAnd that's when you see that,\nalmost that total system lock up.\n\n72\n00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.537\n>> Yeah, I quit it too.\n\n73\n00:03:39.537 --> 00:03:42.797\nAnd if I were to try and\nhave you do advanced calculus,\n\n74\n00:03:42.797 --> 00:03:47.087\nand read the collected works of\nWilliam Shakespeare at the same time.\n\n75\n00:03:47.087 --> 00:03:50.090\nIf I asked you something simple like,\nwhat is your address?\n\n76\n00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.020\nYou would struggle to work that because\nyou've got so many things going on.\n\n77\n00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.620\nWell a CPU, like Mike said,\nis the brain of our computer.\n\n78\n00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.610\nIt's what does the thinking and\nthe calculations.\n\n79\n00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.110\nIf its too busy,\nwell even simple tasks like\n\n80\n00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.040\nclicking the start button is\ngoing to be a challenge for it.\n\n81\n00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.241\nAnd that's when you start seeing\nslow downs on the server.\n\n82\n00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:11.521\nYou've got to remember, servers at their\nbasics are just a computer like you have\n\n83\n00:04:11.521 --> 00:04:14.150\nyour laptop or\nyour desktop sitting at home.\n\n84\n00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.787\nThe only real difference is that they're\nusually a little better, they're beefier.\n\n85\n00:04:17.787 --> 00:04:20.305\nBecause they need to be because\nthey handle a larger load.\n\n86\n00:04:20.305 --> 00:04:24.694\nThat doesn't mean we can't overwhelm them\nand from time to time that does happen.\n\n87\n00:04:24.694 --> 00:04:28.055\n[LAUGH] I've definitely seen some\nservers crawl into a hole before.\n\n88\n00:04:28.055 --> 00:04:29.924\n>> Mm-hm, absolutely.\n\n89\n00:04:29.924 --> 00:04:32.290\nAll right, so\nCPU is a big one we gotta watch.\n\n90\n00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.710\nThe next one we wanna\ntalk about is memory.\n\n91\n00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.978\nMemory is a little bit trickier,\ntypically, to recognize the signs or\n\n92\n00:04:38.978 --> 00:04:43.686\nto figure out that it is actually memory\nthat's causing the system slowdown.\n\n93\n00:04:43.686 --> 00:04:46.839\nAnd we have a certain amount of RAM\ninstalled in these machines and\n\n94\n00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:47.535\nour servers.\n\n95\n00:04:47.535 --> 00:04:50.292\nAnd of course as we add more and\nmore services,\n\n96\n00:04:50.292 --> 00:04:53.983\nsome of those services can be\nvery memory dependent, right?\n\n97\n00:04:53.983 --> 00:04:55.584\nIt has to load everything up into memory,\n\n98\n00:04:55.584 --> 00:04:58.050\nyou guys remember your\nbasics of computers, right?\n\n99\n00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.849\nEverything that's on the hard drive,\nwe can't work with data that's on the hard\n\n100\n00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:04.837\ndrive, it has to be loaded up into RAM so\nthat we can work with it.\n\n101\n00:05:04.837 --> 00:05:08.603\nSome applications are more memory\nintensive than others, like DNS for\n\n102\n00:05:08.603 --> 00:05:09.173\nexample.\n\n103\n00:05:09.173 --> 00:05:12.468\nHas to load up all those\nzones up into memory so\n\n104\n00:05:12.468 --> 00:05:15.085\nthat it can respond to DNS queries.\n\n105\n00:05:15.085 --> 00:05:17.481\nAnd what happens when we\nstart running out of memory,\n\n106\n00:05:17.481 --> 00:05:19.360\nwell the computer doesn't lock up.\n\n107\n00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.390\nIt's not like the CPU where\neverything just freezes up.\n\n108\n00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.280\nWhen we run low on memory,\nmy system has a way of dealing with that,\n\n109\n00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.098\nwe call it paging, all right?\n\n110\n00:05:28.098 --> 00:05:32.170\nOr that temp file or swap file if\nyou come from the Linux world.\n\n111\n00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.770\nAnd what's happening is, since I don't\nhave any free memory, if I want to load\n\n112\n00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.700\nsomething else up, and the computer says,\nhey, I need to work with this.\n\n113\n00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.786\nI need to throw it in memory,\nthere's no room in memory.\n\n114\n00:05:42.786 --> 00:05:44.578\nWell I'm gonna look through memory,\n\n115\n00:05:44.578 --> 00:05:48.340\nfind something that you're not currently\nusing and write it to that page file.\n\n116\n00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.270\nWe're gonna free up some space by\ntemporarily taking that out of memory,\n\n117\n00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.530\nputting it in your page file.\n\n118\n00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.320\nNow I can open that other,\nwhatever it was, and\n\n119\n00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.070\nload it up into memory and work with it.\n\n120\n00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.679\nAnd then if I need, if I go back to\nthe application that it had removed from\n\n121\n00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:04.715\nmemory, whatever data that was\nthat wrote to the page file.\n\n122\n00:06:04.715 --> 00:06:08.669\nIf I need to access that, well now what\nit's gotta do is find something else I'm\n\n123\n00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:12.446\nnot using, put it in the page file, and\nput that information back into RAM so\n\n124\n00:06:12.446 --> 00:06:13.407\nI can work with it.\n\n125\n00:06:13.407 --> 00:06:15.500\nCalled swapping or paging.\n\n126\n00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.485\nAnd so what happens when we run low on\nmemory, we get excessive paging, and\n\n127\n00:06:20.485 --> 00:06:22.480\nthat just slows things down.\n\n128\n00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.980\nNow some times that can be a tricky one.\n\n129\n00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.330\nYou really gotta use your\nmonitoring techniques to figure out\n\n130\n00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.410\nif it is memory causing that problem.\n\n131\n00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.168\nBecause a lot of times we think it\nmay be hard drives for example.\n\n132\n00:06:34.168 --> 00:06:36.672\nThis is one of those ones where\nit is doing excessive paging and\n\n133\n00:06:36.672 --> 00:06:39.515\nif you're ding your monitoring and\nyou are looking at your counters,\n\n134\n00:06:39.515 --> 00:06:41.800\nwhich we are going to talk\nabout in a little bit.\n\n135\n00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.600\nYou might see a lot of\nhard drive activity.\n\n136\n00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.910\nAnd a very big queue for\nwriting to that hard drive.\n\n137\n00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.390\nBut it's not really the hard drive\nthat's causing the problem, right?\n\n138\n00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.266\nIt's because we're low on memory,\n\n139\n00:06:53.266 --> 00:06:56.410\nit's generating a lot of extra\nwork on that hard drive.\n\n140\n00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:58.646\nBut it's actually memory\nthat's the problem, right?\n\n141\n00:06:58.646 --> 00:07:00.868\nSo that can be a tricky\none sometimes to diagnose.\n\n142\n00:07:00.868 --> 00:07:04.416\nI'm gonna show you some ways that we can\nuse these tools built into Windows to\n\n143\n00:07:04.416 --> 00:07:05.258\nfigure that out.\n\n144\n00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:08.820\nWhat else, network or, let's go disk.\n\n145\n00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:09.906\nDisk is another one.\n\n146\n00:07:09.906 --> 00:07:14.340\nAnd disk is where we write information to,\nread information from.\n\n147\n00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.140\nAnd if you've got a single disk in there,\nyou've got one read write head.\n\n148\n00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.267\nThat means everything that wants\nto access data on that drive or\n\n149\n00:07:21.267 --> 00:07:23.925\nwrite data to that drive,\nhas to go through that one.\n\n150\n00:07:23.925 --> 00:07:27.610\nYou've got a single what they call I/O,\nor input output, right?\n\n151\n00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:31.064\nAnd if there's a lot of things that\nneed to read or write from the drive,\n\n152\n00:07:31.064 --> 00:07:32.570\nthey're all waiting in line.\n\n153\n00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:34.860\nAgain, you've got a queue sitting there.\n\n154\n00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.230\nSo you might find that because\nyou've only got a single spindle, or\n\n155\n00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:42.520\na single hard drive in there, things start\nto slow down when you open new stuff up,\n\n156\n00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.560\nwhen you try to launch things,\nwhen you try to access files on the drive.\n\n157\n00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.090\nIt just seems to take forever.\n\n158\n00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:51.500\nWe open up Windows Explorer,\nFile Explorer and it really slows down.\n\n159\n00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.775\nThat could be a drive issue.\n\n160\n00:07:52.775 --> 00:07:54.884\n>> Yeah and\nthen you can run into things like,\n\n161\n00:07:54.884 --> 00:07:59.001\nwell I have this server is was running\nfine, I installed this software yesterday.\n\n162\n00:07:59.001 --> 00:08:01.435\nWell that software might have had\nsomething like a database on it.\n\n163\n00:08:01.435 --> 00:08:05.320\nDatabases are notorious for needing a lot\nof reads and writes from the disk And\n\n164\n00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.668\nthat might be where your\nslowdown comes from.\n\n165\n00:08:07.668 --> 00:08:12.418\nSo you gotta remember that that disk only\nhas [LAUGH] just like everything on our\n\n166\n00:08:12.418 --> 00:08:16.750\nsystems, they only have so\nmuch resources that will allow us to work.\n\n167\n00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:21.810\nAnd if we're overwhelming that service,\nit's gonna cause performance issues.\n\n168\n00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:23.810\nNow, Mike, you also mentioned networking.\n\n169\n00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:25.740\nThat's probably the biggest one.\n\n170\n00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:29.580\nWhen the network is slow,\nthe phone starts ringing.\n\n171\n00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:31.080\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n172\n00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.740\nIt might not be the biggest to us,\nbut it definitely is the biggest\n\n173\n00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.510\nto my end users cuz that's\nhow they access the servers.\n\n174\n00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:40.620\nWhatever service that server's providing,\nwhether it's an authentication server,\n\n175\n00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.800\na DNS server,\na DHCP server passing out IP addresses.\n\n176\n00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.720\nIf I can't reach out and\n\n177\n00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:49.570\ntalk to that server over the network,\nthen it can't serve me, right?\n\n178\n00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.730\nI'm waiting for an IP address,\nand it's trying,\n\n179\n00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:54.495\nbut its network adapter is saturated.\n\n180\n00:08:54.495 --> 00:08:55.920\nOr I'm trying to log in, but\n\n181\n00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.740\nthe domain controller, I can't talk to\nit because the network is saturated or\n\n182\n00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:03.300\nthe network adapter on that\ndomain controller is too busy.\n\n183\n00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:07.150\nAgain, same kind of thing, depending\non how you've got that system set up.\n\n184\n00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:10.220\nIf it's a single network adapter,\nthat thing can get overloaded.\n\n185\n00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:14.693\nIt can be trying to send and\nreceive a lot of data, and when it can't,\n\n186\n00:09:14.693 --> 00:09:16.483\nwe're gonna notice that.\n\n187\n00:09:16.483 --> 00:09:20.539\nAnd usually the end result\nof a network issue is\n\n188\n00:09:20.539 --> 00:09:24.600\njust the inability to\nconnect to the servers.\n\n189\n00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.620\nWe have people calling us up saying hey,\n\n190\n00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:30.410\nit takes forever to connect\nto this internal webpage.\n\n191\n00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:32.620\nAnd that could be cuz it's\ntaking a long time for\n\n192\n00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:36.820\nthat DNS server to respond because\nit's having networking issues.\n\n193\n00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:39.710\nOr it takes us forever to authenticate,\nand that, again,\n\n194\n00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:44.980\ncould be because that domain controller,\nit's network is saturated and\n\n195\n00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:48.830\nit can't process group policy and\nsend it out to that machine.\n\n196\n00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:53.091\nSo usually when we see networking issues\nit's our end users reporting back that\n\n197\n00:09:53.091 --> 00:09:55.127\nthey're having trouble accessing or\n\n198\n00:09:55.127 --> 00:09:58.445\nusing the services that these\nservers are trying to provide.\n\n199\n00:09:58.445 --> 00:10:03.369\nSo, again, those are the big four and\njust some typical signs that you might see\n\n200\n00:10:03.369 --> 00:10:06.899\nif any one of those four\nsubsystems is being overloaded or\n\n201\n00:10:06.899 --> 00:10:09.047\nis a little too heavily utilized.\n\n202\n00:10:09.047 --> 00:10:11.330\nAnd it can vary, right,\nthose aren't set in stone.\n\n203\n00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:15.950\nYou might see other symptoms that end up\nbeing a memory issue or a disk issue.\n\n204\n00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:19.994\nBut a good starting point to have some\nbasics of what you might see out there.\n\n205\n00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:23.485\n>> Yep, so Mike, now that we know\nwhat can cause these issues,\n\n206\n00:10:23.485 --> 00:10:25.490\nhow we might experience that.\n\n207\n00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:28.910\nWe know, okay, I'm probably having an\nissue with one of these big four, right?\n\n208\n00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:30.400\nSomething is slowing down.\n\n209\n00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.060\nHow do I tell what's what?\n\n210\n00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:36.230\nHow do I know that it's a networking\nissue versus an I/O issue for disk,\n\n211\n00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:39.575\nor that I need to add more memory, or\nmy CPU is being utilized too much?\n\n212\n00:10:39.575 --> 00:10:43.185\n>> There's a bunch of tools that Windows\ngives us that we can use to figure that\n\n213\n00:10:43.185 --> 00:10:44.114\nkind of thing out.\n\n214\n00:10:44.114 --> 00:10:45.975\nAnd that's really what our job is, right?\n\n215\n00:10:45.975 --> 00:10:48.545\nTo find what we call the bottleneck.\n\n216\n00:10:48.545 --> 00:10:52.070\nWhen we look at a system overall,\nit's got many different components\n\n217\n00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:55.140\nthat are working together\nto provide these services.\n\n218\n00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.530\nOne component is gonna\nbe slower than the rest.\n\n219\n00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:02.990\nIt's typically not everything is all\nbeing saturated or anything like that.\n\n220\n00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:05.890\nIt's one component is\nslowing everything else down.\n\n221\n00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:08.180\nIt's that weakest link\nthat we're looking for.\n\n222\n00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.420\nAnd it's not that you can get rid of it.\n\n223\n00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:14.130\nI mean you're almost always going to have\none component slower than everything else.\n\n224\n00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:18.510\nFor example, let's say I've got a database\nserver like Daniel was talking about.\n\n225\n00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:22.180\nIt's very heavy on that disk I/O and\nso I decide, you know what?\n\n226\n00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.720\nWe're going to go in and\nwe're going to throw a RAID in there.\n\n227\n00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:27.346\nI'm gonna go get five drives,\nand I'm gonna put a RAID-5,\n\n228\n00:11:27.346 --> 00:11:32.940\na RAID-10 array in there, and spread that\nI/O process out across all those disks.\n\n229\n00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:36.538\nGreat, now my disk performance is much,\nmuch better.\n\n230\n00:11:36.538 --> 00:11:42.456\nBut now my CPU's having trouble keeping\nup with this really fast disk subsystem,\n\n231\n00:11:42.456 --> 00:11:45.920\nso it now becomes the weakest link, right?\n\n232\n00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.180\nSo you're always gonna have one thing\nthat's holding the server back.\n\n233\n00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:52.173\nWe're just trying to find\nthat weakest link, and\n\n234\n00:11:52.173 --> 00:11:56.451\nthen determine if it's worth trying\nto invest, if we're gonna get our\n\n235\n00:11:56.451 --> 00:12:00.604\nreturn by improving the performance\non that particular subsystem.\n\n236\n00:12:00.604 --> 00:12:02.380\nAll right, so how do we do it,\nhow do we figure this out?\n\n237\n00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.690\nWell, a couple other terms we need to\nbe familiar with when we talk about\n\n238\n00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:10.950\nperformance monitoring, and that's real\ntime versus historical monitoring.\n\n239\n00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:15.072\nFirst couple tools I'm gonna look at\ndo what we call real time monitoring.\n\n240\n00:12:15.072 --> 00:12:21.640\nWhat that means is, what I see is what's\ngoing on on the server right now, current.\n\n241\n00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.330\nHence the name, real time.\n\n242\n00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.260\nYou're seeing what's actually\noccurring on the machine.\n\n243\n00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.780\nThe first tool I'm gonna look\nat is called Task Manager.\n\n244\n00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:33.393\nAnd yeah, there's several ways you can\nlaunch Task Manager, use your favorite.\n\n245\n00:12:33.393 --> 00:12:35.154\nNow what is it, Ctrl+Shift+Escape,\n\n246\n00:12:35.154 --> 00:12:39.270\nI right-click on the task bar,\nyou can go into your Administrative Tools,\n\n247\n00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:44.120\nyou can go to your Log On screen,\nhowever you want to launch Task Manager.\n\n248\n00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:48.950\nAnd this is a tool we've seen and it's in\nour client end server operating systems.\n\n249\n00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:53.180\nAnd it's got several tabs we can\nuse to look at our performance.\n\n250\n00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:57.060\nThat first tab is just showing me\nwhat applications are running.\n\n251\n00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:00.850\nAnd then I've got the processes\nthat are running on the system.\n\n252\n00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:03.427\nI've got the services that\nare running on the system.\n\n253\n00:13:03.427 --> 00:13:06.640\nAnd then I can get over here to, and\nI'll go ahead and skip to these others,\n\n254\n00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.272\nI've got Network, Users.\n\n255\n00:13:08.272 --> 00:13:11.920\nI'm gonna go back to Performance cuz this\nis the one I really wanna look at here.\n\n256\n00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.390\nThis is Performance Monitor, right?\n\n257\n00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:17.375\nThe tab says Performance,\nit kinda gives it away.\n\n258\n00:13:17.375 --> 00:13:22.190\nAnd I've got a few,\nthere's a little bit of information here.\n\n259\n00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:24.190\nI've got my CPU utilization.\n\n260\n00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:28.335\nI've got a handy-dandy little chart,\na little moving bar chart here.\n\n261\n00:13:28.335 --> 00:13:33.090\nAnd then a little bit of\na scrolling line chart\n\n262\n00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:37.970\nover here showing my current usage and\nmy usage history.\n\n263\n00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:39.694\nNow wait Mike, you just said real time.\n\n264\n00:13:39.694 --> 00:13:42.090\nWhat do you mean, usage history?\n\n265\n00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:45.068\nWell, it shows you about\nthe last minute or two.\n\n266\n00:13:45.068 --> 00:13:48.708\nAs soon as this information scrolls\noff to the side, to the left here,\n\n267\n00:13:48.708 --> 00:13:51.380\nthat information is gone,\nI can't get it back.\n\n268\n00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.690\nAnd that's what I mean\nby real time monitoring.\n\n269\n00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:57.580\nI'm seeing what's going on but\nit's not saving any of this information.\n\n270\n00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:02.220\nBelow that I've got my memory utilization,\nmy physical memory usage history.\n\n271\n00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:05.490\nAgain, it shows me the last\nfew minutes of usage.\n\n272\n00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:09.320\nBelow that some more information about\nmemory, how much I have available,\n\n273\n00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:13.750\nhow much is currently being used for\ncache, total available, total free.\n\n274\n00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:18.340\nAnd then my kernel memory as well\nas the total number of threads and\n\n275\n00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:18.940\nthings like that.\n\n276\n00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:25.110\nSo, very basic information that I can look\nat to see how my server's performing.\n\n277\n00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:29.070\nWhat I want you to remember about Task\nManager is that it's real time monitoring.\n\n278\n00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:31.440\nSo if on the exam,\nthey ask you something about,\n\n279\n00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.232\nyou want to do some real time monitoring,\nwhat tool might you use?\n\n280\n00:14:34.232 --> 00:14:36.510\nTask Manager'd be one of them.\n\n281\n00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:39.143\nAnd, Daniel, I'm sure you've used\nthis as well as our viewers.\n\n282\n00:14:39.143 --> 00:14:40.915\nProbably used this several times,\n\n283\n00:14:40.915 --> 00:14:43.545\nif anything,\nto end an unresponsive task, right.\n\n284\n00:14:43.545 --> 00:14:46.970\nBut if you've ever explored over to\nthe Performance tab, where I can see,\n\n285\n00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:48.940\nit's one of the first places I look.\n\n286\n00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:50.030\n>> When someone calls my phone and\n\n287\n00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:53.640\nsays, I have a slow computer,\nI'm opening Task Manager.\n\n288\n00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.490\nI'm checking that Performance tab to see,\n\n289\n00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:57.844\nare they actually [LAUGH]\nexperiencing a slow computer?\n\n290\n00:14:57.844 --> 00:15:01.472\nCuz a lot of time I've got a user, his\nname's Ronnie Wong, he's very impatient.\n\n291\n00:15:01.472 --> 00:15:02.579\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] You do,\n\n292\n00:15:02.579 --> 00:15:04.550\nyou get people that\nare a little impatient.\n\n293\n00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:08.090\nSo they might think that it's\nbeing slow when it's really acting\n\n294\n00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.720\nwithin the realm of\nacceptable time limits.\n\n295\n00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.510\nBut other than that,\n\n296\n00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:14.960\nif you look at that performance and\nyou see that CPU jacked through 100% and\n\n297\n00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.970\nit just stays there, then you know,\nokay, yeah, you're having some issues.\n\n298\n00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:21.780\nAnd the good thing is,\nright there within the same tool,\n\n299\n00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:24.820\nis you have the ability to kill\ntasks that are being unresponsive.\n\n300\n00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.600\nMaybe you have some processes that\nare running that don't need to be at\n\n301\n00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.340\nthat point in time.\n\n302\n00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:31.820\nYou could try to free up some\nresources using that utility.\n\n303\n00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.140\nIt's a very, very nice thing.\n\n304\n00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:38.210\nHelp desks love this thing because it does\ngive them the ability to start trying to\n\n305\n00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.650\nnarrow down what is causing the issue.\n\n306\n00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:43.430\nIf I can see,\nbased off of some of the performance,\n\n307\n00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:48.010\nthe metrics that they're giving us back,\nthat this program right here\n\n308\n00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:52.440\nis using a ton of memory or\nthis one is really utilizing the CPU,\n\n309\n00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:56.810\nlet me kill that process real quick and\nsee if that doesn't solve my issue.\n\n310\n00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:58.490\nThen I do that and the issue gets solved.\n\n311\n00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:00.940\nI see the CPU drop down as I\nwatch the performance monitor.\n\n312\n00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:04.167\nI say, okay, well at least I\nknow where the problem lies.\n\n313\n00:16:04.167 --> 00:16:06.501\nIt's with that specific program.\n\n314\n00:16:06.501 --> 00:16:10.320\nAnd if that program's something I can't\nlive without, I have to have that,\n\n315\n00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:14.375\nWell that's gonna mean me having to shell\nout some money to upgrade the hardware so\n\n316\n00:16:14.375 --> 00:16:18.730\nthat it can handle whatever performance\nhit that that program's gonna cause.\n\n317\n00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:21.370\nIf it's something that's\njust arbitrary though,\n\n318\n00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:24.590\nmaybe users installed it,\nI can just put the nix on that guy.\n\n319\n00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:28.685\nAnd say, here's your culprit right here,\nI know you like WeatherBug.\n\n320\n00:16:28.685 --> 00:16:31.830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it's causing you some issues, so\n\n321\n00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:34.940\nlet's go ahead and uninstall that so\nit will free up the resources and\n\n322\n00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:36.970\nyou can get back to a normal state.\n\n323\n00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:40.330\nSo that's the great reason, I mean Task\nManager seems like a very simple tool but\n\n324\n00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:42.140\nit is fantastic for troubleshooting.\n\n325\n00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:43.340\n>> They are very, very handy.\n\n326\n00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:47.600\nLike I said, most of you at home have\nprobably used it once or twice before.\n\n327\n00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.290\nOther things I'll show\nyou on Task Manager,\n\n328\n00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:52.540\nI've launched up a couple tasks\njust to have something to look at.\n\n329\n00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.170\nWe talked about the performance.\n\n330\n00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:57.520\nThere is a networking tab as well so\nif you're having, if you think or\n\n331\n00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.610\nsuspect that the problem lies\nwith your network adapter or\n\n332\n00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:03.920\njust bandwidth in general,\nhere's where you can look for that.\n\n333\n00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.480\nAnd as Daniel was saying,\nand I can kill things.\n\n334\n00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.380\nAnd if we come over here\nto the processes tab, and\n\n335\n00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:15.390\nlet me just make this guy a wee bit wider\nfor us, and we'll expand some of this out.\n\n336\n00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:16.970\nI can see some basic information.\n\n337\n00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:21.320\nThere's my CPU utilization, and\nthere's my memory utilization, and\n\n338\n00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:25.320\nyou can sort this by clicking on these\ncolumn headers I can sort it by memory, or\n\n339\n00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.900\nI can sort it by CPU.\n\n340\n00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:32.810\nSo if I come over here, and\nI see that my CPU usage is at 99%, well,\n\n341\n00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:36.950\nthe next thing I'm gonna do is take a look\nat my processes, and I'm gonna sort this\n\n342\n00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:42.430\nby CPU utilization, and I'm gonna look and\nsee what process is it that's taking so\n\n343\n00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:45.660\nmuch of my processor, and as Daniel said,\nmaybe I wanna kill it, right?\n\n344\n00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:49.347\nAnd there's,\nwonder if I can grab PowerShell there,\n\n345\n00:17:49.347 --> 00:17:51.759\nand I can end that process, right?\n\n346\n00:17:51.759 --> 00:17:55.230\nAnd now it's gone, and now I can look and\nsee, okay, did that help things?\n\n347\n00:17:55.230 --> 00:18:00.470\nDid my CPU utilization drop back down\ninto my normal parameters and if so,\n\n348\n00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:05.020\nnow I know that that's most likely the\nculprit, although it can be a combination\n\n349\n00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:08.590\nof apps that sometimes you might have\nto do a little more research there.\n\n350\n00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:12.340\nA little thing I'll\npoint out where you guys\n\n351\n00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:14.240\nmost likely again have seen it before.\n\n352\n00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.170\nAnd sometimes if you try to\nend the task from this screen,\n\n353\n00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:19.350\nthe task if the application is true.\n\n354\n00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:20.720\nTruly unresponsive.\n\n355\n00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.070\nSometimes sending it in\nto End Task from here,\n\n356\n00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:25.670\ndoesn't kill the application,\nbecause it's not responding.\n\n357\n00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:27.091\nYou can tell it to stop.\n\n358\n00:18:27.091 --> 00:18:28.886\n[LAUGH] But it's not responding.\n\n359\n00:18:28.886 --> 00:18:33.960\nSo what you can do is, you can right-click\non these guys and chose go to process.\n\n360\n00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.668\nAnd usually,\nif you kill the process itself,\n\n361\n00:18:36.668 --> 00:18:40.426\nthat'll kill an application\nwhether it's responding or not.\n\n362\n00:18:40.426 --> 00:18:43.911\nSo when you do the application tab,\nyou're really sending a message to\n\n363\n00:18:43.911 --> 00:18:46.884\nthe application itself,\nhey would you mind shutting down?\n\n364\n00:18:46.884 --> 00:18:50.264\nAnd if the application is not responsive,\nsometimes it doesn't work, if you kill\n\n365\n00:18:50.264 --> 00:18:54.310\nthe process, you're telling Windows, I\ndon't care what the application is doing.\n\n366\n00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:56.850\nKill that thread,\ntell it to stop doing it.\n\n367\n00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:58.710\nAnd then the application\nalmost has to close,\n\n368\n00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:03.020\nbecause you killed, you kind of chopped\nout its legs from underneath it.\n\n369\n00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:04.870\nAll right, so that is Task Manager.\n\n370\n00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:08.730\nAnd let me go ahead and\nkill file explorer there as well.\n\n371\n00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:10.150\nTask Manager is a great little tool.\n\n372\n00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:14.466\nAgain, real time monitoring\nthat we're looking at here.\n\n373\n00:19:14.466 --> 00:19:15.841\nBeen around forever.\n\n374\n00:19:15.841 --> 00:19:18.230\nThere's another tool, though,\nthat I want to show you.\n\n375\n00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:21.910\nThe next one is going\nto be resource monitor.\n\n376\n00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:26.280\nAnd you'll notice I've got a button right\nhere in Task Manager that'll allow me to\n\n377\n00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.930\nget to Resource Monitor.\n\n378\n00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:32.760\nI can also go to my Start Menu and\nI could find Resource Monitor.\n\n379\n00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.290\nIt really doesn't matter\nwhich way you launch it up.\n\n380\n00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:36.270\nResource monitor.\n\n381\n00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:39.780\nI like to talk about this like\nTask Manager on steroids.\n\n382\n00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:44.310\nIt really is just the next\nstep from Task Manager.\n\n383\n00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:46.190\nAgain, real-time monitoring.\n\n384\n00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:50.370\nIt's showing me what's going on in\nthe system currently, right now.\n\n385\n00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:54.150\nI've got an overview tab,\nthat has my four main sub-systems.\n\n386\n00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:59.450\nYou can see CPU, disk,\nnetwork, and memory.\n\n387\n00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:02.170\nAnd then I've got a handy-dandy\nlittle chart over here.\n\n388\n00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:06.978\nThat's giving me that graphical\nrepresentation of that same information.\n\n389\n00:20:06.978 --> 00:20:09.650\nVery handy.\n\n390\n00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:13.150\nThen I've got a breakdown for\neach subsystem.\n\n391\n00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:14.470\nAnd if we go to CPU,\n\n392\n00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:18.300\nI can see my processes,\njust like I saw in Task Manager.\n\n393\n00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.610\nBut then I can expand out services.\n\n394\n00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:22.539\nI can look at associated handles.\n\n395\n00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:31.940\nNow we select something up here,\nsee if I can get something going.\n\n396\n00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:36.766\nNothing wants to show, don't really\nsee any handles going right now,\n\n397\n00:20:36.766 --> 00:20:39.592\nas well as associated modules down here.\n\n398\n00:20:39.592 --> 00:20:44.800\nSo very, very, very detailed information.\n\n399\n00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.502\nAnd evidently none of these,\n\n400\n00:20:46.502 --> 00:20:51.280\nthere we go, find one that's got some\nassociated handles with it, interesting.\n\n401\n00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:56.218\nAnd normally I can get these guys\nto populate with quite a bit, but\n\n402\n00:20:56.218 --> 00:20:58.550\nit's showing you extreme detail, right.\n\n403\n00:20:58.550 --> 00:20:59.330\nIf you come up here and\n\n404\n00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:02.610\nyou look at PerfMon,\nit's showing you the different services.\n\n405\n00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:05.960\nNormally, it'll show me some handles\nthat are associated with that.\n\n406\n00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.950\nSo basically,\neverything those applications are doing.\n\n407\n00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:12.430\nTypically, more detail\nthan you ever want really.\n\n408\n00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:16.260\nSome of this information is just beyond\nanything we're really gonna find\n\n409\n00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:17.340\nall that useful.\n\n410\n00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:18.660\nBut it breaks it down in each one.\n\n411\n00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:21.620\nMemory Disk and network.\n\n412\n00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:25.940\nYou see, like on disk I've got\ndisk activity, I've got storage.\n\n413\n00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:30.740\nOn network I can look at TCP connections\nthat are created, listening ports, right?\n\n414\n00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:34.250\nMuch like I'd see from the command\nprompt with say NetStat.\n\n415\n00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:36.842\nAll right here.\n\n416\n00:21:36.842 --> 00:21:41.301\nAnd another cool thing about this\nis you can filter things down.\n\n417\n00:21:41.301 --> 00:21:43.920\nFor example, you see these\nlittle check marks over here?\n\n418\n00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:49.070\nIf I choose PerfMon,\nsee how my graph has another orange line?\n\n419\n00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:53.750\nWhat that's now doing is the green\nis the overall system performance.\n\n420\n00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:58.280\nThe orange is showing me just\nPerfMon impact on performance.\n\n421\n00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:01.930\nSo it's giving me, I can now tell it hey,\nit looks like PerfMon,\n\n422\n00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:06.010\nin some places here,\nis using most of the performance.\n\n423\n00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:09.880\nNot using most of the performance,\nbut is responsible for\n\n424\n00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.750\nmost of those performance\nissues that it might be having,\n\n425\n00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:15.730\nand then as I go to these other tabs, you\ncan see these are now being filtered, so\n\n426\n00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:19.230\nit would show me just the services\nthat PerfMon was using.\n\n427\n00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:26.650\nJust the handles, and the modules that\nPerfMon is using, memory same thing, disk.\n\n428\n00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:27.560\nSee how it's being filtered?\n\n429\n00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:33.092\nSo now this is just disk\nactivity in relation to PerfMon.\n\n430\n00:22:33.092 --> 00:22:35.675\nMaybe you've looked at Task Manager and\nyou think, okay,\n\n431\n00:22:35.675 --> 00:22:38.425\nI think this is the application\nthat's giving me the trouble.\n\n432\n00:22:38.425 --> 00:22:43.356\nWell now I can fire up resource monitor, I\ncan come find it on this overview tab, and\n\n433\n00:22:43.356 --> 00:22:47.792\nI can select it, and I can then see if\nthat's truly the case, is that the one\n\n434\n00:22:47.792 --> 00:22:52.530\nthat's causing me the issues right,\njust getting more and more information.\n\n435\n00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:56.520\nReal time, the only thing you\ncan do in here is end processes.\n\n436\n00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.820\nJust like Task Manager,\nthat's why I like to say,\n\n437\n00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:00.592\nit really is Task Manager on steroids.\n\n438\n00:23:00.592 --> 00:23:05.545\n>> Yeah, I've used this guy, because if\nyou've looked inside of the Task Manager,\n\n439\n00:23:05.545 --> 00:23:09.520\nyou'll see sometimes you see that\nlittle SVC host, guy running.\n\n440\n00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:13.701\nWell that's usually a bunch of different\nprocesses rolled up into one service and\n\n441\n00:23:13.701 --> 00:23:17.290\nyou can kill it but you don't know\nwhich one might be causing an issue.\n\n442\n00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:18.695\nI've seen it spike CPU's,\n\n443\n00:23:18.695 --> 00:23:22.217\nI've seen it cause all sorts of\ndifferent memory utilization issues.\n\n444\n00:23:22.217 --> 00:23:26.628\nSo I can go into her into the PerfMon,\nor the resource monitor,\n\n445\n00:23:26.628 --> 00:23:32.040\nfind that guy, see exactly which services\nare being bundled into SVC host and\n\n446\n00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:35.301\nthen go oh,\nthere's my culprit right there.\n\n447\n00:23:35.301 --> 00:23:38.445\nSo now I can go in and\nfind the exact problem, and\n\n448\n00:23:38.445 --> 00:23:42.940\nnot just the fact that it was an SVC\nhost process causing my issue.\n\n449\n00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:47.883\nNow that is a little more detailed than\nyou really need to know for the exam,\n\n450\n00:23:47.883 --> 00:23:51.310\nbut you can see how powerful\nthis tool really is.\n\n451\n00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:52.850\nFor us to be able to fine tune, and\n\n452\n00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:56.240\nreally put it under a microscope and\nfind what our issue is.\n\n453\n00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.941\nIt's like the biochemist.\n\n454\n00:23:58.941 --> 00:24:01.426\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Of the tools that we have in Windows.\n\n455\n00:24:01.426 --> 00:24:02.877\n>> It is, it really is.\n\n456\n00:24:02.877 --> 00:24:06.411\nAll right, last little tool I want to\nlook at in this particular episode is my\n\n457\n00:24:06.411 --> 00:24:07.530\nperformance monitor.\n\n458\n00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:11.334\nSo I'm gonna close down resource monitor,\nand Task Manager.\n\n459\n00:24:11.334 --> 00:24:12.822\nAnd we'll flip over here and\n\n460\n00:24:12.822 --> 00:24:17.170\nwe're gonna talk about performance monitor\na little bit here but it's a big tool.\n\n461\n00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:20.800\nWe're gonna spend a little\nbit of time on this guy.\n\n462\n00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.130\nFirst thing we're gonna look at for\n\n463\n00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:25.750\nperformance monitor is\nit has a real time node.\n\n464\n00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:28.370\nSo, that probably is gonna give\nyou the indication that, hey,\n\n465\n00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:31.620\nit can do more than that but\nwe'll have to hold onto that one.\n\n466\n00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.210\nSo performance monitor,\nunderneath performance and\n\n467\n00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:37.150\nmonitoring tools I have\nmy performance monitor.\n\n468\n00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:39.434\nAgain this is real time monitoring.\n\n469\n00:24:39.434 --> 00:24:42.167\nOne counter is added by\ndefault on Server 2008.\n\n470\n00:24:42.167 --> 00:24:44.290\nIt is my percent processor time.\n\n471\n00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:45.980\nAnd I can see this little line.\n\n472\n00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.890\nThis is my processor utilization.\n\n473\n00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:51.110\nIf I try to open up\na couple things real quick,\n\n474\n00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:53.370\nyou'll see I can get that\nthing to spike a wee bit.\n\n475\n00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:57.842\nIt's amazing how opening the start\nmenu makes a little spike in your\n\n476\n00:24:57.842 --> 00:24:58.781\nperformance, right?\n\n477\n00:24:58.781 --> 00:24:59.950\n[LAUGH] These are VM.\n\n478\n00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:02.108\n>> Powerful tool.\n\n479\n00:25:02.108 --> 00:25:03.620\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n480\n00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:05.940\nBut again, real time monitoring.\n\n481\n00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:09.950\nNow with performance monitor,\nwe have to add what we call counters.\n\n482\n00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:14.820\nWhere other tools we're just picking,\nclicking on CPU, network, disk, or memory,\n\n483\n00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:18.690\nPerfmon or performance monitor, Perfmon\nis what we like to call it for short,\n\n484\n00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:24.300\nhas hundreds and hundreds of what\nwe call performance counters.\n\n485\n00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:28.350\nNow, these counters are just\nindividual bits of information\n\n486\n00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:32.010\nthat I can gather about\nperformance on that server.\n\n487\n00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:33.180\nThese are categories.\n\n488\n00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:37.125\nThese are not counters,\nlike here's one for processor, all right?\n\n489\n00:25:37.125 --> 00:25:39.535\nWell I can expand processor out and\n\n490\n00:25:39.535 --> 00:25:45.315\nI can see there are quite a few individual\ncounters underneath there, all right?\n\n491\n00:25:45.315 --> 00:25:50.040\nPercent processors time, for example is\nthe one that's currently being monitored.\n\n492\n00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.550\nBut maybe I want to add something else.\n\n493\n00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:52.620\nAnd we just add counters.\n\n494\n00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:53.480\nWhat do you want to see?\n\n495\n00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:57.840\nWell, let's say I want to look at,\nand it's alphabetical, Mike, so\n\n496\n00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.870\nmemory would be above processor.\n\n497\n00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:04.360\nSo let's scroll back up here and\nwe'll get to memory, and\n\n498\n00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:08.340\nmaybe I want to look at pages per second.\n\n499\n00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:09.840\nUsually a good one to monitor.\n\n500\n00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:12.910\n[COUGH] If I can find it, there we go.\n\n501\n00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:15.790\nPages per second, and\nwhen I add pages per second,\n\n502\n00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:18.300\nnotice there's no instances down here.\n\n503\n00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:21.530\nI'm just gonna click add and\nnow I've got pages per second.\n\n504\n00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:24.900\nI click okay, and\nnow I've got a second counter added.\n\n505\n00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:29.260\nNow, the resolution is not the best\non here, but pages per second and\n\n506\n00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:32.290\nprocessor are both red,\nisn't that fantastic?\n\n507\n00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:34.710\nLet's change that color just a wee bit.\n\n508\n00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.361\nI'm gonna change that to blue.\n\n509\n00:26:39.034 --> 00:26:41.058\nAll right, so now you can kinda see,\n\n510\n00:26:41.058 --> 00:26:44.400\nbut pages per second I don't\nhave a lot of activity going on.\n\n511\n00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.400\nThis virtual machine has a couple gigs of\nRAM, so it's not doing a lot of paging.\n\n512\n00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.670\nLet's add another counter.\n\n513\n00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:53.859\nI'm gonna click on my green plus\nsign to add that counter, and\n\n514\n00:26:53.859 --> 00:26:55.804\nlet's go to maybe network.\n\n515\n00:26:59.475 --> 00:27:00.820\nScroll a little bit slower.\n\n516\n00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:02.230\nThere we go.\n\n517\n00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:03.890\nNetwork interface.\n\n518\n00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:06.451\nAnd what I want to show you here is\nsometimes when you add counters,\n\n519\n00:27:06.451 --> 00:27:08.620\nI'm just going to do\nbytes total per second.\n\n520\n00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.100\nMemory, I didn't see this.\n\n521\n00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:14.880\nWith networking, though,\nI see different instances listed here.\n\n522\n00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:19.290\nThe way these work is you can have\nmore than one network adapter, right?\n\n523\n00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:22.600\nYou can't have more than one set of RAM,\nthat's why you don't see it.\n\n524\n00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:26.390\nBut maybe I want to monitor just\na particular network adapter.\n\n525\n00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:29.210\nI can come down here and\nI can choose that one adapter.\n\n526\n00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:33.570\nOr maybe I've got two network adapters,\nbut I want to total up the information and\n\n527\n00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:34.710\njust monitor it as one.\n\n528\n00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:40.020\nSo you can do all instances, or\nyou can do an individual network adapter.\n\n529\n00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:42.110\nAnd I'll go ahead and\nadd that individual one.\n\n530\n00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:46.010\nAnother one you might see that\non is gonna be a processor.\n\n531\n00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:48.540\nIf you have a multi-core processor,\n\n532\n00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:53.410\nwhen you go to do a percent processor tie,\nyou see I only have one core.\n\n533\n00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:54.920\nSo I can do a total.\n\n534\n00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:59.410\nA total would give me all the processor\ninformation added up, show me one number.\n\n535\n00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.720\nAll instances,\n\n536\n00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:06.620\nif I had four core processor, it would\nmonitor all four just like total, but\n\n537\n00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:10.580\ninstead of showing me one number it's\nshowing me four different numbers right?\n\n538\n00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:14.590\nEach individual core being monitored,\nnot added up.\n\n539\n00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:17.240\nOr maybe I want to monitor\na particular core and\n\n540\n00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:20.440\nI would see zero through three\nlisted here if I had four cores.\n\n541\n00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.400\nAnd I could pick just that core.\n\n542\n00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.540\nSame thing when you work\nwith physical disks, right?\n\n543\n00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:28.670\nYou might have a arrayed array where\nyou've got five disks in there.\n\n544\n00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:31.870\nYou might monitor the volume itself and\nget a total, or\n\n545\n00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:33.880\nyou might monitor individual drives.\n\n546\n00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:38.020\nMaybe you suspect one of those drives\nout of that array is having an issue.\n\n547\n00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:40.490\nSo pay attention to that when\nyou're adding these counters,\n\n548\n00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:45.060\nif it gives you a choice of instances,\nusually you'll have a total.\n\n549\n00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:48.590\nAll instances or individual instances.\n\n550\n00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:51.080\nThe other cool thing I'll show you\nabout the, and I'll go ahead and,\n\n551\n00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:54.070\nlet me scroll, let me find one.\n\n552\n00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:58.220\nThe other cool thing about this is, like I\nsaid, there are thousands of counters, and\n\n553\n00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:00.200\nyou're not expected to\nknow every one of them.\n\n554\n00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:03.060\nIt's one of those things you just\nhave to learn as you go, but\n\n555\n00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:04.790\nthey do give you a little bit of help.\n\n556\n00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:06.760\nLike if you look percent C1 time, Daniel,\n\n557\n00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:08.840\ndo you know offhand what\npercent C1 time is?\n\n558\n00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:12.982\n>> Oh, yeah, that's the thing that\ndoes the thing in that thing we like.\n\n559\n00:29:12.982 --> 00:29:13.944\n>> [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n560\n00:29:13.944 --> 00:29:15.572\n>> I have no idea wat that thing does.\n\n561\n00:29:15.572 --> 00:29:17.880\n>> Me neither, I don't know either.\n\n562\n00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.590\nBut guess what, PerfMon will tell me.\n\n563\n00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:23.560\nDown here at the bottom, there's\na little show description checkmark.\n\n564\n00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:27.539\nAnd I can see oh, oh, percent one\ntime is the percentage of time for\n\n565\n00:29:27.539 --> 00:29:31.110\na processor spends in the C1\nlow power idle state, right?\n\n566\n00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.654\nWho knew?\n\n567\n00:29:31.654 --> 00:29:33.394\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Someone did,\n\n568\n00:29:33.394 --> 00:29:34.625\nthey wrote the description.\n\n569\n00:29:34.625 --> 00:29:35.400\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, someone did.\n\n570\n00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.390\nThat is true.\n\n571\n00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:38.930\nSo we can use that as you're\ngoing through these counters.\n\n572\n00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:41.720\nIf you're not sure what a counter is,\njust check that little checkmark and\n\n573\n00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.080\nit's going to tell you what it is.\n\n574\n00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.620\nNow, it might not help you.\n\n575\n00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:46.980\nYou might read that and go, what?\n\n576\n00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:50.630\nThat's when a little more research\nis gonna have to come in.\n\n577\n00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:52.995\nAlso knowing what the numbers mean.\n\n578\n00:29:52.995 --> 00:29:57.480\nLike if you're monitoring, I don't know,\n\n579\n00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:00.660\na disk queue link on one\nof your hard drives, and\n\n580\n00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:04.510\nPerformance Monitor's telling you it's\nfive to seven, somewhere around there.\n\n581\n00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:05.728\nIs that good?\n\n582\n00:30:05.728 --> 00:30:08.250\nIs that bad?\n\n583\n00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:09.830\nIt's another thing that\nyou've gotta learn over time.\n\n584\n00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:12.010\nYou've gotta learn your systems,\nyou've gotta monitor them,\n\n585\n00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:14.360\nyou gotta see what's normal for you.\n\n586\n00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:18.260\nA little bit of research can help, but\nit is one of those things that you really\n\n587\n00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:22.240\njust have to learn, for\nexample, the disk queue length\n\n588\n00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:27.270\nis how many things are waiting in line for\nusage of the hard drive.\n\n589\n00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:31.220\nAnd the longer that queue gets that means\nthe more things that are waiting in line.\n\n590\n00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:33.850\nBut it also has to do with\nhow many spindles you have.\n\n591\n00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:37.220\nWell will effect whether\nthat number is good or bad.\n\n592\n00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:40.000\nThe rule of thumb with\nthat particular counter\n\n593\n00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.070\nis the number of spindles plus two.\n\n594\n00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:44.900\nSo, If we got a single drive,\nthat's one spindle,\n\n595\n00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:49.090\nplus two that makes my averages queue\nlength should be somewhere around three.\n\n596\n00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:51.428\nIt's not always going to be three,\nit might go up a little bit,\n\n597\n00:30:51.428 --> 00:30:53.693\nit might go down a little bit,\nbut on average, about three.\n\n598\n00:30:53.693 --> 00:30:56.287\nIf I've got a five-disk array, well,\n\n599\n00:30:56.287 --> 00:30:59.504\nthat's five spindles plus two,\nthat's seven.\n\n600\n00:30:59.504 --> 00:31:02.543\nSo my disk queue length should\nbe somewhere around seven,\n\n601\n00:31:02.543 --> 00:31:05.965\nmaybe balancing between five and\nnine, or something like that.\n\n602\n00:31:05.965 --> 00:31:10.436\nSo again, the whole idea is that you're\ngonna have to spend some time learning\n\n603\n00:31:10.436 --> 00:31:15.109\nwhat these counters are, which ones you\nneed to monitor, and it just takes time,\n\n604\n00:31:15.109 --> 00:31:16.495\nit takes experience.\n\n605\n00:31:16.495 --> 00:31:21.930\nSo another real time monitoring\ntool we've got our task manager,\n\n606\n00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:24.010\nwe've got Resource Monitor and\n\n607\n00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:28.150\nwe've got the Performance Monitor\nnode of Performance Monitor.\n\n608\n00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:31.950\nAll three very good tools to use if you're\ntrying to figure out what's going on right\n\n609\n00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:34.800\nnow, what is it that's causing\nthe server to slow down?\n\n610\n00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:35.750\n>> Yes, sir.\n\n611\n00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:38.660\nAnd like Mike said, it's just gonna\ntake a little bit of experience.\n\n612\n00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:43.490\nYou need to spend some time realizing\nhow does this server normally work.\n\n613\n00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:45.100\nAnd then you'll be able\nto figure out whether or\n\n614\n00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.890\nnot it's actually acting slowing or\nit's really speedy today, or whatever.\n\n615\n00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:52.340\nThat just takes experience with\nthat actual device itself.\n\n616\n00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:55.364\nAnd you can use these tools to figure out,\noh, well now that I can,\n\n617\n00:31:55.364 --> 00:31:56.828\nit's working the way I like it.\n\n618\n00:31:56.828 --> 00:31:59.975\nI'm gonna go ahead and use these tools\nto see how that looks graphically,\n\n619\n00:31:59.975 --> 00:32:01.490\nyou see all those metrics.\n\n620\n00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:05.770\nThen, when things start going awry,\nyou can take a look at that,\n\n621\n00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:07.000\nyou see the differences.\n\n622\n00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.620\nYou'll know where the problem is.\n\n623\n00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:11.250\nMike, thanks so much today,\nfor those cool demonstrations.\n\n624\n00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:13.650\nGreat tools built into\nthe Windows operating system.\n\n625\n00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:15.510\nHopefully you guys got a lot out of it,\nwe sure did.\n\n626\n00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:17.910\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ncall it a day for this episode.\n\n627\n00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:21.070\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n628\n00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:21.867\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n629\n00:32:21.867 --> 00:32:22.943\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n630\n00:32:22.943 --> 00:32:28.142\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.010\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.668\nJoining me on the show today, well, it's\nnone other than our good friend, again,\n\n5\n00:00:21.668 --> 00:00:22.553\nMr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:22.553 --> 00:00:23.570\nHow's it going today, Mike?\n\n7\n00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.660\n>> Oh, it's another day in paradise,\nDaniel.\n\n8\n00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.840\nI'm excited to be here.\n\n9\n00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.970\nWe've got more of our MTA\ncontent coming your way.\n\n10\n00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.200\nIn this one we're gonna be looking,\nwe're gonna continue, really,\n\n11\n00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.250\nour look at performance monitoring.\n\n12\n00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.980\nWe're gonna be focusing more on baselines\nor what we call baselines and alerts.\n\n13\n00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.100\nThere's a couple of things where we can\ntake monitoring up to that next step.\n\n14\n00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.150\nWe looked in previous episodes at doing\nwhat we call real-time monitoring.\n\n15\n00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.760\nAnd that's fine.\n\n16\n00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.073\nWhen you've got a server that's got some\nperformance issues, users are calling\n\n17\n00:00:55.073 --> 00:00:59.776\nyou up or application guys are saying,\nhow come that SQL Server so slow?\n\n18\n00:00:59.776 --> 00:01:04.570\nI need to go and take a look and see\nwhat's going on on the server right now.\n\n19\n00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.400\nTask manager, good choice.\n\n20\n00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.700\nResource monitor, great choice.\n\n21\n00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.930\nPerformance monitor adding the appropriate\ncounters, another great choice.\n\n22\n00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.960\nBut when we're talking about\nmonitoring for performance,\n\n23\n00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.490\nwe really need to, there's a little more,\nI guess I should say, that we need to do\n\n24\n00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.180\nto really reap the benefits of being\nable to monitor service performance.\n\n25\n00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.370\nAnd the big thing is,\nwhat we call creating a baseline.\n\n26\n00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.880\nBecause when it comes down to it,\nperformance is relative.\n\n27\n00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.420\nYou cannot monitor a server for\na couple of minutes\n\n28\n00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.700\none random time throughout the day and go,\nwow, that server's performing really well.\n\n29\n00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.460\nOr you're right,\nthat server's performing really slow.\n\n30\n00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.080\nThink about this.\n\n31\n00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.010\nIf I've got a laptop,\nI could pass that laptop around to Daniel,\n\n32\n00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.990\nto everybody else here at ITPro or\nto you guys out there.\n\n33\n00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.250\nEach one of you gets on that laptop,\ndoes whatever it is, and\n\n34\n00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.380\nsome of you might come back to me and\nsay, yeah, that laptop, it's pretty fast.\n\n35\n00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.180\nBecause compared to your old 1992 laptop,\nit's smoking fast.\n\n36\n00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.764\n>> My Toshiba Satellite is awesome, Mike.\n\n37\n00:02:07.764 --> 00:02:08.566\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n38\n00:02:08.566 --> 00:02:10.490\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you take that same laptop, and\n\n39\n00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.680\nyou hand it to Nate, and Nate's used to\nwork on his super cray and he's gonna say,\n\n40\n00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.830\nwell, this laptop stinks.\n\n41\n00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.780\nIt's really darn slow.\n\n42\n00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.610\nIt's all about,\nwhat do you have to compare it to?\n\n43\n00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.220\nThat's when I say performance\nis very relative.\n\n44\n00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.910\nYou've gotta have something to compare it\nto, to get an accurate representation.\n\n45\n00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.278\nI can't come into your network,\nlook at one of your servers and go, yeah,\n\n46\n00:02:30.278 --> 00:02:32.047\nthat thing's performing really bad.\n\n47\n00:02:32.047 --> 00:02:33.729\nI mean, there's a few obvious things.\n\n48\n00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:38.124\nIf the GPU is pegged, or the whole\nsystem's unresponsive but in general,\n\n49\n00:02:38.124 --> 00:02:41.264\nI can't tell you if that\nserver's performing good or\n\n50\n00:02:41.264 --> 00:02:44.502\nbad because I don't know\nwhat its normal workload is.\n\n51\n00:02:44.502 --> 00:02:47.070\nI don't know how it's normally performing.\n\n52\n00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.070\nSo we need to create a baseline.\n\n53\n00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.920\nAnd a baseline is simply capturing\nperformance information and\n\n54\n00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.940\nsaving it and doing it during a time when\nthe server's doing its normal thing.\n\n55\n00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.170\nWhen it's under a normal workload and\nit's behaving properly.\n\n56\n00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.310\nWe're gonna capture all that information.\n\n57\n00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.440\nWe're gonna save it, and then,\nin the future, when somebody says, man,\n\n58\n00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.810\nthat server is running really slow, I can\ngo back and capture that same information\n\n59\n00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.410\nagain and compare it to what I\nsaved the first time I captured it.\n\n60\n00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.130\nAnd I can say now,\nwith a little more authority or\n\n61\n00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.510\naccuracy that, yeah, you know what?\n\n62\n00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.280\nAdding those 50 new users has really had\na big impact on our domain controller.\n\n63\n00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.970\nOr no, it doesn't seem like the domain\ncontroller is running the way it always\n\n64\n00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.850\nhas by comparing these information.\n\n65\n00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.260\nBut without that baseline,\nnothing to compare it to.\n\n66\n00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.865\nSo it's very important that we establish\nthese baselines early on in the server's\n\n67\n00:03:40.865 --> 00:03:42.522\nlifetime so we can go back and do that.\n\n68\n00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:45.900\nAnd maybe this becomes part of your\nnormal maintenance in a once a week,\n\n69\n00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.030\nonce a month,\nyou run performance capture information.\n\n70\n00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.170\nAnd you start archiving this info for\nfuture use.\n\n71\n00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.150\nReally, just depends on\nwhat you're trying to do.\n\n72\n00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.630\nSecond thing I'll say about a baseline is,\n\n73\n00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.260\nyou've got to make sure you're\ncapturing accurate information.\n\n74\n00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.740\nAnd when I say accurate, I don't mean\nthat it could be bad info because you're\n\n75\n00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.300\nletting the computer do it, you're adding\ncounters, it's capturing what's going on.\n\n76\n00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.730\nBut if my user, or my admin comes\nto me Monday morning and says,\n\n77\n00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.850\nyou know what Mike, that DNS\nserver's just running really slow.\n\n78\n00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.950\nLike, all right, all right,\nall right, I'll take a look at it and\n\n79\n00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.290\nwe'll set it up.\n\n80\n00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.160\nAnd then, later that afternoon I like to\nstay late at work, as everybody leaves and\n\n81\n00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.410\nit's nice and quiet.\n\n82\n00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.260\nIt's 7 o'clock in the evening and I go\nmonitor performance on that server and\n\n83\n00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.820\nI capture the information.\n\n84\n00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.960\nAnd the next day the boss comes in and\nI show him, I was like,\n\n85\n00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.130\noh this CNS server is running really well.\n\n86\n00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.230\nWell, I captured the information\nat 7 'o clock at night\n\n87\n00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.030\nwhen nobody else is on the network.\n\n88\n00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.380\nThe server is not under a normal workload.\n\n89\n00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.620\nSo that's not accurate.\n\n90\n00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.100\nThat's what I mean by accurate.\n\n91\n00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.055\nYou need to capture the information\nunder a normal workload.\n\n92\n00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:54.265\nIf you're talking about your domain\ncontrollers, they experience a severe,\n\n93\n00:04:54.265 --> 00:04:55.195\nI don't wanna say a hit,\n\n94\n00:04:55.195 --> 00:04:59.005\nbut they do a lot of their work like 8\no'clock when everybody's logging in.\n\n95\n00:04:59.005 --> 00:05:01.380\nThose servers are gonna be really busy.\n\n96\n00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.880\nAgain it at, in the afternoon\nwhen everybody is logging off.\n\n97\n00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.950\nThat file server, during those morning\nhours, everybody is hitting it,\n\n98\n00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.950\ntrying to get their work done.\n\n99\n00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.920\nSo monitoring it in\nthe middle of the night,\n\n100\n00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.260\nwhen nobody is using the network,\nis not a good way to go.\n\n101\n00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.766\n>> Yeah, like Mike said, this is a very\nsubjective topic, the idea of performance.\n\n102\n00:05:20.766 --> 00:05:22.140\nIs this running fast?\n\n103\n00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.450\nIs it running slow?\n\n104\n00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.290\nEach server that you jump to, even\nwithin your own environment, will vary.\n\n105\n00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.780\nSo we have to find out how\ndoes it normally operate.\n\n106\n00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.770\nAnd Mike those were great points about\ndon't wait until everyone's logging in\n\n107\n00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.520\nthis morning and\nthe server's under an extreme stress.\n\n108\n00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.180\nOr don't wait until there's nobody doing\nanything because those are gonna be skewed\n\n109\n00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.391\nnumbers, it's gonna skew your data, and\nskewed data becomes skewed results.\n\n110\n00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:49.421\nWe wanna get the most\naccurate result possible, so\n\n111\n00:05:49.421 --> 00:05:54.081\nwe need to figure out when is a good,\nwhen has the network become homogenized.\n\n112\n00:05:54.081 --> 00:05:56.430\nWhen has that equilibrium occurred.\n\n113\n00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.370\nSo we're trying to figure\nout those best times, and\n\n114\n00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.788\nthat usually occurs between things\nlike lunch and login from the morning.\n\n115\n00:06:03.788 --> 00:06:06.830\nSo you try to find somewhere in there is\ngonna give you a more accurate result, and\n\n116\n00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.640\ntherefore it gives you better\nimplementations when it comes to\n\n117\n00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.050\nfixing things that\nare actually running slowly.\n\n118\n00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.560\n>> Yeah and\n\n119\n00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.920\nthere might be times that you wanna\ncapture some of that crunch time info.\n\n120\n00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.170\nBecause if my domain controllers are\nrunning really well, say from 10 to 12,\n\n121\n00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:22.990\nwell, maybe there's not a lot going on.\n\n122\n00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.980\nI need to know,\nwhat's a good way to say this, Daniel?\n\n123\n00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.270\nI do need to pay attention\nto that busy time.\n\n124\n00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.061\nBecause I want my servers to be able to\nhandle that spike that they're gonna get,\n\n125\n00:06:33.061 --> 00:06:34.916\ncuz I know it's coming every morning.\n\n126\n00:06:34.916 --> 00:06:38.271\nSo there are times when I do need\nto capture that information and\n\n127\n00:06:38.271 --> 00:06:40.145\ninclude that in my baseline.\n\n128\n00:06:40.145 --> 00:06:43.386\nBut what I really don't wanna do is\nmonitor this stuff at three in the morning\n\n129\n00:06:43.386 --> 00:06:46.187\nwhen nobody's using it,\ncuz that doesn't do me any good at all.\n\n130\n00:06:46.187 --> 00:06:49.057\nYou could have a server\nwith a crappy processor,\n\n131\n00:06:49.057 --> 00:06:53.048\na stick of RAM that's got a gig in there,\nand one lonely hard drive.\n\n132\n00:06:53.048 --> 00:06:55.993\nIf nobody is actually reading and\nwriting to it, and blah, blah, blah,\n\n133\n00:06:55.993 --> 00:06:58.390\nit's gonna look like it's\nperforming really well.\n\n134\n00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.262\n>> Yeah, Mike, it looks like we really\nneed to categorize our results.\n\n135\n00:07:02.262 --> 00:07:05.610\nI've got, under heavy load,\ncan I handle this.\n\n136\n00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.790\nUnder normal load,\nwhat does this look like?\n\n137\n00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.440\nUnder light load, what are my numbers.\n\n138\n00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.813\nGetting those different categories and\nsetting everything apart so you can take\n\n139\n00:07:13.813 --> 00:07:19.400\na look at the data is gonna really help\nyou optimize the system as best you can.\n\n140\n00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.496\n>> Absolutely.\n\n141\n00:07:20.496 --> 00:07:22.737\nSo let's take a look at some of\nthe tools that we can use or\n\n142\n00:07:22.737 --> 00:07:24.740\nthe tool that we're gonna use to do this.\n\n143\n00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.350\nAnd in a previous episode I\nmentioned real time monitoring and\n\n144\n00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.090\nI think I've mentioned it in here,\nas well.\n\n145\n00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:34.910\nTask manager, resource monitor and then\nperformance monitor has that one node.\n\n146\n00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:35.630\nThat's real time.\n\n147\n00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:39.170\nIn other words I add the counters,\nI'm seeing whats going on right now.\n\n148\n00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:40.690\nBut if I wanna create a baseline,\n\n149\n00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:45.350\nif I want something that I can refer back\nto, I have to do historical monitoring.\n\n150\n00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:48.483\nThat means that somehow I've got to\ncapture the information and save it so\n\n151\n00:07:48.483 --> 00:07:50.262\nwe can go back and\nlook at it in the future.\n\n152\n00:07:50.262 --> 00:07:52.364\nNow, let me show you how to do that.\n\n153\n00:07:52.364 --> 00:07:55.741\nI'm simply gonna open up good\nold Performance Monitor again.\n\n154\n00:07:55.741 --> 00:07:57.703\nSame tool we saw before.\n\n155\n00:07:57.703 --> 00:08:02.503\nAnd remember, we went to Performance\nMonitor here and I was able to add those\n\n156\n00:08:02.503 --> 00:08:07.590\ncounters and I could see exactly what\nwas going on in the system right now.\n\n157\n00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.535\nBut, this doesn't save any of that info.\n\n158\n00:08:09.535 --> 00:08:14.520\nI wanna create a baseline or if I wanna\nsave information to turn it into a report\n\n159\n00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.940\nor what have you, I have to go down\nto what we call Data Collector Sets.\n\n160\n00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:24.330\nAnd these data collector sets are where\nwe can create a set of counters and\n\n161\n00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.790\nthen save the information or\nlog the information.\n\n162\n00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:30.702\nI'm simply gonna right-click\non User Define and\n\n163\n00:08:30.702 --> 00:08:32.730\nchoose New > Data Collector Set.\n\n164\n00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.430\nAnd I get to give it a name.\n\n165\n00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:41.710\nAnd I'm gonna call this one svr03baseline.\n\n166\n00:08:45.071 --> 00:08:47.110\nNow you can choose a template.\n\n167\n00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.640\nI don't like the templates,\neven though it says recommended.\n\n168\n00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.300\nThe templates have a predetermined\nset of counters that come with them,\n\n169\n00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.340\nand there's a lot.\n\n170\n00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:59.250\nAnd what ends up happening is when I run\nthose templates, I get so much information\n\n171\n00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:03.330\nthat I spend a lot of time filtering it\ndown to just the information I wanna see.\n\n172\n00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.150\nMe personally,\nI would rather start with my own custom,\n\n173\n00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:09.230\nbecause I can add the counters,\njust the counters that I want.\n\n174\n00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:10.106\nYou might experiment,\n\n175\n00:09:10.106 --> 00:09:12.660\nyou might find that some of those\ntemplates work really good for you.\n\n176\n00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:16.250\nIn fact, if I remember right,\nthere's three.\n\n177\n00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:19.520\nThere's System Performance,\nSystem Diagnostics and Basic.\n\n178\n00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:24.250\nI'm going to go back though, and\nI'm gonna create mine, manually.\n\n179\n00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:25.580\nWe like to be advanced, right?\n\n180\n00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.170\nWe're power users.\n\n181\n00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.813\nAnd then what I wanna do,\nI wanna create a data log, and\n\n182\n00:09:29.813 --> 00:09:32.510\nI wanna do performance\ncounter information.\n\n183\n00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.950\nNow there are some other options here,\nevent trace data, really good for\n\n184\n00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:39.910\nwhen you're troubleshooting a program and\ntrying to figure out what it's\n\n185\n00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:43.380\nreaching out, where it's having problems,\nwe're not gonna look at that in here.\n\n186\n00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.590\nSystem configuration information,\nsometimes that can be useful,\n\n187\n00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:49.120\nespecially if you're going\nthrough a configuration change.\n\n188\n00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.855\nYou can capture performance information,\nand the current configuration.\n\n189\n00:09:52.855 --> 00:09:54.215\nThen you go and you update the RAM.\n\n190\n00:09:54.215 --> 00:09:56.585\nAnd you capture that\nperformance information again.\n\n191\n00:09:56.585 --> 00:09:59.375\nYou can see the configuration\nthat's changed, and see whether or\n\n192\n00:09:59.375 --> 00:10:01.685\nnot it's changed any of those numbers.\n\n193\n00:10:01.685 --> 00:10:04.035\nFor now though I'm just gonna\ndo a performance counter.\n\n194\n00:10:04.035 --> 00:10:05.720\nAnd I'll click Next.\n\n195\n00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.590\nThen I get to add my counters.\n\n196\n00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:12.050\nSo I'll click Add and this should look\nfamiliar if you watch that other episode.\n\n197\n00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:15.700\nSame screen I used to add counters\nto the real time monitoring,\n\n198\n00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:16.710\nI used it here as well.\n\n199\n00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:19.391\nAnd let's add our four main subsystems and\n\n200\n00:10:19.391 --> 00:10:23.130\nI'll show you the most commonly\nmonitored counters here.\n\n201\n00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:27.975\nFor the processor, it's typically percent\nprocessor time, that's gonna be the one\n\n202\n00:10:27.975 --> 00:10:32.305\nthat gives you an overall estimate of\nhow busy that processor is, all right?\n\n203\n00:10:32.305 --> 00:10:39.325\nFor memory, usually we're\ntalking about pages per second.\n\n204\n00:10:39.325 --> 00:10:43.733\nAnd as you can see, there are lots\nof other counters that we could add.\n\n205\n00:10:43.733 --> 00:10:48.287\nBut again, you get just an overall basic\ninfo about how memory is performing,\n\n206\n00:10:48.287 --> 00:10:50.085\npages per second is a good one.\n\n207\n00:10:50.085 --> 00:10:54.560\nAll right, and I like to collapse these\nup, cuz this list can get rather long.\n\n208\n00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.897\nAnd then for my physical disk, and\n\n209\n00:10:56.897 --> 00:11:01.780\nthere is a difference between\nphysical disk and logical, right?\n\n210\n00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.611\nLogical would be your volume, C: D:.\n\n211\n00:11:04.611 --> 00:11:07.270\nYou can have more than one volume\non the same physical drive.\n\n212\n00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:10.210\nI wanna see how that physical\ndrive is handling things.\n\n213\n00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:14.531\nAnd that's usually gonna be\naverage disk queue length.\n\n214\n00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:21.350\nWhich is basically the waiting list for\nthings to talk to that drive.\n\n215\n00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.010\nWhat did I leave out there Daniel?\n\n216\n00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:28.217\nNetworking, oops,\nit's the only window I know of in\n\n217\n00:11:28.217 --> 00:11:35.150\nWindows where the expand and\ncollapse icon is on the right side.\n\n218\n00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.520\nAnd, I think this was\ndeveloped in maybe England,\n\n219\n00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.150\nwhere we like to drive on\nthe other side of the road.\n\n220\n00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:41.260\nWhat was I looking for?\n\n221\n00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:42.000\n>> Networking?\n\n222\n00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.330\n>> Networking, thank you.\n\n223\n00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:44.450\nLost track there.\n\n224\n00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:51.591\nLet's go back up to Network Interface and\nwe'll just do a bytes total per second.\n\n225\n00:11:51.591 --> 00:11:53.670\nAll right, so\nadd all the counters you want.\n\n226\n00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.060\nWhatever it is you need to\nmonitor on this server.\n\n227\n00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.840\nGo ahead and click OK.\n\n228\n00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.870\nAnd then I've got my sample interval.\n\n229\n00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:04.230\nHow often do I wanna capture this\ninformation, cuz this is gonna go out and\n\n230\n00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:08.400\nread pages per second, disk queue length,\npercent processor time.\n\n231\n00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.110\nI'm gonna drop this down\nto every one second.\n\n232\n00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:15.570\nKeep in mind, in a production environment\nthough, that might be a little extreme,\n\n233\n00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:18.833\nbecause now it's gotta read all\nthose counters every second and\n\n234\n00:12:18.833 --> 00:12:23.440\nit's gotta write that all to a log\nfile which could then increase.\n\n235\n00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.360\nIf you're monitoring dozens of counters,\n\n236\n00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.270\nmeasuring it every one second, that's\na lot of writes to the hard drive, right?\n\n237\n00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:32.280\nSo now your hard drive\nactivity is gonna be skewed\n\n238\n00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.430\nby the monitoring that you're doing.\n\n239\n00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:35.290\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n240\n00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:37.030\nYou can also monitor remotely.\n\n241\n00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:41.980\nIf I wanted to monitor disk activity but\nI didn't want my monitoring to\n\n242\n00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:45.570\nskew the disk activity,\nI could monitor remotely, right?\n\n243\n00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:47.450\nBut then that would skew\nmy networking numbers.\n\n244\n00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:51.690\nSo just think about what you're trying to\ndo and decide what the best route to go.\n\n245\n00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:52.990\nClick Next.\n\n246\n00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:54.730\nWhere does it wanna save it,\nknow this one.\n\n247\n00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:57.610\nI don't know why they love to ask this,\nthe default location for\n\n248\n00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.230\nthese is gonna be C:/PerfLogs/Admin/.\n\n249\n00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:03.380\nIt's gonna create a folder\ncalled PerfLogs on your C drive,\n\n250\n00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.180\nyou can always change that if you want.\n\n251\n00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.560\nWe'll click Next.\n\n252\n00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.038\nAnd if I needed to run an other\ncredentials, if I wanted a help desk\n\n253\n00:13:10.038 --> 00:13:13.850\nperson to be able to start this up but\nthey don't have the permissions.\n\n254\n00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:16.038\nOr if I want to use this\nas a scheduled task and\n\n255\n00:13:16.038 --> 00:13:20.310\nit needs permissions I could save other\ncredentials, I'm just gonna click Finish.\n\n256\n00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:21.290\nAnd I am the admin.\n\n257\n00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:23.640\nWe're good to go, all right?\n\n258\n00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.830\nSo now I have got this user\ndefined data collector set.\n\n259\n00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:29.750\nA couple quirky things I\nwanna show you about this.\n\n260\n00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:32.820\nWhen you select your server,\nthis baseline that I created here,\n\n261\n00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:35.730\nthis data collector set.\n\n262\n00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:38.380\nI can click on Properties\non either one of these.\n\n263\n00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:42.520\nIf I pull the Properties up for\nthe Data Collector Set itself,\n\n264\n00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:47.100\nnotice I get things like Description,\nKeywords, where it's gonna store it.\n\n265\n00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.660\nThere's also a Schedule tab.\n\n266\n00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.820\nThis is gonna be a very important\none that we go in and mess with.\n\n267\n00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:56.288\nBecause remember, I said I don't wanna\ncapture information for five minutes,\n\n268\n00:13:56.288 --> 00:13:56.900\ncall it a day.\n\n269\n00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.720\nI wanna monitor traffic from 8 in\nthe morning until 10 in the morning.\n\n270\n00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.895\nAnd then again when everybody\ncomes back from lunch,\n\n271\n00:14:02.895 --> 00:14:05.860\nfrom 1 o'clock to 3 o'clock in\nthe afternoon or something like that.\n\n272\n00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:08.610\nOr maybe 8 to 9 in the morning,\n1 to 2 in the afternoon and\n\n273\n00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:10.040\nthen 4 to 5 in the afternoon.\n\n274\n00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:14.470\nAll right, so I wanna get an overall\nidea of how the server is performing.\n\n275\n00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:15.710\nSo you create schedules.\n\n276\n00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:20.286\nI'm gonna click Add and I'm gonna say\nI wanna do this Monday through Friday.\n\n277\n00:14:20.286 --> 00:14:22.327\nAll right, starting today.\n\n278\n00:14:22.327 --> 00:14:26.068\nAnd I want it to start at 8:00 AM.\n\n279\n00:14:26.068 --> 00:14:27.586\nAnd I click OK.\n\n280\n00:14:27.586 --> 00:14:30.360\nAll right,\nnotice I didn't say when to stop.\n\n281\n00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.100\nThat's gonna be an important part.\n\n282\n00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.520\nI wanna add another schedule.\n\n283\n00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.940\nYou can add as many as you want.\n\n284\n00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:41.650\nI want it to start again at 1 PM,\nMonday through Friday.\n\n285\n00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:47.270\nSo now it's gonna run at 8 in\nthe morning and 1 in the afternoon.\n\n286\n00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:51.200\nBut, at the way that it's set right now,\nit would never stop.\n\n287\n00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.770\nIt would start at 8 in the morning and\nit would just keep running.\n\n288\n00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:56.250\nYou have to put a stop condition.\n\n289\n00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:59.630\nAnd I'm gonna put an overall\nduration of one hour.\n\n290\n00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.830\nSo now it's gonna start up at 8,\nrun for an hour, stop.\n\n291\n00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:07.480\nStart up at 1 o'clock in the afternoon,\nrun for an hour, and stop.\n\n292\n00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:11.270\nYou can also put limits like how big\nthe log file gets if you're worried about\n\n293\n00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:13.600\neating up disk space or\nsomething like that.\n\n294\n00:15:14.838 --> 00:15:17.910\nAnd now I've got my schedule set up,\nwe should be good to go.\n\n295\n00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:19.680\nI will click OK.\n\n296\n00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:24.890\nNotice in that set of properties, I never\nsaw the counters again or the duration.\n\n297\n00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:29.090\nI might wanna monitor or alter that,\nthat's gonna be the properties of this\n\n298\n00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:34.150\nover here, the DataCollector01 and\nthere you can see the counters I've added.\n\n299\n00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:39.060\nSo if I wanna add or remove counters or\nif I wanna change that sample interval.\n\n300\n00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:42.060\nSo just know,\ntwo different places to click properties\n\n301\n00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:46.160\nto get access to modify\nyour data collector set.\n\n302\n00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.920\nAll right, I'm not gonna wait around\ntil 1 o'clock this afternoon, so\n\n303\n00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.660\nI'm gonna start this guy up manually.\n\n304\n00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.330\nI'll go ahead and click Play here.\n\n305\n00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:58.458\nYou can also right-click on it, choose\nStart, if it wasn't started already.\n\n306\n00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:01.336\nOr I could just wait for\nthat schedule to kick in.\n\n307\n00:16:01.336 --> 00:16:03.218\nAnd I'll try to make\na little bit of activity.\n\n308\n00:16:03.218 --> 00:16:06.317\nWe'll just launch a few things here.\n\n309\n00:16:06.317 --> 00:16:09.750\nJust to make something\nhappen on my system.\n\n310\n00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.930\n>> That critical utility minesweeper,\ndon't forget about it, and\n\n311\n00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:18.320\nsolitaire if those are running your server\nis obviously gonna take a performance hit.\n\n312\n00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.960\n>> Exactly, so\nwe're gonna run this server back I've\n\n313\n00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.680\ngot to load all that information up,\nthat's a good read.\n\n314\n00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.052\nThere we go.\n\n315\n00:16:26.052 --> 00:16:30.030\nAll right, so once I'm just gonna\ngo a head and stop this manually.\n\n316\n00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:35.020\nSo I put it on my little stop button,\nand we'll stop that guy.\n\n317\n00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:38.870\nAnd let me close some of these guys here.\n\n318\n00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:43.252\nJust because I'm a little OCD\nabout that kind of thing.\n\n319\n00:16:43.252 --> 00:16:45.020\nAll right, so\nnow the question becomes, great,\n\n320\n00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.280\nI've got this information,\nhow do I view it?\n\n321\n00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.620\nWhere did it go?\n\n322\n00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.380\nWell, couple ways you can do this.\n\n323\n00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:55.290\nMy favorite way, and I think the easiest\nway by far, is come down to reports, and\n\n324\n00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:59.240\nthen user defined, and\nthen there's my server 03 baseline.\n\n325\n00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.860\nUnderneath there I'm gonna see the report.\n\n326\n00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:05.780\nAnd you see this nice date time stamp,\nand this incremental number.\n\n327\n00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:08.460\nRemember, it's gonna fire again\nat 1 o'clock in the afternoon.\n\n328\n00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.560\nAnd maybe you have several schedules.\n\n329\n00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.750\nSo there might be more than one\nreport generated on the same day so\n\n330\n00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:18.570\nit adds that incremental number I\nclick on that report, and there it is.\n\n331\n00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:20.150\nThere's my information.\n\n332\n00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:21.740\nNow obviously, I didn't make it too busy,\n\n333\n00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.890\nmost of my counters are running\nright along the bottom there.\n\n334\n00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:28.000\nBut I can see the info,\nthat's what I wanted to show you.\n\n335\n00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.288\nThe other thing that we can do that's\nreally cool is we can zoom in to\n\n336\n00:17:32.288 --> 00:17:34.902\na particular area on this information.\n\n337\n00:17:34.902 --> 00:17:39.545\nThis is a very short time slice,\n10:52-10:53.\n\n338\n00:17:39.545 --> 00:17:41.577\nJust about a minute or so, right?\n\n339\n00:17:41.577 --> 00:17:42.924\nSo pretty easy to see.\n\n340\n00:17:42.924 --> 00:17:45.582\nImagine running this for an hour.\n\n341\n00:17:45.582 --> 00:17:49.698\nYou're gonna have an hour's worth of info\ncrammed into this little window here, and\n\n342\n00:17:49.698 --> 00:17:53.314\nI'm gonna see some interesting spikes but\nI can't tell what's going on.\n\n343\n00:17:53.314 --> 00:17:58.589\nThat's when you can grab these\nlittle handles on the edge,\n\n344\n00:17:58.589 --> 00:18:01.870\nand you can drag them in, all right?\n\n345\n00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:05.388\nAnd then you can right click on\nthat gray area and choose zoom to.\n\n346\n00:18:05.388 --> 00:18:09.625\nAnd now I'm looking at\nfrom 10.53.06 to 10:53:12.\n\n347\n00:18:09.625 --> 00:18:11.726\nI'm looking at six seconds of time.\n\n348\n00:18:11.726 --> 00:18:15.824\nAgain, not really meaningful here,\nbut if you've got an hour or\n\n349\n00:18:15.824 --> 00:18:18.135\ntwos worth of data crammed in there,\n\n350\n00:18:18.135 --> 00:18:23.390\nthat something happened about 8:20 you\nstarted getting a lot of messages.\n\n351\n00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:28.680\nYou can now zoom in to 8:15 to 8:25 and\nsee what the heck was going on.\n\n352\n00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:33.570\nNow if I want to zoom back out, I can grab\nthese handles, throw them back out to\n\n353\n00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:39.490\nthe end, zoom two and\nI'm back out to the original information.\n\n354\n00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:40.630\nSo it doesn't go away.\n\n355\n00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:42.100\nYou're just filtering it.\n\n356\n00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:46.040\nOther things that might be handy to know\nabout this guy is this highlighter here.\n\n357\n00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.130\nWhen you turn on that highlighter,\n\n358\n00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:52.350\nwhichever counter you select.,\nwe'll get a dark black line.\n\n359\n00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:56.360\nVery handy when some of these counters\nare running right along the bottom or\n\n360\n00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.800\nif one of them was running\nright along the top,\n\n361\n00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.200\nmakes it a lot easier\nto find that counter.\n\n362\n00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.900\nOr if you've just got dozens\nof counters out there,\n\n363\n00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.650\nit can be really helpful\nto find it that way.\n\n364\n00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.370\nAll right,\nwhat else do we know about this guy?\n\n365\n00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:12.000\nSo the one way to view it,\nagain I think that's the easiest,\n\n366\n00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.120\nI'll show you Microsoft's way,\nthe way they want you to look at this,\n\n367\n00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:19.990\nis to go back up to Performance Monitor\nand this is real-time monitoring.\n\n368\n00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:24.280\nI can change this to view log data,\nall right.\n\n369\n00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.910\nAnd then, I've gotta tell it where it is.\n\n370\n00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:32.612\nI'll choose log files, add, and there's\nmy default location C:PerfLogsAdmin,\n\n371\n00:19:32.612 --> 00:19:36.532\nserver three baseline and\nthere's that report.\n\n372\n00:19:36.532 --> 00:19:40.769\nSo, now I can add that report and\nI can click OK.\n\n373\n00:19:40.769 --> 00:19:42.070\nAnd what?\n\n374\n00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:43.455\nWhere's my data?\n\n375\n00:19:43.455 --> 00:19:44.235\n>> That's interesting.\n\n376\n00:19:44.235 --> 00:19:44.975\n>> Yeah.\n\n377\n00:19:44.975 --> 00:19:46.215\n>> Junky file you go there Mike.\n\n378\n00:19:46.215 --> 00:19:49.325\n>> I know, right,\nwe know the real piece of crap [LAUGH].\n\n379\n00:19:49.325 --> 00:19:51.669\n>> We know there's data in there,\nwe just looked at it, right?\n\n380\n00:19:51.669 --> 00:19:52.870\nWhere is it?\n\n381\n00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:55.530\nWell when you do it this way,\nwhen you open up a log file\n\n382\n00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:59.140\nthrough the performance monitor\nnode there's a little trick to it.\n\n383\n00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.290\nYou've gotta tell it what\ncounters you wanna view.\n\n384\n00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:05.250\nYou might have a log file that has\ndozens and dozens of counters in it.\n\n385\n00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:08.800\nAnd when you're opening up the log file,\nmaybe you just wanna see two of them, so\n\n386\n00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:09.920\nit doesn't start with any of them.\n\n387\n00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:14.240\nI go back here to view log data\nI told it where the log was.\n\n388\n00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:19.280\nI also have to go over here to the data\ntab, and add the counters again.\n\n389\n00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.620\nLike wait, Mike,\nI've gotta add them over again?\n\n390\n00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:23.460\nYes, but, look at the list.\n\n391\n00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:24.600\nIt's much shorter.\n\n392\n00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:28.595\nOnly the counters that you captured in\nthe first place are gonna show up here.\n\n393\n00:20:28.595 --> 00:20:33.134\nSo if I just want to see\nthat percent processor time.\n\n394\n00:20:33.134 --> 00:20:34.619\nLooks like I added them both there anyway.\n\n395\n00:20:34.619 --> 00:20:36.442\nLet's remove that one.\n\n396\n00:20:36.442 --> 00:20:39.717\nAll right, maybe I just want\nto see percent processor time.\n\n397\n00:20:39.717 --> 00:20:40.870\nNow, where my disc went?\n\n398\n00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:45.070\nIt does seem to be gone,\nand I open that up.\n\n399\n00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:50.010\nWow, Daniel,\nit's really having a fit with me now.\n\n400\n00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:51.800\nLet's double check that log files.\n\n401\n00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.090\nWe got that guy added.\n\n402\n00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:55.230\nLet's go back to data.\n\n403\n00:20:55.230 --> 00:21:01.420\nLet's add, and let's find processor,\npercent processor over time,\n\n404\n00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:05.850\nwe'll add that guy, we'll click okay,\nwe'll apply that, we'll click okay.\n\n405\n00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:06.710\nAnd there we go.\n\n406\n00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:11.750\nNow notice i'm only seeing the one out of\nthe four counters I added initially and\n\n407\n00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:13.040\njust another way to view it.\n\n408\n00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.850\nI don't know why Microsoft\nprefers that way.\n\n409\n00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:17.460\nI guess they think you're using\nthose templates that have\n\n410\n00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:20.560\nhundreds of counters that you don't care\nabout and now you want to filter it down.\n\n411\n00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:24.398\nI say create your own, start from scratch,\nadd just the counters you need.\n\n412\n00:21:24.398 --> 00:21:27.382\nAnd then use this nice\nreport view down here.\n\n413\n00:21:27.382 --> 00:21:30.180\nEither way you go though same information.\n\n414\n00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.750\nSo that's a good look at how\nwe create that baseline.\n\n415\n00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:36.420\nAgain, that the keys there are gonna be\nto make sure that you add your counters.\n\n416\n00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.810\nDo not forget to configure your schedule.\n\n417\n00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:42.940\nOnce you create it you have to\ngo back into the properties and\n\n418\n00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.780\nyou've got to set up your schedule.\n\n419\n00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:47.550\nGotta determine when you\nwanna fire this thing off and\n\n420\n00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:49.810\nyou've got to set up a stop condition.\n\n421\n00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:51.340\nOtherwise it's just gonna run forever.\n\n422\n00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:55.500\nYou forget that, you'll end up eating\nup all your, it runs for a week, and\n\n423\n00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:58.300\nall of a sudden your log file's got so\nbig that your hard drive is full and\n\n424\n00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.120\nyou've crashed a server, no bueno.\n\n425\n00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:03.160\n>> Boy that last scheduled run is gonna\nbe one heck of a fun time to look at it.\n\n426\n00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.850\nLook at that disk guy.\n\n427\n00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:07.970\n[LAUGH] There's a lot of\nwriting going on in that thing.\n\n428\n00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:09.790\nYeah, you're out of disk space.\n\n429\n00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:13.780\nBut it's very cool, cuz I like the ability\nto do the compare and contrast, right?\n\n430\n00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:17.330\nWe've got our schedule of running tasks,\nor the counters, and\n\n431\n00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:19.160\nas soon as I feel like hey, you know what?\n\n432\n00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.530\nI need to check performance on this guy.\n\n433\n00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:22.010\nMaybe it feels a little sluggish.\n\n434\n00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:26.788\nI can just start bringing them\nup at this specific time.\n\n435\n00:22:26.788 --> 00:22:29.130\nOh look at this one, it spiked up.\n\n436\n00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:30.600\nLet's go in there and see what's going on.\n\n437\n00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:32.080\nWhat happened at that time?\n\n438\n00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.960\nMaybe that's why I'm experiencing\na problem now, I can look and\n\n439\n00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:37.580\nsee what was running, what was going on,\nwhat kind of rights were happening,\n\n440\n00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:39.080\nmaybe there's network activity.\n\n441\n00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.600\nWho knows what it was,\nit's nice to have that side by side view,\n\n442\n00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.890\nbe able to see the counter I need to see,\nbeing able to highlight that.\n\n443\n00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:47.310\nVery, very, really helpful.\n\n444\n00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:50.230\n>> Absolutely, and it's a great point\nDaniel, we can come back over here and\n\n445\n00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:51.490\ntake a look at this.\n\n446\n00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:52.560\nI can flip back and forth.\n\n447\n00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:57.911\nIf I turn Performance Monitor back to real\ntime and we let some data build up there,\n\n448\n00:22:57.911 --> 00:23:01.959\nI can sit here and go okay,\nthat's about what it normally is.\n\n449\n00:23:01.959 --> 00:23:04.862\nThat's what it is now.\n\n450\n00:23:04.862 --> 00:23:06.801\nThat's what it normally is.\n\n451\n00:23:06.801 --> 00:23:08.290\nThat's what it is now, right?\n\n452\n00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:10.020\nI can sit there and compare counters.\n\n453\n00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:12.860\nAnd try to figure out,\nhey is this a normal thing or\n\n454\n00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.210\nis something out of the ordinary?\n\n455\n00:23:15.282 --> 00:23:19.230\nAll right, last thing I want to show you\nguys here is something known as an alert,\n\n456\n00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:21.350\na performance alert.\n\n457\n00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:24.320\nWe wanna set up our baselines,\nwe wanna capture the information.\n\n458\n00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:28.190\nWe know we can come in here and we can\nmonitor real time, any time we think\n\n459\n00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:31.800\nthere's a problem or somebody is\nasking us about a service performance.\n\n460\n00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:35.190\nBut I can't sit here and\nwatch it all day long.\n\n461\n00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:38.130\nMy boss is not gonna pay me\nto sit here and go, okay,\n\n462\n00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:41.730\nCPU looks good, CPU looks good,\nand just chill all day, right?\n\n463\n00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:44.610\nIf you find that job,\nlet me know because I'm gonna come and\n\n464\n00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:46.972\ntry to take it away from you.\n\n465\n00:23:46.972 --> 00:23:50.199\n[LAUGH] If all I had to do\nwas [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH].\n\n466\n00:23:50.199 --> 00:23:55.023\nAll right, so Performance Monitor gives us\nsomething called performance alerts and\n\n467\n00:23:55.023 --> 00:23:59.177\nthese allow me to use the same set of\ncounters that we've been playing with\n\n468\n00:23:59.177 --> 00:24:00.659\nin our performance logs.\n\n469\n00:24:00.659 --> 00:24:06.322\nAnd set an alert, set a threshold,\nand have the system monitor it for me.\n\n470\n00:24:06.322 --> 00:24:11.790\nAnd then just let me know any time that\nparticular counter reaches that threshold.\n\n471\n00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:13.540\nHow cool is that, all right.\n\n472\n00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:14.970\nLet's check it out.\n\n473\n00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:16.960\nI'm gonna go back down\nhere to User Define.\n\n474\n00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:21.575\nIt's the same place that we\ncreated that data collector set.\n\n475\n00:24:21.575 --> 00:24:26.141\nRight-click, in fact, you choose\nNew Data Collector Set, all right.\n\n476\n00:24:26.141 --> 00:24:29.554\nAnd I'm gonna give it a name,\n\n477\n00:24:29.554 --> 00:24:34.490\nI'm gonna call this one Processor Alert.\n\n478\n00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:35.732\nSpell Processor Alert.\n\n479\n00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:43.480\nAnd I'm gonna create it manually,\nand I'll click Next.\n\n480\n00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.010\nAnd this time,\ninstead of doing Create Data Log,\n\n481\n00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:48.870\nI'm gonna choose\nPerformance Counter Alert.\n\n482\n00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:50.500\nI'll click Next.\n\n483\n00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:54.798\nAnd then, same thing, add my counter,\nand I'm gonna do that Processor,\n\n484\n00:24:54.798 --> 00:24:55.967\n% Processor Time.\n\n485\n00:24:55.967 --> 00:24:58.780\nNow add that guy and click OK.\n\n486\n00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:03.760\nAnd then notice instead of an interval,\n\n487\n00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.960\nI have Alert When, and\nI choose Above or Below.\n\n488\n00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:12.210\nAnd I'm gonna say anytime\nit gets above 5%.\n\n489\n00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:16.420\nAnd now, obviously, in the real world your\nprocessor's typically gonna jump above 5%\n\n490\n00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:19.820\nthroughout the day, well, hopefully.\n\n491\n00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:22.050\nThat this is a lap and\nI want you guys to see what happens.\n\n492\n00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:23.840\nSo I'm gonna drop it\nall the way down to 5%.\n\n493\n00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:28.050\nI'll click Next, and then Save and Close.\n\n494\n00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:30.560\nAnd I now have this processor alert.\n\n495\n00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:31.460\nNow, you're not done.\n\n496\n00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.965\nOnce you create it,\nyou have to go back in and\n\n497\n00:25:33.965 --> 00:25:36.515\ndefine it much like we did\nthe data collector set.\n\n498\n00:25:36.515 --> 00:25:39.705\nSo I'm gonna right-click on that and\nchoose Properties, and\n\n499\n00:25:39.705 --> 00:25:43.675\nI'm gonna go over to that Schedule tab and\nI can run a schedule.\n\n500\n00:25:43.675 --> 00:25:47.832\nMaybe I'll only want this alert to be\nactive between 8 and 10 in the morning,\n\n501\n00:25:47.832 --> 00:25:52.000\nall right, because other times\nthe processor typically doesn't spike.\n\n502\n00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.760\nBut something's going\non in the morning and\n\n503\n00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.330\nI wanna be alerted when it happens,\nall right.\n\n504\n00:25:56.330 --> 00:26:01.280\nSo you can do a schedule,\njust like we did on the baseline.\n\n505\n00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:05.240\nYou can also set up a stop condition\njust like we did, all right.\n\n506\n00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.270\nI'll go ahead and click OK.\n\n507\n00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:08.480\nNow there is a tab over here called Task.\n\n508\n00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:12.380\nThis is run the scheduled task\nwhen the date collector set stops.\n\n509\n00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.800\nSo once this had reached\nits stop condition,\n\n510\n00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.630\nmaybe you want something else to happen.\n\n511\n00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:17.930\nNot gonna mess with it here.\n\n512\n00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:19.110\nAnd I'm not gonna set a schedule.\n\n513\n00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:22.330\nI'm gonna manually run this for\nyou guys, live.\n\n514\n00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:24.140\nBut in the real world,\nyou'd probably set up a schedule.\n\n515\n00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:27.860\nThen I'm gonna go over here\nto the Data Collector 01.\n\n516\n00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:30.685\nI've got the processors alert selected.\n\n517\n00:26:30.685 --> 00:26:33.840\nRight-click on this\nData Collector 01 properties, and\n\n518\n00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.950\nyou can see where I set above five,\nbut how often do I wanna sample that?\n\n519\n00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:39.530\nI'm gonna say every one second.\n\n520\n00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:44.210\nThen I'm gonna look at my alert action.\n\n521\n00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:46.640\nThis is the big thing you've\ngotta come in and configure.\n\n522\n00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.360\nWhat do you want?\n\n523\n00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:51.300\nWhen it gets to above five,\nwhat do you want to happen, all right?\n\n524\n00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:52.720\nWell, I want it to log an entry.\n\n525\n00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:56.500\nI'll give you, this is a pretty\nlimited system, all right?\n\n526\n00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:00.310\nYour one choice is to log an entry\nin the application event log.\n\n527\n00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:04.697\nOkay, but we know, or we will know as\nyou go through other server classes.\n\n528\n00:27:04.697 --> 00:27:07.769\nThere are some cool things that\nI can do with the event log,\n\n529\n00:27:07.769 --> 00:27:11.407\nwhere I can set up a scheduled task\nanytime this particular alert gets\n\n530\n00:27:11.407 --> 00:27:13.430\nregistered in the event log systems.\n\n531\n00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:16.710\nWe kind of have to go a little bit above,\nor maybe, hey, you know what?\n\n532\n00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:21.027\nOnce this thing gets above five,\nI wanna fire up that baseline,\n\n533\n00:27:21.027 --> 00:27:24.860\nright, capture those same counters\nagain that I've got in my baseline.\n\n534\n00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:26.514\nAnd now I can go back and\ncompare, all right.\n\n535\n00:27:26.514 --> 00:27:30.055\nSo, you can either log an entry, or\nstart a particular data collector set.\n\n536\n00:27:30.055 --> 00:27:34.460\nYou do have to have the data collector\nset created ahead of time for this.\n\n537\n00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.710\nAnd in the Alert task, same kinda thing.\n\n538\n00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:39.480\nRun this task when an alert is triggered.\n\n539\n00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.558\nSo maybe you wanna get creative.\n\n540\n00:27:40.558 --> 00:27:43.661\nMaybe you wanna create a script\nthat sends out an email or\n\n541\n00:27:43.661 --> 00:27:47.080\nit pops up a message box on the server or\nsomething like that.\n\n542\n00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:50.630\nAgain, not a lot of pre-built\nfunctionality into the alert, but\n\n543\n00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:54.120\nthey give you room to work if\nyou know what you're doing.\n\n544\n00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:57.170\nSo figure out the best way\nhow you want to work that.\n\n545\n00:27:57.170 --> 00:28:01.742\nI'm just gonna click OK, and\nnow I'm going to start up my\n\n546\n00:28:01.742 --> 00:28:05.950\nperformance alert.\n\n547\n00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:06.760\nWe'll start it up.\n\n548\n00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:08.340\nAgain, normally that would be scheduled.\n\n549\n00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:11.440\nI'll do a couple things to\nmake sure we spike above.\n\n550\n00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.690\nAnd I can come over here to\nmy real-time monitoring, and\n\n551\n00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:19.730\nI can see I'm definitely above 5%, so\nit should be creating some kind of alert.\n\n552\n00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:22.030\nBut notice nothing's\nhappening on my screen.\n\n553\n00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:25.190\nI didn't set anything up, didn't create\nany scripts or anything like that.\n\n554\n00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:27.612\n>> No bells or whistles or\nalarms going off, right.\n\n555\n00:28:27.612 --> 00:28:29.205\n>> [LAUGH] Nope, nope, none of that.\n\n556\n00:28:29.205 --> 00:28:31.560\nSo, now I'm gonna go ahead and\nstop this guy,\n\n557\n00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.820\njust cuz I don't want\nit running on forever.\n\n558\n00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:34.990\nAnd, we'll go take a look.\n\n559\n00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:37.138\nNow, remember what it said, it said.\n\n560\n00:28:37.138 --> 00:28:39.260\nHuh, I'm sorry, you know something?\n\n561\n00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.160\nThere's an exception come in here.\n\n562\n00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:44.500\nIt said it was gonna log\nsomething to the application log.\n\n563\n00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.942\nSo I'm gonna open up Windows logs,\nlook up application log, and\n\n564\n00:28:47.942 --> 00:28:51.713\nI'll see that I do not have anything\ncoming from performance monitor.\n\n565\n00:28:51.713 --> 00:28:53.014\nSo Microsoft is lying to you.\n\n566\n00:28:53.014 --> 00:28:55.755\n>> [LAUGH] Shame, Microsoft.\n\n567\n00:28:55.755 --> 00:28:56.674\n>> Yeah, I know, right.\n\n568\n00:28:56.674 --> 00:28:59.447\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's actually a known bug, and for\n\n569\n00:28:59.447 --> 00:29:03.450\nsome reason it does not actually\nhit the application log.\n\n570\n00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:05.230\nSo, Michael, what the heck good is it?\n\n571\n00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:07.990\nYou just have to know where to look,\nand that's why I'm here.\n\n572\n00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:10.350\nI'm gonna expand out application services,\n\n573\n00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:14.560\nI'm gonna expand out Microsoft,\nexpand out Windows.\n\n574\n00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.660\nAnd this is just one you have to know, so\n\n575\n00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:19.110\nwrite this down if you\nwanna use it in the future.\n\n576\n00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:23.720\nDiagnosis PLA, a performance log alert.\n\n577\n00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:26.980\nPLA, performance log alert operational.\n\n578\n00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:31.550\nAnd there is my,\nthese are the ones I'm looking for.\n\n579\n00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:34.675\nThis last one, data collector\nset processor alert stop, right?\n\n580\n00:29:34.675 --> 00:29:36.414\nThat was cuz I manually stopped it.\n\n581\n00:29:36.414 --> 00:29:38.929\nBefore that I'll say look,\nperformance counter,\n\n582\n00:29:38.929 --> 00:29:42.070\npercent processor time has\ntripped its alert threshold.\n\n583\n00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:47.160\nThe counter value of six point something\nis over the limit value of five.\n\n584\n00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:51.200\nRight, so there it is,\nthe processor went above 5% and\n\n585\n00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:53.500\nit logged an entry in\nthe event log system.\n\n586\n00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.010\nAnd that's what you do with alerts.\n\n587\n00:29:55.010 --> 00:30:00.100\nIt gives me the ability to monitor this\nstuff without having to sit there and\n\n588\n00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.170\nmanually watch it the whole day.\n\n589\n00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:06.020\nAnd you can do really cool things like,\nmaybe you wanna do percent disk space or\n\n590\n00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:08.340\nfree disk space on one\nof your file servers.\n\n591\n00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:10.400\nThe one that everybody's folders\nare getting redirected to,\n\n592\n00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.860\nyou need to know when\nthat gets down to 10%.\n\n593\n00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:14.630\nI don't remember to check it every day,\nright?\n\n594\n00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:17.301\nWell, I could have an alert\nset up that says hey,\n\n595\n00:30:17.301 --> 00:30:21.939\nif that disk ever gets below 10% free disk\nspace, [SOUND] give me an alert, right?\n\n596\n00:30:21.939 --> 00:30:26.402\nAnd then we can figure out a way to\nmake that alert a little more useful by\n\n597\n00:30:26.402 --> 00:30:30.940\nattaching tasks to that event,\nwriting scripts, things like that.\n\n598\n00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:34.020\nBut for this exam, for this part,\nthis is what we need to know.\n\n599\n00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:37.410\nWe need to know how to create\nthose performance alerts, and\n\n600\n00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:38.450\nthey're very, very helpful.\n\n601\n00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:39.310\n>> Yes, they are.\n\n602\n00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:40.270\nMike, that was great.\n\n603\n00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:42.680\nAll of those demonstrations are very,\nvery helpful.\n\n604\n00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:46.700\nLike you just said,\nneeding to know when and where and how and\n\n605\n00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:52.050\nwhy these servers start going crazy on us\nis very, very important, as we've seen.\n\n606\n00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:56.330\nI can have that specific time stamp\nusing that alert process, go in and\n\n607\n00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:59.460\nfind out when exactly\ndid the problem occur.\n\n608\n00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:03.734\nAnd from there I can pull up my reports\nand take a look and see what was running.\n\n609\n00:31:03.734 --> 00:31:05.814\nMaybe there's my culprit right there, and\n\n610\n00:31:05.814 --> 00:31:09.429\nnow we can start the troubleshooting\nprocess, and we're off to the races.\n\n611\n00:31:09.429 --> 00:31:12.715\nMike, is there anything else we need\nto know about performance monitor or\n\n612\n00:31:12.715 --> 00:31:14.080\nalerts and things like that?\n\n613\n00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.760\n>> I would say, get in there and\nplay with them.\n\n614\n00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:18.810\nGo check out our lab machines, play\naround with these things a little bit.\n\n615\n00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:22.050\nRemember that one caveat that even\nthough it's gonna tell you that\n\n616\n00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:26.590\nit goes to the application log,\nwhen you set up those performance alerts,\n\n617\n00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:31.280\ncheck that diagnosis PLA,\nburied down underneath the Microsoft logs.\n\n618\n00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:34.920\nPay attention to what's real-time\nversus historical, right?\n\n619\n00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:39.011\nMost of the those tools we talked about\nwere real-time monitoring, task manager,\n\n620\n00:31:39.011 --> 00:31:42.470\nresource monitor and\nthat first part of performance monitor.\n\n621\n00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:45.380\nAnd if, on the exam, they're asking\nyou questions like, you need\n\n622\n00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:49.220\nto save this performance information,\nthere's only one place to do that.\n\n623\n00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:50.790\nThat's those data collector sets.\n\n624\n00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:52.770\nThe others, all real-time.\n\n625\n00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:53.400\n>> Awesome.\n\n626\n00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.860\nWell, Mike, it looks like we've\nwrapped up yet another great episode.\n\n627\n00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:57.490\nThanks for those demonstrations.\n\n628\n00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:58.980\nWe thank you guys for watching.\n\n629\n00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:02.280\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n630\n00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.128\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n631\n00:32:04.128 --> 00:32:10.670\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTv.\n\n3\n00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.050\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n4\n00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.767\nJoining me today is none other than,\nwell, it's Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:20.767 --> 00:00:21.611\nHow's it going today, Mike?\n\n6\n00:00:21.611 --> 00:00:24.550\n>> It's going great, Daniel,\nI'm excited as always to be here.\n\n7\n00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.646\nWe've got more of our MTA\ncontent coming your way, and\n\n8\n00:00:27.646 --> 00:00:31.095\nthis one we're gonna be focusing\nin on the start up process.\n\n9\n00:00:31.095 --> 00:00:34.578\nOne of the most exciting things you'll\never see In the world of servers.\n\n10\n00:00:34.578 --> 00:00:35.368\n>> I'm riveted.\n\n11\n00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:41.040\n[LAUGH] I'm beside myself with\nexcitement on this Mike [LAUGH].\n\n12\n00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.530\n>> Well try to contain yourself Daniel,\nand\n\n13\n00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.190\nlet's see if we can get\nthrough this episode here.\n\n14\n00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.790\nHonestly it's not the most exciting thing,\nbut it's a very important thing.\n\n15\n00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.342\nWe understand that, that start up process,\nwe might have to troubleshoot that and\n\n16\n00:00:53.342 --> 00:00:55.486\nI'm gonna throw a couple\nof other things in here.\n\n17\n00:00:55.486 --> 00:00:59.910\nOne of the things that I think is\nvery useful is being able to get into\n\n18\n00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.812\nSafe Mode or Directory Services Repair\nMode on your domain controllers.\n\n19\n00:01:04.812 --> 00:01:09.520\nEspecially when they're virtual or you're\ndoing it remotely, which can be tricky.\n\n20\n00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.480\nSo we'll take a look\nat doing that as well.\n\n21\n00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.250\nSo we'll just start off basically\ntalking about the boot process and\n\n22\n00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.110\nas we go through these\nsteps we might define\n\n23\n00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.940\na couple of these terms that\nwe need to be familiar with.\n\n24\n00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.379\nBecause the boot process has changed,\nright?\n\n25\n00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:27.875\nWe're starting with, gosh dang,\nI wanna say it was 2008 and\n\n26\n00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:31.637\nWindows Vista when this\nreally started to change, and\n\n27\n00:01:31.637 --> 00:01:35.263\nwe used to use something\ncalled the boot.ini file.\n\n28\n00:01:35.263 --> 00:01:40.297\nAnd the boot.ini file was where a lot\nof those configurations were read from,\n\n29\n00:01:40.297 --> 00:01:43.360\nduring that boot process and\nthat's changed.\n\n30\n00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.201\nNow we're using the BCD,\nthe boot configuration database, and\n\n31\n00:01:48.201 --> 00:01:50.054\nNT loader has gone away.\n\n32\n00:01:50.054 --> 00:01:54.070\nSomething that if you have been in\ncomputers for any length of time,\n\n33\n00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.932\nyou were familiar with NT loader that was\nthe initial software that was loaded up,\n\n34\n00:01:58.932 --> 00:02:03.630\nthat started up the whole boot\nprocess right after post, that's gone.\n\n35\n00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.458\nAnd they've actually broken that down\ninto a couple of different pieces which\n\n36\n00:02:07.458 --> 00:02:09.667\nwe'll talk about here\nas we go through that.\n\n37\n00:02:09.667 --> 00:02:13.150\nSo, let's talk about\nthe basic boot process.\n\n38\n00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.620\nThat system is gonna be powered on.\n\n39\n00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.290\nSo, you walk in there and\nyou hit the power button on that server.\n\n40\n00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.450\nEverything starts to light up and you hear\nthe fans whir up, all that fun stuff.\n\n41\n00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.664\nAnd then, CMOS, which is, Daniel, you know\nthat acronym better than I do, what is it?\n\n42\n00:02:28.664 --> 00:02:30.050\n>> Yes [LAUGH].\n>> It's semi metal something or other?\n\n43\n00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.232\n>> It is the complementary\nmetal-oxide semiconductor.\n\n44\n00:02:33.232 --> 00:02:35.494\nDon't ask me how I remembered that.\n\n45\n00:02:35.494 --> 00:02:37.380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It is just one of those things that\n\n46\n00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.230\nstuck in my brain like glue.\n\n47\n00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.653\nBut yeah, the old CMOS, it takes over and\nthen it moves things along.\n\n48\n00:02:42.653 --> 00:02:45.670\n>> It does,\nCMOS is gonna actually load up the BIOS.\n\n49\n00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.060\nAnd our BIOS is that firmware that\nbasically gives us that low level or\n\n50\n00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.690\nstarts the system up and runs it through\nwhat we call POST, or power-on self-test.\n\n51\n00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.632\nNow BIOS is the old way of doing things,\nstill used.\n\n52\n00:03:00.632 --> 00:03:05.891\nUEFI is the newer version of the firmware\nbut that really doesn't kick in,\n\n53\n00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:10.160\nreally more towards 2012\nserver we're gonna see that.\n\n54\n00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.710\nSo for this exam 2008, we can primarily\nfocus on BIOS, basic input output system.\n\n55\n00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.710\nSo, the CMOS loads up BIOS and\nit runs POST, or that power-on self-test.\n\n56\n00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.241\nAnd POST, again power-on self-test,\nthat's where it's loading up some,\n\n57\n00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:27.144\nit's checking everything out.\n\n58\n00:03:27.144 --> 00:03:28.739\nIt's checking the hardware,\n\n59\n00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.590\nit's making sure that everything is ready\nto be handed over to the operating system.\n\n60\n00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.860\nSo, it's gonna verify things\nlike the CPU registers,\n\n61\n00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.750\nthe integrity of the BIOS code itself,\nsome of the basic stuff that we need.\n\n62\n00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.994\nThe DMA, my direct memory access,\nthe interrupt controllers, my IRQs.\n\n63\n00:03:46.994 --> 00:03:51.672\nIt's gonna look at the memory and\nsee how much we have.\n\n64\n00:03:51.672 --> 00:03:58.050\nIt's gotta find it, see how much memory we\nhave available to use on this system and\n\n65\n00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:03.540\nthen it starts passing off control over to\nother systems to continue that process.\n\n66\n00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.593\nAnd we're probably familiar with this\nif you've rebooted any machine, right?\n\n67\n00:04:08.593 --> 00:04:12.401\nAny Windows machine since,\ngosh, way back when, right?\n\n68\n00:04:12.401 --> 00:04:13.426\nYou turn that thing on,\n\n69\n00:04:13.426 --> 00:04:16.310\nyou see all those characters\nscrolling across your black screen.\n\n70\n00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.073\nThis is before the operating\nsystem loads up.\n\n71\n00:04:19.073 --> 00:04:22.366\nAnd this is just BIOS pulling it off\nof those firmware on your motherboard.\n\n72\n00:04:22.366 --> 00:04:27.220\nIt's going through all those tests and\nat the end, you get that beep, right?\n\n73\n00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.360\nThat single beep code,\nwhich means POST completed successfully.\n\n74\n00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.360\nAnd then the boot process can move on.\n\n75\n00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.532\nNow we start hearing other beep codes,\nbeep, beep, beep.\n\n76\n00:04:37.532 --> 00:04:39.276\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Sounds like some kind of\n\n77\n00:04:39.276 --> 00:04:40.010\nlittle robot here.\n\n78\n00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.720\nI'm not gonna give you all\nthe different beep codes.\n\n79\n00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.849\nWell there's beep beep,\nbeep, beep, beep, beep.\n\n80\n00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:46.845\nAnd then there's also beep beep,\nbeep, beep.\n\n81\n00:04:46.845 --> 00:04:48.109\n[LAUGH] We won't do that.\n\n82\n00:04:48.109 --> 00:04:49.730\n>> [LAUGH] You don't want to\nhear the beep beep, beep beep.\n\n83\n00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:50.818\nThat's the worst one ever.\n\n84\n00:04:50.818 --> 00:04:51.841\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's bad,\n\n85\n00:04:51.841 --> 00:04:53.595\ncover your children's ears\nwhen you get that one.\n\n86\n00:04:53.595 --> 00:04:57.250\nCuz what it's telling you is, no.\n\n87\n00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.470\nThere are some other codes.\n\n88\n00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.135\nThey're gonna be specific to\nthe motherboard and the vendor.\n\n89\n00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:07.310\nSo you'd have to go look at their site to\nsee what those different POST codes mean.\n\n90\n00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.940\nBut they'll indicate things like hey,\nI can't find the processor.\n\n91\n00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.574\nWe're not gonna get too much further\nif BIOS can't find that processor.\n\n92\n00:05:14.574 --> 00:05:18.520\nOr if it doesn't find memory or\nanything like that.\n\n93\n00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.600\nThat's when you'll start getting\nsome of those POST code errors.\n\n94\n00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.580\nBut, normally we get a single beep\nmeaning all the hardware checked out and\n\n95\n00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.150\nwe can continue that boot process, right?\n\n96\n00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.170\nThen what it's gonna do, BIOS is\ngonna look for what's called the MBR,\n\n97\n00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.390\nor the Master Boot Record.\n\n98\n00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.010\nAnd this is typically, it's going to be,\nI shouldn't say typically,\n\n99\n00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.170\nit is going to be the first sector on\nthat hard drive, that very first spot.\n\n100\n00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.488\nSo as soon as it goes to\naccess the hard drive,\n\n101\n00:05:46.488 --> 00:05:50.032\nthat very first thing it sees is that MBR,\nor the Master Boot Record.\n\n102\n00:05:50.032 --> 00:05:54.939\nAnd in there that's where we're keeping\ntrack of those partitions that exist on\n\n103\n00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:56.340\nthat hard drive.\n\n104\n00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.780\nAnd you might have several\nhard drives on that machine.\n\n105\n00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.533\nAnd it'll look at all the different MBRs.\n\n106\n00:06:00.533 --> 00:06:03.748\nAnd what it's looking for\nis that active partition,\n\n107\n00:06:03.748 --> 00:06:05.898\nthe one that set to boot to, right?\n\n108\n00:06:05.898 --> 00:06:10.074\nAnd that MBR is gonna\ntell it where that is,\n\n109\n00:06:10.074 --> 00:06:16.686\nit's gonna locate the boot sector and\nthen it's gonna hand control\n\n110\n00:06:16.686 --> 00:06:21.790\nover to what's known as BOOTMGR,\nor Boot Manager.\n\n111\n00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.290\nThe Windows Boot Manager, all right?\n\n112\n00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:29.380\nThis is where NT loader used to take over.\n\n113\n00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.940\nYou'd go through your POST,\nBIOS would then tead out that MBR,\n\n114\n00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.380\nhand over control to NT loader.\n\n115\n00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.930\nNowadays, it's gonna go over\nthe Windows Boot Manager.\n\n116\n00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.331\nAnd this is a windows application, but\n\n117\n00:06:42.331 --> 00:06:45.696\nit's independent from\nthe operating system itself.\n\n118\n00:06:45.696 --> 00:06:48.950\nIt's not part of the OS installation.\n\n119\n00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.060\nLet's clear that up,\nit is written when you install windows.\n\n120\n00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.424\nBut it's not part of the Windows operating\nsystem that's being loaded up, right?\n\n121\n00:06:58.424 --> 00:07:01.500\nYou could have multiple\noperating systems on that drive\n\n122\n00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.140\nthat we could choose to boot to.\n\n123\n00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.176\nBoot Manager is independent\nfrom those operating systems,\n\n124\n00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:07.669\nit operates independently.\n\n125\n00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:13.228\nAnd then what it's gonna do is\nit's going to, with Boot Manager,\n\n126\n00:07:13.228 --> 00:07:17.512\nit's gonna look for,\nwhat's a good way to say it.\n\n127\n00:07:17.512 --> 00:07:20.095\nIt's gonna look for\nthat active partition, and\n\n128\n00:07:20.095 --> 00:07:23.564\nit's gonna hand things over to\nwhat we call Windows Boot Loader.\n\n129\n00:07:23.564 --> 00:07:29.101\nIt's winload.exe, and let me tell\nyou Boot Manager is bootmgr.exe.\n\n130\n00:07:29.101 --> 00:07:31.423\nIt's gonna the control\nover to boot loader.\n\n131\n00:07:31.423 --> 00:07:34.996\nOnce it figures out what partition we are\nbooting into, what the operating system\n\n132\n00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:37.867\nwe're gonna load up is,\nit's gonna hand it over to boot loader.\n\n133\n00:07:37.867 --> 00:07:42.827\nBoot loader or that winload is\npart of the operating system.\n\n134\n00:07:42.827 --> 00:07:46.584\nSo each partition that had\nan operating system would have a copy,\n\n135\n00:07:46.584 --> 00:07:48.989\nor it's own version of that boot loader.\n\n136\n00:07:48.989 --> 00:07:53.203\nAnd boot loader is what's gonna load\nthe specific version of Windows.\n\n137\n00:07:53.203 --> 00:07:57.893\nSo again if we had that multi-boot\nenvironment, and then it's gonna load up\n\n138\n00:07:57.893 --> 00:08:02.598\nthe system kernel and it's gonna begin\nto boot the critical device drivers.\n\n139\n00:08:02.598 --> 00:08:06.932\nSo the stuff that we need to load up\nthat operating system, hard drives,\n\n140\n00:08:06.932 --> 00:08:11.695\nnetwork adapters, things like that,\nit starts loading up all those drivers so\n\n141\n00:08:11.695 --> 00:08:15.988\nthat operating system can now begin\nto start accessing that hardware.\n\n142\n00:08:15.988 --> 00:08:22.210\nNow, if, what's a good way to say this,\nwe can do hibernation,\n\n143\n00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:26.940\nwe can shut these machines down, they can\ngo into that hibernation when we turn them\n\n144\n00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.290\nback on or we wiggle the mouse\nthey come right back up.\n\n145\n00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:35.640\nIn that case before restarting this\nsystem that's coming out of hibernation,\n\n146\n00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.570\nboot manager, instead of handing\ncontrol over to winloader,\n\n147\n00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:42.460\nis gonna hand control to winresume.exe.\n\n148\n00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.520\nAnd when resume looks for\nthat hiberfil.sys,\n\n149\n00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:50.730\nbecause instead of starting this\nthe operating system up from scratch,\n\n150\n00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:54.820\nfrom the beginning,\nwe're now resuming a saved state.\n\n151\n00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.149\nSo all of that is stored\nin that hyperfile.sys,\n\n152\n00:08:58.149 --> 00:09:02.410\nand the winresume is gonna be\nresponsible for loading that up.\n\n153\n00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:09.580\nSo again,\nbasically post is gonna occur and\n\n154\n00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:14.990\nthen you're gonna have your, it's gonna\nhand over control to the boot manager,\n\n155\n00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:16.470\nit's gonna look for that active partition.\n\n156\n00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:20.520\nIt's then gonna hand that\ncontrol over to Bootloader, or\n\n157\n00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.200\nsorry, Winloader which is gonna\nload up that operating system.\n\n158\n00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.460\nLow handover controls with\nthe Windows kernel itself, and\n\n159\n00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.160\nthen we get our operating system.\n\n160\n00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.030\nSo not a very complex process,\nit's a few steps that are involved.\n\n161\n00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:38.070\nAs far as troubleshooting goes, it is\nimportant that we understand these steps.\n\n162\n00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:41.590\nAs far as what we do if\nsomething is going wrong?\n\n163\n00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:43.230\nWell, there's not a lot.\n\n164\n00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:47.370\nWe can reinstall our operating system,\ntry to replace some of those system files.\n\n165\n00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:49.230\nWe can do a repair.\n\n166\n00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:50.860\nRepair is probably your first and\n\n167\n00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:55.470\nbest option, because we can try to\nrepair some of those start-up files.\n\n168\n00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.030\nSometimes master boot record gets corrupt.\n\n169\n00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:00.040\nWe might have to go in and rebuild that.\n\n170\n00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:06.240\nBut that's about all I can really\nthink of there for that boot process.\n\n171\n00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.540\nSo in the exam objectives,\nthey're gonna call it things like BIOS, so\n\n172\n00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:14.280\nbe familiar with what that BIOS is,\nbasic input/output system.\n\n173\n00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:19.340\nThat's what begins that initial\nboot process loaded up by CMOS.\n\n174\n00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.050\nUnderstand what the boot sector is.\n\n175\n00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:27.700\nThe boot sector is that first\nsection that has that the MBR in it.\n\n176\n00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:32.160\nThe MBR is that master boot record where\nall the information about the partitions,\n\n177\n00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.420\nand specifically which ones are active or\nbootable is located in there.\n\n178\n00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:41.900\nYou've got that Bootloader and\nyou've got boot manager and Winloader.\n\n179\n00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.550\nThey say Bootloader in the objectives.\n\n180\n00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:50.600\nIt's actually called Winload or Winloader\nis what they're referring to there so\n\n181\n00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.160\nmake sure that we're familiar with that.\n\n182\n00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.320\nSo that Daniel is the boot\nprocess in a nutshell.\n\n183\n00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.280\n>> Yeah it really seems like what happens\nis that the system is actually saying,\n\n184\n00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:04.320\nokay I've got this one set of systems\nthat fires off this particular thing\n\n185\n00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.750\nthat gets the computer ready.\n\n186\n00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:10.840\nSo we have the, my goodness,\nI'm starting off here, let me take a look.\n\n187\n00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.060\nYou fire off the computer and\npost happens.\n\n188\n00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.990\nIt says, let me check the system,\nmake sure everything looks good,\n\n189\n00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:17.430\nall the hardware is there.\n\n190\n00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:19.240\nAnd like Mike said,\nif anything goes wrong with the hardware,\n\n191\n00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.760\npost is gonna help you out with that.\n\n192\n00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:24.800\nNow we did come from a time where post\nbeep codes were very, very popular, but\n\n193\n00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.740\nnow a days they actually\nuse a lot of LEDs,\n\n194\n00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:32.340\nlike they light up certain numbers on the\nfront panel or maybe on the back panel.\n\n195\n00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.680\nThere's some light systems and\ndue to those light systems you can see,\n\n196\n00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:39.170\nokay if this string of lights is lit\nup then I know that this is my error.\n\n197\n00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:43.510\nIt's the same concept as the beep codes we\njust don't get an audible tone maybe other\n\n198\n00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:47.980\nthan the success of that single beep\nletting you know everything's good.\n\n199\n00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:51.990\nBut if you're missing a hard drive or a\nhard drive fails cuz if we want that code\n\n200\n00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:54.970\nto show up, we wanna hear that\naudible tone to let me know, you know,\n\n201\n00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.850\nthat beep beep beep, or something,\nwhatever, you're gonna let me know.\n\n202\n00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:01.040\nThat, hey, I've got an issue here and\nit's a hardware issue.\n\n203\n00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:05.270\nI'm not seeing the same hardware that\nI did the last time I booted up.\n\n204\n00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:08.490\nSo it gets through that, and\nthen the next thing builds on top of that.\n\n205\n00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.980\nBIOS comes in, CMOS loads your BIOS and\n\n206\n00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:14.460\nsays, here's how the hardware\nshould be interacting.\n\n207\n00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:19.710\nWell with this low sub system and\nnow that it's ready I can shovel that over\n\n208\n00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:23.720\nto the NBR, NBR looks for an operating\nsystem, finds it on the partition.\n\n209\n00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:28.200\nOh there it is and off it goes with\nthe operating system loading files.\n\n210\n00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.100\nAnd it just continues to build\none system on top of the other\n\n211\n00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:36.160\nmaking sure the computers are now,\nthis is all happening at a very fast pace.\n\n212\n00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.020\nI mean, computers,\nsome of them are kind of slow,\n\n213\n00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:41.170\nbut if you really think about it,\nthis is a really quick process.\n\n214\n00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:42.120\n>> Oh, absolutely.\n\n215\n00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.180\nA few seconds to and\nit's definitely under a minute.\n\n216\n00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.420\nIf it's longer than that,\nwe got a problem.\n\n217\n00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:48.840\n>> Or you got a old computer.\n\n218\n00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.229\n>> Yeah, a really old computer, yeah.\n\n219\n00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:55.760\nSo the next thing I really want to focus\non is getting into Safe Mode because,\n\n220\n00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.580\nif we're having trouble booting\na lot of times what can happen,\n\n221\n00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:01.200\nremember we're loading up\nsome of those drivers.\n\n222\n00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.390\nWhen we get into Winloader it's loading\nup the critical drivers for the operating\n\n223\n00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:08.000\nsystem and then as the operating\nsystem takes over it starts loading up\n\n224\n00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.490\nthe additional drivers for devices\nthat we've added, things like that.\n\n225\n00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:15.250\nSometimes we can group things up,\nwe can add a driver that causes a problem.\n\n226\n00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:17.570\nAnd all of a sudden I\ncan't successfully boot,\n\n227\n00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:22.880\nI can't get into the operating system to\nsee what's going on and try to fix things.\n\n228\n00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.870\nSo we need to get into our boot options,\n\n229\n00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:30.500\nwe need to get into safe mode where we\ncan go and maybe do a driver rollback.\n\n230\n00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.590\nYou know we can use things like\nI'm sure we've learned in A+.\n\n231\n00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:38.490\nWe can do things like our last known\ngood is a boot option that we can choose\n\n232\n00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:43.200\nto rollback to the last time\nthe system successfully booted but\n\n233\n00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:49.430\nSafe Mode, Safe Mode is a way to start\nthe system with only known good drivers.\n\n234\n00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:52.100\nInstead of looking at all\nthe drivers that we've installed for\n\n235\n00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:57.420\nall the different devices, and Windows\nhas a lot of drivers built in to it and\n\n236\n00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:01.650\nthey've got their driver store or\ntheir driver cab file.\n\n237\n00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:04.510\nAnd most devices, Windows can\nfigure out how to talk to them.\n\n238\n00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:06.480\nMight not be the ideal driver to use.\n\n239\n00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.310\nYou might not get all\nthe functionality of that device.\n\n240\n00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:10.360\nBut it can use it.\n\n241\n00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.840\nWe typically,\nwe want to load up the best driver.\n\n242\n00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.740\nSo when we install hardware,\nwe get the driver from the manufacturer,\n\n243\n00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:19.200\nthe latest version and we install that.\n\n244\n00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:23.570\nIf something ever goes wrong with that\ndriver and prevents us from booting\n\n245\n00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:27.150\nwe can get into safe mode and\nwe can try to roll back that driver.\n\n246\n00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.780\nWell to get into safe mode I've\ngot to start the system if you're\n\n247\n00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:34.290\ntelling me I can't boot, I can't get in\nthe system but I can get into safe mode.\n\n248\n00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.150\nWhy?\nWhy is that possible?\n\n249\n00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.990\nBecause safe mode isn't looking\nat the drivers you've installed.\n\n250\n00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:43.000\nSafe mode is only know,\nusing known good drivers from Windows, and\n\n251\n00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.870\nit's only load at what's absolutely\nnecessary to run the system.\n\n252\n00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.870\nIt's not loading up any extra stuff.\n\n253\n00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.440\nPeripherals, all that,\nyou'll lose access to\n\n254\n00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.780\nsome of those extra components that\nyou might have added to that system.\n\n255\n00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:58.680\nIt's just trying to get the system up and\nrunning so you can log in and fix things.\n\n256\n00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:04.640\nTroubleshooting tip that I've always used,\nif I can't boot my system normally but\n\n257\n00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.310\nI can boot into Safe Mode\nit's probably a driver issue.\n\n258\n00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:12.110\nBecause that's the big difference between\nsafe mode and normal boot is the drivers\n\n259\n00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:15.040\nthat it's loading up there and\nthe services that it's starting.\n\n260\n00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.200\nThat's another thing that's\ndifferent with safe mode.\n\n261\n00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.860\nIt doesn't start any additional services.\n\n262\n00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:23.620\nJust what is absolutely\nnecessary to run the system.\n\n263\n00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:27.480\nSo getting into safe mode\nis an important thing, and\n\n264\n00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.870\non domain controllers especially.\n\n265\n00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:34.450\nBecause if active directory, a domain\ncontroller is the server on your network\n\n266\n00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:36.700\nthat's hosting a copy of active directory.\n\n267\n00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:41.210\nAnd if I need to, if active directory\nis broken, if something is wrong there.\n\n268\n00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:44.430\nI need to get into that system and\ntry to fix it.\n\n269\n00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:48.370\nBut the problem is with domain\ncontrollers there's no local accounts.\n\n270\n00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:52.603\nYou can only login to a domain controller\nwith a domain based account that's stored\n\n271\n00:15:52.603 --> 00:15:53.763\nin active directory.\n\n272\n00:15:53.763 --> 00:15:58.199\nWell if active directory is broken how\ncan I login to that domain controller?\n\n273\n00:15:58.199 --> 00:16:01.475\nBecause I can't verify my account that's\nin active directory I need to fix\n\n274\n00:16:01.475 --> 00:16:02.053\nthat right?\n\n275\n00:16:02.053 --> 00:16:05.720\nYou get stuck in this little\nloop that you can't get out of.\n\n276\n00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:09.974\nSo there's one account that's left on\na domain controller that you can use to\n\n277\n00:16:09.974 --> 00:16:10.960\nlogin locally.\n\n278\n00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.210\nI said that there's no local accounts,\nthere actually is one.\n\n279\n00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:19.250\nIt's known as the Directory Service\nRestore Mode account or the DSRM, and\n\n280\n00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:21.830\nwe can get into the active\ndirectory restore mode.\n\n281\n00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.640\nIt's basically safe mode for\ndomain control.\n\n282\n00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:29.290\nThat same thing is gonna boot up\nthe minimal drivers, minimal services, and\n\n283\n00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:30.860\nallow me to log in.\n\n284\n00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:36.990\nThis account, the password is set for\nwhen you install active directory.\n\n285\n00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:39.480\nIt's one that we never change,\nalthough we should.\n\n286\n00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.310\nI'm not saying we're supposed to do that.\n\n287\n00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:45.170\nSo usually you've got a good long,\nstrong password on this guy.\n\n288\n00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:48.330\nBut getting into that can be challenging.\n\n289\n00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:50.580\nIt depends on how you're\naccessing the system.\n\n290\n00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:55.060\nSo on my screen here,\nI've got a 2008 R2 server.\n\n291\n00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:58.460\nIt's a domain controller, so\nit's running Active Directory.\n\n292\n00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:02.870\nAnd if I wanna get into DSRM,\nmy Directory Service Restore Mode,\n\n293\n00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:06.660\nI might be trying to restore\na backup to Active Directory.\n\n294\n00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:11.300\nI might be trying to replace\na deleted object in Active Directory.\n\n295\n00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:12.640\nCould be doing several things.\n\n296\n00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.680\nThere's a couple different\nways I could get into it.\n\n297\n00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:20.250\nThrough the GUI, we can actually use\nsomething called msconfig, all right?\n\n298\n00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:24.620\nmsconfig is my system configuration,\n\n299\n00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:27.570\nand this is where I can\ncontrol my boot process.\n\n300\n00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:28.790\nYou've probably seen this.\n\n301\n00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:32.020\nThis is available on your client\noperating systems as well, so\n\n302\n00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.290\nyou might have had to\nchange your boot options.\n\n303\n00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:38.610\nPrevent a particular service from\nstarting up that was giving you trouble,\n\n304\n00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:42.290\nlooking to see what launches every\ntime you start that machine.\n\n305\n00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:44.110\nSame thing here on my server.\n\n306\n00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:49.720\nBut what I can do over here on boot\nis I can choose safe boot, all right?\n\n307\n00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.770\nAnd then I can choose\nactive directory repair,\n\n308\n00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:56.430\nwhich is that DSRM directory\nservice repair mode.\n\n309\n00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:00.510\nAnd then I can click OK,\nand then restart my system.\n\n310\n00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:05.480\nIt'll reboot,\nit'll go through this process.\n\n311\n00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.660\nShould take it a second.\n\n312\n00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:07.870\nServer 2008 R2 is pretty quick.\n\n313\n00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:11.570\nAnd when it comes back up,\nit's gonna be in that DSRM or\n\n314\n00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:13.925\nthat safe mode for active directory.\n\n315\n00:18:13.925 --> 00:18:19.470\n[COUGH] So the first part doesn't look all\nthat much different here, it's booting up.\n\n316\n00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:24.828\nEventually I'll get my log on screen,\neventually there we go.\n\n317\n00:18:24.828 --> 00:18:26.580\nAnd I'm gonna go to log in and\n\n318\n00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.340\nit remembers who I logged on as last time,\nright?\n\n319\n00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:31.790\nSo let me try to log on\nI'll type in my password.\n\n320\n00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:34.920\nIt says there are currently no log on\nservers available to service the log\n\n321\n00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.070\non request.\n\n322\n00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:37.450\nThat's cuz we're in Safe Mode, right?\n\n323\n00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:40.610\nActive Directory is one of those services\nthat it said, I'm not starting that.\n\n324\n00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:41.810\nI'm not starting anything extra,\n\n325\n00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:45.990\nI'm just starting what I need\nto physically boot this server.\n\n326\n00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:48.050\nSo Active Directory is not there.\n\n327\n00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:52.580\nThat's when I have to go\ninto that DSRM user account.\n\n328\n00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:56.810\nNow in my case it’s\ncalled administrator and\n\n329\n00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:59.150\nI’ll put in my super secret long password.\n\n330\n00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:03.520\nAnd notice I can log in, and\nthere now I’m in safe mode.\n\n331\n00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.550\nYou can see it and\nmake sure you know you’re in safe mode.\n\n332\n00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:08.800\nYou can see the graphics\naren’t nearly as good, right?\n\n333\n00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:12.180\nIt’s not loading up any\nfancy graphics drivers, and\n\n334\n00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.850\nyou can see safe mode\nplastered in the corners\n\n335\n00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:19.260\nof my window letting me know that I'm in\nsafe mode, and everything's still here.\n\n336\n00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:23.960\nBut I can now go in and\nmaybe I wanna open up a device manager and\n\n337\n00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.120\ngo and roll back a driver.\n\n338\n00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.430\nSo I can still get into the system, but\n\n339\n00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:31.230\nif we look at things like,\nwhat rolls do I have here?\n\n340\n00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:34.220\nActive Directory,\nthese guys are not running.\n\n341\n00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:37.370\nDNS is not running right now.\n\n342\n00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:40.902\nIf I tried to open up the DNS console,\nall right?\n\n343\n00:19:40.902 --> 00:19:44.440\nLet's go to Tools >\nAdministrative Tools > DNS.\n\n344\n00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:47.588\nIt doesn't even see DNS\nrunning on this server, right?\n\n345\n00:19:47.588 --> 00:19:51.260\nIf I try to say this computer,\nit says it's unavailable, right?\n\n346\n00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:55.635\nSo we're in safe mode, and\nthis is where I can try to fix whatever is\n\n347\n00:19:55.635 --> 00:20:00.110\npreventing me from successfully\nbooting this system, all right?\n\n348\n00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:01.360\nNow, to get out of this with the GUI,\n\n349\n00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.490\nyou've gotta make sure you go back and\nuncheck those options.\n\n350\n00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:12.250\nSo, I'm gonna go back into msconfig, and\nchange my boot back to normal start up.\n\n351\n00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:15.450\nMake sure, over here,\nI do not have safe mode going.\n\n352\n00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.460\nI click OK, we'll restart and\n\n353\n00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:23.950\nnow it's going to reboot back\ninto the normal WindowsServer.\n\n354\n00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:28.140\nNow, that's all well and\ngood if I can get into that GUI, and\n\n355\n00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.090\nI can make those changes.\n\n356\n00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:33.720\nBut what if I can't, what if the problem\nis I can't successfully log on?\n\n357\n00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.640\nIt gets halfway through that boot\nprocess and it tries to reboot.\n\n358\n00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.870\nBlue screens, and reboots.\n\n359\n00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:42.627\nSo I need to get in that safe mode,\nbut I can't do it through the GUI.\n\n360\n00:20:42.627 --> 00:20:47.530\nWell that's where we're gonna\ndo it from a command line.\n\n361\n00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:52.050\nAnd if I can, and\nI'm gonna do this locally.\n\n362\n00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:56.910\nNormally you would have to do this\nremotely, I'm gonna do it locally,\n\n363\n00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:59.910\nwhich is more like,\nwhat's a good example here?\n\n364\n00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:02.340\nWhen you have virtual machine, right?\n\n365\n00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:07.150\nWhen you Connect to a virtual machine\nthe Windows is already loaded up.\n\n366\n00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:12.830\nAnd if I go and just try to reboot that\nsystem, I can't hit F8 on the keyboard.\n\n367\n00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:13.960\nI'm not there at it, right?\n\n368\n00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:19.170\nI can't make a remote desktop connection\nuntil Windows is successfully loaded.\n\n369\n00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:21.530\nAnd that's when this\noption can come in handy.\n\n370\n00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:24.780\nSo let me show you here, and\nthey also call this out on the exam.\n\n371\n00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:30.180\nWe need to be familiar with this tool\nanyway, which is BCD Edit, right?\n\n372\n00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.900\nRemember, I said boot.ini is gone.\n\n373\n00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:36.840\nEverything is now stored in this\nboot configuration database.\n\n374\n00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.680\nSo let me bump up this font so\nwe can see it a little bit better.\n\n375\n00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:44.150\nChange that guy around just a wee bit.\n\n376\n00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:47.270\nI get my white text.\n\n377\n00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:55.690\nAll right and BCD Edit is how I can\nmanage that boot configuration database.\n\n378\n00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:58.290\nAnd I can see there's\ntwo entries in there.\n\n379\n00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:02.430\nI can see one for boot manager,\nright that's that process we talked about.\n\n380\n00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:06.530\nBIOS is going to start up the system,\nit's gonna go through post.\n\n381\n00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:09.800\nAnd then it hands things over\nto bootmgr or boot manager.\n\n382\n00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:13.070\nWell there it is, right there,\nthat's that boot option.\n\n383\n00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:14.810\nAnd then here's my boot loader.\n\n384\n00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:17.790\nThis is the one that's specific\nto the operating system\n\n385\n00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:21.900\nthat boot manager turns control over and\nit finds that bootable partition.\n\n386\n00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:27.930\nI can partition C right there,\nwindows, system 32 Win load.exe.\n\n387\n00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:30.440\nSo that's that bootable that's\nwhat make that partition active,\n\n388\n00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.360\nthat's what's gonna take over, right?\n\n389\n00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:38.140\nNow if I want to boot into safe mode what\nI'm going to do is I'm gonna add an entry,\n\n390\n00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:42.330\nor modify actually one of these\nentries to switch over to safe mode.\n\n391\n00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:44.760\nSo, let's see here.\n\n392\n00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:48.110\nFirst thing I really need is the GUI for\nthis.\n\n393\n00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:51.900\nSo, I'm gonna do BCD Edit\nwith a switch v for verbose.\n\n394\n00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:56.480\nAnd, you'll see I get the same information\nnow I've got this identifier up here\n\n395\n00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:00.850\nthat's GUI or\nthat is the global unique identifier for\n\n396\n00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:03.670\nthat particular entry in this table.\n\n397\n00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:07.340\nSo what I'm gonna do is\nI am going to copy that.\n\n398\n00:23:10.498 --> 00:23:12.495\nI'll mark that guy right there.\n\n399\n00:23:13.765 --> 00:23:18.365\nAnd then, I'm going to come down here,\nand say, let's see,\n\n400\n00:23:18.365 --> 00:23:19.655\nhow do we want to do this guy?\n\n401\n00:23:19.655 --> 00:23:22.610\nWe'll do a bcdedit.\n\n402\n00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:28.030\nActually, you know what, I think in\nthis one I'm not going to need that GUI.\n\n403\n00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:32.590\nIf I'm gonna modify one of these, if I had\nmultiple operating systems loaded here,\n\n404\n00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:35.810\nI would have to specify which\none I wanted to work with.\n\n405\n00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:39.730\nSince I only have that one, my default,\nI really don't need to specify.\n\n406\n00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:43.770\nSo I'm not even gonna bother doing it,\nI'm just gonna say set oops.\n\n407\n00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:51.230\nAnd it's gonna bcdedit forward slash\nset safeboot dsrepair, all right?\n\n408\n00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:57.930\nBcdedit, set, safeboot,\ndsrepair, I hit Enter.\n\n409\n00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:00.332\nNow, if we look here, all right.\n\n410\n00:24:00.332 --> 00:24:04.277\nNotice there's no safeboot entry\nin this Windows boot loader.\n\n411\n00:24:04.277 --> 00:24:08.287\nIf I do bcdedit again,\nnow you see there's a line for\n\n412\n00:24:08.287 --> 00:24:11.200\nsafe boot and it says DS repair.\n\n413\n00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:15.120\nThat's the same thing I would be\ndoing if I went into MS config and\n\n414\n00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:18.160\nchecked that little check\nmark to go into safe mode.\n\n415\n00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:25.350\nSo now when I reboot this system,\nLet's see what happens.\n\n416\n00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:27.360\nThis is another thing,\nwhat if you were on Core?\n\n417\n00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.960\nIf you were on Server Core\nyou don't get that MSConfig,\n\n418\n00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.450\nthat GUI interface, to be able to do this.\n\n419\n00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:34.550\nSo another reason you\nmight use this option.\n\n420\n00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:40.620\nI find it really handy again when I'm\nremoting into virtual machines or server.\n\n421\n00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:42.160\nAnd really they don't even\nhave to be virtual, right,\n\n422\n00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:46.720\njust remoting into a server that's in\na rack in an office across country.\n\n423\n00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.890\nI'm not there, I can't get into F8.\n\n424\n00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:53.820\nI can't do my directory service\nrestore mode remotely like that.\n\n425\n00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:55.200\nSo this is how I'm going to do it.\n\n426\n00:24:57.062 --> 00:25:01.221\nAll right, so again if I try to log\non with a domain account, it says no.\n\n427\n00:25:01.221 --> 00:25:06.758\nSo we'll do a little switch user,\nother user, and we'll do administrator.\n\n428\n00:25:08.755 --> 00:25:10.009\nI could spell that.\n\n429\n00:25:13.551 --> 00:25:15.790\nAnd type the password correctly.\n\n430\n00:25:16.859 --> 00:25:19.250\nAnd there we go, we're in the safe mode.\n\n431\n00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:22.646\nAll right, now, the one thing\nwe've gotta be careful with here,\n\n432\n00:25:22.646 --> 00:25:25.694\nwe've added an entry to our\nboot configuration database.\n\n433\n00:25:25.694 --> 00:25:28.600\nOkay, so I need to make sure I undo that.\n\n434\n00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:32.199\nSo I come in here, I fix my problem,\nI roll back my driver,\n\n435\n00:25:32.199 --> 00:25:33.820\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n436\n00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:37.418\nThen I'm going to need to pull\nup my command prompt again.\n\n437\n00:25:37.418 --> 00:25:41.750\nOnce I'm done, and you guy are seeing\nthis, I won't bother adjusting the font.\n\n438\n00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:44.828\nWell, let's not do that,\nlet's adjust that there, Daniel,\n\n439\n00:25:44.828 --> 00:25:47.110\nwe can't have them not\nseeing what I'm doing.\n\n440\n00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:50.098\nThat is why you're watching, right?\n\n441\n00:25:50.098 --> 00:25:53.090\n[LAUGH]\n>> To see things?\n\n442\n00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:55.823\n>> Yeah, it does help,\notherwise we wouldn't have cameras,\n\n443\n00:25:55.823 --> 00:25:57.280\nyou'd just have an audiobook.\n\n444\n00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:01.562\n>> [LAUGH] Welcome to\nMichael's IT Pro audio book.\n\n445\n00:26:01.562 --> 00:26:07.558\n>> All right so\nnow what we're going to do is bcdedit and\n\n446\n00:26:07.558 --> 00:26:13.710\nthis is going to be /deletevalue safeboot,\nright?\n\n447\n00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:15.380\nIn fact let's peek before we do that.\n\n448\n00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:19.780\nIf I do bcdedit, there's that\nsafe boot that's set to DSRepair.\n\n449\n00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:23.020\nSo if we add a /deletevalue and\n\n450\n00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:28.060\nnot the no slash after that one,\nit's safeboot is what I want to delete.\n\n451\n00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:31.410\nSays operation completed successfully.\n\n452\n00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:36.250\nIf I do another bcdedit, I'll see\nthat that line for safe boot is gone.\n\n453\n00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:39.217\nAnd now I'll restart the system.\n\n454\n00:26:39.217 --> 00:26:40.111\nOops.\n\n455\n00:26:43.849 --> 00:26:45.800\nAnd it's gonna boot up normally.\n\n456\n00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:49.410\nSo, couple of different ways you can\nget into safe mode with your domain\n\n457\n00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:52.070\ncontrollers, and\nreally with any server, rIght?\n\n458\n00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:53.760\nIt doesn't have to be DSRepair.\n\n459\n00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:55.610\nIt could just be safe mode.\n\n460\n00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:57.471\nBut on the main controller, it's DSRepair.\n\n461\n00:26:57.471 --> 00:27:00.803\nIt's what allows me to get in there,\nand fix Active Directory, or\n\n462\n00:27:00.803 --> 00:27:03.790\nget into that system when\nActive Directory is not working.\n\n463\n00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:05.600\nIt allows me to log on and fix things.\n\n464\n00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.320\n>> Now, Mike,\ndoes that also give us somewhere,\n\n465\n00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:11.350\nwe're booting into safe mode using this\noption here, But I noticed that we weren't\n\n466\n00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:14.880\ndoing things like, when you press\nthe FAD you're sitting on a machine.\n\n467\n00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.580\nYou're going into safe mode.\n\n468\n00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:19.690\nYou start pressing F8 as\nthe system is booting.\n\n469\n00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:23.790\nAnd once you get to those boot options, a\nlot of them will say signal to networking,\n\n470\n00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:24.870\nanother different options.\n\n471\n00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:25.867\nCan we do that as well\nin using this method?\n\n472\n00:27:25.867 --> 00:27:26.783\n>> We can.\n\n473\n00:27:26.783 --> 00:27:27.468\nAbsolutely.\n\n474\n00:27:27.468 --> 00:27:28.377\nAnd let's try it.\n\n475\n00:27:28.377 --> 00:27:32.690\nLet's see, if you were physically at the\nmachine, we saw how we could use the GUI.\n\n476\n00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:36.970\nWe saw how we could do it by\nchanging an entry in that table.\n\n477\n00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:38.500\nLet's reboot this one more time and\n\n478\n00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:41.700\nwe will see if we can do\nit the old school way.\n\n479\n00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:44.550\nWhich is still a very viable option,\nright?\n\n480\n00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:47.160\nSo I'm going to restart this system,\n\n481\n00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:51.340\nbut on servers you have to log in\nin order to restart them, right?\n\n482\n00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:53.310\nClient operating system, nobody cares,\n\n483\n00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:56.620\nthere's actually a restart button\non the log on screen, right?\n\n484\n00:27:56.620 --> 00:28:01.080\nServers, you can't just reboot them, you\nhave to have rights to reboot the server.\n\n485\n00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:04.150\nSo you have to authenticate first,\nso it can verify who you are.\n\n486\n00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:06.240\nSo now we'll go ahead and\nrestart this guy.\n\n487\n00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:10.431\nAnd I'll get my fingers ready.\n\n488\n00:28:13.519 --> 00:28:18.417\nI wanna say it's on the,\ncuz this is a VM machine.\n\n489\n00:28:18.417 --> 00:28:22.249\nIt's either F8 or F2 on this guy.\n\n490\n00:28:22.249 --> 00:28:23.120\nSee how quick I am.\n\n491\n00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:26.550\nThere we go.\n\n492\n00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:28.150\nAnd there's my Advanced Boot Options.\n\n493\n00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:31.180\nAnd because this is a domain controller,\nthere's that entry for\n\n494\n00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:36.250\nDirectory Services Restore mode, I could\nhit that, and it would do the same thing.\n\n495\n00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:39.650\nThere you can see it loading up the basic\ndrivers, going through that process.\n\n496\n00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:43.950\n>> Now, can you do this as\nwell using the bcdedit, or\n\n497\n00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:46.530\ndo you always have to have the F8 options?\n\n498\n00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:48.062\nIf you want these advanced features.\n\n499\n00:28:48.062 --> 00:28:52.901\n>> No, it's actually the same result, you\njust don't see all that stuff scrolling by\n\n500\n00:28:52.901 --> 00:28:54.700\nwhen you do the bcdedit entry.\n\n501\n00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:59.560\nBut in the end, like when I log onto here,\nit's gonna be no different.\n\n502\n00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:04.510\nSo either method you use, any one of those\nthree, will get you to the same place.\n\n503\n00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:06.788\nIt's just whichever one\nis the most convenient.\n\n504\n00:29:06.788 --> 00:29:10.440\nIf I can get into the system,\nI like using that GUI option.\n\n505\n00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.540\nIt's a check mark, right?\n\n506\n00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:13.220\nI'm already there, I'm good to go.\n\n507\n00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:20.070\nIf for some reason I can't get into\nthat and the system is local to me,\n\n508\n00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:24.320\nthen I'll just reboot it and hit F8,\nthat's the easiest way to do it.\n\n509\n00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:29.067\nIf I can't get the system to boot up\nsuccessfully, to get into the GUI to\n\n510\n00:29:29.067 --> 00:29:33.656\nchange the safe mode, and\nthe system is not local, if it's remote,\n\n511\n00:29:33.656 --> 00:29:39.230\nthen I'm probably gonna use my changing\nmy boot options through the command line.\n\n512\n00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:40.500\nModifying it that way.\n\n513\n00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.320\nSo, a couple different\nways you can go about it.\n\n514\n00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:46.320\nWhichever one you wanna use, in the end,\nyou end up in safe mode, all the same.\n\n515\n00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.280\n>> Awesome stuff.\n\n516\n00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.970\nAnd I know a lot of you might be going,\nman,\n\n517\n00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:51.500\nwhen am I ever gonna\nneed something like this?\n\n518\n00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:54.860\nTrust me, the more you work inside of\ncomputer systems, the more you're gonna\n\n519\n00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:59.710\nremotely need to do something and not have\nthose graphical options available to you.\n\n520\n00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:04.690\nSo being able to understand a, how\nthe boot process actually works, and then\n\n521\n00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:08.710\nusing the tools built within the operating\nsystem itself to take advantage of that\n\n522\n00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:12.950\nsystem so that you can troubleshoot\nan issue, or just go to the safe mode or\n\n523\n00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:15.796\nroll back a driver, something like that,\ncan be very, very helpful.\n\n524\n00:30:15.796 --> 00:30:20.330\n>> And server core is, remember, that's\nthat version of server without the GUI so\n\n525\n00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:23.190\nwe lose that handy dandy click interface.\n\n526\n00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:26.250\nThat's where that bcdedit\nreally comes into play.\n\n527\n00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:28.180\n>> That's right.\nAll right, Mike, thanks so much for\n\n528\n00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:31.000\nshowing us these cool\ndemonstrations on how to do this.\n\n529\n00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.200\nAnd thank you guys for watching.\n\n530\n00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.840\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwrap up this show.\n\n531\n00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.900\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n532\n00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:37.643\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n533\n00:30:37.643 --> 00:30:39.280\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n534\n00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:45.130\n[SOUND]\n\n",

They even show you how to setup backups using Microsoft's wbadmin utility built-in to the Windows Server operating system. Other concepts discussed are disaster recovery methods like offsite backups and cold/warm/hot sites. Also implementing Uninterruptible Power Supplies and redundancy methods like Active Directory Restore and Clustering.",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:19.349\nI'm your host Daniel Lowry,\njoining me today is none other than my\n\n4\n00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.050\ngood friend and colleague, one of\nthe smartest men I know, Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.700\nHow's it going today, Mike?\n\n6\n00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.245\n>> He doesn't know many people.\n\n7\n00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:27.200\n[LAUGH]\n>> I don't get out much.\n\n8\n00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.490\n>> I'm doing good, Daniel,\nthanks, excited to be here.\n\n9\n00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.020\nWe got our MTA content coming your way,\nand\n\n10\n00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.760\nin this episode we're gonna be\nfocused in on business continuity.\n\n11\n00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.990\nAnother one of those parts\nof managing networks,\n\n12\n00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.200\nmanaging servers,\nthat we've gotta be familiar with.\n\n13\n00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.340\nWhen we talk about business continuity,\n\n14\n00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.820\nwe are gonna throw some\ndisaster recovery in there.\n\n15\n00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.830\nBut, I wanna make sure we understand,\n\n16\n00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.980\nbusiness continuity is really dealing\nwith keeping things running, right?\n\n17\n00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.740\nIt's a little bit different from what\nwe would call disaster recovery.\n\n18\n00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.186\nYou might can call debt and\n\n19\n00:00:58.186 --> 00:01:01.630\ndisaster recovery as a subset\nof business continuity.\n\n20\n00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.930\nBut really when we look at business\ncontinuity, we're talking about known or\n\n21\n00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.200\nforseeable failures, right?\n\n22\n00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.450\nHard drives fail,\nservers fail, things like that.\n\n23\n00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.240\nAnd being able to get that business,\nkeep that business running so\n\n24\n00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.860\nthat we can continue to make money, right?\n\n25\n00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.020\nWe don't want any downtime for\n\n26\n00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.190\nthese forseeable failures\nthat we have to deal with.\n\n27\n00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.060\nSo that's really what we\nmean by business continuity.\n\n28\n00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.310\nAnd one of the first things we're\ngonna talk about is backups, right?\n\n29\n00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.530\nIt's one of those things that we should\nall be familiar with at this point, but\n\n30\n00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.440\nit is an important concept\nthat we need to discuss.\n\n31\n00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.590\nAnd that is making a backup of that data,\nbecause things are gonna happen, right?\n\n32\n00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.610\nHard drives fail.\n\n33\n00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.210\nIt's not a matter of if, it's when.\n\n34\n00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.160\nThey're mechanical devices at least,\nbefore we get into solid state, right?\n\n35\n00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.500\nWe're looking at mechanical devices that\nare spinning at 72 10,000, 15,000 rpms.\n\n36\n00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.200\nThey've got little tiny barrings in there\nthey've got a read/write head that's\n\n37\n00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.090\nfloating across the surface,\nlittle microns.\n\n38\n00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.730\nRight?\n\n39\n00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.650\nAnything could go wrong with that and\n\n40\n00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.240\nwhen that happens we lose\naccess to that information.\n\n41\n00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.710\nAnd if we don't have a good backup,\nthat's gone right?\n\n42\n00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.030\nHow do we replace that information?\n\n43\n00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.250\nAnd that can be the difference between\na business succeeding or failing.\n\n44\n00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.200\nI mean,\ndepending on the size of the failure.\n\n45\n00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.050\nIf it's just a single server,\nmaybe it's not so bad, but\n\n46\n00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.190\nthere are times where you lose a database,\na server that has a database on it.\n\n47\n00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.280\nYou don't have a backup, your business\ncould actually go out of business,\n\n48\n00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.140\nit's that serious.\n\n49\n00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.400\n>> Oh yeah, I've definitely been in\nthe middle of a critical backup situation.\n\n50\n00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.780\nI worked for an insurance company and\nwell guess what?\n\n51\n00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.360\nInsurance data is kind of important.\n\n52\n00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.670\nAnd if we lose it, well,\nthere's gonna be a problem,\n\n53\n00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.180\nthere's gonna be a lot of hell to pay to\nput it lightly, to be honest with you.\n\n54\n00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.850\nAnd I actually went through, one time,\n\n55\n00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.640\nwhere we had an entire\nSAN shelf die on us.\n\n56\n00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.150\nAnd the person that was in\ncharge of those backups were not\n\n57\n00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.860\nactually following proper\nbackup procedures.\n\n58\n00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.710\nAnd we were in a lot of hurt.\n\n59\n00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.530\nThere was a lot,\na lot of people were retiring.\n\n60\n00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.135\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because of this, you know?\n\n61\n00:03:11.135 --> 00:03:14.340\n'Cuz it was not something that\nwas looked upon very happily.\n\n62\n00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.030\nNow, luckily, there were other\npeople that had some fail back,\n\n63\n00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.730\nsome fail over that we used to regain\nall that data, and get it all back.\n\n64\n00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.160\nBut there was about two weeks of time\nwhere we were really up in the air on\n\n65\n00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.700\nwhether or not we were gonna\nretrieve these files that we had for\n\n66\n00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.870\npeople's insurance claims and\nthings like that.\n\n67\n00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.170\nAnd like I said,\nluckily we got all that stuff back.\n\n68\n00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.900\nThe system we were using actually\nhad its own built-in backup.\n\n69\n00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.575\nWe didn't know that was\nactually occurring.\n\n70\n00:03:41.575 --> 00:03:43.860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We thought our back-up system is this.\n\n71\n00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.950\nAnd when we weren't doing it\ncorrectly then that was gone.\n\n72\n00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.630\nFortunately that was there and\nwas a safety-net for us and we got to\n\n73\n00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.730\nutilize that, but if that wasn't there we\nwould've been really really in trouble.\n\n74\n00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.040\nA lot of data would've been lost and\n\n75\n00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.410\nwe wouldn't have been able\nto restore it like we did.\n\n76\n00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.170\nAnd like I said,\n\n77\n00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.165\nthere probably would have been a lot\nmore resignations [LAUGH] at that point.\n\n78\n00:04:03.165 --> 00:04:05.832\n>> [LAUGH] That's what we call an RGE.\n\n79\n00:04:05.832 --> 00:04:06.510\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n80\n00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.060\n>> A resume generating event.\n\n81\n00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.060\nAnd you do not want that to happen, right?\n\n82\n00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.520\nAll right so let's talk about backups.\n\n83\n00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.960\nFirst of all there's several backup\nprograms we can go out and get.\n\n84\n00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:22.150\nDaniel, I'm trying to think of something\nlikeBbackup Exec is one that rolls off my\n\n85\n00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.590\nhead, what else you got out there?\n\n86\n00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.650\n>> Backup Exec is probably the big dog.\n\n87\n00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.760\nIt's the large enterprise solution.\n\n88\n00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.030\nIt is a fantastic product, but\n\n89\n00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.820\nnot all of us have the wherewithal to make\nBackup Exec a reality for our networks.\n\n90\n00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.730\nNow luckily that's not a huge\ndeal if we are a smaller shop,\n\n91\n00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.490\nMicrosoft has come to our rescue.\n\n92\n00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.010\nThey hear the cries of the plight of\nthe small man out ther,e trying to make\n\n93\n00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.840\na living and have inputted a device inside\nof their system so that we can do backup.\n\n94\n00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:51.780\n>> Absolutely.\n\n95\n00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.480\nIt's called Windows Backup and I know some\nof you that have been in the field for\n\n96\n00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.970\nawhile might be really laughing at us.\n\n97\n00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.470\nSaying, what, nobody uses Windows backup.\n\n98\n00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.250\nThat's crap.\n\n99\n00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.230\nWho uses that stuff.\n\n100\n00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.240\nAnd I will admit that it's not\nan enterprise level solution.\n\n101\n00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.810\nRight?\n\n102\n00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.170\nIt doesn't do that, but It's still useful.\n\n103\n00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.480\nEven if you're running\na program like Backup Exec and\n\n104\n00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.130\nyou've got this enterprise level backup\nsolution, you still might find a need\n\n105\n00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.120\nto do a one-off backup to restore\nit into a virtual machine so\n\n106\n00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.700\nyou can do some testing,\nor something like that.\n\n107\n00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.970\nSo don't discount the Windows Server\nback-up that's built in here.\n\n108\n00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.410\nBut Microsoft knows that most\npeople don't use it as well,\n\n109\n00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.360\nit's not even installed by default.\n\n110\n00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.860\nAll right, so that's the first thing\nwe're gonna do, is we're gonna go in and\n\n111\n00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.790\nsee how we can make sure we\nhave access to Windows backup.\n\n112\n00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.830\nLet's take a look at my screen here.\n\n113\n00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:45.740\nIt's a feature.\n\n114\n00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:51.250\nRemember the difference between roles and\nfeatures isn't not much, but, no.\n\n115\n00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.130\nRoles typically provide services\nto the network, like DHCP is\n\n116\n00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:00.160\nproviding a service that other\ncomputers on the network are consuming.\n\n117\n00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.300\nFeatures typically provide functionality\nfor the server that you're installing that\n\n118\n00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.500\nfeature on, not for\nthe rest of the network.\n\n119\n00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.250\nSo Windows Server backup\ndoes fall under features.\n\n120\n00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.870\nI'm gonna go click Add Feature.\n\n121\n00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.600\nAnd then we'll scroll\ndown in our list here.\n\n122\n00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.190\nAnd we'll find my good old\nWindows server backup.\n\n123\n00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.100\nNow notice when I check that,\nI get a grey box instead of a checkmark.\n\n124\n00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.030\nAnd that's because if I expand this out,\nthere's a couple of subcategories here.\n\n125\n00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.480\nWindows server backup is the wizard.\n\n126\n00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.010\nThat's going to give\nyou that GUI interface\n\n127\n00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.900\nto the Windows Server backup features.\n\n128\n00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.060\nThere's also command line\ntools that you can install.\n\n129\n00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.600\nAnd I'll go ahead and include those.\n\n130\n00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.980\nWe'll click next and install.\n\n131\n00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.450\nAnd it shouldn't take too terribly long.\n\n132\n00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.110\nAnd, once that's finished,\nwe'll go ahead and click close.\n\n133\n00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.590\nAnd now,\nI've got my Windows Server backups.\n\n134\n00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.400\nSo if I go into my administrative tools,\nthere's my Windows Server backup.\n\n135\n00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.720\nNow, the first time you launch this, it's\ngoing to take a look at the drives you\n\n136\n00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.640\nhave, and it's going to give\nyou back some information.\n\n137\n00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.970\nIt's not going to have a lot of info.\n\n138\n00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.060\nCuz we've never done a backup before,\nright?\n\n139\n00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.670\nI just installed this.\n\n140\n00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:11.680\nSo, no back-up has been configured,\nthere's no scheduled backup,\n\n141\n00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.850\nno existing backups or anything like that.\n\n142\n00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:20.380\nWhich brings me to a good point, if we're\ngonna use this, if we're a small shop and\n\n143\n00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.640\nwe're gonna use Windows Server\nbackup as our main back up utility,\n\n144\n00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.810\nwe want to schedule this.\n\n145\n00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:28.330\nAll right?\nWe don't want to forget to take a back\n\n146\n00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:29.100\nup one night.\n\n147\n00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.890\nAll right?\nOr whatever your schedule,\n\n148\n00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:31.910\nwhatever you determine.\n\n149\n00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:37.900\nMaybe your data is so critical, if it\nchanges a lot and you can't go without,\n\n150\n00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:42.250\nif you can't reproduce those changes\neasily, you need to adjust your schedule.\n\n151\n00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.060\nRight?\nYou might back up once a night, and\n\n152\n00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:50.480\nin that case the most you could ever\nlose would be about 24 hours or so,.\n\n153\n00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.980\nIf that's okay, fine.\n\n154\n00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:56.621\nIf you can't handle, your business\ncan't survive losing that much data,\n\n155\n00:07:56.621 --> 00:07:58.373\nthen you backup every hour.\n\n156\n00:07:58.373 --> 00:08:01.277\nNow you're only gonna lose up\nto an hour's worth of data.\n\n157\n00:08:01.277 --> 00:08:04.399\nCuz you back it up,\nit's an hour til the next backup.\n\n158\n00:08:04.399 --> 00:08:06.488\nSometime between there it fails.\n\n159\n00:08:06.488 --> 00:08:10.030\nSo you lose 45 minutes worth\nof information, all right?\n\n160\n00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.430\nSo you're gonna have to determine\nwhat schedule you want.\n\n161\n00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:16.455\nIt's a pretty simple wizard,\nBackup Schedule, come in here.\n\n162\n00:08:16.455 --> 00:08:19.390\nNow I don't have any extra drives in here,\nso it's not really,\n\n163\n00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:23.070\nit's not gonna be happy with me\nabout that, but we'll make do.\n\n164\n00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:28.160\nYou can do a full server backup,\nwhich is gonna back up everything,\n\n165\n00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.520\nthe server's data,\napplications and the system state.\n\n166\n00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:37.270\nThe system state is what's gonna\nallow me to restore that server\n\n167\n00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:39.280\nback to the same configuration.\n\n168\n00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.130\nRoles that were installed,\nconfigurations, things like that.\n\n169\n00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:47.030\nThe data, obviously,\nis my data and my applications.\n\n170\n00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:52.470\nYou could do a custom backup or I can\nchoose what I want to install, right?\n\n171\n00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:53.740\nThe full server gets, like I said,\n\n172\n00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:57.150\ngets to everything,\nall the drives that exist in that system.\n\n173\n00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.630\nYou might have data drives,\nextra drives in there, it would get those.\n\n174\n00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.110\nCustom will let me pick what I want.\n\n175\n00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.040\nI would click Add Items and\n\n176\n00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.420\nthen I can see right here I can\nchoose a few different things.\n\n177\n00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.950\nI've got bare metal recovery, and\nyou'll see bare metal is gonna grab\n\n178\n00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:17.480\nall the critical volumes,\nanything that Windows needs to boot.\n\n179\n00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.980\nNow in this case, this machine, everything\nis critical, you see it checked them all.\n\n180\n00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.490\nBut if I had data drives listed down here,\n\n181\n00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:27.100\nbare metal recovery\nwouldn't include those.\n\n182\n00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.690\nSystem state, again,\n\n183\n00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:34.560\nis what gives me the ability to restore\nthat machine and its configuration, right?\n\n184\n00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.520\nI don't wanna have to install Windows and\ngo back through all the configuration and\n\n185\n00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.350\nthen restore the data.\n\n186\n00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.420\nI wanna have that included with my backup.\n\n187\n00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.820\nSo a few different options there,\nlet's say I just do a system state backup.\n\n188\n00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:50.210\nIf I do a system state backup, it's not\ngonna include, obviously, any data or\n\n189\n00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:51.390\nanything like that.\n\n190\n00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:55.370\nI'll click Next > Next, and then,\nwhen do I want to schedule it?\n\n191\n00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:58.570\nOnce a day, more than once a day?\n\n192\n00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.420\nAgain, choice is yours.\n\n193\n00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:06.252\nI'll go ahead and set this up to back up\nevery night at 1 AM, something like that.\n\n194\n00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.190\nThen I click Next, and\nthen where do I want to store the backup?\n\n195\n00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:13.310\nThis is a important thing to consider.\n\n196\n00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:17.130\nThis virtual machine has a single drive,\nI would be backing it up, and\n\n197\n00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.630\nI don't even think it's gonna let me,\nwe'll find out here.\n\n198\n00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:21.420\nI only have that C drive, so\n\n199\n00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:27.170\nif I backup the C drive to the C drive,\nit's not gonna do me much good, right?\n\n200\n00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:28.863\n>> Yeah,\nthat's kinda a silly way to operate.\n\n201\n00:10:28.863 --> 00:10:30.233\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n202\n00:10:30.233 --> 00:10:31.618\n>> I'm backing up this drive in case this\n\n203\n00:10:31.618 --> 00:10:32.276\ndrive gets lost.\n\n204\n00:10:32.276 --> 00:10:35.573\nI'm gonna put that backup on\nthe drive that might get lost.\n\n205\n00:10:35.573 --> 00:10:37.059\nYeah, I'm not seeing the logic there,\nMike.\n\n206\n00:10:37.059 --> 00:10:38.545\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n207\n00:10:38.545 --> 00:10:39.428\n>> So, not good practice.\n\n208\n00:10:39.428 --> 00:10:41.550\n>> No, definitely not all, all right?\n\n209\n00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.359\nSo, I'm not even gonna try to go\non here cuz it's gonna balk at me.\n\n210\n00:10:44.359 --> 00:10:47.428\nWhen you back up to a hard disk\nthat is dedicated for backups,\n\n211\n00:10:47.428 --> 00:10:49.004\nit's gonna format that disk.\n\n212\n00:10:49.004 --> 00:10:52.310\nSo I couldn't format the C drive anyway,\nI'm running Windows currently.\n\n213\n00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:56.990\nSo you take a drive,\nyou dedicate it to this purpose, and\n\n214\n00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.720\nthat's the only thing\nthat gets stored on it.\n\n215\n00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:03.195\nAnd that is a limitation here of that\noption, something to think about.\n\n216\n00:11:03.195 --> 00:11:07.379\nBackup to a volume if you can not\ndedicate an entire disk for backups.\n\n217\n00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:11.450\nOr back up to a shared network folder.\n\n218\n00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:14.280\nThat way I can have a map drive somewhere.\n\n219\n00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:18.640\nI have have a San that has some space on\nit that we're reaching out on a network\n\n220\n00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.180\nand accessing.\n\n221\n00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.410\nSo, a few different options there.\n\n222\n00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:24.500\nYou know what I could do is I\ncould try to fake it out here.\n\n223\n00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.940\nLet's flip over to this guy.\n\n224\n00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:31.612\nAnd real quick we'll go over here and\n\n225\n00:11:31.612 --> 00:11:36.478\nmake a share folder,\nwe'll call this Backups.\n\n226\n00:11:38.103 --> 00:11:40.680\nAnd I'm gonna share this guy out.\n\n227\n00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.132\nAnd I'm gonna use,\nthis is definitely not a best practice,\n\n228\n00:11:43.132 --> 00:11:45.180\nI'm just doing this for a demo.\n\n229\n00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:49.470\nWe're going to find, or\nI'm just gonna choose Everyone, Add, and\n\n230\n00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:51.640\ngive them read and write.\n\n231\n00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.920\nDefinitely not something I would\ndo normally with a backup, right?\n\n232\n00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.060\nYou've gotta think about that.\n\n233\n00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.960\nThink about the security of your backups.\n\n234\n00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.520\nThis is something that a lot\nof people will overlook.\n\n235\n00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.111\nThat's a backup of all your\ndata from that server.\n\n236\n00:12:03.111 --> 00:12:05.839\nIt needs to be protected just\nlike you would the data that's on\n\n237\n00:12:05.839 --> 00:12:07.100\nthe server, right?\n\n238\n00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:10.520\nBecause if I can get access to your\nbackup, I can try to take that and\n\n239\n00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.555\nrestore it somewhere.\n\n240\n00:12:11.555 --> 00:12:15.210\nAnd change permissions on it and\nget access to all that information.\n\n241\n00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:19.502\nSo I'll click Done, it's shared out,\nnow we'll flip back over here.\n\n242\n00:12:19.502 --> 00:12:22.550\nI'll say backup to\na shared network folder.\n\n243\n00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:29.100\nIt's gonna tell me, now this is\na limitation of backing up to the network,\n\n244\n00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.480\nyou can only keep one backup.\n\n245\n00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.390\nThat might be fine for\nyou if you're in a small shop.\n\n246\n00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:38.450\nMost of the time though that might not cut\nit, we want several backups that we can\n\n247\n00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:43.370\nroll back to, which is why this\nnetwork option is rarely used.\n\n248\n00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:48.667\nSo my location \\\\SVR1\\backups,\n\n249\n00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:53.240\nand then inherit permissions.\n\n250\n00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.080\nThis is where I would really need to make\nsure I set the permissions on that shared\n\n251\n00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:56.860\nfolder properly.\n\n252\n00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:01.845\nI click Next, and that's over on,\nthey give us credentials.\n\n253\n00:13:06.628 --> 00:13:10.215\nAnd Finish, and\nnow I've got my backup schedule.\n\n254\n00:13:10.215 --> 00:13:13.490\nAnd so now it's gonna run\nevery night at 1 o'clock.\n\n255\n00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:17.321\nRemember, with the option I choose it's\ngoing to overwrite the previous backup\n\n256\n00:13:17.321 --> 00:13:19.490\nwith that current backup.\n\n257\n00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:22.730\nBut honestly, like I said, in a small\nshop this is what you're gonna use.\n\n258\n00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:26.450\nIf you can't go out and\nget enterprise level backup software,\n\n259\n00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:27.810\nyou set up a schedule.\n\n260\n00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:30.970\nBut even in an enterprise,\nI've used this several times.\n\n261\n00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:33.800\nWe've got backup software we use, but\n\n262\n00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:37.140\nsometimes I just wanna make\na quick one-off backup.\n\n263\n00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.230\nOr maybe you wanna make a backup and\nstore it offsite.\n\n264\n00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:41.080\nWe're gonna talk about that in a minute.\n\n265\n00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.800\nThis is handy for that.\n\n266\n00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.660\nI can either use my scheduled backup\noptions, all those things I just set in\n\n267\n00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:50.100\nthat schedule, I can make a one-off\nbackup using those same settings.\n\n268\n00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.820\nIn other words,\nput it up there to that network location,\n\n269\n00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.290\nwhat I've chose to backup, all of that.\n\n270\n00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:56.870\nOr I can do different options.\n\n271\n00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:00.050\nAnd I could go in here and\ngo through that whole set again,\n\n272\n00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:03.330\nthose set of selections again,\nbut only for this one backup.\n\n273\n00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.650\nSo very, very handy,\nWindows Server Backup,\n\n274\n00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:09.300\nsomething that we don't want\nto forget is available.\n\n275\n00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.760\nIf that's your only backup solution,\nit's great.\n\n276\n00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.170\nThe big thing is,\nI said it's not enterprise level, right?\n\n277\n00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:17.590\nIt's backing up this one server.\n\n278\n00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:22.020\nI would need to do this same process\non every single server that I had.\n\n279\n00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:23.960\nSo if I've got one or\ntwo servers, no problem.\n\n280\n00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.605\nIf you're an enterprise\nwhere I've got dozens or\n\n281\n00:14:27.605 --> 00:14:32.572\nhundreds of servers, this is not\nthe solution for you, all right?\n\n282\n00:14:32.572 --> 00:14:36.000\nAll right, from the command line,\nit's known as wbadmin.\n\n283\n00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:41.460\nNote, just be familiar with that name,\nwbadmin is the command.\n\n284\n00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:45.080\nIf you do a /?,\nyou can get a list of instructions.\n\n285\n00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.240\nAll those options that I\nconfigured in the GUI,\n\n286\n00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.810\nI can do here through\nthe command prompt as well.\n\n287\n00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:51.707\nI can also script this.\n\n288\n00:14:51.707 --> 00:14:56.312\nAnd so if you're in a shop that's in\nbetween that small and big, and you've got\n\n289\n00:14:56.312 --> 00:15:01.018\nmaybe a half dozen servers, you don't\nwant to do this individually on each one.\n\n290\n00:15:01.018 --> 00:15:03.933\nYou could write a script and\nthen you could import that script or\n\n291\n00:15:03.933 --> 00:15:06.080\nbring that script over\nto all those machines.\n\n292\n00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.052\nAnd at least not have to go through the\nwizard and pick all those settings, right?\n\n293\n00:15:09.052 --> 00:15:09.771\n>> Yeah, that'd be nice.\n\n294\n00:15:09.771 --> 00:15:12.442\n[LAUGH] Scripting is nice\ncuz it automates our life.\n\n295\n00:15:12.442 --> 00:15:16.823\nAnd what the heck are we using computers\nfor if we're not gonna automate things and\n\n296\n00:15:16.823 --> 00:15:18.450\nmake them easier for us?\n\n297\n00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:21.520\nSo yeah,\nI'm a huge fan of scripting stuff out.\n\n298\n00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.813\nI learned that from my previous boss.\n\n299\n00:15:22.813 --> 00:15:23.839\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He's like,\n\n300\n00:15:23.839 --> 00:15:24.903\nstop doing things the hard way Daniel.\n\n301\n00:15:24.903 --> 00:15:26.389\nI’m like, but I like the hard way.\n\n302\n00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:28.990\n[LAUGH] Like no, no,\nautomation is the key.\n\n303\n00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:30.498\n>> It is, it is.\n\n304\n00:15:30.498 --> 00:15:33.830\nAll right now, the next thing we wanna\ntalk about is disaster recovery, and\n\n305\n00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:37.120\njust really some terminology\nhere that we want to go through.\n\n306\n00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:42.530\nRemember, disaster recovery is when\nbad things have happened, right.\n\n307\n00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:44.420\nI mean, your building is gone.\n\n308\n00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.530\nHere in Florida we have hurricanes, and\n\n309\n00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:49.900\nthey tend to do that if they\nget a little too close.\n\n310\n00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:53.001\nWell now my backups and things like that,\nthat's not gonna cut it.\n\n311\n00:15:53.001 --> 00:15:55.160\nI mean, I've lost my equipment.\n\n312\n00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.283\nHopefully not, but\nI mean I could be losing personnel.\n\n313\n00:15:58.283 --> 00:16:02.582\nSo, a disaster's a little bit different\nthan just doing your standard, or\n\n314\n00:16:02.582 --> 00:16:04.739\nyour normal, business continuity.\n\n315\n00:16:04.739 --> 00:16:07.920\nAll right, with disaster recovery,\ncouple things we gotta do.\n\n316\n00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.910\nOne, off site backups.\n\n317\n00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:14.890\nAnd that simply means, when I back up my\ninformation, I don't put the backup tapes,\n\n318\n00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:18.260\nor whatever I back up to,\nup on top of the server rack, right?\n\n319\n00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:19.950\nI don't keep them in the room next door.\n\n320\n00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:23.330\nBecause if my building's gone,\nI've lost those as well.\n\n321\n00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.990\nOffsite backup, something you\ndefinitely see in a larger environment.\n\n322\n00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:28.939\n>> Oh yeah, that used to be part of my\ndaily duties, to be honest with you.\n\n323\n00:16:28.939 --> 00:16:33.280\nI would go into the server room when\nwe were backing up to a tape robot.\n\n324\n00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.440\nI'd get a new tape every, actually,\nevery Monday morning I'd have a full set.\n\n325\n00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.270\nI'd take that and I'd have a metal\nbuilding that was offsite,\n\n326\n00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:43.650\nit was probably 4 or\n500 yards away from the actual building.\n\n327\n00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:47.910\nI'd walk it out there, it was a fireproof\nsafe inside of a fireproof room.\n\n328\n00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:49.775\nI say fireproof it was concrete.\n\n329\n00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:52.720\n[LAUGH] You know it was\nbolted into the floor and\n\n330\n00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.450\nonly a few people had\nthe combination to it.\n\n331\n00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:55.670\nAnd I was one of them.\n\n332\n00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:58.370\nOpen that safe up and\nI'd put those tapes in there every day.\n\n333\n00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:01.710\nAnd then I take my incrementals every\nother day and walk those out there.\n\n334\n00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:05.420\nThat way if the building got, a hurricane,\nwe live in Florida, comes in and\n\n335\n00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:10.820\nblows that thing to kingdom come, well\nthat concrete room is hurricane rated.\n\n336\n00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:14.100\nIt's ready to withstand just about\nanything Mother Nature can throw at it and\n\n337\n00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:14.845\nthe kitchen sink.\n\n338\n00:17:14.845 --> 00:17:16.360\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I can at least go in there and\n\n339\n00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.980\ngrab those backups.\n\n340\n00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:21.850\nAnd we can get some servers up and\nrunning very quickly and\n\n341\n00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:24.460\nuse those backups,\nrestore from those backups.\n\n342\n00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.990\nAnd it mitigates the amount\nof time I would be down and\n\n343\n00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:30.410\nour business would not be doing business.\n\n344\n00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:33.220\nWe can get back up and running and\nthat's why we do off-site backups,\n\n345\n00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:36.560\nit's just a great way to save yourself\na headache in case of a disaster.\n\n346\n00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.760\n>> Yeah, it's very important because\nin the event of that disaster,\n\n347\n00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.950\nand sometimes we don't think about that,\nyou've gotta plan for\n\n348\n00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:46.140\nworst case scenarios,\nis really what we're doing there.\n\n349\n00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:47.640\nAnd off site back up, as Daniel said,\n\n350\n00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:51.520\ncould be in a bomb shelter like they've\ngot out there basically [LAUGH].\n\n351\n00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.930\nTheir concrete building.\n\n352\n00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:54.840\nWe could be doing this\nto the cloud nowadays.\n\n353\n00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:58.660\nI might be backing it up through\nsome online service where,\n\n354\n00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.460\nwho knows where their server farms are?\n\n355\n00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:03.120\nA different country, even,\nwhere they're storing that data.\n\n356\n00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.130\nWe've got to worry about\nlegal requirements there,\n\n357\n00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:07.870\nbut the point is,\nthey're not even in the same town, right?\n\n358\n00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:11.900\nThey've got some server farm somewhere\nthat we're backing this stuff up to.\n\n359\n00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:15.475\nOr it could be like Daniel,\njust taking those tapes putting it in\n\n360\n00:18:15.475 --> 00:18:19.310\nthat bomb shelter, or maybe moving\nthem to maybe a multi shop site.\n\n361\n00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:22.950\nMaybe you've got a shop here in\nGainesville you've got another one\n\n362\n00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:24.770\nout in Atlanta, right?\n\n363\n00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.746\nMaybe you mail some of your backup up\nto your shop in Atlanta they send stuff\n\n364\n00:18:27.746 --> 00:18:28.280\nback to you.\n\n365\n00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:31.750\nRight, so you're basically keeping\nback ups for each other there.\n\n366\n00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:33.850\n>> Mike it could even be as simple as,\n\n367\n00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:37.610\nif you're a smaller shop, is that\nsomeone takes the tapes home with them.\n\n368\n00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:39.420\n>> Yes.\n>> And leaves them at home for the week.\n\n369\n00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.630\nThey get a new tape every morning,\nwhen they leave for\n\n370\n00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:43.950\nthe end of the day they take it with\nthem and leave it at their house.\n\n371\n00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:48.220\nIt's somewhere different than the building\nwhere the actual data is stored.\n\n372\n00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:51.520\nThat's the whole purpose of\nhaving off site backups here.\n\n373\n00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:55.000\nYou're not in the same location in\ncase something happens to that.\n\n374\n00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.190\nWe have things like tornados,\nand earthquakes, and floods, and\n\n375\n00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:00.160\nfires, and things happen all the time.\n\n376\n00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.390\nThey don't tend to happen\nat the very same location.\n\n377\n00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:06.200\nIf something happens in Gainesville,\nit's unlikely to happen in Tampa, right?\n\n378\n00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:11.160\nUnless it's a giant hurricane,\n[LAUGH] the entire state of Florida.\n\n379\n00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.090\n>> And that's something to think about,\nright?\n\n380\n00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:17.650\nWhen you're planning your offsite backups,\nwhat am I trying to protect against?\n\n381\n00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:20.780\nHere in Florida we do have hurricanes\nthat can cover hundreds of miles.\n\n382\n00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:25.110\nSo maybe my offsite store's location\nneeds to be even further than that.\n\n383\n00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:27.460\nIf you're dealing with tornadoes.\n\n384\n00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:30.770\nMaybe the destruction\nis not as widespread.\n\n385\n00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:33.700\nIt's a very narrow swath\nof destruction so,\n\n386\n00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:38.010\nyou figure if this building gets hit, that\none on the other side of town doesn't.\n\n387\n00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:41.920\nThat's just things that you've gotta think\nabout when you're planning your strategy.\n\n388\n00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.560\nOther disaster recovery methods\nthat we've gotta be familiar with\n\n389\n00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.820\nis the old cold site, warm site, hot site.\n\n390\n00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:52.220\nAnd this is just alternate locations,\nagain, disaster recovery.\n\n391\n00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.750\nMy current location is\nno longer accessible.\n\n392\n00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:56.490\nIt's gone, it's burned to the ground,\n\n393\n00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:59.595\nit's been washed away,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n394\n00:19:59.595 --> 00:20:05.130\nOff-site or a cold site,\na warm site and a hot site.\n\n395\n00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:09.330\nThese are ways that I can protect\nagainst that type of disaster.\n\n396\n00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:12.340\nWe just need to know what\nthe difference is between a cold site,\n\n397\n00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:13.950\na warm site and a hot site.\n\n398\n00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:16.080\nAnd it's all about how much\nmoney you wanna spend.\n\n399\n00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.120\nAnd how immediate you\nneed the recovery to be.\n\n400\n00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:24.080\nWhen we talk about a cold site,\na cold site is typically a location.\n\n401\n00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:28.762\nIt might be an alternate\nlocation that we can move to, but\n\n402\n00:20:28.762 --> 00:20:32.580\nin a different town, different state\nwhat have you, depending on again,\n\n403\n00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.490\nwhat our plans are, but\nthere's nothing there.\n\n404\n00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:39.250\nThere's no equipment,\nthere might not even be power hookups,\n\n405\n00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:41.900\nor network hookups, and things like that.\n\n406\n00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:46.460\nBut it's the cheapest of the three to\nset up, because it's just me leasing, or\n\n407\n00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:50.200\nhaving the availability of\nanother physical location.\n\n408\n00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:53.880\nSo pretty cheap to maintain,\nrelatively speaking.\n\n409\n00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.250\nBut it's also gonna take a lot\nlonger to do my restore.\n\n410\n00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:59.420\nI've gotta get new equipment\nshipped out from my manufacturers.\n\n411\n00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:03.370\nI've gotta get my hookups done and\nmy electric and my networking and\n\n412\n00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:05.010\nthings like that, phone lines.\n\n413\n00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:06.390\nI've gotta get all that equipment in.\n\n414\n00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:08.770\nI've gotta get personnel moved over there.\n\n415\n00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:11.250\nThen I've gotta get my backups for\nmy off site locations.\n\n416\n00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:13.170\nI gotta start restoring that data.\n\n417\n00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:16.380\nSo it's a lengthy process to go\nthrough in that recovery mode.\n\n418\n00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:21.340\nWarm site is a little bit warmer\nthan the cold site, right?\n\n419\n00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.280\nIt's gonna be a little more expensive.\n\n420\n00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:27.830\nAnd it's gonna be a little less\ntime through the recovery process.\n\n421\n00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:30.940\nBut warm sites typically have equipment.\n\n422\n00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:35.910\nThey typically have power connections,\nInternet connectivity,\n\n423\n00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:38.430\nphone lines, things like that.\n\n424\n00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:42.750\nAnd, some of my backups are being\nsent up to that warm site.\n\n425\n00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:44.780\nBut not immediately, right?\n\n426\n00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:49.460\nSo the data at that warm site might be an\nhour old, it might be a couple days old,\n\n427\n00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:53.010\nit might be a month old, depending\non what our backup strategy is and\n\n428\n00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:56.960\nhow often we're shipping those up there\nand going through that restore process.\n\n429\n00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.341\nBut in the event of a disaster,\nthe equipment's already there,\n\n430\n00:21:59.341 --> 00:22:01.300\npower's already there,\nphones are already there.\n\n431\n00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.195\nAll I've got to do is get my people up\nthere and I've got to get the latest\n\n432\n00:22:04.195 --> 00:22:07.270\nbackups and restore them and\nwe're back up and running.\n\n433\n00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:12.580\nThen you get in a hot site and a hot site\nis going to be the most expensive option.\n\n434\n00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:16.760\nBut we're talking almost\nimmediate availability.\n\n435\n00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:20.220\nA hot site has everything just like\nthe warm site, all the equipment,\n\n436\n00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:24.670\nall the connections, but we're typically\ntaking our backups or we're really, we're\n\n437\n00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:28.690\neither taking backups and immediately\nrestoring them up there in that warm site.\n\n438\n00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:30.920\nOr we're actually just replicating,\n\n439\n00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:35.220\nevery bit of our data is getting\nimmediately replicated over that hot site.\n\n440\n00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:38.010\nIn the event of a disaster,\nwe just flip a switch.\n\n441\n00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:40.410\nWe send our personnel over there,\nand we're good to go.\n\n442\n00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:41.320\nRight?\n>> Yeah, actually,\n\n443\n00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.830\nwhen we say flip a switch,\n\n444\n00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:47.820\nthe switch is virtually flipped as soon as\nthe original site is no longer responding.\n\n445\n00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:50.000\nThat's basically how a hot site works.\n\n446\n00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.525\nIt will immediately take over\nthe Internet, we'll say, hey,\n\n447\n00:22:53.525 --> 00:22:56.960\nI'm trying to get to this area,\nand it's not showing up.\n\n448\n00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.940\nAnd based off a set of rules you set up,\nit said if you can't get here,\n\n449\n00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.320\ngo here immediately.\n\n450\n00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:04.060\nAnd that's what'll happen,\nIt'll flip over to that hot site.\n\n451\n00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.340\nAgain, I have worked for a company.\n\n452\n00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.380\nWe had two hot site backups.\n\n453\n00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:09.990\nOne in the state, one out of the state.\n\n454\n00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:12.555\nJust to cover our bases, because,\nhey, that insurance information,\n\n455\n00:23:12.555 --> 00:23:13.995\npeople tend to take it a little serious.\n\n456\n00:23:13.995 --> 00:23:17.675\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, [LAUGH] there was that.\n\n457\n00:23:17.675 --> 00:23:21.055\n>> Imagine you've had a disaster yourself,\nyou call up your insurance company and\n\n458\n00:23:21.055 --> 00:23:22.450\nthey're not available.\n\n459\n00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:23.730\nThat's not gonna make for a good day.\n\n460\n00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:24.660\n>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n461\n00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:29.520\nPeople tend to get a little angry when\ntheir claims aren't getting filed.\n\n462\n00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.810\nSo, but that's what we did.\n\n463\n00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:34.660\nWe just basically, but we had to buy a lot\nof infrastructure to make that happen.\n\n464\n00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:39.437\nWe had devices that made sure that any\nchange that was made on our local network\n\n465\n00:23:39.437 --> 00:23:43.187\nwas replicated across the Internet\nthrough lease dlines and\n\n466\n00:23:43.187 --> 00:23:48.430\nWANS that we had to different hot sites,\nand that data was immediately replicated.\n\n467\n00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:51.942\nSo if we were destroyed,\nsomething happened for whatever reason,\n\n468\n00:23:51.942 --> 00:23:55.821\na gas leak and the whole place blew up,\nand it was gone Well, our end users,\n\n469\n00:23:55.821 --> 00:24:00.319\nour customers, would probably, unless they\nwere trying to access it within the first\n\n470\n00:24:00.319 --> 00:24:04.010\nfew minutes of that destruction,\nthey wouldn't even notice it.\n\n471\n00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:06.350\nAnd even if they were they'd,\noh let me try refresh.\n\n472\n00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:07.790\nOh there it is, it's back.\n\n473\n00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:12.700\nAnd never none the wiser, and we just\nhave a disaster recovery team go out and\n\n474\n00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:17.270\ntrying to rebuilt our actual site, but\nthat outside replication would be able to\n\n475\n00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:21.390\ncompletely take over in case\nof that large scale disaster.\n\n476\n00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:21.900\n>> Yeah.\n\n477\n00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:23.740\nSo obviously a very expensive solution.\n\n478\n00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:26.710\nYou've got a lot of equipment that's\nsitting there that's really not being\n\n479\n00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:30.410\nutilized fully, but\nthat's something that the higher ups,\n\n480\n00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:32.220\nthose C level people decide on.\n\n481\n00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:34.190\nHow much is it worth to us?\n\n482\n00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:36.980\nHow much would we lose\nif we didn't have this?\n\n483\n00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:41.490\nAn organization like that, that insurance\ncompany, it's well worth the money to\n\n484\n00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:45.320\nmaintain those hot sites because\nthey know if they had a disaster and\n\n485\n00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.602\ndidn't have that,\nthat could cost them their business.\n\n486\n00:24:48.602 --> 00:24:50.770\nAll right, so some other things\nwe should talk about here.\n\n487\n00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:53.910\nClustering is another business continuity.\n\n488\n00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:56.691\nIt's not really a disaster\nrecovery method, again,\n\n489\n00:24:56.691 --> 00:24:58.817\ndisaster recovery worse case scenario.\n\n490\n00:24:58.817 --> 00:25:03.475\nBusiness continuity means I want to\ncontinue on in the event of a foreseeable\n\n491\n00:25:03.475 --> 00:25:04.144\nfailure.\n\n492\n00:25:04.144 --> 00:25:08.250\nClustering is one things that we can do\nwith our Windows Server operating systems.\n\n493\n00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:10.370\nAnd I’ve got a little drawing\nhere to kind of lay it out again.\n\n494\n00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:14.060\nFor this exam, we’re not getting into\nsetting up clustering or anything like\n\n495\n00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:17.300\nthat, but we do need to understand\nthe concepts and how this is working.\n\n496\n00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:21.160\nWhat a cluster is in\na Windows Server environment,\n\n497\n00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.660\nis we're going to take multiple,\nphysical servers.\n\n498\n00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.560\nSo that's these guys that I have here, and\n\n499\n00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.610\nwe're going to install this\nfail over clustering on them.\n\n500\n00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:32.885\nThis is a roll through that we\ninstall through Windows and\n\n501\n00:25:32.885 --> 00:25:37.650\nthrough this process,\nwe're gonna create this virtual server.\n\n502\n00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:40.120\nNow be real careful with that term.\n\n503\n00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.850\nI'm not talking about\nhardware virtualization.\n\n504\n00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:46.000\nWe're not talking about Hyper-V or\nanything like that.\n\n505\n00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.270\nWhat we're saying is, to the network,\n\n506\n00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:52.620\nthis guy's gonna get an IP address that's\nunique to it, this virtual entity.\n\n507\n00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:56.500\nThese guys are all going to have physical\nIP addresses on the network, but\n\n508\n00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:01.130\nwe create this virtual entity, and that's\nwhat is visible to the network itself.\n\n509\n00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:05.600\nWhen these client machines\nare accessing whatever service it is,\n\n510\n00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.730\nthey're seeing this front end.\n\n511\n00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:12.320\nAll right, but behind the scenes they\ncan be going to any one of these.\n\n512\n00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:12.990\nAll right?\n\n513\n00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:14.960\nAnd Daniel and\nI were talking about this earlier.\n\n514\n00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:19.808\nWhen we set up a cluster in Windows, we're\ntypically doing what we call an active\n\n515\n00:26:19.808 --> 00:26:22.880\npassive cluster, it's a fail over cluster.\n\n516\n00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.390\nThere is a way to do some\nactive active clustering here.\n\n517\n00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:30.260\nBut normally with these Windows clusters,\none physical machine\n\n518\n00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:35.190\nis actually providing the role,\nis what they call the owner of the role.\n\n519\n00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:39.740\nSo you connected this guy, and\nthen it's all being redirected to here.\n\n520\n00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:44.370\nNow they all have access,\nall the nodes in this cluster,\n\n521\n00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:48.840\nhave access to the storage area network,\nor some type of shared source.\n\n522\n00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:53.170\nIt could be cluster shared\nvolumes in a Windows environment.\n\n523\n00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:56.060\nBecause they all have to have\naccess to the same data.\n\n524\n00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:59.290\nI can't have that application storing\ndata locally on this machine,\n\n525\n00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:04.130\nbecause what's gonna happen is if this guy\nfails, that role is going to immediately\n\n526\n00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:08.840\nflip over to another one of the nodes\nthat's still available in that cluster.\n\n527\n00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:12.970\nStill has access to the exact same data,\nset up properly,\n\n528\n00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:14.670\nmy end users don't lose anything.\n\n529\n00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:17.690\nThey might not even notice the fail over,\nall right?\n\n530\n00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:20.070\nAnd let me bring that guy back out here.\n\n531\n00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:22.610\nSo a couple things, again,\n\n532\n00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:27.440\nthat we need to stress about the clusters,\nit's a role that we install on Windows.\n\n533\n00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:31.790\nWe take multiple physical machines and\nwe create that virtual\n\n534\n00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:36.290\nentity that the end users\nconnect to behind the scenes,\n\n535\n00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:39.340\nmultiple physicals,\nmultiple networks going on here as well.\n\n536\n00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:44.380\nYou see what I've got in red, each one of\nthese physical servers has access to that\n\n537\n00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:46.990\nshared storage, whatever it might be.\n\n538\n00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:51.390\nWe also have a green network here,\nand this is what the nodes, and\n\n539\n00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:54.580\nthat's what these are called,\nthey're called nodes in a cluster,\n\n540\n00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:57.830\neach one of those nodes is\nconnected to each other, and\n\n541\n00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:00.700\nthat's how they can tell if\none node has failed, right?\n\n542\n00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:04.410\nIf this guys disappears, they have what's\ncalled a heartbeat that they send out.\n\n543\n00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:08.110\nIf this guy disappears for any length\nof time, these guys are gonna go,\n\n544\n00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:09.640\nwait a second, his heartbeat's not there.\n\n545\n00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:10.690\nSomething's happened.\n\n546\n00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:11.990\nI'm gonna take over.\n\n547\n00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:13.300\nNow, all of that's configurable.\n\n548\n00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:15.920\nThe way it occurs, the time it takes,\nand things like that.\n\n549\n00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.560\nWe don't have to get into it here.\n\n550\n00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:18.630\nBut I want to make sure we understand.\n\n551\n00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:21.500\nYou know, they've got a heartbeat that\nthey use to communicate with each other.\n\n552\n00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.500\nTypically, we put that\non a separate network so\n\n553\n00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:26.200\nno other traffic interferes\nwith that heartbeat.\n\n554\n00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:30.040\nI don't want one node going wait, I don't\nhear from the guy that's the owner,\n\n555\n00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.570\nI am gonna take over.\n\n556\n00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:34.030\nAnd really it was just number\ncongestion that was keeping,\n\n557\n00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:35.340\nit was delaying his heartbeat.\n\n558\n00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:40.540\nSo you've got that and then they're all,\nof course, connected to the actual LAN and\n\n559\n00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:44.090\nall of my end users or\nother systems are connected to.\n\n560\n00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:48.080\nAnd that's a cluster, that's a way\nI can provide high availability for\n\n561\n00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.520\nmission critical roles.\n\n562\n00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:53.560\nIf I've got a website and all my business\nis done through people connecting to\n\n563\n00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:56.010\nthat website, I can't have that go down.\n\n564\n00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:57.310\nI lose money for\n\n565\n00:28:57.310 --> 00:29:01.850\nevery hour that's not available, every\nminute depending on what my business is.\n\n566\n00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:03.600\nThis is the way to solve it.\n\n567\n00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:04.620\nIf that thing goes down,\n\n568\n00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:08.050\nthis guy immediately takes over,\nI don't lose any business.\n\n569\n00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:09.680\nThat's the idea behind a cluster.\n\n570\n00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:13.220\nOther things we can do, DFS.\n\n571\n00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:16.850\nLet's jump down our list a little bit,\nDaniel, while I've got this guy open.\n\n572\n00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:19.780\nWe're talking about data redundancy, and\n\n573\n00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:24.600\ndata redundancy is a way that I can, well\n\n574\n00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:30.920\nson of a gun, let's not save my changes,\nI didn't make any changes to that thing.\n\n575\n00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:35.732\nData redundancy is a way to have\na redundant copy of my data.\n\n576\n00:29:35.732 --> 00:29:38.780\nAll right?\n\n577\n00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:40.780\nWhich means I've got more than one copy.\n\n578\n00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:42.770\nAgain, business continuity.\n\n579\n00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:49.514\nI don't wanna single server failing and\ncausing us to lose access to that data.\n\n580\n00:29:49.514 --> 00:29:53.880\nDFS is one of Microsoft's solutions for\ndata redundancy.\n\n581\n00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:56.100\nIt's called distributed file system.\n\n582\n00:29:56.100 --> 00:30:00.670\nAnd what it allows me to do is take a,\nwe've got a couple file servers here.\n\n583\n00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:03.880\nI've got one in New York and\nif I zoom out just a wee bit,\n\n584\n00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:09.890\nI've got one over here in London, and\nthey've got these file shares on it.\n\n585\n00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:12.010\nAnd with DFS,\n\n586\n00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:16.040\nwhat I can do is I can create\na logical file structure, all right?\n\n587\n00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.530\nA namespace is what they're\ngoing to call that.\n\n588\n00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:23.480\nAnd then I've got folders inside there\nthat point to the physical share.\n\n589\n00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.260\nThis is where the actual data resides.\n\n590\n00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:26.430\nLet's say it's on this New York site.\n\n591\n00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:29.220\nYou're going to navigate,\n\n592\n00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:32.180\na user would connect to this server,\nclick on this folder.\n\n593\n00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:35.679\nBehind the scenes, it's redirecting\nhim to this file server here.\n\n594\n00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:42.670\nThen what I can do is I can use\nreplication to make a copy of that.\n\n595\n00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:45.370\nIn fact, let's toss that in there.\n\n596\n00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:48.470\nLet's say we go with something like this.\n\n597\n00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:54.148\nAnd we'll go there.\nAnd we'll drag that guy out a wee bit.\n\n598\n00:30:54.148 --> 00:30:56.815\nAnd let's give it a different color.\n\n599\n00:30:56.815 --> 00:31:00.550\nSo there,\nthat's what we call DFS replication.\n\n600\n00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:05.840\nI can replicate the data content between\nthese two different file servers.\n\n601\n00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:10.420\nIf this link goes down, all right, let's\nsay that New York site's unavailable,\n\n602\n00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:13.860\nthere's still a referral\nto this London site.\n\n603\n00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.680\nAnd any changes that were made\nbefore this guy goes down\n\n604\n00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:20.100\nare going to be visible here because\nof that replication that's going on.\n\n605\n00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:22.770\nSo really we're talking\nabout data redundancy.\n\n606\n00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:25.890\nWe're making sure we have more\nthan one copy of that data and\n\n607\n00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:29.950\nthat changes are being synchronized, so if\nwe lose access to one copy, the other copy\n\n608\n00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:35.450\nis there available, and it's the latest\nand greatest version of the information.\n\n609\n00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:37.560\nOther things they call out on our exam,\nDaniel,\n\n610\n00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:42.670\ngonna be UPSs or\nuninterruptible power supplies.\n\n611\n00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:44.095\n>> Yeah, kind of an important thing.\n\n612\n00:31:44.095 --> 00:31:46.191\n[LAUGH] You wanna make sure\nthe computer always has power,\n\n613\n00:31:46.191 --> 00:31:48.869\notherwise you're not gonna be able\nto use it very well, are you, Mike?\n\n614\n00:31:48.869 --> 00:31:50.667\n>> No, no we're not.\n\n615\n00:31:50.667 --> 00:31:52.275\nAll right, and I tell you what,\n\n616\n00:31:52.275 --> 00:31:56.098\nSimpleDiagrams has just given me a fit\ntoday here switching back and forth.\n\n617\n00:31:56.098 --> 00:31:56.957\nThere we go.\n\n618\n00:31:56.957 --> 00:32:02.386\nAgain, pretty simplistic little\ndrawing here, but as Daniel said,\n\n619\n00:32:02.386 --> 00:32:08.372\npower very important part of running\nour servers, crazy as that maybe.\n\n620\n00:32:08.372 --> 00:32:10.459\nAll right, they don't have\nbatteries like we do on laptops.\n\n621\n00:32:10.459 --> 00:32:14.590\nSo a UPS in an uninterruptible\npower supply.\n\n622\n00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:18.795\nAnd it has batteries inside it,\nand so it's plugged into the wall.\n\n623\n00:32:18.795 --> 00:32:23.442\nIt's feeding juice from the wall,\nelectricity from the wall to that UPS,\n\n624\n00:32:23.442 --> 00:32:25.530\ncharging those batteries.\n\n625\n00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:29.020\nAnd then our servers are pulling\npower from that UPS.\n\n626\n00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:32.069\nIt really depends,\nthere are active UPSs and passive UPSs.\n\n627\n00:32:32.069 --> 00:32:36.070\nI don't think we really need to\nbreak it down for this exam.\n\n628\n00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:39.920\nBut, just for your own benefit,\na passive UPS,\n\n629\n00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:45.170\nthe electricity is coming from the wall\nthrough the UPS right into the servers.\n\n630\n00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:48.060\nAnd it's being redirected to\ncharge the batteries as well.\n\n631\n00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:50.690\nBut it's almost like your server\nwas plugged into the wall.\n\n632\n00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:52.890\nIt's getting the power from the wall,\nbasically.\n\n633\n00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:56.960\nIt's just being fed through the UPS,\nso it can charge the batteries.\n\n634\n00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:01.270\nAnd if that power ever fails,\nif it ceases to come from the wall,\n\n635\n00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:04.950\nthen the battery starts\nsupplying power to that server.\n\n636\n00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:09.504\nWhereas an active UPS, the electricity\ncomes in from the wall into the UPS,\n\n637\n00:33:09.504 --> 00:33:11.013\ncharges the batteries.\n\n638\n00:33:11.013 --> 00:33:15.992\nThe server plugged into the UPS is\nactually pulling power from the batteries,\n\n639\n00:33:15.992 --> 00:33:19.560\ninstead of from the pass\nthrough along those passives.\n\n640\n00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:24.340\nThe advantage there is that the UPS\nhas the ability to clean that power.\n\n641\n00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.060\nWait, what the heck is a dirty power?\n\n642\n00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:28.480\nWell if you ever plug a meter\ninto your wall outlet,\n\n643\n00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.400\nyou're gonna see that it's\nnot a steady 120, right.\n\n644\n00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.400\nIt fluctuates up and down and up and down.\n\n645\n00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:37.460\nThose are sags and spikes, and\nthose can be hard on equipment.\n\n646\n00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:41.000\nAnd so,\nan active UPS can level that out and\n\n647\n00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.380\nmake sure the servers are always getting\na nice level set or bit of electricity.\n\n648\n00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:48.650\nIf the power fails, then, of course,\n\n649\n00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:51.010\nthe batteries continue to\nfeed power to the server.\n\n650\n00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:52.521\nThey're just not being charged anymore.\n\n651\n00:33:52.521 --> 00:33:54.620\nAnd you can see a typical setup here.\n\n652\n00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:55.360\nI've got a server.\n\n653\n00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:58.530\nMost of my servers have\ndual power supplies.\n\n654\n00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:00.420\nSo, I'm gonna plug those into the UPS.\n\n655\n00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:04.250\nAnd, if we're really paying attention\nto our single points of failure,\n\n656\n00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:06.630\nthen we're gonna have more than one UPS.\n\n657\n00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:09.070\nSo, that one power supply's\nplugged into one UPS.\n\n658\n00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:11.680\nThe other power supply's\nplugged into a separate UPS.\n\n659\n00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:15.810\nThat way if a UPS fails, it doesn't bring\nmy power down, right, my server down.\n\n660\n00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:19.794\nIf they're both plugged into the same UPS,\nwhy have two power supplies right?\n\n661\n00:34:19.794 --> 00:34:21.702\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right, and\n\n662\n00:34:21.702 --> 00:34:26.364\nthen each UPS plugged into what I tried to\ndraw here was two different outlets that\n\n663\n00:34:26.364 --> 00:34:30.770\nwould be tied to two different circuits\non my power in the building, right.\n\n664\n00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:35.680\nI don't want one circuit breaker\ntripping bringing down both of my UPSs.\n\n665\n00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:40.990\nSo we wanna think about that business\ncontinuity all the way through here.\n\n666\n00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:44.000\nAnd I know Daniel at the insurance company\nyou probably had some serious redundancy\n\n667\n00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.140\nwhen it comes to power.\n\n668\n00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:47.320\n>> Yeah we scaled it up a little bit.\n\n669\n00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:51.040\nWe had everything from the desktop\nUPS that's sitting right there\n\n670\n00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.980\nnext to the computers in the building.\n\n671\n00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:56.550\nWe also had large rack-mounted UPSs for\n\n672\n00:34:56.550 --> 00:35:01.490\nour servers that also went to\na large UPS system battery banks.\n\n673\n00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:03.960\nBatteries as far as the eye could see.\n\n674\n00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:07.160\nNo doubt just tons and tons of rows and\nrows of batteries all connected together.\n\n675\n00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:11.188\nWe also had diesel generators that\nwere the size of a Mack truck.\n\n676\n00:35:11.188 --> 00:35:15.466\nLiterally it was a five story building,\nthat's probably over 100,000 square feet.\n\n677\n00:35:15.466 --> 00:35:17.278\nIt was a huge building.\n\n678\n00:35:17.278 --> 00:35:19.884\nAnd we could run the building\noff of all the we had,\n\n679\n00:35:19.884 --> 00:35:21.571\nwe even had solar panel as well.\n\n680\n00:35:21.571 --> 00:35:22.110\n>> [LAUGH] Oh, wow.\n\n681\n00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:23.895\n>> They weren't playing\naround about the power.\n\n682\n00:35:23.895 --> 00:35:28.264\n[LAUGH] It can run the entire building\nwithout touching the electrical grid in\n\n683\n00:35:28.264 --> 00:35:29.979\nthe town for at least a month.\n\n684\n00:35:29.979 --> 00:35:30.572\n>> Wow.\n\n685\n00:35:30.572 --> 00:35:34.570\n>> So and you're talking service,\ncomputers, lights, air conditioning.\n\n686\n00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:36.860\nWe had a full cafeteria, you name it.\n\n687\n00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:40.890\nAll that stuff could run for\na whole month just based off of our\n\n688\n00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:43.910\npower redundancy that we had\ninstalled in the building.\n\n689\n00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:44.860\n>> That is impressive stuff.\n\n690\n00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:45.500\n>> It was impressive.\n\n691\n00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:49.860\n>> And again, if the business warrants it,\nright, the expense is well worth it.\n\n692\n00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:52.368\nThat's what those C level\nexecs end up deciding.\n\n693\n00:35:52.368 --> 00:35:53.982\nThey do their risk management.\n\n694\n00:35:53.982 --> 00:35:55.641\nThey say, hey, it's worth having this.\n\n695\n00:35:55.641 --> 00:35:58.657\nWe want to be able to go,\na hurricane comes through Florida,\n\n696\n00:35:58.657 --> 00:36:02.218\nwe can lose power for some time\ndepending on where that hurricane goes.\n\n697\n00:36:02.218 --> 00:36:05.734\nIf it wipes out our power plant or\nmost of the major transmission lines,\n\n698\n00:36:05.734 --> 00:36:08.240\nwe could be without power for some time.\n\n699\n00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.603\nI'll be coming to visit\nDaniel's old workplace.\n\n700\n00:36:10.603 --> 00:36:11.745\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Oh man,\n\n701\n00:36:11.745 --> 00:36:14.420\nI used to say if the power goes out,\nI know where I'm going, I'm going to work\n\n702\n00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.259\n>> [LAUGH] Hey remember me, guys,\n\n703\n00:36:16.259 --> 00:36:17.470\nyou wanna let me in?\n\n704\n00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:21.522\nAll right, couple more things, I know\nwe're dragging this out here a little bit.\n\n705\n00:36:21.522 --> 00:36:25.533\nBut the other things we wanna talk\nabout for business continuity,\n\n706\n00:36:25.533 --> 00:36:31.280\nfolder redirection, and let me pull up,\nI've got another diagram for that one.\n\n707\n00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:34.755\nFolder redirection is\na way to redirect folders.\n\n708\n00:36:34.755 --> 00:36:38.199\n[LAUGH] Oh yeah, doesn't get\nmuch easier than, that does it?\n\n709\n00:36:38.199 --> 00:36:41.152\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, the idea here is our profiles where\n\n710\n00:36:41.152 --> 00:36:44.670\nwe store our documents,\nour pictures, things like that.\n\n711\n00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:46.480\nThat's a local resource.\n\n712\n00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:47.570\nAnd if this machine fails,\n\n713\n00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:52.310\nif a hard drive in my client fails,\nthen I lose access to that information.\n\n714\n00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:54.930\nAnd typically we're not backing\nup client machines, all right?\n\n715\n00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:58.700\nWe're backing up our servers every night,\nnot backing up the clients.\n\n716\n00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:00.280\nFolder redirection says hey,\nyou know what?\n\n717\n00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:03.510\nTake that folder there,\nMy Documents, for example, and\n\n718\n00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:05.328\nput it up in the shared\nfolder on the network.\n\n719\n00:37:05.328 --> 00:37:09.250\nMake a subfolder for each user so that\neverybody still has their privacy, but\n\n720\n00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:11.012\nput it up here on this file server.\n\n721\n00:37:11.012 --> 00:37:14.801\nAnd then when that user logs on,\nit's no longer a local resource,\n\n722\n00:37:14.801 --> 00:37:18.340\nit reaches out to the file server and\ngets their My Documents.\n\n723\n00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:22.250\nWhen they save things in there, it's\nsynchronized up here to this file server.\n\n724\n00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:25.980\nThat way, if this hard drive fails,\nthen it doesn't matter.\n\n725\n00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:28.000\nI replace the hard drive,\nI re-install the operating system.\n\n726\n00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.230\nThat user logs back on, and their profile\nreaches out, grabs their My Documents,.\n\n727\n00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:33.470\nEverything's still there.\n\n728\n00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:35.660\nI back this file server up every night.\n\n729\n00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:36.580\nSo, I'm not worried about it.\n\n730\n00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:39.360\nAnd now I'm backing up that user data.\n\n731\n00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:43.070\nAnother real cool advantage of\nfolder redirection is because\n\n732\n00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:47.710\nthe profile's no longer a local resource,\nit doesn't matter what machine I go to.\n\n733\n00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:50.580\nNormally, if I put something\nin My Documents here, and\n\n734\n00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:53.700\nthen I go log onto this machine,\nit's a different set of My Documents.\n\n735\n00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:55.220\nIt's a local resource.\n\n736\n00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:59.230\nWell now that My Documents is located\nhere, doesn't matter what machine I go to,\n\n737\n00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:02.500\nI'll have access to the same\ncopy of My Documents.\n\n738\n00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:03.140\nSo a really cool feature there.\n\n739\n00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:07.430\nYou can redirect My Documents,\ntheir Desktop, their Start Menu, pictures.\n\n740\n00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:09.640\nThere's about 13 different\nfolders you can redirect,\n\n741\n00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:11.570\ndepending on how you want to set that up.\n\n742\n00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:14.917\nAgain, a way to keep this going, if we\nstart to losing hard drives on clients,\n\n743\n00:38:14.917 --> 00:38:16.407\nmy users can still be productive.\n\n744\n00:38:16.407 --> 00:38:18.200\nThey're not gonna like that.\n\n745\n00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.360\nThey thought they were gonna\nget a half a day off, but no.\n\n746\n00:38:21.825 --> 00:38:23.626\n>> You're still coming to work, everybody.\n\n747\n00:38:23.626 --> 00:38:24.793\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's our job,\n\n748\n00:38:24.793 --> 00:38:26.350\nmake sure you can still come to work.\n\n749\n00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:28.990\nBut Mike, you're right,\nall these great concepts and\n\n750\n00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:33.140\nmethods that we're showing you today,\nis what keeps businesses running.\n\n751\n00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:35.590\nAny kind of downtime is very,\nvery detrimental to any kind of business.\n\n752\n00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:39.100\nIt doesn't matter whether it's a business\nthat's trying to make money, or\n\n753\n00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:42.080\nif it's an organization,\nmaybe charities, things like that.\n\n754\n00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.480\nThey all require this\ntype of infrastructure so\n\n755\n00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:47.846\nthat they can continue to do whatever\nit is they do on a daily basis.\n\n756\n00:38:47.846 --> 00:38:50.435\nAnd be able to face those disasters, or\n\n757\n00:38:50.435 --> 00:38:55.693\njust maybe some foreseen down time that\nthey know is going to happen and mitigate\n\n758\n00:38:55.693 --> 00:39:01.220\nthat down to as little time as possible\nbecause up time is what we're all about.\n\n759\n00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:05.615\nYou'll notice a lot of people sell you\non how long will you be up, right,\n\n760\n00:39:05.615 --> 00:39:07.282\nor the minimize down time.\n\n761\n00:39:07.282 --> 00:39:10.943\nYou'll only be down for\n0.0001% of the time, and\n\n762\n00:39:10.943 --> 00:39:14.280\nif you can get that,\nthat's a really good deal.\n\n763\n00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:15.870\n>> Yeah absolutely.\n\n764\n00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:17.355\nAll right,\nlast thing we're gonna talk about, and\n\n765\n00:39:17.355 --> 00:39:18.418\nI promise I'll stop talking about.\n\n766\n00:39:18.418 --> 00:39:23.191\nBusiness continuity is gonna be\nthe Active Directory restore, right?\n\n767\n00:39:23.191 --> 00:39:28.001\nActive Directory, that's our database that\nstores all my user account information,\n\n768\n00:39:28.001 --> 00:39:31.253\ngroups, it handles security for\nmy domain environments.\n\n769\n00:39:31.253 --> 00:39:35.838\nAnd with Active Directory, we always\nhave more than one domain controller for\n\n770\n00:39:35.838 --> 00:39:38.206\nfault tolerance, for load balancing.\n\n771\n00:39:38.206 --> 00:39:41.501\nAnd they use replication to keep\neverything synchronized between\n\n772\n00:39:41.501 --> 00:39:43.338\nthe different domain controllers.\n\n773\n00:39:43.338 --> 00:39:46.623\nIf I lose one of those domain controllers.\n\n774\n00:39:46.623 --> 00:39:49.583\nLet's say a hard drive fails on\none of my domain controllers.\n\n775\n00:39:49.583 --> 00:39:51.530\nWell, we have to restore Active Directory.\n\n776\n00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:55.560\nWe have to reinstall the operating system\nor get our system state back up and\n\n777\n00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:56.560\nrestore that.\n\n778\n00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:00.260\nAnd then we've gotta restore\nthe Active Directory database Itself.\n\n779\n00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:04.690\nAnd when we do that, that other domain\ncontroller is still up and running.\n\n780\n00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:06.630\nAnd changes could be occurring.\n\n781\n00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:09.750\nPeople could be changing passwords,\ncreating a new user account,\n\n782\n00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:11.040\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n783\n00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:14.145\nI restore that domain controller that\nfailed from the backup that occurred\n\n784\n00:40:14.145 --> 00:40:15.170\nlast night.\n\n785\n00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:16.160\nWell that's 24 hours old.\n\n786\n00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:19.570\nThere's a lot of changes that\nhave occurred since then.\n\n787\n00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:20.840\nAm I worried?\n\n788\n00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:24.770\nNo, all I have to do is rebuild that\nserver, throw new hard drives in there,\n\n789\n00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:28.040\nput my latest backup on there,\nslap it back on the network.\n\n790\n00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:29.690\nAnd as soon as those two\ndomain controllers start\n\n791\n00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:32.980\ntalking to each other again, the one\nthat never went down is gonna say, hey,\n\n792\n00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:36.510\nyour data is way out of date,\nhere is all the new stuff.\n\n793\n00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:40.010\nThey'll replicate all the changes that\nhe missed out on, because remember,\n\n794\n00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:44.550\nthat back up is essentially rolling\nthat domain controller back in time.\n\n795\n00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:47.480\nHe's gonna get caught up as soon as\nhe talks to his replication partners,\n\n796\n00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:50.110\nto the other domain controllers,\nand he's good to go.\n\n797\n00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:52.630\nSo really easy to restore\nActive Directory in that respect.\n\n798\n00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:54.350\nYou just rebuild the server.\n\n799\n00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:55.540\nSlap a back up on there.\n\n800\n00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:57.030\nRestore a back up on there.\n\n801\n00:40:57.030 --> 00:41:00.620\nLet replication get it up to date,\nand you're good to go.\n\n802\n00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:04.380\nWhere that won't work is when you're\ntrying to replace a deleted object.\n\n803\n00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:08.290\nLet's say somebody accidentally went\ninto Active Directory and deleted an OU,\n\n804\n00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:11.600\nand in that OU were\ndozens of user accounts.\n\n805\n00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:13.850\nWell now I've gotta\nrestore that information.\n\n806\n00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:17.600\nSo I go get my backup from\nbefore the OU was deleted, and\n\n807\n00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:21.850\nI restore it on that domain controller,\nand I connect it to the network.\n\n808\n00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:23.980\nWell, then you think,\nokay, now that OU's back,\n\n809\n00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:26.660\nhe'll tell everybody else about it,\nwe'll be good to go.\n\n810\n00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:28.770\nNo, The problem is,\n\n811\n00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:32.210\nthe other domain controllers\nare gonna say, hey, that was deleted.\n\n812\n00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:37.380\nThe time stamp I have for when that was\ndeleted is newer than the time stamp\n\n813\n00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:40.210\nof when you created that OU, or\n\n814\n00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:43.080\nfrom that back up,\ncuz the back up was from last night.\n\n815\n00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.040\nAnd so\nthey're going to actually delete it again.\n\n816\n00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:47.160\nAs soon as you get done restoring it and\n\n817\n00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:50.010\nyou plug it back into the network,\nit's gonna disappear again.\n\n818\n00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:51.830\nAnd that's not what you want.\n\n819\n00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:54.880\nSo we have to do what's called\nan authoritative restore.\n\n820\n00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.500\nAnd what we're doing is\nwe're marking that object,\n\n821\n00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:00.230\nin this case that OU with\nall those user accounts.\n\n822\n00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:03.350\nAnd we're gonna change what's\ncalled the update sequence number.\n\n823\n00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:07.230\nAnd that's what they use to\ncompare versions to see who has\n\n824\n00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:10.100\nthe latest version of\nan object when they replicate.\n\n825\n00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:12.738\nAnd we're going to increase\nthat update sequence number,\n\n826\n00:42:12.738 --> 00:42:16.071\nwe're going to take the domain\ncontroller offline, restore our backup.\n\n827\n00:42:16.071 --> 00:42:21.127\nBut before we put him back online we're\ngonna use something called NTDSUtil\n\n828\n00:42:21.127 --> 00:42:26.354\nto increase the update sequence number\non that OU and all those user accounts.\n\n829\n00:42:26.354 --> 00:42:27.282\nAnd we're gonna increase it a lot.\n\n830\n00:42:27.282 --> 00:42:29.420\nIt's actually 100,000 per day.\n\n831\n00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:32.830\nSo if that backup is three days old,\nit'll actually increase that USN,\n\n832\n00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:35.934\nthat update sequence number, by 300,000.\n\n833\n00:42:35.934 --> 00:42:41.180\nThat ensures that domain\ncontroller's version of the object\n\n834\n00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:42.680\nis newer than any other.\n\n835\n00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:47.000\nTo them it's gonna look newer than\nany other copy that they might have.\n\n836\n00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.050\nAnd they're gonna say instead\nof deleting that object, wow,\n\n837\n00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:52.880\nyou've got the latest version\nof that object, let us have it.\n\n838\n00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:57.470\nSo in authoritative restore you\nbring domain controller offline,\n\n839\n00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:58.940\nyou restore your backup.\n\n840\n00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:02.680\nBut before you connect it to\nthe network you used NTDSUtil\n\n841\n00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:04.970\nto mark that object as authoritative,\n\n842\n00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:08.910\nincreases the update sequence number,\nthen you bring them back online.\n\n843\n00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:12.430\nWhen they replicate that deleted\nobject will get replicated it\n\n844\n00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:15.378\nback out to all the other domain\ncontrollers and everybody's happy.\n\n845\n00:43:15.378 --> 00:43:18.970\nSo just to understand the difference\nthere, you've got your normal restore\n\n846\n00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:21.670\nwhich means let the other\ndomain controllers catch me up.\n\n847\n00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:24.380\nThat's also known as\na non-authoritative restore.\n\n848\n00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:27.550\nThen you've got the authoritative restore\nwhere I need to mark an object as\n\n849\n00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:31.320\nauthoritative, and make sure it\nremains and doesn't get removed again.\n\n850\n00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:32.800\n>> Mike,\nit sounds like you're Active Directory\n\n851\n00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.362\nhas a relationship built upon lies.\n\n852\n00:43:34.362 --> 00:43:37.282\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It can never stand.\n\n853\n00:43:37.282 --> 00:43:38.030\n>> No, don't tell it.\n\n854\n00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:39.541\nDon't tell it that.\n\n855\n00:43:39.541 --> 00:43:43.127\nWell this is obviously a very cool thing\ncuz sometimes that does happen, and\n\n856\n00:43:43.127 --> 00:43:46.824\nyou don't want your active directory\ngoing, hey, no, no that's old data,\n\n857\n00:43:46.824 --> 00:43:48.470\nthat's supposed to be gone.\n\n858\n00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:52.020\nAnd deleting, you're like, I'm trying to\nrestore this thing, stop deleting it.\n\n859\n00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:55.340\nAnd sometimes we have to take\nsome action to say, listen,\n\n860\n00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:58.250\nhere's how i can guarantee you\nthat you will not delete this.\n\n861\n00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:01.720\nActually, you're gonna love it so much,\nyou're gonna wanna copy of it yourself.\n\n862\n00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:03.690\nThen we repopulate our Active Directory.\n\n863\n00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:04.540\nVery cool stuff, Mike.\n\n864\n00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:07.500\nIs there anything else we need to know for\nBusiness Continuity sake?\n\n865\n00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:09.710\n>> Be careful.\nRemember, people come first, so\n\n866\n00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:10.350\ntake care of them.\n\n867\n00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:11.510\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n868\n00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:14.090\nAll right, Mike we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap this show up then.\n\n869\n00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:17.660\nThanks for watching this, signing off for\nITPRO TV I've been your host,\n\n870\n00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:18.360\nDaniel Lawry.\n\n871\n00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:19.028\n>> And I'm Mike

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.832 --> 00:00:18.534\nI'm your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n4\n00:00:18.534 --> 00:00:21.400\nJoining me yet again today is Mr.\nMike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.240\nHow's it going Mikey?\n\n6\n00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.090\n>> Oh it's going great Daniel,\nand I'm excited.\n\n7\n00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.954\nWe've got our MTA content coming your way\nin this episode we're gonna be looking\n\n8\n00:00:27.954 --> 00:00:32.800\nLooking at updates, one of those things\nthat we hate and love, love and hate.\n\n9\n00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.790\nI don't know it's got that\nkind of relationship,\n\n10\n00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.380\nbut a very important part of\nmaintaining our servers so\n\n11\n00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.280\nwe've got to understand the process and\nthere's a little more to it.\n\n12\n00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.340\nAll of us are familiar with updates.\n\n13\n00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.630\nWe understand that process, I'm sure.\n\n14\n00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.900\nBut there's a little more to it when\nit comes to our server environments,\n\n15\n00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.910\na couple of different ways we\ncan go about doing the updates.\n\n16\n00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.810\n>> Yeah Mike, it's not just click\nthe little shield down at the bottom right\n\n17\n00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.440\nhand corner of your screen and\nhit apply updates.\n\n18\n00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.390\nHow do they even get there?\n\n19\n00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.420\nWhere does that come from?\n\n20\n00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.388\nWell that's the kind of thing\nwe're gonna talk about today.\n\n21\n00:01:02.388 --> 00:01:06.800\nNot just that, not just server updates,\nbut software updates, driver updates,\n\n22\n00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.290\nany kind of program that you have on your\ncomputer Well, at some point in time it's\n\n23\n00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.538\nprobably going to require an update, and\nthat's what we're going to tackle today.\n\n24\n00:01:15.538 --> 00:01:17.830\nWe're going to take a look at\nhow do we make that happen?\n\n25\n00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.450\nHow do we schedule these things?\n\n26\n00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.970\nWhat's best practices?\n\n27\n00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.290\nAnd Mike, you're going to kind of hold\nour hand with this, aren't you, and\n\n28\n00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.031\nshow us what to do.\n\n29\n00:01:25.031 --> 00:01:26.237\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'm going to walk you through it.\n\n30\n00:01:26.237 --> 00:01:27.130\nI'm sure going to try.\n\n31\n00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.840\nAll right, so updates again.\n\n32\n00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.110\nThis is a little basic.\n\n33\n00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.130\nBut when we have software,\n\n34\n00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.910\nwe have applications that we've run,\nwe have operating systems that we've run.\n\n35\n00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.240\nWell when they write that code,\nthey try to make it as best as they can.\n\n36\n00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.780\nRight?\n\n37\n00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.830\nWell we think they do.\n\n38\n00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.646\nI don't know sometimes, with Windows.\n\n39\n00:01:44.646 --> 00:01:46.460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just kidding.\n\n40\n00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.540\nThey try to do the best they can.\n\n41\n00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.600\nBut once that software Offers out,\nand you're using it.\n\n42\n00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.760\nOr, an operating system is out for\nawhile, we start to find vulnerabilities,\n\n43\n00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.320\nor issues that that software, or\nthat application might have, and\n\n44\n00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.580\nthey can put out updates\nto fix those problems.\n\n45\n00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.980\nOr, they might put out an update to extend\nthe functionality Of an application,\n\n46\n00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.550\nor an operating system, right?\n\n47\n00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.680\nSo, updates are a good thing.\n\n48\n00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.150\nWe need to go out, and we get them,\nand we need to check on,\n\n49\n00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.240\nthis is part of hardening a server.\n\n50\n00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.750\nAny security class that you take, and\nwe talk about server security, and\n\n51\n00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.910\nwe're gonna talk about hardening a server.\n\n52\n00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.167\nAnd it really holds true for\nmy client operating systems as well.\n\n53\n00:02:24.167 --> 00:02:26.825\nOne of the big tenants of hardening\n\n54\n00:02:26.825 --> 00:02:32.670\na server is to make sure you've\napplied all available updates.\n\n55\n00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.970\nIt's like, why would you?\n\n56\n00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.720\nI'm trying to think of a good analogy,\nthere's an update available.\n\n57\n00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.800\nYou've got a hole in your application,\nand if somebody finds it and\n\n58\n00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.690\ntakes advantage of it,\nthey could compromise your entire system.\n\n59\n00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.380\nWell, the vendor has put out\nan update to patch that hole and yet,\n\n60\n00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.690\nyou don't have it, right?\n\n61\n00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.770\nSo, you're vulnerable to\nsomething that you shouldn't be,\n\n62\n00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.580\nthat's why updates are so important.\n\n63\n00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.080\nWe have to go out there, and\nwe have to get them, and\n\n64\n00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.790\nwe have to make sure we apply them,\nand that's everything, right?\n\n65\n00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.860\nThat's the software that we're running,\nthe applications that you've bought or\n\n66\n00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.820\ndownloaded, or\n\n67\n00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:09.020\nyour company has installed on your\nmachines, those have to be updated.\n\n68\n00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.890\nDrivers have to be updated.\n\n69\n00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.170\nApplications, I can't really\nshow you applications.\n\n70\n00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.770\nI don't have an application that\njust happens to need an update.\n\n71\n00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.250\nBut I'm sure you've seen it before.\n\n72\n00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.230\nYou open up an application and\na little message pops up and says,\n\n73\n00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.150\nhey a newer version is available or\nan update is available.\n\n74\n00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.460\nAll those things that run in your system\ntray Adobe, Java, all those guys,\n\n75\n00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.560\nLogitech that are constantly going out and\nchecking for updates, right?\n\n76\n00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.180\nThat's exactly what they're doing,\nthey're pulling down updates.\n\n77\n00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:44.630\nDrivers, we could go into device manager,\nand we can update drivers through here.\n\n78\n00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.860\nNow, granted a lot of the updates\nthat you get nowadays are executable,\n\n79\n00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.050\nyou just run them.\n\n80\n00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.450\nSometimes you might have to come in here,\nand expand one of these guys out, and\n\n81\n00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.490\ngo to the properties of that device and go\nto drivers and maybe it wasn't executable.\n\n82\n00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.960\nMaybe you extracted it out a zip file and\nit's now a folder on the hard drive.\n\n83\n00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.410\nAnd I can come in here and choose update\ndriver and I could browse my computer, and\n\n84\n00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.370\nI could go find that folder, point it\nto it, I'm just gonna look at it and\n\n85\n00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.910\nsay is this driver,\ndoes it have the same ID as this device?\n\n86\n00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.130\nIf so, let's go ahead and import\nthat driver and get it ready to use.\n\n87\n00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.300\nOf course if it's a driver like this,\nyou're gonna have to restart the system\n\n88\n00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.260\nfor that new driver to kick in, but very\nimportant work keeping those up to date.\n\n89\n00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.750\nSame thing, they can have vulnerabilities,\nthey can put out updates to\n\n90\n00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.850\npatch those vulnerabilities, They might\nchange the functionality of the device.\n\n91\n00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.510\nThey might add new support or\nnew functionality of that device.\n\n92\n00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.780\nSo very important we\nkeep those up to date.\n\n93\n00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.040\nOperating system.\n\n94\n00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.570\nWe've all been using computers for\nsome time, we know Microsoft.\n\n95\n00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.730\nThat goes out every night at three o'clock\nin the morning and checks for updates.\n\n96\n00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.980\nIt says, hey, I'm a Windows 7\nmachine running Service Pack 1.\n\n97\n00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.100\nWhat updates are available?\n\n98\n00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.180\nOh I don't have that one, and\n\n99\n00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.000\nit presents you that list of updates\nthat you can choose to install.\n\n100\n00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.720\nSo, very important we keep our\noperating system up to date.\n\n101\n00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.110\nWindows update is Microsoft's\nupdate client, all right?\n\n102\n00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.290\nOn your machines, and this is client or\n\n103\n00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.130\nserver, there's the windows update,\nautomatic update client.\n\n104\n00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.550\nAnd it's a service that runs, and\nthat's what reaches out to Microsoft and\n\n105\n00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.510\nreports in and says this is my OS, this is\nmy version number, my service pack level.\n\n106\n00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.920\nThese are what I all ready have,\nwhat else do you got for me?\n\n107\n00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.160\nThat's what's reaching out to Microsoft\nevery night, at three in the morning\n\n108\n00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.320\nif you've left by default and\nretrieving that list of updates.\n\n109\n00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.410\nNow, when it comes to servers,\nI said there's a couple different ways\n\n110\n00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.735\nwe can go about this and let's think\nabout the enterprise environment.\n\n111\n00:05:44.735 --> 00:05:48.610\nCUz it's a little different than what\nwe deal with in our home fronts or\n\n112\n00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.080\nin our sohos, our small office,\nhome office type environments.\n\n113\n00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.120\nIn those, we're typically letting\nthe machines go out, check with Microsoft,\n\n114\n00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.930\nget those updates, pull them down,\ninstall them, what have you, right?\n\n115\n00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.210\nNo real centralized management\nof that update process.\n\n116\n00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.830\nProblem is,\nsometimes updates can cause problems.\n\n117\n00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:09.990\nSo, that is the problem, right?\n\n118\n00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.840\nI'll be redundant there, all right.\n\n119\n00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.420\nYou might get an update and it comes down\nto your system, it gets installed and\n\n120\n00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.610\nnow all of a sudden,\nit breaks something, right?\n\n121\n00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.720\nI know, like service packs are a big one,\ncuz they typically add\n\n122\n00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.860\na lot of functionality but\nit's not limited to just that.\n\n123\n00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.610\nAn install or an update gets\npushed down to your system and\n\n124\n00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.250\nall of a sudden you can't print anymore.\n\n125\n00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.230\nOr you get blue screen cuz of\na video driver update, right?\n\n126\n00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.700\nOr you update your network adapter\ndriver and now, all of a sudden,\n\n127\n00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.480\nyou can't communicate on the network.\n\n128\n00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.370\nThings are gonna happen,\nin a home environment,\n\n129\n00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.400\nin a soho,\nit's usually not mission critical.\n\n130\n00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:49.700\nWe've lost one machine, we can do our last\nknown good, we can do our driver rollback.\n\n131\n00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.500\nWe could do a restore point,\nseveral different ways I could handle\n\n132\n00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.810\nan update causing a problem,\nuninstall the update.\n\n133\n00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:01.310\nWhen we get into an enterprise\nenvironment, however, that approach is not\n\n134\n00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:06.500\nvery efficient cuz I'm not talking\nabout 1, 2 ,5, 10 machines.\n\n135\n00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.750\nI'm talking about hundreds, thousands,\n\n136\n00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.600\nhundreds of thousands of machines\ndepending on how big your organization is.\n\n137\n00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.870\nSo, I want a little bit more\ncontrol over that process and\n\n138\n00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:19.930\nespecially with my servers.\n\n139\n00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:21.560\nYou know the last thing I want,\n\n140\n00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.270\nis to come in on a Wednesday morning after\npatch Tuesday and find out that 80% of\n\n141\n00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.720\nmy servers have now blue screened cuz some\nupdate that went out the night before.\n\n142\n00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.160\nI mean my network is at a standstill,\nnobody can get any work down.\n\n143\n00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.510\nWe're going to emergency\nmode at this point, right?\n\n144\n00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.420\n>> That would be bad,\nwe don't want that to happen.\n\n145\n00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.720\nServers going blue screen,\nsomeones getting called into HR,\n\n146\n00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.855\nmaybe a bosses office and\nexplaining themselves.\n\n147\n00:07:47.855 --> 00:07:48.922\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Absolutely, so\n\n148\n00:07:48.922 --> 00:07:51.451\nMicrosoft gives us a way\nto deal with this.\n\n149\n00:07:51.451 --> 00:07:56.698\nWe use what's called\nWindows Server Update Services or WSUS.\n\n150\n00:07:56.698 --> 00:08:03.620\nFor short, and what this is, is it's a way\nto run my own local update server, right?\n\n151\n00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:07.700\nI'm gonna take a 2008 R2 machine,\nand I'm gonna install a roll, called\n\n152\n00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:12.490\nWindows Server Update Services on it, and\nI'm gonna use that as my update server.\n\n153\n00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.380\nAll of my machines on my network,\n\n154\n00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:19.710\nI'm gonna configure them to check with my\nupdate server, not Microsoft, all right.\n\n155\n00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:22.290\nSo they're gonna get their\nupdates from my server.\n\n156\n00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:23.460\nAnd well, what's the difference?\n\n157\n00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.440\nGet it from Microsoft, get it from your\nserver, still gonna cause a problem.\n\n158\n00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.460\nBecause on my server,\nI can choose which updates I wanna allow.\n\n159\n00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:35.940\nI can approve the updates\non an individual basis, and\n\n160\n00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.260\nI can be very specific\nabout who I approve it for.\n\n161\n00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.620\nI can have a group of test computers.\n\n162\n00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.280\nNowadays, this is typically\nsome virtual machines\n\n163\n00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.870\nthat are mimicking some\nof my production servers.\n\n164\n00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:50.130\nRunning the same software,\nthe same configuration, things like that.\n\n165\n00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:53.340\nI can approve the update,\njust for those test machine.\n\n166\n00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.620\nLet them reach out, get that update,\nlet it run for a day or\n\n167\n00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:00.810\nwhat have you, see what it breaks,\nor see of it breaks anything at all.\n\n168\n00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.620\nOnce I'm sure that the update's\nnot gonna cause a problem,\n\n169\n00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.820\nthen I can turn around and approve it.\n\n170\n00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.690\nFor the rest of the network.\n\n171\n00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:11.540\nSo it gives me that level of\ncontrol I need over these updates.\n\n172\n00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:16.140\nA chance to test them, before I push them\nout to the production environment and\n\n173\n00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.970\ncause mayhem across my network.\n\n174\n00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:22.310\nNow, my server that I'm running locally,\nstill has to get the updates.\n\n175\n00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:25.080\nSo it reaches out and talks to Microsoft.\n\n176\n00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:29.870\nSo I set up my sus server,\nit pulls the updates down from Microsoft,\n\n177\n00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.840\nstores them locally,\nif you choose to do so.\n\n178\n00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.630\nYou do need some disk space to do that.\n\n179\n00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:36.134\nAnd then I can go to my WSUS server, and\n\n180\n00:09:36.134 --> 00:09:39.030\nI can look at the updates that\nhave come down the night before.\n\n181\n00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:41.530\nAnd I can choose, I can say,\noh, that one's for tablets.\n\n182\n00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.600\nWe don't have any tablets,\nwe don't need that.\n\n183\n00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.490\nThat one's for 2003, I don't need that.\n\n184\n00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:49.350\nWe can approve the updates that we want,\nnot approve the updates we don't want.\n\n185\n00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:53.800\nAnd again, approve them for like just the\ntest computers first, give it a chance to\n\n186\n00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.380\nsee if it's gonna cause a problem, before\nwe push out the rest of the network.\n\n187\n00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.610\nAnd it's free.\n\n188\n00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:01.630\nIt's a roll you can\ninstall in Server 2008 R2.\n\n189\n00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:05.060\nBut honestly, I don't see any reason,\nany organization.\n\n190\n00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:06.810\nIf you've got some servers on you network.\n\n191\n00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.820\nIf you're SOHO, and\nyou got one server, maybe not.\n\n192\n00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.764\nBut as soon as you get up\ninto a larger environment,\n\n193\n00:10:12.764 --> 00:10:15.240\nthere's really no reason not to run WSUS.\n\n194\n00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:19.023\n>> Yeah, another good reason to\nuse SUS is the control over.\n\n195\n00:10:19.023 --> 00:10:22.984\nWhen the computer reboots, because think\nabout servers, they're production,\n\n196\n00:10:22.984 --> 00:10:25.997\nthey need to be up and\nonly scheduled down time is what you want.\n\n197\n00:10:25.997 --> 00:10:28.198\nActually, you want to\nhave no down time at all,\n\n198\n00:10:28.198 --> 00:10:32.080\nbut when you install an update a lot of\ntimes those updates require a reboot.\n\n199\n00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.140\nWorst thing in the world that could\nhappen is that my server reboot.\n\n200\n00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.510\nOnce someone's actually accessing it.\n\n201\n00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.630\nSo I can use SUS to say hey,\nyou know what?\n\n202\n00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:44.070\nI'm gonna create a group of servers or\ncomputers, and they won't reboot.\n\n203\n00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:49.130\nThey'll download the update, but\nthey won't install an update and reboot.\n\n204\n00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:53.110\nUntil I tell it, so that I can schedule\nthat time, make sure that everybody's off.\n\n205\n00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:56.090\nI can send out an email, hey,\nthe server's gonna be unavailable for\n\n206\n00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.640\nthis amount of time, and\nduring this amount of time.\n\n207\n00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.800\nAnd it's very nice to do it that way.\n\n208\n00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.740\n>> It really is, and\nWSUS is extremely easy to work with, and\n\n209\n00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.408\nI can show you a couple of things here.\n\n210\n00:11:06.408 --> 00:11:08.240\nIt's a web-driven interface.\n\n211\n00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.330\nLet me make sure I'm on my right machine.\n\n212\n00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:15.530\nSo I'm gonna go over here and\npull up administrative tools.\n\n213\n00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:17.610\nMaybe I didn't put it on this guy.\n\n214\n00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:18.440\nThere he is.\n\n215\n00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.688\nAnd I've already launched it, let me\nclose and I'll launch it again for you.\n\n216\n00:11:21.688 --> 00:11:24.910\nSo I'm gonna go to my start menu,\nadministrative tools,\n\n217\n00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:28.790\nWindows server update services,\nand it's gonna launch my console.\n\n218\n00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:32.660\nAnd everything is managed\nright through here.\n\n219\n00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:37.520\nI've already set this up, because I\nwanted to give you some network access.\n\n220\n00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.423\nThese are my little virtual\nmachine test environments, so\n\n221\n00:11:40.423 --> 00:11:43.858\nwe can download some updates from\nMicrosoft and see what was going on.\n\n222\n00:11:43.858 --> 00:11:45.146\nSo, as I look through here,\n\n223\n00:11:45.146 --> 00:11:48.066\nfirst let's take a look at\nthe properties of the server itself.\n\n224\n00:11:50.027 --> 00:11:52.590\nClick it and\nI'll go down to options down here.\n\n225\n00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:54.450\nAnd, there's a few things that\nyou're gonna have to set again.\n\n226\n00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.327\nThis is a high level overview.\n\n227\n00:11:56.327 --> 00:12:00.300\nIf you want detailed information on\nconfiguring WSUS, and the group policies\n\n228\n00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:04.392\nat making this work, if you move on from\nthis exam, once you've taken this, and\n\n229\n00:12:04.392 --> 00:12:07.303\nyou decide server administration\nis where you wanna go.\n\n230\n00:12:07.303 --> 00:12:12.070\nYou know, make sure you check out those\nMCSA server classes in our library.\n\n231\n00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:14.810\nWith some basics,\nyou know the update source, again,\n\n232\n00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:17.010\nit's synchronizing from Microsoft, right?\n\n233\n00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:23.150\nSo this is where my server reaches out to\nMicrosoft and pulls those updates down.\n\n234\n00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:24.900\nI can set up a hierarchy.\n\n235\n00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.950\nYou might have your main SUS\nserver at the corporate office.\n\n236\n00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:30.760\nAnd then several SUS\nservers at branch offices.\n\n237\n00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.570\nCorporate office,\npulls the updates from Microsoft.\n\n238\n00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:37.530\nBranch office, WSUS servers pull\nthe updates from the corporate office.\n\n239\n00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:39.310\nYou might have a hierarchy\nset up like that.\n\n240\n00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.530\nThat's what this other option is for.\n\n241\n00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:44.550\nIf you have to go through a proxy\nto get internet access for\n\n242\n00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:46.820\nyour cell server, information there.\n\n243\n00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:48.090\nSo synchronize from Microsoft.\n\n244\n00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:51.720\nBelow that, I have this products and\nclassifications,\n\n245\n00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.800\nand this is an important one.\n\n246\n00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:58.720\nYou do not want every single update\nMicrosoft has ever put out for\n\n247\n00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:03.030\nall their products, unless you've got\na few large SANS laying around that you\n\n248\n00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:04.150\ndon't mind eating up right.\n\n249\n00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.940\nWhy do I wanna store\neverything Microsoft makes?\n\n250\n00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:11.810\nThis allows me to choose the updates\nthat I need for my network.\n\n251\n00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:13.070\nInstead of downloading everything.\n\n252\n00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:16.830\nNow, I've unchecked most of it just to\nmake a little easier on this thing,\n\n253\n00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:20.430\nbut, as you scroll through here, hey,\nwe've got Exchange 2010 on our network,\n\n254\n00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:22.970\nso I want to get updates for that.\n\n255\n00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:24.490\nOr maybe we want to get updates,\n\n256\n00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.770\nand I'll get to some, you can see there's\njust all their different products.\n\n257\n00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.830\nOffice.\nWe run 2010 as well as 2013,\n\n258\n00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:35.210\nso I want to make sure I'm\ngetting updates for those.\n\n259\n00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:39.811\nGet down into here,\nthere's SQL, system center,\n\n260\n00:13:39.811 --> 00:13:44.310\nAzure, and eventually,\nway down here we'll get into Windows.\n\n261\n00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:47.850\nAnd maybe we're running Windows 7,\nand maybe Windows 8, or\n\n262\n00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:50.550\nWindows 8.1, but you get the idea.\n\n263\n00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:52.500\nI can be very specific about,\n\n264\n00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:56.330\nwhat updates I'm choosing to\nsynchronize from Microsoft.\n\n265\n00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:59.880\nYou do not want to get them all,\ncuz it'll just take up too much space.\n\n266\n00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.890\nI'm gonna cancel that,\nI don't wanna change that.\n\n267\n00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:03.250\n>> Plus there's no point to it,\nright, Mike?\n\n268\n00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:07.410\nI mean,\nIf I don't have a product on my network,\n\n269\n00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:08.760\nwhy am I downloading updates for it?\n\n270\n00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.960\nIt's just sitting around, taking up space,\ndoing absolutely nothing.\n\n271\n00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:15.090\nIf you ever actually buy or\ninstall that product, well then,\n\n272\n00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:16.358\nyou can just go right back in here.\n\n273\n00:14:16.358 --> 00:14:19.202\nAnd you're gonna say,\nhey now we're using this product and\n\n274\n00:14:19.202 --> 00:14:22.880\nit'll grab all those updates, and you'll\nbe right to where you need to be, so\n\n275\n00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.391\nit's a really good idea to walk through\nthat list, and make sure that if and\n\n276\n00:14:26.391 --> 00:14:29.470\nwhen you are setting this up\nthat you only get what you have.\n\n277\n00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:30.780\nBecause otherwise, like Mike said,\n\n278\n00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:33.580\nyou're just eating up disk space for\nno good reason.\n\n279\n00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.740\n>> For no good reason.\nAll right,\n\n280\n00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.410\nnow the other thing we'll look\nat the classifications tab,\n\n281\n00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:38.580\ndifferent levels of updates.\n\n282\n00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.290\nWhat do you want?\nDo you want critical updates,\n\n283\n00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:41.730\ndo you want security updates?\n\n284\n00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:44.900\nDo you want to include service packs,\nwhat about updates and roll-ups?\n\n285\n00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.070\nYou know Microsoft's different\nclassifications for the different.\n\n286\n00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:50.330\nType of updates that they're putting out,\n\n287\n00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:53.640\nI've limited here to just\ncritical definition updates.\n\n288\n00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:57.650\nThat would be like windows defender\nupdates, and then security updates.\n\n289\n00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.180\nReal world, i'm sure I'd want to get\nservice packs, and some of those.\n\n290\n00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:05.010\nAgain, a great way to test\nthose before you roll them out\n\n291\n00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:06.510\nto the rest of the network.\n\n292\n00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:09.140\nSo you've choosed your products and\nclassifications.\n\n293\n00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:12.400\nYou also wanna pay attention to\nyour update files and languages.\n\n294\n00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.170\nYou can choose to download the updates and\nstore them locally, and\n\n295\n00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:17.810\nthat's typically what\nmost organizations do.\n\n296\n00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:20.150\nBecause one advantage of that is the fact,\n\n297\n00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:24.430\nif i'm storing them locally, when all\nthose machines are downloading the updates\n\n298\n00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:27.320\nthey're not all going out to Microsoft,\ngoing across the WAN.\n\n299\n00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:32.040\nThey're staying on my Local Area Network\ntalking to my server, and\n\n300\n00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:35.510\nif you've got hundreds or thousands of\nmachines all downloading the exact.\n\n301\n00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:40.160\nExact same update a thousand times from\nMicrosoft, it's a waste of bandwidth.\n\n302\n00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.480\nAnd typically that happens\nat 3:00 in the morning, and\n\n303\n00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.210\nmaybe you're not all\nthat worried about it.\n\n304\n00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:45.615\nBut maybe other things are going on,\n\n305\n00:15:45.615 --> 00:15:47.895\nI've got backup procedures\nthat are running at that time.\n\n306\n00:15:47.895 --> 00:15:50.260\nI've got a lot of things\nthat are using my updates,\n\n307\n00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.352\nthe last thing I need is updates\nsucking up some of that bandwidth.\n\n308\n00:15:53.352 --> 00:15:55.373\nSo I'd choose to store them locally.\n\n309\n00:15:55.373 --> 00:15:58.950\nI download them from Microsoft,\nmy machines get them from me.\n\n310\n00:15:58.950 --> 00:15:59.710\nI don't have to, though.\n\n311\n00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:04.250\nIf disk space is an issue and you still\nwanna have the ability to approve and\n\n312\n00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:07.580\ndisapprove updates, but\nnot store them locally, you don't have to.\n\n313\n00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.920\nYou can say do not store a page locally.\n\n314\n00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.380\nThey'll get them from Microsoft.\n\n315\n00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:14.270\nThey're still gonna check in with\nyour server to see which ones\n\n316\n00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:15.450\nthey're supposed to get.\n\n317\n00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:18.200\nSo you still have control over\nwhat updates are going out but\n\n318\n00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.335\nthey're gonna reach out to Microsoft\nupdate server to download and\n\n319\n00:16:21.335 --> 00:16:22.934\ninstall the updates, all right.\n\n320\n00:16:22.934 --> 00:16:26.000\nLanguages, another big one.\n\n321\n00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.380\nI don't need every single language\nthat Microsoft supports, right?\n\n322\n00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:31.550\nI don't have a lot of machines\nset up on my network,\n\n323\n00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:35.480\njust that are in Estonia,\nso why download updates?\n\n324\n00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:39.220\nAnd, if you check all of these,\nyou have the same update in each and\n\n325\n00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.680\nevery language that Microsoft supports.\n\n326\n00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.820\nAgain, not really necessary.\n\n327\n00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.650\nSo, make sure you choose\nthe appropriate language.\n\n328\n00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.210\nVery important that you set\na synchronization schedule.\n\n329\n00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:53.080\nThis is for the server, not for\nyour clients and your other servers.\n\n330\n00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.380\nThis is for the WSUS server itself.\n\n331\n00:16:55.380 --> 00:17:00.040\nHow often is it going out to Microsoft and\nseeing if there's any new updates, right?\n\n332\n00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.690\nMaybe you do that once a day,\nmaybe you do that once a week, but\n\n333\n00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:07.030\nthis is how the SUS server itself gets\na list of new updates that are available.\n\n334\n00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:10.260\nYou definitely want to set that to\nbe automatic in the real world.\n\n335\n00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:11.380\nOtherwise you're gonna forget.\n\n336\n00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:14.560\nAnd you're gonna go a couple weeks\nwithout getting any updates.\n\n337\n00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.110\nSo set that to automatic in\na production environment.\n\n338\n00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:23.170\nAutomatic approvals,\nyou can setup automatic approvals.\n\n339\n00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:25.570\nWhere when an update comes down,\nif it contains these words,\n\n340\n00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:28.630\nif it has to do with this\noperating system, whatever,\n\n341\n00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:31.930\nyou can say automatically approve\nthe update and let them install it.\n\n342\n00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:33.240\nWell, I tell you, it's not recommended.\n\n343\n00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:37.050\nThe whole reason we're setting\nup WSUS in the first place\n\n344\n00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:40.730\nis to test the update before it goes\nout to every machine on my network.\n\n345\n00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:47.580\nSo automatic approval is really not\nwise when it comes to this, all right?\n\n346\n00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:51.445\nI wouldn't anyway, but otherwise why\nrun WSUS in the first place, right?\n\n347\n00:17:51.445 --> 00:17:53.340\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's see what else.\n\n348\n00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.010\nComputers, this is where\nyou create your groups.\n\n349\n00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:57.430\nAnd you assign computers.\n\n350\n00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:01.440\nWhat's gonna happen is once you tell\nall your computers that you're running\n\n351\n00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.730\nWSUS on your network, they're gonna check\nin with your machine instead of Microsoft.\n\n352\n00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:08.260\nWhen they do check in,\nI can create groups out of them.\n\n353\n00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:11.230\nI can say all right, you belong to\nthis group, you belong to this group.\n\n354\n00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:12.830\nThese are not, don't get them confused,\n\n355\n00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:15.310\nthese are not groups\nwith an active directory.\n\n356\n00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:17.530\nThey're not security groups or\nanything like that.\n\n357\n00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:18.827\nThey're strictly for WSUS.\n\n358\n00:18:18.827 --> 00:18:21.995\nAnd you're gonna have one group\ncalled say, a test group, right,\n\n359\n00:18:21.995 --> 00:18:22.996\nthose canary users,\n\n360\n00:18:22.996 --> 00:18:27.110\nthe one your gonna push the update out to\njust to see if it's gonna cause a problem.\n\n361\n00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:29.270\nTypically some virtual machines.\n\n362\n00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:32.111\nYou might create groups based on OS,\nbased on department.\n\n363\n00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:34.811\nMaybe you wanna push\nout all the updates for\n\n364\n00:18:34.811 --> 00:18:37.811\nthe marketing department on Monday night,\nbut\n\n365\n00:18:37.811 --> 00:18:43.120\non Tuesday night you're gonna do the dev\nteam machines, right, or whatever.\n\n366\n00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.310\nYou have full control.\n\n367\n00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:46.170\nThat's what's so cool about this.\n\n368\n00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:48.010\nNow how do those computers\nget in the groups?\n\n369\n00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:49.110\nWell, you can use group policy.\n\n370\n00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:53.710\nAnd you can say any computer that belongs\nto this OU, or is a member of this group,\n\n371\n00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:58.320\nis automatically going to be added\nto this group within WSUS, or\n\n372\n00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.830\nI can do it manually.\n\n373\n00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:04.350\nWhen the computer first reports in,\nit's gonna show up under Unspecified, and\n\n374\n00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:06.279\nI can just manually add it to the group.\n\n375\n00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:09.140\nI'll go ahead and click OK on that.\n\n376\n00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:13.498\nThe rest of these, good to go through,\nthese cleanup and things like that.\n\n377\n00:19:13.498 --> 00:19:15.980\nIf you got time and\nyou want to play around, check those out.\n\n378\n00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.075\nProbably not gonna be on the exam, but\n\n379\n00:19:18.075 --> 00:19:21.295\nnow that I said that you'll get\na question on one of those.\n\n380\n00:19:21.295 --> 00:19:24.508\nSo thumb through those other\noptions just to double check.\n\n381\n00:19:24.508 --> 00:19:28.080\nThe server cleanup wizard does rock\na little bit, I'm not gonna lie.\n\n382\n00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.770\nBecause you tend to keep around,\n\n383\n00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:33.780\nyou got a bunch of old updates, that's\nwhat that server cleanup wizard is for.\n\n384\n00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:37.690\nYou walk through that and say, anything\nolder from this time to this time on these\n\n385\n00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:40.680\ncomputers, just get rid of it\ncuz we're not using it anymore.\n\n386\n00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.170\nWe're well past that expiration date.\n\n387\n00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:44.330\nNo reason to keep that stuff around.\n\n388\n00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:45.175\n>> Exactly.\nAll right,\n\n389\n00:19:45.175 --> 00:19:49.370\nnow I'm gonna to expand on computers and\nshow you this little bit down here.\n\n390\n00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:53.230\nThere's a group called All Computers, and\nthen there's an Unassigned Computers.\n\n391\n00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:54.040\nAnd the way it works,\n\n392\n00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:58.570\nthe All Computers is the umbrella,\nall computers would belong to that.\n\n393\n00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:01.500\nIf they don't belong to any other group,\nthen they're gonna be a part\n\n394\n00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:05.280\nof the Unassigned Computers, which you can\nsee is nested underneath All Computers.\n\n395\n00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.970\nI'm gonna manually create\na group real quick.\n\n396\n00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:09.899\nI might call this my Test Servers.\n\n397\n00:20:13.543 --> 00:20:19.571\nAll right, and then I might have another\ngroup called my Production Servers.\n\n398\n00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:25.390\nAnd then some groups for client\noperating systems and things like that.\n\n399\n00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:29.360\nAnd what will happen, again,\nis it will show up under unassigned.\n\n400\n00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.980\nAnd then I can move it to\none of these groups, or\n\n401\n00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:35.050\nI might automate that process\nusing group policy, all right.\n\n402\n00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:36.522\nWhen you go to approve an update,\n\n403\n00:20:36.522 --> 00:20:39.440\nall right, let's take a look at\nsome of these critical updates.\n\n404\n00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.250\nYou do wanna be careful\nwith these screens here,\n\n405\n00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:43.820\ncuz it looks like there's\nnothing in my list.\n\n406\n00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:48.910\nWell, it filters by default, approval,\nunapproved, status, failed, or needed.\n\n407\n00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:51.110\nSo it's only gonna show me updates\nthat haven't been approved yet,\n\n408\n00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:54.280\nand that are still needed\nby systems on my network.\n\n409\n00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.600\nWell, one,\nI don't have any systems on my network.\n\n410\n00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.026\nTwo, none of them have reported in so\n\n411\n00:20:58.026 --> 00:20:59.963\nit doesn't know which ones are failed or\nneeded.\n\n412\n00:20:59.963 --> 00:21:03.788\nIf I change this drop down list to any,\nI do a little refresh,\n\n413\n00:21:03.788 --> 00:21:08.070\nI'll see there actually are quite\na few updates out there.\n\n414\n00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:11.260\nAnd if I wanna approve an update,\nI'm gonna just grab one at random.\n\n415\n00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.280\nThis is not a particular\none that I know is needed.\n\n416\n00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:18.160\nI'm gonna choose Approve and\nit opens up this dialogue box here.\n\n417\n00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.660\nAnd what I would do is, I would approve\nit for my test servers, Approve for\n\n418\n00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.390\nInstall and I click OK.\n\n419\n00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:27.500\nAnd then once that finishes,\nwe'll click Close.\n\n420\n00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:28.850\nAnd now I've approved that update.\n\n421\n00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:31.390\nNow it's not gonna go out and\ninstall it automatically.\n\n422\n00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:33.215\nThey still go by their normal schedule,\n\n423\n00:21:33.215 --> 00:21:35.870\nthat servers check in at 3\no clock in the morning and\n\n424\n00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:38.750\nnow it's gonna say, ooh, there's\nan update that i'm supposed to install.\n\n425\n00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:43.780\nAnd it'll go and install this particular\nupdate or whichever ones I've approved.\n\n426\n00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:48.420\nNow once that update's been approved and\nI know it's not causing a problem,\n\n427\n00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:52.310\nI can go back to that update and\nchoose approve again.\n\n428\n00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:56.606\nAnd now approve it, maybe just for\nan individual department or\n\n429\n00:21:56.606 --> 00:22:00.080\nan individual group, or\nmaybe I've decided, you know what?\n\n430\n00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.220\nIt's good enough, it's good for everybody.\n\n431\n00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:05.930\nBecause this is that nested parent group,\nnotice how when I approved it for\n\n432\n00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:08.841\nthat, these other two are automatically\napproved, and it says Inherited.\n\n433\n00:22:08.841 --> 00:22:11.860\nAll right, so you can do it\non individual group basis, or\n\n434\n00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:15.090\nyou can just approve it to all computers,\nand it will inherit down\n\n435\n00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:19.050\nto all the groups that have been\ncreated inside there, all right.\n\n436\n00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:21.230\nSo now it is scheduled for install.\n\n437\n00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:23.239\nA couple of things I'll point\nout about this console, and\n\n438\n00:22:23.239 --> 00:22:25.140\nhen I wanna take a look at\nthe group policy settings.\n\n439\n00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:29.660\nFantastic, as far as\nthe reporting capabilities go.\n\n440\n00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:34.520\nYou do have to download the Microsoft\nReport Viewer, Redistributable, 2008 or\n\n441\n00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.050\nlater.\n\n442\n00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:37.396\nJust a teeny, tiny, little download.\n\n443\n00:22:37.396 --> 00:22:40.403\nIt allows you to open up these\nreports that get generated.\n\n444\n00:22:40.403 --> 00:22:44.480\nAnd they create beautiful reports.\n\n445\n00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:47.175\nI don't think it's gonna show me any here,\nlet's see.\n\n446\n00:22:47.175 --> 00:22:49.960\nNo, it's not cuz I did not download that.\n\n447\n00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.590\nSo it's gonna tell me that I\nneed that redistributable.\n\n448\n00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:55.280\nBut I can kinda see it on\nthis main screen here.\n\n449\n00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.832\nThis is what these reports\nare gonna look like.\n\n450\n00:22:56.832 --> 00:23:01.011\nIt might be over a particular computer,\ndepending on what you run the report on,\n\n451\n00:23:01.011 --> 00:23:02.450\nor a particular update.\n\n452\n00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:04.076\nYou might run a report on an update, and\n\n453\n00:23:04.076 --> 00:23:07.251\nit'll show you, hey, 35 machines\nhave already installed this update.\n\n454\n00:23:07.251 --> 00:23:10.270\n64 of these machines\nstill need this update.\n\n455\n00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:14.780\nAnd these are clickable links when\nthere's actually data in here.\n\n456\n00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.900\nIf you pulled up an update, and\n\n457\n00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.920\nit said 57 machines still need this\nupdate, you can click on that.\n\n458\n00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.780\nIt will show you the 57 machines.\n\n459\n00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:24.630\nYou then click on one of those machines,\nand it'll give you a different\n\n460\n00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:28.730\nreport that shows you all the other\nupdates that machine still needs.\n\n461\n00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:32.930\nBeautiful little pie graphs,\nreally great reporting capabilities.\n\n462\n00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:37.730\nWhy you have to download an additional\ntool to view the reports is beyond\n\n463\n00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:39.730\nme because it's just a few\nmeg little download.\n\n464\n00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:41.310\nI don't know why it's not part of this.\n\n465\n00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:42.167\n>> Above our pay grade, Mike.\n\n466\n00:23:42.167 --> 00:23:42.968\n>> [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n467\n00:23:42.968 --> 00:23:44.805\n>> The great powers that\nbe at Microsoft is,\n\n468\n00:23:44.805 --> 00:23:46.754\nhave decided that's how it's gonna work.\n\n469\n00:23:46.754 --> 00:23:48.193\n>> Exactly, all right, so\n\n470\n00:23:48.193 --> 00:23:52.520\nthe last thing I want to show you is\na couple of these group policy settings.\n\n471\n00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:55.838\nAgain for this exam, I'm not worried if\nyou've memorized where these are at or\n\n472\n00:23:55.838 --> 00:23:56.740\nanything like this.\n\n473\n00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:59.881\nBut we need to understand what SUS\nis all about for this exam, so\n\n474\n00:23:59.881 --> 00:24:01.617\nhopefully you're gaining that.\n\n475\n00:24:01.617 --> 00:24:04.611\nYou're learning that it's a way\nto run a local update server.\n\n476\n00:24:04.611 --> 00:24:09.310\nBut I am gonna show you with on my domain\ncontroller because you can set all\n\n477\n00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:11.940\nthat up, get all that working.\n\n478\n00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:13.710\nIf you don't tell the clients and\n\n479\n00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:16.490\nyour servers to check in\nwith your update server.\n\n480\n00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:17.567\nGuess where they're going?\n\n481\n00:24:17.567 --> 00:24:18.333\n>> Microsoft.\n\n482\n00:24:18.333 --> 00:24:20.920\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right back out to Microsoft, exactly.\n\n483\n00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.870\nSo you're approving updates, you're not\napproving updates, and you're wondering\n\n484\n00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:26.580\nwhy all these updates that you didn't\napprove are getting installed.\n\n485\n00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:30.230\nBecause you forgot to tell them to\ncheck in with your SUS server, right.\n\n486\n00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:34.800\nSo if we come in here and let's see\nI'm just gonna come into ITPro TV,\n\n487\n00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:39.989\nand I'll create a new policy real\nquick and i'll call it WSUS.\n\n488\n00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:46.370\nAnd then I'll go in and\nI'll edit that policy and\n\n489\n00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:50.480\nunderneath computer\nconfiguration policies, Windows,\n\n490\n00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.980\nlet's see if I can remember off\nthe top of my head where that guy is.\n\n491\n00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:56.140\nThat was administrative templates.\n\n492\n00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:59.010\nWindows components, and\n\n493\n00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:02.090\nthen Windows update all the way\ndown here at the bottom, all right?\n\n494\n00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:06.340\nSo I do that quick let me scroll back up\nand show you guys again, this exam I doubt\n\n495\n00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:10.370\nthey're gonna ask you this, but computer\nconfiguration policies, administrative\n\n496\n00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:14.810\ntemplates, Windows components, and then\nall the way down at the bottom of that.\n\n497\n00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:15.890\nWindows Update.\n\n498\n00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:17.460\nAnd out here there's a bunch of settings.\n\n499\n00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:18.920\nSome of them have to do with,\n\n500\n00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:22.280\nlike do you wanna allow standard\nusers to install updates?\n\n501\n00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.840\nShould they be able to reboot the machine?\n\n502\n00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.630\nDo you wanna delay the reboot?\n\n503\n00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:26.300\nThings like that.\n\n504\n00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:29.580\nThere are a few critical ones,\nthough, that you have to set.\n\n505\n00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:34.160\nOne is, specify intranet\nMicrosoft update service location.\n\n506\n00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:38.130\nThis is how you're telling it,\nhey, don't use Microsoft, go here.\n\n507\n00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:40.600\nAnd it is gonna be in the form of a URL.\n\n508\n00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.760\nHttp, in my case svr02.\n\n509\n00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.260\nWhoops.\n\n510\n00:25:47.541 --> 00:25:53.670\nDot, I forgot my domain, .lab.itpro.tv.\n\n511\n00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:54.880\nThere's two options here.\n\n512\n00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.650\nYou'll see that, and\nI'm just kinda gonna cheat, oops.\n\n513\n00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:03.980\nGot things popping up all\nover the place on me.\n\n514\n00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.000\nThere's who do they get\ntheir updates from?\n\n515\n00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:06.980\nThat's what this one is for.\n\n516\n00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:11.280\nThat's gonna be the URL for\nyour WSUS server.\n\n517\n00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.810\nThe second one is who do they report into.\n\n518\n00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:17.240\nRemember, if I've got one SUS server,\nmost likely that's gonna be the same.\n\n519\n00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:22.630\nIf I've got a corporate SUS server, and\nthen several branch office WSUS servers.\n\n520\n00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:24.930\nI might have them checking\nat their local SUS server.\n\n521\n00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:26.510\nThose guys at the branch office.\n\n522\n00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:29.610\nHey, get your updates from the WSUS\nserver that's at that branch.\n\n523\n00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:30.590\nMakes sense.\n\n524\n00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:34.640\nBut when I run my reports,\nI want reports on the entire corporation.\n\n525\n00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:38.140\nSo when they check in for their\nstatistics, maybe I send them back to\n\n526\n00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:42.640\nthe corporate SUS server, instead of the\nSUS server sitting there at their branch.\n\n527\n00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.630\nSo those might be different depending\non how you're setting things up.\n\n528\n00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:49.170\nSo you gotta tell it\nwho the SUS server is,\n\n529\n00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:52.660\nthen you also typically wanna\nconfigure automatic updates.\n\n530\n00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:56.660\nThese are the same settings you would\nsee if you went to your Windows\n\n531\n00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:59.730\nupdate settings on your personal PC,\nor in a server.\n\n532\n00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:03.560\nIf I go to my server and\nI say Windows Update.\n\n533\n00:27:06.001 --> 00:27:08.580\nRight I know that I can\nconfigure my settings.\n\n534\n00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.360\nAnd I can choose things like install\nthem automatically, or download and\n\n535\n00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.390\nI'll tell you when to install them.\n\n536\n00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:18.140\nOr never check for updates is\nwhat I do on my virtual machine,\n\n537\n00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:21.200\nit's to keep him from trying to\ndo crazy stuff in the background.\n\n538\n00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:21.910\nAll right.\n\n539\n00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:26.170\nWell, those same settings are right\nhere in the group policy.\n\n540\n00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:26.940\nBecause guess what?\n\n541\n00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.940\nI don't want to have to go touch each\nmachine and configure these settings.\n\n542\n00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.340\nTypically not gonna happen on a server,\nbut I don't want my user\n\n543\n00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:39.300\nundoing an update setting, saying you know\nwhat I don't want any Windows update.\n\n544\n00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:43.100\nI think I'm smarter than the IT staff and\nMicrosoft.\n\n545\n00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:45.240\nI don't want updates,\nit slows my machine down.\n\n546\n00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.300\nWell if I set it through group policy,\nautomatically download and\n\n547\n00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:52.780\nschedule the install,\nthey're not gonna have a choice.\n\n548\n00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.040\nAnd they're not gonna\nbe able to turn it off.\n\n549\n00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:58.840\nIt's gonna be grayed out if they try to\ngo to those Windows updates settings.\n\n550\n00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.981\nWhat's another one we really need to do?\n\n551\n00:28:00.981 --> 00:28:06.650\nReally those two are the biggest ones,\nthat'll get you started.\n\n552\n00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:09.660\nAgain there's a lot of other settings\nthat we might want to configure\n\n553\n00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:10.840\ndepending on our environment.\n\n554\n00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:14.650\nIt'll be whatever you guys at\nyour place are trying to set up.\n\n555\n00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:16.565\nThings like client side targeting,\n\n556\n00:28:16.565 --> 00:28:20.712\nbeing able to put them in certain groups\nwhen they check in for the group policy.\n\n557\n00:28:20.712 --> 00:28:25.413\nSo those are some of the group policy\nsettings that you would need to work with\n\n558\n00:28:25.413 --> 00:28:28.235\nfor supporting your WSUS server.\n\n559\n00:28:28.235 --> 00:28:32.555\nAnd that, I think, Daniel,\nis probably a good high level overview.\n\n560\n00:28:32.555 --> 00:28:37.400\nRemember, I don't want you focusing too,\nfor this exam, focusing in on\n\n561\n00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:42.360\nconfiguring it as much as understanding\nwhy I would want to run a SUS server.\n\n562\n00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:46.460\nThe fact that I need more\ncontrol over the update process.\n\n563\n00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:49.130\nI want to be able to test updates\n\n564\n00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:51.920\nbefore they get deployed out to\nall the machines on my network.\n\n565\n00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.060\n>> Awesome stuff, Mike.\n\n566\n00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:57.160\nObviously WSUS is not that\ndifficult to implement and explore,\n\n567\n00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:57.940\nplay around with it.\n\n568\n00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:02.990\nIf you've got a server installation\nthat you want to mess around with,\n\n569\n00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:04.480\nyou're studying for these exams.\n\n570\n00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.360\nInstall that role and go ahead and\n\n571\n00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.920\nmess around with it,\nsee what you can get it to do.\n\n572\n00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:11.660\nWalk yourself through a couple\nof the wizards, it's gonna help.\n\n573\n00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:13.570\nYou understand it a little bit better.\n\n574\n00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:17.120\nMike, thanks so much for\nthose descriptions and explanations on\n\n575\n00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:20.720\nhow that actually works and what we\nneed to do to keep our systems updated.\n\n576\n00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.990\nWe're going to go ahead and\nsign off for IT Pro TV.\n\n577\n00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:24.870\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n578\n00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:25.400\n>> And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n579\n00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.940\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n580\n00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:33.220\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.620\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.950\nJoining me today is, well,\nit's Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:21.740\nHow's it going today, Mike?\n\n6\n00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.130\n>> Oh, it's going great, Daniel.\n\n7\n00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.820\nI'm as excited as always.\n\n8\n00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.780\nWe're doing our MGA content and\n\n9\n00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.520\nin this one we're gonna be looking\nat troubleshooting methodology.\n\n10\n00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.440\nWhen we look at troubleshooting,\nwe know that's gonna be a part of our job.\n\n11\n00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.600\nWhen we get out there, in the IT world,\n\n12\n00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.130\nespecially as we work our way\nup from that help desk on up.\n\n13\n00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.823\nBut it doesn't stop there,\nas an MCSA, as an MCSE,\n\n14\n00:00:41.823 --> 00:00:45.020\nyou will still find yourself\ndoing troubleshooting.\n\n15\n00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.400\nSo its important that we\nunderstand some best practices\n\n16\n00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.970\nwhen it comes to troubleshooting and the\nfirst thing we really need to talk about\n\n17\n00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.770\ndown here is just making sure that we\nhave some kind of process in place.\n\n18\n00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.270\nWhat we don't wanna do is take what we\ncall the shotgun approach where you're\n\n19\n00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.330\njust throwing stuff at it and you're just\nhoping that you hit what the problem is.\n\n20\n00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.010\nWhile you might solve the problem that\nway, it's not gonna be a very efficient or\n\n21\n00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.530\neffective way of going about it.\n\n22\n00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.086\n>> We call that the Ronnie Wong\nmethod of troubleshooting.\n\n23\n00:01:14.086 --> 00:01:15.070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] It's\n\n24\n00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.550\nhis favorite approach is like,\nI'm just gonna throw everything and\n\n25\n00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.660\nthe kitchen sink at this and\nhope something sticks.\n\n26\n00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.240\nAnd, like Mike said, that might work.\n\n27\n00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.535\nBut it's not the most efficient [LAUGH]\nway of dealing with your issue.\n\n28\n00:01:26.535 --> 00:01:29.598\nYou wanna try to come at\nit in a more methodical,\n\n29\n00:01:29.598 --> 00:01:34.590\nsystematic approach that tends to lend\nyou or lead you in a better direction.\n\n30\n00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.740\nYou tend to find solutions quicker, faster\nand better using that type of approach.\n\n31\n00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.320\n>> Absolutely.\n\n32\n00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.940\nSo you might work for an organization that\nhas a very specific process that you're\n\n33\n00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.230\nsupposed to go through or you might end\nup developing your own process, it really\n\n34\n00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.820\ndoesn't matter in the end, I mean if you\nwork for a company you better use theirs.\n\n35\n00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.950\nThey might not like you\ncoming up with your own.\n\n36\n00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.770\nBut understanding what that process\nis that you need to go through,\n\n37\n00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.341\nand then repeating that process until it\nbecomes something that you do by habit.\n\n38\n00:02:04.341 --> 00:02:08.473\nAgain, that shotgun method might work in\na SOHO where you just got a few computers,\n\n39\n00:02:08.473 --> 00:02:12.429\na problem here, a problem there, but\nwhen you get into a larger environment and\n\n40\n00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:15.463\nyou're at a help desk and\nthat phone doesn't stop ringing.\n\n41\n00:02:15.463 --> 00:02:19.960\nI mean, when you have 1,000,\n2,000, 10,000 clients and\n\n42\n00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.130\n10,000 users, it's not gonna stop ringing.\n\n43\n00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.260\nIt's not like you're\never gonna get caught up.\n\n44\n00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.050\nSo you have to be able to take\nthat next ticket in the queue.\n\n45\n00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.280\nGo through your procedure that your\ncompany has laid out for you and\n\n46\n00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.130\nwork through it.\n\n47\n00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.280\nAnd you just follow it.\n\n48\n00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.090\nIt's gonna have something\nin there that defines\n\n49\n00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.330\nlike how long you should spend on that.\n\n50\n00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.810\nNow, I'm only allowed to troubleshoot\nthis issue for 30 minutes and\n\n51\n00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.150\nif I can't get it fixed, then I'm supposed\nto escalate it up to the next level or\n\n52\n00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.085\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n53\n00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:52.835\nSo within those procedures you're\ngonna find best practices.\n\n54\n00:02:52.835 --> 00:02:56.595\nYou can also find lots of best\npractices out there online,\n\n55\n00:02:56.595 --> 00:02:59.595\nif your company doesn't provide\nany in a smaller environment.\n\n56\n00:02:59.595 --> 00:03:03.967\nBut I can almost guarantee, you get into a\nlarger environment, they are going to have\n\n57\n00:03:03.967 --> 00:03:08.218\nguidelines, best practices, procedures\nthat you need to follow as you go through\n\n58\n00:03:08.218 --> 00:03:11.704\nit, and it makes sense, because,\nagain, I need to be efficient.\n\n59\n00:03:11.704 --> 00:03:15.706\nI've gotta get through those tickets as\nquickly as I can because I've got users at\n\n60\n00:03:15.706 --> 00:03:17.690\nthe other end that might not be working.\n\n61\n00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.206\nThey might not be able to do their job and\nmake our company money, which, in turn,\n\n62\n00:03:22.206 --> 00:03:23.264\npays my paycheck.\n\n63\n00:03:23.264 --> 00:03:26.451\nSo we [LAUGH] gotta be able to get\nthrough these things efficiently, and\n\n64\n00:03:26.451 --> 00:03:29.230\nget them back up and\nrunning as quickly as possible.\n\n65\n00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.949\nAnd sometimes you don't fix the problem.\n\n66\n00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:33.570\nWe were talking about that earlier,\nDaniel,\n\n67\n00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.170\nhow it's not always that\nwe fix the problem.\n\n68\n00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.990\nSometimes we decide that, you know what?\n\n69\n00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.190\nIt's easier just to reimage this thing and\nget it back to work.\n\n70\n00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.505\n>> Yeah, yeah, no need to spend a bunch of\nsuperfluous time trying to get something\n\n71\n00:03:45.505 --> 00:03:49.570\nthat may even be simple but\nit's just eluding you for whatever reason.\n\n72\n00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.639\nAs I've worked on help desk and\ntop tier support,\n\n73\n00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:57.386\nwe had the mandate down from on high that\nsaid, if you spent more than an hour,\n\n74\n00:03:57.386 --> 00:04:00.480\nan hour and a half on something,\njust reimage it.\n\n75\n00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.620\nIt's faster just to have them a new PC\nshipped out, because well, in most shops,\n\n76\n00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.860\nyou've got a image and everybody is\nrunning the exact same hardware,\n\n77\n00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.760\nthey all need the exact same software so\nwe just have a image that has all that.\n\n78\n00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.700\nYou put it on another computer and\n\n79\n00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.390\nyou send it out to them you\nknow that one is gonna work.\n\n80\n00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.410\nI don't know what they done to their\ncomputer but it's sure jacked up,\n\n81\n00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.380\nsend me the jacked up one and I will send\nyou one that ain't having a problem, and\n\n82\n00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.250\nthen we'll fix that one\nhere by reimaging it.\n\n83\n00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.070\nAnd then, it'll be ready for\nsomebody else.\n\n84\n00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.630\nSo if you're spending too much time\non one topic, it could just be that,\n\n85\n00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.870\nit's time to set this to the side.\n\n86\n00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.420\nLet's get you back and being productive.\n\n87\n00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.150\nThat's our main goal.\n\n88\n00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.403\n>> Yeah. Exactly. And it might be that we\nescalate the problem to somebody else and\n\n89\n00:04:41.403 --> 00:04:44.990\nthey can spend the time doing their\nresearch, figuring out what happened,\n\n90\n00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.190\nhow to prevent it.\n\n91\n00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.860\nBut our job is just to get\nthat system up and running and\n\n92\n00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.050\nget it back in circulation,\nget those people being productive.\n\n93\n00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.230\nAnd because we,\n\n94\n00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.060\nbecause of the technologies that\nwe use in most networks today.\n\n95\n00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.820\nFolder redirection, cloud services,\ndistributed file systems, and\n\n96\n00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:03.920\nthings like this.\n\n97\n00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.580\nWe really shouldn't have, most companies\nhave policies in place that say,\n\n98\n00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.998\nnothing gets stored\nlocally on your system.\n\n99\n00:05:09.998 --> 00:05:12.410\nCuz you think,well,\nhow can you just reimage their machine,\n\n100\n00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.050\nwhat about all their stuff?\n\n101\n00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.650\nIt's not stored locally,\nthat's up on file servers.\n\n102\n00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.710\nSo as soon as I reimage the machine and\nsend it back to them,\n\n103\n00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.340\nthey log on, their profile gets copied\ndown, all their documents are either in\n\n104\n00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.860\nsome kinda cloud service or\nsome kinda folder redirection.\n\n105\n00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.280\nSo hopefully,\nthey didn't lose anything at all.\n\n106\n00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.410\nSo again, I wanna make sure\nthat you develop a process,\n\n107\n00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:34.530\nyour company has a process.\n\n108\n00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.709\nAnd just follow those best practices that\nhave been developed over time by your\n\n109\n00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:39.608\norganization.\n\n110\n00:05:39.608 --> 00:05:43.464\nAnd the other cool end result of doing\nthings like this is that we can,\n\n111\n00:05:43.464 --> 00:05:47.387\nit's a good way to say,\nif we're doing our documentation properly,\n\n112\n00:05:47.387 --> 00:05:51.442\nwe'll end up with this huge thing of\nproblems and what the problem was and\n\n113\n00:05:51.442 --> 00:05:55.460\nhow we went about fixing it,\nwhat approach we use and things like that.\n\n114\n00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.560\nAnd I didn't have to do any\nresearch at that point.\n\n115\n00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.890\nI find that problem in the book and\nI'm like, oh, this is it.\n\n116\n00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.000\nBam, bam, bam.\n\n117\n00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.330\nAnd we're back in business.\n\n118\n00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.620\nSo following those best\npractice is crucial\n\n119\n00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.010\nto being a very efficient troubleshooter.\n\n120\n00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.746\nNow, they do mention on the objectives\na couple different specific, or\n\n121\n00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:15.606\nI shouldn't say specific cuz that's\nthe word we're gonna use here some,\n\n122\n00:06:15.606 --> 00:06:17.213\ncan't think of a worded here.\n\n123\n00:06:17.213 --> 00:06:17.779\n>> Pointed?\n\n124\n00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:18.314\n>> Pointed!\n\n125\n00:06:18.314 --> 00:06:21.294\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] There are different methodology\n\n126\n00:06:21.294 --> 00:06:24.700\nthat you can go out and\nfind if you do some researching.\n\n127\n00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.587\nAnd your company might or might not\nimplement these methodologies, but\n\n128\n00:06:27.587 --> 00:06:29.109\nthey call a couple out in particular.\n\n129\n00:06:29.109 --> 00:06:32.363\nThe two they call out,\nthe systematic approach,\n\n130\n00:06:32.363 --> 00:06:35.020\nas well as the specific approach.\n\n131\n00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.630\nAnd when you talk about\na systematic approach,\n\n132\n00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.930\nwe have a set of steps that we go through.\n\n133\n00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.720\nFor example, let's talk about, for\nan example, let's use connectivity,\n\n134\n00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.240\nInternet connectivity.\n\n135\n00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.208\nMost of us have learned at the A+ level\nof somewhere down there a good, or\n\n136\n00:06:51.208 --> 00:06:52.170\na Network Plus,\n\n137\n00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:56.450\na good troubleshooting systematic\napproach for connectivity issues.\n\n138\n00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.010\nWe open up a command prompt and\nwe do an IP config and\n\n139\n00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.800\nwe verify our TCP/IP configuration.\n\n140\n00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.034\nAnd then, we break out ping and\nwe ping the loop back adapter.\n\n141\n00:07:04.034 --> 00:07:05.600\nAnd then, we work our way out.\n\n142\n00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.920\nWe ping our own IP address, and\nthen we ping the default gateway, and\n\n143\n00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.890\nthen we ping something remote to us,\n\n144\n00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:15.080\nsomething on a different network,\nwe follow that systematic approach,\n\n145\n00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.000\neven if I'm pretty sure that\nthe problem is that network cable.\n\n146\n00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:21.210\nI'm gonna follow my approach so\n\n147\n00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:24.550\nthat I can get to the root of the problem,\nfigure out what it is.\n\n148\n00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.080\nThat would be a systematic approach.\n\n149\n00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:31.490\nYou don't do any guessing,\nyou don't do any theorizing, you follow\n\n150\n00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:36.590\na predetermined or preset order of steps\nto figure out what the problem is.\n\n151\n00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:42.560\nWhich is very efficient and this is\nwhat we'll complain about all the time.\n\n152\n00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.670\nHave you ever called your\ncable service provider?\n\n153\n00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:47.662\nAnd you can tell the person\nis reading from a book.\n\n154\n00:07:47.662 --> 00:07:49.213\nAnd their asking you these questions.\n\n155\n00:07:49.213 --> 00:07:52.682\nAnd you've already told them, hey,\nlook, I'm okay with IT stuff.\n\n156\n00:07:52.682 --> 00:07:53.848\nI kinda know what I'm talking about, and\n\n157\n00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:55.997\nI'm pretty sure you're having a problem\non your end, blah, blah, blah.\n\n158\n00:07:55.997 --> 00:07:57.901\nAnd they're like, well, let's do this.\n\n159\n00:07:57.901 --> 00:07:59.921\nHave you rebooted your computer?\n\n160\n00:07:59.921 --> 00:08:01.314\nHave you, and that kind of thing.\n\n161\n00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:03.544\nThey're following a system.\n\n162\n00:08:03.544 --> 00:08:06.798\nSystematic approach, because that's\na very efficient way to do it,\n\n163\n00:08:06.798 --> 00:08:10.441\nespecially when the information gathering\nprocess might be varied depending\n\n164\n00:08:10.441 --> 00:08:13.660\non the skill level of the person\nthat's calling in with the problem.\n\n165\n00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.150\nAnother approach, though,\nis a specific approach.\n\n166\n00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.486\nAnd this is one where you\nkinda do take a guess.\n\n167\n00:08:19.486 --> 00:08:24.076\nSo you think, okay with my experience and\nmy knowledge of what's going on right now,\n\n168\n00:08:24.076 --> 00:08:28.100\nI'm pretty sure that we're having\na problem with that router.\n\n169\n00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:32.530\nI'm gonna skip pinging the loop back\naddress, pinging the network adapter, and\n\n170\n00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.280\nthen pinging that default gateway.\n\n171\n00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.290\nI'm gonna jump right to what\nI think the problem is.\n\n172\n00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:41.730\nAnd start my troubleshooting there, which\nis also a relatively efficient method,\n\n173\n00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.740\nespecially when you know the network,\nright?\n\n174\n00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:47.370\nIn this case, if it's my network,\nand I've set this thing up, or\n\n175\n00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:50.890\nI've worked on the help desk for\na while, I know the network.\n\n176\n00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:52.570\nThat's not a bad approach either.\n\n177\n00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:54.950\nBoth of them have their pros and cons.\n\n178\n00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.392\nAnd they kinda fit into\ndifferent environments.\n\n179\n00:08:56.392 --> 00:08:59.020\n>> Yeah,\nit really boils down to experience level.\n\n180\n00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.650\nThe people with the less experience,\n\n181\n00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:03.640\nwhat's gonna serve them best\nis that systematic approach.\n\n182\n00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.860\nThat's gonna be their bread and butter.\n\n183\n00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.190\nThat's what they're gonna go to, because\nthey know each step has been followed.\n\n184\n00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:11.860\nThey know that that's not the problem,\nuntil they actually find what is.\n\n185\n00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.840\nPeople with more experience, maybe like\nMike and I here that have done this for\n\n186\n00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.230\na little while,\nyou kind of start seeing patterns, so\n\n187\n00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.060\nyou can use the specific approach.\n\n188\n00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.020\nNot that we'll never use the systematic\napproach, we probably will.\n\n189\n00:09:24.035 --> 00:09:26.300\nEspecially when we come up to\na problem where we're going,\n\n190\n00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.808\nwow this is a real head scratcher here.\n\n191\n00:09:27.808 --> 00:09:30.528\nI'm not familiar, what's going on?\n\n192\n00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:32.630\nSo then we'll employ\nthat systematic approach.\n\n193\n00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.260\nSo you can use both.\n\n194\n00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.220\nIt's fine to do so, but\n\n195\n00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:40.000\njust be aware of why one person\nwould use one over the other.\n\n196\n00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:40.860\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n197\n00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.640\nAnd it also has to deal with\nusually the size of your support.\n\n198\n00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.910\nLike if it's you and\nonly you in a small shop or something,\n\n199\n00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.160\nthat specific approach is probably the\nquickest way to get the problem solved.\n\n200\n00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.100\nBecause you can say,\nall right this is what I think it is,\n\n201\n00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.600\nI'm gonna dive right into it.\n\n202\n00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.720\nWhen you've got that tier one,\nthat tier two,\n\n203\n00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:01.015\nthat tier three support, it's important\nthat I know, if I'm working tier two,\n\n204\n00:10:01.015 --> 00:10:07.020\nif that problem gets escalated to me, I\nknow that tier one has already done this,\n\n205\n00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:10.280\nthis, this, this, and this, and\nI don't have to worry about that, right?\n\n206\n00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.010\nBecause we're following\nthat systematic approach.\n\n207\n00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:13.470\nThose have been checked off.\n\n208\n00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:17.200\nAnd I can begin my troubleshooting\nat that point, and move on.\n\n209\n00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.400\nWhereas if they didn't do\nthe systematic approach and\n\n210\n00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:23.230\nthey escalated to me, I almost have\nto start over cuz I don't know\n\n211\n00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.640\nwhat they did in their troubleshooting,\nright.\n\n212\n00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.771\nSo those are just a couple methods.\n\n213\n00:10:27.771 --> 00:10:28.960\nThere are others.\n\n214\n00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.030\nWe talked about the shotgun approach.\n\n215\n00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.550\nSo, different things you can do there.\n\n216\n00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:33.542\n>> There's the wrong approach.\n\n217\n00:10:33.542 --> 00:10:35.362\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's always a good one.\n\n218\n00:10:35.362 --> 00:10:36.462\n>> That's a good one to try.\n\n219\n00:10:36.462 --> 00:10:40.442\n[LAUGH] And\nthen something else they call out here.\n\n220\n00:10:40.442 --> 00:10:43.323\nThere's lots of documentation\nout there that deals with\n\n221\n00:10:43.323 --> 00:10:45.790\ntroubleshooting methodologies.\n\n222\n00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:48.290\nThere's a library, I say a library,\n\n223\n00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:51.910\na set of volumes that gets published\ncalled ITIL and I have to look.\n\n224\n00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:55.960\nThat's the Information Technology\nInfrastructure Library.\n\n225\n00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:00.630\nAnd these are a set of volumes that\nget published that are organization\n\n226\n00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.250\nindependent, right?\n\n227\n00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:06.800\nThat define processes, procedures,\ntasks and checklists for\n\n228\n00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:14.030\nmaking sure that my IT kind of supports\nand follows my business plans.\n\n229\n00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:17.410\nIt makes for some good light reading.\n\n230\n00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:21.080\nIt's actually a good health benefit for\nthose of you out there.\n\n231\n00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:25.520\nIt will cure even the most\nincurable insomniacs.\n\n232\n00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.580\nIt'll put you right to sleep.\n\n233\n00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.440\n>> Absolutely.\n\n234\n00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:33.130\nBut it is a big help for organizations\nthat are, what's a good way to say it?\n\n235\n00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.780\nThey wanna make sure that\nyou can prove compliance\n\n236\n00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:38.780\nby following the procedures\nthat are laid out here.\n\n237\n00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:43.175\nSo if you've got organizational, industry,\ngovernment type regulations, HIPAA,\n\n238\n00:11:43.175 --> 00:11:48.560\nSarbanes-Oxley, things like that, this\nkind of defines methodologies you can use,\n\n239\n00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.830\nbut it's general, right.\n\n240\n00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:54.720\nIt's not specific to any organization,\nso it's a great starting point for\n\n241\n00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.750\na lot of these IT staffs that need\nto develop their policies and\n\n242\n00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:01.030\nprocedures and don't know where to start.\n\n243\n00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:04.330\nSo it's a great reference, the Information\nTechnology Infrastructure Library.\n\n244\n00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.234\nAll right, so other things we're gonna\ntalk about with troubleshooting.\n\n245\n00:12:08.234 --> 00:12:11.706\nWell we got past our methodologies and\nthings like that, now we're gonna take\n\n246\n00:12:11.706 --> 00:12:15.160\na look at some of the thing that\nwe can do in our operating system.\n\n247\n00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.890\nSome of these we've already\nseen in previous episodes, so\n\n248\n00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:22.150\nwe'll just kinda show them here and\ntalk a little bit about them, but\n\n249\n00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.520\nthen we got a couple things\nthat we haven't seen before,\n\n250\n00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.860\nthat we were holding on until the very\nend, we'll show you those as well.\n\n251\n00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:31.270\nSo the first thing I want to talk\nabout is good old Performance Monitor.\n\n252\n00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.968\nAnd I know we've seen this a few times.\n\n253\n00:12:33.968 --> 00:12:36.530\nSo the first tool we're going to look\nat is the little Performance Monitor.\n\n254\n00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:38.760\nWe've seen this in a couple\nof other episodes.\n\n255\n00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.580\nI'll go ahead and launch Perfmon.\n\n256\n00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.750\nAnd when it comes to troubleshooting,\n\n257\n00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:47.690\nif you're troubleshooting a performance\nissue, servers being sluggish or\n\n258\n00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:51.000\nunresponsive or slow,\nthis is a great place to start, right?\n\n259\n00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.800\nBecause I can come in here and\n\n260\n00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.830\nsee what performance I'm getting\nout of that server, real time.\n\n261\n00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:00.250\nRemember we've got our data collector\nsets that we talked about earlier, for\n\n262\n00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:02.010\ncreating our baselines.\n\n263\n00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:05.460\nIf I'm troubleshooting, well now I\nneed to capture real time information,\n\n264\n00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.690\nI need to see what's\ngoing on in real time and\n\n265\n00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:10.930\ncompare it back to those\nbaselines we created earlier.\n\n266\n00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.400\nSo we come back in here and\nwe add those counters, and\n\n267\n00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:17.720\nwe see what's going on right now,\nso that's a great place to start.\n\n268\n00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:21.160\nAnother place we might go,\nwould be, Resource Monitor.\n\n269\n00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:25.120\nNow if I fire up good\nold Resource Monitor,\n\n270\n00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:28.380\nI get real time performance information,\nI can look for\n\n271\n00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:33.150\na particular application or process that's\ntaking up all of a particular resource,\n\n272\n00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:38.710\nmaybe it's consuming all my CPU or\ngot an application that's taking\n\n273\n00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:44.080\nup all the RAM that I have in the system,\nthis would be a good place to for that.\n\n274\n00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.520\nSo we've got these tools and,\nagain, we've seen them in others.\n\n275\n00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:50.030\nJust want to make sure that we think about\nthese when we're troubleshooting, right.\n\n276\n00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:52.867\nDon't think of them as\njust creating baselines or\n\n277\n00:13:52.867 --> 00:13:57.470\nwhat have you, these are good tools to\ngo and use when you're troubleshooting.\n\n278\n00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:59.975\nNow what we haven't spent\na lot of time in and\n\n279\n00:13:59.975 --> 00:14:04.470\nthat's what were going to focus on today,\nis going to be the event log system.\n\n280\n00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:09.379\nEvery Windows machine has the event\nlog system and this is where our\n\n281\n00:14:09.379 --> 00:14:14.390\nsystem records events, things that\nare going on both good and bad.\n\n282\n00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:20.090\nAnd a lot of people forget\nabout the event log system.\n\n283\n00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:22.348\nI don't if they're using\nit way back in the day.\n\n284\n00:14:22.348 --> 00:14:26.302\nI mean if we go back to Windows 2000,\nI will give you, the event log system was\n\n285\n00:14:26.302 --> 00:14:29.792\na little frustrating, because\nthe events that you would see in there,\n\n286\n00:14:29.792 --> 00:14:32.088\nthey wouldn't give you\na lot of information.\n\n287\n00:14:32.088 --> 00:14:35.435\nThey would give you some hex code or\nsomething like that,\n\n288\n00:14:35.435 --> 00:14:37.396\nit just wouldn't tell you a lot.\n\n289\n00:14:37.396 --> 00:14:39.748\nSo a lot of people got used\nto kinda not going there,\n\n290\n00:14:39.748 --> 00:14:41.948\nnot even bothering with\nthe event log systems.\n\n291\n00:14:41.948 --> 00:14:42.870\nThey've redone it.\n\n292\n00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:47.910\nI mean they've done a great job and\nnot just for 2008, it's been a progress\n\n293\n00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:52.120\nas the newer versions of the OS have\ncome out, but it's come a long way.\n\n294\n00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.850\nSo if you're new to this,\nI'm gonna show you how cool it is.\n\n295\n00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:58.470\nIf you've been doing this for a while,\ngo back and look at the event log system.\n\n296\n00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:00.908\nThey've really done\nsome good improvements.\n\n297\n00:15:00.908 --> 00:15:02.508\nAll right, so we'll fire it up first.\n\n298\n00:15:02.508 --> 00:15:05.188\nGood old Event Viewer.\n\n299\n00:15:05.188 --> 00:15:10.030\nAnd if I can type it we'll find it.\n\n300\n00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:14.470\nAnd here we go, so when we look at the\nEvent Viewer we've got some basic logs or\n\n301\n00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:17.440\nwhat they would call maybe\nthe default logs that we can look at.\n\n302\n00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:21.510\nYou've got your application log, this is\nwhere applications can record events.\n\n303\n00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:24.300\nSo if an application is crashing or\nhanging or\n\n304\n00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.800\nunable to launch,\nthis might be a good place to start.\n\n305\n00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.600\nYou've got your security log.\n\n306\n00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.090\nAnd this is where were\ngonna find auditing events.\n\n307\n00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:33.240\nSo if you're doing any auditing,\n\n308\n00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:37.650\nthere is some auditing enabling by default\nlike logons, and things like that.\n\n309\n00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:39.500\nThis is where you'd see those results.\n\n310\n00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:43.087\nThe set-up log doesn't get used a lot,\nas you can see here, but\n\n311\n00:15:43.087 --> 00:15:45.762\nthe operating system can\nrecord events there.\n\n312\n00:15:45.762 --> 00:15:48.925\nWhen you're installing some roles or\ninstalling applications,\n\n313\n00:15:48.925 --> 00:15:50.847\nsometimes they can record events here.\n\n314\n00:15:50.847 --> 00:15:54.182\nThe system logs is where the OS\nitself Is gonna record events,\n\n315\n00:15:54.182 --> 00:15:58.291\nthings that it's doing, starting up\nservices, shutting down services,\n\n316\n00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:03.360\nrunning scheduled tasks, things like that,\nwhich show up in my system log.\n\n317\n00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.285\nSo those are our main logs\nthat we've got to view.\n\n318\n00:16:06.285 --> 00:16:06.910\n[COUGH].\n\n319\n00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:11.910\nNow the cool thing, one of my favorite\nfeatures, maybe not my favorite,\n\n320\n00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.420\nthere's another one that's even cooler.\n\n321\n00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:16.860\nBut one of the really cool\nfeatures that they've added to our\n\n322\n00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.550\nevent log system is this Custom Views.\n\n323\n00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:22.830\nNow, Custom Views\nare a way to do just that,\n\n324\n00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:27.060\ncreate a view that shows just what\nyou need, just what you want to see.\n\n325\n00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.080\nWhen I look at this application log, and\n\n326\n00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.850\nthis is a virtual machine that hasn't been\nrunning that long, we've got 196 events.\n\n327\n00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:36.839\nWhen I look at my system log over here,\nI've got 1,091.\n\n328\n00:16:36.839 --> 00:16:41.554\nIf you go to a production machine,\nnot uncommon to have 10,000 to 20,000,\n\n329\n00:16:41.554 --> 00:16:46.440\n100,000 events depending on how often\nyou go back and clear these logs.\n\n330\n00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:50.383\nSo finding the important information,\nfinding what's pertinent to you,\n\n331\n00:16:50.383 --> 00:16:51.190\ncan be tricky.\n\n332\n00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:54.830\nI'm not gonna sit here and just scroll,\nscroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll,\n\n333\n00:16:54.830 --> 00:17:00.590\nscroll because I might have missed that\nerror that I saw scroll by there, right?\n\n334\n00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:01.930\nMaybe I didn't catch that.\n\n335\n00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:06.710\nSo Custom Views allow me to do just that,\ncreate my own custom view.\n\n336\n00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:12.020\nSo what I can do is right-click on Custom\nViews and choose Create Custom View.\n\n337\n00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:14.980\nIt opens up this really handy dialog box.\n\n338\n00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:20.640\nAnd the first thing I can pick is Logged,\nand when it's gonna be logged.\n\n339\n00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.640\nIf my job is to come in every morning and\n\n340\n00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.450\ncheck the log files on this server,\nthen I'm doing that everyday.\n\n341\n00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:30.670\nDo I really need to see more\nthan the last 24 hours, right?\n\n342\n00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:33.890\nI come in in the morning, I want to see\nwhat's occurred since the last time I\n\n343\n00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:35.352\ncame in, since yesterday morning.\n\n344\n00:17:35.352 --> 00:17:39.230\nI've seen all those events,\njust show me the last 24 hours, right.\n\n345\n00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:41.510\nSo you can filter down by time.\n\n346\n00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:42.990\nYou can also choose the event level.\n\n347\n00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:47.430\nYou know what, informations are great,\nbut when I'm troubleshooting things in\n\n348\n00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:49.950\nthe morning, when I come in to see what's\ngone wrong in the middle of the night or\n\n349\n00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:54.020\nanything like that, I just need to\nsee critical errors and warnings.\n\n350\n00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:56.240\nI'm not worried about\ninformation at this point.\n\n351\n00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.380\nBy log, this is where it gets really cool.\n\n352\n00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.940\nI can select more than one log.\n\n353\n00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:06.100\nI don't have to, cuz here I gotta\nlook at the application log and\n\n354\n00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:09.010\nthen look at the security log and\nthen look at the system log.\n\n355\n00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:11.910\nNow I can say, hey,\nshow me the criticals, warnings, and\n\n356\n00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:15.735\nerrors that have occurred in the last 24\nhours from all three of those log files.\n\n357\n00:18:15.735 --> 00:18:19.320\nOr maybe my job has nothing\nto do with auditing,\n\n358\n00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.290\nand I just wanna see applications and\nsystem events.\n\n359\n00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.750\nSo you can pick the log,\nyou can pick multiple logs.\n\n360\n00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:28.440\nYou can do some more filters down here,\nlike maybe you're looking for\n\n361\n00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.480\na particular event ID or a range of IDs.\n\n362\n00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:36.420\nYou can do categories,\nkeywords, filtered by users, so\n\n363\n00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.440\nlots of really neat things\nI can do with this.\n\n364\n00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:43.620\nI click OK, and I'm gonna give it a name,\n\n365\n00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:47.923\nand I'll say, Daily Log Review.\n\n366\n00:18:47.923 --> 00:18:48.990\nAnd I'll click OK.\n\n367\n00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:51.280\nAnd there we go.\n\n368\n00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.950\nI've got my new filter,\nand I can say, look,\n\n369\n00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.190\nI've only got three events\nthat I have to worry about.\n\n370\n00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:57.750\nSo instead of looking at\na couple thousand entries,\n\n371\n00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:01.090\nI can focus on just these guys right here,\nright?\n\n372\n00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:03.940\nSo a great way to filter down,\nand it doesn't remove anything.\n\n373\n00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:08.883\nAll the actual events are still in these\nlogs, this was just a filtered view.\n\n374\n00:19:08.883 --> 00:19:11.590\nNow, let's say I need to do\nthis on more than one server.\n\n375\n00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:16.772\nAnother really handy feature here is\nbeing able to export these views.\n\n376\n00:19:16.772 --> 00:19:19.780\nI can come down here and\nfind my option here.\n\n377\n00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:25.050\nThere we go, Export Custom View.\n\n378\n00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:29.650\nAnd for this demo I'm just gonna dump it\nout on my desktop, and I'm gonna call it\n\n379\n00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:36.030\nsomething like My Daily Review.\n\n380\n00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:36.900\nAnd I'll click Save.\n\n381\n00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:42.015\nAnd if I go look at my desktop,\nthere it is.\n\n382\n00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:44.920\nExported data's an XML file.\n\n383\n00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:49.620\nI could put that up in a share somewhere,\nand then I could go to another server, and\n\n384\n00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.080\nI could copy that down.\n\n385\n00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:57.580\nCome up to Custom Ciews, Import Custom\nView, and browse and find that guy.\n\n386\n00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:00.740\nNow, it's gonna scream at me because I've\nalready got one with the same name, but\n\n387\n00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:02.760\nI'll go ahead and click Open there.\n\n388\n00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:06.370\nAnd I'll just change this up,\nI'll just take out the word there.\n\n389\n00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:07.320\nWe'll click OK.\n\n390\n00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.430\nAnd there we go.\n\n391\n00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:11.480\nSo I've just taken that custom view\nthat I built on one machine and\n\n392\n00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.310\nI've imported it into another machine, so\n\n393\n00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:17.350\nnow when I go to that machine I've\ngot that same great custom view.\n\n394\n00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:19.920\nSo very easy to filter down\nto just what you need.\n\n395\n00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.380\n>> Way to take the fun out of perusing\nthrough a million different event files,\n\n396\n00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:23.902\nMike.\n\n397\n00:20:23.902 --> 00:20:24.776\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, this is a very,\n\n398\n00:20:24.776 --> 00:20:26.240\nvery handy thing to have, right?\n\n399\n00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:31.220\nI remember having to use third-party tools\nto do this back in the day in Server 2003,\n\n400\n00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:32.880\nand before that.\n\n401\n00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.724\nThis is a whole lot nicer because those\ntools, they were difficult to work with.\n\n402\n00:20:36.724 --> 00:20:37.490\n>> [LAUGH] They really were.\n\n403\n00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:39.990\n>> That was not difficult,\nthat was very nice actually.\n\n404\n00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:43.630\n>> Now there are other log files\nthat we should be familiar with.\n\n405\n00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:47.980\nIf you look down below my standard or\ndefault logs, I got these application and\n\n406\n00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.300\nservice logs.\n\n407\n00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.140\nAnd these can get very specific.\n\n408\n00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.720\nHere's a log for Internet Explorer.\n\n409\n00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.390\nIf I expand out Microsoft,\nthen I expand out Windows,\n\n410\n00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:58.690\nyou'll see the list is pretty long.\n\n411\n00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:01.520\nAnd this will change as you\nadd different services, too.\n\n412\n00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:05.893\nIf it's running DNS, or if it's running\nDHCP, you'll see logs for that.\n\n413\n00:21:05.893 --> 00:21:10.380\nOne of the ones I think we showed\nin another episode was this\n\n414\n00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:15.520\ndiagnosis PLA operational log,\nand this is where my alerts went.\n\n415\n00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.180\nWhen we were in\nthe performance monitor and\n\n416\n00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:21.000\nwe created that performance counter alert,\nthis is where they showed up.\n\n417\n00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.910\nSo if you're looking for\ngroup policy issues,\n\n418\n00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:28.010\nyou might come down here and\nfind group policy and look at that.\n\n419\n00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:31.600\nAnd you could include these in\nyour filtered view as well.\n\n420\n00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:39.020\nUp here, back at that filtered view, if I\nedit this guy, if I can get it to do that.\n\n421\n00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:42.160\nWe go into that Properties, Edit Filter.\n\n422\n00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:47.330\nAnd I could have chosen to include\nany of those Microsoft logs, right.\n\n423\n00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:50.450\nI could come through here and\nchoose those same logs there.\n\n424\n00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:54.282\nIf I wanted that diagnosis PLA,\noperational, for example,\n\n425\n00:21:54.282 --> 00:21:59.150\nnow I've just included that log\nin my custom filtered view.\n\n426\n00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:01.250\nSo very cool process.\n\n427\n00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:04.355\nAll right, yeah, and like I said,\nas Daniel kidded around,\n\n428\n00:22:04.355 --> 00:22:06.802\nI mean It's a full-time\njob if you have to sit and\n\n429\n00:22:06.802 --> 00:22:11.008\nperuse each one of those entries cuz, as I\nsaid, this is a teeny tiny logfile here.\n\n430\n00:22:11.008 --> 00:22:13.131\nYou're not gonna get that lucky\nin the production environment.\n\n431\n00:22:13.131 --> 00:22:14.940\n>> Oh no, no.\n\n432\n00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:18.850\nI've had users that, for whatever reason,\ntheir accounts keep getting locked out,\n\n433\n00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:22.390\nand we're trying to figure out\nwhat is causing that lockout.\n\n434\n00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:23.450\nThis is where I have to go.\n\n435\n00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:27.270\nI have to go to these event logs and\nsee the logon failures.\n\n436\n00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:28.840\nWhere are they coming from?\n\n437\n00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.680\nWhat is it stemming from?\n\n438\n00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:35.030\nAnd try to narrow down the specific\nitem that is causing that.\n\n439\n00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:37.290\nA lot of times it's a phone\nwith an old password, but\n\n440\n00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:39.830\nif I don't have these event logs,\nI'm not gonna be able to see that.\n\n441\n00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:44.390\nAll I say is, hey, something is\ncausing your account to be locked out.\n\n442\n00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:46.380\nI don't know it is,\nI don't know where it's coming from.\n\n443\n00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.950\nAnd that's why we use these event logs and\n\n444\n00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:51.670\nit's very helpful to be able to filter\nthat down to only what I need, right.\n\n445\n00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:56.860\nI can say a specific user,\nI can continue to push that down and\n\n446\n00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:00.900\nfocus it, like a laser, to get exactly\nthe information I'm looking for so\n\n447\n00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.710\nI can find that device\nthat's causing a problem.\n\n448\n00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:04.850\n>> That's it,\nit's all about being efficient, right?\n\n449\n00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:07.460\nAnd being able to get to that problem,\nfind it,\n\n450\n00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:10.600\nfigure out what the problem is,\ntroubleshoot it, be done with it.\n\n451\n00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:14.600\nAll right, last thing I want to show you\nhere is something we call central logging.\n\n452\n00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:18.940\nIn the Microsoft world this is\ncalled Event Subscriptions, and\n\n453\n00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:22.080\nit's a really cool capability.\n\n454\n00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:26.620\nIf I have to manage multiple machines,\nI'm talking about remoting into\n\n455\n00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:30.090\neach one of those machines one at a time\nand opening up this event viewer system\n\n456\n00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:34.080\nbecause these events are stored\nlocally on that system.\n\n457\n00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.860\nNot that big of a deal, I guess,\nI could remote into one or two servers.\n\n458\n00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:40.600\nWhat if I got to manage 10 DNS servers,\n\n459\n00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.092\n20 DNS servers spread across\nmy large organization?\n\n460\n00:23:43.092 --> 00:23:46.015\nNow that becomes much more challenging.\n\n461\n00:23:46.015 --> 00:23:50.092\nNow you can change the focus of\nthe Event Viewer system, itself.\n\n462\n00:23:50.092 --> 00:23:51.866\nI could connect to another computer, but\n\n463\n00:23:51.866 --> 00:23:54.259\nnow I'm manually connecting\nto different computers.\n\n464\n00:23:54.259 --> 00:23:57.115\nVery tedious, very time consuming.\n\n465\n00:23:57.115 --> 00:23:59.913\nEvent log subscriptions allow me to say,\nyou know what,\n\n466\n00:23:59.913 --> 00:24:03.180\ninstead of me going to those machines and\nreading their log files,\n\n467\n00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.780\nhow about they send their log files to me?\n\n468\n00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:06.940\nRight, how about that, right?\n\n469\n00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:09.800\nI'm gonna create a subscription and\nsay, I want you, you, you, and you, and\n\n470\n00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.680\nyou to report your log files back to me.\n\n471\n00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.120\nNow they still log locally.\n\n472\n00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:18.210\nIt doesn't change that at all,\nbut it duplicates the events and\n\n473\n00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:21.400\ncan send them to whoever\nthe subscriber is.\n\n474\n00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.270\nAll right, so, there are a couple of\nthings that we're gonna need to do to set\n\n475\n00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:26.220\nthese event subscriptions up.\n\n476\n00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:28.790\nI'm gonna flip back over here and\ntake a look at this drawing.\n\n477\n00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:32.880\nOn the source computers, all right, these\nare the ones that you want to pull the log\n\n478\n00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.642\nfiles from,\nyou've got to open up their firewall.\n\n479\n00:24:35.642 --> 00:24:38.610\nWe're gonna be reaching out,\ngrabbing those log files, right?\n\n480\n00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:43.188\nSo I've gotta run this winrm,\nWindows Remote Management, quickconfig.\n\n481\n00:24:43.188 --> 00:24:46.620\nAnd that's gonna do everything I need,\nset up the listener to listen for\n\n482\n00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:50.440\nthose request for the log files,\nit's gonna open up a hole in the firewall\n\n483\n00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.740\nto allow me to reach out and\ngrab those log files.\n\n484\n00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:55.510\nAnd you do that on each one\nof your source computers.\n\n485\n00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:57.430\nSo if you were managing ten DNS servers,\n\n486\n00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:00.230\nyou gotta run this command\non all ten of them.\n\n487\n00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:03.770\nOn the Collector, that's the one\nthat's gonna receive the log files,\n\n488\n00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:06.920\nthis could be another server,\nit could be your Windows 7 client.\n\n489\n00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:11.795\nYou're gonna run wecutil qc, short for\n\n490\n00:25:11.795 --> 00:25:17.090\nquickconfig, wecutil,\nWindows Event Collector Utility,\n\n491\n00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:21.770\nright, shortened up to wecutil qu,\nyou run that on the Collector.\n\n492\n00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:23.320\nAnd then the last thing you've gotta do,\nor\n\n493\n00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:27.530\nnext to the last thing you've gotta do,\nis the computer account for the Collector.\n\n494\n00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:31.670\nNot your account, the machine,\nthe computer account needs to be in\n\n495\n00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:37.630\nthe Local Admin's Group on each one\nof those source computers, right?\n\n496\n00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:41.220\nSo you just go to their local\ncomputer management, add them.\n\n497\n00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:43.030\nYou could use restricted groups and\n\n498\n00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:47.060\ngroup policy to add that machine\naccount to the Local Admins Group\n\n499\n00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:50.070\non each one of those machines where\nwe're gonna retrieve the log files from.\n\n500\n00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:52.950\nAll right, once you've got all that done,\n\n501\n00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:55.080\nthen it's just a matter of\ncreating the subscription.\n\n502\n00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.089\nSo let me show you these steps real quick.\n\n503\n00:25:57.089 --> 00:26:00.269\nI'm gonna use this guy as my Collector.\n\n504\n00:26:00.269 --> 00:26:05.049\nSo this is my machine\nthat I sit at everyday,\n\n505\n00:26:05.049 --> 00:26:08.419\nand I'm gonna run wecutil qc.\n\n506\n00:26:08.419 --> 00:26:11.235\nAnd it's gonna tell me it's gonna\nchange the startup type for\n\n507\n00:26:11.235 --> 00:26:12.707\nthis service that it relies on.\n\n508\n00:26:12.707 --> 00:26:14.183\nI'll say yes.\n\n509\n00:26:14.183 --> 00:26:15.250\nAnd there we go.\n\n510\n00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:18.740\nThe Event Collector service\nwas configured successfully.\n\n511\n00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:23.960\nAnd I gotta remember this guy's name here,\nclient01.\n\n512\n00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:29.090\nSo then on the servers that I want to\npull the log files from, I'm gonna run,\n\n513\n00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:33.570\nwinrm quickconfig.\n\n514\n00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:40.330\nAnd it tells me that the, let's see,\nit's already set up to receive requests.\n\n515\n00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:45.530\nIt doesn't want to create a listener and\nenable the firewall exception, yes I do.\n\n516\n00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:47.280\nAnd there we go.\n\n517\n00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:51.260\nAnd again, I'm gonna have to do that\non each machine and to speed this up,\n\n518\n00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:52.450\nI'll just do two here.\n\n519\n00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:56.263\nSo another winrm quickconfig,\n\n520\n00:26:56.263 --> 00:27:01.073\nand yes, and we'll be good to go there.\n\n521\n00:27:01.073 --> 00:27:07.382\nThen the last thing I need to do\nis open up Computer Management,\n\n522\n00:27:07.382 --> 00:27:11.440\nand go to that Local Users and Groups.\n\n523\n00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:17.951\nFind that Administrator's Group,\n\n524\n00:27:17.951 --> 00:27:21.946\nand add a client01.\n\n525\n00:27:21.946 --> 00:27:27.518\nChange that to look for\ncomputers, as well.\n\n526\n00:27:27.518 --> 00:27:31.347\nAll right, and\nthat's gonna add that machine account,\n\n527\n00:27:31.347 --> 00:27:35.273\nthe Local Admins Group,\nwe'll do that on here, as well.\n\n528\n00:27:35.273 --> 00:27:40.261\nAgain, this would normally be done through\na group policy to make this a little\n\n529\n00:27:40.261 --> 00:27:41.635\nbit easier, right?\n\n530\n00:27:41.635 --> 00:27:46.164\nAnd then I could just add\nmachines to a group as I need to.\n\n531\n00:27:46.164 --> 00:27:47.970\nBut we'll do it the old fashioned way.\n\n532\n00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:55.884\nAdministrators, Add, make sure we\ninclude computers in our search,\n\n533\n00:27:55.884 --> 00:28:00.756\nfind that client 01, and\nmake sure it's in there.\n\n534\n00:28:00.756 --> 00:28:02.096\nWe're good to go.\n\n535\n00:28:02.096 --> 00:28:05.180\nAll right, so now everything is set up.\n\n536\n00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:06.750\nWe'll close these guys.\n\n537\n00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.550\nEverything should be good to go.\n\n538\n00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:12.760\nThe last step is to\ncreate that subscription.\n\n539\n00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.993\nSo I'm gonna open up my Event Viewer here.\n\n540\n00:28:19.717 --> 00:28:22.238\nAnd I'll go down to Subscriptions.\n\n541\n00:28:22.238 --> 00:28:25.566\nI'll right-click on it, and\nchoose Create Subscription, and\n\n542\n00:28:25.566 --> 00:28:28.348\nit's gonna be that same or\nvery similar dialogue box,\n\n543\n00:28:28.348 --> 00:28:32.645\nas we go through this, you'll see it\nis very similar to creating a filter.\n\n544\n00:28:32.645 --> 00:28:36.140\nYou give a description,\na Subscription name, I'll call this my,\n\n545\n00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:42.102\nI don't know, we're just gonna call it-\n>> Sub1.\n\n546\n00:28:42.102 --> 00:28:44.748\n>> There you go, Sub1.\n\n547\n00:28:44.748 --> 00:28:49.020\nWell, I'll call it my,\nI don't know, DNS Logs, or DNS.\n\n548\n00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:51.320\nYeah, we'll call it Sub1 for Daniel.\n\n549\n00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:52.943\nNot feeling all that\ncreative this morning.\n\n550\n00:28:52.943 --> 00:28:56.194\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then where's it gonna go?\n\n551\n00:28:56.194 --> 00:29:00.362\nTypically, I just put it in my Forwarded\nEvents, that's a good place to store that.\n\n552\n00:29:00.362 --> 00:29:04.310\nThe only thing I don't like is it won't\nlet me create a new log to store it in.\n\n553\n00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:09.620\nWhat they, the idea is maybe if you\nwere pulling just diagnosis PLA\n\n554\n00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:14.760\nfrom multiple servers, then you might\ndump it in your own diagnosis PLA log.\n\n555\n00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:17.970\nSo when you went to that log, you'd see\nyour events, plus all the events from\n\n556\n00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:20.740\nthe different servers,\nI like dumping it in Forwarded Events.\n\n557\n00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:23.660\nThis is gonna be Collector Initiated,\nmeaning that\n\n558\n00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:28.940\nmy machine is gonna reach out periodically\nand get the log files from those servers.\n\n559\n00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:31.850\nI could also do source computer initiated,\n\n560\n00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:35.290\nwhere periodically they\npush out those events.\n\n561\n00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:39.274\nFor the Collector Initiated,\nI do need to select the computers,\n\n562\n00:29:39.274 --> 00:29:42.109\nso I'll find those guys, SVR, check names.\n\n563\n00:29:44.746 --> 00:29:48.841\nAnd we'll grab server two,\nas well as server three,\n\n564\n00:29:48.841 --> 00:29:51.576\nbecause those are the ones I set up.\n\n565\n00:29:51.576 --> 00:29:53.278\n>> You're having a hard time on this one,\nhuh?\n\n566\n00:29:53.278 --> 00:29:55.233\n>> Wow, come on.\n\n567\n00:29:55.233 --> 00:30:02.616\nAll right, we'll add server three,\nand then we'll add server 02.\n\n568\n00:30:02.616 --> 00:30:06.395\nAnd then I love to run the little\ntest that we have here,\n\n569\n00:30:06.395 --> 00:30:10.340\nto make sure all those commands\nI ran were successful, or\n\n570\n00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:14.059\nI didn't forget to run them\non one of those machines.\n\n571\n00:30:14.059 --> 00:30:16.819\nWe'll click OK, and\nthen we've gotta select our events, so\n\n572\n00:30:16.819 --> 00:30:20.334\nI'll click Select Events, cuz I don't\nwant their entire web files, right?\n\n573\n00:30:20.334 --> 00:30:21.595\nI don't need all of that, and\n\n574\n00:30:21.595 --> 00:30:24.650\nnotice this is the same thing\nwe used when we did the filter.\n\n575\n00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:30.130\nAnd maybe I just want to see\nthe last 24 hours, criticals,\n\n576\n00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:33.900\nfor the application and system log.\n\n577\n00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.555\nAnd I'm good to go, and\nI'll go ahead and click OK.\n\n578\n00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:40.900\nAnd we're good to go.\n\n579\n00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:45.030\nNow those are gonna show up\nunderneath Forwarded Events.\n\n580\n00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:48.560\nNow unfortunately,\nit only runs about every ten minutes.\n\n581\n00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:49.930\nIt's gonna reach out, and\n\n582\n00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:55.135\nthere's no real way to force it to\ngo get those events before that.\n\n583\n00:30:55.135 --> 00:30:59.105\nSo we won't see any events here, and we\nreally don't wanna sit around and wait for\n\n584\n00:30:59.105 --> 00:31:00.615\nthose guys to pop up.\n\n585\n00:31:00.615 --> 00:31:02.945\nBut what will happen is they'll\nshow up in this window.\n\n586\n00:31:02.945 --> 00:31:05.450\nAnd I'll be able to come to\nmy machine in the morning,\n\n587\n00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:09.170\nnot have to remote into anything else,\nopen up my own Event Viewer,\n\n588\n00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:11.720\ncome in to Forwarded Events,\nand I'll see all those events.\n\n589\n00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:16.400\nAnd you'll see that in the Computer column\nhere, you would see the source machine.\n\n590\n00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:20.180\nI'll see server two, and\nI'll see server three over there.\n\n591\n00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:23.823\nSo, very cool system, again,\nif that's my job, reading log files,\n\n592\n00:31:23.823 --> 00:31:26.144\nthis is gonna make my\nlife a whole lot easier.\n\n593\n00:31:26.144 --> 00:31:27.091\n>> Yeah.\nAnd Mike,\n\n594\n00:31:27.091 --> 00:31:30.670\nyou've really taken a lot of the\ntediousness out of perusing through log\n\n595\n00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:33.230\nfiles, cuz that's exactly what it can be.\n\n596\n00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:36.890\nSometimes it's a little bit of a trial and\nan effort to go through those things, so\n\n597\n00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:39.770\nbeing able to pair it down\nto only what you need,\n\n598\n00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:42.380\nwell that's gonna make that a little\neasier to swallow that pill.\n\n599\n00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:45.100\nThank you Mike so much, is there anything\nelse we need to cover before we let these\n\n600\n00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:46.520\ngood folks go for the show?\n\n601\n00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:47.551\n>> Have fun troubleshooting.\n\n602\n00:31:47.551 --> 00:31:49.104\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right,\n\n603\n00:31:49.104 --> 00:31:52.550\nwise words from Mike Roderick\n>> All right, so we're gonna go ahead and\n\n604\n00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:53.228\nclose the show now.\n\n605\n00:31:53.228 --> 00:31:54.330\nThanks for watching.\n\n606\n00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:57.187\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n607\n00:31:57.187 --> 00:31:58.011\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n608\n00:31:58.011 --> 00:31:58.940\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n609\n00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:05.533\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
