upcoming\n\n3\n00:00:10.655 --> 00:00:13.480\nMTA Windows OS Fundamentals series.\n\n4\n00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.090\nWe've gone ahead and\nwe've browsed to our Microsoft website,\n\n5\n00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.550\nthe Microsoft website that shows you the\nobjectives and the domain breakdown for\n\n6\n00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.160\nthis exam and\nreally who this exam is targeted to.\n\n7\n00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.524\nYou can see, if you will look, by going\nto, actually, it's www.microsoft.com,\n\n8\n00:00:30.524 --> 00:00:35.020\nand you can see it's under\nthe Learning page, and it's 98-349.\n\n9\n00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.270\nAnd when you get to this page,\n\n10\n00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.450\nit basically will give you\nthe breakdown for the entire exam.\n\n11\n00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.320\nYou can see what the target\naudience is for this exam.\n\n12\n00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.120\nYou can see, for instance, Home PC users,\nacademic, IT workers, IT professionals,\n\n13\n00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.850\nand developers.\n\n14\n00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.400\nI will tell you that if you are new\nto IT in general, the MTA exams,\n\n15\n00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.960\nthe Microsoft Technology Associates,\nif you weren't aware what that acronym is.\n\n16\n00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.295\nThese exams are very, very critical,\nI think, in helping people to\n\n17\n00:01:06.295 --> 00:01:11.425\nunderstand some the fundamental concepts\nthat we see in just about every network,\n\n18\n00:01:11.425 --> 00:01:14.355\nbut including more specific\nto a Windows environment.\n\n19\n00:01:14.355 --> 00:01:18.975\nSo, great way to leapfrog your\ncareer if you're just starting out.\n\n20\n00:01:18.975 --> 00:01:22.595\nLet's go ahead and take the time to show\nyou what you can actually see domain-wise\n\n21\n00:01:22.595 --> 00:01:25.200\nwhen it comes to\nthe breakdown of this exam.\n\n22\n00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.730\nNow, I will say at the time\nof the filming of this exam,\n\n23\n00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.870\nif you do go to this website,\nyou will see that it says,\n\n24\n00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.020\nAugust 31, 2016,\nthis exam includes updates for Windows 10.\n\n25\n00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.970\nKnow that at the time that\nwe're recording this overview,\n\n26\n00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.030\nWindows 10 content has\nbeen put into the 98-349\n\n27\n00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.020\nMTA Windows OS Fundamentals\nseries that you're about to view.\n\n28\n00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.590\nIf you scroll down a little bit farther,\n\n29\n00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.790\nyou will see that we have six domains and\n15% to 20% in each domain,\n\n30\n00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.340\nwhich means it's gonna vary a little bit\nto give you a totality of 100% coverage\n\n31\n00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.580\nin all the objectives, the skills\nmeasured, as Microsoft calls it.\n\n32\n00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.740\nYou'll see the very first one,\n\n33\n00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.660\nwe're gonna see Understanding\noperating system configurations, and\n\n34\n00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.640\nif we expand that out, you can see some of\nthe concepts that we're gonna go through.\n\n35\n00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.130\nFor instance, the control panel.\n\n36\n00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.750\nThe control panel being\nthe graphical user interface that\n\n37\n00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.660\nreally helps us to administer to\nthe entire Windows operating system and\n\n38\n00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.040\nin the environment surrounding it.\n\n39\n00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.280\nYou can see things like desktop settings\nand some of the various things that we\n\n40\n00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.210\ncan do to customize Windows to make\nit unique to the user experience.\n\n41\n00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.920\nAs well as some of\nthe native applications and\n\n42\n00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.520\ntools that are inside of\nour operating system,\n\n43\n00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.810\nincluding some of the web browsers,\nlike, for instance, Microsoft's Edge.\n\n44\n00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.470\nThe artificial intelligent\npersonal assistant, Cortana,\n\n45\n00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.311\nwe're gonna talk about, including things\nlike virtualization through Hyper-V,\n\n46\n00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:51.040\nMSCONFIG system configuration utility,\nand much more.\n\n47\n00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.310\nNow, if you have mobile devices, remember\nthat mobile devices are important for\n\n48\n00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.210\nnot only the mobility, but one of the\nthings that we have to look at is power\n\n49\n00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.650\nconservation and making sure that\nwe have proper thermal management.\n\n50\n00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.080\nWell, one of the things that you have\ninside of the operating system is\n\n51\n00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.490\na centralized location called\nthe Windows Mobility Center and\n\n52\n00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.500\na couple of other technologies that\nwe'll be taking a look at there as well.\n\n53\n00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.480\nWe'll also be looking at MMCs,\nMicrosoft Management Console,\n\n54\n00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.340\nsome of the various management tools,\nnot just limited to Windows PowerShell or\n\n55\n00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.220\nthe Windows PowerShell Integrated\nScript Environment, or ISE.\n\n56\n00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.160\nWe'll be looking at various Windows\nadministrative utilities likewise, too.\n\n57\n00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.420\nAnd you can see some of the preparation\nresources that you can use in addition to\n\n58\n00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.350\nyour ITPro.TV series here.\n\n59\n00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.450\nNow, moving into the next one, the next\ndomain, you can see that installing and\n\n60\n00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.350\nupgrading client systems,\nthis is important.\n\n61\n00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.550\nWell, how do you get the operating\nsystem on your machine?\n\n62\n00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.680\nSo we'll be going through identifying\nsome of the different editions\n\n63\n00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.680\nof Windows as well as upgrading\nfrom maybe an earlier\n\n64\n00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.300\nedition of Windows to a newer edition of\nWindows and some of the things that you\n\n65\n00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.070\nneed to keep in mind when you\nperform that type of function.\n\n66\n00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.930\nIncluding understanding installation\ntypes, whether it be a clean installation,\n\n67\n00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.130\nwhether it be an upgrade installation,\nwe'll be talking about that likewise, too.\n\n68\n00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.850\nAs well as operating system architecture,\nright?\n\n69\n00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.244\nWhat is the difference between 32-bit and\n64-bit?\n\n70\n00:04:14.244 --> 00:04:17.638\nWell, you're gonna have to stay\ntuned to the series to find out.\n\n71\n00:04:17.638 --> 00:04:21.460\nAnd you can see some of the preparation\nmaterials that they also have that I would\n\n72\n00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:26.210\nhighly recommend that will help complement\nand supplement your training as well.\n\n73\n00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.120\nThen we have managing applications,\n15% to 20% of the entire exam.\n\n74\n00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.040\nLikewise, you'll see\nconfiguring applications.\n\n75\n00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.500\nWe'll talk about when those applications\nare just stored on a local hard drive\n\n76\n00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.880\nversus one that you reach out across the\nnetwork and maybe connect to, including\n\n77\n00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.034\nsome of the security settings that we\ncan do inside of our operating system.\n\n78\n00:04:45.034 --> 00:04:49.500\nUser account control, for instance,\nthe user account control allowing us to\n\n79\n00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.860\ngive somebody only the level of access\nthey need to perform their job, no more or\n\n80\n00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.460\nno less.\n\n81\n00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.150\nAs well as antivirus settings, for\ninstance, Windows Defender we'll be\n\n82\n00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.872\ntalking about, and the MRT, also known as\nthe Malicious Software Removal Toolkit.\n\n83\n00:05:02.872 --> 00:05:07.240\nLast sub-objective you\nwill in this domain,\n\n84\n00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.690\nyou'll see understanding service types,\nthose background processes that happen day\n\n85\n00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.650\nto day and a lot of times we don't\ninteract with until you're into\n\n86\n00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.980\nsome kind of support environment where\nmaybe you do need to configure those.\n\n87\n00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.740\nMoving down the list, we have also\nmanaging files and folders, and\n\n88\n00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.613\nthis is important because we need to\nstore our information somewhere, so\n\n89\n00:05:27.613 --> 00:05:30.150\nwe need to know how we store\nthe information, right?\n\n90\n00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.200\nWhat file systems are available?\n\n91\n00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.550\nHow do we get the hard drives, or even\nsolid-state drives, for that matter, how\n\n92\n00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.180\ndo we get them configured and prepped so\nthat we can not only install our operating\n\n93\n00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.180\nsystem but also utilize it as a storage\nlocation for our files and folders?\n\n94\n00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:49.124\nSo you can see, we'll talk about some\ndifferent file systems including FAT32,\n\n95\n00:05:49.124 --> 00:05:53.375\nNTFS, and the resilient file system,\nwe'll talk about ReFS as well.\n\n96\n00:05:53.375 --> 00:05:56.847\nWe'll talk about how you can\ncontrol access through ACLs, or\n\n97\n00:05:56.847 --> 00:05:58.190\naccess control lists.\n\n98\n00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.350\nYou can control the level of access that\nsomebody has, either allow them access or\n\n99\n00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.970\ndeny them access through permission sets.\n\n100\n00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.610\nSo we'll talk about\nconfiguring permissions,\n\n101\n00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.360\nincluding configuring things like\nshares in the shared permissions when\n\n102\n00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.030\npeople need to connect to those\nresources over the networks.\n\n103\n00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.560\nWe'll also talk about encryption,\nencryption is important.\n\n104\n00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.340\nRemember, we're keeping the information\non the machine confidential so\n\n105\n00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.380\nonly the authorized\nusers have access to it.\n\n106\n00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.570\nSo we'll be looking at concepts like that,\nincluding opening up File Explorer and\n\n107\n00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.510\nlooking at various libraries and how we\ncan control and configure those libraries\n\n108\n00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.860\ninside of the file and folder\nmanagement graphical user interface.\n\n109\n00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.083\nNext in the list,\nyou're gonna see managing devices,\n\n110\n00:06:38.083 --> 00:06:39.390\nthis is important, right?\n\n111\n00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:43.220\nThis is one of the things that you're\ngonna do in a support type of role.\n\n112\n00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.940\nSo, not only is this important for\nyour exam, but\n\n113\n00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.850\nit's also important in the real world.\n\n114\n00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:52.770\nIncluding connecting devices and\ndisconnecting devices to your machine,\n\n115\n00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.880\nyour Windows operating system, whether it\nbe wireless through a Bluetooth device, or\n\n116\n00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.670\nwhether it be a wired connection.\n\n117\n00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.290\nAnd including understanding\nthings like storage, right?\n\n118\n00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.780\nWhen we talk about managing our devices,\n\n119\n00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.055\nwe have to understand how to manage\nthe storage devices that we utilize\n\n120\n00:07:08.055 --> 00:07:11.825\nin order to store the information for\nreuse at a later time.\n\n121\n00:07:11.825 --> 00:07:13.565\nWe also have to look at printing devices.\n\n122\n00:07:13.565 --> 00:07:17.545\nPrinting is important, whether it's\nin the home environment or if it is\n\n123\n00:07:17.545 --> 00:07:20.985\nin a corporate environment, and we're\ngonna talk about some of the concepts and\n\n124\n00:07:20.985 --> 00:07:25.090\nattributes around printers and\nprinting devices.\n\n125\n00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.540\nLast, but not least, in this domain, we'll\nalso talk about system devices, including\n\n126\n00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:33.060\nhow to configure and understand audio and\nvideo devices, including IR devices.\n\n127\n00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.420\nAnd last but\nnot least here in understanding devices,\n\n128\n00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:40.080\nwhere do we go to manage all\nof the hardware devices and\n\n129\n00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.420\ndrivers associated with them through\nsomething known as Device Manager.\n\n130\n00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.480\nNow, that is the second-to-last domain.\n\n131\n00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.360\nThe last domain that we have\nhere is understanding operating\n\n132\n00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.437\nsystem maintenance.\n\n133\n00:07:52.437 --> 00:07:56.830\nAgain, 15% to 20% of the overall exam, and\nthis is a very, very important domain.\n\n134\n00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:01.125\nThey're all equally important, but when\nit comes to a recovery situation, this is\n\n135\n00:08:01.125 --> 00:08:04.945\ndefinitely something you wanna know\nwhen it comes to the exam and help desk.\n\n136\n00:08:04.945 --> 00:08:06.165\nSo we'll look at backup and\n\n137\n00:08:06.165 --> 00:08:10.525\nrecovery methods as well as some of the\nmaintenance utilities that we have inside\n\n138\n00:08:10.525 --> 00:08:15.955\nof our operating system to make sure that\nthe Windows operating system is optimized.\n\n139\n00:08:15.955 --> 00:08:20.245\nAnd then last but not least,\nwe'll definitely talk about configuring\n\n140\n00:08:20.245 --> 00:08:23.210\nupdates and\nsome of the patch management thoughts and\n\n141\n00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:26.780\nconcepts that you need to know surrounding\nthe Windows 10 operating system so\n\n142\n00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:32.100\nthat you can apply updates, and\nmaintain a reasonable level of stability,\n\n143\n00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:37.540\nand maintain a good,\nhealthy operating system.\n\n144\n00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:40.790\nThese are some of the technologies and\nsome of the domains,
