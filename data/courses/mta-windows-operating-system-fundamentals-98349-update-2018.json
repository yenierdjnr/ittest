00:00:10.580\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.762\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:11.762 --> 00:00:17.580\n&gt;&gt; Hello again and thank you for choosing\nITProTV helping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.020\nI'm your host Zac Memos with this\nepisode of Windows OS fundamentals,\n\n7\n00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.510\nthis particular episode is all\nabout configuring control panel.\n\n8\n00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.920\nAnd the only person that I know who can\ntell us how to do that is West Brian and\n\n9\n00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.440\nhe's right here.\n\n10\n00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.200\nWest good to see you.\n\n11\n00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.580\n&gt;&gt; Hey, good to see you Zarch.\n\n12\n00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.180\nWell, I'm sure there are a few people but\n\n13\n00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.530\nI'm definitely one of those people-\n&gt;&gt; He's one of them.\n\n14\n00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.900\n&gt;&gt; Who can show you when it comes\nto configuring the control panel.\n\n15\n00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.260\nSo, what is the control panel, right?\n\n16\n00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.620\nWell the control panel is really one of\nthe primary interfaces that we use when it\n\n17\n00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.680\ncomes to setting\nthe computing environment.\n\n18\n00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.130\nIt's the way that we can configure\nthings like our user accounts and\n\n19\n00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.720\nwe can configure things like our hardware.\n\n20\n00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.450\nA lot of different things that we\ncan do inside of the control panel.\n\n21\n00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.620\nAnd let's go ahead and\nwhat I'd like to do,\n\n22\n00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.580\nis I'd like to take the time to show\nyou what the control panel looks like.\n\n23\n00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.116\nNow, with your MTA Windows OS\nfundamentals, we do want you to\n\n24\n00:01:03.116 --> 00:01:08.083\nunderstand that they could ask you about\nthree different operating systems, right?\n\n25\n00:01:08.083 --> 00:01:11.210\nOr potentially even four\noperating systems, Windows 7,\n\n26\n00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.466\nWindows Vista, Windows 8.1 or\nWindows 10, all right?\n\n27\n00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:17.585\nWe're gonna show you Windows 7.\n\n28\n00:01:17.585 --> 00:01:18.925\nWe'll show you Windows 8.1.\n\n29\n00:01:18.925 --> 00:01:20.245\nWe'll also show you Windows 10.\n\n30\n00:01:20.245 --> 00:01:22.835\nIt is important because for\n\n31\n00:01:22.835 --> 00:01:27.735\nthe most part the way we configure\nthings hasn't really changed too much.\n\n32\n00:01:27.735 --> 00:01:29.891\nI will tell you though when\nwe get to Windows 10 and\n\n33\n00:01:29.891 --> 00:01:34.155\nthere's the beaten path and we're\ngoing to jump right off of it, right?\n\n34\n00:01:34.155 --> 00:01:35.685\nThey definitely changed the interface up.\n\n35\n00:01:35.685 --> 00:01:39.890\nAnd since you're going to be expected\nto know Windows 10 exam questions,\n\n36\n00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.290\nit's good to know that interface.\n\n37\n00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.250\nSo let me show you what I mean here.\n\n38\n00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.990\nWe'll start.\n\n39\n00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.360\nWe'll go all the way back in time.\n\n40\n00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.790\nWe're gonna jump on our DeLorean here.\n\n41\n00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:46.970\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n42\n00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.820\nWe gotta do some time travel, right?\n\n43\n00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.370\nSo we're gonna go back and\nwe're gonna look at Windows 7 first.\n\n44\n00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.130\nAnd you can see the Windows 7 desktop.\n\n45\n00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.890\nAnd we still have, all the way down here\nin our lower left hand corner, right,\n\n46\n00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.310\nwe have our start button.\n\n47\n00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.210\nAnd if we choose our start button,\nover here on the start menu, right,\n\n48\n00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.710\nwe can launch into the control panel by\nchosing the one click button here, right?\n\n49\n00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.660\nAnd this brings us into\nwhat our control panel is.\n\n50\n00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.330\nNow, we'll come back here and we'll talk\na little bit more about control panel,\n\n51\n00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.800\nI just want you to kind of\nsee the interface, right?\n\n52\n00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.390\nSo this is what it looks\nlike in Windows 7 and\n\n53\n00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.090\nWindows Vista is pretty much the same too.\n\n54\n00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.010\nThe difference would be that instead of\nthis saying system and security up here.\n\n55\n00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.240\nIt would say system and maintenance.\n\n56\n00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.545\nBut one of the things you're gonna\nnotice is that they're largely,\n\n57\n00:02:26.545 --> 00:02:27.800\nthat they're fairly close.\n\n58\n00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.245\n&gt;&gt; And you're saying people actually\nare still using Windows Vista?\n\n59\n00:02:30.245 --> 00:02:32.700\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I am not saying that.\n\n60\n00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.940\nI will say that.\n\n61\n00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.060\n&gt;&gt; It's possible though.\n\n62\n00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.650\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n63\n00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.770\n&gt;&gt; That is possible.\n&gt;&gt; It's one of those operating systems\n\n64\n00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:44.070\nthat you can still see it out there,,\nwhether you maybe want to or not, right?\n\n65\n00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.260\nAnd again, so\nit is something to be aware of, right?\n\n66\n00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.630\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Now, as we move into and\n\n67\n00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.310\nwe'll go ahead and do this.\n\n68\n00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.360\nWe're gonna flip right on over\nto a Windows 8.1 machine.\n\n69\n00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.710\nAnd we're actually in the desktop view,\nall right?\n\n70\n00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.270\nKeep in mind that they also\nhave the modern UI view,\n\n71\n00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.750\nwhich would be the default for Windows 8.\n\n72\n00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.390\nWhen Windows 8.1 came out they said,\neverybody likes their desktop.\n\n73\n00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.775\nWe'll do desktop mode and\nyou'll start there on the desktop, so.\n\n74\n00:03:10.775 --> 00:03:13.728\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Whether you're using the modern UI or\n\n75\n00:03:13.728 --> 00:03:17.054\nyou're using the desktop\ninterface is up to you.\n\n76\n00:03:17.054 --> 00:03:19.310\nSo, if I'm gonna use\nthe desktop interface, right?\n\n77\n00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.925\nThe desktop mode even though, it's really\nnot a start button in Windows 8.1 they\n\n78\n00:03:23.925 --> 00:03:28.085\ncall it Windows charm and again,\nit's charming, if you right click on it,\n\n79\n00:03:28.085 --> 00:03:30.815\nyou'll notice there's\na control panel option,\n\n80\n00:03:30.815 --> 00:03:35.090\nmuch like we have in Windows 7 when\nit comes to the start menu, right?\n\n81\n00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.480\nAnd here is our control\npanel inside of well,\n\n82\n00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.940\nWindows 8.1 and if we switch over back and\nforth between these Zack,\n\n83\n00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.090\nyou can see, there eally isn't much\ndifference between the two, right?\n\n84\n00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.570\nThey're fairly close, right?\n\n85\n00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.910\nReally not much difference at all, right?\n\n86\n00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.510\nSo definitely know that those interfaces\non how you get to control panel.\n\n87\n00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.290\nNow, I also said the modern UI,\nso this will be for\n\n88\n00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.740\nWindows 8 machines,\nas well as Windows 8.1 machines.\n\n89\n00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.200\nUnderstand that you can also,\nright here from the Start Menu.\n\n90\n00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.190\nAnd let me see here,\nit didn't seem to pick up my key strokes,\n\n91\n00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.590\nlet me type control.\n\n92\n00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.530\nAnd if you just start typing control here,\nnotice that here,\n\n93\n00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.080\nit's kind like your search menu, right?\n\n94\n00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.020\nKinda like your search bar,\nyour old run line, you can actually just\n\n95\n00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:24.030\ntype right there from the modern UI,\nmetro UI, they use both terms.\n\n96\n00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.920\nEarlier, it was called the metro UI\nthen they changed the name to modern UI,\n\n97\n00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.620\nhowever they're one in the same,\nsynonymous terms, hopefully,\n\n98\n00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.490\nwe're alleviating some confusion if\nyou ever get into the terminology.\n\n99\n00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.750\n&gt;&gt; Indeed and\ntomorrow they're gonna call it Howard.\n\n100\n00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.419\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's exactly it and\nnext week they'll call it Peanut Butter.\n\n101\n00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:39.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n102\n00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.670\nknow that some of the terminology,\nwe have to keep that in mind, right?\n\n103\n00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:44.560\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; When it comes to some of\n\n104\n00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.460\nthe terminology,\nit might get a little confusing but\n\n105\n00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.290\nyou can see I can still get\nto Control Panel right here.\n\n106\n00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.800\nNow, it's just gonna keep it\nup here on the Desktop for\n\n107\n00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.760\nme cuz we already got it launched.\n\n108\n00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.640\nNow that you know exactly how\n\n109\n00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.810\nyou're supposed to find Control Panel in\nWindows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and\n\n110\n00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.314\neven Vista before that, I want you\nto throw all that out, all right?\n\n111\n00:05:04.314 --> 00:05:05.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n112\n00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.090\nwe're gonna go to Windows 10.\n\n113\n00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.380\nWindow 10 is a little bit different.\n\n114\n00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.450\nWith their interface, yes,\nwe still have our Desktop.\n\n115\n00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.460\nWe also have a combination of\nalmost like a windows charms.\n\n116\n00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.370\nSo, the windows charm really hasn't\nchanged from windows 8.1 but\n\n117\n00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.170\nthey brought back a sermon, all right?\n\n118\n00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.360\nSo in start menu we can actually get into\ncontrol panel if we want, here as well.\n\n119\n00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.940\nWe can type control and\nI can launch the control panel, all right?\n\n120\n00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:37.550\nNoticed that control panel It is again,\npretty much the same.\n\n121\n00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is.\n&gt;&gt; All right, we can get to it but\n\n122\n00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.110\nI will tell you, in Windows 10 they're\nalso supporting and my head's going to\n\n123\n00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.610\nkind of cover this one up because the icon\nis so small, down in the lower right-hand\n\n124\n00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.240\nportion of that screen,\nlet me see if we can zoom in there Zach.\n\n125\n00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.140\nYou guys can see.\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n126\n00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.050\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like that little notification,\na thought bubble, right?\n\n127\n00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.150\nAnd if I chose that,\nthat brings out the action center, right?\n\n128\n00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.660\nAnd the action center,\na quick heads up display,\n\n129\n00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.380\nI like this, Windows Defender is\nrunning in the background, but this is\n\n130\n00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.550\nwhere I'm gonna get into the settings to\nconfigure a little bit different, right?\n\n131\n00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.780\nWe used control panel in the earlier days.\n\n132\n00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.750\nBut notice that I now have\nthis all settings button, and\n\n133\n00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.310\nthis is the new Windows setting interface.\n\n134\n00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.160\nRight?\n\n135\n00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.510\nIt is different.\n\n136\n00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.300\nYou can see,\nit's a major difference, right?\n\n137\n00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.980\nZach, one of the things that we\nnotice this across the board here.\n\n138\n00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:26.480\nAll three interfaces really look the same\nwhen it comes to Control Panel but\n\n139\n00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.100\nthe way they want you to\nconfigure things are different.\n\n140\n00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.800\nThey want you to configure things today in\nWindows 10 and probably moving forward too\n\n141\n00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.190\nunless they have a major change in\nthe Windows Settings interface.\n\n142\n00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.840\nNow you can still get to control panel.\n\n143\n00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.908\nAnd this is where it becomes\na little problematic for\n\n144\n00:06:38.908 --> 00:06:40.882\nthose of you that may be\njumping into computing for\n\n145\n00:06:40.882 --> 00:06:43.749\nthe, well, if you're jumping into\ncomputing for the very first time,\n\n146\n00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:47.400\nit's probably not that big of a deal\nbecause you don't know what to expect.\n\n147\n00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.860\nYou're one of those ones and Zach,\nI know you've been using computers for\n\n148\n00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:50.490\na while now.\n\n149\n00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.420\nIf you're one of those ones that\nare familiar with a consistent way to do\n\n150\n00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.920\nsomething and\n\n151\n00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.440\nall of a sudden they change it, it might\nbe a little bit of a learning curve.\n\n152\n00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.212\n&gt;&gt; It makes me upset.\n\n153\n00:06:58.212 --> 00:07:01.220\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, you get so\n\n154\n00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.220\nused to something being somewhere and they\nchange it, so don't let this confuse you.\n\n155\n00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.590\nDon't, by any means,\nlet it initimidate you, right?\n\n156\n00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.820\nSo for instance, if I went into system,\nlet's say and again,\n\n157\n00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.760\na lot of the same things\nthat we have here,\n\n158\n00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.030\na little bit different than control\npanel but I go to power and sleep.\n\n159\n00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:20.880\nNotice I've got very basic\nstuff that I can configure.\n\n160\n00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.840\nBut control panel is there, if I go\nahead and I kinda zoom out here and\n\n161\n00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.600\nyou notice down here or up here in the\nupper right-hand corner of your screen,\n\n162\n00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.150\nwe have related settings,\nadditional power settings and\n\n163\n00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.790\nthen there's this little hyperlink here,\nlittle web URL hyperlink.\n\n164\n00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:38.000\nAnd I click that, well,\nnotice what comes up.\n\n165\n00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:40.410\nGo to old Control Panel.\n\n166\n00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:40.980\n&gt;&gt; Bing, bing, bing.\n\n167\n00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.792\n&gt;&gt; All right, so in Windows 10 they're\nkind of supporting two interfaces, right?\n\n168\n00:07:43.792 --> 00:07:47.007\nThey're bringing in the new interface that\nthey want you to use but at the same time,\n\n169\n00:07:47.007 --> 00:07:49.016\nthey've still got remnants of the old one,\nright?\n\n170\n00:07:49.016 --> 00:07:53.032\nSo, we'll probably end up seeing\na crossover where They'll cut the kill\n\n171\n00:07:53.032 --> 00:07:56.223\nswitch, if you will,\non the traditional Control Panel.\n\n172\n00:07:56.223 --> 00:07:59.911\nBut as of today, we're in 2018,\nas of this recording, so\n\n173\n00:07:59.911 --> 00:08:01.870\nwe've got the updated content.\n\n174\n00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:05.941\nKeep in mind that you're still going to\nhave to know Control Panel, all right, so\n\n175\n00:08:05.941 --> 00:08:08.487\nthat's a little bit about Control Panel,\nright?\n\n176\n00:08:08.487 --> 00:08:11.720\nWhen we look at a Control Panel,\nit allows us the ability to make some\n\n177\n00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.983\ndifferent configuration changes\ninside of our operating system.\n\n178\n00:08:14.983 --> 00:08:18.726\n&gt;&gt; So\nwe've talked about administrative access,\n\n179\n00:08:18.726 --> 00:08:23.505\ndo you have to be an admin to\naccess the administrative tools?\n\n180\n00:08:23.505 --> 00:08:27.436\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question, Zach, and\none of the things that I would say,\n\n181\n00:08:27.436 --> 00:08:30.286\nit's a yes and no answer,\nand I know you hate those.\n\n182\n00:08:30.286 --> 00:08:33.040\nYes and no, well, great, class dismissed.\n\n183\n00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:33.948\n&gt;&gt; Okay, we're done.\n\n184\n00:08:33.948 --> 00:08:35.032\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right?\n\n185\n00:08:35.032 --> 00:08:36.114\n&gt;&gt; For now, bye.\n\n186\n00:08:36.114 --> 00:08:39.639\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and let me show you\nwhat I mean, because the truth is,\n\n187\n00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:41.025\nit is a yes and no answer.\n\n188\n00:08:41.025 --> 00:08:42.936\nAnd I know those can\nget a little confusing,\n\n189\n00:08:42.936 --> 00:08:44.340\nlet me show you what I mean here.\n\n190\n00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:48.542\nSo we'll take our Windows 7 machine, and\nwe'll kind of flip flop back and forth,\n\n191\n00:08:48.542 --> 00:08:51.016\nremember, blue desktop, Windows 7, right?\n\n192\n00:08:51.016 --> 00:08:54.600\nWhen you get the yellow desktop, that's\ngoing to be your Windows 8.1 machine.\n\n193\n00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.703\nAnd then the Windows 10 has the newer\nblue interface, if you will.\n\n194\n00:08:56.703 --> 00:09:00.253\nSo we've just got to keep track of where\nwe're at there, and I'll kind of tell you,\n\n195\n00:09:00.253 --> 00:09:01.700\nI want you to notice something.\n\n196\n00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:05.297\nNotice that we have some task links here,\nand Zach, your question was, hey,\n\n197\n00:09:05.297 --> 00:09:06.893\ndo we have to be an administrator?\n\n198\n00:09:06.893 --> 00:09:10.447\nGreat question, because notice\nthat some of these hyperlinks,\n\n199\n00:09:10.447 --> 00:09:12.006\nthey're missing a shield.\n\n200\n00:09:12.006 --> 00:09:14.683\nBut notice, Zach, right here,\nnotice that little shield right there.\n\n201\n00:09:14.683 --> 00:09:19.030\nAnd I know it's hard to see, but that\nlittle shield right next to our add and\n\n202\n00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:20.410\nremove user accounts.\n\n203\n00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:25.266\nBut then, changing the theme, it doesn't\nhave that shield, so what does that mean?\n\n204\n00:09:25.266 --> 00:09:29.948\nAll right, well, the shield is part\nof what's known as the standard user\n\n205\n00:09:29.948 --> 00:09:32.376\nsecurity architecture, all right?\n\n206\n00:09:32.376 --> 00:09:34.856\nBig old long drawn out thing that says\nanybody that logs into the machine,\n\n207\n00:09:34.856 --> 00:09:36.350\nI don't care if you're an administrator.\n\n208\n00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:39.090\nYou're going to run in the context\nof a standard user, so\n\n209\n00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:40.985\nyou don't have elevated privileges.\n\n210\n00:09:40.985 --> 00:09:43.754\nAnd we don't have to worry about pieces\nof software running in the context\n\n211\n00:09:43.754 --> 00:09:44.523\nof administrator.\n\n212\n00:09:44.523 --> 00:09:46.722\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; For security purposes, that's bad.\n\n213\n00:09:46.722 --> 00:09:50.743\nAll right, well, if the shield is there,\nwhat's going to happen is,\n\n214\n00:09:50.743 --> 00:09:54.243\nif you are that standard user,\na couple things could happen.\n\n215\n00:09:54.243 --> 00:09:57.453\nOne thing that could happen is\nthat if you are a standard user,\n\n216\n00:09:57.453 --> 00:10:00.690\nyou'll get prompted with a user\naccount control dialog box.\n\n217\n00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:03.027\nWe'll go into the UAC and\nwhat it looks like in another episode, and\n\n218\n00:10:03.027 --> 00:10:04.302\nwe'll show you how to configure it.\n\n219\n00:10:04.302 --> 00:10:07.260\nBut that means that whatever\nis going on right now.\n\n220\n00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:11.193\nWhatever functionality that you've\ncalled on, is going make some changes,\n\n221\n00:10:11.193 --> 00:10:11.917\nkey changes.\n\n222\n00:10:11.917 --> 00:10:14.921\nThings like core functionality\nof the operating system,\n\n223\n00:10:14.921 --> 00:10:17.450\nthings like key security settings, right?\n\n224\n00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.796\nCreating a user account is\nsomething that is a very big or\n\n225\n00:10:20.796 --> 00:10:23.513\nprivileged level of\naccess on the computer.\n\n226\n00:10:23.513 --> 00:10:25.881\nYou're creating and\nmodifying the operating system,\n\n227\n00:10:25.881 --> 00:10:27.740\nyou need to be an administrator.\n\n228\n00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:32.072\nBut to change your theme,\nthat's only going to affect your account.\n\n229\n00:10:32.072 --> 00:10:35.654\nThat isn't going to affect Zach's account,\nso if I've got my account on this machine,\n\n230\n00:10:35.654 --> 00:10:38.140\nand we've got Zach an account\non this machine, too.\n\n231\n00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.888\nAnd I log into this Windows machine and\nI change the theme,\n\n232\n00:10:40.888 --> 00:10:42.636\nthat just modifies my user account.\n\n233\n00:10:42.636 --> 00:10:44.765\nIt doesn't do anything\nwith Zach's account, so\n\n234\n00:10:44.765 --> 00:10:46.650\nthat's not like a global-wide setting.\n\n235\n00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:48.917\nThat's not a system-wide setting,\nso it doesn't have the shield and\n\n236\n00:10:48.917 --> 00:10:50.745\nit doesn't require\nadministrative level privileges.\n\n237\n00:10:50.745 --> 00:10:51.690\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n238\n00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:54.982\n&gt;&gt; Now there are a series of tools\nthat we need to be administrators.\n\n239\n00:10:54.982 --> 00:10:59.614\nAnd it's ones that they want you to be\nable to really understand what they do,\n\n240\n00:10:59.614 --> 00:11:04.010\nand these utilities are actually\ncalled administrative tools.\n\n241\n00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:07.889\nNow I want you to know there's a few\ndifferent ways that you can get to this,\n\n242\n00:11:07.889 --> 00:11:08.513\nall right?\n\n243\n00:11:08.513 --> 00:11:10.715\nOne of the main ways is\nthrough the Control Panel.\n\n244\n00:11:10.715 --> 00:11:14.758\nThe other way is a little bit different\nwhen it comes to Windows 10, all right,\n\n245\n00:11:14.758 --> 00:11:16.136\nlet me show you what I mean.\n\n246\n00:11:16.136 --> 00:11:19.762\nSo Windows 7, if we're going to\nget into our administrative tools,\n\n247\n00:11:19.762 --> 00:11:21.928\nwe're going to go open up Control Panel.\n\n248\n00:11:21.928 --> 00:11:25.030\nWe're going to go to System and Security,\nand then from System and Security,\n\n249\n00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:26.071\nall the way at the bottom.\n\n250\n00:11:26.071 --> 00:11:28.659\nWe're going to get to see\nAdministrative Tools, all right,\n\n251\n00:11:28.659 --> 00:11:31.866\nthis goes all the way back actually to XP,\nit's pretty much the same thing.\n\n252\n00:11:31.866 --> 00:11:35.140\nIt was called Performance and\nMaintenance back then, all right?\n\n253\n00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:38.176\nAnd we would go to Control Panel,\nPerformance and Maintenance, and\n\n254\n00:11:38.176 --> 00:11:40.753\nthen we would scroll down and\ngo to Administrative Tools.\n\n255\n00:11:40.753 --> 00:11:43.912\nIf you were in Vista, it was Security and\nMaintenance, scroll all the way down,\n\n256\n00:11:43.912 --> 00:11:45.130\nit was Administrative Tools.\n\n257\n00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:48.586\nWindows 7, it's System and\nSecurity, well, guess what?\n\n258\n00:11:48.586 --> 00:11:52.880\nScrolling all the way down,\nAdministrative Tools, well, guess what?\n\n259\n00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.603\nOn Windows 8, 8.1, System and\nSecurity, scroll all the way down,\n\n260\n00:11:56.603 --> 00:11:58.383\nyou get to Administrative Tools.\n\n261\n00:11:58.383 --> 00:12:02.877\nNow that you know exactly how to get there\nthrough the last four operating systems\n\n262\n00:12:02.877 --> 00:12:05.670\ngoing back two decades,\nlet's change it on you.\n\n263\n00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:07.443\nAnd that's where Windows 10 comes in, and\n\n264\n00:12:07.443 --> 00:12:09.457\nWindows 10,\nit's a little bit different here.\n\n265\n00:12:09.457 --> 00:12:11.527\nIn Windows 10,\nto get to the Administrative Tools,\n\n266\n00:12:11.527 --> 00:12:13.597\nyou can actually get to this\nright from the Start menu.\n\n267\n00:12:13.597 --> 00:12:14.174\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n\n268\n00:12:14.174 --> 00:12:17.621\n&gt;&gt; All right, and\nif we just choose the Start menu,\n\n269\n00:12:17.621 --> 00:12:23.357\nnotice that we have alphabetically a line\nhere, you can scroll all the way down.\n\n270\n00:12:23.357 --> 00:12:27.223\nAnd notice that you have right there\nat the Start button our Start menu,\n\n271\n00:12:27.223 --> 00:12:29.295\nyou have your Administrative Tools.\n\n272\n00:12:29.295 --> 00:12:32.060\nOops, sorry about that, I didn't mean\nto get you all seasick out there,\n\n273\n00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.544\nlet's try that a little slower there.\n\n274\n00:12:33.544 --> 00:12:36.589\nSo, again, we've got a few\ndifferent ways that we can get to\n\n275\n00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:39.001\nthe different administrative tools, right?\n\n276\n00:12:39.001 --> 00:12:42.067\nYou're going to see that the tools,\nfor the most part,\n\n277\n00:12:42.067 --> 00:12:45.960\nare going to be the same, but\nminor variations on how you get there.\n\n278\n00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.381\n&gt;&gt; So, can we see what some of these\ntools are and how we can access them?\n\n279\n00:12:49.381 --> 00:12:50.035\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n280\n00:12:50.035 --> 00:12:52.900\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm just kidding,\n[LAUGH], absolutely you can,\n\n281\n00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.780\nthese are really great utilities.\n\n282\n00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.909\nNow it would be one of these things\nwhere we could say, you know what,\n\n283\n00:12:56.909 --> 00:12:57.442\nwhat do they do?\n\n284\n00:12:57.442 --> 00:12:58.278\nWell, Zach,\n\n285\n00:12:58.278 --> 00:13:03.065\nthey allow you to do administrative\nfunctions inside of your operating system.\n\n286\n00:13:03.065 --> 00:13:05.424\nOkay, what does that\nactually mean [LAUGH]?\n\n287\n00:13:05.424 --> 00:13:06.847\nLet's show you what we mean here.\n\n288\n00:13:06.847 --> 00:13:09.104\nAll right, so when we dive into\nour Administrative Tools, and\n\n289\n00:13:09.104 --> 00:13:11.887\nI'm going to go ahead, and I'm going\nto be on our Windows 10 machine here.\n\n290\n00:13:11.887 --> 00:13:14.021\nWe're going to switch back and\nforth throughout this series.\n\n291\n00:13:14.021 --> 00:13:17.856\nJust so you can be very familiar with\nthe fundamentals of more than one Windows\n\n292\n00:13:17.856 --> 00:13:18.859\noperating system.\n\n293\n00:13:18.859 --> 00:13:23.953\nSo if we get into System and Security,\nnotice that now we have two ways.\n\n294\n00:13:23.953 --> 00:13:26.665\nThe traditional way is still\nthere with Windows 10, but again,\n\n295\n00:13:26.665 --> 00:13:29.046\nbecause they're supporting\ntwo different interfaces.\n\n296\n00:13:29.046 --> 00:13:31.463\nWe can also get there,\nnot only from the Start menu, but\n\n297\n00:13:31.463 --> 00:13:32.910\nthe traditional Control Panel.\n\n298\n00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:34.954\nI'm going to go ahead for\nnow, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n299\n00:13:34.954 --> 00:13:36.606\nI'm going to close down the Control Panel.\n\n300\n00:13:36.606 --> 00:13:39.700\nWe'll look at it a little bit more\nin some other things here coming up.\n\n301\n00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:43.138\nAll right, so here's some of the different\nthings that we have inside of our\n\n302\n00:13:43.138 --> 00:13:44.653\nAdministrative Tools, right?\n\n303\n00:13:44.653 --> 00:13:47.769\nNow these Administrative Tools do\nrequire you to have that administrative\n\n304\n00:13:47.769 --> 00:13:48.415\nlevel access.\n\n305\n00:13:48.415 --> 00:13:50.586\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Back to the question that Zach asked,\n\n306\n00:13:50.586 --> 00:13:52.573\nwhen we look at it like the shields,\n\n307\n00:13:52.573 --> 00:13:55.910\nthese are ones that require\nadministrative level access.\n\n308\n00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:56.991\n&gt;&gt; Like sudo, you have to sudo yourself.\n\n309\n00:13:56.991 --> 00:13:59.872\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, just like you're\ntalking about in mixed based systems,\n\n310\n00:13:59.872 --> 00:14:01.033\nit's just like a root user.\n\n311\n00:14:01.033 --> 00:14:01.941\n&gt;&gt; Right on.\n&gt;&gt; You have to be,\n\n312\n00:14:01.941 --> 00:14:06.174\nyou would have to have that higher\nlevel privilege to access these, right?\n\n313\n00:14:06.174 --> 00:14:07.978\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Because when you look,\n\n314\n00:14:07.978 --> 00:14:14.830\nthere are some things that we just don't\nwant the average end user configuring.\n\n315\n00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:15.796\nComponent Services,\n\n316\n00:14:15.796 --> 00:14:18.908\nthis is one I wouldn't worry too much\nabout unless you're a developer.\n\n317\n00:14:18.908 --> 00:14:21.204\nYou're working with COM\nregistration objects and\n\n318\n00:14:21.204 --> 00:14:22.970\nif you're an application developer.\n\n319\n00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:26.346\nYou might be using this in the test\nportions of your application, right?\n\n320\n00:14:26.346 --> 00:14:27.861\nAnd you can see just by hovering,\n\n321\n00:14:27.861 --> 00:14:30.580\nthis is one of the things that\nI would remember for the exam.\n\n322\n00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.652\nAnd one of the things that would help\nyou all very well out there, all right,\n\n323\n00:14:33.652 --> 00:14:36.064\nthis is something that I learned\nback when I first started.\n\n324\n00:14:38.042 --> 00:14:42.374\nNot teaching, but learning, as a student,\nhover to discover, all right?\n\n325\n00:14:42.374 --> 00:14:45.695\nZach, I put my cursor right\non Component Services,\n\n326\n00:14:45.695 --> 00:14:48.560\ncan you tell me what it might do?\n\n327\n00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.395\nJust by looking at that screen.\n\n328\n00:14:49.395 --> 00:14:50.684\n&gt;&gt; Well, it went away.\n\n329\n00:14:50.684 --> 00:14:54.052\n&gt;&gt; And of course, it went away, because\nI asked him, I put him on the spot, and\n\n330\n00:14:54.052 --> 00:14:55.171\nnow it's gone, right?\n\n331\n00:14:55.171 --> 00:14:58.085\nBut if you notice,\nI hover over Component Services, and\n\n332\n00:14:58.085 --> 00:15:00.910\nI threw Zach a curve ball here, right?\n\n333\n00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:03.458\nI don't even work with\nthis administrative tool,\n\n334\n00:15:03.458 --> 00:15:07.023\nbut you can see it says manages COM\napplications, COM and DCOM system.\n\n335\n00:15:07.023 --> 00:15:10.540\nThe Distributed Transaction Coordinator,\nwhat does that mean?\n\n336\n00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.882\nI have no clue, I'm not an application\ndeveloper, I don't use this one heavily,\n\n337\n00:15:13.882 --> 00:15:16.100\nI will tell you, but\nthat's what it's working with.\n\n338\n00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.671\nIt's working with the lower portions\nof the operating system when it\n\n339\n00:15:18.671 --> 00:15:19.280\ncomes to that.\n\n340\n00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.337\n&gt;&gt; Well, I thought it would work with\n\n341\n00:15:20.337 --> 00:15:22.092\nthe Distributed Transaction Coordinator,\nactually.\n\n342\n00:15:22.092 --> 00:15:26.134\n&gt;&gt; You did great, Zach,\nyou did a great job.\n\n343\n00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:26.977\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, I tell you what,\n\n344\n00:15:26.977 --> 00:15:28.453\nlet's do a little bit\nof hover to discover.\n\n345\n00:15:28.453 --> 00:15:31.397\nAll right,\nI hover over Computer Management,\n\n346\n00:15:31.397 --> 00:15:35.975\nI'm making my job fairly easily,\n[LAUGH], but that's what we want to do.\n\n347\n00:15:35.975 --> 00:15:38.179\nWe want to make your job\neasy studying this, right?\n\n348\n00:15:38.179 --> 00:15:41.435\nSo, Computer Management,\nif I go ahead and open this up.\n\n349\n00:15:41.435 --> 00:15:44.154\nAnd rather than just kind of hover\nover this and let Windows do the job.\n\n350\n00:15:44.154 --> 00:15:47.615\nLet me earn my money here and\nkind of show you what some of these do.\n\n351\n00:15:47.615 --> 00:15:50.475\nComputer Management,\nwe'll talk more about this,\n\n352\n00:15:50.475 --> 00:15:54.361\nyou're going to see us use this\nthroughout this series pretty heavily.\n\n353\n00:15:54.361 --> 00:15:57.352\nSo we'll be talking more about this, but\n\n354\n00:15:57.352 --> 00:16:02.831\nI call this the convenience store,\nwhen it comes to Administrative tools.\n\n355\n00:16:02.831 --> 00:16:04.645\nAnd that’s because this bundles in.\n\n356\n00:16:04.645 --> 00:16:06.727\nA lot of the tools that you’ll\nsee in the background, or\n\n357\n00:16:06.727 --> 00:16:08.733\nsome of the tools that you'll\nsee in the background.\n\n358\n00:16:08.733 --> 00:16:11.282\nHere, let me see if I can arrange\nthis to where we can see some of\n\n359\n00:16:11.282 --> 00:16:15.080\nthese side by side here and make it\na little bit easier for you guys to see.\n\n360\n00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.690\nAll right, so system tools.\n\n361\n00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:19.073\nNotice I have task scheduler,\nevent viewer.\n\n362\n00:16:19.073 --> 00:16:21.602\nAnd I’ll talk about these,\nbear with me, here.\n\n363\n00:16:21.602 --> 00:16:24.117\nShared folders, performance,\ndevice manager,\n\n364\n00:16:24.117 --> 00:16:26.660\nlocal users in groups disk management.\n\n365\n00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:31.984\nAll right, now, if I look over here,\ndown this list, all right?\n\n366\n00:16:31.984 --> 00:16:36.216\nOne of the things you'll notice is that,\nyeah, event viewer is right here, but\n\n367\n00:16:36.216 --> 00:16:39.345\nevent viewer is also right here, right?\n\n368\n00:16:39.345 --> 00:16:42.915\nNotice that we have, what else, services.\n\n369\n00:16:42.915 --> 00:16:44.615\nTask Scheduler down here at the bottom.\n\n370\n00:16:44.615 --> 00:16:45.475\nHow can I miss that one?\n\n371\n00:16:45.475 --> 00:16:47.575\nVery first one in the list\nin Computer Management,\n\n372\n00:16:47.575 --> 00:16:50.415\nbottom of the list in\nAdministrative Tools.\n\n373\n00:16:50.415 --> 00:16:54.805\nRight, Device Manager, we have, I wanna go\nunder the Services and Applications node.\n\n374\n00:16:54.805 --> 00:16:59.010\nAnd I know I know I've made\nAdministrative Tools disappear, but\n\n375\n00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:00.640\nwe'll bring it back to the forefront here.\n\n376\n00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.770\nNotice that I've got Services right here.\n\n377\n00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:06.540\nWell, look down here at the bottom\nof Administrative Tools, right?\n\n378\n00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:11.350\nNow, imagine that I need some of these\nutilities, and I need these utilities, but\n\n379\n00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:13.830\nI don't want to have to\nopen up them individually.\n\n380\n00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:15.640\nWell, guess what?\nI can launch them from Computer Management\n\n381\n00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.230\ninside of Administrative Tools.\n\n382\n00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:20.650\nNow I want you to also note that\nutilities like something like\n\n383\n00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:26.700\nthese Administrative Tools don't just have\nto be launched from the Control Panel.\n\n384\n00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.500\nNow, we're talking about\nthe Control Panel in this episode, but\n\n385\n00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:33.220\nI want you to see something that I can\nactually close Computer Management down,\n\n386\n00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:37.150\nand if I knew the traditional old RUN line\ncommands, I could actually type them in\n\n387\n00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:40.390\nthis search field here and I can find them\nthere, too, these administrative tools.\n\n388\n00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:44.130\nSo compmgmt.msc, right?\n\n389\n00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:47.693\nWe've got computer management, and\nit is a Microsoft management consult.\n\n390\n00:17:49.043 --> 00:17:51.130\nAnd notice what I have\nup here on the list.\n\n391\n00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:51.917\nAnd when I click that.\n\n392\n00:17:52.972 --> 00:17:53.890\nGive it a second here.\n\n393\n00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:54.720\nWait for it.\n\n394\n00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.898\nAnd we have computer management,\nall right?\n\n395\n00:17:56.898 --> 00:18:00.440\nSo there are other ways you can launch\nthese two, and I would be aware of that.\n\n396\n00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.672\nYou probably gonna hear us mention these.\n\n397\n00:18:02.672 --> 00:18:05.208\nI say probably, I know we're gonna\nmention these quite a few times, here.\n\n398\n00:18:05.208 --> 00:18:08.503\nBut notice that there's more than one way\nto get to these administrative tools,\n\n399\n00:18:08.503 --> 00:18:10.507\nwe're just focused on\nControl Panel right now.\n\n400\n00:18:10.507 --> 00:18:12.654\nAll right, so that's computer management.\n\n401\n00:18:12.654 --> 00:18:14.765\nDefragment and optimize drives.\n\n402\n00:18:14.765 --> 00:18:18.825\nNow you will see that some of these will\nprobably not need any optimization because\n\n403\n00:18:18.825 --> 00:18:20.405\nof the fact that they're\nsolid state drives.\n\n404\n00:18:20.405 --> 00:18:22.230\nAll right, so, oops.\n\n405\n00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:24.950\n&gt;&gt; You can set defrag as\ndone automatic anyway.\n\n406\n00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:27.930\n&gt;&gt; That's right, it's been scheduled\nout since the days of Vista, yeah.\n\n407\n00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:29.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So, and that brings us back to\n\n408\n00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:30.950\nthe Task Scheduler, right?\n\n409\n00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.860\nTask Scheduler was in computer management\nas well as administrative tools,\n\n410\n00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.750\nI can automate day to day tasks.\n\n411\n00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:36.320\nWell, guess what?\n\n412\n00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:40.400\nLike Zach said, disk defragmenter,\nthat's been tasked out since Vista.\n\n413\n00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.250\nThey said you know what,\n\n414\n00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:44.470\nwe'll just run a task that says run\nyour disk defragmenter once every week.\n\n415\n00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:49.240\nNow that might not be good for you,\nyou might actually wanna disable that.\n\n416\n00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:49.770\nAnd why?\n\n417\n00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:52.796\nWell, solid state drives,\nthey don´t need disk defragmentation.\n\n418\n00:18:52.796 --> 00:18:54.060\n&gt;&gt; That's true, yeah.\n\n419\n00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:58.290\nThey still suffer from issues, but\nthey don´t have the traditional\n\n420\n00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:01.260\nfragmentation issues that we´ll talk\nabout again in other episodes coming up.\n\n421\n00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:05.780\nBut this is like the old\ndisk defrag that you had.\n\n422\n00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.010\nAnd again, defrag and\n\n423\n00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:11.830\noptimize drives allows you to do\nthe defragmentation of your drive.\n\n424\n00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:14.445\nDisk cleanup, great little utility here.\n\n425\n00:19:14.445 --> 00:19:19.605\nThis will search your entire operating\nsystem, if you will, for temporary files.\n\n426\n00:19:19.605 --> 00:19:21.217\n&gt;&gt; And you could set that also for\nautomatic.\n\n427\n00:19:21.217 --> 00:19:24.766\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nI do believe it does have a schedule.\n\n428\n00:19:28.471 --> 00:19:31.945\nHonestly, on disk clean up,\nI don't think you can schedule.\n\n429\n00:19:31.945 --> 00:19:35.325\nI'm gonna show you, again, there's another\nway that you get to Disk Management, here-\n\n430\n00:19:35.325 --> 00:19:36.185\n&gt;&gt; I threw a hardball at Wes.\n\n431\n00:19:36.185 --> 00:19:38.710\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You did absolutely, swing and\n\n432\n00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:39.540\na miss, all right?\n\n433\n00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:44.126\nSo if I go ahead and\nI launch down here on the Task bar,\n\n434\n00:19:44.126 --> 00:19:49.024\nI launch my file explorer, and\nthen I go over to this PC in\n\n435\n00:19:49.024 --> 00:19:53.745\nthe navigation panel over here,\nthe explorer pane.\n\n436\n00:19:53.745 --> 00:19:58.580\nAnd I select and right-click on local\ndisk C, and I choose Properties,\n\n437\n00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:03.972\nyou'll notice that I also have\nthe Disc Cleanup button here as well.\n\n438\n00:20:03.972 --> 00:20:06.380\nAll right, now,\nI don't see any scheduling times.\n\n439\n00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.620\nWhat you might be thinking\nof is check disk.\n\n440\n00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:09.182\n&gt;&gt; Right, of course.\n\n441\n00:20:09.182 --> 00:20:13.070\nAnd check disk does scan the disk,\nand you can schedule that.\n\n442\n00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:14.630\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So, I have a feeling that that's what\n\n443\n00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.230\nyou were actually talking about.\n\n444\n00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:20.550\nAnd again, we'll definitely talk\nabout check disk cuz when it comes to\n\n445\n00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:25.120\nour files and\nour locations on our hard drive,\n\n446\n00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:29.520\nwe want to make sure we know whether\nthey have any errors present or not.\n\n447\n00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.200\n&gt;&gt; Perfecto.\n\n448\n00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right.\n\n449\n00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:35.420\nSo that's a little bit\nabout our disk defragment.\n\n450\n00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:38.433\nOr defragment and optimized drives.\n\n451\n00:20:38.433 --> 00:20:41.794\nI'm so used to, and again, here's where\nthe old and the new kind of don't,\n\n452\n00:20:41.794 --> 00:20:42.730\nthey collide.\n\n453\n00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:44.680\nWhen worlds collide, right?\n\n454\n00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:48.660\nIs that it's called Disk Defragmenter\nin the earlier operating systems.\n\n455\n00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:50.900\nNow it's called defragment and\noptimize drives.\n\n456\n00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:53.600\nSo again, I might go back and\nforth with my terminology.\n\n457\n00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.330\nBut the next one that we're gonna go\nahead is, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n458\n00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:57.340\nlook at Add Event Viewer.\n\n459\n00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.370\nSo let's go ahead and dive in and do that.\n\n460\n00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:01.154\nAnd Zach, to do that, let me go ahead and\n\n461\n00:21:01.154 --> 00:21:04.372\nclean up Wndows to see some windows\nhere so [CROSSTALK] There we go, yeah.\n\n462\n00:21:04.372 --> 00:21:06.849\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of windows.\n\n463\n00:21:06.849 --> 00:21:11.076\n&gt;&gt; So close down some All the other\nstuff I have on the desktop here.\n\n464\n00:21:11.076 --> 00:21:15.560\nThe next one that we have in the list is,\nand we kinda talked about Disk Cleanup.\n\n465\n00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.080\nHere's what I don't wanna do.\n\n466\n00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.540\nI kinda just breezed through that and\ndidn't really explain it.\n\n467\n00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.170\nSo let me go ahead and\ntell you about Disk Cleanup.\n\n468\n00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:26.910\nDisk Cleanup allows you to\nclean the temporary files that\n\n469\n00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:28.570\nare found on your hard drive.\n\n470\n00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:30.060\nIn fact, let me go ahead and\nsee if I can run this.\n\n471\n00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:32.338\nThat doesn't take too long.\n\n472\n00:21:32.338 --> 00:21:35.300\nBut you can see some of the things\nthat you can actually clean up.\n\n473\n00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:38.310\nAnd it might save you a lot of disk space.\n\n474\n00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:42.690\nI will tell you that you can rerun this\nwith administrative level privileges.\n\n475\n00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:44.343\nBack to a question you asked.\n\n476\n00:21:44.343 --> 00:21:47.260\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Asked about our administrative tools.\n\n477\n00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:48.110\nI can run this.\n\n478\n00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:50.450\nThis is one of these utilities\nthat you can actually run,\n\n479\n00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:51.860\nif you're not an administrator,\n\n480\n00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:54.180\nbecause you're just gonna clean off\nthings that are in your profile.\n\n481\n00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:58.930\nWe talk about profiles in another episode.\n\n482\n00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:00.990\nAnd all that affects is the user.\n\n483\n00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:03.130\nHowever, if you do something like,\nfor instance,\n\n484\n00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:07.080\na Windows upgrade, what it does is it\ntakes your old operating system and\n\n485\n00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:12.280\nit puts it in SQL, and\nyou can usually find it, right?\n\n486\n00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:17.040\nIf I get in to our file explorer here,\nand I go to This PC, and\n\n487\n00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.244\nthen Local Disc C, right?\n\n488\n00:22:19.244 --> 00:22:20.173\nI can usually see it.\n\n489\n00:22:20.173 --> 00:22:23.216\nI'll see a folder in here, and\nlet me see if I can create it and\n\n490\n00:22:23.216 --> 00:22:24.900\nshow you what it would look like.\n\n491\n00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.990\nWindows dot old.\n\n492\n00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:29.730\nAll right,\nwhen I see a Windows.old folder in here,\n\n493\n00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:32.950\nwhat that says is that I've done an\nupgrade to this operating system, and it\n\n494\n00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:36.540\ntook all the remnants of the old operating\nsystem and it dumped it in this folder.\n\n495\n00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:37.920\nAnd you can delete that folder.\n\n496\n00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.970\nNow this is one I've created, all right?\n\n497\n00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:47.480\nAnd if you notice,\nI can delete it just fine, all right?\n\n498\n00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:50.510\nIf it's the Windows.old folder,\na true Windows.old folder,\n\n499\n00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:55.320\nthen it has the system attribute applied\nto every single file within that folder.\n\n500\n00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.520\nWhich means it's protected\nby the operating system and\n\n501\n00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.160\nyou'll get a whole lot of access denied.\n\n502\n00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:03.520\nSo if I need a scenario like that where I\nneed to clean up that Windows.old folder,\n\n503\n00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:07.818\nthat previous Windows installation,\nthen what I'll do is I'll come in here and\n\n504\n00:23:07.818 --> 00:23:09.606\nsay, hey, recheck the system.\n\n505\n00:23:09.606 --> 00:23:11.306\nI wanna clean the system files.\n\n506\n00:23:11.306 --> 00:23:14.230\nAnd it's back here in the background,\nit's actually doing that.\n\n507\n00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:16.520\nIt's asking me which\ndrive do I wanna do this.\n\n508\n00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.120\nSo now I'm elevating the privileges.\n\n509\n00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:22.310\nI'm not saying, hey, just the things\nthat are inside of my user your profile.\n\n510\n00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:24.370\nBut we might see Windows update cleanup.\n\n511\n00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:29.360\nAnd hopefully we can see, sometimes\nyou'll see it, I didn't see but, it's\n\n512\n00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:34.510\nprobably cuz it detected that there aren't\nany old Windows operating systems on here.\n\n513\n00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:37.467\nIt usually says old Windows installations,\nI believe, or\n\n514\n00:23:37.467 --> 00:23:40.021\nprevious Windows installations\nhere in the list.\n\n515\n00:23:41.264 --> 00:23:43.240\nAnd yeah, I don't see any.\n\n516\n00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:43.810\nSo that's good.\n\n517\n00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:44.920\nThat's a good thing.\n\n518\n00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.750\nBut I will tell you, if you see it in\nthe list, you can then turn around, and\n\n519\n00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:53.760\nyou can go through and select what it\nis that you want to delete, right?\n\n520\n00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.162\nAnd you do your disk cleanup.\n\n521\n00:23:55.162 --> 00:23:58.632\nIn this case I'm only\nsaving about 263 megs.\n\n522\n00:23:58.632 --> 00:24:02.117\nSo I mean,\na little bit of size here, right?\n\n523\n00:24:02.117 --> 00:24:05.932\nAnd I can choose okay, and then it asks\nme if I wanna delete the files and\n\n524\n00:24:05.932 --> 00:24:10.007\nthen I just go ahead and say okay, and\nit runs through and scraps the disk for\n\n525\n00:24:10.007 --> 00:24:13.590\nall these extra remnants of\ntemporary parts that we don't need.\n\n526\n00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:18.410\nSo just a little bit about this disk\ncleanup, it is a great utility to have, so\n\n527\n00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:19.720\nyou gotta know where it is.\n\n528\n00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:24.520\nThen we have Event Viewer, Event Viewer is\nanother utility that I use pretty heavily.\n\n529\n00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:29.610\nEvent Viewer is where we can\nfind different, I say events but\n\n530\n00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:35.240\nI guess situations if you will that\nhappen on your computer in fact let's go\n\n531\n00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.830\nahead and open the Event Viewer up here,\nand we're kinda take a look at it.\n\n532\n00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:42.545\nEvent Viewer is a great little utility\nhere where we can look at things like,you\n\n533\n00:24:42.545 --> 00:24:45.270\nknow whats is going on with\nthe operating system, right?\n\n534\n00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:48.883\nIf we wanna audit the system and\nfind activities that are going on,\n\n535\n00:24:48.883 --> 00:24:53.205\nI guess is that is the way we can call an\nevent I'm trying to replace event there,\n\n536\n00:24:53.205 --> 00:24:56.069\nit's an instance of something happening,\nright?\n\n537\n00:24:56.069 --> 00:25:01.170\nOn your computer here.\n\n538\n00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:03.300\nGive it a second,\nit looks like it locked up on me.\n\n539\n00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:06.180\nEvent Viewer doesn't lock,\nwhat Event Viewer does, and\n\n540\n00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.410\nwe'll give it a second here.\n\n541\n00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:09.200\nYou could see the number of events.\n\n542\n00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.290\nAnd so in, oops, maybe you can.\n\n543\n00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:18.680\nAll right, so in Windows Event, or\nMicrosoft's Event Viewers defense here.\n\n544\n00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.130\nWhat it had to do was it had\nto look at its database and\n\n545\n00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:24.100\nsaid I see just under 4,000 events.\n\n546\n00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:27.300\n&gt;&gt; Let's look at all of them.\n\n547\n00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:29.820\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what it's doing, too.\n\n548\n00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.785\nIt's taking all of those and\nit's rendering here.\n\n549\n00:25:32.785 --> 00:25:36.800\nI believe, EBT files or then fewer files.\n\n550\n00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.330\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And so it's loading them all up so\n\n551\n00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:39.740\nthat we can see these.\n\n552\n00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.220\nAnd we can see some of the different\nthings like Windows log.\n\n553\n00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:45.460\nThings that relate how\napplications are running,\n\n554\n00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:48.400\nloading, installing,\ncalling on dynamic link library files.\n\n555\n00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.806\nSecurity, security auditing.\n\n556\n00:25:49.806 --> 00:25:54.530\nThings like log-ons, log-offs when\na system accesses a privilege location,\n\n557\n00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:57.160\nyou get audit, and you can see\nall that information here so for\n\n558\n00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.650\ninstance we can bring up\nanyone of these logs.\n\n559\n00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:03.200\nNotice it says special privileges\nassigned to new log-on.\n\n560\n00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.120\nAnd well, what is the source?\n\n561\n00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.090\nWell, it's Microsoft security.\n\n562\n00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:09.280\nComponent of the operating system, right?\n\n563\n00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:10.700\nSo we can see that information.\n\n564\n00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:15.620\nAll right, and then just various logs,\nsystem events, that go on, right?\n\n565\n00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:18.820\nKernel starting, the kernel shutting down.\n\n566\n00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:20.930\nYou can see things like\nthe Windows Update Clients,\n\n567\n00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:22.490\na lot of things happening\nin the background.\n\n568\n00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:24.990\nDNS clients, and a distributed com, right?\n\n569\n00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:27.800\nIt looks like we got\na couple of errors going on.\n\n570\n00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.090\nAnd again, this is what brings\nstuff like this to light.\n\n571\n00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:32.460\nWe can see that, and\n\n572\n00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.830\nwhat it gives us the ability to do is\nwe can even see that in the heads up.\n\n573\n00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:40.070\nNotice application specific permission\nsettings do not grant, and you can see it.\n\n574\n00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:41.100\nYou can read the information.\n\n575\n00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:42.080\nI can take that information.\n\n576\n00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:45.470\nI can research it if we're having\nissues within this computer.\n\n577\n00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:49.040\nNow, these are just a few\nof the tools you can see.\n\n578\n00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.760\nWell, we've got a lot more, Zach,\nwhen it comes to administrative tools.\n\n579\n00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:56.460\nBut we have only scratched the surface,\nand I can see Zach over here saying, Wes,\n\n580\n00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:59.150\nWes, I think we're gonna have\nto put a comma in this episode.\n\n581\n00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:00.350\nSo we'll go ahead and do that.\n\n582\n00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:04.460\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful episode, Configuring\nControl Panel inside the OS series.\n\n583\n00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:08.000\nAnd there's so much in these OS series\nthat Wes has put together for you.\n\n584\n00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.970\nMake sure you watch every single episode,\nyou'll be glad you did.\n\n585\n00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:13.410\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n586\n00:27:13.410 -->

00:00:33.523\nYeah, I talked a lot\nin that first episode.\n\n13\n00:00:33.523 --> 00:00:34.201\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we did.\n\n14\n00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:35.381\n&gt;&gt; So well they had me back here.\n\n15\n00:00:35.381 --> 00:00:37.086\nSo [LAUGH] now we're gonna go ahead and\n\n16\n00:00:37.086 --> 00:00:39.184\nwe're gonna dive in\nright where we left off.\n\n17\n00:00:39.184 --> 00:00:43.360\nNow real, real short recap of where\nwe were in the first episode.\n\n18\n00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.461\nRemember, we kinda talked\nabout Control Panel,\n\n19\n00:00:45.461 --> 00:00:47.621\nwe see Control Panel to\nthe different interfaces.\n\n20\n00:00:47.621 --> 00:00:50.838\nAnd we really got to\na portion of Control Panel,\n\n21\n00:00:50.838 --> 00:00:54.308\na specific area called\nthe Administrative Tools.\n\n22\n00:00:54.308 --> 00:00:58.945\nZach, in the last episode,\nyou asked a great question that was, hey,\n\n23\n00:00:58.945 --> 00:01:02.594\ndo we have to be an admin in\norder to use these utilities?\n\n24\n00:01:02.594 --> 00:01:05.759\nAnd for the most part, you do.\n\n25\n00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.659\nThere are some that you don't, but for the\nmost part you have to be an administrator\n\n26\n00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.683\nto use these utilities,\nhence the term Administrative Tools.\n\n27\n00:01:12.683 --> 00:01:16.802\nBut keep in mind that if you're\nadministering to an operating system.\n\n28\n00:01:16.802 --> 00:01:20.564\nIf it only affects your user account then\na lot of times you can be a standard user.\n\n29\n00:01:20.564 --> 00:01:22.532\nLet's go ahead and let's dive back in.\n\n30\n00:01:22.532 --> 00:01:24.377\nWe're in our Windows 10 machine and\n\n31\n00:01:24.377 --> 00:01:27.094\nwe've already got\nAdministrative Tools launched up.\n\n32\n00:01:27.094 --> 00:01:30.087\nIf you're not familiar how to get there\nthen watch the first part, come back and\n\n33\n00:01:30.087 --> 00:01:31.661\njoin Zach, and I here in the second part.\n\n34\n00:01:31.661 --> 00:01:32.211\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n35\n00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:33.315\n&gt;&gt; We left off with Event Viewer,\n\n36\n00:01:33.315 --> 00:01:35.314\nit's one of the last things\nthat we were talking about.\n\n37\n00:01:35.314 --> 00:01:39.923\nNow, one of the things that you can\nuse your Windows client operating\n\n38\n00:01:39.923 --> 00:01:44.792\nsystems to do is to connect to storage\narea networks to SANs, all right?\n\n39\n00:01:44.792 --> 00:01:49.877\nBut in order to be able to communicate and\nsend those SCSI commands routed over\n\n40\n00:01:49.877 --> 00:01:55.371\na TCPIP based network, you need what is\nknown as a basically a SCSI client, right?\n\n41\n00:01:55.371 --> 00:01:59.794\nYou need an agent that's on the operating\nsystem to be able to talk to that high\n\n42\n00:01:59.794 --> 00:02:01.167\nspeed storage device.\n\n43\n00:02:01.167 --> 00:02:03.491\nAnd that's where the iSCSI\ninitiator comes in and\n\n44\n00:02:03.491 --> 00:02:06.653\nallows you to connect to those\nstorage area networks, if you will.\n\n45\n00:02:06.653 --> 00:02:11.185\nAnd basically encapsulate SCSI\ncommands overnight IP based network.\n\n46\n00:02:11.185 --> 00:02:13.054\nLocal Security-Policy,\nthis is a great one.\n\n47\n00:02:13.054 --> 00:02:15.680\nThis is where you can control\nsecurity centric settings.\n\n48\n00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.801\nRemember, we talked about configurations,\nright?\n\n49\n00:02:17.801 --> 00:02:20.063\nIt's all about configuring-\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n50\n00:02:20.063 --> 00:02:20.999\n&gt;&gt; The Windows environment, right?\n\n51\n00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:23.051\nConfigurating, if you will.\n\n52\n00:02:23.051 --> 00:02:25.991\nConfigurating your Windows environment-\n&gt;&gt; I like configurating.\n\n53\n00:02:25.991 --> 00:02:26.746\n&gt;&gt; New word.\n\n54\n00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:29.326\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I make my own contributions\nto the English language, right?\n\n55\n00:02:29.326 --> 00:02:31.679\n&gt;&gt; Do it, keep it.\n&gt;&gt; Highly technical terms that you'll only\n\n56\n00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:32.827\nlearn here ITPro.TV.\n\n57\n00:02:32.827 --> 00:02:34.509\nAnd more specifically from Wes.\n\n58\n00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:38.799\n[LAUGH] A,ll right so if you look some of\nthe security centric things we can do,\n\n59\n00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.033\nAccount Policies, Local Policies,\nlike for instance,\n\n60\n00:02:42.033 --> 00:02:44.590\nwe can set things like security options.\n\n61\n00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.855\nWe talked about the user account control\nand we'll see in other episodes is one of\n\n62\n00:02:48.855 --> 00:02:51.565\nthe ways that you can\ncontrol things like your UAC.\n\n63\n00:02:51.565 --> 00:02:56.467\nAccount Policies, we can set things like\npassword policies that define things like\n\n64\n00:02:56.467 --> 00:02:59.722\ncomplexity requirements if you will,\nfor passwords.\n\n65\n00:02:59.722 --> 00:03:01.793\nHow long can your password be?\n\n66\n00:03:01.793 --> 00:03:04.913\nHow long before the password expires,\nright?\n\n67\n00:03:04.913 --> 00:03:06.792\nSo things like that, for instance.\n\n68\n00:03:06.792 --> 00:03:12.063\nWindows Defender Firewall with Advanced\nSecurity, again, we can see what's going\n\n69\n00:03:12.063 --> 00:03:17.131\non and configurations of the firewall in\ndifferent network locations and stuff.\n\n70\n00:03:17.131 --> 00:03:22.034\nAs well as configuring more\nadvanced features, right?\n\n71\n00:03:22.034 --> 00:03:26.411\nThat we can do here in our Security\nPolicy, and you can see additional things.\n\n72\n00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:29.483\nLike for instance, if you wanna use\nthe functionality of AppLocker.\n\n73\n00:03:29.483 --> 00:03:33.553\nWell you can actually control portions\nof AppLocker through these application\n\n74\n00:03:33.553 --> 00:03:34.593\ncontrol policies.\n\n75\n00:03:34.593 --> 00:03:39.497\nAnd we can get in here and we can manage\nwhat applications, oops sorry about that,\n\n76\n00:03:39.497 --> 00:03:43.994\nwhat applications can actually run or\ncannot run on our machines, right?\n\n77\n00:03:43.994 --> 00:03:48.392\nSo great little utility to have\nin your Administrative Tools.\n\n78\n00:03:48.392 --> 00:03:49.868\nThis ODBC, right?\n\n79\n00:03:49.868 --> 00:03:51.161\nYou'll notice if we hover, right?\n\n80\n00:03:51.161 --> 00:03:53.673\nIt says, Maintains ODBC data sources and\ndrivers.\n\n81\n00:03:53.673 --> 00:03:56.110\nDrivers, what does that mean?\n\n82\n00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.282\nThe ODBC-\n&gt;&gt; Wes, I have a question.\n\n83\n00:03:58.282 --> 00:03:58.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n\n84\n00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:59.382\n&gt;&gt; What does that mean?\n\n85\n00:03:59.382 --> 00:04:00.898\n&gt;&gt; I knew that was where you were going.\n\n86\n00:04:00.898 --> 00:04:02.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I figured, that's right,\n\n87\n00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.740\nthat's the Open Database Community.\n\n88\n00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:04.807\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And essentially,\n\n89\n00:04:04.807 --> 00:04:09.221\nthis allows you to connect to a database,\nconnect this machine to a database, right?\n\n90\n00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:10.054\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n91\n00:04:10.054 --> 00:04:13.380\n&gt;&gt; If you're a DBA, if you're\nworking with database administration\n\n92\n00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.021\nAdministrative Tools, right?\n\n93\n00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:18.670\nI can kinda put the pieces of\nthe puzzle together there.\n\n94\n00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.130\nAnd then again, 32-bit versus 64-bit\nis exactly what it sounds like.\n\n95\n00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.060\nPerformance monitor, and I know we\nhaven't talked about architecture.\n\n96\n00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.446\nSo let me go ahead and not just assume.\n\n97\n00:04:29.446 --> 00:04:34.505\n32-bit operating system,\n32-bit application, 32-bit operating\n\n98\n00:04:34.505 --> 00:04:39.660\nsystem can run both 32-bit and\n64-bit, hence why we have two here.\n\n99\n00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.507\nBut this at least gives you the ability,\nif you are gonna use 64-bit platform,\n\n100\n00:04:43.507 --> 00:04:45.366\nyou could choose that as an option too.\n\n101\n00:04:45.366 --> 00:04:45.931\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n102\n00:04:45.931 --> 00:04:48.314\n&gt;&gt; Performance Monitor,\nanother great utility here.\n\n103\n00:04:48.314 --> 00:04:52.305\nAnd let's go ahead and\nopen this up to Performance Monitor.\n\n104\n00:04:52.305 --> 00:04:58.570\nI absolutely love this utility that is\nbuilt right into our operating system.\n\n105\n00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.421\nNow, we can get real time information,\na performance data if you will.\n\n106\n00:05:02.421 --> 00:05:04.371\nAnd they kinda say that right here,\n\n107\n00:05:04.371 --> 00:05:06.974\nyou can get a great\nexplanation of what it does.\n\n108\n00:05:06.974 --> 00:05:10.783\nAnd it talks about viewing performance\ndata and real time or log file, right?\n\n109\n00:05:10.783 --> 00:05:14.294\nWell, we do that the log file,\nwe create what's known as a DCS, right?\n\n110\n00:05:14.294 --> 00:05:17.014\nA Data Collector Set, and\nyou can do that up here, and\n\n111\n00:05:17.014 --> 00:05:19.147\nthere are some that are already defined.\n\n112\n00:05:19.147 --> 00:05:23.242\nData Collector Set are the attributes that\nyou wanna collect performance on, right?\n\n113\n00:05:23.242 --> 00:05:26.864\nSo for instance, you can see in the\nmemory, we've got a couple of things that\n\n114\n00:05:26.864 --> 00:05:31.011\nwe're actually looking at, the available\nmegabytes, the cache and faults, right?\n\n115\n00:05:31.011 --> 00:05:33.940\nNetwork interface, there's some\nattributes that we're looking at.\n\n116\n00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.046\nPhysical Disk, while these are two\ndifferent attributes of the Physical Disk\n\n117\n00:05:37.046 --> 00:05:38.044\nthat we're looking at.\n\n118\n00:05:38.044 --> 00:05:41.355\nThe percent Idle Time, and\nthe Average Disk Queue Length, again,\n\n119\n00:05:41.355 --> 00:05:42.761\ntwo different attributes.\n\n120\n00:05:42.761 --> 00:05:45.262\nThese would be the collector, all right?\n\n121\n00:05:45.262 --> 00:05:49.038\nThe Data Collector Set is this is an\nattribute that I'm gonna put within this\n\n122\n00:05:49.038 --> 00:05:52.884\nset, collect them together, and\nthen I'm gonna run this as a test, right?\n\n123\n00:05:52.884 --> 00:05:56.588\nAnd that's what we can do here if you\nlook at Data Collector Sets you have\n\n124\n00:05:56.588 --> 00:06:00.509\nUser Defined, which should be empty\ncuz I haven't defined anything yet.\n\n125\n00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:02.690\n&gt;&gt; RIght.\n&gt;&gt; And then they have some that are just\n\n126\n00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:03.652\nSystem, right?\n\n127\n00:06:03.652 --> 00:06:07.953\nDifferent System Diagnostics, and\nI can right-click and I can choose Start.\n\n128\n00:06:07.953 --> 00:06:11.338\nAnd if I start this, and let it run for\na second, it might not really show\n\n129\n00:06:11.338 --> 00:06:15.136\na lot of information cuz I don't have a\nlot of activity going on on this machine.\n\n130\n00:06:15.136 --> 00:06:18.391\nBut once we do that,\nwe can then stop that, and\n\n131\n00:06:18.391 --> 00:06:23.412\nthen once we've run that test you'll\nsee the little hourglass there.\n\n132\n00:06:23.412 --> 00:06:27.188\nAnd what it's doing is it's taking\nthat information and it's capturing,\n\n133\n00:06:27.188 --> 00:06:30.672\ncollecting all of that information and\nit's throwing it into a file.\n\n134\n00:06:30.672 --> 00:06:34.441\nThat hopefully, now that that, you should\nnotice that the hourglass is gone there.\n\n135\n00:06:34.441 --> 00:06:36.561\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; That lets me know that I can come down\n\n136\n00:06:36.561 --> 00:06:38.543\nunder here, under System, and look for\n\n137\n00:06:38.543 --> 00:06:41.122\nthe specific log that it is\nthat we want to work with.\n\n138\n00:06:41.122 --> 00:06:43.262\nAnd I can see System Diagnostics,\nWIN10CLIENT.\n\n139\n00:06:43.262 --> 00:06:48.417\nAnd when we load this up, it's gonna\nload the real time information, right?\n\n140\n00:06:48.417 --> 00:06:51.518\nFor the diagnostic reports, so\nit shows me, hey, there's some errors,\n\n141\n00:06:51.518 --> 00:06:53.453\nthere's a device that's disabled, right?\n\n142\n00:06:53.453 --> 00:06:56.672\nSo you can get basically,\nOS checks, right?\n\n143\n00:06:56.672 --> 00:06:59.202\nA lot of it,\na lot of great information in here.\n\n144\n00:06:59.202 --> 00:07:02.160\nSo the built in one is perfect.\n\n145\n00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.649\nI will tell you though, if you want to\ntailor make these to, like for instance,\n\n146\n00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:10.010\nif I wanna monitor the four horsemen,\nas I call it, right?\n\n147\n00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.249\nThe four troublemakers when\nit comes to your resources.\n\n148\n00:07:12.249 --> 00:07:13.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Could be your resource\n\n149\n00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:14.863\ntroublemakers, right?\n\n150\n00:07:14.863 --> 00:07:19.498\nAnd that's your memory, disk,\nnetwork, and CPU, right?\n\n151\n00:07:19.498 --> 00:07:22.378\nYour processing power, well,\nI can come in here and\n\n152\n00:07:22.378 --> 00:07:24.481\nI can create a new Data Collector Set.\n\n153\n00:07:24.481 --> 00:07:28.643\nAnd I might say this is a,\nI don't know, Performance,\n\n154\n00:07:28.643 --> 00:07:33.353\nif I could spell performance\nwe'll be doing good, Baseline.\n\n155\n00:07:33.353 --> 00:07:38.442\nAnd I wanna know, hey, what's the\nperformance of this computer currently?\n\n156\n00:07:38.442 --> 00:07:42.314\nSo I'll create this manually,\nchoose Next, and I'll say, you know what?\n\n157\n00:07:42.314 --> 00:07:45.772\nIn this Data Collector Set,\nwhat it is that I wanna do, right?\n\n158\n00:07:45.772 --> 00:07:48.314\nDo I want Performance counter,\nwhich is what we're gonna use.\n\n159\n00:07:48.314 --> 00:07:51.768\nSystem configuration information,\nI'm gonna use the Performance counter.\n\n160\n00:07:51.768 --> 00:07:52.527\nChoose Next,\n\n161\n00:07:52.527 --> 00:07:56.399\nand then notice the performance counters,\nwe don't have any, right?\n\n162\n00:07:56.399 --> 00:08:01.082\nSo we just told performance monitor,\nThis is the type of test.\n\n163\n00:08:01.082 --> 00:08:03.911\nThese are the attributes that\nI wanna put in this DCS.\n\n164\n00:08:03.911 --> 00:08:06.925\nBut now it's up to us to find\nthose attributes, right?\n\n165\n00:08:06.925 --> 00:08:09.140\n&gt;&gt; A-ha.\nSo we choose Add, and then, remember,\n\n166\n00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.481\nwe looked at Processor?\n\n167\n00:08:10.481 --> 00:08:16.582\nIf you select a category or the component\nit selects all the attributes by default.\n\n168\n00:08:16.582 --> 00:08:20.980\nJust all you have to do is select one and\nit will deselect all the other ones.\n\n169\n00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:25.092\nBut remember there was a present idle time\nthat was in that list that we seen by\n\n170\n00:08:25.092 --> 00:08:25.680\ndefault.\n\n171\n00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:31.139\nWell I can choose which of the devices\nthat I want to add this for.\n\n172\n00:08:31.139 --> 00:08:33.380\nSo you might have multiple\nnetwork adapters here.\n\n173\n00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.251\nYou could have more than one physical CPU\nin a machine if it happens to be a server.\n\n174\n00:08:36.251 --> 00:08:42.278\nSo you might say, hey this is the one\ninstance of this processor, right?\n\n175\n00:08:42.278 --> 00:08:44.160\nI'm just looking at this processor.\n\n176\n00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.310\nNotice that by default it's\ngoing total all instances, but\n\n177\n00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:50.870\nyou can see that there might be\ndifferent processors in here.\n\n178\n00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.761\nThat is, let's say,\nthat's one from processor.\n\n179\n00:08:52.761 --> 00:08:54.142\nLet's go ahead and\nscroll down a little bit.\n\n180\n00:08:54.142 --> 00:08:55.493\nLet's find another one here.\n\n181\n00:08:55.493 --> 00:08:59.129\nI'm gonna scroll down to System.\n\n182\n00:08:59.129 --> 00:09:01.069\nThere should be one down\nhere called System.\n\n183\n00:09:01.069 --> 00:09:03.860\nAnd we'll go ahead, and\nI'll add everything from the System.\n\n184\n00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:08.030\nAnd we'll notice the difference\nbetween adding a single\n\n185\n00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:09.410\ncharacteristic of a component.\n\n186\n00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:12.090\nNotice, Zach,\nit tells me what that characteristic is.\n\n187\n00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:13.625\nYou notice that asterisk\nsymbol right there?\n\n188\n00:09:13.625 --> 00:09:14.950\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; That's a wildcard, and\n\n189\n00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:18.430\nwhat that says essentially is hey, I want\nyou to take very attribute that's under\n\n190\n00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:20.340\nSystem and\nthrow it in this data collector set.\n\n191\n00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.950\nNot just one or the other.\n\n192\n00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.650\nTake the whole bunch, the whole bundle.\n\n193\n00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:29.470\n&gt;&gt; You know what's really impressive to me\nis, you can do so much, from just here.\n\n194\n00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:31.600\nWe're not even on a command line.\n\n195\n00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.515\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nAbsolutely, all we've got.\n\n196\n00:09:33.515 --> 00:09:35.130\nI'm glad you mentioned that.\n\n197\n00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.640\nAll we've got into is one\naspect of Control Panel.\n\n198\n00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.160\nAnd more specifically,\nthe Administrative Tool.\n\n199\n00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.740\nSo, we can choose OK to this, right?\n\n200\n00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.590\nAnd I can say, well how long do I\nwant the sample interval to be?\n\n201\n00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.300\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust kinda reduce this, just for\n\n202\n00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.140\nthe purposes of our recording here.\n\n203\n00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.450\nAnd I'll just say hey,\nI'll do three seconds.\n\n204\n00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:55.710\nChoose next,\nkeep the logs the way they are.\n\n205\n00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.600\nAnd I could run this data collector\nset if I wanted to right now.\n\n206\n00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.030\nI could say hey,\nstart this data collector set now.\n\n207\n00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:04.570\nI'm just gonna say, just save and close so\nwe can show you before it starts running.\n\n208\n00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:07.583\nAnd now notice that before I didn't\nhave anything under user defined.\n\n209\n00:10:07.583 --> 00:10:09.236\nNow I have something under user defined.\n\n210\n00:10:09.236 --> 00:10:11.359\nI have a data collector set, or a DCS.\n\n211\n00:10:11.359 --> 00:10:13.054\nI always call them DCS's,\n\n212\n00:10:13.054 --> 00:10:15.260\nbut be careful with the acronyms\nif you've never seen them before.\n\n213\n00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:16.930\nThat acronym doesn't\nmake any sense to you.\n\n214\n00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:17.850\n&gt;&gt; And there's so many of them.\n\n215\n00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.290\n&gt;&gt; And there are, there really are.\n\n216\n00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:23.170\nIf we right click on our performance\nbaseline here we can choose start,\n\n217\n00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:24.806\njust like we did in system diagnostics.\n\n218\n00:10:24.806 --> 00:10:26.487\nLadies and\ngentlemen it isn't really any different.\n\n219\n00:10:26.487 --> 00:10:29.935\nBut what it gives me the ability to\ndo is actually kinda tailor these to\n\n220\n00:10:29.935 --> 00:10:31.980\nthe components that I want to.\n\n221\n00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.560\nFind out what are their\nperformance attributes, right?\n\n222\n00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.750\nAnd once this is done, we'll go ahead,\nand just kinda stop it,\n\n223\n00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.230\nsee if we can get a little\nbit of information.\n\n224\n00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:42.150\nThe last one was a nice\nsystems diagnostic report.\n\n225\n00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:43.789\nI want you to see the output, right?\n\n226\n00:10:43.789 --> 00:10:45.450\nBecause I can see Performance Monitor.\n\n227\n00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:48.527\nI can see these attributes.\n\n228\n00:10:48.527 --> 00:10:53.170\nThis is a default data collector set,\nand really it's not really a DCS.\n\n229\n00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:55.560\nBecause of the fact that it only\nhas percent processor time.\n\n230\n00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.620\nBut I can see the real time information.\n\n231\n00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.570\nRemember we said that\nreal time information, or\n\n232\n00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:00.956\nsaving that information to a log.\n\n233\n00:11:00.956 --> 00:11:02.230\nWell that's what we just did.\n\n234\n00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:03.636\n&gt;&gt; And Wes this is just,\n\n235\n00:11:03.636 --> 00:11:07.710\na lot of this is about monitoring\nthe health of your machines.\n\n236\n00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:08.970\n&gt;&gt; It really is right?\n\n237\n00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:10.139\nAnd if you say health, right?\n\n238\n00:11:10.139 --> 00:11:12.153\nBecause some people might\nsay well I think of health.\n\n239\n00:11:12.153 --> 00:11:13.770\nI don't think of performance.\n\n240\n00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:14.660\nI think of security.\n\n241\n00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:15.860\nWell they're both, right?\n\n242\n00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.759\nYou have security based lines, and\nyou have performance based lines.\n\n243\n00:11:17.759 --> 00:11:21.110\nSo this is the health of a machine\nfrom a performance aspect.\n\n244\n00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:22.184\nSo yes, you're right.\n\n245\n00:11:22.184 --> 00:11:25.356\nSo now that I've run that\nperformance base line.\n\n246\n00:11:25.356 --> 00:11:26.670\nYou know, I don't know if I did.\n\n247\n00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:27.890\nBut we can always find out.\n\n248\n00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:31.142\nIf you go under,\nyep I've got one, so, right.\n\n249\n00:11:31.142 --> 00:11:34.082\nI couldn't remember if I started it or\nstopped it or not, right?\n\n250\n00:11:34.082 --> 00:11:36.097\nAnd once we stopped, and\nwhen I load this one up,\n\n251\n00:11:36.097 --> 00:11:37.830\nit looks a little bit different, right?\n\n252\n00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:40.160\nYou can see that it's a little different\nthan the last one we looked at.\n\n253\n00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.110\nThis one is just a generalized report.\n\n254\n00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:46.795\nThis one actually gives me the statistics\nand it's hard to kinda figure out.\n\n255\n00:11:46.795 --> 00:11:50.230\nWell, I don't know which\none is which here, right?\n\n256\n00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:53.630\nWell they do allow you to do\nsomething that's really cool.\n\n257\n00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.090\nNotice this highlighter feature,\nall right.\n\n258\n00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:57.460\nYou got some options here.\n\n259\n00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:59.340\nYou can change what the view is.\n\n260\n00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:02.350\nLike for instance,\nif I want a histogram approach, right?\n\n261\n00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:06.485\nI can do the histogram bar, or I can do\njust, in general, give me the text, right?\n\n262\n00:12:06.485 --> 00:12:08.997\nMaybe I just wanna throw this into\na text file and send it over to Zach.\n\n263\n00:12:08.997 --> 00:12:11.236\nAnd Zach can open it up and say okay Wes.\n\n264\n00:12:11.236 --> 00:12:14.220\nI do see your processes.\n\n265\n00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.490\nSo you got a lot of processes running,\nright, a lot of threats or whatever.\n\n266\n00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:19.920\nHe can analyze that information.\n\n267\n00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.540\nBut if you happen to be in\nthat other view, again,\n\n268\n00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:25.870\nthat gets a little,\nthe line graph, if you will.\n\n269\n00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.750\nAnd you're not sure which one is which,\njust choose Highlighter.\n\n270\n00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:32.180\nAnd then go down here and select\nwhich one it was that you wanna see.\n\n271\n00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:35.550\nAnd you'll notice that even though it's\nnot highlighting in the sense that we\n\n272\n00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:38.760\nthink, the yellow highlighter,\nbut you can see it, right?\n\n273\n00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.060\nSo, another great one,\nPerformance Monitor.\n\n274\n00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.110\nI absolutely love this.\n\n275\n00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.899\nPrint management.\n\n276\n00:12:42.899 --> 00:12:45.212\nHere's the next one in the list, and\nyou can see they're alphabetically for us.\n\n277\n00:12:45.212 --> 00:12:51.040\nSo it's great for\njust kinda keeping them in order.\n\n278\n00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.010\nPrint management,\ngreat utility to have as well.\n\n279\n00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:56.270\nYour Windows client operating systems.\n\n280\n00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:59.300\nThey can be print servers, which means\nthey can control the print queues for\n\n281\n00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:00.920\nmultiple network based printers.\n\n282\n00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.521\nAnd even the printers that are locally\nconnected to the machines,\n\n283\n00:13:03.521 --> 00:13:04.735\nwhich is a great thing to have.\n\n284\n00:13:04.735 --> 00:13:06.143\nI don't have to do the whole sneaker net.\n\n285\n00:13:06.143 --> 00:13:08.345\nWe joke around, Zach and\nI, about sneaker net.\n\n286\n00:13:08.345 --> 00:13:11.770\nWalking from this place to this place\nwhen we actually got a network here that\n\n287\n00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:13.598\nwe can just send it via an email, right?\n\n288\n00:13:13.598 --> 00:13:16.400\nWell, this saves you the sneaker net\napproach to managing your network\n\n289\n00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.198\nprinters, right?\n\n290\n00:13:17.198 --> 00:13:18.295\nI have to walk to the printer.\n\n291\n00:13:18.295 --> 00:13:19.574\nI have to walk down.\n\n292\n00:13:19.574 --> 00:13:24.446\nIt could be just literally two\ncubicles down, I realize that.\n\n293\n00:13:24.446 --> 00:13:27.873\nBut hey, if we're busy,\nwe like to do centralized administration.\n\n294\n00:13:27.873 --> 00:13:30.010\nAnd that's what this\nadministrative tool allows us.\n\n295\n00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:31.458\nThe centralized administration.\n\n296\n00:13:31.458 --> 00:13:35.608\nThat I don't have to walk to every OSD,\nor on screen display, of the printers and\n\n297\n00:13:35.608 --> 00:13:37.818\nthe various locations within my company.\n\n298\n00:13:37.818 --> 00:13:41.072\nI can manage them,\nincluding their drivers,\n\n299\n00:13:41.072 --> 00:13:43.666\nall from a single location, right?\n\n300\n00:13:43.666 --> 00:13:45.501\nAnd you've got drivers that are built in.\n\n301\n00:13:45.501 --> 00:13:48.825\nNot every driver is built in,\nthough, I will tell you.\n\n302\n00:13:48.825 --> 00:13:53.558\nBecause for instance, you can see that\nI have some drivers that were installed\n\n303\n00:13:53.558 --> 00:13:55.550\nby connecting to the printer, right?\n\n304\n00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:57.240\nAnd you can see there's\ndifferent printers, right?\n\n305\n00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:00.520\nAnd it keeps all those drivers right\nthere where I can manage them in\n\n306\n00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:01.420\na single location.\n\n307\n00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:05.680\nSo that's a great utility to have.\n\n308\n00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.300\nAnd again that's\ncentralized administration.\n\n309\n00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:12.180\nNow, recovery drive might or\nmight not be In your Control Panel.\n\n310\n00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.830\nIt just really depends, or\nyour Administrative Tools.\n\n311\n00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:16.910\nI will tell you that it\ndoes differ a little bit.\n\n312\n00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:19.880\nSo for instance, down here,\none of the things that I don't see.\n\n313\n00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:23.020\nI don't see Windows PowerShell, and\n\n314\n00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:25.550\nwhat's known as the Integrated\nScripting Environment, right?\n\n315\n00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:26.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n316\n00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.230\n&gt;&gt; It's gone, right?\n\n317\n00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n318\n00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:30.510\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's still here, right?\n\n319\n00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.429\nSo if I type in here PowerShell.\n\n320\n00:14:34.625 --> 00:14:36.200\nISE.\n\n321\n00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.820\nNotice that it is here, right?\n\n322\n00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.300\nBut it's not in Administrative Tools.\n\n323\n00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.210\nAnd I just wanna make you guys and\ngals aware of that out there.\n\n324\n00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:47.290\nBecause if I jump back to\nour Windows 8 machine and\n\n325\n00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:48.790\nwe'll have to get logged back in.\n\n326\n00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:52.260\nIt's lying to me,\ntelling me I was still logged in.\n\n327\n00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:53.035\nI call shenanigans.\n\n328\n00:14:53.035 --> 00:14:57.050\n[LAUGH] And I get down to\nAdministrative Tools here, and\n\n329\n00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:00.150\nwe bring the Administrative Tools for\na Windows 8.1 machine.\n\n330\n00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:02.480\nYou notice that if I scroll down I see\n\n331\n00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:06.800\nWindows PowerShell Integrated Scripting\nEnvironment and the PowerShell here.\n\n332\n00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.670\nAll right, and that's just because, again,\n\n333\n00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:11.253\nPowerShell, they really want\nyou to adopt PowerShell, right?\n\n334\n00:15:11.253 --> 00:15:13.808\nSo they're saying, hey, we're not\nleaving this in Administrative Tools.\n\n335\n00:15:13.808 --> 00:15:17.232\nWe're gonna make it a little bit easier\nfor you to get to it, because, hint, hint,\n\n336\n00:15:17.232 --> 00:15:17.820\nlook up here.\n\n337\n00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:19.270\nWe really want you to use it, right?\n\n338\n00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:23.050\nSo it is in your Administrative Tools.\n\n339\n00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:25.140\nRecovery Drive allows\nyou to do exactly that.\n\n340\n00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:29.130\nIt allows you to create a bootable USB\ndevice that you can put your operating\n\n341\n00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:30.980\nsystem on, a full system image.\n\n342\n00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:33.860\nIncluding what's known as\nthe recovery environment.\n\n343\n00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.120\nAnd you can boot to that USB device and\n\n344\n00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.940\nrestore your hard drive from\nbare metal if you need to.\n\n345\n00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.100\nShould you run into issues.\n\n346\n00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.490\nHence the term recovery drive.\n\n347\n00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:43.520\nBackup and recovery.\n\n348\n00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.530\nResource Monitor.\n\n349\n00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:47.158\nNow Resource Monitor is a really,\nreally good utility.\n\n350\n00:15:47.158 --> 00:15:52.110\nIt's another one like\nPerformance Monitor that I really like.\n\n351\n00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:55.294\nThis allows you to look at\nthe various resources, and\n\n352\n00:15:55.294 --> 00:15:59.559\nagain remember I always joke around,\nI say the four horsemen, right?\n\n353\n00:15:59.559 --> 00:16:00.713\nWell here they are.\n\n354\n00:16:00.713 --> 00:16:01.240\n&gt;&gt; There they is.\n\n355\n00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.922\n&gt;&gt; CPU, Disk, Network and Memory, right?\n\n356\n00:16:03.922 --> 00:16:07.190\nAnd I wanna know, I've got a process\nthat's running on this machine.\n\n357\n00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:11.000\nI want to know, what are the resources\nthat this process is actually taking?\n\n358\n00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.060\nSo in the overview tab, I could say, okay,\n\n359\n00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:17.928\nwell, performance monitor is actually\nrunning the background, right?\n\n360\n00:16:17.928 --> 00:16:22.326\nSo I wanna find out, how much CPU, memory\ndisk, and network utilization is being\n\n361\n00:16:22.326 --> 00:16:25.477\ntaken or consumed, if you will,\nby this single process?\n\n362\n00:16:25.477 --> 00:16:30.732\nWell, I can go over here and I can see\nwell, perfmon is using some of my CPU.\n\n363\n00:16:30.732 --> 00:16:35.040\nIt isn't using any of my services,\nhandles, let's see.\n\n364\n00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.720\nGot a lot of handles that are going on.\n\n365\n00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:42.871\nRight, so I can see what resources\na specific device is using or a process.\n\n366\n00:16:42.871 --> 00:16:46.839\nIf I uncheck this, then what I get is\nan overall view in real time including\n\n367\n00:16:46.839 --> 00:16:50.618\nan activity monitor, if you will,\nof resources that are being used.\n\n368\n00:16:50.618 --> 00:16:51.273\n&gt;&gt; That's amazing.\n\n369\n00:16:51.273 --> 00:16:53.630\n&gt;&gt; It's really, really cool utility.\n\n370\n00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:55.910\nAnd what I like again is\njust that filtering, right.\n\n371\n00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:57.830\nThis is the,\n\n372\n00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:02.170\nDWM is the desktop Windows manager, it's\na service that runs in the background.\n\n373\n00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:04.450\nAnd if I wanna find out\nwhat is it consuming,\n\n374\n00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:06.970\nwell it isn't consuming\nanything on the disk.\n\n375\n00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:07.990\nIt isn't consuming, well.\n\n376\n00:17:09.444 --> 00:17:14.314\nI look at these, these are real-time,\nbut it doesn't necessarily mean\n\n377\n00:17:14.314 --> 00:17:19.120\nthat that's real-time utilization\non a single component or a thread.\n\n378\n00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.000\nYeah and it doesn't look like\nit's really using anything.\n\n379\n00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.660\nIt's using a little bit of your CPU,\nlet's find out, let's find out,\n\n380\n00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:26.050\nlet's go through this again.\n\n381\n00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:28.130\nAnd it's using handles there we go.\n\n382\n00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:31.965\nSo modules that are associated with it,\nand I can see the dynamic link library\n\n383\n00:17:31.965 --> 00:17:34.797\nfiles that the desktop Windows\nmanager is pulling out and\n\n384\n00:17:34.797 --> 00:17:37.282\nutilizing to access\nadditional functionality.\n\n385\n00:17:37.282 --> 00:17:41.693\nAs well as where are those files located,\nso a lot of good information here.\n\n386\n00:17:41.693 --> 00:17:42.788\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n387\n00:17:42.788 --> 00:17:44.700\n&gt;&gt; So yeah that's your resource monitor,\nright.\n\n388\n00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.365\nThen we also have the services\nconsole here, and\n\n389\n00:17:47.365 --> 00:17:49.841\nthe services console's another great one.\n\n390\n00:17:49.841 --> 00:17:53.067\nAnd we're definitely going to\nbe seeing some of these two,\n\n391\n00:17:53.067 --> 00:17:55.204\nmore practical application of these.\n\n392\n00:17:55.204 --> 00:17:56.331\nNot just an explanation but\n\n393\n00:17:56.331 --> 00:17:59.910\nmore of a practical application cuz you'll\nsee me going to computer management a lot.\n\n394\n00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:01.691\nYou'll see me going to\nthe services console.\n\n395\n00:18:01.691 --> 00:18:05.006\nZach you mentioned the command line, we're\ngonna see, we drop it down to the command\n\n396\n00:18:05.006 --> 00:18:07.600\nline and performing a function and\nsee how that relates to our GUI.\n\n397\n00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:11.630\nSo we're gonna see more\nof these coming up.\n\n398\n00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:14.570\nAnd again, we'll talk more about services,\nbut those background process,\n\n399\n00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:16.940\ndifference between an application and\na service, right?\n\n400\n00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:20.546\nApplication is something that\nZach launches, all right?\n\n401\n00:18:20.546 --> 00:18:24.642\nI launch Office, right, you launch let's\nsay Chrome, or I guess it's an MTA,\n\n402\n00:18:24.642 --> 00:18:27.970\nwe should say something like\nInternet Explorer or Edge, right?\n\n403\n00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:30.290\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; You're launching that application.\n\n404\n00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:33.880\nServices are processes that\ntypically you don't interact with.\n\n405\n00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.820\nThey are a functionality that\nthe operating system needs to call on.\n\n406\n00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:40.310\nNow you can interact with them and\nthat's your services console here.\n\n407\n00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:44.040\nYou can see what the current status is\nof the services that are on the machine,\n\n408\n00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.730\nif they're in a running state.\n\n409\n00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:47.763\nHow are they triggered?\n\n410\n00:18:47.763 --> 00:18:50.021\nAnd what I mean by triggered\nis their startup type.\n\n411\n00:18:50.021 --> 00:18:52.779\nAnd I've gotta be careful with that one\ncuz there's actually a startup type\n\n412\n00:18:52.779 --> 00:18:54.755\ncalled, triggered if I look\nat the properties here.\n\n413\n00:18:54.755 --> 00:18:55.320\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n414\n00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.790\n&gt;&gt; I could take a specific service and\nI can say, okay,\n\n415\n00:18:57.790 --> 00:18:59.190\nit's startup type is automatic.\n\n416\n00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:04.200\nI can look and if I wanna change that, or\nI could start and stop the service, right?\n\n417\n00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.630\nSo for instance,\nlet me give you an example,\n\n418\n00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:10.030\nsometimes printing will go haywire,\nbecause that's just want printers do.\n\n419\n00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:11.440\nThey hate us.\n\n420\n00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.130\nJust kidding.\n\n421\n00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:16.120\nBut, sometimes you need to restart\nthe print spooler service,\n\n422\n00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.560\nbecause according to Microsoft and\naccording to Windows,\n\n423\n00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.410\nit kinda is the printer,\neven though we don't see it that way.\n\n424\n00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:25.520\nSo I might need to come in here,\nand if I notice that like for\n\n425\n00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:29.590\ninstance my print jobs are showing\nup in the print queue.\n\n426\n00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:32.370\nBut nothing's being printed, then what\nI might have to do is come in here and\n\n427\n00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:34.920\nI might actually have to stop\nthe Print Spooler service.\n\n428\n00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.427\nAnd then restart the principle or service.\n\n429\n00:19:38.427 --> 00:19:41.027\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; So we're manipulating that service that\n\n430\n00:19:41.027 --> 00:19:45.440\ntypically we don't work with right,\nlike an application which we do work with.\n\n431\n00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:49.710\nAnd that essentially, what it does, is it\njust reboots the principle or service, and\n\n432\n00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:53.840\nthe printing process essentially\ncan hopefully restart.\n\n433\n00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:59.610\nAll right, now here are two utilities\nthat I'm gonna speak briefly on because,\n\n434\n00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:03.540\nboy, we are gonna utilize these a lot.\n\n435\n00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:06.370\nOne is system configuration.\n\n436\n00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:08.130\nAnd with the system configuration,\n\n437\n00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:11.740\nI want you to know that there's\nanother way that we launch this.\n\n438\n00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:14.600\nThis is also called MS config, all right?\n\n439\n00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.680\nSystem configuration, and\nlet me show you what I mean by that.\n\n440\n00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:22.840\nIf I go ahead and I close down system\nconfiguration, we come down to, basically,\n\n441\n00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:30.420\nour search field, and\nI type in MS, oops, MS config.\n\n442\n00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:31.870\nI swear I can do it.\n\n443\n00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:34.730\nNotice we also have the system\nconfiguration utility.\n\n444\n00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:35.890\nIt's the same utility, right.\n\n445\n00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:39.390\nSo MS config system configuration,\none and the same.\n\n446\n00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:43.840\nIt allows me to modify how Windows boots,\nthe boot time, the boot process.\n\n447\n00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.130\nFor instance, do I load all of my devices?\n\n448\n00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.275\nAnd what that means when\nthey say load all device,\n\n449\n00:20:48.275 --> 00:20:51.210\nwell they do say device drivers,\nbasically,\n\n450\n00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:55.500\ndo I want to initialize every single piece\nof hardware that is in this machine?\n\n451\n00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:00.710\nSo for diagnostic purposes, sometimes what\nyou want is you don't want your third\n\n452\n00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:04.670\nparty drivers to be launched up, so\nyou leave them out of your boot process.\n\n453\n00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:06.940\nAnd again,\nyou can do things like boot logging.\n\n454\n00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:13.440\nSo for instance, if I wanted to log\nall of the boot time environment.\n\n455\n00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.455\nI could do a boot log here and\nthen I could restart the machine.\n\n456\n00:21:16.455 --> 00:21:22.096\nAnd when I restart the machine,\nI can go down and look into C:Windows and\n\n457\n00:21:22.096 --> 00:21:28.407\nsearch for a log that is NTBTlog.txt and\nI can find that log of drivers and stuff.\n\n458\n00:21:28.407 --> 00:21:31.651\nThe file systems, ACPI, the advanced\nconfiguration power interface,\n\n459\n00:21:31.651 --> 00:21:34.760\nthat driver launch, all the grouping\ndrivers that load at boot time.\n\n460\n00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:38.940\n&gt;&gt; And what's really great about this,\nWes, is that you're doing such a fantastic\n\n461\n00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:43.200\njob and this information is coming\nfast and furious, but this is a video.\n\n462\n00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.413\nI can stop it, I can replay it,\nI can watch it again.\n\n463\n00:21:46.413 --> 00:21:48.761\nIt's just that you're doing a great job,\nI just wanted to mention that.\n\n464\n00:21:48.761 --> 00:21:51.720\n&gt;&gt; I appreciate it, and do that.\n\n465\n00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:52.820\nTake Zach's advice.\n\n466\n00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.930\nIf you feel like we're hitting\nyou sometimes with a fire hose,\n\n467\n00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:57.450\nespecially if this is the first time\nyou've seen the Windows operating system,\n\n468\n00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:59.235\nit can be a little intimidating.\n\n469\n00:21:59.235 --> 00:22:03.475\nWe wanna make sure that we give you\na good foundation when it comes to the OS\n\n470\n00:22:03.475 --> 00:22:04.459\nfundamentals.\n\n471\n00:22:04.459 --> 00:22:07.464\nThat's fundamentals, right,\nyou have to have that solid foundation.\n\n472\n00:22:07.464 --> 00:22:08.426\n&gt;&gt; Yes, sir.\n&gt;&gt; So that's why we're\n\n473\n00:22:08.426 --> 00:22:09.465\nspending time to do this.\n\n474\n00:22:09.465 --> 00:22:11.365\nWe also see things like services.\n\n475\n00:22:11.365 --> 00:22:14.215\nNotice, there's a few different ways\nthat you can see services inside of your\n\n476\n00:22:14.215 --> 00:22:15.235\nWindows operating system.\n\n477\n00:22:15.235 --> 00:22:18.932\nThis happens to be the one that,\nanother way that you can do this.\n\n478\n00:22:18.932 --> 00:22:22.921\nStartup, startup was actually moved,\nexam alert, exam alert.\n\n479\n00:22:22.921 --> 00:22:24.894\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; System configuration utility is\n\n480\n00:22:24.894 --> 00:22:26.913\nactually changed, and\nlet me show you what I mean.\n\n481\n00:22:26.913 --> 00:22:32.120\nBecause the startup tab is the way I can\nmanipulate and configure startup items.\n\n482\n00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.480\nApplication might put a process and\n\n483\n00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:38.130\nit might want it to start up the moment\nthe computer starts up, right?\n\n484\n00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:39.620\nDo you need that process?\n\n485\n00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:40.860\nI'm not sure if you do or not.\n\n486\n00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:44.540\nOne of the ones that, boy how many\nones can I get in the same sentence?\n\n487\n00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:46.650\nOne of the ones is OneDrive.\n\n488\n00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:48.080\nLet's say it to completion.\n\n489\n00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:52.910\nOne of the ones is OneDrive and it likes\nto connect out to OneDrive the moment you\n\n490\n00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:55.970\nturn your computer on, especially if\nyou're using your Microsoft account.\n\n491\n00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:59.340\nWell, if you're not connected, or\nif you're not using a Microsoft account.\n\n492\n00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:02.100\nBut you're not connected to OneDrive, well\nyou don't need that service to start up.\n\n493\n00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:03.080\nYou can disable it.\n\n494\n00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:06.340\nHowever, if I see something like Windows\nDefender Security in here, which is\n\n495\n00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:11.050\nmy malware, anti-malware software,\nchances are I shouldn't disable that.\n\n496\n00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:11.970\n&gt;&gt; Let me show you what I mean here,\n\n497\n00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:14.660\nbecause now if we choose\nOpen Task Manager,\n\n498\n00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:18.720\nall of this is done right here from\nthe Startup tab within Task Manager.\n\n499\n00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:19.740\n&gt;&gt; Which is amazing.\n\n500\n00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.986\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's something that\nstarted in Windows 8, and\n\n501\n00:23:22.986 --> 00:23:24.920\nit's that way in Windows 8.1.\n\n502\n00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.731\nLet me jump back to our Windows 7 machine.\n\n503\n00:23:26.731 --> 00:23:28.413\nLooks like my Windows 7 machine\nkind of timed out on me.\n\n504\n00:23:28.413 --> 00:23:29.611\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna see a movie, great.\n\n505\n00:23:29.611 --> 00:23:30.428\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n506\n00:23:30.428 --> 00:23:33.986\nSo rather than make you wait for\nthat boot process,\n\n507\n00:23:33.986 --> 00:23:36.486\nlet me also show you MSconfig here.\n\n508\n00:23:36.486 --> 00:23:40.378\nSo you can get to System\nConfiguration Utility as a systems or\n\n509\n00:23:40.378 --> 00:23:41.913\nadministrative tool.\n\n510\n00:23:41.913 --> 00:23:46.506\nAnd come down to the Start screen here or\nthe modern UI and\n\n511\n00:23:46.506 --> 00:23:51.218\nI can type in msconfig, and\nnotice the exe also comes up.\n\n512\n00:23:51.218 --> 00:23:55.315\nAnd we can do exactly, give it\na second here, and do the same thing.\n\n513\n00:23:55.315 --> 00:23:55.855\nAll right,\n\n514\n00:23:55.855 --> 00:23:59.703\nnow once that launches up you'll see that\npretty much the utility hasn't changed.\n\n515\n00:23:59.703 --> 00:24:01.822\nThere it is,\nit's pop under rather than pop up, right?\n\n516\n00:24:01.822 --> 00:24:04.602\nSame thing, and again you can\nsee Startup tab if I go here.\n\n517\n00:24:04.602 --> 00:24:07.959\nIt's saying, hey, It's in task manager.\n\n518\n00:24:07.959 --> 00:24:10.992\nIt's still taking a bit\nto launch that screen up.\n\n519\n00:24:10.992 --> 00:24:14.666\nI tell you what, we'll move on, we'll let\nthat machine go ahead and continue to boot\n\n520\n00:24:14.666 --> 00:24:18.050\nup and we'll move into our next one and\nI'll come back and show you what I mean.\n\n521\n00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:19.640\nThat start up tab was a little\nbit different that Windows 7.\n\n522\n00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.660\nAll right,\nwe also have system information.\n\n523\n00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:27.485\nAnd when we run system information,\nthis is a very detailed application or\n\n524\n00:24:27.485 --> 00:24:32.236\ngives very detailed information about\nthe whole entire configuration of\n\n525\n00:24:32.236 --> 00:24:36.620\nyour operating system, really,\nand everything surrounding it.\n\n526\n00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:41.186\nDrivers, environment variables if you\nwill, all of this is something that's\n\n527\n00:24:41.186 --> 00:24:45.752\nincluded and so definitely be aware of\nthat but Zach, like I was telling you with\n\n528\n00:24:45.752 --> 00:24:49.706\nMS configure this one also have\nanother one that you can launch too.\n\n529\n00:24:49.706 --> 00:24:53.540\nAnd we want to make you aware that\nour Windows 7 machine is back online.\n\n530\n00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:57.797\nSo let me go ahead before we get too much\nfurther from system configuration Zach.\n\n531\n00:24:57.797 --> 00:25:00.960\nAnd I think it would be really good to\nshow you guys what you will see prior\n\n532\n00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.024\nto Windows 8, right?\n\n533\n00:25:02.024 --> 00:25:02.790\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n534\n00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:07.004\n&gt;&gt; And if I go to Control Panel,\nStart Control Panel, System and\n\n535\n00:25:07.004 --> 00:25:11.057\nSecurity, Administrative Tools,\nI know I did that fast,\n\n536\n00:25:11.057 --> 00:25:14.152\nkeep in mind we've done\nthis a few times now.\n\n537\n00:25:14.152 --> 00:25:17.097\nGo back and\nwatch it if you're not aware of that.\n\n538\n00:25:17.097 --> 00:25:19.723\nNotice I have my\nSystem Configuration utility, but\n\n539\n00:25:19.723 --> 00:25:22.900\nyou're going to notice something\nthat is different, right?\n\n540\n00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:26.128\nNotice the tabs here, startup,\nI still have stuff in startup, right?\n\n541\n00:25:26.128 --> 00:25:26.651\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n542\n00:25:26.651 --> 00:25:28.313\nthis is where we used to see it, right?\n\n543\n00:25:28.313 --> 00:25:33.310\nTask manager in Windows 8.1,\nor again, Windows 8,\n\n544\n00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:40.090\nwas really redesigned and notice that\nhere in the task manager in Windows 7.\n\n545\n00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:42.010\nI don't have that startup tab.\n\n546\n00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:45.990\nSo I just want you to be aware of that\nbecause the exam might ask you about that.\n\n547\n00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:48.090\nBack to System Information, all right?\n\n548\n00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:49.377\nSo System Information,\n\n549\n00:25:49.377 --> 00:25:53.680\nagain detailed information you can also\nlaunch this by typing in and I'll zoom in.\n\n550\n00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.810\nLet me go ahead and type this real quick.\n\n551\n00:25:55.810 --> 00:26:01.189\nMsinfo, I think I'll wait to zoom in,\nso you guys don't see how bad I type.\n\n552\n00:26:01.189 --> 00:26:05.709\nMsinfo32 and if I scroll up to\nthe top of our Start menu here, or\n\n553\n00:26:05.709 --> 00:26:10.652\nStart button, you'll see that I\ncan choose system information, and\n\n554\n00:26:10.652 --> 00:26:12.860\nit launches the same utility.\n\n555\n00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:13.429\nSo one and the same.\n\n556\n00:26:13.429 --> 00:26:17.970\nMSinfo32 versus system information.\n\n557\n00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:20.728\nAll right, I know we're running\nclose to the end here on this one.\n\n558\n00:26:20.728 --> 00:26:24.088\nTask Scheduler, we've kind of talked\nabout in computer management,\n\n559\n00:26:24.088 --> 00:26:25.830\nI'll just kind of double back on it.\n\n560\n00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:28.932\nKeep in mind that whether you're launching\nthis from computer management or you're\n\n561\n00:26:28.932 --> 00:26:31.570\nlaunching it from the administrative\ntools, they are one and the same.\n\n562\n00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:36.982\nBut this allows you the ability to\njust create a basic task if you want,\n\n563\n00:26:36.982 --> 00:26:40.300\nor you can get very, very complex in here.\n\n564\n00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:43.480\nYou can see that you've\ngot a library here.\n\n565\n00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:46.850\nLet's see here,\nboy that's gonna take a long time.\n\n566\n00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:50.940\nAll the different components and we can\nbasically automate day to day tasks.\n\n567\n00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:55.617\nAnd if you know that you have\na really repetitive task that happens\n\n568\n00:26:55.617 --> 00:26:58.860\nevery single day, or\nmaybe every other day.\n\n569\n00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:02.676\nI'd forget my head if it\nwasn't attached to the neck.\n\n570\n00:27:02.676 --> 00:27:04.350\nI'd also forget how to say that too.\n\n571\n00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:05.805\n&gt;&gt; I'd forget my neck.\n&gt;&gt; You'd forget your neck.\n\n572\n00:27:05.805 --> 00:27:07.974\nAll right Zach, so I don't feel so bad.\n\n573\n00:27:07.974 --> 00:27:11.943\nBut if there are things that you wanna do\nwhen you want to make sure that you do\n\n574\n00:27:11.943 --> 00:27:15.093\nthem over and over, and\nyou wanna kind of set and forget it,\n\n575\n00:27:15.093 --> 00:27:16.740\nuse Task Scheduler, right?\n\n576\n00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:20.748\nAnd you can see that there are some things\nthat are already scheduled tasks to begin\n\n577\n00:27:20.748 --> 00:27:22.560\nwith, right, stand alone update.\n\n578\n00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:26.370\nNotice that it's automated\nUser_Feed_Synchronization.\n\n579\n00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:31.019\nAnd you could say, ready and it happens,\nwell, every day in this case, right?\n\n580\n00:27:31.019 --> 00:27:35.300\nThis has happened every day at\n4 AM since apparently 1992.\n\n581\n00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:39.520\nSo I'm not exactly sure what's\nup with their naming convention.\n\n582\n00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:43.270\nBut I'm pretty sure that\nOneDrive wasn't around in 1992.\n\n583\n00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:45.820\nSo I don't know about that.\n\n584\n00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:46.939\n&gt;&gt; I wasn't even born then.\n\n585\n00:27:46.939 --> 00:27:48.891\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Way back in my day.\n\n586\n00:27:48.891 --> 00:27:51.060\nBut you can do that.\n\n587\n00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:52.984\nI'll give you a classic example,\n\n588\n00:27:52.984 --> 00:27:55.646\na scenario that I've\nused Task Scheduler for.\n\n589\n00:27:55.646 --> 00:28:00.020\nThe Task Scheduler is,\nI used Media Center.\n\n590\n00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:06.181\nI had a media server, and it was connected\nto my TV top box, whatever, top set box.\n\n591\n00:28:06.181 --> 00:28:09.656\nAnd what it would do is,\none of the computers,\n\n592\n00:28:09.656 --> 00:28:12.980\nI had scheduled a Wake-on-LAN packet.\n\n593\n00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:16.886\nAnd it would send that Wake-on-LAN packet\nover to another computer that would turn\n\n594\n00:28:16.886 --> 00:28:17.775\nit on long enough.\n\n595\n00:28:17.775 --> 00:28:21.850\nI didn't wanna keep the computer on,\nbecause Lot of power requirements.\n\n596\n00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:24.919\nBut you turn it on right before\nthe recording would need to happen, and\n\n597\n00:28:24.919 --> 00:28:26.540\nit would record to the media server.\n\n598\n00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:28.899\nAnd then once the recording was done,\n\n599\n00:28:28.899 --> 00:28:33.210\nI had it set five minutes after to\nessentially shut the machine down.\n\n600\n00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:37.321\nI had a task scheduler on the media server\nthat would run the shut down command,\n\n601\n00:28:37.321 --> 00:28:40.138\na little script, and\nit would shut the machine down.\n\n602\n00:28:40.138 --> 00:28:45.820\nSo I had essentially tasked two different\ncomputers to communicate with each other.\n\n603\n00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:47.655\nOne to turn on,\none to turn the other one on.\n\n604\n00:28:47.655 --> 00:28:49.309\nThat's all it did.\n\n605\n00:28:49.309 --> 00:28:52.113\nAnd then the other one would\nrecord my show, shut down,\n\n606\n00:28:52.113 --> 00:28:54.090\nwith another task that was scheduled.\n\n607\n00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:57.796\nSo I could walk away from it and\nI could keep myself out of the dog\n\n608\n00:28:57.796 --> 00:29:02.217\nhouse by making sure that my wife had\nthe recording of her favorite show and\n\n609\n00:29:02.217 --> 00:29:05.090\nI could just basically be the hero.\n\n610\n00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:08.348\nSo again, if you want to be the hero\nwith your other half, right,\n\n611\n00:29:08.348 --> 00:29:11.390\nyour significant other and\nlearn how to use Task Scheduler.\n\n612\n00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:14.966\nSo I absolutely love that they have that,\nit's a great way to automate some of\n\n613\n00:29:14.966 --> 00:29:18.390\nthose day to day tasks and reduce or\nsimplify the administrative effort.\n\n614\n00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:21.704\nYou'll see things on the exam that says,\nyou need to perform this,\n\n615\n00:29:21.704 --> 00:29:25.910\nwhatever this function is, do it with\nthe least amount of administrative effort.\n\n616\n00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:28.670\nThat means as least\nclicks as you can get and\n\n617\n00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:30.890\nwhatever can help you\nautomate the process.\n\n618\n00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:34.170\nYou'll notice that when you go into IT,\nthat's what you're gonna be doing.\n\n619\n00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:37.950\nYou're gonna have a job set that's gonna\nbe this big, and you'd like to automate it\n\n620\n00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:40.840\nso the heavy lifting really can\nbe dwindled down to very little.\n\n621\n00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:43.346\nCouple of last things\nthat we have in here.\n\n622\n00:29:43.346 --> 00:29:47.115\nI only got to the Ws,\nminus Windows PowerShell ISE.\n\n623\n00:29:48.155 --> 00:29:50.645\nI gotta talk about that one even\nthough it isn't here in Windows 10.\n\n624\n00:29:50.645 --> 00:29:53.957\nWindows Defender Firewall,\nwhether demand security,\n\n625\n00:29:53.957 --> 00:29:56.515\nthis is something that's relatively new.\n\n626\n00:29:56.515 --> 00:29:59.769\nIt used to be called just\nWindows Firewall with Advanced Security,\n\n627\n00:29:59.769 --> 00:30:02.865\nhowever in Windows 10 they've\nkind of redone the interface.\n\n628\n00:30:02.865 --> 00:30:07.160\nAnd this is where they're going to what's\nknown as UTM, Unified Threat Management.\n\n629\n00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:10.976\nThey're essentially bundling all of\nthe security features within Windows into\n\n630\n00:30:10.976 --> 00:30:11.993\na single interface.\n\n631\n00:30:11.993 --> 00:30:17.420\nAnd this is where you can get very\ngranular with your firewall control.\n\n632\n00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:21.626\nWindows Memory Diagnostic,\nthis allows you to schedule memory checks.\n\n633\n00:30:21.626 --> 00:30:25.175\nSo if I was to try to run this right now,\nI can't really run this while\n\n634\n00:30:25.175 --> 00:30:27.810\nthe operating system is loaded into RAM,\nright?\n\n635\n00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:29.250\nIt's gonna check that memory.\n\n636\n00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:33.300\nSo what it needs to do is it needs to,\none of two things.\n\n637\n00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:36.382\nEither way, you're scheduling it,\nit just depends on how fast it executes.\n\n638\n00:30:36.382 --> 00:30:37.161\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n\n639\n00:30:37.161 --> 00:30:40.050\n&gt;&gt; If I schedule it for a restart,\nit's gonna shut the machine down and\n\n640\n00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:41.890\nit's gonna check your memory.\n\n641\n00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:46.110\nOr I can say just schedule it, don't\ndo it now, don't restart it right now.\n\n642\n00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:47.160\nI need to work with the computer.\n\n643\n00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:50.557\nJust go ahead, and next time I restart\nthe computer, I want you to go ahead, and\n\n644\n00:30:50.557 --> 00:30:53.806\nrather than reload the operating system\nas part of the normal boot process,\n\n645\n00:30:53.806 --> 00:30:55.860\nI want you to flag that,\nstop that right there.\n\n646\n00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:59.347\nAnd I want you to run this utility against\nthe memory, so we can see if we can\n\n647\n00:30:59.347 --> 00:31:02.460\nidentify any kinda errors right,\nit's a great utility to have.\n\n648\n00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:06.061\nNow I know Zach that we're again\nway out of time for this episode,\n\n649\n00:31:06.061 --> 00:31:09.480\nand I do know that we're at\nthe end of our list in Windows 10.\n\n650\n00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.865\nBut I would like to take\njust a few more minutes and\n\n651\n00:31:11.865 --> 00:31:14.610\nkinda round this off by going\nback to our control panel.\n\n652\n00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:16.439\nAnd I'll do this in Windows 8.1 so\n\n653\n00:31:16.439 --> 00:31:19.810\nyou guys kinda get a familiarity\nwith all the interfaces.\n\n654\n00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:22.433\nSystem and\nSecurity &gt; Administrative Tools, and\n\n655\n00:31:22.433 --> 00:31:25.730\nagain you can see that we've got\na couple of different options.\n\n656\n00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:28.880\nAnd you can also see what\nWindows Firewall used to be called.\n\n657\n00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:31.017\nSo you can see which one\nare they talking about.\n\n658\n00:31:31.017 --> 00:31:35.350\nThey might ask you a question\non the exam that requires\n\n659\n00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:39.210\nspecific verbatim answer\nwhere that matters.\n\n660\n00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:44.930\nWindows Defender Security or Windows\nDefender Firewall with Advanced Security.\n\n661\n00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:47.270\nWell, I need to know\nthat I'm on Windows 10.\n\n662\n00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:49.572\nIf it's Windows Firewall\nwith Advanced Security,\n\n663\n00:31:49.572 --> 00:31:51.305\nthen I'm not on Windows 10, right?\n\n664\n00:31:51.305 --> 00:31:53.781\nAnd you can also see\nthe PowerShell is here as well.\n\n665\n00:31:53.781 --> 00:31:58.167\nRemember PowerShell's command line\ninterface that allows you the ability to\n\n666\n00:31:58.167 --> 00:32:01.025\nwork on the lowest points\nof the operating system,\n\n667\n00:32:01.025 --> 00:32:05.345\nincluding its PowerShell is heavily\ngeared towards automating processes,\n\n668\n00:32:05.345 --> 00:32:07.553\neven much more than Task Scheduler is.\n\n669\n00:32:07.553 --> 00:32:12.299\nTask Scheduler, remember, You have\na graphical user interface, right?\n\n670\n00:32:12.299 --> 00:32:15.192\nIn the command line or\nif I launch up PowerShell,\n\n671\n00:32:15.192 --> 00:32:19.686\nall I get is this text-based entry and\ntext-based output, right?\n\n672\n00:32:19.686 --> 00:32:21.310\n&gt;&gt; So\nI really have to know what I'm doing.\n\n673\n00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:24.120\nIt's not like Task Scheduler, where\nyou do have to know what you're doing.\n\n674\n00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:25.130\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n675\n00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:28.190\nBut you have these clicks, you can kind\nof figure your way around it, right?\n\n676\n00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:30.300\nYou don't get that option in PowerShell.\n\n677\n00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:33.530\nSo, wouldn't it be nice to have some kind\nof graphical user interface that you could\n\n678\n00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:35.140\nwork with PowerShell?\n\n679\n00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:39.000\nWell, one click down, that's where the\nintegrated scripting environment comes in.\n\n680\n00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.065\nAnd that's what ISE,\nby the way, stands for.\n\n681\n00:32:41.065 --> 00:32:45.165\nI'm kind of just throwing that out there\nand not actually telling you what that is.\n\n682\n00:32:45.165 --> 00:32:49.745\nThis allows me to do things like test\nscripts, if you will, to make scripts.\n\n683\n00:32:49.745 --> 00:32:52.845\nI can show a script pane here and\nyou get the numbered lines, right?\n\n684\n00:32:52.845 --> 00:32:57.455\nSo, for instance,\nI could do get-command, maybe\n\n685\n00:32:57.455 --> 00:33:01.395\nthat's the command I wanna execute in my\nscript here, and I can even play that.\n\n686\n00:33:01.395 --> 00:33:04.220\nI can find out, okay,\nwhat does this command do?\n\n687\n00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:06.010\nI don't know as I'm testing my script.\n\n688\n00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:08.265\nWhat does that even do for me,\nand I could choose play, and\n\n689\n00:33:08.265 --> 00:33:12.295\nit'll run that command, and notice that\nit run it right there in the PowerShell.\n\n690\n00:33:12.295 --> 00:33:13.121\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n691\n00:33:13.121 --> 00:33:13.988\n&gt;&gt; From the script pane.\n\n692\n00:33:13.988 --> 00:33:18.320\nSo again, it's kinda like you get a little\nbit of the graphical user interface, you\n\n693\n00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:23.480\nget a little bit of intuitiveness because\nit does what's known as IntelliSense.\n\n694\n00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:28.113\nSo I can type get-, and\nlet me see if it'll do it here.\n\n695\n00:33:28.113 --> 00:33:30.954\nIt might, but it definitely does it and\n\n696\n00:33:30.954 --> 00:33:35.442\nit looks like my PowerShell is\nrunning a little bit slow here.\n\n697\n00:33:35.442 --> 00:33:37.721\nAnd again,\nthat's part of that resource management so\n\n698\n00:33:37.721 --> 00:33:40.495\nprobably using some CPU here,\nhaving all these machines running.\n\n699\n00:33:40.495 --> 00:33:42.766\nBut again,\nyou can see that we're executing this,\n\n700\n00:33:42.766 --> 00:33:44.790\nI probably wanna do a Ctrl+C,\nand stop that.\n\n701\n00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:46.070\nThere we go.\n\n702\n00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:51.240\nBut again, you can also use and I'd really\nlike you guys to be able to see this,\n\n703\n00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:54.360\nlet me see here,\nlet me bump up the font here.\n\n704\n00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.660\nSo you can use what's\nknown as IntelliSense.\n\n705\n00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:00.030\nNotice that it's intuitive, it gives me a\nlittle bit of a graphical user interface.\n\n706\n00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:03.735\nI don't know what the cmdlets are,\nwith a get-, well guess what,\n\n707\n00:34:03.735 --> 00:34:07.572\nif it can delineate a portion of\nthat cmdlet that you're gonna enter.\n\n708\n00:34:07.572 --> 00:34:09.290\nIt'll give you all the options\nthat are available.\n\n709\n00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:11.050\nGet-, what is the verb?\n\n710\n00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:13.910\nWell, you can see all of the verbs\nthat are associated with any cmdlet\n\n711\n00:34:13.910 --> 00:34:15.760\nthat starts with get-, right?\n\n712\n00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.193\nSo that's a good way to learn as well.\n\n713\n00:34:17.193 --> 00:34:21.363\nI use it to learn whenever I need to learn\na functionality, I can find out by testing\n\n714\n00:34:21.363 --> 00:34:24.400\nit out here inside the integrated\nscripting environment.\n\n715\n00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:28.533\nAnd I don't have to worry about the fact\nthat I don't have some kind of way to kind\n\n716\n00:34:28.533 --> 00:34:29.840\nof walk me through that.\n\n717\n00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.280\nSo these are some of the things\nthat we can look at.\n\n718\n00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:36.635\nNow, I do know that even though that takes\nus through the administrative tools,\n\n719\n00:34:36.635 --> 00:34:39.914\nwe've got a lot to go through\nwhen it comes to control panel.\n\n720\n00:34:39.914 --> 00:34:42.968\nAnd I think in the first episode, Zach was\nputting in a little bit of his psychic\n\n721\n00:34:42.968 --> 00:34:45.850\nabilities, cuz I believe we're gonna\nhave to come back for part three.\n\n722\n00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:47.210\n&gt;&gt; We are gonna have to do that.\n\n723\n00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:51.070\nConfiguring control panel in\nthe Windows OS fundamental series.\n\n724\n00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:53.790\nMake sure you watch every\nsingle one of these episodes,\n\n725\n00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:56.200\nbecause Wes is doing a fantastic\njob putting it together.\n\n726\n00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:59.274\nAnd again, there's more of\nconfiguring control panel, coming up.\n\n727\n00:34:59.274 --> 00:35:00.880\nAnd you don't wanna miss that either.\n\n728\n00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:03.695\nAnd by the way,\ntell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n729\n00:35:03.695 --> 00:35:05.660\nITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n730\n00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:06.420\nThank you for watching.\n\n731\n00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:07.270\nAnd I'm Zach Memos.\n\n732\n00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:08.110\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n733\n00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:11.467\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again, very soon.\n\n734\n00:35:11.467 --> 00:35:17.352\n[MUSIC]\n\n735\n00:35:17.352 --> 00:35:23.836\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.162\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.162 --> 00:00:12.550\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n\n5\n00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.510\nand thank you for choosing ITPro.TV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.770\nI'm your host Zach Memos for\nthis episode of Windows OS Fundamentals.\n\n7\n00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.231\nAnd we're gonna configure\nControl Panel part three.\n\n8\n00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:28.433\nNow, if you haven't seen part one and\npart two, please see that, and\n\n9\n00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:29.740\nthis is part three.\n\n10\n00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.000\nAnd the person who said he'd help us out\nagain is the one and only Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.010\nWes, good to see you.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, good to see you too, Zach.\n\n12\n00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.954\nYeah, that would be really cruel\nif I said, hey, come back and\n\n13\n00:00:38.954 --> 00:00:41.695\nsee us in a part three then I\ndidn't join you for that part.\n\n14\n00:00:41.695 --> 00:00:42.560\n&gt;&gt; It wouldn't be good.\n\n15\n00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.908\n&gt;&gt; That's right, [LAUGH] so\n\n16\n00:00:43.908 --> 00:00:45.453\nwe're gonna move through.\n\n17\n00:00:45.453 --> 00:00:50.073\nWe've been talking about Control Panel\nover the last two episodes and now, well,\n\n18\n00:00:50.073 --> 00:00:51.790\ninsert trilogy here, right?\n\n19\n00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.746\nSo now we're in the third part-\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n20\n00:00:53.746 --> 00:00:54.742\n&gt;&gt; And there are just so\n\n21\n00:00:54.742 --> 00:00:58.380\nmany different things that you\ncan do with Control Panel.\n\n22\n00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.193\nWe're really just scratching\nthe surface when it comes down to it.\n\n23\n00:01:01.193 --> 00:01:05.223\nBecause, as you know, Control Panel\nis the primary interface that we use\n\n24\n00:01:05.223 --> 00:01:07.630\nto set the computing environment, right?\n\n25\n00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.000\nTo make configurations,\nwhether it be to user accounts,\n\n26\n00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.830\nwhether it be to the computer itself.\n\n27\n00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.660\nOr maybe even it's our computer\naccount that we might be working with.\n\n28\n00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.450\nSo we left off talking about the\nadministrative tools over the past couple\n\n29\n00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.980\nof episodes.\n\n30\n00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.290\nBecause there are a handful of them\nthat we can use to administer to\n\n31\n00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.500\nthe Windows computing environment.\n\n32\n00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.195\nRemember that we've also talked about\nthe fact that for the most part,\n\n33\n00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:38.659\nControl Panel and the interface\nhasn't really changed too much.\n\n34\n00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.209\nNow, in Windows 10 we've kinda shown\nthat they're kind of supporting\n\n35\n00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:43.250\ntwo new interfaces.\n\n36\n00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.977\nWell, we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\ncontinue along that path when we show you\n\n37\n00:01:46.977 --> 00:01:50.464\nat least a few of the major Windows\noperating systems we've been dealing with.\n\n38\n00:01:50.464 --> 00:01:54.961\nWindows 7, Windows Vista, or\nnot Vista, excuse me, but Windows 8,\n\n39\n00:01:54.961 --> 00:01:56.751\n8.1, and Windows 10.\n\n40\n00:01:56.751 --> 00:02:01.130\nSo the next thing that we ought\ntalk about is accessibility, right?\n\n41\n00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.140\nOne of the things that they\ndo call out on the exam\n\n42\n00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.120\nis knowing a little bit more\nabout the accessibility\n\n43\n00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.110\noptions that we have.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n44\n00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.810\nwhen we're talking about accessibility\noptions, Wes, are we talking\n\n45\n00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.970\nabout maybe the functionality for\npeople who might have challenges?\n\n46\n00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.416\nIs that what we're talking about?\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it, and\n\n47\n00:02:20.416 --> 00:02:23.480\nI like the way you put that.\n\n48\n00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.905\nI'm challenged using my computer and\nit's just a fact that I can't type, right?\n\n49\n00:02:27.905 --> 00:02:28.741\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Me too.\n\n50\n00:02:28.741 --> 00:02:30.573\n&gt;&gt; I really have no excuse for\n\n51\n00:02:30.573 --> 00:02:35.580\nthat bad typing other than lack of,\nI guess, ability, I don't know.\n\n52\n00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.780\nBut there are some people that\nmaybe when it comes to typing,\n\n53\n00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.640\nit's not like Wes where I just\nhave inferior typing skills.\n\n54\n00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.619\nBut maybe you're truly challenged in\nthings like rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n55\n00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:51.128\nI know my aunt,\nshe has multiple sclerosis, so\n\n56\n00:02:51.128 --> 00:02:54.919\nI got a cousin that deals\nwith tremors in the hands.\n\n57\n00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:59.750\nAnd it's something that he's had inside\nhim since he was like 13 years old, right?\n\n58\n00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.320\nSo this isn't just a little too\nmuch coffee in the morning,\n\n59\n00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.020\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n60\n00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.085\n&gt;&gt; Well, wouldn't\n\n61\n00:03:04.085 --> 00:03:08.629\nit be nice to be able to control how\nthe keyboard interacts with somebody that\n\n62\n00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.822\nmaybe it is challenging to type on\nthe keys, the keys on the keyboard.\n\n63\n00:03:12.822 --> 00:03:17.880\nOr maybe it's even more than that,\nmaybe you have a visual impairment, right?\n\n64\n00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.050\nMaybe it's a little bit more difficult,\nagain, I like the way you put it,\n\n65\n00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.470\nthe challenges that we take for\ngranted, some of us.\n\n66\n00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.758\nAnd I know I'm probably one of the worst\nat this in just taking for granted that,\n\n67\n00:03:28.758 --> 00:03:30.361\nyeah, I might have glasses.\n\n68\n00:03:30.361 --> 00:03:34.535\nBut I don't have to worry about things\nlike colors not being according to my\n\n69\n00:03:34.535 --> 00:03:35.470\nbrain, right?\n\n70\n00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.280\nAnd the brain chemistry not being able\nto see those colors appropriately.\n\n71\n00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.721\nAnd that's important to understand that\nmaybe you're hearing impaired, right?\n\n72\n00:03:45.721 --> 00:03:48.983\nAnd we're not talking what my wife\nwould like to call selective hearing,\n\n73\n00:03:48.983 --> 00:03:49.951\nwe're talking-\n&gt;&gt; What?\n\n74\n00:03:49.951 --> 00:03:51.068\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly,\n\n75\n00:03:51.068 --> 00:03:55.186\nyeah, [LAUGH] so we're talking about\nsome kinda hearing impairment,\n\n76\n00:03:55.186 --> 00:03:56.340\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n77\n00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.862\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n78\n00:03:56.862 --> 00:04:02.611\nwouldn't it be nice to be able to give\npeople who face those challenges right,\n\n79\n00:04:02.611 --> 00:04:07.506\nsome of the things that we take for\ngranted as just a everyday user.\n\n80\n00:04:07.506 --> 00:04:09.600\nWell, what does it mean\nto be an everyday user?\n\n81\n00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.690\nAnd again, let's show you some of those\nthings that you can use to make it\n\n82\n00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.100\na little bit less challenging when it\ncomes to just basic functionality,\n\n83\n00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.420\nbasic operation of the operating system.\n&gt;&gt; And, Wes,\n\n84\n00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.874\nsome of this could be on the exam as well.\n&gt;&gt; It really could, it really could,\n\n85\n00:04:23.874 --> 00:04:27.550\nbecause if you think about it\nfrom an MTA perspective, right?\n\n86\n00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.210\nThis might be the first time that\nyou're actually jumping into computing.\n\n87\n00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.920\nMaybe it's the first time you're really\n\n88\n00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.860\nunderstanding what a Windows\noperating system is, right?\n\n89\n00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.950\nWell, one of the things that's\npart of help desk, if you will, or\n\n90\n00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.650\nsupporting that Windows operating\nsystem is supporting the users\n\n91\n00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.560\nthat interact with the operating system.\n\n92\n00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.900\nAnd that's why it's great to\nhave some of these features,\n\n93\n00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.680\nbecause it gives people the chance\nto experience computing and\n\n94\n00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.710\nexperience it in a way that it's\nnot problematic for them, right?\n\n95\n00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.170\nYour experience when you're\nsitting in front of the computer,\n\n96\n00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:01.120\nthe only problems you should have is\nthe fact that an application just doesn't\n\n97\n00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.660\nlike to load right.\n\n98\n00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.546\nSome of those basic complaints\nthat we talk about, but\n\n99\n00:05:05.546 --> 00:05:09.184\nit shouldn't challenge you in just\nsome of those motor skills that,\n\n100\n00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:11.641\nagain, we kinda sometimes take for\ngranted.\n\n101\n00:05:11.641 --> 00:05:12.687\nLet me show you what I mean, right?\n\n102\n00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:13.912\nRather than talk about it,\n\n103\n00:05:13.912 --> 00:05:17.180\nwe're gonna kinda show you from\na couple different operating systems.\n\n104\n00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.928\nI'm on a Windows 7 machine here.\n\n105\n00:05:18.928 --> 00:05:23.135\nAnd remember, we're going into the Control\nPanel and, by the third episode here,\n\n106\n00:05:23.135 --> 00:05:25.420\nwe've done this pretty extensively.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n107\n00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.993\n&gt;&gt; So just remember Start button, and\n\n108\n00:05:27.993 --> 00:05:32.622\nthen from the Start menu,\nthe Control Panel, and then we have,\n\n109\n00:05:32.622 --> 00:05:35.474\nagain, our category view interface.\n\n110\n00:05:35.474 --> 00:05:40.010\nRemember that you can change it to\nlarge and small icons if you want.\n\n111\n00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.160\nI'm gonna keep it with the category view\nhere because right on the right-hand side\n\n112\n00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.620\nat the bottom of the right-hand column,\nwe have what's known as Ease of Access,\n\n113\n00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.960\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n114\n00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.600\n&gt;&gt; We talked about ease of access, again,\n\n115\n00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.030\nI want you to keep in mind, again going\nback to that terminology that you used,\n\n116\n00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.930\nthe challenges that we face, right?\n\n117\n00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:03.750\nThis can ease the burden of just simple,\nthe accessibility of the operating system.\n\n118\n00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.040\nI mean, that's why they\nare called accessibility options.\n\n119\n00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.170\nBut keep in mind all of those options\nare bundled under a single location or\n\n120\n00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.890\ncategory know as the Ease\nof Access Center.\n\n121\n00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.245\nNow, let me go ahead and, Zach,\nI'm gonna just kinda divert and\n\n122\n00:06:16.245 --> 00:06:18.940\nwe're gonna go over to\nour Windows 8.1 machine.\n\n123\n00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.886\nCuz I want you all to recognize that\nthe interfaces largely haven't changed.\n\n124\n00:06:23.886 --> 00:06:27.657\nAgain, just keep in mind, couple different\nways that we could do this in Windows 8.1.\n\n125\n00:06:27.657 --> 00:06:31.011\nIf you happen to right-click\non your little Windows charm,\n\n126\n00:06:31.011 --> 00:06:33.280\nremember you have Control Panel.\n\n127\n00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.760\nWe haven't really been making a lot of use\nof the modern UI, right, the start screen.\n\n128\n00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.070\nBut again, keep in mind that from here\nif I wanted to open Control Panel,\n\n129\n00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.010\nI could just start typing.\n\n130\n00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:46.360\nI could type control, and just under\nyour search feature right there,\n\n131\n00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.706\nnotice that you have Control Panel.\n\n132\n00:06:47.706 --> 00:06:48.965\nSo couple different ways\nthat you can do that.\n\n133\n00:06:48.965 --> 00:06:52.212\nAnd again, we'll kinda use that\nthroughout the series just so\n\n134\n00:06:52.212 --> 00:06:55.283\nyou can be a little bit familiar\nwith the operating system.\n\n135\n00:06:55.283 --> 00:06:59.838\nAnd again, notice that on the right-hand\nside down at the bottom of the column\n\n136\n00:06:59.838 --> 00:07:02.610\nthere, the bottom category\nis Ease of Access.\n\n137\n00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.210\nAnd you can see,\nit really hasn't changed too much.\n\n138\n00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:05.780\n&gt;&gt; Mm-mm.\n\n139\n00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.570\n&gt;&gt; However, I will tell you that\n\n140\n00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.540\nwhen we move over to our\nWindows 10 operating system,\n\n141\n00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.780\nit definitely changes up a little bit.\n\n142\n00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.644\nSo lovely picture of a landscape there,\nlet me-\n\n143\n00:07:16.644 --> 00:07:17.650\n&gt;&gt; Beautiful.\n\n144\n00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.215\n&gt;&gt; Apparently get logged back in.\n\n145\n00:07:19.215 --> 00:07:23.000\nI talk so much,\nit logged me out, all right?\n\n146\n00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.622\nAnd I'm actually in the Ease\nof Access Center here, but\n\n147\n00:07:26.622 --> 00:07:28.483\nlet's do this a little bit.\n\n148\n00:07:28.483 --> 00:07:32.050\nLet's go the scenic route when\nit comes to getting here.\n\n149\n00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.240\nNow, my head's kinda covering this up, but\n\n150\n00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.090\nin the lower right-hand portion of your\nscreen, notice we have this little thought\n\n151\n00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.810\nbubble, excuse me, and\nit says, No new notifications.\n\n152\n00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.860\nNotifications come from your\nAction Center here, and\n\n153\n00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.008\nthis is what's known as the Action Center.\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n154\n00:07:46.008 --> 00:07:48.039\n&gt;&gt; And then all the way down here on\n\n155\n00:07:48.039 --> 00:07:51.800\nthe right-hand corner we have,\nAll Settings, right?\n\n156\n00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.511\nAnd we're gonna open this up, and if you\nclick on it, could take a second there,\n\n157\n00:07:55.511 --> 00:07:56.996\nespecially if it's updating.\n\n158\n00:07:56.996 --> 00:08:00.429\nWindows as a service as of Windows 10,\none of the things that you might notice is\n\n159\n00:08:00.429 --> 00:08:02.965\nthat it takes a little bit of time for\nthis screen to load up.\n\n160\n00:08:02.965 --> 00:08:06.357\nAnd that's because in the background\nit's actually reaching out to Microsoft,\n\n161\n00:08:06.357 --> 00:08:09.502\npulling out Pulling down in the updates\nthat are applicable to the operating\n\n162\n00:08:09.502 --> 00:08:10.355\nsystem at the time.\n\n163\n00:08:10.355 --> 00:08:13.560\nNow notice that this interface,\nagain, it's changed a little bit.\n\n164\n00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.820\nBut one of the things that it's great,\nis that they make it very and\n\n165\n00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.060\nI know this can sound redundant and\n\n166\n00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:23.240\nlike a pun and I don't really mean it this\nway but they really make it easy, right?\n\n167\n00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.780\nThe ease of access.\n\n168\n00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.310\nThey make it easy to find this, right?\n\n169\n00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:29.360\nSo not too many clicks\nthat you have to take.\n\n170\n00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.850\nAnd you can get into the ease of access\ncenter inside of the Windows 10 machine.\n\n171\n00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:38.320\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead Zack and for this\none, I'm going to save this one for last.\n\n172\n00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.100\nWe'll save the best for last because\nwhen you look at Windows 8 and\n\n173\n00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:46.700\nyou'll look at Windows 8.1 and Windows 7,\nthe ease of access center hasn't changed.\n\n174\n00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.150\nAnd not in its look, all right?\n\n175\n00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.760\nAnd yes, in Windows 10,\ndown there underneath,\n\n176\n00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.440\nthe control panel is buried and\nI can still find it there.\n\n177\n00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.800\nBut remember, two interfaces\nthat they are supporting today.\n\n178\n00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.530\nYou want to get used to the new interface.\n\n179\n00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:03.380\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's dive into the ease of access center.\n\n180\n00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.530\nAll right?\n\n181\n00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:08.238\nNow and you'll see that,\nlet me go ahead and maximize this and\n\n182\n00:09:08.238 --> 00:09:13.030\nthen I'll zoom in here to make it a little\nbit easier for you all to see out there.\n\n183\n00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:17.410\nSo we have what are known as quick\naccess to common tools, all right?\n\n184\n00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:20.100\nAnd one of the things\nI'm gonna uncheck and\n\n185\n00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:25.190\nyou can't hear it because my computer\nis actually muted right now.\n\n186\n00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:29.100\nBut I'll tell you what,\nlet's go ahead and we will see if we can.\n\n187\n00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:32.830\nThere we go.\n\n188\n00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:36.290\nAnd you can't really see it here but\nI've actually got it muted.\n\n189\n00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:39.900\nBecause what happens when you\nopen the Ease of Access Center.\n\n190\n00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.580\nThese quick access command tools,\n\n191\n00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.970\nthe narrator's actually\nrunning in the background.\n\n192\n00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:45.940\nAnd that's great, right?\n\n193\n00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:47.100\nWe see some basics and\n\n194\n00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.500\nthere's more down here that we'll go into\nbut notice that we have the magnifier.\n\n195\n00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.760\nThe magnifier is great and\nI can actually launch that.\n\n196\n00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.210\nAnd if I start the magnifier, it does\nexactly what, it sounds like, right?\n\n197\n00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:01.680\nYou'll notice that what\nthe magnifier allows us to do,\n\n198\n00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.220\nis it allows us to basically magnify the\nportions of the screen relative to where\n\n199\n00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.640\nour cursor is on the screen.\n\n200\n00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.750\nSo you can see right here,\nhere's my magnifier here.\n\n201\n00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:15.330\nAnd depending on where I have my cursor,\n\n202\n00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.520\nnotice how it is kind of\nmagnifying the screen here.\n\n203\n00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:23.660\nAnd in fact, let me go ahead and\nI'm kind of zoomed out, right?\n\n204\n00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.790\nThere's no accessibility\noption that is on right here.\n\n205\n00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.828\nThis is our magnifier, right?\n\n206\n00:10:28.828 --> 00:10:32.550\nAnd we could actually zoom out\nif we wanted to, we can zoom in.\n\n207\n00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:36.690\nAnd again, like I said, it's just all\nrelative to where you have your mouse.\n\n208\n00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:41.350\nIf you wanted to zoom in a whole bunch,\nyou can, right?\n\n209\n00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:44.430\nAnd you can see that again, it gets\na little pixellated here when it comes to\n\n210\n00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:47.390\nthe fonts and\nstuff like that but that's okay.\n\n211\n00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:49.560\nBecause we're not going for\nhigh definition video\n\n212\n00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.090\nhere when we're talking about-\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n213\n00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:51.910\n&gt;&gt; An accessibility\n\n214\n00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:52.430\nfeature.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n215\n00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.140\n&gt;&gt; Because of the fact that this is about\n\n216\n00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:58.000\npeople who can't really see\ntheir screens well, right?\n\n217\n00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.870\nNow, you can also basically\njust clear that out.\n\n218\n00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:05.340\nNow, there might be times where,\nI've actually used this myself for\n\n219\n00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.030\nother reasons.\n\n220\n00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:10.550\nBut they also have an on screen keyboard\nthat you can utilize as well, all right?\n\n221\n00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:11.650\nAnd that's great if.\n\n222\n00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:15.440\nI've actually used this before too Zach,\nwhen the keyboard for\n\n223\n00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.320\nwhatever reason, the driver to\nthe keyboard wasn't being seen right.\n\n224\n00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.770\nOr I'd have a USB keyboard that was dying.\n\n225\n00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:24.240\nWhatever the keyboard,\nthere was a problem with it.\n\n226\n00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.390\nI actually launched this up just to\nkeep working with the operating system.\n\n227\n00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:28.960\nSo it's nice to have a keyboard if\n\n228\n00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.730\nthat keyboard becomes a product.\n&gt;&gt; It has.\n\n229\n00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:32.070\n&gt;&gt; Right but you do have the on screen\n\n230\n00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:33.560\nkeyboard that you can use as well and\n\n231\n00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.260\nthere are a couple of\ndifferent options here too.\n\n232\n00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:39.930\nYou can see start narrator,\nnarrator will do dictation to you.\n\n233\n00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:44.460\nAnd it will read the areas that\nare important on your screen.\n\n234\n00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.840\nSo basically kind of telling you, so if\nyou do have vision problems, right, maybe\n\n235\n00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:52.800\nthe magnifier you can utilize as well but\nyou also want to know what's going on\n\n236\n00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.350\nin this portion of the screen, well, isn't\nit nice to have some kind of audible.\n\n237\n00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:02.510\nNot just visual because if visual\nis the challenge that you face.\n\n238\n00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:05.020\nWell then, you can have a narration go on.\n\n239\n00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:10.520\nYou can hear something audibly, which\nis really nice to have too, all right?\n\n240\n00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:16.405\nColors, if again, colors are something\nyou don't see appropriately.\n\n241\n00:12:16.405 --> 00:12:20.295\nIt could be anything from what is it,\n\n242\n00:12:20.295 --> 00:12:23.205\ndeuteranopia is I think how\nthey call it right there.\n\n243\n00:12:23.205 --> 00:12:27.340\nSo they have another one protanopia and\ntrit,\n\n244\n00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:31.020\nI'm gonna try this one,\ntritanopia, all right?\n\n245\n00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:34.660\nAnd these are just the various,\ndo you see reds and greens?\n\n246\n00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:39.290\nOver do you see blues and greens, right?\n&gt;&gt; Well because there's different kinds of\n\n247\n00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:40.480\ncolor blindness.\n&gt;&gt; That's\n\n248\n00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.510\nexactly it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n249\n00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:43.053\n&gt;&gt; And we're gonna actually see that.\n\n250\n00:12:43.053 --> 00:12:44.168\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n251\n00:12:44.168 --> 00:12:46.534\n&gt;&gt; They addressed it inside of windows 10\n\n252\n00:12:46.534 --> 00:12:50.590\nand specifically addressed the type\nof color-blindness you have.\n\n253\n00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:55.000\nSo we're going to see some advancements\nin the ease of access that are coming up\n\n254\n00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.030\nhere too.\n\n255\n00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:59.050\nBut notice, oops,\nnotice how it makes you sea-sick.\n\n256\n00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:03.980\nTim, notice the Use the computer without\na display and again, that's one of\n\n257\n00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:08.880\nthose things where we think, well, wait\na second, my display is how I interact.\n\n258\n00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.030\nRight, so it's the reason we\nhave a graphical user interface.\n\n259\n00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:13.660\nWell, if you can't see the display,\n\n260\n00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.700\nif you're blind, the display\ndoesn't really do you any good.\n\n261\n00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.915\nRight, so again remember that these what\nwe're talking about for the context of\n\n262\n00:13:19.915 --> 00:13:25.050\nchallenges that maybe you're not familiar\nwith and I'm blessed to not have\n\n263\n00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:29.280\nto be familiar with that but you need to\nremember that this is personal computing.\n\n264\n00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.320\nIt's not a one size fits all and\nwe have to make sure that all people\n\n265\n00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.890\ncan be able to use, irregardless of\nwhat challenges they might face.\n\n266\n00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:37.590\n&gt;&gt; And if you were visually impaired,\n\n267\n00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:41.330\nyou did have visual challenges, then the\nnarrator would be really important I would\n\n268\n00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:42.510\nthink?\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it, so\n\n269\n00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:43.740\nyou got more than one thing.\n\n270\n00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:47.030\nAnd that's a good point too,\njust when you say it like that Zach,\n\n271\n00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:48.040\nthat you got more than one thing.\n\n272\n00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.380\nYou don't have to just use one or\nthe other, you can actually stack them\n\n273\n00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.907\ntogether and they can help assist and\ngive you that greater experience, right?\n\n274\n00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:57.960\nMake the computer easier to see, right?\n\n275\n00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.573\nAnd when you choose these hyperlinks,\nright,\n\n276\n00:14:00.573 --> 00:14:04.880\nwhat it does is it will actually take you\nto the subset of the features, right,\n\n277\n00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:08.140\nwhere you can get a little\nbit more granular.\n\n278\n00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:11.770\nNotice for instance, we can choose\nthe high contrast theme, right?\n\n279\n00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:14.140\nHearing text and descriptions, right?\n\n280\n00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:14.720\nRead allow.\n\n281\n00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.520\nThe narrator is great.\n\n282\n00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:21.080\nEspecially when you can increase\nthe size of your pointer.\n\n283\n00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.530\nAnd I'll show you that even though\nit's not under accessibility options.\n\n284\n00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.230\nWe'll show you some of\nthe things that you can do too.\n\n285\n00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:31.640\nSo again, scaling sizes, you'll see\nchange the size of text and icons.\n\n286\n00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:36.306\nAnd if I click this, this goes right\nover into our display where we can\n\n287\n00:14:36.306 --> 00:14:38.101\nchange the scaling.\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n288\n00:14:38.101 --> 00:14:38.606\n&gt;&gt; In fact,\n\n289\n00:14:38.606 --> 00:14:40.690\nwe've had to do this from time to time,\n\n290\n00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:44.165\nespecially here at ITProTV when\nwere trying to show something and\n\n291\n00:14:44.165 --> 00:14:48.144\nwe dont want you to have to give yourself\na headache to try to see something,\n\n292\n00:14:48.144 --> 00:14:51.700\nwe might change the scale because\nwe know that it looks good to you.\n\n293\n00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:55.470\nWell, imagine you're not\non a 50 something inch tv.\n\n294\n00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:57.895\nImagine your on a little 13 inch laptop.\n\n295\n00:14:57.895 --> 00:15:02.713\nWell, wouldnt it be nice for that person\nwho has to sit in front of that thirteen\n\n296\n00:15:02.713 --> 00:15:06.582\ninch laptop to reduce the migraines\nthat they might be having or\n\n297\n00:15:06.582 --> 00:15:10.020\nmitigate those risks being\nable to see a little better.\n\n298\n00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:14.230\nSo you'll notice that, throughout\nthe Ease of Access Center, right,\n\n299\n00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:18.856\nwe have a lot of these little hyperlinks\nthat take us to different locations, so\n\n300\n00:15:18.856 --> 00:15:21.290\nmake things on this screen easier to see.\n\n301\n00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:26.030\nYou can see under a high-contrast\ntheme is another thing too if colors\n\n302\n00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:27.470\npresent a problem.\n\n303\n00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:31.140\nSo if I choose the back option here,\nnotice that I'm just kind of going in and\n\n304\n00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:32.690\nout of these hyperlinks, right?\n\n305\n00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:34.630\nSo for instance making\nthe computer easier to see.\n\n306\n00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:37.190\nUse the computer without a mouse or\na keyboard, right?\n\n307\n00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:41.280\nYou can set up things like\nalternate pointing devices, right?\n\n308\n00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.290\nAvoid using the mouse or the keyboard.\n\n309\n00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:50.245\nI do know that one of the persons\nthat I was actually a teacher of,\n\n310\n00:15:50.245 --> 00:15:54.764\nhe was a student of mine and\nhe had, I want to say,\n\n311\n00:15:54.764 --> 00:16:00.745\nit wasn't quadriplegic but\nbasically used his mouth, right?\n\n312\n00:16:00.745 --> 00:16:03.863\nHe couldn't use his hands but\nhe, brilliant guy and man,\n\n313\n00:16:03.863 --> 00:16:08.317\nwhen you talk about getting into computers\nand looking at something and figuring it\n\n314\n00:16:08.317 --> 00:16:12.347\nout He can do really well, but he wasn't\nusing the mouse and the keyboard.\n\n315\n00:16:12.347 --> 00:16:14.310\nHe was using dictation.\n\n316\n00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:17.260\nAnd this is expensive software.\n\n317\n00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.730\nNow I'm not trying to sell you anything or\na feature, but\n\n318\n00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:22.520\nI know that things like Dragon Speak-\n&gt;&gt; Dragon, I was gonna mention Dragon.\n\n319\n00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.180\n&gt;&gt; Right, Dragon Speak is out there,\n\n320\n00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.370\nDragon Dictation,\nI think is another one out there.\n\n321\n00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:28.260\nI think it's all by the same company and\n\n322\n00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.530\nit could be a couple hundred dollars,\nright?\n\n323\n00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:33.730\nWell imagine having that functionality\nalready built into your operating system.\n\n324\n00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:35.060\nAnd that's why I think these options,\n\n325\n00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.940\nyou have options before having\nto go to a third party.\n\n326\n00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:43.250\nAnd that is something that I really\ncommend a lot of the different operating\n\n327\n00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:46.980\nsystems, Windows and there's other ones\nout there, too, for putting these in here.\n\n328\n00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:49.360\nSo we don't have to go to\na third party and buy these.\n\n329\n00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.860\nAnd that's why I like\nto take some time and\n\n330\n00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.170\nkinda show you about these\naccessibility options.\n\n331\n00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:57.450\nBecause even if you're not\nhere from an exam standpoint,\n\n332\n00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:01.420\nyou might be supporting a family member or\na friend that could really benefit by\n\n333\n00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:04.870\nhaving these options configured for them.\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n334\n00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:07.420\n&gt;&gt; So making the mouse easier to use.\n\n335\n00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.040\nSo go ahead and choose this and\n\n336\n00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:14.410\nnotice that you can change\nyour cursor size, right?\n\n337\n00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:19.360\nLarge white, large black,\nshades of gray if you need to, right?\n\n338\n00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:23.250\nDepending on what your eyes need, right?\n\n339\n00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:26.320\nActivate the window by hovering\nover it with the mouse, right?\n\n340\n00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.320\nPrevent windows from automatically\nbeing arranged when moved\n\n341\n00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:30.510\nto the edges of the screen.\n\n342\n00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:32.010\nNow what does that mean?\n\n343\n00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:35.210\nWhat they're talking about\nthere is that Windows 7,\n\n344\n00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:37.960\nsince Windows 7 has what's\nknown as the snap feature.\n\n345\n00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:41.210\nNotice how I dragged that window\nthere to the right or to the left.\n\n346\n00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:43.255\nI swear I know my right from my left.\n\n347\n00:17:43.255 --> 00:17:45.010\n[LAUGH] Drag it to the right and it snaps.\n\n348\n00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:46.220\nIt's called the snap feature.\n\n349\n00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.840\nAnd it might be something\nthat maybe a person.\n\n350\n00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.936\nReally didn't mean to do that.\n\n351\n00:17:50.936 --> 00:17:55.920\nThey didn't wanna use that\nsnap feature and unfortunately\n\n352\n00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:00.250\nas you can see it kinda put you running\nand trying to catch your mouse.\n\n353\n00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:04.810\nTrying to catch not the mouse but\ntrying to catch the window.\n\n354\n00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:06.680\nRight.\nSo we can prevent those windows from\n\n355\n00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.210\nbeing automatically arranged.\n\n356\n00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:09.500\nRight.\nSo again,\n\n357\n00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.160\nsome of the things that we can do here,\nright?\n\n358\n00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.110\nAnd again,\n\n359\n00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:16.230\nyou can see all of these different\nthings that are available, right?\n\n360\n00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:17.850\nI did this in Windows 7.\n\n361\n00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:20.010\nAgain, if we kinda jump over to Windows 8,\n\n362\n00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:23.660\nI do want you to understand that when\nwe get into the ease of access center,\n\n363\n00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:28.910\nit really hasn't changed when it\ncomes to control panel, right?\n\n364\n00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:29.900\nYou'll see the basics.\n\n365\n00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.240\nEverything looks the same.\n\n366\n00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:33.890\nNow, we saved the best for last.\n\n367\n00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:36.250\nLet's go over here to Windows 10 and\n\n368\n00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:40.230\nyou'll see that there are,\nit looks different right?\n\n369\n00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:41.500\nHere's your narrator.\n\n370\n00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:42.900\nTurn it on or off right.\n\n371\n00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.420\nYou can even choose\nthe voice that you have and\n\n372\n00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:48.562\nI've got some voice I'll choose.\n&gt;&gt; You can make it sound like Richard\n\n373\n00:18:48.562 --> 00:18:50.780\n[INAUDIBLE].\n&gt;&gt; Hey, if you need to, that's right.\n\n374\n00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:51.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n375\n00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:52.640\n&gt;&gt; That's absolutely right.\n\n376\n00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.250\n&gt;&gt; And now [INAUDIBLE].\n\n377\n00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:57.600\nNow, notice that we also\ncan change the speed.\n\n378\n00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.810\nWe can change the pitch, too.\n\n379\n00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:04.460\nSo if we want Zach listening to the\nChipmunks, we can do that likewise too.\n\n380\n00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:08.110\nBut again, sounds you hear,\nread hints, controls, right, so\n\n381\n00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:12.380\nyou can see we're able to\ndo a lot of the same stuff.\n\n382\n00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:16.730\nThat we were able to do\ninside of the older Control,\n\n383\n00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:19.440\nor, yeah, Control Panels,\nEase of Access Centers.\n\n384\n00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:23.660\nBut you get the idea that we can\nmanipulate things, cursors and\n\n385\n00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:24.620\nkeys, right?\n\n386\n00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:29.800\nYou also, they talk about installing\nthird party software for braille, right?\n\n387\n00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:34.010\nAgain so you're gonna see that\nthey've kind of advanced it more.\n\n388\n00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:37.170\nSo Magnifier,\nall of this is pretty much the same.\n\n389\n00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.120\nAgain remember that the options,\nthe bells and\n\n390\n00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.540\nwhistles, are just tweaked a little bit.\n\n391\n00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.610\nDifferent check boxes.\n\n392\n00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:46.510\nPretty much not too much\ndifferent in what you can do.\n\n393\n00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:49.390\nHowever, I will tell you,\none of the things that's great is\n\n394\n00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:53.840\nthey give you down here at the bottom,\nthis is something I like, they let\n\n395\n00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.630\nyou know what the keyboard shortcuts\nare for zooming in, zooming out, right?\n\n396\n00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:01.411\nWindows key + Plus turns\nthe magnifier on or off.\n\n397\n00:20:01.411 --> 00:20:05.070\nNow, remember when I told\nyou about high contrast?\n\n398\n00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:08.400\nWell, there are some\nthings that you can do.\n\n399\n00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:13.200\nNotice that I told you that there\nare options here that you can\n\n400\n00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:13.930\nsee.\n&gt;&gt; So Wes,\n\n401\n00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:16.930\ncan we see what that actually looks like?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's one of those things, Zach,\n\n402\n00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:21.120\nwhere you kinda gotta pick up\nthe colors to know what's going on.\n\n403\n00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.590\nSo let's go ahead,\nwe'll open up our Edge browser here.\n\n404\n00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:29.180\nAnd all I'm gonna do is just type in,\ncolor red, right?\n\n405\n00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.270\nAnd just do a quick image search.\n\n406\n00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:33.980\nAnd this kind of gives you the contrast or\n\n407\n00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:36.490\nwhat's gonna happen when we change this,\nright?\n\n408\n00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:39.105\nSo notice that we've got red here but\n\n409\n00:20:39.105 --> 00:20:43.845\nnotice what happens when I change it\nbecause if I change these settings,\n\n410\n00:20:43.845 --> 00:20:47.565\nwell, it doesn't really\nlook like it's done much.\n\n411\n00:20:47.565 --> 00:20:52.495\nSo let me go ahead and let's see if\nwe can use our snap feature here.\n\n412\n00:20:54.865 --> 00:20:55.975\nThere we go.\n\n413\n00:20:57.715 --> 00:21:02.710\nAnd let's just kinda sift\nthrough a couple of these here.\n\n414\n00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:06.930\nLet me make sure that I'm not missing\nan apply button here, there we go.\n\n415\n00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.460\nAll right, so\nwe'll apply our color filter now, and\n\n416\n00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:13.980\nnotice how when we switch to the different\nones, notice how it changes, right?\n\n417\n00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:14.770\n&gt;&gt; Goodness gracious.\n\n418\n00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:16.650\n&gt;&gt; So you can see that what it's doing is\n\n419\n00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:21.130\nit's compensating for whichever\ndirection the color blindness is, right?\n\n420\n00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:25.000\nThe deuteranopia, the red-green,\ngreen [INAUDIBLE] pro Tritanopia.\n\n421\n00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.420\nI also read greens and\nhow you proceed with those.\n\n422\n00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.120\n&gt;&gt; And I actually I am light green color.\n\n423\n00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:29.690\n&gt;&gt; Really, okay.\n\n424\n00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:34.000\nAnd then the tritanopia and again I'm not\nsure if, [LAUGH] I'm saying these right,\n\n425\n00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.440\nI'm probably murdering these words.\n\n426\n00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.430\nDoing good.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n427\n00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:39.260\nagain, it's different levels\nof color blindness, right?\n\n428\n00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:42.960\nAnd if I go to the last one there,\nthe Tritanopia.\n\n429\n00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.090\nNotice where it really\ndoesn't change it much.\n\n430\n00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:47.320\nAnd again, that's more the focus\nis on the blues and yellows.\n\n431\n00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:50.630\nBut it does show you how you can\nmake some manipulations to that.\n\n432\n00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:53.900\nSo that's a little bit about your\naccessibility options, right?\n\n433\n00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:56.720\nAnd we do have a lot of those options.\n\n434\n00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.590\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nclose these tabs.\n\n435\n00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:02.680\nNow, we do have some other things that\nwe need to kind of talk about as well,\n\n436\n00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.820\nright?\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n437\n00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.190\nit does look like we don't\nhave enough in this episode.\n\n438\n00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:08.640\nSo we might have to come\nback with a part four,\n\n439\n00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:12.710\nbecause there are plenty of things inside\nof Control Panel that we need to know and\n\n440\n00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:16.220\nyou should know for that exam.\n&gt;&gt; Windows OS fundamentals, great series,\n\n441\n00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:19.260\nmake sure you watch every single one\nof the episodes, it's fantastic.\n\n442\n00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:23.040\nAnd of course, watch all\nthe configuring Control Panel episodes.\n\n443\n00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.290\nWe've got one, two, three and\nnow we're going to part four.\n\n444\n00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:29.970\nBecause, like Wes was saying earlier,\nwe're just scratching the surface,\n\n445\n00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:33.900\nthere's so much to look at and so much to\ntalk about and Wes is doing a great job.\n\n446\n00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:35.430\nAnd while you're in that course library,\n\n447\n00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:40.380\nthere's thousands of other videos\nthat can help you go further.\n\n448\n00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:42.030\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n449\n00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:44.540\nYou know ITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n450\n00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:47.110\nThanks for watching, I'm Zack Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n451\n00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:48.310\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you soon.\n\n452\n00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:55.489\n[MUSIC]\n\n453\n00:22:55.489 --> 00:22:58.445\nThank you for watching ITPro TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.307\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.307 --> 00:00:12.882\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello again, and\n\n5\n00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:17.200\nthank you for choosing ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.170\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, as we continue\non with Windows OS Fundamentals.\n\n7\n00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.980\nThis is\nConfiguring Control Panel Part Four.\n\n8\n00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.400\nThat's right, make sure you see parts\none through three and this is four.\n\n9\n00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.260\nWes Bryant is here to help us out again.\n\n10\n00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.300\nWes, good to see you.\n&gt;&gt; Hey good to be back here Zach.\n\n11\n00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.087\nThat's right,\n\n12\n00:00:35.087 --> 00:00:38.470\nwe've got just a few more of the concepts\nthat we wanna kinda round off.\n\n13\n00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.580\nAnd we certainly didn't wanna make the\nlast episode about a 50 minute episode.\n\n14\n00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.960\nSo we went ahead and decided.\n\n15\n00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.920\nI went ahead and I pulled the trigger\non it and I said, let's go ahead and\n\n16\n00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:48.530\nmake a fourth one.\n\n17\n00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.590\nAnd we'll come back here and\n\n18\n00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.170\nwe will talk about some of the things\nthat we have left to discuss.\n\n19\n00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.780\nSo here in this episode we're\ngoing to talk a little bit about\n\n20\n00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.690\npower settings as well as file explorer.\n\n21\n00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.940\nAnd some of the things that you can do to\nmanipulate file explorer when it comes to\n\n22\n00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.190\nseeing different folders and\nfiles within your operating system.\n\n23\n00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.980\nSo those are some of the things we're\ngonna look at right here in this\n\n24\n00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:09.500\nepisode.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n25\n00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.310\nnow Wes we're talking\nabout power settings.\n\n26\n00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.980\nAnd we're talking about making\nsure that my laptop doesn't\n\n27\n00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.200\ndie in the middle of a presentation\nwhen I'm unplugged from the wall?\n\n28\n00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.380\n&gt;&gt; Yes that's exactly what it's about and\n\n29\n00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.360\nit's also about setting some expectations.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n30\n00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.470\n&gt;&gt; Right so if your computer like you said\n\n31\n00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.805\ndoes go into a maybe a low power state,\nare you ready for it?\n\n32\n00:01:28.805 --> 00:01:32.460\nBecause well, Zach mentioned, you\nmentioned presentation settings, right?\n\n33\n00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.140\nIf I'm in an auditorium and I'm in\nthe middle of giving a presentation,\n\n34\n00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.600\nchances are I wanna be aware of\nwhat my computer is going to do.\n\n35\n00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.523\nWhen it starts to just\nquickly consume all of that\n\n36\n00:01:43.523 --> 00:01:44.303\npower.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n37\n00:01:44.303 --> 00:01:46.720\n&gt;&gt; So that's what we're gonna look at here\n\n38\n00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.680\nto start with.\n\n39\n00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.930\nNow, let's go ahead and\n\n40\n00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.860\nshow you the traditional way that\nwe can get into our power settings.\n\n41\n00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.130\nI'm gonna go ahead, and we've been\nworking in and out of Windows 7,\n\n42\n00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.550\nWindows 8.1, and Windows 10.\n\n43\n00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.391\nAnd I'll go ahead and\nstart with a Windows 8.1 machine and\n\n44\n00:02:01.391 --> 00:02:05.345\nall I'm gonna do is right-click on our\ndesktop, or little Windows charm here, and\n\n45\n00:02:05.345 --> 00:02:07.090\nwe're gonna choose Control Panel.\n\n46\n00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.430\nAnd when Control Panel opens up,\nwe're gonna go to System and Security.\n\n47\n00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.640\nAll right now if you are in the category\nview you go to system and security.\n\n48\n00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.050\nRemember that if you are in large icons,\npower options will just be in the list.\n\n49\n00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.180\nBut if you are in the category view about\nhalf way down you will see power options.\n\n50\n00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.280\nAnd we do have some quick task links\nthat we can use these hyperlinks here.\n\n51\n00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.780\nBut let's go ahead and let's bring\nup the power options interface.\n\n52\n00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.110\nAnd again this is another\none of those ones that for\n\n53\n00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.020\nthe most part hasn't changed too much.\n\n54\n00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.325\nAnd if you've been\nfollowing along with us,\n\n55\n00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:42.610\nyou know that I'm gonna say except\nuntil we get to Windows 10.\n\n56\n00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.530\nAnd even that for the most part you're\ngonna see this is where In Windows\n\n57\n00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.340\n10 they really are trying to\nstill maintain two interfaces.\n\n58\n00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.650\nBut, let's focus on the primary interface\nthat we have to work with here.\n\n59\n00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.960\nNotice that just like all the other things\nthat we've been doing in control panel.\n\n60\n00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.350\nWe do have a series of task\nlinks that we can utilize.\n\n61\n00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.260\nThen we also have underneath here,\nwe have what are known as power plans.\n\n62\n00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.220\nAll right, well what are the power plans?\n\n63\n00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.050\nThere's actually three of the power\nplans that we have by default to use.\n\n64\n00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.260\nWell, the first power plan that we\nhave is what's known as balanced.\n\n65\n00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.580\nThe second one is known as power saver and\nthe third one is kinda hidden here.\n\n66\n00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.530\nAnd if we choose this little down arrow,\n\n67\n00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.680\nyou'll see that we have the high\nperformance power plan here, likewise.\n\n68\n00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.460\nWell, let's kind of talk about what\nthese do for us, what is a power plan?\n\n69\n00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:40.040\nWell, a power plan is\nbasically a grouping of\n\n70\n00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.060\npower configuration settings, all right?\n\n71\n00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.390\nAnd rather than have to go in and peak and\ntweak all the little individual things.\n\n72\n00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.900\nWe can pick this grouping,\n\n73\n00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.170\nthis collection of settings based on\nwhat kind of functionality we need.\n\n74\n00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.980\nAnd when I say functionality,\nwhat do I mean here?\n\n75\n00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.939\nWell, you'll notice that again if we\ndo that a little bit of that hover to\n\n76\n00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.160\ndiscover, you get the little\nthought bubble there.\n\n77\n00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.250\nOr you'll get just same text right\nunderneath the power plan that you\n\n78\n00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.170\nare currently using.\n\n79\n00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.400\nWell, notice what this power plan says.\n\n80\n00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.250\nAnd I just don't like\nreading from power points and\n\n81\n00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.000\nreading from these text\nyou can read these.\n\n82\n00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.740\nBut let me see if I can help\nyou out with this right.\n\n83\n00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.900\nNotice it says automatically balances\nperformance with energy consumption on\n\n84\n00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.180\ncapable hardware.\n\n85\n00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.400\nNotice that if we just jump one down,\nsaves energy in the power saving plan.\n\n86\n00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.800\nSaves energy by reducing your\ncomputer's performance where possible.\n\n87\n00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.110\nAll right, so\nwhat is the difference between these?\n\n88\n00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.390\nWhat does that mean for us?\n\n89\n00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.680\nAll right well I want you to\nthink you've got two things\n\n90\n00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.510\nwhen it comes to power plans that\nyou really have to consider.\n\n91\n00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.130\nHow much performance do I need?\n\n92\n00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.390\nVersus how much power saving do I need,\nall right?\n\n93\n00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.050\nWell, if we talk balanced, it's exactly\nwhy it's called balanced, right?\n\n94\n00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.110\nScales are even, right?\n\n95\n00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.750\nPower saver now says a power saving\nversus performances is more important.\n\n96\n00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.863\nWell, we're going to\nincrease the popularity or\n\n97\n00:05:03.863 --> 00:05:07.951\nthe focus of your power saving,\nnotice how the scales are going.\n\n98\n00:05:07.951 --> 00:05:10.560\nIt means the performance\nis gonna drop a little bit.\n\n99\n00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.780\n&gt;&gt; So in that power saver,\n\n100\n00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.320\nam I gonna lose any functionality?\n&gt;&gt; And that's another great point.\n\n101\n00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.110\nAnd that's a good question too Zach.\n\n102\n00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.420\nYes you will.\n\n103\n00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.250\nSo the reason they call\nit balanced all right?\n\n104\n00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.350\nWe'll start there because\nthat's the default usually.\n\n105\n00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:24.490\nBalance says you know what?\n\n106\n00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.277\nSave power where you can\nanywhere you can save power.\n\n107\n00:05:28.277 --> 00:05:32.320\nBased on the settings that we have\nconfigured, where you can save power.\n\n108\n00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.110\nBut the moment I need the performance, and\nthis will help you with that question,\n\n109\n00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.266\ncome back to that question Zach.\n\n110\n00:05:36.266 --> 00:05:38.160\nThe moment I need that performance?\n\n111\n00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.732\nGive me the performance that I need,\nwhich means we're gonna balance it, right?\n\n112\n00:05:41.732 --> 00:05:44.441\nWe're gonna try to save you power\nwhere we can, but at the same time,\n\n113\n00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:45.668\nif you need that performance.\n\n114\n00:05:45.668 --> 00:05:48.575\nWe're gonna take that voltage and\nwe're gonna apply it to the CPU so\n\n115\n00:05:48.575 --> 00:05:49.960\nyou get that processing power.\n\n116\n00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.830\nPower saver,\n\n117\n00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.460\nnow here's where the other side of\nthe tracks comes into that question.\n\n118\n00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.251\nI hate giving Zach those yes and\nno answers, okay?\n\n119\n00:05:59.251 --> 00:05:59.988\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n120\n00:05:59.988 --> 00:06:02.035\n&gt;&gt; So does it reduce performance?\n\n121\n00:06:02.035 --> 00:06:04.247\nWell power saver does, yes it does.\n\n122\n00:06:04.247 --> 00:06:08.180\nBecause what this says is,\nbalance of scales are equal, right?\n\n123\n00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.730\nNow what you're saying is power\nis the most important thing.\n\n124\n00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.680\nSo you can take performance,\nthrow it off the scale.\n\n125\n00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.060\nBecause what it says is when you need\nthe performance, you aren't gonna get it.\n\n126\n00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.360\nThat means once you go to a power\nsaving plan and it kicks in.\n\n127\n00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.070\nYou should expect reduced\nfunctionality within the platform.\n\n128\n00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.710\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n129\n00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.050\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully that comes back and\n\n130\n00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.640\nthat helps that answer.\n\n131\n00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.990\nNow, high performance is the polar\nopposite of power saving.\n\n132\n00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.090\nPower saving says, we're gonna try\nto save you power where we can.\n\n133\n00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.560\nHigh performance says, you know what?\n\n134\n00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.215\nIf you have to dim the lights out three\nblocks over because we're gonna just throw\n\n135\n00:06:46.215 --> 00:06:47.987\nall the power at the machine we can.\n\n136\n00:06:47.987 --> 00:06:49.520\nThat's what we're doing, all right?\n\n137\n00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.640\nYou gotta be careful cuz\nthe high performance\n\n138\n00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.190\nis going to give you just that.\n\n139\n00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.499\nNow just when we think we understand\nwhat these power plans do.\n\n140\n00:06:59.499 --> 00:07:02.780\nSometimes you wanna get a little\nbit more granular, all right?\n\n141\n00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:08.240\nMaybe the group of the settings\nisn't exactly what you want.\n\n142\n00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.480\nBut you wanna tweak them a little bit,\nall right?\n\n143\n00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.670\nWell notice this little hyper links here,\nright here, Change plan settings.\n\n144\n00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:18.040\nEven though they have a default\nconfiguration, if I was to choose this\n\n145\n00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:23.300\nhyperlink, all right, it gives me\nthe ability to get a little bit granular.\n\n146\n00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.220\nAnd if this is the first time we ever see\nthis interface, what's funny is you say.\n\n147\n00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:31.860\nYou gave me s much granularity there\nthat I can vonfigure two things.\n\n148\n00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.950\nNo, trust me when I say, yes that's right.\n\n149\n00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:36.280\nWhen do I turn the display off?\n\n150\n00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.140\nWhen do we put the computer to sleep?\n\n151\n00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.120\nBut notice this change in\nadvanced power settings.\n\n152\n00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.940\nNow when I choose this,\na little dialog box is gonna come up.\n\n153\n00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:48.923\nAnd that little dialog box is gonna\ngive me the ability to see what\n\n154\n00:07:48.923 --> 00:07:54.013\nare the pieces of hardware that\nour operating system is aware of?\n\n155\n00:07:54.013 --> 00:07:59.354\nAnd rather than just go with the default,\nsay hey Balanced power plan.\n\n156\n00:07:59.354 --> 00:08:00.956\nYou've configured all of these for me.\n\n157\n00:08:00.956 --> 00:08:05.680\nI might say, well you know what,\nI wanna change what the power button does.\n\n158\n00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:10.160\nRight now, when I push the power button,\nit shuts the machine down.\n\n159\n00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.010\nWell, maybe I don't want it to do that.\n\n160\n00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:13.160\nMaybe I want it to go to sleep.\n\n161\n00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:18.560\nYou notice how I can make these\nlittle individual tweaks.\n\n162\n00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.830\nNow notice that it says active.\n\n163\n00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:20.950\nWhat is that about?\n\n164\n00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:26.230\nWell active means this is the power plan\nthat is actively applied to the machine.\n\n165\n00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:29.150\nWhich is great because even\nthough the high performance and\n\n166\n00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:33.890\nthe power saver, they aren't\ncurrently applied to the machine.\n\n167\n00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:37.770\nI could still come in here, and I can\nmake some changes to the ones that aren't\n\n168\n00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:39.298\ncurrently active.\n&gt;&gt; That's fantastic.\n\n169\n00:08:39.298 --> 00:08:41.130\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, what if you go so\n\n170\n00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:44.400\nfar that you are tweaking\nway too many of these?\n\n171\n00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.820\nMaybe you want a blank slate.\n\n172\n00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.730\nAll right, well, it's kinda hard\nto get the blank slate, but\n\n173\n00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.090\nwhat you can do is you\ncan copy a power plan.\n\n174\n00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:52.920\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n175\n00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:57.850\nAfter you figure it out,\nmaybe you know I want to go ahead, and\n\n176\n00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.610\nI wanna customize my own power plan,\nnot just tweak a few.\n\n177\n00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:05.160\nAll right, well,\nnotice the links that we have over here,\n\n178\n00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.800\nchange what I do with the power button.\n\n179\n00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.370\nThat's one I kinda know cuz I like\nto manipulate that one a lot.\n\n180\n00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:12.460\nBut notice this Create a power plan.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n181\n00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:15.960\n&gt;&gt; When I do this, this is gonna give me\n\n182\n00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.120\nthe same exact interface almost\nthat we had before, all right?\n\n183\n00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.850\nBut I might say, you know what?\n\n184\n00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.950\nI wanna change the way\nthe power button works, right?\n\n185\n00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:28.060\nSo I say, this is my, I don't know,\n\n186\n00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:33.990\nwe'll say balanced, and\nI might say power button.\n\n187\n00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.590\nAll right, and then what I can do\nhere is choose the next option.\n\n188\n00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:44.217\nThose first couple little things that\nwe can do, turning off display or\n\n189\n00:09:44.217 --> 00:09:46.282\nputting the computer to sleep, right?\n\n190\n00:09:46.282 --> 00:09:50.270\nBut now notice that I have my own, right?\n\n191\n00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:51.220\nYou notice that there?\n\n192\n00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n193\n00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.281\nAnd I could come in here and\nI could say, you know what?\n\n194\n00:09:55.281 --> 00:09:59.350\nI wanna edit these plans, or\nthis power plan settings.\n\n195\n00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:02.190\nI'll leave this at the defaults and\nI'm gonna go in here and\n\n196\n00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.415\nI'm gonna make some changes just\nlike we did to the other one.\n\n197\n00:10:04.415 --> 00:10:08.015\nBecause maybe a lot of times, you wanna\nleave defaults and if you're gonna make\n\n198\n00:10:08.015 --> 00:10:12.805\ntoo many configurations, you can just copy\none of the defaults and then modify those.\n\n199\n00:10:12.805 --> 00:10:16.265\nSo that if you ever have an issue\nwhere maybe you can't figure out,\n\n200\n00:10:16.265 --> 00:10:19.135\nlet's say I go in here and\nI turn the hard drive off.\n\n201\n00:10:19.135 --> 00:10:23.910\nI want to turn it off after 30 minutes.\n\n202\n00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:27.280\nRight, maybe, let's see,\nwireless adapter settings.\n\n203\n00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.580\nRight, power saving mode.\n\n204\n00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.350\nMax performance.\n\n205\n00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:33.351\nI want medium power saving.\n\n206\n00:10:33.351 --> 00:10:36.376\nWe'll leave the USB settings alone.\n\n207\n00:10:36.376 --> 00:10:40.251\nAnd again, the power button here, I wanna\ngo ahead and instead of saying shut down,\n\n208\n00:10:40.251 --> 00:10:42.775\nI want you to just go ahead,\nand we'll just say sleep.\n\n209\n00:10:42.775 --> 00:10:45.250\nWe'll choose OK, all right?\n\n210\n00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:47.465\nNow, can you remember those settings,\n\n211\n00:10:47.465 --> 00:10:49.031\nZach?\n&gt;&gt; Probably not.\n\n212\n00:10:49.031 --> 00:10:50.532\n&gt;&gt; I'm not gonna do that to poor Zach,\n\n213\n00:10:50.532 --> 00:10:51.040\nover here.\n\n214\n00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.433\nHe's like, wait a second here,\n\n215\n00:10:52.433 --> 00:10:53.872\nI had to be writing those down?\n&gt;&gt; Sleep,\n\n216\n00:10:53.872 --> 00:10:54.555\nI remember sleep.\n\n217\n00:10:54.555 --> 00:10:55.231\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n218\n00:10:55.231 --> 00:10:55.984\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n219\n00:10:55.984 --> 00:10:58.387\nAnd that's where\ndocumentation comes in handy.\n\n220\n00:10:58.387 --> 00:11:01.902\nBut if you're like Wes, and\nlet's say you forgot your best practices,\n\n221\n00:11:01.902 --> 00:11:05.990\nyou say documentation's good, but\nyou forgot to write anything down.\n\n222\n00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:07.684\nI don't know why I changed in this.\n\n223\n00:11:07.684 --> 00:11:09.360\nI need to start over.\n\n224\n00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.640\nYou know what?\n\n225\n00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.970\nThat's okay because you can\nalways come back here later and\n\n226\n00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:16.810\nif you decide that maybe, you know what?\n\n227\n00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:20.737\nI'm not exactly sure\nwhat I've changed here.\n\n228\n00:11:20.737 --> 00:11:23.595\nWell you can always come in here and\nif you want,\n\n229\n00:11:23.595 --> 00:11:27.180\nyou can always restore a plan\nback to its defaults, right?\n\n230\n00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:31.540\nSo again, a great thing to have,\nthe ability, if you will,\n\n231\n00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:34.010\nto modify and create power plans, right?\n\n232\n00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:37.710\nYou can just come in here, any time you\nwant, and if you have a power plan that\n\n233\n00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:41.270\nyou want to customize and\ncreate yourself, you can do that.\n\n234\n00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:44.622\nAll right, so that's a little bit about\nyour control panel settings when it comes\n\n235\n00:11:44.622 --> 00:11:45.408\nto power options.\n\n236\n00:11:45.408 --> 00:11:46.738\nIt is just like Zach.\n\n237\n00:11:46.738 --> 00:11:50.630\nSo Zach, hopefully, after we get done with\nthis episode, you'll know a way that you\n\n238\n00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:53.353\ncan keep your computer from\ngoing to sleep in the middle of-\n\n239\n00:11:53.353 --> 00:11:54.026\n&gt;&gt; I do\n\n240\n00:11:54.026 --> 00:11:55.515\nknow-\n&gt;&gt; When\n\n241\n00:11:55.515 --> 00:11:56.031\nyou-\n&gt;&gt; Excellent-\n\n242\n00:11:56.031 --> 00:11:56.655\n&gt;&gt; Needed them most,\n\n243\n00:11:56.655 --> 00:11:57.310\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n244\n00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.240\n&gt;&gt; So just be aware that\n\n245\n00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:05.750\nhow you configure the power plans and\neven their default settings.\n\n246\n00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:07.638\nBe ready for it, be mindful of it, and\n\n247\n00:12:07.638 --> 00:12:10.828\nknow what's gonna happen when\nyou do choose those power plans.\n\n248\n00:12:10.828 --> 00:12:15.134\nI do wanna take one last second\nwhen it comes to power options, and\n\n249\n00:12:15.134 --> 00:12:18.320\nI do wanna mention one other thing.\n\n250\n00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:22.021\nAll right, and if we can take a look\nat my screen, notice here it says Put\n\n251\n00:12:22.021 --> 00:12:23.970\nthe computer to sleep.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n252\n00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:24.840\n&gt;&gt; What is that about?\n\n253\n00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.050\nWhat do we mean?\nYou say, well,\n\n254\n00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:27.770\nit's a low powered state, right?\n\n255\n00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:30.983\nIt kinda shuts the computer off,\nright, but not completely.\n\n256\n00:12:30.983 --> 00:12:33.572\nWell you would be doing\nwell if you know that, but\n\n257\n00:12:33.572 --> 00:12:36.045\nyou need to know a little bit more,\nall right?\n\n258\n00:12:36.045 --> 00:12:39.820\nAnd it really has to deal with where\nis your data being stored, right?\n\n259\n00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.150\nBecause there's two types\nof low powered states that.\n\n260\n00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:43.500\nTwo of the most common.\n\n261\n00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:44.878\nThere are many of them.\n\n262\n00:12:44.878 --> 00:12:46.290\nMany different power states.\n\n263\n00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:49.270\nBut two of the ones that we really\nwanna understand is sleep and\n\n264\n00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.010\nhibernate, all right?\n\n265\n00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:52.730\nSo what are the differences?\n\n266\n00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:57.940\nWell, remember that your data in\nyour operating system is stored in\n\n267\n00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:01.240\nvolatile memory, RAM,\nyour random access memory.\n\n268\n00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.930\nAnd I'm gonna throw a rhetorical\nquestion at you here and use.\n\n269\n00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:09.170\nWell actually, Zach, you've been doing so\nmany of these episodes with me,\n\n270\n00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:13.040\nwhat happens to the data that's\nin RAM when I pull the power,\n\n271\n00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.480\nif it's volatile?\n&gt;&gt; If you pull the power while it's being\n\n272\n00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.820\nstored or being manipulated or moved,\n\n273\n00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.960\nyou're gonna lose it.\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n274\n00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.010\nSo I want you to keep what Zach just said,\n\n275\n00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:26.960\nkeep it in the back of your memory,\nboy that's redundant.\n\n276\n00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.930\nKeep it back here in the back of\nyour memory just for a second.\n\n277\n00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:32.520\nSo when I put a computer into sleep state,\n\n278\n00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.850\nwhat happens to the data that's in RAM,\nall right?\n\n279\n00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:38.794\nIt keeps a little bit of current on it.\n\n280\n00:13:38.794 --> 00:13:42.050\nIt keeps that information refreshed,\nright?\n\n281\n00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:45.696\nBecause if I pull that power,\nonce you go back to what Zach said,\n\n282\n00:13:45.696 --> 00:13:48.398\nright on the money,\nis that if I lose the power,\n\n283\n00:13:48.398 --> 00:13:50.900\nall the data that's in RAM is gone.\n&gt;&gt; It's gone.\n\n284\n00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:52.720\n&gt;&gt; So imagine that you are,\n\n285\n00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.930\nlet's go back to what we kinda\nstarted out there with Zach.\n\n286\n00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:58.950\nZach says,\nwhat happens to my presentation?\n\n287\n00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:00.780\nWell, if you lose power, it's gone.\n\n288\n00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:02.720\nThe data's gone.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n289\n00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.203\n&gt;&gt; But if your computer can go into\n\n290\n00:14:04.203 --> 00:14:07.453\na sleep state then what it does is\nit shuts everything down except for\n\n291\n00:14:07.453 --> 00:14:11.333\nthe little trickle of current that's\nhitting the random access memory trying to\n\n292\n00:14:11.333 --> 00:14:12.664\nkeep that data refreshed.\n\n293\n00:14:12.664 --> 00:14:16.411\nSo that when you go out of a low powered\nstate back to normal operations,\n\n294\n00:14:16.411 --> 00:14:19.533\nyou can resume and\nyou don't have to worry about losing your\n\n295\n00:14:19.533 --> 00:14:20.760\ninformation.\n\n296\n00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.310\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; All right?\n\n297\n00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:24.700\nNow what happens when the power is lost?\n\n298\n00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.785\nWell, you lose your data.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n299\n00:14:26.785 --> 00:14:27.890\n&gt;&gt; It's, again,\n\n300\n00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:31.330\nback to what Zach said originally,\nyou will lose your data.\n\n301\n00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.070\nSo, there's a risk to putting\nyour computer to sleep.\n\n302\n00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:35.320\nThere's benefit.\n\n303\n00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.783\nHopefully, I can get to an AC adapter and\nI can plug that computer in.\n\n304\n00:14:38.783 --> 00:14:40.840\nI don't have to worry about\nlosing my information.\n\n305\n00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:44.940\nBut, I'm on the road and I don't have my\nAC adapter, it's back there in the hotel.\n\n306\n00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.150\nUnfortunately, I left it in the backpack.\n\n307\n00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.880\nI lose my information, or\nI'm sorry, I lose power completely,\n\n308\n00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.327\nI lose all the information\nthat was stored in RAM, right?\n\n309\n00:14:52.327 --> 00:14:53.730\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n310\n00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:55.130\n&gt;&gt; Here's where hibernate comes in, and\n\n311\n00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.130\nthat's why I mentioned hibernation.\n\n312\n00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:01.273\nWhen you put a computer into a hibernated\nstate, what happens before, and\n\n313\n00:15:01.273 --> 00:15:04.780\nthey actually, operating systems\ndo this kinda weird today.\n\n314\n00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:09.687\nBut for the most part, I want you to know\nthe main operation essentially is to take\n\n315\n00:15:09.687 --> 00:15:13.530\nthat information that's in RAM and\nwrite it to the hard drive.\n\n316\n00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.190\nAnd then shut the computer down.\n\n317\n00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:18.820\nWhy?\n\n318\n00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:23.620\nBecause then when we resume\nour normal operations,\n\n319\n00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:28.480\nthe information is actually in a system\nfile called hiberfil.sys file.\n\n320\n00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.570\nAnd it's your system's date.\n\n321\n00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:32.316\nAnd all that information is\nloaded back into RAM, and\n\n322\n00:15:32.316 --> 00:15:34.155\nyou resume like nothing happened.\n\n323\n00:15:34.155 --> 00:15:37.490\nNow there's a benefit and\nthere's a drawback to hibernation as well.\n\n324\n00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:41.080\nBiggest drawback to hibernation is the\nfact that it takes longer to get back to\n\n325\n00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.580\nan operating state,\nan operational state than it does sleep.\n\n326\n00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.082\nIt takes a little bit longer, right?\n\n327\n00:15:46.082 --> 00:15:48.780\nDoesn't go through a full boot\nprocess because what happens is when\n\n328\n00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.814\nthe boot loader goes to\nload the operating system,\n\n329\n00:15:50.814 --> 00:15:53.109\nit says,\nI see you've got some hibernation state.\n\n330\n00:15:53.109 --> 00:15:56.680\nWe're not gonna proceed with the normal\nboot process We'll load that into RAM and\n\n331\n00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.279\nwe'll resume from there, so\nit takes a little bit longer.\n\n332\n00:15:59.279 --> 00:16:02.936\nIt's not a full boot process, but boy,\nwhen you need to work with your computer,\n\n333\n00:16:02.936 --> 00:16:04.590\nit can feel like it, let me tell you.\n\n334\n00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:07.610\nThe faster computers get,\nthe more impatient I get.\n\n335\n00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.888\nHowever, I will tell you that one of the\ngreat things is, is if you do lose power,\n\n336\n00:16:10.888 --> 00:16:12.528\nand this is the benefit of hibernation,\n\n337\n00:16:12.528 --> 00:16:14.524\nyou don't have to worry\nabout losing your data.\n\n338\n00:16:14.524 --> 00:16:18.497\nBecause it was written to the hard drive\nbefore it went into the hibernated state,\n\n339\n00:16:18.497 --> 00:16:20.510\nI can resume and pick up my data.\n\n340\n00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:24.970\nNow I will tell you a lot of systems\ntoday do a hybrid hibernation,\n\n341\n00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:27.430\nif I can say that right.\n\n342\n00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.730\nBecause what they do is they\nput you in a low powered state,\n\n343\n00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:36.100\na sleep state, right after they\nwrite everything to the hard drive.\n\n344\n00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.590\nSo now you've got a hibernated sleep,\nit just says,\n\n345\n00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:41.450\nhey, since you're already there,\ngo ahead and\n\n346\n00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:45.850\nwrite that information to the hyper\nfilled.sys file, to that hibernation file.\n\n347\n00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:49.370\nBut keep the current refreshing the RAM,\nso\n\n348\n00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:52.490\nthat we can get back to\nan operational state faster.\n\n349\n00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:54.680\nBut should you lose power,\n\n350\n00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.660\nwe've already written your\ninformation on the hard drive.\n\n351\n00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.740\nSo you kind of get the best\nof both worlds there.\n\n352\n00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:02.630\nThe way that's gonna be handled is\nreally contingent on the hardware,\n\n353\n00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:03.640\nthe vendor itself.\n\n354\n00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:07.130\nLess Microsoft side on that one too,\n\n355\n00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:08.580\nit's really contingent\nupon the hardware itself.\n\n356\n00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:13.070\nBut that's what some of the things\nI kind of wanted you to know\n\n357\n00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:14.720\nthe difference between sleep and\nhibernation.\n\n358\n00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:20.170\nBecause the choice that you choose really\nis important based on where you are in\n\n359\n00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:20.720\nyour day.\n\n360\n00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.240\nAnd when I say in your day,\n\n361\n00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.907\nin your day relative to how much\nbattery life you have left [LAUGH].\n\n362\n00:17:25.907 --> 00:17:30.236\nAll right, so that's our power settings,\nthe next thing that I wanna go into they\n\n363\n00:17:30.236 --> 00:17:33.647\nput on the exam, and\nthat's something known as File Explorer.\n\n364\n00:17:33.647 --> 00:17:40.165\nAll right, now let's go through this\nwhole naming convention change.\n\n365\n00:17:40.165 --> 00:17:43.464\nCuz some people might say, you know what,\nI've never heard of File Explorer,\n\n366\n00:17:43.464 --> 00:17:44.660\nwhat are you talking about?\n\n367\n00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:47.517\nAnd then I say,\nhere in Windows Explorer, they say,\n\n368\n00:17:47.517 --> 00:17:51.200\nWindows Explorer, I've been using that,\nI use that a lot.\n\n369\n00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:55.280\nWell, at a certain point, it was no\nlonger called Windows Explorer anymore.\n\n370\n00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:59.230\nBecause if you think about it, your\ndesktop helps you explore Windows, right?\n\n371\n00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:02.390\nSo it was a naming convention\nchange just because of that,\n\n372\n00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:04.390\nlet me show you what I mean here.\n\n373\n00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:07.270\nI'm on a Windows 7 machine here, and\n\n374\n00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:12.340\nyour primary interface inside of\nthe operating system is going to\n\n375\n00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:17.920\nbe basically launched by this little\nfolder icon down on your desktop.\n\n376\n00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.340\nThat little folder icon essentially\nis what allows you to launch\n\n377\n00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:23.830\nWindows Explorer.\n\n378\n00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:27.910\nNow, if I come over to my Windows\n8 machine, and I hover over, and\n\n379\n00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:28.680\nlet's see if it does it.\n\n380\n00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.490\nIf I hover over the little folder icon\nhere, notice that it says File Explorer.\n\n381\n00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:38.590\nRight, so what are the differences\nbetween this one and, well, that one?\n\n382\n00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:43.150\nWell, not much, let's go ahead, and\nthe first one that we're gonna do,\n\n383\n00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:46.570\nwe'll dive into our Windows 8.1 machine\nhere and we'll look at File Explorer and\n\n384\n00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:47.600\nwe'll come back.\n\n385\n00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.960\nSince they call it File Explorer, and\nwe'll really see what the difference is\n\n386\n00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.060\nbetween File Explorer and\nWindows Explorer.\n\n387\n00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:58.160\nAnd the answer really is nothing more\nthan a name and a little coat of paint.\n\n388\n00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:02.360\nAll right, so File Explorer here,\nyou'll see is your primary graphical user\n\n389\n00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:08.100\ninterface to work with files and folders,\nright, hence why it's named File Explorer,\n\n390\n00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:08.724\nright.\n&gt;&gt; Gosh,\n\n391\n00:19:08.724 --> 00:19:09.954\nthat makes sense.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n392\n00:19:09.954 --> 00:19:12.180\nit's almost like they knew\nwhat they were doing here.\n\n393\n00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:16.010\nAll right, so this allows me to\nbasically work with a folder hierarchy\n\n394\n00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:17.940\ninside of the GUI.\n\n395\n00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:21.380\nAll right, and we can do this\nfrom a two pane view, right?\n\n396\n00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:24.930\nOn the left hand side, you have\nwhat's known as the explorer pane,\n\n397\n00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:27.702\nnavigation pane I've heard it called too,\n\n398\n00:19:27.702 --> 00:19:32.150\nI've also heard it called\nthe folder hierarchy, all right?\n\n399\n00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:36.537\nAnd back in the days of Windows 7, there\nwe go, it looks like we had a little bit\n\n400\n00:19:36.537 --> 00:19:40.135\nof a glitch there, as Windows 7 was\ntrying to wake itself up there.\n\n401\n00:19:40.135 --> 00:19:44.664\n[LAUGH] So if I hover over, down here at\nthe bottom, Zach, notice if I hover over\n\n402\n00:19:44.664 --> 00:19:49.213\nour folder icon, and that's what I wanted\nto show you guys and gals out there.\n\n403\n00:19:49.213 --> 00:19:50.322\nIf you hover over it,\n\n404\n00:19:50.322 --> 00:19:54.720\nyou'll see that essentially it\nsays it's Windows Explorer, right?\n\n405\n00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:59.520\nAgain, back here on our Windows 8.1\nmachine, notice that, and let's see,\n\n406\n00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.000\nit might not do it because it's open.\n\n407\n00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.050\nHere, let me go ahead and\nclose that down real quick.\n\n408\n00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:07.700\nAnd again, we hover over this,\nnotice it says File Explorer.\n\n409\n00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.930\nAgain, the difference is in naming\nconvention, guys and girls out there.\n\n410\n00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:15.210\nSo just know that when you look at it,\nfor the most part,\n\n411\n00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:18.600\nthe interface really hasn't changed much.\n\n412\n00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:23.725\nAll right, and again,\nit is how we look at our various drives,\n\n413\n00:20:23.725 --> 00:20:25.872\nour folders, our files.\n\n414\n00:20:25.872 --> 00:20:31.509\nThis is where we can do things like even\nopen up Properties of our hard drive,\n\n415\n00:20:31.509 --> 00:20:35.490\nwe can see what the disk\nspace is in this case, right.\n\n416\n00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:39.360\nAnd on the left hand side,\nwe get to navigate through libraries and\n\n417\n00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:44.230\neven the entire folder hierarchy,\nif we really wanted to.\n\n418\n00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:49.730\nAll right, again,\nwhen we get into our Windows 8.1 machine,\n\n419\n00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:54.460\nnotice File Explorer, little squared out,\nnot quite the rounded edges.\n\n420\n00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.540\nAnd for the time,\neverything was minimalistic for\n\n421\n00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.730\nthe Windows 8.1 interface.\n\n422\n00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:03.345\nSo little bit of a coat of paint,\nright, has changed, but again,\n\n423\n00:21:03.345 --> 00:21:08.315\nyou're also being able to browse\nthe folder hierarchy here as well.\n\n424\n00:21:08.315 --> 00:21:11.645\nAll right, now, one of the things\nI will tell you that has changed,\n\n425\n00:21:11.645 --> 00:21:15.145\nthe biggest change here between\nthese two is the way we\n\n426\n00:21:15.145 --> 00:21:19.945\nview things inside of File Explorer, all\nright, or, Windows Explorer, if you will.\n\n427\n00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:21.615\nI'm gonna use both terms here, but\n\n428\n00:21:21.615 --> 00:21:25.725\nnotice that we've got these little\nbuttons that we can push, depending.\n\n429\n00:21:25.725 --> 00:21:28.970\nWell, it really depends on\nwhere you're at, all right?\n\n430\n00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:32.550\nNow notice I changed from Local Disk C,\nright,\n\n431\n00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:37.035\nor Computer, and\nnotice that we've got the buttons here.\n\n432\n00:21:37.035 --> 00:21:41.226\nAgain, so they're context sensitive,\nright, it depends on what the context is,\n\n433\n00:21:41.226 --> 00:21:42.180\nwhere you select.\n\n434\n00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:46.453\nI select Documents,\nI can create a new folder, and we're gonna\n\n435\n00:21:46.453 --> 00:21:51.370\ntalk about these folder and search\noptions coming up in a second, right?\n\n436\n00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:57.180\nBut again, it is based on what\nyou select on the left hand side.\n\n437\n00:21:58.284 --> 00:22:01.500\nNow, when Windows 8 and\n8.1 come out, what they did is,\n\n438\n00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:05.350\nthey took some of the functionality or\nthe features of the interface on their\n\n439\n00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:08.800\nOffice suite, and\nembedded it right into File Explorer.\n\n440\n00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:12.910\nSo for instance, notice across the top\nhere, options are a little bit different,\n\n441\n00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:16.020\nwe don't have the buttons, but\nwe still have an options menu.\n\n442\n00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:20.237\nAnd if I go to something like the view\ntab, right, notice that, let me bring that\n\n443\n00:22:20.237 --> 00:22:23.910\nback up, notice that I have this,\nwhat's known as a ribbon, right.\n\n444\n00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:28.112\nAny of you that have ever worked in\nan office, what I mean is Windows Office,\n\n445\n00:22:28.112 --> 00:22:31.722\nexcuse me, not in an office, but\nWindows Office or PowerPoint,\n\n446\n00:22:31.722 --> 00:22:34.170\nyou've probably seen this ribbon before.\n\n447\n00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:39.020\nAnd they basically integrated\nthe ribbon into File Explorer\n\n448\n00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:43.960\nas of Windows 8 and 8.1, and then included\non after that in Windows 10, all right?\n\n449\n00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:47.130\nAnd this is also based on\nwhat you are selecting.\n\n450\n00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:49.620\nSo for instance,\nnotice that we've got our icons here.\n\n451\n00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:54.932\nI can choose small icons if I wanted,\nwe can use extra large icons here.\n\n452\n00:22:54.932 --> 00:23:00.280\nI can group these, I can define how\nthe panes are gonna look, right?\n\n453\n00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:04.440\nDo I want the preview pane, details pane,\nnavigation pane, if you will.\n\n454\n00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.860\nHow do I want these set up, and\n\n455\n00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:08.720\nit's really based on how\nyou want to view these.\n\n456\n00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:12.206\nAll right, and if we move over\nto our Windows 10 machine here,\n\n457\n00:23:12.206 --> 00:23:16.030\nwe get logged back in, sorry about that,\nlooks like it logged me out.\n\n458\n00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:22.090\nAll right, and notice that if I\nhover over the taskbar here and\n\n459\n00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:23.800\nI look at File Explorer down here.\n\n460\n00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:29.490\nAgain, same thing, and you'll notice\nthat it really hasn't changed too much.\n\n461\n00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:33.416\nOne of the things that has changed\neven between your Windows 8.1 and\n\n462\n00:23:33.416 --> 00:23:37.360\nyour Windows 10 machines is\nthis quick access option.\n\n463\n00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:41.865\nAll right, quick access gives you\nthe ability, if you will, that you can pin\n\n464\n00:23:41.865 --> 00:23:46.113\nthings, pin different locations to\nthe quick access drop-down menu.\n\n465\n00:23:46.113 --> 00:23:49.086\nAnd it does exactly what it sounds like,\nright, it's built into the name,\n\n466\n00:23:49.086 --> 00:23:50.209\ngives me one click, right?\n\n467\n00:23:50.209 --> 00:23:56.025\nI don't have to expand out,\nfind the current directory that I want.\n\n468\n00:23:56.025 --> 00:24:00.258\nMaybe I wanna make sure, oops,\nnot that one cuz I don't have permissions.\n\n469\n00:24:00.258 --> 00:24:04.130\n[LAUGH] Right, maybe I wanna make\nsure that my profile file or\n\n470\n00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:06.306\nfolder is right there at the top.\n\n471\n00:24:06.306 --> 00:24:08.618\nI don't necessarily need to do this,\n\n472\n00:24:08.618 --> 00:24:11.956\nbut I can pin this to the quick access,\nand guess what?\n\n473\n00:24:11.956 --> 00:24:14.267\nIt is now in there for me, all right?\n\n474\n00:24:14.267 --> 00:24:17.440\nOops, and I gotta scroll up, so\nyou guys can actually see that.\n\n475\n00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.184\nAll right, notice my profile\nis now under the Quick access\n\n476\n00:24:20.184 --> 00:24:20.827\nmenu.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n477\n00:24:20.827 --> 00:24:22.719\n&gt;&gt; That was a little bit different than\n\n478\n00:24:22.719 --> 00:24:27.197\nwhat we had back here in Windows 10 or,\nexcuse me, Windows 8.1, Windows 8 and\n\n479\n00:24:27.197 --> 00:24:31.067\neven Windows 7 days, we have just\nwhat's known as Libraries, right?\n\n480\n00:24:31.067 --> 00:24:35.586\nNo Quick access, and we've talked about\nin other episodes what the Libraries\n\n481\n00:24:35.586 --> 00:24:36.216\ndo.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n482\n00:24:36.216 --> 00:24:37.255\n&gt;&gt; Grouping together,\n\n483\n00:24:37.255 --> 00:24:40.259\nthere are multiple locations\nunder a single target, right?\n\n484\n00:24:40.259 --> 00:24:41.805\nGreat thing to have.\n\n485\n00:24:41.805 --> 00:24:49.198\nNow, you can have libraries inside of\nWindows 10's File Explorer if you will,\n\n486\n00:24:49.198 --> 00:24:54.461\nbut by default it doesn't\nshow those Libraries, right?\n\n487\n00:24:54.461 --> 00:24:58.995\nAnd what you have to do in order to get\nyour Libraries to be viewed is you have\n\n488\n00:24:58.995 --> 00:25:02.008\nto change what's known\nas your folder options.\n\n489\n00:25:02.008 --> 00:25:04.230\nAnd folder options\nare important to understand.\n\n490\n00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:07.232\nAnd to do that there's a couple of\ndifferent ways that you can do this.\n\n491\n00:25:07.232 --> 00:25:11.150\nI'll show you the way in Windows 10 here,\nkinda makes it easier.\n\n492\n00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:15.316\nAnd as of the ribbon bar,\nit does make this fairly easy to get to.\n\n493\n00:25:15.316 --> 00:25:19.302\nBut notice up here you have the Options,\nand I know I did that kinda fast, so\n\n494\n00:25:19.302 --> 00:25:21.140\nsorry about that guys and gals.\n\n495\n00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:25.024\nNotice the View tab here, we've got File,\nHome, Share, and View., all right?\n\n496\n00:25:25.024 --> 00:25:26.910\nIf I come over here to Options, and\n\n497\n00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:31.157\nI choose Options that brings up what's\nknown as Folder Options, all right?\n\n498\n00:25:31.157 --> 00:25:35.427\nNow I'm gonna ahead and hold tight on that\nbecause I wanna go over the Windows 8.1\n\n499\n00:25:35.427 --> 00:25:37.699\nand know that you do the same thing,\nright?\n\n500\n00:25:37.699 --> 00:25:41.632\nNotice that I have this View tab and\nfrom the View tab here,\n\n501\n00:25:41.632 --> 00:25:45.018\nI can go over to Options,\nand I can click Options.\n\n502\n00:25:45.018 --> 00:25:48.703\nAnd here's Folder Options,\njust like we had before, alright?\n\n503\n00:25:48.703 --> 00:25:52.104\nNotice it's pretty consistent between\nthe two different operating systems.\n\n504\n00:25:52.104 --> 00:25:54.874\nWell just when you understand that,\nI'm gonna take Windows 7, and\n\n505\n00:25:54.874 --> 00:25:56.851\nI'm gonna steer away\nfrom your understanding.\n\n506\n00:25:56.851 --> 00:25:57.769\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n507\n00:25:57.769 --> 00:25:59.303\n&gt;&gt; And let me show you what I mean,\n\n508\n00:25:59.303 --> 00:26:03.378\nbecause it's a little bit different in\nWindows 10, or excuse me, Windows 7.\n\n509\n00:26:03.378 --> 00:26:05.690\nAnd by the way,\nthis would apply to Vista too.\n\n510\n00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:07.373\nNotice on the left hand side at the top,\n\n511\n00:26:07.373 --> 00:26:10.033\nwe've got the organize option\nthat I was mentioning before.\n\n512\n00:26:10.033 --> 00:26:14.113\nWell if I scroll down about half way,\nyou'll see, Folder and search options and\n\n513\n00:26:14.113 --> 00:26:17.479\nwhen I select that, notice now I\nhave Folder Options, all tight?\n\n514\n00:26:17.479 --> 00:26:21.239\nBut this is,\ntechnically we're still talking about\n\n515\n00:26:21.239 --> 00:26:22.882\nControl Panel.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n516\n00:26:22.882 --> 00:26:23.664\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n517\n00:26:23.664 --> 00:26:27.841\nI showed you how to get to Folder Options\nin each one of the different Explorer\n\n518\n00:26:27.841 --> 00:26:28.762\nviews, right?\n\n519\n00:26:28.762 --> 00:26:31.628\nWell, let's go a little farther here,\nall right?\n\n520\n00:26:31.628 --> 00:26:35.070\nI’m gonna go ahead and\nclose down Our folder options.\n\n521\n00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:38.722\nWe're gonna push our Start button,\nand we're gonna go to Control Panel.\n\n522\n00:26:38.722 --> 00:26:42.628\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nchange from the Category view up here to\n\n523\n00:26:42.628 --> 00:26:43.386\nLarge Icons.\n\n524\n00:26:43.386 --> 00:26:46.498\nAnd I want you to look right there,\nFolder Options.\n\n525\n00:26:46.498 --> 00:26:49.280\nNotice that File Explorer or\nWindows Explorer, in this case.\n\n526\n00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.193\nAnd again just semantics there.\n\n527\n00:26:51.193 --> 00:26:56.203\nIt didn't have to be open for\nme to see the Folder Options, right?\n\n528\n00:26:56.203 --> 00:27:00.216\nAnd the same thing goes with any other\nplace that you can get to Control Panel.\n\n529\n00:27:00.216 --> 00:27:06.005\nSo if I move over here and I close\ndown Folder Options and File Explorer,\n\n530\n00:27:06.005 --> 00:27:11.423\nand we right-click on our Windows charm,\nchoose Control Panel.\n\n531\n00:27:11.423 --> 00:27:13.198\nAll right, I'll do the same thing here.\n\n532\n00:27:13.198 --> 00:27:17.894\nWe'll go from Category to Large Icons,\nmake it easier for me to see and\n\n533\n00:27:17.894 --> 00:27:21.563\nin here you will see, yes,\nthere are Folder Options.\n\n534\n00:27:21.563 --> 00:27:24.540\nSo a couple different ways that\nyou can get to the same location.\n\n535\n00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.831\nNow, notice that we have what's\nknown is the General tab, right?\n\n536\n00:27:27.831 --> 00:27:31.382\nNotice that the General tab tells us about\nthe Navigation pane, what we can do,\n\n537\n00:27:31.382 --> 00:27:33.563\nAutomatically expand to\nthe current location.\n\n538\n00:27:33.563 --> 00:27:37.164\nWe can modify that, that's the left\nhand pane that we talked about, right?\n\n539\n00:27:37.164 --> 00:27:41.272\nBrowsing folders, as well as View, right?\n\n540\n00:27:41.272 --> 00:27:45.477\nThis is another thing that's kind of\nimportant and I want you to be aware of.\n\n541\n00:27:45.477 --> 00:27:48.427\nBy default,\ninside of your File Explorer, and\n\n542\n00:27:48.427 --> 00:27:51.979\nI will bring everything back up here,\nso we can see this.\n\n543\n00:27:51.979 --> 00:27:57.997\nI wanna do this against the canvas\nof a File Explorer window.\n\n544\n00:27:57.997 --> 00:28:01.199\nAnd that is the fact that,\nnotice in the View tab,\n\n545\n00:28:01.199 --> 00:28:04.645\nit talks about Don't show hidden files and\nfolders.\n\n546\n00:28:04.645 --> 00:28:08.586\nAnd the View tab you can get very,\nvery granular on what you can see.\n\n547\n00:28:08.586 --> 00:28:12.889\nAs well as Hide extensions for known file\ntypes, that's because the average end user\n\n548\n00:28:12.889 --> 00:28:16.732\nreally doesn't need to see those\nextensions and hidden files and folders.\n\n549\n00:28:16.732 --> 00:28:19.984\nBecause Windows protects those, right?\n\n550\n00:28:19.984 --> 00:28:22.790\nThat's what makes\nthe operating system function.\n\n551\n00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:25.718\nSo they think that the average user\ndoesn't need to see those, and\n\n552\n00:28:25.718 --> 00:28:26.616\nas well extension.\n\n553\n00:28:26.616 --> 00:28:29.807\nSo if I get into for instance,\nDocuments, all right?\n\n554\n00:28:29.807 --> 00:28:32.779\nNotice that we have this\nfile extension here, right?\n\n555\n00:28:32.779 --> 00:28:36.573\n.vhdx from an earlier episode that we did?\n\n556\n00:28:36.573 --> 00:28:39.323\nWell I'm gonna actually go ahead and\nuncheck that, and\n\n557\n00:28:39.323 --> 00:28:41.028\nthis is what the default would be.\n\n558\n00:28:41.028 --> 00:28:43.398\nNotice how that extension is gone.\n\n559\n00:28:43.398 --> 00:28:48.442\nWell that's because, according to\nthe default view of File Explorer,\n\n560\n00:28:48.442 --> 00:28:53.071\nWindows Explorer, depending on\nwhich one we're talking about,\n\n561\n00:28:53.071 --> 00:28:55.640\nthe default says, you know what?\n\n562\n00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:59.184\nJust Don't show those hidden files or\nfolders and hide extensions for\n\n563\n00:28:59.184 --> 00:29:01.478\nknown file types,\nthis is the default view.\n\n564\n00:29:01.478 --> 00:29:05.663\nBut if I wanna show those,\nI can actually uncheck Hide extension for\n\n565\n00:29:05.663 --> 00:29:09.272\nknown file types as well as\nShow hidden files and folders.\n\n566\n00:29:09.272 --> 00:29:14.320\nAnd we can go ahead and choose Apply,\nand notice there's my extension back.\n\n567\n00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:17.886\nIt shows me what the file extension is,\nand that might be something that,\n\n568\n00:29:17.886 --> 00:29:20.484\nif you need to support your end users,\nyou have to do.\n\n569\n00:29:20.484 --> 00:29:23.574\nThe other thing that we can do is\nwhat does a hidden folder look like?\n\n570\n00:29:23.574 --> 00:29:25.412\nI'm gonna get down into the user,\nwell actually,\n\n571\n00:29:25.412 --> 00:29:27.138\nwe can show you ProgramData\nis one right there.\n\n572\n00:29:27.138 --> 00:29:29.390\nWe'll show you another one here too.\n\n573\n00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:32.400\nSo notice how that file there is\nkinda a little bit different color,\n\n574\n00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.170\nit's as quite as bold, right?\n\n575\n00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:38.041\nIt's a little lighter than the other one,\nthat let's me know that that's normally\n\n576\n00:29:38.041 --> 00:29:40.729\nthat would not be seen inside\nof Windows or File Explorer.\n\n577\n00:29:40.729 --> 00:29:46.260\nIt has been hidden and we chose to\nbasically change the default view.\n\n578\n00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:49.380\nBy going to Users here,\nnotice that we have a Default.\n\n579\n00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:51.749\nWe've talked about this profile\nin other episodes, right?\n\n580\n00:29:51.749 --> 00:29:56.033\nThe Default profiles, the template that\nis used and copied down the moment a user\n\n581\n00:29:56.033 --> 00:30:00.128\nlogs onto a machine for the very first\ntime, they have to have their profile.\n\n582\n00:30:00.128 --> 00:30:02.639\nTheir profile is set by\nthe Default profile.\n\n583\n00:30:02.639 --> 00:30:03.721\nIt's copied down and\n\n584\n00:30:03.721 --> 00:30:06.854\nthere user name is applied to\nthe new folder that was created.\n\n585\n00:30:06.854 --> 00:30:11.037\nWell that's a hidden file and folder, they\nsay you don't really need to see that.\n\n586\n00:30:11.037 --> 00:30:14.211\nI could also do something like for\ninstance here,\n\n587\n00:30:14.211 --> 00:30:17.469\ngo into the Administrator\nfolder notice AppData.\n\n588\n00:30:17.469 --> 00:30:18.778\nAppData is another one, right?\n\n589\n00:30:18.778 --> 00:30:22.128\nIf we get down into app data things like\nfor instance like local and then temp.\n\n590\n00:30:22.128 --> 00:30:26.123\nYou can see where all the temporary files\nare stored for my user profile, right?\n\n591\n00:30:26.123 --> 00:30:30.469\nSo again, we don't usually have\nby default a view to this, but\n\n592\n00:30:30.469 --> 00:30:33.513\nthat's where you can manipulate the view.\n\n593\n00:30:33.513 --> 00:30:35.875\nAnd again,\nsometimes you might just have to do that.\n\n594\n00:30:35.875 --> 00:30:40.280\nAnd you can do that, again,\nthrough your Folder Options.\n\n595\n00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:43.221\nLet me show you the last thing here too.\n\n596\n00:30:43.221 --> 00:30:47.871\nI'm gonna cancel this out here, and\nlet me get back to Quick Access.\n\n597\n00:30:47.871 --> 00:30:49.935\nThis is another thing that\nwas new to Windows 10,\n\n598\n00:30:49.935 --> 00:30:52.777\na little bit different with\nFile Explorer that wasn't there before.\n\n599\n00:30:52.777 --> 00:30:54.950\nYou can actually see, and\nyou an kind of read this here,\n\n600\n00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:57.968\nAfter you've opened some files,\nwe'll show you the most recent ones here.\n\n601\n00:30:57.968 --> 00:30:58.540\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n602\n00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:00.143\n&gt;&gt; Now for privacy concerns,\n\n603\n00:31:00.143 --> 00:31:02.726\nyou might not want that be that way,\nright?\n\n604\n00:31:02.726 --> 00:31:05.777\nEspecially if you've got maybe a secure\nenvironment where somebody just happens\n\n605\n00:31:05.777 --> 00:31:07.066\nto be looking over your shoulder.\n\n606\n00:31:07.066 --> 00:31:10.485\nMaybe you don't wanna have recent\nfolders up, files up here.\n\n607\n00:31:10.485 --> 00:31:13.554\nWell, or maybe you like\nthe library functionality and\n\n608\n00:31:13.554 --> 00:31:16.299\nyou wanted that in the navigation pane,\nright?\n\n609\n00:31:16.299 --> 00:31:22.170\nSo remember that you can go to your\nView option, and then choose Options.\n\n610\n00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:26.154\nAnd this gives me the ability to,\nI can Clear that history,\n\n611\n00:31:26.154 --> 00:31:28.079\nor I can say, you know what?\n\n612\n00:31:28.079 --> 00:31:32.472\nI don't wanna show any of the recently\nused files in Quick access or\n\n613\n00:31:32.472 --> 00:31:35.780\ndo I wanna Show frequently used folders,\nright?\n\n614\n00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:38.740\nAnd then we can Apply that setting.\n\n615\n00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:41.348\nNotice that if I want to View libraries,\n\n616\n00:31:41.348 --> 00:31:44.580\nbecause of the way we have\nthat Quick access here.\n\n617\n00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:46.126\nI have to go to the View tab and\n\n618\n00:31:46.126 --> 00:31:49.106\nI have to scroll all the way\ndown to the bottom, right?\n\n619\n00:31:49.106 --> 00:31:51.851\nAnd we can say, hey,\nNavigation pane on the left hand side.\n\n620\n00:31:51.851 --> 00:31:54.108\nLet's go ahead and\nshow those libraries, right?\n\n621\n00:31:54.108 --> 00:31:56.517\nAnd I'll go ahead and\nchoose Apply and now,\n\n622\n00:31:56.517 --> 00:31:59.132\nI have those libraries\nthat weren't present.\n\n623\n00:31:59.132 --> 00:32:01.576\nSo couple minor differences, right?\n\n624\n00:32:01.576 --> 00:32:04.244\nBut for the most part,\nyou're still using the same interface.\n\n625\n00:32:04.244 --> 00:32:06.074\nAgain, just some different bells and\n\n626\n00:32:06.074 --> 00:32:08.654\nwhistles between the different\noperating systems.\n\n627\n00:32:08.654 --> 00:32:14.100\nReally largely unchanged since the days\nof the earlier Windows Explorer,\n\n628\n00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.738\nand that is more so\njust semantics than anything.\n\n629\n00:32:17.738 --> 00:32:20.030\nBut it might be a semantic that\nyou need to know on the exam.\n\n630\n00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:23.232\nThey might give you an operating\nsystem and they say,\n\n631\n00:32:23.232 --> 00:32:25.736\nokay, you need to get to Folder Options.\n\n632\n00:32:25.736 --> 00:32:27.218\nHow do you do this?\n\n633\n00:32:27.218 --> 00:32:30.463\nAnd if they say Windows Explorer and\nyou're talking about Windows 8.1,\n\n634\n00:32:30.463 --> 00:32:33.568\nit's not Windows Explorerer,\nthat's what it was named in Windows 7.\n\n635\n00:32:33.568 --> 00:32:37.740\nAgain, just minor things that might help\nyou out when it comes to that MTA exam.\n\n636\n00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:40.330\nAnd some of the things that you need\nto be aware of when it comes to\n\n637\n00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:42.863\nconfiguring the Control Panel.\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful job, Wes, and\n\n638\n00:32:42.863 --> 00:32:46.474\nthis is Windows of Wes fundamentals,\nthe whole series is fantastic.\n\n639\n00:32:46.474 --> 00:32:50.299\nMake sure you see every episode, and\nthis has been Configuring Control Panel,\n\n640\n00:32:50.299 --> 00:32:50.879\npart four.\n\n641\n00:32:50.879 --> 00:32:53.317\nSo make sure you see all\nthe parts one through four,\n\n642\n00:32:53.317 --> 00:32:54.913\nthat'll be very helpful to you.\n\n643\n00:32:54.913 --> 00:32:58.730\nAnd when you're inside of our course\nlibrary, there's thousands of other videos\n\n644\n00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:01.254\nunder there to help

00:00:08.366\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:13.380\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello there,\n\n5\n00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.480\nthank you for choosing ITPRO.TV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.840\nI'm your host Zach Memos, as we continue\non with Windows OS Fundamentals.\n\n7\n00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.300\nWe're gonna be configuring\ndesk top settings.\n\n8\n00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.130\nThat's what we're gonna do and\nWes Bryan is gonna help us.\n\n9\n00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.750\nWes, good to see you sir.\n&gt;&gt; Hey Zach, thanks for having me here.\n\n10\n00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.450\nThat's right.\nGreat to be here and\n\n11\n00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.440\nwell you heard it from Zach,\nwe're gonna be looking at well,\n\n12\n00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.430\nour primary interface into\nthe Windows environment.\n\n13\n00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.290\nOne of the first things that confronts\nus once we log into our machines and\n\n14\n00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.850\nthat's the graphical user interface.\n\n15\n00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.800\nNow specifically the GUI, if you will,\n\n16\n00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.670\nthat we spend the most time with is\ntypically, like Zach said, is the desktop.\n\n17\n00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:52.618\nAnd that's what we're gonna look at.\n\n18\n00:00:52.618 --> 00:00:57.244\nBecause it's a highly configurable\ncomponent within your operating system,\n\n19\n00:00:57.244 --> 00:00:59.935\nand it is one that you\nshould be familiar with,\n\n20\n00:00:59.935 --> 00:01:02.917\nespecially when it comes\nto supporting end users.\n\n21\n00:01:02.917 --> 00:01:05.120\nBecause it's gonna be what the end\nusers see on a day-to-day basis.\n\n22\n00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.840\nSo let's go ahead and we'll dive right in.\n\n23\n00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.060\nIn fact, we'll look at a Windows 7 machine\nbecause keep in mind that the desktop is\n\n24\n00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.150\na little bit different as we go through\nthe different operating systems.\n\n25\n00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.530\nSo I log into the machine.\n\n26\n00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.106\nThe very first thing that I'm confronted\nwith is this space right here,\n\n27\n00:01:22.106 --> 00:01:23.540\nknown as the desktop.\n\n28\n00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.210\nAnd there are different\nthings that we can do.\n\n29\n00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.640\nSo for instance, we can configure\nthings like our display settings.\n\n30\n00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.640\nSay, well, wait a second.\n\n31\n00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.580\nFrom your desktop?\n\n32\n00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.170\nIn another episode, you talked\nabout things like Control Panel.\n\n33\n00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.290\nDon't we go to control panel and\nconfigure our operating system?\n\n34\n00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.590\nWell, yes, and no.\n\n35\n00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.190\nThat's one of the great things about\nthe desktop, is that if you right-click\n\n36\n00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.190\nout here, anywhere on the desktop,\nyou will get a series of options.\n\n37\n00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.280\nWe can manipulate how we\nview icons on the desktop,\n\n38\n00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.050\njust by right-clicking and choosing view.\n\n39\n00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.430\nAnd you can see that we\ncan change some things.\n\n40\n00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.890\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n41\n00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.690\nLet me take my recycling bin, we'll put it\nright there in the middle of the screen,\n\n42\n00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.670\nand we'll go ahead and right click and\nwe'll kind of zoom in here and\n\n43\n00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.440\nwe'll change this.\n\n44\n00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.305\nNotice what happens, Zach when I change\nthis from medium icons to large icons.\n\n45\n00:02:09.305 --> 00:02:12.675\nOr from large icons to small icons.\n\n46\n00:02:12.675 --> 00:02:16.965\nNow, I have four eyes here, so I probably\nwant to change that at least back to\n\n47\n00:02:16.965 --> 00:02:20.772\nmedium and we'll go middle of the road.\n&gt;&gt; And you're not using any power when you\n\n48\n00:02:20.772 --> 00:02:26.032\nchange the size of the icons either.\n&gt;&gt; No, it's all about,\n\n49\n00:02:26.032 --> 00:02:29.372\nwhat makes it comfortable for\nyou to use the operating system.\n\n50\n00:02:29.372 --> 00:02:31.812\nNotice that we can do things like that.\n\n51\n00:02:31.812 --> 00:02:38.090\nWe can also get to display settings,\nfor instance for our screen resolution.\n\n52\n00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.980\nI can right-click anywhere on the desktop\nand I can choose Screen Resolution.\n\n53\n00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.240\nAnd you'll see that that takes\nme to my display settings.\n\n54\n00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.100\nWe can choose the drop down arrow\nif we want and we can change it to\n\n55\n00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.420\nsome of the various resolutions that\nare supported by this operating system.\n\n56\n00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.980\nYou right click on the desktop,\nchoose screen resolutions and\n\n57\n00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.220\nyou come in here to change the resolutions\nand you don't have the values that I do,\n\n58\n00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.330\nit's really contingent on\nthe video adapter that you have.\n\n59\n00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.280\nSo let me go ahead, and\nthose are some of the display settings.\n\n60\n00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.400\nAnd if you ever needed to,\nyou could also always use,\n\n61\n00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.110\nin your control panel interface,\nthis little bread crumb trail.\n\n62\n00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:22.600\nAnd you could go back in\nyour navigation pane.\n\n63\n00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.040\nAnd one of the things that you'll see\nis that we can manipulate things like,\n\n64\n00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.830\nscale of the text too.\n\n65\n00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.780\nKeep in mind that in some of\nthe display settings we can choose,\n\n66\n00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.930\nadjusting, we've already\nseen a resolution.\n\n67\n00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.260\nSetting a custom DPI, dots per inch.\n\n68\n00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.080\nAll basically launched\nout from the desktop.\n\n69\n00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.370\nSo it is important to understand that\nyou can configure display settings too.\n\n70\n00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.690\nNow this is Windows 7.\n\n71\n00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:47.410\nWe'll come back and\n\n72\n00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.660\nwe'll kinda talk about some more\nthings within the Windows desktop too.\n\n73\n00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.280\nBut I want you to notice that you\nalso have your Windows 8.1 interface.\n\n74\n00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.100\nAnd if I Go ahead, it looks like I'm\nnot logged int, it was lying to me.\n\n75\n00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.289\nGo ahead [LAUGH] and log in here.\n\n76\n00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:04.660\nYou might be confronted with\nnot having your desktop.\n\n77\n00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.930\nYou might be confronted with this option\nhere which is known as the modern, or\n\n78\n00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.220\nthe metro UI.\n\n79\n00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.710\nNow, in Windows 8.1 they defaulted\nto showing you or previewing it in\n\n80\n00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:20.080\ndesktop mode, and they made the modern UI,\nkind of like the alternative.\n\n81\n00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.800\nAnd that's just because there was a lot of\npeople that said, hey, where's my desktop?\n\n82\n00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.050\nWe've been using it for so long.\n\n83\n00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.762\nAnd it kind of shows you, Zack,\nthe importance of the desktop.\n\n84\n00:04:27.762 --> 00:04:30.900\nAnd in understanding the importance of\nsome of the different configurations that\n\n85\n00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.650\nyou can do when it comes to\nmanipulation of the desktop.\n\n86\n00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.850\nSo to get to our desktop in our Windows\n8.1 machine you have this little\n\n87\n00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.500\ndesktop icon.\n\n88\n00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.310\nAnd that takes you back out\nto your desktop likewise.\n\n89\n00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.100\nWell, you could also see that\ninside a Windows 8.1 I can also do\n\n90\n00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.060\nthings like right-clicking\nchoosing View by, Sort by.\n\n91\n00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.050\nSort by is good for if you're one of\nthese ones that has a very busy desktop.\n\n92\n00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.440\nLots of icons just everywhere.\n\n93\n00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.350\nWell, maybe you want to sort it and\nyou want to kind of group them together by\n\n94\n00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.160\nName, Size, you can see,\nItem Type, Date Modified.\n\n95\n00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.940\nThe other thing that you can do is you\ncan also launch certain applications.\n\n96\n00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.430\nYou can create things like folders,\nyou can launch things like Bitmap images,\n\n97\n00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.820\nfor instance,\nI could create a text document.\n\n98\n00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.450\nAnd then, from here, I could just\nclick on the icon on the desktop and\n\n99\n00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:22.200\nI can launch an application from the icon,\nand that's a great thing to have as well.\n\n100\n00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.689\nIs to be able to just kind of have\naccess to clicking any icon that's on\n\n101\n00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:31.706\nthe desktop and\nbeing able to launch a program.\n\n102\n00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:36.850\nOr in this case,\nI happened to view a file.\n\n103\n00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.390\nI can also launch things like\nthe Recycle Bin here, as well.\n\n104\n00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:46.470\nAnd keep in mind too we talked about\nFile Explorer in other episodes too.\n\n105\n00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.640\nAnd one of the things I always tell you\nto remember that it's context sensitive.\n\n106\n00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.490\nSo, notice that because\nI right-clicked and\n\n107\n00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.730\nchose to open the recycle bin,\nI do have the recycle bin tools here.\n\n108\n00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.540\nAnd I could click on that and\nchoose empty recycle bin or properties or\n\n109\n00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.665\nrestore all items, which would be kind\nof like what you can do if you were to\n\n110\n00:06:09.665 --> 00:06:13.560\nright-click on the recycle\nbin on your desktop.\n\n111\n00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.940\nYou can also choose properties too and you\ncan see what kinda size you wanna keep or\n\n112\n00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.190\nfor the selected location.\n\n113\n00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.240\nAnd that just happens to be Local Disk C,\n\n114\n00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.370\nthe drive that's currently\nin this machine too.\n\n115\n00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:30.500\nSo, you can actually configure your\nrecycle bin right from the desktop too.\n\n116\n00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:33.970\nNow other things that you have too.\n\n117\n00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.960\nAgain this really depends on your Windows,\n\n118\n00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.260\nwhich Windows machine you\nmight be in front of.\n\n119\n00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:45.355\nIf you happen to be in front of a Windows\n\n120\n00:06:45.355 --> 00:06:50.190\n8.1 machine, you might see that\nyou don't have a start menu.\n\n121\n00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.130\nBecause that is one of the things\nthat they also tell you to\n\n122\n00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.570\nkeep in mind on your MTA exam.\n\n123\n00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.580\nAnd let me show you what I mean here.\n\n124\n00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.970\nSo we have to do some\nmanipulation of the start menu.\n\n125\n00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.030\nWell, in Windows 7 I have a start menu,\nand\n\n126\n00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.500\nby the way in Windows 10 I\nhave a start menu likewise.\n\n127\n00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.440\nSo on the left hand side these\nare frequently used locations, and\n\n128\n00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:17.220\nthese are the default that start out\nwhether you've used them or not.\n\n129\n00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.524\nBecause you can see calculator, media\nplayer, I haven't used media player on\n\n130\n00:07:20.524 --> 00:07:21.750\nthis machine at all.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n131\n00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.670\n&gt;&gt; There are some defaults that it starts\n\n132\n00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:28.300\nwith, but it will start to move the most\n\n133\n00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:33.350\ncommonly used applications in and\nout of these icons rights here.\n\n134\n00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:34.960\nNow that's the left hand side.\n\n135\n00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.630\nSee the left hand side is configurable.\n\n136\n00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:40.310\nYou can actually do some amount\nof configuration on this.\n\n137\n00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:44.110\nSo for instance if I decide I\nwant to go to all programs.\n\n138\n00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.520\nLet's see, games, everybody needs\nFreeCell on their start menu.\n\n139\n00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.600\nI can take an application here and\nI can select it, I can right click and\n\n140\n00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.980\nI can choose pin to the start menu.\n\n141\n00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:54.577\nWell, what does that do for me?\n\n142\n00:07:54.577 --> 00:07:58.350\nWell, when I choose the back arrow notice\nthat FreeCell is at the top of this list.\n\n143\n00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.401\nSo regardless of what's changing in and\n\n144\n00:08:00.401 --> 00:08:04.334\nout of the frequently used applications\nlist I've now said, you know what?\n\n145\n00:08:04.334 --> 00:08:08.190\nI want to make sure the free cell is there\nregardless if the other one is changing.\n\n146\n00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:13.050\nOn the left hand side this could be\nmore often than not user defined.\n\n147\n00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:16.430\nThe right hand side, there are not a lot\nof configurations you can do here.\n\n148\n00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.590\nThis is set here by the system itself.\n\n149\n00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:19.710\nYou can see, for instance,\n\n150\n00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:24.430\nit will open you up into different\nlocations within the user profile.\n\n151\n00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:28.180\nSo if I choose Admin,\nthat actually shows me the user profile.\n\n152\n00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.000\nWe'll come back to that.\n\n153\n00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.350\nCuz we have to talk about\nprofiles in this episode as well.\n\n154\n00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:34.500\nBut we'll talk about\nthem when we get there.\n\n155\n00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.160\nThat's gonna be more towards the end here.\n\n156\n00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.690\nSo just as a heads up Zach,\n\n157\n00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.472\ngoing off the beaten path here.\n&gt;&gt; No problem.\n\n158\n00:08:40.472 --> 00:08:41.010\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n159\n00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:44.390\nnotice that I can launch right\ninto my user profile here.\n\n160\n00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:46.300\nAnd let's get back to our start menu.\n\n161\n00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:50.640\nAnd you can see some of\nthe various options that you have.\n\n162\n00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.110\nNow, I can also configure the Start menu,\ntoo.\n\n163\n00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:56.400\nRemember that the Start menu can launch\nyou into a whole bunch of utilities.\n\n164\n00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.960\nBut before we do that, let's go over\nto our Windows 8.1 machine, and\n\n165\n00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.660\nnotice that there isn't a Start menu,\nright?\n\n166\n00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:07.035\nThe lack of, I guess we should\nswitch over to the Windows\n\n167\n00:09:07.035 --> 00:09:08.680\n8.1 machine to see what we don't see.\n\n168\n00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.710\nAnd that is a Start menu.\n\n169\n00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:12.320\nAll I get is this\nadministrative quick links,\n\n170\n00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:17.550\ndialogue box just by right clicking\non the little Windows charm, or\n\n171\n00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:22.730\nyou can get a Windows+X keyboard shortcut,\nand I get these administrative links.\n\n172\n00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.730\nI don't really have a start menu, so\nthere's really nothing to configure here.\n\n173\n00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:31.420\nWhen we move into Windows 10 however\nwe do kind of have a start menu back.\n\n174\n00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.730\nAnd again this is just clicking.\n\n175\n00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:37.440\nThis is kind of blending what you\nwould do in Windows 8.1 and Windows 7.\n\n176\n00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:42.460\nWindows 8.1 gives us this\nnice little Windows charm.\n\n177\n00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.080\nBut Windows 10, it's a clickable field and\nit gives me the start menu.\n\n178\n00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.950\nYou take both of those,\nyou put them together and\n\n179\n00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:49.700\nnow you have the new start menu.\n\n180\n00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.730\nEssentially, inside of Windows 10\nyou have your applications here on,\n\n181\n00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:54.990\nin the middle pane.\n\n182\n00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:58.580\nI say middle pane because, believe it or\nnot, over here on the left-hand side,\n\n183\n00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:02.410\nyou have basic settings which takes you\nin to the Windows settings location.\n\n184\n00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:04.080\nAnd then we can launch it up here.\n\n185\n00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.230\nWe've been launching from\nthe application center.\n\n186\n00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:12.160\nFrom our start menu we can also do\nthings like signing out and signing in.\n\n187\n00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.160\nSo I can choose admin,\nthe little icon there.\n\n188\n00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.280\nThis is configurable too, so\nI can put a photo of myself, if you will,\n\n189\n00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:24.760\nas a logon icon or logon photo and\nthat would show up here in this list.\n\n190\n00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.370\nBut you'll notice I can change my\naccount settings, lock the computer.\n\n191\n00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:30.137\nWe can always do this with a Windows+L for\n\n192\n00:10:30.137 --> 00:10:32.827\nsecurity purposes when we walk\naway from the Windows station.\n\n193\n00:10:32.827 --> 00:10:35.793\nYou should do a Windows+L\nto lock the machine, so\n\n194\n00:10:35.793 --> 00:10:39.970\nthat you have to enter a password in\norder to be able to use the machine.\n\n195\n00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:45.157\nThey call it that secure\nauthentication sequence, technically,\n\n196\n00:10:45.157 --> 00:10:49.560\nis what they call the whole\nCtrl+Alt+Del thing there.\n\n197\n00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.549\nI can switch accounts, as well.\n\n198\n00:10:52.549 --> 00:10:54.810\nAll the way up here at the top.\n\n199\n00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:56.030\nIt's kinda hidden.\n\n200\n00:10:56.030 --> 00:11:00.530\nYou do have the option that allows\nyou basically to expand out\n\n201\n00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:01.360\nthose three little.\n\n202\n00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.440\nSo one collapses it.\n\n203\n00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.800\nAnd we collapse it.\n\n204\n00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.740\nIt's gone.\n\n205\n00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:08.430\nBut it really doesn't change\nthe fact that those icons are there.\n\n206\n00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:11.870\nAll right,\nnow these are more of the modern UI apps.\n\n207\n00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:15.172\nToday, as of the recording,\nthese are called WA apps,\n\n208\n00:11:15.172 --> 00:11:21.160\nUniversal Windows Universal Windows app,\nmake sure I get that right.\n\n209\n00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.660\nBecause in the earlier days,\nthey were called Windows RT apps.\n\n210\n00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:26.550\nAnd again, that's because of\nthe Windows 8 and 8.1 RT.\n\n211\n00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:29.790\nHowever, today they're\ncalled universal apps.\n\n212\n00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:34.350\nAnd one of the great things is you\ncan also see them on the Start menu\n\n213\n00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:37.210\nwhere in previous Windows 8.1 if I\n\n214\n00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:42.280\nwanted to see those applications\nI had to go that Start screen.\n\n215\n00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:48.020\nThis allows you the ability to launch\nright from the more modern start menu.\n\n216\n00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.540\nLet's talk about some of\nthe configurations that we can do with\n\n217\n00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:51.130\nthe Start menu.\n\n218\n00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:56.390\nI did mention that when it comes to\nyour Start Menu, that this side really\n\n219\n00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:59.276\nyou can't do a lot of configurations.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n220\n00:11:59.276 --> 00:12:00.940\n&gt;&gt; Now, I kind of lied to you on that,\n\n221\n00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.220\nif I right-click on my Start icon,\n\n222\n00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:07.180\nnotice a little bit different here,\nI could choose Properties.\n\n223\n00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:11.310\nAnd the properties gives me\nthe ability to modify and\n\n224\n00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:14.630\ncustomize a little bit,\nif you will, the start menu.\n\n225\n00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:17.630\nLike for instance, notice it says\ncustomize how links, icons, and\n\n226\n00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:19.860\nmenus look and behave in the start menu.\n\n227\n00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:25.140\nAnd if I wanted I could choose\nto really get granular here.\n\n228\n00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.430\nAnd for instance, I believe it's\nall the way down in the list.\n\n229\n00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:30.980\nIt's been awhile since I've\nbeen on a Windows 10 machine.\n\n230\n00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.090\nThere we go,\nnotice the System administration tools.\n\n231\n00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:37.120\nThat's something that's a little\nbit different between like\n\n232\n00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:37.990\ntoday and Windows 10.\n\n233\n00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:39.760\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust park this setting here.\n\n234\n00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.920\nI'm gonna switch over to\nour Windows 10 machine.\n\n235\n00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.940\nAnd I want to show you\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n236\n00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.590\nIf I scroll down all the way on\nthe list of these applications here in\n\n237\n00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:48.690\nthe center column.\n\n238\n00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:52.600\nYou'll notice that we have things like\nWindows system Administrative Tools.\n\n239\n00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.650\nI haven't modified\nthe defaults either Zach.\n\n240\n00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:57.390\nAnd all of our administrative\ntools we've talked about in other\n\n241\n00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:58.930\nepisodes are right there\nin the start menu.\n\n242\n00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.880\nYou can actually do that\ngoing back to Windows 7.\n\n243\n00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.540\nAnd it was just a little hidden feature,\n\n244\n00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.810\nthat if you weren't aware of\nthe properties of start menu.\n\n245\n00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:12.640\nI could say, you know what, I want you\nto display this in the all programs, but\n\n246\n00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.120\nI want you to go even further than that.\n\n247\n00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.150\nNot only in all programs, I want you\nto display this on the start menu.\n\n248\n00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:18.000\nAnd I do this-\n&gt;&gt; All right now.\n\n249\n00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:18.930\n&gt;&gt; I would do this for\n\n250\n00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:20.710\nsystems that I would be managing,\nand choose Ok.\n\n251\n00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:24.580\nAnd then we'll choose Ok as well.\n\n252\n00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:29.850\nAnd then when we choose the Start\nbutton again, notice that I have added\n\n253\n00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:33.210\nthe administrative tools to the right\nhand side of the start menu.\n\n254\n00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:38.570\nI really didn't get the ability to do much\nconfiguration on that right-hand side.\n\n255\n00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:41.160\nSo that's largely defined\nby the operating system.\n\n256\n00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.470\nBut I did get the ability to do\na minor amount of configuration.\n\n257\n00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:47.580\nAnd you can go a little bit farther,\nnotice this list right here.\n\n258\n00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:50.980\nI don't care about\nthe recently opened programs.\n\n259\n00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:54.815\nMaybe I'm one of the ones that control\nfreak, I like to have control [LAUGH].\n\n260\n00:13:54.815 --> 00:13:58.895\nMaybe I want to just put in the start\nmenu exactly what I want like for\n\n261\n00:13:58.895 --> 00:13:59.755\ninstance FreeCell.\n\n262\n00:13:59.755 --> 00:14:03.595\nNow, let's not tell our employer wait\nthey might be watching this that\n\n263\n00:14:03.595 --> 00:14:06.095\nI've got FreeCell on my start\nmenu they might say well\n\n264\n00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:07.725\nwhere's your line-of-business application.\n\n265\n00:14:07.725 --> 00:14:12.315\nI want to see Word there I want to see the\nExcel spreadsheet that you're working on\n\n266\n00:14:12.315 --> 00:14:13.205\nthere not FreeCell.\n\n267\n00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.290\nOne of the things that you can do is just\nright-clicking on your Start button again,\n\n268\n00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:20.830\nchoosing Properties, and\nnotice you do have the option to.\n\n269\n00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:22.270\nNotice where it says Store and\n\n270\n00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:25.560\ndisplay recently opened programs\nin the Start menu, all right?\n\n271\n00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.130\nAnd this says do it in the taskbar.\n\n272\n00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:29.450\nWe'll look at the taskbar coming up.\n\n273\n00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:32.240\nIn fact, I'll just leave that\nsetting the way it is because\n\n274\n00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.910\nthat manipulates the taskbar and\nwe kinda wanna look at that too.\n\n275\n00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:36.800\nAnd I'll choose OK.\n\n276\n00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.640\nNow when I go back to the Start button,\nI got a nice,\n\n277\n00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:40.958\nclean canvas.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n278\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.550\n&gt;&gt; And so you can do some configurations.\n\n279\n00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:46.080\nA minor amount of configurations.\n\n280\n00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.660\nMaybe I do use\nRemote Desktop Connection a lot.\n\n281\n00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.080\nIn fact I do and I like to find it.\n\n282\n00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:56.480\nSo rather than having to go to\nAll programs, go to Accessories,\n\n283\n00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.150\nand then right there in the middle of\nAccessories is Remote Desktop Connection.\n\n284\n00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:05.260\nI can just right-click on it and\nI can chose right here, pin to start menu.\n\n285\n00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.000\nRemember, now we've done\na couple of things.\n\n286\n00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.026\nWe've pinned one,\nwe cleaned up the start menu, and\n\n287\n00:15:10.026 --> 00:15:12.862\nnow we pin another application\nto the start menu.\n\n288\n00:15:12.862 --> 00:15:17.664\nAnd now I basically am\nconfiguring the start menu\n\n289\n00:15:17.664 --> 00:15:20.600\nto work the way I want it to be.\n\n290\n00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:24.060\nSo again,\nyou do have some level of configuration.\n\n291\n00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:27.510\nNow Zach I also mentioned something\nknown as the taskbar, well the taskbar\n\n292\n00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.900\nis another feature of the Windows desktop.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n293\n00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:31.350\n&gt;&gt; So I do want\n\n294\n00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:34.130\nyou to understand that we've looked\nat things like display settings and\n\n295\n00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.142\nwhere you can do some of\nthe configurations on there.\n\n296\n00:15:36.142 --> 00:15:40.451\nRemember it's just a simple\nright click on the desktop,\n\n297\n00:15:40.451 --> 00:15:43.360\nchoose Screen Resolution.\n&gt;&gt; Hm-mm.\n\n298\n00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.510\n&gt;&gt; Allows you the ability to change\n\n299\n00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.800\nthe resolution to\nthe appearance of the display.\n\n300\n00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:50.590\nAnd then keep in mind you can always use\nthe bread crumb trail to choose Display\n\n301\n00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:52.870\nto get some additional\nconfigurations that you can do.\n\n302\n00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.070\nBut what we haven't talked\nabout is the taskbar itself,\n\n303\n00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:01.094\nall right?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n304\n00:16:01.094 --> 00:16:03.640\n&gt;&gt; So, notice that we've got this little\n\n305\n00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.193\narea down at the bottom of your screen.\n\n306\n00:16:06.193 --> 00:16:09.799\nAnd it will It extends\nacross from left to right\n\n307\n00:16:09.799 --> 00:16:14.060\nfrom one end of the screen\nall away to the other screen.\n\n308\n00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.720\nMy head is kind of covering this up.\n\n309\n00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.131\nBut notice that we got\na lot of information\n\n310\n00:16:19.131 --> 00:16:19.980\nhere.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n311\n00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:21.056\n&gt;&gt; Well, this information,\n\n312\n00:16:21.056 --> 00:16:23.500\nwe'll start from the right hand and\nwe'll work our way back.\n\n313\n00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.410\nI know that's opposite\nthe way we read here,\n\n314\n00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:27.640\nbut we start here in\nthe notification area.\n\n315\n00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.320\nSo this is the part of the task\nbar called the notification area,\n\n316\n00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.040\ncalled the system tray.\n\n317\n00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.590\nI've heard it called sys tray,\n\n318\n00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:39.720\nit just depends, really, on which\nversion of Windows you're running.\n\n319\n00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.720\nNotice that I've got some icons here.\n\n320\n00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:47.480\nAnd I could see things like, for instance,\nhow to safely remove your hardware,\n\n321\n00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.304\nif I wanted to do that, right?\n\n322\n00:16:49.304 --> 00:16:52.521\nIf I wanted to manage\nportions of Bluetooth,\n\n323\n00:16:52.521 --> 00:16:56.850\nI could do that right here from\nthe notification area, too.\n\n324\n00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:01.190\nThese are some quick one-click\nconfiguration icons, for instance,\n\n325\n00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:03.290\nmy audio, right?\n\n326\n00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:05.760\nSounds, we could manipulate.\n\n327\n00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.880\nThis is the earlier flag for\nwhat's known as the action center.\n\n328\n00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.780\nSo if I wanted to find out a little\nbit more about the action center, and\n\n329\n00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:13.740\nset it back up here.\n\n330\n00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:14.600\nOpen that.\n\n331\n00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:19.054\nThat would take me into the action center\ninside of your control panel, okay?\n\n332\n00:17:19.054 --> 00:17:21.930\nAll right, so again, notification area,\n\n333\n00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:25.620\nreally good place to get\nreally quick launch icons.\n\n334\n00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:29.720\nThe other one that I have here,\ntoo, is opening up your network and\n\n335\n00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.290\nsharing center.\n\n336\n00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:34.070\nIf I want to see real quick do I have\nInternet access, again, hover to discover.\n\n337\n00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:37.670\nAnd then finally you have what's known as,\nwell, your date and time.\n\n338\n00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:41.313\nNow the interesting thing, too,\nis that it's kind of hard to see, but\n\n339\n00:17:41.313 --> 00:17:43.340\nthis show desktop option, all right?\n\n340\n00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:46.470\nAnd I kind of like that one.\n\n341\n00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:50.320\nSo if I was to open, let's say,\nwe'll open a couple of things here.\n\n342\n00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.467\nAnd these are just arbitrary.\n\n343\n00:17:52.467 --> 00:17:56.710\nAnd we'll just keep this between you,\nmyself, and every social media that yes,\n\n344\n00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:01.032\nright here in the middle of an episode, I\ndecided to start playing Free Cell on you.\n\n345\n00:18:01.032 --> 00:18:04.620\n[LAUGH] But if we go back, and again,\nmy head's kind of covering this up.\n\n346\n00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.730\nAnd notice, and\nI wanna keep zoomed out there.\n\n347\n00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:10.500\nThis is something that is really cool.\n\n348\n00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.030\nThis is the translucencies.\n\n349\n00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:15.400\nThis is what's known as the Aero\ninterface and the glass interface.\n\n350\n00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.700\nNotice how I hover over that, and\nwhat it does is it shows me my desktop.\n\n351\n00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:21.730\nAnd that's great if you just\nneed a real quick peek.\n\n352\n00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:24.840\nWhere the heck did my recycle bin go?\n\n353\n00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:28.130\nIt's usually up there, but I can't see it.\n\n354\n00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:29.820\nIs it still on the desktop?\n\n355\n00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:33.030\nThere it is behind all\nof those open windows.\n\n356\n00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:34.410\n&gt;&gt; Why are we peering into PowerShell?\n\n357\n00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:36.736\nThat's PowerShell back there, right?\n\n358\n00:18:36.736 --> 00:18:39.780\nThat's the command line.\n&gt;&gt; That's the command line.\n\n359\n00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:43.800\nAnd the only reason we're doing that\nhere is that I just happen to have it\n\n360\n00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:44.900\npinned to the task bar,\n\n361\n00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:49.090\nwhich takes us into our next thing is\npinning things to the task bar, right?\n\n362\n00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:52.830\nCommand prompt by default\nisn't on the desktop.\n\n363\n00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:56.630\nAnd again, by default,\nyou would find it, and\n\n364\n00:18:56.630 --> 00:19:00.219\nin fact let me go ahead and\nlet me unpin from the task bar.\n\n365\n00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.700\nAnd we'll close some of\nthese other windows up,\n\n366\n00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.550\nshow you how you can also\nconfigure the task bar, all right?\n\n367\n00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:10.280\nNow notice that both\nremote desktop icons and\n\n368\n00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:13.500\nthe command prompt icon have disappeared.\n\n369\n00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:14.700\nWell, what are these icons?\n\n370\n00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:20.070\nThese are called quick-launch icons and\njust to the right, it's weird.\n\n371\n00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:22.705\nLeft side of your task bar just to\nthe right of your Start button.\n\n372\n00:19:22.705 --> 00:19:24.620\n[LAUGH] Boy, figure that one out.\n\n373\n00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:25.950\nYou'll have to slow that one down.\n\n374\n00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:27.770\nThese are your quick-launch icons and\n\n375\n00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:30.630\nthey give you that one-click\naccess to applications.\n\n376\n00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:32.710\nWell, what if I decide that hey,\n\n377\n00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:35.400\nI don't want to hit the,\nthis gets really lazy here.\n\n378\n00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.640\nIt almost sounds like, what if I don't\nwanna click the Start button one time and\n\n379\n00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.530\nthen have to click\nRemote Desktop the second?\n\n380\n00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:43.490\nThere's too many clicks, right?\n\n381\n00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:46.030\nWe don't have time to go\njimminy-clickets around here.\n\n382\n00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:49.290\nSo you can right-click on an icon just\nlike we pinned it to the Start menu.\n\n383\n00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:52.471\nYou can right-click and you can pin\nan application to the task bar.\n\n384\n00:19:52.471 --> 00:19:53.499\nAnd as you can see,\n\n385\n00:19:53.499 --> 00:19:56.980\nthat brings up the Remote Desktop\nicon down here on the task bar.\n\n386\n00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:01.210\nAnd now launch Remote Desktop rather\nthan try to find it in Accessories,\n\n387\n00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:03.570\nwhich honestly,\nreally isn't a that big of a deal for me.\n\n388\n00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:05.550\nBut again, it's all about productivity.\n\n389\n00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.470\nNotice that I can launch it\nright here from the task bar.\n\n390\n00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:10.460\nSame thing we said with command prompt,\nright?\n\n391\n00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.630\nFor instance, if I push the Start button.\n\n392\n00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:16.670\nWe type Charlie, Mike, Delta,\ncmd, into our search field.\n\n393\n00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:20.798\nNotice that the cmd.exe,\nwhich is your command prompt, shows up.\n\n394\n00:20:20.798 --> 00:20:23.760\nI can right-click and\nI can choose Send to task bar,\n\n395\n00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.620\njust like we did with the Start menu.\n\n396\n00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:29.955\nAnd now, sure enough,\nthose icons are on the task bar, and\n\n397\n00:20:29.955 --> 00:20:34.570\nI've got a quick launch icon that\nis ready to go for me, right?\n\n398\n00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:35.459\nSo great thing to have.\n\n399\n00:20:35.459 --> 00:20:40.625\nAnd again, remember your modifications\nthat you can make to the task bar as well.\n\n400\n00:20:40.625 --> 00:20:41.320\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n401\n00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:44.980\nswitch over here to Windows 10 because\nthere were some updates to the task bar\n\n402\n00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:49.190\nthat haven't been in there in previous\ngenerations of the operating system.\n\n403\n00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:52.420\nAnd you have what's known as a Task View.\n\n404\n00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.360\nAnd a Task View is great because\nwhat it does is it shows\n\n405\n00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.260\nyou the different applications that\nyou have in a side by side view.\n\n406\n00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:02.350\nIn fact, rather than just talk about it,\nlet me kinda open a couple of things here.\n\n407\n00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:04.965\nWe'll open our File Explorer.\n\n408\n00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:11.490\nLet's see, try to open something\nthat doesn't go full screen here.\n\n409\n00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:16.270\nWindows Accessory, we'll bring up Paint, I\ndon't think Paint's gonna go full screen.\n\n410\n00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:19.430\nOkay, so I got a lot of things on\nthe desktop, I say a lot of things,\n\n411\n00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:20.403\nonly three things.\n\n412\n00:21:20.403 --> 00:21:24.401\nBut if I choose the Task View down here,\njust to the left of the microphone,\n\n413\n00:21:24.401 --> 00:21:28.588\nwhich is, by the way, the search engine\nand Cortana, which is built into that\n\n414\n00:21:28.588 --> 00:21:31.520\nsearch functionality, too,\nand I choose Task View.\n\n415\n00:21:33.331 --> 00:21:34.282\nAll right.\n\n416\n00:21:36.276 --> 00:21:39.436\nAnd it is not doing that for me.\n\n417\n00:21:39.436 --> 00:21:40.865\nGive me one moment here.\n\n418\n00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:45.520\nI know what it is.\n\n419\n00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.030\nIt's seeing two monitors right now.\n\n420\n00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:49.590\nSo we've got the AJA plugged into one.\n\n421\n00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:50.350\nThere we go.\n\n422\n00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:51.310\nLet's try it one more time.\n\n423\n00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.460\nThere we go.\nIt was taking a little bit cuz we've got\n\n424\n00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:54.850\nmultiple monitors.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure.\n\n425\n00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:57.490\n&gt;&gt; But notice what it does, right?\n\n426\n00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:00.610\nIt basically separates all\nthe applications that you have open.\n\n427\n00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:04.250\nAnd if you want, you can actually, and\nmy head's kind of covering this one up,\n\n428\n00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:08.000\nI really like this, is you can\ncreate more than one active desktop.\n\n429\n00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.700\nSo I can choose New Desktop, right?\n\n430\n00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:11.773\nAnd if I select that,\n\n431\n00:22:11.773 --> 00:22:14.190\nnotice that I've got a clean desktop?\n&gt;&gt; Looks like it.\n\n432\n00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:15.726\n&gt;&gt; And if I go back to Task View,\n\n433\n00:22:15.726 --> 00:22:19.630\nI can choose the first desktop, and\nthen all my cluster comes back here.\n\n434\n00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:21.580\nSo you can actually make\nmore than one desktop and\n\n435\n00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:24.070\nthat's all there from the task bar.\n\n436\n00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:26.040\nSo another great thing to have.\n\n437\n00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:31.580\nAll right, so it looks like we\nare coming up a little bit.\n\n438\n00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:33.070\nWe got a couple more minutes.\n\n439\n00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:36.210\nI tell you what, I wanna do just a couple\nmore things and it does look like we'll go\n\n440\n00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:39.890\ninto a part two cuz I definitely\nwanna talk about profiles.\n\n441\n00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:43.270\nI'm leaving that for last because all of\nthese different configurations that we do,\n\n442\n00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:44.320\nwhere do they get stored?\n\n443\n00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.620\nThey get stored in the user profile.\n\n444\n00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:50.588\nBut let's go ahead, and some of\nthe other things that I want to kind\n\n445\n00:22:50.588 --> 00:22:54.693\nof talk about are shortcuts and\ntool bars, all right?\n\n446\n00:22:54.693 --> 00:22:57.550\nNow let's go back to\nour Windows 7 machine.\n\n447\n00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:01.850\nIf I right-click on my task bar,\nI can choose Properties, all right?\n\n448\n00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:06.270\nWhen we choose Properties,\nnotice that it's the Task Bar and\n\n449\n00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:07.500\nStart Menu Properties.\n\n450\n00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:12.400\nThe difference is, well,\nnow the Taskbar tab is the focus, right?\n\n451\n00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.110\nAll right, so\n\n452\n00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:18.110\nI have the ability to manipulate a little\nbit on how the task bar shows up.\n\n453\n00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:21.310\nFor instance, I could use small icons for\nthese quick launch icons.\n\n454\n00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:24.000\nIf you just happen to put,\nI don't know, 15 of them in there.\n\n455\n00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.810\nMaybe you need a little bit more space,\nyou can.\n\n456\n00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:29.730\nThe other thing is, too,\nI could autohide the task bar, too.\n\n457\n00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:32.570\nI could choose Apply, if I wanted to.\n\n458\n00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:34.350\nAll right, and that makes it disappear.\n\n459\n00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:37.615\nBe careful using that or be careful\nshowing end users how to do that because\n\n460\n00:23:37.615 --> 00:23:41.000\nthey forget where their task bar is and\nthey have no clue how to get back to it.\n\n461\n00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.681\nI will tell you from\na help desk standpoint,\n\n462\n00:23:43.681 --> 00:23:48.428\nit is really good to know where that\noption is and how to disable it.\n\n463\n00:23:48.428 --> 00:23:53.000\nBut I wanna talk about Toolbars,\nand that's on this third tab here.\n\n464\n00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.350\nNotice that I've got the ability,\nwell, in the days of tablet PC,\n\n465\n00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:59.040\nI could put a tablet PC\ninput panel on there, too.\n\n466\n00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.960\nAnd that's if you've got a stylus\nthat you're working with,\n\n467\n00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.234\na touchscreen interface.\n\n468\n00:24:03.234 --> 00:24:06.872\nBut we can also apparently have\nthe desktop on the desktop,\n\n469\n00:24:06.872 --> 00:24:10.173\nbut the one that I like is\nthis Address Tools bar.\n\n470\n00:24:10.173 --> 00:24:13.278\nYou can use links too, like your\nbookmarks could show up in your task bar.\n\n471\n00:24:13.278 --> 00:24:15.800\nBut notice over here on\nthe right hand side,\n\n472\n00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.534\nlower right hand corner of the screen,\nright?\n\n473\n00:24:18.534 --> 00:24:19.905\nWe have the address bar,\n\n474\n00:24:19.905 --> 00:24:23.248\nI could actually launch websites\nfrom here if you wanted to.\n\n475\n00:24:23.248 --> 00:24:28.245\nSo, for instance,\nI could type https:// we could\n\n476\n00:24:28.245 --> 00:24:32.242\ntype itpro.tv and we could hit enter, and\n\n477\n00:24:32.242 --> 00:24:37.366\nI don't know if this is on\nits default configuration.\n\n478\n00:24:37.366 --> 00:24:39.609\nSometimes you get a lot of\nthese pop ups that say,\n\n479\n00:24:39.609 --> 00:24:41.817\nare you sure you want to\nuse Internet Explorer?\n\n480\n00:24:41.817 --> 00:24:43.742\nDo you want to use recommended settings?\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right.\n\n481\n00:24:43.742 --> 00:24:44.662\n&gt;&gt; But it looks like we've got\n\n482\n00:24:44.662 --> 00:24:47.426\nit configured, and notice that it launched\nthat link up right from the toolbars.\n\n483\n00:24:47.426 --> 00:24:51.476\nSo the toolbars are nice to have as well\nas something that you can configure and\n\n484\n00:24:51.476 --> 00:24:55.148\nyou can put on your task bar, too.\n&gt;&gt; I didn't even recognize that guy.\n\n485\n00:24:55.148 --> 00:24:56.025\n&gt;&gt; That's absolutely\n\n486\n00:24:56.025 --> 00:24:56.894\ncorrect.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n487\n00:24:56.894 --> 00:24:58.071\n&gt;&gt; Now I will tell you,\n\n488\n00:24:58.071 --> 00:25:00.293\nyou can do this is Winsows 8.1 too.\n\n489\n00:25:00.293 --> 00:25:04.675\nIf we go over to WIndows 8.1, and\nwe right click on our task bar as well,\n\n490\n00:25:04.675 --> 00:25:06.102\nwe choose Properties.\n\n491\n00:25:06.102 --> 00:25:09.139\nNotice that we also have\nthe Toolbars option here.\n\n492\n00:25:09.139 --> 00:25:12.975\nYou can see Touch Keyboard, some of\nthe things that you can do, Links as well,\n\n493\n00:25:12.975 --> 00:25:13.630\nAddresses.\n\n494\n00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:18.037\nLinks, again, links will be things like\ntaking your Internet Explorer bookmarks.\n\n495\n00:25:18.037 --> 00:25:21.339\nAnd putting them there to where you have,\nagain, click access.\n\n496\n00:25:21.339 --> 00:25:25.788\nAgain, it's just more of that making it\neasier to work with the Windows operating\n\n497\n00:25:25.788 --> 00:25:26.310\nsystem.\n\n498\n00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:30.626\nI think the last thing that we'll go\nahead and put in this episode, again,\n\n499\n00:25:30.626 --> 00:25:34.342\nI know we are running a little\nbit short on time, are shortcuts.\n\n500\n00:25:34.342 --> 00:25:40.280\nAll right, now a shortcut is a great thing\nwhen you want to launch applications.\n\n501\n00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:44.282\nMaybe you want it on your desktop,\nmaybe you want a file or something.\n\n502\n00:25:44.282 --> 00:25:47.727\nMaybe you got a spreadsheet, if you will,\nthat you're always working on and\n\n503\n00:25:47.727 --> 00:25:50.012\nyou always want to have\naccess to it on the desktop.\n\n504\n00:25:50.012 --> 00:25:51.550\nWell, you can do that just by creating,\n\n505\n00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:53.285\nwe've shown you a couple\nof different ways.\n\n506\n00:25:53.285 --> 00:25:56.820\nYou could add to the task bar,\nand that's a one click icon, but\n\n507\n00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:00.915\nyou can actually create a shortcut\nthat shows you an icon on the desktop.\n\n508\n00:26:00.915 --> 00:26:02.443\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n509\n00:26:02.443 --> 00:26:05.292\nSo if we take, let's say, I tell you what,\n\n510\n00:26:05.292 --> 00:26:08.914\nI'm going to switch over to\nmy Windows 7 machine here.\n\n511\n00:26:08.914 --> 00:26:14.936\nJust temporarily, and\nwe will close down our website.\n\n512\n00:26:14.936 --> 00:26:21.419\nAll right, and what I want to do is I want\nto take this Remote Desktop Connection\n\n513\n00:26:21.419 --> 00:26:26.837\napplication, and I'm going to go ahead,\nin fact, click that.\n\n514\n00:26:26.837 --> 00:26:29.577\nThat's not what I meant to do,\nI'm going to right click on it.\n\n515\n00:26:29.577 --> 00:26:33.907\nAll right, and notice that I can\nchoose the Properties here and\n\n516\n00:26:33.907 --> 00:26:36.285\nI can actually create a shortcut.\n\n517\n00:26:36.285 --> 00:26:40.588\nI can say, hey, where do you want\nthis shortcut to be located?\n\n518\n00:26:40.588 --> 00:26:42.775\nWell, you can do this a few\ndifferent ways, right?\n\n519\n00:26:42.775 --> 00:26:47.744\nI can actually do this by right clicking,\nlike I showed you on the application,\n\n520\n00:26:47.744 --> 00:26:50.058\nbut this is a show about the desktop.\n\n521\n00:26:50.058 --> 00:26:51.817\nCan we do this from the desktop?\n\n522\n00:26:51.817 --> 00:26:53.003\nYes, you can, let me show you here.\n\n523\n00:26:53.003 --> 00:26:57.248\nJust right click on your desktop, choose\nNew, and instead of choosing a folder,\n\n524\n00:26:57.248 --> 00:26:58.880\nchoose Shortcut.\n&gt;&gt; Bing, bing, bing.\n\n525\n00:26:58.880 --> 00:26:59.635\n&gt;&gt; All right, and\n\n526\n00:26:59.635 --> 00:27:03.307\nit's going to ask you where you want,\nwhere is this application located?\n\n527\n00:27:03.307 --> 00:27:08.785\nAll right, so for me, I want to say that\n\n528\n00:27:08.785 --> 00:27:14.433\nI'm going to do Local Disk C, Windows.\n\n529\n00:27:18.071 --> 00:27:20.307\nSystem32, and we'll choose OK,\n\n530\n00:27:20.307 --> 00:27:24.353\nand I've got to complete that\nbecause I want to say it's Windows.\n\n531\n00:27:24.353 --> 00:27:26.961\nI'll try to remember\nif I can remember what\n\n532\n00:27:26.961 --> 00:27:29.359\nthe executable here is live on camera.\n\n533\n00:27:29.359 --> 00:27:32.609\nmstsc, there it is, that’s our executable.\n\n534\n00:27:32.609 --> 00:27:35.251\nIt’s leftover from the days when\nremote desktop used to be called\n\n535\n00:27:35.251 --> 00:27:38.531\nMicrosoft's terminal services client.\n&gt;&gt; Back in the days, the old days.\n\n536\n00:27:38.531 --> 00:27:41.017\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that’s right, back in our days,\n\n537\n00:27:41.017 --> 00:27:44.010\nwhen we had to walk to school\nin the snow both ways.\n\n538\n00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:48.218\nAll right, so we’ll go ahead and\nselect that and then basically what.\n\n539\n00:27:48.218 --> 00:27:50.853\nThat's why I say, sometimes, this can be a\nlittle tricky if you do it from a desktop.\n\n540\n00:27:50.853 --> 00:27:53.298\nBecause you have to know where\nthe application is located.\n\n541\n00:27:53.298 --> 00:27:55.071\nYou can also do it from the Start menu.\n\n542\n00:27:55.071 --> 00:27:56.727\nAnd I know where\nthe application is located,\n\n543\n00:27:56.727 --> 00:27:58.915\nbecause the icon is showing me\nthat it's on the Start menu.\n\n544\n00:27:58.915 --> 00:28:02.617\nSo, a couple of different ways,\nand we can choose Next, and\n\n545\n00:28:02.617 --> 00:28:05.892\ntype a friendly name,\ntype a name for this shortcut.\n\n546\n00:28:05.892 --> 00:28:09.638\nWell, some people might not know what\nmstsc, that it actually is the remnants\n\n547\n00:28:09.638 --> 00:28:12.474\nfrom Microsoft's terminal services client.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n548\n00:28:12.474 --> 00:28:13.222\n&gt;&gt; So we might,\n\n549\n00:28:13.222 --> 00:28:16.421\nthey're not going to know\nwhat Remote D is apparently.\n\n550\n00:28:16.421 --> 00:28:20.879\n[LAUGH] Remote Desktop Connection,\nall right,\n\n551\n00:28:20.879 --> 00:28:25.677\nand here we'll go ahead and\nwe'll choose Finish.\n\n552\n00:28:28.406 --> 00:28:32.302\nAll right, and there is our icon\nright there on the desktop.\n\n553\n00:28:32.302 --> 00:28:34.387\nAnd when I launch that, sure enough,\n\n554\n00:28:34.387 --> 00:28:37.915\nit launches Remote Desktop Connection\nright from our desktop.\n\n555\n00:28:37.915 --> 00:28:42.577\nNow again, these are applications that you\ncan find scrolling through the Start menu,\n\n556\n00:28:42.577 --> 00:28:44.343\nyou can find them just that easy.\n\n557\n00:28:44.343 --> 00:28:47.274\nYou can pin them to the Start menu,\nyou can pin them to the task bar, but\n\n558\n00:28:47.274 --> 00:28:49.387\nyou can also pin them as\na shortcut to the desktop.\n\n559\n00:28:49.387 --> 00:28:51.870\nThese are some of the settings\nthat I'd definitely be aware of.\n\n560\n00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:56.389\nBut we do have to talk about notifications\nand also where these collection of\n\n561\n00:28:56.389 --> 00:29:00.142\nsettings that affect you as the user,\nwhere they're stored.\n\n562\n00:29:00.142 --> 00:29:02.244\nBut we don't have enough time,\nI think, in this episode.\n\n563\n00:29:02.244 --> 00:29:05.750\nWe're going to have to come back in a part\ntwo, but we'll talk about profiles.\n\n564\n00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:07.402\n&gt;&gt; Windows OS Fundamentals,\n\n565\n00:29:07.402 --> 00:29:10.497\nconfiguring desktop settings,\npart two coming.\n\n566\n00:29:10.497 --> 00:29:13.680\nYou've just seen part one,\nWes, fantastic job as usual.\n\n567\n00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.484\nAnd by the way,\nmake sure you watch everything inside of\n\n568\n00:29:16.484 --> 00:29:19.894\nthe Windows OS Fundamentals series,\nyou'll be very glad you did.\n\n569\n00:29:19.894 --> 00:29:23.453\nAnd in that library that we have,\nthat we call the course library,\n\n570\n00:29:23.453 --> 00:29:27.154\nthere's thousands of videos there\ndesigned to help you go further.\n\n571\n00:29:27.154 --> 00:29:30.997\nSo check those out, too, and\ntell everybody you know about ITPRO.TV,\n\n572\n00:29:30.997 -->

00:00:13.085\n&gt;&gt; Your watching ITPRO.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello again, and\n\n4\n00:00:13.085 --> 00:00:17.192\nthank you for choosing ITPRO.TV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:17.192 --> 00:00:21.490\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on Windows OS Fundamentals.\n\n6\n00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.510\nWe're configuring desktop settings Part 2,\nmake sure you see Part 1,\n\n7\n00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.510\nyou'll be glad you did.\n\n8\n00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.180\nAnd Wes Bryan is giving us all\nthe information that's fit to print,\n\n9\n00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.380\nWes good to see you sir.\n&gt;&gt; Hey how are you doing Zach,\n\n10\n00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.090\nthanks for having me here as\nalways it's great to be back.\n\n11\n00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.872\nWe're moving into a Part 2.\n\n12\n00:00:36.872 --> 00:00:41.370\nJust like Zach said, we talked about\nhe configuration of your desktop.\n\n13\n00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.190\nAnd in the first episode we\ntalked about things like display\n\n14\n00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.220\nsettings we've shown you\nhow to create a shortcut.\n\n15\n00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.310\nThings like your taskbar and\nyour start menu.\n\n16\n00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.930\nWell, depending on which\nversion of Windows\n\n17\n00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.430\nit is that you're using, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n18\n00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.220\nRight.\n&gt;&gt; Because we do have Windows 7 that has\n\n19\n00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.870\nthe Start menu.\n\n20\n00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.835\nAnd then of course Windows 8.1,\nit disappears and we get the modern UI.\n\n21\n00:01:01.835 --> 00:01:05.305\nAnd then, Windows 10 brings it back.\n\n22\n00:01:05.305 --> 00:01:08.625\nSo we talked about the Start menu,\nwe talked about taskbar.\n\n23\n00:01:08.625 --> 00:01:10.355\nA lot of different things, toolbars.\n\n24\n00:01:10.355 --> 00:01:14.805\nOne of the things that I didn't mention\nin the first one is notifications.\n\n25\n00:01:14.805 --> 00:01:17.945\nWhen it comes to notifications,\nit really depends on\n\n26\n00:01:17.945 --> 00:01:20.785\nwhat type of notifications it\nis that we're talking about.\n\n27\n00:01:20.785 --> 00:01:22.760\nAre they security notifications?\n\n28\n00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.375\nIf they're security related\nwhere do we find and\n\n29\n00:01:25.375 --> 00:01:28.512\nfollow up with some of those\nnotifications it can give us.\n\n30\n00:01:28.512 --> 00:01:32.340\nAs well as just general\nnotifications that we just need to\n\n31\n00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.270\nbe aware of about the goings\non of our computers.\n\n32\n00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.700\nSo let's go ahead and let's dive in\na little bit to notifications areas.\n\n33\n00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.590\nAnd I'm gonna jump right in\nto our Windows 10 machine.\n\n34\n00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.110\nOver here in the lower right hand portion\nof our screen kind of hard to see\n\n35\n00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.060\nwe have this little flag right?\n\n36\n00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.030\nAnd I don't know Zach can\nyou see that flag right\n\n37\n00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.070\nthere?\n&gt;&gt; I can.\n\n38\n00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.210\n&gt;&gt; That flag if we hover to\n\n39\n00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.243\ndiscover you're gonna notice is basically\nwhat is known as the Action Center.\n\n40\n00:01:56.243 --> 00:02:01.870\nAnd then if I click this, what you'll\nsee is that it gives me a message.\n\n41\n00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.690\nAnd give me this little thought bubble\nwhen I click on it and it says hey,\n\n42\n00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:05.960\nyou need to set a backup.\n\n43\n00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.610\nWe'll talk about backup and\nrecovery in another episode, but\n\n44\n00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.060\nit's very important and it's one of\nthe things that they're notifying you hey,\n\n45\n00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.324\nyou need to take care of this.\n\n46\n00:02:13.324 --> 00:02:16.210\nNow, it could be other things\nthat might cause problems.\n\n47\n00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.030\nLet me show you another thing.\n\n48\n00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.910\nNow the backup really\nisn't security related,\n\n49\n00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.790\nI guess you could say security related\nwhen we talk about something known as\n\n50\n00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.890\nthe CIA triad confidentiality,\nintegrity and availability.\n\n51\n00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.914\nWe wanna make sure that our data is\navailable, so in that aspect yeah,\n\n52\n00:02:30.914 --> 00:02:32.369\nthis could be security related.\n\n53\n00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:35.571\nBut notification areas don't just have\nto be general maintenance issues,\n\n54\n00:02:35.571 --> 00:02:37.430\nthey could be security notifications too.\n\n55\n00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.056\nLet me show you what I mean here, so if I\ndive down into my Control Panel by pushing\n\n56\n00:02:42.056 --> 00:02:45.878\nthe Start button, and\nwe'll look at the Windows Firewall here.\n\n57\n00:02:45.878 --> 00:02:49.353\nAnd I'll just leave this in\nthe large icons view, and\n\n58\n00:02:49.353 --> 00:02:51.850\nwe'll get into the firewall.\n\n59\n00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.043\nNow I want you to notice something here,\nnotice that the firewall is on,\n\n60\n00:02:56.043 --> 00:02:57.983\nwe can see that we are connected.\n\n61\n00:02:57.983 --> 00:03:02.467\nBut if I decide that I'm going to do\nsomething that we really shouldn't do,\n\n62\n00:03:02.467 --> 00:03:06.603\nunless you're just testing periodically\nis we're gonna go ahead and\n\n63\n00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:08.610\nturn off the firewall.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n64\n00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.170\n&gt;&gt; All right and we're gonna choose OK.\n\n65\n00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.380\nNow I want you to notice something.\n\n66\n00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.410\nNotice how the thought bubble comes up\nright away and my head's kind of covering\n\n67\n00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.250\nthat up but notice that little\nnotification that I just got.\n\n68\n00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.930\nSo it doesn't necessarily have\nto be just maintenance settings.\n\n69\n00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.390\nOr it could be security related.\n\n70\n00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.420\nSo how do we solve the issue?\n\n71\n00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.880\nYou just click on it, and well, you turn\non the firewall, you do what it says.\n\n72\n00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.611\nClick the link, right?\n\n73\n00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:34.359\nAnd now you'll notice that, hey,\nthat notification was very,\n\n74\n00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.120\nvery good to let me know that a core\nsecurity setting was changed.\n\n75\n00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.170\nSo notifications are very, very important.\n\n76\n00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.830\nHowever, depending on how intrusive\nthey are sometimes notifications\n\n77\n00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.590\ncan get a little intrusive for people.\n\n78\n00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.630\nSo you might see that they\nchange notification settings.\n\n79\n00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.690\nSo if I change a notification setting what\nI'm saying here is, hey you know what?\n\n80\n00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.720\nNotify me or don't notify me.\n\n81\n00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.650\nNotify me when firewall blocks in\nyour program or I could uncheck this.\n\n82\n00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.140\nNow if I uncheck this that\nis an application runs\n\n83\n00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.400\nit's not going to let me know\nthat something new was running\n\n84\n00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.020\nmaking changes to security setting\nthe core functionality operating system.\n\n85\n00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.090\nNow, I will say that for\nsome people that's good.\n\n86\n00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.710\nAs long as it's doing its job,\njust don't notify me.\n\n87\n00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:22.670\nI don't want the notifications.\n\n88\n00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.640\nHowever, I'm of the mindset,\nI'm completely different than that.\n\n89\n00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.270\nI wanna know, right?\n\n90\n00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.540\nBecause I wanna know when\nsomething goes to execute\n\n91\n00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.510\nthat isn't in your list of approved apps.\n\n92\n00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.790\nCoz I need to find out, is that a virus?\n\n93\n00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.510\nIs that malware?\n\n94\n00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:39.510\nWhat's that program?\n\n95\n00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.180\nAnd if you are not aware because\nyou disabled the notification then\n\n96\n00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.950\nyou might not be aware that maybe there is\nsome kind of security vulnerability and\n\n97\n00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.590\nyou have that running on\nyour computer now and\n\n98\n00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.700\nyou have turned off your notifications and\nyou no longer aware of it.\n\n99\n00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.980\nSo again notifications are important.\n\n100\n00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.860\nNow, that's just a little bit about\nwhat it looks like in Windows 7.\n\n101\n00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.040\nIn Windows 8 and 8.1, you'll see that you\nalso have your Action Center down here.\n\n102\n00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.180\nAnd again, if we were to click this,\nnotice that it should let us know,\n\n103\n00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.740\nif I right-click on it that I can\nessentially open the Action Center.\n\n104\n00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.000\nAnd you can see what they talk about.\n\n105\n00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.950\nNotice it says you can use\nthe Action Center to review\n\n106\n00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.760\nrecent messages about\nyour computer status.\n\n107\n00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.310\nAnd if we open the Action Center,\nyou will see that we get a lot of\n\n108\n00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.390\ninformation based on, well like I said,\nsecurity and maintenance.\n\n109\n00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.880\nSo here's our security that we\ncould potentially get a warning or\n\n110\n00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.090\na notification on.\n\n111\n00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.050\nUser Account Control as well, we'll talk\nabout the User Account Control coming up\n\n112\n00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.600\nin an episode that we'll shoot where\nwe'll talk about User Account Control and\n\n113\n00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.650\nsome of the ways you can configure it.\n\n114\n00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.460\nBut can also things like for\ninstance maintenance.\n\n115\n00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.400\nNow the maintenance area down\nhere in the Action Center\n\n116\n00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.480\nis where you can find things\nlike the reliability monitor.\n\n117\n00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.950\nIn other episodes, we talked\nabout the performance monitor and\n\n118\n00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:07.430\nthe resource monitor, where we're\nviewing the statistical performance or\n\n119\n00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.110\nthe consumption of a resource,\nif it's the resource monitor.\n\n120\n00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.972\nWell, we also have\nthe reliability monitor too.\n\n121\n00:06:13.972 --> 00:06:20.080\nAnd I can come into the Action Center\nhere and I can view reliability history.\n\n122\n00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.170\nAnd that's a great thing, to be notified\nif you have some kind of even that\n\n123\n00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.800\nhappens on your machine and\nto be aware of it.\n\n124\n00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.820\nSo for instance,\nI could see informational level events and\n\n125\n00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.360\nit's notifying me about it and saying hey,\nthere was a successful Windows update.\n\n126\n00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.240\nAnd if I need to,\n\n127\n00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.759\nI can always view the technical details.\n&gt;&gt; So Wes,\n\n128\n00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:40.710\nis this just in the 8?\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm glad you asked.\n\n129\n00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:46.340\nThe reliability monitor's been around\nsince Vista, it was introduced in Vista.\n\n130\n00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.620\nIt was continued in Windows 7,\nWindows 8 and 8.1, so yes,\n\n131\n00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:55.122\nit is something that has been in your\noperating system now for a while.\n\n132\n00:06:55.122 --> 00:07:02.580\nAnd again that's your Action Center as\nit appears in Windows 7, 8 and 8.1.\n\n133\n00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:07.900\nHowever, when we switch over to\nWindows 10, it completely changes.\n\n134\n00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.770\nNow, I say completely changes and that's\nbecause, remember we've been telling you\n\n135\n00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.720\nthere's a couple of different\ninterfaces that they're supporting.\n\n136\n00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.000\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n137\n00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.170\nSo in lower right hand\nportion of my screen here.\n\n138\n00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:25.070\nYou will see that if I kind of hover\nover here no new notifications.\n\n139\n00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.870\nSo this is actually the Action Center now.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n140\n00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.680\n&gt;&gt; And the action center is a pane for us.\n\n141\n00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.560\nRight now when I say a pane I don't mean\na pain in the neck what I mean is a pane\n\n142\n00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.690\nslides out and it lets me know,\n\n143\n00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.690\nhey are there things that I need\nto be aware of on my computer?\n\n144\n00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:45.583\nSo let me see we can generate, sometimes\nWindows like to protect itself, so\n\n145\n00:07:45.583 --> 00:07:50.483\nsometimes you'll see that it might be\na little difficult to break Windows.\n\n146\n00:07:50.483 --> 00:07:53.480\nNow I could do that with the best of them,\nbut\n\n147\n00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.965\nlet's see here if I can\nstop the firewall service.\n\n148\n00:07:56.965 --> 00:07:59.665\nSometimes you'll see that\nit's a little bit harder to\n\n149\n00:07:59.665 --> 00:08:02.375\nshut down security [LAUGH]\ninside of your Windows 10.\n\n150\n00:08:02.375 --> 00:08:05.337\nWhich is a good thing it's\ncertainly not a bad thing.\n\n151\n00:08:05.337 --> 00:08:09.551\nBut let's see here if we can\nfind Windows there we go, so\n\n152\n00:08:09.551 --> 00:08:13.870\nWindows Defender Firewall Service and\nlook at there.\n\n153\n00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.310\nThey won't even let you stop it any more.\n\n154\n00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.500\nIt used to be,\nyou could actually disable it.\n\n155\n00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.370\nI'm trying to throw some warnings here.\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n156\n00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:22.340\n&gt;&gt; But you can not,\n\n157\n00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.150\nall of these services now that\nthey don't let you stop them,\n\n158\n00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.545\nthey used to let you stop them and\nyou can disable the Firewall service.\n\n159\n00:08:28.545 --> 00:08:31.370\nBut fortunately, we can't do that.\n\n160\n00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:34.440\nSo if we go back to that\nnotification area down the lower\n\n161\n00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.780\nright hand corner of our screen.\n\n162\n00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.740\nWe bring out the Action Center here.\n\n163\n00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:42.020\nWe can actually, if we want,\nwe can go to All Settings.\n\n164\n00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.310\nAnd then we can get into\nthe Windows settings interface.\n\n165\n00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:46.200\nAnd again, like we've been saying,\ntwo different interfaces.\n\n166\n00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.430\nA little bit different than what we've\nseen in the earlier versions of Windows.\n\n167\n00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:51.510\nBut from here I can go into System.\n\n168\n00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:57.650\nAnd then notice that we have\nNotifications and actions right here.\n\n169\n00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:01.790\nAnd if I choose Notifications and\nactions, this is what's going to allow\n\n170\n00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:04.718\nme to include little tiles if you will or\nquick actions.\n\n171\n00:09:04.718 --> 00:09:06.435\nNow those quick actions-\n&gt;&gt; Ooh.\n\n172\n00:09:06.435 --> 00:09:08.738\n&gt;&gt; Again are directly related to down here\n\n173\n00:09:08.738 --> 00:09:11.620\nin the lower right hand\ncorner of my screen.\n\n174\n00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.900\nThe little tiles that we see here.\n\n175\n00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:18.100\nThey call them quick icons and again\nWindows 8, 8.1, we were calling them tile.\n\n176\n00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:22.040\nSo I'm kind of using the remnants\nof the old naming convention.\n\n177\n00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:27.390\nBut notice that if I want,\nwe can again press and hold Quick actions.\n\n178\n00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:30.010\nYou can drag them,\nyou can rearrange them if you will.\n\n179\n00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:34.400\nAnd these are the ones that are currently\nincluded, if I so choose, but\n\n180\n00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.250\nI can add or remove these.\n\n181\n00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:39.510\nNoticed that we've got all\nof these different ones.\n\n182\n00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:42.770\nAll settings, I like to have all settings\non there and the reason I say that is just\n\n183\n00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:46.160\nbecause, I like to get to\nthe window settings very easily.\n\n184\n00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.670\nThere's a couple different\nways that you can do it, but\n\n185\n00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.860\nit's nice having that\nright on your screen.\n\n186\n00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.760\nNetwork, I want the network right\nnow you might not want the network.\n\n187\n00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.730\nSo if you don't you just turn it off and\n\n188\n00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:02.080\nwhat you'll see is that you're no longer\nhave, let me go ahead expand this out.\n\n189\n00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.330\nNetwork is gone.\n\n190\n00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.520\nAnd that's the other thing to keep in\nmind to as that they are collapsed with\n\n191\n00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.350\neach other.\n\n192\n00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.980\nSo, you might say we'll\nwait a second list,\n\n193\n00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.920\nyou're telling us that I see all of these.\n\n194\n00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.519\nBut I don't see all of them are in the\nlist down here, well that's because again,\n\n195\n00:10:16.519 --> 00:10:17.888\nyou're gonna have to expand.\n\n196\n00:10:17.888 --> 00:10:21.350\nSo if we can show again that\nAction Center right there.\n\n197\n00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.720\nNotice that I can expand these out and\n\n198\n00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.630\nit shows the additional\nquick actions that you have.\n\n199\n00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:29.530\nAnd if I turn that back on,\nthat network back on and\n\n200\n00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:34.400\nI go back to the Action Center, one of\nthe things that you should notice here,\n\n201\n00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.790\nis that Network has now back in the list.\n\n202\n00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:41.920\nBut notice that I can't grab\nonto these and move them, right?\n\n203\n00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:46.460\nIt's my job to,\nin the notifications settings,\n\n204\n00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.740\nthis dictates which ones\nshow up in the top row.\n\n205\n00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:54.840\nSo if I want network to be in the top row,\nI will put that up here.\n\n206\n00:10:54.840 --> 00:11:01.010\nMaybe I want Bluetooth to be up here\nas well, and maybe I want All Settings.\n\n207\n00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:05.910\nAnd who knows, and maybe I want\nAll Settings to be out to the side.\n\n208\n00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:09.490\nMaybe it's a work computer,\nso I have VPN up there too.\n\n209\n00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:12.470\nAnd then once that's applied we\ncome back to the notification area.\n\n210\n00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.060\nNotice how it's switched everything up.\n\n211\n00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:19.250\nSo when I collapse this, whatever is\nin that top row is just what I want.\n\n212\n00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:21.020\nNot just the defaults.\n\n213\n00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:24.880\nAnd you could some different\nnotifications that we can get too.\n\n214\n00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.050\nNotice get notifications from apps and\nother senders.\n\n215\n00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:31.220\nHowever, one of the things that I will\ntell you is that when you turn some of\n\n216\n00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:35.734\nthese notifications off, especially\nwhen it's like the advertisements that\n\n217\n00:11:35.734 --> 00:11:37.846\nare kinda built into Windows today.\n\n218\n00:11:40.234 --> 00:11:43.286\nIt doesn't necessarily mean that they're\ngonna give you less advertisements,\n\n219\n00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:44.800\nit's part of that Windows as a service.\n\n220\n00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.340\nIt's gonna just be something that\nis built into the operating system.\n\n221\n00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.380\nSo, these are some of the things that\nyou can do, and again like I said,\n\n222\n00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.200\nmy head kinda covered it up here.\n\n223\n00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:59.710\nIf you need to find out those actions,\nthis is the new Action Center.\n\n224\n00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:02.760\nAnd scrolling down,\nhere's kind of what I was saying.\n\n225\n00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.860\nIt talks about selecting\na sender to see more settings.\n\n226\n00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.860\nSome senders might also have\ntheir own notification settings.\n\n227\n00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:13.390\nSo when I say that, keep in mind\nthat sometimes just manipulating\n\n228\n00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:19.390\nthe notifications, how often they\nnotify you doesn't necessarily mean\n\n229\n00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:24.880\nthat in somebody senders that is going to\nreduce the amount notifications you get.\n\n230\n00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:29.958\nAgain just kind of be aware of\nwhere you see those notifications.\n\n231\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:33.430\nIn the older operating systems\nif it isn't windows firewall\n\n232\n00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:35.660\nit is going to be Action Center.\n\n233\n00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:38.060\nAnd you can actually\nsee the Action Center,\n\n234\n00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:42.370\nthe notification with the Windows\nfirewall kind of blended together.\n\n235\n00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:47.260\nIn Windows 10 however, remember that\nyou're Action Center is this little pane,\n\n236\n00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.609\nthat kinda slides in\nfrom the right hand side.\n\n237\n00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.760\nNow that leads us back our next concept.\n\n238\n00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.480\nWe've been talking about\nall these various settings.\n\n239\n00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:00.110\nWe've been talking about desktop settings,\nwe've been talking about notifications,\n\n240\n00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:03.920\nconfiguring our task bar,\nconfiguring out start menu.\n\n241\n00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.650\nAll these different settings and\nthe question is,\n\n242\n00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:10.190\nwhen it comes to those settings,\nwhere do those settings get stored?\n\n243\n00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:16.280\nWell, those settings get stored\nin a collection of directories,\n\n244\n00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:21.600\nif you will, and a specific location\ninside of the Windows registry.\n\n245\n00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.950\nAnd that is something\nknown as a user profile.\n\n246\n00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:28.120\nAnd the user profiles are very,\nvery important Important to\n\n247\n00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.480\nkind of understand what\nthe structure of a user profile is.\n\n248\n00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.840\nI got a little bit of a diagram here,\nlet's go in and check out my diagram.\n\n249\n00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:41.825\nWhen we look at a profile,\nagain a profile is a collection of\n\n250\n00:13:41.825 --> 00:13:48.150\nuser-specific directories that\neach user has for themselves.\n\n251\n00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:53.569\nAnd if we look at the tree,\nthe file hierarchy, this is in C:\\users.\n\n252\n00:13:53.569 --> 00:13:57.245\nBackslash whatever the username is.\n\n253\n00:13:57.245 --> 00:14:00.506\nNow you have some other user\nprofiles that are in here as well,\n\n254\n00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:02.586\nyou have what's known as the default.\n\n255\n00:14:02.586 --> 00:14:04.584\nNow I've kind of highlighted this or\n\n256\n00:14:04.584 --> 00:14:08.135\na little bit different of a color\nit's actually a hidden folder.\n\n257\n00:14:08.135 --> 00:14:12.622\nRemember in other episodes we talked about\nfolder options and how you can see those\n\n258\n00:14:12.622 --> 00:14:16.341\nhidden locations, well,\ndefault is actually a hidden location.\n\n259\n00:14:16.341 --> 00:14:21.239\nAnd that's because when a user is first\nconfigure before they ever log on to\n\n260\n00:14:21.239 --> 00:14:24.830\nthe machine,\nthey don't have one of these profiles.\n\n261\n00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.510\nLet's say user wants the name, right?\n\n262\n00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:30.708\nSo what happens is the very first time,\n\n263\n00:14:30.708 --> 00:14:34.220\nyou're creating a user account, the very\nfirst time when that user logs on,\n\n264\n00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:38.230\nwhat happens is this default\nprofile is like template.\n\n265\n00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:42.900\nIt is a copy of all of those\ndirectories that the user is going to\n\n266\n00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.830\nuse after they log on.\n\n267\n00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:49.180\nSo what happens is the default is copied,\nand\n\n268\n00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:54.090\nthen the user name is going to\nbe basically applied to it.\n\n269\n00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.720\nSo it becomes a copy of\nthe default profile,\n\n270\n00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:01.180\nand every user has one\nthat logs onto a machine.\n\n271\n00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:02.370\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n272\n00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:07.250\nSo we're gonna go ahead and we're\ngonna create on our Windows 7 machine.\n\n273\n00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:10.720\nLet's do this, let's go ahead and\nlets create Zach,\n\n274\n00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.670\nhis own account on this Windows 7 machine-\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n275\n00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:14.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll\n\n276\n00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.440\nget Zach in the game here too.\n\n277\n00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.520\nSo what we're gonna do is we're gonna\ngo ahead and we're gonna right-click\n\n278\n00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.460\non Computer off of the Start menu and\nwe're gonna choose Properties.\n\n279\n00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:27.765\nAnd we're gonna go to\nControl Panel &gt; System and\n\n280\n00:15:27.765 --> 00:15:31.030\nSecurity &gt; Administrative Tools.\n\n281\n00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:34.210\nWe've been here before,\nand Computer Management.\n\n282\n00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.770\nNow, instead of computer management and\n\n283\n00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:41.260\nyou know there was a actually\nan easy way I could have done this.\n\n284\n00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.400\nI went the long way around just to get\nyou familiar with the operating system.\n\n285\n00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.540\nLet me go and close this down.\n\n286\n00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.008\nI could actually just go ahead and\npush Start.\n\n287\n00:15:48.008 --> 00:15:50.978\nI could right click on computer and\nI can choose Manage,\n\n288\n00:15:50.978 --> 00:15:52.538\nit brings up Computer Management.\n\n289\n00:15:52.538 --> 00:15:55.903\nSo what do you say we go ahead and\nwe test this theory?\n\n290\n00:15:55.903 --> 00:16:00.166\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna create in local users and\n\n291\n00:16:00.166 --> 00:16:04.434\ngroups here,\nI'm gonna create a user By right clicking.\n\n292\n00:16:04.434 --> 00:16:08.400\nWe'll call the user account,\nkeep it simple, we'll call it Zach.\n\n293\n00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:14.450\nAll right, and we'll give Zach\na super secret Microsoft password.\n\n294\n00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:17.600\nAnd you know what, we're gonna say he\ndoesn't have to change his password.\n\n295\n00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:21.740\nAnd we'll just say his\npassword never expires.\n\n296\n00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:25.840\nSo we'll go ahead and just set up a basic\naccount for demonstration purposes only.\n\n297\n00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:29.920\nAll right, so Zach is a user on\nthis machine now, all right?\n\n298\n00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:35.400\nNow if what I said is true, then that\nmeans Zach should have a profile,\n\n299\n00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:36.230\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n300\n00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:37.710\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's go check that out.\n\n301\n00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:39.340\nLet's test that theory, all right?\n\n302\n00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:41.440\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna open our,\n\n303\n00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.800\nand since we're on Windows 7 it's\ncalled Windows Explorer, still.\n\n304\n00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.350\nWe're gonna open our Windows Explorer,\nall right?\n\n305\n00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:49.400\nAnd then, over on the navigation pane,\n\n306\n00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.530\nwe're actually going to\nexpand out Local Disk C.\n\n307\n00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:55.170\nRemember our path, local disc C:\\Users.\n\n308\n00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:58.420\nSo we're gonna go to the Users directory,\nall right?\n\n309\n00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:04.540\nAnd when I look at the User's directory\nup here, I don't see a profile for Zach.\n\n310\n00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:05.040\nWhy?\n\n311\n00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:07.310\nRemember what I said.\n\n312\n00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:09.840\nI created the account for Zach.\n\n313\n00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.786\nZach hasn't logged on to the machine.\n\n314\n00:17:11.786 --> 00:17:15.780\nIt's at logon that the profile\nis gonna be created and\n\n315\n00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:17.550\nit's gonna be created out of this.\n\n316\n00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:20.500\nAnd we can go ahead and use our folder and\nsearch options that we learned in another\n\n317\n00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:24.955\nepisode and we'll actually show\nthose hidden folders and files.\n\n318\n00:17:24.955 --> 00:17:28.661\nThere is that little default, right?\n&gt;&gt; In that default folder that\n\n319\n00:17:28.661 --> 00:17:31.510\nI was telling you,\nthat's typically hidden from view.\n\n320\n00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:37.060\nAnd if I double click on this,\nyou can see these are those locations.\n\n321\n00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.965\nNow, what is this?\n\n322\n00:17:38.965 --> 00:17:41.430\nNTUSER.DAT file, all right.\n\n323\n00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:44.920\nWell, these are the directories we'll\nget down to the NTUSER.DAT file\n\n324\n00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:45.940\nhere in a second.\n\n325\n00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:51.530\nThese are the directories that are going\nto be copied over to the user profile.\n\n326\n00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:53.720\nAnd Zach's name is going\nto be applied to it.\n\n327\n00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:54.830\nAll right, now.\n\n328\n00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:56.980\nWhat is NTUSER.DAT?\n\n329\n00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:00.580\nAll right,\nNTUSER.DAT is actually a registry file.\n\n330\n00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.780\nSo your registry is actually made\nup of a few different files and\n\n331\n00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:07.290\nwe can actually see those locations.\n\n332\n00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:11.810\nIf we get down in here into Windows and\nlet's see here.\n\n333\n00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:15.930\nWe'll get into System\n32 down here somewhere.\n\n334\n00:18:19.577 --> 00:18:25.209\nAll right, and drivers, and then etc,\noop and that is not the location,\n\n335\n00:18:25.209 --> 00:18:29.961\nconfig, okay, let's get in the right one,\nwrong directory,\n\n336\n00:18:29.961 --> 00:18:35.251\nI was looking at the host file,\nhow about we get into the config folder?\n\n337\n00:18:35.251 --> 00:18:37.450\nAnd it's gonna tell me I\ndon't have permission.\n\n338\n00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:41.350\nThis is a folder in a directory that\nshould stay out of your mind for\n\n339\n00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:45.730\na good reason just because this is where\nyour registry is stored, all right?\n\n340\n00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:48.599\nAnd your registry files,\nthese are all of your registry\n\n341\n00:18:48.599 --> 00:18:50.000\nfiles, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n342\n00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.540\nAll right, and we have a,\nlet's see, components default,\n\n343\n00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.050\nSAM, security software and systems.\n\n344\n00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:59.430\nSAM just happens to be\nthe Security Accounts Management file.\n\n345\n00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:01.470\nWhen I do a local logon, right?\n\n346\n00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:02.900\nIt looks for your user names and\n\n347\n00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.540\nyour passwords in that security\naccounts manager file.\n\n348\n00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:09.910\nWell, that makes up your registry,\nminus one file.\n\n349\n00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:15.004\nAnd that one file that we're\ntalking about is the NTUSER.DAT.\n\n350\n00:19:15.004 --> 00:19:18.284\nSee, all those other files are used\ncollectively by the system.\n\n351\n00:19:18.284 --> 00:19:21.012\nAll right, they store configuration data.\n\n352\n00:19:21.012 --> 00:19:24.752\nHow is the operating system configured\nto boot, what services are gonna start,\n\n353\n00:19:24.752 --> 00:19:27.070\nwhat drivers are going to load, right?\n\n354\n00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:29.925\nWhat file associations are there?\n\n355\n00:19:29.925 --> 00:19:33.859\nWhen we make some of the changes that\nwe've shown you here in the desktop\n\n356\n00:19:33.859 --> 00:19:38.383\nsettings, when we make changes to our tool\nbar, to our task bar, to the desktop,\n\n357\n00:19:38.383 --> 00:19:41.991\nchanging the background,\nputting a shortcut up on the desktop,\n\n358\n00:19:41.991 --> 00:19:45.320\nthat doesn't make\nglobal-wide system changes.\n\n359\n00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.530\nThat make changes just to\nyour user profile, and\n\n360\n00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:51.820\njust like your data being\nstored in these directories,\n\n361\n00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:57.600\nany configurations that you make are gonna\nbe stored in this NTUSER.DAT file.\n\n362\n00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.820\nAnd that is also a registry file.\n\n363\n00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:04.869\nAnd that's what the operating system looks\nfor when Zach logs in or when I log in,\n\n364\n00:20:04.869 --> 00:20:09.830\nit looks to my NTUSER.DAT file and\nsays, how does Wes have his desktop?\n\n365\n00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:12.920\nAnd those things that are specific\nto his user settings configured.\n\n366\n00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:17.190\nLet me load up those settings and when\nhe logs in, he'll have his desktop and\n\n367\n00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:18.870\nthe settings that he wants.\n\n368\n00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:23.320\nNow, we still don't see\nZach's profile here.\n\n369\n00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.730\nLet's change that.\n\n370\n00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:28.280\nWhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna come\ndown here to our start button.\n\n371\n00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.371\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead,\nand I'm gonna log off.\n\n372\n00:20:30.371 --> 00:20:31.971\nAll right.\n\n373\n00:20:31.971 --> 00:20:35.630\nNow, there he is.\n\n374\n00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:38.944\nWhen we log on as Zach,\nwe didn't have that profile yet,\n\n375\n00:20:38.944 --> 00:20:42.954\nbecause the operating system hasn't\ncopied the default profile and\n\n376\n00:20:42.954 --> 00:20:45.332\napplied Zach's name to it.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n377\n00:20:45.332 --> 00:20:47.630\n&gt;&gt; Let's test this theory, all right?\n\n378\n00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:51.480\nSo we're gonna log in with\nZach's password, all right?\n\n379\n00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.520\n&gt;&gt; Super secret.\n\n380\n00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.550\n&gt;&gt; Super secret, and\n\n381\n00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:56.450\nnotice that it says it's\npreparing my desktop.\n\n382\n00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:58.150\nWhy is it preparing my desktop?\n\n383\n00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:01.860\nZach hasn't even logged into this machine\nyet, he doesn't have anything to prepare.\n\n384\n00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:02.640\nHe hasn't configured it.\n\n385\n00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:06.130\nThat's where the default profile comes in.\n\n386\n00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:10.560\nWhen it says, preparing your desktop that\nis that default profile being copied\n\n387\n00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.640\nto that location.\n\n388\n00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:15.940\nSame locations in the same directory and\nZach's name is being applied to it.\n\n389\n00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:20.220\nAnd then when Zach sees\nhis desktop Like this and\n\n390\n00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:21.720\nVMware tools is part of\nthe virtual machine.\n\n391\n00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.430\nThis isn't something that\nyou would normally see.\n\n392\n00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:26.880\nBut now here's Zach's desktop.\n\n393\n00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.300\nAnd when Zach says, you know what?\n\n394\n00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:32.002\nI think I want,\nI use remote desktop connection a lot,\n\n395\n00:21:32.002 --> 00:21:36.420\nI'm gonna create a shortcut here, and\nwe've seen this in the first part, right?\n\n396\n00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:41.806\nAnd we wanted to, where was that located,\n\n397\n00:21:41.806 --> 00:21:46.443\nthat was local disk C, windows, and\n\n398\n00:21:46.443 --> 00:21:52.890\nI believe it's in system 32,\nwe'll choose OK.\n\n399\n00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:56.520\nThere we go, so Zach uses remote\ndesktop connection lock, all right?\n\n400\n00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.380\nHe needs to connect to a work computer.\n\n401\n00:21:58.380 --> 00:21:59.830\nSo he decides, all right.\n\n402\n00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.820\nI don't wanna be messing around trying\nto find remote desktop connection.\n\n403\n00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:08.500\nI've now got a shortcut on my desktop so\nthat when I click it,\n\n404\n00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.110\nour remote desktop connection opens up.\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n405\n00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.675\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n406\n00:22:11.675 --> 00:22:14.870\nnow we've got some configuration\nsettings that need to be stored.\n\n407\n00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:16.530\nAll right?\nSo where are they stored?\n\n408\n00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:18.570\nIn Zach's profile that's\njust been created.\n\n409\n00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:21.100\nSo if we open up our Windows Explorer,\nFile Explorer,\n\n410\n00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:24.600\ndepending on which edition of\nWindows you're in, all right?\n\n411\n00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.530\nI gotta change the folder in\nsearch options again because that\n\n412\n00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:30.240\nonly affects my machine.\n\n413\n00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:35.140\nNotice that I changed it to show\nhidden files and folders, right?\n\n414\n00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:36.870\nThat is a user-defined setting.\n\n415\n00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:40.137\nIt didn't apply to Zach's profile, right,\n\n416\n00:22:40.137 --> 00:22:45.350\nbecause his configurations\nare stored in a separate location.\n\n417\n00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:51.210\nSo we'll show hidden files and folders,\nwe'll go to Computer, all right?\n\n418\n00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:54.460\nNotice that we'll get into I\novershot the runway there.\n\n419\n00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:57.820\nWe'll get into Users, and\nnow look what we have.\n\n420\n00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:00.729\nSure enough, Zach has his folder there.\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n421\n00:23:00.729 --> 00:23:02.950\n&gt;&gt; And if we look into this folder.\n\n422\n00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:07.410\nNotice that you now have your directories\nand when you save your information,\n\n423\n00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:08.430\nwhere does it get saved?\n\n424\n00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:11.542\nWell more of a rhetorical question,\ncuz you probably see, right,\n\n425\n00:23:11.542 --> 00:23:12.961\nit says my documents right, so\n\n426\n00:23:12.961 --> 00:23:16.145\nby default if he downloads something\nit goes to his download folder.\n\n427\n00:23:16.145 --> 00:23:20.140\nIf I log into a machine and I download\nsomething it goes to my download folder.\n\n428\n00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:25.380\nAll right, and all of those configurations\nare stored specifically in my user profile\n\n429\n00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:28.360\njust like Zach, your settings\nwould be stored in your profile.\n\n430\n00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.064\n&gt;&gt; Now is there a limit to how many users\n\n431\n00:23:31.064 --> 00:23:32.957\ncan actually be stored or\n\n432\n00:23:32.957 --> 00:23:35.854\ncan actually access?\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if there is\n\n433\n00:23:35.854 --> 00:23:36.980\na limitation on that.\n\n434\n00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:39.800\nI'm sure there's probably some\nbinary number that we would have\n\n435\n00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.120\nto probably mention.\n\n436\n00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.810\nI don't know,\nI've never actually got to a limit.\n\n437\n00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:48.581\nI will tell you one thing, when you\nstart adding too many computers in\n\n438\n00:23:48.581 --> 00:23:54.357\na decentralized networking model, it\nbecomes a nightmare to do user management.\n\n439\n00:23:54.357 --> 00:23:56.498\nAnd that's why if we have-\n&gt;&gt; That's kinda what I was getting to.\n\n440\n00:23:56.498 --> 00:23:57.870\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely yeah,\n\n441\n00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:02.753\nso I would say on that one Zach If you\nstart to get past ten users or so,\n\n442\n00:24:02.753 --> 00:24:06.954\nand really it's the amount of computers,\nit just becomes\n\n443\n00:24:06.954 --> 00:24:11.348\ntoo much of an administrative\nburden to manage those users.\n\n444\n00:24:11.348 --> 00:24:16.556\nCuz remember If I set you up ten user\nprofiles, ten users on one computer,\n\n445\n00:24:16.556 --> 00:24:19.920\nthe next computer doesn't\ntrust those users.\n\n446\n00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.540\nSo if you want those users to have access\nto another computer, I have to go set up\n\n447\n00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:25.388\nthose ten users for access.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n448\n00:24:25.388 --> 00:24:28.240\nit can begin with a nightmare.\n&gt;&gt; Which is why we want centralized\n\n449\n00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:32.830\nadministration which is why we typically\ndo identity management through something\n\n450\n00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:35.590\nlike Active Directory directory services.\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n451\n00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:38.540\n&gt;&gt; So again keep in mind that inside of\n\n452\n00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:44.136\nyour user profile,\nthat's where your user-specific files and\n\n453\n00:24:44.136 --> 00:24:46.284\nfolders can get stored.\n\n454\n00:24:46.284 --> 00:24:51.630\nAs well as those settings that pertain\nto your user account, all right?\n\n455\n00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:55.570\nAnd when the computer boots up and\nit starts to load the system drivers,\n\n456\n00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:59.090\ninitiate the file system, it also has\nto look to the registry to figure out\n\n457\n00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:00.860\nhow do I set the run time environment for\n\n458\n00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:03.140\nthe user that's currently\nlogging in to the machine?\n\n459\n00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:03.900\nIt's gonna be different.\n\n460\n00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:08.341\nWe actually kind of proved that here\nbecause you remember in my administrative\n\n461\n00:25:08.341 --> 00:25:11.235\naccount that I was using I\nset the hidden folders and\n\n462\n00:25:11.235 --> 00:25:13.472\nfiles option to show me those, right?\n\n463\n00:25:13.472 --> 00:25:17.672\nWe logged off, we turned right around and\nlogged back in as Zack and\n\n464\n00:25:17.672 --> 00:25:21.197\nnoticed that the file,\nWindows Explorer in this case,\n\n465\n00:25:21.197 --> 00:25:25.632\ncuz we're in Windows 7 notice that\nthe setting was changed, right?\n\n466\n00:25:25.632 --> 00:25:28.461\nAnd again because that is\na user specific setting, right?\n\n467\n00:25:28.461 --> 00:25:29.887\nIt's not like the firewall.\n\n468\n00:25:29.887 --> 00:25:33.597\nThe firewall if I turned off,\nthat affects more than one person, right?\n\n469\n00:25:33.597 --> 00:25:34.926\nThat's a system-wide setting and\n\n470\n00:25:34.926 --> 00:25:37.280\nalso why you would have to be\nan administrator to do that.\n\n471\n00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:40.110\nSo these are some of the things you\nhave to be aware of when it comes to\n\n472\n00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:41.700\nconfiguring desktop settings.\n\n473\n00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:45.080\nKnow where those settings are stored,\nknow that it's in the user profile.\n\n474\n00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:50.120\nKnow what the user profile is and I would\nalso be aware of the ntuser.dat file.\n\n475\n00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:53.610\nAs you go on to maybe those of you\nthat are gonna springboard into\n\n476\n00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:58.310\nfrom MTA go into an MCSA in your\nWindows client operating system.\n\n477\n00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:01.520\nYou'll have to know a little bit\nmore about that ntuser.dat file and\n\n478\n00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:05.270\nhow we can configure things like,\nroaming profiles.\n\n479\n00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:09.330\nAnd you'll learn that more that when you\ngo into more your advanced training.\n\n480\n00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:12.310\nBut it is important to\nbe aware of that file.\n\n481\n00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:15.090\nAnd what it does, and\nwhat the effect that it has.\n\n482\n00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:19.980\nWhat is its use case when it\ncomes to your user profile?\n\n483\n00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:23.570\nAnd ultimately, what we're talking\nabout here is the configuration\n\n484\n00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:26.600\nof those desktop settings.\n&gt;&gt; Excellent job as always, Wes.\n\n485\n00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:30.640\nWindows Always Fundamentals\nConfiguring Desktop Settings Part Two.\n\n486\n00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.080\nMake sure you see Part One.\n\n487\n00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.845\nAnd see everything in the series.\n\n488\n00:26:33.845 --> 00:26:37.550\nOf Windows OS fundamentals\nbecause they're fantastic.\n\n489\n00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:38.400\nAnd it will help you.\n\n490\n00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.180\nIt really will.\n\n491\n00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:42.220\nAnd while you're in that course\nlibrary thousands of other videos.\n\n492\n00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:44.460\nAnd they're there to help you go further.\n\n493\n00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.910\nHey tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n494\n00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:48.490\nITProTV is binge

00:00:08.398\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.398 --> 00:00:12.404\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.404 --> 00:00:14.517\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:14.517 --> 00:00:17.384\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:20.484\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:20.484 --> 00:00:24.583\nwe are continuing on with more of our\nMTA for Windows OS Fundamentals, right?\n\n9\n00:00:24.583 --> 00:00:27.970\nWe're gonna get you guys squared away and\nsuited up, prepared for that.\n\n10\n00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.880\nJoining us in studio to help out with that\nendeavor, our good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.729\nWes, welcome back, man, how's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:34.110\n&gt;&gt; Hey man, thanks for having me here.\n\n13\n00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.260\nIt is going great.\n\n14\n00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.350\nThat's right, we're gonna be looking at\nsome of the applications that you can find\n\n15\n00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.570\ninside of Windows.\n\n16\n00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.530\nKeep in mind that you always\nhave third party applications.\n\n17\n00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.350\nBut just like with any operating system,\nyou do have a certain amount of utilities,\n\n18\n00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.220\ntools, applications that are bundled right\ninto the operating system, and well,\n\n19\n00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.560\nWindows is no exception to that.\n\n20\n00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.530\nSo let's go ahead and\nfirst couple of things that we're gonna\n\n21\n00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.840\ntalk about are really\nspecific to Windows 10.\n\n22\n00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.700\nAnd then we're gonna look at a couple\nof the applications or tools,\n\n23\n00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.640\nif you will, that we've really\nhad in Windows for a while.\n\n24\n00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.703\nSo let's go ahead and let's start\nout with the ones that a little bit\n\n25\n00:01:06.703 --> 00:01:09.710\nmore Windows 10, well,\nactually a lot of it, not a little bit,\n\n26\n00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.901\n[LAUGH] a lot of it Windows 10 centric,\nright?\n\n27\n00:01:11.901 --> 00:01:12.870\nAnd what am I talking about?\n\n28\n00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.803\nWell, I'm talking about Microsoft's\nlatest and greatest browser and that\n\n29\n00:01:16.803 --> 00:01:21.292\nis something known as Microsoft Edge, the\nEdge browser, as well as, well, Cortana.\n\n30\n00:01:21.292 --> 00:01:26.324\nNow, so if you've been playing games like\nHalo for a long time, say, well, Cortana-\n\n31\n00:01:26.324 --> 00:01:27.089\n&gt;&gt; I know that name.\n\n32\n00:01:27.089 --> 00:01:29.147\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\nShe isn't new, so [CROSSTALK]\n\n33\n00:01:29.147 --> 00:01:30.276\n&gt;&gt; She's been around in the Microsoft\n\n34\n00:01:30.276 --> 00:01:31.147\nworld for quite some time.\n\n35\n00:01:31.147 --> 00:01:36.250\n&gt;&gt; Right, but they were hoping that\nthis would happen in Windows 8.1.\n\n36\n00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.150\nAnd it didn't quite happen\nthe way they wanted to.\n\n37\n00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.920\nBut they wanted to kinda\nput everything that we're\n\n38\n00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.790\nfamiliar with in the Microsoft world\ninto a single type of experience, right?\n\n39\n00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.210\nThose of you that have played Halo\nknow that Microsoft acquired Halo.\n\n40\n00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.658\nAnd they took Cortana, that assistant,\nif you will, inside of Halo, and\n\n41\n00:01:53.658 --> 00:01:56.037\nthey slipstreamed her into Windows 10,\nright?\n\n42\n00:01:56.037 --> 00:01:57.651\n&gt;&gt; Well, she was so helpful to master.\n\n43\n00:01:57.651 --> 00:02:00.147\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure.\n&gt;&gt; How could she not help you?\n\n44\n00:02:00.147 --> 00:02:01.766\n&gt;&gt; If she can help in\nfirst person shooter,\n\n45\n00:02:01.766 --> 00:02:03.674\nshe can help in your first person-\n&gt;&gt; She can get me to\n\n46\n00:02:03.674 --> 00:02:04.443\na website that I need.\n\n47\n00:02:04.443 --> 00:02:06.738\n&gt;&gt; That's right, she can get you to\nyour first person desktop as well.\n\n48\n00:02:06.738 --> 00:02:09.313\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna talk a little bit\n\n49\n00:02:09.313 --> 00:02:13.675\nabout Cortana and what it is that she\ncan do inside of our operating systems,\n\n50\n00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:15.600\nas well as Microsoft Edge.\n\n51\n00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.603\nAnd then like I said, we're gonna talk\nabout some other things that have actually\n\n52\n00:02:18.603 --> 00:02:19.965\nbeen in Windows for a very long time.\n\n53\n00:02:19.965 --> 00:02:21.360\nSo let's go ahead and let's do that.\n\n54\n00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.170\nLet's drop down to our\nWindows 10 machine here.\n\n55\n00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.390\nAnd hovering on our desktop here,\nwe can see that well, it lets us know that\n\n56\n00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.950\nthe little e icon that we're familiar\nwith with things like Internet Explorer,\n\n57\n00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.040\nthey're now using it for Microsoft Edge\nwith a slight variation on it.\n\n58\n00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.715\nBut if we open up our\nMicrosoft Edge browser here,\n\n59\n00:02:38.715 --> 00:02:42.025\nyou can see that it's really\nlike all the other browsers.\n\n60\n00:02:42.025 --> 00:02:44.255\nHowever, there are certain\nthings that are specific,\n\n61\n00:02:44.255 --> 00:02:48.735\nif you will, functionality-wise\nto your Windows operating system.\n\n62\n00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:51.890\nFor instance,\nif we look at our browser here at the top,\n\n63\n00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.980\nwe've got a really cool\ntype of tabbed view, right?\n\n64\n00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.141\nI can add tabs to our\nbrowsing experience here.\n\n65\n00:03:00.141 --> 00:03:01.610\nAnd if I want,\nI can choose the down arrow.\n\n66\n00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.710\nAnd it actually shows me the tabs here or\ncollapse those on each other.\n\n67\n00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.575\nOne of the things I kinda like with this\nis that you can actually collapse them all\n\n68\n00:03:08.575 --> 00:03:09.770\ninto a single location.\n\n69\n00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.864\nSo I can say, you know what,\njust collapse all of these, and\n\n70\n00:03:12.864 --> 00:03:14.503\nif I wanna see individual tabs,\n\n71\n00:03:14.503 --> 00:03:17.986\nyou have this little option of view\nthe tabs that you've set aside.\n\n72\n00:03:17.986 --> 00:03:21.585\nAnd it'll open them up kinda\nin a side panel, right?\n\n73\n00:03:21.585 --> 00:03:25.185\nAnd then we can always restore these too,\nif we want, so\n\n74\n00:03:25.185 --> 00:03:29.370\nyou get your tab browsing\nright up here at the top here.\n\n75\n00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.920\nWe've got the refresh option.\n\n76\n00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.210\nWe've got the home option, depending\non where you set your home page to,\n\n77\n00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.010\nwhich we'll also show you there as well.\n\n78\n00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.810\nYou can open up a new window like we've\nshown you with the plus button or\n\n79\n00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.220\na new tab, I should say.\n\n80\n00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.960\nAnd when we look at some of the other\nthings across the top here,\n\n81\n00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.430\nyou'll have an icon for the reading view.\n\n82\n00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.008\nIf your website supports it,\nthe website that you visit, I should say,\n\n83\n00:03:54.008 --> 00:03:56.824\nif it supports it,\nit could actually streamline this and\n\n84\n00:03:56.824 --> 00:04:00.481\nmake it a little bit easier to read\nthe text, hence the term reading view.\n\n85\n00:04:00.481 --> 00:04:02.050\nIt says, give me the text, right?\n\n86\n00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.780\nMake it more friendly if I'm\njust trying to read the website.\n\n87\n00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.850\nAs well as the star option, this allows\nyou to add it to the favorites or\n\n88\n00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.900\nlike you would say, you did the same thing\nif you add it to the reading list and\n\n89\n00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.960\nthat's why if we kind of\ndo a little hover here.\n\n90\n00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.730\nYou should see, if I can get that right\nthere in the list that not only will this\n\n91\n00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.268\nadd this to the favorites, it's kind\nof like a bookmark if you will, but\n\n92\n00:04:22.268 --> 00:04:24.301\nit can also add it to\nthe reading list too.\n\n93\n00:04:24.301 --> 00:04:26.408\nNow, speaking then,\ngoing a little bit farther,\n\n94\n00:04:26.408 --> 00:04:29.600\nyou'll notice that if we hover over here,\nyou have what's known as the hub.\n\n95\n00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.640\nAnd this is a newer feature inside,\n\n96\n00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.120\nit wasn't something that was\npart of Internet Explorer.\n\n97\n00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.880\nAnd if we open this up, it doesn't\njust look at what your favorites are.\n\n98\n00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.410\nYou can say that well, of course,\nmy favorite here is ITProTV, of course.\n\n99\n00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.390\nBut I can also see anything that\nwe've added to the reading list to,\n\n100\n00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.350\nagain, you can notice\nwhat it says right there.\n\n101\n00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.700\nStay on top of your reading.\n\n102\n00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.200\nAgain, and\n\n103\n00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.680\nthen as well, any books that you have, you\ncan get electronic books, right, e-books.\n\n104\n00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.300\nAnd you can download them here,\nand you can not only get them from\n\n105\n00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.320\nthe Windows Store, but you can read\nthem right in the browser likewise too.\n\n106\n00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.063\nYou also have history, and\nyou can see the history that you have.\n\n107\n00:05:06.063 --> 00:05:10.611\nAnd you can view the browsing history,\nas well as any downloads,\n\n108\n00:05:10.611 --> 00:05:16.440\nany downloads that you have downloaded\nthrough the Microsoft Edge browser.\n\n109\n00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.670\nThey will, by default,\nbe downloaded to your user profile.\n\n110\n00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.080\nWe've talked about the user\nprofile in other episodes, and\n\n111\n00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.810\nthat will be in whatever the user is.\n\n112\n00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.050\nTheir downloads, that's documents\nthere in the Downloads folder.\n\n113\n00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.670\nAlright, so there's some other things\nthat you should be aware of too.\n\n114\n00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.752\nOne of the features that I kind of like,\nespecially for those of you out there that\n\n115\n00:05:37.752 --> 00:05:41.308\nare maybe taking college courses and\nmaybe you've gone to a website.\n\n116\n00:05:41.308 --> 00:05:45.015\nAnd you're like, I really would like to\njust remember that piece of text and I'd\n\n117\n00:05:45.015 --> 00:05:49.110\nreally like to remember the website that\nI'd seen it on or maybe a graphic, right?\n\n118\n00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:54.320\nWell, you can actually use this\noption up here that if you choose to,\n\n119\n00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.260\nyou can basically turn around and\n\n120\n00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:01.890\nyou can write right on the web\npage that you're looking at.\n\n121\n00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.070\nAnd that's great because then you can\nturn around and you can save it later.\n\n122\n00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.403\nYou do not wanna see my drawing abilities.\n\n123\n00:06:07.403 --> 00:06:09.253\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As Dan laughs over here,\n\n124\n00:06:09.253 --> 00:06:10.950\nhe knows my drawing [LAUGH] abilities.\n\n125\n00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.508\nBut I can turn around and I can save this.\n\n126\n00:06:13.508 --> 00:06:17.072\nAnd when I save it, I can come back and\nI can look at the little notes that I've\n\n127\n00:06:17.072 --> 00:06:20.930\nscratched on the page, and this is even\nbetter if you have a touch interface.\n\n128\n00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.726\nYou just wanna scratch something on,\nright?\n\n129\n00:06:22.726 --> 00:06:25.070\nMaybe it's a recipe.\n\n130\n00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.161\nMaybe this isn't for school.\n\n131\n00:06:26.161 --> 00:06:30.348\nMaybe you're searching for a recipe for\nwhatever, I don't know, hot sauce,\n\n132\n00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:31.107\n[LAUGH] right?\n\n133\n00:06:31.107 --> 00:06:33.485\nAnd I wanna say, hey,\nremember this little ingredients, right?\n\n134\n00:06:33.485 --> 00:06:35.995\nAnd we can sit here and we can draw\non that, and we can turn around and\n\n135\n00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:36.575\nsave it, right?\n\n136\n00:06:36.575 --> 00:06:38.845\nSo scribbling functionality\nis pretty cool.\n\n137\n00:06:38.845 --> 00:06:42.375\nAnd we'll say no to that and\nlet me reopen the browser there.\n\n138\n00:06:42.375 --> 00:06:49.395\nAll right, so that's kinda cool,\nas well as sharing a specific website too.\n\n139\n00:06:49.395 --> 00:06:51.709\nNow if you get to the little\nellipse button here,\n\n140\n00:06:51.709 --> 00:06:55.151\nyou can see that there are many of\nthe things that you could do in Windows or\n\n141\n00:06:55.151 --> 00:06:57.420\nInternet Explorer you can do here.\n\n142\n00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.750\nNew window does exactly\nwhat it sounds like, right?\n\n143\n00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.580\nPretty intuitive there.\n\n144\n00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.450\nNew private window,\nwe're in private browser.\n\n145\n00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:04.800\nRemember, in private browsing,\n\n146\n00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.290\nwhat it says is, don't keep the history\nstored on the local machine.\n\n147\n00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.880\nNow and this doesn't hide the fact\nfrom like an employer, an ISP, or\n\n148\n00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.320\nthe website that you visited.\n\n149\n00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.240\nBut it said,\ndon't cache that information locally.\n\n150\n00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.500\nIn fact, we've gotta use in\nprivate-type browsing here a lot of\n\n151\n00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.080\ntimes within the shows where we don't\nwant it to remember cookies, right?\n\n152\n00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.340\nAnd maybe Dan, for instance,\n\n153\n00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.690\nmaybe you're in one of the security\nshows Dan showing an attack, right?\n\n154\n00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:29.860\nWell maybe the attack has to be different,\nright?\n\n155\n00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.055\nAnd he's demonstrating it against a\npersonal website that he's created, right?\n\n156\n00:07:33.055 --> 00:07:37.090\nWell, he doesn't want that history to show\nup, so he opens it in private browser,\n\n157\n00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.960\ndoesn't save the history, and\nthen he can do demonstrations, right?\n\n158\n00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.810\nSo that's a great kinda\nfeature to have too.\n\n159\n00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:45.140\nZoom, exactly what it sounds like.\n\n160\n00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:45.902\nI will tell you,\n\n161\n00:07:45.902 --> 00:07:49.231\nI really wish they would give you some\nkinda control shortcut to do zoom.\n\n162\n00:07:49.231 --> 00:07:50.202\n&gt;&gt; That'd be awesome.\n\n163\n00:07:50.202 --> 00:07:53.508\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but again,\nEdge browser is relatively new And\n\n164\n00:07:53.508 --> 00:07:58.445\none of the things that they're trying to\ndo is just shorten its attack surface.\n\n165\n00:07:58.445 --> 00:08:01.420\nSo some of the functionality\nis still kind of limited.\n\n166\n00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:06.040\nFavorites as well, you can see,\ncast your media to a device, right?\n\n167\n00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.390\nSo if your Windows 10\ndevice supports Miracast,\n\n168\n00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:12.790\nwhich is just Microsoft's\nimplementation of WiFi direct, right.\n\n169\n00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:14.100\nChromecast has these.\n\n170\n00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.999\nYou've seen this technology before, right?\n\n171\n00:08:15.999 --> 00:08:17.740\nThis is built into the web browser.\n\n172\n00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.540\nYou can do a find, kinda like your Ctrl+F,\nif you wanna find something on the page.\n\n173\n00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.255\nPrint, right, all of these.\n\n174\n00:08:23.255 --> 00:08:27.890\nYou guys are very smart out there,\nand some of these are kind of obvious.\n\n175\n00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:32.670\nHowever, I will tell you, one that's gonna\nkind of scroll out of view here because\n\n176\n00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:37.010\nit's gonna be behind my head here is the\nsettings option down here at the bottom.\n\n177\n00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:38.929\nAnd the settings, you might say,\nwell, wait a second.\n\n178\n00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:40.480\nWeren't we already in settings?\n\n179\n00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.594\nWell these are more settings, right?\n\n180\n00:08:41.594 --> 00:08:42.824\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it's kinda like the control panel.\n\n181\n00:08:42.824 --> 00:08:44.263\n&gt;&gt; It should say more settings.\n\n182\n00:08:44.263 --> 00:08:45.145\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n183\n00:08:45.145 --> 00:08:46.607\n&gt;&gt; It's kinda like the control panel\n\n184\n00:08:46.607 --> 00:08:49.440\nepisode, where we had a door in front\nof a door that leads to a door.\n\n185\n00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.054\nWell, we got more in settings.\n\n186\n00:08:50.054 --> 00:08:51.424\n&gt;&gt; And there's a little door.\n\n187\n00:08:51.424 --> 00:08:53.525\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, and to compound on that,\n\n188\n00:08:53.525 --> 00:08:55.892\nlet's go ahead and\nscroll all the way down and\n\n189\n00:08:55.892 --> 00:08:58.030\nthen you have [LAUGH] Advanced settings.\n\n190\n00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.321\nSo you have another,\nyour third setting box.\n\n191\n00:08:59.321 --> 00:08:59.925\n&gt;&gt; Settings!\n\n192\n00:08:59.925 --> 00:09:01.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right,\nso what can we do here?\n\n193\n00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.589\nAgain, you could choose your theme, right?\n\n194\n00:09:03.589 --> 00:09:05.754\nYou could change it up, maybe colors or\n\n195\n00:09:05.754 --> 00:09:08.870\nsomething that you maybe have\na hard time viewing, so.\n\n196\n00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:12.830\n&gt;&gt; It's great for night time if you're\nlooking at your browser during the night.\n\n197\n00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:13.431\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n\n198\n00:09:13.431 --> 00:09:14.415\n&gt;&gt; That dark theme is very helpful, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; If you're on\n\n199\n00:09:14.415 --> 00:09:18.887\nsome kind of a small Surface tablet or\nsomething like that, yeah, it's perfect.\n\n200\n00:09:18.887 --> 00:09:21.729\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and\nchange this back, right?\n\n201\n00:09:21.729 --> 00:09:25.300\nLet's just, we can open\nMicrosoft Edge with a specific page.\n\n202\n00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.831\nThis is not what you would see by default.\n\n203\n00:09:27.831 --> 00:09:30.994\nI do this because by default,\nthere's a lot of newsfeeds here, and\n\n204\n00:09:30.994 --> 00:09:33.280\nwe're not trying to get political or\nanything.\n\n205\n00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.207\nSo I kind of just said-\n&gt;&gt; Who knows what might jump up on you.\n\n206\n00:09:35.207 --> 00:09:36.171\n&gt;&gt; You never know, that's right.\n\n207\n00:09:36.171 --> 00:09:39.369\n&gt;&gt; Medicine.com [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, it opens up a lot of,\n\n208\n00:09:39.369 --> 00:09:43.857\nkinda like your Start menu with live\ntiles, and I just don't want some of those\n\n209\n00:09:43.857 --> 00:09:47.127\nnewsflash going over here inside of our-\n&gt;&gt; And we thank you, Wes.\n\n210\n00:09:47.127 --> 00:09:47.762\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n211\n00:09:47.762 --> 00:09:48.566\n&gt;&gt; Cuz we don't either.\n\n212\n00:09:48.566 --> 00:09:50.930\n&gt;&gt; No, exactly, inside of the show here.\n\n213\n00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:51.674\nBut you can.\n\n214\n00:09:51.674 --> 00:09:53.170\nYou can say, okay, well, you know what?\n\n215\n00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:56.960\nI just go to the Start page, do a new tab,\nany previous pages that you have opened.\n\n216\n00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:01.918\nOr I did a specific page, and in this\ncase, the best page there is, ITPro.TV.\n\n217\n00:10:01.918 --> 00:10:03.381\nAnd you could also add pages, too.\n\n218\n00:10:03.381 --> 00:10:08.800\nYou can tell it whether you want it to\nbe top sites, and suggested content.\n\n219\n00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.317\nAnd that's one of\nthe things I kinda disable.\n\n220\n00:10:10.317 --> 00:10:11.804\nAnd I said just take us to a blank page,\n\n221\n00:10:11.804 --> 00:10:14.150\ncuz we don't wanna see all\nthe headlines of the days.\n\n222\n00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:17.820\nBut you can, if that is important for you.\n\n223\n00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.850\nAnother thing that we can do, too, here,\nis, you will see, and let me click off of\n\n224\n00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:25.120\nthis here, is that we can import favorites\nand other info from another browser.\n\n225\n00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:25.840\nAnd that's nice.\n\n226\n00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.330\nYou can bring that information\ninto Edge if you want.\n\n227\n00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.860\nSame thing with customizations\nof the Favorites Bar.\n\n228\n00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.470\nAnd then clearing your browsing history.\n\n229\n00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:35.010\nNow when you clear the browsing history,\n\n230\n00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.970\nnotice that this is gonna take you\nto another set of options here.\n\n231\n00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:41.700\nAnd it's a lot like Windows or\nInternet Explorer was in the fact that\n\n232\n00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:45.000\nwhat it allows you to\ndelete from the history.\n\n233\n00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.980\nYou can see here that we've\ngot different options, right?\n\n234\n00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.820\nDownload history, and if I want, I could\nsay, you know what, I wanna go ahead and\n\n235\n00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.970\nI wanna delete all of these,\nright, and I can choose clear.\n\n236\n00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:58.175\nAnd then what the Edge browser is\ngonna do is it's gonna go through and\n\n237\n00:10:58.175 --> 00:11:00.690\nit'll clear those temporary files for you.\n\n238\n00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:05.125\nYou can also, this is good,\nas I joked around and I'm seriously.\n\n239\n00:11:05.125 --> 00:11:06.870\n[LAUGH] Yeah, serious about this.\n\n240\n00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:10.320\nIs that always clear the browser or\nclear the history, if you will.\n\n241\n00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.000\nWhen I close the browser down, this is\none where you can say, you know what?\n\n242\n00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.693\nI don't wanna have to\ncome in here manually,\n\n243\n00:11:14.693 --> 00:11:17.279\nor if you're like me that sometimes\nyou want some of that history to be\n\n244\n00:11:17.279 --> 00:11:19.710\nleft behind because you're\nresearching something.\n\n245\n00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:24.210\nMaybe you don't want that, and\nagain you have your option to do that and\n\n246\n00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:26.840\ntailor it a little bit to what you need.\n\n247\n00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.590\nNow, if we scroll down here, too,\nI do wanna make mention of this,\n\n248\n00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:32.560\nit can be personalized even farther.\n\n249\n00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.671\nIf you log in with a Microsoft account,\nagain keep in mind that one of the good\n\n250\n00:11:36.671 --> 00:11:41.314\nthings about the Microsoft account is that\nit synchronizes settings up in the Cloud.\n\n251\n00:11:41.314 --> 00:11:44.788\nAnd if you log in to another Windows-based\nmachine with your Microsoft account,\n\n252\n00:11:44.788 --> 00:11:47.470\nit synchronizes those settings\nback down to that new machine.\n\n253\n00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:51.080\nSo you don't get that experience\nif you're not logged in.\n\n254\n00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.870\nIf you aren't logged into a Windows or\n\n255\n00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:55.920\na Microsoft account,\nyou don't get that functionality.\n\n256\n00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:00.754\nYou also get to see what\nthe version is of Microsoft Edge,\n\n257\n00:12:00.754 --> 00:12:03.486\ntoo, in the settings feature.\n\n258\n00:12:03.486 --> 00:12:05.485\nBut then you might have to\ngo a little bit farther.\n\n259\n00:12:05.485 --> 00:12:10.035\nSo yes, just when you thought we were as\nfar down in the settings options as we can\n\n260\n00:12:10.035 --> 00:12:12.395\ngo, we've got yet another door to open.\n\n261\n00:12:12.395 --> 00:12:15.930\nSo let's go ahead and open that door and\nget into advanced settings, right?\n\n262\n00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:16.739\nHome button.\n\n263\n00:12:16.739 --> 00:12:20.052\nRight, it can tell you where it takes you,\nand again, you can see, a specific page,\n\n264\n00:12:20.052 --> 00:12:20.756\nnew tab, right?\n\n265\n00:12:20.756 --> 00:12:22.184\nSo again, just more configurations.\n\n266\n00:12:22.184 --> 00:12:23.288\nPop-up blocker,\n\n267\n00:12:23.288 --> 00:12:28.059\nmost of the modern web browser have pop-up\nblockers integrated right into them.\n\n268\n00:12:28.059 --> 00:12:30.260\n&gt;&gt; That makes you wonder,\ndo pop-ups even exist anymore?\n\n269\n00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.389\nCuz every browser has a pop-up blocker.\n\n270\n00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:34.467\nThey do a fantastic job\nof stopping pop-ups,\n\n271\n00:12:34.467 --> 00:12:36.290\nmaybe they've gone the way of the dodo.\n\n272\n00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:37.823\nI'll turn off my pop-up blocker and\nfind out.\n\n273\n00:12:37.823 --> 00:12:39.166\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, [LAUGH] absolutely.\n\n274\n00:12:39.166 --> 00:12:40.923\n&gt;&gt; Surf for a week without a pop-up\nblocker and see what happens.\n\n275\n00:12:40.923 --> 00:12:43.593\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, let's make sure\nwe air gap your computer, right?\n\n276\n00:12:43.593 --> 00:12:44.127\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n277\n00:12:44.127 --> 00:12:45.915\nwe unplug it [LAUGH] after that, right?\n\n278\n00:12:45.915 --> 00:12:47.040\n&gt;&gt; This fool!\n\n279\n00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.873\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, and that's a great thing.\n\n280\n00:12:49.873 --> 00:12:52.310\nI agree with you that they've\ndone a really good job.\n\n281\n00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:55.558\nIt used to be, [LAUGH] I'm gonna say\nback in the day, whenever that was.\n\n282\n00:12:55.558 --> 00:12:57.287\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You had to go to a third party\n\n283\n00:12:57.287 --> 00:12:58.490\npop-up blocker to be able.\n\n284\n00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:00.242\nNow they said, well, hey, [LAUGH]\nwhy don't we just integrate this in?\n\n285\n00:13:00.242 --> 00:13:01.554\n&gt;&gt; Just throw that in there.\n\n286\n00:13:01.554 --> 00:13:02.506\n&gt;&gt; So that's a great thing to have.\n\n287\n00:13:02.506 --> 00:13:03.504\n&gt;&gt; Put it in the cookie dough, right?\n\n288\n00:13:03.504 --> 00:13:05.962\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Use Adobe Flash, right?\n\n289\n00:13:05.962 --> 00:13:08.094\nSo you have Flash functionality\nbuilt right in so\n\n290\n00:13:08.094 --> 00:13:10.055\nyou don't have to go to a third party.\n\n291\n00:13:10.055 --> 00:13:10.931\nThird party.\n\n292\n00:13:10.931 --> 00:13:12.530\nYou don't have to go to Adobe and\n[LAUGH] download Flash anymore,\n\n293\n00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:14.447\nwhich is one of the things-\n&gt;&gt; And I like that it's enable-able or\n\n294\n00:13:14.447 --> 00:13:16.556\ndisable-able because some people,\nit's a security issue.\n\n295\n00:13:16.556 --> 00:13:17.133\n&gt;&gt; It absolutely is.\n\n296\n00:13:17.133 --> 00:13:20.280\n&gt;&gt; So being able to turn it off or\non very easily is a good thing.\n\n297\n00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.839\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, in fact,\nit's kinda interesting.\n\n298\n00:13:22.839 --> 00:13:26.047\nAt the time of this recording,\n2018, guess what, well,\n\n299\n00:13:26.047 --> 00:13:29.085\nthey just discovered a new\nzero-day exploit two days ago.\n\n300\n00:13:29.085 --> 00:13:30.188\n[LAUGH] So you can see that maybe you\n\n301\n00:13:30.188 --> 00:13:31.972\ndon't [LAUGH] want Adobe Flash\nlike Dan said, right?\n\n302\n00:13:31.972 --> 00:13:34.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And again what sites, right?\n\n303\n00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:36.560\nChoose what sites open in the apps, right?\n\n304\n00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:37.330\nAnd downloads.\n\n305\n00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.103\nRemember I told you that if\nyou download an application,\n\n306\n00:13:40.103 --> 00:13:41.795\nit goes to your Downloads folder.\n\n307\n00:13:41.795 --> 00:13:43.050\nWell, you can actually change that.\n\n308\n00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:46.130\nYou can see that here as well.\n\n309\n00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:47.920\nProxies, if you need to set up proxies,\n\n310\n00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.700\nincluding things like website permissions,\nright, as well as managing passwords.\n\n311\n00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.590\nSo all different kinds\nof things you can do.\n\n312\n00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:56.330\nAgain, showing the history.\n\n313\n00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.808\nAgain, do you block third party cookies?\n\n314\n00:13:58.808 --> 00:14:02.180\nIf we wanna block cookies,\nwe can, but we can say,\n\n315\n00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.990\nhey, block only third party cookies.\n\n316\n00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:08.060\nSo again, a lot of different\nthings that you can do, right?\n\n317\n00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:11.520\nFor instance, when I download\napplications, I might want to make sure,\n\n318\n00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:16.270\nin fact you do wanna make sure,\nthat any application or website that you\n\n319\n00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:20.610\nvisit is scanned against a reputation\ndatabase that Microsoft maintains.\n\n320\n00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:23.450\nAnd that's this setting right here\nthat my head's kinda covering up.\n\n321\n00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:26.160\nThat is the Windows Defender SmartScreen.\n\n322\n00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.440\nWe've known it in earlier operating\nsystems as the SmartScreen Filter.\n\n323\n00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.388\nThey just call everything\ntoday Windows Defender.\n\n324\n00:14:31.388 --> 00:14:35.308\nBecause they're really trying what's known\nas more of like a UTM-type approach,\n\n325\n00:14:35.308 --> 00:14:37.250\nwhere it's unified threat management.\n\n326\n00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:40.200\nYou have\nWindows Defender Advanced Firewall,\n\n327\n00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.030\nyou have Windows Defender SmartScreen.\n\n328\n00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:44.470\nEssentially, it's Windows\ndefending itself, so\n\n329\n00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:46.950\nthey've kind of bundled\nit all together here.\n\n330\n00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:47.840\nAll right, let's see.\n\n331\n00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.670\nI think that's pretty much got it.\n\n332\n00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:54.260\nYou can also control, by the way, in Edge,\n\n333\n00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:59.460\nwhat applications are allowed to interact,\nif you will, with websites.\n\n334\n00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:03.570\nI'm gonna go ahead, and what I'm gonna do\nis I'm gonna close down Edge here, and\n\n335\n00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.060\nwe're gonna go to our settings.\n\n336\n00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.400\nI'm gonna go ahead and\njust right-click on our Windows tile,\n\n337\n00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.670\nI know we've been using the Thought Bubble\na lot throughout this series.\n\n338\n00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:12.740\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nuse the Settings option here.\n\n339\n00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:13.820\nSo you guys and\n\n340\n00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.770\ngals out there get a few different\nways that you can do this, all right.\n\n341\n00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:20.150\nAnd then from here, what we're gonna do\nis, notice we're in Windows Settings, and\n\n342\n00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:23.050\nthen we are going to go to Apps.\n\n343\n00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:28.520\nAnd then, notice that from Apps we\nwill have Apps for websites, right?\n\n344\n00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:32.590\nNow you could have launched\nthis inside of Microsoft Edge.\n\n345\n00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:37.541\nBut I want you to know that you\ncan also configure it here, right,\n\n346\n00:15:37.541 --> 00:15:39.701\nso it allows you to turn off or\n\n347\n00:15:39.701 --> 00:15:44.221\non an application or\nopen the website in a browser, right?\n\n348\n00:15:44.221 --> 00:15:47.381\nSo it gives you the ability to control,\nessentially,\n\n349\n00:15:47.381 --> 00:15:51.861\nwhat applications can interact with\ndifferent websites, if you choose to.\n\n350\n00:15:51.861 --> 00:15:54.331\nFor instance, I think they've\ngot Groove in there, music app.\n\n351\n00:15:54.331 --> 00:15:58.771\nIf I Go to a place that wants to\ndownload or play some music, right?\n\n352\n00:15:58.771 --> 00:16:01.610\nIn the earlier days, it would be\nWindows Media Player that would open up.\n\n353\n00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:03.070\nI think today is Groove, right?\n\n354\n00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:07.880\nSo again, what applications you have\nthat are available to interact with\n\n355\n00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.810\nthe Microsoft Edge browser really is\ncontingent on what you have downloaded.\n\n356\n00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:13.760\nSo again,\njust wanted to let you know that.\n\n357\n00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.890\nSo that's a little bit\nabout the Edge browser.\n\n358\n00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:18.970\nAnd again, just be aware of some\nof the things that you can do,\n\n359\n00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:20.210\nknow that it's a web browser.\n\n360\n00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:22.620\nI mean, a web browser is a web browser.\n\n361\n00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.370\nHowever, you might have your favorite.\n\n362\n00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:26.350\nMe personally,\nI like to use things like Chrome.\n\n363\n00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:27.904\nI love Chrome, always have.\n\n364\n00:16:27.904 --> 00:16:32.528\nBut remember, one of the things that they\nwon't ask you on an MTA exam is how do you\n\n365\n00:16:32.528 --> 00:16:34.850\nconfigure settings in Chrome, right?\n\n366\n00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:40.340\nSo I usually tell people this, because\nthey said well, I don't use Edge, right?\n\n367\n00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:43.180\nWell, we don't really\nuse Edge too much here.\n\n368\n00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.700\nI don't know what you use, Dan,\nI use Chrome all the time.\n\n369\n00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:46.720\n&gt;&gt; I'm a Firefox user.\n\n370\n00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:47.620\n&gt;&gt; Firefox, right?\n\n371\n00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.470\nSo be aware of this product,\n\n372\n00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:54.030\nbecause they're gonna ask you about it\npotentially on the MTA exam, right?\n\n373\n00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:56.480\nYou don't go into a Microsoft exam and\nexpect for\n\n374\n00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:00.180\nthem to ask you questions about Safari,\nright?\n\n375\n00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.970\nSo it is important to understand\nthe applications that are built into\n\n376\n00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:04.440\nthe operating system.\n\n377\n00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.670\nThat being said,\nwe also have Cortana, right?\n\n378\n00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:07.612\nWe talked about Cortana.\n\n379\n00:17:07.612 --> 00:17:10.325\nCortana is essentially\na personal assistant,\n\n380\n00:17:10.325 --> 00:17:14.268\nlike some of the other operating\nsystems that have their built-in.\n\n381\n00:17:14.268 --> 00:17:16.800\nGives you a personalized experience,\nif you will.\n\n382\n00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:21.440\nAnd as Cortana learns from you,\nlearns from your data via things,\n\n383\n00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:25.840\nlike calendars, different searches,\ncontent, location data.\n\n384\n00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:29.183\nShe can start to learn your habits, right?\n\n385\n00:17:29.183 --> 00:17:32.540\nAnd then makes suggestions on\nwhatever those habits are.\n\n386\n00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.430\nBasically, personalizing the experience\nwithin the operating system.\n\n387\n00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:40.080\nBut you do have to know a little\nbit about the configuration.\n\n388\n00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.610\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n389\n00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:44.760\nlet's dive down back into our Settings\nin our Windows 10 machine here.\n\n390\n00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.866\nSo again we're gonna just right-click\non our Windows tile, Windows icon,\n\n391\n00:17:47.866 --> 00:17:49.075\nwe're gonna go to Settings.\n\n392\n00:17:49.075 --> 00:17:53.406\nAnd one of the great things about it here\nis Cortana has literally got her own\n\n393\n00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:54.480\nlocation.\n\n394\n00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.928\nKinda like we've talked about in other\nepisodes, like the Control Panel.\n\n395\n00:17:56.928 --> 00:17:59.740\nWell, Cortana has got her own\nlittle location right here in\n\n396\n00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.140\nthe Windows settings.\n\n397\n00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.585\nAnd then you can see some of the various\nthings that you can do, right?.\n\n398\n00:18:03.585 --> 00:18:04.830\nTalk to Cortana, right?\n\n399\n00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:08.460\nMake sure that the microphone we\ncould check the microphone here.\n\n400\n00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:12.490\nKinda like some of the other digital\npersonal assistants that we have.\n\n401\n00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:13.950\nShe could be listening in the background.\n\n402\n00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:14.859\nYou say hey, Cortana.\n\n403\n00:18:14.859 --> 00:18:17.448\nShe opens up and says hey,\nhow can I help you, right?\n\n404\n00:18:17.448 --> 00:18:21.060\nAnd then that will make its way\ninto your search browser, right?\n\n405\n00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:25.610\nSo you can see here that Cortana\nis already wanting to help me\n\n406\n00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:28.375\nout here by saying greetings, right?\n\n407\n00:18:28.375 --> 00:18:32.750\nAnd rather than having to click\nthe search functionality,\n\n408\n00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:36.080\nI could actually open that up\njust by saying hey, Cortana.\n\n409\n00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:39.018\nAnd again, you can look at some of\nthe keyboard shortcuts here too.\n\n410\n00:18:39.018 --> 00:18:41.858\nThe Windows key+C can open Cortana.\n\n411\n00:18:41.858 --> 00:18:45.919\nNow be careful with this one on the exam,\nI don't know if they're gonna get so\n\n412\n00:18:45.919 --> 00:18:46.866\nspecific on you.\n\n413\n00:18:46.866 --> 00:18:48.859\nBut Dan, I'm gonna challenge you here.\n\n414\n00:18:48.859 --> 00:18:50.785\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; If you remember the Windows 8.1\n\n415\n00:18:50.785 --> 00:18:54.279\nmachine, we used to have this little\nlist that would go from the side and\n\n416\n00:18:54.279 --> 00:18:55.864\nyou would push Windows key+C.\n\n417\n00:18:55.864 --> 00:18:57.230\nDo you remember what menu that was?\n\n418\n00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:58.221\n&gt;&gt; Was that the charms bar?\n\n419\n00:18:58.221 --> 00:19:00.183\n&gt;&gt; Very good man,\nI was trying to throw in a curveball-\n\n420\n00:19:00.183 --> 00:19:00.879\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n421\n00:19:00.879 --> 00:19:01.682\n&gt;&gt; Cuz this wasn't pretty\n\n422\n00:19:01.682 --> 00:19:02.450\nscripted, good job.\n\n423\n00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:04.900\nThat's right,\nit would bring out the charms menu, right?\n\n424\n00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:06.400\nAnd in fact,\nlet me show you what I mean here.\n\n425\n00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.600\nIf we drop back down to\nour Windows machine,\n\n426\n00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.970\nI have my Windows 8.1 machine, all right?\n\n427\n00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:14.796\nAnd if I do a Windows key+C, all right?\n\n428\n00:19:14.796 --> 00:19:16.962\nWhat's gonna end up happening is, and\n\n429\n00:19:16.962 --> 00:19:21.870\nit doesn't look like my Windows key is\nreally working for me, there we go.\n\n430\n00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:24.960\nNotice the charms that slide out\nfrom the right hand side here.\n\n431\n00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.449\nThat's Windows key+C in 8.1.\n\n432\n00:19:27.449 --> 00:19:30.445\nWindows 8, 8.1 is the charms menu, right?\n\n433\n00:19:30.445 --> 00:19:33.970\nHowever, if we do Windows\nkey+C here in Windows 10,\n\n434\n00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:36.740\nthat's gonna bring out the Cortana menu.\n\n435\n00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.670\nI don't think they're gonna\ntrick you on that, but\n\n436\n00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:41.000\nbe aware of the operating system.\n\n437\n00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.066\nYou have to prove that you understand\nsome of the basic functionalities,\n\n438\n00:19:44.066 --> 00:19:45.606\nhence why they call in fundamental.\n\n439\n00:19:45.606 --> 00:19:47.885\nSo just be aware of that little tidbit for\nthe exam,\n\n440\n00:19:47.885 --> 00:19:49.690\nI'm not sure if it will come up, right?\n\n441\n00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:53.240\nNow also, can you interact with\nCortana from the lock screen?\n\n442\n00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.918\nWell, it's up to you, right?\n\n443\n00:19:54.918 --> 00:19:59.025\nDo you want her to access calendars,\nemail, messages, Power BI,\n\n444\n00:19:59.025 --> 00:20:00.621\nthe business analytics.\n\n445\n00:20:00.621 --> 00:20:04.050\nOr business information,\nI can't remember what BI stands for.\n\n446\n00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:08.810\nBut that's all part of things,\nlike Office 365, what language, right?\n\n447\n00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:10.330\nHopefully, it's not profane.\n\n448\n00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:11.744\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Clean language, but\n\n449\n00:20:11.744 --> 00:20:14.010\nyou could see the language\nformat that you want.\n\n450\n00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:17.485\nAs well as things, like Permissions and\nthe History, right?\n\n451\n00:20:17.485 --> 00:20:20.570\nWhat information do you want\nCortana to access, right?\n\n452\n00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:24.170\nYou might be, Dan mentioned earlier,\nin a highly secure environment, right?\n\n453\n00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:25.278\nHe mentioned things, like Flash.\n\n454\n00:20:25.278 --> 00:20:26.410\nWell, guess what?\n\n455\n00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:30.150\nIn a secure environment, maybe you don't\nwant Cortana knowing location, data and\n\n456\n00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:31.900\nto having access to this information.\n\n457\n00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.152\nIt might be something that\nyou wanna disable, right?\n\n458\n00:20:34.152 --> 00:20:35.310\nSafeSearch, right?\n\n459\n00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:38.517\nAnd definitely something I\nwould always implement this,\n\n460\n00:20:38.517 --> 00:20:41.667\nespecially if this was like\nmy kids' computer, right?\n\n461\n00:20:41.667 --> 00:20:42.817\nCloud Search as well.\n\n462\n00:20:42.817 --> 00:20:45.970\nAnd again,\nthings like some of your device's History.\n\n463\n00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:47.476\nNotifications too, right?\n\n464\n00:20:47.476 --> 00:20:51.842\nIf you allow it on your phone, Cortana\ncan tell you on this computer when your\n\n465\n00:20:51.842 --> 00:20:55.610\nbattery is low, right, or\nwhen you miss a text message or a call.\n\n466\n00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:59.028\nSo it has that synchronization,\nright, across devices.\n\n467\n00:20:59.028 --> 00:21:01.776\nAnd then you also have More details too.\n\n468\n00:21:01.776 --> 00:21:04.646\nSo if you wanna know\nabout privacy statements,\n\n469\n00:21:04.646 --> 00:21:08.980\nprivacy options, and\ndetails on how Cortana works with Bing.\n\n470\n00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:12.871\nSo again, you do have some things\nthat you can do to configure Cortana.\n\n471\n00:21:12.871 --> 00:21:13.951\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n472\n00:21:13.951 --> 00:21:19.187\nAnd what permissions that you give Cortana\nonce you give her those permissions?\n\n473\n00:21:19.187 --> 00:21:24.176\nShe is gonna access that information and\nit could be some kinda security concern,\n\n474\n00:21:24.176 --> 00:21:25.390\nif you will.\n\n475\n00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:28.880\nAlso, the other thing too is when\nyou sign into a Microsoft account,\n\n476\n00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.120\nthis increases the personalization.\n\n477\n00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.226\nAnd again, it sounds like you were\nmaking a plug for a Microsoft account,\n\n478\n00:21:34.226 --> 00:21:35.590\nthat's not what we're doing.\n\n479\n00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:38.774\nJust keep in mind when we talk about\ndevice synchronization, right?\n\n480\n00:21:38.774 --> 00:21:40.488\nIf I log into another Windows 10 machine,\n\n481\n00:21:40.488 --> 00:21:42.535\nI might not wanna reconfigure everything,\nright?\n\n482\n00:21:42.535 --> 00:21:45.648\nIf I got a home environment and\nI add another Windows 10 device,\n\n483\n00:21:45.648 --> 00:21:49.385\nI don't wanna go through the process of\nall the settings that we've seen right\n\n484\n00:21:49.385 --> 00:21:50.760\nhere that we can configure.\n\n485\n00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.750\nI've got it configured peaked and\ntweaked right where I want it.\n\n486\n00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:56.040\nI just log into the new device\nwith my Microsoft account.\n\n487\n00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.770\nI synchronize that information\nin things like OneDrive,\n\n488\n00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:00.200\nthings like your Desktop settings.\n\n489\n00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:04.200\nAs well as those Cortana settings\ncan be pulled down to the computer.\n\n490\n00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.430\nAnd again, set it, forget it.\n\n491\n00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:06.710\nSo that's always a great thing to have.\n\n492\n00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:12.509\nAll right, one of the next things I wanna\ntalk about is something known as Hyper-V,\n\n493\n00:22:12.509 --> 00:22:13.194\nall right?\n\n494\n00:22:13.194 --> 00:22:18.538\nNow when it comes to Hyper-V,\nHyper-V is essentially the virtualization\n\n495\n00:22:18.538 --> 00:22:24.395\nsoftware that we utilize to run multiple\ninstances of a Windows operating system.\n\n496\n00:22:24.395 --> 00:22:28.930\nOr other operating systems for\nthat matter on a single physical device.\n\n497\n00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:31.040\nNow I will tell you if we look here,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n498\n00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.459\njump down to our Windows Settings.\n\n499\n00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:37.520\nThis is a feature, an additional feature.\n\n500\n00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:41.110\nAnd what I mean by that is if you go\ninto your options over your Apps and\n\n501\n00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:44.660\nfeatures, you'll notice that\nyou have optional features.\n\n502\n00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.490\nNow this is one of\nthe ones where I tell you,\n\n503\n00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:48.420\nremember we've been talking\nabout two interfaces.\n\n504\n00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:50.380\nWe've been talking about\nthe traditional Control Panel.\n\n505\n00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:55.510\nWe've been talking about Windows settings\nhere inside of this newer interface.\n\n506\n00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:59.180\nThis is where Microsoft is\nkind of caught themselves\n\n507\n00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:01.490\nhaving to support two interfaces, right?\n\n508\n00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:05.221\nBecause if I say Manage optional features,\nand I wanna add a feature,\n\n509\n00:23:05.221 --> 00:23:08.207\nwhich is what Hyper-V is,\nI don't find it in the list.\n\n510\n00:23:08.207 --> 00:23:13.940\nAnd if I say Add a feature, and\nwe wait for it, and we wait for it.\n\n511\n00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:18.563\nAnd if I scroll through here, all these\nare other than Windows Developer Mode or\n\n512\n00:23:18.563 --> 00:23:20.225\nthese are different fonts.\n\n513\n00:23:20.225 --> 00:23:21.270\n&gt;&gt; Nothing to do with Hyper-V.\n\n514\n00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:23.360\n&gt;&gt; Right, nothing to do with Hyper-V.\n\n515\n00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.981\nSo I want you to make sure\nyou're aware of that.\n\n516\n00:23:26.981 --> 00:23:27.658\nBecause again,\n\n517\n00:23:27.658 --> 00:23:30.810\nthis is one of those things where\nthey're kinda supporting two interfaces.\n\n518\n00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:34.570\nIf you notice just above my head here,\nthere's Programs and Features.\n\n519\n00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:37.412\nAnd if I open that, that opens.\n\n520\n00:23:37.412 --> 00:23:41.692\nHey, wouldn't you guess, there's\na traditional Control Panel, all right?\n\n521\n00:23:41.692 --> 00:23:44.013\nNow in Windows 8.1,\nyou're just gonna go here,\n\n522\n00:23:44.013 --> 00:23:45.821\nyou're not gonna have that interface.\n\n523\n00:23:45.821 --> 00:23:47.269\nAnd that's why I wanna show you both.\n\n524\n00:23:47.269 --> 00:23:50.187\nBecause this way not only\napplies to Windows 10, but\n\n525\n00:23:50.187 --> 00:23:52.096\nit also applies to Windows 8.1.\n\n526\n00:23:52.096 --> 00:23:56.550\nAll right, and if I want to turn\non that virtualization capability.\n\n527\n00:23:56.550 --> 00:24:00.440\nIf I want to be able to install more\nthan one virtual machine, right,\n\n528\n00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:05.295\nand run multiple instances of an operating\nsystem all in a single physical device.\n\n529\n00:24:05.295 --> 00:24:08.757\nThen I have to choose turn\nWindows features on or\n\n530\n00:24:08.757 --> 00:24:12.600\noff, and I have to come in here and\nchoose Hyper-V.\n\n531\n00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:16.050\nWhen I open this up, you can see that I\nhave the Hyper-V management tools and\n\n532\n00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:17.280\nthe Hyper-V platform.\n\n533\n00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:21.410\nAnd you can inside of here that\nwe the Hyper-V Hypervisor,\n\n534\n00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:25.680\nwhich is what allows more than\none operating system to basically\n\n535\n00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.500\ncommunicate on one physical device.\n\n536\n00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:32.520\nAnd we choose OK, and then what it does\nis, it searches into the operating system\n\n537\n00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:37.490\nfor those required files to\nadd this optional feature.\n\n538\n00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:39.970\nIt installs that feature, and then what it\n\n539\n00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:44.122\ntypically does when you install Hyper-V\nis, it's gonna require a restart.\n\n540\n00:24:44.122 --> 00:24:47.330\nAll right, as it makes the necessary\nchanges and you can see,\n\n541\n00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:51.040\nWindows needs to reboot your\nPC to finish installing.\n\n542\n00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:55.624\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and\nlet this restart here,\n\n543\n00:24:55.624 --> 00:24:58.890\nand let it finish installing Hyper-V.\n\n544\n00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:03.378\nNow, while that's installing, let's go\nahead and talk about a couple other things\n\n545\n00:25:03.378 --> 00:25:07.510\nthat aren't specific to Windows 10 or\naren't specific to Windows 8.1.\n\n546\n00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:11.970\nAnd that's something known as msconfig,\nTask Manager, and Computer Management.\n\n547\n00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:15.660\nThese are three tools that you\nreally should be familiar with,\n\n548\n00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:19.220\neven it's not just from an exam\nstandpoint, if I could say that.\n\n549\n00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:19.771\n&gt;&gt; You can do it, Wes.\n\n550\n00:25:19.771 --> 00:25:24.332\n&gt;&gt; I can do it, that's right, so\nlet's go ahead and let me show you,\n\n551\n00:25:24.332 --> 00:25:30.060\nI'll tell you what, let's go ahead and\nget into our Windows 8.1 machine here.\n\n552\n00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:35.018\nAnd I'm gonna right click on our taskbar-\n&gt;&gt; I thought you were on the red sun\n\n553\n00:25:35.018 --> 00:25:36.690\nof Krypton, that thing is red [LAUGH].\n\n554\n00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:38.697\n&gt;&gt; It sure is too,\nlet's personalize that and\n\n555\n00:25:38.697 --> 00:25:40.930\nchange that back to\nthe traditional Windows 8.\n\n556\n00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:44.724\nSorry about the burning you guys' retinas\nout there, jeez, criminy, all right.\n\n557\n00:25:44.724 --> 00:25:46.634\n&gt;&gt; Luckily, our night vision is intact.\n\n558\n00:25:46.634 --> 00:25:49.536\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right,\nall I see are these blue dots everywhere.\n\n559\n00:25:49.536 --> 00:25:50.556\n&gt;&gt; That's weird.\n\n560\n00:25:50.556 --> 00:25:52.296\n&gt;&gt; So if I right click on the taskbar,\n\n561\n00:25:52.296 --> 00:25:54.944\nyou'll see that there is\nthis Task Manager option.\n\n562\n00:25:54.944 --> 00:25:58.300\nAnd I'll tell you, it's the same thing\nin Window 7 as well as Windows 10.\n\n563\n00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:02.034\nBut if we open up Task Manager,\nyou will see that, hey,\n\n564\n00:26:02.034 --> 00:26:07.750\n[LAUGH] you won't see anything,\nright, doesn't look all that awesome.\n\n565\n00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:12.180\nBut Task Manager, if I choose more\ndetails, this is a very simplistic\n\n566\n00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:16.600\ndiagnostic service that allows you to\nfind out the processes that are running.\n\n567\n00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:20.100\nIf you have a process that becomes\nproblematic and you need to shut it down,\n\n568\n00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.530\nyou can always highlight it and\nchoose End Task.\n\n569\n00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:24.371\nBe very careful with ending tasks, too,\n\n570\n00:26:24.371 --> 00:26:27.856\nmake sure that you know that the Windows\noperating system doesn't need that.\n\n571\n00:26:27.856 --> 00:26:28.960\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't depend on it.\n\n572\n00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:33.110\n&gt;&gt; That's right, because I've made the\nmistake, yeah, we'll just close it down,\n\n573\n00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:35.513\nand then I can't find my\ndesktop anymore [LAUGH].\n\n574\n00:26:35.513 --> 00:26:38.763\nAnd then, so\nyou also have the Performance tab,\n\n575\n00:26:38.763 --> 00:26:43.361\nthe Performance tab allows you\nthe ability to see just a basic level of\n\n576\n00:26:43.361 --> 00:26:47.104\ninformation on the four major\nresources that you have.\n\n577\n00:26:47.104 --> 00:26:51.222\nAnd again, remember that is your CPU,\nyour memory, your network,\n\n578\n00:26:51.222 --> 00:26:52.859\nas well as your hard drive.\n\n579\n00:26:52.859 --> 00:26:56.721\nAnd potentially Bluetooth in there\nlikewise, and if you have a wireless\n\n580\n00:26:56.721 --> 00:27:00.660\nadapter, it'll say Wi-Fi or\nwireless in here, rather than Ethernet.\n\n581\n00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:04.110\nIt knows that this is a wired connection,\nso that's why it's saying Ethernet.\n\n582\n00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:08.880\nApp history for the modern UI,\nthe Metro UI, if you will.\n\n583\n00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.820\nThose applications,\nthis one is a little more specific,\n\n584\n00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:16.270\nif you will to Windows 8.1,\nbecause of those tile interfaces.\n\n585\n00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:21.350\nAnd it shows you the resource utilization\nof these different applications.\n\n586\n00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:24.590\nNow here's where it gets a little tricky.\n\n587\n00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:31.220\nOne of the things that we have to worry\nabout for the exam is this Startup tab.\n\n588\n00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:34.716\nLet me show you the Startup tab here.\n\n589\n00:27:34.716 --> 00:27:39.598\nThe Startup tab here in Windows\n8.1 is in Task Manager, all right,\n\n590\n00:27:39.598 --> 00:27:41.690\nthat is newer, if you will.\n\n591\n00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:46.560\nBecause if I switch over to my Windows\n7 machine, and we'll do the same thing,\n\n592\n00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.180\nwe're gonna launch up Task Manager.\n\n593\n00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:50.990\nAnd you'll notice for the most part,\ndoing the same thing, right?\n\n594\n00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:54.450\nClicking on the taskbar,\nchoosing Start Task Manager.\n\n595\n00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:58.270\nNotice that the interface is\na little bit different, all right?\n\n596\n00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:01.070\nNotice that Performance,\nwe only have CPU and memory, and\n\n597\n00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:02.950\nNetworking is in\na separate tab altogether.\n\n598\n00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:06.180\nThey said, you know what, these are all\nresources, let's put it into a single tab,\n\n599\n00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:10.490\nright, make it a little bit\nmore simplified, right?\n\n600\n00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:15.100\nServices, Performance, but\nI don't have a Startup tab.\n\n601\n00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:19.280\nWell, that's where I'd like to bring in\nanother utility that we also have to talk\n\n602\n00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.240\nabout, and that's msconfig.\n\n603\n00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.520\nNow, you can choose the Start menu or\nyou can do a Windows key R\n\n604\n00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:28.260\nto bring up the traditional Windows run\nline, it depends on how you wanna do this.\n\n605\n00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:32.880\nAnd you could type msconfig,\nand I can tell you,\n\n606\n00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:39.070\nWindows now can understand without\nputting the .exe on the end of it.\n\n607\n00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:43.040\nIn earlier, like Vista and prior,\nit didn't understand that, so technically,\n\n608\n00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:46.420\nyou don't really have to put the EXE, but-\n&gt;&gt; Old habits die hard.\n\n609\n00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:47.502\n&gt;&gt; They really do.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n610\n00:28:47.502 --> 00:28:48.983\n&gt;&gt; And I want you to notice that,\n\n611\n00:28:48.983 --> 00:28:53.390\nin System Configuration, it's also in the\nAdministrative Tools, we call it MS Info.\n\n612\n00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:55.770\nI can define how the computer starts up,\nand\n\n613\n00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:58.540\nI can modify the boot process if I want.\n\n614\n00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:03.040\nWhether it's for diagnostic purposes and\ngo into a safe mode.\n\n615\n00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:06.490\nLook at the services that\nare already starting up, and\n\n616\n00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:08.510\nwhether they're starting up or not.\n\n617\n00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:10.310\nAnd then there's the Startup tab,\n\n618\n00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:13.840\nnotice the Startup tab is\nin msconfig in Windows 7.\n\n619\n00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:18.270\nBut if I look in the Task Manager,\nI don't see the Startup tab.\n\n620\n00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:21.945\nSee, applications will\nstart themselves at boot.\n\n621\n00:29:21.945 --> 00:29:24.765\nAnd sometimes that can\nhave an adverse effect on\n\n622\n00:29:24.765 --> 00:29:26.675\nthe performance of the boot cycle,\nthe boot process.\n\n623\n00:29:26.675 --> 00:29:29.225\nSo you might want to come in here, and\n\n624\n00:29:29.225 --> 00:29:31.865\nI'm not going to disable\nthese based on what they are.\n\n625\n00:29:31.865 --> 00:29:33.235\nThere's a security client here,\n\n626\n00:29:33.235 --> 00:29:38.465\nI don't ever want to disable things\nlike anti-malware technologies.\n\n627\n00:29:38.465 --> 00:29:44.090\nBut I could increase the performance\nof the boot time if I disable these.\n\n628\n00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:47.751\nHere's, that's the long drawn out\nversion to get back to the point.\n\n629\n00:29:47.751 --> 00:29:49.936\n&gt;&gt; That's like saying,\nthese brakes are just so heavy on my car,\n\n630\n00:29:49.936 --> 00:29:50.980\nI'm just gonna rip them out.\n\n631\n00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:52.834\n&gt;&gt; Hey, we'll just get rid of them, right?\n\n632\n00:29:52.834 --> 00:29:53.912\n&gt;&gt; Don't do that [LAUGH].\n\n633\n00:29:53.912 --> 00:29:57.214\n&gt;&gt; Don't do that, [LAUGH] and\nhere's the major point in this.\n\n634\n00:29:57.214 --> 00:30:03.710\nIs that when Windows 8 came out, 8.1 and\nWindows 10, they said, you know what?\n\n635\n00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:07.250\nWe're just gonna put that Startup\ntab right there in Task Manager.\n\n636\n00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:10.830\nIn fact, let me show you what I mean,\nif I type in msconfig,\n\n637\n00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:16.510\nnotice I'm not gonna type in EXE like\nI said, msconfig still comes up.\n\n638\n00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:20.394\nYou're gonna say, well, wait a second Wes,\nyou're a liar, there's a Startup tab,\n\n639\n00:30:20.394 --> 00:30:21.770\nlet's check out what it says.\n\n640\n00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:25.400\nTo manage startup items,\nuse the Startup section of Task Manager.\n\n641\n00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.962\nThat is something that, for\n\n642\n00:30:27.962 --> 00:30:33.100\nthe longest time we were\nmanaging it in our task manager.\n\n643\n00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:36.114\nExcuse me,\nwe used to do it through msconfig, today,\n\n644\n00:30:36.114 --> 00:30:39.530\nwe do it through Task Manager,\nright, so that is important.\n\n645\n00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:44.510\nUnderstand that what\nSystem Configuration slash msinfo does,\n\n646\n00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:47.480\nas well as what Task Manager does, right?\n\n647\n00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:51.460\nWe've also got the User tab, we can see\nwho is currently logged on to the machine,\n\n648\n00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:52.505\nas well as the details.\n\n649\n00:30:52.505 --> 00:30:56.115\nNow, details and\nprocesses look a lot the same, right?\n\n650\n00:30:56.115 --> 00:30:59.155\nSo what's the difference\nbetween a process and details?\n\n651\n00:30:59.155 --> 00:31:02.515\nWell, notice how processes will,\nor processes,\n\n652\n00:31:02.515 --> 00:31:05.805\nhowever you're supposed to say that,\nwill collapse themselves.\n\n653\n00:31:05.805 --> 00:31:10.665\nYou can have more than one process that is\nbundled under a functionality, a service,\n\n654\n00:31:10.665 --> 00:31:11.940\nor application.\n\n655\n00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:12.720\nDetail says,\n\n656\n00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:16.250\ndon't collapse them, show me every\nsingle thing that is running right now.\n\n657\n00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:21.050\nAnd show me things like its processor ID,\nprocessor identification status,\n\n658\n00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:22.750\nusername, CPU, memory.\n\n659\n00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:26.940\nSo give me, hence, the details,\nI want detailed information, right.\n\n660\n00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:31.040\nAs well as, you have the Services tab,\njust like you've had for\n\n661\n00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.560\na long time in Task Manager.\n\n662\n00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:37.073\nAnd I could, if I wanted to,\nI could manipulate the service.\n\n663\n00:31:37.073 --> 00:31:41.528\nStart it up, stop it,\nI could find out, hey, what is this?\n\n664\n00:31:41.528 --> 00:31:44.995\nI could search it online, I could even\nopen the services console from here.\n\n665\n00:31:44.995 --> 00:31:48.451\nAnd I could get the services\nconsole loaded, and\n\n666\n00:31:48.451 --> 00:31:51.240\nyou can also launch it down here, too.\n\n667\n00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:54.890\nSo, couple of real cool things you can do.\n\n668\n00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:59.020\nLast but not least, let's log back in and\njust show you the Hyper-V interface.\n\n669\n00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.870\nHowever, keep in mind what Hyper-V does.\n\n670\n00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:04.710\nIt allows you to perform virtualization\non your client rather than having to have\n\n671\n00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:09.710\na server operating system to\nvirtualize your operating systems.\n\n672\n00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:12.120\nAnd we do this more on the client side for\ntesting purposes.\n\n673\n00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:14.120\nWe don't really use this in\na production environment but\n\n674\n00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:17.470\nit is important to keep in mind.\n\n675\n00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:21.310\nAnd if I decide now I can type in hyperv.\n\n676\n00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:25.930\nAnd I can look at the Hyper-V Manager,\nand this would give me the ability to now\n\n677\n00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:30.510\nstart adding virtual machines, to create\nvirtual machines, to install more than one\n\n678\n00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:34.490\noperating system, and allow them to\ncommunicate amongst each other, right?\n\n679\n00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:35.720\nSo know Hyper-V.\n\n680\n00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.740\nNow if you want more advanced\ninformation about Hyper-V,\n\n681\n00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:44.265\ndefinitely check out our MCSA course where\nwe talk about Hyper-V a lot more in depth.\n\n682\n00:32:44.265 --> 00:32:46.771\nDan's looking at me like it is time.\n\n683\n00:32:46.771 --> 00:32:49.565\nI'm gonna pull a column on you and\nsay about one more thing, and\n\n684\n00:32:49.565 --> 00:32:52.430\nthen we will wrap this one up,\nand that is computer management.\n\n685\n00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:55.380\nLet's go ahead and\ndive down to our Windows 10 machine here.\n\n686\n00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:58.530\nAnd I'm gonna type in computer.\n\n687\n00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:02.460\nAnd you will see that we have computer\nmanagement, and we kinda talked about\n\n688\n00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:06.510\nthis in the administrative tools section,\nwhere we talked about control panel.\n\n689\n00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:10.000\nBut I just want to kind of recap\nthat computer management is a great\n\n690\n00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.900\nplace that kind of bundles some\nof the major utilities and\n\n691\n00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:17.070\nfunctionality that you need to\nadminister to a Windows environment.\n\n692\n00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:18.583\nWe have Task Scheduler, right?\n\n693\n00:33:18.583 --> 00:33:20.040\nWe have Event Viewer.\n\n694\n00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:23.387\nWe've talked about these in other\nepisodes, so definitely go back and\n\n695\n00:33:23.387 --> 00:33:24.630\ncheck those out, right?\n\n696\n00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:28.618\nEvent Viewer I can track some of the\nsystem wide activities through logs that\n\n697\n00:33:28.618 --> 00:33:32.731\nare created, whether it's application\ninstallations, security events,\n\n698\n00:33:32.731 --> 00:33:33.617\nsystem events.\n\n699\n00:33:33.617 --> 00:33:36.353\nLike for instance,\nif I wanna find out what has gone on,\n\n700\n00:33:36.353 --> 00:33:40.211\nwhat events have gone on, I could see\nthings like errors, warnings, right?\n\n701\n00:33:40.211 --> 00:33:43.522\nI can be familiar with the logs,\nand services, and\n\n702\n00:33:43.522 --> 00:33:47.310\nusers that are interacting\nwith the computer here.\n\n703\n00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:52.410\nAnd then, I can do research if I\nfind that issues that are happening.\n\n704\n00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:54.600\nI can go out and\nI can research these events online,\n\n705\n00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:59.610\ntry to find some information to help\nme solve whatever the issue might be.\n\n706\n00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:01.400\nAs well as Shared Folders.\n\n707\n00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.950\nShared resources we'll talk about that in\nanother episode, what the shares are as\n\n708\n00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:09.310\nwell as manage and maintain the local\nusers and groups on this machine.\n\n709\n00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:12.647\nIn a corporate environment, typically\nwe do that with Active Directory.\n\n710\n00:34:12.647 --> 00:34:15.873\nBut if you're in a work group environment\nwhere it's completely decentralized,\n\n711\n00:34:15.873 --> 00:34:17.301\nyou only have a couple of computers,\n\n712\n00:34:17.301 --> 00:34:20.280\nyou can manage your user accounts\nin groups through this interface.\n\n713\n00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:23.080\nPerformance, Performance Monitor\nwhich we've also talked in our\n\n714\n00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:25.450\nadministrative tools, as well.\n\n715\n00:34:25.450 --> 00:34:29.910\nKeep in mind that this is just\nallows me to monitor different\n\n716\n00:34:29.910 --> 00:34:33.580\ncomponents within the system and\nfind out are they performing adequately?\n\n717\n00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:34.380\nAre they having issues?\n\n718\n00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:35.410\nRight?\n\n719\n00:34:35.410 --> 00:34:38.040\nThis is where we can set\nperformance baselines.\n\n720\n00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:38.720\nDevice Manager.\n\n721\n00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:40.730\nDevice manager, great utility to have.\n\n722\n00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:43.580\nThis is where you can\nfind out what devices,\n\n723\n00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:47.580\nphysical hardware devices are connected\nto the machines, and manage and\n\n724\n00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:52.320\nmaintain their drivers by just taking\na device, selecting it, Right-Click.\n\n725\n00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:56.730\nYou can choose update the driver, you\ncould turn the device off if you wanted.\n\n726\n00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:58.890\nYou can go a little bit further,\nchoose Properties,\n\n727\n00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:01.510\nand you can see the location\nby choosing the Driver tab.\n\n728\n00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:04.450\nYou can see things like\nthe Driver Details,\n\n729\n00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:09.725\nas well as the current Bio version,\nan your drivers up to date?\n\n730\n00:35:09.725 --> 00:35:11.525\nIt's a great way to find out, right?\n\n731\n00:35:11.525 --> 00:35:13.795\nAnd then as well as\nupdate the drivers too.\n\n732\n00:35:13.795 --> 00:35:14.815\nYou can update the drivers.\n\n733\n00:35:14.815 --> 00:35:17.277\nYou can either have a driver\nthat you point to locally,\n\n734\n00:35:17.277 --> 00:35:20.155\neither to USB thumb drive or\nyou can say, you know what?\n\n735\n00:35:20.155 --> 00:35:23.260\nGo ahead and search online and\nwhat happens is the operating system\n\n736\n00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:25.180\nreaches out to your\nWindows update servers and\n\n737\n00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:29.270\ntries to find out if it's got\nthe current latest and greatest drivers.\n\n738\n00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:30.690\nSo great little utility there.\n\n739\n00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:31.426\nDisk Management,\n\n740\n00:35:31.426 --> 00:35:34.192\nwe will definitely be looking a little\nbit more disk management later.\n\n741\n00:35:34.192 --> 00:35:37.831\nThis a way that you could manage and\nmaintain the hard drives and the storage\n\n742\n00:35:37.831 --> 00:35:41.474\ndevices that are connected to the machine\nincluding creating managing and\n\n743\n00:35:41.474 --> 00:35:46.170\nmaintaining things like partitions here\ninside of the Windows operating system.\n\n744\n00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:47.550\nLast but certainly not least,\n\n745\n00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:49.930\nis the Services console that we've\nkind of already talked about.\n\n746\n00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:51.840\nThis allows me the ability to manage and\n\n747\n00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:55.250\nmaintain the background processes that\nare running, including starting and\n\n748\n00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:58.660\nstopping them, restarting them,\nand disabling them if I need to.\n\n749\n00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:01.970\nWMI Control,\nI really wouldn't worry about that.\n\n750\n00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:03.810\nI think that's well beyond\nthe scope of this exam.\n\n751\n00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:05.770\nBut it's called\nWindows Management Instrumentation.\n\n752\n00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:11.630\nIt's kind of Microsoft's version of SMNP,\nor not SMNP, but yeah, SMNP.\n\n753\n00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:16.130\nBut, this is a way that you can\nbasically control any little fine point\n\n754\n00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:18.150\nof the operating system\nbased on an attribute.\n\n755\n00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:22.270\nBut, you don't really have to worry\nabout WMI Controls cuz like I said,\n\n756\n00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:24.160\nit's well beyond the scope of this exam.\n\n757\n00:36:25.162 --> 00:36:27.970\nThese are some of the utilities,\nthe native applications and\n\n758\n00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:30.670\ntools which you can find inside\nof your Windows operating system.\n\n759\n00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:34.450\nAnd keep in mind, you should be aware\nof this when you set that MTA exam.\n\n760\n00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:35.200\n&gt;&gt; Great stuff Wes.\n\n761\n00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:38.730\nObviously, our Windows operating system\nhas a plenty of tools and are ready for\n\n762\n00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:41.610\nus to be able to administrate or\njust work with the system.\n\n763\n00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:42.850\nMake it do the things that we need to do.\n\n764\n00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:45.390\nOr maybe even troubleshoot\nproblems that are occurring.\n\n765\n00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:47.840\nSo be familiar with all of those\nthat Wes has walked us through.\n\n766\n00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.600\nThere are a bunch of hidden gems in there.\n\n767\n00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:54.079\nAnd you want to have some familiarity,\neven some experience,\n\n768\n00:36:54.079 --> 00:36:57.130\nif it all possible\nbefore you sit the exam.\n\n769\n00:36:57.130 --> 00:36:59.440\nIt's gonna help you out a lot when\nit comes to scenario based types\n\n770\n00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.315\nof questions.\n\n771\n00:37:00.315 --> 00:37:03.540\nWes, we thank you for your time in this\nepisode but we are out of time, so\n\n772\n00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:04.310\nwe're gonna call it a day.\n\n773\n00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:07.160\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n774\n00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:07.990\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n775\n00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:10.363\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n776\n00:37:10.363 --> 00:37:16.128\n[MUSIC]\n\n777\n00:37:16.128 --> 00:37:18.150\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.127\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.127 --> 00:00:12.319\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello and\n\n5\n00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:16.400\nthank you for watching ITProTV, empowering\nthe world with engaging learning.\n\n6\n00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.200\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we continue\non with MTA Windows OS Fundamentals.\n\n7\n00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.290\nAnd we're gonna be configuring mobile\nsettings with the one and only,\n\n8\n00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.098\nWes Bryan and he's right there.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, how are you doing,\n\n9\n00:00:28.098 --> 00:00:28.730\nZach?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n10\n00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.040\n&gt;&gt; Great to be here as always and\n\n11\n00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.300\nyou know what's interesting Zach is,\nwe've actually kinda tackled most of\n\n12\n00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.810\nthe objectives in the configuring\nmobility settings, right?\n\n13\n00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.880\nSo let me tell you what those objectives\nare and I'll tell you what we're really,\n\n14\n00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.400\njust kind of coming back here maybe\na little bit shorter of an episode and\n\n15\n00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.710\nrounding out what we're doing, right?\n\n16\n00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.900\nSo in the configuring mobility setting,\nthey talk about RDP, and\n\n17\n00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.120\nI'll come back with that acronym.\n\n18\n00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.815\nI'm not gonna hit you with\nalphabet soup right away.\n\n19\n00:00:50.815 --> 00:00:55.430\nBut they talk about RDP, Widows\nMobility Center and the Sync Center.\n\n20\n00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.297\nAll right, we've already talked about\nthe Sync Center in the context of other\n\n21\n00:00:58.297 --> 00:01:00.130\nepisodes because they\ntalk about offline files.\n\n22\n00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.150\nAnd really today Sync Center\nis one of those things.\n\n23\n00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.810\nIt's kinda going by the wayside,\nbecause they had,\n\n24\n00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.490\nif you check out our Windows 10 shows,\n\n25\n00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.010\nmore specifically the MCSA stuff with\nMike, Rodrick, and Ms. Cherokee Boose.\n\n26\n00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.057\nYou'll learn from their episodes that\nthere's an application that's actually,\n\n27\n00:01:17.057 --> 00:01:20.021\nthey're trying to push for\nWindows 10 that'll allow you to\n\n28\n00:01:20.021 --> 00:01:22.942\nsynchronize phones with, and\nlink your phones to your PCs.\n\n29\n00:01:22.942 --> 00:01:26.862\nAnd you'll always see, or a lot of times\nyou'll see little heads up notifications\n\n30\n00:01:26.862 --> 00:01:29.662\nthat little thought bubble comes out and\nit's says, hey,\n\n31\n00:01:29.662 --> 00:01:33.530\nlink your phone to your PC where there's\na specific app that they're doing that.\n\n32\n00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.227\nThey're kinda pushing things center off to\nthe side, so in the context of using it,\n\n33\n00:01:38.227 --> 00:01:41.536\nwe really took care of it when\nwe were talking about files and\n\n34\n00:01:41.536 --> 00:01:43.937\nhow we do things like folder redirection.\n\n35\n00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:48.090\nSo the other thing was RDP,\nthat's the Remote Desktop Protocol, or\n\n36\n00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.170\nRemote Desktop.\n\n37\n00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.100\nAnd we've also talked about\nthat in the context of\n\n38\n00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.920\nbeing able to support end users.\n\n39\n00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.560\nPersonally, I don't feel that it's\nspecific to mobile devices or\n\n40\n00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.730\nspecific to laptops.\n\n41\n00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.120\nI could see where you'd use it in\na context of an enterprise environment.\n\n42\n00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.170\nYou've got somebody that is a\ntelecommuter, maybe somebody working from\n\n43\n00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.150\nhome, maybe I need to get into a computer,\nthey use a laptop.\n\n44\n00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.450\nI can see where that comes in handy but\nwe use RDP for configuring remotely,\n\n45\n00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.500\nconfiguring servers a lot of times, for\n\n46\n00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.460\nremotely configuring\ndesktops as well as laptops.\n\n47\n00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.674\nSo, as far as the context\nof mobility settings goes,\n\n48\n00:02:22.674 --> 00:02:26.180\nreally RDP could be anywhere,\nand not just in mobility.\n\n49\n00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.125\nSo what we're gonna focus on today is\ngonna be the Windows Mobility Center.\n\n50\n00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:29.730\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n51\n00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.070\nconfiguring your mobile devices to your\nPC sounds great, but there's a security\n\n52\n00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.210\nconcern, I would think, isn't there?\n&gt;&gt; There can be,\n\n53\n00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.100\nand what they're doing is\nthey're making it a lot easier.\n\n54\n00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.640\nYes, there would be a security concern,\nand I'll take the Android devices.\n\n55\n00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.230\nAgain, we'll see how far Windows Mobile\ntype operating systems go.\n\n56\n00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.460\nThey're out there but again, they're not\nreally prevalent as much as they are like\n\n57\n00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.970\niOS devices and Android devices.\n\n58\n00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.460\nAnd you have to configure your device\n\n59\n00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.400\nin a way that'll allow you to\nconnect it to your computer and\n\n60\n00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.840\nyou have to change the settings, so\nit's not just powering the device.\n\n61\n00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.460\nSo it could potentially\nbe a security issue.\n\n62\n00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.520\nHowever, that's one of the reasons\nyou're gonna wanna use things like your\n\n63\n00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.230\nWindows Store apps or again,\n\n64\n00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.550\nI know this isn't an iOS by\nany means show, or Android.\n\n65\n00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.490\nYou're gonna wanna use those markets that\n\n66\n00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.010\nare using the legitimate\nmobile app stores, right?\n\n67\n00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.600\nCuz, typically what happens in\nthose stores is those devices,\n\n68\n00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.560\nand this goes with Windows or\nMicrosoft if you will, Apple and Android.\n\n69\n00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.930\nSometimes, it gets a little shaky on\nthe Android side because there's so\n\n70\n00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.480\nmuch development that goes on there, that\nyou almost have to configure your device\n\n71\n00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.250\nin a way that reduces\nthe security to begin with.\n\n72\n00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.299\nSo if you're worried\nabout a security aspect,\n\n73\n00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.530\nI would say definitely use the\napplications because then, you don't have\n\n74\n00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.978\nto reduce your security in order to use\nthat functionality which up until then.\n\n75\n00:03:44.978 --> 00:03:49.644\nA lot of times up until now, you really\nhad to do that so I'm not too worried\n\n76\n00:03:49.644 --> 00:03:53.725\nabout the other objectives,\ncuz we've already covered them.\n\n77\n00:03:53.725 --> 00:03:55.145\nSo what are we gonna cover?\n\n78\n00:03:55.145 --> 00:03:58.405\nWe're gonna cover the Windows Mobility\nCenter, a long, drawn-out intro there, so\n\n79\n00:03:58.405 --> 00:03:58.925\nlet's go ahead.\n\n80\n00:03:58.925 --> 00:04:00.075\nWe'll just dive right into it.\n\n81\n00:04:00.075 --> 00:04:02.460\nLet me show you,\nI've got a Windows 10 machine here.\n\n82\n00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.110\nAnd there's a few ways that you\ncan get to the Mobility Center,\n\n83\n00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.730\ntypically you're not going through.\n\n84\n00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.301\nIf I just right-click on our little\nWindows icon here, and I choose Settings,\n\n85\n00:04:11.301 --> 00:04:14.022\nyou're gonna see that you're\nnot really doing too much with\n\n86\n00:04:14.022 --> 00:04:15.640\nthe Windows Mobility Center here.\n\n87\n00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.060\nBut if I go to System, and\nwe look through here, right?\n\n88\n00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.622\nWe have Remote Desktop which\nwe've already talked about.\n\n89\n00:04:21.622 --> 00:04:23.700\nAgain remember,\na way to connect to another machine.\n\n90\n00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.410\nIf I turn Remote Desktop on this machine,\n\n91\n00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.590\nthat doesn't say that I can\nconnect to another machine.\n\n92\n00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:29.900\nNow that's one thing that I will say.\n\n93\n00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.580\nWhen you turn remote desktop\non on your local machine here,\n\n94\n00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.330\nI'm saying Zach you can,\nin a support environment,\n\n95\n00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.420\nyou can connect back over to my machine\nand if you're the support technician,\n\n96\n00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.470\nyou can take control of the desktops and\nconfigure my computer.\n\n97\n00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.260\nBattery life, I'm gonna talk a little bit,\nyup there we go, I'm gonna talk\n\n98\n00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.200\na little bit about battery life here\nbecause it's not in the objectives but,\n\n99\n00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.580\nyou better believe that it has something\nto do with configuring mobility settings.\n\n100\n00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.120\nCuz remember,\n\n101\n00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.100\nin a mobile environment we're really\nworried about two major things, all right?\n\n102\n00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.450\nBattery life,\npower consumption if you will, and\n\n103\n00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.040\nthermal management, overheating, right?\n\n104\n00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.590\nBecause the hotter things get,\nthe more your fans spin up.\n\n105\n00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.790\nAnd even though they're a heat\nexchange radiator type system,\n\n106\n00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.360\nthat's gonna cause power, right?\n\n107\n00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.550\nYou're gonna chew up some power.\n\n108\n00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.780\nSo those fans kinda ramp\nup to control the heat.\n\n109\n00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.130\nSo it's kinda like that Achilles' heel.\n\n110\n00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.450\nSo those are the two big things that we\nreally are concerned about, battery life\n\n111\n00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:28.360\nor power consumption if you will, and\nthen also your good thermal management.\n\n112\n00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.250\nSo we'll come back to battery usage here\nin a bit, and we'll look at that as well.\n\n113\n00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.738\nNow, when it comes to the mobility center,\nyou might have seen,\n\n114\n00:05:35.738 --> 00:05:37.470\nyou could have just pause the video,\nright.\n\n115\n00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.714\nAnd on my Windows 7, wrong operating\nsystem on my Windows 10 desktop,\n\n116\n00:05:42.714 --> 00:05:47.460\nif we look second down from the top,\nwe'll see mobility center.\n\n117\n00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.710\nAll right, now if you don't see this,\nwhy might you not see this, okay?\n\n118\n00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.230\nWell, when you install Windows,\none of the things that happens is,\n\n119\n00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.470\nit gathers a profile, a hardware profile.\n\n120\n00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.610\nDuring the installation, it says,\nokay, what hardware do I have?\n\n121\n00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.510\nBecause it needs to know\nwhat drivers do I bring\n\n122\n00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.710\nover during the installation\nprocess to get you up and running.\n\n123\n00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.300\nWell, it also will detect the back\nthat the battery is present, right,\n\n124\n00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:17.540\na mobile battery versus a desktop\nthat's plugged into an external outlet.\n\n125\n00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.640\nIt also detects that, it says I don't\nneed to be a mobile operating system.\n\n126\n00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.166\nSo I'm not gonna install a provision,\nthe mobility center within this machine,\n\n127\n00:06:26.166 --> 00:06:28.035\nwhich is why you might not see it.\n\n128\n00:06:28.035 --> 00:06:30.840\nSo right now, if you're right-clicking,\nyou're watching this video, and\n\n129\n00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.110\nyou're right-clicking on your Windows\ncharm, and you don't see Mobility Center?\n\n130\n00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.210\nYou're on a desktop, all right?\n\n131\n00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.430\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n132\n00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.750\nBut once you get to the Mobility Center,\nit hasn't changed much.\n\n133\n00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:42.710\nAnd in fact, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n134\n00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.240\nminimize our settings here,\nthe new Windows settings UI.\n\n135\n00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:52.050\nBut when it comes to the Mobility Center,\nZach, we haven't really changed much.\n\n136\n00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.360\nI say, I haven't changed anything.\n\n137\n00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.580\nIt's Microsoft that's doing this.\n\n138\n00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.630\nAnd it's a very familiar product for\n\n139\n00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.730\nthe people that have been using this,\nagain, for a very long time.\n\n140\n00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:05.050\nNow, I could make our job really easy and\nlet you go do the work.\n\n141\n00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.390\nBut notice the little\nquestion mark right there?\n\n142\n00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.180\nI don't know if I have internet\nconnection here on this one.\n\n143\n00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.851\nYeah, looks I do.\nOkay, so you can always, and\n\n144\n00:07:12.851 --> 00:07:15.840\nI'm not gonna read the website to you.\n\n145\n00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.680\nYeah, okay so it will take some of the\ncategories and stuff that you can see, and\n\n146\n00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.840\nI would recommend using these for\nyour study purposes.\n\n147\n00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.368\nAnd that's really the one reason I pulled\nout there is because the fact that\n\n148\n00:07:28.368 --> 00:07:32.065\nthis little question mark here it can\nreally, really help you to gain some more\n\n149\n00:07:32.065 --> 00:07:35.450\ninformation not only on how to\nsupport your Windows operating system.\n\n150\n00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:38.395\nBut performance tweaks,\nand tips and tricks,\n\n151\n00:07:38.395 --> 00:07:43.630\ntweaks if you will that can also help you\nto optimize your Windows operating system.\n\n152\n00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:44.930\nIn the process of doing that,\n\n153\n00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.920\nwhat you're also doing is really\ngetting used to the operating system.\n\n154\n00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.862\nGetting used to the Windows\n10 environment,\n\n155\n00:07:50.862 --> 00:07:54.610\nwhich is something that is gonna make\nyou extremely successful on your exam,\n\n156\n00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.570\nshould you sit that exam,\nso do wanna mention that.\n\n157\n00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.450\nBut let's just talk real briefly\nabout each one of these settings.\n\n158\n00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:04.425\nThe great thing is, every one of these\nsettings are clickable and it's kinda\n\n159\n00:08:04.425 --> 00:08:08.300\nlike, we've jumped around before here,\nright, all roads lead to Rome.\n\n160\n00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.515\nRight, if I start at Rome and go back,\n\n161\n00:08:10.515 --> 00:08:14.930\nwe can get to any place pretty much\nin the West, if you will at one time.\n\n162\n00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:20.240\nWell, Mobility Center basically consider\nit kinda like the nexus or the central\n\n163\n00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:26.140\nhub for the most mobile, this is gonna get\nredundant, mobile centric settings, right?\n\n164\n00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.870\nWell, you don't know where those\nsettings are within the Control Panel.\n\n165\n00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:33.370\nI could if I wanted to,\nI could go back to the Windows Setting UI.\n\n166\n00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:36.840\nRight, like we've done before and\nwe're in the system here, right?\n\n167\n00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:42.180\nAnd I could go to open up the traditional\ncontrol panel, right, and then we could\n\n168\n00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:46.110\nlook through here and we could try to find\nsome of the different things that we need\n\n169\n00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:51.510\nto configure and maintain usability and\nstability of the mobile settings, right?\n\n170\n00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:53.790\nBut that's a lot of work, right?\n\n171\n00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.060\nIt's not a lot of work,\n\n172\n00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:59.540\nI know, I'm sitting here whining like it's\nthat big of a deal to click some buttons.\n\n173\n00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:04.570\nBut, imagine you don't know where\nthose are and maybe you don't, right?\n\n174\n00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:12.220\nWouldn't it be nice, I wanna manipulate\nand control my brightness settings.\n\n175\n00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.950\nI don't know where\nthe display settings are.\n\n176\n00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.803\nHere's little help too, if you right-click\non your desktop [LAUGH], they are also\n\n177\n00:09:16.803 --> 00:09:19.565\nright there, just don't [INAUDIBLE].\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n178\n00:09:19.565 --> 00:09:20.725\n&gt;&gt; But the point being is,\n\n179\n00:09:20.725 --> 00:09:24.557\nin a mobile setting, you might have\na touch interface, maybe you don't wanna\n\n180\n00:09:24.557 --> 00:09:28.290\npress and hold to see the right click\nto turn around, and press that button.\n\n181\n00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.550\nWell, I can click this one button,\nand guess what?\n\n182\n00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:34.320\nIt shows me, it takes me right\ninto the power options and\n\n183\n00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.160\nthat's why I wanted to come back to\npower options, even though technically,\n\n184\n00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.650\nthey're not here in the objectives that we\nare covering right now, they should be.\n\n185\n00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:43.920\nThat's just my personal opinion because\nof the fact that power options are how we\n\n186\n00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.460\ncontrol what the power consumption is,\nversus what the performance and\n\n187\n00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.740\nthe balance nature between the two,\nshould we need those, right.\n\n188\n00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.390\nSo I can get to my power options\nright here, just by display.\n\n189\n00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:57.510\nNotice that if I was connected\nto an external display,\n\n190\n00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:59.600\nwe could toggle between those.\n\n191\n00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.065\nAnd that's great too,\nbecause some of you might remember, and\n\n192\n00:10:02.065 --> 00:10:05.150\nZach, you might remember this too,\nback in the earlier days of laptops, and\n\n193\n00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:09.530\nI'm not talking when laptops were $10,000,\nand they were size of a briefcase.\n\n194\n00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:14.340\nBut what I mean is just relatively recent,\nI would say within the last ten years.\n\n195\n00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:18.140\nYou might remember, you had to\nactually physically toggle a switch\n\n196\n00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.030\nif you were presenting\nto an external monitor.\n\n197\n00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:22.742\nAnd you had to have that hard\ncoded tactile button, right,\n\n198\n00:10:22.742 --> 00:10:23.780\nto switch in between.\n\n199\n00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:24.480\nWhat if you don't want that?\n\n200\n00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.922\nWhat if you're on a touch screen,\ngiving a presentation, you touch it and\n\n201\n00:10:27.922 --> 00:10:32.320\nnow you configure it, you don't have to\nworry about where these settings are.\n\n202\n00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.390\nInterestingly enough, it let's me\nknow I'm fully charged here, but\n\n203\n00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:38.370\nwould you imagine if I hover over that,\nwhere that's gonna take me?\n\n204\n00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:39.600\n&gt;&gt; Around to the power setting.\n\n205\n00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.783\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My problem to the power\n\n206\n00:10:40.783 --> 00:10:41.800\nsettings, right.\n\n207\n00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.820\nAnd even though we're kinda joking\naround here, I just want you to know.\n\n208\n00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.540\nAs I was coming up,\nthere was a student within Windows.\n\n209\n00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:53.180\nYou will hear, we probably some of our\nother edutainers will say the same thing.\n\n210\n00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:57.975\nHover to discover, left to select,\nright for effect, right?\n\n211\n00:10:57.975 --> 00:11:00.660\nRight-click gives you what you can do,\nright?\n\n212\n00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.510\nYou hover over it,\nyou can discover what you do.\n\n213\n00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.310\nLeft click you actually select, right?\n\n214\n00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:09.220\nSo if I choose this, maybe I don't know\nwhere the power options are, right?\n\n215\n00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.240\nWell, we've got two buttons that get\nus right to where we need to go.\n\n216\n00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.270\nIf I wanna configure power plans as well.\n\n217\n00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:21.040\nFor instance, I might wanna be able to\ncontrol when the computer sleeps, right?\n\n218\n00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.740\nAnd I'm not worried so\nmuch on battery, maybe you are.\n\n219\n00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.040\nI'm sorry plugged in, not so\nmuch worried about plugged in.\n\n220\n00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.920\nBut maybe you are worried about battery,\nright.\n\n221\n00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.280\nMaybe you want to turn the display off,\nput the computer to sleep.\n\n222\n00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:37.600\nMaybe this isn't granular enough for you.\n\n223\n00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.240\nSo you can always get in here and\nchange the advanced settings.\n\n224\n00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.350\nAnd now,\nwhat you can do is come in here, and\n\n225\n00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:47.272\nyou can essentially configure each one of\nyour PowerPlay just by choosing which one.\n\n226\n00:11:47.272 --> 00:11:49.960\nWell, this was the active one, so\nit's the only one that's gonna show.\n\n227\n00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.951\nBut if I happened to have this in my\nhigh performance, it would show me all\n\n228\n00:11:52.951 --> 00:11:56.350\nthe things that I can really, really\nfine-tune our power settings, all right.\n\n229\n00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:59.168\nAnd you could see this as one of\nthe reasons even though we've talked\n\n230\n00:11:59.168 --> 00:12:01.987\nabout power options in other episodes,\nwe really gotta come back to\n\n231\n00:12:01.987 --> 00:12:05.900\nthat because of the fact that we're\ntalking about mobile configuration here.\n\n232\n00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.740\nNow, the other thing that's\nreally interesting is this,\n\n233\n00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:10.800\nPresentation Settings.\n\n234\n00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.610\nAgain, we've already talked\nabout the Sync Center, and\n\n235\n00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.090\nif I wanted to,\nthis would bring up the Sync Center.\n\n236\n00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:17.730\nAnd this is where we could set\nup our manage our offline files.\n\n237\n00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.918\nIt's really about the only thing\nthat you can do with it today,\n\n238\n00:12:20.918 --> 00:12:24.887\nagain, because they're kind of pushing\nit by the wayside for some of the newer\n\n239\n00:12:24.887 --> 00:12:29.060\napps that they're developing within\nthe WUP, the Universal Windows Platform.\n\n240\n00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:36.180\nWhich utilizes WUA, the Universal Windows\nApplications, if I can get that right.\n\n241\n00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.890\nThose are all the platform\nthat it's doing right now.\n\n242\n00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:39.680\n&gt;&gt; You did well.\n\n243\n00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:40.870\n&gt;&gt; All right, thank you sir,\n\n244\n00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:41.950\nI appreciate it.\n\n245\n00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:46.320\nSo well,\nwe'll just kinda skip over Sync Center.\n\n246\n00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.410\nAgain, check out those episodes where\nZach and I setup offline files and\n\n247\n00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:52.220\nshowing you exactly how when\nyou're connected to the network,\n\n248\n00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:57.220\nyou can synchronize any files that\nyou've setup to an external source.\n\n249\n00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:01.800\nBut the one that we wanna look at is,\nnotice that we're not presenting.\n\n250\n00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:05.510\nWhy might this be important\nin a mobile environment?\n\n251\n00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:07.020\nI wanted you to think about this,\nall right?\n\n252\n00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:10.260\nWe send Zach, Zach's gonna work for, well,\nalready does [LAUGH] work for ITProTV.\n\n253\n00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:11.580\nDid you know?\n\n254\n00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:12.390\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hey.\n\n255\n00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:12.890\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n256\n00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:13.670\n&gt;&gt; I work here.\n\n257\n00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:14.560\n&gt;&gt; You work here,\n\n258\n00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.274\nthat's right.\nBut let's say that you're gonna do some\n\n259\n00:13:17.274 --> 00:13:20.885\nfieldwork for us, maybe you're gonna go\nout, maybe do a couple of interviews with\n\n260\n00:13:20.885 --> 00:13:22.947\nsomebody that we maybe\nwant to partner with, or\n\n261\n00:13:22.947 --> 00:13:26.461\nsomebody that we want to work with.\nOr maybe just come here into the studios,\n\n262\n00:13:26.461 --> 00:13:29.500\nright.\nSo we give Zach his Windows 10 machine and\n\n263\n00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:31.590\nhe's got to kind of present\nmaybe on a screen and\n\n264\n00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:33.700\nkind of walk through what\nwe're gonna be doing.\n\n265\n00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:37.897\nWell, the presentation settings, what they\ndo is they make sure that the little slack\n\n266\n00:13:37.897 --> 00:13:41.590\nmessage doesn't come across in the middle\nof your presentation that says.\n\n267\n00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:44.556\nHey, remember this, so\nthe little notification that says, honey,\n\n268\n00:13:44.556 --> 00:13:47.271\ndon't forget to buy the milk on\nthe way home after you're done,\n\n269\n00:13:47.271 --> 00:13:49.840\nyou don't want that stuff to come out.\n&gt;&gt; And I assume presentations like that.\n\n270\n00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n271\n00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:53.110\n&gt;&gt; Where they didn't turn that off.\n\n272\n00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:54.720\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely and what happens,\n\n273\n00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.441\nit kind of makes the presentation\namateur hour, right.\n\n274\n00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:02.200\nSo presentation settings,\nwe go ahead and click this here.\n\n275\n00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:07.120\nNotice when it says again, and these\nare specific to Mobility Settings, right?\n\n276\n00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.770\nI'm currently giving a presentation,\n\n277\n00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:12.100\nnotice that it says when giving\na presentation, your computer stays awake.\n\n278\n00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.460\nSystem notifications, that's a big one.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n279\n00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.507\n&gt;&gt; System notifications are turned off,\n\n280\n00:14:15.507 --> 00:14:17.810\nnotice it says, turn off the screen saver.\n\n281\n00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:19.820\nIf I'm in the middle of\ngiving a PowerPoint or\n\n282\n00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.960\nsomething like that,\nshowing some executive summary.\n\n283\n00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.370\nI don't want in the middle of sea level\npeople giving this executive summary for\n\n284\n00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:27.588\nmy computer to go to sleep, right.\n\n285\n00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.650\nSet the volume.\n\n286\n00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:31.570\nWhat do I want to set the volume at,\nright?\n\n287\n00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:33.000\nAgain, show this in the background.\n\n288\n00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.050\nMaybe we want and\nyou could see the kind of image here.\n\n289\n00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:40.070\nMaybe I want something like the ITProTV\nlogo to be on my background, and\n\n290\n00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:41.410\npart of the presentation, right?\n\n291\n00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:43.520\nSo I can configure that as well.\n\n292\n00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.360\nAll great little settings to have-\n&gt;&gt; That's fantastic, so.\n\n293\n00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.053\n&gt;&gt; And again,\n\n294\n00:14:46.053 --> 00:14:50.590\nyou can get really granular here with\nsome of the settings that you can do so.\n\n295\n00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:56.710\nI guess, the last one that we'll talk\nabout is a pretty obvious here too,\n\n296\n00:14:56.710 --> 00:15:00.830\nbut if it's not, we can also configure\nthings like our sound, right.\n\n297\n00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:04.774\nAnd from here, it's just a matter of\nconfiguring what device is gonna be\n\n298\n00:15:04.774 --> 00:15:07.944\nthe default device as well as\nselecting the properties and\n\n299\n00:15:07.944 --> 00:15:11.130\ndoing minor configuration that\non your sound as well too.\n\n300\n00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:13.938\nSo all great things to have access to, and\n\n301\n00:15:13.938 --> 00:15:19.410\nquite a short episode compared to some of\nthe other ones that we've done before.\n\n302\n00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:24.050\nBut again, we've tackled all\nthe objectives in this configuring\n\n303\n00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:27.130\nthe Mobility Settings, but we had to come\nback and show you the Mobility Center,\n\n304\n00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:30.510\nbecause if you don't have\na laptop running Windows 10, and\n\n305\n00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:32.460\nyou only have a desktop and\nyou're studying for this.\n\n306\n00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:35.612\nSometimes it's very difficult to see what\nthese settings are and even where they\n\n307\n00:15:35.612 --> 00:15:38.870\nare because they don't include it in the\noperating system if you're on a desktop.\n\n308\n00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:42.320\nSo hopefully, that helps you\nout know all these settings,\n\n309\n00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:46.667\nknow where you would use them, why you\nwould use them and don't hesitate or\n\n310\n00:15:46.667 --> 00:15:51.497\nbe afraid to get into the operating system\nand poke around, so that you can learn and\n\n311\n00:15:51.497 --> 00:15:54.900\nyou can do well on your MTA exam.\n&gt;&gt; Well done, well said,\n\n312\n00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:56.470\nconfiguring mobility settings,\n\n313\n00:15:56.470 --> 00:16:01.000\nanother fantastic episode in\nthe MTA Windows OS Fundamental series.\n\n314\n00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.040\nMake sure you see every episode.\n\n315\n00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:05.169\nIt's gonna help you with that exam and\nhelp you now and in the future, and\n\n316\n00:16:05.169 --> 00:16:07.180\nby the

00:00:08.407\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.407 --> 00:00:11.921\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:13.973\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:13.973 --> 00:00:15.830\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.390\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, for this\nepisode of MTA Windows OS Fundamentals.\n\n8\n00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.140\nThe name of this episode is Identify\nInstallations and Architecture Types.\n\n9\n00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.020\nWhat's that all about?\n\n10\n00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.080\nSo let's ask Wes Bryan,\nbecause he'll know.\n\n11\n00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.750\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nBoy I tell you what,\n\n12\n00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:29.570\nI threw a title at him.\n\n13\n00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.290\n[CROSSTALK] That's definitely a mouthful,\nthat's right.\n\n14\n00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.800\nSo what we're going to be looking at,\nyou know,\n\n15\n00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.200\nwe've been talking a lot about Windows and\n\n16\n00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.210\nsome of the components, utilities and\nstuff that you see inside of Windows.\n\n17\n00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.674\nOne of the things that we also\nneed to talk about is, well,\n\n18\n00:00:42.674 --> 00:00:44.950\nhow do we get Windows on our machines?\n\n19\n00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.216\nAnd for a lot of you, maybe it's already\non your machines when you buy your,\n\n20\n00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:52.414\nlet's say you go to a place like Best Buy,\nOffice Depot,\n\n21\n00:00:52.414 --> 00:00:55.100\nNewegg, TigerDirect, Amazon, if you will.\n\n22\n00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.290\nWherever it is that you\ngo to buy your device,\n\n23\n00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.680\nmaybe you've already\ngot Windows installed.\n\n24\n00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.620\nSo maybe you never had to\nworry about it before.\n\n25\n00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.680\nBut, as part of being an MTA candidate,\n\n26\n00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.170\nyou're gonna be a Microsoft\nTechnology Associate, and hopefully,\n\n27\n00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.290\nwe really do hope, that'll springboard\nyour career into more advanced training.\n\n28\n00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.290\nYou'll go on maybe to an MCSA and\nmany other things, right?\n\n29\n00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.330\nSo, with that, in a Windows environment,\nyou're gonna have to know,\n\n30\n00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.420\nhow do we get the operating\nsystem installed on the hardware?\n\n31\n00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.180\nSo, as Jack, the first part of\nthat title is installation.\n\n32\n00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.660\nWe're gonna look at what it takes to\nget Windows installed on a machine.\n\n33\n00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.830\nThe other thing that we're\ngonna look at is a little bit\n\n34\n00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.320\nabout the architecture, right?\n\n35\n00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.280\nThis isn't just about looking at the car,\nright?\n\n36\n00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.830\nThis is actually about walking over to\nthe hood, and lifting the hood, and\n\n37\n00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.650\nkinda looking at the engine, right?\n\n38\n00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.550\nLooking a little bit more at\nthe DNA that it's hiding.\n\n39\n00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.350\nAnd some of the stuff, thank goodness,\n\n40\n00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.170\nwe really don't have to worry\nabout it too much anymore.\n\n41\n00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.960\nIt's still there.\n\n42\n00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.730\nBut we've got other technology that's\nactually configuring it for us.\n\n43\n00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.500\nSo Zach, what do you say we go ahead and\ndive in?\n\n44\n00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.310\nWe talk about installation first.\n\n45\n00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.110\nNow one of the first\nthings you have to know\n\n46\n00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.440\nwhen it comes to installing\nan operating system.\n\n47\n00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.760\nAnd I don't care what\noperating system this is,\n\n48\n00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.510\nit's not just specific to Microsoft.\n\n49\n00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.837\nIt doesn't matter if you're\ntalking about Linux or Unix.\n\n50\n00:02:10.837 --> 00:02:13.690\nApple, they control their\nown operating system so\n\n51\n00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.380\nyou don't really have many options there.\n\n52\n00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.450\nBut to be able to install\nan operating system, you need to know\n\n53\n00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.410\nwhat are the resources that that operating\nsystem requires to be able to install it.\n\n54\n00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.830\nI need to know,\nwhat hardware do I need to have\n\n55\n00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.470\nin order to get the functionality\nof the operating system.\n\n56\n00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.760\nSo that is a good prerequisite to\nunderstand, the requirements for Windows.\n\n57\n00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.430\nNow, I will tell you that one of the great\nthings is for a very long time, pretty\n\n58\n00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.940\nmuch since Windows 7, the requirements\nreally haven't changed that much, right?\n\n59\n00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.350\nAnd that's a good thing, because any time\nyou're trying to memorize something for\n\n60\n00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.570\nan exam, I've always said that man, if you\ncan remember a set of specifications and\n\n61\n00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.440\nthat applies to three different concepts,\n\n62\n00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.630\nthat's less heavy lifting that we have to\ndo in the memorization department, right?\n\n63\n00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.990\nSo let's go ahead and talk about\nthe Windows 7 requirement, all right?\n\n64\n00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.870\nNow, where would we even find\nthe requirements for Windows?\n\n65\n00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.870\nWell, let's go to the source.\n\n66\n00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.430\nLet's go to Microsoft Support, right?\n\n67\n00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.530\nWindows support here.\n\n68\n00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.610\nI've got what the system\nrequirements are for Windows 7.\n\n69\n00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.430\nNow, if we kinda zoom in to this, you're\ngonna see that the requirements aren't\n\n70\n00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.480\nreally that hefty by today's\ncomputing hardware standards, right?\n\n71\n00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.010\nWe got a 1 gigahertz processor, right?\n\n72\n00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.020\nA lot of our processors\nare well beyond that.\n\n73\n00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.790\nIn fact,\nour mobile devices have processors\n\n74\n00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.700\nthat are above a gigahertz today.\n\n75\n00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.870\nAll right, but keep in mind, you might be\nin a situation where you're supporting\n\n76\n00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.900\nsome hardware that maybe they're trying to\nget all the way to the end of life, right?\n\n77\n00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.150\nWe're gonna get our ROI, right?\n\n78\n00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.650\nOur return on investment.\n\n79\n00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.390\nSo you might be dealing with\nolder hardware, all right?\n\n80\n00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.900\nNow, notice it says or faster for\n32-bit or 64-bit processor.\n\n81\n00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.738\nWhat the heck does that mean?\n\n82\n00:03:55.738 --> 00:03:57.320\n32-bit vs 64-bit.\n\n83\n00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.010\nWell, this is really about,\nwhat this boils down to is how much RAM,\n\n84\n00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.960\nhow much memory can the operating\nsystem see and use?\n\n85\n00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.758\nAlright, now if it's 32-bit operating\nsystem, right, also notice, x86,\n\n86\n00:04:10.758 --> 00:04:11.478\nas you can see.\n\n87\n00:04:11.478 --> 00:04:15.540\nx86 and 32-bit,\nthese are synonymous terms, all right?\n\n88\n00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.441\nIt goes back from the days of\nthe 8086-based processors, right?\n\n89\n00:04:19.441 --> 00:04:25.560\n32-bit processor has a 4-gigabyte\nRAM limitation, all right?\n\n90\n00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.440\nYou can only have 4 gigs, that's all\nthe operating system can see, all right?\n\n91\n00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.648\nIf you're talking about 64 gigabytes,\nor excuse me, I'm sorry, 64-bits.\n\n92\n00:04:35.648 --> 00:04:40.320\nThen, what we're talking about with 64-bit\nprocessors is we typically don't have\n\n93\n00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.490\nthe limitations in RAM.\n\n94\n00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.580\nNow I say that there is a theoretical\nlimit, it's in the exobytes.\n\n95\n00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.460\nIt's insane how much potential\nmemory you could have.\n\n96\n00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.040\nBut the operating systems, typically your\nclient operating systems, will limit,\n\n97\n00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.570\nWindows will limit it to about a 128 gigs,\nwhich is still astronomical, right?\n\n98\n00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:06.210\nI mean even 64 gigs is a lot, but 64-bit\ngets you past that 4 gigabyte limitation.\n\n99\n00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.380\nNow, it's also about how\nthe processor chews up the data.\n\n100\n00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.890\n32 bits at a time,\nquite literally, 32 traces,\n\n101\n00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.040\nelectrical conductors on the motherboard\npiping in 32 bits at a time.\n\n102\n00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.490\nVersus 64 bits being piped in at a time,\nand\n\n103\n00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.770\nthen you talk about multiplying how many\ncores are inside of those processors, and\n\n104\n00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.920\nyou can see 64-bit processing\nreally is the way to go.\n\n105\n00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.820\nBut there are some times where\nyou'll still maybe need to\n\n106\n00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.500\nput 32-bit on older systems.\n\n107\n00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.410\nAll right, so, what do we need for RAM?\n\n108\n00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:42.460\nWell, one gigabyte of RAM for 32 bit,\nor two gigabytes for 64 bit, right?\n\n109\n00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.820\nDo keep that in mind.\n\n110\n00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.370\nNow, what is the available\nhard drive space you need?\n\n111\n00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.022\nWell, this is kind of easy to hit today,\nbut\n\n112\n00:05:49.022 --> 00:05:52.480\nwe even have thumb drives that\nhave more space than this.\n\n113\n00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:59.460\nIn fact, I've got a 16-gig USB thumb drive\nsitting in my desk right now, and a 64 GB.\n\n114\n00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.525\nSo drive capacities are so large today,\n\n115\n00:06:01.525 --> 00:06:04.270\nthat this really should be\nkind of a thing of the past.\n\n116\n00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.970\nBut you do need to be aware of it.\n\n117\n00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.720\nBecause they might put you in\na scenario where they say,\n\n118\n00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.680\nyou have a 1.8 GHz processor,\nyou've got 2 GB of RAM.\n\n119\n00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.730\nAnd you've got 15 GB\navailable hard disk space.\n\n120\n00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.260\nWhat do we need to do to\nget Windows installed?\n\n121\n00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.980\nAnd you'll have to know that\nthe one choice you need to do is\n\n122\n00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.110\nupgrade the hard drive, right?\n\n123\n00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.260\nSo that's important,\nthat could be a deal breaker.\n\n124\n00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.640\nYou don't have these requirements,\nthen you don't get to install Windows.\n\n125\n00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.320\nDirectX graphics, all right,\n\n126\n00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.240\nwhen we talk about DirectX graphics,\nthe DirectX team is responsible for Xbox.\n\n127\n00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.780\nIt's the graphics subsystem\nthat's built into Windows, right?\n\n128\n00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:46.470\nThe Windows graphics team and\ntheir gaming team kinda got together.\n\n129\n00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.700\nAnd they came up with what could've\nbeen called the direct XBox.\n\n130\n00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.660\nThey just took direct out of it and\ncalled it XBox.\n\n131\n00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.480\nThat's the Graphics Suite, all right?\n\n132\n00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.870\nYou need DirectX 9 or higher if you will.\n\n133\n00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.060\nWDDM, what is this?\n\n134\n00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:06.710\nWell, this is actually what is known\nas the Windows Display Driver Model,\n\n135\n00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.110\nall right?\n\n136\n00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:13.830\nWhat we say about display driver model\nis WDDM, it basically kept your drivers,\n\n137\n00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:18.870\nyour display drivers out of\nthe kernel mode and into user mode.\n\n138\n00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.400\nAll right, and\nwhy is that important, right?\n\n139\n00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.710\nWell, we have two modes of\noperation within a computer.\n\n140\n00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.392\nWe have a Kernel Mode Operation and\n\n141\n00:07:26.392 --> 00:07:29.630\nwe have what's known as\na User Mode Operation, all right.\n\n142\n00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.740\nLet's start with the lowest or\n\n143\n00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.909\nthe highest privilege mode there is,\nthat's Kernel Mode.\n\n144\n00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:41.629\nWhen we talk about the kernel mode,\nkernel mode is where all of your\n\n145\n00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:46.230\nsystem drivers are loaded into,\nwhere your file system is loaded into.\n\n146\n00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.454\nAnd they all share the same memory space.\n\n147\n00:07:48.454 --> 00:07:53.574\nWhich means that if a driver that is\noperating in kernel mode corrupts data, or\n\n148\n00:07:53.574 --> 00:07:58.931\nis corrupted, then it can potentially\ncorrupt every other system driver that's\n\n149\n00:07:58.931 --> 00:08:03.920\nsharing that same virtualized memory\nspace, crashing the entire system.\n\n150\n00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.830\nNow, in the days of XP, Well,\n\n151\n00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:10.753\nthey notice that a lot of the drivers that\nwere crashing the operating system and\n\n152\n00:08:10.753 --> 00:08:15.178\ncausing blue screens were those\nkernel mode display drivers, right?\n\n153\n00:08:15.178 --> 00:08:16.392\nThat was the XPDM they called it.\n\n154\n00:08:16.392 --> 00:08:20.514\nThe XP Driver mode, if you will.\n\n155\n00:08:20.514 --> 00:08:21.200\n&gt;&gt; I had XP.\n\n156\n00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:21.955\nI remember those days.\n\n157\n00:08:21.955 --> 00:08:23.305\n&gt;&gt; XP was a great operating system.\n\n158\n00:08:23.305 --> 00:08:27.967\nIt stayed around as the longest running\nflagship Windows Operating System\n\n159\n00:08:27.967 --> 00:08:28.790\nthere was.\n\n160\n00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:31.176\nI think it was 20 years it was or\nsomething around there.\n\n161\n00:08:31.176 --> 00:08:34.089\nYeah because it came out in 2001 and\n\n162\n00:08:34.089 --> 00:08:40.280\nit didn't go end of life cycle til 2014,\nso we're talking 13 years.\n\n163\n00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.430\nBut it had issues, right?\n\n164\n00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:44.550\nSo when Vista came out and\nI know we're not worried about Vista, but\n\n165\n00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:49.320\nthis continued on and even today, up until\nWindows 10, they said, you know what?\n\n166\n00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.172\nSince those pesky display drivers,\nthey're causing so much problem.\n\n167\n00:08:53.172 --> 00:08:56.500\nThat's right,\nthey're crashing our operating system.\n\n168\n00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.198\nWe're gonna put them in user mode.\n\n169\n00:08:57.198 --> 00:09:02.220\nNow why would that be beneficial,\nall right?\n\n170\n00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:06.727\nBecause Windows supports\nwhat's known as the UMDF,\n\n171\n00:09:06.727 --> 00:09:10.240\nuser mode driver framework, all right?\n\n172\n00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.303\nAnd when you have user mode,\nwhen you're in user mode,\n\n173\n00:09:13.303 --> 00:09:16.810\nyou don't have the privileges\nthat you have in the kernel.\n\n174\n00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:20.114\nSee, the kernel mode,\neverything that runs and\n\n175\n00:09:20.114 --> 00:09:25.928\noperates at kernel mode has direct access\nto the hardware and the memory, all right?\n\n176\n00:09:25.928 --> 00:09:28.764\nWhich means, again, like I said,\nthat memory stays, gets corrupted,\n\n177\n00:09:28.764 --> 00:09:32.100\ncrashes the whole operating system and\nit becomes unstable.\n\n178\n00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.321\nAnd to increase the stability,\nthey said, you know what?\n\n179\n00:09:35.321 --> 00:09:41.240\nMost functionality that a user needs\nonly needs to run in user mode.\n\n180\n00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.024\nBecause user mode isn't\nprivileged like that.\n\n181\n00:09:43.024 --> 00:09:46.809\nWe gotta go through a middle\nman if you will, a negotiator,\n\n182\n00:09:46.809 --> 00:09:49.700\nto even be able to put\ninformation in memory.\n\n183\n00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.355\nAnd usually it's that virtual directory\nspace that doesn't have access\n\n184\n00:09:52.355 --> 00:09:52.921\nto the memory.\n\n185\n00:09:52.921 --> 00:09:57.861\nSo if something corrupts in user mode,\nwell it might shut your desktop off and\n\n186\n00:09:57.861 --> 00:09:59.770\nthen the desktop comes back.\n\n187\n00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:04.643\nBut you don't get the outright kernel\npanic, as they call a blue screen,\n\n188\n00:10:04.643 --> 00:10:05.434\nall right?\n\n189\n00:10:05.434 --> 00:10:09.480\nSo, remember, user mode doesn't run\nwith the lowest privileges, right?\n\n190\n00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.823\nWell, lowest privileges in the context\nof least privileges is probably a better\n\n191\n00:10:12.823 --> 00:10:13.421\nway to say it.\n\n192\n00:10:13.421 --> 00:10:16.754\nAll right, kernel mode, things that\nare running in kernel mode have privileged\n\n193\n00:10:16.754 --> 00:10:19.860\naccess, typically direct access,\nto things like memory, right?\n\n194\n00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.427\nSo those are the two different.\n\n195\n00:10:21.427 --> 00:10:24.009\nSo if we go back to our\nspecifications here, WDDM,\n\n196\n00:10:24.009 --> 00:10:25.878\nthat windows display driver model.\n\n197\n00:10:25.878 --> 00:10:29.885\nAll that is is fancy term for saying, hey,\ntake those display models, get them outta\n\n198\n00:10:29.885 --> 00:10:33.614\nkernel mode, so they don't cause\ninstabilities in the operating system, and\n\n199\n00:10:33.614 --> 00:10:34.687\nput them in user mode.\n\n200\n00:10:34.687 --> 00:10:36.383\nSo that if they do cause problems,\n\n201\n00:10:36.383 --> 00:10:39.070\nit doesn't corrupt\nthe entirely operating system.\n\n202\n00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:42.782\nSo, nice thing to have and\nyou need 1.0 or higher.\n\n203\n00:10:42.782 --> 00:10:46.874\nNow there are some additional requirements\nto things like internet access and\n\n204\n00:10:46.874 --> 00:10:50.799\nresolution and we're not worried about\nall of these extra requirements.\n\n205\n00:10:50.799 --> 00:10:53.944\nCuz these are the basic requirements,\nright?\n\n206\n00:10:53.944 --> 00:10:58.747\nThese are the ones aren't deal breakers,\nthese are just for\n\n207\n00:10:58.747 --> 00:11:01.403\nfeature centric requirements.\n\n208\n00:11:01.403 --> 00:11:05.070\nAll right, so, what do we need for\nWindows 8 and 8.1.\n\n209\n00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:09.100\nWell, what we need is\npretty much the same thing.\n\n210\n00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.238\nAnd this is what I kind of like,\nall right?\n\n211\n00:11:12.238 --> 00:11:18.390\nWindows 8.1, right we need a 1 gigahertz\nprocessor or faster with PAE NX and SSE.\n\n212\n00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:21.482\nThese are just some additional\narchitectures that are built into the CPU.\n\n213\n00:11:21.482 --> 00:11:25.170\nPhysical address, extensions,\nas well as no execute byte.\n\n214\n00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:28.609\nAnd off the top of my head,\nI can't remember what SSE stands for.\n\n215\n00:11:28.609 --> 00:11:30.780\nIt's again, added to the instruction set.\n\n216\n00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.510\nNo execute byte if you will.\n\n217\n00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:35.570\nThat's where we get things like\ndata execution protection.\n\n218\n00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.837\nIt quarantines off a portion of memory and\nsays,\n\n219\n00:11:37.837 --> 00:11:41.280\nthat if an application puts its data here,\nit can't execute code there.\n\n220\n00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.186\nIt's a security thing.\n\n221\n00:11:42.186 --> 00:11:47.700\nBut you definitely have to know\none gigahertz processor or higher.\n\n222\n00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:51.627\nAlso, keep in mind that it\ncould be 32-bit or 64-bit,\n\n223\n00:11:51.627 --> 00:11:54.022\neven though they don't say it here.\n\n224\n00:11:54.022 --> 00:11:57.440\nRAM, one gigabyte or two gigabytes.\n\n225\n00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.628\nNotice the similarities here?\n\n226\n00:11:58.628 --> 00:12:00.600\nIt's the same thing as Windows 7, right?\n\n227\n00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:05.017\nSo that's important and\nit'll make it a little bit easier for you.\n\n228\n00:12:05.017 --> 00:12:09.722\nDrive space, 32-bit, 16 gigabits or\nif it's 64-bit, 20 gigabits,\n\n229\n00:12:09.722 --> 00:12:14.290\ngigabytes, excuse me, I don't know\nwhy I'm saying bits, gigabytes.\n\n230\n00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:16.271\nNow, why is it that it requires more for\n64-bit?\n\n231\n00:12:16.271 --> 00:12:20.090\nWell, you have what's known as a WoW64.\n\n232\n00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:21.253\nIt's called WoW64, right?\n\n233\n00:12:21.253 --> 00:12:26.031\nIt's an emulator that allows you\nto run 32-bit operating systems on\n\n234\n00:12:26.031 --> 00:12:28.030\na 64 bit platform, right?\n\n235\n00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:30.268\nSo we can run 64 bit and 32 bit.\n\n236\n00:12:30.268 --> 00:12:33.570\nThat's why we've talked about\nit in other episodes there Zach,\n\n237\n00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:36.513\nwhile we see a program files,\nprogram files directory and\n\n238\n00:12:36.513 --> 00:12:39.660\nthen we see a program files x86 directory.\n\n239\n00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:42.506\nThose are where your 32\nbit applications run and\n\n240\n00:12:42.506 --> 00:12:47.451\nthat wow 64 bit sub system is what allows\nthose 32 bit applications to be emulated,\n\n241\n00:12:47.451 --> 00:12:50.108\nif you will,\non top of 64 bit architecture.\n\n242\n00:12:50.108 --> 00:12:55.050\nSo, a little bit more data if you will\nin the installation process of a 64\n\n243\n00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:57.260\nbit operating system.\n\n244\n00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:57.856\nNotice the graphics card.\n\n245\n00:12:57.856 --> 00:13:01.190\nIt says the same thing,\ndirect X9 WDDM driver.\n\n246\n00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:04.577\nSo a lot of these features stay\nthe same and I'm not worried about or\n\n247\n00:13:04.577 --> 00:13:06.331\nthe requirements stay the same and\n\n248\n00:13:06.331 --> 00:13:10.162\nI'm not worried about more\nfeature-centric requirements, all right?\n\n249\n00:13:10.162 --> 00:13:12.260\nJust know what the basics are.\n\n250\n00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:13.369\nHow about Windows 10?\n\n251\n00:13:13.369 --> 00:13:18.819\nAll right, well, when we look at Windows\n10, let's go ahead and look at Windows 10.\n\n252\n00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:22.314\nWell, they seem to be the same,\nall the way across.\n\n253\n00:13:22.314 --> 00:13:25.476\nAnd I take the time to show you this,\nladies and gentlemen, just so\n\n254\n00:13:25.476 --> 00:13:26.620\nit'll make it easier.\n\n255\n00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:27.976\nRemember one set of specifications.\n\n256\n00:13:27.976 --> 00:13:30.842\nAnd if you can remember\none set of specifications,\n\n257\n00:13:30.842 --> 00:13:34.172\nknow that it applies to Windows 7,\n8, 8.1, [LAUGH] and\n\n258\n00:13:34.172 --> 00:13:38.300\nWindows 10 makes it a lot easier for\nthe memorization, right?\n\n259\n00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:43.276\nAnd, again, you can see gigabytes\nof RAM from 32-bit, 2 gigabytes for\n\n260\n00:13:43.276 --> 00:13:47.011\n64-bit, 16 gigs for\n32-bit operating system,\n\n261\n00:13:47.011 --> 00:13:51.386\nas far as your hard drive is considered or\n20 gigs for 64-bit.\n\n262\n00:13:51.386 --> 00:13:54.030\nGraphics card again, DirectX 9 or later.\n\n263\n00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:57.402\nKeep in mind, I believe we are up to\nDirectX 12 at the time of this recording.\n\n264\n00:13:57.402 --> 00:14:00.810\nIt might still be 11 but\nwe're well beyond that.\n\n265\n00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:01.496\nBut that's the basics.\n\n266\n00:14:01.496 --> 00:14:03.030\nAgain, those are called the jail breakers.\n\n267\n00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.824\nIf you don't have these,\nyou don't install the operating system.\n\n268\n00:14:05.824 --> 00:14:09.082\nThe other thing that I'll tell you\nabout these requirements, too,\n\n269\n00:14:09.082 --> 00:14:12.396\nis that these are the requirements\nto install the operating system and\n\n270\n00:14:12.396 --> 00:14:16.162\nit doesn't necessarily mean that you're\ngonna get the best performance out of\n\n271\n00:14:16.162 --> 00:14:18.030\nthe operating system.\n\n272\n00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:22.492\nYou could still see that it runs painfully\nslow, all though I will tell you,\n\n273\n00:14:22.492 --> 00:14:27.374\nWindows 10, the way it utilizes resources\nis, they definitely made some very,\n\n274\n00:14:27.374 --> 00:14:29.980\nvery good advancements in the technology.\n\n275\n00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:36.700\nBut there is, again, your requirements for\nyour Windows installations.\n\n276\n00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.879\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n&gt;&gt; Now, the next thing that we need to\n\n277\n00:14:38.879 --> 00:14:43.180\ntalk about is, well, why don't we\ngo ahead and do an installation.\n\n278\n00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:46.985\nIn fact I've got a Windows machine and\nwe'll go ahead and like I said,\n\n279\n00:14:46.985 --> 00:14:50.855\nwe'll push power on this machine and\nwe will get it started it up here and\n\n280\n00:14:50.855 --> 00:14:54.618\nhopefully once this starts up,\nZach can tell me where the any key is.\n\n281\n00:14:54.618 --> 00:14:57.973\nSo we're gonna boot to the media.\n\n282\n00:14:57.973 --> 00:15:00.927\nHopefully I found the any key here.\n\n283\n00:15:00.927 --> 00:15:02.860\nIt looks like I seem to miss it.\n\n284\n00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:06.186\nMaybe I didn't hit it\nquite like I needed to.\n\n285\n00:15:06.186 --> 00:15:08.340\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe'll reboot it.\n\n286\n00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.570\nAnd hopefully, there we go.\n\n287\n00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:12.545\nI didn't find the any key\nthe first time there.\n\n288\n00:15:12.545 --> 00:15:17.397\nAnd what we're doing, is we're booting\ndirectly to the optical disc here.\n\n289\n00:15:17.397 --> 00:15:19.970\nAll right, now, again,\na clean installation.\n\n290\n00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:23.516\nThey call it a clean installation\ncuz you don't have an operating\n\n291\n00:15:23.516 --> 00:15:27.653\nsystem on the device or the hardware\nthat you're going to install Windows.\n\n292\n00:15:27.653 --> 00:15:30.310\nHence the term clean installation.\n\n293\n00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:31.646\nNow, I apologize ahead of time.\n\n294\n00:15:31.646 --> 00:15:33.640\nWe've got kind of these matted bars.\n\n295\n00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.699\nBut one of the things that we need\nto understand is I got a hard drive.\n\n296\n00:15:36.699 --> 00:15:41.390\nI've got a video adapter, but\nI've got no driver for that video adapter.\n\n297\n00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:45.503\nSo what this is doing is loading\na very generic VGA driver just to get\n\n298\n00:15:45.503 --> 00:15:47.935\nme working with the operating system.\n\n299\n00:15:47.935 --> 00:15:52.689\nSo I apologize here for\nthe low resolution that we see.\n\n300\n00:15:52.689 --> 00:15:54.866\nBut if we go ahead and zoom in,\n\n301\n00:15:54.866 --> 00:16:00.807\nyou'll see that it tells me the language\nto install, time and currency format.\n\n302\n00:16:00.807 --> 00:16:04.453\nI'm gonna leave these all the defaults and\nkeyboard or input method.\n\n303\n00:16:04.453 --> 00:16:08.756\nNow, The language that you\nhave is really based on\n\n304\n00:16:08.756 --> 00:16:13.268\nthe installation media that you purchased,\nokay?\n\n305\n00:16:13.268 --> 00:16:18.327\nYou'll see that, for instance this\none says EN_ in the DVD's name,\n\n306\n00:16:18.327 --> 00:16:21.600\nand that's because it's English, right?\n\n307\n00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.380\nIf it said JN, it would be Japan, right?\n\n308\n00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:28.730\nSo it's really contingent on\nthe language of the installation media.\n\n309\n00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:30.120\nYou can always later, if you need to,\n\n310\n00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:34.940\ninstall what are known as language packs,\nbut this is the English version.\n\n311\n00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:39.280\nIf you needed to launch into\nthe recovery environment,\n\n312\n00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.930\nyou can repair your computer\nfrom an installation, too.\n\n313\n00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:45.130\nWe'll go into recovery in another episode,\nbut we'll just mention it here because\n\n314\n00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:48.510\nit's part of the installation process,\nand that's where you would launch it up.\n\n315\n00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:51.890\nAnd we're gonna go ahead, and\nwe're gonna choose Install Now, all right?\n\n316\n00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:55.173\nAnd now what the setup is doing\nis it's going to take some of\n\n317\n00:16:55.173 --> 00:16:59.141\nthe installation files and\nit's gonna put them into RAM, all right?\n\n318\n00:16:59.141 --> 00:17:02.507\nAnd it puts it into memory so\nthat it can start unpacking it and\n\n319\n00:17:02.507 --> 00:17:04.949\nsome of the basic level\ndrivers that plug and\n\n320\n00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:09.075\nplay uses to kinda identify the hardware\nand start this machine, right?\n\n321\n00:17:09.075 --> 00:17:11.090\nCuz remember what\nan Operating System does,\n\n322\n00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:13.770\nan Operating System allows\nus to control our hardware.\n\n323\n00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:17.040\nIf we don't have an Operating System,\nhow do we control the hardware?\n\n324\n00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:21.559\nWell, as part of the installation,\nyou have a small footprint,\n\n325\n00:17:21.559 --> 00:17:24.200\nslimline Windows called Windows PE.\n\n326\n00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.803\nThat's the preinstallation environment,\nand\n\n327\n00:17:25.803 --> 00:17:28.420\nthat's the Operating System that\nyou see that's running here.\n\n328\n00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:32.310\nNow we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna accept the ELA, and\n\n329\n00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:34.820\nI promise I have read\nthis whole entire thing.\n\n330\n00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.500\nAnd at the end of this\nepisode we will give\n\n331\n00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:41.400\nZach a little test if he knows\nwhat the European Union is.\n\n332\n00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.750\nAnd what the warranty\nis in that disclaimer.\n\n333\n00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:44.970\n&gt;&gt; The answer is 42.\n\n334\n00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:46.650\n&gt;&gt; 42, that's right, very good, Zach.\n\n335\n00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:47.500\nYou were paying attention.\n\n336\n00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.100\nSo, now be careful with the next screen.\n\n337\n00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.950\nThe next screen,\nwe talked about clean installations, Zach,\n\n338\n00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:56.220\ndo you see here, Upgrade versus Custom.\n\n339\n00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.970\nDo you see clean installation at all?\n\n340\n00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:00.420\n&gt;&gt; Not necessarily.\n\n341\n00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.340\n&gt;&gt; You do not, right?\n\n342\n00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:05.740\nAnd I always bring this up because if\nthis is the first time you've seen it,\n\n343\n00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:07.660\nwe're talking about clean installation.\n\n344\n00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:10.725\nWhat the heck,\nI don't see clean installation.\n\n345\n00:18:10.725 --> 00:18:14.500\nThat actually a custom installation and\nI don't know why they call it custom.\n\n346\n00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:18.742\nBut it says, the file settings and\napplications aren't moved to Windows.\n\n347\n00:18:18.742 --> 00:18:20.280\nYou wanna make changes to partitions and\n\n348\n00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.470\ndrives start your computer using\nthis installation, all right?\n\n349\n00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:26.850\nThis is essentially what's\ngonna be a clean installation.\n\n350\n00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:30.770\nAnd one of the reasons they do\ncall it a custom installation just\n\n351\n00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:31.840\nkind of picking on it.\n\n352\n00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.870\nIs the fact that you\nare gonna customize or\n\n353\n00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:37.010\nyou have the ability to customize your\nhard drive before you install it.\n\n354\n00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:38.549\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n&gt;&gt; Now at this point,\n\n355\n00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:41.578\nwe could load additional\ndrivers if we need to.\n\n356\n00:18:41.578 --> 00:18:44.249\nI'll tell you,\nif you end up having RAID arrays,\n\n357\n00:18:44.249 --> 00:18:48.080\nlike your hardware level RAID devices and\nyou don't see your storage.\n\n358\n00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.900\nYou know you've configured the RAID array,\nyou know it's online and\n\n359\n00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:54.430\nyou don't see it in this location.\n\n360\n00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:59.450\nI would almost be willing to bet that what\nWindows doesn't have stored in Win PE,\n\n361\n00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:05.200\nin its driver bundle or driver suite,\nis a driver for that RAID controller.\n\n362\n00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.880\nSo it doesn't even recognize it here.\n\n363\n00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.910\nSo couple of things that could happen.\n\n364\n00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:11.700\nIf you have a dedicated\nRAID controller card,\n\n365\n00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:15.450\ngo to the manufacturer download\nthe driver to a USB device.\n\n366\n00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:18.940\nAnd then you come back and\nload the driver, browse to it, and\n\n367\n00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.340\nfind it in this location.\n\n368\n00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:27.870\nAnd load the driver up and restart that\ninstallation, and do a rescan, all right?\n\n369\n00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:30.550\nAnd when you do a rescan,\nit should find the appropriate driver.\n\n370\n00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:34.460\nIf it is not a dedicated\nRAID controller card, but\n\n371\n00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:37.610\nit's built in, integrated into\nthe functionality of the motherboard.\n\n372\n00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:40.230\nGet your chipset driver,\nall right, and do the same thing.\n\n373\n00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:43.990\nGo to manufacturer's website,\ndownload the chipset driver,\n\n374\n00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:46.340\nplug it into the machine and\nbrowse for it.\n\n375\n00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:50.480\nWe're gonna go ahead and back up,\nbecause we do have our space, and\n\n376\n00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.490\nwe could format this if we wanted.\n\n377\n00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:55.000\nWe could do new here and\n\n378\n00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.400\nit would run almost like a very very\nslimline disk management if you will.\n\n379\n00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.960\nYou won't see the disk management\ninterface, but it will go ahead and\n\n380\n00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.370\nformat that partition for you.\n\n381\n00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:07.220\nI'm gonna go ahead and cancel this and\nI'm gonna use the whole entire drive and\n\n382\n00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:08.000\nchoose next.\n\n383\n00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.340\nAll right, and that is really it.\n\n384\n00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:16.310\nWhen it comes down to it, that is\nhow you do your clean installation.\n\n385\n00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.630\nNow, there's another type of installation.\n\n386\n00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:21.420\nActually, there's a couple\ntypes of installations.\n\n387\n00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.670\nThere's what's known as\na network installation.\n\n388\n00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:25.460\nWhat's a network installation?\n\n389\n00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:28.160\nWell, that's where you can use\nthings like your network adapters.\n\n390\n00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.990\nThey have firmware in them that\nsupports something known as a PXE boot,\n\n391\n00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:33.890\nthe pre-execution environment.\n\n392\n00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:37.650\nThat means that I don't have\nan Operating System on my machine.\n\n393\n00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:42.420\nSo my network adapter sends a little BOOTP\nmessage out to the network and says,\n\n394\n00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.220\nhey, is there any server out there,\n\n395\n00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.690\nis there any device out there\nthat's got an Operating System?\n\n396\n00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:48.180\nI could really use one.\n\n397\n00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:51.990\nAll right, and in a Windows environment,\na lot of times what we do is we use\n\n398\n00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:55.130\na technology called WDS,\nWindows Deployment Services, and\n\n399\n00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.910\nwe have an Operating System\nstored up on that server.\n\n400\n00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:01.070\nAnd when my local computer calls\nout to the network and says, hey,\n\n401\n00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:02.640\nwho's got an Operating System?\n\n402\n00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.030\nThat's server,\nremember client server architecture.\n\n403\n00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:07.380\nThe servers listen out and says yeah,\nI got an Operating System.\n\n404\n00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:10.520\nYou can come talk to me, and I'll let\nyou install it over the network and\n\n405\n00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.060\napply it to the local hard drive and\n\n406\n00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:16.040\nthen once I'm done you'll have\nan Operating System ready to go.\n\n407\n00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:19.810\nThat is a common method of\nwhat they call deployment,\n\n408\n00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:22.210\ninstalling your Operating System\nin an enterprise environment,\n\n409\n00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:25.110\nespecially when you have to do\nthis hundreds of times, right?\n\n410\n00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:28.310\nAnd then you can further\nautomate the process by\n\n411\n00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:31.120\nadding what's known as a unattended\nfile to it, that it'll\n\n412\n00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.570\nanswer some of these post-installation\nconfigurations that you're gonna see.\n\n413\n00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:37.400\nAnd even some of the pre-installation\nthings like the language type,\n\n414\n00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.790\nthe keyboard type that we were doing,\nthat we were seeing here.\n\n415\n00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:43.390\nBut there's also what's known\nas an upgrade installation, and\n\n416\n00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:46.780\nan upgrade installation you also\nneed to be aware of, all right?\n\n417\n00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:48.530\nAnd what's an upgrade installation?\n\n418\n00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:52.540\nWell, an upgrade installation is where\nyou already have an Operating System.\n\n419\n00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:55.790\nAnd you wanna upgrade to the next\nlatest and greatest version of Windows.\n\n420\n00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:56.606\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n421\n00:21:56.606 --> 00:21:59.240\nI've got a Windows 8.1 machine\nthat we've been using here.\n\n422\n00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.440\nThis is the one that we've been using\nthroughout this series, all right?\n\n423\n00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.240\nAnd you can see I still got some\nadministrative tools left open from\n\n424\n00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.310\nanother episode that we were filming,\nright?\n\n425\n00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:11.020\nSo I have my Windows 8 machine here and\nI wanna upgrade it.\n\n426\n00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:12.650\nWell, how do I upgrade it?\n\n427\n00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:14.400\nWell upgrades are a little bit different.\n\n428\n00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.950\nLet me just double check make sure.\n\n429\n00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:21.520\nLet's go ahead and\nlet's choose our installation media and\n\n430\n00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:26.120\nI want you to be careful with this one,\nbecause an upgrade installation\n\n431\n00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:30.770\nrequires it to happen when\nthe Operating System is on.\n\n432\n00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:33.850\nInside of the Operating System, right?\n\n433\n00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:37.826\nSo what I've done, is essentially is like\nput the optical disk in the optical tray,\n\n434\n00:22:37.826 --> 00:22:39.682\nwhile the Operating System is online.\n\n435\n00:22:39.682 --> 00:22:42.740\nAnd then what we do is we\nopen our file explorer.\n\n436\n00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:48.200\nAnd then from file explorer, we can go to\nthis PC, and we find our optical disk.\n\n437\n00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.910\nIn this case, the DVD is right here,\nand we double click it and\n\n438\n00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:57.943\nwhat we should get here in a second,\nhopefully, it'll either open, [LAUGH].\n\n439\n00:22:57.943 --> 00:23:02.950\nIt does one of two things, sometimes\nit'll let the setup.exe will fire off,\n\n440\n00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:05.500\nother times, and it did that time.\n\n441\n00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.640\nHere's another thing, let me show you,\none time I've also seen this happen.\n\n442\n00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.380\nLet me just close this\ndown here real quick.\n\n443\n00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:15.950\nBecause I've also seen\nwhere when you click that,\n\n444\n00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:17.910\nit actually goes to this\nscreen right here, right?\n\n445\n00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:20.724\nThis is what's the contents of the DVD,\nand\n\n446\n00:23:20.724 --> 00:23:23.697\nI want you to be aware\nof this setup.exe file.\n\n447\n00:23:23.697 --> 00:23:25.690\nYou would have to double-click that.\n\n448\n00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:28.870\nI didn't have to because the moment\nI clicked it, it went ahead and\n\n449\n00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:31.370\nit launched this little\nwizard in the background.\n\n450\n00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:34.170\nAll right, now, it's asking me,\ndo I wanna get important updates?\n\n451\n00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:37.000\nI'm gonna say, don't download and\ninstall the updates.\n\n452\n00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.510\nAgain, that isn't recommended to do that.\n\n453\n00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:43.140\nBut because of time constraints here,\nyou can always update your drivers later.\n\n454\n00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:48.300\nSo let's go ahead and say, not right now,\nand then we'll choose, Next.\n\n455\n00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:49.810\nAnd it's gonna check our PC,\n\n456\n00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:54.130\nand it's gonna look,\ndo you have what you need, all right?\n\n457\n00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:55.860\nIs this platform compatible?\n\n458\n00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:59.980\nIf this platform is compatible, do you\nhave enough space on your hard drive?\n\n459\n00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:03.189\nHere's your end user license agreement,\ndo you want to accept it?\n\n460\n00:24:03.189 --> 00:24:05.017\nAll right?\nNow we get to figure out,\n\n461\n00:24:05.017 --> 00:24:06.692\nwhat is it that we wanna keep?\n\n462\n00:24:06.692 --> 00:24:07.438\nAll right?\n\n463\n00:24:07.438 --> 00:24:11.641\nNotice it says, keep personal files and\napplications, keep personal files only or\n\n464\n00:24:11.641 --> 00:24:12.780\nnothing.\n\n465\n00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.089\nZach you notice how those are grayed out?\n\n466\n00:24:14.089 --> 00:24:15.040\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n467\n00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:18.580\n&gt;&gt; These are different\nadditions of Windows, right?\n\n468\n00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:22.540\nAnd one of the things you have to keep\nin mind is that you can't go from one\n\n469\n00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:26.046\nedition to another type of edition and\nkeep anything, right?\n\n470\n00:24:26.046 --> 00:24:29.280\nI can't go from a Pro version to\nan Enterprise version and keep anything.\n\n471\n00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.430\nIf I'm going Pro to Pro, I'm fine.\n\n472\n00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:33.873\nIf I'm going enterprise to enterprise,\nI'm fine,\n\n473\n00:24:33.873 --> 00:24:36.712\nI could keep some of these\npersonal files behind, all right?\n\n474\n00:24:36.712 --> 00:24:38.810\nThat's what's known as a migration.\n\n475\n00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:42.540\nYou're migrating the data from\nthe old machine to the new machine.\n\n476\n00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:45.464\nNow, if it's two separate machines, right?\n\n477\n00:24:45.464 --> 00:24:48.248\nIf I have an old machine that I\nneed to take my data off it and\n\n478\n00:24:48.248 --> 00:24:51.728\nI put it on a completely different\nmachine that's still a migration but\n\n479\n00:24:51.728 --> 00:24:53.880\nit's called a side-by-side migration.\n\n480\n00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.973\nAnd that's because they're two\ndifferent computers, all right?\n\n481\n00:24:56.973 --> 00:25:01.157\nIf we do this, where we're migrating\nover the top of a single machine,\n\n482\n00:25:01.157 --> 00:25:04.312\nthat's called an in-place migration,\nall right?\n\n483\n00:25:04.312 --> 00:25:09.410\nOr more correctly,\nwhat's known as a wipe and load, why?\n\n484\n00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:12.788\nIt's kind of a reverse, because you\nactually back up that important\n\n485\n00:25:12.788 --> 00:25:15.829\ninformation, you wipe the operating\nsystem that was there.\n\n486\n00:25:15.829 --> 00:25:17.872\nAnd you load the new\noperating system on and\n\n487\n00:25:17.872 --> 00:25:20.670\nthen you load back down your\nsettings on the same machine.\n\n488\n00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:24.380\nSo a side-by-side migration\nversus a wipe-and-load migration.\n\n489\n00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.610\nIt just still means that\nI've got user data,\n\n490\n00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:31.980\nI've got application settings that I want\nto carry over to the new operating system.\n\n491\n00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:36.070\nIn this case, we're just gonna say,\nno I'm not gonna keep anything.\n\n492\n00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:38.370\nAnd it's gonna ask me,\nare you sure you wanna do this?\n\n493\n00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:41.300\nBecause when you do this,\nyou are going to format the hard drive.\n\n494\n00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:42.550\nThat old data's gonna be gone.\n\n495\n00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:44.260\nSo we'll go ahead and say, Yes.\n\n496\n00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:47.159\nAnd it's gonna say, hey, we're gonna make\nsure that everything's ready to install.\n\n497\n00:25:47.159 --> 00:25:50.174\nAnd, like I said, it should at some point\nhere show you that it's gonna look and\n\n498\n00:25:50.174 --> 00:25:51.350\nsay, we'll, wait a second.\n\n499\n00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:52.825\nDo you have a enough hard drive space?\n\n500\n00:25:52.825 --> 00:25:56.520\nSo we need a certain amount of hard drive\nspace to be able to install the operating\n\n501\n00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.810\nsystem because what it does is it\ntakes your old operating system and\n\n502\n00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:03.150\ncompresses it into a windows.old file.\n\n503\n00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:07.133\nAfter the installation is done, one of\nthe things that you wanna do as part of\n\n504\n00:26:07.133 --> 00:26:09.748\nthe cleanup process of\nan upgrade installation,\n\n505\n00:26:09.748 --> 00:26:12.313\nis you wanna use your disk cleanup,\nthere we go.\n\n506\n00:26:12.313 --> 00:26:16.200\nMaking sure your PC has enough space,\nI knew it would fire off here in a second.\n\n507\n00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:19.900\nIs you want to use your\ndisk cleanup to go back and\n\n508\n00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:23.730\nremove that old Windows installation.\n\n509\n00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:25.610\nIf you try to do it from File Explorer,\n\n510\n00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:30.230\nyou're gonna get several dozen if\nnot hundreds of access denied.\n\n511\n00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:35.790\nThe way you basically eliminate the old\ninstallation is through disk cleanup.\n\n512\n00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:40.200\nNow, it's giving you the chance\nto change what to keep.\n\n513\n00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:43.058\nI can't change anything, though,\nthey were grayed out, all right?\n\n514\n00:26:43.058 --> 00:26:44.920\nAnd I'm gonna choose install.\n\n515\n00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:49.430\nNow, it's actually gonna shut down my\nmachine, it's gonna take it off line for\n\n516\n00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:50.020\na second and\n\n517\n00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:53.870\nwhat it's gonna do is it's gonna go\nthrough the process of upgrading this.\n\n518\n00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:54.370\nLet's go ahead, and\n\n519\n00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:59.250\nswitch back to our Windows 10 machine and\nthe install is complete.\n\n520\n00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:00.170\nSo what we'll do here, and\n\n521\n00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:03.540\nI know Zach we're running\na little bit short on time here.\n\n522\n00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:07.920\nBut let's go ahead, and\nlet's let this machine finish.\n\n523\n00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.840\nWe're gonna let our other machine finish.\n\n524\n00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:14.300\nWe're gonna use the magic of TV\ntimeouts and we'll come back and\n\n525\n00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:19.100\nwe'll move this process along so that you\ncan see what the finished product is.\n\n526\n00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:22.760\nAll right, here we can see now\nthat we have an installation.\n\n527\n00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:25.430\nThe clean installation is almost complete.\n\n528\n00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:29.442\nWe've got a few more choices that\nwe need to make, post installation.\n\n529\n00:27:29.442 --> 00:27:33.140\nIt's kinda like we made some\nbasic ones pre-installation and\n\n530\n00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:35.080\nthis is actually the clean installation.\n\n531\n00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:35.960\nAnd guess what?\n\n532\n00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:42.350\nOur windows 8.1 machine right here is\nactually on part of its upgrade as well.\n\n533\n00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:45.060\nSo they don't really look\ntoo much different, right?\n\n534\n00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:47.880\nSo if I go ahead, all I'm gonna\ndo here is I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n535\n00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.840\ncheck what my region is.\n\n536\n00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:56.222\nIt's gonna ask me, well, do you want to\ndo a couple of basics that we need to do?\n\n537\n00:27:56.222 --> 00:27:58.650\nAll right so we’ll go ahead and\nwe’ll move along.\n\n538\n00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:02.110\nThis one kind of skipped forward a little\nbit on me, so what I’m gonna go ahead and\n\n539\n00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:04.590\ndo, and it’s still skipping forward on me.\n\n540\n00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:05.387\nLet’s see here.\n\n541\n00:28:05.387 --> 00:28:09.352\nThere we go, we’ll show you it\nfrom this point, all right?\n\n542\n00:28:09.352 --> 00:28:13.604\nSo it’s asking me,\nwhat is the keyboard layout?\n\n543\n00:28:13.604 --> 00:28:15.978\nI’m gonna go ahead and choose, Yes.\n\n544\n00:28:15.978 --> 00:28:18.680\nDo I wanna add a second keyboard layout?\n\n545\n00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:22.590\nI’m gonna say go ahead and\nskip this, all right?\n\n546\n00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:25.630\nNow next thing it's gonna\ndo is it's gonna say hey,\n\n547\n00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:28.230\nare there any updates out there\nthat maybe we need to pull down?\n\n548\n00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:29.890\nSo it's doing that right there.\n\n549\n00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.742\nAnd the next thing that we're gonna\ndo is we're gonna do the network.\n\n550\n00:28:33.742 --> 00:28:38.835\nYou might have seen that on the upgrade\nedition it kind of skipped right\n\n551\n00:28:38.835 --> 00:28:44.170\nover that and that's because we\nalready got a network connection.\n\n552\n00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:48.600\nBut now it's asking me, do I wanna sign\nin with a Microsoft account, right?\n\n553\n00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.550\nThey're really pushing\nthe Microsoft account like we've\n\n554\n00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:51.770\ntalked about in other episodes.\n\n555\n00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:55.089\nBut what I'm gonna do is\njust a local account, and\n\n556\n00:28:55.089 --> 00:28:58.252\nthat's done through\nthe domain join instead,\n\n557\n00:28:58.252 --> 00:29:03.326\neven though technically I'm not joining\nthe domain right now, all right?\n\n558\n00:29:03.326 --> 00:29:06.121\nIt's gonna say hey,\nwho is gonna use this PC?\n\n559\n00:29:06.121 --> 00:29:09.448\nI gonna cal it admin01, all right?\n\n560\n00:29:09.448 --> 00:29:11.130\nAnd I'm gonna choose Next.\n\n561\n00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:15.520\nAnd we're going to create a super\nsecret Microsoft password.\n\n562\n00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:19.860\nAnd then we will confirm the password,\nand we will choose Next.\n\n563\n00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:23.407\nAnd then it's asking me for a hint, and\nI probably shouldn't put a portion of\n\n564\n00:29:23.407 --> 00:29:27.244\nyour password as the hint, but remember\nthis is for demonstration purposes only.\n\n565\n00:29:27.244 --> 00:29:27.988\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n566\n00:29:27.988 --> 00:29:32.090\n&gt;&gt; This is where we get to setup\nCortana as our personal assistant.\n\n567\n00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:33.750\nI'm gonna go ahead and say no for now.\n\n568\n00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:34.846\nJust kinda move through this.\n\n569\n00:29:34.846 --> 00:29:37.930\nYou can always change these later\nincluding the privacy settings.\n\n570\n00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:39.990\nWe'll go ahead and\njust accept the defaults.\n\n571\n00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:43.670\nRemember, the choices that you make now,\nyou can always go back and\n\n572\n00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:48.790\nchange them after the installation\nis finished, all right?\n\n573\n00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:50.060\nAnd it let's me know.\n\n574\n00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:54.501\nOkay that's the last step and now what\nit's gonna do is like we have talked about\n\n575\n00:29:54.501 --> 00:29:59.226\nin other episodes, it's gonna take what's\nbuilt into it, that default profile.\n\n576\n00:29:59.226 --> 00:30:02.236\nIt's gonna copy it down, it's gonna apply,\n\n577\n00:30:02.236 --> 00:30:07.270\nthat's what it's doing right now,\nit's building admin01's profile.\n\n578\n00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:11.738\nRemember like we talked about, it takes\nthe default, copies it like a template,\n\n579\n00:30:11.738 --> 00:30:14.084\nand then applies admin01's name to it.\n\n580\n00:30:14.084 --> 00:30:18.155\nAnd then once I log in,\nthat's gonna be where I store all my data.\n\n581\n00:30:18.155 --> 00:30:22.200\nNow, we've kind of moved through\na couple of these steps on the upgrade\n\n582\n00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.710\ninstallation, because I tell you,\nit's really the same.\n\n583\n00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:26.350\nYou didn't miss any of the steps.\n\n584\n00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:30.890\nIt's just how we do the installation\nthat differentiates the two.\n\n585\n00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:34.380\nWe'll do the same thing here,\nI'll keep it the way I had it before.\n\n586\n00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:38.820\nI'll call this admin02,\njust to keep it unique, choose Next.\n\n587\n00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:40.840\nWe'll also go ahead and\n\n588\n00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:45.780\nwe will type, if I can remember how\nto type, a super secret password.\n\n589\n00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:48.345\nAnd I don't think again\nI typed that right.\n\n590\n00:30:48.345 --> 00:30:49.780\nIt's probably gonna tell me.\n\n591\n00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:50.870\nAnd a hint for the password.\n\n592\n00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:54.400\nWell, we're gonna find out here in\na second if I typed the password the same.\n\n593\n00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.384\nThere we go.\nIf not, it'll error out and it'll say,\n\n594\n00:30:56.384 --> 00:30:57.289\nhey learn how to type.\n\n595\n00:30:57.289 --> 00:30:59.575\nNo it won't say that, it'll just say,\n[LAUGH] retype your password.\n\n596\n00:30:59.575 --> 00:31:04.901\n[LAUGH] And then we're gonna go ahead and\nwe'll accept the defaults here, all right?\n\n597\n00:31:04.901 --> 00:31:08.320\nAnd at any point I could be using Cortana,\nand it's doing the same thing.\n\n598\n00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.517\nIt's taking that user\naccount that we just created,\n\n599\n00:31:11.517 --> 00:31:15.923\nit's pulling the default profile down,\nand it's applying that name and\n\n600\n00:31:15.923 --> 00:31:19.135\ncreating now the admin02's profile,\nall right?\n\n601\n00:31:19.135 --> 00:31:23.306\nNotice that we've got two of these\nmachines that are kinda just sitting here\n\n602\n00:31:23.306 --> 00:31:23.900\nwaiting.\n\n603\n00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:27.150\nAgain, I do want you to keep in mind,\nright?\n\n604\n00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:31.003\nAs we wait here we'll see\nwhich one's faster, all right?\n\n605\n00:31:31.003 --> 00:31:34.856\nBut I know we're kinda running short on\ntime so I just wanna kinda go back over.\n\n606\n00:31:34.856 --> 00:31:39.340\nRemember, clean installation, we have\na bare metal hard drive, all right?\n\n607\n00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:42.120\nAnd we install the operating system for\nthe first time.\n\n608\n00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.970\nNow I will tell you on the Windows 8.1\n\n609\n00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:47.420\nmachine I could have done\na clean installation.\n\n610\n00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:52.522\nIf I would have booted to the optical\ndisk at the time the computer starts up,\n\n611\n00:31:52.522 --> 00:31:55.966\nWindows 8.1 doesn't even load up,\nall right?\n\n612\n00:31:55.966 --> 00:31:57.959\nAnd I can do a clean installation,\n\n613\n00:31:57.959 --> 00:32:02.120\nwiping completely the old\nWindows 8.1 Operating System.\n\n614\n00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:02.964\nAll right?\n\n615\n00:32:02.964 --> 00:32:05.524\nBut if I wanna do an upgrade installation,\n\n616\n00:32:05.524 --> 00:32:10.370\nthan what I have to do is I have to launch\nthat from inside of the operating system.\n\n617\n00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:12.746\nSo very important there,\nremember, remote installations.\n\n618\n00:32:12.746 --> 00:32:16.650\nRemote installations are those\ninstallations that actually happen across\n\n619\n00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:18.300\nthe network, right?\n\n620\n00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.380\nNetwork installations, if you will.\n\n621\n00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:23.825\nThe other type of installation you\nhave is removable media installation.\n\n622\n00:32:23.825 --> 00:32:25.881\nWe've been using an optical disk, right?\n\n623\n00:32:25.881 --> 00:32:26.760\nA DVD.\n\n624\n00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:31.600\nWell, I can actually take the contents of\nthat DVD, get a program that will apply\n\n625\n00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.850\nthat contents to a USB thumb drive, and\ninstead of booting to the optical disk,\n\n626\n00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:39.780\nwe plug it in a USB port, and\nprovided that most computers do today but\n\n627\n00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:44.300\nprovided your computer supports boot to\nUSB, you could say, hey, BIOS, look for\n\n628\n00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:48.730\nthat installation on that USB drive and\nwe can do the same thing there.\n\n629\n00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:50.930\nNow you can see that\nour Windows 10 machine,\n\n630\n00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:54.460\nwe've got a nice clean installation here,\nwe are ready to go.\n\n631\n00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:57.170\nAnd we've got an upgrade installation,\ntoo, let me go ahead and\n\n632\n00:32:57.170 --> 00:33:00.900\nshow you real quick what I was\nmeaning with the upgrade installation.\n\n633\n00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:04.720\nYou will have remnants of\nthe old Windows left behind.\n\n634\n00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.320\nThat's that Windows.old\nfolder I was telling you.\n\n635\n00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:10.040\nIf I was to try to get\nrid of this right here,\n\n636\n00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:13.860\nI'm not going to do this cuz I'd be\ntorturing you guys and gals out there.\n\n637\n00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:15.030\nThis is a system file.\n\n638\n00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:16.920\nEven though we know it's an old system,\n\n639\n00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:19.410\nwe don't need it anymore,\nWindows still protects it.\n\n640\n00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:21.560\nSo you get a whole bunch of access denied.\n\n641\n00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:25.280\nIf you want to actually\nclean that off of there,\n\n642\n00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:27.846\nremember in another episode we\ntalked about disk clean-up.\n\n643\n00:33:27.846 --> 00:33:32.725\nYou can right-click on Local Disk C,\nyou can choose Properties, and\n\n644\n00:33:32.725 --> 00:33:36.943\nthen from the General tab,\nyou can choose Disk Clean-up but\n\n645\n00:33:36.943 --> 00:33:40.601\nthe difference is you have\nto clean up system files.\n\n646\n00:33:40.601 --> 00:33:44.915\nSo this does require\nan administrative level account.\n\n647\n00:33:44.915 --> 00:33:46.610\nRight?\nYou can see with the little UAC\n\n648\n00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:47.738\nshield there.\n\n649\n00:33:47.738 --> 00:33:51.305\nI'm not gonna let this run to completion\ncuz we have talked about it and\n\n650\n00:33:51.305 --> 00:33:53.045\nit could take a good long while but\n\n651\n00:33:53.045 --> 00:33:57.295\nyou'll see, notice it says right\nthere Previous Windows installations.\n\n652\n00:33:57.295 --> 00:33:59.515\nThat's how you include\nthat in disk clean-up,\n\n653\n00:33:59.515 --> 00:34:03.095\nif you don't say clean up system files,\nit's not even gonna show up in the list.\n\n654\n00:34:03.095 --> 00:34:05.975\nSo those are a couple of\nthe different installation types.\n\n655\n00:34:05.975 --> 00:34:09.535\nKnow what it takes to get Windows\ninstalled, the installation methods that\n\n656\n00:34:09.535 --> 00:34:14.140\nyou would use, the types if you will and\nalso notice some of the architecture.\n\n657\n00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:17.190\nKnow what it means to be\n32-bit versus 64-bit.\n\n658\n00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:19.540\nKnow the RAM restrictions as well.\n\n659\n00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:22.820\nThese are some of the things you ought\nto know when when you sit your MTA exam.\n\n660\n00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:24.490\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful job, Wes.\n\n661\n00:34:24.490 --> 00:34:26.444\nIdentify installations and\n\n662\n00:34:26.444 --> 00:34:31.090\narchitecture types inside\nthe MTA Windows OS fundemantal series.\n\n663\n00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:33.780\nMake sure that you watch\nevery single episode too.\n\n664\n00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:34.540\nBecause it's good for you.\n\n665\n00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:36.490\nAnd while you're in that course library,\n\n666\n00:34:36.490 --> 00:34:39.740\nthere's thousands of other videos that\nare there to also help you go further.\n\n667\n00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:40.860\nCheck those out, too.\n\n668\n00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:42.370\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n669\n00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:44.680\nYou know a good IT pro is always learning.\n\n670\n00:34:44.680 -->

00:00:12.240\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.378\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n5\n00:00:13.378 --> 00:00:16.148\nAnd welcome to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:18.057\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n7\n00:00:18.057 --> 00:00:22.379\nin today's episode we are continuing on\nwith our MTA for Windows OS fundamentals.\n\n8\n00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:25.627\nAnd joining us in the studio yet\nagain lending his expertise to us,\n\n9\n00:00:25.627 --> 00:00:27.500\nour good friend, Mr. Wesley Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.683\nWes, welcome back man, how's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:28.683 --> 00:00:30.227\n&gt;&gt; Hey man, it's going great,\ngreat to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:30.227 --> 00:00:31.354\nThat's right,\n\n13\n00:00:31.354 --> 00:00:36.110\nwe are moving on when it comes to\nthe MTA OS fundamentals like Dan said.\n\n14\n00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.363\nAnd we're gonna be looking at, well,\napplications, and applications\n\n15\n00:00:39.363 --> 00:00:42.740\nare something that you have to\nunderstand when you go to sit that exam.\n\n16\n00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.480\nAnd we have basically a few\ndifferent types of applications.\n\n17\n00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.970\nAnd what I mean by type of applications\nis where do they run, in that context?\n\n18\n00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.480\nWhere do we get these applications, right?\n\n19\n00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.820\nSo we're gonna look at applications.\n\n20\n00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.510\nWe're also gonna look at a couple\nof security features, right?\n\n21\n00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.250\nWhen I download an application, and I'm\ngonna run it on this machine, is it safe?\n\n22\n00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.780\nI don't know.\n\n23\n00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.420\nWell, we're gonna talk about\nthe technology that's built in the Windows\n\n24\n00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.190\nthat helps us to kinda find out, right?\n\n25\n00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.870\nAre we aware of that application,\nits reputation, and\n\n26\n00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.470\nis it known for maybe installing things\nlike rootkits, right, viruses or malware?\n\n27\n00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.150\nWell, we wanna be aware of that, too.\n\n28\n00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.260\nWe're also gonna look at, well, how do\nwe configure our applications when it\n\n29\n00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.950\ncomes to our startup or\nboot process, right?\n\n30\n00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.218\nIn other episodes, Dan and I, I believe,\n\n31\n00:01:26.218 --> 00:01:30.124\nwe were talking about things like\nMSConfig, right, where it allows us to\n\n32\n00:01:30.124 --> 00:01:34.090\nmodify how our boot process is handled,\nright, modify our startup.\n\n33\n00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.690\nWe're also gonna look at how you can\ndo some configuration within your\n\n34\n00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.360\napplications to basically\nto optimize your system so\n\n35\n00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.550\nthat they don't run in your boot time.\n\n36\n00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.880\nSo we'll look at that as well today.\n\n37\n00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.030\nWe got all of that coming\nup here in this episode.\n\n38\n00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.990\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, we're talking apps\nhere, and you said there's multiple types,\n\n39\n00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.460\nso where do we start?\n\n40\n00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.877\n&gt;&gt; Well, one of the things we got to look\nat is where are they installed, right?\n\n41\n00:01:53.877 --> 00:01:56.189\nWe've got a couple of different\nways that they can be installed.\n\n42\n00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.501\nWhat I mean by that is, well,\n\n43\n00:01:57.501 --> 00:02:00.750\nsome can actually be installed\non the local hard drive.\n\n44\n00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.010\nOther times,\nyou might not wanna install, or\n\n45\n00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.105\nmaybe you don't even have the ability\nto install on the local drive.\n\n46\n00:02:07.105 --> 00:02:08.785\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] If it's the right way,\nthen yeah.\n\n47\n00:02:08.785 --> 00:02:10.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, absolutely,\nso let's go ahead, and\n\n48\n00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.100\nlet's look at what's known as\na local installation, right?\n\n49\n00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.780\nWhen we talk about a local installation,\nwe're talking about the fact that\n\n50\n00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.310\nthe application is running\non the local machine.\n\n51\n00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.860\nAnd it's consuming the local resources,\nright?\n\n52\n00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.692\nSo let's go ahead and\ndive right into that, right?\n\n53\n00:02:22.692 --> 00:02:25.997\nSo for instance, I have a Windows\ninstaller package right here, and you\n\n54\n00:02:25.997 --> 00:02:29.733\ncould see that the extensions, in fact,\nlet me go ahead and right-click on it and\n\n55\n00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:32.687\nbring up the properties here, and\nI believe this is an MSI file.\n\n56\n00:02:32.687 --> 00:02:35.991\nYou might see a couple of different\ntypes of extensions when it comes to\n\n57\n00:02:35.991 --> 00:02:36.780\napplications.\n\n58\n00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.051\nYou might see something this,\nwhere it's an MSI file.\n\n59\n00:02:39.051 --> 00:02:42.255\nI always remember for\nthe exam Microsoft Installer, right,\n\n60\n00:02:42.255 --> 00:02:46.135\nit's technically a Windows installer\nservice that runs in the background\n\n61\n00:02:46.135 --> 00:02:48.363\nthat allows this application to install.\n\n62\n00:02:48.363 --> 00:02:50.475\nWe also have what's known as an EXE,\nright?\n\n63\n00:02:50.475 --> 00:02:53.980\n.exe is also an application, and\nit can be an installer as well.\n\n64\n00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.260\nSo what would be the benefits, right?\n\n65\n00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.440\nWell, one of the things about\nhaving something like this,\n\n66\n00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.650\nwhere it's a Windows Installer Package,\nis that there are different things like\n\n67\n00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.260\nINI and INF files that are part of\nthe package, not just the executable.\n\n68\n00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.290\nAnd what they do is they keep\ntrack of the installation process.\n\n69\n00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.728\nThey also keep track of things\nlike down in the registry.\n\n70\n00:03:11.728 --> 00:03:15.164\nYou know that configuration area that I\nwas telling you is like a centralized\n\n71\n00:03:15.164 --> 00:03:18.018\ndatabase for all the configurations\nwithin a Windows system?\n\n72\n00:03:18.018 --> 00:03:21.880\nWell, it keeps track of where it\nmakes entries into the registry and\n\n73\n00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.790\nit modifies the registry.\n\n74\n00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:24.520\nAnd that's important,\n\n75\n00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.650\nbecause what can happen when\nyou use just basic executables?\n\n76\n00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.490\nSometimes basic executables,\nthey don't keep track of all that.\n\n77\n00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.750\nSo what ends up happening is that when\nyou go to remove the application,\n\n78\n00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.000\nif it's an MSI file, it can look at the\nINF file or the INI file, depending on how\n\n79\n00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.790\nthey implement, and say, okay, I see, I\nmade these modifications to the registry.\n\n80\n00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.100\nI need to undo those, right, and\nbring it back to its original state.\n\n81\n00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.650\nAnd that's good, because executables\nsometimes won't do that, right?\n\n82\n00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.299\nThey'll leave their remnants\ndown in the registry, and\n\n83\n00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.389\nyou can start basically clustering\nthe registry pretty good, and\n\n84\n00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:58.051\nwhat ends up happening is you get what\nwe call tattooing the registry, right?\n\n85\n00:03:58.051 --> 00:04:01.178\nAnd all that means is not literally that\nyou are sitting under the ink pen for\n\n86\n00:04:01.178 --> 00:04:01.732\nfour hours.\n\n87\n00:04:01.732 --> 00:04:05.428\nWhat it means is that you're leaving\nremnants behind in the operating system at\n\n88\n00:04:05.428 --> 00:04:06.318\nthe lowest level.\n\n89\n00:04:06.318 --> 00:04:09.140\nAnd what happens is it can over time,\nit can corrupt,\n\n90\n00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.860\nit can eventually lead to performance\ndegradation on your computer.\n\n91\n00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.698\nSo MSI files really are the way to go,\nbut if you see the executables,\n\n92\n00:04:16.698 --> 00:04:18.730\n.exe extensions,\nI wouldn't stay away from them.\n\n93\n00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.910\nI wouldn't be worried about it,\nbut I would keep them in mind.\n\n94\n00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.370\nThe other thing, too, is that when you\nneed to do things in an enterprise\n\n95\n00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.490\nenvironment, right, MSI files,\nthey can actually be put on a server, and\n\n96\n00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.080\nyou can deploy these out to multiple\nmachines across your networks.\n\n97\n00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.470\nExecutables, you can't do that,\nit's not the same way.\n\n98\n00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.198\nSo if you wanna do deployment to a single\napplication on multiple computers across\n\n99\n00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:44.950\nyour network,\nthen MSI files are the way to go.\n\n100\n00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.840\nNow, that being said, one of the things\nthat we wanna do is we wanna go ahead and\n\n101\n00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.370\njust double-click the executable.\n\n102\n00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.710\nNow you're gonna see that it's gonna come\nup with just whatever the end-user license\n\n103\n00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.190\nagreement might be.\n\n104\n00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.350\nAgain, I just happened to be\nusing a Microsoft-specific type\n\n105\n00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.580\nof application here, again,\nbecause it's an MTA exam.\n\n106\n00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.690\nThis goes for\nall third-party applications, right?\n\n107\n00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.490\nAnd they're not really calling out\nthird-party applications versus\n\n108\n00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.420\nMicrosoft applications, but hey, one of\nthe great things is if you're not aware of\n\n109\n00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.140\nthe Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer,\nyou should be.\n\n110\n00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.160\nIt's a great utility and\nit allows you to take security baselines.\n\n111\n00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.260\nBut let's go ahead, and\nwe'll next do our installer process here.\n\n112\n00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.600\nAnd we're gonna go ahead, and\nwe will sign on to the EULA, all right.\n\n113\n00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.680\n&gt;&gt; Very common elements in just\nabout all installers, right?\n\n114\n00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.270\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n115\n00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.690\n&gt;&gt; Do you wish to install this?\n\n116\n00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.870\nKind of, don't forget to make\nsure that we are not liable for\n\n117\n00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.251\nany stupid thing you do with this.\n\n118\n00:05:36.251 --> 00:05:37.094\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and\n\n119\n00:05:37.094 --> 00:05:39.546\nif it causes problems to your computer,\nwe're not gonna be liable to it.\n\n120\n00:05:39.546 --> 00:05:40.869\n&gt;&gt; And that's not our fault.\n\n121\n00:05:40.869 --> 00:05:42.090\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n122\n00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.510\nAnd it is important to\nunderstand the EULA.\n\n123\n00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:45.630\nNow, don't get me wrong.\n\n124\n00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.630\nI am not gonna be testing Dan at the end\nof this episode on subsection B,\n\n125\n00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.060\nclause 52, whatever A, right?\n\n126\n00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.460\nBut I will tell you you\nhave to be careful because\n\n127\n00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.840\nif you're in a corporate environment,\nthey do have personal use license,\n\n128\n00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.240\nwhich means just because you bought it,\ndoesn't technically authorize you to\n\n129\n00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.200\nactually use it inside of\na corporate environment.\n\n130\n00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.230\nSo you do have to pay attention to\nthings like licensing restrictions.\n\n131\n00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.950\nSo understand what you're installing,\nespecially in a corporate environment.\n\n132\n00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.220\nIn a home environment, we still have to\nfollow the end-user license agreement,\n\n133\n00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.080\nbut a lot of times,\nthey're gonna be set up for personal use.\n\n134\n00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.140\nWhat is the difference between a\ncommercial license and a personal license?\n\n135\n00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.300\nSometimes thousands of\ndollars really is what it is.\n\n136\n00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.420\nSo just be aware, right?\n\n137\n00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.803\nSo we'll go and\nchoose Next to this, right,\n\n138\n00:06:27.803 --> 00:06:30.830\nand we could change the default locations.\n\n139\n00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.873\nUnless you have a really\ngood reason to do this,\n\n140\n00:06:32.873 --> 00:06:34.874\nI would just leave it in the defaults,\nright?\n\n141\n00:06:34.874 --> 00:06:38.830\nFor instance, you can see that when your\napplications are actually installed,\n\n142\n00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.273\nright, we have a location here,\nProgram Files,\n\n143\n00:06:41.273 --> 00:06:44.140\nand you can see \\Microsoft\nBaseline Security Analyzer.\n\n144\n00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.770\nNow before I go any farther,\n\n145\n00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.080\nI want you to know a little bit\nabout your folder hierarchy here.\n\n146\n00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.300\nAnd we'll talk more about the folder\nhierarchy when we talk about file systems\n\n147\n00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.040\nand stuff.\n\n148\n00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:58.060\nBut I do want you, if you get into\nLocal Disk (C:) in your File Explorer.\n\n149\n00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.610\nYou're gonna notice you have Program\nFiles, and you have Program Files (x86).\n\n150\n00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.670\nSo why do I have this redundancy, right?\n\n151\n00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.295\nThis isn't about fault tolerance or\nrecovery here.\n\n152\n00:07:06.295 --> 00:07:09.479\nBut the x86 is Microsoft's implementation.\n\n153\n00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:10.872\nCheck out our architecture episodes.\n\n154\n00:07:10.872 --> 00:07:15.820\nThat's 32-bit applications, right,\nbecause they have what is known as\n\n155\n00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:19.476\na 64-bit subsystem basically\nallows you to operate or\n\n156\n00:07:19.476 --> 00:07:23.528\nrun 32-bit applications on\na 64-bit operating system.\n\n157\n00:07:23.528 --> 00:07:28.750\nIf you see Program Files here, without\nthe x86, that's your 64-bit application,\n\n158\n00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:33.230\nso it's kind of a telltale sign if\nyou're installing one of these programs.\n\n159\n00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:37.130\nAnd you can kinda see here,\nright from the installer part, that hey,\n\n160\n00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.618\nthis is a 64-bit application because\nof where's it located, right?\n\n161\n00:07:40.618 --> 00:07:44.990\nRemember, 64-bit applications,\nthey do have the potential to scale up and\n\n162\n00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.790\nuse a lot more memory a little\nbit more efficiently.\n\n163\n00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.804\nSo that might be something that you also\nhave to pay attention to when you're\n\n164\n00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:51.805\nconfiguring your apps.\n\n165\n00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:55.988\nThey're not really expressly called out\nin the exam objectives here when we talk\n\n166\n00:07:55.988 --> 00:07:57.848\nabout configuring applications.\n\n167\n00:07:57.848 --> 00:08:01.546\nBut it is something that you should know\nbecause That could be a deal breaker when\n\n168\n00:08:01.546 --> 00:08:04.485\nit comes to what applications\nyou're gonna be using, right?\n\n169\n00:08:04.485 --> 00:08:08.543\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and we're not\ngonna change anything here, just kinda\n\n170\n00:08:08.543 --> 00:08:12.201\nwanted to mention that folder hierarchy so\nyou know why we have two different\n\n171\n00:08:12.201 --> 00:08:16.340\nprogram file locations and we'll go ahead\nand click, and we will run the Installer.\n\n172\n00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.591\nNow, I will show you here, notice that it\nsays Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer,\n\n173\n00:08:21.591 --> 00:08:23.830\nand the UAC kicks in,\nthe User Account Control.\n\n174\n00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.170\nThat's another thing that we have to\nunderstand when we're configuring\n\n175\n00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:27.210\napplications.\n\n176\n00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:30.810\nIf you're applications make modifications\nto the registry, or they change things\n\n177\n00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:36.110\nlike your key security setting, the user\naccount control is going to kick in and\n\n178\n00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:39.630\nit's gonna require administrative level\naccount in order to do this, right?\n\n179\n00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:41.330\nIf you're in mix base systems, Linux and\n\n180\n00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.800\nUnix, you have to be a root user in\norder to install certain programs.\n\n181\n00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.950\nWell, that's really no\ndifferent here in Windows and\n\n182\n00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:48.410\nthe user account controller is gonna say,\n\n183\n00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:52.640\nhey, do you wanna allow this application\nto make changes to your device?\n\n184\n00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.290\nNow, I will tell you that if we\nlook at show more details here,\n\n185\n00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:59.260\nnotice that it says verified publisher,\nMicrosoft Corporation.\n\n186\n00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.030\nWell, I talked about\nthe way our computers,\n\n187\n00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:07.080\nif you will, will verify if\nan application is known and trusted.\n\n188\n00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.270\nWell, that's through something known\nas the Windows SmartScreen Filter.\n\n189\n00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:14.900\nAnd it looks like I interrupted\nthe installer so let's try that again.\n\n190\n00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:19.470\nIt didn't like me interrupting the UAC\nthere, which is why we have the UAC, so\n\n191\n00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.070\nit can't do any kinda\nlittle side channel attack.\n\n192\n00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:23.360\nWe'll go ahead and install.\n\n193\n00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:29.200\nBut what's happening here if I get back to\nit, it is checking a digital certificate.\n\n194\n00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.950\nAnd a digital certificate\nis just verifying that hey,\n\n195\n00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:33.850\nthis is coming from the publisher.\n\n196\n00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:36.840\nAnd then another technology that we'll\nlook at a little bit more in detail,\n\n197\n00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.260\nWindows SmartScreen filter,\nactually looks at the certificate and\n\n198\n00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.170\nit reaches out to your certificate store,\nand it says hey,\n\n199\n00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:48.930\ndo I trust the certificate that I find\nthat is attached to this software,\n\n200\n00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:52.450\nverifying that the software,\nwell, a couple of things, right?\n\n201\n00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:56.270\nThat it hasn't been modified in transit,\nand that we know who it came from, right?\n\n202\n00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:00.710\nSo basically, it keeps your\nmachine a little bit more secure.\n\n203\n00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:03.580\nI'm going to go ahead say okay to this,\nand we'll go ahead and\n\n204\n00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.490\nwe will continue with\nthe installation process.\n\n205\n00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:09.340\nNow, when we run this, I do want\nyou to understand that sometimes it\n\n206\n00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.490\ncreates a shortcut,\nsometimes they don't create a shortcut.\n\n207\n00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:15.900\nBut when you're running your local\napplications, and again, here's\n\n208\n00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:19.750\nthe User Account Control saying hey,\nyou can make some potential modifications.\n\n209\n00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:22.480\nSo again, it does require\nadministrative level privileges.\n\n210\n00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.310\nNow, this isn't an episode on\nMicrosoft Baseline Security Analyzer.\n\n211\n00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.690\nBut what I do wanna do\nhere is I wanna bring up,\n\n212\n00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:32.250\nlet me go ahead and close down\nthe User Account Control settings.\n\n213\n00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.470\nAnd I do wanna bring up the Task Manager.\n\n214\n00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:39.610\nAnd I wanna show you that when you are\nrunning one of these applications locally,\n\n215\n00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:41.780\nyou're using the resources,\n\n216\n00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.680\nconsuming the resources of the local\nmachine that it's running on.\n\n217\n00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.760\nYou're using its CPU, you're using\nits RAM, you're using its Memory, its\n\n218\n00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:52.970\nhard drive, its Its network, if it happens\nto be a network-aware application, right?\n\n219\n00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:56.320\nSo you're using the machine's\nlocal resources.\n\n220\n00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:00.080\nAnd that might be a deal breaker if you're\ntrying to support some kind of application\n\n221\n00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.580\nthat you're trying or attempting maybe\nto run on a machine that doesn't have\n\n222\n00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.890\na lot of RAM, but maybe doesn't\nhave a lot of hard drive space,\n\n223\n00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:09.610\nmaybe doesn't have a really\ngood network adapter.\n\n224\n00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:11.740\nI know that's kind of gone by the wayside,\n\n225\n00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:13.920\nif you will,\ncuz computers just get faster and faster.\n\n226\n00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.470\nBut you never know.\n\n227\n00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:18.310\nYou never know when you're gonna\ncome across the problem where\n\n228\n00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:21.510\nthe application can't run on\na certain machine, right?\n\n229\n00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:25.960\nOr it could just have compatibility\nissues in the fact that it's not made for\n\n230\n00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.220\nWindows 10.\n\n231\n00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.010\nLet me give you an example\nof what I mean by that.\n\n232\n00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:31.170\nAnd this brings us into our\nnext type of installation,\n\n233\n00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:32.690\nand that's a network installation.\n\n234\n00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:34.720\nAll right, let me go ahead and\nclose this down.\n\n235\n00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.710\nAll right, and what we're gonna\ndo is I'm gonna go ahead, and\n\n236\n00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:40.975\nI'm gonna go down to Cortana here,\nin our search field.\n\n237\n00:11:40.975 --> 00:11:43.615\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead, and\nI'm gonna bring up calculator.\n\n238\n00:11:43.615 --> 00:11:47.735\nAnd when I bring up calculator, notice\nthat, if you aren't familiar with Windows\n\n239\n00:11:47.735 --> 00:11:51.535\n10, you might be familiar with\nthe old calculator interface.\n\n240\n00:11:51.535 --> 00:11:52.885\nWell that's gone.\n\n241\n00:11:52.885 --> 00:11:56.735\nAnd what this will do is give you\na classic example of why you might want to\n\n242\n00:11:56.735 --> 00:11:58.255\nuse a network application.\n\n243\n00:11:58.255 --> 00:12:01.105\nSee a network application is one\nthat you're gonna to connect to\n\n244\n00:12:01.105 --> 00:12:05.240\nover the network, and\nthere are benefits to that.\n\n245\n00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.040\nFirst of all, we get what is known\nas application coexistence and\n\n246\n00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:11.000\nwe also get the ability to\nrun an application that\n\n247\n00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.630\nmight not natively run\non your local machine.\n\n248\n00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:14.130\nWhy?\n\n249\n00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:17.570\nBecause you’re going to connect over\nthe network and your going to connect back\n\n250\n00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:22.590\ninto a server that does have that power,\ndoes have the resources and you can run\n\n251\n00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:27.830\nthe application on that remotely, if you\nwill, but you're viewing it locally.\n\n252\n00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.670\nSo even though you're viewing it\nlocally like it's running locally,\n\n253\n00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:31.800\nthere's a little magic.\n\n254\n00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.380\nDon't look behind the curtain,\n\n255\n00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:36.140\nthe Wizard of Oz is here because you're\nactually connected over the network, and\n\n256\n00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.640\nyou're running it on whatever\nthe remote machine is.\n\n257\n00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.700\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n258\n00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:44.180\nSo for instance, if I bring up a web\nbrowser, and let me go ahead and\n\n259\n00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.560\nstop it from connecting here.\n\n260\n00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.170\nAnd I type in something like http.\n\n261\n00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:50.450\nActually, looks like we've\nalready got auto fill coming in.\n\n262\n00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:55.630\nAnd we connect to our remote desktop\nweb services here across the network.\n\n263\n00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:59.990\nAll right, now understand and\nnotice it's saying hey, this isn't secure.\n\n264\n00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:01.300\nYou probably don't want to do this.\n\n265\n00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.070\nIt's because the server that\nI'm connecting to has a self\n\n266\n00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:04.780\nsigned certificate.\n\n267\n00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:06.430\nThis would be inside of my corporation.\n\n268\n00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:07.860\n&gt;&gt; So it's your server, so you trust it.\n\n269\n00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.125\n&gt;&gt; It is my server, absolutely.\n\n270\n00:13:09.125 --> 00:13:13.466\nSo they're letting you know when\nthe browser recognizes that.\n\n271\n00:13:13.466 --> 00:13:16.860\nRemember I told you about the certificate\nand verifying the application, well,\n\n272\n00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:20.100\nit's doing its job here and it's saying,\nhey, I don't know that server.\n\n273\n00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.550\nI don't recognize it's little\ndigital driver's license,\n\n274\n00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:25.610\nits digital ID if you will,\nthat certificate.\n\n275\n00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.820\nBut it'll say, do you wanna go ahead and\ngo to the web page?\n\n276\n00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:32.240\nIn this case I'm gonna go ahead and go to\nthe webpage again because this is a server\n\n277\n00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.370\nthat I've stood up and actually got\na remote application that we can run.\n\n278\n00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.530\nSo notice that I'm in a web browser,\nright?\n\n279\n00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:41.850\nDan and I were actually talking about\nthis prior to the episode starting.\n\n280\n00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:44.770\nTechnically, your web browser is\nkinda like a network application,\n\n281\n00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:45.640\nbecause what does it do?\n\n282\n00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.520\nWell, when it launches up,\nit's gotta connect to a web server.\n\n283\n00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:52.170\nIt's gonna ask for a resource based on\nwhat you type or how you interact with it,\n\n284\n00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:56.020\nand the web server's gonna deliver that,\nbasically the HTML\n\n285\n00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:00.030\nover an http connection, back to\nyour web browser, and it renders it.\n\n286\n00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:04.090\nSo technically that is\na network application,\n\n287\n00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:06.300\nbut very anti-climatic, right?\n\n288\n00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.240\nWe use those every day.\n\n289\n00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:12.700\nSo imagine being able to run two\napplications side by side, right?\n\n290\n00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:15.910\nIf you think about it, anytime I\nwanna run an older application and\n\n291\n00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:19.400\na newer application on the same machine,\nwhat do I have to do?\n\n292\n00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.350\nA lot of times, I have to uninstall\nthe old application, or if I install\n\n293\n00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:24.930\na new application, it says hey,\nyou're running an older version of this.\n\n294\n00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:27.180\nWe're gonna actually\nupgrade your application.\n\n295\n00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:30.150\nSo you never get the ability to\nactually run them side by side.\n\n296\n00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:33.280\nAnd in testing purposes, you might wanna\ntest the new application before you\n\n297\n00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.900\nactually move to it, or\nthe backwards compatibility,\n\n298\n00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.934\nyou might still be using\nan older line of business app.\n\n299\n00:14:38.934 --> 00:14:41.140\nSo that go ahead and connect.\n\n300\n00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:46.060\nAll right, what I'm go do is I'm actually\nconnecting to the web server here and\n\n301\n00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:50.010\nI'm gonna pull down what's known as a\nremote desktop protocol file, an RDP file.\n\n302\n00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:53.970\nAnd you'll notice that we're actually\nin what's known as remote app.\n\n303\n00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.740\nWhat we're using is a remote\ndesktop connection to connect\n\n304\n00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:01.100\nover the network back to that server and\npull down, in this case,\n\n305\n00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:06.810\nthe classic calculator that maybe\nyou're kind of familiar with.\n\n306\n00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:08.880\nSo this isn't in Windows 10.\n\n307\n00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.710\nSo, the interesting thing here is I\nget that application coexistence.\n\n308\n00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:16.710\nI get to run a newer version of an\napplication that might cause problems if I\n\n309\n00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:19.590\nwas to try to run it when the old\napplication still exists.\n\n310\n00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:22.180\nSo, that's another great thing\nabout network applications.\n\n311\n00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:26.040\nThe other things is, if this computer\ndoesn't support the application you're\n\n312\n00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.780\nrunning on, it doesn't matter,\nbecause it's running on another device and\n\n313\n00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:30.170\nall we're doing is connecting to it.\n\n314\n00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:31.070\nWe're over the network.\n\n315\n00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:34.110\nWe're actually viewing it locally,\neven though it's running remotely.\n\n316\n00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:37.790\nAnd let me go ahead and prove that to\nyou by bringing back our task manager.\n\n317\n00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:42.340\nAll right, if I look,\nlet me do fewer details, make it easier,\n\n318\n00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:43.400\nwe can cycle through.\n\n319\n00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:47.058\nNotice I've got calculator here, and\nI have Remote Desktop Connection.\n\n320\n00:15:47.058 --> 00:15:50.759\nIt doesn't give me the classic\npicture of calculator and why is that?\n\n321\n00:15:50.759 --> 00:15:51.964\nWell, because calculator,\n\n322\n00:15:51.964 --> 00:15:54.912\ntechnically, the classic calculator\nisn't running on this machine.\n\n323\n00:15:54.912 --> 00:15:57.834\nIt's actually running on the server and\nI'm viewing it on a window.\n\n324\n00:15:57.834 --> 00:16:02.390\nHowever, one of the great things about\nthis is it does give me the ability to see\n\n325\n00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:05.060\nit as though I was locally running it.\n\n326\n00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:09.240\nNow from a systems\nadministration stand point,\n\n327\n00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.370\nright, what does this allow me to do?\n\n328\n00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:14.100\nWell, I want you to think about\napplications, how, you know,\n\n329\n00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:18.640\nwe install one application right here, the\nMicrosoft security baseline analyzer and\n\n330\n00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.380\nthat was for one machine.\n\n331\n00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.460\nImagine if somebody says that hey,\nyou need to update your application.\n\n332\n00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.010\nWell now you're gonna stand up and\noperate server you've to\n\n333\n00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:30.520\npush up the applications updates\nto all your different devices.\n\n334\n00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:35.010\nVery even though it can be centralized\nit's kind of a complexity, right?\n\n335\n00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:37.260\nSo if that happened to\nbe this application and\n\n336\n00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.670\nI am just using the local\napplications to as an example.\n\n337\n00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:44.260\nThen I have to go update every\nsingle application on every machine.\n\n338\n00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:50.160\nHowever, with learning something like\nremote desktop connection software,\n\n339\n00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.950\nwe can actually update the application in\none location right there in the server and\n\n340\n00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:58.260\ndeploy it in one location and\njust have everybody connect back to it.\n\n341\n00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:02.050\nSo, network applications definitely\nhave their advantages and\n\n342\n00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:05.400\nthey can definitely make life a little bit\neasier for your systems administration.\n\n343\n00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.340\nWhen it comes to supporting that\napplication, the maintenance,\n\n344\n00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.100\nthe upkeep if you will and configuration.\n\n345\n00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:13.430\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthat's super cool to be able to be like\n\n346\n00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:14.980\n&gt;&gt; Open an application that's not even\n\n347\n00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:16.540\non your system.\n\n348\n00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:17.710\nAnd remember, application,\n\n349\n00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:21.110\nwe're just talking any program that's\ninstalled on somewhere, right?\n\n350\n00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:25.192\nOn your computer or now,\n[LAUGH] could be even a remote computer.\n\n351\n00:17:25.192 --> 00:17:26.225\nVery cool stuff.\n\n352\n00:17:26.225 --> 00:17:30.220\nNow, we looked in a previous\nepisode about there's an area\n\n353\n00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:32.960\nwhere we looked at startup applications.\n\n354\n00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.990\nApplications that when\nI start my computer,\n\n355\n00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:38.950\nit fires off a series of different\n&gt;&gt; Applications to make\n\n356\n00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.360\nsure that my computer's doing\nthings that I want it to do.\n\n357\n00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.450\nCan we talk about that a little bit?\n\n358\n00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:43.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, most definitely.\n\n359\n00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:46.160\nAnd that's where when you\ninstall an application,\n\n360\n00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.580\nsometimes it puts services\nthat it needs to run.\n\n361\n00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:51.650\nAnd well,\nsometimes it needs to run automatically.\n\n362\n00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:52.780\nI'll give you a classic example.\n\n363\n00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.970\nAny kind of security software that\nyou have running on your machine,\n\n364\n00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:58.480\nyou want it starting as early\nas possible in the boot process.\n\n365\n00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.940\nAnd I don't wanna forget to do it.\n\n366\n00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.340\n&gt;&gt; And you don't wanna forget to do it,\nso it does it for you, right?\n\n367\n00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:02.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n368\n00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.110\nsometimes you have\napplications that technically,\n\n369\n00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:07.670\ndon't really need to run at startup,\nright?\n\n370\n00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:08.760\n&gt;&gt; Calculator.\n\n371\n00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.340\n&gt;&gt; Calculator's a classic example.\n\n372\n00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:14.630\nI don't need calculator starting\nup the moment I start my computer.\n\n373\n00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:18.390\nSo we can make modifications to\nhow the applications start up.\n\n374\n00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:21.600\nHowever, I do want you\nto keep in mind that\n\n375\n00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.610\nthey're in a couple of\ndifferent locations.\n\n376\n00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:26.395\nWhen we talk about where we find,\n\n377\n00:18:26.395 --> 00:18:31.680\nthe way we modify those startup types.\n\n378\n00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:35.050\nAnd what I mean by that is,\nwhen Windows 8.1 came out,\n\n379\n00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.310\nthey changed how you do this.\n\n380\n00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:40.000\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n381\n00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.140\nI've got a Windows 8.1 machine.\n\n382\n00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:46.960\nAnd prior to Windows 8.1, looks like I'm\nlogged out I'm going to log back in.\n\n383\n00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:51.620\nPrior to Windows 8.1,\nI could launch up MS config,\n\n384\n00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.810\nin fact I'm in the wrong area here,\nlet me get on the right side of the river.\n\n385\n00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:59.150\nI could launch up system configuration\nutility because this is how we modify our.\n\n386\n00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:02.500\nAttributes of how the computer starts up.\n\n387\n00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.540\nAnd we could go to the Startup tab here.\n\n388\n00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:07.630\nAnd we could manage startup items,\nbasically our applications,\n\n389\n00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:11.300\nputting their services or\nfunctionality in our startup, right?\n\n390\n00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:15.980\nAnd notice it says,\nto manage startup type, startup items,\n\n391\n00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:19.640\nit says,\nuse the startup section of Task Manager.\n\n392\n00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:23.490\nAs of Windows 8 and\nbeyond this is the way we do it.\n\n393\n00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:28.938\nHowever, if we're in a Windows 7 machine,\nwe'll go ahead and get logged in here.\n\n394\n00:19:28.938 --> 00:19:32.980\nI think, [LAUGH] yeah we'll go ahead and\nget logged into Windows 7,\n\n395\n00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:34.980\nlet me show you the old\nway we used to do this.\n\n396\n00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:40.050\nSo just in case it comes up on the exam,\nyou are gonna be prepared for this.\n\n397\n00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:43.930\nSo if I type in same thing here, not\nreally typing anything different, right,\n\n398\n00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:44.600\nmsconfig.\n\n399\n00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.350\nWe're gonna bring up the system\nconfiguration utility on the Windows\n\n400\n00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:48.380\n7 machine.\n\n401\n00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:51.080\nHowever, one of the things that\nyou're gonna notice is the difference\n\n402\n00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.160\nis that startup tab, right?\n\n403\n00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:59.490\nUp until Windows 8, if you wanted\nto basically modify the startup,\n\n404\n00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:02.220\nwhat you would do is you would come\nup to that Startup tab, right?\n\n405\n00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.370\nAnd here's what I was talking about,\nDan, earlier, right?\n\n406\n00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:06.760\nSo I have Microsoft Security Client,\n\n407\n00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.650\nthis is actually part of\nthe Microsoft Security Essentials.\n\n408\n00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:12.840\nYou don't have to worry about that in\ntoday's day, cuz of defender that's built\n\n409\n00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:18.110\ninto Windows 10, has securities essentials\nfunctionality built right into it.\n\n410\n00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:20.780\nSo I probably wouldn't\nwanna disable this one.\n\n411\n00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.900\nAgain, you wanna keep\nyour computers secure.\n\n412\n00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:26.060\nAnd I'm not gonna disable this one,\neither, but I could, right?\n\n413\n00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:27.065\n&gt;&gt; No?\nThat'd make a fun show.\n\n414\n00:20:27.065 --> 00:20:29.390\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that'd make a real fun show for\n\n415\n00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:30.910\nthe virtualization technology.\n\n416\n00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:34.350\nAnd what I could do is I could take\nthem out of my startup process, right?\n\n417\n00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:40.260\nAnd I could say, go ahead and apply that\nI don't wanna have them launching a book.\n\n418\n00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:43.200\nThis is gonna optimize your\nbook performances as well.\n\n419\n00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:48.630\nAgain like I said that is not\nthe way you do this in Windows 8 and\n\n420\n00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:53.420\nbeyond this happens to be Windows 8.1 box,\nwe go to Task Manager, and\n\n421\n00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:57.830\nyou will see that we have\na series of utilities here.\n\n422\n00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:00.120\nAnd it tells you what\nthe startup impact is.\n\n423\n00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.260\nAnd if we kinda do a little\nhover to discover,\n\n424\n00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:06.240\nyou can see the degree of impact from CPU\nand disk activity measured during startup.\n\n425\n00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.670\nAnd update it with each restart, right?\n\n426\n00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:14.240\nSo you can see that this one, again,\nI'm not gonna disable my VMware tools,\n\n427\n00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.550\nbecause it's part of the virtualization\nsoftware that I use, but\n\n428\n00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:19.200\nnotice that start-up impacts is high,\nall right?\n\n429\n00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.110\nWell I might want to come in here and\nI might want to disable this, right?\n\n430\n00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:24.350\nOr search online,\nfind out the properties of it.\n\n431\n00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:30.250\nSo do a little bit of research,\ndon't just, if you will disable these and\n\n432\n00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:33.210\nthink that you are optimizing things when,\nespecially when it\n\n433\n00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:36.610\ncomes to something like security, you\nmight actually be crippling your system.\n\n434\n00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:40.270\nAgain if we move over to Windows 10, same\nthing, second verse same as the first.\n\n435\n00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:42.070\nIf I open up Task Manager,\n\n436\n00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:45.270\nTask Manager by default doesn't\nshow you a lot of information.\n\n437\n00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.780\nYou have to, remember like we've\nshowed you in other episodes,\n\n438\n00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.880\nyou have to choose more details.\n\n439\n00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.430\nAnd you also have the start up too.\n\n440\n00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:55.740\nNow this is one of the reasons I save\nthis one, the greatest for last, Dan.\n\n441\n00:21:55.740 --> 00:22:01.600\nBecause there is one in this\nlist that I am not using at all.\n\n442\n00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:02.480\nBut it shows up.\n\n443\n00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.900\nIt puts itself to my startup type and\nit's got a very high impact.\n\n444\n00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:07.910\nI mean, I'm just-\n&gt;&gt; OneDrive.\n\n445\n00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:12.110\n&gt;&gt; I'm not getting specific here,\nI'm just saying OneDrive, [LAUGH] right?\n\n446\n00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:13.670\n&gt;&gt; You gotta give me a hand here, Wes.\n\n447\n00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:14.605\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sorry, man.\n\n448\n00:22:14.605 --> 00:22:16.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if you open this up,\n\n449\n00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:20.290\nyou can see that there are a lot\nof things that are kind of\n\n450\n00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:24.570\n&gt;&gt; Basically they're nested under one\n\n451\n00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:25.540\ndrive, right?\n\n452\n00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:28.390\nSo this is going to really,\nreally impact our startup type.\n\n453\n00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:29.630\nSo I might wanna go ahead.\n\n454\n00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:33.480\nFirst, I'll collapse this and\nthen I might wanna disable it, right.\n\n455\n00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.490\nAnd when you disable.\n\n456\n00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:36.760\nLet me see if it will refresh.\n\n457\n00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:39.080\nIt doesn't look it's refreshing.\n\n458\n00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.940\nWell, for whatever reason it's.\n\n459\n00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:43.440\nYou can do F5 on this one.\n\n460\n00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.550\nUsed to be able to, there we go.\n\n461\n00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:48.340\nNo, it is disabled, I'm sorry.\n\n462\n00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:49.320\nSo, here we go.\n\n463\n00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.020\nSo you can see that now\nthat it is disabled.\n\n464\n00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:54.130\nAnd this says, hey, modify the boot\nprocess, take this service out.\n\n465\n00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:57.930\nNow, I'm not doubting OneDrive,\nOneDrive's a great cloud storage platform.\n\n466\n00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:00.650\nBut if you're not using it,\nwhy should I have it?\n\n467\n00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:04.400\nIn there, always trying to\nconnect out to Microsoft account,\n\n468\n00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.020\nalways trying to connect out to\nthe cloud if I'm not using it, right?\n\n469\n00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:10.360\nSo this is one of those things that\nyou can take out of your boot process.\n\n470\n00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.970\nAll right, so let's see other\nthings that we might have to do.\n\n471\n00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:16.040\nWe might have to install Windows features,\nright?\n\n472\n00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:20.050\nWindows features, there are extra features\nthat are built into the Windows operating\n\n473\n00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:24.450\nsystem that their installation files,\nand the files that they use to run,\n\n474\n00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:27.330\nthey're not currently installed\non the operating system, right?\n\n475\n00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:30.086\nSo, sometimes you need to go turn them on,\nand\n\n476\n00:23:30.086 --> 00:23:33.095\nwe talked about Hyper-V\nin another episode too.\n\n477\n00:23:33.095 --> 00:23:37.870\nHyper-V is the virtualization platform\nthat allows you to run virtual machines\n\n478\n00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:41.000\non your local client\noperating system here.\n\n479\n00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.640\nWell, your computer has to support it.\n\n480\n00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.420\nIt has to support,\n\n481\n00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:49.050\nit's gotta be 64 bits, gotta have\na processor that supports virtualization.\n\n482\n00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:51.725\nThat processor, the virtualization\ntechnology has to be enabled.\n\n483\n00:23:51.725 --> 00:23:54.313\nSometimes, you'll see\nfeatures are available and\n\n484\n00:23:54.313 --> 00:23:56.500\nsometimes you'll see that they won't be.\n\n485\n00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:00.630\nSo if we right click on our window\nstyle and we choose settings.\n\n486\n00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:03.437\nAll right,\none of the things you'll notice is,\n\n487\n00:24:03.437 --> 00:24:06.460\nif we go to Apps,\nwe have Apps and Features, right?\n\n488\n00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:11.600\nApps and features, these tell me what\nfeatures are currently installed.\n\n489\n00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.649\nAnd if I want,\nI can manage Optional Features.\n\n490\n00:24:13.649 --> 00:24:17.386\nNow there's not a lot really to show\ntoo much in here, because it's a lot\n\n491\n00:24:17.386 --> 00:24:21.630\nabout fonts, character recognition,\nquick assist, you can see here, right?\n\n492\n00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:26.572\nAnd if I wanna add a feature, I can do\nthat like at the time of this recording,\n\n493\n00:24:26.572 --> 00:24:30.512\nyou'll see that they got it in\nbeta not fully supported yet,\n\n494\n00:24:30.512 --> 00:24:34.008\nWindows is gonna support\nan open SSH server, right?\n\n495\n00:24:34.008 --> 00:24:38.395\nThat hasn't been in Windows, if you wanted\nSSH you had to go to something like PuTTY\n\n496\n00:24:38.395 --> 00:24:40.475\nor move over to a Linux system, right?\n\n497\n00:24:40.475 --> 00:24:42.773\nBecause it is something you can install.\n\n498\n00:24:42.773 --> 00:24:46.309\nWell, I'm not gonna install this because\nI do wanna show you that there are other\n\n499\n00:24:46.309 --> 00:24:47.510\noptions that are here too.\n\n500\n00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:50.162\nAnd these other options by the way or\nfeatures, if you will,\n\n501\n00:24:50.162 --> 00:24:53.807\nare under Programs and Features, and\nthat's where they've been for a long time.\n\n502\n00:24:53.807 --> 00:24:57.616\nWell here, we've got this little jump\nlink, if you look at Related Settings.\n\n503\n00:24:57.616 --> 00:25:01.029\nAnd when I bring up Programs and\nFeatures underneath,\n\n504\n00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:03.487\nlooks like it's pop under not a pop up.\n\n505\n00:25:03.487 --> 00:25:03.987\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n506\n00:25:03.987 --> 00:25:06.628\n&gt;&gt; We have the traditional control panel,\n\n507\n00:25:06.628 --> 00:25:09.819\nand here's where we can\nturn features on or off.\n\n508\n00:25:09.819 --> 00:25:10.751\nSo you can see, and\n\n509\n00:25:10.751 --> 00:25:13.260\nI'm gonna get back to this.\nBecause I wanna show you,\n\n510\n00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:14.165\nit's not so buried,\n\n511\n00:25:14.165 --> 00:25:17.596\nin some of the earlier operating systems.\nAgain, newer interface, supporting two\n\n512\n00:25:17.596 --> 00:25:21.996\ninterfaces now on Windows 10.\nIt becomes a little bit clustered there.\n\n513\n00:25:21.996 --> 00:25:24.624\nBut if I right-click on our Windows tile,\n\n514\n00:25:24.624 --> 00:25:28.639\nyou'll notice that I have Programs and\nFeatures in Windows 8 and\n\n515\n00:25:28.639 --> 00:25:31.270\n8.1.\nAnd if I choose that, it's gonna bring me\n\n516\n00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:33.386\nright to that same interface, right?\nAnd\n\n517\n00:25:33.386 --> 00:25:37.321\nthen this is where I could turn those\nfeatures on or off, and it gives me\n\n518\n00:25:37.321 --> 00:25:41.073\nthe ability to look through here.\nNow, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go\n\n519\n00:25:41.073 --> 00:25:44.739\nahead, and I'll move back over, I just\nwanted to show you two different ways to\n\n520\n00:25:44.739 --> 00:25:47.334\nget to this.\nThis is the way you'd get to it in Windows\n\n521\n00:25:47.334 --> 00:25:50.025\n8.1.\nIf you go to the Control Panel,\n\n522\n00:25:50.025 --> 00:25:52.809\nthe same thing would be in Windows 7,\n\n523\n00:25:52.809 --> 00:25:56.132\nyou can still get there likewise too.\nAgain,\n\n524\n00:25:56.132 --> 00:26:01.000\njust choosing your Control Panel,\nChoosing Programs and then Programs and\n\n525\n00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.069\nFeatures, right?\nAnd then it takes me to the same interface\n\n526\n00:26:04.069 --> 00:26:05.376\nand we can move from there.\nSo\n\n527\n00:26:05.376 --> 00:26:07.470\na couple of different ways to get to this.\n\n528\n00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:11.470\nNow I will say, some of the features\nrequire your computer support it.\n\n529\n00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:14.665\nSo for instance,\nwe did enable Hyper-V in another episode,\n\n530\n00:26:14.665 --> 00:26:17.890\nbecause we had virtualization\nturned on in the processor, right?\n\n531\n00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:20.820\nVirtualization is disabled\non this machine, all right?\n\n532\n00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:23.540\nAnd because it's disabled, even though\nthat optional feature is there,\n\n533\n00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:26.447\nyou don't have the option to use it\nbecause your hardware doesn't support it.\n\n534\n00:26:26.447 --> 00:26:34.430\nSo do keep in mind that some of these\nrequire hardware level support.\n\n535\n00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:35.188\nI'll give you an example, right?\n\n536\n00:26:35.188 --> 00:26:37.781\nSo in demonstrations a lot I use and Dan,\n\n537\n00:26:37.781 --> 00:26:42.137\nI know you've done this in some\nof your security episodes, right?\n\n538\n00:26:42.137 --> 00:26:44.140\nWe show you why you\ndon't wanna use Telnet.\n\n539\n00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:47.835\nTelnet has some security risks that\nyou can learn in other episodes.\n\n540\n00:26:47.835 --> 00:26:51.299\nBut by default, I don't have Telnet\n\n541\n00:26:51.299 --> 00:26:55.893\nanywhere in my PowerShell or\nmy command prompt.\n\n542\n00:26:55.893 --> 00:26:58.418\nSorry, about that, let me go ahead and\njust this font here,\n\n543\n00:26:58.418 --> 00:27:00.558\nprobably should've done\nthat before we started.\n\n544\n00:27:00.558 --> 00:27:03.626\nBut let me go ahead and\nadjust that real quick.\n\n545\n00:27:03.626 --> 00:27:06.460\nAnd if you'll notice, I can type Telnet.\n\n546\n00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:11.360\nAnd notice it tells me Telnet is not\na recognized name of a cmdlet script\n\n547\n00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.630\nfunction or operable program, right?\n\n548\n00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:18.170\nWell that's because I don't have the\nTelnet Client feature turned on, right?\n\n549\n00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:19.308\nBut if I turn it on,\n\n550\n00:27:19.308 --> 00:27:23.597\nI choose OK, what it's gonna do is\nit's gonna look down into Windows.\n\n551\n00:27:23.597 --> 00:27:27.333\nAnd it's gonna look for those extra files\nfor those features that aren't installed,\n\n552\n00:27:27.333 --> 00:27:30.055\nand it's gonna go ahead and\ninstall and get them ready for use.\n\n553\n00:27:30.055 --> 00:27:32.724\nWell we'll go ahead and\nclose, and you remember Dan,\n\n554\n00:27:32.724 --> 00:27:35.755\nI showed you that I didn't have\nTelnet there before, right?\n\n555\n00:27:35.755 --> 00:27:39.360\nSo if I get back to our PowerShell here,\n\n556\n00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:43.812\nand We go ahead and we type Telnet now,\n\n557\n00:27:43.812 --> 00:27:47.736\nnotice that the Telnet client does\nopen up and it's ready to go, right?\n\n558\n00:27:47.736 --> 00:27:51.336\nSo I could type here, well,\nI could type open, and\n\n559\n00:27:51.336 --> 00:27:56.457\nI can potentially get back to my server,\nand I can make a Telnet connection.\n\n560\n00:27:56.457 --> 00:28:00.220\nNow keep in mind guys, we're just\nshowing you some optional features here.\n\n561\n00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:04.062\nYou'll learn in other security courses\nthat we have here at ITProTV why that's\n\n562\n00:28:04.062 --> 00:28:06.309\nprobably not something you wanna do,\nright?\n\n563\n00:28:06.309 --> 00:28:07.597\nBut that's for another time.\n\n564\n00:28:07.597 --> 00:28:12.421\nAll right, so Dan, we've kinda gone\nover the different application stuff.\n\n565\n00:28:12.421 --> 00:28:18.470\nI think one of the last things I wanna\ntalk about is application removal, right?\n\n566\n00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:21.420\nNetwork applications,\nhow do we remove them?\n\n567\n00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:22.065\nClose down your web browser.\n\n568\n00:28:22.065 --> 00:28:22.674\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's done.\n\n569\n00:28:22.674 --> 00:28:24.528\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's one of the great things\n\n570\n00:28:24.528 --> 00:28:27.627\nabout network applications, is again\nthe maintenance is a little bit easier.\n\n571\n00:28:27.627 --> 00:28:30.822\nThey're a little bit easier to maintain,\nhowever,\n\n572\n00:28:30.822 --> 00:28:35.660\none application type that I didn't mention\nwas the Windows Store Apps, right?\n\n573\n00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:36.837\nThey do mention the Windows Store,\n\n574\n00:28:36.837 --> 00:28:38.849\nyou might see it in Windows 10\ncalled the Microsoft Store.\n\n575\n00:28:38.849 --> 00:28:40.592\nI did forget about that one,\nlet me go ahead and\n\n576\n00:28:40.592 --> 00:28:42.167\nshow you guys a little bit about that one.\n\n577\n00:28:42.167 --> 00:28:44.879\nSo if I launch up the Windows Store.\n\n578\n00:28:44.879 --> 00:28:48.539\nKeep in mind that this does\nrequire a Microsoft account, and\n\n579\n00:28:48.539 --> 00:28:50.128\nyou do have to set this up.\n\n580\n00:28:50.128 --> 00:28:53.432\nBut I can go in here, and I can download\nthese applications just like you\n\n581\n00:28:53.432 --> 00:28:56.976\nhave a lot of app providers out there\nfrom the different operating systems.\n\n582\n00:28:56.976 --> 00:29:01.820\nAnd I could install these, and\nthese are local installations by the way.\n\n583\n00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:04.239\nSo let's make sure that\nwe are aware of that.\n\n584\n00:29:04.239 --> 00:29:08.714\nSo I could do network speedtest,\nI've already got that one built in.\n\n585\n00:29:08.714 --> 00:29:11.926\nHow bout we do speedtest, there we go.\n\n586\n00:29:11.926 --> 00:29:13.949\nOokla, all right?\n\n587\n00:29:13.949 --> 00:29:15.658\nAnd I could install.\n\n588\n00:29:15.658 --> 00:29:17.886\nNotice it told me that I already own this.\n\n589\n00:29:17.886 --> 00:29:21.627\nAnd that's one of the great things is once\nyou sign in with your Microsoft account,\n\n590\n00:29:21.627 --> 00:29:24.460\nand you download and\ninstall this application.\n\n591\n00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:25.037\nWell, guess what?\n\n592\n00:29:25.037 --> 00:29:28.480\nIf you uninstall it, it still remembers\nthat you purchased the application.\n\n593\n00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:32.705\nAnd you can just connect back to the\nMicrosoft Store or the Windows Store, and\n\n594\n00:29:32.705 --> 00:29:35.444\nyou can pull this application back down,\nright?\n\n595\n00:29:35.444 --> 00:29:39.119\nAnd the great thing is,\nthey're very easy to install, and\n\n596\n00:29:39.119 --> 00:29:41.260\nthey're very easy to uninstall.\n\n597\n00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:45.206\nAnother great thing about this is the fact\nthat it does allow you the ability to let\n\n598\n00:29:45.206 --> 00:29:47.195\nMicrosoft handle the updates, right?\n\n599\n00:29:47.195 --> 00:29:50.520\nBecause their developers and\nstuff are gonna handle all the updates.\n\n600\n00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:55.982\nBut now I have another application that\ncame out of the Windows Store here,\n\n601\n00:29:55.982 --> 00:29:58.073\nand we could do a speedtest.\n\n602\n00:29:58.073 --> 00:30:00.780\nAll right, now I'm gonna go ahead,\nand I'm just gonna say no,\n\n603\n00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.749\nbecause it's asking me for\nmy location data.\n\n604\n00:30:02.749 --> 00:30:07.160\nBut I now have an application\nrunning from the Windows Store.\n\n605\n00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:11.095\nApplication Removal, if you right-click\nWindows little tile there and\n\n606\n00:30:11.095 --> 00:30:12.752\nyou choose Apps and Features.\n\n607\n00:30:12.752 --> 00:30:15.280\nThis gives you the ability\nthat you can go through and\n\n608\n00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.070\nyou can find various applications.\n\n609\n00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:19.640\nLike I said if it happens to\nbe a network application,\n\n610\n00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.110\nyou just close the web browser.\n\n611\n00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:25.034\nBut if you want to remove\na locally installed application,\n\n612\n00:30:25.034 --> 00:30:28.180\njust come in here and\nyou can choose Uninstall.\n\n613\n00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:32.620\nSo you can do this from absent features,\nand we'll choose Yes.\n\n614\n00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:36.200\nIf you wanted to see this done\nfrom the classic interface,\n\n615\n00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:38.110\nwell we can do that as well too.\n\n616\n00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:41.178\nSo if we go back to Windows like 8.1 or\nWindows 7.\n\n617\n00:30:41.178 --> 00:30:46.220\nWe right-click on the Windows charm here\nand we choose Programs and Features.\n\n618\n00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:53.272\nYou can select any application that you\nwant and you can choose uninstall, right?\n\n619\n00:30:53.272 --> 00:30:57.039\nI'm not gonna uninstall this because\nthis is a part of the Visual C++,\n\n620\n00:30:57.039 --> 00:30:58.600\nit's something that I need.\n\n621\n00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:02.780\nBut then I can turn around and\nI can click, Yes here, and uninstall it.\n\n622\n00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:06.364\nAll right, so it looks like Microsoft\nBaseline Security Analyzer is gone,\n\n623\n00:31:06.364 --> 00:31:09.513\nhow about Windows Store applications,\nhow do we uninstall them?\n\n624\n00:31:09.513 --> 00:31:11.000\nWell let's show you.\n\n625\n00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.030\nWe go back to our Start menu, notice that\nI have a recently added speedtest here,\n\n626\n00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:16.510\nthat we just did live.\n\n627\n00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:20.472\nAnd if I right-click on it, you'll notice\nthat I can choose Uninstall here, right?\n\n628\n00:31:20.472 --> 00:31:23.970\nAnd when I choose Uninstall,\nit will do exactly that.\n\n629\n00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:24.730\nIt will take it out of the list.\n\n630\n00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:27.120\nWell first it's gonna\nconfirm this application,\n\n631\n00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.440\nits info will be uninstalled, right?\n\n632\n00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:32.108\nTakes it out of the list and\nthat is it, right?\n\n633\n00:31:32.108 --> 00:31:37.663\nFairly easy to uninstall applications\nprovided that you know where to look.\n\n634\n00:31:37.663 --> 00:31:39.566\nI did mention SmartScreen Filter,\n\n635\n00:31:39.566 --> 00:31:43.310\nand I want you to understand that\nSmartScreen Filter is something that\n\n636\n00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:45.860\nallows you to check that\nreputation database.\n\n637\n00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:50.580\nIf you're downloading an application from\nthe Internet, before it goes to install,\n\n638\n00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:53.710\nwhat it ends up doing is it\nends up checking Microsoft and\n\n639\n00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:56.400\nsaying hey,\ncan we verify this application?\n\n640\n00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.372\nDo we know this application?\n\n641\n00:31:57.372 --> 00:31:59.990\nAnd there are settings\nthat you can do here too.\n\n642\n00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:01.902\nSo let me go ahead and\nshow you real quick.\n\n643\n00:32:01.902 --> 00:32:06.676\nSo for instance,\nIf we in a Windows 10 machine you\n\n644\n00:32:06.676 --> 00:32:10.570\ncan also go to Application and Features.\n\n645\n00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:16.550\nAll right and let me go ahead and\ngo to the Windows settings\n\n646\n00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.980\nsearch and you can smart.\n\n647\n00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:25.210\nOne of the great things about this today\nis that the Windows Defender security\n\n648\n00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:29.320\ncenter has this built into it, all right.\n\n649\n00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:34.300\nAnd virus and protection, where did it go?\n\n650\n00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:35.390\nBuried in here somewhere.\n\n651\n00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:41.340\nThere we go, smart screen for Microsoft\nEdge, and Windows Store applications.\n\n652\n00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:43.890\nOkay, so one of the great things\nis it works with, like I said,\n\n653\n00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:47.000\nyour web browser as well\nas the local applications.\n\n654\n00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.180\nAnd it lets you know that it helps you\nprotect your device by checking web\n\n655\n00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:53.340\ncontent that the Windows store app uses.\n\n656\n00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:58.010\nAs well as protecting your device\nfrom malicious sites and downloads.\n\n657\n00:32:58.010 --> 00:33:01.220\nSo that's how you get to it\nin the Windows 10 editions.\n\n658\n00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:04.570\nYou can also get to this by, for instance,\nlet me go ahead and cancel this out.\n\n659\n00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:05.630\nIf you're on a Windows 7 or\n\n660\n00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:09.730\nWindows 8.1 device, you can get to\nthis in your web browser if you want.\n\n661\n00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:14.830\nSo for instance,\nif I go over to the little tool icon.\n\n662\n00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:20.950\nWhat we can do is we can go to safety,\nand then from safety,\n\n663\n00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:26.030\nif you scroll down, you will see, oops.\n\n664\n00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:28.440\nWhy do I not see the SmartScreen filter?\n\n665\n00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.170\n&gt;&gt; Wes, you gotta love when they\nhide stuff from you, don't you?\n\n666\n00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:32.690\nIt's always a grand scavenger hunt.\n\n667\n00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:34.000\nWhere's my SmartScreen filter?\n\n668\n00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.102\nI don't know.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, and\n\n669\n00:33:35.102 --> 00:33:38.470\nthe worst part about this is if this was\na rattlesnake, I'd have been bit, right?\n\n670\n00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:40.102\nLet me show what I mean, though.\n\n671\n00:33:40.102 --> 00:33:42.850\nI kinda moved the screen here though,\nbut I'm still in safety.\n\n672\n00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:44.750\nAnd if I would've looked down,\nsecond up from the bottom [LAUGH]-\n\n673\n00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:45.360\n&gt;&gt; Turn off SmartScreen.\n\n674\n00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.600\n&gt;&gt; Turn off smart screen filter.\n\n675\n00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:48.289\n&gt;&gt; Hey look, you were probably\ndoing the same thing I was doing.\n\n676\n00:33:48.289 --> 00:33:49.880\nI was looking for SmartScreen filter,\nnot turn off SmartScreen filter.\n\n677\n00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:52.143\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it, yeah that's it.\n\n678\n00:33:52.143 --> 00:33:55.006\n[LAUGH] So\nagain you can see this here too.\n\n679\n00:33:55.006 --> 00:33:58.999\nAnd again SmartScreen filter like it says,\ndesigned to warn you if a website you're\n\n680\n00:33:58.999 --> 00:34:02.949\nvisiting is impersonating another website\nor contains threats to your computer.\n\n681\n00:34:02.949 --> 00:34:04.460\nAnd that includes applications.\n\n682\n00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:07.170\nSo these are some of the things that you\nhave to know when it comes to configuring\n\n683\n00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:08.020\nyour applications.\n\n684\n00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:09.200\nBe aware of where they're running.\n\n685\n00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:14.030\nBe aware of local resources being\nused versus network applications that\n\n686\n00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:15.950\ncan run on other devices.\n\n687\n00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:19.220\nKnow a little about SmartScreen filter,\nthe start up types.\n\n688\n00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:22.930\nHow we manage those, as well as\nthings like in Windows features.\n\n689\n00:34:22.930 --> 00:34:25.230\nAnd you'll be doing well on your MTA exam.\n\n690\n00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:26.310\n&gt;&gt; Alright, great stuff Wes.\n\n691\n00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:27.860\nWe appreciate you hanging\nout with us today and\n\n692\n00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.280\ntalking about apps in\na Windows environment.\n\n693\n00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:33.510\nAnd how Windows actually works with\nthem and operates around them.\n\n694\n00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:34.750\nSo good stuff there.\n\n695\n00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:36.600\nHopefully you guys got a lot\nout of this episode, but\n\n696\n00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:37.880\nit does look like we are out of time.\n\n697\n00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:39.400\nSo we're going to have to call it a day.\n\n698\n00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.900\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n699\n00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:42.480\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n700\n00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.840\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n701\n00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:50.941\n[MUSIC]\n\n702\n00:34:50.941 -->

ITPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.816 --> 00:00:14.409\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTv.\n\n4\n00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:16.277\nHelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:16.277 --> 00:00:17.376\nI'm your host Zach Memos.\n\n6\n00:00:17.376 --> 00:00:20.645\nWith this episode of\nWindows OS fundamentals,\n\n7\n00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:24.005\nwe're gonna be configuring UAC and\nantivirus.\n\n8\n00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:26.320\nAnd who's gonna show us how to do that?\n\n9\n00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.522\nBen Vereen, yes we've invited, no,\nit's gonna be Wes Bryan, right over here.\n\n10\n00:00:30.522 --> 00:00:31.164\nWes, good to see you.\n\n11\n00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:32.969\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was expecting, it's like, wait,\n\n12\n00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.189\nwho do they have here today.\n\n13\n00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:37.142\nThat's right, it is me in the flesh.\n\n14\n00:00:37.142 --> 00:00:39.896\nThat's right, we are going to be looking,\nlike Zach said,\n\n15\n00:00:39.896 --> 00:00:42.709\nat configuring something known\nas the user account control.\n\n16\n00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.391\nOf course we always have to give acronyms.\n\n17\n00:00:44.391 --> 00:00:47.298\nAnd even more so,\nwe put them at the title now, too.\n\n18\n00:00:47.298 --> 00:00:48.747\nSo we've got acronyms galore.\n\n19\n00:00:48.747 --> 00:00:51.424\nWe're gonna talk about how to configure\nthe something known as the user\n\n20\n00:00:51.424 --> 00:00:52.145\naccount control.\n\n21\n00:00:52.145 --> 00:00:56.478\nLike Zach said, we commonly just call it\nthe UAC, as well as antivirus, right?\n\n22\n00:00:56.478 --> 00:01:00.140\nSo this is gonna be more of\na security-related episode,\n\n23\n00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.436\neven though it's not really\nbranded as security.\n\n24\n00:01:03.436 --> 00:01:05.316\nThose are a lot of the concepts\nthat we're gonna look at.\n\n25\n00:01:05.316 --> 00:01:07.616\nNow, I will tell you that there\nare a couple of things here.\n\n26\n00:01:07.616 --> 00:01:11.475\nWell, one thing that I can think of\nthat really isn't Security related that\n\n27\n00:01:11.475 --> 00:01:15.532\nactually falls under this category too and\nthat's known as service accounts.\n\n28\n00:01:15.532 --> 00:01:17.578\nSo we'll look at a little\nbit of service accounts too.\n\n29\n00:01:17.578 --> 00:01:18.624\nSo we'll mostly be,\n\n30\n00:01:18.624 --> 00:01:22.692\nI've heard pretty much 90% if you will\nit's gonna be all about some of the things\n\n31\n00:01:22.692 --> 00:01:26.252\nthat we can use inside of Windows to\nmake our systems a little bit secure.\n\n32\n00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:28.374\nA little bit more secure if you will,\n\n33\n00:01:28.374 --> 00:01:32.695\nas well as finishing it up with talking\na little bit about service account.\n\n34\n00:01:32.695 --> 00:01:35.490\n&gt;&gt; So Wes,\nwhen it comes to security architecture,\n\n35\n00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.826\nhas it always been the same or\nhas it changed over the years?\n\n36\n00:01:38.826 --> 00:01:39.882\nYeah Zach in fact,\n\n37\n00:01:39.882 --> 00:01:44.442\nthe security architecture that we follow\ntoday isn't what has always been used.\n\n38\n00:01:44.442 --> 00:01:47.916\nIn fact, this was introduced in Vista,\nand prior to Vista we had XP.\n\n39\n00:01:47.916 --> 00:01:51.032\nAnd one of the problems with creating\naccounts on XP machines is you would\n\n40\n00:01:51.032 --> 00:01:53.139\ninstall your operating system,\nlike we shown.\n\n41\n00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:56.872\nIts a basic process like we shown\ninstallations in the series here.\n\n42\n00:01:56.872 --> 00:01:59.840\nThe very first account that you\nwould configure would be what is\n\n43\n00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.637\nknown as the administrator account.\n\n44\n00:02:01.637 --> 00:02:05.803\nThe administrator account would have\nrights to really, really deep levels of\n\n45\n00:02:05.803 --> 00:02:09.096\nthe operating system, if you will,\nand security settings.\n\n46\n00:02:09.096 --> 00:02:13.828\nAnd the problem is Microsoft said, you\nknow what, we've collected all our data,\n\n47\n00:02:13.828 --> 00:02:18.222\nwe got our surveys and we realize that\neven though the majority of every single\n\n48\n00:02:18.222 --> 00:02:23.250\nuser had an administrative account, they\ndidn't need those level of privileges.\n\n49\n00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.590\nAll they really needed,\nto do the day to day functions,\n\n50\n00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.360\nis a lesser set of privileges.\n\n51\n00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.038\nI don't wanna say standard user because\nthat wasn't technically introduced yet.\n\n52\n00:02:35.038 --> 00:02:39.098\nSo when Vista come out, again\nMicrosoft collecting that information,\n\n53\n00:02:39.098 --> 00:02:41.769\nsays hey we need to have\na newer security model.\n\n54\n00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.896\nAnd that newer security\nmodel says you know what,\n\n55\n00:02:44.896 --> 00:02:49.077\nwe're going to run every single account,\nevery single account.\n\n56\n00:02:49.077 --> 00:02:53.395\nI don't care if you're an administrator or\na standard user,\n\n57\n00:02:53.395 --> 00:02:58.886\nyou are going to run as a standard user\nwith a lower privilege set, if you will.\n\n58\n00:02:58.886 --> 00:02:59.728\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n59\n00:02:59.728 --> 00:03:03.324\nSo today under what's known as\nthe standard user security architecture,\n\n60\n00:03:03.324 --> 00:03:05.505\nyou still have two\ndifferent types of views.\n\n61\n00:03:05.505 --> 00:03:09.170\nThere's actually a few different\nroles that these users can fall in.\n\n62\n00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.830\nBut largely speaking,\nthere's two different types of users.\n\n63\n00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.350\nYou have administrative users and\nyou have what are known as standard users.\n\n64\n00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:23.577\nAll right, and the standard users\nare basically their level of access.\n\n65\n00:03:23.577 --> 00:03:29.620\nIt gives them the ability to do their\nday to day tasks but nothing else.\n\n66\n00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.760\nCan't make those core changes\nto the operating system.\n\n67\n00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.800\nCan't change security settings.\n\n68\n00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.158\nWell, the Administrator.\n\n69\n00:03:37.158 --> 00:03:39.873\nWhen you have somebody that you say,\nyou know what,\n\n70\n00:03:39.873 --> 00:03:43.882\nI wanna make them administrator on this\nmachine so that they can administer,\n\n71\n00:03:43.882 --> 00:03:46.534\ninstall drivers,\ndo some kind of configuration,\n\n72\n00:03:46.534 --> 00:03:50.808\nwhen you create their account and they log\nin, what set of privileges do they get?\n\n73\n00:03:50.808 --> 00:03:54.672\nHere's where it's interesting, they also\nget standard user privileges, all right?\n\n74\n00:03:54.672 --> 00:03:57.498\nAnd there's a couple of different tokens.\n\n75\n00:03:57.498 --> 00:04:00.325\nWe'll come back to the administrative\ntoken, to the standard user token,\n\n76\n00:04:00.325 --> 00:04:02.369\nand what that means you're in the second,\nall right?\n\n77\n00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:07.244\nAnd when a standard user logs in, they\nhave a single standard user token, and\n\n78\n00:04:07.244 --> 00:04:11.660\nthat is applied to their machine,\nor applied to their account.\n\n79\n00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.860\nWhen an administrator logs in,\nthey actually get two different tokens.\n\n80\n00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.514\nThey get an administrative token and\nthey get a standard use token.\n\n81\n00:04:18.514 --> 00:04:21.421\nBut one of the things I want you to\nnotice is notice our administrator here.\n\n82\n00:04:21.421 --> 00:04:23.963\nEven though she's logged\ninto the computer,\n\n83\n00:04:23.963 --> 00:04:28.180\nI want you to notice that she runs\nin the context of a standard user.\n\n84\n00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.600\nAnd this is so that her privileges aren't\nelevated in the background unbeknownst to\n\n85\n00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.260\nher and she installs a piece\nof software that's malware and\n\n86\n00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.310\nnow has Administrative level access\nto the operating system, right?\n\n87\n00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.400\nWhat they're doing here is they're\nimplementing the principle of\n\n88\n00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.310\nleast privilege.\n\n89\n00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.573\nThat is what the standard\nuser security model says.\n\n90\n00:04:47.573 --> 00:04:49.897\nIt says,\nif you don't need those privileges,\n\n91\n00:04:49.897 --> 00:04:51.650\nwe're gonna remove them from you.\n\n92\n00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.851\nThere's no reason to have them, and\n\n93\n00:04:53.851 --> 00:04:57.980\nhave that level of access if you\ndon't need it right now, all right.\n\n94\n00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.016\nSo even administrators, they run\nin the context of a standard user.\n\n95\n00:05:02.016 --> 00:05:05.074\nAnd we'll come back and see cuz it\nis a little bit different when it\n\n96\n00:05:05.074 --> 00:05:08.060\nan administrator tries to\nmake configuration changes.\n\n97\n00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.140\nI want to define the tokens now.\n\n98\n00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.370\nAnd when we look at these tokens,\njust understand that basically what\n\n99\n00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.100\nthey do is they have the privileges for\nthe administrator group right?\n\n100\n00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.980\nThe administrator group has that\nspecial level of access right?\n\n101\n00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.054\nStandard users,\n\n102\n00:05:22.054 --> 00:05:26.635\nall of those privileges are removed from\nthat token which means that when you\n\n103\n00:05:26.635 --> 00:05:31.073\ngo to execute something that does make\nchanges to your operating system,\n\n104\n00:05:31.073 --> 00:05:36.175\nit's gonna evaluate the token and it's\ngonna say well, are you an administrator.\n\n105\n00:05:36.175 --> 00:05:39.632\nWell let's challenge you and\nlet me show you what I mean here.\n\n106\n00:05:39.632 --> 00:05:44.034\nAll right, so our administrator,\nshe's logged into the machine.\n\n107\n00:05:44.034 --> 00:05:46.637\nShe's got two tokens that\nare applied to her account, however,\n\n108\n00:05:46.637 --> 00:05:50.012\nwe're going to just take and we're going\nto kinda shelf the administrative token.\n\n109\n00:05:50.012 --> 00:05:53.120\nSo she's running as a standard user,\nprinciple of least privilege.\n\n110\n00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.662\nShe doesn't need that level of access\nbecause she's working with Outlook right\n\n111\n00:05:56.662 --> 00:05:58.546\nnow, she's working with Word right now.\n\n112\n00:05:58.546 --> 00:06:01.598\nAn Excel spreadsheet, whatever,\n\n113\n00:06:01.598 --> 00:06:06.810\nmaybe doing IP entry like\nmapping the network, right?\n\n114\n00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.060\nNone of that involves any\nspecial level of access.\n\n115\n00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.428\nHowever, she decides that,\nyou know what, I'm gonna launch and\n\n116\n00:06:14.428 --> 00:06:17.314\nI think my arrow is going\nthe wrong way here,\n\n117\n00:06:17.314 --> 00:06:21.843\nI'm going to launch something like\nthe Registry Editor if you will.\n\n118\n00:06:21.843 --> 00:06:25.778\nWell, when she launches the Registry\nEditor, what ends up happening?\n\n119\n00:06:25.778 --> 00:06:31.764\nAll right, well that is a program that the\nsecurity sub system is gonna analyze and\n\n120\n00:06:31.764 --> 00:06:34.387\nit's gonna say well wait a second.\n\n121\n00:06:34.387 --> 00:06:39.131\nThat registry editor right,\nregedit, that can make some pretty\n\n122\n00:06:39.131 --> 00:06:43.454\nsubstantial changes to\nthe operating system, all right?\n\n123\n00:06:43.454 --> 00:06:48.379\nSo rather than that happen, what ends\nup happening is when that standard\n\n124\n00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:51.458\nuser token is applied,\nstep three comes in.\n\n125\n00:06:51.458 --> 00:06:55.352\nAnd this is where a little thing called\nthe user account control that's part of\n\n126\n00:06:55.352 --> 00:06:58.956\nimplementing the standard security or\nstandard user security model and\n\n127\n00:06:58.956 --> 00:07:02.043\nbasically implementing\nthe principle of least privileges.\n\n128\n00:07:02.043 --> 00:07:05.056\nHold on a second, hold on.\n\n129\n00:07:05.056 --> 00:07:09.452\nYou just went to run that there Adam and\nyou say you're an administrator, okay but\n\n130\n00:07:09.452 --> 00:07:12.844\nI'm looking at your token and\nit says you're a standard user.\n\n131\n00:07:12.844 --> 00:07:14.438\nDid you launch this?\n\n132\n00:07:14.438 --> 00:07:20.036\nAll right and then that's when we have\nto have an administrative approval.\n\n133\n00:07:20.036 --> 00:07:20.887\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n134\n00:07:20.887 --> 00:07:23.879\n&gt;&gt; Now you get a little dialogue box and\nI'll show you this coming up.\n\n135\n00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:27.406\nYou get a little dialogue box that\ncomes up and says did you do this?\n\n136\n00:07:27.406 --> 00:07:29.880\nIf you did, just push Enter to continue.\n\n137\n00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.103\nOr if it happens to be a standard\nuser that's logged and they're not\n\n138\n00:07:34.103 --> 00:07:39.151\nan administrator, the UAC or the User\nAccount Control will trigger same thing.\n\n139\n00:07:39.151 --> 00:07:42.058\nSay wait a second, I see that\nyou got a standard user account.\n\n140\n00:07:42.058 --> 00:07:44.135\nYou're gonna need an administrative token.\n\n141\n00:07:44.135 --> 00:07:47.652\nPut in the password for an administrative\naccount so that you can run this.\n\n142\n00:07:47.652 --> 00:07:52.082\nAnd if you don't put in\nan administrative account credentials,\n\n143\n00:07:52.082 --> 00:07:57.960\nthe user account control blocks that\napplication from being executed at all.\n\n144\n00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.070\nRight?\nThat's what the UAC does for us, right?\n\n145\n00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.480\nThe user account control if you will.\n\n146\n00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.340\nSo these are a couple of things\nthat you have to know, right?\n\n147\n00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.100\nThe standard versus\nan administrative user.\n\n148\n00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.250\nI will tell you, keep this in mind.\n\n149\n00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.100\nWhen you install or\nwhen you create that first user,\n\n150\n00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.730\nyou install your operating system and\nyou create that first user today.\n\n151\n00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.950\nIt's still the administrator, all right?\n\n152\n00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:23.750\nBut the difference is, it isn't\nthe default administrator of yesteryears.\n\n153\n00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:28.700\nIt means that yes you're an administrator\nbut you're gonna run as a standard user.\n\n154\n00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.880\nAnd when you need those privileges,\n\n155\n00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.870\nthat's where the user account\ncontrol is gonna come in.\n\n156\n00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.700\n&gt;&gt; And\ncan we look at the UAC more in depth?\n\n157\n00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.660\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so let's go ahead, and\nwe'll dive into this from a couple\n\n158\n00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:42.640\ndifferent locations because we\nreally want you to know Windows 10.\n\n159\n00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.106\nThat's one of the things that\nis updated in the MTA exam.\n\n160\n00:08:45.106 --> 00:08:47.953\nBut I also want you to see some of,\nfor instance,\n\n161\n00:08:47.953 --> 00:08:50.397\nwhat does it look like on Windows 8.1?\n\n162\n00:08:50.397 --> 00:08:53.610\nSo I'm gonna start on Windows 8.1 and\nthen we'll move over to Windows 10.\n\n163\n00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:56.040\nAnd we're gonna get to our control panel,\nall right?\n\n164\n00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.146\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna right click.\n\n165\n00:08:58.146 --> 00:08:59.600\nAnd it looks like I'm not logged in.\n\n166\n00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.775\nWindows was fooling me.\n\n167\n00:09:00.775 --> 00:09:02.280\nGonna get logged back in.\n\n168\n00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.000\nAll right.\n\n169\n00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.600\nAnd I'm logged in as Zach, all right?\n\n170\n00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.090\nNow if you remember,\npicking on Zach in a couple episodes ago.\n\n171\n00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.130\nAnd I created Zach's account here for\n\n172\n00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.480\nwhatever our episode we\nwere doing at that time.\n\n173\n00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.890\nBut I made Zach a standard user,\nall right?\n\n174\n00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:16.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm just a standard user.\n\n175\n00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:19.180\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so we're gonna right-click\non our Windows charm here.\n\n176\n00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.300\nAnd let me switch this\nback to Category View,\n\n177\n00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.280\nbecause there's some interesting\ninformation that we'll see here.\n\n178\n00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.150\nAll right.\n\n179\n00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:29.730\nNotice that when I look through here,\nfor instance let's go to Appearance and\n\n180\n00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:31.700\nPersonalization, all right?\n\n181\n00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.040\nNow one of the things that\nyou might notice here is\n\n182\n00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.450\nI don't have any of these little shields.\n\n183\n00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:39.800\nAnd you might say well wait a second Wes,\nwhat do you mean shields?\n\n184\n00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:44.280\nLet's go back to the category view and\nI want you to look under User Accounts.\n\n185\n00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.050\nDo you see that little\nshield right there Zach?\n\n186\n00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:46.890\n&gt;&gt; Yes, sir.\n\n187\n00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:49.410\n&gt;&gt; All right, that's what's\nknown as a user account shield.\n\n188\n00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:51.091\nAnd it lets me know, all right?\n\n189\n00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:55.440\nSo this is the first sign that we've\ngot the user account in our systems.\n\n190\n00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.080\nThat lets me know that if I wanna\nchange somebody's account type\n\n191\n00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.580\nbecause of that shield if\nhave to be an administrator.\n\n192\n00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.100\nThat's administrative level privilege.\n\n193\n00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.190\nI'm configuring another account.\n\n194\n00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:08.720\nIt makes a change to somebody\nother account within the system.\n\n195\n00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.950\nI have to be an administrator to do that.\n\n196\n00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:14.790\nBut if you'll notice,\nI go to Appearance and Personalization.\n\n197\n00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:18.020\nAnd Zach,\ndo you see how we're lacking shields man.\n\n198\n00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; There isn't a single shield anywhere in\n\n199\n00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:21.990\nthe list here, all right?\n\n200\n00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.260\nWhy is that?\n\n201\n00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.200\nWell, in Appearance and Personalization\n\n202\n00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:31.410\nwhat Zach would be doing is let's say\nhe's changing his theme, all right?\n\n203\n00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:34.790\nAnd he does that, you should see\na change here in the background here and\n\n204\n00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:35.540\nwe'll zoom out.\n\n205\n00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:40.290\nSo I changed, playing the role of\nZach here, Zach changes his theme.\n\n206\n00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:42.280\nNotice we got a nice new theme here.\n\n207\n00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.640\n&gt;&gt; Why didn't it require\nadministrative level privileges?\n\n208\n00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.207\nHe isn't making a change to my account.\n\n209\n00:10:49.207 --> 00:10:52.223\nHe isn't making a change to, say,\nthe Windows Firewall, a security change.\n\n210\n00:10:52.223 --> 00:10:53.160\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n211\n00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.190\n&gt;&gt; He isn't turning a service off, right?\n\n212\n00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.370\nA configuration of the operating system.\n\n213\n00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:01.950\nHe is only configuring a setting\nthat reflects his user profile.\n\n214\n00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:03.880\nIn other episodes we talked\nabout the user profile and\n\n215\n00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.620\nall of those settings being stored.\n\n216\n00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:09.740\nIn this case in Zach's profile\ndown here in the operating system.\n\n217\n00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:14.040\nIf I open up File Explorer\nwe go Local Disk (C:),\n\n218\n00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.640\nUsers and here is Zach's folder, right?\n\n219\n00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.530\nAll he's doing is making\nconfigurations to his user profile.\n\n220\n00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:26.140\nHe isn't touching Dan's profile,\nthe administrator profile.\n\n221\n00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:29.210\nSo since it's a user configuration\nof just this account,\n\n222\n00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.270\nit doesn't require\nadministrative level privileges.\n\n223\n00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:34.710\nHowever, all right?\n\n224\n00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:35.903\nThat's where the fun stops.\n\n225\n00:11:35.903 --> 00:11:37.190\nSorry Zach, all you can do is\nmodify your account, right?\n\n226\n00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:41.292\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because if we get in,\n\n227\n00:11:41.292 --> 00:11:45.400\nlet's take an, let's show another example.\n\n228\n00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.710\nLet's get into System and Security, right?\n\n229\n00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:48.750\nNow when we get into System and\n\n230\n00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:52.500\nSecurity you start seeing a whole\nbunch of other things going on, right?\n\n231\n00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.100\nIn fact, changing\nthe User Account Control settings.\n\n232\n00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Let's go ahead and do that.\n\n233\n00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.380\nAll right, this is maybe the first time,\nmaybe you've seen this before,\n\n234\n00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.760\nmaybe you haven't.\n\n235\n00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:07.120\nWe say UAC,\nUser Account Control, all right?\n\n236\n00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.630\nNow what it's saying is it's saying,\nhey, you know what?\n\n237\n00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:14.840\nI see that this piece of software\nis trying to run right now.\n\n238\n00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.950\nAnd I'm looking at your token Zach.\n\n239\n00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:21.850\nYou don't have an administrative token,\nall right?\n\n240\n00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:24.090\nIn fact, you're a standard user.\n\n241\n00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:28.060\nSo Zach can't just say yes\nto continue the operation.\n\n242\n00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:29.540\nI'll change it around a little bit, and\n\n243\n00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:33.398\nshow you one where you might be,\nyou can see something like that, right?\n\n244\n00:12:33.398 --> 00:12:37.740\nSo, what Zach would have to do in order\nto elevate his privileges is he would\n\n245\n00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:42.385\nhave to type in an account of\n\n246\n00:12:42.385 --> 00:12:46.880\n[COUGH]\nsome user\n\n247\n00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.220\nthat has an administrative token.\n\n248\n00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.480\nAnd in fact this, what I'm gonna do is\njust use our default administrator for\n\n249\n00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.328\nthe entire domain, right?\n\n250\n00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:58.195\nAnd if I do that, I choose yes,\nnow we can see the User Account Control.\n\n251\n00:12:58.195 --> 00:12:59.520\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n252\n00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.806\n&gt;&gt; Why is that?\n\n253\n00:13:00.806 --> 00:13:05.830\nBecause what happened is now the User\nAccount Control looked at that user,\n\n254\n00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:07.820\nthe administrator for the domain, and\n\n255\n00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:10.380\nsaid, hey do you have\nan administrator token?\n\n256\n00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:13.320\nSomebody just used your credentials,\nokay you do have a token.\n\n257\n00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.400\nThis is a good account.\n\n258\n00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.470\nLet me go ahead and\n\n259\n00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:20.330\nI will execute this application in the\ncontext of your administrative account.\n\n260\n00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.800\nFollow me there, does that make sense?\n\n261\n00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.240\nAnd that's what's happening.\n\n262\n00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.520\nNow, unbeknownst to Zach,\n\n263\n00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.620\nthis is also implementing not only\nthe principle of least privilege.\n\n264\n00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:33.190\nThe UAC here implements\nthe principle of least privilege and\n\n265\n00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:37.370\nlet me go ahead and\nI will log in one more time.\n\n266\n00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:40.130\nAll right, it implements\nthe principle of least privilege.\n\n267\n00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:44.720\nAnd it also implements something\nknown as privilege bracketing, too,\n\n268\n00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.910\nwhich is an interesting concept,\ntoo, all right.\n\n269\n00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.860\nSo what is principle of least privilege?\n\n270\n00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:53.100\nWe've kind of said it before, I give Zach\nexactly what he needs to do his job,\n\n271\n00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.240\nprivilege wise, no more, no less.\n\n272\n00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.170\nNo less, because then he couldn't do his\njob and he can't be productive, right?\n\n273\n00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.650\nSo he has to have at least\nthe privileges that he requires,\n\n274\n00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:04.140\nwhatever his role is within the company.\n\n275\n00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:04.830\nAll right?\n\n276\n00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:05.830\nBut no more, right?\n\n277\n00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:08.330\nDon't give him too much privilege, right?\n\n278\n00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.250\nHowever, what is privilege bracketing?\n\n279\n00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:12.310\nAll right, now, privilege bracketing\nis a little different, right?\n\n280\n00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:15.120\nYou notice that we elevated\nthe privileges, because we put in\n\n281\n00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:20.050\na user accounts credentials that\nis an administrative account.\n\n282\n00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:24.290\nWatch what happens when\nwe close the UAC down.\n\n283\n00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:27.390\nOkay, so we've closed the user account\ncontrol interface down completely,\n\n284\n00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:30.130\nand we're going to launch it back up.\n\n285\n00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:32.620\nWell, didn't Zach just put credentials in?\n\n286\n00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:33.475\nAnd again, thank you, Zach.\n\n287\n00:14:33.475 --> 00:14:34.735\nI'm playing the role here of Zach.\n\n288\n00:14:34.735 --> 00:14:36.185\nDidn't Zach just put in credentials?\n\n289\n00:14:36.185 --> 00:14:39.405\nWhy is it asking him for\nthose credentials again?\n\n290\n00:14:39.405 --> 00:14:43.153\nSee, privileged bracketing is really\nthe same concept of principle of least\n\n291\n00:14:43.153 --> 00:14:43.795\nprivilege.\n\n292\n00:14:43.795 --> 00:14:44.985\nThey're very close, right?\n\n293\n00:14:44.985 --> 00:14:47.655\nIt says, I give you what you need to do,\nno more, no less.\n\n294\n00:14:47.655 --> 00:14:53.820\nBut, when I give those level of\nprivileges you need to get that job done.\n\n295\n00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.520\nIn this case, it was just viewing\nthe user account control.\n\n296\n00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:00.240\nYou close it down, that job's done,\nI remove those privileges from you.\n\n297\n00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.410\nThat's privilege bracketing.\n\n298\n00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:03.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is.\n&gt;&gt; It says I still give you what you need\n\n299\n00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:05.830\nto do your job, and\nI'll elevate those privileges.\n\n300\n00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:08.022\nShould you have an administrative account.\n\n301\n00:15:08.022 --> 00:15:12.055\nBut once that privilege is no longer\nneeded, there is no reason to keep it or\n\n302\n00:15:12.055 --> 00:15:13.153\nremove it, right?\n\n303\n00:15:13.153 --> 00:15:13.706\nThat's bracketing.\n\n304\n00:15:13.706 --> 00:15:15.890\nWe remove it from you, right?\n\n305\n00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.870\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna say no to this, all right?\n\n306\n00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:24.600\nBecause what I'd like to do here, is go\nahead and we are going to log out of Zach.\n\n307\n00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.010\nThank you Zach for\ntaking one for the team there.\n\n308\n00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:27.716\n&gt;&gt; That's a good thing.\n\n309\n00:15:27.716 --> 00:15:29.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right,\nand we'll go ahead and\n\n310\n00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:32.980\nlog out and what I'm gonna do this time,\nI'm gonna choose other user.\n\n311\n00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:34.730\nOkay so let's go ahead and do that.\n\n312\n00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:38.250\nWe'll log in, again,\nprovided I can remember the password.\n\n313\n00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:39.730\nWe'll log in as our administrator and\n\n314\n00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:43.460\nlet's see what the user account\ncontrol looks like this time.\n\n315\n00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:47.260\nWhen we go to launch something that\nrequires administrative level privileges.\n\n316\n00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.810\nSo what I'm gonna do here\nis I'm actually gonna,\n\n317\n00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:50.350\nI'm gonna make this\na little easier on myself.\n\n318\n00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:51.208\nI'm gonna kinda cheat here.\n\n319\n00:15:51.208 --> 00:15:55.930\nI'm gonna right-click on the Windows charm\nand I'm gonna choose Command Prompt here.\n\n320\n00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:57.420\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And we'll run our Command Prompt.\n\n321\n00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.830\nAnd notice that it said Admin,\nso it's letting me know that.\n\n322\n00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:02.710\nYou are running this in\nthe context of an administrator.\n\n323\n00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:04.410\nNow notice here what's happening, right?\n\n324\n00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:07.276\nIf I show the details here,\nwe can see where it's running from so\n\n325\n00:16:07.276 --> 00:16:10.660\nwe can identify the location that\nthis application is running.\n\n326\n00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.856\nBut notice it's a little different,\nZach, right?\n\n327\n00:16:12.856 --> 00:16:14.418\n&gt;&gt; It is, yes.\n&gt;&gt; It didn't do the same thing for\n\n328\n00:16:14.418 --> 00:16:15.220\nyou, right?\n\n329\n00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:20.180\nFor me, or at least this user account,\nadmin, that we're logged in as, it\n\n330\n00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:25.210\nis only prompting them to acknowledge that\nit was you who launched this application.\n\n331\n00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:27.860\nYou just have to say yes to continue,\nright?\n\n332\n00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:30.800\nI didn't have to put credentials in,\nright?\n\n333\n00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.630\nSo there's a little bit of\na different behavior when it comes to\n\n334\n00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:39.910\nthe way a standard user will\nsee the user account control.\n\n335\n00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:43.560\nIf an application is triggered\nversus an administrator.\n\n336\n00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.507\nNow while we're in the context\nof an administrator.\n\n337\n00:16:45.507 --> 00:16:49.961\nSo I don't have to keep logging in and\nout of an administrative account,\n\n338\n00:16:49.961 --> 00:16:52.600\nwe'll go ahead and\nlook at more of the UAC.\n\n339\n00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:56.210\nSo, that's some of the things that\ncan help you to identify the UAC.\n\n340\n00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:58.180\nZach, you asked a specific\nquestion though.\n\n341\n00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:00.980\nYou said, hey, can we actually see\na little bit more about the UAC?\n\n342\n00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:05.180\nAnd I kinda brought it up just for\na second here and then closed it down.\n\n343\n00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:09.120\nSo if you open up your control panel,\nyou go into User Accounts.\n\n344\n00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:14.070\nNow pay attention to this one because\nit doesn't seem like it should be here.\n\n345\n00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:16.180\nGo into User Account again.\n\n346\n00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.950\nSo now you're in User Accounts,\nUser Accounts, right?\n\n347\n00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:20.306\nWell that's redundancy.\n\n348\n00:17:20.306 --> 00:17:24.325\nA door in front of a door leads to\na door that leads to a locked door.\n\n349\n00:17:24.325 --> 00:17:28.280\nAnd then we have change User Account\ncontrol settings right here, all right?\n\n350\n00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.710\nAnd when we choose this, again,\nnotice the user account control.\n\n351\n00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:32.990\nRemember what we said.\n\n352\n00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:36.060\nWhen Zack tried to do this,\nthere was a little shield.\n\n353\n00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:38.930\nSo it's saying wait a second,\nyou're an administrator.\n\n354\n00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:43.090\nYou have to go ahead and\nacknowledge the prompt here.\n\n355\n00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:46.110\nAll right, now I want to talk\nbriefly about these settings.\n\n356\n00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:48.530\nWe'll probably have to come back for\na part two in some of this, but\n\n357\n00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:51.260\nwe want to at least go ahead and\naddress the UAC here.\n\n358\n00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what is that slider Wes?\n\n359\n00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:53.800\n&gt;&gt; That's interesting.\n\n360\n00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:59.475\nThat is actually, makes it very,\nvery easy to configure the levels, right?\n\n361\n00:17:59.475 --> 00:18:02.624\nHow intrusive do we want the UAC,\nthe User Account Control,\n\n362\n00:18:02.624 --> 00:18:04.770\nhow do we want it to interact?\n\n363\n00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.380\nSo, let's move that slider, Zach, and\n\n364\n00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.070\nlet's talk about some of\nthese different levels.\n\n365\n00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:09.860\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n366\n00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:13.100\nthis very first one is actually the\ndefault, you might notice that I had mine\n\n367\n00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:16.430\non always notify,\nI set it to the most secure setting.\n\n368\n00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:19.040\nSee, the User Account Control\ndoesn't bother me\n\n369\n00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:22.470\nbecause what the User Account Control\ndoes is it protects your system.\n\n370\n00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:24.590\nNow it might notify you,\nit might tell you, hey,\n\n371\n00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:27.510\nyou gotta say yes to this\nlike I've had to do, right?\n\n372\n00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.710\nOr you might have to put\nin user credentials.\n\n373\n00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:31.830\nIt's there for a reason,\nit keeps your computer secure.\n\n374\n00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:36.040\nSome people think it's a little too\nintrusive so they disable it or\n\n375\n00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:40.489\nthey reduce it's level of interactions\nright, how intrusive it is.\n\n376\n00:18:40.489 --> 00:18:45.995\nAnd unfortunately their computers are just\nthat much more to be compromised.\n\n377\n00:18:45.995 --> 00:18:47.363\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n378\n00:18:47.363 --> 00:18:49.487\nthe default is right here.\n\n379\n00:18:49.487 --> 00:18:52.105\nAll right, notify me when the computer and\nlet's kind of zoom in here.\n\n380\n00:18:52.105 --> 00:18:58.265\nNotify me only when applications\ntry to make changes to my computer.\n\n381\n00:18:58.265 --> 00:19:03.510\nDon't notify me when I make\nchanges to Windows settings.\n\n382\n00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:08.800\nNow this is the way it was\nreleased In Windows 7.\n\n383\n00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:13.232\nIn Windows Vista when it first came out,\nit was more like this setting right here.\n\n384\n00:19:13.232 --> 00:19:15.896\nIt was very intrusive.\n\n385\n00:19:15.896 --> 00:19:17.181\nWhat I mean by intrusive is,\n\n386\n00:19:17.181 --> 00:19:20.460\nevery little thing that you did would\ntrigger the user account control.\n\n387\n00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.160\nAnd that's why people didn't like it\nbecause they were coming from the days of\n\n388\n00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.740\nXP when you didn't have this.\n\n389\n00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:27.030\nThe administrator could log in,\nthey could do whatever they wanted.\n\n390\n00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:28.160\nThey wouldn't be interrupted.\n\n391\n00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.800\nThey wouldn't have to say yes to continue.\n\n392\n00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.120\nYou wouldn't have to put in credentials.\n\n393\n00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.700\nAnd people just hated it.\n\n394\n00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:36.710\nAll right, so\nin Windows 7 they redid the architecture.\n\n395\n00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:39.020\nAnd that's why I say things\nhave changed over the years.\n\n396\n00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.260\nThe UAC is still pretty much\nthe same user account control.\n\n397\n00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:45.410\nBut what happened in Windows 7 is they\nsaid, they took all the feedback.\n\n398\n00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:50.080\nPeople were saying, hey, don't make\nthe user account control so intrusive.\n\n399\n00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:53.020\nSo what they said, It's okay,\nwell, we're gonna drop it.\n\n400\n00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:56.710\nWe're gonna drop it down to not\nalways notifying me, right?\n\n401\n00:19:56.710 --> 00:20:00.200\nIf you always notify me, apps try to\ninstall software make changes to my\n\n402\n00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:05.670\ncomputer or I make changes to Windows\nsettings, it's gonna flag the UAC.\n\n403\n00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:11.700\nBut here it says, just notify me when apps\ntry to make changes to my computer, right?\n\n404\n00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.660\nDon't notify me when I\nmake changes to Windows.\n\n405\n00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:17.880\nAnd that's what it's been ever since,\nthat's the default, right?\n\n406\n00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.115\nHowever, there's a third option here and\na fourth.\n\n407\n00:20:20.115 --> 00:20:23.595\nThe fourth, we'll just all the way down to\nthe bottom, just says turn it off, right?\n\n408\n00:20:23.595 --> 00:20:27.031\nTurn off the UAC,\ndefinitely not recommended, all right?\n\n409\n00:20:27.031 --> 00:20:32.665\nWell I will tell you this one looks\nlike it is almost identical, all right?\n\n410\n00:20:32.665 --> 00:20:34.385\nNow look at the parenthesis\nstatement there,\n\n411\n00:20:34.385 --> 00:20:38.105\nthat's really the only thing\nthat's changing, right?\n\n412\n00:20:38.105 --> 00:20:41.990\nOne says default which is obvious,\nit's the default like I said\n\n413\n00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:45.790\nwhen we change this here,\nnotice it says don't dim my desktop?\n\n414\n00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:47.070\nWell what does that mean.\n\n415\n00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:49.520\nWell let me go ahead and\nI'm gonna close the UAC down here so\n\n416\n00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.070\nwe can trigger it one more time.\n\n417\n00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:53.200\nHopefully it'll trigger it, there we go.\n\n418\n00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.980\nZach, do you see how the how\nthe rest of this desktop is dark?\n\n419\n00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:56.655\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n420\n00:20:56.655 --> 00:20:58.695\n&gt;&gt; Right, and in that setting, right?\n\n421\n00:20:58.695 --> 00:21:00.225\nIt said don't dim my desktop.\n\n422\n00:21:00.225 --> 00:21:02.175\nWell, what is this about?\n\n423\n00:21:02.175 --> 00:21:04.905\nThat's something known as secure desktop,\nit's part of the UAC.\n\n424\n00:21:04.905 --> 00:21:07.120\nIt's part of the user account\ncontrol features, right?\n\n425\n00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.310\nIt almost does an instant safe mode and\n\n426\n00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:13.680\nwe'll talk about safe mode in our\nrecovery episodes to your computer.\n\n427\n00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.450\nIt locks your computer down,\nit protects your registry and\n\n428\n00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:19.670\nit says nothing is gonna happen\nuntil you interact with me.\n\n429\n00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:24.980\nYou have to tell me that you did this, you\nhave to confirm it by saying yes or no.\n\n430\n00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:29.670\nWhen you say yes, okay, desktop's\nno longer down, application can run\n\n431\n00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:35.520\nIf you turn that, don't dim my desktop.\n\n432\n00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.720\nAnd again, it doesn't really say this\nhere, so hopefully this will help out.\n\n433\n00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.430\nWhat you're essentially doing\nis disabling Secure Desktop.\n\n434\n00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:46.482\nWhich means as a pop-up, what happens\nwhat happens if I'm a hacker and\n\n435\n00:21:46.482 --> 00:21:49.524\nI put a pop-up generator on your machine?\n\n436\n00:21:49.524 --> 00:21:52.824\nAnd it generates something that looks\njust like the user account control, but\n\n437\n00:21:52.824 --> 00:21:53.980\nit's a keystroke logger.\n\n438\n00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.516\nAnd as you type in your user name and\npassword to authenticate again to it.\n\n439\n00:21:57.516 --> 00:22:00.362\nIt sends a communication\nout to an outbound server.\n\n440\n00:22:00.362 --> 00:22:01.818\nAnd now they got your user name and\n\n441\n00:22:01.818 --> 00:22:04.390\npassword, making log in into your machine,\nright?\n\n442\n00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:07.870\nNow that's the tinfoil\nhat far extreme method.\n\n443\n00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:12.610\nBut it will happen because\napplications can continue to run\n\n444\n00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:14.460\nwhen you don't dim the desktop.\n\n445\n00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:18.890\nIt's not very secure that's why it says,\ndo not recommend.\n\n446\n00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:20.650\nIt's not recommended, do not do this.\n\n447\n00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:21.890\nIt's not recommended, right?\n\n448\n00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:24.530\nThe only time they say is\nif it takes a long time dim\n\n449\n00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:27.000\nthe desktop on your computer.\n\n450\n00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.740\nHowever, I would not do this, you\nare crippling the User Account Control.\n\n451\n00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:36.830\nAnd then, like I said, the last\nslider is gonna be just disabling it.\n\n452\n00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:38.680\nSo that's a little bit\nour User Account Control.\n\n453\n00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.690\nAnd remember, it is one of the security\nfeatures that are inside of your\n\n454\n00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:42.480\noperating system.\n\n455\n00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:46.580\nOne of the last things I wanna mention,\nbecause I don't know if they are going to\n\n456\n00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:51.320\ngo this in-depth in an MTA exam\ncuz it's kinda introductory.\n\n457\n00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.496\nBut let me go ahead and show you\nanother place you can manipulate or\n\n458\n00:22:54.496 --> 00:22:57.480\nconfigure, if you will,\nthe user account control.\n\n459\n00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:02.775\nIf I get to the start screen here and\nI type in\n\n460\n00:23:02.775 --> 00:23:07.510\ngpedit.msc.\n\n461\n00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:10.870\nIt will launch, again here's\nthe user account control triggering.\n\n462\n00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:12.712\nIt'll launch the group policy editor.\n\n463\n00:23:12.712 --> 00:23:15.876\nAnd I want you to know that if you\nget down into group policy and\n\n464\n00:23:15.876 --> 00:23:19.913\nagain these are where you can define\nsettings that are applied to the computer\n\n465\n00:23:19.913 --> 00:23:22.602\nto basically control\nthe computing environment.\n\n466\n00:23:22.602 --> 00:23:26.869\nIf we get into, not Administrative\nTemplates, excuse me, Windows Settings,\n\n467\n00:23:26.869 --> 00:23:29.410\nand then Security Settings.\n\n468\n00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:37.490\nAnd then you'll have this local policies\nhere, all right, and Security Options.\n\n469\n00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:42.480\nNow, there's a lot of individual settings\nthat we could configure here, all right.\n\n470\n00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.272\nI wanna kind of leave this zoomed in and\n\n471\n00:23:44.272 --> 00:23:47.584\nshow you how you can get to the user\naccount control portion very fast.\n\n472\n00:23:47.584 --> 00:23:50.140\nIt's actually the last one in\nthe list of these settings here.\n\n473\n00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:54.050\nAnd if you just click policy one time,\nit reverses the alphabetic order.\n\n474\n00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:55.100\nSo you can see.\n\n475\n00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.290\nYou can get more granular here.\n\n476\n00:23:58.290 --> 00:23:59.920\nWith the user account control.\n\n477\n00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.690\nI can say that you know what?\n\n478\n00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:04.800\nIf a standard user goes to\nlaunch an application that\n\n479\n00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:09.370\nneeds administrative access,\nI want you to automatically deny them.\n\n480\n00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:15.109\nRight now the admins get prompted for\nconsents.\n\n481\n00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.820\nUnsecure desktop notice in the policy it\ntells you what the dimming in the desktop\n\n482\n00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:22.180\nis but\nit's kind of hidden unless you see that.\n\n483\n00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:23.830\nSo that's what we just see.\n\n484\n00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:26.730\nThe default behavior,\noops sorry guys and gals out there.\n\n485\n00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:29.530\nThe default behavior of\nthe elevation prompt for\n\n486\n00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:32.960\nstandard users on the other\nhand is prompt for credentials.\n\n487\n00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:37.040\nThat's what we see we Zach's\naccount tested that for us.\n\n488\n00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.030\nAnd to put in username and password.\n\n489\n00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:42.780\nBut, you know what, if I want and I double\nclick this, I can say, you know what,\n\n490\n00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:46.160\nI don't want you to prompt for\ncredentials at all.\n\n491\n00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:52.640\nWhat I want you to do is I want you to\nautomatically deny an elevation request.\n\n492\n00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.630\nKeep out of sight all of mine.\n\n493\n00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:57.180\nLet's go ahead and do that.\n\n494\n00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:58.049\nLet's apply that and\n\n495\n00:24:58.049 --> 00:25:01.097\nI think the last thing we'll do here\nis torture poor Zach's account here.\n\n496\n00:25:01.097 --> 00:25:02.184\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're going to go ahead.\n\n497\n00:25:02.184 --> 00:25:08.169\nThank you Zach and we'll sign out and\nwhen we sign back in,\n\n498\n00:25:08.169 --> 00:25:12.092\nwe'll sign back in as Mr. Zach here.\n\n499\n00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:19.730\nAnd let me make sure that we\nare signing in locally here.\n\n500\n00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:23.622\nJust trying to login to the domain and\nI don't need that.\n\n501\n00:25:23.622 --> 00:25:24.422\nWe'll go ahead and\n\n502\n00:25:24.422 --> 00:25:26.612\nwe'll see all right if we-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n503\n00:25:26.612 --> 00:25:28.294\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; All right if we right click,\n\n504\n00:25:28.294 --> 00:25:30.116\nthat's right this his new background and\n\n505\n00:25:30.116 --> 00:25:32.970\nnotice that we have our\nadministrative command prompt here.\n\n506\n00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:34.090\nWe'll go ahead and launch that.\n\n507\n00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:38.600\nAnd it is not allowing me to launch.\n\n508\n00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.300\nAnd you know what it doesn't look\nlike it's applying the setting.\n\n509\n00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:42.730\nOkay, so\n\n510\n00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:47.700\nsometimes when you apply a setting you\nhave to make sure that it applies.\n\n511\n00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.390\nSo here I'm gonna show ya\na little trick that you can do.\n\n512\n00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:54.740\nWe're gonna use Zach's account and we\nwill elevate the group policy management.\n\n513\n00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.350\nThere we go,\nthere we go that's what I wanted to see.\n\n514\n00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:00.630\nIt didn't work on the first one,\nbut it did work on the second one.\n\n515\n00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:04.170\nNotice it says, you don't have\nthe permission to perform this operation.\n\n516\n00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:06.090\nAccess is denied.\n\n517\n00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:06.890\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n518\n00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:09.500\n&gt;&gt; You don't get the ability to do that,\nright?\n\n519\n00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.310\nAnd that says, just deny that.\n\n520\n00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:16.140\nI don't want you to give me the option.\n\n521\n00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:20.600\nAnd that's a great thing\nto have at your disposal.\n\n522\n00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.640\nNow I will tell you,\nand again like I said,\n\n523\n00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.871\nI know we're coming up\non the end of time here.\n\n524\n00:26:24.871 --> 00:26:28.977\nBut when we come back what we'll\ndo is we'll go into a part two.\n\n525\n00:26:28.977 --> 00:26:31.935\nAnd I just wanna show you a little\nbit of the interface in Windows 10 on\n\n526\n00:26:31.935 --> 00:26:33.100\nthe user account control.\n\n527\n00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:34.970\nBut we definitely don't\nhave time in this episode.\n\n528\n00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:37.330\nSo Zach what do you say we put\na comma in this episode and\n\n529\n00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:38.230\nwe come back with part two.\n\n530\n00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:41.760\n&gt;&gt; I think that's a great idea Wes,\npart two of configuring UAC and\n\n531\n00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:44.780\nantivirus within the Windows OS\nfundamentals series.\n\n532\n00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:47.650\nMake sure you watch every single episode,\ngood stuff.\n\n533\n00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:51.110\nAnd when you're in that course library\nthere are thousands of other videos there\n\n534\n00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:54.510\nthat are designed to do one\nthing help you go further.\n\n535\n00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:57.080\nTell everybody you know about ITPRO TV,\nwould you?\n\n536\n00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.620\nITPRO TV is binge worthy.\n\n537\n00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.090\nThanks for watching I'm Zach Memos.\n\n538\n00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:00.970\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n539\n00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:03.595\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again very soon.\n\n540\n00:27:03.595 --> 00:27:09.466\n[MUSIC]\n\n541\n00:27:09.466 --> 00:27:12.794\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:12.740\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPROTV\n&gt;&gt; Hello and\n\n4\n00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.250\nthank you for choosing ITPROTV, empowering\nthe world with engaging learning.\n\n5\n00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.300\nI'm your host Zach Memos.\n\n6\n00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.130\nThis episode of Windows OS fundumentals.\n\n7\n00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.370\nThis is configuring UAC and\nanti virus- Part two and\n\n8\n00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.810\nWes Bryan is here to help\nus out one more time.\n\n9\n00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.800\nWes, good to see you, sir.\n\n10\n00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.210\n&gt;&gt; Hey man, thanks for\nhaving me back Zach.\n\n11\n00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.140\nThat's right, we gonna continue\nalong with our user account control.\n\n12\n00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.895\nRemember in the first part,\ndefine the security model.\n\n13\n00:00:36.895 --> 00:00:40.195\nI said new security model, it's actually\nbeen around for a very long tome.\n\n14\n00:00:40.195 --> 00:00:45.045\nBut it's different then in the older\ndays of windows operating system, right.\n\n15\n00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:48.485\nWe talked about what the difference\nis between administrative user and\n\n16\n00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:50.015\na standard user was.\n\n17\n00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:52.410\nThen we actually got to\npick on poor Zach and\n\n18\n00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.400\nuse Zach as a demonstration\nof his account.\n\n19\n00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And we definitely limited him.\n\n20\n00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.674\n&gt;&gt; I'm limited.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] some of his abilities and\n\n21\n00:00:58.674 --> 00:01:02.460\nwe got to see a little bit about what the\nUAC looks like when it does trigger your\n\n22\n00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.995\nsystems.\n\n23\n00:01:02.995 --> 00:01:05.330\nAnd again,\nimplementing principle of least privilege.\n\n24\n00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.830\nCan we see what user account\ncontrol looks like in Windows 10?\n\n25\n00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we should probably do that.\n\n26\n00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.710\nBecause we were looking\na lot in Windows 8.1.\n\n27\n00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:12.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's go ahead and\n\n28\n00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.670\ntake the time just to kind of show\nyou here on our Windows 10 machine.\n\n29\n00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.490\nNow, we're actually believe it or not,\nwe're logged in as a standard user here.\n\n30\n00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.640\nIn this episode I won't pick on Zack.\n\n31\n00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.760\nThis is user 01.\n\n32\n00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.680\nThere's access.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n33\n00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.350\n&gt;&gt; You are safe.\n\n34\n00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.200\nBut we are logged in as user 01 and\nuser 01 is a standard user.\n\n35\n00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.263\nAll right, now to get to\ndifferent configuration settings.\n\n36\n00:01:31.263 --> 00:01:34.416\nRemember you can just right click on\nyour little Windows tile there and\n\n37\n00:01:34.416 --> 00:01:35.350\nchoose Settings.\n\n38\n00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.780\nNow, once we choose Settings,\nremember the newer interface, all right?\n\n39\n00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.460\nNow I want you to see something, Zach.\n\n40\n00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.230\nThis is kinda interesting here, right?\n\n41\n00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.970\nIf I go to Update in Security,\nRemember some of the things I told you.\n\n42\n00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.150\nI said key security settings,\nstandard users cannot modify.\n\n43\n00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.930\nAnd in the last episode,\nwe showed you how it looked like.\n\n44\n00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.540\nPretty much Windows 7 had\nthe shield to Windows 8.\n\n45\n00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.750\nAnd 8.1 has this shield and\nreally even going back to Vista.\n\n46\n00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.040\nBut let's go ahead and let's change over.\n\n47\n00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.690\nWe'll take one of these settings, right?\n\n48\n00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.900\nOkay so one of the things I like\nis they made it a little difficult\n\n49\n00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.330\nin Windows 8 and\n8.1 to do side loading of apps.\n\n50\n00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.380\nOne of the things I really,\n\n51\n00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.960\nreally like here in Windows 10 is that\nif I want to side load apps, right?\n\n52\n00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.620\nI don't want to go through\nthe Windows store,\n\n53\n00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.430\ncuz maybe my company is testing an app.\n\n54\n00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.270\nWell, I need a way to take my\nWindows store type app and\n\n55\n00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.710\ntest it on my local machine.\n\n56\n00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.680\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, that's sideloading.\n\n57\n00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.643\nThe thing about sideloading is\nbypassing the authorized Windows store.\n\n58\n00:02:33.643 --> 00:02:36.570\nAnd putting that type of\napplication on your machine, right?\n\n59\n00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.710\nFor development purposes.\n\n60\n00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.550\nWell, great job, hats off Microsoft.\n\n61\n00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.070\nThey were thinking about\ntheir developers here.\n\n62\n00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.150\nAnd they put the developers,\n\n63\n00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.920\nthey put a category here that\nallows you to switch to side load.\n\n64\n00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.770\nOr developer mode.\n\n65\n00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.600\nNow, what do you see as lacking?\n\n66\n00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.470\nWe've seen it in Windows 8.1,\nbut we don't see it here.\n\n67\n00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.310\nWhat do you see that we don't have\nnext to any one of these settings?\n\n68\n00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.000\nNo UAC shield.\n\n69\n00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.810\nWe don't get any on it.\n\n70\n00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.398\nRight?\nAnd let me show you what I mean here.\n\n71\n00:03:06.398 --> 00:03:09.300\nAgain windows 8.1 we've seen\nthat hey it could add a shield.\n\n72\n00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.900\nAnd I clicked it was trigger\nthe user account control.\n\n73\n00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:12.860\nOur shield is gone.\n\n74\n00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.140\nSo, let me switch over to\nside loading apps for now.\n\n75\n00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.620\nLittle bit of a change in Windows 10.\n\n76\n00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:27.270\nThey're not putting the shield, they're\nnot plastering the shield all over places.\n\n77\n00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.757\nIf you go to, Configure or\nlaunch an application.\n\n78\n00:03:31.757 --> 00:03:36.010\nOr change a setting that requires the user\naccount control, you don't get the shield.\n\n79\n00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.960\nYou just get the, it triggers the warning.\n\n80\n00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.780\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n81\n00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.760\nAnd at this point,\nit would be up to me to come in here.\n\n82\n00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.360\nAnd say all right well we're gonna type\nin the username and password of somebody.\n\n83\n00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.960\nThat does have those\nadministrative level privileges.\n\n84\n00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.240\nAnd once I do that, keep in mind\nNotice that we can do sideloads.\n\n85\n00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.355\nAgain, sideloading, it could expose your\ndevice to some security risks, right.\n\n86\n00:04:02.355 --> 00:04:03.590\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; That's one of the things.\n\n87\n00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.360\nAnd again, it's saying, hey,\nyou're gonna make this change.\n\n88\n00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.300\nYou're gonna have to verify that you have\naccess to an administrative account by\n\n89\n00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.310\ntyping in the credentials.\n\n90\n00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.690\nAnd notice that it did change.\n\n91\n00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.720\nAll right, so Little bit different.\n\n92\n00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.672\nThe way it triggers is the same,\nbut, like I said, there's, for\n\n93\n00:04:21.672 --> 00:04:24.365\nthe most part, UAC has remained unchanged.\n\n94\n00:04:24.365 --> 00:04:25.702\nBut they have, kind of,\n\n95\n00:04:25.702 --> 00:04:28.961\njust buried the way it interacts\nwith the operating system.\n\n96\n00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:30.693\nI mean, the way it interacts for\nthe users.\n\n97\n00:04:30.693 --> 00:04:33.760\nBut for the most part,\nit is the same thing.\n\n98\n00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.340\nAll right, so that that's a little bit\nabout our user account control, right?\n\n99\n00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.380\nAnd actually, that's a lot of it\nabout our user account control.\n\n100\n00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.040\nAnd hopefully you are aware of it.\n\n101\n00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.860\nRemember, you can configure it\ninside of your control panel.\n\n102\n00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.360\nRemember that you can also configure\nit inside of group policy.\n\n103\n00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.471\nAll right, now, the next thing\nthat we have to be aware of are,\n\n104\n00:04:53.471 --> 00:04:55.212\nor is, I should say.\n\n105\n00:04:55.212 --> 00:04:59.190\nA technology that's, actually, been in\nWindows for a while now, all right.\n\n106\n00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.560\nAnd this technology is something\nthat is known as Windows Defender.\n\n107\n00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.050\nThis is something that was actually,\nit's been built into Windows for a while.\n\n108\n00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.240\nAnd it's kind of like\ntheir anti virus software.\n\n109\n00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:18.200\nIf we talk about anti virus, I gotta\nbe careful with the term anti virus.\n\n110\n00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.760\nBecause a virus, if you will,\nis only a specific type of malware.\n\n111\n00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.900\nIt is not all encompassing.\n\n112\n00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.880\nMalware is the more Encompassing\nterminology that you need to be aware of.\n\n113\n00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.070\nAnd what do I mean by that?\n\n114\n00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:36.532\nWell, remember that a virus is\na type of malware, if you will.\n\n115\n00:05:36.532 --> 00:05:42.450\nThat requires a host to piggyback and\nmakes its way on your system.\n\n116\n00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.420\nBut that isn't the only piece\nof exploitable code that we\n\n117\n00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.380\nneed to identify and\nprotect our systems from.\n\n118\n00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.770\nWe have things like logic bombs,\ntrojans, worms, self.\n\n119\n00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.380\nSelf generating, self replicating\nlittle pieces of malicious code right?\n\n120\n00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.420\nSo even though I say antivirus, understand\nthat I like the term antimalware.\n\n121\n00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.870\nBecause Windows Defender doesn't\njust protect against viruses,\n\n122\n00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.380\nit protects against all kinds of malware.\n\n123\n00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.680\nSo I just wanna make sure\nthat that's clear right?\n\n124\n00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.600\nEven though that the term\nhere in the title,\n\n125\n00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.050\nif you will adhere to the objectives.\n\n126\n00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.711\nThis is just more semantics for me and\n\n127\n00:06:16.711 --> 00:06:19.564\nit's fine because there's\na security firm called Symantec.\n\n128\n00:06:19.564 --> 00:06:24.313\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Keep in mind that what we can do here\n\n129\n00:06:24.313 --> 00:06:26.132\nis that we can keep\nmalware out of our system.\n\n130\n00:06:26.132 --> 00:06:28.030\n&gt;&gt; Anti-virus, anti-malware.\n\n131\n00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.820\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n132\n00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.726\nIt's the tomato tomato for them, right?\n\n133\n00:06:30.726 --> 00:06:32.264\n[CROSSTALK] So\ndon't worry about that on the exam.\n\n134\n00:06:32.264 --> 00:06:35.360\nI don't expect you to get it wrong,\nbut Remember Windows Defender, and\n\n135\n00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.590\nlet's go ahead and dive in.\n\n136\n00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.140\nLet's look at Windows Defender.\n\n137\n00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.009\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm in my Windows 8.1 machine,\n\n138\n00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:42.344\nchanges up in Windows 10.\n\n139\n00:06:42.344 --> 00:06:44.977\nAnd we'll show you the Windows 10\ninterface because that's definitely\n\n140\n00:06:44.977 --> 00:06:46.320\nimportant for the exam.\n\n141\n00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.840\nAll right, and again just right-clicking\non our Windows charm here,\n\n142\n00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.540\nwe choose control panel.\n\n143\n00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:55.000\nAnd i'm gonna go out and switch this\nfrom category view to large icons.\n\n144\n00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.510\nJust make it easier to find,\nnext to the firewall here.\n\n145\n00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.830\nFirst, scroll all the way\ndown at the bottom.\n\n146\n00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.250\nAnd when we launch windows defender,\nthis is what you'll see.\n\n147\n00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:11.580\nNow, windows defender has, has been\nrelatively unchanged for awhile, alright?\n\n148\n00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.423\nIn WIndows 7, you would go to things\nlike Microsoft Security Essentials.\n\n149\n00:07:15.423 --> 00:07:18.146\nWhich was a free anti-malware\nsoftware that you could download.\n\n150\n00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:20.080\nAnd you could install on\nyour Windows 7 machines.\n\n151\n00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.830\nSo many people were downloading it cuz\nit was free and it worked really good.\n\n152\n00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.600\nThat they said, you know what,\nwhen Windows 8 comes out.\n\n153\n00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.580\nHow about we take,\nsince we already got Windows Defender,\n\n154\n00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.170\nlet's take the Security Essentials'\nfunctionality.\n\n155\n00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:33.740\nAnd let's just integrate it\nright into Windows Defender.\n\n156\n00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.432\nNow that's why, if some of you out\nthere are still running your Windows 7.\n\n157\n00:07:37.432 --> 00:07:39.013\nThere's plenty of Windows\n7 boxes out there.\n\n158\n00:07:39.013 --> 00:07:42.110\nIt's a good operating system, and\nrunning Microsoft Security Essentials.\n\n159\n00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.433\nAnd you fire up Windows Defender,\nyou might say,\n\n160\n00:07:44.433 --> 00:07:46.103\nI've seen that interface before.\n\n161\n00:07:46.103 --> 00:07:48.551\nWell that's because today,\nSecurity Essentials and\n\n162\n00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:49.940\nDefender are one and the same.\n\n163\n00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.550\nAnd it goes a little bit\nfurther in Windows 10,\n\n164\n00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.490\nthe whole entire security\nsuite is called Defender.\n\n165\n00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:58.640\nAlright, we'll see that\ncoming up here in a second.\n\n166\n00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.343\nHere's your Windows Defender and\nlook you have a few tabs,\n\n167\n00:08:02.343 --> 00:08:04.424\noptions across the top, right?\n\n168\n00:08:04.424 --> 00:08:06.888\nWe have home, update, history,\nand settings, all right?\n\n169\n00:08:06.888 --> 00:08:10.282\nHome, this allows me to define\nwhat scan type I want, and\n\n170\n00:08:10.282 --> 00:08:11.990\nyou got a couple of options.\n\n171\n00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.110\nYou got quick scan,\nfull scan, and custom scan.\n\n172\n00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:15.460\nNow, it's kinda interesting.\n\n173\n00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:16.360\nWhat does a quick scan do?\n\n174\n00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.690\nWell you can always do hover to discover.\n\n175\n00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:20.150\nI cannot stress that enough.\n\n176\n00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:23.300\nAs you get used to the operating system,\nhover over something.\n\n177\n00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.370\nIf you don't understand what it is.\n\n178\n00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.095\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And it's gonna tell you what it\n\n179\n00:08:26.095 --> 00:08:26.835\nis, right?\n\n180\n00:08:26.835 --> 00:08:28.450\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So notice the Quick scan.\n\n181\n00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:30.120\nThe Quick scan, and\nI can just sum this up,\n\n182\n00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.780\nyou can read it in the background\nwhile you're watching the video.\n\n183\n00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:37.560\nIs it looks at the common areas that\nmalicious softwares is known to attack.\n\n184\n00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:41.020\nLet's just scan those areas because we\nkinda already have an idea that that's\n\n185\n00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.060\nwhere they'll be if they're anywhere.\n\n186\n00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:44.620\nLet's look at these spots, let's scan it.\n\n187\n00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.660\nIf you've got stuff there,\nwell, go ahead and\n\n188\n00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.730\ngo through some kind of countermeasures,\nright?\n\n189\n00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.930\nFull scan,\nFull scan says check everything.\n\n190\n00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:57.930\nNot just places that we think are common,\ncheck everything, all right?\n\n191\n00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:58.873\nSo what's the Custom scan?\n\n192\n00:08:58.873 --> 00:09:01.127\nThe custom scan is interesting.\n\n193\n00:09:01.127 --> 00:09:06.140\nThe Custom scan is still a Quick scan, but\nthen those locations that you add to it.\n\n194\n00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.070\nSo it's not quite a Full\nscan if that makes sense.\n\n195\n00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:11.490\nIt's not quite a full scan, but it says,\nin fact, let's go ahead and show you.\n\n196\n00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:13.008\nYou choose Custom, right?\n\n197\n00:09:13.008 --> 00:09:17.420\nAnd when you choose Custom, it's gonna ask\nyou what do you wanna customize, right?\n\n198\n00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.530\nMaybe I don't wanna scan\nthe whole thing but\n\n199\n00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:22.890\nI wanna scan the Users directory\nbecause temporary files,\n\n200\n00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:27.280\nI know, that some of those temporary\nfiles are in this location, right?\n\n201\n00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:32.340\nWell I can do that, I can define that\nmaybe I have a thumb drive in here\n\n202\n00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.500\nI want you to do a Quick Scan,\nbut scan that thumb drive too.\n\n203\n00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.330\nI want to find out if there's any viruses.\n\n204\n00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:38.871\nSo, a Custom scan,\n\n205\n00:09:38.871 --> 00:09:44.060\nis a quick scan plus those other\nlocations that you define,right?\n\n206\n00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.330\nFull scan says,\njust scan everything, right?\n\n207\n00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:51.420\nNow, we have the updates option here,\nright?\n\n208\n00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:55.385\nNow, the update tab is really important,\nsometimes kinda overlooked, all right?\n\n209\n00:09:55.385 --> 00:09:56.660\nWhy?\n\n210\n00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.430\nRemember what your\nWindows Defender works on.\n\n211\n00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:03.220\nWindows Defenders works on what\nare known as Web Definitions.\n\n212\n00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.780\nDefinitions define what viruses look like,\nall right?\n\n213\n00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:12.200\nI want you to think about your\nMerriam Webster's dictionary, right?\n\n214\n00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.109\nThat 250,000,\n300,000 words in a complete dictionary\n\n215\n00:10:14.109 --> 00:10:15.270\n&gt;&gt; And I've read them all.\n\n216\n00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:18.319\n&gt;&gt; And Zach has read them all, so we'll\njust test him on the end of this episode.\n\n217\n00:10:18.319 --> 00:10:20.202\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n218\n00:10:20.202 --> 00:10:23.711\nit already told me that in redundancy,\nit's C redundancy.\n\n219\n00:10:23.711 --> 00:10:24.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n220\n00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:27.480\n&gt;&gt; So think about that dictionary, right?\n\n221\n00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.881\nWhat if I was to take a good\nthird of that dictionary?\n\n222\n00:10:30.881 --> 00:10:33.894\nTake scissors and I wouldn't do this,\nI respect books, and\n\n223\n00:10:33.894 --> 00:10:37.560\nI was to cut a third of that\ndictionary right out, all right?\n\n224\n00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:42.410\nWell, you would have a third of\nMerriam-Webster's collection of\n\n225\n00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:47.190\nwords that you no longer could define\nby looking at the book, right?\n\n226\n00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:51.145\nImagine you don't have definitions for\nviruses.\n\n227\n00:10:51.145 --> 00:10:56.830\nImagine you don't update your definitions\nand new viruses come out daily.\n\n228\n00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:58.220\nThe Sun doesn't set on hackers.\n\n229\n00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.010\nA lot of times when\nthe Sun sets on hackers\n\n230\n00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:00.847\nthat's when they go to work, right?\n\n231\n00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.410\nIt's a constant revolving door.\n\n232\n00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:08.410\nSo your definitions have to be up to date\nbecause if you don't update the definition\n\n233\n00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:12.190\ndatabase it's like cutting out\na portion of the dictionary.\n\n234\n00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:13.780\nYou don't know what a virus looks like.\n\n235\n00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:17.060\nAnd more importantly your software\nlooking for those pieces of malware\n\n236\n00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:21.770\ndoesn't know what that malware is if it\ndoesn't have the definition to define it.\n\n237\n00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:26.480\nSo you need to make sure you know\nwhen the database was updated,\n\n238\n00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.810\nwhen it was created,\nwhat version it is, too?\n\n239\n00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:34.870\nAnd this is why I say malware,\nnotice virus and spyware.\n\n240\n00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:37.510\nIt doesn't just say antivirus.\n\n241\n00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:39.530\nWe've got two things in there,\ntwo pieces of malware.\n\n242\n00:11:40.732 --> 00:11:44.210\nAll right, and if you need to update\nyou can always choose Update.\n\n243\n00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:46.020\n&gt;&gt; It can happen automatically too,\ncan't it?\n\n244\n00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.880\n&gt;&gt; It can, it can, and\nthat's one of the great things out.\n\n245\n00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.750\nWe'll see in the settings how\nyou can do some scheduling too,\n\n246\n00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:52.100\nwhich is a good thing.\n\n247\n00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.520\nWindows Update is another\nautomatic way that it happens.\n\n248\n00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:03.240\nIf you set your computer to automatically\nupdate [COUGH] out to the update servers,\n\n249\n00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.930\nthen, what it'll do is it'll pull\ndown its definitions likewise too.\n\n250\n00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:10.480\nBut you can always trigger\na definition update too, all right?\n\n251\n00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.220\nWe got a history,\nyou could see a few things.\n\n252\n00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:19.240\nSome of the pieces of malware\nthat have been quarantine, right?\n\n253\n00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:23.360\nIf we find them out a piece of malware, we\nput in a location where it can't react or\n\n254\n00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.240\nit can't interact with the rest\nof the operating system and\n\n255\n00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:31.600\nit applies an action too that device or\nthat piece of malware, right?\n\n256\n00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:36.060\nThe reaction is base on how you define it,\nquarantine in Intel I look at it just go\n\n257\n00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:40.260\nahead take the action to the quarantine\ndevice and delete them immediately, right?\n\n258\n00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.880\nAllowed items, all right?\n\n259\n00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.460\nAllowed items are those items that maybe\nlook like viruses and Windows Defender,\n\n260\n00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:46.280\neven though it's really good,\n\n261\n00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:50.850\nit usually doesn't do this, but sometimes\nyou'll have, I'll give you an example.\n\n262\n00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:54.450\nWe have some hosts here and some\nsubject matter experts that come in and\n\n263\n00:12:54.450 --> 00:13:01.090\nthey work with applications that look just\nlike viruses, they work just like viruses.\n\n264\n00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:04.542\nWell, if they are working\nwith those devices, right?\n\n265\n00:13:04.542 --> 00:13:05.530\nI keep saying devices.\n\n266\n00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:09.290\nIf they're working with those pieces\nof software Windows Defender might flag\n\n267\n00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:13.510\nas a piece of malware and quarantine it\nand then if your default action is to\n\n268\n00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:16.010\ndelete it, it just deleted what\nyou are working with, right?\n\n269\n00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:18.580\nSo you might have to\nwhitelist some things.\n\n270\n00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.070\nAnd that's what the allowed\nitems might be.\n\n271\n00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:23.580\nAnd then maybe the all detected items.\n\n272\n00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.420\nRemember our User Account Control?\n\n273\n00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:30.685\nWhy would viewing\nthe details of a quarantine,\n\n274\n00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:33.050\na scan that produces quarantined malware?\n\n275\n00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:37.260\nWhy would it require User Account Control\nas being able to see that information?\n\n276\n00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:41.880\nAnd that's because you can see\nright here in the definition.\n\n277\n00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.740\nTo help protect user's privacy, right?\n\n278\n00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:48.880\nBut if it finds anything, we can always\nview the details, User Account Control's\n\n279\n00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:53.390\ngonna trigger here, and\nthat's a good thing, to see an empty list.\n\n280\n00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:56.500\nSome of the other setting you have in\nhere, you have real-time protection.\n\n281\n00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:00.990\nRTP, Real Time Protection,\nagain, turns on and again,\n\n282\n00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:05.130\nthis basically allows Windows Defender\nto do what it needs to do, right?\n\n283\n00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:08.880\nYou don't want to disable this, or you're\nessentially disabling Windows Defender.\n\n284\n00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n285\n00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:12.374\n&gt;&gt; Excluded files and\nlocations, these are again,\n\n286\n00:14:12.374 --> 00:14:15.478\nif I have certain files that\nmaybe look like a virus.\n\n287\n00:14:15.478 --> 00:14:18.971\nOr even when we're doing things like\npenetration testing on a machine where\n\n288\n00:14:18.971 --> 00:14:22.590\nmaybe while testing it even in a lab\nenvironment what these viruses are doing.\n\n289\n00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:26.860\nWell, I don't want a Windows Defender\nflagging that and deleting it.\n\n290\n00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.420\nSo I can make exclusions,\n\n291\n00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:33.320\nincluding entire types as well as\nprocesses that run on the machine.\n\n292\n00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.030\nNow the Advanced tab.\n\n293\n00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:38.678\nWhen we look at the Advanced tab this\nis where we start to get into some\n\n294\n00:14:38.678 --> 00:14:42.390\nof the different settings that we\ncan do Scanning removable drives,\n\n295\n00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:46.934\nfor instances creating system restore\npoints before you delete that information,\n\n296\n00:14:46.934 --> 00:14:50.330\ncreate a restore point so\nthat if you delete that information.\n\n297\n00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:51.790\n&gt;&gt; Important.\n\n298\n00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:54.600\n&gt;&gt; Exactly it doesn't\ncorrupt other things, and\n\n299\n00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:58.770\nif it does corrupt other pieces of the\noperating system we want a point in time\n\n300\n00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:01.000\nto actually restore our\nconfiguration state too.\n\n301\n00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.180\nAllowing users to view the full\nhistory that's up to you.\n\n302\n00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:09.030\nHow long do you want to keep these files?\n\n303\n00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:11.420\nIf they've been quarantined\nyou can change the default.\n\n304\n00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.310\nYou might say a day,\ngive me a day to look at it.\n\n305\n00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:16.260\nIf I don't look at it after a day\napparently I've got better things to\n\n306\n00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.390\nbe doing just go ahead and delete it.\n\n307\n00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:22.240\nAll right, and\nthen you can also send some samples\n\n308\n00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.710\nwhen they say when further\nanalysis is required.\n\n309\n00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:29.313\nAnd this is really good too because this\nis where you if you send these samples,\n\n310\n00:15:29.313 --> 00:15:31.219\nMicrosoft becomes aware of it.\n\n311\n00:15:31.219 --> 00:15:33.924\nThey update their definition database and\n\n312\n00:15:33.924 --> 00:15:38.579\nthey can put out patches to potential\nvulnerabilities that they find, or\n\n313\n00:15:38.579 --> 00:15:43.780\nat least define the definition, so that\nWindows Defender can spot these things.\n\n314\n00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.180\nAll right, so\nthat's Windows Defender on Windows 8.\n\n315\n00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:47.620\nWhat do you say we go ahead and\n\n316\n00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:51.280\nwe switch on over to our Windows 10\nmachine like I was telling you Zach.\n\n317\n00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.580\nAnd we'll look at this on a Windows\n10 machine and see what we find.\n\n318\n00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:55.469\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n319\n00:15:55.469 --> 00:16:01.063\n&gt;&gt; All right so,\nin Windows 10 let's go ahead and\n\n320\n00:16:01.063 --> 00:16:04.342\nget into our settings here.\n\n321\n00:16:04.342 --> 00:16:09.658\nAnd once you're in Settings, our\nWindows Defender software is in Update and\n\n322\n00:16:09.658 --> 00:16:15.626\nSecurity, and one of the things you'll see\nhere is once we get into Windows Defender,\n\n323\n00:16:15.626 --> 00:16:18.190\nI want you to notice something here.\n\n324\n00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:21.705\nNotice it says you must be an\nadministrator to change Windows Defender\n\n325\n00:16:21.705 --> 00:16:22.710\nanti-virus, right?\n\n326\n00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:24.380\nSo, they're calling it anti-virus,\nas well.\n\n327\n00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:25.020\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n328\n00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:28.100\n&gt;&gt; But notice this\nOpen Windows Defender Security Center?\n\n329\n00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:29.070\nWhat is that about?\n\n330\n00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:31.340\nWell, what I like about this and in fact,\n\n331\n00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:36.070\nlet's show you what this about and\nwe'll go ahead and launch it up here.\n\n332\n00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:39.800\nThis is a really, really cool piece\nof software, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n333\n00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.010\nI really like this.\n\n334\n00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:43.120\nAnd here's why.\n\n335\n00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.970\nAll right, Microsoft has a lot of\ndifferent moving pieces when it comes to\n\n336\n00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:47.760\nsecurity, right?\n\n337\n00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.580\nIt's all part of dynamic security.\n\n338\n00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:53.410\nYou've got things like the SmartScreen\nfilter that works with applications and\n\n339\n00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:56.070\nwebsites that you view inside\nof your browser, right?\n\n340\n00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:59.230\nYou have your Windows firewall,\nyou have your Windows Defender.\n\n341\n00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:03.120\nAll these moving pieces that\nare trying to keep your device secure.\n\n342\n00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.910\nMicrosoft and many other vendors do this,\n\n343\n00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:09.780\nI'm really glad to see Microsoft doing\nthis in their security endeavors, says,\n\n344\n00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:13.400\nyou know what, let's do UTM,\nUnified Threat Management.\n\n345\n00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.060\nLet's take all these moving pieces and\n\n346\n00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:18.350\nrather than have to open five different\nwindows to management security,\n\n347\n00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:22.190\nwhy don't you open one window and\nyou can manage all your security from it.\n\n348\n00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:23.910\nAnd that's what we have here, right?\n\n349\n00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:26.830\nWe have virus, and\nyou guys can read these, right,\n\n350\n00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:28.240\nyou guys are a sharp crowd out here.\n\n351\n00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:32.350\nVirus and threat protection, device\nperformance and health, firewall and\n\n352\n00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:35.750\nnetwork protection, app and\nbrowser control, right?\n\n353\n00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:38.920\nThings like our smart screen filter right?\n\n354\n00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:43.170\nAre we gonna allow things like\ndifferent extensions to run and stuff.\n\n355\n00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:44.850\nAnd then family options, right?\n\n356\n00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:46.330\nAnd that's really good,\nthe parental options.\n\n357\n00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.130\nThat's really good when you have kids,\nright?\n\n358\n00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:53.410\nSo they give you this nice, tile-type\nclick interface, really simplistic.\n\n359\n00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:55.940\nBut then, and\nthis is the default by the way,\n\n360\n00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:59.880\nI kinda un-collapsed that with\nthe little three bar here.\n\n361\n00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.940\nBut notice that it is collapsed on\nitself and if you hit these three\n\n362\n00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:08.980\nbars right here, you'll see that you can\ngo into each individual section, right?\n\n363\n00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:11.080\nSo here's your virus and\nthreat protection and\n\n364\n00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:14.810\nit's part of\nWindows Defender Security Center, right?\n\n365\n00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:17.410\n[LAUGH] Make sure we get all\nof those together, right?\n\n366\n00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:18.960\nAnd I can do a quick scan, right?\n\n367\n00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.910\nAnd that's really all they\ngive you the heads-up display.\n\n368\n00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:27.760\nBut you can go to advanced scans, and\nthis is where you can change, right?\n\n369\n00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:31.190\nWhat is a Windows Defender Offline scan?\n\n370\n00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:34.480\nThis is so\ncool to be put in the operating system.\n\n371\n00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.380\nYou might not have heard of this before,\nbut\n\n372\n00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:40.210\nthey have a Windows Defender Offline\npiece of software.\n\n373\n00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.040\nWhy is that important?\n\n374\n00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:46.350\nAll right, if you've ever had\nto do some anti-virus removal or\n\n375\n00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:50.180\nsome virus removals one of the things\nthat you'll know is that when you remove\n\n376\n00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.370\na virus from a certain location\nwhile the operating system is on.\n\n377\n00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:55.010\nSometimes they protect themselves and\n\n378\n00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:58.235\nthey replicate themselves to five\ndifferent locations somewhere else, right?\n\n379\n00:18:58.235 --> 00:19:02.550\nThey can be very problematic\nto get rid of, right?\n\n380\n00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:05.966\nWell what if we shut the hard drive down\nand the operating system isn't running?\n\n381\n00:19:05.966 --> 00:19:09.413\nAnd we put an application in RAM and\nwe let that application look at\n\n382\n00:19:09.413 --> 00:19:13.720\nthe hard drive looking at those same\nlocations for files that are now offline?\n\n383\n00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:14.890\n&gt;&gt; That's fantastic.\n\n384\n00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:15.820\n&gt;&gt; Love it, right?\n\n385\n00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:18.940\nBut what you'd have to do is you'd have\nto go to a separate cost, still free.\n\n386\n00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:22.540\nAnd those of you that maybe don't\nhave Windows 10, check it out.\n\n387\n00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:26.050\nWindows Defender Offline, WDO, all right?\n\n388\n00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:28.020\nYou go out and\nyou download a separate ISO file.\n\n389\n00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.340\nYou burn it to a disk, you make it\na bootable DVD or bootable USB,\n\n390\n00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:34.220\nthrow it in there and\nnow we got access to it.\n\n391\n00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:36.410\nWindows 10 comes along they say,\nyou know what?\n\n392\n00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:39.020\nLet's take Windows Defender offline,\nthrow it into\n\n393\n00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:43.640\nthe Windows Defender Security Center and\nwe'll let you do an offline scan.\n\n394\n00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:47.194\nJust like CHKDSK where we schedule it, and\nit restarts just like the Windows memory\n\n395\n00:19:47.194 --> 00:19:49.860\ndiagnostic toolkit that does\nan offline test of your memory.\n\n396\n00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:53.090\nNow Windows Defender does\nan offline scan of your hard drive\n\n397\n00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:55.080\nwhile those viruses are no longer active.\n\n398\n00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.422\nGreat thing to have.\n\n399\n00:19:57.422 --> 00:20:01.540\nSo I'm really excited,\nif you guys can't tell about this.\n\n400\n00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:03.620\nI really like this\nfunctionality in this feature.\n\n401\n00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.920\nI really give hats off to\nMicrosoft on this, all right?\n\n402\n00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:09.882\nDevice performance and health issues\nall relates to security, right?\n\n403\n00:20:09.882 --> 00:20:13.740\nPerformance and health of your system,\nif you don't have performance,\n\n404\n00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:17.335\nit reduces productivity,\nreduces the availability of your data,\n\n405\n00:20:17.335 --> 00:20:23.310\ndoes run counter to security.\n\n406\n00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:27.970\nStorage capacity, device drivers, right,\nI love this, it's really, really good.\n\n407\n00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:29.780\nFirewall and network protection,\n\n408\n00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:35.890\nthis shows me what profiles we have\nattached to the machine right now.\n\n409\n00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:38.830\nYou can see that right now\nI'm in a domain environment.\n\n410\n00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:41.070\nSo the domain profile I can see is active.\n\n411\n00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:44.510\nAnd I click this and it can tell me\na little bit more information about that.\n\n412\n00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:45.610\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Including blocking\n\n413\n00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:48.110\nincoming connections, right?\n\n414\n00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:50.670\nBasically, I could say, hey,\nblock everything unless it's on this list.\n\n415\n00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:52.050\nIf it's on this list, allow it through.\n\n416\n00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:55.060\nIf it's not on that list, chuck it at\nthe door, don't even let it through.\n\n417\n00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:56.280\n&gt;&gt; Well, things sure have changed.\n\n418\n00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.740\nI remember back in the day,\nwhen you just had a firewall.\n\n419\n00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.260\n&gt;&gt; That's it, that's-\n&gt;&gt; That's all it was!\n\n420\n00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.050\n&gt;&gt; And it's funny,\nbecause we talk about that, Zach.\n\n421\n00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:04.125\nI remember in the days when\nyou didn't have a firewall.\n\n422\n00:21:04.125 --> 00:21:08.307\n[LAUGH] XP Service Pack 2 was the one that\nbrought the firewall in and prior to that,\n\n423\n00:21:08.307 --> 00:21:09.940\nwe'd go to Zone Alarm.\n\n424\n00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.010\nAll right, I digress here.\n\n425\n00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:14.280\nApp and browser, oops,\nI skipped one there,\n\n426\n00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.440\ncuz I really want you guys to\nsee these settings, right?\n\n427\n00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.600\nI told you a little bit about\nthe SmartScreen filter, right?\n\n428\n00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.800\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And again,\n\n429\n00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:24.170\nyou can set that right here to\ncheck apps and files that still.\n\n430\n00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:26.730\nNotice how they're saying\nWindows Defender SmartScreen?\n\n431\n00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:28.440\nThey used to just call it SmartScreen.\n\n432\n00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.700\nNow that everything is blended into\nWindows Defender Security Center,\n\n433\n00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:35.060\nit's gonna have kind of like that\nWindows Defender prefix on it.\n\n434\n00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:38.910\nOr it's not really a prefix, but those\ncouple of words attached to it, all right?\n\n435\n00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:42.570\nWe've got SmartScreen filter for\nMicrosoft Edge, too, not just Explorer but\n\n436\n00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:44.280\nEdge as well.\n\n437\n00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:47.220\nAs well as SmartScreen filter for\nthe Windows Store apps and\n\n438\n00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:49.350\nthen exploit protection, right?\n\n439\n00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:50.690\nReally, really cool, out of the box.\n\n440\n00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:53.620\nYour device is already set up with\nthe protection that works best for\n\n441\n00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:54.450\nmost people.\n\n442\n00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:58.315\nNow, you can go into Exploit\nprotection settings and\n\n443\n00:21:58.315 --> 00:22:02.765\nyou can change some of this, for\ninstance, data execution protection.\n\n444\n00:22:02.765 --> 00:22:07.167\nThis is Microsoft's implementation of a\nindustry wide standard called no execute,\n\n445\n00:22:07.167 --> 00:22:08.855\nNX bit.\n\n446\n00:22:08.855 --> 00:22:12.575\nAnd that basically is a lot\nof technical terms for,\n\n447\n00:22:12.575 --> 00:22:18.060\nhey, this portion of RAM memory, when\nyou put data here, you can't execute it.\n\n448\n00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:21.025\nThey implement it as data\nexecution protection, right?\n\n449\n00:22:21.025 --> 00:22:23.950\nIt's all based off that NX\nindustry wide standard, right?\n\n450\n00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:27.550\nOther systems implement that too,\nCPUs also.\n\n451\n00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:33.370\nAnd then some additional things\nhere as well too, right?\n\n452\n00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:37.070\nRandomization of locations for\nvirtual memory allocations.\n\n453\n00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:39.080\nAgain, this is kind of interesting,\n\n454\n00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.040\nbecause the way your Virtual Memory\nManager works in your operating system,\n\n455\n00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:45.388\nis that your devices and applications,\nthey don't have direct access to memory.\n\n456\n00:22:45.388 --> 00:22:47.300\nThat's a privileged level, and\n\n457\n00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:51.140\nsome hardware has access to that, portions\nof the kernel have access to that.\n\n458\n00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:54.350\nBut for the most part,\nyou don't want applications to have access\n\n459\n00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:58.300\nto the Virtual Memory Manager, cuz then\nthey can start to manipulate it and stuff.\n\n460\n00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:03.250\nWhat this does is it just makes\nsure that when a request is done or\n\n461\n00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:05.720\ncalled for the memory,\nthe Virtual Memory Manager\n\n462\n00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.220\nrandomizes where it actually\ngets stored in physical RAM.\n\n463\n00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:14.630\nSo a lot of really cool features in\nhere that are new to the Windows\n\n464\n00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:18.120\noperating system that I highly recommend\nyou guys going through and checking out.\n\n465\n00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:22.500\nAnd then learning how to utilize these as\nwell, not just from an exam standpoint,\n\n466\n00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:25.930\nbut for a real world application,\nbecause it is important.\n\n467\n00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:30.420\nAnd then if you're like Zach and I you\nhave children, this is a great thing,\n\n468\n00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:35.120\nbecause they actually started this in\nWindows 8.1 with your Microsoft account.\n\n469\n00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.730\nWe've had parental settings in Windows for\na while, but now it can integrate with\n\n470\n00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:42.590\nthings like the cloud, and\nthis is something I absolutely love.\n\n471\n00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:48.470\nWhen you sign in with your Microsoft\naccount if you create a child account,\n\n472\n00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:51.600\nliterally for your child,\nwith your Microsoft account.\n\n473\n00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.010\nWhen they login into the computer,\n\n474\n00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:56.650\nit's gonna take their activity\ngenerate a report and email it to you.\n\n475\n00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:59.196\nSo you could turn around,\nopen up that email and\n\n476\n00:23:59.196 --> 00:24:01.307\nI could see, my kid was browsing.\n\n477\n00:24:01.307 --> 00:24:05.507\nMy kid should be browsing, but\nlet's just say theoretically,\n\n478\n00:24:05.507 --> 00:24:09.532\nmy kid was on YouTube Yeah,\nthat's a no no, that's not allowed, right.\n\n479\n00:24:09.532 --> 00:24:13.320\nAnd it wouldn't happen if you're\nright there in front of you, but\n\n480\n00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:16.040\nagain kids can get\nthey're definitely smart.\n\n481\n00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.124\n&gt;&gt; Kids can be kids.\n\n482\n00:24:17.124 --> 00:24:17.883\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, thanks Zack.\n\n483\n00:24:17.883 --> 00:24:20.460\nExactly, spoken like a true dad,\nthat's exactly it, right?\n\n484\n00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:21.729\n&gt;&gt; Five kids, five.\n\n485\n00:24:21.729 --> 00:24:25.154\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This allows you the ability\nto track what they're doing.\n\n486\n00:24:25.154 --> 00:24:28.840\nAs well as to reel it in when you need to\ncontrol what level of access they have to\n\n487\n00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:32.515\nthe system and other things,\nincluding things like the Internet, right?\n\n488\n00:24:32.515 --> 00:24:33.241\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n489\n00:24:33.241 --> 00:24:34.683\n&gt;&gt; So, great things to happen.\n\n490\n00:24:34.683 --> 00:24:39.305\nWe come in here,\nwe view some of the family settings\n\n491\n00:24:39.305 --> 00:24:43.070\nhere if it will pump up, let's see here.\n\n492\n00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:48.648\nYep, in some of these you actually have\nto be logged into your Microsoft account.\n\n493\n00:24:48.648 --> 00:24:51.460\nThere we go, it's launching Edge,\nthat's what I thought it was gonna do.\n\n494\n00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:53.270\nAnd I'm not gonna go ahead and\nlaunch it, because again,\n\n495\n00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:55.490\nit's gonna be tied to\nyour Microsoft account.\n\n496\n00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:59.936\nAnd that's how they kind of keep\nyou aware of what's going on.\n\n497\n00:24:59.936 --> 00:25:06.210\nSo this is your Windows Defender Security\ninside of your Windows Operating System.\n\n498\n00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:10.124\nAnd again, pay attention to your updates,\nlike I said, let me back out of this,\n\n499\n00:25:10.124 --> 00:25:11.173\nlet me go to the home.\n\n500\n00:25:11.173 --> 00:25:14.808\nIn fact, we will close down our\nsecurity center all the way,\n\n501\n00:25:14.808 --> 00:25:19.690\nlet's get back to our settings\nUupdates in security, Windows updates.\n\n502\n00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:24.364\nAnd if we look at our view\ninstall update history,\n\n503\n00:25:24.364 --> 00:25:27.380\nI don't have any definitions.\n\n504\n00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:30.850\nI don't see any definition database here.\n\n505\n00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:31.677\nGuess what?\n\n506\n00:25:31.677 --> 00:25:36.075\nThis is great because the malicious\nsoftware removal toolkit is the next thing\n\n507\n00:25:36.075 --> 00:25:37.460\nwe have to talk about.\n\n508\n00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.272\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But I do wanna kinda show you,\n\n509\n00:25:39.272 --> 00:25:42.257\nif I can, here real quick\n&gt;&gt; Let me get back into our operating\n\n510\n00:25:42.257 --> 00:25:45.740\nsystem, and I want to show you\nthe Windows update side to this.\n\n511\n00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:49.004\nAnd if we have installed updates,\nI'm not sure,\n\n512\n00:25:49.004 --> 00:25:53.450\nthis one probably has some updates,\nbut we'll just double check.\n\n513\n00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:56.920\nWe have a Windows update here and\ncheck update history.\n\n514\n00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.450\nThere we go, Zach, I know we looked\nat quite a few of these here.\n\n515\n00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:05.415\nNotice the definition update for\nWindows Defender, this is important.\n\n516\n00:26:05.415 --> 00:26:05.944\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n517\n00:26:05.944 --> 00:26:08.620\nit's one of the reasons you\nwant to update Windows.\n\n518\n00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:11.580\nSet it and forget it,\ndo the recommended settings.\n\n519\n00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:15.719\nBecause what happens is Windows update\ndoes its updates, it also looks at your\n\n520\n00:26:15.719 --> 00:26:20.000\nWindows Defender and says, hey, what's\nthe version of the database you have?\n\n521\n00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.550\nWhat do we have here at Windows update?\n\n522\n00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:26.799\nYou're out of date, let's pull that down\nand let's apply that definition database\n\n523\n00:26:26.799 --> 00:26:29.749\nso that your computer,\nyou will be aware of the latest and,\n\n524\n00:26:29.749 --> 00:26:32.660\nwell, greatest,\nthere's nothing great about a virus.\n\n525\n00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:37.540\nLatest and worst of the viruses,\nif you will, all right.\n\n526\n00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:43.088\nNow this does a good job\nof protecting your system,\n\n527\n00:26:43.088 --> 00:26:48.000\nall right, while it's online, all right.\n\n528\n00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:54.730\nWhat happens or trying to prevent exploits\nfrom getting on to your computer?\n\n529\n00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:59.760\nWhat happens if the exploits have\nalready made their way to your computer?\n\n530\n00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:03.700\nDo we have a piece of software\nthat will help us with that?\n\n531\n00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:06.468\nWe do, but you're gonna have to wait for\na part three.\n\n532\n00:27:06.468 --> 00:27:09.345\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we'll talk about something known as\n\n533\n00:27:09.345 --> 00:27:13.240\nthe malicious software removal toolkit,\nMRT for short.\n\n534\n00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:16.300\n&gt;&gt; Configuring UAZ and\nanti virus part three.\n\n535\n00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:17.600\nMake sure you see part one and part two.\n\n536\n00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.734\nAnd see everything inside\nthe

00:00:12.110\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.630\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for choosing ITPro\nTV, helping you learn wherever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.300\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, for\nthis episode of Windows OS fundamentals.\n\n6\n00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.570\nWe are configuring UAC and\nAntivirus Part 3, and\n\n7\n00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.832\nbringing us the information we need is,\nonce again, the one and only, Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:29.832 --> 00:00:32.752\n&gt;&gt; Hey, [LAUGH] that was very good,\nhow do you follow that?\n\n9\n00:00:32.752 --> 00:00:35.219\nThat's right, well we're coming back,\n\n10\n00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.533\nwe've got a few things that we need to\nround up, or round off, if you will,\n\n11\n00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:43.770\nwhen it comes to our UAC,\nlike Zach said, and antivirus, right?\n\n12\n00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.270\nOne of the last things that we\nneed to talk about, all right,\n\n13\n00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.520\nis something known as the malicious\nsoftware removal toolkit.\n\n14\n00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.470\nIt is called MRT for short, and\n\n15\n00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.800\nwhen we look in the last episode\nwe looked at our Windows Defender.\n\n16\n00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.010\nRemember that Windows defender.\n\n17\n00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.210\nWhat does it allow us to do?\n\n18\n00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.610\nBut it allows us to try to prevent\n\n19\n00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.510\nmalware from making its way\non to our machines, right?\n\n20\n00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.740\nIt's before, right?\n\n21\n00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.700\nWell, what happens to the after, right?\n\n22\n00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.667\nOnce you get some kind of malware that's\nalready on your system, all right?\n\n23\n00:01:21.667 --> 00:01:25.578\nWell, if Windows Defender\ndoesn't catch it,\n\n24\n00:01:25.578 --> 00:01:32.480\nyou do have another piece of software that\nyou can run, but it is after the fact.\n\n25\n00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.730\n&gt;&gt; Now, is this new for 10, or\nis this been around a little bit longer?\n\n26\n00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:36.666\n&gt;&gt; It's been around for, and\n\n27\n00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:38.925\nI'm glad you asked that,\ncuz really it goes back to Windows 7.\n\n28\n00:01:38.925 --> 00:01:43.270\nMRT's in Windows 7,\nthe malicious software removal toolkit.\n\n29\n00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.684\nIt's in Windows 7, Windows 8,\n8.1 and Windows 10.\n\n30\n00:01:46.684 --> 00:01:50.680\nBut you have make sure you\nupdate your machines, all right?\n\n31\n00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.433\nWhy do I say that?\n\n32\n00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:56.941\nWell, because they\nare constantly updating the MRT,\n\n33\n00:01:56.941 --> 00:02:00.470\nthe malicious software removal toolkit.\n\n34\n00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.910\nAgain, you'll see here, I'll show you\nwhy it's abbreviated MRT, all right?\n\n35\n00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.550\nBecause this is a piece of software that,\nwhen its definitions update,\n\n36\n00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.470\nit's really kind of like a roll\nup of the whole application.\n\n37\n00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.810\nSo this isn't something that,\n\n38\n00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.450\nyou download the MRT once and\nyou don't have to download it again.\n\n39\n00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.480\nYou might see that you go through periods\nof time where you have to redownload it\n\n40\n00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.880\ncuz they're constantly updating it to\ntry to stay ahead of the game, right?\n\n41\n00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.600\nWhen it comes to hackers, or\nattacks and exploits, if you will.\n\n42\n00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.770\nLet me show you here.\n\n43\n00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.630\nIf we get down into our Windows\n10 machine here, I can type mrt.\n\n44\n00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.880\nAnd if I just type mrt,\nthis is why I always abbreviate it mrt,\n\n45\n00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.700\nit's a really easy way to launch it,\nright?\n\n46\n00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.030\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; When I run that, you'll see here,\n\n47\n00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.680\ngive it a second.\n\n48\n00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.690\nAnd if it's the first time that it's run,\nit might take a second to actually launch\n\n49\n00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.850\nor in my case, it looks like I'm\nstill in a standard user account.\n\n50\n00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.965\nLet me go ahead and we'll authenticate.\n\n51\n00:03:01.251 --> 00:03:06.340\nAnd, okay, and this is one of the things\nI want you to see here, all right?\n\n52\n00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.380\nNotice that it doesn't say, hey, you\nneed to update your computer, all right?\n\n53\n00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.750\nLittle bit different on how\nwe manage this show or,\n\n54\n00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.020\nexcuse me, this piece of software, right?\n\n55\n00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.910\nWhen we talk about this software,\nagain, you don't just\n\n56\n00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.730\nupdate a definition database like\nyou do with Windows Defender.\n\n57\n00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.460\nWindows Defender stays in, it's built-in,\nit's baked into your operating system.\n\n58\n00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.324\nMRT may or may not be there, all right?\n\n59\n00:03:36.324 --> 00:03:38.200\nOne of the easiest ways to check?\n\n60\n00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.540\nOpen up your search functionality and\ntype MRT.\n\n61\n00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.250\nThe other thing that you can do,\nif we pull up our settings.\n\n62\n00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.860\nAll right, and I'll right click\non our little Windows charm here.\n\n63\n00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.920\nI know I've been doing this on the other\nside of the task bar with the notification\n\n64\n00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.630\narea, but you can also get to it\nfrom here on the left hand side.\n\n65\n00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.400\nBut one of the things\nthat you need to know is\n\n66\n00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.130\nif you're in your Windows settings,\nright, and you go to Update and Security.\n\n67\n00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.970\nAnd you look for\nyour installed update history.\n\n68\n00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.300\nFor me I just happen to\nknow that this is here.\n\n69\n00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.040\nAnd I look at other updates.\n\n70\n00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.420\nNotice the Windows Malicious Software\nRemoval Tool Kit for Windows 8, 8.1,\n\n71\n00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.510\nWindows 10 and\nwish could see all the other family.\n\n72\n00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.530\nNow, I already got MRT.\n\n73\n00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.900\nBut notice when it ran,\nit gives me this warning.\n\n74\n00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.870\nIt didn't say you need to\nconnect to Windows Update and\n\n75\n00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.780\nyou need to download definitions, no.\n\n76\n00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.760\nIt said you need to pull\ndown the whole application.\n\n77\n00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.190\nAnd that's another one of\nthe major differences about\n\n78\n00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.810\nthe malicious software removal tool kit.\n\n79\n00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.650\nAll right, I'm gonna go ahead and\nlet's run our MRT, all right?\n\n80\n00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.750\nNow you wanna understand that\nthis is January of 2018.\n\n81\n00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.410\nAll right, January, were now in March.\n\n82\n00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.004\nAt the time.\n\n83\n00:05:00.004 --> 00:05:03.450\nWe don't like to really date the shows\nhere, but we're in March of 2018.\n\n84\n00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:08.720\nThat is only, not even three months\nsince this has been released,\n\n85\n00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.480\nand they already say there's\na new version available.\n\n86\n00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.250\nThey update this piece of software\nfast and they do that for a purpose.\n\n87\n00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.860\nTo keep it sharp, it's basic\ninterface hasn't changed at all,\n\n88\n00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.040\nso what the heck are they doing?\n\n89\n00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.590\nYou didn't change the interface,\nyou're not giving me pretty bells and\n\n90\n00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.550\nwhistles, what are you\nconstantly updating?\n\n91\n00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.200\n&gt;&gt; Can't you set this to\nupdate automatically?\n\n92\n00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.430\n&gt;&gt; No, you cannot, and\nthat's another thing.\n\n93\n00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.890\nAnd that's why I said it's\na big difference there, Zach,\n\n94\n00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.640\nbetween the Defender, right?\n\n95\n00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.720\nWindows Defender updates, and we've seen\nthat, it pulled down the definitions and\n\n96\n00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.090\nwe've seen it in the update history.\n\n97\n00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.050\nThis is the whole stand-alone application\nthat needs to be downloaded, right?\n\n98\n00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.600\nAnd that's again,\njust to keep ahead of the attackers.\n\n99\n00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.610\nNotice, all right?\n\n100\n00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.520\nThis tool is not a replacement for\nanti-virus, all right?\n\n101\n00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.210\nWhy?\n\n102\n00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.190\nThis doesn´t give you real-time\nprotection, Windows Defender does.\n\n103\n00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.230\nIt gives you RTP, real-time protection\nmeans it´s actively scanning your machine\n\n104\n00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:10.370\nto try to prevent things from getting\nin your machine beforehand, all right?\n\n105\n00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.420\nThis allows you to find things\nafter the fact, all right?\n\n106\n00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.985\nBecause sometimes what happens is your\napplication, or viruses that run on your\n\n107\n00:06:19.985 --> 00:06:25.140\nmachines, they know that you have built-in\napplications that check for them.\n\n108\n00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.650\nAnd they might try to\nlock those things down.\n\n109\n00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.730\nAll right, this is another way that\nafter you already have something on your\n\n110\n00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:37.050\nmachine, it'll give you an added level of,\nnot protection, protection is beforehand.\n\n111\n00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.093\nThis will give you an added level of\ncounter measures that you can run.\n\n112\n00:06:41.093 --> 00:06:46.479\nNow, when you do run the MRT here,\nnotice that it really isn't much different\n\n113\n00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:51.310\nthan the scans that we've already\nseen in Windows Defender, right?\n\n114\n00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.440\nI mean you've seen that,\nthey're pretty much the same.\n\n115\n00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.740\nAll right, notice that, quick,\n\n116\n00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.910\nscans the areas most likely to\ncontain malicious software.\n\n117\n00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.740\nSame thing that we've seen in\nWindows Defender, we're kinda going over\n\n118\n00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:06.680\nterritory that we've already charted,\nall right?\n\n119\n00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.870\nFull scan,\ndoes exactly what it sounds like, right?\n\n120\n00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.380\nYou guys and girls out there,\nyou're smart.\n\n121\n00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.740\nFull scan scans everything.\n\n122\n00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.750\nCustom scan, all right?\n\n123\n00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:17.850\nThis is where I love the definition\nbecause you can see exactly what custom\n\n124\n00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:18.550\nscans do.\n\n125\n00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:20.750\nAnd it's the same thing that\napplies to Windows Defender,\n\n126\n00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.090\nnotice, in addition to a quick scan.\n\n127\n00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.600\nSo, just like Windows Defender,\nit's going to perform a quick scan,\n\n128\n00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.800\nlook at those common areas that\nmalicious software is known to reside.\n\n129\n00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.900\nBut then it's also going to say hey,\n\n130\n00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.460\nyou got any user-specified locations,\ndirectories, folders, if you will,\n\n131\n00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.810\ndirectories, folders, same thing,\nthat you want to add in the scan?\n\n132\n00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.530\nWell if you choose this\nwe'll let you go ahead and\n\n133\n00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:43.280\nwe will let you choose the folder.\n\n134\n00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:48.211\nI could say hey, well maybe I wanna\ngo ahead and select an entire drive.\n\n135\n00:07:48.211 --> 00:07:51.710\nI can select an entire drive, that's fine.\n\n136\n00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:53.575\nAnd I can choose Next, all right?\n\n137\n00:07:53.575 --> 00:07:55.723\nAnd it's going to go through scanning,\nright?\n\n138\n00:07:55.723 --> 00:07:59.681\nAnd you can see that it\nreally isn't taking too long.\n\n139\n00:07:59.681 --> 00:08:04.054\nNow, Zach, you've asked me some great\nquestions in some other things that we've\n\n140\n00:08:04.054 --> 00:08:08.220\ndone, like for instance, when we're\nscanning errors in a large drive.\n\n141\n00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.960\nWe've talked about formatting,\ndoing not the Quick Format, but doing that\n\n142\n00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.870\nCheck Disk across the format\nbefore you actually go ahead and\n\n143\n00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:18.730\napply the file system, right?\n\n144\n00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:23.570\nAnd you said, well it's a three terabyte\ndrive, it could take a while, right?\n\n145\n00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.570\nWe joked around before-\n&gt;&gt; Have a cup of coffee and a sandwich.\n\n146\n00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:27.420\n&gt;&gt; That's right, coffee and\n\n147\n00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:31.592\na sandwich, come back and\nhopefully it's before the 2:30 crash.\n\n148\n00:08:31.592 --> 00:08:32.711\nThis is the same thing, right?\n\n149\n00:08:32.711 --> 00:08:35.620\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nsteal your thunder and let you know.\n\n150\n00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:38.547\nCuz I've got my psychic\nabilities here that yes,\n\n151\n00:08:38.547 --> 00:08:42.528\nthis would take a long time if you do\na full scan on a very large drive.\n\n152\n00:08:42.528 --> 00:08:46.230\nAnd even more so\nnot on an empty drive, right?\n\n153\n00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:47.750\nOn a drive that has a lot of data.\n\n154\n00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:51.220\nSo just because the drive size is large,\nhas a large capacity, doesn't necessarily\n\n155\n00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.350\nmean it's gonna take a while if you've\ngot a lot of empty space on that drive.\n\n156\n00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:59.820\nHowever, [LAUGH] If you've got\na lot of data on that drive,\n\n157\n00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.570\ncoffee break and a sandwich,\njust like Zach said.\n\n158\n00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:03.220\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; It could take a while.\n\n159\n00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.210\nAll right, notice, thank goodness.\n\n160\n00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.470\nNo malicious software was detected.\n\n161\n00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:12.756\nOr maybe if it was right here live in the\nshow, maybe I need to rethink my career.\n\n162\n00:09:12.756 --> 00:09:14.880\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n163\n00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.750\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n164\n00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.410\n&gt;&gt; Hey you never know when, right?\n\n165\n00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:19.530\nNotice we can view the scan results here?\n\n166\n00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:24.670\nAnd what I like here is they kind of give\nyou an idea of what it's looking for.\n\n167\n00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:26.730\nAll right, notice the term malware again.\n\n168\n00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.480\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Notice all of these different things\n\n169\n00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.310\nthat it looks for, all right.\n\n170\n00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:33.670\n&gt;&gt; Well.\n\n171\n00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:38.320\nThis is a built-in\ncollection of definitions,\n\n172\n00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.760\nif you will, and\nthey're constantly adding to the list.\n\n173\n00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.670\nAnd that's another reason you always wanna\ngo out to the Microsoft Download Center,\n\n174\n00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:49.260\npull down a new version of of the MRT.\n\n175\n00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.260\nOr run your Windows Update.\n\n176\n00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:56.710\nIf you run your Windows Update and\nyou include things like optional updates.\n\n177\n00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:02.540\nIt'll include an updated version of\nthe malicious software removal toolkit.\n\n178\n00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.660\nNow you might say well Wes you just\nsaid that if you update it doesn't\n\n179\n00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:06.950\nupdate the definitions?\n\n180\n00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:10.550\nNo be careful on what I mean is that\n\n181\n00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:15.570\nyou don't get this piece meal definition\nupdate like you do in Defender.\n\n182\n00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:20.090\nWhen you do an update, and\nit updates MRT, it discards the whole\n\n183\n00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:23.840\nentire old application purges it and\ninstalls the new one, right?\n\n184\n00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.490\nDoes that make sense?\n\n185\n00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:25.890\nIt's a lot different, right?\n\n186\n00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:29.180\nWindows Defender updates\nits definition database.\n\n187\n00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.000\nIts Spyware database.\n\n188\n00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.740\nWindows Defender itself isn't thrown\nout of the operating system and\n\n189\n00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.290\na new version of\nWindows Defender installed.\n\n190\n00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:39.430\n&gt;&gt; So\nyou're saying MRT is like Sherlock Holmes.\n\n191\n00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:42.520\nIt goes through and\nit takes a look at everything.\n\n192\n00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:47.460\nLet's say it found something that was\nmalicious, then what's the next step?\n\n193\n00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:48.890\n&gt;&gt; Great question.\n\n194\n00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:52.210\nAt this point it's gonna go through\na quarantine process, right?\n\n195\n00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:55.440\nAnd you're gonna do just like\nyou would in Windows Defender is\n\n196\n00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.200\nwhere you quarantine it and\nyou remove it, all right.\n\n197\n00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:05.070\nOr if it happens to be what we call\na false positive, false positive right?\n\n198\n00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.640\nSo you have what are known\nas true positives and\n\n199\n00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.430\nfalse positive, you have true\nnegatives and false negatives.\n\n200\n00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:13.960\nAll right, when we talk about that\ntake of true, correctly identified.\n\n201\n00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.970\nThink of false, is incorrectly identified.\n\n202\n00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:21.140\nA positive is malicious software,\na negative is benign,\n\n203\n00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:21.990\nit's not malicious at all.\n\n204\n00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.600\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right.\n\n205\n00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:27.760\n&gt;&gt; So, if we say false positive,\nfalse, incorrectly identified.\n\n206\n00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.740\nPositive, malicious software.\n\n207\n00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.780\nIncorrectly identified as a malicious\npiece of software is a false\n\n208\n00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.130\npositive, right.\n\n209\n00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:34.780\nYou could flag it.\n\n210\n00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:38.440\nYou could say, hey, MRT thank you,\nbut I'm aware of this file.\n\n211\n00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:42.620\nAnd maybe I'm a person that's\ndeveloping any virus software.\n\n212\n00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:46.860\nWell I'm gonna have to have a piece of\na virus on my computer in order to kinda\n\n213\n00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.200\ntest my software, right?\n\n214\n00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.660\nSo what you might say is exclude\nthat from the list too so\n\n215\n00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.000\nyou can perform the same\ntype of functions here.\n\n216\n00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.110\nBut if it goes through and it scans, and\n\n217\n00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:59.060\nit doesn't find anything in this list\nwell, here hopefully it doesn't.\n\n218\n00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.340\nNo malicious software was detected, right.\n\n219\n00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:08.950\nSo, malicious software removal toolkit,\nagain largely hasn't changed.\n\n220\n00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:09.900\nIn fact, this is the Windows 10.\n\n221\n00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:13.140\nLet me show you here,\nbefore we move on here.\n\n222\n00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:18.060\nLet's bump over to our\nWindows 8.1 machine, and\n\n223\n00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:21.220\nwe will not log in with that password.\n\n224\n00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.080\nWe'll try the right password.\n\n225\n00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:28.140\nWe'll go ahead and\nget to our modern UI here start screen and\n\n226\n00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:33.030\nI'll type mrt and you'll notice the same\nthing, little icon that comes up.\n\n227\n00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:36.950\nAnd when this launches, again, it could\ntake a second in not only triggering\n\n228\n00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:39.520\nthe UAC if it's the first\ntime it's launched up.\n\n229\n00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:46.250\nBut notice that, boy it really hasn't\nchanged and this machine is up to date.\n\n230\n00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:48.390\nNotice February 2018.\n\n231\n00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:50.090\nThis almost goes through\na monthly update so\n\n232\n00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:51.710\nactually this one might\nstill be out of date too.\n\n233\n00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:53.650\nThey might have one for March as well.\n\n234\n00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:58.670\nSo they're constantly updating\nthis entire piece of software.\n\n235\n00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:01.795\nAnd again,\nyou can see nothing changes, right.\n\n236\n00:13:01.795 --> 00:13:03.820\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; That interface has stayed the same for\n\n237\n00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:04.830\na very long time.\n\n238\n00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:08.950\nSo just keep in mind when they're updating\nit it doesn't mean that they're updating\n\n239\n00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:09.880\nthe interface at all.\n\n240\n00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:14.450\nMaking it pretty like they do when they\nchange, release new operating systems.\n\n241\n00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:17.960\nThey're just keeping that engine\nunderneath constantly updated and\n\n242\n00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.510\nahead of all the hackers, all right.\n\n243\n00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:20.407\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n244\n00:13:20.407 --> 00:13:21.090\n&gt;&gt; Attackers if you will.\n\n245\n00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:25.300\nCuz Hackers aren't bad it's attackers,\nif you will, that are bad.\n\n246\n00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.070\n&gt;&gt; The bad actors.\n\n247\n00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.500\n&gt;&gt; Very good, that's right,\nyour threat actors.\n\n248\n00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.720\nAll right, now the last thing that we've\ngot to kind of round off here with our UAC\n\n249\n00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:37.320\nand anit-virus they do put services\nin general in here all right?\n\n250\n00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.050\nAnd Zach and\n\n251\n00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:43.160\nI we've talked Indirectly about services\nI know through this entire series, right?\n\n252\n00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.470\nSo what is a service?\n\n253\n00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:47.170\nA service is really a process\nthat runs in the background.\n\n254\n00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:50.840\nAnd a lot of times, majority of the time,\nwe don't even see it.\n\n255\n00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.330\nWe don't interact with it.\n\n256\n00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.510\nWe don't even really know that it's there,\nright?\n\n257\n00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:55.920\nUnlike an application, right?\n\n258\n00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:56.480\nLet me show you.\n\n259\n00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.610\nSo we were just launching MRT, right?\n\n260\n00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:07.590\nMRT is an application and it runs its\nprocesses but, I initiate it, I launch it.\n\n261\n00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:09.630\nI interact with it, all right?\n\n262\n00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:12.960\nWell, in the background what about,\n\n263\n00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.670\nI don't know what about the functionality\nthat allows me to print?\n\n264\n00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:19.092\nWell that's a service that provides that.\n\n265\n00:14:19.092 --> 00:14:21.130\nAll right when I do a control P or\n\n266\n00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:26.470\nI choose the option to\nprint something all right?\n\n267\n00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:31.410\nWell that's all I chose, how did\nthat operation actually get handled?\n\n268\n00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:33.930\nBy a process that's\nrunning in the background\n\n269\n00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:36.470\nassisting the window's operating\nsystem in the print process right?\n\n270\n00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:38.630\nAnd we can actually see that if I Dive.\n\n271\n00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:40.950\nThere's a couple of different\nways that you can do this.\n\n272\n00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:42.970\nAnd we've used computer management before.\n\n273\n00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:44.440\nI can do this in computer management.\n\n274\n00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:49.765\nBut let me go to the start screen and just\nshow you that you also have services.msc.\n\n275\n00:14:49.765 --> 00:14:51.930\nAnd it's not service.\n\n276\n00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:52.940\nI did that singular.\n\n277\n00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:53.590\nIt's services.\n\n278\n00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:55.600\nThat's why it didn't show up.\n\n279\n00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.550\nRight?\n\n280\n00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:59.670\nAnd you get these little icon gear icon,\nall right.\n\n281\n00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.620\nAnd yes our user account control comes up.\n\n282\n00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:06.200\nAnd now we have what's known as\nthe services console, right?\n\n283\n00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.520\nNow our services console gives us\n\n284\n00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.320\nan idea of all the services that\nare present on this machine.\n\n285\n00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:16.600\nNow that doesn't mean that they're\nrunning, and I'll get to that in a second.\n\n286\n00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.290\nBut if you ever want to find\na service you can actually click and\n\n287\n00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:21.920\nthen hover over the name\ncolumn header at the top.\n\n288\n00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.880\nAnd type the first letter of\nthe service that you're looking for.\n\n289\n00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:29.130\nSo I typed the letter P here and\nnotice that we have Print Spooler.\n\n290\n00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:32.550\nAnd if I select this in Services\nhere you're gonna notice\n\n291\n00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:36.660\nthis service spools the print job and\nhandles the interaction with the printer.\n\n292\n00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:41.050\nYou turn this service off,\nyou won't be able to print.\n\n293\n00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:42.780\nI didn't turn this on, right?\n\n294\n00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.130\nThat's the services.\n\n295\n00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:47.680\nThese are background\nprocesses that are happening.\n\n296\n00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:51.000\nAnd they're going on\nallowing us to perform.\n\n297\n00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.721\nFunctionalities in the operating systems.\n\n298\n00:15:52.721 --> 00:15:56.427\nSome of these services are used by the\ncore functionality of the operating system\n\n299\n00:15:56.427 --> 00:15:57.254\nitself, right?\n\n300\n00:15:57.254 --> 00:15:58.611\nI'll give you one here too.\n\n301\n00:15:58.611 --> 00:16:02.792\nRemote procedure call, we call it RPC.\n\n302\n00:16:02.792 --> 00:16:04.910\nAnd I had to make sure\nthat I have the right one.\n\n303\n00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:06.380\nOkay, yeah, just RPC.\n\n304\n00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:07.540\nI don't need the locator.\n\n305\n00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.370\nRemote procedure call.\n\n306\n00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:14.400\nRPC is interesting because this is what\ntells hey, does the local machine execute\n\n307\n00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:18.120\na command, or does the remote\ncomputer execute a command?\n\n308\n00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.680\nSo if I'm connected to Zach's machine for\nmaybe administrative purposes, he's like,\n\n309\n00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.860\nhey, Wes, something is going on here.\n\n310\n00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.300\nI'm like, Zach, let me go ahead and\n\n311\n00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.290\nconnect to your Event Viewer\nover the network.\n\n312\n00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:30.460\nAnd then if say I wanna\nexpand that to category.\n\n313\n00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:34.160\nWell, is that my computer that expands\nout the category or is it his computer?\n\n314\n00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.560\nIn this case, it's a remote connection.\n\n315\n00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.350\nAnd our PC says, no, Zach,\nyour computer has to take care of that.\n\n316\n00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:42.230\nIt is a very important thing.\n\n317\n00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:46.390\nAnd it handles communications with things\nlike our calm registrations objects.\n\n318\n00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:50.470\nNow I wanna talk a little bit about\n\n319\n00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:55.310\nthe fact that services also\nsometimes rely on other services.\n\n320\n00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:57.820\nRPC's gonna be the one here, and\nthis is why I like this one.\n\n321\n00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:58.370\nAnd those.\n\n322\n00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.290\nThat necessity rely on another service to\n\n323\n00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:06.220\nperform this service's functionality\nis what's known as a dependency.\n\n324\n00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:14.170\nZach is my host, I don't own you by\nany means, but we work a lot together.\n\n325\n00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:15.360\nI depend on him.\n\n326\n00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:19.350\nI rely on him to host these shows and\nhelp us make him so great.\n\n327\n00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:20.150\nThat's a dependency.\n\n328\n00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:23.750\nWell, think of that analogy,\nI've got a service here.\n\n329\n00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:24.700\n&gt;&gt; I'm blushing now.\n\n330\n00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:25.655\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n331\n00:17:25.655 --> 00:17:27.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; We've got to call makeup and\n\n332\n00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.540\nwardrobe here to get some of\nthe red off his forehead.\n\n333\n00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:34.130\nBut if you think about it, if I've got\na service that's running on this machine.\n\n334\n00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:38.880\nBut it needs to rely on\nthe functionality of another service for\n\n335\n00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.570\nit's operation, that's a dependency.\n\n336\n00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:43.310\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; I can't shoot shows,\n\n337\n00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:46.570\nI mean, we say that in relation,\nbut I cannot shoot these shows, and\n\n338\n00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.720\nI certanly can't shoot them as well,\nif Zach's not here.\n\n339\n00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.130\nI depend on him.\n\n340\n00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.980\nThe same thing you have in your operating\nsystems when you have services that depend\n\n341\n00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:54.850\non other services.\n\n342\n00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:58.321\nAnd you can see that the whole time I've\nbeen saying this out there, we got some\n\n343\n00:17:58.321 --> 00:18:01.898\nsharp cowd there that was saying yeah,\nWes, we see the dependencies tab there,\n\n344\n00:18:01.898 --> 00:18:03.204\njust, Just switch-\n&gt;&gt; Just click on it.\n\n345\n00:18:03.204 --> 00:18:05.980\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n[LAUGH] The dependencies tab shows you\n\n346\n00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:10.210\nthat you have some services that\nare relying on other services.\n\n347\n00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:15.100\nOr in this case you have\nsome services that depend on\n\n348\n00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.420\nthe one that you're currently looking at.\n\n349\n00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:23.550\nThe top list is that RPC\ndepends on those services.\n\n350\n00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:26.310\nNotice it says that this service depends\non the following system components.\n\n351\n00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:27.870\nI need to have these present.\n\n352\n00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:32.665\nBut what is relying on RPC?\n\n353\n00:18:32.665 --> 00:18:35.140\n[LAUGH] Well, that's the second list.\n\n354\n00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:39.150\nAnd if I was to take time to expand all\nthese out, you would probably say that\n\n355\n00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:43.090\nsome of them don't expand, but\nall I gotta do is really scroll.\n\n356\n00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:47.350\nJust about everything in the entire\noperating system relies on RPC.\n\n357\n00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:55.050\nAnd that is important to understand, and\nwhy is that important to understand.\n\n358\n00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:57.660\nWell that comes back to the next concept\n\n359\n00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.700\nthat we have to talk about\ncalled startup types.\n\n360\n00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.300\nWhat is a start-up type?\n\n361\n00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.190\nWell, I want you to think\nof the term start-up.\n\n362\n00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:05.110\nWhat does it mean?\n\n363\n00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:07.315\nIt means your computer is going online,\nright?\n\n364\n00:19:07.315 --> 00:19:11.630\nStarting-up your computer is exactly what\nit, means exactly what it sounds like.\n\n365\n00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:13.100\nNow, question.\n\n366\n00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:19.470\nIs this service going to be there at\nthe boot process when it starts up?\n\n367\n00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:21.149\nDo we initiate that service?\n\n368\n00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:23.280\nDo we wait?\n\n369\n00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:27.420\nDo we wait for the boot process to finish\nso we have a nice optimized boot process?\n\n370\n00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:33.640\nBecause maybe this service isn't\nrequired to boot the operating system?\n\n371\n00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.390\nBut we say, wait til you boot\nthe operating system then go ahead and\n\n372\n00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:38.700\nlaunch it.\n\n373\n00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.320\nIt kind of optimizes your boot process.\n\n374\n00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:46.040\nOr maybe I want it to\nbe manually launched,\n\n375\n00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:49.160\nwhich means I wanna wait until\nan application needs it.\n\n376\n00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.640\nSo set it on manual and\n\n377\n00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:53.010\nwhen that application needs it,\ntrigger the service to come on.\n\n378\n00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:57.060\nOr maybe I want it to be disabled.\n\n379\n00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.400\nNow here's the problem.\n\n380\n00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:02.410\nWith that startup type disabled,\nthat's where dependencies come into play.\n\n381\n00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:06.750\nBecause if I disable a service and\nthat service is disabled, but\n\n382\n00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:10.130\nother services depend on it,\nyou have to be careful.\n\n383\n00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:14.130\nYou will cripple all the other\nservices that depend on that service.\n\n384\n00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:15.780\nLet me show you what I\nmean here real quick.\n\n385\n00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:19.280\nIn fact, let's go back to\nour print spooler service.\n\n386\n00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.650\nCuz there are other services,\na couple if I can remember.\n\n387\n00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:26.180\nIt's been a while since I looked at\nthe dependencies on print spooler cuz we\n\n388\n00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.400\npretty much depend on\nthe print spooler itself.\n\n389\n00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.120\nYeah, the two.\n\n390\n00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:35.450\nNope, this is the one that I wanted This\nservice depends on two other services.\n\n391\n00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:36.720\nI was close.\nI just had it backwards,\n\n392\n00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:40.010\nbut notice the following system\ncomponents depend on this service.\n\n393\n00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:42.980\nIf I disable the print spooler,\nI can't send a fax.\n\n394\n00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.080\nNot that that's so important much,\nanymore, [LAUGH] but I can't send a fax.\n\n395\n00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:50.210\nBut that breaks another functionality\nof the operating system, right?\n\n396\n00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:54.250\nSo we got to be careful when we change how\n\n397\n00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:57.940\nthese services start up, or\nmaybe they don't start up.\n\n398\n00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:58.876\nSo where do we see that?\n\n399\n00:20:58.876 --> 00:21:01.543\nWell on the general tab\nhere you'll notice that,\n\n400\n00:21:01.543 --> 00:21:04.858\nnotice I have the name of the service,\nthat's service name.\n\n401\n00:21:04.858 --> 00:21:09.380\nWhat is the display name,\nthere's the difference.\n\n402\n00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.140\nThis is the actual executable list,\n\n403\n00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:15.670\nthe application name is spoolsv.exe,\nthat's spoolerservice.exe.\n\n404\n00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:17.800\nWell that's not what it\nsays here on the list.\n\n405\n00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.520\nOn the list display name is\nthe print splooler service.\n\n406\n00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.488\nI can see where it runs, C:\\ right?\n\n407\n00:21:24.488 --> 00:21:29.890\nWindows\\system32\\spoolssv.exe, and\n\n408\n00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:32.620\nI can also see that the start\nup type is actually disabled.\n\n409\n00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:35.900\nSo at this point,\nthis service isn't gonna run.\n\n410\n00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:37.240\nAt this point, I couldn't print and\n\n411\n00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.100\nI couldn't send a fax because\nof the dependency, right?\n\n412\n00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.390\nWell, there's other startup types.\n\n413\n00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:44.120\nWhat are these other startup types?\n\n414\n00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.960\nWell, let's talk about\nAutomatic (Delayed Start).\n\n415\n00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.560\nThat's optimizing your boot process.\n\n416\n00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.440\nBecause the print spooler\nservice isn't crucial for\n\n417\n00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:54.400\ngetting my operating system install.\n\n418\n00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:54.970\nNot install,\n\n419\n00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:59.820\nbut online bootstrap started up I might\nsay you know what, just delay it.\n\n420\n00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:03.990\nI want you to automatically turn this on\nbut wait til we finish the boot process.\n\n421\n00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:07.233\nThat's one of the things that they changed\nin Windows 7 is automatically delayed\n\n422\n00:22:07.233 --> 00:22:07.846\nstart came up.\n\n423\n00:22:07.846 --> 00:22:10.217\nBecause the resource hog Vista was and\n\n424\n00:22:10.217 --> 00:22:15.440\nhow long it took to boot everything\nbecause of how much resources that needed.\n\n425\n00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.760\nThey said, if it's not crucial to the boot\nprocess but you wanna automatically start\n\n426\n00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.100\nit, we'll give you another\noption that delayed start.\n\n427\n00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:25.250\nThese other three have been around for\na long time, automatic?\n\n428\n00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.649\nGuys and gals out there,\nit's exactly what it sounds like.\n\n429\n00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:34.420\nIt's gonna become one of those\nwell after the system drivers and\n\n430\n00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:36.950\nthose low level system services startup.\n\n431\n00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:41.090\nWe're gonna launch this to automatically\nevery time the computer boots up.\n\n432\n00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:42.810\nManual it's exactly what it says.\n\n433\n00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:47.470\nWait till an application triggers it or\nmaybe even you need to start it.\n\n434\n00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:50.810\nAnd then disable it's current state.\n\n435\n00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:55.160\nThat it was, says I'm not gonna\nstart it even if you need it.\n\n436\n00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:59.320\nSo, we can do all of that\nright here in this list.\n\n437\n00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:04.480\nLet me go ahead, and let me change\nthis back to what the default is.\n\n438\n00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.650\nBy the way, the print spooler is,\nby default,\n\n439\n00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:09.310\nis set to automatic whether you need it or\nnot.\n\n440\n00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:11.680\nWhether you have a printer\nattached to your machine.\n\n441\n00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:14.440\nThis is great because with the plug and\nplay service that's back there.\n\n442\n00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:18.080\nOnce you plug a machine in and it goes\nthrough installing the drivers through\n\n443\n00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.570\nplug and play hey, you're ready to print.\n\n444\n00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:24.210\nI don't have to remember I didn't\nturn the print spooler service on.\n\n445\n00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:27.120\nBut yeah.\n\n446\n00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.850\nAnd sometimes you have\nto interact with these.\n\n447\n00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:30.340\nLet me go ahead and apply this setting.\n\n448\n00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:32.930\nAnd I want you to notice something,\n\n449\n00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:36.540\ncuz now we now have what's\nknown as the service status.\n\n450\n00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.690\nAnd when we talk about the service status,\nwhat is the current state of the service?\n\n451\n00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:42.920\nJust because of the start up type\nyou can see is now set to automatic,\n\n452\n00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.280\nit didn't change the current\nstate of the service.\n\n453\n00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.480\nDoes that make sense?\n\n454\n00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It didn't change it, right?\n\n455\n00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:50.450\nJust cuz I said I wanted to start it shen\n\n456\n00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:53.660\nthe computer boots up doesn't mean that\nmean it's actually started right now.\n\n457\n00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.379\nThat's when the start option comes in.\n\n458\n00:23:55.379 --> 00:23:59.043\nAnd you can see it takes a second there,\nthat's one is a fairly fast.\n\n459\n00:23:59.043 --> 00:24:02.463\nLet me go ahead and zoom in here so\nthat you can see the stop We stop it,\n\n460\n00:24:02.463 --> 00:24:04.683\ntakes a second it's attempting to stop it.\n\n461\n00:24:04.683 --> 00:24:06.360\nStop the service.\n\n462\n00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.175\nWe start the service just that fast.\n\n463\n00:24:08.175 --> 00:24:08.760\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n464\n00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.240\n&gt;&gt; Fairly easy to work with\nthe services in the background.\n\n465\n00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:15.880\nNow one of the last things that I wanna\ntalk about, last few minutes that we have\n\n466\n00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:19.150\nhere is I wanna talk about\nservice accounts, all right.\n\n467\n00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:24.270\nService accounts,\nlet's go to this column right here.\n\n468\n00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:28.990\nThis last column is where you can see\nsome of the service accounts, all right.\n\n469\n00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:31.130\nSo what is a service account?\n\n470\n00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:33.950\nA service account,\nit'd be one of those ones where we say,\n\n471\n00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:36.765\nwell it's a service, and\nit's an account, no.\n\n472\n00:24:36.765 --> 00:24:39.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's get a little more specific on\n\n473\n00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:40.630\nthat one.\n\n474\n00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:44.790\nThere are certain functions\nthat need to happen,\n\n475\n00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:48.750\ncertain operations that need to\nhappen within your operating system\n\n476\n00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:51.820\nthat you don't interact with,\nas an individual, as a user.\n\n477\n00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.290\nI don't interact with it.\n\n478\n00:24:54.420 --> 00:25:00.440\nBut it still needs to have some kind of\ninteraction between a user account and\n\n479\n00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.650\nthe service to make it run.\n\n480\n00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:04.110\nSo we have what are known\nas service accounts.\n\n481\n00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:08.120\nService accounts, there are well actually\nthere are three different types here.\n\n482\n00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:11.400\nThere's local system,\nlocal service and network service.\n\n483\n00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.840\nHere's our local system.\n\n484\n00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:17.950\nAnd then there's network service and\nI don't see, there it is, local service.\n\n485\n00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:20.260\nI didn't scroll all the way back up,\nright local service.\n\n486\n00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:25.900\nAnd what these service accounts do,\n\n487\n00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:29.130\nis they're actually running these\nservices in the background.\n\n488\n00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:31.900\nThey're managing the communication\nof the operating system and\n\n489\n00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.500\nthe functionality of the operating system.\n\n490\n00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.600\nAnd the context I'm gonna count,\njust like a user does, but\n\n491\n00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.430\nit becomes transparent to the end user,\nand\n\n492\n00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:42.820\nWindows is managing itself through these\nservice accounts in the background, right?\n\n493\n00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:44.270\nSo do know that.\n\n494\n00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:46.080\nWe got the local service.\n\n495\n00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:48.970\nWe've got the local system\nas well as network service.\n\n496\n00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:51.950\nAnd if you look at some of the network\nservices that we have, for\n\n497\n00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:56.470\ninstance, DNS Client is in the list,\nyeah, it should be.\n\n498\n00:25:56.470 --> 00:26:01.052\nThere it is, DNS Client for the,\nand you know what's really cool?\n\n499\n00:26:01.052 --> 00:26:06.250\nThis whole thing is set up with\nthe automatic triggered and\n\n500\n00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:07.400\nI'll show you that right here.\n\n501\n00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.300\nSo triggered start, all right?\n\n502\n00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:12.790\nIt's automatic but it's a triggered\nstart which is kinda interesting.\n\n503\n00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:15.280\nSo the network service is going to say,\n\n504\n00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:19.030\nall right I see a DNS\nrequest coming through.\n\n505\n00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:24.550\nOur DNS client is trying to resolve\nthat name to that IP address.\n\n506\n00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:28.460\nI, network service,\nwill do this in the background for you.\n\n507\n00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.770\nWe talk about DNS a lot.\n\n508\n00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:34.715\nWhen I need to map a name like\n\n509\n00:26:34.715 --> 00:26:39.930\nwww.itpro.tv to its IP address so\nthat we can connect to the web server.\n\n510\n00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:45.050\nMy computer doesn't know where\nthe IP address of www.ITPro.tv is.\n\n511\n00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:47.040\nSo it sends a DNS request\nto a name server and\n\n512\n00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.649\nsays hey, can you find this name's IP\naddress, does the name resolution.\n\n513\n00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:57.120\nBut all I did was open the web browser and\ntype the name into the web browser.\n\n514\n00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:00.510\nIn the background this service\naccount said, I see that DNS query,\n\n515\n00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:01.740\nlet me go ahead and wrap that up.\n\n516\n00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:04.480\nLet me look at the properties,\nthe network adapter, okay.\n\n517\n00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:07.480\nI see the IP address of the DNS server,\nlet me send it on its way.\n\n518\n00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.160\nAnd it did that for me.\n\n519\n00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.220\nI didn't have to do any of that,\nit's all transparent to me.\n\n520\n00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:13.990\nAnd that's the purpose of the service\naccounts is that they handle\n\n521\n00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:18.000\nthe interactions that happen within\nthe operating system on behalf of\n\n522\n00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.310\nthe operating system and really on\nyour behalf as well too, if you will,\n\n523\n00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:26.290\nbecause all I did was type the URL and\nit mapped\n\n524\n00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:28.979\nit to its IP address in the background\nvia this network service account.\n\n525\n00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.090\nSo the service accounts are important.\n\n526\n00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:33.220\nSo do keep that in mind,\n\n527\n00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:36.910\nkeep in mind your service startup types,\nand service dependencies.\n\n528\n00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:40.850\nRemember, before you disable a service\nin Windows, check the dependencies tab.\n\n529\n00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:43.165\nMake sure you understand\nwhat you're disabling.\n\n530\n00:27:43.165 --> 00:27:45.560\nCuz I've done this before.\n\n531\n00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:48.805\nIn thinking that you're fixing something\nyou're fixing it till it's broke.\n\n532\n00:27:48.805 --> 00:27:51.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or I could say in thinking that you're\n\n533\n00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:54.580\noptimizing something,\nnot even really fixing it.\n\n534\n00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:57.690\nIt might not be broke, so\nwhy fix it till it is?\n\n535\n00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:01.300\nIt might be one of those things\nwhere you think you're optimizing.\n\n536\n00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:02.720\nI don't need this service.\n\n537\n00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.540\nI don't.\nHonestly, and this is truthfully,\n\n538\n00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:05.420\nall joking aside.\n\n539\n00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:06.710\nI don't need the principle of service.\n\n540\n00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:08.188\nI can disable it, it's fine, I don't care.\n\n541\n00:28:08.188 --> 00:28:11.650\nIt's not gonna bother me\nuntil I plug a printer in or\n\n542\n00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:13.080\nI go to connect to a printer.\n\n543\n00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:16.220\nSo if I disable that, that's fine, but\nI also gotta keep in mind that I can't\n\n544\n00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:18.840\nfax anymore and I don't need to do that\neither too, so it doesn't matter to me.\n\n545\n00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:23.320\nThere are some of these services that\nif you start messing around with them,\n\n546\n00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.510\nyou could start to cripple\nyour operating system.\n\n547\n00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:26.800\nSo be aware of them,\n\n548\n00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:30.940\ndo your research, know the startup types,\nknow how you can start and\n\n549\n00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:34.440\nstop a service and definitely know those\nservice accounts for the 7TA exam.\n\n550\n00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:37.291\n&gt;&gt; And do not fix something\nuntil it´s broken as Wes said.\n\n551\n00:28:37.291 --> 00:28:38.584\nConfiguring UAC and\n\n552\n00:28:38.584 --> 00:28:43.440\nantivirus part 3, make sure you see\nall the parts, part 1, 2 and 3.\n\n553\n00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.300\nYou'll be glad you did and\n\n554\n00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:47.110\nsee everything inside of\nthe windows OS fundamentals series.\n\n555\n00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:49.430\nAnd see everything inside\nthe course library too.\n\n556\n00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:52.520\nThere's thousands of videos there and\nthey're all designed to do one thing,\n\n557\n00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.250\nhelp you go further.\n\n558\n00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:56.550\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n559\n00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:58.400\nITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n560\n00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.090\nThanks

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:08.243\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.243 --> 00:00:11.717\n&gt;&gt; You're watcihng ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.717 --> 00:00:13.949\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n7\n00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:16.150\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n8\n00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.731\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, for this\nepisode of MTA Windows OS Fundamentals.\n\n9\n00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:24.013\nThe name of this episode is\nunderstanding file systems, the one and\n\n10\n00:00:24.013 --> 00:00:25.172\nonly Wes Bryan is here.\n\n11\n00:00:25.172 --> 00:00:26.741\nWes, good to see you and\nwork with you again.\n\n12\n00:00:26.741 --> 00:00:28.339\n&gt;&gt; Hey sir, thanks for having me back.\n\n13\n00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:30.651\nThat's right,\nwe're gonna be looking at, well,\n\n14\n00:00:30.651 --> 00:00:35.000\na logical structure that we apply to our\nstorage devices so that we can use them.\n\n15\n00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.744\nIn other episodes,\nwe had talked about storage devices, and\n\n16\n00:00:37.744 --> 00:00:41.253\nsome of the things you should be aware\nof when it comes to creating partitions.\n\n17\n00:00:41.253 --> 00:00:45.877\nApplying those file systems, but we\ndidn't really talk about the file systems\n\n18\n00:00:45.877 --> 00:00:50.639\nthemselves, and that's what we're gonna\nbe doing here inside of this episode,\n\n19\n00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:53.537\nand we really kinda have\nto step back a little bit,\n\n20\n00:00:53.537 --> 00:00:58.160\nand if this is the first time you maybe\nare going into IT, maybe you're not aware\n\n21\n00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.853\nabout how the measurements work when it\ncomes to file systems, and when you say,\n\n22\n00:01:02.853 --> 00:01:06.005\na large file we say a small file,\nwhat does that mean?\n\n23\n00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:07.400\nWhat is a small file?\n\n24\n00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.777\nWhat is a large file?\n\n25\n00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:14.072\nWell, we have to understand some of those\ndata measurement units in order to start\n\n26\n00:01:14.072 --> 00:01:19.455\nto talk about file systems after that, so\nlet's go ahead and let's dive right in.\n\n27\n00:01:19.455 --> 00:01:21.731\nNow I got a little chart here, and\n\n28\n00:01:21.731 --> 00:01:26.610\nwhat it does is just it basically\ngives you the data measurement units,\n\n29\n00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.944\nand you should be aware of this for,\njust general IT purposes.\n\n30\n00:01:30.944 --> 00:01:34.743\nNow it might not be something that\ncomes up on the exam, but it definitely\n\n31\n00:01:34.743 --> 00:01:39.047\nwill give you a good solid foundation for\njust basic storage in general.\n\n32\n00:01:39.047 --> 00:01:42.727\n&gt;&gt; When we look at the data measurement\nunits, we start out with a bit.\n\n33\n00:01:42.727 --> 00:01:44.339\nWell, what is a bit?\n\n34\n00:01:44.339 --> 00:01:48.501\nWell a bit, if you think about it,\nthat is a binary 1 or\n\n35\n00:01:48.501 --> 00:01:53.478\na binary 0, that is the smallest\ndata measurement unit we have,\n\n36\n00:01:53.478 --> 00:01:57.748\nbut then we move up we then get a byte,\nand what is a byte?\n\n37\n00:01:57.748 --> 00:02:03.336\nWell a byte takes eight of those binary\n1s or 0s and groups them together.\n\n38\n00:02:03.336 --> 00:02:04.816\nThat's eight bits.\n\n39\n00:02:04.816 --> 00:02:09.448\nNow, I will tell you that the rest of this\nlist is kind of easy to understand when\n\n40\n00:02:09.448 --> 00:02:11.427\nyou start to see that a kilobyte.\n\n41\n00:02:11.427 --> 00:02:18.257\nNow a kilobyte is 1024, it is 1,024 bytes.\n\n42\n00:02:18.257 --> 00:02:23.256\nThen as you move up, everything after that\nis also 1,024 of whatever the previous\n\n43\n00:02:23.256 --> 00:02:26.990\nmeasurement was, and\nthat might be a easy way to memorize it.\n\n44\n00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.437\nSo when we get into megabytes,\nright, what's a megabyte?\n\n45\n00:02:29.437 --> 00:02:34.869\nWell, a megabyte is 10 or 1,024 kilobytes.\n\n46\n00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:36.940\nMoving up the list, we get a gigabyte.\n\n47\n00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.170\nWell what's a gigabyte?\n\n48\n00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.029\nYou probably see in the pattern now,\nright,\n\n49\n00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:45.029\na gigabyte is 1,024 megabytes,\nand so on, and so forth.\n\n50\n00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:48.200\nWe get up to a terabyte,\nwhich you should know.\n\n51\n00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.362\nTerabyte, terabyte drive sizes,\nright, gonna happen, in fact,\n\n52\n00:02:53.362 --> 00:02:58.480\nwe've got a lot of terabyte\ndrives in storage devices today.\n\n53\n00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.694\nA terabyte is actually 1,024 gigabytes,\nand\n\n54\n00:03:02.694 --> 00:03:07.600\non the horizon,\nmaybe not right there yet, is a petabyte.\n\n55\n00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.306\nNow when we look at a petabyte, a petabyte\nis actually again 1,024 terabytes,\n\n56\n00:03:14.306 --> 00:03:17.930\nbut then you get into some\nof the crazy measurements.\n\n57\n00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.427\nExabyte, now exabytes, I'm not sure\nthat we're gonna see outside of cloud\n\n58\n00:03:22.427 --> 00:03:26.856\nstorage where they're aggregating a lot\nof drive space all together that we\n\n59\n00:03:26.856 --> 00:03:30.682\nmight not see an exabyte, but\nexabyte is 1,024 petabytes.\n\n60\n00:03:30.682 --> 00:03:35.725\nTo kind of give you an example of what\nan exabyte is, I think it was eight\n\n61\n00:03:35.725 --> 00:03:40.510\nexabytes that are about five years ago,\nthey said in a single day,\n\n62\n00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.514\nthat's how much data traverses the entire\nworld wide Internet, eight exabytes.\n\n63\n00:03:46.514 --> 00:03:48.710\nThat's a lot of information.\n\n64\n00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.323\nThat's a lot of data.\n\n65\n00:03:50.323 --> 00:03:54.860\nSo it is important to understand these\ndata measurement units when you decide\n\n66\n00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.648\nthat you are going to start working\nwith your operating system.\n\n67\n00:03:58.648 --> 00:04:01.682\n&gt;&gt; So, Wes, with all these measurements\nit seems like drives might be\n\n68\n00:04:01.682 --> 00:04:03.719\nmeasured differently, is that right or no?\n\n69\n00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:05.210\n&gt;&gt; That's interesting.\n\n70\n00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:10.186\nI think that's a marketing thing, because\nwhen we look at some of these sizes\n\n71\n00:04:10.186 --> 00:04:15.257\nthat we mentioned here, they're actually\non a base-two numbering system.\n\n72\n00:04:15.257 --> 00:04:17.900\nWell, why are they on\na Base-2 numbering system?\n\n73\n00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.805\nWell, that's because,\nif you look at computer's in binary.\n\n74\n00:04:21.805 --> 00:04:24.080\nBinary is Base-2, and what does that mean?\n\n75\n00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.933\nWell, there's only two possibilities,\na binary zero or a binary one.\n\n76\n00:04:27.933 --> 00:04:32.247\nSo to figure out these measurements, when\nwe say a kilobyte, we're actually talking\n\n77\n00:04:32.247 --> 00:04:35.862\nabout Base-2 numbering systems,\nand that's why it's 1,024.\n\n78\n00:04:35.862 --> 00:04:37.820\nWhy isn't it 1,000?\n\n79\n00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.690\nWell when we look at 1,000 right,\nwhat is 1,000?\n\n80\n00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.889\n1,000 is a Base-10 numbering system, and\n\n81\n00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.270\nthat's how the drives\nare actually marketed.\n\n82\n00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.546\nSo when they say, you have a terabyte of\ndata on your drive, it doesn't necessarily\n\n83\n00:04:49.546 --> 00:04:53.702\nmean that that's gonna line up to how much\nactual data that you have to store on that\n\n84\n00:04:53.702 --> 00:04:58.100\ndrive, because again, the drives are gonna\nbe measured in that Base-10 numbering\n\n85\n00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.318\nsystem, which they're telling you that\na terabyte is 1,000 gigabytes, and\n\n86\n00:05:02.318 --> 00:05:04.104\ntechnically, that isn't true.\n\n87\n00:05:04.104 --> 00:05:08.866\nYou might hear this term mebibyte, and\nmegabyte, and what they're doing is,\n\n88\n00:05:08.866 --> 00:05:13.580\na few years back there was a, and I can't\nthink of the standard organization.\n\n89\n00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.689\nThey were trying to bring these data\nmeasurement units more in line with\n\n90\n00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:20.712\nthe Base-2 numbering\nsystem that computers use.\n\n91\n00:05:20.712 --> 00:05:25.830\nSo they come up with two terms, and in\nfact, let me kind of show you what I mean.\n\n92\n00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.554\nYou might actually see this where\nyou'll see these abbreviated kilobyte,\n\n93\n00:05:30.554 --> 00:05:34.314\nis KB, and then you have, for\ninstance you have megabytes,\n\n94\n00:05:34.314 --> 00:05:37.366\nand you probably guessed there,\nZach, right?\n\n95\n00:05:37.366 --> 00:05:38.086\n&gt;&gt; MB.\n\n96\n00:05:38.086 --> 00:05:42.530\n&gt;&gt; MB, GB, TB, all the way,\nPB, all the way up, EB, right?\n\n97\n00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.794\nWell, that is actually a Base-10\nnumbering designation, and\n\n98\n00:05:47.794 --> 00:05:53.622\nI don't want you to worry about that\ntoo much, but you might see something\n\n99\n00:05:53.622 --> 00:05:58.886\nlike this, where you have a little i,\nand then you have a little m,\n\n100\n00:05:58.886 --> 00:06:03.970\nor a little i in there, but\nthis is a killibyte, and a megibyte.\n\n101\n00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.751\nWell, all this was was a-\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n102\n00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:06.328\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n103\n00:06:06.328 --> 00:06:13.299\nAll this was was a designation to kind of\nbring it in line and you've seen that MiB,\n\n104\n00:06:13.299 --> 00:06:18.568\nand what they're saying is\nthat it is literally 1,024.\n\n105\n00:06:18.568 --> 00:06:22.967\nI don't want you to worry about that for\nthis exam, but I do want you to know when\n\n106\n00:06:22.967 --> 00:06:26.833\nit comes to file systems, and\nsome of the data measurement units, so\n\n107\n00:06:26.833 --> 00:06:30.988\nthat when you see them you say,\nwell Wes, I see KB, I see MB, megabytes.\n\n108\n00:06:30.988 --> 00:06:34.760\nI see GB for gigabytes, but I also see\nthese ones with a little i in them.\n\n109\n00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.990\nWell, what does that mean, and again,\n\n110\n00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.570\nthat's where they're trying to\ndifferentiate between Base-10,\n\n111\n00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.630\nthat's a kilobyte, or a megabyte,\n\n112\n00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.710\nand you might see mebibyte, if you will,\nand that is just another designation.\n\n113\n00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.985\nI wouldn't worry about that for\nthe exam, but I would keep it in mind.\n\n114\n00:06:49.985 --> 00:06:52.293\nThat when you look at\nyour drive capacities,\n\n115\n00:06:52.293 --> 00:06:56.909\nyou might need to find out whether they're\ntalking about a Base-10 numbering system,\n\n116\n00:06:56.909 --> 00:07:00.330\nand most manufacturers are using\na Base-10 numbering system.\n\n117\n00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.750\nSo, and again that's why\nthere's a little mismatch.\n\n118\n00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.093\nYou say, well I got a one terabyte\ndrive on it, but when I looked at that\n\n119\n00:07:06.093 --> 00:07:09.232\ndrive capacity, it showed me that\nI have less than one terabyte.\n\n120\n00:07:09.232 --> 00:07:11.110\nWell, there's two things\nthat happen there.\n\n121\n00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.908\nAccording to the file\nsystem that you apply,\n\n122\n00:07:12.908 --> 00:07:14.526\nyou might have a little bit of overhead.\n\n123\n00:07:14.526 --> 00:07:16.508\nWhen you have a little bit of overhead,\n\n124\n00:07:16.508 --> 00:07:20.653\nit reduces the actual amount of capacity\nthat you have, and then further that with\n\n125\n00:07:20.653 --> 00:07:24.950\nthe fact that the measurements are [LAUGH]\nactually not really in line with Base-2.\n\n126\n00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:30.180\nSo little bit of a side road there,\nso definitely understand that.\n\n127\n00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.584\nNow the next thing that we have to\nunderstand, our storage measurement units.\n\n128\n00:07:33.584 --> 00:07:36.505\nNow you say, well [LAUGH] wait a second\nWes, we’ve got data measurement units,\n\n129\n00:07:36.505 --> 00:07:38.870\nwe have storage measurement units,\nwhat are we talking about?\n\n130\n00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.180\nWell, let me show you what I mean here.\n\n131\n00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.544\nAll right, when you store files,\n\n132\n00:07:42.544 --> 00:07:48.086\nregardless of the file system that you\nuse, when you store files on a hard drive,\n\n133\n00:07:48.086 --> 00:07:51.606\nthere are two units of\nmeasurements on that drive.\n\n134\n00:07:51.606 --> 00:07:54.045\nThere are what are known as sectors,\nall right, and\n\n135\n00:07:54.045 --> 00:07:55.831\nthere are what are known as clusters.\n\n136\n00:07:55.831 --> 00:07:58.449\nNow when we say a sector,\nwhat is a sector?\n\n137\n00:07:58.449 --> 00:08:04.840\nAll right, well, the sector is the\nsmallest measurement unit on a hard drive.\n\n138\n00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:09.250\nHowever, files don't use sectors,\nall right, they use clusters.\n\n139\n00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.866\nClusters is essentially\na group of sectors, right?\n\n140\n00:08:12.866 --> 00:08:14.704\nClusters group sectors together.\n\n141\n00:08:14.704 --> 00:08:17.160\nLet me show you what I mean by that,\nall right?\n\n142\n00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.787\nAnd we'll talk about these file\nsystems here coming up in a second.\n\n143\n00:08:19.787 --> 00:08:22.240\nWe don't wanna get ahead of ourselves,\nright?\n\n144\n00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.963\nBut when you look at a cluster, again,\nkeep in mind that the cluster, right,\n\n145\n00:08:27.963 --> 00:08:33.981\nis a grouping of these sectors, and that\nis important to understand, all right?\n\n146\n00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:36.994\nSectors again are grouped\ntogether in clusters.\n\n147\n00:08:36.994 --> 00:08:43.034\nThe smallest unit of storage again\nthat a file will use aren't sectors.\n\n148\n00:08:43.034 --> 00:08:46.231\nThey use clusters, all right,\nas their containers.\n\n149\n00:08:46.231 --> 00:08:51.360\nNow it is important to\nunderstand that let's say a file\n\n150\n00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.502\nis stored in, let me see one\nof the best ways to do this.\n\n151\n00:08:56.502 --> 00:09:03.776\nLet's say that with a file uses,\nlet's see if we can get all these here,\n\n152\n00:09:03.776 --> 00:09:07.841\nuses this much of a cluster, all right?\n\n153\n00:09:07.841 --> 00:09:12.087\nSo let's say that it stores its data,\noop, missed a couple there.\n\n154\n00:09:12.087 --> 00:09:15.500\nLet's go ahead and\nfill that in here real quick.\n\n155\n00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:21.098\nSo a file uses that much of a cluster,\nall right?\n\n156\n00:09:21.098 --> 00:09:23.030\nWhat happens to the rest of\nthe space in the cluster?\n\n157\n00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.660\nIt gets wasted.\n\n158\n00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:29.416\nFiles don't share clusters, and that's\nimportant to understand when it comes to\n\n159\n00:09:29.416 --> 00:09:32.112\nthe file systems that you apply\nto your drives, all right?\n\n160\n00:09:32.112 --> 00:09:38.230\nThe larger the cluster, all right,\nthere's a potential for waste.\n\n161\n00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:40.180\nNow, we'll talk a little bit\nmore about that coming up.\n\n162\n00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:45.990\nBut the larger the cluster size,\nthe more potential for wasted drive space.\n\n163\n00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:50.850\nHowever, the large clusters\nare very good if you have\n\n164\n00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:53.765\nlarge files on a storage device,\nvery large files.\n\n165\n00:09:53.765 --> 00:09:56.660\nBecause what that means is that the drive\ncontrol and the operating system,\n\n166\n00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:00.830\nthey don't need to search a lot of\nthese blocks to find their data.\n\n167\n00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:05.720\nSo it can lead to better performance,\nright, and that's a good\n\n168\n00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.440\nthing, right,\nthat it can lead to better performance.\n\n169\n00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.810\nBut with a larger cluster size,\nthere's a potential for more waste, right?\n\n170\n00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:18.450\nBecause if I'm using a larger\ncluster size, and again,\n\n171\n00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:19.860\nthe majority of my files are large.\n\n172\n00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:24.191\nBut I turn around and I put a small file\nin there, there's gonna be a lot of waste,\n\n173\n00:10:24.191 --> 00:10:24.851\nall right?\n\n174\n00:10:24.851 --> 00:10:29.280\nNow, the smaller cluster size,\nwhat's the benefit of that?\n\n175\n00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.777\nWell, the smaller cluster size is the fact\nthat smaller allocation units are better\n\n176\n00:10:33.777 --> 00:10:35.312\nfor smaller files, right?\n\n177\n00:10:35.312 --> 00:10:42.647\nIt means that what happens is,\nit results in less waste, right?\n\n178\n00:10:42.647 --> 00:10:46.807\nBecause if I use, let's say the amount,\nlet's say we've got,\n\n179\n00:10:46.807 --> 00:10:51.726\nwhat have we got, we've got,\nI don't know, just eight clusters, right,\n\n180\n00:10:51.726 --> 00:10:56.294\nor sectors that have been used or\nconsumed in this cluster, all right?\n\n181\n00:10:56.294 --> 00:10:59.372\nWell, let's go ahead, and let's look.\n\n182\n00:10:59.372 --> 00:11:01.993\nLet me see if I can get all\nthese in one shot, probably not.\n\n183\n00:11:01.993 --> 00:11:03.756\nProbably I'll have to go back on them.\n\n184\n00:11:03.756 --> 00:11:06.085\nYeah, I missed a couple, all right?\n\n185\n00:11:06.085 --> 00:11:09.997\nNow I want you to keep in mind\nwhat is happening here, all right?\n\n186\n00:11:09.997 --> 00:11:16.821\nNotice that in these clusters we're using\nthe same amount of space, all right?\n\n187\n00:11:16.821 --> 00:11:19.654\nAnd let me move this out\nof here just a little bit.\n\n188\n00:11:19.654 --> 00:11:22.758\nMy arrow is kind of getting in the way for\nmy demonstration here.\n\n189\n00:11:22.758 --> 00:11:25.853\nNow I wanna go ahead and\nI wanna do the same thing here, right?\n\n190\n00:11:25.853 --> 00:11:30.673\nWe'll go ahead and\nselect these clusters or sectors,\n\n191\n00:11:30.673 --> 00:11:34.457\njust a portion of the cluster, all right?\n\n192\n00:11:34.457 --> 00:11:35.600\nAnd then we're gonna do the same thing.\n\n193\n00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:40.838\nWe're gonna use a portion of that,\nthat cluster there, all right?\n\n194\n00:11:40.838 --> 00:11:41.580\nIt looks like I got a ball.\n\n195\n00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:45.380\nNow do you see the difference,\nZach, in the wasted space?\n\n196\n00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:47.450\nIf a file uses this space,\n\n197\n00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:52.660\nnotice that, as the cluster size gets\nsmaller, we have that less waste.\n\n198\n00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:55.690\nBut the problem is,\nthe smaller the cluster size,\n\n199\n00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.570\nthe more blocks we have to search.\n\n200\n00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:02.630\nSo even though you have less waste,\nyou do have the potential for\n\n201\n00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:06.140\na little bit less performance, right,\nwhen it comes down to these cluster sizes.\n\n202\n00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:09.260\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, I noticed I don't see\nclusters when using Disk Manager.\n\n203\n00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:10.730\nSo can you help us out with that?\n\n204\n00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:14.225\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and that's where it\ngets a little bit confusing, right,\n\n205\n00:12:14.225 --> 00:12:17.068\ncuz here we're talking about\nclusters being used, right?\n\n206\n00:12:17.068 --> 00:12:18.170\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n207\n00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:18.870\nLet's go ahead and\n\n208\n00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:21.770\nlet's dive down into our Windows\n10 machine that we've been using.\n\n209\n00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:23.627\nKeep in mind we've been using Windows 8.1.\n\n210\n00:12:23.627 --> 00:12:27.477\nAnd Windows 7 Disk Management will work\npretty much the same way across all three\n\n211\n00:12:27.477 --> 00:12:28.790\nof the operating systems.\n\n212\n00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.280\nBut I'll go ahead and\nright-click on the Windows tile here, and\n\n213\n00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.900\nwe'll choose our Disk Management so\nwe can bring that up.\n\n214\n00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:40.667\nAnd then we have our disk here,\nright, we have local disk C.\n\n215\n00:12:40.667 --> 00:12:41.931\nWe've already got a file system.\n\n216\n00:12:41.931 --> 00:12:43.776\nWe'll talk about the file\nsystems coming up.\n\n217\n00:12:43.776 --> 00:12:48.720\nBut then notice that I have\nthis unallocated space, right?\n\n218\n00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.824\nNotice the term allocated, right?\n\n219\n00:12:51.824 --> 00:12:55.434\nIf I right-click, and I decide, hey,\nI'm gonna create a new simple volume.\n\n220\n00:12:55.434 --> 00:12:59.394\nNow you guys,\nwhen we did our storage device episodes,\n\n221\n00:12:59.394 --> 00:13:01.930\nyou probably have seen me use this.\n\n222\n00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:03.712\nAnd we'll use this\nprobably a few more times.\n\n223\n00:13:03.712 --> 00:13:06.001\nIt's a very important\nutility to understand, right?\n\n224\n00:13:06.001 --> 00:13:09.610\nSo we're just going to create\na basic partition, right?\n\n225\n00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:13.570\nSimple volume here and\nwhat the sizes are, and again megabytes.\n\n226\n00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:15.190\nNow you should know what that means,\nright?\n\n227\n00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:16.940\nAnd we choose Next.\n\n228\n00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.932\nAnd then we're gonna assign in\nthe mounting point, right, so\n\n229\n00:13:19.932 --> 00:13:22.142\nthat we can actually work with it,\nall right?\n\n230\n00:13:22.142 --> 00:13:22.990\nWe'll choose Next.\n\n231\n00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:30.190\nAnd the new volume,\nwe'll just call this MTADEMO, all right?\n\n232\n00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.600\nNow, I want you to notice something.\n\n233\n00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.200\nNotice that it doesn't say clusters here.\n\n234\n00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.540\nIt says allocation unit.\n\n235\n00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:39.518\nWhat is that about?\n\n236\n00:13:39.518 --> 00:13:43.869\nWell, remember,\nclusters are the smallest unit of storage\n\n237\n00:13:43.869 --> 00:13:49.100\nmeasurement that a file will use,\nthat a file will allocate its data to.\n\n238\n00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:53.350\nClusters and allocation units\nare essentially the same thing.\n\n239\n00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:56.598\nThey call them allocation units because,\nagain, it's that smallest size.\n\n240\n00:13:56.598 --> 00:13:59.910\nNow, all right, so\nunderstand that allocation unit and\n\n241\n00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.739\nwe'll go ahead and\nfinish this, and then we have\n\n242\n00:14:02.739 --> 00:14:07.231\na nice file system applied to the\npartition that we've created, all right?\n\n243\n00:14:07.231 --> 00:14:10.343\nSo that's where the little of\nthe confusion can come in when it comes to\n\n244\n00:14:10.343 --> 00:14:13.159\nallocation units versus clusters,\nthey're the same thing.\n\n245\n00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:17.000\nNow I wanna go ahead and\nI wanna take a second here.\n\n246\n00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.878\nAnd I wanna talk about the three file\nsystems that we have up on our screen\n\n247\n00:14:21.878 --> 00:14:22.946\nhere, right?\n\n248\n00:14:22.946 --> 00:14:25.620\nOne is pretty much obsolete today,\nall right?\n\n249\n00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.213\nAnd this is FAT, File Allocation Table,\nand then its successor,\n\n250\n00:14:29.213 --> 00:14:32.050\nFile Allocation Table 32,\nall right, FAT32.\n\n251\n00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:33.122\nTypically, we just call it FAT.\n\n252\n00:14:33.122 --> 00:14:37.283\nAll right, now FAT would also could\nbe called, the one that was most\n\n253\n00:14:37.283 --> 00:14:41.955\ncommon could be called FAT16 back in\nthe days of DOS and stuff, all right?\n\n254\n00:14:41.955 --> 00:14:47.970\nFAT16, you can see again pretty\nmuch completely obsolete today.\n\n255\n00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:52.236\nAnd in fact this was for drives that I\nbelieve it was like 4 gig limitation,\n\n256\n00:14:52.236 --> 00:14:53.198\nthe drive size.\n\n257\n00:14:53.198 --> 00:14:57.820\nBecause back in those days when it was\nused, there weren't a lot of drives,\n\n258\n00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:01.157\nright, there weren't drives\nwith a lot of capacity.\n\n259\n00:15:01.157 --> 00:15:03.349\nSo don't worry about that one too much,\nbut\n\n260\n00:15:03.349 --> 00:15:06.263\nI do wanna just give you an idea\nwhere we came from, right?\n\n261\n00:15:06.263 --> 00:15:09.418\nFAT, FAT16, it's obsolete today.\n\n262\n00:15:09.418 --> 00:15:14.342\nHowever, FAT32, we still have\nthe option to use FAT32, all right?\n\n263\n00:15:14.342 --> 00:15:19.184\nAnd FAT32 has some of its benefits.\n\n264\n00:15:19.184 --> 00:15:21.562\nBy default,\nit would have a 32-bit cluster size.\n\n265\n00:15:21.562 --> 00:15:24.260\nYou can shrink it down even more, right?\n\n266\n00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.990\nBut it would allow for\na maximum file size of two gigs.\n\n267\n00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:31.890\nYou couldn't have files that were bigger\nthan two gigs, so that's a limitation.\n\n268\n00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:35.951\nEspecially today when you think about\nthings like high definition video,\n\n269\n00:15:35.951 --> 00:15:38.860\nthat we have movies,\nthat are fives gigs in general.\n\n270\n00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.150\nAnd then we can have things like\nvideos that are well beyond that.\n\n271\n00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:44.510\nSo it's not really good for\nlarge file sizes at all.\n\n272\n00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.780\nThe largest volume size\nwould be two terabytes.\n\n273\n00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:49.872\nYou should know what that means now.\n\n274\n00:15:49.872 --> 00:15:52.298\nWe've been talking about\nthose measurements, right?\n\n275\n00:15:52.298 --> 00:15:54.130\nI don't want any of this to\nbe foreign to you, right?\n\n276\n00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:56.180\nSo two terabyte volume size.\n\n277\n00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:59.704\nAll right, that is some of its benefits.\n\n278\n00:15:59.704 --> 00:16:04.060\nNow there's another benefit to it as well\nas that it's kind of widely supported.\n\n279\n00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:08.340\nSo I know for instance if I'm on a Mac and\n\n280\n00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:11.450\nI need to plug in a thumb drive and\nI need to be able to share it with,\n\n281\n00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:15.890\nlet's say, a Linux operating system,\nI can just format the drive to Fat32.\n\n282\n00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:19.892\nAnd we can move it interoperably\nbetween different operating systems, so\n\n283\n00:16:19.892 --> 00:16:21.995\nit does have that benefit, all right?\n\n284\n00:16:21.995 --> 00:16:28.100\n[COUGH] And it does support all\nof the standard attributes.\n\n285\n00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.680\nThat's important to understand that it\ndoes have all the standard attributes.\n\n286\n00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.990\n&gt;&gt; Wes, final attributes,\nwhat exactly are they?\n\n287\n00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:36.810\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nfinal attributes tell the operating system\n\n288\n00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:39.510\nwhat do I do with this file, all right?\n\n289\n00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:42.050\nWhen I look at this file,\nwhat do I do, all right?\n\n290\n00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:46.530\nAnd there are a series of standard\nattributes that FAT32 has and\n\n291\n00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:49.320\nthat is what's known as read only,\nall right?\n\n292\n00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.990\nRead only means that when you\napply that attribute to that file,\n\n293\n00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:55.250\nyou can't make modifications to it.\n\n294\n00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:57.670\nAlso what is known as\nthe archive attribute.\n\n295\n00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:02.126\nAll right, archive attribute tells a\nbackup subsystem to know whether it should\n\n296\n00:17:02.126 --> 00:17:04.367\nkeep a copy of this the next time it runs.\n\n297\n00:17:04.367 --> 00:17:08.332\nThen you have what's known\nas the system attribute.\n\n298\n00:17:08.332 --> 00:17:11.780\nThe system attribute tells the operating\nsystem, this is a system file,\n\n299\n00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:12.900\nyou better protect it.\n\n300\n00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:16.880\nAnd then there's hidden, h, right.\n\n301\n00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:20.060\nThe hidden attribute says,\nkeep it out of your file management.\n\n302\n00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:24.010\nIf you got a graphical user interface and\nyou're managing your files.\n\n303\n00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:28.620\nIf it has a hidden attribute on it,\nit keeps it out of that view, all right.\n\n304\n00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:30.340\nSo that's important to understand.\n\n305\n00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:32.280\nTells the operating system\nwhat to do with it.\n\n306\n00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.670\nNow, it does have a limitation,\nanother limitation.\n\n307\n00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:41.820\nAnd that's the fact that you don't\nhave any security over your files.\n\n308\n00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:44.301\nIt doesn't support things like ACLs,\nAccess Control List.\n\n309\n00:17:44.301 --> 00:17:47.800\nAnd that brings us to the next one\nthat we have on our list here.\n\n310\n00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.650\nThe next one that we\nhave in our list is NTFS,\n\n311\n00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:51.412\nall right, New Technology File System.\n\n312\n00:17:51.412 --> 00:17:54.840\nNow, this isn't a spring chicken, right.\n\n313\n00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.410\nI mean, it's 5.0 by now.\n\n314\n00:17:56.410 --> 00:18:02.810\nBut it was released back in the NT days,\nthe Windows NT days, as a replacement and\n\n315\n00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:08.540\nthe recommended file system for\nWindows based machines today.\n\n316\n00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:12.580\nAll right, now NTFS has a lot\nof good benefits, all right?\n\n317\n00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.840\nNot only is it the recommended\nfile system for Windows today,\n\n318\n00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.080\nit's also a journal file system.\n\n319\n00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.760\nNow you don't have to worry too much about\nthe fact that it's a journal file system\n\n320\n00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.370\nand Microsoft isn't the only\none to have one, right?\n\n321\n00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:25.760\nA lot of the file systems\nthat are out there for\n\n322\n00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.600\nother operating systems\nare also journal as well.\n\n323\n00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.570\nBut what does journal mean, all right?\n\n324\n00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:34.210\nWell, when we make writes to\nthe hard drive, we wanna make sure\n\n325\n00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:39.360\nthat the writes are in\na uncorrupted manner, right?\n\n326\n00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.520\nSo what it does is that it\nhas like a staging area.\n\n327\n00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.950\nYou kind of think like a journal,\n\n328\n00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:46.180\nthe journal on a file\nsystem is the staging area.\n\n329\n00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.350\nLet's start writing to the journal.\n\n330\n00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:49.611\nWhen we write to the journal,\n\n331\n00:18:49.611 --> 00:18:53.770\nwe'll make sure that the right operation\nis complete and then we'll check it.\n\n332\n00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:56.548\nAnd if it's valid and\nit maintains it's integrity,\n\n333\n00:18:56.548 --> 00:18:58.778\nthen we apply it to the hard drive, right.\n\n334\n00:18:58.778 --> 00:19:01.659\nSo for corruption, right, so\nit's a journal file system.\n\n335\n00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:08.016\nNow the other thing is,\nit also has security built into it.\n\n336\n00:19:08.016 --> 00:19:12.223\nAnd that's one of the big things for\nNTFS, over things like FAT32 is the fact\n\n337\n00:19:12.223 --> 00:19:16.389\nthat it supports ACLs or what we would\ncall generically we call permissions.\n\n338\n00:19:16.389 --> 00:19:20.179\nRight, the ability to use\ndiscretionary access control and\n\n339\n00:19:20.179 --> 00:19:22.928\nwhat you can do is you\ncan set a permission and\n\n340\n00:19:22.928 --> 00:19:26.805\nyou can define what level of access or\naccess at all a user has.\n\n341\n00:19:26.805 --> 00:19:30.326\nMaybe Zach is part of our manager's team,\nall right, I'm not,\n\n342\n00:19:30.326 --> 00:19:32.130\nI'm a part of the help desk team.\n\n343\n00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:33.382\nWell, guess what?\n\n344\n00:19:33.382 --> 00:19:37.332\nIf we don't want part of the help desk to\nhave access to the manager's documents,\n\n345\n00:19:37.332 --> 00:19:39.460\nwe just don't put them in the list, right?\n\n346\n00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:43.913\nWe can restrict that with permissions or\nmaybe it's a list that Zach should be able\n\n347\n00:19:43.913 --> 00:19:47.346\nto modify, make changes to but\nI should only be able to read it.\n\n348\n00:19:47.346 --> 00:19:49.425\nWell, we can apply a permission\nto it that says, hey,\n\n349\n00:19:49.425 --> 00:19:52.153\nyou can actually view this document,\nbut you can't make any changes.\n\n350\n00:19:52.153 --> 00:19:56.781\nBut based on that Zach's job role we\ncan give him full control over, or\n\n351\n00:19:56.781 --> 00:19:59.455\nwe can allow him to make modifications.\n\n352\n00:19:59.455 --> 00:20:02.575\nRight, maybe we don't want him to\ndo things like set permissions or\n\n353\n00:20:02.575 --> 00:20:05.490\ntake permissions,\ntake control of ownership over the files.\n\n354\n00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:07.360\nSo we don't give him full control.\n\n355\n00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.470\nMaybe there's only one person in\nthe company that's the gatekeeper and\n\n356\n00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:10.770\nhas all the keys to the kingdom, right?\n\n357\n00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:13.610\nMaybe we just want to allow Zach to\nmake modifications cuz that's part of\n\n358\n00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:14.460\nhis job role.\n\n359\n00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:16.700\nWell, we give him the modify permission,\nwe don't give him full control.\n\n360\n00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.727\nSo we can implement things like security.\n\n361\n00:20:18.727 --> 00:20:23.704\nAll right, now we'll talk more about\npermissions in other episodes, but\n\n362\n00:20:23.704 --> 00:20:27.661\none of the things that NTFS\nbrings to the table, all right?\n\n363\n00:20:27.661 --> 00:20:32.373\nThe other thing is that it supports the\nstandard attributes and the way I was told\n\n364\n00:20:32.373 --> 00:20:36.804\nhow you can remember the standard\nattributes, is if you can remember every\n\n365\n00:20:36.804 --> 00:20:41.110\nfile can get a rash, you could\nremember the basic system attributes.\n\n366\n00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:42.110\n&gt;&gt; And they might need ointment.\n\n367\n00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:43.099\n&gt;&gt; That's right, they might, right?\n\n368\n00:20:43.099 --> 00:20:48.403\nSo we say Read Only, R, Archive,\nSystem and Hidden, RASH, right?\n\n369\n00:20:48.403 --> 00:20:49.528\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n370\n00:20:49.528 --> 00:20:55.034\n&gt;&gt; However, I will tell you that NTFS\nnot only supports the basic attributes,\n\n371\n00:20:55.034 --> 00:20:59.079\nit also supports whats known\nas extended attributes and\n\n372\n00:20:59.079 --> 00:21:01.820\nthis is another benefit of NTFS.\n\n373\n00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:04.069\nI gotta be careful, cuz I always\nwanna say NTFS file system and\n\n374\n00:21:04.069 --> 00:21:06.545\nthat's like saying the new\ntechnology file system, file system.\n\n375\n00:21:06.545 --> 00:21:07.468\nBoy that's redundant.\n\n376\n00:21:07.468 --> 00:21:08.570\n&gt;&gt; Redundancy, redundancy.\n\n377\n00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:09.750\n&gt;&gt; Redundancy, that's right.\n\n378\n00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:11.474\n&gt;&gt; So,what are the extended attributes?\n\n379\n00:21:11.474 --> 00:21:13.632\nWell this is another of\none of those benefits.\n\n380\n00:21:13.632 --> 00:21:16.136\nNTFS supports what's known\nas data compression.\n\n381\n00:21:16.136 --> 00:21:19.360\nFile level compression in the fact\nthat you can compress the data to save\n\n382\n00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.580\ndrive space and that was important\nat the time NTFS came out.\n\n383\n00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.781\nMaybe not so important today because\nof the fact the drives are expanding,\n\n384\n00:21:25.781 --> 00:21:27.060\nall right.\n\n385\n00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:31.043\nNow the other thing too is\nthat with a GPT based system,\n\n386\n00:21:31.043 --> 00:21:35.632\nthe table that we talked\nabout in our storage devices,\n\n387\n00:21:35.632 --> 00:21:39.720\nit scales beyond our two\nterabyte limitation, right.\n\n388\n00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:40.860\nWell beyond, right.\n\n389\n00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.840\nSo not only does it have compression,\n\n390\n00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.350\nit's also got what's known\nas an indexing attribute.\n\n391\n00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:51.500\nAnd an indexing attribute helps\nthe Windows subsystem when it searches for\n\n392\n00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.840\na file find it faster, right?\n\n393\n00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.250\nIf I index it, right,\nthink about what an index mark is, right?\n\n394\n00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:57.980\nNow I can find it.\n\n395\n00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:59.510\nWhen I search for it, I can find it.\n\n396\n00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:01.770\nIt's kinda like a little bookmark for\nthe file.\n\n397\n00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:05.930\nBut it also supports security\nbeyond just permissions.\n\n398\n00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:08.790\nIt supports what's known\nas encryption with EFS.\n\n399\n00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:09.650\nNow we've talked about,\n\n400\n00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:12.190\nin our storage devices, we talked\nabout BitLocker Drive Encryption,\n\n401\n00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:15.260\nfull disk encryption,\nas well as the Encrypted File System.\n\n402\n00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:21.570\nBut in order to do the Encrypted File\nSystem, you actually turn on an attribute.\n\n403\n00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:22.870\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n404\n00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:27.060\nIn fact, from one of our other episodes,\nif you haven't checked it out,\n\n405\n00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:27.680\ngo check it out.\n\n406\n00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:34.110\nWe actually turned on EFS, the file\nencryption system here, all right.\n\n407\n00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:37.338\nWell, let's go ahead and\nlet's look at those attributes.\n\n408\n00:22:37.338 --> 00:22:38.796\nAnd we'll do this a couple of ways.\n\n409\n00:22:38.796 --> 00:22:42.550\nSo I'm gonna just go and right-click\non the file, in this case the folder.\n\n410\n00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:45.963\nAnd I'm gonna choose Properties,\nall right?\n\n411\n00:22:45.963 --> 00:22:49.830\nNow, notice that it says,\nonly applies to the files in the folder.\n\n412\n00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:51.740\nIt says they're read-only, right?\n\n413\n00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.620\nSo there's one of the attributes, right?\n\n414\n00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:56.150\nThat's the R in rash, if you remember.\n\n415\n00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:59.160\nAnd then there's H,\nwhich is hidden, all right?\n\n416\n00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.320\nNow you gotta be careful with this one.\n\n417\n00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.440\nWhen you set hidden,\nall right, and you apply it.\n\n418\n00:23:05.086 --> 00:23:06.340\nWhere'd it go?\n\n419\n00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:07.160\n&gt;&gt; It's hidden.\n\n420\n00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:10.990\n&gt;&gt; That's right, your desktop\nis a graphical user interface.\n\n421\n00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:12.760\nA file folder management utility.\n\n422\n00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.630\nNow we just see it as our entry\npoint into the operating system.\n\n423\n00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:17.960\nBut technically,\nyou're looking at a directory.\n\n424\n00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:21.730\nAnd it's saying,\nkeep this out of view, all right?\n\n425\n00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.480\nHow do I get it back?\n\n426\n00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:28.450\nWell, now you gotta go down to the command\nprompt in order to get this back.\n\n427\n00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:30.210\nSo let's go ahead and let's do this.\n\n428\n00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:35.210\nAnd let's show you that, yes,\nit is still there, all right?\n\n429\n00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:38.730\nAnd I'll tell you what, let me, oops,\nlet me close that down apparently.\n\n430\n00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:40.670\nTry that again here.\n\n431\n00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:43.140\nI wanna increase that font\nsize just a little bit.\n\n432\n00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.672\nMake it a little easier for\ny'all to see out there.\n\n433\n00:23:49.851 --> 00:23:54.374\nYeah, I'm not worried about it, okay, so\nthere we go, makes it a little bit easier.\n\n434\n00:23:54.374 --> 00:23:55.649\nAnd we're gonna go ahead.\n\n435\n00:23:55.649 --> 00:24:00.630\nAnd let's get into my desktop,\n\n436\n00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:04.140\nwbryan, there we go.\n\n437\n00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:07.568\nAnd here, okay, so we're at the desktop.\n\n438\n00:24:07.568 --> 00:24:11.050\nAll right, so\ncommand line interface at the desktop,\n\n439\n00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:13.520\ngraphical user interface at the desktop,\nright?\n\n440\n00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:19.420\nAnd if I use the command rttib,\nr-t-t-i-b, and I run that, all right?\n\n441\n00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:23.460\nI can see, well,\nthere really isn't any file here, right?\n\n442\n00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:26.730\nWe don't have any files here.\n\n443\n00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:31.920\nBut if you need additional help,\nwhat you can do is something like this,\n\n444\n00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:36.925\nrttib, rtrib, and you can do a forward\nslash question mark, all right?\n\n445\n00:24:36.925 --> 00:24:40.750\nNow, what this will do is it will\nallow you to see potentially,\n\n446\n00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:45.420\nall of the locations that are,\nor all of the files and\n\n447\n00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:48.380\nfolders that are hidden, all right?\n\n448\n00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:51.640\nSo how do we get this file or\nfolder back, right?\n\n449\n00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:53.057\nWell, we can do attrib.\n\n450\n00:24:53.057 --> 00:24:55.556\nWell, I'll tell you one\nway we can do this.\n\n451\n00:24:55.556 --> 00:25:01.140\nLet me go ahead and\nkinda put this on hold for a second.\n\n452\n00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:05.354\nIf I open up File Explorer, remember in\nanother episode when we were talking about\n\n453\n00:25:05.354 --> 00:25:09.520\nsome of the utilities, I said by default\nFile Explorer hides files and folders?\n\n454\n00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:13.313\nWell, if we go to the View\ntab here in the ribbon, and\n\n455\n00:25:13.313 --> 00:25:19.360\nwe choose Hidden Items, and we put\na check mark in, oops, or we disappear.\n\n456\n00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:23.370\nAnd we put a check mark in there,\ndo you see that came back there, Zack?\n\n457\n00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:24.360\nRight there?\n&gt;&gt; I see that, yes.\n\n458\n00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:29.580\n&gt;&gt; Because what it does is that says I\ndon't care if it has a hidden archive,\n\n459\n00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:33.770\nor excuse me, a hidden attribute, I want\nyou to ignore that hidden attribute.\n\n460\n00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:38.292\n&gt;&gt; But sure enough, if I take that and\nI change that, and I say go ahead and\n\n461\n00:25:38.292 --> 00:25:42.912\npay attention to the hidden attribute,\nit disappears again, right?\n\n462\n00:25:42.912 --> 00:25:46.427\nSo if you need to find hidden files and\nfolders, right?\n\n463\n00:25:46.427 --> 00:25:49.283\nAll you have to do is go\nto your folder options, and\n\n464\n00:25:49.283 --> 00:25:51.400\nI know I kinda did that really quick.\n\n465\n00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.740\nLet me slow that down a little bit.\n\n466\n00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:54.620\nSo over here to Options, right?\n\n467\n00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:58.080\nAnd this brings up your folder options.\n\n468\n00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:58.820\nAnd we go to View.\n\n469\n00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:04.370\nAnd we can see where it Shows hidden\nfiles, folders and drives, right?\n\n470\n00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:05.910\nAnd then it comes back.\n\n471\n00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:08.660\nNow, you can use the attrib command.\n\n472\n00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:13.830\nAnd if we run that, all right, again,\nwe still don't see our folder, right?\n\n473\n00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:17.190\nBecause that's telling\nFile Explorer to ignore it.\n\n474\n00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:23.120\nBut if I go ahead and I say ATTRIB minus H\n\n475\n00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:29.110\nand I type SECRET, file not found.\n\n476\n00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.610\nInteresting.\n\n477\n00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:35.788\nLet's do, maybe it is,\nlet's do a cd in secret here.\n\n478\n00:26:37.496 --> 00:26:39.940\nAnd attrib.\n\n479\n00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:41.010\nAll right, there we go.\n\n480\n00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:42.840\nNotice that we've got\nour super secret text.\n\n481\n00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:43.940\nOoh, it's secret.\n&gt;&gt; Super secret.\n\n482\n00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:44.890\n&gt;&gt; Super secret, right?\n\n483\n00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:48.870\nAnd it's actually propagating\nthe hidden attribute here.\n\n484\n00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:53.603\nNow, if I remove that from the file,\nattrib -h,\n\n485\n00:26:53.603 --> 00:26:57.565\nand then we say super secret, all right?\n\n486\n00:26:57.565 --> 00:26:59.168\nAnd we run that.\n\n487\n00:26:59.168 --> 00:27:04.785\nI can get in here and\nI can now See the file, all right?\n\n488\n00:27:04.785 --> 00:27:08.030\nNow you can add additional attributes\nif you would like, like for\n\n489\n00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:12.286\ninstance, and let me go ahead and I'll\nright-click and choose Properties on this.\n\n490\n00:27:12.286 --> 00:27:15.525\nAnd let me uncheck the hidden so\nit'll come back into our view here.\n\n491\n00:27:15.525 --> 00:27:20.725\nAnd we'll apply it to all the files and\nfolders within this folder itself.\n\n492\n00:27:20.725 --> 00:27:24.130\nAll right, now if I wanted to,\nI can turn around and\n\n493\n00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:25.960\nI can add the encryption attribute.\n\n494\n00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:28.640\nAnd the way you do that is just\nright-click on the folder,\n\n495\n00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.000\nchoose Properties.\n\n496\n00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.491\nAnd instead of just staying here with\nRead-only and Hidden, you choose Advanced.\n\n497\n00:27:34.491 --> 00:27:37.148\nAnd notice we have Encrypt\ncontents to secure data.\n\n498\n00:27:37.148 --> 00:27:39.643\nYou've probably seen that in\nother episodes where we did that.\n\n499\n00:27:39.643 --> 00:27:42.510\nBut here is also\nthe compression attribute.\n\n500\n00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:44.760\nSo these are extended attributes, right?\n\n501\n00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.720\nNotice the folder is ready for archiving?\n\n502\n00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.670\nThat's the archive bit\nthat we're talking about.\n\n503\n00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:52.950\nAnd allow files in this folder\nto have the contents indexed.\n\n504\n00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:54.458\nThat's that i, right?\n\n505\n00:27:54.458 --> 00:27:59.820\nSo those are the extended attributes\nthat you find within NTFS, all right?\n\n506\n00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:01.980\nSo that's a little bit about NTFS, right?\n\n507\n00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:05.390\nThe last one that I have is not\nreally in the list, all right?\n\n508\n00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:09.833\nAnd that's because it is the next\ngeneration of proprietary file system by\n\n509\n00:28:09.833 --> 00:28:13.711\nMicrosoft, and what they're trying\nto do is come up with what's\n\n510\n00:28:13.711 --> 00:28:17.749\ngonna eventually replace NTFS\nbecause it scales astronomically.\n\n511\n00:28:17.749 --> 00:28:21.580\nAnd that's something known as\nthe resilient file system, REFS.\n\n512\n00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:24.220\nAll right, REFS, if you will, again,\n\n513\n00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:28.060\nis the next generation file system for\nMicrosoft.\n\n514\n00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:29.767\nIs highly scalable.\n\n515\n00:28:29.767 --> 00:28:34.490\nIn fact, let's go ahead and go back to\nour data measurement units, all right?\n\n516\n00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:38.280\nNotice I told you that 8 Exabytes\nwas about what the data was\n\n517\n00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.490\nthat traverse the entire Internet?\n\n518\n00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:48.040\nWell, let me give you an idea of what\nresilient file system scales up to.\n\n519\n00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:53.400\nWe go past an exabyte, and we go to\nwhat's known as the zettabyte, all right?\n\n520\n00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:58.890\nAnd if you remember what we said,\nthat means that's 1,024 exabytes.\n\n521\n00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:00.580\nBut we're not done there.\n\n522\n00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:04.950\nNow, we're gonna go to\nwhat's known as a yotabyte.\n\n523\n00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:08.928\nNow, I can see some of you\nStar Wars fans out there saying-\n\n524\n00:29:08.928 --> 00:29:09.438\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna say [LAUGH]\n\n525\n00:29:09.438 --> 00:29:09.980\nsay that correctly.\n\n526\n00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:10.990\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n527\n00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:11.540\n&gt;&gt; Yotabyte.\n\n528\n00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:12.490\n&gt;&gt; That's a yotabyte.\n\n529\n00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:12.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there you go.\n\n530\n00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:18.150\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we're talking two\nlevels of measurements above what\n\n531\n00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:21.750\nthe worldwide Internet\nsends in a single day.\n\n532\n00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:23.440\n&gt;&gt; Goodness.\n\n533\n00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:26.268\n&gt;&gt; So astronomically large, right?\n\n534\n00:29:26.268 --> 00:29:27.971\nThe other thing to keep in mind,\n\n535\n00:29:27.971 --> 00:29:32.310\ntoo, is that it also supports things\nlike built in integrity systems, right?\n\n536\n00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:33.410\nIt detects corruption.\n\n537\n00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:36.600\nIt's used in technologies\nlike storage spaces.\n\n538\n00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:40.020\nStorage bases inside of Windows is the way\nthat I could take multiple drives.\n\n539\n00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:43.130\nI can aggregate them together and\nbasically create a virtualized\n\n540\n00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:46.590\npool of storage that we can\nthen logically divide up.\n\n541\n00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:50.970\nResilient File System is one of\nthe file systems that you can use.\n\n542\n00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:53.340\nOne of the great things\nabout this is NTFS.\n\n543\n00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:57.470\nWhen I need to detect corruption,\nI use a program called Check Disk.\n\n544\n00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:58.840\nAnd what does it do?\n\n545\n00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.499\nWell, we kinda talked about in another\nepisodes, and we said storage device.\n\n546\n00:30:01.499 --> 00:30:03.712\nBut it has to actually\ntake the drive offline,\n\n547\n00:30:03.712 --> 00:30:05.960\nit has to take the file system offline.\n\n548\n00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:09.868\nAnd then, it checks for errors and\nit checks for data corruption, checks for\n\n549\n00:30:09.868 --> 00:30:13.657\nbad sectors, tries to move files around,\nmark those sectors as bad so that\n\n550\n00:30:13.657 --> 00:30:17.835\nthe operating system doesn't try to use\nand send data to the bad sectors, right?\n\n551\n00:30:17.835 --> 00:30:20.483\nSo it detects file corruption,\ntries to repair it.\n\n552\n00:30:20.483 --> 00:30:22.649\nResilient file system, rarely,\n\n553\n00:30:22.649 --> 00:30:27.390\nrarely needs to take a drive offline o\nra file system offline and check it.\n\n554\n00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:28.720\nIt can do that on the fly.\n\n555\n00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:32.800\nNow, there are some times, and you won't\nhave to worry about when this happens, but\n\n556\n00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:37.700\nyou do have to take it offline,\nbut rarely do you ever need to.\n\n557\n00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:41.460\nIn fact, so much so that if you\ntried to run check disk on REFS,\n\n558\n00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:42.980\nthe command prompt will\ngive you a warning and\n\n559\n00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:46.200\nsay you don't need to use check\ndisk on this, I got this, right?\n\n560\n00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:50.860\nSo it has its built-in integrity\nchecks for corrupt data, too.\n\n561\n00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:53.310\nThese are some of the things you have to\nknow when it comes to file systems, and\n\n562\n00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:54.970\nhopefully you understand them.\n\n563\n00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:57.940\nKeep in mind, get in disk management,\nformat your drives, right?\n\n564\n00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:59.680\nUnderstand the attributes as well so\n\n565\n00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:03.110\nthat if they ask you these questions\non your MTA exam, you'll be doing well.\n\n566\n00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:06.470\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic understanding\nfile systems inside\n\n567\n00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:09.190\nthe MTA Windows OS Fundamental series.\n\n568\n00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:11.630\n&gt;&gt; Make sure you watch all the episodes,\nthey are good for you.\n\n569\n00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:13.280\nAnd when you're in that course library,\n\n570\n00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:17.050\nthere's thousands of other videos\nthere to help you go further.\n\n571\n00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:19.181\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITPROTV.\n\n572\n00:31:19.181 --> 00:31:20.140\nITPROTV is binge worthy.\n\n573\n00:31:20.140 -->

00:00:08.635\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.635 --> 00:00:11.312\n&gt;&gt; You watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.312 --> 00:00:13.887\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:13.887 --> 00:00:16.070\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.350\nI am your host, Zach Memos.\n\n8\n00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.390\nWith this episode of\nMTA Windows OS Fundamentals.\n\n9\n00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.240\nUnderstanding libraries is\nthe title of this episode.\n\n10\n00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.860\nAnd I don't understand libraries.\n\n11\n00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.980\nCan you help me with that?\n\n12\n00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.650\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, I don't think\ntoday's day and age with electronic\n\n13\n00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.050\nbooks anymore that many people\nunderstand libraries, that's right.\n\n14\n00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.760\nWell, we do have libraries\ninside of Windows, so\n\n15\n00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.200\nthat's what we're gonna\nbe taking a look at.\n\n16\n00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.922\nWe're gonna be taking a look\nat a couple other things.\n\n17\n00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:42.820\nIn fact, it's kinda funny,\nthe title is understanding libraries and\n\n18\n00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.780\nwe're gonna configure something\ncompletely different.\n\n19\n00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.610\nNo, just kidding, we will get to\nlibraries, but there are few other things\n\n20\n00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.980\nthat we need to be aware of when it comes\nto your objectives for your MTA exams.\n\n21\n00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.030\nWe're gonna look at something\nknown as not only libraries but\n\n22\n00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.260\nwe're gonna look at something\nas well known as offline files.\n\n23\n00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.230\nAnd I think that's where we're gonna\nstart, we're gonna start with something\n\n24\n00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.220\nknown as offline files, and then we'll\nmove into libraries a little bit more.\n\n25\n00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.480\nThey kind of group these together, and\n\n26\n00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.080\noffline files doesn't necessarily\nrelate to libraries as much as it does\n\n27\n00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.980\nmaking sure that if you have access to\na network resource, all right, well,\n\n28\n00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.560\nI want you to think about what it requires\nto have access to that network resource.\n\n29\n00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.210\nNow, we're not talking about\npermissions and stuff.\n\n30\n00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.240\nWe'll talk about shares in other episodes,\n\n31\n00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.470\nif we haven't already by the time\nof this recording, all right?\n\n32\n00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.020\nBut remember what a share is, all right?\n\n33\n00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.350\nA share is a resource that's available\nto users across the network.\n\n34\n00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.590\nWhich means that if I share a resource out\nof my computer, my Windows machine, and\n\n35\n00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.890\nZack, I need to give him access, right?\n\n36\n00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.090\nI tell Zack what the name of the share is,\nand\n\n37\n00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.970\nthen he can browse over the network with\nhis Windows machine in a File Explorer,\n\n38\n00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.480\nand he can connect to that\nfolder over the network, right?\n\n39\n00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.710\nOther things that can be shared out.\n\n40\n00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.830\nHard drives can be shared out.\n\n41\n00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.150\nPrinters can be shared out, as well.\n\n42\n00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.000\nBut again, not really relative to\nlibraries in this episode, all right?\n\n43\n00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.090\nNow, I want you to think,\nagain, outside of permissions,\n\n44\n00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.510\nwhat does it require to have\naccess to a network resource?\n\n45\n00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.638\nRequires the network.\n\n46\n00:02:05.638 --> 00:02:09.580\nYou have to have network access to have\naccess to the network resource, right?\n\n47\n00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.602\nIt's kind of like the whole chicken and\nthe egg syndrome, right?\n\n48\n00:02:11.602 --> 00:02:12.678\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n49\n00:02:12.678 --> 00:02:13.410\nGotta have it.\n\n50\n00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.799\n&gt;&gt; So what happens if you don't\nhave access to the network?\n\n51\n00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.999\nWell, then you don't have access\nto that network resource.\n\n52\n00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:22.399\nAnd if it's something\nwhere the productivity or\n\n53\n00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:25.853\nwhatever the role is that you're\nperforming inside of your network,\n\n54\n00:02:25.853 --> 00:02:28.329\nit's important to have\naccess to that resource.\n\n55\n00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.726\nWouldn't it be nice to have\ntechnology that allow you,\n\n56\n00:02:31.726 --> 00:02:36.569\neven if you are disconnected, to still\nhave a level of access to that resource so\n\n57\n00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.510\nthen you can maintain\na level of productivity?\n\n58\n00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.360\nAnd that's where the first thing\nthat we're gonna talk about,\n\n59\n00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.550\nsomething known as offline files,\ncomes in.\n\n60\n00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.810\nOffline files is exactly what\nthe name implies, all right?\n\n61\n00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.910\nI can have access to the files\neven if I am offline.\n\n62\n00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.220\nAnd what do we mean by offline?\n\n63\n00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.444\nIt's not necessarily that\nthe operating system shut down,\n\n64\n00:02:54.444 --> 00:02:56.107\ncuz then you don't have\naccess to anything.\n\n65\n00:02:56.107 --> 00:02:59.002\nBut that you're off of the network,\nall right?\n\n66\n00:02:59.002 --> 00:03:03.564\nAnd that is important not only to\nkinda understand how to set it up and\n\n67\n00:03:03.564 --> 00:03:09.026\nbe able to understand the interface,\nright, but also see it in action, right?\n\n68\n00:03:09.026 --> 00:03:11.510\nAnd that's what we wanna do,\nwe don't wanna just talk about it here.\n\n69\n00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.210\nLet's go ahead with that\nlong winded introduction and\n\n70\n00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.200\nshow you what I mean here.\n\n71\n00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.100\nAll right, there we go.\n\n72\n00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.780\nSo we're logged in and we'll go ahead,\nwe'll get to our desktop.\n\n73\n00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.510\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nopen File Explorer, all right?\n\n74\n00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.590\nAnd we're gonna create a shared resource,\nall right?\n\n75\n00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.226\nSo what I'll do is I'll get\ninto Documents here, and\n\n76\n00:03:28.226 --> 00:03:31.692\nin Documents I'm just gonna\nright-click and I'm gonna choose New.\n\n77\n00:03:32.957 --> 00:03:34.420\nAnd folder.\n\n78\n00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.759\nAnd we'll call this Storage01, all right?\n\n79\n00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:42.790\nKind of generic there, but\nit will serve its purpose, right?\n\n80\n00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.063\nAnd inside Storage01,\nwe're gonna have a couple of files.\n\n81\n00:03:46.063 --> 00:03:50.087\nMaybe we have a text document called,\n\n82\n00:03:50.087 --> 00:03:54.880\nI don't know, marketing numbers, right?\n\n83\n00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.735\nMaybe we have one in here called\n\n84\n00:03:59.735 --> 00:04:04.041\ngeneral info, all right?\n\n85\n00:04:04.041 --> 00:04:07.690\nNow, what I need to do is I\nneed to share this out, right?\n\n86\n00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.710\nI need to share it out so\n\n87\n00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.830\nas a resource people can access\nit over the network, right?\n\n88\n00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.480\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe're gonna right-click, and\n\n89\n00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.680\nwe're gonna choose Properties.\n\n90\n00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.550\nAnd from the properties of Storage01 here,\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna go\n\n91\n00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.250\nahead and choose the Sharing tab,\nand we'll choose Advanced Sharing.\n\n92\n00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.430\nAnd we'll share the folder out.\n\n93\n00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.889\nNow, I'm gonna set some permissions here.\n\n94\n00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.950\nAnd one of the things I'm gonna do is\nI'm actually gonna remove the everyone.\n\n95\n00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.440\nI don't like the everyone on the list,\ncuz that includes guests.\n\n96\n00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.790\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and remove that,\nand it'll kind of balk at me.\n\n97\n00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:38.340\nIt says hey,\n\n98\n00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.630\nwait, you're not gonna give anybody access\nif you don't put somebody in the list.\n\n99\n00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:42.620\nSo we're gonna go and Add.\n\n100\n00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.030\nWhat I like to do is take, basically,\ntake everyone out of the list,\n\n101\n00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.410\nbecause that includes\nthe guest account and\n\n102\n00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.460\nI certainly don't want guests\npotentially having access to this.\n\n103\n00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.260\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nI'm going to say just Authenticated Users.\n\n104\n00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.139\nI want people that have actually logged\nin with their user name and password,\n\n105\n00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:58.348\nthey’re going to have access.\n\n106\n00:04:58.348 --> 00:04:59.531\nAnd then from there,\n\n107\n00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:03.289\nwe can further restrict what we want\npeople to have access to or not.\n\n108\n00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:05.754\nNow, we'll go ahead and\nwe'll make it full control so\n\n109\n00:05:05.754 --> 00:05:10.040\nwe don't have to worry about any kind\nof permissions causing a problem here.\n\n110\n00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.360\nWe'll choose OK, and then OK again.\n\n111\n00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.660\nAnd I just wanna make sure that I\nset the permissions appropriately.\n\n112\n00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.760\nLooks like I should have access to this.\n\n113\n00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.558\nOkay, so going to our Properties here,\n\n114\n00:05:21.558 --> 00:05:27.603\nnotice that once we share it out\nwe've got our UNC path, right?\n\n115\n00:05:27.603 --> 00:05:29.318\nThis is how we access it over the network,\nright?\n\n116\n00:05:29.318 --> 00:05:33.680\nThat syntax is backslash backslash\ncomputer name backslash whatever the share\n\n117\n00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.690\nname is, right?\n\n118\n00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.538\nWe talked about setting up shares and\nsharing resources in other episodes, so\n\n119\n00:05:37.538 --> 00:05:40.515\nif some of this is a little bit foreign to\nyou, definitely check out those episodes\n\n120\n00:05:40.515 --> 00:05:42.390\nand then come back and\nlook at this one, all right?\n\n121\n00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.518\nSo now,\nthat's how we set up the shared resource.\n\n122\n00:05:46.518 --> 00:05:49.368\nLet's go ahead and\njump over to our Windows 10 machine and\n\n123\n00:05:49.368 --> 00:05:51.710\nlet's launch up our File Explorer,\nall right?\n\n124\n00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.097\nAnd when we launch up File Explore,\nremember that File Explore is actually a,\n\n125\n00:05:56.097 --> 00:05:58.167\nit's a network aware application.\n\n126\n00:05:58.167 --> 00:06:01.539\nNot only does it allow you to file and\nfolder management on your local machine,\n\n127\n00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:05.269\nbut if you have access to other machines,\nusername and password and the permissions,\n\n128\n00:06:05.269 --> 00:06:06.956\nyou can also basically manage files and\n\n129\n00:06:06.956 --> 00:06:09.029\nfolders that are on remote computers,\nright?\n\n130\n00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:13.220\nThat's the purpose of the UNC path\nis to have access to that location.\n\n131\n00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.422\nSo if I type backslash backslash,\nthe computer name, in this case DC01,\n\n132\n00:06:17.422 --> 00:06:20.443\nbackslash, you'll see that\nit kind of reaches out and\n\n133\n00:06:20.443 --> 00:06:23.546\nit says, through SMB,\nthe server message block.\n\n134\n00:06:23.546 --> 00:06:26.275\nIt says yeah, I see that there is\nsome shared resources here, and\n\n135\n00:06:26.275 --> 00:06:27.450\nit kind of puts it in the list.\n\n136\n00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.710\nBut I'll go ahead and I'll type it out for\n\n137\n00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.250\nyou with you all,\nat least this first time.\n\n138\n00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.830\nI won't be the one telling you to do\npush ups and then sit in the corner and\n\n139\n00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.304\nwatch you do them.\n\n140\n00:06:36.304 --> 00:06:37.041\nAnd we'll hit Enter.\n\n141\n00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:39.650\nAnd then, sure enough,\nI have access to the resources, right?\n\n142\n00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.250\nSo I have access to that folder, right?\n\n143\n00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.067\nThere's the shared resource, and\nI can connect over the network, all right?\n\n144\n00:06:46.067 --> 00:06:50.962\nNow, let's go ahead, and\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'll go ahead and\n\n145\n00:06:50.962 --> 00:06:53.280\nclose down File Explorer now.\n\n146\n00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.050\nAnd what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna right-click\n\n147\n00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.040\ndown here in the lower right-hand corner.\n\n148\n00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.550\nI'm gonna open the Network and\nSharing Center, and then from here,\n\n149\n00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.840\ngo to Ethernet, and\nthis little task link here.\n\n150\n00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.320\nWe'll choose Network and Sharing Center.\n\n151\n00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.420\nAnd then, over here,\nChange adapter settings.\n\n152\n00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.010\nAnd what I'm gonna do is simulate\na network failure, all right?\n\n153\n00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:18.548\nI'm gonna be the network failure, but\nI will go ahead and do this myself.\n\n154\n00:07:18.548 --> 00:07:20.580\nI'm gonna right-click on the network\nadapter in question, and\n\n155\n00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.670\nI'm gonna go ahead and choose disable.\n\n156\n00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:28.410\nAll right, so we're offline, we do not\nhave access to the network, right?\n\n157\n00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.850\nSo let's go ahead,\nlet's close down all these interfaces and\n\n158\n00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:34.560\nbring back up File Explorer, and\nwe're gonna type in our UNC path.\n\n159\n00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.680\nAnd this time,\nI'll let it go ahead and finish for\n\n160\n00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.070\nme, or let it auto-fill it for\nme, all right?\n\n161\n00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.520\nNow, notice what I get.\n\n162\n00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.210\nRemember I said that was\nthe network failure?\n\n163\n00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:47.230\nWell, it's given me a network error.\n\n164\n00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:48.850\nIt's telling me to check the spelling and\nthe name,\n\n165\n00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:52.210\nand according to how I type it's\nprobably a good thing it told me that.\n\n166\n00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.787\nIt says, otherwise there might\nbe a problem with your network.\n\n167\n00:07:54.787 --> 00:07:58.421\nTo try to identify and\nresolve network problems, click Diagnose.\n\n168\n00:07:58.421 --> 00:08:01.735\nI'm not gonna click diagnose because\nthat's gonna fire off the network\n\n169\n00:08:01.735 --> 00:08:02.774\ndiagnostic trouble.\n\n170\n00:08:02.774 --> 00:08:04.499\nOr diagnostic utility.\n\n171\n00:08:04.499 --> 00:08:06.346\nAnd I know what the issue is.\n\n172\n00:08:06.346 --> 00:08:07.220\nI'm the issue.\n\n173\n00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.540\n[LAUGH] I disabled the network adapter.\n\n174\n00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:16.540\nAll right, so\nI cannot connect to our shared resource.\n\n175\n00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:17.950\nSo I have a problem.\n\n176\n00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:22.860\nThis is where offline files is\ngonna come in handy, right?\n\n177\n00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.080\nBut we have to be able to set it up.\n\n178\n00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:31.413\nAll right, so let me go ahead and\nshow you how we set up that right here.\n\n179\n00:08:31.413 --> 00:08:34.550\nAnd we don't really need the start menu\nhere, what I should have done is just gone\n\n180\n00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:36.920\nahead and right click and\nwe'll chose Settings, right?\n\n181\n00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:44.290\nNow we're gonna go to System, this is\ndone in the old Control Panel interface.\n\n182\n00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:47.840\nIn Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 it's gonna\nbe the same interface that you're\n\n183\n00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.860\ngonna see coming up here.\n\n184\n00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.980\nBut keep in mind with Windows 10\nthey're kind of phasing out the old\n\n185\n00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:55.220\nControl Panel in favor of the new\nWindows Settings interface\n\n186\n00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.590\nthat you find through the Action Center.\n\n187\n00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:58.310\nSo they're kinda\nsupporting two interfaces.\n\n188\n00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:01.790\nBut what I do is I'll go to Settings and\nthen System.\n\n189\n00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:05.760\nI go to Power &amp; sleep, and then I know\nI've got this little hyperlink right here.\n\n190\n00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:10.460\nAnd that little link will actually open\nup the traditional control panel, right?\n\n191\n00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.312\nWhich is what we need when we\nget to Sync Center, all right,\n\n192\n00:09:14.312 --> 00:09:15.590\nor offline files if you will.\n\n193\n00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:18.620\nAll right, we're gonna go to\nControl Panel, all right.\n\n194\n00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:23.540\nAnd then from here I'm gonna switch\nover from Category view to Large icons.\n\n195\n00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.570\nI could use the search feature, but\nthen that doesn't really hope you get\n\n196\n00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.730\nfamiliar with the interface and\nthat's why we wanna to do here.\n\n197\n00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:32.602\nWe want you to be familiar and comfortable\nwith manipulating the operating system and\n\n198\n00:09:32.602 --> 00:09:34.550\nworking with it, doing configurations.\n\n199\n00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:38.014\nNow, what I'm looking for\nis Sync Center, all right.\n\n200\n00:09:38.014 --> 00:09:41.490\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nwe will pull up Sync Center.\n\n201\n00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:42.770\nNow you might say, well, wait a second,\n\n202\n00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:44.820\nwhat does Sync Center have\nto do with offline files?\n\n203\n00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.490\nWell, Sync Center actually is a technology\nthat's been around in Windows for\n\n204\n00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:50.495\na while that allows you to\nplug a mobile device in.\n\n205\n00:09:50.495 --> 00:09:54.710\nAnd if a partnership,\na sync partnership, is already set up,\n\n206\n00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:58.440\nthen it allows you to synchronize data\nfrom your mobile device to your computer,\n\n207\n00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.870\nor from your computer to\nyour mobile device, right?\n\n208\n00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:04.450\nBut what you can also do\nis manage offline files.\n\n209\n00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:06.550\nAnd that's one of those\nthings that on the exam,\n\n210\n00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:08.760\nthey say,\nwhere do you manage offline files?\n\n211\n00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.400\nYou go to the Sync Center?\n\n212\n00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.380\nMight trick you up there.\n\n213\n00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.750\nSo we just want to show you that, right?\n\n214\n00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:16.640\nBut you'll notice that it says that,\nguess what?\n\n215\n00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.850\nUse offline files to keep\n\n216\n00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:23.110\ncopies on your computer of files\nstored on the network, right?\n\n217\n00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:25.690\nThis allows you to work with them\neven when you're not connected or\n\n218\n00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:27.060\nthe server is unavailable.\n\n219\n00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.610\nIn this case we've seen\nthat we weren't connected,\n\n220\n00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:32.260\nwhich made the server not available,\nright, they're kinda both.\n\n221\n00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.200\nBut even if you still\nhave network connections,\n\n222\n00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.450\nthat's another one that I didn't mention.\n\n223\n00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.310\nWhat happens if the server goes offline?\n\n224\n00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:40.800\nWell, the server goes offline,\nyou don't have access to your file, so\n\n225\n00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.030\nthis would also work in that scenario too.\n\n226\n00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.620\nAnd we're gonna enable it.\n\n227\n00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:48.610\nBut you'll notice when I enable it, it\nsays it's enabled but it's not active yet.\n\n228\n00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:51.560\nRight, underneath the hood\nWindows has to do a little\n\n229\n00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.880\nbit to get this turned on, right?\n\n230\n00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.450\nSo what we have to do is restart\nthe computer and activate online files.\n\n231\n00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.698\nSo we'll go ahead,\nlet me make sure that we say OK and\n\n232\n00:11:00.698 --> 00:11:05.190\nit's gonna ask me if we wanna restart the\ncomputer, I'm gonna go ahead and say yes.\n\n233\n00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:09.200\nAnd while that's restarting, let's jump\nover to our Windows 8 machine here, and\n\n234\n00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.940\nI wanted to show you,\nI've already got it pulled up, but\n\n235\n00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.350\nin the control panel, notice,\nsame control panel, right?\n\n236\n00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:19.490\nIf I was in Windows 7,\nit would be the same way.\n\n237\n00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:22.616\nYou just go to Control Panel, right?\n\n238\n00:11:22.616 --> 00:11:26.470\nAnd I've already kinda switched\nthis between the category view and\n\n239\n00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:28.170\nthe icon view, if you will.\n\n240\n00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:29.130\nAnd guess what?\n\n241\n00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:32.080\nSync Center is also right in the list.\n\n242\n00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:36.850\nAnd when you bring up Sync Center,\nnotice that it looks no different, right?\n\n243\n00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:40.830\nSo let's see, looks like okay,\nso we're back online.\n\n244\n00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:42.610\nIf you've been watching\nsome of our episodes,\n\n245\n00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:47.980\nyou'll notice that we did enable BitLocker\nfull drive encryption in another episode.\n\n246\n00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:51.790\nSo we're just continuing to use this\nmachine as we progress through our series\n\n247\n00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:53.920\nhere, our NTA series.\n\n248\n00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.800\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and\nwe'll get logged back into this machine.\n\n249\n00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:05.570\nAll right, and provided\n\n250\n00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:09.970\nI typed my super secret password right,\n[LAUGH] hopefully we will get logged in.\n\n251\n00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:10.810\nWe'll go ahead and\n\n252\n00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:16.880\nonce we get to the desktop we are going\nto go back to our Settings option.\n\n253\n00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:20.880\nAll right, and\nI'm just gonna go to System.\n\n254\n00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.170\nAnd from System I'm gonna\ngo to Power &amp; sleep and\n\n255\n00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:29.563\nthen from here we're gonna look at\nthose additional power settings, right?\n\n256\n00:12:29.563 --> 00:12:32.039\nNot a power settings episode, but\n\n257\n00:12:32.039 --> 00:12:36.310\nit's the way I like to bring\nup the original control panel.\n\n258\n00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:40.410\nAnd we're gonna go back to Control Panel\nusing the bread crumb trail,\n\n259\n00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:46.060\nchange this to large icons, and then we're\ngonna go to Sync Center again right here.\n\n260\n00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:46.990\nOnce we're in Sync Center,\n\n261\n00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:50.500\nnow notice that we have something extra\nthat we didn't have there before.\n\n262\n00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.870\nBut remember, this isn't just about\nenabling offline files, right?\n\n263\n00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:55.490\nYou can do more.\n\n264\n00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:57.850\nThat's why it's called\nManage offline files.\n\n265\n00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:01.500\nSo we can do things like,\nwell, open the Sync Center.\n\n266\n00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.760\nGood for us, we don't need to do that,\nit's already open here.\n\n267\n00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.810\nBut we can also view your offline files.\n\n268\n00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:12.288\nYou can also restrict how much\noffline files disk space is used,\n\n269\n00:13:12.288 --> 00:13:16.353\nright, and\nwe can change the limits if we want.\n\n270\n00:13:16.353 --> 00:13:19.137\nAnd that just says, well,\nhow much of the disk you want to use for\n\n271\n00:13:19.137 --> 00:13:20.620\noffline files, right?\n\n272\n00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:22.440\nI'm just gonna keep it at the default.\n\n273\n00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.040\nYou can delete temporary\nfiles here if you want.\n\n274\n00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.130\nBut we can also say, you know what, I want\nyou to encrypt the information, right?\n\n275\n00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:31.690\nUse EFS which we've talked\nabout in other episodes.\n\n276\n00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:32.730\nAnd then we could also say,\n\n277\n00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:37.830\nhey, check for a slow connection\nevery five minutes, right?\n\n278\n00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:42.290\nAnd this is whether it switches you\nto being offline or being online.\n\n279\n00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:48.770\nEven in slow performance type situation,\nyou might want it to kick over to offline,\n\n280\n00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:52.010\nbasically assuming that you're offline,\ngiving you access to your information.\n\n281\n00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:54.050\nSo, that's some of the other settings.\n\n282\n00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:58.680\nSo what do we actually do here\nwhen we use offline files?\n\n283\n00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.830\nAll right, well, if I right-click and\nI choose Open, well,\n\n284\n00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:04.360\nI don't really have anything in here,\nright.\n\n285\n00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.040\nSo how do we make that available?\n\n286\n00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.370\nHow do make storage01 available for us?\n\n287\n00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:11.150\nWell, let me show you how we do that,\nall right.\n\n288\n00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:14.030\nNow what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\ngo ahead and I'll tell you what,\n\n289\n00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:16.930\nI'll just kinda minimize Sync Center here.\n\n290\n00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:20.186\nAnd we're gonna open up\nour file explorer and\n\n291\n00:14:20.186 --> 00:14:25.080\nwe're gonna type in our same UNC path,\nconnected to Storage01.\n\n292\n00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.840\nAnd apparently,\nit's trying to do some http there.\n\n293\n00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:32.060\nYes, I got you.\n\n294\n00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:33.530\nLet's try that UNC path.\n\n295\n00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:34.830\nI don't know why it does that.\n\n296\n00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.939\nMaybe I wasn't holding my mouse right,\nguess what?\n\n297\n00:14:38.939 --> 00:14:40.790\nSo, I disconnected us from the network.\n\n298\n00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:42.130\nGuess what I forgot to do?\n\n299\n00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:43.180\nReconnect us to the network.\n\n300\n00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:45.200\nSo offline files still\nisn't gonna work here.\n\n301\n00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.637\nLet me go ahead and\njust re-enable the network adapter.\n\n302\n00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:49.910\n[LAUGH] Well, that's a swing and a miss.\n\n303\n00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:50.760\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n304\n00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.520\n&gt;&gt; When I open\nthe Network Sharing Center here,\n\n305\n00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.840\nChange adapter settings, and enable it.\n\n306\n00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.278\nIf you don't have network\nconnectivity offline at all,\n\n307\n00:14:57.278 --> 00:14:59.780\n[LAUGH] setting up offline\nfiles isn't gonna work for you.\n\n308\n00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.550\nI probably should have mentioned that too.\n\n309\n00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.340\nYou need a network connection\nto set up offline files.\n\n310\n00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:09.400\nAll right, so now that we've got a network\nconnection, we can close that down.\n\n311\n00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.130\nAnd what we can do here\nis in file explore,\n\n312\n00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:16.830\nnow we can type \\\\ and\nwe'll let it just fill this in for us.\n\n313\n00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:20.720\nAnd notice that I have access to the files\nagain, right, and I'm back online.\n\n314\n00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:26.110\nIf I go to DCO1, now what I can\ndo is I can right-click on this.\n\n315\n00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:30.310\nAnd notice this option here,\nAlways available offline.\n\n316\n00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:33.450\nGo ahead and we'll use it.\n\n317\n00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:35.120\nCompleted preparing those files.\n\n318\n00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.180\nIt kind of went fast, right?\n\n319\n00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:40.150\nBut I also want you to notice,\nnotice this little icon right here.\n\n320\n00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:44.268\nAll right, that icon lets me know\nthat I've got this folder set up for\n\n321\n00:15:44.268 --> 00:15:45.769\noffline files, right?\n\n322\n00:15:45.769 --> 00:15:48.569\nAnd I'll go ahead and\njust kind of minimize this, and\n\n323\n00:15:48.569 --> 00:15:52.068\nit usually puts a little icon down\nhere in your notification area.\n\n324\n00:15:52.068 --> 00:15:55.071\nNotice it says Sync Center and\nit says sync is complete right?\n\n325\n00:15:55.071 --> 00:15:57.124\nAnd that's important\nto understand as well.\n\n326\n00:15:57.124 --> 00:15:59.643\nSo let's go ahead.\n\n327\n00:15:59.643 --> 00:16:03.924\nAnd let's, I'll tell you what,\nlet's go ahead, and\n\n328\n00:16:03.924 --> 00:16:07.370\nwe'll disconnect from the network.\n\n329\n00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:09.090\nAll right?\nSo open network and sharing centers,\n\n330\n00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:10.790\nwhere we've been for awhile, right?\n\n331\n00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:13.550\nWe'll go back here, ethernet.\n\n332\n00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:16.737\nAnd nothing like hitting a door\nto lead to another door.\n\n333\n00:16:16.737 --> 00:16:18.683\nNetwork and sharing center again.\n\n334\n00:16:18.683 --> 00:16:24.920\nAnd we'll hit our properties of our\nnetwork adapter, and we will disable it.\n\n335\n00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:29.730\nAll right, so let's go ahead,\nand let's close all of this down.\n\n336\n00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:32.490\nAnd we'll open up our File Explorer again.\n\n337\n00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:33.970\nLet me close all of this down here.\n\n338\n00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:36.793\nAnd I'm gonna type \\\\, all right?\n\n339\n00:16:36.793 --> 00:16:40.127\nAnd let me just make sure that you know\nthis isn't a don't look at the man\n\n340\n00:16:40.127 --> 00:16:42.530\nbehind the curtain,\nA Wizard of Oz thing going on.\n\n341\n00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:45.130\nIf you look,\nmy head's kind of covering this up, but\n\n342\n00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:48.440\ndown in the lower right hand portion,\ndo you see that it says not connected?\n\n343\n00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.630\nNo connections are available.\n\n344\n00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.030\nJust want to make sure\nthat you realize that.\n\n345\n00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:53.050\nThat we are not connected.\n\n346\n00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:57.770\nAnd when I browse to that UNC path,\nit's available.\n\n347\n00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:58.760\nIt wasn't available before.\n\n348\n00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.370\nRemember I got the network error?\n\n349\n00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:02.230\nAnd that's the benefit of offline files.\n\n350\n00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:05.180\nI'm not connected to the network,\nI'm not connected to the server, yet\n\n351\n00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:06.810\nI still have access to my information.\n\n352\n00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.480\nThat is what allows you the ability,\n\n353\n00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.250\nessentially, to maintain\na level of productivity.\n\n354\n00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:15.490\nSo that's important, right?\n\n355\n00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:18.796\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And now, after all of that-\n\n356\n00:17:18.796 --> 00:17:19.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n357\n00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:20.840\n&gt;&gt; Comes libraries.\n\n358\n00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.798\nWe get to talk about\nthe title of the episode.\n\n359\n00:17:22.798 --> 00:17:25.170\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n360\n00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:28.715\nLibraries are a great way, and\nit's right here in File Explorer here.\n\n361\n00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:31.920\nSo the good thing is we're\nalready where we need to be.\n\n362\n00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:37.314\nLibraries are a way that you can\ngroup different locations together,\n\n363\n00:17:37.314 --> 00:17:42.446\nand have access to them under\na single icon if you will, all right?\n\n364\n00:17:42.446 --> 00:17:43.890\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n365\n00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:48.110\nNow, there's a couple of different things\nI want you to be aware of, all right?\n\n366\n00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:52.390\nLibraries typically are seen,\nand let me kinda collapse these.\n\n367\n00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:57.400\nLibraries are typically seen here\nin the Explore bar, all right?\n\n368\n00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:03.600\nAnd let me show you what I mean by\nswitching over to Windows 8.1, all right?\n\n369\n00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.960\nNotice in Windows 8.1,\n\n370\n00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:12.240\nwe do not have libraries\nanywhere in this list, all right?\n\n371\n00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:17.708\nSo it is important to understand that in\nWindows 7 libraries are shown by default.\n\n372\n00:18:17.708 --> 00:18:22.280\nIn Windows 8.1 and Windows 10,\nthey aren't shown by default.\n\n373\n00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.210\nBut we can change that.\n\n374\n00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:28.202\nAnd this is where that folder options\ncomes in to play for us, right?\n\n375\n00:18:28.202 --> 00:18:29.880\nRemember we've talked\nabout folder options, and\n\n376\n00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:33.020\nhow you could change the default\nof view of File Explorer.\n\n377\n00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.890\nThere's a reason I keep pointing you guys,\nand gals out there to it.\n\n378\n00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:37.530\nYou need to be aware of it, right?\n\n379\n00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:43.649\nSo we're gonna go to our ribbon, we're\ngonna go to View, and we'll go to Options.\n\n380\n00:18:43.649 --> 00:18:47.580\nAnd in folder Options, I want you\nto notice the navigation pane here.\n\n381\n00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:51.397\nI'm still used to calling it the explore\npane, but it's the navigation pane, right?\n\n382\n00:18:51.397 --> 00:18:53.570\nIt just changed names over the years,\nright?\n\n383\n00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:55.748\nNotice, it says Show libraries, right?\n\n384\n00:18:55.748 --> 00:18:58.895\nOnce we choose show libraries,\nand choose OK,\n\n385\n00:18:58.895 --> 00:19:02.810\nnotice that we now have\na Libraries drop down menu.\n\n386\n00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:06.980\nAnd this might look like all of the\ndefault locations we talked about in other\n\n387\n00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.200\nepisodes, when it comes\nto the user profile.\n\n388\n00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.840\nAll right, so I want you to keep in\nmind were that was located again.\n\n389\n00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.430\nNotice, that it is under Options, right?\n\n390\n00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:19.540\nAnd then under Folder Options,\nit's under the General tab, right?\n\n391\n00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:22.590\nIt isn't the same way in Windows 10,\nall right?\n\n392\n00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:25.470\nIn Windows 10,\nif we switch back over to our Windows 10.\n\n393\n00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:29.880\nWhat Windows 10 did, is they kind of,\nwell, they disabled showing libraries by\n\n394\n00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:33.050\ndefault, that's just the way that happens,\nall right?\n\n395\n00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:37.740\nBecause they replaced it with Quick\naccess, right, this Quick access menu.\n\n396\n00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:42.040\nBut you still have the chance\nto create a library if you want.\n\n397\n00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:45.660\nYou just have to go back to the View\noption in the Option bar up here.\n\n398\n00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:50.080\nIt brings up the ribbon, and yes,\nwe're going back to Options one more time.\n\n399\n00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.845\nBut I want you to notice something.\n\n400\n00:19:51.845 --> 00:19:57.126\nBecause they introduced Quick access,\nthat is the icons that you get,\n\n401\n00:19:57.126 --> 00:20:02.508\nor the the check boxes that you get to\nmanipulate here on the General tab.\n\n402\n00:20:02.508 --> 00:20:06.621\nAnd this is why I wanted to take the time\nto show you this because it's on\n\n403\n00:20:06.621 --> 00:20:08.591\na different tab in Windows 10.\n\n404\n00:20:08.591 --> 00:20:13.090\nWe go to the View tab, and\nwe scroll all the way to the bottom.\n\n405\n00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:17.680\nAnd I do mean, all the way to the bottom,\nall right, is Show library.\n\n406\n00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.566\nI don't want that to trick you out cuz\nI definitely want you to understand\n\n407\n00:20:20.566 --> 00:20:23.089\na library, and who knows,\nthey might ask you to configure it.\n\n408\n00:20:23.089 --> 00:20:25.720\nI'm not sure, but\nwe want you to be prepared.\n\n409\n00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:30.110\nAnd now, I have the same drop down list\nthat I had in the other operating system.\n\n410\n00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:31.810\nLike I said,\nWindows 7 shows it by default.\n\n411\n00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:33.460\nThere's no manipulations,\nyou have to do it, and\n\n412\n00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:37.560\nthe configurations will be the same\nacross all three operating systems.\n\n413\n00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:38.410\nSo what do I mean by that?\n\n414\n00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:40.162\nAll right?\nWell, let's go ahead,\n\n415\n00:20:40.162 --> 00:20:42.660\nand let's create a new library, all right?\n\n416\n00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.683\nNotice, that this library is Documents,\n\n417\n00:20:45.683 --> 00:20:50.520\nthis library is just Music,\nthis library is Pictures.\n\n418\n00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:55.770\nBut what if I say,\nI think I wanna have another library.\n\n419\n00:20:55.770 --> 00:21:00.160\nIn fact, let me go ahead, I've already\nmade some libraries here before.\n\n420\n00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.909\nLet me go, and\njust delete this real quick.\n\n421\n00:21:04.186 --> 00:21:07.970\nAll right, and let's go ahead, and\nlet's make a new library, right?\n\n422\n00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:09.940\nSo we're gonna right-click\non the library part,\n\n423\n00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:13.060\nthe highest part of\nthe navigation pane here.\n\n424\n00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:16.600\nAnd we'll choose New Library,\nand I'll call this, well,\n\n425\n00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:20.610\nI don't know, I'll call it what I\ncalled the other one, My Stuff.\n\n426\n00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:21.845\nRight, cuz I am that creative.\n\n427\n00:21:21.845 --> 00:21:25.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now, what I can do now is right-click\n\n428\n00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:30.620\non the library that I've created,\nand I can choose Properties.\n\n429\n00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:35.147\nAnd when you choose Properties,\nyou have the option to add a location,\n\n430\n00:21:35.147 --> 00:21:37.713\nas well as optimizing your libraries for\n\n431\n00:21:37.713 --> 00:21:41.040\nthe different types of data\nthat you'll hold in it.\n\n432\n00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.220\nI'm just gonna say General items, right?\n\n433\n00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:44.665\nAnd I'm going to choose add.\n\n434\n00:21:44.665 --> 00:21:46.113\nAnd then it's going to ask me,\n\n435\n00:21:46.113 --> 00:21:48.745\nwhat folders do you want to\nadd to your library, right?\n\n436\n00:21:48.745 --> 00:21:53.349\nWell, I'm gonna say, I want to add,\nlet's add documents, and\n\n437\n00:21:53.349 --> 00:21:55.880\nI'll include this folder.\n\n438\n00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:03.220\nAnd I'm gonna add, not Offline Files,\nmaybe I want the Downloads folder too.\n\n439\n00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.470\nRight, I want that to be, that's my stuff,\nmy documents, and my downloads.\n\n440\n00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:09.390\nI want them all in the same location,\nand I choose OK.\n\n441\n00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:12.680\nWell now, when I look under my stuff,\n\n442\n00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:18.030\nI have two different locations\ngrouped together in my library, right?\n\n443\n00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:22.310\nWhich tells me that if I go to Documents,\nand I choose New,\n\n444\n00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.380\nand I create, and I'm not going to name\nthese, I create a few documents here.\n\n445\n00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:32.600\nAnd then, if I go to Downloads, and\n\n446\n00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:37.060\nI create maybe a new folder,\nwe'll call it Test.\n\n447\n00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:41.100\nNow, if I come down to My Stuff,\nnotice how I grouped them all together,\n\n448\n00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:45.800\nI can see Offline Files, New Text\nDocument New rich text document and\n\n449\n00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:48.500\nthen download the test folder.\n\n450\n00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:49.590\nThat's the benefit of a library.\n\n451\n00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:55.032\nThe library isn't so much as an actual\ncontainer, as it is a pointer\n\n452\n00:22:55.032 --> 00:23:01.150\nto containers, and it groups those\ntogether under one simple label, right?\n\n453\n00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:01.668\nGreat thing to have.\n\n454\n00:23:01.668 --> 00:23:06.698\nNow, there are other things\nthat you can do with these two.\n\n455\n00:23:06.698 --> 00:23:10.259\nI've kinda showed you, that you can\noptimize these, you can show them in\n\n456\n00:23:10.259 --> 00:23:14.127\nthe navigation pane, you can even change\nthe library icon if you want, right?\n\n457\n00:23:14.127 --> 00:23:19.242\nAnd if you change the icons,\nmaybe I want the UAC shield, all right?\n\n458\n00:23:19.242 --> 00:23:23.630\nI want to make it look, hey that's my\nstuff, that's my shield, right, my crest.\n\n459\n00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:24.980\nWell, you can do that.\n\n460\n00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:30.520\nSo configurations of the library\nare really, it's a really handy thing.\n\n461\n00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.705\nAnd notice, that what we've done is we\ncould do a single library with a single\n\n462\n00:23:33.705 --> 00:23:36.799\nlocation or we could do multi-location\nlibraries like I've showed you.\n\n463\n00:23:36.799 --> 00:23:38.536\nI've shown you a multi-location, right?\n\n464\n00:23:38.536 --> 00:23:42.570\nAnd this might give you a little\nbit better, quicker access, right?\n\n465\n00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:44.350\nJust by opening up File Explorer, and\n\n466\n00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:48.380\nI can get to those locations just\nby clicking on that single library.\n\n467\n00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:51.220\nAll right,\na lot of things that we've covered today.\n\n468\n00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:54.595\nBut do keep in mind some of the little\nspecifics that we've shown you.\n\n469\n00:23:54.595 --> 00:23:59.134\nThat in the interfaces, while most often\nthe major configurations are the same,\n\n470\n00:23:59.134 --> 00:24:02.752\nthere are just little,\nlittle small things that are different,\n\n471\n00:24:02.752 --> 00:24:04.823\nbetween the different interfaces.\n\n472\n00:24:04.823 --> 00:24:07.645\nAnd I'm not sure which one\nthey're gonna ask you on,\n\n473\n00:24:07.645 --> 00:24:10.040\nso we want you to be aware\nof all of them there.\n\n474\n00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.800\nThese are some of the things you have\nto know when configuring libraries so\n\n475\n00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.448\nwhen you sit that MTA exam,\nyou'll be doing well.\n\n476\n00:24:15.448 --> 00:24:18.715\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful job, Mr.\nLibrarian, understanding libraries,\n\n477\n00:24:18.715 --> 00:24:22.358\nanother great episode inside\nthe MTA Windows OS Fundamental series.\n\n478\n00:24:22.358 --> 00:24:23.710\nMake sure you watch all of them.\n\n479\n00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:24.820\nThey're good for you, and\n\n480\n00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.590\nWes has done a great job putting all\nof that information together for you.\n\n481\n00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:28.980\nYou're gonna be in the course library too.\n\n482\n00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:32.200\nThere's thousands of videos there,\nall designed to help you go further,\n\n483\n00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.620\nso check that out too.\n\n484\n00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:35.170\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n485\n00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:37.350\nITProTV

00:00:17.098\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.098 --> 00:00:19.642\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:19.642 --> 00:00:23.040\nwell we're continuing on with more in\nour MTA for Windows OS fundamentals.\n\n9\n00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.965\nAnd of course joining us in the studio yet\nagain, our good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:26.965 --> 00:00:27.807\nWes, welcome back, man.\n\n11\n00:00:27.807 --> 00:00:28.455\nHow's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:28.455 --> 00:00:29.145\n&gt;&gt; Man.\nIt's going great.\n\n13\n00:00:29.145 --> 00:00:29.805\nGreat to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:29.805 --> 00:00:30.305\nThat's right.\n\n15\n00:00:30.305 --> 00:00:32.565\nWe are going to be looking at,\nwell, storage, right.\n\n16\n00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:36.385\nIt is important to understand that the\noptions that you have, as well as some of\n\n17\n00:00:36.385 --> 00:00:40.095\nthe things that you can configure inside\nof your Windows operating system.\n\n18\n00:00:40.095 --> 00:00:42.285\nThat's what we're gonna be\nlooking at here in this episode.\n\n19\n00:00:42.285 --> 00:00:43.185\nAnd what we're gonna do is,\n\n20\n00:00:43.185 --> 00:00:47.290\nwe're gonna be using a couple of utilities\nin order to allow that to happen.\n\n21\n00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.160\nIn other episodes,\n\n22\n00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.740\nwe talked about some of the administrative\ntools that we have, right?\n\n23\n00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.270\nThe administrative utilities that we\nuse in order to, basically, manage and\n\n24\n00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.980\nmaintain a Windows environment.\n\n25\n00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.414\nAnd one of those utilities that we\nmentioned is something known as\n\n26\n00:00:58.414 --> 00:00:59.128\nDisc Management.\n\n27\n00:00:59.128 --> 00:01:00.715\nIt's actually got its own location.\n\n28\n00:01:00.715 --> 00:01:01.675\nIn the operating system,\n\n29\n00:01:01.675 --> 00:01:05.035\nas well as being a part of the computer\nmanagement interface, too.\n\n30\n00:01:05.035 --> 00:01:07.785\nSo we're gonna be using disk management\n\n31\n00:01:07.785 --> 00:01:12.635\ninside of our operating system today as\nwe talk about things like disk types and\n\n32\n00:01:12.635 --> 00:01:17.565\nsome of the different concepts\nthat you have to be aware of.\n\n33\n00:01:17.565 --> 00:01:19.355\nAnd that is the graphical user interface.\n\n34\n00:01:19.355 --> 00:01:21.625\nIn fact, let me go ahead and\nshow you what I mean here.\n\n35\n00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:26.310\nI'm on a Windows 8.1 machine, and if I\ndive down into I could launch this from\n\n36\n00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.720\ncomputer management, or\nI could launch it by itself.\n\n37\n00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.610\nEither way,\nthe same interface is going to open up.\n\n38\n00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.920\nWell let me say that\na little bit differently.\n\n39\n00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.980\nIf I open up computer management,\nremember,\n\n40\n00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.430\nwe've kind of talked about Computer\nManagement having multiple utilities in\n\n41\n00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.590\nthere, and one of the utilities\nhere is Disk Management.\n\n42\n00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.010\nAnd if I open that up you'll see that\nthey're pretty much the same interface.\n\n43\n00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.950\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nclose down Computer Management,\n\n44\n00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.580\nwe'll just stay in Disk Management here.\n\n45\n00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.530\nThis is the graphical user interface,\n\n46\n00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.200\nthat you utilize in order to manage\nthe storage on your machine.\n\n47\n00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.530\nNow, there's also a command line version.\n\n48\n00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.300\nRight?\nThere's a command line utility that we\n\n49\n00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.040\nhave in order to manage and\nmaintain our storage in a windows system.\n\n50\n00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.690\nAnd, if we go ahead, and I'll just\nright click on our Windows charm here,\n\n51\n00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.240\nif you will.\n\n52\n00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:20.150\nI'll choose administrative command prompt,\nand we'll go ahead and dive into our.\n\n53\n00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:22.420\nCommand prompt here.\n\n54\n00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.130\nAll right, so let me go ahead and\nclear the screen off.\n\n55\n00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.510\nAnd what we're talking about is\nsomething known as diskpart.\n\n56\n00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.130\ndiskpart is a utility that is through the\ncommand line that allows you to manage and\n\n57\n00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.860\nmaintain.\n\n58\n00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.660\nThe storage that you\nhave on your machines.\n\n59\n00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.890\n&gt;&gt; This is an old school, right,\nwe're going way back in the day and\n\n60\n00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:39.930\nstarting with the foundations.\n\n61\n00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and when you have somebody\nsitting next to you, that you live in\n\n62\n00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.900\na command line and I know Dan uses\nLinux operating systems pretty heavily.\n\n63\n00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.160\nWell, one of the things that you'll\nunderstand and I know you understand this\n\n64\n00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.010\nsometimes there is more functionality\nin the command prompt or\n\n65\n00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.890\nin a command line interpreter because when\nyou have a graphical user interface I will\n\n66\n00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.960\ntell you that for the most part they do\na really good job in giving you all these\n\n67\n00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.750\ndifferent options that you can do right\nclick we get graphical user interface but.\n\n68\n00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.390\n&gt;&gt; There are some things that are, it's\nlimited, some things that it can't do.\n\n69\n00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.590\nSo I wouldn't worry about some of the more\nadvanced stuff that you can do in this\n\n70\n00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.990\npart, but keep in mind that it does\nhave a little bit more functionality\n\n71\n00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.440\ninside of the command prompt, but\nI will tell you that syntax is everything.\n\n72\n00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.370\nSo we're gonna be looking\nat those two utilities.\n\n73\n00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.710\nNow, one of the first things I wanna talk\nabout are what are known as disk types.\n\n74\n00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.100\nAll right, when we talk about disk types,\n\n75\n00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.680\nyou have two different disk types inside\nof your Windows operating system,\n\n76\n00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.250\nwhat's known as a basic disk and\nwhat's known as a dynamic disk.\n\n77\n00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.250\nAll right?\n\n78\n00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.900\nNow what's a basic disk?\n\n79\n00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.710\nAll right?\nWell,\n\n80\n00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.350\na basic disk is what follows\na partitioning format.\n\n81\n00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.360\nRight?\nWhat's a partition?\n\n82\n00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.390\nA partition is a logical division\nof a physical hard drive, right?\n\n83\n00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.790\nIf we want to let's think of a house,\nright?\n\n84\n00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.390\nIf I look at a house and\nI look at it from the sky, right?\n\n85\n00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.160\nAll I'm gonna see is a single house,\n\n86\n00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.590\nprovided it still has the roof on it,\nright?\n\n87\n00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.420\nI'm gonna see a single building.\n\n88\n00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.415\nBut we know that if we walk into that\nhouse going through the front door.\n\n89\n00:04:06.415 --> 00:04:10.425\nThat the house is actually divided up into\ndifferent types of living quarters, right?\n\n90\n00:04:10.425 --> 00:04:13.445\nWe have the livingroom, the kitchen,\nseries of bathrooms, right?\n\n91\n00:04:13.445 --> 00:04:17.725\nWell it's because the architecture, or\nthe architect designed it that way.\n\n92\n00:04:17.725 --> 00:04:19.215\nStill one house, right?\n\n93\n00:04:19.215 --> 00:04:23.205\nBut it is logically divided up\ninto multiple living spaces.\n\n94\n00:04:23.205 --> 00:04:24.365\nWell your hard drives are the same way.\n\n95\n00:04:24.365 --> 00:04:26.390\nYou have one physical drive and\n\n96\n00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.940\nwhat you need to do is you need to\nstart formatting them in a way.\n\n97\n00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.100\nYou need to divide them up, or\ncan divide them up based on, well,\n\n98\n00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.530\nhow you want to,\nlike the architect, right?\n\n99\n00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.210\nHow you want to structure them, right?\n\n100\n00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.160\nAnd that's where we get into what's\nknown as partitioning, all right?\n\n101\n00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.600\nPartitioning, again, is a logical\ndivision of a physical hard drive.\n\n102\n00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.920\nNow, if you have a basic disk, there\nis another limitation to basic disks.\n\n103\n00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.410\nBasic disks have a limitation\nof four partitions, right?\n\n104\n00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.530\nMore specifically,\nfour primary partitions.\n\n105\n00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.660\nBecause we also have to talk about\na primary partition, all right?\n\n106\n00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.210\nWhat is a primary partition?\n\n107\n00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.350\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n108\n00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.480\nSo in disk management,\nI have a basic disk.\n\n109\n00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.550\nRight, and\nwe have a couple of partitions, right,\n\n110\n00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.910\nwe have this logical containers\nof this hard drive, right.\n\n111\n00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.530\nFirst is a system reserve partition.\n\n112\n00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.400\nThis is one that sounds exactly what it\nis, exactly what it sounds like right.\n\n113\n00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.530\nWindows puts certain files within this\npartition and kind of protects it, so\n\n114\n00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.520\nthat you can use other technologies like,\nfor\n\n115\n00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.670\ninstance something we'll talk about just\nbriefly here, BitLocker drive encryption.\n\n116\n00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:26.340\nRight?\n\n117\n00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.530\nBut then I have local Disc C, notice\nthat I have another logical division.\n\n118\n00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.950\nNow this division, I can't really use,\nthe system reserved one, but I do have C:.\n\n119\n00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.920\nYou can see C: here, and\nit's just around 60 gigabytes.\n\n120\n00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.450\nAnd I know that's kinda funny today,\ncuz we have terabytes of storage.\n\n121\n00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.890\nBut notice that I have\nthis logical division.\n\n122\n00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:44.510\nWell what is a primary partition?\n\n123\n00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.505\nNotice that it says primary partition\nhere, what does that mean, all right?\n\n124\n00:05:48.505 --> 00:05:52.075\nWell primary partition just means\nthat we have applied a file system.\n\n125\n00:05:52.075 --> 00:05:55.625\nNow in other episodes we'll\ntalk about file systems, right.\n\n126\n00:05:55.625 --> 00:05:58.857\nBasically think of a file\nsystem as a logical structure,\n\n127\n00:05:58.857 --> 00:06:02.435\nall right,\nwithin that logical division, right?\n\n128\n00:06:02.435 --> 00:06:06.625\nI divide up the hard drives, but then I\nneed a way to actually use that space.\n\n129\n00:06:06.625 --> 00:06:10.130\nJust because I divided it up,\ndoesn't make it ready to use.\n\n130\n00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.030\nI have to apply a file\nsystem to that division.\n\n131\n00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.330\n&gt;&gt; It's like setting the rules for\nhow the drive can be used,\n\n132\n00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.740\nat least that partition of the drive.\n\n133\n00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:19.370\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n134\n00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:20.550\nYou know one of the things I think of,\n\n135\n00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.400\nDan, when I think of applying a files\nsystem, I think of a filing cabinet.\n\n136\n00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.760\nAll right, if you take a filing cabinet.\n\n137\n00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.770\nLet’s take everything out\nof the filing cabinet.\n\n138\n00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.336\nWe just got this blank shelf, all right.\n\n139\n00:06:30.336 --> 00:06:33.934\nIt’s kind of like what your hard drive is,\nright, but what do we have to do,\n\n140\n00:06:33.934 --> 00:06:35.752\nwe start to add some shelves, right?\n\n141\n00:06:35.752 --> 00:06:37.680\nIf we add some shelves\nto that filing cabinet.\n\n142\n00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.490\nThink of those as your partitions,\nbut if I open that shelf, right, and\n\n143\n00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.590\nif I look at it I can’t really, I mean I\nguess I could store stuff in there it’s\n\n144\n00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.120\nnot going to be very efficient, right.\n\n145\n00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.371\nI can’t use it, so what do I have to do.\n\n146\n00:06:48.371 --> 00:06:51.320\nI have to put the guide rails in there and\nwe have to drop folders in there.\n\n147\n00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.550\nAnd we drop folders.\n\n148\n00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.560\nAnd once we have folders in there,\nthen we can put files in, and\n\n149\n00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.170\nwe can start to arrange it\nthe way we want, right.\n\n150\n00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.900\nWell, that's kind of\nlike piling a file system\n\n151\n00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.060\nto the partition that we've created.\n\n152\n00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:04.240\nAnd a primary partition is just one\nthat has that file system applied to it.\n\n153\n00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.740\nNow, going back to basic disks.\n\n154\n00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.700\nThey call them basic disks for a reason.\n\n155\n00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.165\nThey support a basic partitioning scheme,\nall right?\n\n156\n00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:15.570\nWell, we mean by that is you can\nhave four primary partitions.\n\n157\n00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.540\nWell, that's a limitation.\n\n158\n00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:22.080\nThat's a limitation that Microsoft\nalso implemented ways that we could\n\n159\n00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.520\nkind of get around that four\nprimary partition limitation.\n\n160\n00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.440\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n161\n00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.400\nSo let's take a disk.\n\n162\n00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.000\nIt is a basic disk.\n\n163\n00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.030\nAnd we're gonna start to\ndivide up the space, right?\n\n164\n00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.830\nI just got a 20 gig disk here,\nright, just to show you.\n\n165\n00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.570\nDoesn't matter if this thing said\n4 terabytes next to it, right?\n\n166\n00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:41.700\nIt would be the same process.\n\n167\n00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.353\nNow, when I right click,\n\n168\n00:07:43.353 --> 00:07:47.121\nI can actually create what's\nknown as a New Sample Volume.\n\n169\n00:07:47.121 --> 00:07:51.108\nAll right, and when we right click that,\nwe'll choose Next, and it's gonna ask us.\n\n170\n00:07:51.108 --> 00:07:54.053\nHere's where we define how\nbig is that shelf gonna be?\n\n171\n00:07:54.053 --> 00:07:55.276\nHow long is the shelf gonna be?\n\n172\n00:07:55.276 --> 00:07:59.650\nWe're gonna start to logically divide\nup the space on this hard drive.\n\n173\n00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:02.797\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna reduce this in size, for\n\n174\n00:08:02.797 --> 00:08:04.150\ndemonstration purposes.\n\n175\n00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:09.670\nI'm gonna basically make this 10 gigs,\na 10 gig partition.\n\n176\n00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.390\nNow, we got to assign a drive letter.\n\n177\n00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.830\nYou might hear this known\nas a mounting point.\n\n178\n00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.590\nIf I have a house but\nI don't have a front door or\n\n179\n00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:19.730\nany windows,\nI can't really get into the house.\n\n180\n00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:23.215\nNo entry point into the house\nto be able to utilize it.\n\n181\n00:08:23.215 --> 00:08:27.570\nYou need an entry point into a partition\nin order to be able to use it.\n\n182\n00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:31.300\nSo that's the first thing,\nwe're making a front door if you will, and\n\n183\n00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.890\nwe'll choose Next.\n\n184\n00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:37.850\nNow, here's where we have to define what\nfile system are we gonna apply to it?\n\n185\n00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.460\nWe're gonna turn this in\nto a primary partition, and\n\n186\n00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:41.990\nwe've got a couple of options.\n\n187\n00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:45.180\nAgain, look at our episodes where we talk\nabout the difference between things like\n\n188\n00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:50.600\nFAT, FAT 32, NTFS and even resilient\nfile system, REFS today too.\n\n189\n00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.620\nBut I am going to go ahead and I'm going\nto apply the default file system for\n\n190\n00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.880\na Windows machine, and that is NTFS.\n\n191\n00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.320\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna kinda just call this Prim1.\n\n192\n00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:05.980\nNow we have some options here if we're\ncreating this we could do a quick format.\n\n193\n00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.200\nSo what's the difference\nbetween a quick format and\n\n194\n00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.360\nclearing this little check mark.\n\n195\n00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.110\nWell, inside of your operating system,\n\n196\n00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:17.500\nyou have a disk checking utility\ncalled check disk, imagine that.\n\n197\n00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.072\nAnd if I say, do a quick format.\n\n198\n00:09:20.072 --> 00:09:26.680\nIt says, just go ahead and do a high level\nformat, erase everything on that drive.\n\n199\n00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:30.120\nAnd apply this new file system,\nbut don't check the disc for\n\n200\n00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.510\nerrors, that's the quick format.\n\n201\n00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.030\nIf you uncheck this,\nwhat it does is it, literally,\n\n202\n00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:39.670\nwill check every sector of that drive for\npotential errors.\n\n203\n00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:42.980\nMarking those sectors as\nbad when it finds them, and\n\n204\n00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:49.450\nthen not allowing the operating system to\nallocate your files to those locations.\n\n205\n00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:53.470\nI've never really had any problems in\na home environment with quick format.\n\n206\n00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:55.890\nBut if you're gonna be doing this for\nmission critical systems,\n\n207\n00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:59.050\nyou might wanna do the full format.\n\n208\n00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:03.287\nYou're not a quick format and if you're\ntalking about terabytes of data or\n\n209\n00:10:03.287 --> 00:10:07.268\nterabytes of space, it could take a while,\nso just keep that in mind.\n\n210\n00:10:07.268 --> 00:10:08.577\nWe're gonna call this Prim1,\n\n211\n00:10:08.577 --> 00:10:11.150\nbecause we're creating a primary\npartition on this machine.\n\n212\n00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:17.230\nIn it, you will see now we have Prim 1,\nnotice that we have NTFS and\n\n213\n00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:19.512\nnotice that we have a primary partition.\n\n214\n00:10:19.512 --> 00:10:24.190\nAnd again, very basic, primary partition\njust means it has a file system.\n\n215\n00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:26.383\nOnce it has a file system,\nwe have a mounting point.\n\n216\n00:10:26.383 --> 00:10:28.259\nAnd if I come into File Explorer,\n\n217\n00:10:28.259 --> 00:10:31.080\nnotice that I can now start\nto use this partition.\n\n218\n00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.060\nBut that's not the entire drive,\nthat's not the entire disk.\n\n219\n00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:39.960\nI can't see the other, what they\ncall unalocated space unless I'm in\n\n220\n00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.900\ndisk management, or\nif you're in disk part.\n\n221\n00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.430\nSo let's go ahead and lets do this again.\n\n222\n00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:47.450\nLet's create another simple volume.\n\n223\n00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:51.909\nAnd this time, I'm gonna go ahead and I'm\ngonna really scale this one down [LAUGH]\n\n224\n00:10:51.909 --> 00:10:54.021\nand I'm gonna do two gig partitions.\n\n225\n00:10:54.021 --> 00:10:56.850\nAnd we're gonna ahead and\nwe'll give it the same mounting point.\n\n226\n00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:00.465\nWe're creating the front door or\na door to that room, so we can use it.\n\n227\n00:11:00.465 --> 00:11:01.670\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; We'll choose Next.\n\n228\n00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:05.241\nWe going to call this Prim2.\n\n229\n00:11:05.241 --> 00:11:08.635\nAnd we going to go ahead and just leave\nit to the default allocation size, and\n\n230\n00:11:08.635 --> 00:11:10.400\nwe will choose Next, and then Finish.\n\n231\n00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.290\nNow we have two primary partitions.\n\n232\n00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:15.370\nWe are going to keep doing this, and\n\n233\n00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:17.530\nI want you to see what\nheads up happening here.\n\n234\n00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:19.630\nWe're gonna make another one, and again,\n\n235\n00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:22.590\nthis is gonna be another\ntwo gig partition.\n\n236\n00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:25.710\nAnd again,\nwe're gonna apply a mounting point and\n\n237\n00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:29.485\na file system to it and\nwe'll call this Prim3.\n\n238\n00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:34.860\nAnd we'll do the same thing,\nQuick Format and we'll choose Finish.\n\n239\n00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.800\nNow we'll notice that we have\nthree primary partitions.\n\n240\n00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.730\nNotice that this is a primary partition on\na basic disc and notice the blue color.\n\n241\n00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:44.810\nThe colors are important,\nthey might give you an exhibit\n\n242\n00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:47.920\non the exam that basically says\nwhat kind of partition is this?\n\n243\n00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.170\nAnd you have to know about the color.\n\n244\n00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:52.250\n&gt;&gt; So,\nif we see that it's regular dark type blue\n\n245\n00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:55.140\nthen we locking a basic primary partition?\n\n246\n00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:55.950\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yes sir.\n\n247\n00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:59.370\nAnd I am gonna show you what difference\nwould be if you create a simple volume on\n\n248\n00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:00.040\na dynamic disc.\n\n249\n00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.530\nWe'll get to dynamic\ndiscs here in a second.\n\n250\n00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:05.370\nSo, let's go ahead and\nlet's create another.\n\n251\n00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:09.640\nRemember, I told you that if\nyou're using a basic disk,\n\n252\n00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.370\nyou have a limit of four\nprimary partitions and no more.\n\n253\n00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:14.850\nLet's go ahead and see if that's the case.\n\n254\n00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:17.080\nWe'll see if we can create any more.\n\n255\n00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.240\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna max this out, and\n\n256\n00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.860\nwe'll create four primary partitions.\n\n257\n00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.890\nWe're doing the same thing, two gigs here.\n\n258\n00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:27.760\nAnd we're gonna call this Prim4.\n\n259\n00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:33.896\nAnd I'm going to choose Finish,\nwhat's happened here.\n\n260\n00:12:33.896 --> 00:12:37.000\nWe got some different colors in the mix,\nwhat's going on?\n\n261\n00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:42.150\nMicrosoft knew that there was a limitation\nof four primary partitions based on\n\n262\n00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:45.530\na certain boot record certain boot\nstructure that's called, MBR,\n\n263\n00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:46.370\nMaster Boot Record.\n\n264\n00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:50.980\nThose of you that are coming over from A+\nmay be you know that your BIOS looks for\n\n265\n00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:53.250\nboot code to bootstrap\nthe operating system.\n\n266\n00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:56.790\nWell, if you have a basic disk,\nyou're following that MBR for\n\n267\n00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:58.230\nprimary partition limitation.\n\n268\n00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:01.160\nSo Microsoft, they came up with\nsomething intelligent, really smart.\n\n269\n00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.230\nThey said you know what?\n\n270\n00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:05.340\nWe'll give you three primary partitions\nand when you create the fourth primary\n\n271\n00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:09.120\npartition what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna create a logical division.\n\n272\n00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.320\nWe'll call it an extended partition.\n\n273\n00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.040\nAnd inside of that extended partition,\n\n274\n00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.610\nyou can create what are known\nas logical volumes.\n\n275\n00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:18.200\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n276\n00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.070\nIn fact, I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna delete this volume.\n\n277\n00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:22.370\nAnd I want you to notice something.\n\n278\n00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:26.430\nDan, do you see this here, how we've\ngot one, two, three primary partitions.\n\n279\n00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.640\nAnd then we've got this crazy green space.\n\n280\n00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; If I right-click on that,\n\n281\n00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:35.260\nnotice that it gives me the ability to,\nmy head's kinda covering it up, but\n\n282\n00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.150\nto delete the partition?\n\n283\n00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.730\n&gt;&gt; I see that.\n&gt;&gt; It's because when you got to that\n\n284\n00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:43.100\nfourth one, to get around, it said\nlet's create an extended partition.\n\n285\n00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:46.690\nNow that's another type of partition that\nallows you to get around the full primary\n\n286\n00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.350\npartition limit.\n\n287\n00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:52.200\nAnd this is like taking a room within\nyour house and putting cubicles in it.\n\n288\n00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.990\nYou still have a divided space but now\nwhat you're gonna do is you're just gonna\n\n289\n00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:59.540\nlogically divide that space\nby adding cubicles into it.\n\n290\n00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:02.610\nSo let me go ahead and\nI will change this out a little bit and\n\n291\n00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:04.330\nthen we're gonna drop down\nto the command prompt.\n\n292\n00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:07.200\nAnd I'll show you what I mean because,\nremember I told you\n\n293\n00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.020\nthat disk management has some of\nthe limitations that you can't really see.\n\n294\n00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.020\nBut you can see it down\ninto the command line.\n\n295\n00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.550\nI'll show you what I mean here,\nwe'll go ahead and\n\n296\n00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:18.070\nredo this and this time I'm going\nto do I'll do another two gig.\n\n297\n00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:22.110\nAnd we'll do 2048 and\nwe'll do Next, Next, Next but\n\n298\n00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:26.470\nthis time I'm gonna create,\nI'm gonna call it logical one.\n\n299\n00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:31.200\nBecause inside of an extended patition,\nthere are no longer primary petition,\n\n300\n00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.030\nso called basically logical\nvolumes if you will.\n\n301\n00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:41.700\nLogical patitions, let me go ahead and\nwe'll do another one here.\n\n302\n00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:45.870\nLast but not least, we'll go ahead and\nuse the rest of the space.\n\n303\n00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.930\nAnd we'll call this logical 2.\n\n304\n00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:52.900\nAnd we will dive down in and\nsee what's going on.\n\n305\n00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.090\nSo notice that I have these two divisions.\n\n306\n00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:59.020\nAnd I got this little green boundary\naround the last part of this hard drive\n\n307\n00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:00.300\nspace.\n\n308\n00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.760\nLet’s go ahead and\nlet’s drop down to our command prompt.\n\n309\n00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.560\nWe’ll run an administrative\ncommand prompt.\n\n310\n00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:09.550\nIt’s probably a good idea if\nyou’re running in this part\n\n311\n00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:12.400\nto launch an administrative\ncommand prompt.\n\n312\n00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.260\nAnd we’re going to go ahead and\nwe’ll type Disk part, or\n\n313\n00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.470\nI'll try to something thereabout.\n\n314\n00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:19.960\nAnd we will run a list disk command.\n\n315\n00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.820\nOn the exam, I don't expect you to know\nall of these little commands that we're\n\n316\n00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.030\nrunning, just understand that\nthe technology is there.\n\n317\n00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:27.290\nBecause they might ask you, out of these,\n\n318\n00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:30.370\nwhich can allow you to\nmanage your hard drives.\n\n319\n00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:32.700\nWhich one can allow you\nto manage your storage?\n\n320\n00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.610\nAnd you'll need to know disk\nmanagement and disk part.\n\n321\n00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:38.300\nNow notice that I can\nalso see the disks here.\n\n322\n00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.310\nIf we kinda zoom into this,\nnotice that I have Disk 0, 1, 2, and 3.\n\n323\n00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:46.525\nNotice we have Disk 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\n324\n00:15:46.525 --> 00:15:50.866\nAnd what I wanna do is I wanna\nactually select this disk right here.\n\n325\n00:15:50.866 --> 00:15:55.214\nAnd that's disk 1, so that we can\nlook at it inside a little bit more,\n\n326\n00:15:55.214 --> 00:15:57.074\nlook at its DNA, its makeup.\n\n327\n00:15:57.074 --> 00:16:01.103\nSo what I'm gonna do is a select disk.\n\n328\n00:16:01.103 --> 00:16:02.833\n1, all right?\n\n329\n00:16:02.833 --> 00:16:07.761\nAnd I'm gonna rerun the list disk command\nto verify that the little asterisk\n\n330\n00:16:07.761 --> 00:16:10.520\nsymbol is next to the appropriate disk.\n\n331\n00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:15.303\nThat's important, you wanna make sure\nthat you don't modify a disk that you\n\n332\n00:16:15.303 --> 00:16:17.446\ndon't expect unintentionally.\n\n333\n00:16:17.446 --> 00:16:21.096\nAnd what we're gonna do, is we're gonna\ndo a list partition this time, right?\n\n334\n00:16:21.096 --> 00:16:24.490\nWe're gonna see what the partitions\nare on this drive, all right?\n\n335\n00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:27.210\nAnd I want you to notice something here,\nright?\n\n336\n00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:30.080\nNotice that we have a few partitions,\nall right?\n\n337\n00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:34.300\nWe have 1, 2, 3 as our primary,\nyou see prime 1, 2, and 3, right?\n\n338\n00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:39.518\nBut when I went to do prime 4,\nit said uh-uh, there's a limitation.\n\n339\n00:16:39.518 --> 00:16:42.390\nLet me go ahead and\nquarantine off that space.\n\n340\n00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:44.586\nNot in a virus sense,\nbut let me go ahead and\n\n341\n00:16:44.586 --> 00:16:47.550\nwe're gonna make that\nan extended partition.\n\n342\n00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:49.880\nAnd then inside of that\nextended partition,\n\n343\n00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.970\nyou can continue to divide\nup the rest of the space.\n\n344\n00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:56.540\nRemember, it tells me that\nthat was a 6 gig partition?\n\n345\n00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:59.590\nWe created two, the first one was 2 gigs,\nthe second one I said just go ahead and\n\n346\n00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:01.340\nuse the rest of it, right?\n\n347\n00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:05.050\nSo that is the difference between\na primary, extended, and logical, right?\n\n348\n00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:08.100\nA logical partition is just the way\nwe take the rest of that area,\n\n349\n00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:11.170\nthat extended partition, and we divide\nit up, kind of like adding your cubicle.\n\n350\n00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:12.590\nSo it is important to understand.\n\n351\n00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:18.530\nNow, what if you wanna go beyond\njust the basic simple volume\n\n352\n00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:20.539\nin a basic disk, right?\n\n353\n00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:23.305\nWell that's where dynamic disks come in,\nall right?\n\n354\n00:17:23.305 --> 00:17:26.978\nAnd a dynamic disk is something that\nyou can do the disk itself, and\n\n355\n00:17:26.978 --> 00:17:30.480\nyou can configure it to\nconvert it to dynamic disk.\n\n356\n00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:35.572\nNow you can also configure it to use\nthe unified extensible firmware interfaces\n\n357\n00:17:35.572 --> 00:17:40.372\nboot format, and that's something\nknown as GUID Partition Table, GPT.\n\n358\n00:17:40.372 --> 00:17:43.318\nGPT doesn't have the limitations of MBR,\nright?\n\n359\n00:17:43.318 --> 00:17:44.790\nIt get's well beyond that.\n\n360\n00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:48.320\nIt can see things like volume\nsizes larger than 2 terabytes,\n\n361\n00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.410\nwhich MBR and\nbasic disks you only get 2 terabytes.\n\n362\n00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:56.010\nAnything beyond that you have to create\nanother partition on that drive, right?\n\n363\n00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:59.770\nAnd when we have hard drives today\nthat are coming out that are 8 and\n\n364\n00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:03.751\n12 terabytes, that would probably\n[LAUGH] cause a problem, right?\n\n365\n00:18:03.751 --> 00:18:04.337\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n366\n00:18:04.337 --> 00:18:07.729\nthis is where you might wanna convert\nthis to GPT, but I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n367\n00:18:07.729 --> 00:18:09.480\nI'm gonna convert it to dynamic disk.\n\n368\n00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.590\nAnd it's gonna ask you,\nwhich ones do you want to convert?\n\n369\n00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:15.460\nWell for\nthe purposes of this demonstration,\n\n370\n00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:18.950\nI'm gonna convert disk 2 and 3,\nthe last two that we haven't touched.\n\n371\n00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:24.076\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nwe'll convert that over to a dynamic disk.\n\n372\n00:18:24.076 --> 00:18:27.132\nAll right Dan, I'll tell you what,\nwasn't that absolutely amazing?\n\n373\n00:18:27.132 --> 00:18:31.770\nI mean, I know you're in awe,\nit went from, well, basic to dynamic.\n\n374\n00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:32.392\n&gt;&gt; It blew my mind.\n\n375\n00:18:32.392 --> 00:18:33.902\n&gt;&gt; It really didn't do anything, did it?\n\n376\n00:18:33.902 --> 00:18:35.280\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My life is changed forever.\n\n377\n00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.224\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so what did that just do,\n\n378\n00:18:38.224 --> 00:18:40.330\nright, it just changed the words.\n\n379\n00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:42.269\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it seems like it\nchanged the label and that's it.\n\n380\n00:18:42.269 --> 00:18:43.134\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n381\n00:18:43.134 --> 00:18:45.007\n&gt;&gt; But there are some things happening-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n382\n00:18:45.007 --> 00:18:47.294\nthat's where we're gonna\nlook under the hood, right?\n\n383\n00:18:47.294 --> 00:18:48.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Now if I, and\n\n384\n00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:52.040\nI also wanna show you some of the other\ncolors too, a new simple volume, right?\n\n385\n00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.588\nIf I create a new simple\nvolume on a dynamic disk, and\n\n386\n00:18:55.588 --> 00:19:00.390\nI'll tell you what, we'll do this,\njust keep it simple, we'll do one gig.\n\n387\n00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.299\nI know your partition's gonna\nbe a lot bigger than that, or\n\n388\n00:19:02.299 --> 00:19:04.523\nyou would have movies that wouldn't\nfit in that partition, right?\n\n389\n00:19:04.523 --> 00:19:05.166\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n390\n00:19:05.166 --> 00:19:08.256\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we'll go ahead and\nchoose Next, and we'll just leave this.\n\n391\n00:19:08.256 --> 00:19:12.546\nWe'll call this a prime, and\nI'll call it a prime9, right, so\n\n392\n00:19:12.546 --> 00:19:14.966\nwe know that it's on a dynamic disk.\n\n393\n00:19:14.966 --> 00:19:18.457\nBut it's gonna be easier to see, because\nthe first thing you're gonna notice is\n\n394\n00:19:18.457 --> 00:19:20.440\nthat the color coordination is different.\n\n395\n00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.477\nIt's still a simple volume, right?\n\n396\n00:19:21.477 --> 00:19:23.633\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's still a simple volume, but\n\n397\n00:19:23.633 --> 00:19:26.987\none of the great things about it\nis it's now on a dynamic disc,\n\n398\n00:19:26.987 --> 00:19:30.060\nwhich means we can do almost\nlike a software level RAID.\n\n399\n00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:34.455\nNow Software level RAIDs are not\na replacement for a hardware accelerated\n\n400\n00:19:34.455 --> 00:19:38.530\nRAID platform, but it does allow you to\nget a little bit of redundancy, right?\n\n401\n00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:43.050\nWith a dynamic disk, we can start creating\nadditional types of volumes that we just\n\n402\n00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:44.590\ncouldn't do with a basic disk.\n\n403\n00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:45.930\nA span volume, right?\n\n404\n00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:47.990\nI can take these two hard drives, and\n\n405\n00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:53.890\nI can make a contiguous partition that\nactually spans across the two drives.\n\n406\n00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:55.110\nWhat's good about that?\n\n407\n00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:56.610\nWell, when you start to use and\n\n408\n00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:59.850\naccrue all of that hard drive\nspace in that volume, you\n\n409\n00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:04.190\ncan just extend the volume to additional\nunallocated space on these drives.\n\n410\n00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:06.720\nOr even better, slave in another drive,\n\n411\n00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.850\nand then extend than span partition over,\nright?\n\n412\n00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:12.738\nStriped volume, what does that do?\n\n413\n00:20:12.738 --> 00:20:15.650\nWell, a striped volume\nallows me to basically\n\n414\n00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:21.610\nstore portions of my data\nacross both of these disks.\n\n415\n00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:22.360\nAnd what does that do?\n\n416\n00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:25.940\nIt has the potential to give you\na performance increase because you're only\n\n417\n00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:30.290\nreading and writing from portions\nof your data to each disk, right?\n\n418\n00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:31.436\nOr a mirrored volume.\n\n419\n00:20:31.436 --> 00:20:33.027\nI'm gonna go with a mirrored volume,\n\n420\n00:20:33.027 --> 00:20:35.723\ncuz that would be one that I'd\nprobably use more than anything.\n\n421\n00:20:35.723 --> 00:20:41.019\nA mirrored volume, which you also get the\nability to do within a dynamic disk type,\n\n422\n00:20:41.019 --> 00:20:44.651\nis one where we're actually\ngonna use two hard drives and\n\n423\n00:20:44.651 --> 00:20:46.864\nwe're gonna write the data once.\n\n424\n00:20:46.864 --> 00:20:50.430\nWell you say, well wait a second,\nthat's gonna waste some space isn't it?\n\n425\n00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:56.100\nIf I'm gonna store the data, but that same\ndata I'm gonna write a duplicate copy,\n\n426\n00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:57.750\nwell that's why they call it mirrored,\nright?\n\n427\n00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:02.650\nAnd lets go ahead, and what we do is we\nadd the disks in question, we choose Next,\n\n428\n00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:04.270\nwe assign it a drive letter.\n\n429\n00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:08.900\nAnd we'll call this,\nthis was a mirrored volume, so\n\n430\n00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:14.390\nI'll call it MirroredVol, just so\nwe can keep track of which one's which.\n\n431\n00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:16.820\nAnd we'll choose Next, and Finish.\n\n432\n00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:21.052\nNow you will see that we have, yet\nagain, an additional color, right?\n\n433\n00:21:21.052 --> 00:21:23.722\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we got all the colors of the rainbow\n\n434\n00:21:23.722 --> 00:21:25.336\ncoming up here, right?\n\n435\n00:21:25.336 --> 00:21:27.510\nBut you'll notice it takes a second,\nright?\n\n436\n00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:31.160\nAnd you have what's known as the logical\nvolume manager's actually communicating\n\n437\n00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.664\nright now with the hard drives, and\nit's finishing the formatting process.\n\n438\n00:21:34.664 --> 00:21:38.813\nAnd it does looks like it's\ntaking a little bit here, so\n\n439\n00:21:38.813 --> 00:21:42.801\nyou can see that not all\nthe time does it run very fast.\n\n440\n00:21:42.801 --> 00:21:49.149\nAnd that is because one of the things\nthat i didn't do is check quick format.\n\n441\n00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:52.621\nSo you can see the difference here,\none is taking a good long while.\n\n442\n00:21:52.621 --> 00:21:53.801\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it takes a while.\n\n443\n00:21:53.801 --> 00:21:54.630\nI've sat through this thing, it's brutal.\n\n444\n00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:56.725\n&gt;&gt; In fact let me go ahead and\ncancel that,\n\n445\n00:21:56.725 --> 00:22:01.373\ncuz this needs to be a 30 minute show, and\nit could be 30 minutes just waiting here.\n\n446\n00:22:01.373 --> 00:22:02.146\n&gt;&gt; Just watching that, yeah.\n\n447\n00:22:02.146 --> 00:22:03.470\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let me go ahead and\n\n448\n00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:06.110\njust delete these volumes,\nand I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n449\n00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:08.700\nrerun them right here, live on camera.\n\n450\n00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:09.890\nI'm kinda glad that happened,\n\n451\n00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:11.960\njust because you could see that\nit could take forever, right?\n\n452\n00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:16.420\nSo again, when you're creating one of\nthese volumes you add the disks, again,\n\n453\n00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.250\nthat are appropriate for\nwhat you're doing.\n\n454\n00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:21.730\nYou choose Next,\nthis time I'll perform a quick format, and\n\n455\n00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:29.320\nwe'll call this mirroredvol, and hopefully\nit will not take 30 minutes, right?\n\n456\n00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.390\nWe don't have that time in this episode.\n\n457\n00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:33.190\nWe'll choose Next, all right?\n\n458\n00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:35.678\nAnd one of the things that it's\nletting me know is that hey,\n\n459\n00:22:35.678 --> 00:22:37.967\nhere's another thing too.\n\n460\n00:22:37.967 --> 00:22:40.980\nIf I don't convert this,\nyou'll notice that over here\n\n461\n00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:46.355\nthis last one is a basic disk, right?\n\n462\n00:22:46.355 --> 00:22:52.165\nWhen you have a dynamic disk that you\ntry to configure with a basic disk,\n\n463\n00:22:52.165 --> 00:22:55.325\none of these volume types it will\nautomatically, not automatically,\n\n464\n00:22:55.325 --> 00:22:56.755\nit's gonna warn you like it is right now.\n\n465\n00:22:56.755 --> 00:23:00.143\nNotice it's saying hey,\nthis needs to be on a dynamic disk.\n\n466\n00:23:00.143 --> 00:23:05.090\nThis is gonna convert the other hard\ndrive from a basic to a dynamic, right?\n\n467\n00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:09.043\nWe're gonna go ahead and say yes to that,\nand let's let it try again there, and\n\n468\n00:23:09.043 --> 00:23:10.936\nhopefully it doesn't take too long.\n\n469\n00:23:10.936 --> 00:23:13.238\nAnd what we'll see is that we\nget a volume, there we go.\n\n470\n00:23:13.238 --> 00:23:16.613\nSo we got a MirroredVol,\nright, our mirrored volume.\n\n471\n00:23:16.613 --> 00:23:21.292\nAnd I can see physically in\nDisk Management that it's across two hard\n\n472\n00:23:21.292 --> 00:23:24.852\ndrives, but\nwhat do I see in File Explorer, right?\n\n473\n00:23:24.852 --> 00:23:27.907\nWell, if I look in File Explorer,\nI see all the crazy primary and\n\n474\n00:23:27.907 --> 00:23:29.731\nlogical drives that we’ve created.\n\n475\n00:23:29.731 --> 00:23:30.374\nBoy, talk about a tattoo in File Explorer,\nright?\n\n476\n00:23:30.374 --> 00:23:31.545\n&gt;&gt; You've gone crazy, sir.\n\n477\n00:23:31.545 --> 00:23:34.185\n&gt;&gt; That's right, well if we’re gonna\ndo it, we might as well do it right.\n\n478\n00:23:34.185 --> 00:23:35.144\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n479\n00:23:35.144 --> 00:23:37.130\nnotice that I have MirroredVol, right?\n\n480\n00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:40.220\nAnd when we look at MirroredVol,\nit's just a contiguous space, right?\n\n481\n00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:44.930\nIt looks no different than any other\nvolumes that we've created, right?\n\n482\n00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:46.540\nIt looks identical to them, right?\n\n483\n00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:51.860\nWe've got prim one, two, three, logical,\nand then we have a prime dynamic, right?\n\n484\n00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:56.785\nSo a simple volume on a dynamic disk,\nbut then we have mirrored volume K.\n\n485\n00:23:56.785 --> 00:24:00.200\nAnd that's where you have to understand\nthat some of the things too that you see\n\n486\n00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.461\nin File Explorer, using that as your\nfile and folder management utility,\n\n487\n00:24:03.461 --> 00:24:05.867\nyou don't see until you drop\ndown to Disk Management.\n\n488\n00:24:05.867 --> 00:24:09.277\nAnd then even more show Sometimes there's\nthings that you don't see in disk\n\n489\n00:24:09.277 --> 00:24:13.140\nmanagement that you also have to turn\naround and dive down into disk part.\n\n490\n00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:16.520\nAll right, so, these are little bit\nabout the drive types that you need to\n\n491\n00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.110\nbe aware of.\n\n492\n00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:21.210\nOne of the last disk types that I didn't\nmention, Dan, is a really cool one.\n\n493\n00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:25.980\nAnd that is something known as\na virtual hard disk, a VHD.\n\n494\n00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.931\nRemember we talked about Hyper-V.\n\n495\n00:24:28.931 --> 00:24:33.809\nHyper-V allows you to run your virtual\nmachines on your local client operating\n\n496\n00:24:33.809 --> 00:24:34.399\nsystem.\n\n497\n00:24:34.399 --> 00:24:39.218\nAnd they operate with virtual hard drives,\nright,\n\n498\n00:24:39.218 --> 00:24:42.790\nvirtual hard disks, if you will.\n\n499\n00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:44.390\nNow what is a virtual hard drive, right?\n\n500\n00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:47.730\nWell a virtual hard drive, or\na virtual hard disk, if you will,\n\n501\n00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:49.490\nis essentially a folder.\n\n502\n00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:51.070\nIt's nothing more than a folder.\n\n503\n00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:55.834\nHowever, the virtualized part of it means\nthat a virtual machine can look at that\n\n504\n00:24:55.834 --> 00:25:00.051\nvirtual hard drive and use it just\nlike it's any other physical drive.\n\n505\n00:25:00.051 --> 00:25:03.130\nSee, it's kinda like a trick, right?\n\n506\n00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:04.450\nYou're tricking the operating system.\n\n507\n00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:06.820\nYou're saying, yeah,\nI have a hard disk here.\n\n508\n00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:09.800\nIt's installed in the machine, right?\n\n509\n00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:13.210\nBut what it really is is nothing\nmore than a folder that encompasses\n\n510\n00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:14.940\nall normal disk operations.\n\n511\n00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:16.140\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n512\n00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:20.931\nIn fact, we can go to our disk management\nand we can actually create a VHD here,\n\n513\n00:25:20.931 --> 00:25:21.450\nright?\n\n514\n00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:25.830\nAnd we're essentially going to\ncreate a virtual hard disk.\n\n515\n00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:30.290\nNow depending on what type of hard\ndisk you implement will tell you\n\n516\n00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:33.710\nwhether you can take advantage\nof different features, right?\n\n517\n00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:35.320\nThe older format was VHD and\n\n518\n00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:39.450\nyou can see that it does have kinda\nlike the MBR limitation dimension.\n\n519\n00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:41.611\nIt's got 2 terabyte limitation.\n\n520\n00:25:41.611 --> 00:25:45.163\nBut if you want to go beyond 2 terabytes,\nand\n\n521\n00:25:45.163 --> 00:25:48.621\na little bit more resilient if you will,\nfor\n\n522\n00:25:48.621 --> 00:25:53.740\ninstance the power failures,\nthen you could use the VHDX.\n\n523\n00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.630\nNow when you create a virtual hard disk,\n\n524\n00:25:55.630 --> 00:26:00.440\nyou have one that can be fixed size or\nit can be dynamically expanding.\n\n525\n00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:03.680\nBecause this is a folder, I want you to\nthink about a folder on your hard drive,\n\n526\n00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:06.000\nright, a folder you add files to it.\n\n527\n00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.630\nAs you add files to the folder,\nit starts to expand and\n\n528\n00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:09.940\naccrue more hard drive space.\n\n529\n00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:14.780\nWell what a dynamically\nexpanding disk does is it says,\n\n530\n00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:18.370\nokay, I wanna create a 60\ngig virtual hard disk.\n\n531\n00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:21.170\nBut I don't want you to allocate\nall 60 gigs right away.\n\n532\n00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:22.560\nLet it go ahead and expand.\n\n533\n00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:26.420\nJust give me a container that\ncan grow to 60 gigs, but\n\n534\n00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:29.850\ndon't utilize 60 gigs until\nI actually need it, right?\n\n535\n00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:30.660\nThat's good for\n\n536\n00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:34.970\nstorage purposes, right, it helps you\nto save on some of your storage space.\n\n537\n00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:38.410\nBut I will tell you that there are some\ntimes in which you might need a little bit\n\n538\n00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:40.560\nmore stability.\n\n539\n00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:44.200\nAnd you can see in certain applications\nthat maybe you wanna create a fixed size.\n\n540\n00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.130\nAnd that says, you know what?\n\n541\n00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:49.070\nIf I create a 60 gig drive, I'm allocating\nit right to that hard drive file and\n\n542\n00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:50.490\nyou're gonna lose it for everything else.\n\n543\n00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:51.580\nIt's fixed, right?\n\n544\n00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:53.833\nIt means allocate that\ncontainer right now.\n\n545\n00:26:53.833 --> 00:26:56.604\nI'm gonna go ahead and just for\ndemonstration purposes,\n\n546\n00:26:56.604 --> 00:26:59.220\nI'm gonna do a dynamically expanding here.\n\n547\n00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:04.039\nAnd I will call this a,\nwhat are we gonna call this?\n\n548\n00:27:04.039 --> 00:27:07.350\nMTA demo, and-\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n549\n00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:08.021\n&gt;&gt; You like it?\nIt's pretty cool.\n\n550\n00:27:08.021 --> 00:27:08.853\n&gt;&gt; It speaks to me.\n\n551\n00:27:08.853 --> 00:27:09.890\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n552\n00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:13.039\nAnd then remember to change\nthat to gigabytes, [LAUGH] or\n\n553\n00:27:13.039 --> 00:27:15.184\nyou will have a very small hard drive.\n\n554\n00:27:15.184 --> 00:27:19.970\nUnless you type in a lot of zeros,\nwhich I always say about my paycheck.\n\n555\n00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:23.370\nSo virtual hard disk, we'll go ahead and\nwe'll call this 60 gigabytes.\n\n556\n00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:26.500\nAnd you know what it is?\n\n557\n00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.440\nI know the naming convention.\n\n558\n00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.190\nIt did not like that.\n\n559\n00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:30.960\n&gt;&gt; That underscore?\n\n560\n00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well no,\nit's gotta be a fully qualified path.\n\n561\n00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:34.700\nIt can't be the relative path.\n\n562\n00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.651\n&gt;&gt; That's an important safety tip there,\nladies and gentleman.\n\n563\n00:27:37.651 --> 00:27:39.215\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, yeah,\n\n564\n00:27:39.215 --> 00:27:40.507\nyou got to configure it right.\n\n565\n00:27:40.507 --> 00:27:43.390\nSo let me go ahead and here's twisty.\n\n566\n00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:47.710\nI wonder if I can put the [LAUGH] virtual\nhard disk into one of those spanned\n\n567\n00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:50.950\nvolumes, or\nmirrored volumes that we just created.\n\n568\n00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:55.049\nSo we'll call this mtademo.vhd.\n\n569\n00:27:55.049 --> 00:27:59.920\nActually, I don't think I\nneed to name the extension.\n\n570\n00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.570\nIt'll add it for me.\n\n571\n00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:03.500\nAnd we'll create gigabytes,\n\n572\n00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:08.030\nchange that, and we'll make this\n60 gigabytes and we'll choose OK.\n\n573\n00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:10.914\nThere we we go.\nAll right, so last but not least on this\n\n574\n00:28:10.914 --> 00:28:16.110\nlist, I want you to see the difference\nin the colors of the icons, right?\n\n575\n00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:19.160\nBecause we've been looking at the colors\nof the partitions themselves, but\n\n576\n00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.319\nwe haven't been looking at\n\n577\n00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:23.950\nreally the color of the disk guide\ncomments next to them, right?\n\n578\n00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:25.110\nSo notice that I have,\n\n579\n00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:27.721\nand, Dan, can you see the difference\nin the colors here, right?\n\n580\n00:28:27.721 --> 00:28:28.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Notice that-\n\n581\n00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:30.485\n&gt;&gt; There's like a light blueness and\n\n582\n00:28:30.485 --> 00:28:32.451\nthen a little red something or other.\n\n583\n00:28:32.451 --> 00:28:33.936\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n584\n00:28:33.936 --> 00:28:35.034\n&gt;&gt; Mouse is covering or whatever.\n\n585\n00:28:35.034 --> 00:28:35.730\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n586\n00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:39.130\nThat blue lets me know that\nright away it's a VHD file.\n\n587\n00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:40.520\nI don't know if it's a VHDX or\n\n588\n00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.210\nVHD file but I know-\n&gt;&gt; It's a VHD.\n\n589\n00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:42.915\n&gt;&gt; It's a VHD.\n\n590\n00:28:42.915 --> 00:28:45.990\nAnd that's the reason we bring that up is\nthat it might be important on the exam.\n\n591\n00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:48.360\nThey might say, well,\nwhat's up with this disk?\n\n592\n00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.780\nAll right,\nI'll tell you about the little red arrow.\n\n593\n00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:51.755\n&gt;&gt; Let's see,\nthat's an official Microsoft question.\n\n594\n00:28:51.755 --> 00:28:53.280\nWhat's up with this disk?\n\n595\n00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.820\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n[LAUGH] It'll say what kind of disk\n\n596\n00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:56.470\nis this?\n\n597\n00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:59.300\nAnd they might give you some options here.\n\n598\n00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:02.690\nAnd you'll have to know,\nhey, this is a virtual disk,\n\n599\n00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:06.800\nit's offline, and\nit's not usable right now.\n\n600\n00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.780\nIt isn't, we gotta bring it online,\nall right?\n\n601\n00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:13.532\nSo, if we do that, we will right click and\nwe will choose, or Initialize Disk, right?\n\n602\n00:29:13.532 --> 00:29:16.490\nAnd if you Initialize Disk,\nthat's the communication.\n\n603\n00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:22.020\nAnd it starts a little communication\nthat starts to format that disk with\n\n604\n00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:25.965\nthe identifiers and stuff the way it needs\nto be to talk to the operating system.\n\n605\n00:29:25.965 --> 00:29:28.625\nAll right, and\nhere's where it gives you the option.\n\n606\n00:29:28.625 --> 00:29:31.085\nHey, what partitioning\nstyle do you wanna use?\n\n607\n00:29:31.085 --> 00:29:32.656\nDo you wanna use MBR?\nBecause if you use MBR,\n\n608\n00:29:32.656 --> 00:29:35.955\nyou got backwards compatibility\nwith legacy systems.\n\n609\n00:29:35.955 --> 00:29:38.555\nBut you gotta keep in mind that you're\ngonna have the four primary partition\n\n610\n00:29:38.555 --> 00:29:42.745\nlimitation, including two volumes that\nare 2 terabyte volume, that's all you get.\n\n611\n00:29:42.745 --> 00:29:46.469\nI'm gonna go ahead, and I'll live\ndangerously, and I'm gonna say and\n\n612\n00:29:46.469 --> 00:29:47.034\ngreatest.\n\n613\n00:29:47.034 --> 00:29:49.757\nWe'll get over that four primary\npartition limitation and\n\n614\n00:29:49.757 --> 00:29:52.980\nthe 2 terabyte limitation and\nchoose go with partition table or GPT.\n\n615\n00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:59.310\nAll right, so, now if you notice,\nthe disk is online, right?\n\n616\n00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:01.940\nNotice the difference,\nthat little down arrow is gone.\n\n617\n00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:03.300\nIt is initialized.\n\n618\n00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:06.382\nAnd now what we have is a container,\njust like any other\n\n619\n00:30:06.382 --> 00:30:10.611\nhard drive that we've been using,\nthat we can create a new simple volume.\n\n620\n00:30:10.611 --> 00:30:13.210\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nallocate all the space here.\n\n621\n00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:17.190\nAnd we will call this,\nwhat are we gonna call this volume?\n\n622\n00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:19.100\nI'll just call it VHD.\n\n623\n00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:20.575\nSo we know which volume is which.\n\n624\n00:30:20.575 --> 00:30:21.176\n&gt;&gt; VHD.vhd.\n[LAUGH]\n\n625\n00:30:21.176 --> 00:30:25.090\n&gt;&gt; VHD, that's redundancy for you, right?\n\n626\n00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:29.290\nAnd notice that I can see,\nin fact that's our autoplay here.\n\n627\n00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:32.471\nAnd if I dive down, boy,\nwe've really gone crazy now, Dan, right?\n\n628\n00:30:32.471 --> 00:30:34.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [COUGH] Notice that I have my virtual\n\n629\n00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:36.250\nhard disk right here.\n\n630\n00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:37.060\nAnd I can use it.\n\n631\n00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:41.978\nI can create files here, right,\njust like I can any other disk, right?\n\n632\n00:30:41.978 --> 00:30:46.020\nAnd I can create a bitmap called well,\nBitmap, right?\n\n633\n00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:47.452\nWell, we're getting really creative here.\n\n634\n00:30:47.452 --> 00:30:50.010\nBut here's what's kinda twisty.\n\n635\n00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:53.430\nYou wanna see something\nthat's a little interesting?\n\n636\n00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:59.960\nIf I look at File Explorer, this disk is\nactually stored in this volume, right?\n\n637\n00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:01.533\nSo here's your virtual hard drive, right?\n\n638\n00:31:01.533 --> 00:31:03.706\nHere's your virtual hard disk, right?\n\n639\n00:31:03.706 --> 00:31:04.552\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n640\n00:31:04.552 --> 00:31:07.132\n&gt;&gt; But it actually allows me to create and\n\n641\n00:31:07.132 --> 00:31:10.550\nuse it just like any\nother physical device.\n\n642\n00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:12.520\nSo boy that whole concept\ngets a little twisty.\n\n643\n00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.070\nA drive, in a drive,\nin a drive, in a drive, right?\n\n644\n00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:15.860\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Drive.\n\n645\n00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:16.749\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, that's right,\ntake a drive, so-\n\n646\n00:31:16.749 --> 00:31:17.619\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] My driver,\n\n647\n00:31:17.619 --> 00:31:19.005\nand we'll go to the driving range.\n\n648\n00:31:19.005 --> 00:31:19.776\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n649\n00:31:19.776 --> 00:31:21.595\n&gt;&gt; So we'll drive this one home, and\n\n650\n00:31:21.595 --> 00:31:25.812\nI will tell you that again, keep in mind\nthe reason we use the virtual hard disk.\n\n651\n00:31:25.812 --> 00:31:28.750\nIt allows your virtual\nmachines to communicate.\n\n652\n00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:33.350\nIt's what your virtual machines\nuse in order to have storage.\n\n653\n00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:35.830\nBut we can also, if we want,\neven for testing purposes,\n\n654\n00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:39.640\nwe can create a hard disk right\nhere on our machines too.\n\n655\n00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:41.970\nSo these are couple of the things\nthat you need to know.\n\n656\n00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:44.220\nI am looking at our list and\nwe got a few more things.\n\n657\n00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.760\nBut I'm also looking at the clock and\nDan, I don't think we have time.\n\n658\n00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:48.649\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, it's running\nshort supply for this episode.\n\n659\n00:31:48.649 --> 00:31:53.162\nBut that's not a problem, we'll just roll\nthis into a part two we're so famous for\n\n660\n00:31:53.162 --> 00:31:54.250\nso much fun.\n\n661\n00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:56.430\nWes, thanks for joining us today,\nlook forward to seeing you in part two,\n\n662\n00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:58.980\nlooking forward to seeing you\ngood folks out there as well.\n\n663\n00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:01.974\nDefinitely join us there because it's\ngonna have a lot more great information\n\n664\n00:32:01.974 --> 00:32:04.390\nwhen it comes to storage

00:00:08.059\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.797\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.797 --> 00:00:15.938\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome to ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:15.938 --> 00:00:20.161\nI'm your host Zach Memos with this\nepisode of Windows OS funadmentals,\n\n7\n00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:23.500\nwe're understanding storage, part two.\n\n8\n00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.733\nAnd of course, once again,\nwe're joined by Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.002\nWes, good to see you sir.\n\n10\n00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:28.375\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me back Zach.\n\n11\n00:00:28.375 --> 00:00:29.146\nThat's right,\n\n12\n00:00:29.146 --> 00:00:32.790\nwe got a lot more to talk about when it\ncomes to understanding storage, right?\n\n13\n00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.594\nRemember in the first part,\nwe've kind of set the stage for\n\n14\n00:00:35.594 --> 00:00:37.738\nsome of the things that\nwe need to be aware of.\n\n15\n00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:38.977\nBut moving to this part,\n\n16\n00:00:38.977 --> 00:00:42.310\nwe've got a lot more that we're\ngonna talk about in this episode.\n\n17\n00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.383\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're talking about storage\ndevices, we went over several of those,\n\n18\n00:00:46.383 --> 00:00:49.050\npartitioning styles, so\nwhat's the next point?\n\n19\n00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.970\nWhere are we going now?\n\n20\n00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.739\n&gt;&gt; Now, I would say the next\npoint is pretty much to\n\n21\n00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.618\nchoose what disk type you want.\n\n22\n00:00:55.618 --> 00:01:00.180\nAnd what I mean by disk type is, we're\nnot talking about storage type, right?\n\n23\n00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.978\nSo the storage type is actually the\nphysical media, at this point were talking\n\n24\n00:01:03.978 --> 00:01:07.849\nabout when we say partitioning style,\nnow we're talking about the software.\n\n25\n00:01:07.849 --> 00:01:10.782\nAnd then when we go into disk\ntype what we're talking about is\n\n26\n00:01:10.782 --> 00:01:12.112\nsoftware-based as well.\n\n27\n00:01:12.112 --> 00:01:12.860\nCuz like Zach said,\n\n28\n00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.650\nwe've already made our choice of what\nstorage device we're gonna use, okay?\n\n29\n00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.105\nSo let's talk about disk types.\n\n30\n00:01:18.105 --> 00:01:20.589\nI've got a little diagram here and\n\n31\n00:01:20.589 --> 00:01:25.740\nthis will hopefully help out with\nour understanding of the disk types.\n\n32\n00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.693\nAll right, well, I'm gonna focus on.\n\n33\n00:01:27.693 --> 00:01:30.480\nWe've got what are known\nas basic disks and\n\n34\n00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.119\nwe have what are known as dynamic disks.\n\n35\n00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.860\nAnd let's go ahead and let's focus in\non the basic disk type, all right?\n\n36\n00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.125\nNow, the basic disk type,\n\n37\n00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:43.542\nit's the most common implementation\nthat we have out there, all right?\n\n38\n00:01:43.542 --> 00:01:48.868\nWhen you utilize a MBR if\nyou will partitioning style\n\n39\n00:01:48.868 --> 00:01:54.194\non a basic disk,\nyou get the traditional primary and\n\n40\n00:01:54.194 --> 00:01:59.210\nextended partitions, that's what you get.\n\n41\n00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.950\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; All right, now a lot of features but\n\n42\n00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.453\nit allows you to basically do all disk\nfunctions that you need to perform,\n\n43\n00:02:07.453 --> 00:02:08.360\nall right?\n\n44\n00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.503\nIt's very simple storage solution.\n\n45\n00:02:10.503 --> 00:02:13.360\nAnd one of the things I want you to\nunderstand with the basic disk, all right?\n\n46\n00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.287\nWith the basic disk,\nyou can extend volumes or\n\n47\n00:02:17.287 --> 00:02:20.409\nextend your partitions if you will,\n\n48\n00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:24.954\ninto contiguous space on a single drive,\nall right?\n\n49\n00:02:24.954 --> 00:02:27.790\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Hence very, very basic, all right?\n\n50\n00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.240\nNow, dynamic disk type on the other hand,\nlook a bit different.\n\n51\n00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.652\nAllows you more features, all right?\n\n52\n00:02:35.652 --> 00:02:37.730\nIt allows you simple volumes.\n\n53\n00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.824\nAnd I want you to understand any time\nyou have a GPT based dynamic disk,\n\n54\n00:02:43.824 --> 00:02:50.655\nthey kind of steer away from that term\nof calling them partitions, all right.\n\n55\n00:02:50.655 --> 00:02:53.020\nThey start to call them volumes,\nall right?\n\n56\n00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:00.080\nSo dynamic volumes,\ndon't let that terminology bug you at all.\n\n57\n00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.230\nA volume essentially is a container with\nthe file system applied to it, all right?\n\n58\n00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.140\nTraditionally, in the traditional basic\ndisk, MBR, we call them partitions.\n\n59\n00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.440\nWhen we talk about GPT and we talked about\ndynamic disk, we're talking about volumes.\n\n60\n00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.100\nNow, one of the great things about dynamic\ndisks is their ability to be recovered.\n\n61\n00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.230\nThey have multiple copies of\nthe database stored throughout\n\n62\n00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.190\nthe dynamic disks, all right?\n\n63\n00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.560\nThey can create things, if you will,\nlike fault-tolerant volumes.\n\n64\n00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.449\nWhich means that if I lose one of\nthe hard drives that a volume is on,\n\n65\n00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.130\nI still have access to my data.\n\n66\n00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.300\nNow, that might not make sense.\n\n67\n00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.960\nWhat do you mean lose\none of the hard drives?\n\n68\n00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.190\nYou just told us with the basic disk,\nit's a single drive.\n\n69\n00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.990\nWell, that's one of the great\nthings about dynamic volumes.\n\n70\n00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.655\nDynamic volumes can actually utilize for\n\n71\n00:03:54.655 --> 00:03:59.163\na single contiguous volume\nmultiple hard drives.\n\n72\n00:03:59.163 --> 00:04:04.060\nWhich is where you can configure what\nare known as fault-tolerant volumes.\n\n73\n00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.337\nThat volume actually spans\nacross multiple drives,\n\n74\n00:04:07.337 --> 00:04:11.776\nit can even extend into non-contiguous\nspace, which means I could have\n\n75\n00:04:11.776 --> 00:04:16.379\na partition already created on a drive\nthat is formatted as a dynamic disk.\n\n76\n00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:21.241\nAnd that unallocated space that's on\nthe outside of a formatted partition,\n\n77\n00:04:21.241 --> 00:04:25.149\nI can include in a volume on another disk,\nnon-contiguous.\n\n78\n00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:27.137\nCan't do that with a basic disk,\n\n79\n00:04:27.137 --> 00:04:30.760\nwhich means your volumes can\nspread across multiple disks.\n\n80\n00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.050\nLet's show you a couple of\nthese things in action.\n\n81\n00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.550\nAnd in fact, let's switch on\nover to our Windows 10 machine.\n\n82\n00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.264\nProbably gotta get logged back in\nhere because I talk a lot it's-\n\n83\n00:04:40.264 --> 00:04:41.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n84\n00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.010\n&gt;&gt; What I do, all right?\n\n85\n00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.174\nIn fact, let me go ahead because I kind\nof, in the last episode when I fired up\n\n86\n00:04:50.174 --> 00:04:56.120\ndisk management, one of the things you'll\nnotice is that I closed down our choice.\n\n87\n00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.770\nWhen we initialize the disk, all right?\n\n88\n00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.380\nDisk initialization,\ncouple of things happen, all right?\n\n89\n00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.490\nOne thing that happens is your operating\nsystem talks to the drive controller and\n\n90\n00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.131\nassigns an ID to it, all right?\n\n91\n00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:13.240\nThis is disk 1, disk 0, disk 3,\ndisk 4, 5, 6, all right?\n\n92\n00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.540\nWhat type of drive are you?\n\n93\n00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.720\nI gotta know so\nthat in that initialization,\n\n94\n00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.310\nthe operating system communicates\nwith the controller, all right?\n\n95\n00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.320\nThen we select, like Zach mentioned\nin the first part of this episode,\n\n96\n00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.080\nwe've talked about it in the last episode,\nour partitioning style, all right?\n\n97\n00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.310\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead, and\nI'm gonna select, and in fact,\n\n98\n00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.620\nI'm gonna deselect if you will, disk 2 and\n3, we'll come back to disk 2 and 3.\n\n99\n00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.040\nAnd I'm just gonna go ahead, and we'll se\nwhat the partitioning style does to us\n\n100\n00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:45.970\nwith an MBR in disk 1, and\nwe'll go ahead and choose OK, all right?\n\n101\n00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.620\nNow, you'll notice that this\nis a basic disk, all right?\n\n102\n00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.831\nIt's a basic disk,\nit's been formatted with MBR, all right?\n\n103\n00:05:53.831 --> 00:05:56.832\nThese other disks aren't initialized,\nwe'll get back to them,\n\n104\n00:05:56.832 --> 00:05:59.094\nyou can notice that they\ngot the down arrow there.\n\n105\n00:05:59.094 --> 00:06:03.120\nThat little down red roses says, hey,\nI have no clue what this drive is about,\n\n106\n00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.446\nI have no clues, it's unknown, all right?\n\n107\n00:06:05.446 --> 00:06:09.208\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's create on a basic disk,\n\n108\n00:06:09.208 --> 00:06:12.898\nlet's create a couple of partitions,\nall right?\n\n109\n00:06:12.898 --> 00:06:13.980\nWhat do you say?\n\n110\n00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.270\nAnd in fact, we got a 20 gig drive here.\n\n111\n00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.950\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\ncreate a couple of volumes.\n\n112\n00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:23.610\nAnd again, Microsoft's terminology\ngets a little weird here.\n\n113\n00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.799\nAgain, if you're on MBR basic disk,\nthey are partitions,\n\n114\n00:06:26.799 --> 00:06:29.370\neven though you see the term volume,\nall right?\n\n115\n00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.820\nIt just means that a file\nsystem is applied to it.\n\n116\n00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.760\nIn dynamic disks,\nthey're just known as volumes, okay?\n\n117\n00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.820\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's create a partition.\n\n118\n00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.510\nSo we will use our new\nSimple Volume Wizard.\n\n119\n00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:46.715\nLet me see if I can bring this down\nhere so we could kinda stay in view.\n\n120\n00:06:46.715 --> 00:06:50.610\nYou guys can see what's going on out here,\nall right.\n\n121\n00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.150\nSo here's our new Simple Volume Wizard,\nall right?\n\n122\n00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:57.070\nNotice that it tells us we have\na maximum disk space in megabytes.\n\n123\n00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:02.324\nMinimum size is 8 megs, we're definitely\nnot gonna do an 8 meg disk here.\n\n124\n00:07:02.324 --> 00:07:06.560\nAnd we can utilize really all of this,\nall of the 20 gigs if we want.\n\n125\n00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.832\nI don't wanna do that though,\ncuz I wanna for demonstration purposes,\n\n126\n00:07:08.832 --> 00:07:10.259\nwe're gonna create a couple of partitions.\n\n127\n00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:14.311\nAnd I want you to see some of\nthe limitations that we have inside of\n\n128\n00:07:14.311 --> 00:07:17.840\nour MBR base disks and\nbasic disks that too.\n\n129\n00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.068\nAll right, so here we go.\n\n130\n00:07:20.068 --> 00:07:22.360\nWe'll choose Next,\nwe got a 2 gig partition.\n\n131\n00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.789\nWe're gonna assign a drive letter, and\nagain a drive letter is a mounting point.\n\n132\n00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:31.110\nWhat that does is,\nimagine a house without any entry points.\n\n133\n00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:33.686\nNice house, but\nyou can't use it, all right?\n\n134\n00:07:33.686 --> 00:07:37.222\nAnd I put a mounting point or a drive\nletter on this, and now I've put a front\n\n135\n00:07:37.222 --> 00:07:40.220\ndoor on the house, now I can walk in and\nI can use it, all right?\n\n136\n00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.950\nSo that's what we're doing here,\nall right?\n\n137\n00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:46.480\nNow, once that's done we'll go ahead and\nwe'll choose Next.\n\n138\n00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.996\nAnd we could just leave this as a raw\nvolume, I'm not gonna do that here, but\n\n139\n00:07:50.996 --> 00:07:53.979\nit asks us what file system\ndo we wanna apply to it?\n\n140\n00:07:53.979 --> 00:07:57.438\nWe talked about in other episodes,\nwe talked about the file systems and\n\n141\n00:07:57.438 --> 00:08:01.318\nsome of their characteristics, but\nnotice that I have FAT, FAT32 and NTFS.\n\n142\n00:08:01.318 --> 00:08:05.151\nRemember FAT as FAT16, you really\ndon't wanna be using this today.\n\n143\n00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:09.499\nFAT 32 is okay and the fact that if\nyou need to go between the similar\n\n144\n00:08:09.499 --> 00:08:14.457\noperating systems, FAT 32 is pretty\nmuch supported by Windows, by Unix,\n\n145\n00:08:14.457 --> 00:08:16.617\nLinux, Mac operating systems.\n\n146\n00:08:16.617 --> 00:08:20.969\nSo you can use that for\ncompatibility reasons, but however,\n\n147\n00:08:20.969 --> 00:08:24.987\nit doesn't have the things\nlike journaling if you will,\n\n148\n00:08:24.987 --> 00:08:29.440\nit doesn't have some of the integrity\nfeatures that NTFS has.\n\n149\n00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.250\nIt certainly doesn't have encryption and\ncompression, so.\n\n150\n00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:33.300\n&gt;&gt; NTFS it is.\n\n151\n00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.610\n&gt;&gt; NTFS it is, right.\n\n152\n00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:38.510\nAllocation unit size, cluster size, we're\ngonna go ahead and keep it to the default.\n\n153\n00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:42.070\nAnd for our purposes,\nI'm gonna change the volume label.\n\n154\n00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:46.970\nTypically, [LAUGH] I've told Zach my\nlittle pet peeve before on this one.\n\n155\n00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:49.760\nI don't like volume labels.\n\n156\n00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.330\nOne of our other host kind of showed me\nthis and years ago he got me into this.\n\n157\n00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.460\nMike Rodrick,\nhe said I've got a volume letter.\n\n158\n00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.490\nIt's labeled.\n\n159\n00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:58.950\nI don't need a description.\n\n160\n00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.775\n[LAUGH] So I'm gonna do this for our\npurposes, but I will tell you that I would\n\n161\n00:09:02.775 --> 00:09:06.870\ntypically leave this blank, but\nwe're gonna call this SimpleVol1.\n\n162\n00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:08.240\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; Simple volume, right?\n\n163\n00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:14.330\nNow, the next thing that we can do\nis we can perform a quick format or\n\n164\n00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:15.700\nwe can uncheck that.\n\n165\n00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:19.930\nSo what are my options and\nwhy might I use one over the other?\n\n166\n00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:21.770\nAll right, so let me tell you here.\n\n167\n00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:26.990\nIf you do a quick format then what's\ngonna happen is the operating system\n\n168\n00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:33.670\nis gonna basically just apply a new\nfile system over any old, existing data.\n\n169\n00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:36.810\nAnd then you're gonna just start to\noverwrite that data all the time.\n\n170\n00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.720\nNow, if there are errors,\nnot if there are errors present,\n\n171\n00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.330\nthere are errors present in our hard\ndrives but the drive controllers and\n\n172\n00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:47.860\nthe operating system does a very good\njob of keeping that transparent to us.\n\n173\n00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.999\nWe don't even see it,\nit handles the errors, right.\n\n174\n00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.070\nBut, there could be errors present.\n\n175\n00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:56.020\nSo if you uncheck this\nperform quick format,\n\n176\n00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.170\nthen what you're saying is,\nI want you to run checkdisk.\n\n177\n00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:04.476\nI want you to inspect every sector of\nthat drive for a potential of errors.\n\n178\n00:10:04.476 --> 00:10:06.771\nAnd when you find those errors,\nI want you to mark them as bad so\n\n179\n00:10:06.771 --> 00:10:08.460\nthat we don't store\ndata in those location.\n\n180\n00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:09.380\n&gt;&gt; And that could take some time.\n\n181\n00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.210\nI mean some-\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n182\n00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:12.790\nYou hit the nail on the head.\n\n183\n00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:13.390\nLet me tell you.\n\n184\n00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:15.740\nIf you've got a, well, in this case,\n\n185\n00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.880\nif you're using a basic MBR disk,\nit's not gonna be more than two terabytes.\n\n186\n00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.040\nYou're gonna have to go to dynamic GPT.\n\n187\n00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.942\nBut actually it doesn't have to be\ndynamic, it just has to be GPT.\n\n188\n00:10:24.942 --> 00:10:30.070\nIf it's a GPT based disk, and\nit's four terabytes, it's eight terabytes.\n\n189\n00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:33.043\nZach, like you said, bud,\nI think we're in for a coffee break.\n\n190\n00:10:33.043 --> 00:10:34.111\n&gt;&gt; It's time for dinner and a coffee.\n\n191\n00:10:34.111 --> 00:10:36.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, that's right.\n\n192\n00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.300\nWe might be able to come back\nnext morning, too, and clock out.\n\n193\n00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.720\nIf you're an hourly employee, it's great.\n\n194\n00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.000\nIf you're a salary employer like, gosh.\n\n195\n00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.690\nThis is gonna take forever.\n\n196\n00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:48.310\nAll right, so I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna perform quick format.\n\n197\n00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:50.610\nYou can enable file and\nfolder compression here too.\n\n198\n00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.490\nIt's one of the extended attributes\nof NTFS and I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n199\n00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:55.010\njust enable this here.\n\n200\n00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:56.647\nAnd then what we're gonna do, oops,\n\n201\n00:10:56.647 --> 00:11:00.740\nis we;re gonna keep that back in the\nscreen here and we're gonna choose next.\n\n202\n00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:01.920\nRemember your summary panes.\n\n203\n00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.800\nI will tell you your summary pane here\nis very, very important all right.\n\n204\n00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.210\nAnd here is why.\n\n205\n00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:14.917\nIf I want to make changes to this drive,\nright, I need to back up the information,\n\n206\n00:11:14.917 --> 00:11:18.580\nformat it, and\nthen move the data back, all right.\n\n207\n00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:21.667\nThat could happen because you\ndidn't make the right choice.\n\n208\n00:11:21.667 --> 00:11:24.990\nSo you wanna go through your\noptions here and make sure, right?\n\n209\n00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:26.960\nYes, it's a simple volume.\n\n210\n00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.318\nYes, it was disk 1.\n\n211\n00:11:28.318 --> 00:11:33.279\nYes the volume size, the drive letter,\nallocation unit, volume label,\n\n212\n00:11:33.279 --> 00:11:35.490\nquick format compression.\n\n213\n00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:39.810\nMake sure you've made the right choice and\njust finish.\n\n214\n00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:41.560\nNow that was a slower,\n\n215\n00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.660\nmore thorough explanation of\nthe new simple volume wizard.\n\n216\n00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.600\nUnderstand that the next couple\nof ones that I'm gonna do here,\n\n217\n00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.480\nwe're gonna speed it up a little bit.\n\n218\n00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.663\nAnd if you need a recap, by all means,\njust rewind the video a little bit, okay.\n\n219\n00:11:52.663 --> 00:11:53.860\nSo next thing that we're gonna do.\n\n220\n00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.230\nWe've got one simple volume.\n\n221\n00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:58.996\nWe're gonna create another simple volume,\nessentially creating another partition.\n\n222\n00:11:58.996 --> 00:12:04.630\nAll right, and let's go ahead and do that.\n\n223\n00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:05.160\nAnd you know what,\n\n224\n00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.100\nbefore we do that, let's show you\nthe results of our partition right.\n\n225\n00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:15.790\nSampleVol1 E: it's there 2 giga\nbites NTFS it's healthy and\n\n226\n00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:19.590\nit's a primary partition again because\nit has a file system applied to it.\n\n227\n00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:21.200\nMake sure we give you\na chance to see that too.\n\n228\n00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:26.410\nAll right, now we're gonna create\nanother new simple volume and\n\n229\n00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:30.860\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nmake this also two gigs.\n\n230\n00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:33.470\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nwe'll choose Next.\n\n231\n00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:35.850\nWe'll use the next\nsequential drive letter.\n\n232\n00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:37.890\nWe'll choose Next as well.\n\n233\n00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:43.537\nI'm gonna call this, all default so\nI'm gonna call this SimpleVol2.\n\n234\n00:12:43.537 --> 00:12:46.950\nI will make sure that it performs the,\nallows for\n\n235\n00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:52.540\nfile and folder compression to save\nthe on disk space for some files.\n\n236\n00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:56.010\nAnd now we have, SimpleVol1, SimpleVol2.\n\n237\n00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.980\nAll right, we're up to two.\n\n238\n00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.240\nLet's go a head,\nwe'll right-click one more time and\n\n239\n00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.400\nwe're gonna create another one.\n\n240\n00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:04.750\nAll right, we'll choose Next, and\n\n241\n00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:08.860\nI'll go ahead 2040 we're\ngonna do another two gigs.\n\n242\n00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.000\nNext we're gonna walk through\nthe wizard here, all right?\n\n243\n00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.990\nI'll call this SimpleVol3, all right.\n\n244\n00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:21.158\nDid the same thing, enable file and\nfolder compression choose Next and Finish.\n\n245\n00:13:23.234 --> 00:13:24.970\nAnd notice what we have here.\n\n246\n00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.930\nWe have three primary partitions,\nall right?\n\n247\n00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:30.940\nThat's why I told you guys don't\nget tripped up on that volume.\n\n248\n00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:35.040\nNotice it said new simple volume, but\nthen what does it label it once it's done?\n\n249\n00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.700\nDon't let that it's primary partition.\n\n250\n00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:37.680\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; All right now,\n\n251\n00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.060\nremember what we told you,\n\n252\n00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:44.560\nZach remember when I said the limitations\nto MBR there were four primary partitions?\n\n253\n00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.712\n&gt;&gt; Four, mm-hm,\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's go ahead and\n\n254\n00:13:47.712 --> 00:13:51.101\nlet's create our fourth and\nlast partition.\n\n255\n00:13:51.101 --> 00:13:56.928\nWe'll choose Next,\nwe'll also do another 2048, all right.\n\n256\n00:13:56.928 --> 00:14:00.510\nAnd then we'll choose Next.\n\n257\n00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:05.352\nWe'll go ahead and\nuse the default sequential drive letter.\n\n258\n00:14:05.352 --> 00:14:08.922\nAnd we'll call this SimpleVol4 all right.\n\n259\n00:14:08.922 --> 00:14:13.740\nAnd we'll chose enable file and\nfolder compression and finish.\n\n260\n00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:17.690\nWait a second, what happened here?\n\n261\n00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:22.390\nI see that I have on disk 1,\nSimpleVol 1, 2, 3, and\n\n262\n00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:26.815\nI made a fourth primary partition,\nwhat happened?\n\n263\n00:14:26.815 --> 00:14:27.570\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n264\n00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:29.270\n&gt;&gt; There's supposed to\nbe a limitation here,\n\n265\n00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:33.640\nbut I should be able to create that\nfourth primary partition right.\n\n266\n00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.230\nWell, yes and no, all right.\n\n267\n00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:39.510\nNotice the color changes, and Zack,\nI don't know let me zoom in here.\n\n268\n00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:42.850\nCan you see that green bar right there\naround this last dividing space?\n\n269\n00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:43.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n270\n00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.060\nYeah.\n\n271\n00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.090\n&gt;&gt; There's our extended partition.\n\n272\n00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:49.470\nRoom four just got a cubicle, all right?\n\n273\n00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:51.940\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And what that means is now\n\n274\n00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:56.150\nI have a logical drive inside\nof that extended partition.\n\n275\n00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:59.523\nAnd you can't really see,\nyou'll have to take my word for it, right?\n\n276\n00:14:59.523 --> 00:15:00.660\nNo just kidding I'll show you.\n\n277\n00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.390\nYou have to take my word for\nit that this is an extended partition and\n\n278\n00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:08.180\nyou cannot see it inside of\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n279\n00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:13.740\nBut, if we dive down into our\ncommand prompts, all right.\n\n280\n00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:17.630\nAnd we use our command line equivalent.\n\n281\n00:15:18.838 --> 00:15:20.430\nAll right, and let me go ahead and\n\n282\n00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:23.200\nchange the property's font\nsize on this a little bit.\n\n283\n00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.640\nA little easier for you ladies and\ngentlemen out there to see.\n\n284\n00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:31.158\nAll right and\nwhat we'll do is we'll get into disk part.\n\n285\n00:15:31.158 --> 00:15:35.533\nDisk part again like said is the command\nline equivalent of disk management,\n\n286\n00:15:35.533 --> 00:15:36.217\nall right.\n\n287\n00:15:36.217 --> 00:15:39.087\nSo we will launch up our disk part and\n\n288\n00:15:39.087 --> 00:15:43.113\nthe first command that I'm\ngonna do is list disk.\n\n289\n00:15:43.113 --> 00:15:45.363\nShows me all the available\ndisks that I have.\n\n290\n00:15:45.363 --> 00:15:50.436\nKeep in mind that the one that we want\nthat is in question right here is disk 1.\n\n291\n00:15:50.436 --> 00:15:54.285\nSo I wanna make sure that\nI have disk one selected.\n\n292\n00:15:54.285 --> 00:15:59.990\nAnd in order to do that I am going\nto run the select disk 1 And\n\n293\n00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:08.040\nthen I'm gonna rerun our list disk\ncommand to look for my asterisk symbol.\n\n294\n00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.900\nBe careful in the command prompt,\nbecause you can't tell, except for\n\n295\n00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:14.870\nthat asterisk symbol,\nwhat disk you're working with and\n\n296\n00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:17.580\nyou don't want to format\nthe wrong hard drive.\n\n297\n00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:22.850\nAll right, so now that we're there,\nwe've got Disk 1 selected.\n\n298\n00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:29.170\nLet's do a list partition, And here we go.\n\n299\n00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:31.068\nAll right, notice our partitions here.\n\n300\n00:16:31.068 --> 00:16:33.044\nWe've got three primaries.\n\n301\n00:16:33.044 --> 00:16:34.890\nAnd you can see them in the background,\nright?\n\n302\n00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:39.540\nOne, two, three, but notice what happens\nwhen we get to the fourth partition,\n\n303\n00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:40.230\nit's interesting.\n\n304\n00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:42.720\nIt's kind of like a little\nline to the operating system.\n\n305\n00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.790\nAll that's partition zero.\n\n306\n00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:49.726\nIt's an extended partition,\nthat's that little green box,\n\n307\n00:16:49.726 --> 00:16:52.630\nthat border that we see, all right?\n\n308\n00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:55.395\nAnd then the fourth\npartition that I named,\n\n309\n00:16:55.395 --> 00:17:00.610\nSimpleVol4 is actually a logical drive,\nall right?\n\n310\n00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:01.829\nSo that's where you can see that.\n\n311\n00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:03.938\nI wanted you to be aware of that.\n\n312\n00:17:03.938 --> 00:17:08.162\nNow, what happens if I take a disk and\n\n313\n00:17:08.162 --> 00:17:13.205\nwe will initialize both of these disks,\nbut\n\n314\n00:17:13.205 --> 00:17:19.370\nthis time I'm gonna convert this to GPT,\nall right?\n\n315\n00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:22.880\nWell let's go ahead and\nwe'll create two GPT volumes.\n\n316\n00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.440\nNow they're still basic.\n\n317\n00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:29.016\nSo I can only work in contiguous space\non a single drive with a basic disk.\n\n318\n00:17:29.016 --> 00:17:34.423\nBut what I should be able to do is\ncreate a new simple volume here.\n\n319\n00:17:34.423 --> 00:17:37.715\nAnd we're gonna do this relatively\na little bit faster here,\n\n320\n00:17:37.715 --> 00:17:40.068\ncuz you guys have seen\nthis wizard already.\n\n321\n00:17:40.068 --> 00:17:43.634\nI'm gonna use the next\nsequential drive letter.\n\n322\n00:17:43.634 --> 00:17:49.568\nAll right, and what we're gonna do is\nwe'll call this GPTvol 1, all right?\n\n323\n00:17:49.568 --> 00:17:52.440\nNow these names are just so\nwe can kinda keep,\n\n324\n00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.081\nwell, Wes can keep track of\nwhat's going on here [LAUGH].\n\n325\n00:17:56.081 --> 00:18:00.348\nAnd yes I have a GPT based volume 1.\n\n326\n00:18:00.348 --> 00:18:01.940\nAll right, well, let's go ahead.\n\n327\n00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:05.470\nLet's right-click on the unallocated space\nand I can see that I've selected the right\n\n328\n00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:10.210\narea by the diagonal lines,\nif I could say that.\n\n329\n00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:12.610\nWe're gonna create a new simple volume,\nall right?\n\n330\n00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:15.390\nAnd we'll do the same thing again here.\n\n331\n00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:17.040\nWe'll Next through the Wizard.\n\n332\n00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:20.819\nWe will choose 2048.\n\n333\n00:18:20.819 --> 00:18:25.671\nChoose Next, next sequential drive letter,\nnot gonna change anything,\n\n334\n00:18:25.671 --> 00:18:27.990\nand I'm gonna call this GPTvol2.\n\n335\n00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:32.570\nEnable file and folder, press and\nchoose Next and Finish.\n\n336\n00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.926\nNotice that we've got two volumes now.\n\n337\n00:18:36.926 --> 00:18:39.250\nWe're gonna do this, and again,\nit's important to kinda see this.\n\n338\n00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:42.359\nI know it gets a little redundant, but you\ncan see what's kind of going on here when\n\n339\n00:18:42.359 --> 00:18:44.586\nit comes to understanding and\nconfiguring your storage.\n\n340\n00:18:44.586 --> 00:18:48.292\nAll right, we'll choose next here again,\nwe'll do another 2 gig.\n\n341\n00:18:48.292 --> 00:18:51.090\nAll right, and what we're gonna do,\nwe're gonna choose Next.\n\n342\n00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:52.432\nWe'll choose drive letter K.\n\n343\n00:18:52.432 --> 00:18:54.099\nI might end up running\nout of drive letters.\n\n344\n00:18:54.099 --> 00:18:55.715\n[LAUGH] By the time its done.\n\n345\n00:18:55.715 --> 00:19:00.345\nWe'll call this GPTvol3.\n\n346\n00:19:00.345 --> 00:19:03.467\nAnd again,\nwe enable file folder compression.\n\n347\n00:19:03.467 --> 00:19:07.663\nChoose Finish, and\nif I look I now have one, two, three.\n\n348\n00:19:07.663 --> 00:19:10.630\nAll right, let's see what happens when\nit comes to that fourth one there, Zach.\n\n349\n00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:12.290\nRemember, GPT.\n\n350\n00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:14.640\nI shouldn't have that limitation, right,\n\n351\n00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.130\nthat we had up here on our\nmaster boot record-based disk.\n\n352\n00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:19.090\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n353\n00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:22.690\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and\nlet's create a fourth volume.\n\n354\n00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:26.875\nAll right, and we'll choose Next,\nalso do 2048 here as well.\n\n355\n00:19:29.346 --> 00:19:34.867\nNext, Next, we will call this GPvol4.\n\n356\n00:19:39.349 --> 00:19:45.620\nChoose Finish and\nI've got four volumes, right?\n\n357\n00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.601\nFour volumes, you can see there, right?\n\n358\n00:19:47.601 --> 00:19:54.987\nI've got GPT Vol 1, Vol 2, Vol.3, Vol 4\nVol 4 is kind of cover up by head there.\n\n359\n00:19:54.987 --> 00:19:56.061\nThere we go.\n\n360\n00:19:56.061 --> 00:20:00.608\nAnd if I right-click on that last\nlittle bit of unallocated space,\n\n361\n00:20:00.608 --> 00:20:03.410\nI wonder, can I make a fifth volume?\n\n362\n00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:05.412\nWell, hopefully I've taught you, right?\n\n363\n00:20:05.412 --> 00:20:08.641\nAnd hopefully,\n[LAUGH] that's the outcome of it.\n\n364\n00:20:08.641 --> 00:20:13.342\nLet's go ahead and make one last,\nI know it's get a little redundant here,\n\n365\n00:20:13.342 --> 00:20:15.490\nlet's make one last volume.\n\n366\n00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:20.075\nWe'll call this GPTvol5.\n\n367\n00:20:20.075 --> 00:20:24.437\nChoose to Enable and Finish.\n\n368\n00:20:24.437 --> 00:20:27.230\nAll right, Zach,\nyou see how the layout works?\n\n369\n00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:27.950\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n370\n00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:32.320\n&gt;&gt; I've got on a basic disk formatted\nwith an MBR, I've got one, two,\n\n371\n00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.766\nthree\n&gt;&gt; And as in extended.\n\n372\n00:20:34.766 --> 00:20:37.446\nThree primary partitions in an extended,\nright?\n\n373\n00:20:37.446 --> 00:20:38.292\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n374\n00:20:38.292 --> 00:20:44.159\n&gt;&gt; If I look at the GPT-based\npartitioning style, I have one,\n\n375\n00:20:44.159 --> 00:20:49.909\nI have two, three, four, five,\nand yes I could go to six,\n\n376\n00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:55.100\nright, because I don't\nhave that limitation.\n\n377\n00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:59.080\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; All right, but now what happens if I\n\n378\n00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:05.090\nwant to maybe,\nI want to create other types of volumes?\n\n379\n00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:11.860\nAll right, well, that's where we get\nin to our dynamic volumes, all right?\n\n380\n00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:15.797\nOne of the first things that\nwe need to do, is, well,\n\n381\n00:21:15.797 --> 00:21:20.798\nwe need to be able to change these\nfrom basic disks to dynamic disks.\n\n382\n00:21:20.798 --> 00:21:25.454\nNow, now that we've done all\nof that leg work, all right?\n\n383\n00:21:25.454 --> 00:21:28.265\nI wanna show you a couple extra\nthings that you can also do on your\n\n384\n00:21:28.265 --> 00:21:29.123\nstorage, right?\n\n385\n00:21:29.123 --> 00:21:34.231\nNotice that I have this unallocated space,\nall right?\n\n386\n00:21:34.231 --> 00:21:39.882\nWell, what if I decided that GPT Volume 5,\nI don't want it to be 2 gigs.\n\n387\n00:21:39.882 --> 00:21:42.070\nI think I want it to be 4 gigs.\n\n388\n00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:45.150\nWell, you right click on that volume and\nyou choose extend.\n\n389\n00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:50.570\nAnd now you have the Extend Volume Wizard.\n\n390\n00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:52.001\nAnd I can choose Next.\n\n391\n00:21:52.001 --> 00:21:56.269\nAnd I can say, well, which disk do\nI want to extend the volume to?\n\n392\n00:21:56.269 --> 00:22:01.503\nAll right, and we're gonna,\nin this aspect, all right,\n\n393\n00:22:01.503 --> 00:22:05.796\nif I extend this disk\ninto noncontiguous space,\n\n394\n00:22:05.796 --> 00:22:09.370\nit's gonna turn it into a dynamic disk.\n\n395\n00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:13.466\nI don't want to do that yet, because I\nwant to show you some of thing that you\n\n396\n00:22:13.466 --> 00:22:17.629\ncan do regardless of whether you got GPT,\nNBR, whether it's a basic disk or\n\n397\n00:22:17.629 --> 00:22:20.119\ndynamic disk, you can extend your volumes.\n\n398\n00:22:20.119 --> 00:22:22.161\nNow how much do I want to extend this?\n\n399\n00:22:22.161 --> 00:22:23.401\nJust another 2 gigs.\n\n400\n00:22:23.401 --> 00:22:26.440\nI want this to be a 4 gig volume, and\nI'll choose Next, and then Finish.\n\n401\n00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:31.155\nAnd let's look at the results of GPTvol5.\n\n402\n00:22:31.155 --> 00:22:34.020\nI've gone from the 2 gigs\nthat we had before, right?\n\n403\n00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.550\nI've gone up to the 5 gig or 4 gigs.\n\n404\n00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:39.420\nSo you get the ability\nto extend the volume.\n\n405\n00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:43.450\nNow, I know we're running\na little bit short on time.\n\n406\n00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:49.740\nLet me go ahead and show you how you\nwould convert this to a dynamic disk.\n\n407\n00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.040\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; All right, are you ready for\n\n408\n00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:51.570\nthis, Zach?\n\n409\n00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:52.128\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, yes.\n\n410\n00:22:52.128 --> 00:22:56.918\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nright-click on the disk itself and\n\n411\n00:22:56.918 --> 00:23:00.012\nchoose convert to dynamic.\n\n412\n00:23:00.012 --> 00:23:00.695\n&gt;&gt; Wait a minute.\n\n413\n00:23:00.695 --> 00:23:02.117\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n414\n00:23:02.117 --> 00:23:02.858\n&gt;&gt; That's too difficult.\n\n415\n00:23:02.858 --> 00:23:04.151\n&gt;&gt; It is too difficult.\n\n416\n00:23:04.151 --> 00:23:08.522\nAll right, so what we're gonna do,\nI'll tell you what,\n\n417\n00:23:08.522 --> 00:23:15.055\nwe'll go ahead and we'll convert both\ndisk 2 and disk 3 to dynamic disks.\n\n418\n00:23:15.055 --> 00:23:20.110\nThat'll set us up for some dynamic\nvolumes that we can create, all right?\n\n419\n00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:22.063\nLet's go ahead and we'll do that.\n\n420\n00:23:22.063 --> 00:23:22.957\nWe'll choose OK.\n\n421\n00:23:24.798 --> 00:23:30.700\nAll right, notice it's a, these disks\nwill be made dynamic, all right?\n\n422\n00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:34.678\nNotice it tells me what, wait a second,\nthere's no volumes on this disk and\n\n423\n00:23:34.678 --> 00:23:37.239\nI could even look at the details too,\nall right?\n\n424\n00:23:37.239 --> 00:23:39.760\nI'll choose OK and\nlet's go ahead and convert them.\n\n425\n00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:44.100\nAnd you wanna keep in mind, notice it\nsays, if you convert the disk to dynamic,\n\n426\n00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:47.690\nyou will not be able to start\nan installed operating system from\n\n427\n00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:51.570\nany volume on the disks except\nthe current boot volume.\n\n428\n00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:53.470\nBe careful, make sure\n\n429\n00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:57.970\nyou understand the consequences of\nchanging that to a dynamic disk.\n\n430\n00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:02.373\nNow, boy, what happened here?\n\n431\n00:24:02.373 --> 00:24:03.239\nThe colors changed.\n\n432\n00:24:03.239 --> 00:24:03.744\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n433\n00:24:03.744 --> 00:24:06.760\n&gt;&gt; We got some color changing\nabilities here, right?\n\n434\n00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.130\nWhat happened?\n\n435\n00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:11.250\nWell, these are still simple volumes.\n\n436\n00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:15.430\nAnd they make it easier for you to\nidentify what type of disk it is based on\n\n437\n00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:17.650\nthe color that you see\nhere in Disk Management.\n\n438\n00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:20.890\nBlue is a Simple Volume on a basic disk.\n\n439\n00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:26.470\nThis lime green from the 70s\n\n440\n00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:30.830\nI think [LAUGH] is a Simple Volume\non a dynamic disk.\n\n441\n00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:34.650\nStill a simple volume, but it's letting\nyou know that this is a dynamic disk.\n\n442\n00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:38.029\nAll right, and that might be something\nthat you need to know on the exam.\n\n443\n00:24:38.029 --> 00:24:40.820\nAnd that's why we're showing you a lot\nof these different colors, right?\n\n444\n00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:42.060\nNotice that the green space,\n\n445\n00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:46.950\nthat little green box, lets me know\nthat it's an extended partition.\n\n446\n00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:51.030\nThe green bar here lets\nme know that that's\n\n447\n00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:56.000\nunallocated space that is\nwithin that extended partition.\n\n448\n00:24:57.370 --> 00:25:02.550\nAny black bar right here is\ncompletely unallocated, doesn't\n\n449\n00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:06.830\nhave a file system applied to it and it\nmeans that we can use it for a few things.\n\n450\n00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:10.420\nWe can use it, we create another\npartition if we have GPT or\n\n451\n00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:15.230\nwe have the basic disk that doesn't have\nan extended partition created, right?\n\n452\n00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:18.830\nOr what we could do is we\ncould extend partitions and\n\n453\n00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:21.440\nmake them bigger if we needed to.\n\n454\n00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.850\nOr we could go to the opposite way,\n\n455\n00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:25.890\nwe can actually shrink those\npartitions likewise too.\n\n456\n00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:27.982\nNow the next thing that we have to do,\n\n457\n00:25:27.982 --> 00:25:32.451\nis we have to take some of these disks\nthat we've been using here Disk 2 and 3.\n\n458\n00:25:32.451 --> 00:25:34.315\nWe gotta create dynamic volumes, but\n\n459\n00:25:34.315 --> 00:25:38.054\nI don't think we're gonna have enough\ntime to do that here in this episode.\n\n460\n00:25:38.054 --> 00:25:40.771\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Here you go.\nUnderstanding storage part three is coming\n\n461\n00:25:40.771 --> 00:25:43.352\nyour way, make sure you see part one and\npart two.\n\n462\n00:25:43.352 --> 00:25:46.060\nWindows OS Fundamentals\nis a fantastic series.\n\n463\n00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.160\nWes has been doing a wonderful\njob putting together for\n\n464\n00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.400\nyou all the information you need.\n\n465\n00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.580\nAnd by the way,\nwhen you're in that course library,\n\n466\n00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:54.110\nthere's more information that you need.\n\n467\n00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:56.518\nThousands of videos, check them out,\nyou'll be glad you did.\n\n468\n00:25:56.518 -->

fundamentals,\n\n8\n00:00:21.344 --> 00:00:23.950\nunderstanding storage part three.\n\n9\n00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.220\nStill looking at the storage and\nwhat we can do with all that.\n\n10\n00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.190\nAnd this is part three so\nmake sure you see part one and part two.\n\n11\n00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.680\nAnd bringing us all the information\nwe need, of course, is the one and\n\n12\n00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.920\nonly Wes Bryan, Wes,\ngood to see you again.\n\n13\n00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.410\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me back, Zach.\n\n14\n00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.105\nThat's right,\nwe are continuing along in our journey,\n\n15\n00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:43.615\nour now trilogy of understanding storage.\n\n16\n00:00:43.615 --> 00:00:47.030\nThere's a lot of things that you can do\nwhen it comes to the options that you have\n\n17\n00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.620\nand the choices that you make when\nit comes to configuring storage.\n\n18\n00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.020\nA lot of different things you\ncan do in configuration, right?\n\n19\n00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.216\n&gt;&gt; And you kinda left this\nwith a cliffhanger last time,\n\n20\n00:00:56.216 --> 00:00:59.280\nwe looked at the disk types and\ndynamic disk types.\n\n21\n00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.697\nAnd now we're gonna be looking\nat dynamic disk storage?\n\n22\n00:01:02.697 --> 00:01:07.326\n&gt;&gt; It's close, so if we have basic disk\ntypes, we have partitions, like I said,\n\n23\n00:01:07.326 --> 00:01:10.990\nthey can be primary partitions or\nextended partitions.\n\n24\n00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.640\nWe talked about the dynamic disk types,\n\n25\n00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.366\nit's interesting because\nthe terminology changes a little bit.\n\n26\n00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:16.167\n&gt;&gt; Disk volumes.\n\n27\n00:01:16.167 --> 00:01:19.094\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there you go, that's it, and\n\n28\n00:01:19.094 --> 00:01:24.958\nthat is a classic example of why\nthe terminology can get blurred, right?\n\n29\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.572\nBecause you see u creating simple\nvolumes in the last one, right,\n\n30\n00:01:27.572 --> 00:01:28.610\nthat's what we created.\n\n31\n00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.450\nWe created a simple volume but\nwhen it was done,\n\n32\n00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.083\nit ended up calling it\na primary partition.\n\n33\n00:01:34.083 --> 00:01:37.409\nSo we can definitely see,\njust keep in mind that the term volume,\n\n34\n00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.466\nwhen it's applied in Microsoft terms,\n\n35\n00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:43.972\nit just means that we have a container\nthat has a file system applied to it.\n\n36\n00:01:43.972 --> 00:01:46.440\nYou wanna call it a primary partition,\nthat's fine, but\n\n37\n00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.380\nanytime we talk about a dynamic disk,\nthey're going to be called volumes.\n\n38\n00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.802\nNow, that's what we're gonna\ndive into in this episode.\n\n39\n00:01:54.802 --> 00:01:59.542\nSo in the last episode,\nwe talked about simple volumes,\n\n40\n00:01:59.542 --> 00:02:03.711\nand what we did is we\ncreated some simple volumes.\n\n41\n00:02:03.711 --> 00:02:08.526\nBut when we created those simple volumes,\nwe created them on a single disk.\n\n42\n00:02:08.526 --> 00:02:12.852\n&gt;&gt; Well, can you extend a simple\nvolume to another disk?\n\n43\n00:02:12.852 --> 00:02:16.172\nYes you can, however,\n\n44\n00:02:16.172 --> 00:02:22.481\nif you extended to a non-contigious space,\n\n45\n00:02:22.481 --> 00:02:27.220\nor you extend to another drive.\n\n46\n00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.260\nMore importantly,\nwhen you extend it to another drive,\n\n47\n00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.570\nit is gonna change in what\ntype of volume it's called.\n\n48\n00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.852\nIt's gonna be called,\nit's gonna go from a simple\n\n49\n00:02:37.852 --> 00:02:42.445\nvolume into what is known as\na span volume, all right?\n\n50\n00:02:42.445 --> 00:02:46.265\nSo that's one of the things to keep\nin mind, so let's go ahead and\n\n51\n00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:49.482\nlet's talk a little bit\nabout a span volume.\n\n52\n00:02:49.482 --> 00:02:53.045\nAll right, first of all,\nwhat is a span volume?\n\n53\n00:02:53.045 --> 00:02:58.530\nWell, a span volume is called span because\nit spans across more than one drive.\n\n54\n00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.183\nAll right, now one of the things to keep\nin mind is it has to be NTFS formatted,\n\n55\n00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:06.134\nright, we have to have\na NTFS formatted volume.\n\n56\n00:03:06.134 --> 00:03:11.665\nAnd it allows you essentially to combine\nmultiple areas from multiple disks,\n\n57\n00:03:11.665 --> 00:03:16.882\nall right, or I should say,\nthe unallocated space from multiple disks.\n\n58\n00:03:16.882 --> 00:03:21.882\nAll right, it can be anywhere from 2 to 32\n\n59\n00:03:21.882 --> 00:03:25.956\ndisks can be aggregated all in one.\n\n60\n00:03:25.956 --> 00:03:30.930\nHowever, when it comes to the span volume,\nwe have to watch out.\n\n61\n00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.590\nSpan volume itself doesn't\nprovide any fault tolerance.\n\n62\n00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.020\nAnd that's something that\nyou do have to keep in mind.\n\n63\n00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.620\nSo span volume,\ngotta be NTFS formatting, right?\n\n64\n00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:50.281\nIt combines multiple areas of unallocated\nspace from multiple disks, 2 to 32 disks.\n\n65\n00:03:50.281 --> 00:03:54.240\nAs well as keeping in mind that it\ndoesn't provide fault tolerance.\n\n66\n00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.895\nWhich means if I span that volume across\na second, third, or fourth disk and\n\n67\n00:03:58.895 --> 00:04:03.695\none of those disks fails, unfortunately,\nyou lose all your information, so\n\n68\n00:04:03.695 --> 00:04:05.021\nno fault tolerance.\n\n69\n00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:08.140\n&gt;&gt; Wow, so Wes,\nwhen would we use a span volume?\n\n70\n00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.392\n&gt;&gt; A couple of reasons, one of the reasons\nI can think of is, imagine you got\n\n71\n00:04:12.392 --> 00:04:16.399\na single disk and the primary disk\nstarts to become to full, right?\n\n72\n00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:20.390\nThis scares a lot of people, right, it'd\nscare me too, right, [LAUGH] what do I do?\n\n73\n00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:27.770\nAll right, well, my option is,\nI can basically put a larger disk in.\n\n74\n00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.810\nI could take an image,\nif you will, of the data, or\n\n75\n00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.800\nI can move the data to a larger drive.\n\n76\n00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.980\nOr I can make it easier,\nI can just put in an additional drive, or\n\n77\n00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.450\nmaybe if I already have an additional\ndrive in the machine, and\n\n78\n00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.930\nI can extend that volume into that drive,\nI can span it into the new drive, right?\n\n79\n00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.370\nSo if the primary disk is getting full,\nwell, then I can expand and\n\n80\n00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.190\nI can add more storage,\nadd more to the volume.\n\n81\n00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.450\nThe other thing too is,\nthis is becoming less and\n\n82\n00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.710\nless of a problem, I say that just because\ndrives are getting so large today.\n\n83\n00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:10.110\nIf you have a few smaller disks,\n\n84\n00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.250\nstorage wise, they don't have\na lot of capacity out of them.\n\n85\n00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.575\nMaybe got a couple old ones standing\naround, you just wanna use them,\n\n86\n00:05:16.575 --> 00:05:19.374\nI know I got a couple\nolder 250 gig drives.\n\n87\n00:05:19.374 --> 00:05:22.917\nIt may be nice, if your motherboard\nsupports it, to put all those drives\n\n88\n00:05:22.917 --> 00:05:26.810\ntogether and you can actually create\na span volume that's a terabyte.\n\n89\n00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.660\nRather than just sitting them\nin the closet not being able to\n\n90\n00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.667\nuse them cuz they don't have\nthe storage capacity you may need.\n\n91\n00:05:30.667 --> 00:05:31.363\n&gt;&gt; That makes sense.\n\n92\n00:05:31.363 --> 00:05:33.944\n&gt;&gt; So you can, you could aggregate\nmultiple drives together and\n\n93\n00:05:33.944 --> 00:05:37.317\nyou could span the volumes across drives\nthat are essentially a little bt smaller\n\n94\n00:05:37.317 --> 00:05:40.950\nLet me show you how you would create\none of these span volumes, all right.\n\n95\n00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:45.810\nNow, a couple of things to keep in mind,\nwe did have a basic disk,\n\n96\n00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.150\nand I wanna set you up for this.\n\n97\n00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:52.280\nIf I was to extend the volume here,\none of the things you'll\n\n98\n00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.820\nnotice when I start the wizard here,\nback in here, and we'll start our wizard.\n\n99\n00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.030\nNotice how it actually,\n\n100\n00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:04.570\nI told you that on a basic disk,\nyou can only extend within the same disk.\n\n101\n00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.544\nBut yet it's giving me the option,\nI see disk two and three here,\n\n102\n00:06:07.544 --> 00:06:08.747\nwhat the heck is going on?\n\n103\n00:06:08.747 --> 00:06:11.863\nWell, a basic disk,\nthat is the format, but\n\n104\n00:06:11.863 --> 00:06:15.640\nit gives you the ability to\nextend it to another drive.\n\n105\n00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.485\nAnd if you extend it to another drive,\nit's gonna notice that and\n\n106\n00:06:18.485 --> 00:06:20.480\nit's gonna say, wait a second.\n\n107\n00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.660\nYeah, we can do that, but\n\n108\n00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.060\nwe're gonna have to convert this basic\ndisk to a dynamic disk, all right?\n\n109\n00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.190\nSo I just wanted you to see that yes,\nit will allow you to do that, but\n\n110\n00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.230\nit's gonna change the basic disk,\nconvert it to a dynamic.\n\n111\n00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:35.080\nI'm gonna cancel out of this because I\ndon't want you, if you're going through\n\n112\n00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.055\nyour own studies, I don't want you to\nget to that basic disk, go to extend it.\n\n113\n00:06:39.055 --> 00:06:41.149\nWes said that it was a single drive, but\n\n114\n00:06:41.149 --> 00:06:43.445\nwhy do I see more than\none drive in the list?\n\n115\n00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:44.991\nIt's okay,\nit's gonna give you the option to do that.\n\n116\n00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:47.700\nAnd if you use it,\nit's gonna turn around and\n\n117\n00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.520\nit's gonna convert it to a dynamic disk,\nright?\n\n118\n00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:57.040\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's extend this volume, GPTVol1.\n\n119\n00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.674\nWe'll extend, all right, so\nwe're gonna run our wizard here,\n\n120\n00:07:00.674 --> 00:07:02.070\nwonderful wizard of Oz.\n\n121\n00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:05.620\nChoose Next, and I'm gonna actually\nextend this into disk three.\n\n122\n00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.137\nNow one of the things I want you to notice\nhere because it's gonna differ when we\n\n123\n00:07:10.137 --> 00:07:13.037\ncome to some of the other dynamic\nvolumes is, notice this space here?\n\n124\n00:07:13.037 --> 00:07:17.450\nNotice how, individually,\nI can select them, and\n\n125\n00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:22.479\nI can control how much of the disk\nI want to utilize, right.\n\n126\n00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:27.082\nI can actually remove disk two if I want,\nall right, well, I don't want to\n\n127\n00:07:27.082 --> 00:07:32.000\ninclude the unallocated noncontiguous\nspace on disk two for whatever reason.\n\n128\n00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.610\nI actually just want to extend it\nto disk three, well, I can do that.\n\n129\n00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:40.800\nAnd let's go ahead, and let's say 4096,\nwe'll extend it by 4 gigs,\n\n130\n00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:46.412\nto a non-contiguous space located on\na second drive, and we'll choose Finish.\n\n131\n00:07:46.412 --> 00:07:51.979\nAll right, and here you go, now, this is\nwhat it looks like in disk management.\n\n132\n00:07:51.979 --> 00:07:54.852\nLet's see what it looks like\nin File Explorer, right, and\n\n133\n00:07:54.852 --> 00:07:56.470\nI'll open up our File Explorer.\n\n134\n00:07:57.545 --> 00:08:00.188\nGPTVol1, right there in the list.\n\n135\n00:08:00.188 --> 00:08:03.910\nIf I look at this PC,\nGPTVol1 is in here somewhere.\n\n136\n00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.400\nNotice it is 6 GB, just under 6 GB.\n\n137\n00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.830\nI see it as a single\ncontiguous storage space.\n\n138\n00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:15.210\nThat's what I mean when I say single\ncontiguous storage, all right?\n\n139\n00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.660\nBut we know there's nothing\ncontinuous about it.\n\n140\n00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:21.370\nIf I look at Disk Management, first of\nall, I can see that it's on two drives, so\n\n141\n00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:26.780\nportions of this volume are spanned\nacross more than a single drive.\n\n142\n00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:27.930\nThat's the span volume.\n\n143\n00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.620\nNow, what if you need a little\nbit of an improvement, right?\n\n144\n00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.620\nWhen it comes to performance,\n\n145\n00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:42.560\nthat's when you can get what's\nknown as a striped dynamic volume.\n\n146\n00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.030\n&gt;&gt; All right?\n\n147\n00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:48.380\nThe dynamic volume is stripped volume,\nit says let's go ahead and\n\n148\n00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.250\npair these two drives up, all right?\n\n149\n00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:55.150\nAnd what we're doing to to do is when\nan I/O, input/output request is made.\n\n150\n00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:59.790\nWe're gonna actually distribute\nthe I/O across both of those drives.\n\n151\n00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.470\nStripe it, if you will,\nacross both of those drives.\n\n152\n00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:06.630\nNow, there's some things that\nyou have to keep in mind here.\n\n153\n00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:13.570\nKeep in mind, [COUGH] that the drive\nsizes have to be equally sized.\n\n154\n00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:18.152\nThe other thing too is that the volumes\ncannot be mirror either and\n\n155\n00:09:18.152 --> 00:09:19.920\nthat's important.\n\n156\n00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:24.090\n&gt;&gt; So when will be uses drag volume,\nand when will we choose to do that?\n\n157\n00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.990\n&gt;&gt; Well, really in a scenario, where\nyou need improved performance, right?\n\n158\n00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:29.870\nWhen you need a higher level of\nperformance than a single disc is giving\n\n159\n00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:34.420\nyou ultimately, what would you wanna do,\nwith it's like a hard wired accelerated\n\n160\n00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.440\nRAID array aggregating\ntwo drives together.\n\n161\n00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:42.090\nBut if you don't have that RAID array,\nyou don't have that hardware capability,\n\n162\n00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:43.920\nthis allows you to do it in software.\n\n163\n00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.390\nAnd have the potential to again distribute\nthose I/Os, those input outputs, those\n\n164\n00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:51.190\nread and write operations across more than\none drive, increasing the performance.\n\n165\n00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:53.280\nLet me show you how you\nwould create one of these.\n\n166\n00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.090\nNow, I'm gonna use,\nunderstand that this can't be mirrored,\n\n167\n00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:59.560\nso I'm gonna use\nthe unallocated space here.\n\n168\n00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:03.440\nOut on disc two our,\none of our two dynamic volumes and\n\n169\n00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.340\nI'm gonna create New Striped Volume here.\n\n170\n00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:07.868\nAnd this wizard believe it or\n\n171\n00:10:07.868 --> 00:10:11.340\nnot is just like all the other wizards\nthat we've been working with, right?\n\n172\n00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's not much different here and\n\n173\n00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:14.660\nwe'll choose Next.\n\n174\n00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.680\nNow, remember that I told\nyou that with a stripe\n\n175\n00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:23.250\nthe volumes are a little bit different\nwhen you select them than they are span?\n\n176\n00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:28.828\nIn a stripped volume, you have to make\nsure that the volume sizes are the same.\n\n177\n00:10:28.828 --> 00:10:32.070\n&gt;&gt; All right, spanned gives you the option\nlike we see in the mix and match.\n\n178\n00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:34.990\nI can just say, just use a portion\nof this drive, all right?\n\n179\n00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:39.210\nAnd less of the second drive,\ncan't do that here, watch what happens.\n\n180\n00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:44.038\nFirst of all I'll select the drive, we're\ngonna use Disks 2 and 3 that we've been\n\n181\n00:10:44.038 --> 00:10:47.923\nusing, cuz they are already dynamic disks,\nand I Add, all right?\n\n182\n00:10:47.923 --> 00:10:54.580\nNow, notice what happens,\nnotice how if I remove that, all right?\n\n183\n00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:58.070\nLet me Add that back, all right?\n\n184\n00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:03.440\nNotice that when I'm adding the wrong disk\nhere, it's Disk 2 and Disk 3, all right?\n\n185\n00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.440\nNotice that if I decide they\nare going to use 8 GB, all right.\n\n186\n00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:11.350\nMaybe I wanna use, we've been using\n2 GB here, so let's use 2 GB.\n\n187\n00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.450\nNotice that when I typed\nin the selected amount,\n\n188\n00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:17.200\nit doesn't give me the option to pick and\nchoose which drive.\n\n189\n00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.215\nIt does it the same time,\nthey have to be allocated equally.\n\n190\n00:11:21.215 --> 00:11:22.855\nThe other thing to keep in mind too,\n\n191\n00:11:22.855 --> 00:11:25.595\nis that you can't turn around and\nmirror these.\n\n192\n00:11:25.595 --> 00:11:30.105\nAnother thing that you can't do\nis turn around and extend these.\n\n193\n00:11:30.105 --> 00:11:32.325\nThat's something that\nyou have to make sure.\n\n194\n00:11:32.325 --> 00:11:36.665\nWhat you would have to do to extend these\nis copy all the information off to another\n\n195\n00:11:36.665 --> 00:11:39.290\ndrive, delete the volume, and\n\n196\n00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:43.380\nrebuild the strike volume with the\nappropriate size, does that make sense?\n\n197\n00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:44.626\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So that's why we said\n\n198\n00:11:44.626 --> 00:11:48.450\nmake the choices now, [LAUGH] or\nforever hold your piece.\n\n199\n00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.354\nLet's go ahead and choose Next here,\n\n200\n00:11:51.354 --> 00:11:57.345\nwe'll just use the Next sequential drive\nletter and we'll just choose Next,\n\n201\n00:11:57.345 --> 00:12:01.448\nand we're gonna call this a StripedVol,\nall right?\n\n202\n00:12:01.448 --> 00:12:05.515\nI'm gonna do a quick format, as Zach\nreminded me this is a half-hour show, and\n\n203\n00:12:05.515 --> 00:12:07.290\nit's only a couple of terabytes.\n\n204\n00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:10.550\nBut, excuse me, not a couple of terabytes,\nit's only a couple of gigs.\n\n205\n00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:16.330\nBut if it was 2 TB, we would definitely\nhave some waiting to happen, all right?\n\n206\n00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:17.700\nNow, notice what has happened here.\n\n207\n00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.920\nI've got a volume here.\n\n208\n00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.620\nI've got a volume here.\n\n209\n00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:26.230\nIt is essentially going to distribute\nthe I/Os, the input/outputs, the reads and\n\n210\n00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.670\nthe writes, across both of these drives.\n\n211\n00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:33.159\nNow, keeping that in mind,\nin File Explorer here, if I go to this PC.\n\n212\n00:12:33.159 --> 00:12:36.941\nWhoa, sorry about that,\n[LAUGH] if I go to this PC here,\n\n213\n00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:40.170\nwe'll see that have the StripedVol, right?\n\n214\n00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:43.284\nNow, the StripedVol again is\nthe same contiguous space\n\n215\n00:12:43.284 --> 00:12:44.888\nto me in File Explorer here.\n\n216\n00:12:44.888 --> 00:12:50.214\nBut what's gonna happen is when\nI am writing to this drive,\n\n217\n00:12:50.214 --> 00:12:54.471\nI create me a new file,\nI say this is my New File,\n\n218\n00:12:54.471 --> 00:12:59.181\nbecause I am that creative and\nput some text in here.\n\n219\n00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.050\nWell, we have creativity all\nover the place today, right?\n\n220\n00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:07.150\nThis is my text, [LAUGH] and I saved this.\n\n221\n00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:12.140\nWhat ends up happening here is in\nthe background, transparent to the user\n\n222\n00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.850\nis the fact that portions of\nthat file that I just created or\n\n223\n00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:18.139\nbeing written to both of these drives.\n\n224\n00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:25.300\nWhen you break those I/Os down, whether\nit's reads or writes, you end up enhancing\n\n225\n00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:29.370\nor if you will, not just enhancing but\nelevating the performance levels.\n\n226\n00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:30.140\n&gt;&gt; That sounds great.\n\n227\n00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:38.000\n&gt;&gt; All right, now that brings us to\nour last dynamic volume that we have.\n\n228\n00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.990\nAnd that's what's known as\na mirrored volume, all right?\n\n229\n00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:45.030\nNow, Zach,\nyou've had questions about the other one.\n\n230\n00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:46.300\nYou got any questions about this one?\n\n231\n00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:51.220\n&gt;&gt; Well, a numeric volume, my guess is it\nwould just give you a heightened sense\n\n232\n00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:56.570\nof tolerance, fault-tolerance, also in\nsecurity because you have another copy.\n\n233\n00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:57.920\n&gt;&gt; That's absolutely right, right?\n\n234\n00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.020\nAnd the security part of that\nis the availability, right?\n\n235\n00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.782\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We gotta making sure that authorized\n\n236\n00:14:01.782 --> 00:14:03.620\nusers have access to their data.\n\n237\n00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.560\nAnd that's it,\nwhen we talk about a mirrored volume.\n\n238\n00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.890\nA mirrored volume gives you\nthat level of fault-tolerant,\n\n239\n00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:13.310\ntry that level of redundancy saying that,\nhey, now what is gonna happen is,\n\n240\n00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:20.290\nwe are going to create that identical\ncopy that is going to a one copy,\n\n241\n00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:22.970\nif we put a one drive, one copy or\nwe put on the other drive.\n\n242\n00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:27.340\nAnd every time you do it right\nyou're gonna write twice,\n\n243\n00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:31.580\nwhich means that if I lose one of the\ndrives, I still have a copy of my data,\n\n244\n00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:32.990\nhence the term, why they call it mirror.\n\n245\n00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:34.230\nYou've got a mirrored image.\n\n246\n00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:35.770\n&gt;&gt; That'd make me feel better.\n\n247\n00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:38.950\n&gt;&gt; All right, let me go ahead and\nwe'll create this one here.\n\n248\n00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:42.470\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nmention it while we're right here.\n\n249\n00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:45.360\nNotice the RAID-5 Volume,\nnotice how that's grayed out.\n\n250\n00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.608\nCan you see how that's a different color?\n\n251\n00:14:46.608 --> 00:14:47.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n252\n00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:51.170\n&gt;&gt; That's because that is only available\nin the server operating system families.\n\n253\n00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:54.420\nIt's part of the interface, so they\nkept it there without taking it out, but\n\n254\n00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:57.230\nthey greyed it out, cuz you don't have\nthat functionality in the client.\n\n255\n00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.090\nThat's why I said we only have one more.\n\n256\n00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:03.120\nTechnically, if this was a server,\nwe would have a couple more,\n\n257\n00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.870\nbut we're not worried about a server here.\n\n258\n00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:09.310\nAll right, and what we're gonna go is\nwe're gonna choose Next in our wizard.\n\n259\n00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:10.420\nI want you to see what happens.\n\n260\n00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:14.590\nI'm gonna add this three and\nnotice what happens to the Add button.\n\n261\n00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.501\nThat's it, that's all you get.\n\n262\n00:15:17.501 --> 00:15:22.200\nAll right, when you do a mirrored\nvolume you get two disks, that's it.\n\n263\n00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.400\nSo make sure you make the right choice.\n\n264\n00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.800\nPick the right choice, all right?\n\n265\n00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:33.390\nAnd I want you to also see that these just\nlike our StrikeVol are allocated equally.\n\n266\n00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:36.370\nIt have to be identical size volumes.\n\n267\n00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:38.143\nAll right, we'll choose Next.\n\n268\n00:15:38.143 --> 00:15:40.057\nLooks like we're up to letter O, wow,\n\n269\n00:15:40.057 --> 00:15:42.560\nwe're almost through\nthe whole entire alphabet.\n\n270\n00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.992\nIt's like a kids' show here, all right?\n\n271\n00:15:44.992 --> 00:15:48.666\nNow, the next thing that we got here is,\nwe will call this, and again,\n\n272\n00:15:48.666 --> 00:15:51.755\nyou should have seen this\nformatting volume wizard by now.\n\n273\n00:15:51.755 --> 00:15:55.500\nWe will call this the Mirror,\noops Something like that,\n\n274\n00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.929\nit doesn't help with spelling Wes.\n\n275\n00:15:57.929 --> 00:16:02.873\nMirroredval1 and\nwe will perform a quick format file and\n\n276\n00:16:02.873 --> 00:16:07.508\nenable file and folder and\ncompression, excuse me,\n\n277\n00:16:07.508 --> 00:16:12.455\nfile folder compression and\nthen we'll choose Finish.\n\n278\n00:16:12.455 --> 00:16:16.172\nAnd just when we thought we had\nall of the colors in the rainbow,\n\n279\n00:16:16.172 --> 00:16:17.939\nwe have one more color there.\n\n280\n00:16:17.939 --> 00:16:20.549\nAnd again, just kind of showing you\nthese colors so that you could see,\n\n281\n00:16:20.549 --> 00:16:22.350\nthat you're aware of them, right?\n\n282\n00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:27.580\nNow, that means anytime we write to this\nvolume here, we're going to then in turn\n\n283\n00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:32.620\nwrite an identical copy of that data\nset to the next volume likewise.\n\n284\n00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:39.420\nNow, again, in File Explorer, everyone one\nof these, even though you and I can see,\n\n285\n00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:42.020\nhell, looking behind the curtains,\ndon't look the behind the curtains, right?\n\n286\n00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.960\nWe don't want to look at the Wizard of Oz,\nright?\n\n287\n00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:48.890\nIf you peer through the curtain there,\nyou'll see that we have multiple drives\n\n288\n00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:51.230\nand there are all kinds of boxes here,\nright?\n\n289\n00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:53.210\nBut when I look at File Explorer,\n\n290\n00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:56.320\nall I see are those volumes\nthat have been created.\n\n291\n00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.490\nI don't see the fact that the stripe\nvolume is on too hard disk.\n\n292\n00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:03.080\nI don't see the fact that somewhere in\nhere is our mirror but there it it.\n\n293\n00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:06.430\n[LAUGH] MirroredVolt got lost in the mix,\nright?\n\n294\n00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:12.280\nOur MirroredVolt is actually on two hard\ndrives, it's transparent to us, right?\n\n295\n00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:16.569\nFile Explorer is showing you here's\nthe space that you have to work with.\n\n296\n00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:20.125\nDisk Management is showing you\nthe architecture underneath,\n\n297\n00:17:20.125 --> 00:17:22.720\nif that makes sense, all right?\n\n298\n00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.522\nNow, if we ever have\nto delete any volumes,\n\n299\n00:17:25.522 --> 00:17:28.270\nt hat's okay, we can do that, right?\n\n300\n00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:29.740\nIt's not that difficult.\n\n301\n00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:32.700\nLike for instance, I can go in here and\nI could say, you know what SimpleVol4?\n\n302\n00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.980\nI don't want that volume anymore.\n\n303\n00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:36.770\nI'm just gonna delete it.\n\n304\n00:17:38.665 --> 00:17:43.753\nAnd there we go, now we go back to\nour three primary partitions and\n\n305\n00:17:43.753 --> 00:17:48.949\nwe have our extended partition\nthat is still created, all right?\n\n306\n00:17:48.949 --> 00:17:53.773\nVery easy job when it comes to\nthe deleting your partitions,\n\n307\n00:17:53.773 --> 00:17:58.595\nif you will deleting your\nvolumes likewise too.\n\n308\n00:17:58.595 --> 00:18:04.240\nAll right now, that's a little bit\nabout how we work with our volumes.\n\n309\n00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.990\nHow we work with our storage.\n\n310\n00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:10.840\nKeep in mind,\nunderstand the disk types, all right?\n\n311\n00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:15.480\nUnderstand really you need all the way\nback to the very first episode, right?\n\n312\n00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.390\nUnderstand the storage\nmedium that you're using,\n\n313\n00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:21.573\nunderstand why you might use\none over the other, right?\n\n314\n00:18:21.573 --> 00:18:24.770\nWhy might I use USB over FireWire?\n\n315\n00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.030\nWell, if you remember,\nback in that first episode,\n\n316\n00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:31.800\nZach made one of the best\nstatements that hey,\n\n317\n00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:36.500\nI had a computer that didn't have FireWire\nin it, so I had to put a card in there.\n\n318\n00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:40.280\nSo that might be a reason you go with USB,\nall right?\n\n319\n00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:44.110\nBut keep in mind, things like large files,\nthey do better over FireWire.\n\n320\n00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:49.970\nLarge files do really well over FireWire,\nnot so fast under USB.\n\n321\n00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:54.800\nSo if you are dealing with a bunch\nof large contiguous files,\n\n322\n00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.840\nFireWire might be\na better option than USB.\n\n323\n00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.920\nHowever, if you have\nthe same amount of data but\n\n324\n00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.690\nthey're individual files USB\nis gonna perform better.\n\n325\n00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:05.370\nSo you have to understand\nthe research the device types too,\n\n326\n00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:09.080\ncuz the storage types are important,\nright?\n\n327\n00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.800\nOne is gonna outperform the other.\n\n328\n00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.860\nThe great thing about USB and FireWire is\nthey are always backwards compatible with\n\n329\n00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:18.150\nthe earlier standards provided\nthe ports are the same.\n\n330\n00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:21.060\nI gotta be careful when I say that because\nFireWire uses a couple of different ports\n\n331\n00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:23.270\nshapes.\n\n332\n00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:25.356\nUses a six-pin bullet shape connector,\n\n333\n00:19:25.356 --> 00:19:28.880\nit's power connector uses a four-pin\nsquare unpowered connector.\n\n334\n00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.640\nYou have to make sure\nthat the ports are right.\n\n335\n00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.860\nBut then once you have\nthe hardware figured out,\n\n336\n00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:39.330\nthen we have to figure out how do\nwe apply the partitioning system?\n\n337\n00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:41.840\nWhat partitioning style do we even want?\n\n338\n00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.610\nAlright, because that is going\nto define if we use MBR, yes,\n\n339\n00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:49.880\nwe have backwards compatibility legacy\nsystems, those scenarios, but if we need\n\n340\n00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:55.800\nlarge drive sizes up over two terabytes,\nMBR is not gonna be the way to go.\n\n341\n00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.602\nYou are going to move to GPT.\n\n342\n00:19:57.602 --> 00:20:00.817\nBut then if you put GPT on\na basic disc type, well,\n\n343\n00:20:00.817 --> 00:20:04.120\nnow you can't take advantage\nof dynamic volumes.\n\n344\n00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:08.870\nYes, I get 128 partitions, yes I get the\nredundancy in the boot loader that if one\n\n345\n00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:14.580\nportion of it is corrupted because\nit fails to the protected GPT and\n\n346\n00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:18.840\nrebuilds it so\nit has some good things involved with it.\n\n347\n00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.390\nBut we can't just stop there.\n\n348\n00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:23.370\nNow we have to figure out,\ndo I just need a simple,\n\n349\n00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:26.650\nsimplistic storage\nsolution on a single disk?\n\n350\n00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:31.976\nI'll go with the basic disk, however, if\nI want a little bit more fault tolerance,\n\n351\n00:20:31.976 --> 00:20:36.626\nif I wanna create a mirrored volume,\nif I want to create a strike volume and\n\n352\n00:20:36.626 --> 00:20:38.743\nget higher throughput, right?\n\n353\n00:20:38.743 --> 00:20:43.146\nIf I want to maybe kind of,\nI hate to say future-proof, but\n\n354\n00:20:43.146 --> 00:20:48.800\nkinda reassure myself that if I do start\nto accrue too much storage, right?\n\n355\n00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:53.290\nI start to run out of storage cuz\nmy primary disk is getting full,\n\n356\n00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:56.610\nwell if I have a basic disk I\nreally can't do anything, right?\n\n357\n00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:58.328\nI have to convert it to a dynamic disk and\n\n358\n00:20:58.328 --> 00:21:00.630\nthen I can span meta volume\nacross multiple drives.\n\n359\n00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:04.372\nTaking advantage of things\nlike the mirrored volumes,\n\n360\n00:21:04.372 --> 00:21:07.870\nthe striped volumes as well as\nyour span volumes, all right?\n\n361\n00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:10.520\nNow these are some of the things that\nwe have to look at when it comes to\n\n362\n00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.170\nunderstanding the storage.\n\n363\n00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:17.272\nAnd the last part what we're gonna do and\nyes, I just threw a last part there exact.\n\n364\n00:21:17.272 --> 00:21:17.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n365\n00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:20.863\nwhat we're gonna do is were\ngonna go until part four and\n\n366\n00:21:20.863 --> 00:21:25.420\nwhat we have to do is come back and\nlook a little bit about optimization.\n\n367\n00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:26.660\nHow do we optimize our drives?\n\n368\n00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:31.620\nOnce we know and we've got\nthe architecture, the DNA correct,\n\n369\n00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:36.105\nhow do we make sure that those drives stay\nup and running, and they run optimally?\n\n370\n00:21:36.105 --> 00:21:38.440\n[LAUGH] Right?\nThey run with the best performance.\n\n371\n00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.440\n&gt;&gt; And how do we secure our storage, too?\n\n372\n00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:43.440\n&gt;&gt; And how do we secure our storage?\n\n373\n00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.925\nThen, the other thing that we also have to\ntalk about, which, again, we're not going\n\n374\n00:21:46.925 --> 00:21:50.100\nto have time here, is we've been just\nprimarily talking about local storage.\n\n375\n00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:56.440\nAll right, so how about this Zach,\nhow about we come back and in part four?\n\n376\n00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.614\nLast part, I promise.\n\n377\n00:21:57.614 --> 00:21:58.843\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The last part,\n\n378\n00:21:58.843 --> 00:22:04.410\nwe look at how to optimize that storage,\nhow to secure that storage?\n\n379\n00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:06.780\nAnd we'll also show you how to\nput your head in the clouds.\n\n380\n00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:07.960\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, I can't wait.\n\n381\n00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.310\nUnderstanding storage\npart four is coming up.\n\n382\n00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:11.820\nMake sure you see part one, two and\n\n383\n00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:15.830\nthree, great information once it's put\ntogether for you, and he's put together\n\n384\n00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:19.320\na lot of great information inside\nthe Windows OS fundamental series.\n\n385\n00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:23.130\nSo make sure you see all those episodes\nand you're in the course library there's\n\n386\n00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:27.050\nthousands of other videos there,\nall designed to help you go further.\n\n387\n00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:31.450\nAnd tell everybody you know about\nITPro.TV, ITPro.TV is binge worthy.\n\n388\n00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:32.930\nThanks for watching I'm Zach Memos.\n\n389\n00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:33.800\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes

00:00:11.886\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.886 --> 00:00:14.640\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\njoining us here in ITPro TV,\n\n5\n00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.490\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.700\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, as we continue\non with Windows OS Fundamentals.\n\n7\n00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.830\nUnderstanding storage Part 4.\n\n8\n00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.930\nMake sure you see parts 1 through 3 and\nalso part 4.\n\n9\n00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.040\nAnd the person bringing us information\nwe need is the one and only Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.180\nWes, good to see you, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.550\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back, Zach.\n\n12\n00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.640\nThat's right,\nI promise we will wrap our storage and\n\n13\n00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.680\nunderstanding storage in this episode\nbecause through the last trilogy.\n\n14\n00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.300\n[LAUGH] We've essentially\nestablished what the storage is and\n\n15\n00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.960\nhow do we get it configured?\n\n16\n00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.460\nAll right, so at this point,\n\n17\n00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.690\nkeep in mind that over the last three\nepisodes that's what we've done.\n\n18\n00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.300\nIt's been about the configuration\nof that storage and\n\n19\n00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.490\nmaking sure that our storage is online and\nready to use.\n\n20\n00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.130\n&gt;&gt; And\nwhere we left off is optimizing drives.\n\n21\n00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.330\nWe haven't talked about that at all,\nso let's go.\n\n22\n00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.800\n&gt;&gt; All right, well let's do that.\n\n23\n00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.540\nSo there are a few things\nthat you have to optimize and\n\n24\n00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.720\nmake your drives perform\nthe best they can.\n\n25\n00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.020\nAs well as helping you get more\nutilization out of the drive space\n\n26\n00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.160\nthat you have, all right?\n\n27\n00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.000\nAnd what do I mean by that?\n\n28\n00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.780\nSome of the things that we have\nbuilt in or a couple things,\n\n29\n00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.250\nwe've got some attributes built in.\n\n30\n00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.050\nIn fact let's go to our\nWindows 10 machine and\n\n31\n00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.190\nI can kinda show you what I mean by this,\nall right?\n\n32\n00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.150\nSo I'm gonna just right-click,\nI don't even have to right-click.\n\n33\n00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.470\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nlaunch up our File Explorer here.\n\n34\n00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.367\nAll right, and inside of File Explorer,\nwhat we're gonna do is, I tell you what,\n\n35\n00:01:37.367 --> 00:01:39.385\nlet's go ahead and we'll select this PC.\n\n36\n00:01:39.385 --> 00:01:44.480\nWe're gonna select anyone of these\npartitions on these drives that we have.\n\n37\n00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.908\nWe're gonna right click, and\nwe're gonna choose Properties.\n\n38\n00:01:47.908 --> 00:01:53.630\nAll right, now,\nnotice on the properties of this\n\n39\n00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.120\ndrive, we get how much space is free,\nhow much space is used.\n\n40\n00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.160\nWe can see what the capacity is.\n\n41\n00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.120\nThat might not sound like an optimization\npoint and I understand that.\n\n42\n00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.440\nBut it is important to understand\nthat as that drive gets full\n\n43\n00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.760\nthe performance is going to decrease.\n\n44\n00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.370\nSo it is a good starting point to find\nout a little bit of information about\n\n45\n00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.040\nthe drive or\nthe storage device that you're using.\n\n46\n00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.170\nThe other thing that we have, if you\nremember as we were going through our\n\n47\n00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.020\nwizard, we were enabling file and\nfolder compression.\n\n48\n00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.890\nRemember then, what that does is that\nallows you to compress that drive and\n\n49\n00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.750\njust like it says, to save disk space.\n\n50\n00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.640\nNow one of the other things that I didn't\nmention that we mention when we talked\n\n51\n00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.080\nabout about our file systems,\nthe attributes.\n\n52\n00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.960\nWe talk about an indexing attribute,\nall right?\n\n53\n00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.820\nWhat is an indexing attribute?\n\n54\n00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.620\nWell, that's actually right here,\nallow the files on this drive to have\n\n55\n00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.350\nthe contents indexed in addition\nto the file properties, all right?\n\n56\n00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.640\nSo let's talk about indexing.\n\n57\n00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.360\nWhat does that do?\n\n58\n00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.070\nAll right,\nwell you have four basic file attributes.\n\n59\n00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.140\nRead only, archive system and\nhidden, right?\n\n60\n00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.920\nAnd again if you're not\nfamiliar with those go\n\n61\n00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.460\ncheck out our file system episode.\n\n62\n00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:13.310\nBut then Windows has\nsome extended attributes,\n\n63\n00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.540\nand more importantly I should say NTFS,\nthe file system docs.\n\n64\n00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.400\nAnd one of those is an indexing\nattribute that you see right here.\n\n65\n00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.846\nSo what does that mean?\n\n66\n00:03:21.846 --> 00:03:22.850\nAn index?\n\n67\n00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.338\nWell some of you might not\nremember what the index cards are.\n\n68\n00:03:26.338 --> 00:03:31.160\nI know Zach and I do cuz we have probably\nwritten more index cards than maybe\n\n69\n00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.120\nanybody wants to write,\nespecially when you're studying, okay?\n\n70\n00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.550\nWell imagine what you do\nwith an index card, right?\n\n71\n00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.640\nI write down a note and I put it in\nthe index card, and God, Rolodex,\n\n72\n00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.330\nthis can be even older right?\n\n73\n00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.830\nI'm really gonna age myself here, right?\n\n74\n00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.460\nAnd then if I needed that number,\nor I needed that fact,\n\n75\n00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.230\nor I needed that banana bread recipe,\nI could flip through the Rolodex.\n\n76\n00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.260\nI could find it in the index card and\nI could get to that information faster.\n\n77\n00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.297\nHow does that apply to your files?\n\n78\n00:03:55.297 --> 00:03:57.460\nIt's the same concept.\n\n79\n00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.460\nIf I put an index attribute on a file,\n\n80\n00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.320\nit lets the Windows search subsystem know,\nthere it is,\n\n81\n00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.970\nI found it, I found that attribute,\nit's indexed, I could find it faster.\n\n82\n00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.280\nNow, there is a little\nsomething to be said,\n\n83\n00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.490\nthat if you index everything,\nhave you indexed anything?\n\n84\n00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.470\nAll right, and\nI want you think about that.\n\n85\n00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.892\nThing about having a bookmark\nwithin a book, okay?\n\n86\n00:04:18.892 --> 00:04:22.040\nOne bookmark, easy to find,\ntwo book marks better to find,\n\n87\n00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.333\nstart to get color coding and\nmaybe get four, five bookmarks.\n\n88\n00:04:25.333 --> 00:04:29.030\nBy the time you put 100\nbookmarks in that book,\n\n89\n00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.830\ncan you really tell what\nyou've bookmarked anymore?\n\n90\n00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:34.570\nAll right?\n\n91\n00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.040\nAnd the answer's probably no.\n\n92\n00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.720\nSo if you index everything and\n\n93\n00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.680\neverything has been indexed, nothing\nhas been indexed essentially because.\n\n94\n00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.403\n&gt;&gt; Agree.\n\n95\n00:04:42.403 --> 00:04:46.720\n&gt;&gt; You're trying to find it faster,\nall right?\n\n96\n00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.230\nSo again, I just throw that out there.\n\n97\n00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.142\nNow, here's another thing I\nwant you to keep in mind too.\n\n98\n00:04:52.142 --> 00:04:55.580\nYou get a lot of temporary files,\nall right?\n\n99\n00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.132\nThat get stored across\nyour storage devices.\n\n100\n00:04:58.132 --> 00:05:03.370\nThese could be user files, these could be\nInternet files, they could be logs, right?\n\n101\n00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:09.360\nThey could be applications,\nyou install some kind of application and\n\n102\n00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.920\nthen it creates a log and it puts it in\nyour system file somewhere in a log that\n\n103\n00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.030\nyou'll never see again,\nyou're never to use.\n\n104\n00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.637\nDo you need that file there?\n\n105\n00:05:17.637 --> 00:05:20.095\nNo.\nCould it potentially be slowing up\n\n106\n00:05:20.095 --> 00:05:24.100\nthe process of finding\nfiles that you do need?\n\n107\n00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.060\nYes, it can.\n\n108\n00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.820\nAnd that's where this\nlittle utility comes,\n\n109\n00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.590\nthat is right on the properties of\nthe hard drive if we look here.\n\n110\n00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.010\nRight here from the properties\non the General tab,\n\n111\n00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.775\nnotice I have this Disk Cleanup.\n\n112\n00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:44.030\nAnd if I run Disk Cleanup, it's gonna tell\nme, you can use Disk Cleanup to free up,\n\n113\n00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:49.070\nand in this case I don't have anything,\nwe've just created these drives,\n\n114\n00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:54.420\nand partitions, so it looks like I\ndon't have any information in here.\n\n115\n00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.420\nWhat I can do is can run this.\n\n116\n00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.930\nAnd I can turn around and\n\n117\n00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.660\nwhen I say okay it's gonna ask me do I\nwanna permanently delete these files?\n\n118\n00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.320\nAnd we can delete these files and\nit's gonna go through and\n\n119\n00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.720\nit's gonna delete them.\n\n120\n00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.700\nNow, that was a little fast because\nthere isn't anything really to delete.\n\n121\n00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.887\nLet me show you something on local disk C\nbecause you can also do this to optimizer\n\n122\n00:06:15.887 --> 00:06:18.775\nstorage on your basic local\ndisk that you use, right?\n\n123\n00:06:18.775 --> 00:06:23.728\nYour operating system drive, so same\nthing, right-click, choose Properties,\n\n124\n00:06:23.728 --> 00:06:29.039\nnotice that from the Properties option,\nWe have Disk Cleanup as well.\n\n125\n00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:33.449\nAnd when I choose Disk Cleanup,\nnotice it says Update Packages,\n\n126\n00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:35.214\nWindows Update Cleanup,\n\n127\n00:06:35.214 --> 00:06:40.347\nit could even say previous Windows\nInstallations if you've done an in place\n\n128\n00:06:40.347 --> 00:06:45.900\nupgrade where it puts the old Windows\ninstallation in c:Windows.old, right?\n\n129\n00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.850\nIf you try to manually delete that folder,\nWindows still sees it as a system\n\n130\n00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:54.700\ndirectory and it's gonna give you a whole\nbunch of access denied warnings, right?\n\n131\n00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.120\nBut, if you come in here and\nrun Disk Cleanup,\n\n132\n00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.780\nthen what you'll end up seeing is\npotentially seeing it in the list.\n\n133\n00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.100\nNow, here we can see\na little more information,\n\n134\n00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.200\nlike I was saying, Zach, right?\n\n135\n00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.905\nDownloaded programs, temporary Internet\nfiles, it's kind of hard to see stuff\n\n136\n00:07:08.905 --> 00:07:12.327\non a drive and partition that\nyou've never put any data on.\n\n137\n00:07:12.327 --> 00:07:14.268\nBut you can see there's some information,\n\n138\n00:07:14.268 --> 00:07:17.110\nand I can see just basically it's\ngonna free up about 12 megs.\n\n139\n00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:21.088\nI've actually seen this work,\nit frees up 30 gigs, and\n\n140\n00:07:21.088 --> 00:07:24.680\nthat's because of the old\nWindows installations.\n\n141\n00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:30.150\nNow it's gonna do the same thing,\nmaybe might not run, take Driver Pack,\n\n142\n00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:34.172\ndownload program files, right, so\nit might take a little bit, right?\n\n143\n00:07:34.172 --> 00:07:37.080\nThis one actually,\nI'm glad it's taking not that long.\n\n144\n00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.190\nI've seen this sit there and\ntake forever, all right?\n\n145\n00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:45.130\nBut there, Disk Cleanup,\ndeleting those temporary files, all right?\n\n146\n00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:50.460\nNow we have other things that we can do\nto optimize our storage devices, right?\n\n147\n00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.100\nOne of those things is called\na disk defragmenter, all right?\n\n148\n00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.913\nNow disk defragmenter,\nwe wanna understand,\n\n149\n00:07:56.913 --> 00:08:01.694\nand again we talked about this\nin our file systems episode.\n\n150\n00:08:01.694 --> 00:08:04.602\nAbout this Basically the noncontiguous\nfiles being spread out across\n\n151\n00:08:04.602 --> 00:08:07.070\nthe traditional mechanical drive, right?\n\n152\n00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:12.007\nWell if we want to run our disk\ndefragmenter and we want to kind of\n\n153\n00:08:12.007 --> 00:08:17.134\ndefragment the fragmented files and\nthe fragmented free space,\n\n154\n00:08:17.134 --> 00:08:21.439\nwe can run the Optimize and\ndefragment drive utility.\n\n155\n00:08:21.439 --> 00:08:23.195\nThis is also in your Administrative Tools.\n\n156\n00:08:23.195 --> 00:08:24.620\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; If you were in WIndows 7,\n\n157\n00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:26.855\nit was called Disk Defragmenter,\nall right?\n\n158\n00:08:26.855 --> 00:08:29.590\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Same concept, same utility,\n\n159\n00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:33.840\nnew coat of paint, new terminology,\npretty much the same thing.\n\n160\n00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.110\nDon't let it confuse you.\n\n161\n00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:38.496\nAnd I could turn around and\nI could choose Optimize Drive.\n\n162\n00:08:38.496 --> 00:08:43.480\nNow you will see that there are a few\ndrives here that let us know that\n\n163\n00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:47.220\noptimization isn't available,\nall right, and\n\n164\n00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.930\nthat's because these\nare solid state drives.\n\n165\n00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:54.940\nSolid state drives do not work the same\nway a traditional mechanical drive does.\n\n166\n00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:59.806\nThat's why it's saying not optimized,\nall right, or optimization not available,\n\n167\n00:08:59.806 --> 00:09:03.287\nand you will see that,\nyou should see that that happens here.\n\n168\n00:09:03.287 --> 00:09:07.720\nBut what I would do is I would choose\noptimize and it would go through\n\n169\n00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:12.471\nthe process of analyzing it, and\nthen finding the fragmented files and\n\n170\n00:09:12.471 --> 00:09:17.530\nrearranging them in the order that\nwe want, to find them faster.\n\n171\n00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:21.550\nAll right, Analyze just says,\nhey does it need optimize?\n\n172\n00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:22.680\nThat's all it's doing.\n\n173\n00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.360\nOptimize says, go ahead and\nanalyze it but then finish the process.\n\n174\n00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:29.030\nGo ahead and optimize it, but\nthen another thing that you can do,\n\n175\n00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:32.730\nyou can see that we want to\nschedule the optimization.\n\n176\n00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:33.550\nI didn't turn this on.\n\n177\n00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:36.821\nWhat do you mean it's being done,\nthe frequency is weekly.\n\n178\n00:09:36.821 --> 00:09:40.697\nWell, that's because since the days\nof Vista your disk defragmenter is\n\n179\n00:09:40.697 --> 00:09:41.870\na scheduled task.\n\n180\n00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:46.230\nSo, it's on by default being scheduled,\nall right?\n\n181\n00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:49.680\nBut I can change the settings if I want\nbut just because it's got a default,\n\n182\n00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.696\ndoesn't mean we can't stray\nfrom the defaults, right?\n\n183\n00:09:51.696 --> 00:09:55.310\nAnd it also lets you know that hey,\nwe tried to run this thing three times and\n\n184\n00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:56.610\nthey had been missed, right?\n\n185\n00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:57.790\nSo it gives you a notification.\n\n186\n00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:01.930\nBut we can also change it from daily,\nweekly to monthly, all right?\n\n187\n00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:04.610\nWe can also, if we want,\nchoose which drives.\n\n188\n00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:08.330\nNow as you've seen in our storage episode,\n\n189\n00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.910\nyou probably won't have this\nmany drives in a single device.\n\n190\n00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:18.360\nYou could, but notice that it's asking\nus which ones do we wanna optimize.\n\n191\n00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.740\nAnd I could pick those, right?\n\n192\n00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:23.900\nOr I could say, you know what,\nthe moment you put a drive in that system,\n\n193\n00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:27.290\ngo ahead and just optimize it,\ndon't wait for me to say anything.\n\n194\n00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:30.100\nI'm gonna go ahead or configure it,\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n195\n00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.700\nsay cancel to this, cancel.\n\n196\n00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.030\nBut that is your disk defragmenter,\n\n197\n00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:38.482\nalso known as the drive optimize or\nOptimize and defragment drives.\n\n198\n00:10:38.482 --> 00:10:42.970\nAll right, now we've got another thing\ntoo that I want to mention here, and\n\n199\n00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:44.877\nthat's this one right up here.\n\n200\n00:10:44.877 --> 00:10:49.049\nAll right, now as we've been formatting\nour partitions and we've been applying\n\n201\n00:10:49.049 --> 00:10:52.796\nfile systems one of these things that I\ntold you is if you do a quick format,\n\n202\n00:10:52.796 --> 00:10:56.300\nyou just, you basically put a new\nfile system over the old one.\n\n203\n00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:58.340\nBut if you do a full format,\n\n204\n00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:02.790\nyou uncheck that dialog box,\nthen what happens is it runs Check Disk.\n\n205\n00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:03.310\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n206\n00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:04.160\n&gt;&gt; Checks for errors.\n\n207\n00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.130\nWell guess what,\nyou can also manually do that, too.\n\n208\n00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:09.770\nLet's say we did a full format.\n\n209\n00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.060\nOr maybe you didn't do a full format.\n\n210\n00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.810\nEither way, do a full format.\n\n211\n00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:15.470\nYou start to use your drive for\na little bit.\n\n212\n00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:18.180\nIt's gonna get fragments,\nit's gonna be errors there.\n\n213\n00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.120\nWindows is pretty good, being a journal\nfile system like other journal\n\n214\n00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.930\nfile systems, of maintaining\nthe integrity of that file system.\n\n215\n00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:27.360\nBut sometimes errors happen and\nyou might not be aware of it.\n\n216\n00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.400\nSo it is a good thing to come in here\nonce in a while and check for errors.\n\n217\n00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.750\nNow, you're gonna see that, again,\nI got a solid state drive here so\n\n218\n00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:37.340\nit's a little bit different but it says,\nhey, we haven't found any errors on this\n\n219\n00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.630\ndrive but you could still\nscan the drive if you want.\n\n220\n00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:41.320\nAll right, and we can choose scan drive.\n\n221\n00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.560\nNotice it says about\nthat's about five seconds.\n\n222\n00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.080\nThat's actually not that bad.\n\n223\n00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.100\nBut I've seen this one take a long time,\ntoo.\n\n224\n00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.380\nJust like drive optimizer.\n\n225\n00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.890\nJust like the quick format that you\nmentioned in the first episodes.\n\n226\n00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:53.680\nHow long will that quick format take?\n\n227\n00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.550\nA long time, well, if you've got a pretty\nbig drive, it could take a while.\n\n228\n00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:01.500\nAnd as it goes through it looks at the\ndifferent areas across this drive finding,\n\n229\n00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.690\ntrying to see if there's any errors.\n\n230\n00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:05.600\nAnd then fixing those\nerrors if they are present.\n\n231\n00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.880\nNow, you could do this,\nand let me go ahead and\n\n232\n00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.150\ndrop down to our command prompt tool.\n\n233\n00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:13.520\nBecause you could do this,\n\n234\n00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:17.610\nand I'm gonna run this as administrator\nhere because that's the GUI version.\n\n235\n00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:23.310\nYou also have CHKDSK how about we\nspell it right, Wes, CHKDSK and\n\n236\n00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:26.290\nif you do a forward slash question mark\nyou can see that you have some options.\n\n237\n00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:30.190\nThis is Check-disk,\nas it's known in the command prompt.\n\n238\n00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:35.047\nAll right, and there's couple\nof options there, /F and /R.\n\n239\n00:12:35.047 --> 00:12:37.157\nF just fixes the errors on the disk,\nR says,\n\n240\n00:12:37.157 --> 00:12:40.867\nhey, if there's bad sectors there and\nthere's recoverable information,\n\n241\n00:12:40.867 --> 00:12:45.034\nthere's readable information, read that\ninformation out of that failing sector and\n\n242\n00:12:45.034 --> 00:12:47.110\nwrite it to a new portion\nof the hard drive.\n\n243\n00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:49.940\nMark that sector as bad, so\nthat we don't use it anymore.\n\n244\n00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.250\nNow let's go on with our day, all right?\n\n245\n00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:57.181\nHowever if you do run R to try to\nlocate and recover that information,\n\n246\n00:12:57.181 --> 00:13:00.846\nit's also gonna perform\nthe fix error scan, too.\n\n247\n00:13:00.846 --> 00:13:02.662\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; That's why I said it implies F,\n\n248\n00:13:02.662 --> 00:13:04.690\nit does both, right?\n\n249\n00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:08.810\nSo, little way that we\ncan optimize our drive.\n\n250\n00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:12.900\nThese are some of the techniques, when\nit comes to drive optimization, is very,\n\n251\n00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:13.720\nvery important.\n\n252\n00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.710\nOnce you have figured out how you\nwanna configure your storage,\n\n253\n00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:21.560\nit's up to you as help desk, it's up to\nyou if you're supporting an end user,\n\n254\n00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.830\nto make sure that those drives,\nand those storage devices\n\n255\n00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:28.680\nmaintain full functionality and perform\nthe way we would like them to perform.\n\n256\n00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.800\n&gt;&gt; And Wes, what options do we\nhave when it comes to securing\n\n257\n00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.370\nour information, our stories.\n\n258\n00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:36.050\n&gt;&gt; That's interesting, we really haven't\ntalked about that, we talked about putting\n\n259\n00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:39.880\nthat information on the drive and\nmaybe even taking it off the drive,\n\n260\n00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.220\nwe showed you how how to delete\na partition, but I haven't told you how to\n\n261\n00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.630\nsecure some of that information and\nwe've got a couple of options, all right.\n\n262\n00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:50.920\nOne of the options we have is an attribute\nthat is already a part of NTFS, right,\n\n263\n00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.940\nthe New Technology File System,\nlet me show you what I mean here.\n\n264\n00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:58.820\nAll right, so notice that we had,\nwe pulled up the properties of our drive.\n\n265\n00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:02.240\nLet me go ahead and get into,\nwe'll go ahead into SimpleVol2 and\n\n266\n00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:07.710\nI'm gonna right click and\nI'm gonna choose New,\n\n267\n00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:12.940\nText Document, and we're gonna call\nthis text document, I don't know.\n\n268\n00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.930\nTop Secret, all right.\n\n269\n00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:20.690\nNow I wanna make sure that only I\nhave access to this information.\n\n270\n00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:22.510\nI wanna make sure that when Zach logs in,\n\n271\n00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:25.210\nnothing against you Zach,\n[LAUGH] he's a good guy.\n\n272\n00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:31.630\nWhen you login Zach, that you can't open\nthis information up and you can't read it.\n\n273\n00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:32.350\nSo how do I do that?\n\n274\n00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:36.220\nWell, I could do it by an access control\nlist, we could do permissions on it.\n\n275\n00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:37.760\nThat's one of the ways we can secure.\n\n276\n00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.350\nAnd you know it's not in the list, but\nthat's one of the ways we can secure our\n\n277\n00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:42.680\ndrives too, is just to use ACLs,\npermissions.\n\n278\n00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:43.250\nSet up permissions.\n\n279\n00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:45.390\nI don't want Zach to have access to it,\nI don't give him access to it,\n\n280\n00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:46.410\nright, it would be simple.\n\n281\n00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:48.790\nHowever, if I wanna go a little\nbit farther than that and\n\n282\n00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:53.520\nI wanna secure the whole entire file and\nnot use an access control list,\n\n283\n00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.790\nif I right click on the file, notice that\nI have these attributes, these a some of\n\n284\n00:14:56.790 --> 00:15:00.140\nthose basic attributes right here that\nwe talked about, Read-only and Hidden.\n\n285\n00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:03.189\nBut if I go to the Advanced tab,\nthis Advanced tab right here,\n\n286\n00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:07.890\nyou'll notice that there\nare some other attributes, right.\n\n287\n00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:11.730\nFile attributes, archive attributes,\nthe indexing one that we talked about for\n\n288\n00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:13.040\noptimization.\n\n289\n00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.780\nWell, notice that there's the compress\ncontents to save disk space.\n\n290\n00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.930\nAll right, that's the file and\nfolder compression that we talked about,\n\n291\n00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:22.360\nbut notice this encrypt\ncontents to secure data.\n\n292\n00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.723\nWhen I turn that on, all right, and\nwe'll go ahead and apply that and\n\n293\n00:15:27.723 --> 00:15:29.527\nI choose OK, and I apply it,\n\n294\n00:15:29.527 --> 00:15:33.840\nwhat this is gonna do is this is\ngonna turn on something known as EFS.\n\n295\n00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:38.879\nIt's gonna apply that encryption algorithm\nor that encryption attribute and\n\n296\n00:15:38.879 --> 00:15:43.392\nit's going to encrypt the file,\nlet me go ahead and choose OK to this.\n\n297\n00:15:43.392 --> 00:15:47.058\nAnd, one of the things,\nif we give it a second,\n\n298\n00:15:47.058 --> 00:15:50.290\nI might have done that a little too quick.\n\n299\n00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:53.613\nIt looks like it's working.\nSometimes it takes a second to initiate\n\n300\n00:15:53.613 --> 00:15:56.307\nthe, there it goes, there it goes.\n\n301\n00:15:56.307 --> 00:15:57.392\nJust not patient enough.\n\n302\n00:15:57.392 --> 00:15:59.037\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n303\n00:15:59.037 --> 00:16:02.700\n&gt;&gt; Let me zoom in here, and\nyou see this little lock right here, Zach?\n\n304\n00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.590\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes yes.\n&gt;&gt; That let's me know that this is now\n\n305\n00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:07.810\nencrypted with something known as EFS,\nthe Encrypted File System.\n\n306\n00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:11.100\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And that means, since I am the owner,\n\n307\n00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.540\nright, not only could I set permissions,\nbut since I'm the owner,\n\n308\n00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:17.792\nwhat my computer did was just generated\na key pair and encrypted this file.\n\n309\n00:16:17.792 --> 00:16:21.000\nSo that I have to be the one logged in\n\n310\n00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.340\nthat will have the other key\nthat will unlock this file.\n\n311\n00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:25.780\n&gt;&gt; I mean, this is all files?\n\n312\n00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:26.550\nOr just that one file?\n\n313\n00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:28.180\n&gt;&gt; Just that file, right?\n\n314\n00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:34.000\nSo we've got, the way we can\nencrypt on a file by file basis.\n\n315\n00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:34.500\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n316\n00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:39.820\n&gt;&gt; All right, now, what if you don't wanna\nencrypt on a file by file basis, right?\n\n317\n00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:41.790\nWell, Zach, I'm not worried about Zach.\n\n318\n00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:43.857\nZach can have access to this computer,\nI wouldn't care.\n\n319\n00:16:43.857 --> 00:16:46.910\nSo, EFS, just an analogy, right?\n\n320\n00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:51.830\nBut what if I wanna make sure that\nboth Zach and my data are secure?\n\n321\n00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:55.585\nWell, we could do the task of,\nwell, Zach you go ahead and\n\n322\n00:16:55.585 --> 00:16:59.370\nennable EFS, I'll go ahead and enable EFS.\n\n323\n00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:00.480\nBut you know what I didn't do?\n\n324\n00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.760\nI didn't enable EFS on this program and\nthat program's data.\n\n325\n00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.550\nWouldn't be nice to say, hey,\nyou know what, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n326\n00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:10.100\nwe're gonna encrypt\nthe entire hard drives.\n\n327\n00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:11.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was just gonna say,\nthat would be great.\n\n328\n00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:13.120\n&gt;&gt; Well, you know-\n&gt;&gt; Do the whole thing.\n\n329\n00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:16.490\nSo what we do is we implement something\nknown as BitLocker drive encryption.\n\n330\n00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:17.600\n&gt;&gt; BitLocker, yeah.\n\n331\n00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.190\n&gt;&gt; We talk about BitLocker\ndrive encryption,\n\n332\n00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:21.790\nthat is a full disk encryption.\n\n333\n00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:25.230\nAnd it works with something known as\na TPM, a trusted platform module, which is\n\n334\n00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:29.020\na cryptographic processor, just a hardware\nchip embedded into the motherboard.\n\n335\n00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:32.720\nThat, when you enable BitLocker and\nit does its full disk encryption,\n\n336\n00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:37.010\nit stores that security information\ninside of that hardware based processor.\n\n337\n00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:41.790\nAnd if that drive is pulled\nout of the machine that\n\n338\n00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:47.200\nBitLocker was initially configured on,\nand you put it in another system,\n\n339\n00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:51.210\nsay, maybe doing and attack, trying\nto pull that data off of that drive.\n\n340\n00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:53.700\nWhen that drive initiates,\nit's gonna look for that TPM,\n\n341\n00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.290\nthat trusted platform module.\n\n342\n00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:58.250\nIt isn't gonna find it, and it's gonna\nthrow it into a recovery mode and\n\n343\n00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:59.760\nlock the drive down.\n\n344\n00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:00.306\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n345\n00:18:00.306 --> 00:18:02.028\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n346\n00:18:02.028 --> 00:18:04.950\nNow, what if you don't have a TPM?\n\n347\n00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:07.580\nNot every machine has\na trusted platform module,\n\n348\n00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.550\neven though it's an industry wide\nstandard, not every machine has one.\n\n349\n00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:14.400\nSo can you still use BitLocker\nif you don't have a TPM?\n\n350\n00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.850\nWell, it supports two modes,\nit supports TPM mode, and non-TPM mode.\n\n351\n00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:23.500\nTPM mode is you get the full encryption,\nthe full deal, all right?\n\n352\n00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.630\nGet the highest level of encryption.\n\n353\n00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:30.990\nHowever, if you don't have a TPM,\nyou could fall back to non-TPM mode and\n\n354\n00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:34.960\nstill encrypt a drive, but it does reduce\nsecurity because now what you have to use\n\n355\n00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.490\nis a USB thumb drive that you plug into\nthe machine at the time that you boot it,\n\n356\n00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:41.540\nand it will have your\nsecurity information.\n\n357\n00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:43.440\nOr you use a password.\n\n358\n00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.770\nOr you can actually use a combination\nof all three, if you want.\n\n359\n00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:50.630\nUse a personal identification number,\na password, if you will, a USB drive, and\n\n360\n00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:53.350\nthe TPM, all right?\n\n361\n00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:55.494\nBut if you're gonna support non-TPM mode,\n\n362\n00:18:55.494 --> 00:18:58.150\nthere are some things that you\nhave to do to initialize it.\n\n363\n00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:59.220\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n364\n00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:01.380\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nget into File Explorer.\n\n365\n00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:05.870\nAnd when I launch up File Explorer,\nI'm gonna choose this PC on the right.\n\n366\n00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:11.000\nAnd let's see here,\nwe will choose local disk C.\n\n367\n00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.660\nAnd in local disk C, what I'm gonna\ndo is I'm just gonna right-click and\n\n368\n00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.800\nI'm gonna choose turn on BitLocker,\nall right?\n\n369\n00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:23.020\nOr wait, maybe I don't,\nmaybe I'm not gonna turn on BitLocker.\n\n370\n00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:24.320\nNotice what it says.\n\n371\n00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:27.560\nThis device can't use\na Trusted Platform Module.\n\n372\n00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:28.260\nThat's the TPM.\n\n373\n00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.480\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n374\n00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:30.240\n&gt;&gt; Notice what it says here.\n\n375\n00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:35.720\nAdministrator must set the Allow BitLocker\nwithout compatible TPM option\n\n376\n00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:42.250\nin the required additional authentication\nat startup policy for the OS volume.\n\n377\n00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:43.275\nWhat the heck does that mean?\n\n378\n00:19:43.275 --> 00:19:44.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n379\n00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:49.380\nWell, in short, it means you have to\nopen up something known as group policy.\n\n380\n00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:54.260\nAnd in group policy what you can do is\ndefine a setting that says you don't\n\n381\n00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:58.250\nhave a TPM, that's okay, we'll let you\nuse some other authentication mechanisms.\n\n382\n00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:00.290\nLet me show you how you would do that,\nall right?\n\n383\n00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:04.760\nSo moving out here, we'll go ahead and\nclose our File Explorer down for now.\n\n384\n00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:10.330\nAnd if I get into our little search\nfunctionality, I'm gonna type gpedit.msc.\n\n385\n00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:13.530\nThis is our group policy\nmanagement console.\n\n386\n00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:16.092\nAnd did I do that so\nfast that she still can't, Cortana, okay,\n\n387\n00:20:16.092 --> 00:20:17.788\nI was gonna say, Cortana can't find it.\n\n388\n00:20:17.788 --> 00:20:19.540\n[LAUGH] Let me go ahead and launch it up.\n\n389\n00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:23.440\nSometimes you type so\nfast that Cortana doesn't react as fast.\n\n390\n00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:26.570\n&gt;&gt; All right, and if I go ahead and\nI expand out group policy.\n\n391\n00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:28.862\nRemember what group policy\ndoes just basically?\n\n392\n00:20:28.862 --> 00:20:33.330\nThis allows me essentially to define a\ncomputer setting like we're gonna do here.\n\n393\n00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:37.010\nAnd it applies to the computer,\nwhich means that everybody that logs in,\n\n394\n00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:38.250\nthat policy also applies.\n\n395\n00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:42.533\nIf I apply a user policy,\nI'm saying when the user logs in,\n\n396\n00:20:42.533 --> 00:20:45.200\napply this configuration, right?\n\n397\n00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:50.243\nAnd its gonna be something that applies\nto every user that logs into the machine,\n\n398\n00:20:50.243 --> 00:20:50.770\nright?\n\n399\n00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:53.160\nNot necessarily a computer configuration.\n\n400\n00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:56.590\nBut we're gonna be under Computer\nConfiguration, Administrative Templates,\n\n401\n00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:58.460\nand Windows Components.\n\n402\n00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:03.040\nAnd about a few folders down here,\nyou will see a BitLocker Drive Encryption.\n\n403\n00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:06.060\nIf we expand this out,\nwe've got three different drive types.\n\n404\n00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:07.830\nFixed Data Drive.\n\n405\n00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:08.950\nWhat's that about?\n\n406\n00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:13.130\nThat's anything other than where you\noperating system is installed, all right?\n\n407\n00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:15.590\nSo C: is actually\nan operating system drive, so\n\n408\n00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:17.540\nit falls under the second category.\n\n409\n00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.340\nSimple Vol 1 through 1,000,\n\n410\n00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:23.730\nor however many I created, those are data\ndrives, fixed data drives, right?\n\n411\n00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:25.840\nThey don't have an operating system on it,\nall right?\n\n412\n00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.720\nSo you have to be careful\non which one you choose.\n\n413\n00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:32.050\nRemovable data drives, that's nice,\nthat's a newer feature, relatively new in\n\n414\n00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:35.100\nthe timeline of BitLocker cuz\nBitLocker has been around since Vista.\n\n415\n00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:38.690\nSomething known as BitLocker to go, right?\n\n416\n00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:42.693\nUSB keys, you wanna plug a USB key in,\nyou want to encrypt it with BitLocker,\n\n417\n00:21:42.693 --> 00:21:43.628\nyou can, right?\n\n418\n00:21:43.628 --> 00:21:47.932\nBecause USB keys, that's an easy way for\nsomebody to lose data,\n\n419\n00:21:47.932 --> 00:21:52.150\nand data to get pirated,\ndata to fall into the wrong hands.\n\n420\n00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:56.140\nSo wouldn't it be nice to take\nBitLocker and encrypt those USB drives?\n\n421\n00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:59.460\nThe one that I want is\nOperating System Drives.\n\n422\n00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:05.190\nAnd when I move over here, you'll see\nthere are a whole bunch of settings\n\n423\n00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:07.430\nthat we could configure for BitLocker.\n\n424\n00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:10.500\nBut the one that I want, the one\nthat they were talking about in that\n\n425\n00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:14.490\ncrazy dialogue box there is require\nadditional authentication at startup.\n\n426\n00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:17.410\nAnd notice that it isn't configured,\nall right?\n\n427\n00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:20.490\nNow, if I had this in\na corporate environment,\n\n428\n00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:24.050\nI would be creating what's known\nas a domain based group policy,\n\n429\n00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:28.180\nwhich means I could apply it at a certain\nlevel within my corporate environment, and\n\n430\n00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.856\nit would apply to all\nthe computers within that network.\n\n431\n00:22:30.856 --> 00:22:32.100\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n&gt;&gt; But we're gonna go ahead and\n\n432\n00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:35.290\ndo this at the local level, so it's only\ngonna apply locally to this machine,\n\n433\n00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:36.080\nall right?\n\n434\n00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.000\nAnd I'm gonna select it,\nI'm gonna right-click, and\n\n435\n00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.900\nI'm gonna choose Edit, all right?\n\n436\n00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:43.030\nAnd when I choose Edit,\nthese are the policy settings.\n\n437\n00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:47.310\nNotice that it is not configured,\nit isn't configured, all right?\n\n438\n00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:53.630\nAnd when I get in here, notice that I have\nAllow BitLocker without a compatible TPM.\n\n439\n00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:58.320\nRequires a password or a start-up\nkey on a USB flash drive, right?\n\n440\n00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:58.960\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n441\n00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.060\n&gt;&gt; This is the one that we want.\n\n442\n00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:01.890\nWe choose Enable.\n\n443\n00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:05.475\nBut then, it also says, hey,\nyou can allow the TPM, right?\n\n444\n00:23:05.475 --> 00:23:07.598\nYou can still allow the TPM, right?\n\n445\n00:23:07.598 --> 00:23:10.710\nSo, and\nhere's why you might do this, right?\n\n446\n00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:12.750\nOn this local machine,\nI don't have a TPM, so\n\n447\n00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:14.560\nwhy does that setting even bother to me?\n\n448\n00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:19.600\nWell, this interface is no different\nthat it is in the Domain Group Policy.\n\n449\n00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.790\nA slight difference, but for\nthe most part it's the same, right?\n\n450\n00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:27.712\nAnd if I wanna apply this to multiple\ncomputers, and some of them have TPMs, and\n\n451\n00:23:27.712 --> 00:23:31.840\nsome of them don't, well,\nthis setting applied to both of them.\n\n452\n00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.421\nIt says, hey, for\nthose of you that don't have a TPM,\n\n453\n00:23:34.421 --> 00:23:36.680\nallow the BitLocker\nwithout a compatible TPM.\n\n454\n00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:37.320\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n455\n00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.360\n&gt;&gt; You know what?\nThose of you that do have a TPM,\n\n456\n00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.560\nallow the TPM, right?\n\n457\n00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:43.441\nSo you kinda get the best of both.\n\n458\n00:23:43.441 --> 00:23:47.771\nBut keep in mind that you are gonna\nslightly reduce the security,\n\n459\n00:23:47.771 --> 00:23:52.337\nbecause again, passwords are,\nthey have the human Error element,\n\n460\n00:23:52.337 --> 00:23:54.480\nhuman vulnerability element.\n\n461\n00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.650\nIf I'm using a TPM chip all of\nthat is stored in a hardware,\n\n462\n00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:00.716\nwithout hacking there's no\nway I can get to it, right?\n\n463\n00:24:00.716 --> 00:24:01.510\nMm-hm.\n\n464\n00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:03.860\n&gt;&gt; So, just do keep that in mind.\n\n465\n00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:07.310\nNow, once that's set,\nif we go back to our File Explorer, and\n\n466\n00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:09.950\nwe open this up, all right?\n\n467\n00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:12.944\nNext thing we do,\nwe'll go toThis PC, Local Disk C.\n\n468\n00:24:12.944 --> 00:24:16.921\nBecause this was an operating system\ndrive, we right click, we choose turn on,\n\n469\n00:24:16.921 --> 00:24:19.448\nand it looks a little different now,\ndoesn't it?\n\n470\n00:24:19.448 --> 00:24:20.511\n&gt;&gt; Yes it does.\n\n471\n00:24:20.511 --> 00:24:23.230\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nIt got past that, all right?\n\n472\n00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:25.060\nAnd it's also letting us know,\n\n473\n00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:27.570\nsome settings are managed by\nyour system's administrator.\n\n474\n00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:28.780\nAha that's me.\n\n475\n00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.150\nSo good, right.\n\n476\n00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:32.100\nThey say why don't you\nlike the administrator,\n\n477\n00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.570\nwell it's right there in the name Zach,\nright?.\n\n478\n00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:36.280\nSee in the name, admin-is-trator.\n\n479\n00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:37.017\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n480\n00:24:37.017 --> 00:24:38.740\n&gt;&gt; That's why nobody likes the admins.\n\n481\n00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:44.320\n[LAUGH] All right, so let's go ahead and\nwe'll do is, we'll enter a password and\n\n482\n00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:49.380\nI'm gonna enter our super secret\npassword here, and we will choose next.\n\n483\n00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:54.450\nNow the next thing that we're gonna get\nis something known as a recovery key.\n\n484\n00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:56.754\nRemember when I told you,\nif there's signs of tampering,\n\n485\n00:24:56.754 --> 00:24:59.517\nyou pull that drive out with the TPM and\nyou put it in another computer and\n\n486\n00:24:59.517 --> 00:25:01.197\nyou try to get access to that information.\n\n487\n00:25:01.197 --> 00:25:04.517\nIt says,\nI've detected signs of compromise,\n\n488\n00:25:04.517 --> 00:25:07.588\nright, or in a non-TPM mode, it places and\n\n489\n00:25:07.588 --> 00:25:12.570\nchecks them across the entire drive and\nthen it compares those values.\n\n490\n00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:14.465\nThe next time it boots up\nwhether you have a TMP or not.\n\n491\n00:25:14.465 --> 00:25:18.187\nAnd if those values don't match\nthen it says something has changed,\n\n492\n00:25:18.187 --> 00:25:21.885\nthis is some kind of offline attack and\nit throws in a recovery mode.\n\n493\n00:25:21.885 --> 00:25:24.100\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; How do you unlock the drive then?\n\n494\n00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:25.810\nWith the recovery key.\n\n495\n00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:27.952\nSo it asks you where do\nyou want to save the file?\n\n496\n00:25:27.952 --> 00:25:30.480\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nsave this to a file.\n\n497\n00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.180\nKeep in mind, let me see if I can\ngenerate an error here for you.\n\n498\n00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:37.325\nNotice it says Local Disk C\nis the encrypted drive.\n\n499\n00:25:37.325 --> 00:25:40.100\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Watch what happens when I try to save\n\n500\n00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.680\nthis on the same drive\nthat's being encrypted.\n\n501\n00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.530\nMakes sense, right?\n\n502\n00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:47.680\nYou don't lock your car with\nthe keys in the car, right?\n\n503\n00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.250\nThen you can't get to the keys,\nyou can't unlock the car.\n\n504\n00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:51.282\n&gt;&gt; Well, you can but it's not optimum.\n\n505\n00:25:51.282 --> 00:25:52.692\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, you can.\n\n506\n00:25:52.692 --> 00:25:53.776\nZach, we're not talking about\nwhat you did last weekend.\n\n507\n00:25:53.776 --> 00:25:54.289\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n508\n00:25:54.289 --> 00:25:59.920\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, that will just be between\nme, you, myself and the Internet.\n\n509\n00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:00.540\nAll right.\n\n510\n00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:01.830\nBut we do have issues here.\n\n511\n00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:03.210\nWe cannot save it on the same drive.\n\n512\n00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:07.180\nSo what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna\nmove this to a different location and\n\n513\n00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:08.640\nyou might get a couple of warnings.\n\n514\n00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:11.900\nPay attention to the warnings, all right?\n\n515\n00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:15.920\nOne of the warnings is it\ndoesn't like a root directory.\n\n516\n00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.280\nWhich means it can't be k colon backslash.\n\n517\n00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:22.530\nObviously can't be SQL cuz that's\nthe operating system drive but\n\n518\n00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:23.814\nit can't be a:\\ right?\n\n519\n00:26:23.814 --> 00:26:28.888\nIt doesn't like that,so what I have\nto do is I have to actually say\n\n520\n00:26:28.888 --> 00:26:33.965\nin GPT volume 4 that we've created\nI'm gonna create a folder and\n\n521\n00:26:33.965 --> 00:26:37.410\nI'm gonna say, call it Recovery P, rght?\n\n522\n00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:40.186\nAnd then inside of that folder\nI'm gonna choose save and\n\n523\n00:26:40.186 --> 00:26:42.130\nit didn't give me a hard time.\n\n524\n00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:44.260\nAll right, we'll choose next and\n\n525\n00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:49.000\nhere's a couple of options, do you\nwant to encrypt just the used space?\n\n526\n00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.530\nWhy wouldn't I want to encrypt all of it?\n\n527\n00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:53.560\nWell, because if you haven't\nused the entire drive,\n\n528\n00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:56.600\nyou got a lot of empty slack space there,\nright?\n\n529\n00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.180\nAnd if you don't have any files there,\n\n530\n00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:01.570\nyou don't really have to worry\nabout encrypting them yet.\n\n531\n00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:06.570\nYou only encrypt them as you build out\nto using that location, but it's faster.\n\n532\n00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:11.332\nHowever, keep in mind that if you wanna\nencrypt the entire drive it's slower but\n\n533\n00:27:11.332 --> 00:27:15.970\nagain if the drive has already been in\nuse, you don't have slack space there.\n\n534\n00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:19.589\nWhat you end up having is a potential\nthat people could gain access to\n\n535\n00:27:19.589 --> 00:27:23.211\nthe information that is sitting\noutside the BitLocker partition,\n\n536\n00:27:23.211 --> 00:27:26.343\nif you choose to only encrypt\nthat used space, all right?\n\n537\n00:27:26.343 --> 00:27:29.379\nSo we are just going to say, for\ntime purposes here because this is only\n\n538\n00:27:29.379 --> 00:27:32.523\nsupposed to be a half hour show,\nonly supposed to be a three-hour tour.\n\n539\n00:27:32.523 --> 00:27:34.793\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now it's-\n\n540\n00:27:34.793 --> 00:27:35.970\n&gt;&gt; Four-hour tour.\n\n541\n00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:37.410\n&gt;&gt; Four-hour tour, that's right.\n\n542\n00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:41.870\nSo, now the next thing, this is something\nnewer with Windows 10 as it supports\n\n543\n00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:45.820\na different operation mode for AES.\n\n544\n00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:51.059\nIt supports advance encryption\nstandard AES 255 bit encryption,\n\n545\n00:27:51.059 --> 00:27:56.043\nbut also supports a different mode\nof that encryption algorithm.\n\n546\n00:27:56.043 --> 00:27:57.733\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\n\n547\n00:27:57.733 --> 00:28:01.960\nuse the new mode because I don't\nneed backwards compatibility.\n\n548\n00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.006\nIf you need backwards compatibility,\n\n549\n00:28:04.006 --> 00:28:06.610\nyou're going to want to\nuse the other option, and\n\n550\n00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:10.831\nI'll choose next, and then the last thing\nit will do is run some checks, right?\n\n551\n00:28:10.831 --> 00:28:14.595\nIt's going to make sure that it can read\nthe recovery and encryption keys, because\n\n552\n00:28:14.595 --> 00:28:18.466\nif they don't match, once this drive's\nencrypted, if it goes into recovery mode,\n\n553\n00:28:18.466 --> 00:28:22.570\nI can't gain access to the information\nI need to format, all right?\n\n554\n00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:24.880\nThat's not good.\n\n555\n00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.660\nAnd we don't wanna do that\nbecause BitLocker is a very,\n\n556\n00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:29.930\nvery good piece of software.\n\n557\n00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:30.738\nNow we'll go ahead and choose continue.\n\n558\n00:28:30.738 --> 00:28:33.163\nAnd one of the things that\nyou're gonna notice and\n\n559\n00:28:33.163 --> 00:28:35.250\nhopefully it'll come up here in a second.\n\n560\n00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:36.240\nIt might just take a second.\n\n561\n00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.380\nThere we go.\n\n562\n00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:38.840\nMy head's kinda covering this up but\n\n563\n00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:42.950\nnotice it says, the encryption\nwill begin after you restart.\n\n564\n00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:47.420\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna restart this machine and\n\n565\n00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.620\nwe'll hear a word from our sponsors.\n\n566\n00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:52.610\nBut, just kidding, we're gonna stay\nhere and we're gonna actually wait.\n\n567\n00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:56.790\nAnd when we restart the machine,\nwe'll see where we\n\n568\n00:28:56.790 --> 00:29:01.280\nget as far a s the boot process\nwhen it comes to using BitLocker.\n\n569\n00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:05.270\nSo, those are a couple\nof things that you have\n\n570\n00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:09.730\nZach there to help secure your\noperating system, all right?\n\n571\n00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:10.795\nRemember that you have-\n&gt;&gt; It's good storage.\n\n572\n00:29:10.795 --> 00:29:14.940\n&gt;&gt; Yep, you have a file by file basis,\nyou can use EFS.\n\n573\n00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.370\nRemember that it is a file\nlevel encryption so\n\n574\n00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:20.210\nit's transparent things\nlike File Explorer.\n\n575\n00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:23.780\nFile Explorer sees the unencrypted\ninformation and so\n\n576\n00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:26.480\nagain that's a transparency to\nthe end user, that's great.\n\n577\n00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:31.890\nI am the owner of that file then I don't\nneed to provide a key to unlock it.\n\n578\n00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:34.750\nI just open up File Explorer\nsince I'm the owner I can see and\n\n579\n00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:36.860\nview the file like it's nothing.\n\n580\n00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:41.200\nBut if you need an entire disk encryption,\nnot just by a file by file basis,\n\n581\n00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.090\nI mean the whole thing encrypted,\nand you're gonna use BitLocker.\n\n582\n00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:47.790\nAnd here we go,\nBitLocker has come back, all right?\n\n583\n00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:49.510\n&gt;&gt; Right out of.\n&gt;&gt; I will tell you, though,\n\n584\n00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:52.070\nsorry about the matting\naround the edges here.\n\n585\n00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:56.780\nBecause interesting enough, even though\nBitLocker is loaded into RAM and\n\n586\n00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:00.870\nit's protecting our system, our\noperating system isn't even online yet.\n\n587\n00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:05.560\nAnd that's why it's a generic driver and\nit's giving us these matted lines there,\n\n588\n00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:07.250\nso I apologize ahead of time.\n\n589\n00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:09.590\nSo I enter my BitLocker password,\nall right?\n\n590\n00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:12.650\nWhen I enter my BitLocker password, notice\nwhat happens to the operating system.\n\n591\n00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:14.770\n&gt;&gt; You have to enter your other password.\n\n592\n00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:19.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nit actually continue booting up, right?\n\n593\n00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:22.402\nBecause with some of the things that\nhappen during the BitLocker and\n\n594\n00:30:22.402 --> 00:30:23.626\nboot up process, right?\n\n595\n00:30:23.626 --> 00:30:26.909\nDuring the boot up process, you load\nsystem drivers, well BitLocker checks\n\n596\n00:30:26.909 --> 00:30:29.880\nthe integrity of those system drivers\nbefore it allows them to load.\n\n597\n00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:30.835\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n598\n00:30:30.835 --> 00:30:33.995\n&gt;&gt; All right, and\nthen if they maintain their integrity,\n\n599\n00:30:33.995 --> 00:30:35.475\nthen it says okay login and\n\n600\n00:30:35.475 --> 00:30:38.985\nnow we'll load those system drivers and\nwe'll get your operating system booted up.\n\n601\n00:30:38.985 --> 00:30:40.680\nBut then, just like Zach said,\n\n602\n00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:43.380\nonce we load it up I still\nhave to enter my password.\n\n603\n00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:47.100\nThat just allows your operating system\nto come online, if you don't enter your\n\n604\n00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:50.750\nBitlocker password, then you don't\nget to boot the operating system.\n\n605\n00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:55.310\nAnd even more so,\nif the operating system, the drivers or\n\n606\n00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:59.470\nany of the data that's been tampered\non a BitLocker enabled drive, when it's\n\n607\n00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:03.480\noffline, the moment it comes back online,\nBitLocker is gonna be able to detect that.\n\n608\n00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.700\nIt's gonna throw it\ninto the recovery mode.\n\n609\n00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:07.890\nAll right, so now you can see.\n\n610\n00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:10.420\nWell, actually you can't really see,\nother than that login screen.\n\n611\n00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:13.649\nBut if I choose to launch File Explorer,\nall right?\n\n612\n00:31:13.649 --> 00:31:15.550\nAnd it's doing a couple of things here.\n\n613\n00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:18.530\nWe'll launch our File Explorer, probably\nlaunch it a couple of times there.\n\n614\n00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:20.150\nYep, I figured.\n\n615\n00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:25.098\nOne of the things that we'll see now\nwhen we look at This PC is that we have\n\n616\n00:31:25.098 --> 00:31:27.497\nthis little lock icon right here.\n\n617\n00:31:27.497 --> 00:31:28.003\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n618\n00:31:28.003 --> 00:31:28.894\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n619\n00:31:28.894 --> 00:31:33.128\nit is currently encrypting my data\nI should see a little key icon over\n\n620\n00:31:33.128 --> 00:31:38.060\nin the right-hand corner just below\nmy head, just behind my head here.\n\n621\n00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:40.260\nNotice it says the encryption\nis in progress.\n\n622\n00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:43.070\nAnd if I click this it lets me know that,\n\n623\n00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:47.935\nhey right now BitLocker is encrypting\nyour hard drive, all right?\n\n624\n00:31:47.935 --> 00:31:52.317\nSo, little, great little piece of\ntechnology to have when it comes to\n\n625\n00:31:52.317 --> 00:31:57.372\nsecuring your information Now everything\nthat we've done up until this point,\n\n626\n00:31:57.372 --> 00:32:00.520\nall right,\nis basically local storage, right?\n\n627\n00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:03.315\nWe have talked about how\nwe configure our drives.\n\n628\n00:32:03.315 --> 00:32:05.210\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; How we apply security to our drives.\n\n629\n00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:08.301\nBut we've got another technology\nout there today, another chapter.\n\n630\n00:32:08.301 --> 00:32:09.285\n&gt;&gt; The cloud, the cloud.\n\n631\n00:32:09.285 --> 00:32:11.725\n&gt;&gt; That's right, we've got the cloud.\n\n632\n00:32:11.725 --> 00:32:14.625\nSo the last thing that I wanna do here\nin the last few minutes that we have\n\n633\n00:32:14.625 --> 00:32:18.595\nis I wanna talk a little bit about\nthis technology called OneDrive and\n\n634\n00:32:18.595 --> 00:32:22.390\nthen just demonstrate how\nyou can put it into action.\n\n635\n00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:27.515\nOneDrive is a software as a service\nstorage solution provided by Microsoft.\n\n636\n00:32:27.515 --> 00:32:30.015\nAnd I know as of today they've\ngot different cloud services.\n\n637\n00:32:30.015 --> 00:32:32.370\nThey actually have something\ncalled storage as a service.\n\n638\n00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:34.290\nAnd that's essentially what this is.\n\n639\n00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:37.120\nYou've probably seen some other ones out\nthere like Google Drive and Dropbox.\n\n640\n00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.580\nThis is Microsoft's offering.\n\n641\n00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:39.590\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n642\n00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:42.930\n&gt;&gt; And it allows us to save\nthings like our desktop settings,\n\n643\n00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:46.790\nsome of our configurations, and our files\nout there on the cloud as well as locally.\n\n644\n00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:49.990\nAll right, but it requires something,\n\n645\n00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:53.430\nit requires you to sign in\nwith a Microsoft account.\n\n646\n00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:57.180\nAll right, now I want you to know that\nbefore the show started I already created\n\n647\n00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:00.218\na Microsoft account,\nit's a very easy thing to do.\n\n648\n00:33:00.218 --> 00:33:03.470\nGo to Microsoft's website,\nlook for Microsoft account,\n\n649\n00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:07.700\nsign up for\nyour Microsoft account, all right.\n\n650\n00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:10.610\nThen the next thing that you're\ngonna do is you're gonna come in and\n\n651\n00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:14.130\nyou're actually going to attach that\nMicrosoft account in your Windows\n\n652\n00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:16.050\noperating system to the cloud.\n\n653\n00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:17.530\nSo let's go ahead and we'll do that next.\n\n654\n00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:19.900\nVery easy to do that as well.\n\n655\n00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:23.680\nAll we have to do is we have to\njust launch our File Explorer.\n\n656\n00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:26.260\nAnd you'll notice that over\nin the navigation pane,\n\n657\n00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:28.450\nhere on the left hand side,\nnotice this OneDrive?\n\n658\n00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:29.240\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n659\n00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.780\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nif you've never attached OneDrive,\n\n660\n00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.800\nall you have to do is click this link,\nright?\n\n661\n00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:37.960\nAnd when you click this link, notice I\nget this pop under, it's not a pop up,\n\n662\n00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:38.690\nit's a pop under.\n\n663\n00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:39.520\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n664\n00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:45.200\n&gt;&gt; Right, and it's now asking me to add\nmy email address to set up OneDrive.\n\n665\n00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.490\nNow if you've already\ngot a Microsoft account,\n\n666\n00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:49.840\nall you do is enter your email address,\nright?\n\n667\n00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:52.080\nAnd I did one for this one, what was it?\n\n668\n00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:56.495\nMTA demo lab I believe\n\n669\n00:33:56.495 --> 00:34:01.180\n@outlook.com and\nthat's the other great thing.\n\n670\n00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:05.626\nIt's a free account and if you don't have\nan email setup you could actually use\n\n671\n00:34:05.626 --> 00:34:10.440\noutlook.com and at the time of\ncreating your account here, all right?\n\n672\n00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.429\nAnd notice that I'm\ngoing to choose sign in.\n\n673\n00:34:15.927 --> 00:34:17.037\nAll right?\n\n674\n00:34:17.037 --> 00:34:19.820\nAnd now it's asking me to\nenter my password, all right?\n\n675\n00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:23.935\nSo I'm going to enter a super\nsecret short password.\n\n676\n00:34:23.935 --> 00:34:28.712\n[LAUGH] We'll choose sign in.\n\n677\n00:34:28.712 --> 00:34:32.670\nAll right,\nbasically it kind of walks you through.\n\n678\n00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:38.043\nThis is your OneDrive folder and files, so\nyou can access them from other devices.\n\n679\n00:34:38.043 --> 00:34:40.085\nWait, other devices, what do you mean?\n\n680\n00:34:40.085 --> 00:34:44.295\nWell guess what, if you have\nmore than one Windows 10 device.\n\n681\n00:34:44.295 --> 00:34:46.655\nLike for instance, Zach and I,\nas we've gone through there,\n\n682\n00:34:46.655 --> 00:34:48.805\nZach's made mentions in\nsome of the other episodes,\n\n683\n00:34:48.805 --> 00:34:52.475\nand if you don't know which ones those\nare, let's go find those Easter eggs.\n\n684\n00:34:52.475 --> 00:34:55.700\nZach has mentioned how he's got multiple\nWindows 10 machines on his network.\n\n685\n00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:57.710\nAll right, so what if he wants, right?\n\n686\n00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:01.290\nHis son maybe has a laptop, Windows 10\nthat he's working on his schoolwork,\n\n687\n00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:04.000\nbut at the same time he's got his gaming\nrig at home that he sits down, and\n\n688\n00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.380\nwhen he's not working,\nhe sits in front and plays his games.\n\n689\n00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:10.970\nCouple folders that he wants to have\naccess to, and he wants them on his\n\n690\n00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:13.870\nlaptop but he saved them while he was\nat school when he was doing his work.\n\n691\n00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:18.161\nBut now he needs them on his PC at home,\nbut wouldn't it be nice that if he just\n\n692\n00:35:18.161 --> 00:35:22.655\nlogs in to OneDrive, on his laptop,\nsets whatever the folder is that he needs,\n\n693\n00:35:22.655 --> 00:35:27.745\nin OneDrive, and then when he comes home,\nhe can even leave the lap, well.\n\n694\n00:35:27.745 --> 00:35:29.490\nZach, I better make sure\nit's okay with Dad.\n\n695\n00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:31.630\nI was gonna say don't leave\nthis laptop at school.\n\n696\n00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:35.466\nBut let's say he leaves his laptop in his\nbackpack and he's sitting at his desk, and\n\n697\n00:35:35.466 --> 00:35:37.695\nhe's playing his game and\nhe needs that folder.\n\n698\n00:35:37.695 --> 00:35:41.711\nWell, launch up file explorer on his\nWindows 10 machine, the gaming PC,\n\n699\n00:35:41.711 --> 00:35:46.041\nclick OneDrive, log in, and guess what,\nnow you've synchronized that file and\n\n700\n00:35:46.041 --> 00:35:49.181\nfolder across all of your\ndevices including settings, and\n\n701\n00:35:49.181 --> 00:35:51.720\nyou can also change\nthe location if you want to.\n\n702\n00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:52.490\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n703\n00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:57.540\nleave the defaults, and here\nare the files that you can sync, right?\n\n704\n00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:01.910\nAnd you can see just by\nexpanding them out, right?\n\n705\n00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:05.720\nAnd you can sync all files and folders in\nOneDrive or only these files and folders.\n\n706\n00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:09.670\nI'm gonna say sync all files and folders\nbecause this doesn't just lend itself\n\n707\n00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:12.700\nto files and folders,\nit also does settings, too.\n\n708\n00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:14.370\nAll right, so thank you for\n\n709\n00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:17.940\nletting me use your family as\na [LAUGH] as an analogy, here.\n\n710\n00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:22.820\nSo if, let's go back to, let's say Zach's\nson makes a peak and tweak on his laptop,\n\n711\n00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:25.100\nhe's like, man,\nI love that configuration setting.\n\n712\n00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:27.510\nI love that background, all right?\n\n713\n00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:31.382\nIt's my favorite World of Warcraft\nbackground or it's a '68 Camaro and\n\n714\n00:36:31.382 --> 00:36:32.928\nI like that on my PC, as well.\n\n715\n00:36:32.928 --> 00:36:35.704\nWell guess what,\nif he synchronizes up to OneDrive,\n\n716\n00:36:35.704 --> 00:36:39.777\nthe next time he sets that background on\nhis laptop and then logs into his PC over\n\n717\n00:36:39.777 --> 00:36:42.945\nthere in the gaming rig,\nthe background is synchronized.\n\n718\n00:36:42.945 --> 00:36:45.560\nSo now he's got the background\non both machines.\n\n719\n00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:49.120\nSo settings do that too,\nnot just files and folders.\n\n720\n00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:52.290\nAnd it also lets you know what\nspace you have as well as\n\n721\n00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:55.120\nwhat you're going to accrue,\nwe're going to go ahead and choose next.\n\n722\n00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:59.320\nAnd then it should give you\na couple of walkthroughs, here.\n\n723\n00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:01.540\nIt gives you the ability to go,\nif you want to pay,\n\n724\n00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:04.830\nyou can, you can just,\nyou don't have to go premium on this.\n\n725\n00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:06.955\nAnd then a couple of drag and\ndrops, right.\n\n726\n00:37:06.955 --> 00:37:10.220\nIt'll let you know you can drag\nfolders and files to your OneDrive.\n\n727\n00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:13.890\nA folder and it's synchronizes\nall the way up to the Cloud and\n\n728\n00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:18.850\nyou can also synchronize this cross\nplatform with your mobile devices too.\n\n729\n00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:21.340\nAnd, well just like you said,\nwe're good to go and\n\n730\n00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:23.960\nwe could open our OneDrive folder,\nall right?\n\n731\n00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.840\nAnd there are our documents and pictures.\n\n732\n00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:28.650\nNow, if I save anything in here,\nall right?\n\n733\n00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:32.120\nLet's say that I deleted, what happens?\n\n734\n00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.570\nAll right, well it goes to\nthe Recycle Bin just like any other file\n\n735\n00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:35.470\nwhen you delete it.\n\n736\n00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:39.850\nBut the great thing is OneDrive has\na recycle bin that's stored in the Cloud.\n\n737\n00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:43.998\nSo if I recycle this, I put\nthe sentence into the recycle bin and\n\n738\n00:37:43.998 --> 00:37:46.145\nthen I recycle the recycle bin.\n\n739\n00:37:46.145 --> 00:37:48.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I empty the recycling bin.\n\n740\n00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:52.370\nIt might have deleted it\nfrom this local machine but\n\n741\n00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:55.090\nit didn't delete it from\nOneDrive's recycle bin.\n\n742\n00:37:55.090 --> 00:37:57.890\nWhich means you have a backup plan.\n\n743\n00:37:57.890 --> 00:37:58.690\n&gt;&gt; I didn't-\n&gt;&gt; It's retrievable.\n\n744\n00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:00.495\nThat's right, it's still retrievable.\n\n745\n00:38:00.495 --> 00:38:03.340\nAnd one of the great things is,\nwhen you recover it from OneDrive,\n\n746\n00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:06.620\nit puts it back into its original location\non your PCs the next time you log\n\n747\n00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:08.020\ninto your OneDrive account.\n\n748\n00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.650\nIt still remembers where it was.\n\n749\n00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:11.790\nGreat thing to have.\n\n750\n00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:15.210\nThis is a cloud solution,\ndefinitely take advantage of it.\n\n751\n00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:18.890\nNow, we talked a lot about storage\nin this few episodes, right?\n\n752\n00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:20.570\nThere's a lot of information.\n\n753\n00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:23.320\nHopefully this is great information,\nit's foundational and\n\n754\n00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:26.190\nit will be foundational for\nyou not only on the MTA exam but\n\n755\n00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:29.840\nas you go into supporting your\nWindows operating systems and as well,\n\n756\n00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:34.470\nif you decide to leap frog just like an\nMCSA track, all right, maybe you want to\n\n757\n00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:38.280\nbecome a Microsoft Certified Solutions\nAssociate in Windows 10, all right.\n\n758\n00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:42.540\nThese are some of the technologies that\nnot only from an exam standpoint or\n\n759\n00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:43.760\ncertification standpoint,\n\n760\n00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:46.930\nyou're going to have to know as\nyou move through your IT career.\n\n761\n00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:50.870\n&gt;&gt; And Wes thank you for taking us through\nthis step-by-step Understanding Storage\n\n762\n00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:52.720\nin Windows OS Fundamentals.\n\n763\n00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:56.250\nMake sure you see all the episodes\nbecause they're so helpful.\n\n764\n00:38:56.250 --> 00:39:00.010\nAnd when you're in that course library\nthere's thousands of other videos and\n\n765\n00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:02.640\nthey are there to help you go further.\n\n766\n00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.596\nTell everybody that you\nknow about ITPro.TV.\n\n767\n00:39:04.596 --> 00:39:06.490\nITPro.TV is

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:05.707 --> 00:00:09.080\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.011\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.940\nHello and thank you for choosing IT Pro TV\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n7\n00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.590\nI'm your host Zach Memos.\n\n8\n00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.710\nAs we continue on with\nMTA Windows OS Fundamentals\n\n9\n00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.910\nthis is understanding print\ndevices with Wes Brian.\n\n10\n00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.090\nBrian, Brian, Brian.\n\n11\n00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.100\nHey Zach, how you doing bud?\n\n12\n00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.190\nGreat to be here as always,\nthanks for having me here.\n\n13\n00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.540\nThat's right, we're gonna be looking at,\nwell, the bane of all IT existence, right?\n\n14\n00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.500\nAnd that's print devices for sure.\n\n15\n00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.950\nI have to tell you, if it isn't one thing,\nsomething like drivers,\n\n16\n00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.581\ndrivers can really be the bane\nof IT existence, right?\n\n17\n00:00:45.581 --> 00:00:48.212\nBut then you have printers, then,\n\n18\n00:00:48.212 --> 00:00:53.226\nwhen the printers do print the network\nmust be in shambles, right?\n\n19\n00:00:53.226 --> 00:00:55.540\nAnd then, you have print drivers and\nyou're kind of combining the two.\n\n20\n00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.892\nNow we have gas, and we've got fire,\nand we're going to put them together.\n\n21\n00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:03.856\nBut nope, all joking aside, we're going to\nbe looking at supporting the devices that\n\n22\n00:01:03.856 --> 00:01:06.987\nwe use to, basically,\nhave printed output, right?\n\n23\n00:01:06.987 --> 00:01:10.660\nThere are some virtualized devices\ntoo that we wanna be aware of.\n\n24\n00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.990\nAnd those virtualized devices are,\nessentially,\n\n25\n00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.340\nwhat are called virtual printers, right?\n\n26\n00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.356\nWe have a couple type that we're gonna\nlook at, things like print to file.\n\n27\n00:01:18.356 --> 00:01:20.902\nAnd maybe you've seen this before,\nand if you haven't, well,\n\n28\n00:01:20.902 --> 00:01:22.073\nthis is what we're here for.\n\n29\n00:01:22.073 --> 00:01:24.945\nSo let's go ahead and let's dive right in.\n\n30\n00:01:24.945 --> 00:01:26.385\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n31\n00:01:26.385 --> 00:01:30.515\n&gt;&gt; Now, they call out two types of\nprinters for the MTA exam, all right?\n\n32\n00:01:30.515 --> 00:01:35.005\nAnd it really comes down to where\nare the connections being made.\n\n33\n00:01:35.005 --> 00:01:38.454\nWhen you look at what's known\nas a local printer, right?\n\n34\n00:01:38.454 --> 00:01:42.210\nVersus what's known as a network printer,\nall right?\n\n35\n00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.730\nEach of these printers is connected\nto you in some fashion, all right?\n\n36\n00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.260\nNow, if it's a local printer,\nit's a direct connection, all right?\n\n37\n00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.480\nYou can look at typically USB today,\nright?\n\n38\n00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.970\nIt could be, in earlier days,\ncould be things like FireWire, right?\n\n39\n00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.570\nBut more often than not,\nit would be a USB connection,\n\n40\n00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.660\na wired connection into your computer.\n\n41\n00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.420\nEarlier and prior to that,\nwe would have things like serial ports,\n\n42\n00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.860\nand even the old parallel ports, right?\n\n43\n00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.105\nWe don't have to worry\nabout those anymore.\n\n44\n00:02:16.105 --> 00:02:18.579\nPretty much gone by the wayside for\na very, very long time.\n\n45\n00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.823\n&gt;&gt; Those are the kind where they\njust stuck them in the back, and\n\n46\n00:02:20.823 --> 00:02:22.275\nthey had two screws and that whole bit?\n\n47\n00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:24.195\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it, right?\n\n48\n00:02:24.195 --> 00:02:27.795\nWe had pins, I got the old centronics\nconnector I think is what they used to\n\n49\n00:02:27.795 --> 00:02:29.255\ncall the paralell connector, right?\n\n50\n00:02:29.255 --> 00:02:34.329\nThat was the IEEE 1284 connection,\nif I remember more specifically.\n\n51\n00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:35.183\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Awsome.\nRight?\n\n52\n00:02:35.183 --> 00:02:37.815\nAnd again, it was paralell communication.\n\n53\n00:02:37.815 --> 00:02:39.910\nAnd in the earliest\ndays what it did is it,\n\n54\n00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.130\nit really only allowed you to send\na communication to the printer, right?\n\n55\n00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.290\nYou say, well,\nisn't that what we do today?\n\n56\n00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.450\nWell, not really, right?\n\n57\n00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.516\nNow today, and for a long time, not only\ncan we sent communications outbound to\n\n58\n00:02:51.516 --> 00:02:55.353\nthe printer, but we can also receive\nthose communications back, right?\n\n59\n00:02:55.353 --> 00:02:59.638\nIt used to be just what would be known as\na unidirectional communication, right?\n\n60\n00:02:59.638 --> 00:03:02.380\nNow, it's bidirectional and it has been,\nlike I said, for a long time.\n\n61\n00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.280\nWhy is that?\n\n62\n00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.036\nBecause we don't just wanna send texts.\n\n63\n00:03:05.036 --> 00:03:06.725\nWe don't just wanna send graphics so\n\n64\n00:03:06.725 --> 00:03:09.509\nthat we can get some kind of\ngraphical output to the printer.\n\n65\n00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:14.262\nBut sometimes we wanna communicate\nwith the printer as well, right?\n\n66\n00:03:14.262 --> 00:03:16.830\nWe wanna be able to see,\nthe printer can report back to us.\n\n67\n00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.200\nFor instance, what is the media type that\nis currently set on the printer, right?\n\n68\n00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.040\nRather than having to walk over and\n\n69\n00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.300\nuse the OSD or on-screen display\nto make configurations, right?\n\n70\n00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.430\nSo the printer needs to be able\nto communicate back with us, and\n\n71\n00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.610\nwe're gonna look at some of the print\nproperties coming up, all right?\n\n72\n00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.030\nSo a local printer is one that's\ndirectly connected to your computer.\n\n73\n00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.050\nNow, I will tell you\nthat it's not just USB.\n\n74\n00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.384\nYou got to be careful with that one.\n\n75\n00:03:42.384 --> 00:03:44.062\nHere's why I say that.\n\n76\n00:03:44.062 --> 00:03:47.232\nBecause you could have a Wi-Fi printer,\nand you could install a printer that\n\n77\n00:03:47.232 --> 00:03:50.307\nessentially is connected to your\nWi-Fi network, and it's connected and\n\n78\n00:03:50.307 --> 00:03:52.500\ncontrolled through a single computer.\n\n79\n00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.510\nThen you also have network computers,\nand you could call a Wi-Fi\n\n80\n00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.760\ncomputer if it's shared amongst many\ndevices, a network printer too.\n\n81\n00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.940\nBut you also have devices, printers,\n\n82\n00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.920\nthat basically they take a wired\nEthernet connection, all right?\n\n83\n00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.430\nSo we have many different\ntypes of printers, right?\n\n84\n00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.158\nAgain, a local printer\nwhen it comes down to it,\n\n85\n00:04:10.158 --> 00:04:13.627\nit's really where the print\njobs being managed, all right?\n\n86\n00:04:13.627 --> 00:04:17.210\nDetermines whether it's a local printer\nversus a network printer, right?\n\n87\n00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:18.740\nAnd let me show you what I mean here.\n\n88\n00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.690\nIn fact, let me go ahead and\nI'll dive into our Windows 10 machine,\n\n89\n00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:22.200\nget logged in here.\n\n90\n00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.530\nLooks like I had some task manager\nup doing some maintenance, but\n\n91\n00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.979\nlet's dive down into our printers.\n\n92\n00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.600\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna right-click\n\n93\n00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.570\non our Windows charm or Windows icon here.\n\n94\n00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.340\nGonna choose settings, all right?\n\n95\n00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.374\nAnd then from there, let me go ahead and\nexpand this out in Cortana,\n\n96\n00:04:44.374 --> 00:04:45.342\nwe're okay for now.\n\n97\n00:04:45.342 --> 00:04:47.810\n[LAUGH] We'll go to devices, all right?\n\n98\n00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.810\nAnd then, we will see Printers &amp; scanners,\nall right?\n\n99\n00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.443\nSo this is the newer Core interface and\n\n100\n00:04:52.443 --> 00:04:54.649\nyou can see that we've got\nsome printers already.\n\n101\n00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:59.749\nI've got some printers that my\nmachine is already aware of too.\n\n102\n00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:05.040\nAnd those printers are, for\ninstance this HP DeskJet, right?\n\n103\n00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.880\nWe also have, well one that's right here\nin our studio, not in the studio but\n\n104\n00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.650\nwithin our location that is\na network based printer, right?\n\n105\n00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.619\nThat's a printer that shared with\neverybody out here on the network,\n\n106\n00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:18.300\nall right?\n\n107\n00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.020\nWell, remember one of the things that\nI told you is where it's a network\n\n108\n00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.578\nprinter or\n\n109\n00:05:22.578 --> 00:05:27.230\na local printer is really based on where\nthe printer queue, this print queue here.\n\n110\n00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.460\nWhere are the print keys being managed,\nright?\n\n111\n00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.420\nIf they're being managed\nby your local machine,\n\n112\n00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.000\nin this case this Windows machine,\nit's a local printer.\n\n113\n00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:43.069\nHowever, if you send that print job across\nthe network and another device manages it.\n\n114\n00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:44.788\nIt's no longer a locally\nconnected printer,\n\n115\n00:05:44.788 --> 00:05:46.910\nnow we're talking about a network printer,\nall right?\n\n116\n00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.712\nSo what do we mean when we say,\nmanaging the print jobs, right?\n\n117\n00:05:49.712 --> 00:05:51.590\nWell, let me show you here as well.\n\n118\n00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.777\nLet's drop down to our search field,\nand I'm gonna type Services.\n\n119\n00:05:55.777 --> 00:05:59.920\nAnd Services more specifically,\nservices.msc.\n\n120\n00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.620\nFor a Microsoft Management Console,\nand we're gonna bring up our Services.\n\n121\n00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.190\nKeep in mind,\n\n122\n00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.624\nyou could find this in Computer Management\nlike we've mentioned in other episodes.\n\n123\n00:06:07.624 --> 00:06:11.290\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and just look at\nthe basic Services console, all right?\n\n124\n00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.560\nRemember what a Service is for\nus, all right?\n\n125\n00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.990\nA Service is that background\nprocess that's running.\n\n126\n00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.680\nUnlike an application where you and\nI, Zach, we would launch it, right?\n\n127\n00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.830\nThis is an application,\nlike File Explorer,\n\n128\n00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.600\nI'm gonna launch it myself, right?\n\n129\n00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.758\nBackground processes they\nlaunch unnoticed to you, or\n\n130\n00:06:29.758 --> 00:06:34.100\nmaybe you do know,\nwithout you interaction, all right?\n\n131\n00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.817\nAnd one of those services that I\nreally care about is what's known\n\n132\n00:06:37.817 --> 00:06:39.110\nas the Print Spooler.\n\n133\n00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.330\nNotice we have this\nPrint Spooler right here.\n\n134\n00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.150\nNotice what it tells us this service does.\n\n135\n00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:47.980\nThis service spools the print job and\nhandles the inner action with the printer,\n\n136\n00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.330\nthat's important, right?\n\n137\n00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.620\nThat's a very important distinction\nbetween a local printer, and\n\n138\n00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.830\na network printer, all right?\n\n139\n00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.370\nIf this computer's Print Spooler, and\n\n140\n00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.810\nlet's also get some terminology right to,\nright?\n\n141\n00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.680\nBecause what you'll see is that Microsoft\ncalls the physical device where we\n\n142\n00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.010\nsee the output come out,\nthey call that the print device.\n\n143\n00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.013\nA print device which is\nkind of interesting, right?\n\n144\n00:07:12.013 --> 00:07:14.745\nWell, you say, what's the printer.\n\n145\n00:07:14.745 --> 00:07:16.929\nThe service you're looking at right here,\nall right?\n\n146\n00:07:16.929 --> 00:07:21.856\nTechnically, Microsoft calls the printer\nthe actual spooler service that spools\n\n147\n00:07:21.856 --> 00:07:22.780\nthe print job.\n\n148\n00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.890\nWhat are we talking about spooling\nthe print job, all right?\n\n149\n00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:29.124\nWell, in order to send\na print job to the printer,\n\n150\n00:07:29.124 --> 00:07:34.438\none thing that your computer will do is\nit'll actually write it to the hard drive.\n\n151\n00:07:34.438 --> 00:07:38.287\nAnd it writes it to the hard drive, spools\nit to the disk, writes it to the hard\n\n152\n00:07:38.287 --> 00:07:41.738\ndrive, and then, sends it to\nthe appropriate printer, all right?\n\n153\n00:07:41.738 --> 00:07:46.376\nAnd that's for the purposes of making\nsure that the print job is successful.\n\n154\n00:07:46.376 --> 00:07:49.649\nKinda like in other episodes when we\ntalked about journal file system,\n\n155\n00:07:49.649 --> 00:07:51.676\nwe talk about a staging area-\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n156\n00:07:51.676 --> 00:07:53.321\n&gt;&gt; We made sure that the rights happened,\nand\n\n157\n00:07:53.321 --> 00:07:55.936\nthat they've maintained their\nintegrity and then we commit them.\n\n158\n00:07:55.936 --> 00:07:59.023\nIf you will, to the actual hard drive.\n\n159\n00:07:59.023 --> 00:08:02.384\nWell, same thing kinda goes\nwith your print spooler, right?\n\n160\n00:08:02.384 --> 00:08:05.354\nYour print spooler spools the job or\nwrites it to the hard drive so\n\n161\n00:08:05.354 --> 00:08:08.832\nthat if you have a power failure,\nyou just regain the print spool, right?\n\n162\n00:08:08.832 --> 00:08:11.543\nYou can regain that print job, all right?\n\n163\n00:08:11.543 --> 00:08:14.282\nNow once it spools it to the hard drive,\n\n164\n00:08:14.282 --> 00:08:19.260\nit talks about handling\nthe interaction with the printer.\n\n165\n00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.210\nPart of this print spooler is what's\nknown as the print router, all right?\n\n166\n00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:25.930\nAnd the print router looks,\nas part of this service, looks down and\n\n167\n00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:29.910\nsays, all right, do I have to send\nthis to a locally-attached printer or\n\n168\n00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:33.430\ndo I need to send this to\nanother print spooler?\n\n169\n00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:34.280\nAnd in this case,\n\n170\n00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.170\nthat other print spooler would be\nsomething known as a print server.\n\n171\n00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:41.330\nNow don't think that a print server,\nif you will, is just some big,\n\n172\n00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.100\nhuge, massive device\nin your server closet.\n\n173\n00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:44.939\nDoesn't have to be that at all.\n\n174\n00:08:44.939 --> 00:08:48.305\nIn fact, we had one print server that was\nout there in a company that I worked for\n\n175\n00:08:48.305 --> 00:08:50.000\nthat were managing testing stations.\n\n176\n00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.340\nAnd it was no bigger than a Roku, right?\n\n177\n00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:57.340\nBecause all a print server really is\ndoing is directing the print jobs\n\n178\n00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:00.360\nto the right network-based printer,\nwherever they need to go, all right?\n\n179\n00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.120\nNow I could tell you that you could send\nit over the network to a print server.\n\n180\n00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.745\nAnd the print server, for whatever reason,\nmight even have a printer hooked up to it.\n\n181\n00:09:06.745 --> 00:09:08.710\nBut a lot of times,\nthat doesn't happen, all right?\n\n182\n00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:13.800\nSo the print server, essentially, is going\nto now manage the print jobs for you.\n\n183\n00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.476\nAnd that functionality doesn't need\nto be a dedicated device, too.\n\n184\n00:09:17.476 --> 00:09:19.530\nLet me make sure that I take care of that,\nas well.\n\n185\n00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:22.781\nBecause, when you have a network-based\nprinter, they have extra RAM and CPU.\n\n186\n00:09:22.781 --> 00:09:27.820\nAnd they also have the print server\nfunctionality built into them, all right?\n\n187\n00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:32.640\nAnd my local print spooler determines\nthat this needs to go, if it needs to go,\n\n188\n00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:37.260\nI should say,\nto one of the printers in this list.\n\n189\n00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:42.380\nThen what it does is it directs it to\nthe print server on those printers.\n\n190\n00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:45.640\nAnd they take care of the print\njob from there, all right?\n\n191\n00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.100\nSo that's one of the big differences\nbetween a local printer and\n\n192\n00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:48.720\na network printer.\n\n193\n00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.910\nWhere is the print job being managed?\n\n194\n00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:53.810\nIf the print job's being managed\nby that local service here on\n\n195\n00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:56.660\nyour Windows machine,\nthen it's a local printer.\n\n196\n00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:00.210\nIf the print router, as part of the print\nspooler service on your local machine,\n\n197\n00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:03.240\ndetermines that it's not bound for\na local machine and\n\n198\n00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:07.600\npoints to a print server, it's gonna send\nit over to the network to another device.\n\n199\n00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.370\nAnd that print server could be\nbuilt into the network printer,\n\n200\n00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:12.380\nitself, led the hall in one functionality,\nright?\n\n201\n00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.444\nSo you don't have to get a third-party\ndevice just to be able to use your printer\n\n202\n00:10:15.444 --> 00:10:16.557\non the network, all right?\n\n203\n00:10:16.557 --> 00:10:18.330\nSo that is important to understand.\n\n204\n00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:23.060\nNow if I want to attach a printer,\nhow do we do that?\n\n205\n00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.300\nAll right, well, there's a couple of\nways that you can do this, right?\n\n206\n00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.180\nSometimes your printers, and in fact,\na lot of times, printers will have\n\n207\n00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:32.230\na little bit of their firmware,\ntheir software, their drivers and\n\n208\n00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:37.660\nstuff, stored in a little flash\nmemory on the printer, itself.\n\n209\n00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:42.400\nSo sometimes, when you connect via USB,\nUSB's plug and play.\n\n210\n00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.963\nAnd if USB's plug and\nplay, a lot of times,\n\n211\n00:10:43.963 --> 00:10:46.346\nwhat'll happen is Windows'll look\ndown into that driver store.\n\n212\n00:10:46.346 --> 00:10:51.250\nAnd it'll find a generic print driver,\nso it gives you the basic functionality,\n\n213\n00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.060\nall right?\n\n214\n00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.950\nIf it gives you the basic functionality,\na lot of times,\n\n215\n00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:55.170\nyou can start your print right away.\n\n216\n00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:58.473\nBut if you want the full functionality,\na lot of times,\n\n217\n00:10:58.473 --> 00:11:03.392\nyour printers that are attached locally\nare gonna come with some kind of,\n\n218\n00:11:03.392 --> 00:11:05.630\nOptical disk, if you will,\nmaybe even a thumb drive.\n\n219\n00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.480\nI've seen some of them that\nattach a thumb drive to it\n\n220\n00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.220\nas part of purchasing the printer.\n\n221\n00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.240\nAnd you can plug it into a USB port,\nand software is right there.\n\n222\n00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.321\nAnd then you can install\nthe manufacturer driver.\n\n223\n00:11:14.321 --> 00:11:16.400\nAnd you get the full\nfunctionality of the device.\n\n224\n00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.886\nIf that doesn't happen, you can always\ngo to the manufacturer's website,\n\n225\n00:11:19.886 --> 00:11:21.503\ndownload the driver ahead of time.\n\n226\n00:11:21.503 --> 00:11:25.880\nAnd then when you plug it in, it depends\non, it could be vendor-specific.\n\n227\n00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.690\nSo sometimes they run the software, and\nthe software takes you through some steps,\n\n228\n00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.160\nand then tells you to plug it in.\n\n229\n00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.230\nIt might be one of these things where\nyou plug it in, you just plug and\n\n230\n00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:34.630\nplay, and you go.\n\n231\n00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:37.085\nHowever, if you're gonna\ninstall a network printer,\n\n232\n00:11:37.085 --> 00:11:38.971\nnow a couple different things can happen.\n\n233\n00:11:38.971 --> 00:11:40.673\nAnd again, more so today,\n\n234\n00:11:40.673 --> 00:11:45.050\nyou'll even find that the network\nprinters also have the same thing.\n\n235\n00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:46.410\nA printer's a printer, right?\n\n236\n00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:49.640\nThey'll have a little portion\nof flash memory that'll\n\n237\n00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.070\nhave the software installed on that.\n\n238\n00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:53.400\nSo that when I connect\nover to the network, and\n\n239\n00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:57.840\nI go to install this printer locally, if\nyou will, the print driver, I should say.\n\n240\n00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.720\nI’m just pulling it right off the printer\nover the network, and that’s really handy.\n\n241\n00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.690\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n242\n00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:05.938\nIn fact, if we go ahead, and\nwe add a printer, what it’s gonna do is,\n\n243\n00:12:05.938 --> 00:12:09.334\nif you have printers that\nare configured to listen out.\n\n244\n00:12:09.334 --> 00:12:12.460\nAnd when I’m saying, hey, is there\na printer out there on the network?\n\n245\n00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:15.824\nYeah, the printers that are configured to\nrespond will come back and say, hey, yeah,\n\n246\n00:12:15.824 --> 00:12:16.469\nI'm a printer.\n\n247\n00:12:16.469 --> 00:12:17.963\nYou can find me over here.\n\n248\n00:12:17.963 --> 00:12:20.930\nAnd we can see that there\nare a few right here.\n\n249\n00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:23.834\nIn fact, we got one in our CEO's office.\n\n250\n00:12:23.834 --> 00:12:28.660\nWe'll probably connect to this one and\nprobably [LAUGH] send them a test page.\n\n251\n00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.017\nAnd he's gonna wonder where\nthe heck that came from.\n\n252\n00:12:30.017 --> 00:12:32.040\n&gt;&gt; I think he might know\nwhere it came from.\n\n253\n00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.504\n&gt;&gt; It's okay, we'll blame it on Zach.\n\n254\n00:12:33.504 --> 00:12:34.557\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My credit card, right?\n\n255\n00:12:34.557 --> 00:12:36.580\n&gt;&gt; There we go, that's right.\n\n256\n00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.939\nSo now that I've found the printer, right?\n\n257\n00:12:38.939 --> 00:12:42.594\nYou'll see that it asks me,\ndo I wanna add the device, right?\n\n258\n00:12:42.594 --> 00:12:43.192\nAnd again, I'm gonna add the device.\n\n259\n00:12:43.192 --> 00:12:48.516\nAnd when we do, notice,\nit's gonna go really quickly here, right?\n\n260\n00:12:48.516 --> 00:12:51.088\nIt is connecting over the network,\nall right?\n\n261\n00:12:51.088 --> 00:12:53.372\nAnd it's communicating with that printer.\n\n262\n00:12:53.372 --> 00:12:56.316\nAnd now my operating system and\nthat printer are talking.\n\n263\n00:12:56.316 --> 00:12:58.859\nAnd that printer's saying, hey,\nhere's your driver package.\n\n264\n00:12:58.859 --> 00:13:03.641\nThis'll get me set up, if you will, right?\n\n265\n00:13:03.641 --> 00:13:06.520\nAnd then they also have some apps that'll\nallow you to manage these printers.\n\n266\n00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.760\nBut one of the great things is\nyou can manage all printers.\n\n267\n00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.670\nI don't care if it's a local printer.\n\n268\n00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:15.220\nI don't care if it is a remote or\nnetwork-based printer.\n\n269\n00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:18.840\nYou can manage all your\nprinters inside of Windows.\n\n270\n00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.722\nWindows has the print\nserver functionality.\n\n271\n00:13:20.722 --> 00:13:23.317\nAnd what I mean by that is be\ncareful because I'm not just talking\n\n272\n00:13:23.317 --> 00:13:24.628\nabout local printers, right?\n\n273\n00:13:24.628 --> 00:13:28.389\nThe print spooler is going to\nmanage your local printers, but\n\n274\n00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:31.220\nWindows can actually act\nlike a print server.\n\n275\n00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.820\nWhich means that other print spoolers,\n\n276\n00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:37.130\nthat print router can send that\nprint job to my local machine here.\n\n277\n00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:40.890\nAnd I can manage it, I can manage\nit all through a single interface.\n\n278\n00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:41.900\nLet me show you here.\n\n279\n00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.350\nIf we dive down into our Windows\noperating system, right?\n\n280\n00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:47.150\nAnd how do I wanna get there?\n\n281\n00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:50.336\nI'll tell you what, let's go ahead, and\n\n282\n00:13:50.336 --> 00:13:53.796\nI'm gonna go to the older\nControl Panel here.\n\n283\n00:13:53.796 --> 00:13:55.640\nDevices and Printers, there we go.\n\n284\n00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:59.236\nWe're gonna go to the old, so\nhere's the older Control Panel.\n\n285\n00:13:59.236 --> 00:14:04.810\nAgain, keep in mind, this is gonna be\nthe same in Windows 7 and Windows 8, 8.1.\n\n286\n00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:06.600\nLike we've kinda talked,\nwe've kinda gone back and\n\n287\n00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.878\nforth between using this interface.\n\n288\n00:14:07.878 --> 00:14:10.561\nAnd one of the great things is we're\ntrying to show you the Windows 10\n\n289\n00:14:10.561 --> 00:14:11.070\ninterface.\n\n290\n00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:14.380\nCuz it could be on the MTA exam,\nand it most likely will be, but\n\n291\n00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:16.420\nsome of the older ones might be,\ntoo, all right?\n\n292\n00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.480\nSo if I get into here, essentially,\n\n293\n00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.040\nwhat I can do is I can go\nback to the Control Panel.\n\n294\n00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.770\nI can go into System and Security.\n\n295\n00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:27.930\nAnd if we scroll down we get\nto our Administrative Tools,\n\n296\n00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:29.460\nwe open our Administrative Tools.\n\n297\n00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:32.440\nNotice that right here\nbelow Performance Monitor,\n\n298\n00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:36.038\njust above Recovery Drive,\nis Print Management, all right?\n\n299\n00:14:36.038 --> 00:14:39.320\nI launched that a little bit too fast,\nand here's why.\n\n300\n00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.400\nI love the fact that you could do a lot of\nhover to discover here in Windows, right?\n\n301\n00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.300\nIf I hover over that,\nmanage local printers and\n\n302\n00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:50.720\nremote print servers, all through a single\ninterface right here on your machine.\n\n303\n00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.370\nIt's a great utility to have.\n\n304\n00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:57.730\nSo let me go ahead and\nlet me relaunch that there.\n\n305\n00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:01.230\nAgain, I get so used to it and so excited\nabout this I just click right on there.\n\n306\n00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:02.900\nAnd you can't even see what's going on.\n\n307\n00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:06.979\nSo let's try not to do that, or\nthis'll be a very short episode.\n\n308\n00:15:06.979 --> 00:15:09.650\nAll right, so Print Management, right?\n\n309\n00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:10.940\nYou have your print servers here.\n\n310\n00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.950\nNotice, we have the Win10Client (local).\n\n311\n00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:14.502\nNow I could, if I want to,\n\n312\n00:15:14.502 --> 00:15:18.754\nI could add another print server if\nwe had it out on the network, right?\n\n313\n00:15:18.754 --> 00:15:21.570\nAnd we could browse the network,\nif we wanted, here.\n\n314\n00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:23.862\nAnd we could use things\nlike Network Discovery now.\n\n315\n00:15:23.862 --> 00:15:25.780\nAnd in fact, let me kinda show you here.\n\n316\n00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:27.700\nAnd you can see that there\nare some other computers here.\n\n317\n00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.220\nIf I happen to have a print server,\nI could put it in the list here.\n\n318\n00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:34.241\nAnd it would allow me, provided\nthe other side's configured right,\n\n319\n00:15:34.241 --> 00:15:37.798\nto manage its print jobs all\nthrough this interface, right?\n\n320\n00:15:37.798 --> 00:15:40.770\nWe're gonna go ahead, and\nwe'll just close that down.\n\n321\n00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:45.727\nNow the other thing is we do have drivers\nthat we need to manage and maintain,\n\n322\n00:15:45.727 --> 00:15:46.505\nall right?\n\n323\n00:15:46.505 --> 00:15:49.444\nWouldn't it be nice to manage and\nmaintain your drivers for\n\n324\n00:15:49.444 --> 00:15:52.699\nall your printers in a centralized\nmanagement fashion, right?\n\n325\n00:15:52.699 --> 00:15:54.289\nWe talk about network types, right?\n\n326\n00:15:54.289 --> 00:15:58.875\nAnd if you're not aware of\nthe network Models right?\n\n327\n00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:00.233\nYou have what's known as a work group,\nright?\n\n328\n00:16:00.233 --> 00:16:04.195\nIn Windows, a work group is\na decentralized environment which means\n\n329\n00:16:04.195 --> 00:16:08.431\nevery single computer manages its\nown resources, its own permissions,\n\n330\n00:16:08.431 --> 00:16:09.810\nits own user accounts.\n\n331\n00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:13.340\nAnd each computer within it doesn't\ntrust another computer, all right?\n\n332\n00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.700\nIt's decentralized.\n\n333\n00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:19.690\nVersus the other and\nmost popular networking model,\n\n334\n00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:21.880\nwe just call it client-server model,\nright.\n\n335\n00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:26.633\nAnd what you have is, you have clients\nlike my operating system here that call\n\n336\n00:16:26.633 --> 00:16:29.230\nout the network and\nthey request resources.\n\n337\n00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:33.050\nThen we have other computers out\nthere that are providing a resource\n\n338\n00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:36.440\nin response to the request,\nthat's what's known as a server.\n\n339\n00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.240\nSo know that when we say a print server,\n\n340\n00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.970\nit means that a print server is\nlistening out and somebody or\n\n341\n00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:44.807\na computer I guess I should say, says hey,\nI got a print job to send you, all right?\n\n342\n00:16:44.807 --> 00:16:48.241\nThat's re-service, I need a service,\nI need a print server, and\n\n343\n00:16:48.241 --> 00:16:50.126\nthe print server responds, right?\n\n344\n00:16:50.126 --> 00:16:53.820\nWell, with the client-server model,\nwe get centralized management, right?\n\n345\n00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:57.750\nUnlike the decentralized approach and\nthat's what great about this interface\n\n346\n00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:01.810\nhere, the print management, is that we\ncan do centralized print management.\n\n347\n00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:05.580\nAnd what I mean by that is if we\ntake a look at our interface here,\n\n348\n00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:08.140\nnotice I have all of these\ndifferent drivers, right?\n\n349\n00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.530\nIf I didn't have this ability, right?\n\n350\n00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:18.380\nThen what I would have to do is go\nto each printer individually and\n\n351\n00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.110\nmanage their drivers separately.\n\n352\n00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:23.650\nAnd in a small environment, that might not\nbe bad, but if it's a big environment,\n\n353\n00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:27.580\na large environment, you wanna use\nthe print server functionality to manage\n\n354\n00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:29.180\nnot only your local printers, but\n\n355\n00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:31.660\nalso the printers that you're\nconnecting to over the network.\n\n356\n00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.250\nAnd wouldn't it be nice to manage\n\n357\n00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:35.533\nthat bane that I was telling you about-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n358\n00:17:35.533 --> 00:17:36.510\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n359\n00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:41.960\nDrivers and we can see right here, we can\nlook at the properties of the driver.\n\n360\n00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.640\nWe can see what type it is,\n\n361\n00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:47.270\nwhere it's located, the files that\nare associated with it, right?\n\n362\n00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:50.338\nSome dependencies, you can see\nsome language files in there too.\n\n363\n00:17:50.338 --> 00:17:51.565\nThese are actually the CHM files or\n\n364\n00:17:51.565 --> 00:17:54.460\nhelp files all built right\ninto the driver itself.\n\n365\n00:17:54.460 --> 00:18:00.050\nSo it's nice to be able to have this\nadvanced information if you need to and\n\n366\n00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:02.460\nmanage your driver from a single location.\n\n367\n00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:03.620\nThen we also have ports.\n\n368\n00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:06.750\nRemember, I told you some of those\nold ports that we were talking about.\n\n369\n00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:08.580\nWe talked, Zach, about the serial ports.\n\n370\n00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:09.960\nWe also talked about printer ports.\n\n371\n00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.010\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Well, in the operating system,\n\n372\n00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:14.870\nthe serial ports were seen as these\nCOM ports, right here, right?\n\n373\n00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:17.737\nAn there were only four of them that\nyou would have, COM 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n374\n00:18:17.737 --> 00:18:22.380\nThey're called communication ports,\nthose would be your serial ports.\n\n375\n00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.990\nFILE port is when you're doing\na print-to-file, all right?\n\n376\n00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:27.070\nAnd I'll show you\na print-to-file coming up.\n\n377\n00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:28.540\nAnd then you have IR, right?\n\n378\n00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.100\nWe have infrared devices.\n\n379\n00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.720\nAnd there's a potential for\nthere to be an infrared-based printer and\n\n380\n00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.171\nthat functionality is built in right.\n\n381\n00:18:34.171 --> 00:18:36.961\nAgain, remember,\nsometimes you'll be connecting devices and\n\n382\n00:18:36.961 --> 00:18:39.360\nit might be through\nan infrared communication.\n\n383\n00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.873\nThe current infrared standard\nthat we use managed by the IrDA,\n\n384\n00:18:42.873 --> 00:18:46.984\nthe Infrared Data Association, and\nthen the standard, specifically,\n\n385\n00:18:46.984 --> 00:18:51.777\nis called VFR, that's what I like to call\nit, it's very fast infrared, all right?\n\n386\n00:18:51.777 --> 00:18:54.735\nSo we might need to use that,\nbut then here are the LPT ports,\n\n387\n00:18:54.735 --> 00:18:57.710\nthose are those parallel\nports we were talking about.\n\n388\n00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:00.810\nAnd this goes all the way back to\nthe earlier days of computing,\n\n389\n00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:03.220\nthat is a line printer terminal,\nall right?\n\n390\n00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:07.570\nWhen you would be using a terminal\ninterface to connect to a host computer\n\n391\n00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:12.000\nthat would be running an LPD,\na line printer daemon, the service, right?\n\n392\n00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.590\nEssentially the server.\n\n393\n00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:16.460\nAnd then there're some other\nprinters that you can see here too.\n\n394\n00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:21.320\nHere's one, this is actually a thin print\nVMware driver for virtual machines and\n\n395\n00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:24.980\nstuff like that, so\nwe have do that as well.\n\n396\n00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:28.280\nThen we can look at the printers\nthat this client is managing, and\n\n397\n00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.170\nyou can see a couple of them, right?\n\n398\n00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:34.026\nRemember when I said print-to-file, here\nare two print-to-file printers, right?\n\n399\n00:19:34.026 --> 00:19:37.657\nWe have a Microsoft Print to PDF,\nand what that says,\n\n400\n00:19:37.657 --> 00:19:41.700\nit just takes that file\nessentially convert it to a PDF.\n\n401\n00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:42.870\nThat's really what it does.\n\n402\n00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:47.293\nIt allows you to do it on the fly without\nhaving some kind of productivity suite to\n\n403\n00:19:47.293 --> 00:19:48.290\ndo that, right?\n\n404\n00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:50.580\nMost of your productivity\nsuites can do that, right?\n\n405\n00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:54.250\nOffice can do that, LibreOffice if\nyou're talking about open source.\n\n406\n00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:56.500\nA lot of these devices can\nalready do that, right?\n\n407\n00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.120\nSo this isn't anything\nspecific to Microsoft, but\n\n408\n00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.360\nyou have to understand\nwhat print-to-file means.\n\n409\n00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.665\nSometimes you need to print\nto the Internet, right?\n\n410\n00:20:03.665 --> 00:20:08.024\nAnd you can use a web browser to do\nprinting if your using something known\n\n411\n00:20:08.024 --> 00:20:08.540\nas IPP.\n\n412\n00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.380\nThat's the Internet Printing Protocol.\n\n413\n00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:15.061\nIt allows you to basically send your\nprint jobs over the Internet or\n\n414\n00:20:15.061 --> 00:20:19.560\nbasically over the TCP/IP-based network,\nall right?\n\n415\n00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.630\nSo we can manage the printers from here.\n\n416\n00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:24.207\nNow, the other thing we can also do\nis we can manage the print queue.\n\n417\n00:20:24.207 --> 00:20:26.840\nSo I kind of mentioned the print queues,\nall right?\n\n418\n00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:32.612\nNow I don't have anything in\nthe print queue, I don't believe.\n\n419\n00:20:32.612 --> 00:20:37.530\nLet's open the print queue, all right.\n\n420\n00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:40.010\nWhen you send a print job to the printer,\nall right,\n\n421\n00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:42.760\nit gets staged in what's known\nas a print queue, all right?\n\n422\n00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.492\nAnd it's on a first come,\nfirst serve basis, right?\n\n423\n00:20:44.492 --> 00:20:47.490\nWell, we can manage that\nprint queue right here.\n\n424\n00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:51.980\nAnd if there were print jobs in\nthe print queue, we could pause them,\n\n425\n00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.830\nwe could cancel them,\nwe could rearrange the order.\n\n426\n00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:59.184\nAnd that's another good thing about using\nthe print management software here is\n\n427\n00:20:59.184 --> 00:21:03.281\nbecause you can manage the print queues\nfrom every one of your printers all in\n\n428\n00:21:03.281 --> 00:21:04.707\na centralized location.\n\n429\n00:21:04.707 --> 00:21:08.382\nSo great thing to have access to.\n\n430\n00:21:08.382 --> 00:21:12.060\nAll right, so\nthat is a little bit about our printers.\n\n431\n00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:14.730\nI will tell you,\nI'm gonna go back down to services.\n\n432\n00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:15.765\nI also want you guys and\n\n433\n00:21:15.765 --> 00:21:18.890\ngirls out there to know that the services\nis also an administrative tool.\n\n434\n00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:21.340\nSo, I've been working with Windows a lot.\n\n435\n00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:27.860\nI like to use some of the msc\n[LAUGH] old run line options.\n\n436\n00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:32.050\nWe'll also show you that you can get\nit to it via the services console too.\n\n437\n00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:37.120\nSo now that being said that the principle,\nremember one of the things that I said was\n\n438\n00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.160\nthe print spooler is essentially\nthe printer, all right?\n\n439\n00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.400\nNotice that it says this service\nspools the print jobs and\n\n440\n00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.660\nhandles the interaction.\n\n441\n00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:51.110\nIf you turn this service off, you will\nnot be able to print or see printers.\n\n442\n00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:53.260\nImportant, all right?\n\n443\n00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:54.940\nIf I do turn this off,\n\n444\n00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:58.130\nI'm essentially turning off\na functionality of the printer.\n\n445\n00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:01.401\nRemember, again, what Microsoft says,\nthis is the printer to them,\n\n446\n00:22:01.401 --> 00:22:02.881\nthe software that is managing.\n\n447\n00:22:02.881 --> 00:22:05.528\n&gt;&gt; So the question would be,\nwhy would anybody wanna turn it off?\n\n448\n00:22:05.528 --> 00:22:09.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Zach, that is a great question\nand let me tell you why that is so\n\n449\n00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:11.070\nimportant, all right?\n\n450\n00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:15.070\nSometimes you need to reboot the printer,\nall right?\n\n451\n00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:16.740\nIf you look at some documentation,\n\n452\n00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:19.690\nsometimes you'll hear\npower cycling the device.\n\n453\n00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.760\nWell, the print device\nis the actually printer.\n\n454\n00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:26.200\nThat means walking over to the printer and\nrestarting it.\n\n455\n00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:30.920\nBut sometimes print jobs which\nthe print spooler is managing and\n\n456\n00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:37.510\nthe communication and interaction with the\nprint device kinda goes haywire all right?\n\n457\n00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:39.890\nSo sometimes you have\nto reboot the printer.\n\n458\n00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:40.980\nNow, be very careful.\n\n459\n00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.590\nI'm just using Microsoft\nterminology cuz Zach and\n\n460\n00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:45.560\nI were talking about this\nbefore we even started.\n\n461\n00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.540\nIn fact I was talking to our\ndirector who you can't see.\n\n462\n00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:52.480\nShe's behind the camera there about\nthe print device to us is typically\n\n463\n00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.850\nwhat we would call the printer,\nthe actual physical device.\n\n464\n00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:57.440\nBut when you hear it from Microsoft\nthey're gonna say you need to\n\n465\n00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.990\nrestart the printer.\n\n466\n00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:00.391\nYou need to restart\nthe Print Spooler service.\n\n467\n00:23:00.391 --> 00:23:01.030\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n468\n00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:05.991\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes when you can't find\na printer, you can't communicate with\n\n469\n00:23:05.991 --> 00:23:10.949\na printer, you can see that print jobs\nare going to the print queue, but\n\n470\n00:23:10.949 --> 00:23:14.270\nthere's no output on\nthe print device itself.\n\n471\n00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:16.300\nYou need to restart\nthe Print Spooler service.\n\n472\n00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:18.119\nLet me show you how to do that, ll right?\n\n473\n00:23:18.119 --> 00:23:21.446\nSo what we'll do here is\nwe're gonna stop the printer.\n\n474\n00:23:21.446 --> 00:23:24.098\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; And [LAUGH] we're gonna\n\n475\n00:23:24.098 --> 00:23:26.800\nstart the printer.\n\n476\n00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.459\nWe just rebooted\nthe Print Spooler service.\n\n477\n00:23:28.459 --> 00:23:33.417\nAnd sometimes, tell you what, a lot of\ntimes actually, and I'm just throwing\n\n478\n00:23:33.417 --> 00:23:39.320\na number out here, 70 to 80% of the time,\nthat actually fixes your print problems.\n\n479\n00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:43.040\nIf that doesn't fix your print problems\nyou can always grab a baseball bat.\n\n480\n00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:43.920\nNo, just kidding.\n\n481\n00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:47.610\nThat's not the maintenance you want,\nbut you might feel like it.\n\n482\n00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:50.420\nSo keep in mind,\nthere are ways that you can reboot\n\n483\n00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:54.120\nthe printer inside your operating system,\nyou just have to know how to do it.\n\n484\n00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.285\nSo understand that.\n\n485\n00:23:55.285 --> 00:23:58.795\nThe other thing I want to look\nat too is just a little bit,\n\n486\n00:23:58.795 --> 00:24:04.042\nI know we're running short on time, let me\ngo and close down our services console.\n\n487\n00:24:04.042 --> 00:24:09.650\nAnd I wanna show you some of\nthe other properties of the printers.\n\n488\n00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:10.804\nAll right, so let me go ahead.\n\n489\n00:24:10.804 --> 00:24:14.493\nAnd now I'm gonna go,\nsince you've seen kinda the old interface,\n\n490\n00:24:14.493 --> 00:24:16.510\nlet's go back to the new interface.\n\n491\n00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:19.580\nAnd once you get into Windows settings,\nremember that it's Devices, and\n\n492\n00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:22.630\nthen inside of Devices,\nit's Printers &amp; scanners.\n\n493\n00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:26.160\nAnd then notice that you\ncan also manage the device.\n\n494\n00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:30.990\nNow you're not changing any\npresets on the physical device.\n\n495\n00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:35.400\nBut you're manipulating the way\nthe operating system is gonna\n\n496\n00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.590\nsend stuff to that printer.\n\n497\n00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:39.600\nSo for instance, if I choose Manage, well,\n\n498\n00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:44.900\nI guess that I can do things\nlike Print a test page.\n\n499\n00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.050\nAnd more importantly,\nhere's what I wanna show you.\n\n500\n00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:50.230\nFor instance,\nyou have Print properties, all right.\n\n501\n00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:53.304\nAnd here's where we can control\nthings like permissions, yes?\n\n502\n00:24:53.304 --> 00:24:55.770\nRemember, a printer is a shared resource.\n\n503\n00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:57.220\nWell, it can be a shared resource.\n\n504\n00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:00.440\nSo it has sharing permissions, all right?\n\n505\n00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:03.180\nRemember the ports that we were\ntalking about earlier that we'd seen?\n\n506\n00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:06.790\nWe can configure things like\nports as well as adding them.\n\n507\n00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:09.550\nEnable print pooling if we want, right?\n\n508\n00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:14.790\nAnd some of the advanced things that we\ncan do, we can do available times, right?\n\n509\n00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:18.500\nTime of day restrictions is what\nthey would call that, all right?\n\n510\n00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:23.730\nNow notice it say Spool print documents so\nprogram finishes printing faster.\n\n511\n00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.980\nYou could turn that off, all right?\n\n512\n00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.360\nNow, this printer doesn't\nallow me to do that.\n\n513\n00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:35.790\nAnd if you do that, that has the potential\nto give you better performance.\n\n514\n00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:38.990\nBut it also has a potential for\nthe print jobs to get corrupted.\n\n515\n00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:40.430\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n516\n00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:43.500\n&gt;&gt; Notice that we can also\nmanage the drivers right here\n\n517\n00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.580\non a printer by printer basis.\n\n518\n00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:48.210\nWe can install a new driver if we wanted.\n\n519\n00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:50.210\nColor management,\nI wouldn't worry too much about this.\n\n520\n00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:51.880\nThis gets kind of advanced.\n\n521\n00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:52.780\nI don't believe they're gonna\n\n522\n00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.790\nask you about color management\nhere on your printers.\n\n523\n00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:59.250\nBut it is there nonetheless,\nas well as local NTFS permissions and\n\n524\n00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:02.610\nsome of the basic device settings.\n\n525\n00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:03.850\nWe can see manual feed,\n\n526\n00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:08.640\nif it's multi-tray, and\nsome of the options, duplexing units.\n\n527\n00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:12.980\nThis tells me right away that, hey,\nthis printer is able to do duplexing.\n\n528\n00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.440\nWhich means print to both\nsides on a single pass,\n\n529\n00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.500\nrather than what you would have\nto do without a duplexing unit.\n\n530\n00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:24.360\nYou would have to turn around and feed\nyour print job in there, turn it over.\n\n531\n00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.060\nThank goodness we have\nduplexing assemblies,\n\n532\n00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:27.830\nwe don't have to worry about it.\n\n533\n00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:29.290\nAll right, so some of the things, again,\n\n534\n00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:32.100\nthat you can do to manage\nyour print properties.\n\n535\n00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:36.260\nNow looking at the print preferences,\nall right, hopefully this comes up.\n\n536\n00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:42.120\nThis is where that bidirectional\ncommunication comes in, right?\n\n537\n00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:47.160\nNotice we can do things like Paper\nQuality, Printing Shortcuts, some Effects,\n\n538\n00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.360\nFinishing as well.\n\n539\n00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:53.060\nAnd I believe there's Landscape there,\nand I don't see it, is there Collate?\n\n540\n00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:58.340\nCollate should be in here somewhere, Job\nStorage as well, and again, more Color,\n\n541\n00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:00.840\ncolor management, and\nthen some of the Advanced stuff as well.\n\n542\n00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:05.340\nAnd you can see right here,\nthat's HP, that's their software.\n\n543\n00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.590\nThat's that bidirectional communication.\n\n544\n00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:08.190\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; This is me\n\n545\n00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:09.340\ncommunicating with the printer.\n\n546\n00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:12.950\nAnd the printer, at the time, was setting\nthis up when we just connected to it.\n\n547\n00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:15.585\nSo here's a little bit of that software\nthat I've got installed so that you and\n\n548\n00:27:15.585 --> 00:27:16.755\nI can talk.\n\n549\n00:27:16.755 --> 00:27:19.835\nAnd if you need to manage me, you can\ndo it right here from this interface.\n\n550\n00:27:19.835 --> 00:27:21.865\nSo great things again to have.\n\n551\n00:27:21.865 --> 00:27:23.255\nAnd if you're talking about drivers,\n\n552\n00:27:23.255 --> 00:27:27.865\nwe can manage the drivers from print\nmanagement, from the print properties.\n\n553\n00:27:27.865 --> 00:27:29.745\nYou also have the hardware\nproperties here,\n\n554\n00:27:29.745 --> 00:27:32.485\ntoo, just like you would\nin your Device Manager.\n\n555\n00:27:32.485 --> 00:27:36.575\nYou can see some of the Settings,\neven a little bit of the Details and what\n\n556\n00:27:36.575 --> 00:27:41.291\nthe Device description is, as well as some\nof the Events behind that print device.\n\n557\n00:27:41.291 --> 00:27:44.490\nSo keep in mind some of the things\nthat we've said in this episode.\n\n558\n00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:47.365\nKnow the difference between a local\nprinter, know what a network printer is.\n\n559\n00:27:47.365 --> 00:27:50.475\nRemember, where is the print\njob being managed?\n\n560\n00:27:50.475 --> 00:27:53.025\nIs it being managed by\nthe local principal, or\n\n561\n00:27:53.025 --> 00:27:56.295\nis it being sent by the local principal,\nor to a print server?\n\n562\n00:27:56.295 --> 00:27:58.195\nThat means it's gonna be\na network based printer.\n\n563\n00:27:58.195 --> 00:28:01.045\nUnderstand print queues,\nand print to file as well.\n\n564\n00:28:01.045 --> 00:28:03.177\nJust taking the text that you\nsee within a document and\n\n565\n00:28:03.177 --> 00:28:06.235\nconverting it to either a PDF format or\nan XPS format.\n\n566\n00:28:06.235 --> 00:28:10.440\nPDF more commonly,\nXPS isn't quite as common there.\n\n567\n00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:16.070\nAs well as the Internet Printing Protocol,\nIPP, that's Internet printing.\n\n568\n00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:19.950\nIt allows you to use a Web browser to\nsend the job over the Internet and\n\n569\n00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:22.130\ndo your print services, right, from there.\n\n570\n00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:26.390\nThese are some of the things that you need\nto know when it comes to the MTA exam.\n\n571\n00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:29.310\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Wes, for\nhelping us understand print devices.\n\n572\n00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:32.020\nUnderstanding Print Devices is\nanother great episode inside of\n\n573\n00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:34.290\nMTA Windows OS Fundamentals series.\n\n574\n00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:36.350\nMake sure you watch every single episode.\n\n575\n00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:38.950\nWes has done a great job putting\nthis information together for you.\n\n576\n00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:40.430\nAnd you'll be on the course library.\n\n577\n00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:43.170\nThere's thousands of other videos\nthere to help you go further.\n\n578\n00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:44.120\nCheck those out too.\n\n579\n00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.167\nAnd tell everybody you

00:00:12.028\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.028 --> 00:00:12.661\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and\n\n5\n00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:16.466\nthank you for choosing ITProTV,\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:22.500\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, for this\nepisode of MTA Windows OS Fundamentals.\n\n7\n00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.900\nAnd this particular episode is\nunderstanding and connecting devices.\n\n8\n00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.845\nAlways wanted to do that.\n\n9\n00:00:27.845 --> 00:00:29.830\n[LAUGH] Wes Bryan is here to help us out.\n\n10\n00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:30.740\nWes, thanks for coming.\n\n11\n00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.110\n&gt;&gt; Hey Zach, thanks for having me here.\n\n12\n00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.190\nThat's right, we get to look at, well,\nlike Zach said, connecting devices, and\n\n13\n00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.690\nwhat that means for us, right?\n\n14\n00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:38.670\nWe talk about devices.\n\n15\n00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.720\nWhat do we mean by devices?\n\n16\n00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.785\nWell we're talking about devices\nthat you connect to basically\n\n17\n00:00:43.785 --> 00:00:46.728\nthe peripheral connections\non your machine.\n\n18\n00:00:46.728 --> 00:00:50.475\nAnd it is important to just have some\nbasic understanding as you go into your\n\n19\n00:00:50.475 --> 00:00:54.340\nMTA exam, the different type of devices\nthat you can potentially face when it\n\n20\n00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.792\ncomes to your connections.\n\n21\n00:00:55.792 --> 00:01:00.160\nAll right, so let's go ahead and let's\ndive into the first couple of concepts,\n\n22\n00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.700\nright, video devices.\n\n23\n00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.209\nWe talk about our video devices, these\ncould be a couple of different things,\n\n24\n00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:10.034\nthey could be just straight up\nyour display, your video adapter,\n\n25\n00:01:10.034 --> 00:01:12.309\nit has a connection port on it, right?\n\n26\n00:01:12.309 --> 00:01:15.744\nAnd that connection port is then\nconnected to a cable that is connected to\n\n27\n00:01:15.744 --> 00:01:17.890\nan external monitor, right?\n\n28\n00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.740\nNow, that's one type of video connection.\n\n29\n00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.150\nBut you can also have other things too.\n\n30\n00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.870\nLike for instance,\nyou can have a webcams, right?\n\n31\n00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.450\nThese could be external devices\nthat you're connected to likewise.\n\n32\n00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.270\nAll right,\nwe also have audio devices, right?\n\n33\n00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.200\nAnd an audio device is exactly what\nit sounds like, it's your speakers.\n\n34\n00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.890\nNow the speakers could be integrated and\n\n35\n00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.720\nif they're integrated,\nlet's say if it's a mobile device, then\n\n36\n00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.250\nyou're really not talking about connecting\nanything, it's already connected for you.\n\n37\n00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.950\nHowever, if you have either integrated\ninto the functionality of the motherboard,\n\n38\n00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.550\nyou have an audio port, the little TRS.\n\n39\n00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.520\nWhat is it, the eighth inch jack?\n\n40\n00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.420\nThen you can connect to external speakers.\n\n41\n00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.130\nNow when you talk about connecting\nto the external speakers,\n\n42\n00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.640\nthese are also audio devices.\n\n43\n00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.950\nIt's just basic understanding\nof a video device.\n\n44\n00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.050\nWhat does a video device do?\n\n45\n00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.210\nA video device gives you some kind\nof graphic output, all right?\n\n46\n00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.400\nAn audio device, an audio device\nis some kind of sound output, and\n\n47\n00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.640\nthere are different ways that we\ncan do some basic configurations.\n\n48\n00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.370\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n49\n00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.130\nWe're on our Windows 10 machine here.\n\n50\n00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.610\nAnd if we right-click on our Windows tile,\nor Windows icon, if you will.\n\n51\n00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.220\nI'm so used to calling it start button,\neven though it's not start button anymore.\n\n52\n00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.109\nAnd we choose settings.\n\n53\n00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.380\nAll right,\nunder Windows Settings we have Devices.\n\n54\n00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.150\nAll right now, we'll just go ahead and\n\n55\n00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.050\nwe'll just put that to the side here for\na second.\n\n56\n00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.340\nWhat I want to do is go over\nto our Windows 8.1 machine,\n\n57\n00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.560\ncuz this will also apply to Windows 7.\n\n58\n00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.727\nLikewise, let me go ahead and\n\n59\n00:02:44.727 --> 00:02:46.934\nclose down some of these other\ninterfaces we have open.\n\n60\n00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:49.515\nWe're gonna right-click on our\nWindows charm or tile, and\n\n61\n00:02:49.515 --> 00:02:51.599\nwe're gonna choose Control Panel,\nall right?\n\n62\n00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.321\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nswitch this back to Category view just for\n\n63\n00:02:54.321 --> 00:02:56.724\nnow because I want you to see\nhow it is categorized, right?\n\n64\n00:02:56.724 --> 00:02:59.082\nAnd notice that we have Hardware and\nSound, right?\n\n65\n00:02:59.082 --> 00:03:01.768\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So the term is a little bit different,\n\n66\n00:03:01.768 --> 00:03:06.113\nbut this would also bring us where we\ncould look at different devices that\n\n67\n00:03:06.113 --> 00:03:10.531\nare connected to the machine,\nincluding our sound, our audio devices,\n\n68\n00:03:10.531 --> 00:03:12.160\nas well as our display.\n\n69\n00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.830\nWe've talked about display settings\nin other episodes, but again,\n\n70\n00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.750\nthis is directly related to the devices\nthat are connected to your machines.\n\n71\n00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.150\nNow we're gonna go ahead and just kind\nof bump back over here to Windows 10 so\n\n72\n00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.970\nwe can show you this interface,\nand we're gonna get into Devices.\n\n73\n00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.110\nAnd you could see that we've got\na series of devices that may or\n\n74\n00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.760\nmay not be connected to our machine,\nall right.\n\n75\n00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.710\nIf you're talking about Bluetooth devices,\nBluetooth devices are those\n\n76\n00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.530\nwireless communications that we actually\nhave to pair the devices up, right?\n\n77\n00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.900\nI have to find the device\nout there on the network and\n\n78\n00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.250\nthen potentially enter a PIN, right,\na personal identification number.\n\n79\n00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.430\nA lot of times,\nit's set by default to all zeroes.\n\n80\n00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.300\nAnd it goes through this pairing process,\nwhere the device that you're connecting\n\n81\n00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.490\nand your machine enter this\ntrust relationship, all right?\n\n82\n00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:54.740\nBut then we have other devices too.\n\n83\n00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.080\nYou can see for\ninstance we got our audio devices and\n\n84\n00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.410\nif I click on this I could remove,\nI'm not gonna remove it here.\n\n85\n00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.400\nBut you can see some of the different\naudio devices that we have, and\n\n86\n00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.560\nthen other devices.\n\n87\n00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.601\nFor instance, a monitor,\n\n88\n00:04:06.601 --> 00:04:11.140\nyou can see our network adapters here too,\ngot hubs as well.\n\n89\n00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.472\nWe got our USB Video Device, right,\n\n90\n00:04:13.472 --> 00:04:17.030\nin this case it's going to\nbe a virtualized web camera.\n\n91\n00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.990\nSo, again, video devices and audio devices\ncould be connected to your machine.\n\n92\n00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:29.470\nNow they also want you to understand\nthe concept of device drivers.\n\n93\n00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.850\nSo I wanna take a second here, I wanna\ntalk a little bit about device drivers.\n\n94\n00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.170\nWhat is a device driver?\n\n95\n00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.700\nAll right, well this goes to basically\nthe architecture of an operating system.\n\n96\n00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.850\nSee an operating system is\nwritten in a very generic\n\n97\n00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.510\nhigh level programing language, all right?\n\n98\n00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.950\nAnd the high level programming language\nisn't something that your hardware\n\n99\n00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.120\nunderstands at all.\n\n100\n00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.901\nIt doesn't even work with that\nhigh level programming language.\n\n101\n00:04:53.901 --> 00:04:56.238\nAnd you're going to say,\nwell wait a second Wes,\n\n102\n00:04:56.238 --> 00:04:59.077\nwhen I hit the volume button on\nmy Windows operating system,\n\n103\n00:04:59.077 --> 00:05:02.000\nit controls the speakers so\nthe volume goes up and down.\n\n104\n00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.097\nHow is it that you say my operating system\ndoesn't understand my hardware because I\n\n105\n00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:09.094\ncan manipulate the hardware\nthrough the operating system?\n\n106\n00:05:09.094 --> 00:05:10.586\nThat's where the driver comes in.\n\n107\n00:05:10.586 --> 00:05:13.538\nSee, your devices, your hardware devices,\n\n108\n00:05:13.538 --> 00:05:19.550\nthey are written in machine specific code,\na very low level machine specific code.\n\n109\n00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.140\nAnd the high level programming language\nthat your operating system is written in\n\n110\n00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.280\nand the low level programming or\nthe machine code,\n\n111\n00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.000\nthey don't work well together.\n\n112\n00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.710\nThey don't understand each other.\n\n113\n00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.150\nSo what you do is you put a small\nlittle piece of software in the middle\n\n114\n00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.230\nthat acts like kinda like a translator.\n\n115\n00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.670\nIt takes those instructions down from\nthe high level programming language and\n\n116\n00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:45.160\nconverts it into a machine specific\ncommand that your hardware reacts to.\n\n117\n00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.160\nYour device drivers.\n\n118\n00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.600\nConsider it as like an interpreter between\nthe high level programming language and\n\n119\n00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.900\nthose machine specific commands.\n\n120\n00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.440\nNow device drivers are typically\nmaintained by the manufacturers\n\n121\n00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.490\nthemselves.\n\n122\n00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.720\nYou do have some drivers that are built\nright into your operating system because\n\n123\n00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.160\nof another technology called plug and\nplay, all right?\n\n124\n00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.450\nWhat is plug and play?\n\n125\n00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.090\nWell, let's break down the words.\n\n126\n00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.820\nPlug and play, all right?\n\n127\n00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.530\nWhat this means is that I can connect the\ndevice and I should be able, if plug and\n\n128\n00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.100\nplay does its job,\nit should recognize the device and\n\n129\n00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.680\nI should be able to use it, all right?\n\n130\n00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.890\nSo what do I mean here?\n\n131\n00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:22.720\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n132\n00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.504\nI got a little thumb drive here and\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n133\n00:06:25.504 --> 00:06:28.407\nI'm gonna plug it into our\nWindows 10 machine and when we\n\n134\n00:06:28.407 --> 00:06:32.782\nplug this into the Windows 10 machine,\nhopefully it'll show me that it's there.\n\n135\n00:06:32.782 --> 00:06:35.407\nAnd let me go ahead and make sure that\nI connect it to the Windows 10 box,\n\n136\n00:06:35.407 --> 00:06:38.260\nthis is something specific to the Mac,\ndon't worry about that.\n\n137\n00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:45.484\nBut notice that it says USB Drive,\nnow it recognized the hardware right away,\n\n138\n00:06:45.484 --> 00:06:50.199\nand If I want,\nI can now go down to my File Explorer.\n\n139\n00:06:51.585 --> 00:06:54.969\nAnd in File Explorer, if I go to This PC,\n\n140\n00:06:54.969 --> 00:07:00.160\nI can now see that I have a,\nwell, this is just a 16 GB drive.\n\n141\n00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.580\nRemember, has is a little overhead, so\nyou're only gonna get about 14 GB, but\n\n142\n00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.930\nit recognizes it, it's a USB device,\nit's a USB Drive.\n\n143\n00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.100\nI didn't have to do any configurations.\n\n144\n00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.590\nSee in the early days, prior to having\nplug and play, we had what's known as,\n\n145\n00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:17.180\nwell when it was being invented and\nit was kind of becoming a thing,\n\n146\n00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.988\nit was called plug and pray.\n\n147\n00:07:18.988 --> 00:07:19.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n148\n00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.900\nthat's because in the earlier\ndays of your operating systems,\n\n149\n00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.100\nyou had to manually configure\nthe resources, right?\n\n150\n00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.440\nWe had to go in and\nwe had to tell the operating system.\n\n151\n00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.380\nThis is the interrupt request\nline that you're gonna interrupt\n\n152\n00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.205\nthe CPU to call attention to it.\n\n153\n00:07:33.205 --> 00:07:36.190\nThis is the memory address,\nthe memory reason you're gonna use.\n\n154\n00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.040\nWe had to do all this manually, right?\n\n155\n00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.190\nWe don't have to do this manually anymore.\n\n156\n00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.483\nPlug and play, it will look at the device,\n\n157\n00:07:43.483 --> 00:07:47.646\nwhen it's plugged in the device will\ntalk directly to the operating system.\n\n158\n00:07:47.646 --> 00:07:51.245\nIt will say, let's say Zach is\nthe operating system, it will say Zach,\n\n159\n00:07:51.245 --> 00:07:53.024\nthis is the device I am, all right?\n\n160\n00:07:53.024 --> 00:07:56.016\nNow Zach as the operating system,\nZach is actually gonna look, and\n\n161\n00:07:56.016 --> 00:07:56.970\nis gonna say, okay.\n\n162\n00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.681\nYou say you're this.\n\n163\n00:07:58.681 --> 00:08:04.268\nLet me look down into the drivers that I\nhave bundled into the operating system and\n\n164\n00:08:04.268 --> 00:08:08.470\nI can find what you're telling me you are,\nall right?\n\n165\n00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:12.540\nBecause not only does the device\nsay this is what I am, it also says\n\n166\n00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:16.510\nthis is what I do and these are the\nresources that I need to perform that job.\n\n167\n00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.380\nAnd it's up to the Windows plug and\n\n168\n00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.607\nplay subsystem to look down\ninto its configuration files,\n\n169\n00:08:21.607 --> 00:08:26.252\nfind the driver based on its identity and\nits functionality, and install that driver\n\n170\n00:08:26.252 --> 00:08:29.636\nand give you that level of service\nthat the device is calling.\n\n171\n00:08:29.636 --> 00:08:31.641\nAnd in fact,\nI can kinda show you this too.\n\n172\n00:08:31.641 --> 00:08:35.794\nIf we dig down into our Windows\noperating system here, and\n\n173\n00:08:35.794 --> 00:08:40.473\nlet's go into this PC,\nwe'll go to Local Disk (C:), right?\n\n174\n00:08:40.473 --> 00:08:43.228\nNow here's where we get to see a little\nbit more of the file hierarchy, right?\n\n175\n00:08:43.228 --> 00:08:47.158\nIf I go into Windows, and\nI'll just go ahead and\n\n176\n00:08:47.158 --> 00:08:52.970\nchoose the Name column, and\nwe'll switch this right over to system.\n\n177\n00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.180\nNo, let's try that again.\n\n178\n00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:58.390\nSo System32 is what I'm looking for,\nand there it is.\n\n179\n00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:05.370\nAll right, so if I look at System32, all\nright, and we scroll down, we see drivers.\n\n180\n00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:09.240\nAnd these are all the drivers that this\nmachine is currently aware of, all right?\n\n181\n00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:15.920\nBut when I plug that driver in, it's going\nto look at the driver store, all right?\n\n182\n00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:20.350\nAnd these are some hidden files, so you\ncan see that here's my file repository.\n\n183\n00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:25.690\nNow in that driver store, when the device\nis plugged in, it says, okay, you're this.\n\n184\n00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:32.920\nLet me look in this store to see if I can\nfind a driver that matches your identity.\n\n185\n00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.600\nAnd then what I'll do is I'll\nconfigure those resources for you and\n\n186\n00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.490\nmake that device available.\n\n187\n00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:42.100\nBring it online and I'll give you\nthe services that it's telling me that\n\n188\n00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:45.790\nthe operating system's telling\nit it should provide, right?\n\n189\n00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:47.340\nSo that's a great thing about plug and\nplay.\n\n190\n00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:54.000\nAll right, now, I will tell you that\nsometimes, with plug and play, one\n\n191\n00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.880\nof the things that can happen is you can\nget what's known as autoplay, all right?\n\n192\n00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:02.730\nAnd I wanna take a second to talk just\na little bit about autoplay, all right?\n\n193\n00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.900\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nI just pulled this drive out.\n\n194\n00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.040\nNow I shouldn't have done that,\nand I'll show you why.\n\n195\n00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.000\nCuz there's a right way and a wrong\nway to unplug devices with plug and\n\n196\n00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.160\nplay, all right?\n\n197\n00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.510\nNow if we go ahead and\ngo back to my Windows machine,\n\n198\n00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:16.870\nlet's see if this happens again,\nall right?\n\n199\n00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:17.850\nHopefully it does.\n\n200\n00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.720\nAll right, so notice that we've\ngot the USB drive comes up.\n\n201\n00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.450\nIt's letting me know.\n\n202\n00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.972\nBut then it says, choose, or\nselect that to choose what happens, right?\n\n203\n00:10:24.972 --> 00:10:29.910\nAutoplay does exactly what it sounds like.\n\n204\n00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:34.290\nWhen you plug a device in, specifically a\nstorage device, what do you want me to do?\n\n205\n00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:36.870\nRight?\nWell, I, for security purposes,\n\n206\n00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.040\nI usually say Take no action.\n\n207\n00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.630\nOr Open the folder to view the files.\n\n208\n00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:43.490\nI might not want that to happen, right?\n\n209\n00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:47.400\nSo for security purposes,\nyou might just say take no action, right?\n\n210\n00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.240\nBecause that could be a security\nvulnerability if it just\n\n211\n00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.920\nautomatically does something.\n\n212\n00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.460\nAll right, so\nyou might wanna say Take no action.\n\n213\n00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.190\nThat's what I do just for\nsecurity purposes.\n\n214\n00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:02.120\nBut I will tell you that doesn't disable\nthe fact, if we bring back up our\n\n215\n00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:08.330\ncomputer here and we give it a second.\n\n216\n00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.644\nAnd we wait for it,\nlooks like I confused it a little bit.\n\n217\n00:11:11.644 --> 00:11:16.196\n[LAUGH] All right, and hopefully, well,\nrather than waiting on it to render here,\n\n218\n00:11:16.196 --> 00:11:20.800\nyou can see that that doesn't mean that\nthe USB drive isn't available and ready.\n\n219\n00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.990\nIt just means I don't want you\nto automatically take an action.\n\n220\n00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:26.923\nBecause if there's boot code in this or\nsomething that kinda bootstraps a virus,\n\n221\n00:11:26.923 --> 00:11:29.150\nwell, that's gonna automatically happen.\n\n222\n00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:30.160\nAnd I don't want that to happen.\n\n223\n00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.580\nSo keep in mind that you\ncould also see that too.\n\n224\n00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.160\nNow, when you plug a device in,\nthat's one thing.\n\n225\n00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:41.165\nWhen you eject a device, typically what\nyou should do is you should use the safely\n\n226\n00:11:41.165 --> 00:11:44.950\nremove or eject hardware\nfunctionality built into Windows.\n\n227\n00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:48.300\nNow my head's kinda covering this up\ncuz it's down in the notification area.\n\n228\n00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.940\nBut if we zoom in to\nthe notification area,\n\n229\n00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.950\nyou'll see there's this icon that says\nSafely Remove Hardware and Eject Media.\n\n230\n00:11:54.950 --> 00:12:00.180\nAnd if I choose that, what I should do\nif I want to eject this hard drive or\n\n231\n00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:03.450\nthis USB thumb drive, and it's called\nUltra by the way, that's it, you can kinda\n\n232\n00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:07.880\nsee it's grayed out there, USB Drive (F:),\nis what I should do is choose Eject.\n\n233\n00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:08.936\nI should disconnect this device.\n\n234\n00:12:08.936 --> 00:12:13.430\nSo now notice it says that it's\nsafe to remove this hardware.\n\n235\n00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:18.820\nAnd that just ensures that the device\nis brought offline that a program\n\n236\n00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.340\nisn't currently using this drive,\nbecause I want you to think about it.\n\n237\n00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.537\nThere's a file that's on this drive\nthat maybe I have opened in PowerPoint,\n\n238\n00:12:24.537 --> 00:12:27.929\nthere's a PowerPoint slide there, right,\nand I'm using it in PowerPoint, and\n\n239\n00:12:27.929 --> 00:12:29.418\nI reach over, and I pull the drive.\n\n240\n00:12:29.418 --> 00:12:32.218\nWell if I've got any write\noperations that are happening,\n\n241\n00:12:32.218 --> 00:12:34.070\nI can permanently corrupt that drive.\n\n242\n00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:35.759\nAnd now I have to format it and\nI lose all the data on it.\n\n243\n00:12:35.759 --> 00:12:39.493\nAll right, so it is important to remember\nthat when you are ejecting a plug and\n\n244\n00:12:39.493 --> 00:12:43.430\nplay device, that typically you use,\nespecially when it's storage unit.\n\n245\n00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:46.140\nIf it's a web cam or something like that,\nyou can pull the device cuz\n\n246\n00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.330\nit's not really writing any\ninformation to the hard drive.\n\n247\n00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:53.070\nBut just be aware of again, plugging and\n\n248\n00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:57.130\nconnecting and disconnecting,\nif you will, plug and play based devices.\n\n249\n00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:00.490\nNow, I talked about drivers.\n\n250\n00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:03.760\nHow do we manage drivers\ninside our Windows, right?\n\n251\n00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.750\nWell, let's go ahead and\n\n252\n00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:07.280\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nclose down our interface here.\n\n253\n00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.230\nI'm gonna right-click on\nour Windows icon here.\n\n254\n00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:14.410\nAnd I wanna talk about\nthis utility right here.\n\n255\n00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:16.640\nThis utility is called Device Manager.\n\n256\n00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.150\nNow I will tell you if we scroll down you\ncan also find it in Computer Management.\n\n257\n00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:23.210\nSo let me go ahead and\nbring up both interfaces just because\n\n258\n00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:26.170\nI don't know which one they're\ngonna ask you about on the exam.\n\n259\n00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:28.310\nSo I brought up Computer Management first.\n\n260\n00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:30.270\nWe bring up Device Manager second.\n\n261\n00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:33.395\nNotice that they are two\nseparate interfaces, all right?\n\n262\n00:13:33.395 --> 00:13:38.020\nWell, notice that we\nhave Device Manager here.\n\n263\n00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:42.300\nAnd if you look they are,oops,\nif I hide them, let's go ahead and\n\n264\n00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.800\nuse our snap functionality here.\n\n265\n00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:48.730\nNotice that outside, and I think I\ncan get rid of the action pane here.\n\n266\n00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:51.900\nNope, we'll just go ahead and keep the\naction pane, but we'll expand this out,\n\n267\n00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.060\nmake it a little bit easier to see.\n\n268\n00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.617\nNotice that they are the same interface,\nright?\n\n269\n00:13:54.617 --> 00:13:59.190\nIf I look at the highest part of\nthe hierarchy, here's my computer.\n\n270\n00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:03.875\nAnd all of the devices, system devices,\n\n271\n00:14:03.875 --> 00:14:10.940\nthird-party devices that are connected to\nthe machine and also the current state.\n\n272\n00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.580\nIs my Operating System are aware of them,\nall right?\n\n273\n00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:18.840\nDevice Manager is where you go to manage\nall of your device drivers, right?\n\n274\n00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.900\nSo for instance,\nif I let's say I've got a,\n\n275\n00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.840\nlet's say I've got Display adapter, right?\n\n276\n00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.360\nThis is one that we always\nhave to worry about drivers,\n\n277\n00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.670\nvideo drivers are always being updated.\n\n278\n00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:32.840\nBut if I right-click on that\ndevice under Display adapters,\n\n279\n00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.530\nI select it, right-click,\nI've got a few options.\n\n280\n00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:39.047\nNotice that I can, oop,\nI can scroll it right off the screen.\n\n281\n00:14:39.047 --> 00:14:41.370\n[LAUGH] All right, let's try that again.\n\n282\n00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:43.760\nI can update the driver, right?\n\n283\n00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.230\nNow, well, let's talk about\nupdating the driver, all right?\n\n284\n00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:49.120\nBecause drivers do periodically\nneed updated, right,\n\n285\n00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.490\nas manufacturers notice\nfunctionality flaws,\n\n286\n00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:55.740\nsecurity vulnerabilities, or\nmaybe they wanna add some functionality.\n\n287\n00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:59.840\nWhat they have to do is they have\nto update that little translator\n\n288\n00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.690\nthat allows the operating system to\ncontrol the hardware device, right?\n\n289\n00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:06.750\nBut there are two different locations\nyou can go when it comes to\n\n290\n00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:10.360\nupdating your drivers through\nDevice Manager, all right?\n\n291\n00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:15.000\nHere is one, Search automatically for\nupdated driver software.\n\n292\n00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.847\nNotice it says Windows will search\nyour computer and the Internet for\n\n293\n00:15:17.847 --> 00:15:19.671\nthe latest driver software on your device.\n\n294\n00:15:19.671 --> 00:15:24.680\nSo where is it looking in Windows?\n\n295\n00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:25.870\nDown in the driver store.\n\n296\n00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:26.510\nDo I have it?\n\n297\n00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:27.920\nAm I aware of it?\n\n298\n00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:32.371\nNow a lot of times Windows has got really,\nreally good with bundling in a lot of\n\n299\n00:15:32.371 --> 00:15:35.610\ndrivers like right into\nthe operating system.\n\n300\n00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:36.796\nYou don't have to worry about.\n\n301\n00:15:36.796 --> 00:15:41.444\nNow if it doesn't bind them and sometimes\nthat happens especially if Windows 10 is\n\n302\n00:15:41.444 --> 00:15:46.092\nreleased, and then a device that does\nsupport Windows 10 is released after that,\n\n303\n00:15:46.092 --> 00:15:48.580\nit doesn't necessarily\nmean that Windows or\n\n304\n00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.732\nMicrosoft has bundled it into\nthe driver store, right?\n\n305\n00:15:51.732 --> 00:15:57.170\nBut what they could have done is\nthey work with the manufacturer.\n\n306\n00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:01.450\nAnd they run it through something known\nas Windows Hardware Quality Labs, right.\n\n307\n00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:02.330\nThey stress test it.\n\n308\n00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:05.110\nThey make sure that the device\ndriver isn't going to\n\n309\n00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:08.470\ncause problems with the operating system,\nisn't going to make it unstable.\n\n310\n00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:11.470\nAnd once that's done, they digitally\nsign it so you know that it is valid.\n\n311\n00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:12.570\nIt came from Microsoft.\n\n312\n00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:14.360\nWe make sure that it\nmaintains it's integrity and\n\n313\n00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.080\nthen they stick it up on\nthe Windows update servers.\n\n314\n00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.700\nSo that's the Internet side of this.\n\n315\n00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.320\nWhere are we going when we're\ngoing to search the Internet for\n\n316\n00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.370\nthe latest drivers?\n\n317\n00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:25.390\nWell, you're going to search Windows\nUpdate, and I want you to understand that.\n\n318\n00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:29.290\nBecause if it's not in\nthe Windows Update store and\n\n319\n00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:33.930\nI say store, it's not a place that you buy\nthings, but where they store it, right?\n\n320\n00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:35.710\nIf it's not on the Windows Update servers,\n\n321\n00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:37.696\ndoes that mean that a new\ndriver doesn't exist?\n\n322\n00:16:37.696 --> 00:16:42.463\nNot at all because manufacturers have to\ngo through a petty rigorous process to get\n\n323\n00:16:42.463 --> 00:16:44.681\ntheir drivers in the Windows Update.\n\n324\n00:16:44.681 --> 00:16:47.226\nIt has to be digitally signed,\nit's got to be run through labs and\n\n325\n00:16:47.226 --> 00:16:50.560\nsometimes they update there drivers and\nthey don't put it in the Windows Update.\n\n326\n00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.730\nOr maybe it's come up and\n\n327\n00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:55.520\nit's so new they haven't gone\nthrough that process, all right.\n\n328\n00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.060\nSo here's where you gonna us\nthe other option, all right.\n\n329\n00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:00.130\nYou are gonna go to\nthe manufacture's website,\n\n330\n00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:03.340\nyou're gonna download the driver to,\nwell, your USB device and\n\n331\n00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:07.700\nthen you're going to say browse my\ncomputer for that driver, all right.\n\n332\n00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:11.870\nNow what you can do is, you can\nbrowse to that location in this case.\n\n333\n00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:16.080\nWhat I would do, and let me go and\nplug in this back see if it'll update.\n\n334\n00:17:18.622 --> 00:17:20.330\nDid it update?\n\n335\n00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:22.490\nIt doesn't like it updated yet.\n\n336\n00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:25.990\nThere it is, had to wait for plug and play\nto go back through its process, right?\n\n337\n00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:27.984\nHey, I think I know what that device is.\n\n338\n00:17:27.984 --> 00:17:30.731\nOkay, I see that driver,\nthat's a USB device.\n\n339\n00:17:30.731 --> 00:17:32.827\nLet me get it online for\nyou and initialize it.\n\n340\n00:17:32.827 --> 00:17:37.307\nAll right, and then I can point it to,\nright, I can point to the USB drive and\n\n341\n00:17:37.307 --> 00:17:39.840\nI can say okay,\nthis is where my driver is.\n\n342\n00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.702\nNow I am not going to do that because\nI don't have a driver here but\n\n343\n00:17:42.702 --> 00:17:45.096\nI just wanted to show you that\nis one places you can go.\n\n344\n00:17:45.096 --> 00:17:49.685\nNow, they really don't want you doing\nany manual configuration of drivers\n\n345\n00:17:49.685 --> 00:17:53.916\nanymore because there are awesome\nadditional drivers, like I said,\n\n346\n00:17:53.916 --> 00:17:57.550\nthat are bundled into\nthe Windows operating system.\n\n347\n00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:01.313\nAnd notice it says let me pick from a list\nof available drivers on my computer.\n\n348\n00:18:01.313 --> 00:18:05.153\nHere's where you can actually browse\nsome of those device drivers that\n\n349\n00:18:05.153 --> 00:18:06.245\nare on the machine.\n\n350\n00:18:06.245 --> 00:18:08.317\nNotice that we have Microsoft, and\n\n351\n00:18:08.317 --> 00:18:12.660\none of the great things is we find out\nif the driver is digitally signed.\n\n352\n00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:16.570\nThat means we can verify the publisher of\nthe driver and we could also verify when\n\n353\n00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:19.840\nthat driver is downloaded and\ninstalled, it hasn't been modified.\n\n354\n00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.270\nWhether it's malicious modification or\nnetwork corruption,\n\n355\n00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:24.140\nright there it just depends, right?\n\n356\n00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:27.070\nBut here's what some times\nyou can get into trouble.\n\n357\n00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:29.800\nIf I uncheck this show\ncompatible hardware,\n\n358\n00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:33.500\nyou'll notice we've got quite\na few other ones, right?\n\n359\n00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:37.500\nI don't recommend this, and really, what\nyou should be using is Plug &amp; Play, or\n\n360\n00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.710\nyou should always be using the suggested,\n\n361\n00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:44.000\nrecommended manufacturer driver, if it\nisn't bundled into Windows, all right?\n\n362\n00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\ncancel this, all right?\n\n363\n00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.390\nAnd I also want you to look at some of the\nother things that you can do, all right?\n\n364\n00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:54.260\nBe careful, disabling the device.\n\n365\n00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.730\nWhat it does is it does exactly that.\n\n366\n00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:59.380\nIt says the operating system says well,\nI'm just not gonna look at it right now.\n\n367\n00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.930\nYou're turning off the communication\nbetween the operating system,\n\n368\n00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:03.330\nthe driver, and the device itself.\n\n369\n00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:04.910\nYou're saying just turn it off.\n\n370\n00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.560\nLast one here, before careful.\n\n371\n00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.640\nUninstall the device.\n\n372\n00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.170\nWhen you uninstall a device,\n\n373\n00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:17.640\nthat doesn't magically unplug\nthe USB thumb drive, right?\n\n374\n00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.400\nThat would be kind of freaky if it did.\n\n375\n00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.050\nIf I said uninstall the device and\nit just chucked the USB\n\n376\n00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:25.970\nthumb drive right out of the computer,\nI might run, but what does that mean?\n\n377\n00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:31.560\nIt says when you uninstall the device,\nyou're removing the device driver.\n\n378\n00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:34.048\nAll right, so you got to be\ncareful with that, all right.\n\n379\n00:19:34.048 --> 00:19:38.700\nMake sure, that is something\nthat you wanna do, all right.\n\n380\n00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.180\nI don't recommend doing that.\n\n381\n00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:44.760\nNow, because of plug and play, you can\nalso scan for hardware changes, right.\n\n382\n00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:45.790\nAnd it's gonna go through and\n\n383\n00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:48.530\nit's gonna query all the devices\nthat's connected to it.\n\n384\n00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:51.590\nIt's gonna say maybe I don't\nhave an updated list, right?\n\n385\n00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:52.960\nUsually it happens by default, but\n\n386\n00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.547\nyou can also manually configure that too,\nall right?\n\n387\n00:19:56.547 --> 00:19:59.910\nNow, other things and\nlet me show you one here.\n\n388\n00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:04.365\nNotice that little down arrow Zach, the\nblack arrow there, and the circle there?\n\n389\n00:20:04.365 --> 00:20:05.310\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; That's actually a device\n\n390\n00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:06.810\nthat's disabled.\n\n391\n00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:12.560\nAll right, now, if you see\na exclamation point on the device.\n\n392\n00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:16.931\nAnd let me see, maybe I can,\nI'm not sure if I can.\n\n393\n00:20:18.716 --> 00:20:20.550\nI'm gonna tell you to do\nsomething that I don't wanna do.\n\n394\n00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:21.610\nI'll probably break my machine.\n\n395\n00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:24.960\nI'm gonna try to simulate this, but when\n\n396\n00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:29.090\nyou see an exclamation point that mean you\nhave a problem with the device, right?\n\n397\n00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:31.810\nWhen you have a problem with the device,\nit typically means you need to update\n\n398\n00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:34.870\nthe drivers and you need to go through the\nprocess of making sure that the driver is\n\n399\n00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:37.840\na non corrupted state, and\nthat it's the latest and greatest.\n\n400\n00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.840\nIf you end up seeing a question mark and\n\n401\n00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.750\nanother category in here typically,\nand again cuz they're alphabetic.\n\n402\n00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:49.630\nYou will see it right, L, M, N, O,\n\n403\n00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:52.270\nP, right, you'll see it right\nin here between N and P.\n\n404\n00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:57.590\nAnd it'll say Other Devices, and it'll\ngenerically let's say ethernet controller,\n\n405\n00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:00.390\nand it'll have question marks,\nright, well what does that mean?\n\n406\n00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:05.390\nWell the question mark means, it told\nme it was an Ethernet controller, so\n\n407\n00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:06.930\nI could at least tell you that much.\n\n408\n00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:10.920\nBut when I looked, I didn't find a driver\nthat was associated with its identifier.\n\n409\n00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.630\nSo I'm not sure what it is,\nand you can't talk to it.\n\n410\n00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:14.730\nSo you don't have the device driver.\n\n411\n00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:17.420\nAnd that's why I say, it's always good\nto go out to your manufacturers, and\n\n412\n00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.380\nget your drivers from your manufacturers.\n\n413\n00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:22.800\nSpecifically, when it comes to\nchip-set drivers for a motherboard.\n\n414\n00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:26.460\nThat's one of the first things that I like\nto do when I am installing the Windows\n\n415\n00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:30.170\noperating system on a machine, is to go\nthe manufacturer of that motherboard and\n\n416\n00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:34.430\ndownload the chipset driver so that I know\nthat the Windows operating system will be\n\n417\n00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:37.990\naware in device manager of the devices\nthat are connected to the machine.\n\n418\n00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:41.080\nEspecially those integrated devices if\nyou guys are maybe coming over from\n\n419\n00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:41.880\nCompTIA's A+.\n\n420\n00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:45.150\nIf not maybe you know that some of\nthe ports that you have on the back of\n\n421\n00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:47.570\nthe machine are actually\nintegrated into the motherboard.\n\n422\n00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:49.760\nWell it's important for\nthat chipset driver to be there so\n\n423\n00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.510\nit's aware of what those devices are,\neven though they're not really\n\n424\n00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:54.970\nphysical devices that you can install or\nattach to the machine.\n\n425\n00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:59.180\nThe same rule applies when\nit comes to device manager.\n\n426\n00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:05.620\nNow that being said, I've kind of done\nthe very generic route of showing\n\n427\n00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:10.430\nyou update driver disable uninstall\nscan and haven't showed your properties.\n\n428\n00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:13.060\nI would there but,\novershot the run way on that one.\n\n429\n00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:17.360\nLet's go ahead and wait, but let's go\nahead and go into properties because\n\n430\n00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:21.060\nproperties gives you the ability\nto do more than that, right?\n\n431\n00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:24.520\nRemember when I told you, I said, if you\nhave a little exclamation point on it,\n\n432\n00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.260\nthe device will it's not working properly.\n\n433\n00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:30.450\nWell, that will actually be\nevident here in the device status.\n\n434\n00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:33.350\nNow it says this device\nis working properly.\n\n435\n00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:36.930\nBut you might see an error occurred and\nmaybe you can't use the device.\n\n436\n00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:40.988\nA lot of times that's a typical,\neither there's a wrong driver installed or\n\n437\n00:22:40.988 --> 00:22:43.623\nthe driver that is installed\nhas been corrupted.\n\n438\n00:22:43.623 --> 00:22:47.792\nAll right, now,\nnext thing we have is the driver tab and\n\n439\n00:22:47.792 --> 00:22:52.242\nin the driver tab imagine what\nyou can see in the driver tab.\n\n440\n00:22:52.242 --> 00:22:55.762\nWhere you can manipulate and\nmanage the drivers if you want.\n\n441\n00:22:55.762 --> 00:22:58.050\nI can see who provided it,\n\n442\n00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:03.420\nI can see the date it was\npublished as well as the version.\n\n443\n00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:09.070\nAnd that's important, right, because do\nI have the latest and greatest driver?\n\n444\n00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:10.490\nHeck if I know, I'm not sure.\n\n445\n00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:13.700\nI'm hoping Microsoft, when I connect\nto Windows Update, they have it.\n\n446\n00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.220\nBut then, you always have to check.\n\n447\n00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:17.770\nGo to the manufacturers website.\n\n448\n00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:19.400\nSee what their version number says, and\n\n449\n00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.510\nthen compare it back to\nwhat you see in here.\n\n450\n00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:24.560\nRight and then you also see the options\nhere too, update the driver,\n\n451\n00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:27.330\ndisable device, and uninstall device.\n\n452\n00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:30.444\nBut what if I want to know a little\nbit more information, right?\n\n453\n00:23:30.444 --> 00:23:31.910\nWell, that's where driver details.\n\n454\n00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:34.460\nI skipped over that one on purpose, right.\n\n455\n00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:36.530\nWhere driver details come up.\n\n456\n00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:39.590\nNow remember I told you\nwhere the driver was stored.\n\n457\n00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:42.140\nMost drivers are stored there,\nnot all drivers.\n\n458\n00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.725\nLet's see if this will have one that\nsome of the drivers are actually stored.\n\n459\n00:23:44.725 --> 00:23:46.792\nYep, okay, so WOW64, all right?\n\n460\n00:23:46.792 --> 00:23:51.050\nThis is a 32-bit subsystem that runs\non a 64-bit operating system, but.\n\n461\n00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:52.988\nWe can see, right?\n\n462\n00:23:52.988 --> 00:23:59.022\nThat we have\nC:\\Windows\\system32 \\DRIVER and\n\n463\n00:23:59.022 --> 00:24:04.928\nthe drivers that are part\nof this bundle if you will.\n\n464\n00:24:04.928 --> 00:24:07.860\nNow I want you to know that location.\n\n465\n00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.680\nThere is a reasons Zach and\nI took time to show you and\n\n466\n00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:14.610\nopen up File Explorer and show you\nwhere in the file hierarchy, right?\n\n467\n00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:16.025\nWhere that location is.\n\n468\n00:24:16.025 --> 00:24:18.100\nI'm not sure if they're gonna\nask you that on th exam.\n\n469\n00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:19.640\nBut even from a Help Desk standpoint,\n\n470\n00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:23.180\nit is good to know where\nthat driver location is.\n\n471\n00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:26.660\nAll right, and not only can we\nsee again who the provider is,\n\n472\n00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.570\nthe file version, but\nI can also see the digital signer.\n\n473\n00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:32.350\nRemember I told you\nthe Hardware Quality Labs?\n\n474\n00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:36.748\nWell, that's part of the Windows Hardware\ncompatibility in Microsoft.\n\n475\n00:24:36.748 --> 00:24:39.390\nWorking with VMware right?\n\n476\n00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:46.420\nAllows them to now have their\ndriver in the Windows update.\n\n477\n00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:47.970\nThey've signed it, they've said,\n\n478\n00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:52.780\nhey we sent this to the Windows Hardware\nQuality Labs and we stress tested it.\n\n479\n00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:56.970\nIt's stable, allows stable communication\nbetween the operating system and\n\n480\n00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:58.090\nour component.\n\n481\n00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:02.590\nWe'll sign it, we trust it, so that when\nyou download it, you know that its VMware.\n\n482\n00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:05.632\nBut you know we were the ones\nwho endorsed it, all right.\n\n483\n00:25:05.632 --> 00:25:07.320\nSo great thing to have there too.\n\n484\n00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:11.140\nSo know where some of those drivers are,\nthat is important.\n\n485\n00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:13.950\nNow, one of the last things I want\nto mention is connecting printers.\n\n486\n00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:16.560\nNow you can connect printers\nin a few different ways.\n\n487\n00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:19.511\nRight, we can have USB based printers and\n\n488\n00:25:19.511 --> 00:25:23.500\nyou just connect it right\ninto port on the device.\n\n489\n00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:26.530\nAnd you hope plug-and-play works,\ndoesn't always work.\n\n490\n00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:28.130\nBut the other thing that happens too is,\n\n491\n00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:30.940\nsometimes when you plug\nin USB on the printer, is\n\n492\n00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:35.140\na little storage space that actually has\nthe driver ready to go for you, all right?\n\n493\n00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.210\nThe other thing you can do is,\n\n494\n00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:38.730\nyou can actually connect to\nnetwork-based printers, too.\n\n495\n00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:39.780\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n496\n00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.191\nSo if we get down into\nour Windows settings,\n\n497\n00:25:42.191 --> 00:25:44.417\nright-click on our Windows icon here.\n\n498\n00:25:44.417 --> 00:25:48.460\nChoose Settings, and we get into devices.\n\n499\n00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:52.030\nYou'll notice that theres a section here\ncalled printers and scanners all right?\n\n500\n00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:54.870\nIf I go to printers and\nscanners these are the printers and\n\n501\n00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:57.640\nscanners that my computer\nis currently aware of.\n\n502\n00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.852\nNow these are actually virtual printers,\n\n503\n00:25:59.852 --> 00:26:01.590\nthis is what we call\na virtual printer right?\n\n504\n00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:06.030\nBecause print to PDF,\nyou're not actually printing anything.\n\n505\n00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:09.430\nWhat you're doing is saying, the text that\nI see in this file, convert it to a PDF.\n\n506\n00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:11.370\nThat's what a Print to PDF is.\n\n507\n00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:16.094\nAnd everybody's favorite file extension,\nXPS.\n\n508\n00:26:16.094 --> 00:26:19.899\nThat's Microsoft's not really replacement,\nbut\n\n509\n00:26:19.899 --> 00:26:23.710\nthat's their own proprietary,\nkind of like a PDF.\n\n510\n00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:26.373\nIt's not as popular as PDF, right?\n\n511\n00:26:26.373 --> 00:26:29.000\nBut these are virtual printers and\nthen you can see fax, right?\n\n512\n00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.990\nI'm not connected to a fax machine.\n\n513\n00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:35.730\nHowever, if I want to connect to a\nprinter, I can choose the add printers and\n\n514\n00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:36.300\nscanners.\n\n515\n00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:37.261\nAnd we can add a printer.\n\n516\n00:26:37.261 --> 00:26:42.607\nNow, one of the great things is If you\nadd the printer and your connected\n\n517\n00:26:42.607 --> 00:26:48.600\nto the the network, it will reach out and\nit will communicate with the network.\n\n518\n00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.490\nAnd it'd say, hey,\nare there any printers out there?\n\n519\n00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:54.240\nWell, I found a few, right?\n\n520\n00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:57.130\nAnd one of the great things is,\nis we can select it.\n\n521\n00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:58.970\nWe could choose add that device.\n\n522\n00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:00.500\nAnd remember I told you\nthat a lot of times,\n\n523\n00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:03.750\nthe modern printers have\ndrivers could on them already?\n\n524\n00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:07.360\nSo now what's happening is they are going\nthrough this communication process.\n\n525\n00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.690\nWhen my Windows operating system is\nconnecting out over the network,\n\n526\n00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:12.950\nIt's talking to the printer and\nsaying, hey, what are you?\n\n527\n00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:14.040\nI mean, I know you're a printer.\n\n528\n00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.676\nBut what are you?\n\n529\n00:27:15.676 --> 00:27:19.984\nAnd based on whatever the driver is, it's\neither downloading over the network a PCL,\n\n530\n00:27:19.984 --> 00:27:22.403\nprotocol control leg,\nwhich PPD driver, UPD,\n\n531\n00:27:22.403 --> 00:27:24.720\nall the different drivers\nthat are out there.\n\n532\n00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.240\nRaster Bit, Map Plot or vector,\n\n533\n00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:30.960\nand it's saying, let me go ahead,\nWindows I'll install this for you.\n\n534\n00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:36.700\nAnd now we're ready to print, just\nlike that, we can install the printer.\n\n535\n00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:41.700\nNow, we can also open the queue and manage\nyour printers from here here too, right.\n\n536\n00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:44.310\nSo if I'm sending a print\njob I can open the queue and\n\n537\n00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:47.790\nI can find out what the print job is,\nright?\n\n538\n00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:48.790\nWe can also manage it.\n\n539\n00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.950\nAnd here you can manage.\n\n540\n00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:53.330\nYou can print a test page, right?\n\n541\n00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:57.730\nWe can run a troubleshoot or we can manage\nthe print properties from here too, right?\n\n542\n00:27:57.730 --> 00:27:59.990\nSo is this a shared printer?\n\n543\n00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:02.510\nWell it is a shared resource,\nWe can control that.\n\n544\n00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:04.520\nWhat are the ports that are being used?\n\n545\n00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:09.834\nColor management and even some of\nthe basic device settings, all right?\n\n546\n00:28:09.834 --> 00:28:12.720\nSo, wait, it was printer control language.\n\n547\n00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.413\nI was just kinda guessing\nthere with the PCL.\n\n548\n00:28:14.413 --> 00:28:15.226\nBut it was PCL driver.\n\n549\n00:28:15.226 --> 00:28:18.093\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; l figured it was one of them, right?\n\n550\n00:28:18.093 --> 00:28:20.370\nAnd again, you can change\nthe different formats, right?\n\n551\n00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:23.120\nWhatever media type, so\nwe can manage the devices.\n\n552\n00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:26.920\nAnd, if this is a printer that you\naren't using anymore, well, that's okay.\n\n553\n00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:29.050\nYou can just select it and\nchoose remove the device.\n\n554\n00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:33.090\nAnd you confirm, and its gone, all right.\n\n555\n00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:36.870\nAnd it's just that simple when\nit comes to plugging in a USB\n\n556\n00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:40.260\ndevice based portal in or\nputting it over a wireless communication.\n\n557\n00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:44.280\nYou just have to make sure that you're\nconnected to the network, right?\n\n558\n00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.350\nAnd at the same time that\nthe portal's online, and\n\n559\n00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:48.760\nyou've got it configured that\nthey can communicate together.\n\n560\n00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.585\nBecause there are sometimes\nconfigurations that are vendor specific on\n\n561\n00:28:51.585 --> 00:28:52.331\nthe printer side.\n\n562\n00:28:52.331 --> 00:28:55.321\nBut at least from the windows\noperating system side you know,\n\n563\n00:28:55.321 --> 00:28:59.400\nhow we add a printer, how we would\nadd a scanner, be the same thing.\n\n564\n00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.620\nOr how we add and\nremove devices from our computers.\n\n565\n00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.050\nAlso remember AutoPlay.\n\n566\n00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:07.224\nAutoPlay is not expressily\ncalled out on the exam.\n\n567\n00:29:07.224 --> 00:29:09.339\nAnd I want to show you that one more time,\nright?\n\n568\n00:29:09.339 --> 00:29:15.130\nBecause if we look at,\nwe're over here at devices.\n\n569\n00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:16.470\nNotice AutoPlay here.\n\n570\n00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:21.420\nNow, when that USB device I connected\nto it, and I hit that little thought\n\n571\n00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:25.430\nbubble that it said, it brought up\na specific action for just that device.\n\n572\n00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:32.700\nIf you use AutoPlay here, right,\nit can set it more globally, right?\n\n573\n00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:35.125\nJust on a device by device basis rIght?\n\n574\n00:29:35.125 --> 00:29:37.770\nSo again, you can take no action.\n\n575\n00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:44.480\nWhen I put a memory card in, do I want to\nimport my videos up to One Drive, right?\n\n576\n00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.599\nCloud base solutions.\n\n577\n00:29:45.599 --> 00:29:51.616\nNow, I will say, depending on what your\nsecurity requirements are for your network\n\n578\n00:29:51.616 --> 00:29:56.718\nmight be whether you take no action,\nor you open the files to view them.\n\n579\n00:29:56.718 --> 00:30:00.866\nI typically, as you can see the removable\ndrive, I said take no action,\n\n580\n00:30:00.866 --> 00:30:03.560\nmemory card I'm also gonna take no action.\n\n581\n00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:07.368\nI don't want something automatically\nhappening, and again, that's just for\n\n582\n00:30:07.368 --> 00:30:10.336\nme for security purposes because\nI'm worried my tin foil hat.\n\n583\n00:30:10.336 --> 00:30:14.600\nWell, invisible tin foil hat that I wanna\nmake sure it's a little bit more secure.\n\n584\n00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:15.690\nSo that's up to you.\n\n585\n00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:19.350\nRemember in a home environment, maybe\nyou want to open up file explorer and\n\n586\n00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:22.460\nsee those files and folders right away\nthe moment you plug the device in.\n\n587\n00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:24.338\nThat's why they call\nit personal computing.\n\n588\n00:30:24.338 --> 00:30:26.340\nSo you can configure it what suits you.\n\n589\n00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:29.168\nKeep in mind some of the things that\nwe've talked about in this episode.\n\n590\n00:30:29.168 --> 00:30:31.836\nWhen it comes to understanding,\nconnecting, and\n\n591\n00:30:31.836 --> 00:30:36.080\ndisconnecting the different devices\nto your Windows operating system.\n\n592\n00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.160\n&gt;&gt; Another great episode, Wes.\n\n593\n00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.504\nUnderstanding and connecting devices, and\n\n594\n00:30:39.504 --> 00:30:42.470\nthat's within\nthe NTA Windows OS Fundamentals Series.\n\n595\n00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:45.422\nMake sure you see every single episode\nbecause Wes is doing a great job putting\n\n596\n00:30:45.422 --> 00:30:46.760\nall this together for you.\n\n597\n00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.573\nAnd you're the course library I'll bet and\n\n598\n00:30:48.573 --> 00:30:51.916\nthere's thousands of videos there to help\nyou go further so check those out too.\n\n599\n00:30:51.916 --> 00:30:54.087\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n600\n00:30:54.087 --> 00:30:55.840\nITProTV is binge worthy.\n\n601\n00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:56.550\nThanks for watching.\n\n602\n00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:57.390\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n603\n00:30:57.390 -->

00:00:11.791\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:13.105\n&gt;&gt; Hello, well thank you for\n\n5\n00:00:13.105 --> 00:00:17.030\nchoosing IT Pro.TV empowering\nthe world through engaging learning.\n\n6\n00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.554\nI'm your host Zach Memos for\nthis episode of MTA Windows.\n\n7\n00:00:20.554 --> 00:00:22.408\nAlways Fundamentals, Maintenance,\n\n8\n00:00:22.408 --> 00:00:24.830\nand Management Tools is\nthe title of this episode.\n\n9\n00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.390\nLet's find out more about that,\nshall we, with Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly,\nthanks for having me here.\n\n11\n00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.260\nThat's right, we're gonna be looking\nat some of the common utilities or\n\n12\n00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.120\ntools that we have to maintain our Windows\nenvironments, maintain and manage, right?\n\n13\n00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.240\nNow, understand that\nthroughout this course,\n\n14\n00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.400\nyou probably heard me say utilities,\ntools, right?\n\n15\n00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.440\nThey're pretty much synonymous, right?\n\n16\n00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.890\nThese are the applications that are built\ninto the operating system that we use\n\n17\n00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.280\nto maintain a level of stability within\nthe operating system and also configure\n\n18\n00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.800\nthat operating system environment\nthe way we need it to be configured.\n\n19\n00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.710\nSo let's go ahead and\nwe're going to dive right in.\n\n20\n00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.205\nAnd one of the very first ones that\nwe're gonna talk about it is called\n\n21\n00:01:04.205 --> 00:01:05.841\nthe disk defragmenter.\n\n22\n00:01:05.841 --> 00:01:11.100\nThe disk defragmenter is a very,\nvery utility in your operating system.\n\n23\n00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.600\n&gt;&gt; And\nI have a question right off the bat.\n\n24\n00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.430\nNow I'm familiar with disk defragmenters.\n\n25\n00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.746\nSo if there's a disk defragmenter\nis there a fragmenter?\n\n26\n00:01:18.746 --> 00:01:20.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What's the difference?\n\n27\n00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.080\nWhat are we doing, really?\n\n28\n00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.760\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yeah.\n\n29\n00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.060\nWell, file fragmentation, right?\n\n30\n00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.350\nThis can happen and it's just a natural\npart of the traditional mechanical drives.\n\n31\n00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.660\nAnd let me show you what I mean here.\n\n32\n00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.028\nI got a little diagram here.\n\n33\n00:01:33.028 --> 00:01:37.160\nWhen we first start storing\nfiles on a drive, all right?\n\n34\n00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.322\nI want you to think of that file cabinet\nwe've talked about in our episodes.\n\n35\n00:01:40.322 --> 00:01:42.030\nWe've talked about our file system, right?\n\n36\n00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:49.040\nAnd if I pull that drawer out of that\nfiling cabinet, and it's been maintained.\n\n37\n00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.200\nIt's in a nice,\n\n38\n00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.950\nclean contiguous state, that means that\nI have folders one after the other.\n\n39\n00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.290\nMaybe even hopefully\neverything alphabetized.\n\n40\n00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.220\nAnd I can get to everything really,\nreally easy.\n\n41\n00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.084\nNow over time, right?\n\n42\n00:02:03.084 --> 00:02:06.254\nWe need to do some spring cleaning\nbecause if we get in a hurry, right?\n\n43\n00:02:06.254 --> 00:02:09.800\nWe might grab folders, and\nwe might put folders in the wrong spot.\n\n44\n00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.053\nWe might take some files that\nare in those folders, right?\n\n45\n00:02:12.053 --> 00:02:13.820\nAnd move them to other locations.\n\n46\n00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.430\nAnd man, when we need all that\ndocumentation, we've gotta look all over\n\n47\n00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.120\nthe place to find the information\nthat it is we're looking for.\n\n48\n00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.950\nWell, when you first start storing\ninformation on hard disk drive,\n\n49\n00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.940\nyou store it in a nice contiguous fashion,\nright?\n\n50\n00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.830\nWe have file 1 here and\nit doesn't matter what the order,\n\n51\n00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.690\nthese are just for theory purpose,\nfor the concept here, we got File 1.\n\n52\n00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.020\nAnd it's contiguous to File 2,\nFile 3, and File 4, right?\n\n53\n00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.650\nThat's what we want.\n\n54\n00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.780\nThat's an ideal situation.\n\n55\n00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.380\nWell, anybody that's been in computing for\nany amount of time,\n\n56\n00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.980\neven if it's only a few months,\nknows that there's nothing\n\n57\n00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.700\nideal in a computing environment, [LAUGH]\nthat things always go wrong, right?\n\n58\n00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.197\nWell, what happens is over time you\nstart moving files around, all right?\n\n59\n00:02:54.197 --> 00:02:57.110\nYou start adding to files,\nyou start deleting files.\n\n60\n00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.876\nAnd now I want you to look at these\nfiles that we had before, all right?\n\n61\n00:02:59.876 --> 00:03:04.390\nAnd when I start storing these files,\nright, and maybe I shrink a file or\n\n62\n00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.100\nmaybe I add to a file.\n\n63\n00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.786\nWell, the drive controller doesn't put it,\nif you will, in a nice contiguous fashion.\n\n64\n00:03:12.786 --> 00:03:16.900\nIt puts it in the next empty space\non the hard drive, all right?\n\n65\n00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.490\nNow, that's where it's physically located.\n\n66\n00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.540\nNow, in the operating system, if I look\nat a file, well, I look at a file and\n\n67\n00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.720\nthen just looks like a single\nlocation to me, right?\n\n68\n00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.580\nBut at the physical level\non the hard drive itself,\n\n69\n00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.040\nthat file could have portions of it stored\nhere and portions of it store here.\n\n70\n00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.800\nNow the other thing that\nwe have is as we start to\n\n71\n00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.600\nlet's say our file originally was this\nsize and now the file's a little bit\n\n72\n00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.920\nsmaller well now what we end up having\nis fragmented free space, right?\n\n73\n00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.909\nAnd you might say well boy,\nwouldn't it be nice if it would just store\n\n74\n00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:55.743\nthe rest of that file in that\nfragmented space that is right there?\n\n75\n00:03:55.743 --> 00:03:57.650\nIt doesn't do that,\nunfortunately, all right?\n\n76\n00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.580\nAnd what we have to do is, it's kind\nof like a walkway, a path, right?\n\n77\n00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.860\nIf you think about it you've got pavers\nand they're one after the other and\n\n78\n00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.090\nyou're walking along that path,\nit's a nice easy stroll.\n\n79\n00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:15.715\nBut if I start eliminating some of\nthe areas in between, this walk away.\n\n80\n00:04:15.715 --> 00:04:18.910\nNow, in order for you to get cross that\npath, it's gonna start making some\n\n81\n00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.610\njumps and some lifts and\nthe search get a little bit difficult.\n\n82\n00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.260\nWell, that's the same thing that you're\ngonna do to your drive controller\n\n83\n00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.200\nwhen it doesn't just have to look\nin a single location for file but\n\n84\n00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.370\nit's spread out all over the hard drive,\nright?\n\n85\n00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.410\nIt's file fragmentation as\nwell as fragmented free space.\n\n86\n00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.670\nSo to answer your question now that\nwe know what fragmentation is,\n\n87\n00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.980\ndefragmentation like you mentioned there\nZach is just rearranging everything\n\n88\n00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.860\nin a nice, continuous fashion.\n\n89\n00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.040\nLet's take the portion of\nthe fragmented file and\n\n90\n00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.200\nlet's marry them or\nrejoin them back together.\n\n91\n00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.130\nLet's take the fragmented free space and\n\n92\n00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.550\nlet's put that in a nice\ncontinuous fashion.\n\n93\n00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.750\nNow, our filing cabinet, or the shelf\nwithin the filing cabinet's nice and\n\n94\n00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.730\neasy to look through all the folders, see\nyour files in that nice contiguous space.\n\n95\n00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.250\nAnd we don't have to work so hard.\n\n96\n00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.177\nNow, the analogy, we would be like\nthe drive controller, all right?\n\n97\n00:05:08.177 --> 00:05:10.309\nWe see the file in a single location, but\n\n98\n00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:14.452\nthe drive controller knows that it's\ngotta find portions of that file all over\n\n99\n00:05:14.452 --> 00:05:18.110\nthe physical drive and\nit can start to hinder performance, right?\n\n100\n00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.644\nSo that's what file fragmentation is.\n\n101\n00:05:20.644 --> 00:05:23.793\nI'm gonna get on my\nWindows 8 machine here and\n\n102\n00:05:23.793 --> 00:05:28.410\nlet's show you how you would\ndefragment a drive, right?\n\n103\n00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:35.230\nNow in your MTA exam objectives,\nyou're gonna see a disk defragmentation.\n\n104\n00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.430\nIt was called the disc\ndefragmenter up until Windows 8.\n\n105\n00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.910\nThey renamed it,\nit's the Drive Optimizer, all right?\n\n106\n00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.190\nAnd let me show you what I mean.\n\n107\n00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:52.620\nIf I right click on my Windows charm\n&gt; Control Panel System and security.\n\n108\n00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.994\nAnd we scroll down to Administrative\nTools, imagine that, administrative tools,\n\n109\n00:05:57.994 --> 00:06:02.935\nyou're gonna see that there's\nthe Defragment and Optimize Drives, right?\n\n110\n00:06:02.935 --> 00:06:06.072\nNow notice what it talks about\nif I do a little hover and\n\n111\n00:06:06.072 --> 00:06:09.640\ndiscover, optimizes files and\nfragments on your volumes.\n\n112\n00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.020\nLet me see if I can\nthat to come back up so\n\n113\n00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.770\nthat your computer runs\na little bit faster, right?\n\n114\n00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.060\nAnd, that's important, that's why we\nwant to do the optimization, right?\n\n115\n00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.490\nMore efficient, or,\nyeah, more efficiently.\n\n116\n00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.620\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's bring up this drive, right?\n\n117\n00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.431\nAll right so you see we've got C:, right?\n\n118\n00:06:30.431 --> 00:06:34.230\nAnd we also have another drive in here.\n\n119\n00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:35.820\nAnd notice something.\n\n120\n00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.072\nNow, this is telling me that it's\n100% space efficiency, right?\n\n121\n00:06:40.072 --> 00:06:43.935\nBut we're gonna pretend that\nit's fragmented, right?\n\n122\n00:06:43.935 --> 00:06:46.331\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And then we have a couple other drives\n\n123\n00:06:46.331 --> 00:06:50.340\nhere too and you'll notice what\nthey say next to them, likewise.\n\n124\n00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.770\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nlet's do an analyze.\n\n125\n00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.930\nNow, in earlier days,\n\n126\n00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.800\nand it didn't take that long because\nit's already at 100% efficiency.\n\n127\n00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.640\nIn earlier days, you'd actually see\nwhat this defragmenter was doing.\n\n128\n00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.304\nYou'd start to see the little\ndots as it would find the files?\n\n129\n00:07:08.304 --> 00:07:08.907\n&gt;&gt; I remember that.\n\n130\n00:07:08.907 --> 00:07:10.520\n&gt;&gt; You remember that?\nAnd it would rearrange it.\n\n131\n00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.850\nThey basically said in Windows 8 and\n\n132\n00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.840\non you don't really need\nto see all the graphics.\n\n133\n00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.970\nWe'll just take care of it for you and you\ncan just go on about your business, right?\n\n134\n00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.720\nAnd then once it analyzes,\n\n135\n00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.140\nit'll tell you if it needs to\nbe optimized or not, all right?\n\n136\n00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.820\nAnd you notice that it's\ntelling us we're okay but\n\n137\n00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.470\nwe could optimize this and\nit's not really gonna\n\n138\n00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:38.010\nanalyze it like it needs to because\nagain it's already 100% efficient.\n\n139\n00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:40.950\nNow you can also,\nnot only do the defragmentation,\n\n140\n00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:44.410\nbut you can also do the scheduling\nhere in the defragmenter, right?\n\n141\n00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:48.480\nNow I want you to notice something,\nthis is the defaults,\n\n142\n00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.610\nI haven't changed anything here.\n\n143\n00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.676\nAnd for the longest time, all right?\n\n144\n00:07:53.676 --> 00:07:58.986\nAnd I wanna say that this came out,\nif I'm not mistaken, in Windows Vista.\n\n145\n00:07:58.986 --> 00:08:03.072\nOnce we got out of XP, we moved into\nWindows Vista, they said, you know what?\n\n146\n00:08:03.072 --> 00:08:08.680\nA lot of people don't remember to do the\ndrive, the disk defragmentation, right.\n\n147\n00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.400\nThey just walk away from it,\nthey don't even do it.\n\n148\n00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.830\nSo you know what we're gonna do?\n\n149\n00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:13.762\nWe're gonna go ahead and\n\n150\n00:08:13.762 --> 00:08:17.745\nwe're gonna set it on a schedule for\nyou to happen automatically.\n\n151\n00:08:17.745 --> 00:08:20.175\nAnd that's what it is,\nit's scheduled out to run.\n\n152\n00:08:20.175 --> 00:08:22.215\nAnd you can see weekly, all right?\n\n153\n00:08:22.215 --> 00:08:24.515\nAnd it will give you a notice,\n\n154\n00:08:24.515 --> 00:08:28.435\nif three consecutive schedules\nruns are missed, all right.\n\n155\n00:08:28.435 --> 00:08:31.595\nNow you can also say that, you know what?\n\n156\n00:08:31.595 --> 00:08:33.475\nI'm gonna do this myself, right?\n\n157\n00:08:33.475 --> 00:08:35.825\nMaybe weekly is too much, I don't know.\n\n158\n00:08:35.825 --> 00:08:37.920\nIt depends on how much you\nuse your drives, right?\n\n159\n00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.040\nYou might say, I wanna do this monthly.\n\n160\n00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.270\nThen you can get a little bit more\ngranular and you could actually tell it,\n\n161\n00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:47.750\nwhich drives do I want to optimize?\n\n162\n00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.510\nNow it is interesting though,\n\n163\n00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.360\nwe've got some check marks\non C in the system reserve.\n\n164\n00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.500\nBut I want you to pay attention\nto something here, all right?\n\n165\n00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.130\nNotice that it tells me that\noptimization isn't available.\n\n166\n00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:02.970\nAnd one of the reasons that optimization\nisn't available is because on solid-state\n\n167\n00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.400\ndrives, they don't work like\ntraditional mechanical drives.\n\n168\n00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:11.210\nAnd because of that, you don't need to run\nthe disk defragmenter on them, all right?\n\n169\n00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:14.140\n&gt;&gt; So there's no reason for\nyou to try to reactivate it?\n\n170\n00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:18.690\n&gt;&gt; No, no, and that's because of\nthe way that solid state drives work.\n\n171\n00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:22.400\nSolid state drives work differently than\ntraditional spinning mechanical drives.\n\n172\n00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.000\nSpinning mechanical drives\nare the ones that can\n\n173\n00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.020\nfragment the files all over the place,\nright?\n\n174\n00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.440\nThere are other ways that you manage and\nmaintain a solid state drive.\n\n175\n00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.010\nAnd that's, I believe,\nbeyond the scope of this exam, right?\n\n176\n00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.700\nWe have to do things like [INAUDIBLE]\ndrive alignments and stuff, and\n\n177\n00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:40.410\nWindows support, something known\nas TRIM and garbage collection.\n\n178\n00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:44.512\nAgain, a little bit different on\nhow the solid state drives work, so\n\n179\n00:09:44.512 --> 00:09:47.850\noptimization and\ndefragmentation isn't necessary.\n\n180\n00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:53.010\nAnd that's why Windows is saying,\nI recognize that, that's an SSD.\n\n181\n00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:56.628\nThat SSD doesn't require optimization,\nhence it's not available.\n\n182\n00:09:56.628 --> 00:09:59.922\n[CROSSTALK] Actually, cuz what would\nhappen, it's kind of interesting.\n\n183\n00:09:59.922 --> 00:10:02.687\n[LAUGH] They say Optimize Drives.\n\n184\n00:10:02.687 --> 00:10:06.128\nIf you were to try to do\na defragmentation on a solid state drive,\n\n185\n00:10:06.128 --> 00:10:08.970\nyou'd actually decrease its performance.\n\n186\n00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.740\nBecause the more rights you\ndo to a solid state drive,\n\n187\n00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:15.120\nit starts to decrease its lifecycle and\nits performance over time.\n\n188\n00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.880\nSo actually, it's counterintuitive\nwhen it comes to solid state drives.\n\n189\n00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:23.220\nAll right, so that's a little bit\nabout our disk defragmenter, so\n\n190\n00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.530\nbe aware of that.\n\n191\n00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:29.450\nNow we've also talked about another\nutility inside of Windows as well.\n\n192\n00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:34.330\nAnd let me show you how to get there,\nif I open up File Explorer, all right.\n\n193\n00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:39.258\nAnd over here in the navigation pane or\nsometimes called the Explorer pane,\n\n194\n00:10:39.258 --> 00:10:42.630\nI'm gonna to go ahead and\nI'm gonna select ThisPC.\n\n195\n00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:46.680\nBecause what I wanna do is, I wanna\nsee the drives that I have available.\n\n196\n00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.971\nAll right, so\nnotice that I have local disk C, and\n\n197\n00:10:48.971 --> 00:10:50.632\nI've got local disk in this case L.\n\n198\n00:10:50.632 --> 00:10:56.290\nI'm gonna go ahead and right click and\nI'm gonna to choose Properties, all right?\n\n199\n00:10:56.290 --> 00:11:00.320\nNow from Properties,\nI can also get to the Optimize and\n\n200\n00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.700\ndefragment drives, right there.\n\n201\n00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.860\nAs well as,\nnotice that from the General tab, and\n\n202\n00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.670\nwe kinda mentioned this\nin another episode.\n\n203\n00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:10.190\nI have what's known as Disk Cleanup here.\n\n204\n00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:13.900\nWhen we look at Disk Cleanup,\nyou have a lot of temporary files.\n\n205\n00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:17.580\nThings like log files that applications,\nduring the process of installing,\n\n206\n00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.900\nthey write to a log and\nthen you never use that log again.\n\n207\n00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:24.570\nAnd the application maybe leaves that log\nbehind for debugging or something, but\n\n208\n00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:25.190\nyou don't need it.\n\n209\n00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:29.040\nTemporary Internet files,\nwhen you install updates,\n\n210\n00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.840\nupdates have temporary\nfiles that are stored.\n\n211\n00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.430\nYour user profile has your\nown temporary files stored,\n\n212\n00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:37.608\na lot of extra stuff that you\njust don't need on your drive.\n\n213\n00:11:37.608 --> 00:11:39.470\nSo you wanna maintain them and\n\n214\n00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.910\nyou wanna make sure that they're\na little bit more efficient.\n\n215\n00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:45.220\nSo what we can do here is\nwe can choose Disk Cleanup.\n\n216\n00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.390\nAnd Disk Cleanup can take a while.\n\n217\n00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:50.910\nIn fact, first thing it does,\n\n218\n00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:53.950\nis it basically calculates how\nmuch space you'll be able free.\n\n219\n00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.510\nSo it's going through these areas,\nyou can see memory dump files.\n\n220\n00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:58.540\nDump files, by the way,\nif you ever get a blue screen,\n\n221\n00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.680\nwhat happens is Windows takes\nthe entire contents of your RAM and\n\n222\n00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.935\nputs it in a file, and\nstores it on the hard drive.\n\n223\n00:12:03.935 --> 00:12:06.210\nIt's why it's called a memory dump,\nif you will.\n\n224\n00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:08.710\nThat's why they call them dump files,\nall right.\n\n225\n00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:11.440\nAnd what it does is it goes through and\nit calculates\n\n226\n00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.300\nall of these locations I was telling you,\nand the files that are contained there.\n\n227\n00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:20.120\nAnd it's gonna give you a report back\nthat says, this is how much we found.\n\n228\n00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:25.340\nThese are the locations that we found\nit in, as well as when you say how\n\n229\n00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:31.550\nmuch we found, this is how much it's going\nto free up once this finishes running.\n\n230\n00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:34.780\nNow you can see, again, you can see\nsome of the additional settings here.\n\n231\n00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.729\nFor instance, Window Update Cleanup, and\n\n232\n00:12:36.729 --> 00:12:38.844\nthis one might actually\ntake a good long while.\n\n233\n00:12:38.844 --> 00:12:42.940\nAnd in fact, it might take so long that we\nwon't have enough time in this episode.\n\n234\n00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:46.248\nSo what I'm gonna go ahead and do is I'm\ngonna run, I want this to go ahead and\n\n235\n00:12:46.248 --> 00:12:47.509\nrun here in the background.\n\n236\n00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:51.005\nAnd then what we're gonna do\nis while this is running,\n\n237\n00:12:51.005 --> 00:12:53.970\nI wanna come back to it, could take a bit.\n\n238\n00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:57.890\nAnd I want to show you the next piece\nof software that we're gonna run.\n\n239\n00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:00.160\nAnd that's something known\nas the Task Scheduler.\n\n240\n00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.361\nWe kinda talked about our\nadministrative tools.\n\n241\n00:13:02.361 --> 00:13:04.700\nWe just briefly mentioned\nabout Task Scheduler.\n\n242\n00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:08.250\nBut I told you, another episode\nwe were gonna talk about it.\n\n243\n00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:09.590\nWell, that's this episode right here.\n\n244\n00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:14.350\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's let Windows Update finish running.\n\n245\n00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:16.372\nI'm gonna come over to\nWindows 10 machine and\n\n246\n00:13:16.372 --> 00:13:18.860\nwe're gonna dive down\ninto Computer Management.\n\n247\n00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:21.640\nAnd we'll look at the Task Scheduler.\n\n248\n00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.490\nSo if I right click on\nmy Windows icon here and\n\n249\n00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:28.830\nI choose Computer Management, that brings\nup our Computer Management console.\n\n250\n00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:31.420\nAnd again, the interface is\npretty much the same through\n\n251\n00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.110\nall of the Window operating systems.\n\n252\n00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:35.550\nSo if you know it here,\nyou'll know it in Windows 7.\n\n253\n00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.160\nYou'll know it in Windows 8.1 as well.\n\n254\n00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.040\nAnd remember, Task Scheduler gives me the\nability to automate some of the day-to-day\n\n255\n00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:47.010\ntasks that I don't wanna have to\nmanually input myself, all right?\n\n256\n00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:49.848\nNow, this can get very, very complex.\n\n257\n00:13:49.848 --> 00:13:52.940\nYou can do a lot of things\nwith Task Schedule.\n\n258\n00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:56.400\nIn fact, so much so that it's well\nbeyond the scope of this exam.\n\n259\n00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:00.511\nBut I do wanna show you how it works,\nhow to create a basic task.\n\n260\n00:14:00.511 --> 00:14:03.582\nAnd then we can do that while we're\nwaiting on Disk Cleanup to do its job\n\n261\n00:14:03.582 --> 00:14:05.770\nover there on the Windows 8 machine.\n\n262\n00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:06.980\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n263\n00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.490\nAnd from the action pane here,\n\n264\n00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:12.910\nwe're gonna create a basic task\nin Task Scheduler, all right?\n\n265\n00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:15.220\nNow when we do that,\nwe're gonna name this task.\n\n266\n00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:19.870\nAnd I'm gonna say, I'm gonna call\nthis one, I'll tell you what.\n\n267\n00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:25.190\nLaunch Internet Explorer, right,\nbecause I need that automated.\n\n268\n00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:33.260\nAnd we'll put a generic description here,\nif you will, Launches the Web Browser.\n\n269\n00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.820\nAgain, this is just arbitrary here.\n\n270\n00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.010\nIt's for\nidentification purposes on your end.\n\n271\n00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:40.590\nWe'll choose Next.\n\n272\n00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:45.000\nAnd then we get to, hey,\nhow much automation do we need?\n\n273\n00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.040\nDo we need this daily, weekly,\nmonthly, we need it to do one time?\n\n274\n00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.970\nAnd maybe it's Disk Cleanup,\nautomate Disk Cleanup.\n\n275\n00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:53.990\nI want it to run one time and\nthat's all I want it to run.\n\n276\n00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:56.820\nMaybe I want it to run weekly, all right?\n\n277\n00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:59.102\nOr I can use something like when I log on.\n\n278\n00:14:59.102 --> 00:15:03.602\nMaybe it's the trigger event, and\nI'll show you what I mean by the trigger,\n\n279\n00:15:03.602 --> 00:15:05.840\nis the moment I log onto the computer.\n\n280\n00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.138\nSo let's go ahead and we'll choose Next.\n\n281\n00:15:08.138 --> 00:15:11.100\nAnd I'm gonna choose,\ndo we wanna send an email?\n\n282\n00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.660\nAnd you can see these are kind\nof gone by the wayside\n\n283\n00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.580\nbased on the deprecation of these.\n\n284\n00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:18.860\nOr start a program, right,\nI wanna start a program.\n\n285\n00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:23.320\nNow it's gonna ask me, where are the\nprograms and do I wanna add any arguments?\n\n286\n00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.620\nDo I wanna start this in context?\n\n287\n00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.470\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and\nwe're gonna choose Browse.\n\n288\n00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:33.490\nAnd then from here,\nI'm gonna go ahead and let's dive down to\n\n289\n00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:38.530\nwhere our Internet Explorer is.\n\n290\n00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:42.030\nAll right, we'll do Program Files\n(x86) &gt; Internet Explorer.\n\n291\n00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:45.100\nAnd you guys, I encourage you,\nuse our practice labs, right?\n\n292\n00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:48.550\nGet down in here and\nwork with this utility.\n\n293\n00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:51.710\nAll right, and iexplore is\nactually the application there.\n\n294\n00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:52.448\nYou can see Application.\n\n295\n00:15:52.448 --> 00:15:55.626\nThis is the application,\nthe EXE if you will,\n\n296\n00:15:55.626 --> 00:15:58.981\nthat actually launches\nour Internet Explorer.\n\n297\n00:15:58.981 --> 00:16:00.884\nAnd I'm gonna ahead and chose Open.\n\n298\n00:16:00.884 --> 00:16:04.111\nAll right, and\nthen we'll go ahead and choose Next.\n\n299\n00:16:04.111 --> 00:16:09.075\nAnd then from here notice it asks me\nto open the Properties dialogue box for\n\n300\n00:16:09.075 --> 00:16:11.560\nthis task when I click Finish.\n\n301\n00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.660\nYou don't have to do that, but\n\n302\n00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:15.680\nI wanna do that cuz I wanna show\nyou some of the properties here.\n\n303\n00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:20.070\nAll right, let's go ahead and choose\nFinish, and here are the properties.\n\n304\n00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:24.330\nAll right, so what is it called,\nwho is the author, the user,\n\n305\n00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:26.940\nthe context that it's gonna run in,\nall right?\n\n306\n00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.070\nAnd security options, right.\n\n307\n00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:33.290\nIt asks me,\nrun only when the user is logged in.\n\n308\n00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:37.080\nWell that is something that\nI would probably want here.\n\n309\n00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:42.810\nTrigger at log on,\nat the log on of my specific user account.\n\n310\n00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:44.220\nActions, what to you wanna do?\n\n311\n00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.930\nWell, I wanna start a program.\n\n312\n00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:49.200\nAnd the program is located in this area.\n\n313\n00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:53.560\nConditions, now,\nI can actually stop these tasks, too.\n\n314\n00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:57.320\nBecause maybe if they've got a lot\nof computational power behind them,\n\n315\n00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:01.880\nyou probably don't want them consistently\nrunning, because you're wasting resources\n\n316\n00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:06.140\nthat you could probably use in some\nline of business productivity suite.\n\n317\n00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.320\nAnd then the settings,\nnotice that you can,\n\n318\n00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.940\nthere's a series of settings\nthat you can do here as well.\n\n319\n00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.760\nNotice you can have a response for\n\n320\n00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:19.790\nif the task fails as well as\nthe history behind that task.\n\n321\n00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:23.420\nNow this one takes a little bit to load,\nbut there we go.\n\n322\n00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:27.400\nSo it gives us an information level event,\nbut I could also find it in event viewer\n\n323\n00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.310\ntoo, and\nit tells me that the task is triggered.\n\n324\n00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:33.680\nAll right, let's go ahead and say okay to\nthat, and we're gonna close this down.\n\n325\n00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:38.530\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna log out of this machine.\n\n326\n00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:40.402\nCuz remember, it was when I log on, right?\n\n327\n00:17:40.402 --> 00:17:41.010\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n328\n00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:44.940\nthen let's switch back over to\nour Windows 8.1 machine, and\n\n329\n00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:48.542\nwe'll keep you waiting to see\nthe task scheduler, all right?\n\n330\n00:17:48.542 --> 00:17:49.054\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n331\n00:17:49.054 --> 00:17:50.794\n&gt;&gt; Notice that it is found.\n\n332\n00:17:50.794 --> 00:17:53.770\nOur Windows, or Disk Cleanup,\n\n333\n00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:57.940\nhas found a few things that\nit can clean up, all right?\n\n334\n00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.721\nAnd it didn't find a lot of\nstuff here which is good,\n\n335\n00:18:00.721 --> 00:18:02.945\nbecause I don't want it to take forever.\n\n336\n00:18:02.945 --> 00:18:06.085\nBut I could go through and\nI could select the things that I want,\n\n337\n00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:08.760\nif not all of the things that\nI want to delete, right?\n\n338\n00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.695\nSo I could say, Windows Defender,\na lot of times what I do is,\n\n339\n00:18:12.695 --> 00:18:16.256\nI will delete everything,\nbut for time purposes here,\n\n340\n00:18:16.256 --> 00:18:19.715\nI don't wanna do that because\nit could take forever.\n\n341\n00:18:19.715 --> 00:18:21.260\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; I also wanna make mention\n\n342\n00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.440\nof the fact that you have\nsome additional options, too.\n\n343\n00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.990\nNotice it says you\n\n344\n00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:30.390\ncan free more disk space by removing\nprograms that you don't use.\n\n345\n00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:32.260\nSo, if I've got anything installed.\n\n346\n00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.620\nAs well as things like\nSystem Restore points.\n\n347\n00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:38.120\nI don't wanna do that, we'll talk about\nSystem Restore in another episode.\n\n348\n00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.370\nAs well as shadow copies,\nI don't wanna do that.\n\n349\n00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:44.789\nBut you do have the ability to get\na little bit more granular if you want.\n\n350\n00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:47.146\nBut well go ahead and we'll just say OK.\n\n351\n00:18:47.146 --> 00:18:51.960\nAnd now it's gonna ask me, are you sure\nyou wanna permanently delete these files?\n\n352\n00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.750\nAnd we'll go ahead and choose Yes, and\nwe'll give that a few to go ahead and\n\n353\n00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:56.420\ndo its thing.\n\n354\n00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:59.670\nIt might not take as long as it did to\ncalculate it, but sometimes it can,\n\n355\n00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:00.860\nall right?\n\n356\n00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:04.220\nAnd now that that's gone,\nwe're moving this clean up along here.\n\n357\n00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:08.740\nLet's go ahead and jump back over and\nsee if that task has truly been scheduled.\n\n358\n00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:09.530\nI love this stuff.\n\n359\n00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:11.140\nI don't know about you guys.\n\n360\n00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:14.010\n&gt;&gt; Back in the old days this\nclean up could take all night.\n\n361\n00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:15.880\nI remember running things all night long.\n\n362\n00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and you know what Zach,\nhistory repeats itself.\n\n363\n00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:19.630\nWhy?\nBecause we\n\n364\n00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:24.460\nhave drives that are terabytes in size and\nif you have terabyte size drives.\n\n365\n00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.150\nYou're right.\nYou're probably in for\n\n366\n00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:27.970\na long night if you have to stay with it.\n\n367\n00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:31.210\nIf not, go to sleep, get rest, wake up in\nthe morning, grab you some coffee, and\n\n368\n00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:32.680\ncome back to it, right?\n\n369\n00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:33.620\nSo let's go ahead.\n\n370\n00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:36.560\nRemember the trigger event was,\nZach, was was when I log on.\n\n371\n00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:37.090\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n372\n00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:39.130\nwe'll go ahead and we'll do exactly that.\n\n373\n00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:44.260\nWe're gonna log on here and we'll hope,\nwe'll hope, fingers crossed,\n\n374\n00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.560\nthat we're gonna see\nInternet Explorer launch up, right?\n\n375\n00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.940\nUp, and there we go.\n\n376\n00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:51.590\nSo task right you can automate\nyour basic day to day tasks right?\n\n377\n00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:54.440\nFor me I just happen to\ndo an executable here,\n\n378\n00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.770\nwhich we commonly know and\nit's Internet Explorer here and\n\n379\n00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:00.425\nit's gonna take a little bit here\nto launch that up but there we go.\n\n380\n00:20:00.425 --> 00:20:04.725\nSo that's a little bit about how you\nwould operate your Task Scheduler.\n\n381\n00:20:04.725 --> 00:20:06.925\nThat was a very basic task.\n\n382\n00:20:06.925 --> 00:20:09.145\nKeep in mind you can get very complex.\n\n383\n00:20:09.145 --> 00:20:10.295\nI've done things like for\n\n384\n00:20:10.295 --> 00:20:15.920\ninstance from one of my machines I set\na task To run a wake on lan packet.\n\n385\n00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.740\nAnd send it across the network\nto another server.\n\n386\n00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.910\nTo actually wake it up from a sleep\nstate to do a recording for me.\n\n387\n00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:23.330\nAnd then on that same server,\n\n388\n00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:26.860\nI did a task that would shut it down\nright after the recording was finished.\n\n389\n00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:28.580\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; So you walk away from it.\n\n390\n00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:30.250\nAnd your whole network is doing things and\n\n391\n00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:33.200\nyou don't have to worry about\nthe hands-on approach, right?\n\n392\n00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.900\nI still like the hands-on approach too,\nbut this was really good,\n\n393\n00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.390\nbecause as I've joked around.\n\n394\n00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:40.360\nAnd Zach,\nyou could probably attest to this too.\n\n395\n00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.900\nI forget my head if it wasn't\nattached with the neck and\n\n396\n00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:47.540\nI can never remember to be home at this\nright time to do that recording and\n\n397\n00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:50.190\nwell now you can do the task scheduler.\n\n398\n00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:51.280\nYou can automate the process.\n\n399\n00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.500\nSet it and forget it.\n\n400\n00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.365\nAnd now I don't have to worry\nabout forgetting my neck.\n\n401\n00:20:54.365 --> 00:20:56.657\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're very big on scheduling.\n\n402\n00:20:56.657 --> 00:20:57.517\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nDefinitely.\n\n403\n00:20:57.517 --> 00:20:58.812\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; Schedules all the way.\n\n404\n00:20:58.812 --> 00:20:59.370\nAll right?\n\n405\n00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:03.310\nSo, I tell you what Let's see if\nthe turkey is done, all right?\n\n406\n00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:07.390\nLet's go back over to a disk clean up and\nthere it is.\n\n407\n00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:08.600\nWe're good, right?\n\n408\n00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.980\nOnce that little dialogue box\ngets done the second time,\n\n409\n00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:13.400\nit just closed down like you can see.\n\n410\n00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.890\nSo it's, nothing really to see there,\nall right.\n\n411\n00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:18.960\nSo that's a little bit about\nthe task scheduler, all right.\n\n412\n00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.470\nNow we do have a couple of other\nutilities that we wanna talk about.\n\n413\n00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:25.130\nWhat we wanna talk about something\nknow as system information.\n\n414\n00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:28.140\nNow System Information is actually\nseen in a couple of different ways.\n\n415\n00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:31.250\nYou can actually launch it up\na couple of different ways.\n\n416\n00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:34.670\nI do want you to be aware of the two\ndifferent names that it's called.\n\n417\n00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:37.460\nSometimes it's just called msinfo32, and\n\n418\n00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:41.850\nthat's been an old way to launch it for\na while.\n\n419\n00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:42.830\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n420\n00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:46.480\nIf I get down to, and\nin fact we can do this from the modern UI.\n\n421\n00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:50.160\nAnd if I type in msinfo32,\n\n422\n00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.770\nyou'll see here I've got this executable,\nmsinfo32.\n\n423\n00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:58.020\nI'll come back to that in a second, cuz I\nwanna show you the other way to get it.\n\n424\n00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:01.180\nCuz we've also talked about our\nadministrative tools in other episodes.\n\n425\n00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:05.850\nAnd again, it's one of those ones where\nI say, we'll talk about that more later.\n\n426\n00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:08.771\nWell, that later is now,\nso we'll live in the now.\n\n427\n00:22:08.771 --> 00:22:10.058\n[LAUGH] Let's go ahead, and\n\n428\n00:22:10.058 --> 00:22:12.992\nwhat we'll do is we'll right click\non our little Windows charm here.\n\n429\n00:22:12.992 --> 00:22:15.070\nWe'll go to our Control Panel.\n\n430\n00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:21.550\nAll right, and then from here, System and\nSecurity &gt; Administrative Tools.\n\n431\n00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:24.450\nAnd if I scroll down,\nabout almost all the way to the bottom,\n\n432\n00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:26.700\nI'll see system information, right?\n\n433\n00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:30.210\nNotice system information, and\nnotice what it looks like, all right.\n\n434\n00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:31.130\nNow, we're gonna come back to it.\n\n435\n00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:33.870\nI don't wanna say, hey,\nthat system information, moving on.\n\n436\n00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:34.930\nWe'll come back to it.\n\n437\n00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:38.830\nCuz I wanna show you, that if I\nalso do this from the modern UI, or\n\n438\n00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:44.000\nin fact not only from the modern UI,\nfrom any traditional runline, right?\n\n439\n00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:51.830\nI can do MSinfo32.exe, and\nwhen I run that, notice what comes up.\n\n440\n00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:53.137\nSame exact utility.\n\n441\n00:22:53.137 --> 00:22:53.865\nI mean, they're no different, right.\n\n442\n00:22:53.865 --> 00:22:58.554\nMsinfo32.exe is the executable,\nif you follow me on this one,\n\n443\n00:22:58.554 --> 00:23:02.420\nis the executable that\nlaunches system information.\n\n444\n00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.830\nThey're one and the same.\n\n445\n00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:07.480\nAll right, now once I'm here,\nsystem information is great.\n\n446\n00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.750\nIn fact, we were using this.\n\n447\n00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:12.760\nOne of our other host, Cherokee, had\na issue with the firmware on her Windows\n\n448\n00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:18.560\nmachine, and she wanted to make sure if\nthe firmware was current and up to date.\n\n449\n00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:19.680\nSo what did she do?\n\n450\n00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:24.960\nShe came in here, she launched\nthe system information utility.\n\n451\n00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.570\nAnd came in and wanted to find\nout what's the processor right?\n\n452\n00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:31.210\nWhat's the BIOS version\nthe firmware right?\n\n453\n00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:33.090\nWell I can see what the data is right?\n\n454\n00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:36.600\nI can see that this is 5/19/2017 so\nit's a Phoenix.\n\n455\n00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.895\nIt's a Phoenix.\n\n456\n00:23:37.895 --> 00:23:39.615\nBIOS, and it's not that old.\n\n457\n00:23:39.615 --> 00:23:43.581\nThat's a great thing to have,\nI tell you, rather than having to\n\n458\n00:23:43.581 --> 00:23:48.209\nshut the computer down, open the case,\nfind out what the mother board is,\n\n459\n00:23:48.209 --> 00:23:51.381\nand then plug in the model\nof the motherboard, no.\n\n460\n00:23:51.381 --> 00:23:55.370\nI can launch up system information and\nI can find that information for\n\n461\n00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:56.761\nme right away, right?\n\n462\n00:23:56.761 --> 00:24:01.188\nIf I need to find out If this\nplatform supports things like\n\n463\n00:24:01.188 --> 00:24:04.520\nthe UEFI secure-boot, how do I know?\n\n464\n00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.400\nI don't know.\n\n465\n00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.790\nI could boot into the BIOS.\n\n466\n00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:08.535\nI could restart the machine,\nboot into BIOS, and\n\n467\n00:24:08.535 --> 00:24:10.207\nthen figure out if that\nsetting's available.\n\n468\n00:24:10.207 --> 00:24:17.220\nOr I could just launch up\nhere our system information.\n\n469\n00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:21.390\nAnd in here, there is a, wait for it.\n\n470\n00:24:23.499 --> 00:24:24.740\nThere we go, secure boot.\n\n471\n00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.470\nIt's not supported, right?\n\n472\n00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:28.300\nSo we have this in a legacy mode.\n\n473\n00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:29.700\nSo it's not supported in the UEFI.\n\n474\n00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:31.290\nThat might be something important,\n\n475\n00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:33.450\nespecially if we're talking\nabout a security concept.\n\n476\n00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:34.276\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Does this\n\n477\n00:24:34.276 --> 00:24:36.245\nplatform support virtualization?\n\n478\n00:24:37.792 --> 00:24:39.174\nAll right, well, it's telling me.\n\n479\n00:24:41.936 --> 00:24:48.020\nAnd let me see if I can, all right, notice\nthis a hypervisor has been detected.\n\n480\n00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:52.270\nFeatures required for\nHyper-V will not be displayed, all right?\n\n481\n00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:54.240\nI'm already running this on a hypervisor.\n\n482\n00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.460\nI can't turn around and put Hyper-V under\nit and run it in nested virtualization.\n\n483\n00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:59.910\nDon't worry about that for\nthis exam, it's not available.\n\n484\n00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:01.330\nBut now I know that, right?\n\n485\n00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:03.050\nI wouldn't have known that before.\n\n486\n00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:03.800\nHere's other things, too.\n\n487\n00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.089\nHardware resources.\n\n488\n00:25:05.089 --> 00:25:06.193\nAnd we're gonna talk about the,\n\n489\n00:25:06.193 --> 00:25:07.969\nhere's where I get to tell\nyou a little cliffhanger,\n\n490\n00:25:07.969 --> 00:25:09.840\nwe're gonna talk about\nresources in another episode.\n\n491\n00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.780\nBut I can at least see them right\nhere with system information.\n\n492\n00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:15.850\nWhich is why I tell you,\nwe might end up launching\n\n493\n00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:19.140\nthese utilities multiple times\nin different context, right?\n\n494\n00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:23.210\nI could also see all of the components,\nkind of like I do in Device Manager.\n\n495\n00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:26.400\nI can see all the devices,\nhardware devices,\n\n496\n00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.420\nthat are connected to this machine,\nincluding things like Input.\n\n497\n00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:30.590\nMulitmedia.\n\n498\n00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:32.260\nAudio and Video codexes, right?\n\n499\n00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:35.490\nWhat codexes does this\ncomputer currently support?\n\n500\n00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:38.740\nI don't know, but I can find it out\nwith system information, right?\n\n501\n00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.790\nThat's again, a great thing to have.\n\n502\n00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:43.720\nI can also see software environment,\nand this is good for\n\n503\n00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:47.010\nthings like what drivers do you have\ninstalled, what drivers are available,\n\n504\n00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:49.880\nwhat are your environment variables,\nwhere do I put temporary files.\n\n505\n00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.170\nWell, I might need to see\nthat information, right?\n\n506\n00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:54.990\nAnd I can come down here\nto software environment and\n\n507\n00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:58.965\nI can see things like system drivers and\nall the drivers, right?\n\n508\n00:25:58.965 --> 00:26:00.390\nAnd what is their current state?\n\n509\n00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:03.070\nWell, I've got quite a few drivers here,\nbut some of them aren't started,\n\n510\n00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:05.250\nsome of them aren't even loaded,\nall right?\n\n511\n00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:06.966\nThe other thing, environment variables.\n\n512\n00:26:06.966 --> 00:26:11.260\nI can find out where certain files\nare stored by default, right?\n\n513\n00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:12.690\nPrint jobs, right?\n\n514\n00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:15.540\nIt's interesting,\nit says cannot access the WMI software.\n\n515\n00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:17.008\nThat's okay, we're not worried about it.\n\n516\n00:26:17.008 --> 00:26:19.300\nWMI's well being the scope of this exam.\n\n517\n00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.510\nNetwork connections and\nall other different types of stuff.\n\n518\n00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:27.670\nServices, all right, all the services,\nand what are their current state, right?\n\n519\n00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:32.140\nSo you could see so much information right\nhere in the System Information console.\n\n520\n00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:37.290\nAll right, now, what's kind of interesting\nis as we've been working through all of\n\n521\n00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:40.510\nthese different utilities,\nthese utilities are actually based off of\n\n522\n00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:42.960\nwhat is known as\na Microsoft Management Console.\n\n523\n00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.820\nThat's known as an MMC, all right?\n\n524\n00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:49.870\nAnd things like, for instance, let me\nshow you here on this Windows machine.\n\n525\n00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:51.530\nIf I launch Computer Management,\n\n526\n00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:56.320\nComputer Management is\na Microsoft Management Console, MMC.\n\n527\n00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.500\nNow, it's built into\nthe operating system and\n\n528\n00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:04.030\nit kinda has the tools already\nconfigured for us in the MMC.\n\n529\n00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:08.660\nBut sometimes you might wanna\ncustomize your own console, and\n\n530\n00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:12.190\nthat's where the MMC comes in,\nthe Microsoft Management Console.\n\n531\n00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:13.090\nAnd what I mean by that,\n\n532\n00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:15.988\nI know that gets a little confusing,\nis this isn't a prebuild.\n\n533\n00:27:15.988 --> 00:27:19.040\nIf I go ahead and\ngo to the modern UI and I type mmc.exe,\n\n534\n00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:24.480\nyou're gonna see this little toolbox\nwith a little window behind it, right?\n\n535\n00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:28.250\nAnd if I open that up,\nnotice that I have this blank console.\n\n536\n00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:30.390\nLooks just the same as\nComputer Management,\n\n537\n00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:31.810\nonly it doesn't have anything in it,\nright?\n\n538\n00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:33.180\nIt's a blank slate.\n\n539\n00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:37.610\nAnd what I can do is I can come in\nhere and I can add or remove snap-ins.\n\n540\n00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:39.600\nNow, I'm so\nused to using the keyboard shortcut,\n\n541\n00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:44.050\nI just did a CTL + M but let me show you\nhere, you can go to File and we can add or\n\n542\n00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:48.470\nremove snap-ins, and you can actually\nmake your own console, right?\n\n543\n00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:51.280\nSo maybe I don't need everything\nin Computer Management.\n\n544\n00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:57.200\nI want Device Manager, and I can also,\nby the way, manage the local device, or\n\n545\n00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:01.880\nI can connect to another computer over the\nnetwork and manage it from this location.\n\n546\n00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:05.230\nSo it also does remote management,\nwhich is really, really cool, all right?\n\n547\n00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:06.930\nAnd I'm gonna choose Finish.\n\n548\n00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:09.730\nAnd then maybe I wanted Disk Management,\ntoo.\n\n549\n00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:12.070\nAnd again, it's asking me,\ndo you want this computer, or\n\n550\n00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:14.160\ndo you wanna connect over\nthe network to another computer?\n\n551\n00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.020\nI'm just gonna use this computer here.\n\n552\n00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:18.080\nAnd we'll choose Finish.\n\n553\n00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.403\nAnd then we'll choose OK.\n\n554\n00:28:19.403 --> 00:28:27.320\nAll right, and now, I have Device Manager\nin my Microsoft Management Console.\n\n555\n00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.350\nI also have disc management here, right?\n\n556\n00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:31.610\nI don't have all of the other things,\njust what I want.\n\n557\n00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:39.240\nSo it's a great thing to be able to\nmake and customize your own console.\n\n558\n00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:42.340\nAnd then,\nwhat we can do here is you can save this.\n\n559\n00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.290\nAnd I'll save it to the desktop.\n\n560\n00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:49.700\nAnd I'm gonna call that my\ntoolbox because it's in the icon.\n\n561\n00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:51.590\nIt's gotta be my toolbox.\n\n562\n00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:52.840\nIt's not Zach's, it's mine.\n\n563\n00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:53.720\n&gt;&gt; No, it's yours.\n\n564\n00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:54.942\n&gt;&gt; Get your own toolbox, man.\n\n565\n00:28:54.942 --> 00:28:57.080\n[LAUGH] All right, so, there we go.\n\n566\n00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:00.090\nAnd the great thing is once I've saved\nit there, Zach, I can launch this up.\n\n567\n00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:04.300\nEven cooler than that, I can download\nthis to a USB thumb drive and\n\n568\n00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:07.030\nI can plug it into any machine and\nit's already pre-built for me, right?\n\n569\n00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:09.750\nSo a great thing to have, too.\n\n570\n00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:14.840\nNow, we have two more utilities that we\nhave to talk about, and I don't believe\n\n571\n00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:19.340\nthat they're going to get in depth, I'm\nnot sure, but we do want to mention them.\n\n572\n00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:23.540\nAnd one of them we want to mention is\nwhat is know as the Windows PowerShell.\n\n573\n00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:25.280\n&gt;&gt; Is PowerShell like the command line?\n\n574\n00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:26.490\nIs it same thing?\n\n575\n00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:27.460\n&gt;&gt; It is, it is.\n\n576\n00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:31.550\nAnd actually, it's the next\ngeneration command line interface.\n\n577\n00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:33.290\nLet me show what Zach's talking about.\n\n578\n00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:35.910\nSo Zach,\nhe was mentioning command line, right?\n\n579\n00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:38.090\nAnd traditionally it's\nknown as command prompt.\n\n580\n00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:39.770\nYou might hear it called command line.\n\n581\n00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:44.890\nBecause we have, well essentially what\nwe're doing here is we're working with\n\n582\n00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:47.200\nWindows without the GUI, right?\n\n583\n00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:52.260\nWithout the GUI interface, the graphical\nuser interface here, all right?\n\n584\n00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:55.789\nAnd this allows us to put,\nbasically, input text.\n\n585\n00:29:57.090 --> 00:29:59.875\nAnd we get text based output, right?\n\n586\n00:29:59.875 --> 00:30:03.440\nYou don't get the graphical user\ninterface like the Windows desktop.\n\n587\n00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:08.337\nBut you also have the next generation\ncommand line interface which is what's\n\n588\n00:30:08.337 --> 00:30:10.305\nknown as Windows Power Shell.\n\n589\n00:30:10.305 --> 00:30:13.544\nAnd Windows PowerShell allows\nyou not to enter commands, but\n\n590\n00:30:13.544 --> 00:30:16.110\nto enter what's known as commandlets.\n\n591\n00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:21.050\nAnd commandlets are a verb-noun syntax.\n\n592\n00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:24.880\nSo for instance,\nget execution policy, right?\n\n593\n00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:27.640\nI want to see,\ncan I run scripts on this machine?\n\n594\n00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.510\nWell, it tells me they are restricted.\n\n595\n00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:36.237\nWell, then I can also run a commandlet\nthat says, again, a verb-noun syntax.\n\n596\n00:30:36.237 --> 00:30:39.725\nI can do set execution policy.\n\n597\n00:30:39.725 --> 00:30:46.890\nAnd I can do, let's say, remote, I believe\nits remote, if I can spell remote.\n\n598\n00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:49.770\nRemote sign.\n\n599\n00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:52.790\nAll right, and it's going to ask me,\ndo you want to configure it this way?\n\n600\n00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:56.620\nAnd I am going to go ahead and\njust say, is there a yes to all, no.\n\n601\n00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:57.380\nOkay, so there we go.\n\n602\n00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:02.490\nAnd then if I re-run that commandlet\nsaying Get-ExecutionPolicy,\n\n603\n00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:06.570\nI can now say that I can configure\nmy device with it, right?\n\n604\n00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:08.930\n&gt;&gt; So again,\nthis is an example of Windows PowerShell.\n\n605\n00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:13.450\nAnd again, remember, if we do\nsomething like Get-Command, again,\n\n606\n00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:17.760\nnotice that the verb-noun syntax.\n\n607\n00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.820\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to say, Zach,\ndid you get all of those?\n\n608\n00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:20.860\n&gt;&gt; I'm reading it all.\n\n609\n00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:22.060\nI'm memorizing every bit of it.\n\n610\n00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:24.270\n&gt;&gt; Okay, very good,\nwe've plugged him into the matrix.\n\n611\n00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:26.761\nBut I do that jokingly and\nthe same time serious.\n\n612\n00:31:26.761 --> 00:31:29.160\nAs you can see,\nthere's quite a few, all right?\n\n613\n00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:33.542\nBut what I want you to be able to do more\nthan anything is notice the verb-noun\n\n614\n00:31:33.542 --> 00:31:34.057\nsyntax.\n\n615\n00:31:34.057 --> 00:31:35.289\nUpdate-List.\n\n616\n00:31:35.289 --> 00:31:36.521\nUpdate-Help.\n\n617\n00:31:36.521 --> 00:31:37.430\nRight?\n\n618\n00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:38.430\nGet this.\n\n619\n00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:39.160\nSet that.\n\n620\n00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:39.820\nStop this.\n\n621\n00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:40.520\nStop that.\n\n622\n00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:41.260\nEnable this.\n\n623\n00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:43.200\nDisable that, right?\n\n624\n00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:47.259\nNow, the next thing that we have, we can\ngo a little bit further than that, too.\n\n625\n00:31:47.259 --> 00:31:51.280\nAnd we have what is known as\nthe Windows PowerShell ISE.\n\n626\n00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.098\n&gt;&gt; So what is the ISE, what is that about?\n\n627\n00:31:53.098 --> 00:31:55.630\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthe ISE takes Windows PowerShell and\n\n628\n00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:57.897\nit kind of takes it to a whole new level.\n\n629\n00:31:57.897 --> 00:31:58.667\nRight?\n\n630\n00:31:58.667 --> 00:31:59.561\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n631\n00:31:59.561 --> 00:32:03.022\nI'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna\nlaunch up my control panel again,\n\n632\n00:32:03.022 --> 00:32:07.340\nwe're gonna get down into system and\nsecurity and administrative tools.\n\n633\n00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:09.170\nAnd I should mention this too,\n\n634\n00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:14.240\nZach, notice the x86 and\nthere's one here that doesn't have an x86.\n\n635\n00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:18.706\nThat's the difference between the 32-bit\nPowerShell and a 64-bit PowerShell.\n\n636\n00:32:18.706 --> 00:32:22.138\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; All right, now we've got a 32-bit ISE\n\n637\n00:32:22.138 --> 00:32:27.460\nand a 64-bit ISE, this is\nthe integrated scripting environment.\n\n638\n00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:31.270\nMy head's kinda covering this up, but\nif I do a little hover to discover here,\n\n639\n00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:33.990\nyou can see that it's an integrated\nscripting environment.\n\n640\n00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:37.785\nAnd if I need to run and\ntest and develop scripts,\n\n641\n00:32:37.785 --> 00:32:41.312\nI can do it right from this location,\nright?\n\n642\n00:32:41.312 --> 00:32:46.349\nAnd we've got things like IntelliSense,\nwhich is really,\n\n643\n00:32:46.349 --> 00:32:51.100\nreally cool, and\none of the things I would recommend is.\n\n644\n00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:54.051\nIf you're not used to PowerShell and\n\n645\n00:32:54.051 --> 00:32:59.400\nyou wanna become a little bit more\nused to it, come into ISE, why?\n\n646\n00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.960\n&gt;&gt; So it's kind of like a lab even?\n\n647\n00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:07.080\n&gt;&gt; Well, not really a lab so much as\nthe IntelliSense, look what it did Zach.\n\n648\n00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:09.385\n&gt;&gt; Get- and it gives me a list.\n\n649\n00:33:09.385 --> 00:33:09.940\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n650\n00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:14.370\n&gt;&gt; Gives me a list of all\nthe the available Get- cmdlets that\n\n651\n00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:18.760\nexist within PowerShell, and that's\nwhy I love the scripting environment.\n\n652\n00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:23.012\nNow you can go a little\nbit further than that, and\n\n653\n00:33:23.012 --> 00:33:27.576\nwe can start to develop our scripts here,\nlike, for\n\n654\n00:33:27.576 --> 00:33:30.810\ninstance, Get-Help, all right?\n\n655\n00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:35.649\nAnd then I can put another line\nin that says Update-Help, and\n\n656\n00:33:35.649 --> 00:33:41.250\nthen if I wanted to I could turn around\nand I could run just a single line.\n\n657\n00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:46.515\nNotice how I highlight it and I push Play,\nall right, notice what it's telling me.\n\n658\n00:33:46.515 --> 00:33:49.270\nUpdate-Help cmdlet downloads\nthe current help files for\n\n659\n00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:50.620\nthe Windows PowerShell module.\n\n660\n00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:51.970\nDo you want to update help?\n\n661\n00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:53.160\nI'm gonna say no, but\n\n662\n00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:57.460\nwhat I wanted you to see is that it\ndid exactly what I wanted to do.\n\n663\n00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:01.014\nSo if I want to test my scripts,\nif I want to develop my scripts,\n\n664\n00:34:01.014 --> 00:34:05.440\nI can load them here into the ISE,\nthe integrated scripting environment, and\n\n665\n00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.397\nI can test them.\n\n666\n00:34:06.397 --> 00:34:08.805\nI can use things like IntelliSense,\n\n667\n00:34:08.805 --> 00:34:13.400\nthat maybe I'm not sure exactly what\ncmdlet I need, well guess what?\n\n668\n00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:19.244\nI can find it, if it knows enough of\nwhat the first part of that cmdlet is,\n\n669\n00:34:19.244 --> 00:34:23.090\nit will basically give you a list\nof all the available cmdlets.\n\n670\n00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:27.960\nSo that's a little bit about ISE and\nthe integrated scripting environment.\n\n671\n00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:32.350\nI will tell you that if you're\nworking with PowerShell scripts,\n\n672\n00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:35.570\nyou have a ps1 extension, .ps1 extension.\n\n673\n00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:37.240\nSorry you guys out there\nthat love PlayStation,\n\n674\n00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:40.850\nit's actually PowerShell, that's\nthe extension for a PowerShell script.\n\n675\n00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:44.560\nSo if you see that on the exam,\nwhich of these is a PowerShell script?\n\n676\n00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:49.160\nOr which of these might you load up in the\nISE, the integrated scripting environment?\n\n677\n00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:52.660\nKnow that it's gonna be a .ps1\nextension at the end of it,\n\n678\n00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:55.020\ncuz that is a PowerShell script.\n\n679\n00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:58.680\nThese are some of the things that I\nwould be aware of when it comes to your\n\n680\n00:34:58.680 --> 00:34:59.520\nMTA exam.\n\n681\n00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:02.750\nRemember, we have plenty\nof utilities to manage and\n\n682\n00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:04.520\nmaintain your Windows environments.\n\n683\n00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:07.770\nYou just have to know what they are, where\nto find them, and how to use them, and\n\n684\n00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:08.750\nyou'll be doing well.\n\n685\n00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:10.100\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful job as usual, Wes.\n\n686\n00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:16.210\nMaintenance and management tools inside\nthe MTA Windows OS Fundamental series.\n\n687\n00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:19.170\nAnd make sure you watch every single one\nof these episodes, because Wes has done\n\n688\n00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:22.850\na great job putting all that information\ntogether for you that you can use.\n\n689\n00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:25.720\nAnd by the way, you'll be in that\nCourse Library, and while you're there,\n\n690\n00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:29.320\nthousands of other videos,\nall designed to help you go further.\n\n691\n00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:33.300\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nyou know a good IT pro is always learning.\n\n692\n00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:34.680\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n693\n00:35:34.680 -->

watching\n\n3\n00:00:09.202 --> 00:00:12.911\nITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello again,\n\n4\n00:00:12.911 --> 00:00:17.270\nthank you for choosing ITProTV, empowering\nthe world through engaging, learning.\n\n5\n00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.580\nI'm your host Zach, Memos.\n\n6\n00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.892\nAs we continue on with Windows OS\nfundamentals, this particular episode\n\n7\n00:00:22.892 --> 00:00:26.640\nwe're gonna be configuring updates and\nlearning how to do all that.\n\n8\n00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.418\nAnd Wes Bryan is here to help us and\nshow us the way.\n\n9\n00:00:30.418 --> 00:00:32.550\nHey, Wes, good to see you.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, good to see you, too, Zach.\n\n10\n00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.110\nThat's right, we're gonna be looking\nat ways that we can maintain\n\n11\n00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.590\nthose updates in our system.\n\n12\n00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.764\nAnd I can tell you,\nit has changed throughout the years.\n\n13\n00:00:40.764 --> 00:00:41.873\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n14\n00:00:41.873 --> 00:00:42.393\n&gt;&gt; The way we\n\n15\n00:00:42.393 --> 00:00:46.511\nmaintained updates in the past,\nthe way we configure updates in the past.\n\n16\n00:00:46.511 --> 00:00:52.365\nThere's been a major divergence,\nif you will, from that traditional method.\n\n17\n00:00:52.365 --> 00:00:56.845\nSo we're gonna look at pretty much\nthe traditional model and a little bit\n\n18\n00:00:56.845 --> 00:01:00.935\nmore model when it comes to Windows 10 and\nsome of the newer things we can see\n\n19\n00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:03.235\nwhen it comes to updating those systems.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n20\n00:01:03.235 --> 00:01:05.710\nWes, can I assume that this\nmeans,patch management,\n\n21\n00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.700\nwe're talking about patch management?\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what it is.\n\n22\n00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.194\nWe talked about patch management, right?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n23\n00:01:10.194 --> 00:01:12.061\n&gt;&gt; That's a systematic approach to\n\n24\n00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:16.726\nbasically to reviewing, right, researching\nan update, to approving or denying\n\n25\n00:01:16.726 --> 00:01:21.950\nthe update, approving it for the ones that\nare in your systems, testing them out.\n\n26\n00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.274\nAnd then once you test them out, maybe do\na pilot deployment where maybe deploy it\n\n27\n00:01:26.274 --> 00:01:30.682\nto some tech savvy people, or maybe even\nthe IT staff within the company, right?\n\n28\n00:01:30.682 --> 00:01:33.632\nAnd then maybe you let it sit for\na week or two, that update,\n\n29\n00:01:33.632 --> 00:01:36.360\nsee how the functionality\nof the operating system is.\n\n30\n00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.840\nAnd then after your little test deployment\nto the IT staff or the tech savvy people,\n\n31\n00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.860\nthen you roll it out to\nthe production environment.\n\n32\n00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.879\nSo it is important, right,\nto maintain a healthy Windows machine.\n\n33\n00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:52.708\nAnd one of the ways that you do\nthat is to apply your updates.\n\n34\n00:01:52.708 --> 00:01:55.990\nIn fact, I'll show you a few\nof the different machines.\n\n35\n00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.050\nWe'll show you Windows 7,\nWindows 8.1 and Windows 10 as well.\n\n36\n00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.526\nAnd if I look down here, right,\n\n37\n00:02:01.526 --> 00:02:04.220\nwe're gonna just right-click\non the Start button here.\n\n38\n00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.960\nWe'll go ahead and choose Control Panel.\n\n39\n00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.815\nAnd then from Control Panel,\nwe're gonna go to System and Security and\n\n40\n00:02:10.815 --> 00:02:15.391\nthen right up here, about fourth down from\nthe top, notice we have Windows Update.\n\n41\n00:02:15.391 --> 00:02:18.910\nAnd if I get into Windows Update,\nwell, that's one good thing to see.\n\n42\n00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.480\nI don't know that I trust it yet\nbecause it says,\n\n43\n00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.580\nNo important updates are available.\n\n44\n00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.191\nIt means my computer is up to date, right?\n\n45\n00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:29.127\nWhich it means that my computer\nhas its updates, right,\n\n46\n00:02:29.127 --> 00:02:31.349\nit has things like its patches.\n\n47\n00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:32.210\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n48\n00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.629\nIn fact,\nwe can kind of view the update history and\n\n49\n00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.752\nyou could see there are all kinds\nof different updates, right?\n\n50\n00:02:37.752 --> 00:02:39.980\nWe've got a security and\na quality roll up-\n\n51\n00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:40.628\n&gt;&gt; Read them all.\n\n52\n00:02:40.628 --> 00:02:42.184\n&gt;&gt; That's right, [LAUGH] that's right, and\n\n53\n00:02:42.184 --> 00:02:44.403\nwe'll test you on, well, no,\nwe won't test you on these.\n\n54\n00:02:44.403 --> 00:02:47.500\nSo we have different security updates.\n\n55\n00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.970\nWe have roll ups, right,\nwe have definition updates, right?\n\n56\n00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.090\nSo a lot of different patches here when it\ncomes down to maintaining a stable system.\n\n57\n00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.500\n&gt;&gt; So this is little rhetorical,\n\n58\n00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.050\nthere is different types of patches and\nupdates,\n\n59\n00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.190\naren't there?\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n60\n00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.580\nwhen it comes down to updates,\nupdates aren't just a single type, right?\n\n61\n00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.680\nSo an update is\n\n62\n00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.430\nsome kind of supplemental code.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n63\n00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.328\n&gt;&gt; All right, but\n\n64\n00:03:10.328 --> 00:03:12.686\nthere are different levels of updates.\n\n65\n00:03:12.686 --> 00:03:17.633\nSo it depends on how much\nneeds to be fixed, right?\n\n66\n00:03:17.633 --> 00:03:19.560\nSo what does an update do?\n\n67\n00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.255\nAn update usually fixes some kind of bug\nor some kind of security vulnerability.\n\n68\n00:03:25.255 --> 00:03:26.974\nLet's go ahead and\ndefine what updates are.\n\n69\n00:03:26.974 --> 00:03:28.362\nNow, we have two different models.\n\n70\n00:03:28.362 --> 00:03:30.887\nWe'll come back to the more modern model,\nbut\n\n71\n00:03:30.887 --> 00:03:33.570\nI put it up here on the list nonetheless,\nright?\n\n72\n00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.200\nThe traditional model is that we\nhave what are known as patches,\n\n73\n00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.845\nhotfixes and service packs.\n\n74\n00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:43.778\nThey're all a form of an update.\n\n75\n00:03:43.778 --> 00:03:46.930\nSo update is the umbrella term,\nif you will, right, and\n\n76\n00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.176\nunder that we have patches, all right?\n\n77\n00:03:49.176 --> 00:03:50.512\nSo what's a patch?\n\n78\n00:03:50.512 --> 00:03:55.481\nWell, a patch essentially is some\nkind of update to some known\n\n79\n00:03:55.481 --> 00:03:59.604\nbugger issue that's publicly released,\nright?\n\n80\n00:03:59.604 --> 00:04:00.681\nThe world knows about it.\n\n81\n00:04:00.681 --> 00:04:06.020\nIf you've got a Windows machine, you're\ngoing to be aware of this patch, right?\n\n82\n00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.010\nSo what's the difference between that and\na hotfix?\n\n83\n00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.849\nHere's where it gets confusing,\na hotfix is a patch.\n\n84\n00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.495\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n85\n00:04:13.495 --> 00:04:14.756\n&gt;&gt; So what does that mean?\n\n86\n00:04:14.756 --> 00:04:16.605\nHere is the big difference-\n&gt;&gt; It's a hot patch.\n\n87\n00:04:16.605 --> 00:04:18.302\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right, that's right.\n\n88\n00:04:18.302 --> 00:04:19.825\nIt's not cold like the other patch, no.\n\n89\n00:04:19.825 --> 00:04:26.360\nWhat this is, is a hotfix is typically\nsome kind of immediate update.\n\n90\n00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.017\nAnd it doesn't necessarily have to\nbe made publicly known, all right?\n\n91\n00:04:30.017 --> 00:04:34.491\nIt might be something that's slipstreamed\ninto Windows update, and it's usually,\n\n92\n00:04:34.491 --> 00:04:38.246\na lot of times, gonna fix some kind\nof security vulnerability, right?\n\n93\n00:04:38.246 --> 00:04:43.122\nSo while they're both patches,\na patch is one that is typically going\n\n94\n00:04:43.122 --> 00:04:47.929\nto be delivered in a normal cycle,\nin a normal schedule, all right?\n\n95\n00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:52.447\nBut if a hotfix comes along, let's say,\nfairly recently we have the spectre and\n\n96\n00:04:52.447 --> 00:04:55.520\nmeltdown, both things that were happening,\nright?\n\n97\n00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:01.551\nAnd a lot of the vendors were scrambling\nto try to protect against this exploit.\n\n98\n00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:05.730\nWell, what if Microsoft, and again,\nmore of a rhetorical question,\n\n99\n00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.537\nset you a scenario, what if Microsoft\nfinds affixed to the problem which they're\n\n100\n00:05:10.537 --> 00:05:13.690\nfeverishly working on a lot\nof fixes to this problem.\n\n101\n00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.110\nBut let's say they find\na fix to the problem.\n\n102\n00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.780\nShould they wait a whole entire\nmonth until the normal patch cycle\n\n103\n00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.150\nto release that security fix?\n\n104\n00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.917\nNo, they're gonna release it\nimmediately outside of the normal\n\n105\n00:05:29.917 --> 00:05:34.349\npatch schedule and\nmaybe even not even publicly made aware.\n\n106\n00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:35.640\nIt's a hotfix.\n\n107\n00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.224\nActually the hotfix it's kind of been a\nlost term as to why they call it a hotfix.\n\n108\n00:05:40.224 --> 00:05:45.446\nDo you why they call it a hotfix?\n&gt;&gt; Because it needs to be hot.\n\n109\n00:05:45.446 --> 00:05:47.707\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I threw a curveball.\n\n110\n00:05:47.707 --> 00:05:50.964\nI didn't let Zach know I was\ngonna throw that one at him, but\n\n111\n00:05:50.964 --> 00:05:53.322\nthis is something I found out, all right?\n\n112\n00:05:53.322 --> 00:05:56.651\nSo this goes, Zach,\nback to the term hot-swapping.\n\n113\n00:05:56.651 --> 00:06:00.641\nHot-swapping means that I could take a\ndevice out while the machine, the system,\n\n114\n00:06:00.641 --> 00:06:03.450\nis still powered on, and\nI can replace the failed device.\n\n115\n00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.371\nThat's hot-swapping hard drives.\n\n116\n00:06:05.371 --> 00:06:07.164\nWe do that a lot in these\nbig RAID arrays and\n\n117\n00:06:07.164 --> 00:06:09.230\nstuff where one of those\ndrives has failed.\n\n118\n00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.315\nWe don't wanna turn the whole entire RAID\narray with a storage area network down or\n\n119\n00:06:13.315 --> 00:06:16.820\nbring it offline just to\nreplace that hard drive.\n\n120\n00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:17.430\nSo what do we do?\n\n121\n00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.110\nWe hot swap it.\n\n122\n00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.050\nWe pull the hard drive out\nwhile the sand's still on, and\n\n123\n00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.210\nwe put a new one back in.\n\n124\n00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.740\nAnd then whatever software,\n\n125\n00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.960\nwhatever algorithms we're using,\nthat drive gets rebuilt and gets fixed.\n\n126\n00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.690\nIt's called a hotfix because it can be\napplied to the system while it's still\n\n127\n00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.720\nhot, while it's still online.\n&gt;&gt; Still online, see, so\n\n128\n00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.910\nI was kind of right there.\n&gt;&gt; You were close, right, you were close.\n\n129\n00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.660\nWe'll give him an E for\neffort for sure, that's right.\n\n130\n00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.350\nSo that's essentially the patch and\nthe hotfix, right?\n\n131\n00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.630\nThey're both patches.\n\n132\n00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.658\nOne is again immediately released,\nand sometimes it's\n\n133\n00:06:45.658 --> 00:06:48.126\nnot even made publicly aware.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n134\n00:06:48.126 --> 00:06:49.257\n&gt;&gt; So, where's the service pack\n\n135\n00:06:49.257 --> 00:06:49.906\ncome into play?\n\n136\n00:06:49.906 --> 00:06:52.810\nWell, here's where the service\npack comes into play.\n\n137\n00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:58.705\nA service pack, if you will, is a very\nlarge collection of multiple patches,\n\n138\n00:06:58.705 --> 00:07:03.320\nhotfixes, as well as\nadditional functionality, too.\n\n139\n00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.620\nSo when you download a service pack,\nright, what you're\n\n140\n00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:12.035\nsaying is that I need enough of these\npatches that it's not just a single patch.\n\n141\n00:07:12.035 --> 00:07:16.740\nIt's a cumulative patch with everything\nbundled in and additional functionality.\n\n142\n00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:17.410\nI'll give you an example.\n\n143\n00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.730\nOne of the biggest ones, we haven't really\nseen major service packs in a while,\n\n144\n00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:24.700\nthis kind of goes back to the days of XP.\n\n145\n00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.200\nWhen service pack 2 came in,\n\n146\n00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.510\nthis is when the Windows firewall started\nto be included in your operating system.\n\n147\n00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:34.715\nPrior to that, I remember having to\ngo to a place like Zone Alarm, and\n\n148\n00:07:34.715 --> 00:07:36.775\ndownload a separate third party firewall.\n\n149\n00:07:36.775 --> 00:07:38.664\nAt that time, they said, you know what?\n\n150\n00:07:38.664 --> 00:07:40.260\nFirewalls are so important right now,\n\n151\n00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.270\nwe should probably have our own firewall\ninside of the operating system.\n\n152\n00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.990\nSo XP service pack 2 fixes, hotfixes,\n\n153\n00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.810\npatches, and\nbrings in the firewall, right?\n\n154\n00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.799\nSo you can see added functionality, right?\n&gt;&gt; Make sense.\n\n155\n00:07:52.799 --> 00:07:55.425\n&gt;&gt; So remember service packs are again\n\n156\n00:07:55.425 --> 00:08:00.509\nan all-inclusive collection of patches and\nhotfixes, all right?\n\n157\n00:08:00.509 --> 00:08:03.768\nNow that is the model that\nwe follow under Windows 7.\n\n158\n00:08:03.768 --> 00:08:07.000\nAnd in fact we've been following for\na very long time.\n\n159\n00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:14.012\nWe follow that under Windows 7,\nWindows 8 and Windows 8.1, all right?\n\n160\n00:08:14.012 --> 00:08:19.162\nNow I wanna go to the Windows 7 machine,\nall right, and look at the list here.\n\n161\n00:08:19.162 --> 00:08:23.019\nZach, kinda joking around here, but\nat the same time, serious, right?\n\n162\n00:08:23.019 --> 00:08:25.529\nA lot of different patches.\n&gt;&gt; A lot of\n\n163\n00:08:25.529 --> 00:08:28.122\npatches.\n&gt;&gt; A lot of things that are being applied\n\n164\n00:08:28.122 --> 00:08:29.034\nto the system.\n\n165\n00:08:29.034 --> 00:08:34.212\nImagine this coming out second Tuesday\nevery month, and you have to be\n\n166\n00:08:34.212 --> 00:08:37.931\nthe admin that sifts through all of this.\n&gt;&gt; Dear.\n\n167\n00:08:37.931 --> 00:08:39.065\n&gt;&gt; Which ones do we apply,\n\n168\n00:08:39.065 --> 00:08:41.617\nto which machines do we apply\nto this machine, do we,\n\n169\n00:08:41.617 --> 00:08:43.228\nit starts to become a nightmare.\n\n170\n00:08:43.228 --> 00:08:46.534\nSo what they did is they said,\nyou know what?\n\n171\n00:08:46.534 --> 00:08:50.419\nRather than have all of these massive\namounts of patches and changes that\n\n172\n00:08:50.419 --> 00:08:54.559\nare gonna potentially cause deployment\nproblems across your environment,\n\n173\n00:08:54.559 --> 00:08:58.393\nwe're gonna go to something known\nas Windows as a Service, all right?\n\n174\n00:08:58.393 --> 00:09:03.769\nWindows as a Service is a new\nupdate model that is kind\n\n175\n00:09:03.769 --> 00:09:11.604\nof basically moved away from the\ntraditional model that we had, all right?\n\n176\n00:09:11.604 --> 00:09:16.461\nAnd what they say now is that rather\nthan basically making all of these\n\n177\n00:09:16.461 --> 00:09:21.572\npatches available the second Tuesday\nof every month, what we're gonna\n\n178\n00:09:21.572 --> 00:09:27.010\ndo is we're gonna release updates to\nour system in a cumulative manner.\n\n179\n00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:33.050\nWhich means that if I download\nan update to my Windows 10 machine for\n\n180\n00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:37.190\nthis month, that's going to include\neverything from the prior month and\n\n181\n00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:38.330\nthe prior month before that.\n\n182\n00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.850\nSo I have one update that\nhas everything bundled in.\n\n183\n00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:43.670\nBut that's not the only thing, all right?\n\n184\n00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.441\nYou have different types of\nupdates as well, all right?\n\n185\n00:09:46.441 --> 00:09:51.390\nAnd this is one of those things where\nit kind of gets a little bit tricky,\n\n186\n00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:52.224\nall right?\n\n187\n00:09:52.224 --> 00:09:56.190\nThis is that Windows as a Service\nfunctionality that we gotta kind of talk\n\n188\n00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:59.440\nabout when it comes to the different\ntypes of updates that we\n\n189\n00:09:59.440 --> 00:09:59.951\nhave.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n190\n00:09:59.951 --> 00:10:03.927\nis this Windows as a Service like a cloud\nservice, like SaaS, software as a service,\n\n191\n00:10:03.927 --> 00:10:06.990\nis that what we're talking about?\n&gt;&gt; I think what they did,\n\n192\n00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.350\nI think they played on\nthe cloud based terms.\n\n193\n00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.930\nEverybody recognizes those\ncloud based terms such as you,\n\n194\n00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:13.840\nyou recognize software as a service,\nright?\n\n195\n00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.950\nThat's a cloud functionality, and Window\nas a Service just means that the features\n\n196\n00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:23.010\nand quality updates, as well as\neverything, all the patch management\n\n197\n00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:26.013\nis going to be an ongoing thing, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n198\n00:10:26.013 --> 00:10:28.597\n&gt;&gt; See, in the traditional model,\n\n199\n00:10:28.597 --> 00:10:33.676\nservice packs here, service packs\nwould be released every two or\n\n200\n00:10:33.676 --> 00:10:36.459\nevery three to five years, right?\n\n201\n00:10:36.459 --> 00:10:41.226\nSo an operating system would be released,\nlet's say Window 7, all right?\n\n202\n00:10:41.226 --> 00:10:44.695\nAnd then three years into its maturity,\nthey would say, hey, you know what?\n\n203\n00:10:44.695 --> 00:10:47.300\nWe have a lot of extra functionality.\n\n204\n00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:51.367\nWe've got things that we want to\nadd to the operating system but\n\n205\n00:10:51.367 --> 00:10:56.062\nnot really enough to justify releasing\na new operating system, right?\n\n206\n00:10:56.062 --> 00:11:00.080\nWell, Windows as a Service says hey,\nlet's go away from that model.\n\n207\n00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:06.577\nAnd rather than every three to five years\nintroducing all of these new features,\n\n208\n00:11:06.577 --> 00:11:11.448\nwhat we're gonna do is we will\ndo two feature updates a year,\n\n209\n00:11:11.448 --> 00:11:16.800\ntwice every year, all right,\nin the spring and in the fall.\n\n210\n00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.802\nThat's why you have what's known as spring\ncreator updates and fall creator updates,\n\n211\n00:11:20.802 --> 00:11:23.190\nright, so\ntwice a year it's what's gonna happen.\n\n212\n00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:27.875\nOr maybe three times a year, but a lot\nof times just twice a year, all right?\n\n213\n00:11:27.875 --> 00:11:32.938\nNow there are a difference between feature\nupdates and quality updates, all right?\n\n214\n00:11:32.938 --> 00:11:36.705\nFeature updates are the ones\nthat are delivered twice a year.\n\n215\n00:11:36.705 --> 00:11:41.233\nAnd again, this is what departs from\nthat earlier three to five year model of\n\n216\n00:11:41.233 --> 00:11:42.734\na service pack, right?\n\n217\n00:11:42.734 --> 00:11:45.930\nThese can be deployed with\nexisting management tools.\n\n218\n00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.590\nWe'll talk about what management tools\nthat you have available coming up.\n\n219\n00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:51.210\nBut with existing management tools.\n\n220\n00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.100\nA quality update, on the other hand,\n\n221\n00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.840\nis that cumulative update\nthat I was telling you about.\n\n222\n00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.400\nNot having to go back to your\nWindows machine and pick and\n\n223\n00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.040\nchoose all of these individual\nstandalone patches.\n\n224\n00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.230\nBut we're gonna take everything from last\nmonth and we're gonna roll it up into\n\n225\n00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:11.670\na single cumulative patch and you will\napply that to the system collectively.\n\n226\n00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:12.450\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n227\n00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:16.970\nIf I move over to my Windows 10 machine\nhere, my head's kind of covering this up,\n\n228\n00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:20.995\nbut if we go down to our Action Center and\nchoose All Settings, all right?\n\n229\n00:12:20.995 --> 00:12:24.240\nAnd then from our\nWindows Settings location,\n\n230\n00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.243\nwe get to update the security, all right?\n\n231\n00:12:27.243 --> 00:12:32.440\nAnd notice that we have Windows\nupdate is selected by default.\n\n232\n00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.450\nAnd I view installed update history.\n\n233\n00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:36.670\nNotice what we have.\n\n234\n00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.450\nNotice cumulative update.\n\n235\n00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:42.196\nNow we still have some of those security\nupdates that are gonna be downloaded,\n\n236\n00:12:42.196 --> 00:12:44.500\nall right, but it's a cumulative update.\n\n237\n00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.260\nNotice these cumulative updates, right?\n\n238\n00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.600\nNow definitions, there are some\nsecurity fixes that might get\n\n239\n00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:56.522\nreleased like definition updates for your\nWindows Defender Security Suite, right?\n\n240\n00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:02.690\nBut for the most part, notice that what we\nhave here is cumulative updates, right?\n\n241\n00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:07.230\nAll of the prior updates are applied\nto this system once a month, right?\n\n242\n00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:10.570\nIt makes it a lot easier, if you will,\n\n243\n00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:14.300\nbasically just eliminating the sheer\nnumber of updates that are available each\n\n244\n00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:20.280\nmonth that your admins have to\nkind of sift through, all right?\n\n245\n00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:25.370\nNow again, remember that quality updates,\nif you will, they include things like\n\n246\n00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:30.299\nsecurity fixes and\nnon-security fixes, all right?\n\n247\n00:13:30.299 --> 00:13:35.294\nAnd that brings us into a couple of the\nother things that we have to talk about.\n\n248\n00:13:35.294 --> 00:13:38.547\nAnd that is something known as\nservice channels, all right?\n\n249\n00:13:38.547 --> 00:13:41.200\nAnd we will talk about\nservice channels coming up.\n\n250\n00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.034\n&gt;&gt; So how often are updates applied to\n\n251\n00:13:43.034 --> 00:13:45.320\nthe Windows 10 machine?\n&gt;&gt; Well, Zach,\n\n252\n00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:49.992\nI guess that really just is contingent on\nhow desperate you are from the latest and\n\n253\n00:13:49.992 --> 00:13:52.479\nthe greatest, the cutting edge, right?\n\n254\n00:13:52.479 --> 00:13:57.403\nBecause really when we talk about how\noften are updates applied to a Windows 10\n\n255\n00:13:57.403 --> 00:14:01.224\nmachine, the quality updates\nare gonna happen, all right,\n\n256\n00:14:01.224 --> 00:14:03.890\nthose non-security and security fixes.\n\n257\n00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:07.100\nWhat we're really talking about\nare the features themselves, right?\n\n258\n00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:11.350\nAnd the reason we mention the features\nis because a feature, again,\n\n259\n00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:14.870\nif you think about a service pack,\nwe would wait three years for a feature,\n\n260\n00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:16.170\na new feature to come in.\n\n261\n00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:18.760\nLike the Windows firewall like I said,\nright?\n\n262\n00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.922\nCan you imagine new features\nhappening twice a year?\n\n263\n00:14:22.922 --> 00:14:24.950\nWell, maybe that's good for\nyou, maybe it's not.\n\n264\n00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:29.200\nMaybe your company has systems that you\ndon't want the features to be applied\n\n265\n00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.680\nto those systems.\n\n266\n00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.430\nWell, that's where they have,\nthere's a couple of different terms and\n\n267\n00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:37.180\nlet me help you out because there\nwas a major naming convention\n\n268\n00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:38.672\nthat has just been changed, right?\n\n269\n00:14:38.672 --> 00:14:43.190\nYour exam objectives will call out things\nlike the insider preview, the current\n\n270\n00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:49.460\nbranch, current branch for business or\nCB and CBB, if you will, respectively.\n\n271\n00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.340\nAs well as something known as LTSB,\nall right?\n\n272\n00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:53.480\nLet's help you out with the acronyms.\n\n273\n00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.230\nIn fact, I've got a diagram here.\n\n274\n00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:56.714\nWe talked about the insider preview.\n\n275\n00:14:56.714 --> 00:14:59.440\nNow, that hasn't changed, all right?\n\n276\n00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.783\nThe insider preview says hey,\nyou want the latest and greatest?\n\n277\n00:15:02.783 --> 00:15:05.941\nIn fact, do you want it before we\neven release it to the market,\n\n278\n00:15:05.941 --> 00:15:09.234\nbefore we let anybody else have it,\ndo you wanna test it, right?\n\n279\n00:15:09.234 --> 00:15:12.949\nDo you want to download this feature and\nyou can kind of run with it before it's\n\n280\n00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:15.079\nreleased to market?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, please.\n\n281\n00:15:15.079 --> 00:15:16.656\n&gt;&gt; That's the insider preview, and\n\n282\n00:15:16.656 --> 00:15:18.563\nthat's what they call it, the preview.\n\n283\n00:15:18.563 --> 00:15:21.360\nYou're previewing a feature\nbefore it actually gets,\n\n284\n00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.938\nlet's say okayed for the deployment\nin the operating system, right?\n\n285\n00:15:24.938 --> 00:15:27.785\nNow once they are pretty\nsure they've tested,\n\n286\n00:15:27.785 --> 00:15:32.411\nthey've got the customer feedback from\nthe insider preview based feature,\n\n287\n00:15:32.411 --> 00:15:36.410\nwhat they'll do is they'll release\nit to the market, all right?\n\n288\n00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:39.962\nNow, in the older days,\nwhat this would be, the old term,\n\n289\n00:15:39.962 --> 00:15:43.178\nthis would be called the current branch,\nall right?\n\n290\n00:15:43.178 --> 00:15:47.038\nBleeding edge features before they're\nreleased to market insider preview,\n\n291\n00:15:47.038 --> 00:15:49.850\nthat stays the same in the new\nnaming convention as well.\n\n292\n00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:50.600\nThey've kept that.\n\n293\n00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.210\nIt's called the Windows Insider Program,\nand\n\n294\n00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:58.470\nwe'll show you how you can actually turn\non the Windows Insider preview, all right?\n\n295\n00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:01.680\nBut once you've tested it and\nnow we're releasing it to market,\n\n296\n00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.530\nit gets released to what's\nknown as the current branch.\n\n297\n00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:10.260\nNow that CB, that current branch this\nis where the change comes into place.\n\n298\n00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:14.640\nBecause what they have essentially\nare two different channels, all right?\n\n299\n00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.640\nAgain like I said,\ninsider preview stays the same.\n\n300\n00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:23.670\nThe servicing channels as they call\nthem today are a kin to what were called\n\n301\n00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:27.590\nservice branches, they just call them\nservice channels, and you have two.\n\n302\n00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:29.540\nYou have what's known as semi-annual, and\n\n303\n00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:31.640\nyou have what's known\nas long term servicing.\n\n304\n00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:33.830\nWe say well wait a second,\n\n305\n00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:38.220\nwhy does it have two, why don't we\nhave three over here on the one side?\n\n306\n00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:40.440\nWe have current branch,\ncurrent branch for business, and\n\n307\n00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.540\nwe have long term service branching.\n\n308\n00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:46.470\nWell, that's because current branch and\ncurrent branch for business,\n\n309\n00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:50.720\nboth of those have kind of been\nlumped under the semi-annual channel.\n\n310\n00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:55.550\nThe current branch means we're\nreleasing that feature to market today.\n\n311\n00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:57.920\nThat's gonna be your semi-annual targeted.\n\n312\n00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.880\nHowever, in a corporate environment,\n\n313\n00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.450\nmaybe you wanna test those\nfeatures a little bit.\n\n314\n00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:06.370\nSo maybe you have a system\nthat's on the insider review.\n\n315\n00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:07.720\nMaybe you don't like the insider preview,\n\n316\n00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.210\nyou want to wait til\nit's released to market.\n\n317\n00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:12.710\nSo you've got a couple of machines that\nare actually on the semi-annual targeted,\n\n318\n00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:15.730\nthey get deployed that feature right\naway and you test them for a while and\n\n319\n00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:19.320\nyou differ those feature\nupdates on your semi-annual.\n\n320\n00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:23.000\nWhich is essentially the current\nbranch for business.\n\n321\n00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.605\nThen once you've tested them,\nthen you can deploy.\n\n322\n00:17:25.605 --> 00:17:33.278\nNow, the last one we have which basically\njust called long term servicing today.\n\n323\n00:17:33.278 --> 00:17:35.098\nWhen we talk about long term servicing,\n\n324\n00:17:35.098 --> 00:17:37.775\nwhat we mean is you have\nspecialized device.\n\n325\n00:17:37.775 --> 00:17:41.450\nYou have a system that is running\nWindows 10 and it has some kind of maybe\n\n326\n00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:44.505\neven single use functionality like\nmedical equipment if you will,\n\n327\n00:17:44.505 --> 00:17:46.850\nmaybe a point of sale system.\n\n328\n00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:49.991\nAnd underneath, under that software\nunderneath is running Windows 10, well,\n\n329\n00:17:49.991 --> 00:17:54.870\nif you think about it, a point of sale\nsystems I don't need new features on.\n\n330\n00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:58.400\nIf anything I need the software\nthat's on the point of sale system\n\n331\n00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.870\nto include the features, not the operating\nsystem that is running on top of.\n\n332\n00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:08.200\nSo for those special use cases,\nyou don't want to apply features and\n\n333\n00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:12.070\nif you do, maybe you want to deffer\nthem much up to three years.\n\n334\n00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:14.476\ntell, That's why they call\nit long term servicing.\n\n335\n00:18:14.476 --> 00:18:17.952\nFor these specialized devices\nthat there roles don't change,\n\n336\n00:18:17.952 --> 00:18:21.490\nyou don't want to apply these\ncutting edge features even after,\n\n337\n00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:25.606\nthey've been deployed to the rest of\nyour computers within your networks,\n\n338\n00:18:25.606 --> 00:18:28.338\nyou choose long term service branching.\n&gt;&gt; Makes\n\n339\n00:18:28.338 --> 00:18:29.471\nsense.\n&gt;&gt; And again,\n\n340\n00:18:29.471 --> 00:18:32.889\nthese are usually things like medical\nequipment, ATMs, point of sale systems,\n\n341\n00:18:32.889 --> 00:18:33.890\nspecialized devices.\n\n342\n00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:39.130\nAll right, so\nthat is a little bit about the channels.\n\n343\n00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:42.900\nHowever, we do have more to talk about\nwhen it comes to configuring updates.\n\n344\n00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:46.310\nBut looking at the time it's like we're\ngonna have to go into a part two.\n\n345\n00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:48.190\n&gt;&gt; Okay, configuring updates.\n\n346\n00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:51.960\nThat's part of\nthe Windows OS Fundamentals Series.\n\n347\n00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.329\nMake sure you watch every single episode.\n\n348\n00:18:54.329 --> 00:18:55.486\nYou'll be glad you did.\n\n349\n00:18:55.486 --> 00:18:56.589\nWes, wonderful job.\n\n350\n00:18:56.589 --> 00:18:59.031\nHe's doing a great job putting\nall this together for you.\n\n351\n00:18:59.031 --> 00:19:01.186\nAnd it'll do nothing but\nhelp you in the long run.\n\n352\n00:19:01.186 --> 00:19:04.862\nAnd while you're in the course library,\nthere's thousands of other videos there,\n\n353\n00:19:04.862 --> 00:19:07.240\nand they're all designed to do one thing.\n\n354\n00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.378\nHelp you go further.\n\n355\n00:19:08.378 --> 00:19:10.880\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n356\n00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.755\nITProTV, this is binge worthy.\n\n357\n00:19:12.755 -->

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.265 --> 00:00:16.010\nThank you for choosing ITProTV helping\nyou bring learn wherever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.990\nI'm your host Zack Memos for\nthis episode of Windows OS fundamentals.\n\n6\n00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.500\nWe're still configuring updates.\n\n7\n00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.280\nThis is configuring updates part 2.\n\n8\n00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.510\nMake sure you see part 1, very important.\n\n9\n00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.390\nWes Bryan's here to help us out again.\n\n10\n00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.110\nWes, good to see you.\n\n11\n00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.280\n&gt;&gt; Hey, good to see you too, Zach.\n\n12\n00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.630\nThat's right, we wanted to come back and\n\n13\n00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.600\nshow you a little bit more\nof the hands on, right?\n\n14\n00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.580\nWe've been talking a lot about\nthe theory in the first part.\n\n15\n00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.480\nAnd we did see some of the hands on.\n\n16\n00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.480\nWe looked at Windows update as well but\n\n17\n00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.480\nwe wanna show you a little bit more,\nall right?\n\n18\n00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.010\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\n\n19\n00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.500\nwe're going to dive right in to\nour Windows operating system.\n\n20\n00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.320\nAnd we're gonna look at actually\nconfiguring our Windows update.\n\n21\n00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.420\nSo let me show you what I mean here.\n\n22\n00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.140\nI'm on a Windows 7 machine, and we're\ngonna kind of do this across the board so\n\n23\n00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.670\nthat you guys will be\nfamiliar with the interfaces,\n\n24\n00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.020\nshould they ask you on the exam.\n\n25\n00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.560\nSo, to configure Windows update here,\n\n26\n00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.570\nwe're gonna go ahead on our\nWindows 7 machine here.\n\n27\n00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.320\nWe'll choose our start button.\n\n28\n00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.210\nAnd we're gonna launch Control Panel.\n\n29\n00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.000\nAnd then from Control Panel,\nwe're gonna get into System and Security.\n\n30\n00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.990\nAnd then right there in\nthe middle is Windows Update.\n\n31\n00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.020\nA fairly easy process,\npretty straight forward process.\n\n32\n00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.730\nNow, one of the things that tell is\nno important updates are available.\n\n33\n00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.187\nRemember that you have to have internet\nconnectivity for the all right?\n\n34\n00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:28.445\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That's just required.\n\n35\n00:01:28.445 --> 00:01:32.614\nNow, there is another model that will that\nwe'll talk to about here in a little bit\n\n36\n00:01:32.614 --> 00:01:35.035\nthen maybe you don't need\ninternet connectivity.\n\n37\n00:01:35.035 --> 00:01:37.065\nAnd I just want you to hold that thought,\n\n38\n00:01:37.065 --> 00:01:39.865\nhow can I get an update if I\ncan't connect to the internet?\n\n39\n00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:42.975\nWell, we'll just leave you\nwith that little cliff hanger.\n\n40\n00:01:42.975 --> 00:01:46.075\nAll right, so,\nare there any important updates?\n\n41\n00:01:46.075 --> 00:01:49.245\nWell it tells me since the last\ntime I checked, which 9:37 and\n\n42\n00:01:49.245 --> 00:01:53.315\napparently it did this couple of days ago.\n\n43\n00:01:53.315 --> 00:01:55.840\nSo this is a little out of date.\n\n44\n00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.840\nEven though it says no important\nupdates are available.\n\n45\n00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.490\nSo all we have to do,\nis choose Check for updates, right?\n\n46\n00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.410\nBut I wanna go ahead and,\n\n47\n00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.230\nbefore we choose Check for updates,\nthat's a very manual process right?\n\n48\n00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.110\nThat means I have come in here and I have\nto remembered to mainly click Check for\n\n49\n00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.700\nupdates.\n\n50\n00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.880\nSo I want you to see the settings first,\nright?\n\n51\n00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.340\nNotice the settings that we have here,\nall right?\n\n52\n00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.170\nNotice important updates, choose how\nWindows can install updates, right?\n\n53\n00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.120\nWhen your computer is online,\nWindows can automatically check for\n\n54\n00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.532\nimportant updates, all right?\n\n55\n00:02:25.532 --> 00:02:28.770\nInstall them,\nI'm using these settings, right?\n\n56\n00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.830\nNow we choose the down arrow, all right?\n\n57\n00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.920\nWe've got a few options here, right?\n\n58\n00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.910\nWe can say and you could see us recommend\nit because this is a setting for getting.\n\n59\n00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.800\nGo ahead and\njust install the updates automatically.\n\n60\n00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.590\nIf they're available and\nthey need to be installed, install them.\n\n61\n00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right, and I love that because again,\n\n62\n00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.510\nif we're in a decentraled environment,\nthat means I can configure this one\n\n63\n00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.600\nWindows 7 machine or Windows 8 machine and\nI can configure it to\n\n64\n00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.690\nreach out to the Windows update servers\n&gt;&gt; And pull down it's updates and\n\n65\n00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.330\ninstall them for me.\n\n66\n00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.340\nBut maybe that's not what I wanna do,\nall right?\n\n67\n00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.770\nMaybe I'm supporting a SOHO environment,\nright?\n\n68\n00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.400\nA small office,\nhome office maybe on Windows Work Group,\n\n69\n00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.970\nwhich is ten computers max, right?\n\n70\n00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.930\nMaybe I wanna say go ahead and\ndownload the updates but\n\n71\n00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.420\nthen present me with a list.\n\n72\n00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.800\nAnd it doesn't download them and\nthen give you a list but when I go in and\n\n73\n00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.390\nI need to do updates let me just choose\nfrom the updates that you've recommended.\n\n74\n00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.170\nCheck for updates but let me choose\nwhether to download them and install them.\n\n75\n00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.430\nSo now give me both options.\n\n76\n00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.700\nIf I want to download them\nI'll download them, if not,\n\n77\n00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.820\nI'm just not gonna download them.\n\n78\n00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.070\nBut then when I do download them,\ndo I wanna install them or not?\n\n79\n00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.210\nAnd then not recommended\nis to never check for\n\n80\n00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.220\nupdates and\nof course we don't wanna do that.\n\n81\n00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.800\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah.\nLet's just change settings here, and\n\n117\n00:05:22.235 --> 00:05:24.045\nthe same thing applies, right?.\n\n118\n00:05:24.045 --> 00:05:27.405\nSo again, for the most part it\nreally hasn't changed that much,\n\n119\n00:05:27.405 --> 00:05:31.245\nas you can see the same options\nthat we've talked about here.\n\n120\n00:05:31.245 --> 00:05:35.310\nI would say for me,\nin a decentraled environment,\n\n121\n00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.770\ndecentralized environment,\nset it forget it.\n\n122\n00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.660\nMake sure that you install\nthem automatically.\n\n123\n00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.337\n&gt;&gt; You mean non-Enterprise environment.\n\n124\n00:05:41.337 --> 00:05:42.630\n&gt;&gt; Non-Enterprise environment.\n\n125\n00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.372\nWell, you definitely don't\nwant an Enterprise environment\n\n126\n00:05:45.372 --> 00:05:46.035\nthat's decentralized.\n\n127\n00:05:46.035 --> 00:05:46.535\nThere would-\n&gt;&gt; No, no [CROSSTALK].\n\n128\n00:05:46.535 --> 00:05:49.290\n&gt;&gt; Be a lot of administrative overhead,\n\n129\n00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.794\nall right?\nAll right so\n\n130\n00:05:50.794 --> 00:05:53.044\nthat's what it looks on Windows 8.1.\nBut\n\n131\n00:05:53.044 --> 00:05:56.754\nthen we also have some other options here\ntoo like for instance just checking for\n\n132\n00:05:56.754 --> 00:05:58.574\nupdates.\nNow this is giving me a problem and\n\n133\n00:05:58.574 --> 00:06:03.050\nthis was doing this earlier and\nyou could get help with this error for\n\n134\n00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.250\nsome reasons it's not liking this link.\n\n135\n00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.200\nLet me try this one, there we go.\n\n136\n00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.860\nThat's what I wanted.\n\n137\n00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.660\nI don't know why it didn't like that\nhyperlink for whatever reason, all right?\n\n138\n00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.220\nBut now its checking for updates.\n\n139\n00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.680\nNow I wanna see if there's actually\nan important update that is coming up,\n\n140\n00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:23.340\nbecause where this Windows 7 machine\nchecked a few days ago, couples days ago.\n\n141\n00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.540\n&gt;&gt; I still wanna check the updates,\n\n142\n00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.680\ncuz it tells me no important\nupdates are available.\n\n143\n00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.480\nAnd I'll make sure that you understand\nwhat we mean by optional updates.\n\n144\n00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.580\nSo actually, we'll go ahead and\nbe talk about it now, all right?\n\n145\n00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.510\nSo optional updates are things\nlike language packs, do you wanna\n\n146\n00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:41.867\ninstall those, well if I don't have\nany use with the other languages and\n\n147\n00:06:41.867 --> 00:06:44.910\nwhat I mean by that is I'm\nnot gonna utilize them.\n\n148\n00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.540\nThen that's optional software that\ndoesn't necessarily have to be on my\n\n149\n00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.220\ncomputer, right?\n\n150\n00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.440\nSo there are some things that\nare optional and say, hey, these aren't\n\n151\n00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.450\nimportant to the criticality, the\nfunctionality of your operating system.\n\n152\n00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.230\nAnd let's kinda take a look here,\noptional updates, what do we have here?\n\n153\n00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.550\nAll right, definition update for\nMicrosoft Security Essentials, all right.\n\n154\n00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.100\nI'm kinda surprise that\nthat's an optional one.\n\n155\n00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.330\nNow, here's most likely the reason,\nall right.\n\n156\n00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.308\nSecurity essentials as a Windows 7 was\na separate thing that you would add on.\n\n157\n00:07:15.308 --> 00:07:19.474\nWhen Windows 8.1 came out they said,\nlet's take security essentials and\n\n158\n00:07:19.474 --> 00:07:24.000\nbundle it right in the Windows defender\nstick in the operating system.\n\n159\n00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.050\nAll right, so I would almost be willing\nto bet that if we had definition updates,\n\n160\n00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.980\nwe've moved over to the Windows 8.1\nmachine, they might not be optional.\n\n161\n00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.480\nThose might be important updates,\nall right?\n\n162\n00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.990\nBut then all I have to do is select the\noptional updates that maybe I might want\n\n163\n00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.410\nto apply.\n\n164\n00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:42.030\nAnd down here on the lower right\nhand corner, I'm gonna zoom in so\n\n165\n00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:43.320\nyou can see it there.\n\n166\n00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.490\nNotice it tells me total selected and\nI choose OK.\n\n167\n00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:54.902\nAll right, now it also tells me what is\nthe disk space that I'm gonna accrue.\n\n168\n00:07:54.902 --> 00:07:59.056\nAll right keep in mind, we really haven't\ntalked about storage when it comes to\n\n169\n00:07:59.056 --> 00:08:02.110\nupdates but you do have to have\na certain level of storage.\n\n170\n00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:06.630\nNow, I will tell you that\nbecause drive capacities are so\n\n171\n00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:09.830\nlarge today,\nthis really shouldn't be an issue.\n\n172\n00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.530\nBut if you start accruing\na lot of drive space,\n\n173\n00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:16.510\nthere could be a point in time where you\ngo past the point no return and it's not\n\n174\n00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:20.800\ngonna download the updates because of the\nfact that you have a lack of storage base.\n\n175\n00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.030\nAgain I don't see that being a problem,\nbut it is it is something to keep in mind.\n\n176\n00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:29.938\nAnd we could choose install updates, and\nnow it is reaching out to Microsoft across\n\n177\n00:08:29.938 --> 00:08:34.370\nthe internet and it's pulling down\nthose updates from the update server.\n\n178\n00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:36.759\nAll right, so we'll let this go ahead and\nchurn through here and\n\n179\n00:08:36.759 --> 00:08:37.786\nwe'll see if we come back.\n\n180\n00:08:37.786 --> 00:08:42.870\nThis one is still checking for updates so\nwho knows, it could be a long time.\n\n181\n00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.880\n&gt;&gt; Though it's reaching out right now but\nit seems to be taking a long time.\n\n182\n00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.990\nCan it take even longer?\n\n183\n00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.920\n&gt;&gt; It really can.\n\n184\n00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.050\nAnd when you start talking about multiple\ncomputers connecting to Windows update\n\n185\n00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:55.640\non your network, it could take a while.\n\n186\n00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.740\nIn fact this one has actually finished and\nlet me show you why here.\n\n187\n00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:03.690\nBecause if you'll notice, so those\nupdates that we did before, the two or\n\n188\n00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:05.920\nthree, that was like 200 megs or so.\n\n189\n00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.820\nIt was optional.\n\n190\n00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:13.000\nWe are just under 400 megs, right,\nso that's almost half a gig.\n\n191\n00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.350\nAnd we're talking about five updates.\n\n192\n00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:19.780\nI've actually seen where especially\nif you happen to install,\n\n193\n00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.440\nlet's say you're installing\nWindows 7 operating system and\n\n194\n00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.280\nit doesn't have service pack 1,\nin the installation media.\n\n195\n00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.905\nMaybe it's an old disk, right.\n\n196\n00:09:26.905 --> 00:09:31.830\nWell now you have to update\ngoing back all the way way back\n\n197\n00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:36.480\nto Windows 7 in 2007 or 8?\n\n198\n00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.000\nAnd you have to do all\nthe updates from then.\n\n199\n00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.280\nAll right, so what, ten years?\n\n200\n00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.010\nTen years now, ten years of update.\n\n201\n00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:44.300\nSo that could take forever.\n\n202\n00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.490\nAnd in fact,\nit's a little intimidating when\n\n203\n00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.740\nyou see things like downloading 1 of 192.\n\n204\n00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:55.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I remember the days of\nservice packs and it did, it took a while.\n\n205\n00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:57.250\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely and it could, all right.\n\n206\n00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:59.340\nSo that is something and\nI'm glad you asked that.\n\n207\n00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.840\nIt is something to keep in mind that just\nbecause we only had five updates and\n\n208\n00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.400\nyou could see that it took a little bit.\n\n209\n00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.460\nIf you have 50 updates,\nif you have compounding updates, and\n\n210\n00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.070\nwhat I mean by that is I\ndownloaded 5 updates here.\n\n211\n00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:14.250\nI might have to install these updates and\nthen choose connect to micro or\n\n212\n00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:15.690\nWindows update again.\n\n213\n00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:18.660\nAnd now I see another 6 updates, right.\n\n214\n00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:22.190\nSo sometimes you have to\ninstall them sequentially.\n\n215\n00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:26.220\nSo even though you looks like what we\nsee on our screen now is five updates,\n\n216\n00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.240\nthere could be five or six past this.\n\n217\n00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.790\nAnd let me show you what I mean now, the\ndifference between an important update,\n\n218\n00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:35.590\nall right, and optional updates.\n\n219\n00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:37.620\nAll right, so\nhere are our important updates.\n\n220\n00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:41.980\nSecurity quality, a roll up,\na roll up is an all inclusive.\n\n221\n00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:46.920\nIt's kind of like a,\nit's not really a cumulative update,\n\n222\n00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.860\nbecause this is a security and\nquality roll up of the net framework.\n\n223\n00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:54.920\nIt's applied to a specific component\nwithin the operating system.\n\n224\n00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:59.865\nUnlike Windows 10, doing the cumulative\nupdates of all past updates,\n\n225\n00:10:59.865 --> 00:11:03.995\nthis is just roll ups that are applied,\nlet's say to the dot net framework,\n\n226\n00:11:03.995 --> 00:11:06.305\na specific component, within the system.\n\n227\n00:11:06.305 --> 00:11:09.240\nYour Windows Malicious\nSoftware Removal Tool,\n\n228\n00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.616\nwe'll talk about the MRT\ncoming up in another episode.\n\n229\n00:11:12.616 --> 00:11:13.980\nSo that's very important.\n\n230\n00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.620\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; What are some of the optional ones?\n\n231\n00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:19.460\nAnd again, you can see, these are previews\nof a quality roll out, all right.\n\n232\n00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:23.090\nAnd typically what I do is I make sure\nthat I have all the important ones.\n\n233\n00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.490\nI'll look at the optionals and\nin this case, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n234\n00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:26.570\ninstall the optionals.\n\n235\n00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:27.080\nIt's up to you.\n\n236\n00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.280\nIt's why they call it optional, right.\n\n237\n00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.210\nAnd then what we're gonna do,\n\n238\n00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:33.690\njust like we did in our Windows 7 machine,\nnotice how many.\n\n239\n00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:35.190\nWe're just under a gig.\n\n240\n00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:37.000\nSo I have a feeling, Zach, and\n\n241\n00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.260\nI'll give you guys a heads up before\nwe even click install on this one.\n\n242\n00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:44.260\nI don't think this is gonna install\nby the end of this episode, right.\n\n243\n00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.010\nIt might, but I kinda doubt it, right.\n\n244\n00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:50.050\nAnd my head's kinda covered up the install\nbutton right here that we need to see.\n\n245\n00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:55.760\nSo, notice that I've got total selected\nand we've got five important updates,\n\n246\n00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:01.230\nthree optional for just under 900 megs,\nand I'm gonna go ahead and click install.\n\n247\n00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:02.750\nAnd it'll do exactly that.\n\n248\n00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:05.250\nIt's gonna download them first right and\n\n249\n00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:08.400\nthen it's going to go through\nthe process of the installation.\n\n250\n00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:12.470\nIn fact let's go ahead and\nswitch over to our Windows 7 machine and\n\n251\n00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:16.050\nwe can see right now that we\nhave a restart waiting, right.\n\n252\n00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:22.280\nAnd that's three updates have installed\nsuccessfully, but understand, notice it\n\n253\n00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:26.610\nsays Windows can't update important files\nand services while the system is using.\n\n254\n00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:28.510\nSo there is a portion of this update,\n\n255\n00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:34.090\neven though that it was optional, that\nneeds to be applied to the system offline.\n\n256\n00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:34.990\nIt's not a hot fix.\n\n257\n00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:36.347\nRemember we talked about the hot fix,\n\n258\n00:12:36.347 --> 00:12:39.060\na hot fix is applied to the system\nwhile it's hot, while it's online.\n\n259\n00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.197\nThis is going to be some\nkind of offline patch.\n\n260\n00:12:43.197 --> 00:12:46.440\nSo we'll go ahead and we will restart now.\n\n261\n00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.375\nAnd we'll let this machine restart.\n\n262\n00:12:48.375 --> 00:12:51.240\nHere is gonna take a while for\nwindows 8.1 machine, so\n\n263\n00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.630\nat least you could see us\ninstalling some of the updates,\n\n264\n00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:57.120\nbecause the interfaces are the same and\nthe steps are gonna be the same too.\n\n265\n00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.340\nSo let's go ahead now and\nlet's move over to our Windows 10 machine.\n\n266\n00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:05.780\nAnd now that we have an understanding of\nhow we have updated our machine since\n\n267\n00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:09.562\nthe days of XP, we'll go ahead and\nchange everything.\n\n268\n00:13:09.562 --> 00:13:11.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n269\n00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:15.560\nif you want the latest and greatest,\nyou want the bleeding edge,\n\n270\n00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.360\nall right, you're gonna go to\nthe Windows insider program.\n\n271\n00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.670\nNow this is kind of easy to see.\n\n272\n00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:22.903\nIf I go back to the settings,\nour new settings interface,\n\n273\n00:13:22.903 --> 00:13:26.760\nnotice this is under Update and\nSecurity, all right.\n\n274\n00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:31.740\nAnd when you choose Update and Security\nyou will see we've got Windows Update and\n\n275\n00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.570\nthen down at the bottom we've\ngot the Windows insider program.\n\n276\n00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:39.157\nAnd if I want that bleeding edge,\nwhat I can do is, I could actually join\n\n277\n00:13:39.157 --> 00:13:44.130\nthe Windows insider program and I can\nturn this windows 10 edition from just\n\n278\n00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:49.047\na regular edition, a current branch\ntype addition or semiannual, right.\n\n279\n00:13:49.047 --> 00:13:50.519\nWe gotta make sure we get\nthe terminology right.\n\n280\n00:13:50.519 --> 00:13:53.740\nAnd I could say, you know what I don't\nwant to wait until it's approved for\n\n281\n00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.005\nthe rest of the world.\n\n282\n00:13:55.005 --> 00:13:58.960\nI want to see what's gonna be in\nthe operating system before everybody\n\n283\n00:13:58.960 --> 00:13:59.580\nelse knows.\n\n284\n00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:03.460\nAnd it turns this edition of\nWindows into an insider preview\n\n285\n00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:04.030\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n286\n00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:06.320\n&gt;&gt; All right, now, Windows update.\n\n287\n00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.600\nAll right, what do we got here?\n\n288\n00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.410\nAll right,\nwe could also do the same thing here.\n\n289\n00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:11.920\nWe can check for updates.\n\n290\n00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:16.350\nAll right, now, if we check for\nupdates, it does the same thing.\n\n291\n00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:19.410\nIt's gonna reach out to Windows Update and\n\n292\n00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:24.310\nit's gonna pull these updates down,\nand it's going to apply this system.\n\n293\n00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:25.770\nHowever, all right, and\n\n294\n00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:28.070\nit says, it couldn't connect\nto the update service here.\n\n295\n00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:30.110\nIt might be having\na little bit of an issue.\n\n296\n00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:36.380\nThis might be the virtualization issue,\nbut I want to look at some of the other\n\n297\n00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:40.080\noptions that they give you when it comes\nto managing your updates, all right.\n\n298\n00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.250\nChanging active hours, right.\n\n299\n00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:45.832\nWhen are you using your device,\nright, on the norm,\n\n300\n00:14:45.832 --> 00:14:48.150\nwhen are you normally using your device?\n\n301\n00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:51.740\nCuz we don't wanna install an update,\nand we don't wanna restart this machine\n\n302\n00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.840\nwithout checking to make sure that\nyou're using the machine first, right.\n\n303\n00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.600\nWe don't wanna lose any information.\n\n304\n00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.000\nSo that's nice that they give\nyou the option for active hours.\n\n305\n00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.410\nHow about the restart options, right?\n\n306\n00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:04.480\nWell, let's schedule a time, right.\n\n307\n00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.530\nLet's schedule it.\n\n308\n00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:06.230\nWe pick a time.\n\n309\n00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:10.990\nWell, maybe I'm not at my computer,\nI know, at 4 am, right.\n\n310\n00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.610\nHopefully I'm sleeping at 4 am [LAUGH],\nbut I'm not at my computer, right.\n\n311\n00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:18.730\nSo maybe I say, I'm gonna pick a time,\nit's gonna be 4 am.\n\n312\n00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:23.500\nAnd every week on Tuesday, or\nWednesday, I'll say Wednesday,\n\n313\n00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.270\nbecause a lot of times\nthe patches come out on Tuesday.\n\n314\n00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:27.090\nSo Wednesday we're prepared for them and\n\n315\n00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:30.097\nwe're gonna go and restart the machine\nafter they're applied, right.\n\n316\n00:15:30.097 --> 00:15:31.740\nHow about notifications?\n\n317\n00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.970\nWe can set a reminder, right.\n\n318\n00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:37.357\nNow, if we choose the back arrow,\nthe other thing that we have and\n\n319\n00:15:37.357 --> 00:15:41.545\nthis is something that's kinda new that\nI really, really like about Windows and\n\n320\n00:15:41.545 --> 00:15:44.700\nthat's what's known as\nthe Advanced Options, all right.\n\n321\n00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.541\nNow notice it says choose\nhow updates are installed,\n\n322\n00:15:47.541 --> 00:15:50.457\nremember we talked about\nMicrosoft products as well.\n\n323\n00:15:50.457 --> 00:15:53.880\nNotice it gives me updates for other\nMicrosoft products when I update Windows,.\n\n324\n00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:58.076\nSo this is the same setting and a little\nbit different of an interface, right?\n\n325\n00:15:58.076 --> 00:16:03.820\nPause updates, so I wanna pause updates\nfor this device up to 30 days, 35 days.\n\n326\n00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:06.020\nAnd again well,\nwe can defer them a little bit, right?\n\n327\n00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:10.120\nRemember, semi-annual targeted\nversus the semi-annual channel,\n\n328\n00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.620\nI can defer these updates for\na little bit too.\n\n329\n00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:18.490\nNotice that it tells me, how long I\ncan pause this updates, all right.\n\n330\n00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:20.940\nNow the other thing that we have too and\nthis is really, really cool.\n\n331\n00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:25.550\nI like this and\nthat's the delivery optimization.\n\n332\n00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:31.800\nWhat are the chances that you have another\nWindows 10 machine on your network,\n\n333\n00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:32.563\nall right?\n\n334\n00:16:32.563 --> 00:16:36.006\nThe chances are pretty likely that you\nmight have another Windows 10 machine.\n\n335\n00:16:36.006 --> 00:16:36.602\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n336\n00:16:36.602 --> 00:16:37.307\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n337\n00:16:37.307 --> 00:16:38.595\n&gt;&gt; You might have to get four of them.\n\n338\n00:16:38.595 --> 00:16:41.268\n&gt;&gt; There you go, okay, so\nwhat if you have, let's go and\n\n339\n00:16:41.268 --> 00:16:42.875\ntake your example, all right.\n\n340\n00:16:42.875 --> 00:16:47.740\nZac has four Windows 10 machines\non his network at home, all right.\n\n341\n00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:52.103\nThree of those computers have all\nupdated their machines, all right.\n\n342\n00:16:52.103 --> 00:16:55.442\nA fourth machine needs to update,\nmaybe Zach has it turned off for a while,\n\n343\n00:16:55.442 --> 00:16:57.350\nmaybe he's been over the road for a while.\n\n344\n00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.960\nComes home, turns the machine on and\nsees that there's updates.\n\n345\n00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:05.470\nWouldn't it be nice to save a little of\nthat bandwidth rather than reaching out to\n\n346\n00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:06.160\nthe Internet and\n\n347\n00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.950\npulling the updates from the Windows\nupdate servers to this computer?\n\n348\n00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.649\nWouldn't it be nice if Zach's computer,\nthat he needs to update, calls out to\n\n349\n00:17:14.649 --> 00:17:18.304\nthe local network and says, hey,\nyou are all friends out here, Windows 10.\n\n350\n00:17:18.304 --> 00:17:18.927\nI don't know if it really says that.\n\n351\n00:17:18.927 --> 00:17:21.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just, kumbaya!\n\n352\n00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.900\nSays I see, you've got an update that I\nneed, you've got an update that I need and\n\n353\n00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:26.340\nyou've got an update that I need.\n\n354\n00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:29.110\nWell, you know what, let's not even\ntalk to the Windows update servers,\n\n355\n00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:32.350\nlet's save Zach some of his bandwidth,\nright?\n\n356\n00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:34.226\nProbably for\none of his kids playing online games.\n\n357\n00:17:34.226 --> 00:17:35.062\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n358\n00:17:35.062 --> 00:17:37.082\n&gt;&gt; So he can still get the highest score,\nright?\n\n359\n00:17:37.082 --> 00:17:38.300\nAnd we'll go ahead and\n\n360\n00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:42.791\nwe'll optimize the delivery in this update\nby taking the portion of it from another\n\n361\n00:17:42.791 --> 00:17:46.594\ncomputer on your local network\nwithout going out to Windows updates.\n\n362\n00:17:46.594 --> 00:17:47.280\n&gt;&gt; That's great.\n\n363\n00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.790\n&gt;&gt; It's very, very cool.\n\n364\n00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:50.448\nBut maybe that's not highly optimized.\n\n365\n00:17:50.448 --> 00:17:53.910\nMaybe you got one that's got a portion\nof the updates that you need, but\n\n366\n00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:55.750\nit doesn't have all\nthe updates that you need.\n\n367\n00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:56.610\nWell, that's okay.\n\n368\n00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:58.830\nWe can change it to PCs on\nmy local network, optimize,\n\n369\n00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:01.681\ngive me anything locally I can before\nyou chew up my bandwidth reaching\n\n370\n00:18:01.681 --> 00:18:04.800\nout across the Internet and pulling it\ndown from the Windows update server.\n\n371\n00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.770\n&gt;&gt; That is awesome.\n\n372\n00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:10.070\n&gt;&gt; So now we can say check the local\nPCs and check the Internet too.\n\n373\n00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:13.156\nSo if you get to a certain point\nwhere computer one, two and three,\n\n374\n00:18:13.156 --> 00:18:16.372\nthey had portions of the updates\nthat I need, but we're optimized.\n\n375\n00:18:16.372 --> 00:18:18.990\nI pulled all those over,\nyou don't have everything I need.\n\n376\n00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:21.309\nNow I'm gonna go out and\nfinish the rest at Windows update, so\n\n377\n00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:23.170\nyou get kinda both of them.\n\n378\n00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:24.480\nVery, very cool.\n\n379\n00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.150\nAll right, now,\nother things that we can do.\n\n380\n00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:30.590\nSo [LAUGH] what I like about this,\nlet me see.\n\n381\n00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:34.980\nSo here is, I gotta point this out and\nI'm kinda joking.\n\n382\n00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.070\nMaybe you guys will find\nthe humor in this, all right.\n\n383\n00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:39.320\nSo this is the advanced options.\n\n384\n00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:42.930\nThen we go into delivery optimization and\nwe have advanced options.\n\n385\n00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:46.260\nSo these are the advanced\nadvanced options.\n\n386\n00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:47.180\n&gt;&gt;

So but all joking aside,\ncheck this out.\n\n390\n00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:55.940\nWhen we go into advanced options,\nhow about bandwidth throttling?\n\n391\n00:18:55.940 --> 00:19:00.570\nHow about being able to say\nZach's son right now is,\n\n392\n00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.400\nlet's say, playing a game, right?\n\n393\n00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.340\nAnd it's his allocated time.\n\n394\n00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:05.300\nMan, he has earned it.\n\n395\n00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:07.138\nZach says, that's your time,\nyou've earned it.\n\n396\n00:19:07.138 --> 00:19:12.140\nSo I wanna go ahead and I'm gonna\ndownload my updates cuz I need to work.\n\n397\n00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:15.760\nBut I don't want it to chew up\nall the bandwidth on my network.\n\n398\n00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.600\nWell, that's okay, look at this.\n\n399\n00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.770\nLimit how much badwidth is used for\ndownloading updates in the background.\n\n400\n00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:22.990\nI turn this on and I say,\n\n401\n00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:28.750\nI only want you to use 20% of my\nbandwidth to do your updates, all right.\n\n402\n00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:30.800\nWell, what about other computers?\n\n403\n00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.610\nRemember the three computers that were on\nZach's network that had the updates that\n\n404\n00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:34.140\nI needed?\n\n405\n00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:38.010\nWell, maybe I wanna limit how\nmuch bandwidth is used for\n\n406\n00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.310\nuploading updates to other PCs.\n\n407\n00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:43.720\nThis is the PCs that are delivering out,\nall right.\n\n408\n00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:49.780\nAnd then, once that limit,\nmonthly upload limit is reached, cap it.\n\n409\n00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:55.050\nAnd show me in a pie graph\nof how far I am to that cap.\n\n410\n00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:56.440\nI really like this setting.\n\n411\n00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:00.860\nI pick on the Windows as\na service a little bit but\n\n412\n00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.260\nI understand absolutely\nwhy they're doing it.\n\n413\n00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:07.090\nEvery other operating system,\nLinux does this, it updates twice a year.\n\n414\n00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:13.630\nMac, well, Mac updates all the time but\nthe fact that they give you this\n\n415\n00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:17.763\ngranularity of how they are optimized-\n&gt;&gt; They do.\n\n416\n00:20:17.763 --> 00:20:19.562\n&gt;&gt; It's something that's new, all right?\n\n417\n00:20:19.562 --> 00:20:25.056\nNow, I know we're running a little\nbit short on time let's go back over\n\n418\n00:20:25.056 --> 00:20:31.388\nto our machine here and let's see if that\nupdate that we restarted on has applied.\n\n419\n00:20:31.388 --> 00:20:34.173\nSo we'll log back in your machine,\nit restarted here.\n\n420\n00:20:37.774 --> 00:20:38.931\nAll right.\n\n421\n00:20:38.931 --> 00:20:42.619\nAnd was it successful?\n\n422\n00:20:42.619 --> 00:20:43.323\nI think it was.\n\n423\n00:20:43.323 --> 00:20:43.884\nI logged back in.\n\n424\n00:20:43.884 --> 00:20:45.325\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm not sure.\n\n425\n00:20:45.325 --> 00:20:47.140\nThat's why we manage our history, right?\n\n426\n00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.890\nWe find out.\n\n427\n00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:50.040\nBut we updated, all right.\n\n428\n00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:53.080\nSo we're gonna go back and there is my\nthought bubble covering it up just under\n\n429\n00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.790\nmy end notice it says, your computer was\nrestarted to finish installing updates.\n\n430\n00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:58.390\nClick to see which updates were installed.\n\n431\n00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:01.640\nI'd clicked that and\nsee it fast before it disappears, right.\n\n432\n00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.701\nAnd it brings us back to our update\nhistory inside of Windows update when we\n\n433\n00:21:04.701 --> 00:21:06.070\nwere looking at that long,\n\n434\n00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.850\nlonger list of the different\nupdates that we have, all right.\n\n435\n00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.072\nWell, there it is, successful, right?\n\n436\n00:21:12.072 --> 00:21:13.600\nAnd it was installed today.\n\n437\n00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.920\nAnd in fact,\nwe can see the optional ones, all right?\n\n438\n00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:23.330\nNow this is how to successfully manage\nyour updates and it is very important.\n\n439\n00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:28.490\nIt is something that is part\nof the patch management.\n\n440\n00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:30.800\nAnd you have to be aware of this for\nthe exam.\n\n441\n00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:34.900\nIt's important to understand that\nthe way we update Windows 7 and\n\n442\n00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.790\nWindows 8 and 8.1 is fairly the same.\n\n443\n00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:39.430\nThen to Windows 10,\n\n444\n00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:44.180\nit's a lot different when it comes to\nupdating your Windows 10 machines, right?\n\n445\n00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:46.220\nRemember Windows is a service.\n\n446\n00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:50.120\nIt is an important thing to keep in\nmind that the servicing channels and\n\n447\n00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:53.404\nsome of those different features that\nyou have when it comes to peeking in and\n\n448\n00:21:53.404 --> 00:21:56.430\ntweaking how those updates were\ndelivered over your network.\n\n449\n00:21:56.430 --> 00:22:00.190\n&gt;&gt; So Wes, what happens if there's\na problem with an update, maybe you don't\n\n450\n00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:05.112\nlike that update, maybe it's causing some\nkind of an issue, can you roll it back?\n\n451\n00:22:05.112 --> 00:22:07.454\n&gt;&gt; I tell you what,\nyou save the best for last, right,\n\n452\n00:22:07.454 --> 00:22:10.719\nbecause we've been talking about\napplying the updates the whole time.\n\n453\n00:22:10.719 --> 00:22:14.733\nAnd man, I tell you, what happens if\nyou do apply a patch to a system and\n\n454\n00:22:14.733 --> 00:22:16.060\nit causes a problem?\n\n455\n00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.050\nIt becomes problematic.\n\n456\n00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:18.060\nThat happens.\n\n457\n00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:22.540\nThat's the reason we say patch management,\nall right.\n\n458\n00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:26.660\nAnd when we talk about patch management,\nwe actually have some management tools and\n\n459\n00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.720\nthen we'll get into how we\ncould roll back, right?\n\n460\n00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.705\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Why is patch management systems\n\n461\n00:22:31.705 --> 00:22:32.790\nimportant, right?\n\n462\n00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:39.440\nWhy do we have a patch management\nbest practices in place?\n\n463\n00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.780\nWell, we wanna be able\nto review those updates.\n\n464\n00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.370\nWe wanna be able to test those updates.\n\n465\n00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:49.340\nWe wanna be able to deploy those\nupdates and how we deploy them is very,\n\n466\n00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:50.650\nvery important, all right?\n\n467\n00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:52.000\nSo how about this?\n\n468\n00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.166\nWe'll talk about some of the management\nutilities that we have because I wanna\n\n469\n00:22:56.166 --> 00:22:57.113\nmention those and\n\n470\n00:22:57.113 --> 00:23:00.663\nthen we'll show you exactly how we\nkind of get out of the jail free.\n\n471\n00:23:00.663 --> 00:23:02.587\nThe get out of jail free card-\n&gt;&gt;

Mm-hm.\n\n529\n00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:10.150\n&gt;&gt; Boy, we've got a lot of them.\n\n530\n00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:10.740\nThere we go.\n\n531\n00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:14.420\nThat I was gonna say cuz I thought\nwe had a lot more in this.\n\n532\n00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:20.630\nNotice that I wanna find out,\nI wanna maybe uninstall one of these.\n\n533\n00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:22.710\nSome of them can't be uninstalled.\n\n534\n00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:24.780\nI will show you that.\n\n535\n00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:27.890\nNotice this, I can't uninstall that.\n\n536\n00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:30.770\nBut this one, I can,\nin fact let me see, can I uninstall?\n\n537\n00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:32.640\nI can't uninstall Silverlight.\n\n538\n00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:37.128\nI'll tell you what, let's go ahead,\nnow I'm gonna uninstall this one for\n\n539\n00:26:37.128 --> 00:26:40.732\n.NET framework 4.7.1.\n\n540\n00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:44.580\nAnd I wanna take a second here and\nI wanna mention.\n\n541\n00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:47.770\nBecause we've some viewers in the chatroom\nthat have been mentioning these KBs.\n\n542\n00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:52.580\nAnd I wanna do you\nviewers some justice here\n\n543\n00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:55.745\nbecause if you can't see our\nchat room right now right?\n\n544\n00:26:55.745 --> 00:26:57.775\nKBs are knowledge bases and\n\n545\n00:26:57.775 --> 00:27:01.945\nif I need to know a little bit more\nabout this update and what it does I can\n\n546\n00:27:01.945 --> 00:27:06.641\nalways refer to the knowledge base with\nMicrosoft by plugging in KB4074880.\n\n547\n00:27:06.641 --> 00:27:07.637\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n548\n00:27:07.637 --> 00:27:12.445\n&gt;&gt; And I can find out exactly what\nthis applies to and what it does.\n\n549\n00:27:12.445 --> 00:27:14.275\nSo remember your knowledge\nbase solutions too.\n\n550\n00:27:14.275 --> 00:27:17.905\nBut the next thing that I'm gonna do is\njust walk through the uninstall wizard.\n\n551\n00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:22.980\nAnd it uninstalls the update\nthat has been applied.\n\n552\n00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.680\n&gt;&gt; As if it never even happened.\n\n553\n00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.270\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n554\n00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:25.770\nThat's right.\n\n555\n00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:27.660\nJust like the CIA, this doesn't exist.\n\n556\n00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:28.910\nI was never here.\n\n557\n00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:30.510\nI don't care what the camera says.\n\n558\n00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:31.060\nIt lies.\n&gt;&gt;

And\nthat's like the go back of yesterday.\n\n572\n00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:04.830\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what it is.\n\n573\n00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:06.780\nAnd let me show you here real quick.\n\n574\n00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:10.110\nGo to Start, right-click on Computer.\n\n575\n00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:11.080\nChoose Properties.\n\n576\n00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:16.390\nWe have this\nAdvanced System Settings here.\n\n577\n00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:18.600\nI've been in Windows 7 for awhile.\n\n578\n00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.980\nLet me switch over to\nour Windows 8.1 machine.\n\n579\n00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:23.115\nAs you see that it is installing\nsome of those updates here,\n\n580\n00:28:23.115 --> 00:28:24.320\nprobably it won't be finished.\n\n581\n00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:28.742\nBut, if I right-click on the Windows\ntile and again choose System,\n\n582\n00:28:28.742 --> 00:28:31.147\nthis will take me into\nthe system Control panel.\n\n583\n00:28:31.147 --> 00:28:35.520\nAnd you can see it's pretty much the same\nas what we've seen in Windows 7.\n\n584\n00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.758\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And I choose Advanced settings and\n\n585\n00:28:37.758 --> 00:28:39.120\nSystem Protection.\n\n586\n00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.100\nNotice the System Restore option.\n\n587\n00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:46.140\nIf I choose System Restore and I don't\nknow if it's gonna let me start this well\n\n588\n00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:49.300\nit's installing updates, but\nyou can at least see this.\n\n589\n00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:51.480\nI could start the restore process.\n\n590\n00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:55.640\nNotice that there's an automatic, and\nit doesn't look like this one has\n\n591\n00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.338\nany cuz there's not a lot of\npatch management on this one.\n\n592\n00:28:58.338 --> 00:28:59.580\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; What I wanna show you is,\n\n593\n00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:01.850\nwe'll switch over to\nour Windows 7 machine.\n\n594\n00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:05.250\nBecause I've done so much patch\nmanagement on this Windows 7 box.\n\n595\n00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:08.890\nChoosing advance system settings and\n\n596\n00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:11.120\nthat's almost done there,\nit might take a second here.\n\n597\n00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:16.790\nIn advance system settings what we're\ngonna end up seeing is that when you have\n\n598\n00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:21.090\nsystem protection turned on,\nbefore an update happens, there you go,\n\n599\n00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:24.660\nit's kind of bogging down a little cause\nI got more than one thing going on here.\n\n600\n00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:27.584\nAnd if I go to System Protection and\nit's gonna take a second,\n\n601\n00:29:27.584 --> 00:29:31.033\nit's going to search the drives that\nhave system protection turned on.\n\n602\n00:29:31.033 --> 00:29:35.754\nAnd I choose System Restore, it launches\nthe System Restore software and\n\n603\n00:29:35.754 --> 00:29:39.860\nlet's go ahead and\nlaunch it and we choose next.\n\n604\n00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:41.900\nAnd I want you to see something here.\n\n605\n00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:46.662\nSo Zach, to answer your question that\nyou asked a while ago, I know the long,\n\n606\n00:29:46.662 --> 00:29:49.029\nscenic approach to get to the answer.\n\n607\n00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:52.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What we have here is a Windows update.\n\n608\n00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.310\nSo what happens is,\nI apply an update to a machine.\n\n609\n00:29:55.310 --> 00:30:00.570\nBefore that happens, Windows will use\nsystem restore, provided system protection\n\n610\n00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:06.110\nis turned on, to create a point in time\nsnapshot of the system configuration.\n\n611\n00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:10.823\nSo that if you apply this update and\nit causes a problem, I can launch another\n\n612\n00:30:10.823 --> 00:30:15.392\nrecovery environment, I can choose\nsystem restore more specifically,\n\n613\n00:30:15.392 --> 00:30:19.390\na restore point to the time prior\nto the update being installed.\n\n614\n00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:24.574\nAnd when I applied the system\nrestore it is going to undo or\n\n615\n00:30:24.574 --> 00:30:28.246\nin this case for me it's gonna restore,\n\n616\n00:30:28.246 --> 00:30:33.330\nbecause remember what I did\nis I uninstalled an update?\n\n617\n00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:36.720\nWell, guess what, when I uninstalled\nthat .NET framework update it said,\n\n618\n00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:37.260\nwell wait a second.\n\n619\n00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:39.120\nYou're gonna uninstall an update?\n\n620\n00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.710\nLet me create a restore point.\n\n621\n00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:42.190\nJust in case you want to\nuninstall that update,\n\n622\n00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:44.450\nsomething goes wrong,\nyou wanna be able to restore it.\n\n623\n00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:49.080\nSo in this case, if I use Restore Point,\nit actually wouldn't uninstall the update.\n\n624\n00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.370\nIt would bring the one\nthat I deleted back.\n\n625\n00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:53.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So you gotta make sure\n\n626\n00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:55.950\nyou're choosing the right Restore Point.\n\n627\n00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:59.830\nLet me go ahead and just cancel this\nout and hopefully we can get a second,\n\n628\n00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:01.330\nI can show you the other one.\n\n629\n00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:05.820\nSo you just choose the appropriate\nupdate or restore point, excuse me.\n\n630\n00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:08.159\nAnd then you restore to\nthat earlier point in time.\n\n631\n00:31:08.159 --> 00:31:10.820\nAnd what that does is it\nuninstalls the update.\n\n632\n00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:13.460\nBe careful with the restore point though,\nbecause I will tell you,\n\n633\n00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:19.220\nlike you can see right here, sometimes\nif you're uninstalling an update and\n\n634\n00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.760\nyou use a system restore point,\nit actually puts it back.\n\n635\n00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:24.920\nSo you have to make sure that\nyou do what we've done here and\n\n636\n00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:30.240\nwe try to find out hey,\nwhich of these programs will be affected.\n\n637\n00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:35.850\nLet me go ahead and\nchange back a little bit further.\n\n638\n00:31:37.098 --> 00:31:43.090\nAnd, yeah, okay,\nhere's what's happening here, because\n\n639\n00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:49.600\nboth of these restore points were created\nprior to me uninstalling that update.\n\n640\n00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.820\nBoth of these restore points\nstill have that update included.\n\n641\n00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:54.650\nAnd that's why it's\ntelling me if I restore.\n\n642\n00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:57.200\nAll that work that you just did you've\njust installed that update yeah we're\n\n643\n00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.160\ngonna put it back.\n\n644\n00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:03.000\nSo either way it works when you update\nyour system it creates a restore point so\n\n645\n00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.440\nthat you can go back to\nan earlier point in time.\n\n646\n00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:09.720\nWhen you uninstall an update,\nit creates a restore point.\n\n647\n00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.910\nSo should that be problematic?\n\n648\n00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:14.065\nAgain you can roll back\nto an earlier point.\n\n649\n00:32:14.065 --> 00:32:16.440\n&gt;&gt; And Wes,\ncan you create your own restore point?\n\n650\n00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.010\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you can, and in fact and\n\n651\n00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:21.330\nwe're going to show system\nrestore here in another episode.\n\n652\n00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:23.930\nBut let me go a head,\nthis is not gonna hurt anything out and\n\n653\n00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:27.630\nit looks like uninstallation is complete,\nbut yes I could.\n\n654\n00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:31.450\nIf I wanted to come in here and\nmanually create one I could choose Create.\n\n655\n00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:37.910\nAnd I could say, uninstalling update.\n\n656\n00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:41.220\nNow, I don't have to this because\nthis are system generated ones but\n\n657\n00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:44.870\nif I want to be sure,\nI could create one myself.\n\n658\n00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:46.797\nAnd then at this point I could go on and\ninstall the update.\n\n659\n00:32:46.797 --> 00:32:49.955\nIt will probably still create one but\nif you wanna be sure,\n\n660\n00:32:49.955 --> 00:32:52.305\nyou've already created one before hand.\n\n661\n00:32:52.305 --> 00:32:54.870\nIf it becomes problematic you boot\ninto the recovery environment in\n\n662\n00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:55.682\nthe repair options.\n\n663\n00:32:55.682 --> 00:32:59.334\nYou choose system restore and\nyou restore to that earlier point in time.\n\n664\n00:32:59.334 --> 00:33:02.015\nThat update is problematic,\nit'll go away and\n\n665\n00:33:02.015 --> 00:33:05.660\nhopefully you'll resume with\nyour normal operations.\n\n666\n00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.920\nSo there we go we created a restore point\nsome of the things you need to know when\n\n667\n00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:10.120\nit comes to patch management and\n\n668\n00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:14.050\nconfiguring the updates inside of your\nsystem, keep in mind that when you do\n\n669\n00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:18.070\nuninstall some of these updates you\nmight have to restart your computer.\n\n670\n00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:21.640\nBut these are some of the things you need\nto know when it comes to your NTA exam.\n\n671\n00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:25.590\n&gt;&gt; Awesome job Wes configuring updates\npart two make sure you see part one inside\n\n672\n00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:28.340\nthe Windows OS Fundamentals series.\n\n673\n00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:30.070\nIn fact watch everything in this series.\n\n674\n00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:32.830\nYou'll be glad you did, you're in\nthe course library too, aren't you?\n\n675\n00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:35.562\nYes you are, and\nthere's thousands of videos there and\n\n676\n00:33:35.562 --> 00:33:38.543\nthey're all designed to do one\nthing to help you go further.\n\n677\n00:33:38.543 --> 00:33:43.047\nAnd tell everybody you know about\nITPRO.TV, ITPRO.TV is binge worthy.\n\n678\n00:33:43.047 --> 00:33:44.980\nThanks for watching, I'm Zack Memos.\n\n679\n00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:45.590\n&gt;&gt;
