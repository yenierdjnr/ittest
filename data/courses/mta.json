          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:06,268\n[SOUND]\n\n2\n00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:11,114\nThe Microsoft Technical Associate\ncertification is one\n\n3\n00:00:11,114 --> 00:00:14,150\nof the newer certifications to come from,\nwell, Microsoft.\n\n4\n00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,120\nThat's, that's the whole name.\n\n5\n00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:16,745\n[LAUGH].\n\n6\n00:00:16,745 --> 00:00:19,935\nIt's the MTA, and it's a great\nnew certification designed for\n\n7\n00:00:19,935 --> 00:00:23,485\npeople that are just getting\nstarted in the world of IT.\n\n8\n00:00:23,485 --> 00:00:26,545\nThere's some really big certification\nnames that are out there,\n\n9\n00:00:26,545 --> 00:00:31,917\nlike Cisco's CCNA or Microsoft's MCSE,\nand those names are ubiquitous.\n\n10\n00:00:31,917 --> 00:00:36,370\nEverybody knows about them any kind of\nHR manager or hiring consultant is,\n\n11\n00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,895\nis gonna recognize those\ncertifications and\n\n12\n00:00:38,895 --> 00:00:42,043\nthey bring a lot of value\nto you as an IT worker.\n\n13\n00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:45,123\nBut if you're just getting started,\nthose certifications are pretty hard.\n\n14\n00:00:45,123 --> 00:00:48,853\nThere's a lot of information in there and\nthey really do expect you to have\n\n15\n00:00:48,853 --> 00:00:53,363\nsome real world experience already before\nyou jump into those certifications.\n\n16\n00:00:53,363 --> 00:00:57,517\nSo, if you're just getting started in IT,\nif you've got a resume\n\n17\n00:00:57,517 --> 00:01:02,430\npacked full of other things, not IT jobs,\nhow do you, how do you get in there?\n\n18\n00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,949\nYou can't just jump to those\nhigh level certifications.\n\n19\n00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,490\nAnd so\nthat's where the Microsoft MTA comes in.\n\n20\n00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,398\nIt's designed for people who don't\nnecessarily have even a single moment of\n\n21\n00:01:13,398 --> 00:01:15,524\nfield experience working in IT.\n\n22\n00:01:15,524 --> 00:01:19,655\nBut you can get in there, work with,\nwork with the technology, learn it,\n\n23\n00:01:19,655 --> 00:01:21,820\ntake the test and get certified.\n\n24\n00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,710\nAnd it shows that you have a basic\nlevel of, of skill, not just with,\n\n25\n00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,770\nwith basic computer literacy but\nalso with working and\n\n26\n00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,270\nsupporting Windows desktop\noperating systems.\n\n27\n00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,940\nSo, this is really the first step for\nsomebody entering the IT,\n\n28\n00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,680\njust career field in general,\ncuz you'll jump into things like a help\n\n29\n00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,370\ndesk position, some kind of desktop\nsupport, maybe a field repair technician.\n\n30\n00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,350\nAnd this base level experience is,\nis what you need just to get started.\n\n31\n00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,100\n>> Yeah.\n\n32\n00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,310\nBasic knowledge is what we're hoping to\nconvey with the Microsoft technology.\n\n33\n00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,890\nWithout the field experience, you have to\nhave at least the foundational knowledge.\n\n34\n00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,920\nMicrosoft wants you to get ready for that.\n\n35\n00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,740\nAnd then, as you enter into the job\nmarket, you'll actually begin to\n\n36\n00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:04,120\nbuild more of your field experience and be\nready then for the other certifications,\n\n37\n00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,910\nthat are coming down the pipeline for\nyou as you get started in your IT career.\n\n38\n00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,360\nSo, that's what we're gonna be doing in\nthis series is helping you to build that\n\n39\n00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,860\nfoundational knowledge and\nunderstanding of the operating system.\n\n40\n00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,854\n>> And the other nice thing about\nthe MTA is if you're not certain, if,\n\n41\n00:02:18,854 --> 00:02:21,600\nif you don't know if IT is\nthe right career field for you and\n\n42\n00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,980\nyou just wanna test the waters, right,\nyou just wanna give it a shot, right?\n\n43\n00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,740\nMTA is a real low commitment.\n\n44\n00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,070\nIt's a small set of knowledge, so\n\n45\n00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,020\nit's not like you're having to deal with\nthese giant books of content, right?\n\n46\n00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,790\nSo, it's a pretty manageable\nset of information.\n\n47\n00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:39,110\nIt's one exam, and you pass that exam and\nyou get your certification.\n\n48\n00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,800\nSo, low commitment there too,\non the cost side.\n\n49\n00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,870\nThe exam, do you you remember Ronnie,\nis it 125 or-\n\n50\n00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,863\n>> About a $115.\n\n51\n00:02:44,863 --> 00:02:45,840\n>> 115.\nAll right.\n\n52\n00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,971\nSo, so in, in theory,\nyou study, you pay a $115,\n\n53\n00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:52,340\nyou pass the exam and\nyou get the certification.\n\n54\n00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,480\nAnd if you decide that IT is not right for\nyou, you're out a $115 and not so\n\n55\n00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,440\nbad, right?\n\n56\n00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,536\nSo, it is a great way to get started and,\nand see if IT is right for you.\n\n57\n00:03:01,536 --> 00:03:05,302\nOr if you know IT is right for you, but\nyou just don't have a lot of experience,\n\n58\n00:03:05,302 --> 00:03:07,530\nyou can jump in and knock it out.\n\n59\n00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,252\nNow, Microsoft introduced the MTA\nprogram a little over a year ago,\n\n60\n00:03:11,252 --> 00:03:15,249\nit hasn't been around all that long but\nit's been very very successful.\n\n61\n00:03:15,249 --> 00:03:20,082\nAnd they've expanded it quite a bit\nfrom the original two exams to now where\n\n62\n00:03:20,082 --> 00:03:22,880\nthere's nine different exams.\n\n63\n00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,360\nIt doesn't really matter\nwhich one you take,\n\n64\n00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,170\nall the MTA exams when you pass\none of them, you'd get your MTA.\n\n65\n00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,340\nSo, you need to look at\nthe ones that are available and\n\n66\n00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,500\nselect the one that's right for you.\n\n67\n00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,501\nHere at ITProTV, we've chosen\nthe operating system fundamentals exam.\n\n68\n00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:43,150\nAnd, and let me just pull this up here, I\nwanna show you guys the MTA hierarchy and,\n\n69\n00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,040\nand this is on Microsoft's website here.\n\n70\n00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,980\nI've just pulled up their, their MTA page.\n\n71\n00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,260\nAnd as we look at it,\nthey show the MTA certification tracks and\n\n72\n00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,905\nthey break it up into infrastructure,\ndatabase, developer.\n\n73\n00:03:55,905 --> 00:03:56,828\nAll right?\n\n74\n00:03:56,828 --> 00:04:00,060\nIf you wanna become a programmer\nworking with Visual Studio,\n\n75\n00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,820\nVisual Basic, Visual C Sharp,\nand all of that,\n\n76\n00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,970\nthey've got developer MTAs that you can\njump into and they list all of those.\n\n77\n00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:07,830\nThere's six of them.\n\n78\n00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,710\nThey've actually added\nsome since I've been here.\n\n79\n00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:13,880\nSo, each of these, you would just take\none of these, pass that exam, and\n\n80\n00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,354\nget your MTA.\n\n81\n00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:18,385\nIf you wanna be a database administrator,\nwell, that's a much smaller one,\n\n82\n00:04:18,385 --> 00:04:22,465\nthere's just one that covers\ngeneral database fundamentals.\n\n83\n00:04:22,465 --> 00:04:27,395\nBut for a normal IT worker, there's\ngonna be a sys admin, or help desk,\n\n84\n00:04:27,395 --> 00:04:30,265\nsome kind of support role,\neven a network engineer.\n\n85\n00:04:30,265 --> 00:04:33,825\nIt's IT infrastructure that we shoot for,\nand IT infrastructure's\n\n86\n00:04:33,825 --> 00:04:37,930\nreally what the majority of\nITProTV's content centers around.\n\n87\n00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:38,630\nAnd you'll see,\n\n88\n00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:44,180\nthere's four different tracks here, and\neach one of them is equally important.\n\n89\n00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,760\nIf you've gonna go into the IT field,\nyou really should have experience, or, or\n\n90\n00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,870\nknowledge in all four of these areas.\n\n91\n00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,160\nSo, no one is more\nimportant than the other.\n\n92\n00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,870\nWe have\nWindows Operating System Fundamentals,\n\n93\n00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,690\nwhat we're gonna cover here in this show.\n\n94\n00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,570\nWe've got Windows Server\nAdministration Fundamentals.\n\n95\n00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,400\nNow, what's the difference there?\n\n96\n00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,210\nWell, operating system fundamentals that's\nreally focused on the workstations on your\n\n97\n00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,340\nlaptop, and your desktop versus servers,\n\n98\n00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,440\nthat's where we get to the big\niron that's in the server room.\n\n99\n00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,270\nRight?\nWhat's actually providing our web\n\n100\n00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,290\nservices, email, and, and all of that.\n\n101\n00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:22,010\nIt's a little bit more advanced and I,\nI find generally, it's not appropriate for\n\n102\n00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,510\npeople that are just\ngetting started in IT.\n\n103\n00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,430\nNobody's gonna hire you to work on\ntheir servers if you have absolutely no\n\n104\n00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,105\nexperience, you normally need to\nget started a little bit smaller.\n\n105\n00:05:32,105 --> 00:05:35,840\nCuz if you break a server,\nyou can be affecting thousands of people\n\n106\n00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,400\nversus if you break a desktop,\nyou're just affecting one person, right?\n\n107\n00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,387\nSo, that's kind of why we've leaned\ntowards the operating system fundamentals\n\n108\n00:05:42,387 --> 00:05:44,390\nand not the server administration at,\nat that state.\n\n109\n00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,360\nNow, the remaining two aren't unimportant,\nright?\n\n110\n00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,770\nNetworking fundamentals, almost every\ncomputer these days is network.\n\n111\n00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,970\nYou need to be able to get out there and\ncommunicate with the internet and\n\n112\n00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,000\nother services, and\nnetwork fundamentals covers that.\n\n113\n00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,990\nAnd security fundamentals, right,\na, a, a week barely goes by\n\n114\n00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,170\nthat we don't hear about some major\ncompany having a security compromise.\n\n115\n00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,380\nSo, again, very, very important.\n\n116\n00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,100\nSo, why didn't we choose to cover those?\n\n117\n00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,660\nWell, in my opinion, and, and everybody's\nopinion is, is different and may vary.\n\n118\n00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,310\nBut in, in our opinion here at ITProTV\nthere are other certifications that\n\n119\n00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,990\ncover those areas in much more depth that\nare much more widely known, all right?\n\n120\n00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,940\nIf you pass this one exam,\nyou get your MTA.\n\n121\n00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:34,020\nIf you pass all four of these exams,\nyou still have just one MTA.\n\n122\n00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,740\nSo, on your resume, it doesn't really make\na difference as far as which ones you\n\n123\n00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,370\npass here, you just need to pass one.\n\n124\n00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:43,010\nAnd if you're just starting,\nthe Windows Operating System Fundamentals,\n\n125\n00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,470\nthat's really the best one.\n\n126\n00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,590\nThat's the one that, that gives\nyou the basic skills to get in and\n\n127\n00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,680\nstart to support systems.\n\n128\n00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,880\nIf you wanna go on, well, Windows server\nadministration, you'll learn all about\n\n129\n00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:01,430\nthat in the MCSA track, the Microsoft\nCertified Solutions Associate.\n\n130\n00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,986\nIs that right Ronnie?\n\n131\n00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:03,020\n>> Mm-hm, solutions associate, yep.\n\n132\n00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,010\n>> Okay [LAUGH].\nIt, it changed.\n\n133\n00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,330\nIt used to be the Microsoft\nCertified Systems Administrator and\n\n134\n00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,200\nthey changed the name so\nI get a little tongue-tied there.\n\n135\n00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,050\nBut the MCSA, and that's where\nyou're learning all the nitty-gritty\n\n136\n00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,180\ndetails about how to work on\nthe servers and general administration.\n\n137\n00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,350\nAnd the MCSA is a much\nbetter certification for\n\n138\n00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,390\nthat, and\nwe do cover that here at ITProTV.\n\n139\n00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,460\nOn the networking side, well,\nthere's the CompTIA Network+ and\n\n140\n00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,980\nthe Cisco CC enable, both of which\ncover networking in great detail.\n\n141\n00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,630\nAnd if you're gonna be a network engineer,\n\n142\n00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,710\nthose certifications are much better for\nthat.\n\n143\n00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:36,570\nAnd look a lot better on the resume,\nand so we cover that for networking.\n\n144\n00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:39,935\nAnd on the security side,\nthere's the CompTIA Security+,\n\n145\n00:07:39,935 --> 00:07:43,630\nwhich is internationally known,\nvery largely accepted as that\n\n146\n00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,360\nstarting point for somebody that's\ngonna be a security professional.\n\n147\n00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,920\nBut if you're starting out with no\nexperience, nobody's gonna hire you to be\n\n148\n00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,230\na security professional without some\nkind of resume to back that up.\n\n149\n00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,900\nIt's not a good starting point.\n\n150\n00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,630\nAnd so,\nwe chose to not cover the remaining three\n\n151\n00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:02,560\nbecause other certifications cover it and\n\n152\n00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,130\nare more widely known, and\ncover it in more depth and detail.\n\n153\n00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,440\nYou're certainly welcome to\npursue these certifications,\n\n154\n00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,840\nwe just don't necessarily\nfind a lot of value there.\n\n155\n00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,440\nSo, the Windows operating\nsystem fundamentals,\n\n156\n00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,260\nthat's the one that creates the value.\n\n157\n00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,720\nAnd so, that's what we're gonna\nbe covering here in this show.\n\n158\n00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,960\nOver the next series of episodes,\n\n159\n00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,610\nwe're gonna film all of the content\nthat's covered by that exam.\n\n160\n00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,680\nEverything that you need\nto know to go in there and\n\n161\n00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,550\npass the exam on your first shot and\nthat's, that's really what we hope.\n\n162\n00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,140\nWe want people to make sure\nthey have good comprehension,\n\n163\n00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:36,910\nunderstand the content, go in there and\npass, and kick off that IT career, right?\n\n164\n00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,380\nOnce you have this\ncertification under the belt,\n\n165\n00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,133\nyou're ready to rocket forward and\nmove in to the next one.\n\n166\n00:08:42,142 --> 00:08:45,235\nAll right, so let's, let's take\na look at that certification and\n\n167\n00:08:45,235 --> 00:08:46,384\nwhat to entail, right?\n\n168\n00:08:46,384 --> 00:08:49,808\nSo, here is the 98-349 exam.\n\n169\n00:08:49,808 --> 00:08:51,520\nThat's the examination number.\n\n170\n00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,560\nWhen you're ready to go and\npass this exam, you go to well,\n\n171\n00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,220\nPearson VUE is the company that\nadministers exams for Microsoft.\n\n172\n00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,550\nPearson VUE has centers\nall over the world.\n\n173\n00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:06,501\nYou just go to their website,\nwhich is VUE, VUE.com.\n\n174\n00:09:06,501 --> 00:09:10,264\nAnd when you go to the VUE website,\nthey'll have in here where you can pick\n\n175\n00:09:10,264 --> 00:09:13,864\nwhat vendor you're testing with and\nwe, we'll just say Microsoft.\n\n176\n00:09:13,864 --> 00:09:16,337\nIt'll be buried in here somewhere,\nthere we go.\n\n177\n00:09:16,337 --> 00:09:19,740\nAnd you can go in and\nstart to sign up for a Microsoft exam.\n\n178\n00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:25,900\nAnd you'll see there's the MTA exams, and\nyou'll be able to sign up and take it.\n\n179\n00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,986\nAll right?\nYou'll find a,\n\n180\n00:09:26,986 --> 00:09:28,540\na VUE center that is near you, right?\n\n181\n00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,855\nSo, so, there'll be one usually in your\ncity or a nearby city that you can go and\n\n182\n00:09:31,855 --> 00:09:32,840\ntake the exam at.\n\n183\n00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,410\nI think there's two or\nthree of them here in Gainesville and\n\n184\n00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:39,020\nwe're in a really small city, so\nthey're, they're all over the place.\n\n185\n00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,480\nBut you'll go and you'll take that exam.\n\n186\n00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,830\nNow, what do you need to know,\nright, what, what's covered.\n\n187\n00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,450\nWell, Microsoft publishes all\nthe information right here on\n\n188\n00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:52,397\ntheir 98-349 page, and let you know\nabout where you can take at VUE.\n\n189\n00:09:52,397 --> 00:09:55,383\nThey list Prometric, but\nthat's ending soon, right?\n\n190\n00:09:55,383 --> 00:09:57,008\nDo you remember, Ronnie [CROSSTALK],\nit, it's actually right here.\n\n191\n00:09:57,008 --> 00:09:57,597\n>> Yeah.\n\n192\n00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,310\n>> December 31st, 2014.\n\n193\n00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,340\nDepending on when you watch this video,\nthat may have already passed.\n\n194\n00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,570\nWhen we're shooting it right now,\n\n195\n00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,750\nif you're watching live,\nthat's a month from now.\n\n196\n00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,280\nSo, in about one month that's\nnot gonna be available anymore.\n\n197\n00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,550\nSo, you really need to\ntest with Pearson VUE.\n\n198\n00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,910\nBut they also list what's\ncovered on the exam.\n\n199\n00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,840\nAnd you'll see where they\ndivided it up into six sections.\n\n200\n00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,260\nEach one worth between 15 and\n20% of the exam.\n\n201\n00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,005\nAnd the exam questions are spread\nacross all these areas.\n\n202\n00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:30,000\nAll right, so Ronnie let,\nlet's do a quick review of these areas.\n\n203\n00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000\nKind of what's expected.\n\n204\n00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,010\nBecause for some of you guys sitting out\nthere, you might already know this stuff.\n\n205\n00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,610\nThis might not be the right\ncertification for you.\n\n206\n00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,430\nYou might already be beyond it.\n\n207\n00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,030\nRight?\n\n208\n00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,070\nDoesn't mean you couldn't go take\nthe exam and get the certification,\n\n209\n00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,170\nstill looks good on the resume,\n\n210\n00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,810\nbut you might choose to move\nto a more advanced one.\n\n211\n00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,198\nSo, let's, let's just kinda run down these\nand, and see what else is involved, right?\n\n212\n00:10:47,198 --> 00:10:49,720\n>> The first exam\nobjective that we have is,\n\n213\n00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,420\nunderstanding operating\nsystem configurations.\n\n214\n00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,480\nAnd this is where we get\ninto the operating system.\n\n215\n00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,487\nAnd we show you what you can do to\nmanipulate the operating system to change\n\n216\n00:10:58,487 --> 00:10:59,983\nit better to suit the user.\n\n217\n00:10:59,983 --> 00:11:02,293\nSo, that they can do\neverything that they need to.\n\n218\n00:11:02,293 --> 00:11:04,170\nSo, you'll see things like control panel.\n\n219\n00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:08,133\nAnd we're gonna take a look at some of the\ndesktop settings where we can change that\n\n220\n00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:11,143\nand make it look a little bit better,\nfor the user to be able to do.\n\n221\n00:11:11,143 --> 00:11:14,952\nAnd then, we are going to get underneath\na little bit and take look at the native\n\n222\n00:11:14,952 --> 00:11:18,302\ntools that are built in that allow\nus to configure what start's up and\n\n223\n00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,778\nsome different items there.\n\n224\n00:11:19,778 --> 00:11:20,544\n>> Yeah.\n\n225\n00:11:20,544 --> 00:11:24,354\nAnd you'll see a lot of things in here\nthat our, our regular end used might not\n\n226\n00:11:24,354 --> 00:11:27,355\nneed but as a support personnel,\nyou more than likely will.\n\n227\n00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:31,750\nNow, after that we move on to installing\nand upgrading plan systems, right?\n\n228\n00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,048\nWe might need to reinstall windows.\n\n229\n00:11:34,048 --> 00:11:35,928\nFor your average consumer,\nthey buy a laptop or\n\n230\n00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:38,870\ndesktop and it's already installed\non there and they're fine.\n\n231\n00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:42,390\nBut in a company environment, you'll\noftentimes have to erase a machine and\n\n232\n00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,670\nclean it up, you know,\nget a new install on there.\n\n233\n00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,370\nSo, we'll cover that process, right?\n\n234\n00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,110\nHow we can install it,\n\n235\n00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:50,130\nthe different versions of Windows\nthat we have to worry about,\n\n236\n00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:53,510\nhow to do upgrades if we're actually\nupgrading from one version to another.\n\n237\n00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:57,970\nAnd we'll even touch on virtualization\nwhich is a big hot topic\n\n238\n00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,470\nin the enterprise sector right now.\n\n239\n00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,690\nSo, that's our real neat section.\n\n240\n00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,170\n>> Our third exam objective\nis on managing applications.\n\n241\n00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,480\nWhen the applications programs that\nwe install in the system to help\n\n242\n00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,480\nus do something specific,\n\n243\n00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,810\nwe wanna make sure that you know\nhow to install the applications.\n\n244\n00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,330\nWe also wanna make sure that\nyou understand how to uninstall\n\n245\n00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,425\napplications if you need to.\n\n246\n00:12:16,425 --> 00:12:21,075\nAnd then, when we run into issues,\nwhat do we do when we actually do have\n\n247\n00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:23,795\napplications when, when they're not\nrunning the way that we need to?\n\n248\n00:12:23,795 --> 00:12:24,835\nSo, we'll take a brief look at that.\n\n249\n00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:27,255\n>> All right.\nAnd then, after that,\n\n250\n00:12:27,255 --> 00:12:29,095\nwe're gonna dive into managing files and\n\n251\n00:12:29,095 --> 00:12:32,098\nfolders which might sound like a,\na, a given.\n\n252\n00:12:32,098 --> 00:12:34,520\nMost people know how to copy or\npaste a file or\n\n253\n00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,790\nmove a file around on the hard drive.\n\n254\n00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:39,190\nBut we're gonna look at some other\nthings like permissions that can be set,\n\n255\n00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,810\ndifferent file systems file and\nprint sharing.\n\n256\n00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,290\nSo, sharing our, our data over a network.\n\n257\n00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,190\nAnd even disc encryption,\n\n258\n00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:50,600\nwhich is another important topic we're\nhearing a lot about in the news lately.\n\n259\n00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,415\nSo, we'll get a chance to see how to\nimplement those safely and securely.\n\n260\n00:12:54,415 --> 00:12:55,960\n>> Yeah.\n\n261\n00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,790\nOur fourth one is going\nto be managing devices.\n\n262\n00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,150\nThis is where we add in\nperipheral devices, or\n\n263\n00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:05,140\nthings like hard drives, how we actually\nstore data on those hard drives,\n\n264\n00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,510\nwhat do we need to make sure that\nwe're doing the, the proper storage.\n\n265\n00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,840\nAlso, how do we get data\nout of our computers?\n\n266\n00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,970\nWe'll talk about how we print and\n\n267\n00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:16,460\nwhat we need to do to make sure that\nwe print to the correct location, too.\n\n268\n00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,330\nAnd even other devices that we might\nfind that we have to get the operating\n\n269\n00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,050\nsystem to talk to.\n\n270\n00:13:21,105 --> 00:13:23,035\n>> And then, the very last\nsection is this guy right here,\n\n271\n00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:25,235\nunderstanding operating\nsystem maintenance.\n\n272\n00:13:25,235 --> 00:13:28,032\nAnd that says, just because your\ncomputer's running fine today,\n\n273\n00:13:28,032 --> 00:13:29,515\ndoesn't mean it will be tomorrow.\n\n274\n00:13:29,515 --> 00:13:33,970\nWe need to take some basic steps to keep\nour machines healthy and running smoothly.\n\n275\n00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:37,330\nSo, we'll see how to do backups and\nrecovery, in case we have a failure.\n\n276\n00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,110\nHow to do general maintenance\nto keep things running smooth.\n\n277\n00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,227\nAnd then, lastly,\n\n278\n00:13:41,227 --> 00:13:45,515\nprobably the most important section of\nthe whole certification is updates.\n\n279\n00:13:45,515 --> 00:13:49,182\nKeeping your system up to date and\npatched so that when there's a, a bug or\n\n280\n00:13:49,182 --> 00:13:52,259\na security exploit or\nwhatever that you're taking care of and\n\n281\n00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:55,650\nthat you don't get you're system\ncompromised or loose your data.\n\n282\n00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:02,455\nSo, all said and done, those six\nareas cover quite a bit of stuff.\n\n283\n00:14:02,455 --> 00:14:05,285\nAnd some of it is content\nthat you might already know,\n\n284\n00:14:05,285 --> 00:14:06,885\njust through your basic use of Windows.\n\n285\n00:14:06,885 --> 00:14:08,665\nAnd that's great,\nthat gives you a head start.\n\n286\n00:14:08,665 --> 00:14:11,865\nBut other parts might go beyond that\nto show things that we use in a,\n\n287\n00:14:11,865 --> 00:14:14,825\nin a work environment when\nyou have an IT career.\n\n288\n00:14:14,825 --> 00:14:18,265\nAnd that's the part that we need to study,\nmake sure we understand,\n\n289\n00:14:18,265 --> 00:14:21,095\nget some good comfort,\ncomfort, comfort level with.\n\n290\n00:14:21,095 --> 00:14:23,790\nAnd then, jump in there and\npass that exam.\n\n291\n00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:28,210\nNow, you're ready to go out and start\napplying for jobs that are help desk,\n\n292\n00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:32,440\nbasic support, computer repair,\nthose type of entry level jobs.\n\n293\n00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,010\nAnd I know it's not glorious, some people,\nsome of you guys out there might be saying\n\n294\n00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:39,070\nit right now like, I don't wanna do that,\nI wanna work on the server.\n\n295\n00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,280\nWell, that's great.\n\n296\n00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,150\nBut you gotta work up to that.\n\n297\n00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,670\nRight?\n\n298\n00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,460\nYou don't start at\na company as the president.\n\n299\n00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,320\nYou work your way up to\nbecome the president.\n\n300\n00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,240\nRight?\nAnd that's how it is in IT.\n\n301\n00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,890\nIf you wanna be a network engineer or\na systems engineer,\n\n302\n00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:55,430\nif you wanna be up at that higher level\ndesigning networks and supporting\n\n303\n00:14:55,430 --> 00:15:00,020\nthe overall big picture, you gotta work up\nto that, you've gotta get that experience.\n\n304\n00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,160\nThis is the starting point, right?\n\n305\n00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,250\nThis is where we begin, right?\n\n306\n00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,230\nThere, there is another certification\nthat we offer here on ITProTV\n\n307\n00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:09,320\ncalled the CompTIA IT Fundamentals.\n\n308\n00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,170\nIt is also a great starting point.\n\n309\n00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,330\nSo, kind of compares really\nwell to the MTA, but\n\n310\n00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:20,790\nthe big difference here is with the MTA,\nit is Microsoft only.\n\n311\n00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,377\nRight.\nWe're just looking at Windows, which,\n\n312\n00:15:23,377 --> 00:15:25,703\nover 80% of business computers run.\n\n313\n00:15:25,703 --> 00:15:28,700\nSo, you definitely,\nit's something that you want to learn.\n\n314\n00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,750\nBut if you also wanna learn about other\noperating systems, like Mac OS or\n\n315\n00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,900\nLinux, well the CompTIA IT Fundamentals\nis vendor neutral.\n\n316\n00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:41,270\nSo, it covers some of those\nother OS's too, gives you that,\n\n317\n00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,230\nthat more broad view, right?\n\n318\n00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:47,030\nEven though, even though Linux desktops\nmake up very small percentage of business\n\n319\n00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:51,750\nmachines and Mac desktops are even smaller\nyou know that, that changes over time.\n\n320\n00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,460\nAnd who knows, maybe five years from now,\nLinux will be the number one desktop, or\n\n321\n00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,880\nMac will be the number one desktop.\n\n322\n00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,060\nThings change, right?\n\n323\n00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,650\nSo, it is a good idea to see that one.\n\n324\n00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:03,090\nAnd it's a good idea to do that\ncertification in addition to this one.\n\n325\n00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,570\nYou may do both, but it's,\nit's entirely up to you.\n\n326\n00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:09,800\nSo, if you haven't checked out CompTIA IT\nFundamentals, you might wanna review that.\n\n327\n00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,480\nYou know, we, we did an overview\nvideo just like this for it.\n\n328\n00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,680\nReview that and see which one is right for\nyou to start with,\n\n329\n00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,220\nif you just wanna do one or\ndo both, you know?\n\n330\n00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,819\nBoth of them are fairly small sets of,\nof information,\n\n331\n00:16:20,819 --> 00:16:23,817\neasy to study for and\ngreat way to get started.\n\n332\n00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:27,200\nAll right, well, if all of that sounds\nexciting to you, I hope it does,\n\n333\n00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,260\nwe're excited to jump in and do it.\n\n334\n00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,500\nAnd so, we are in the right place, right?\n\n335\n00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,600\nWe're ready to jump into our episodes and\nwe hope to see you there.\n\n336\n00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,980\nIf this doesn't sound right for\nyou, don't feel bad, right?\n\n337\n00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,240\nNot every certification is for\n\n338\n00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,260\neveryone, and just keep looking for\nthe one that's right for you.\n\n339\n00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:47,096\nIf you have any questions, right, if,\nif any of this isn't certain to you or, or\n\n340\n00:16:47,096 --> 00:16:48,880\nwhatever, feel free to ask us.\n\n341\n00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,770\nIf you're an ITProTV subscriber,\n\n342\n00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:53,090\nyou can always go to the Q&A forums and\npost there.\n\n343\n00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:56,320\nYou'll see the link that says\nQ&A at the top of every page.\n\n344\n00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,470\nYou can click on that, post your questions\nthere and we monitor and answer.\n\n345\n00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:02,520\nAnd we kind, kinda help, give you\nguidance or suggestions, recommendations.\n\n346\n00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,010\nWhatever it is that we can do to help.\n\n347\n00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:09,290\nIf you're not an ITProTV member yet, then\nyou won't be able to use the Q&A forums.\n\n348\n00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:13,260\nSo, instead, if you're just not certain,\nshoot us a support ticket.\n\n349\n00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,920\nThere's a contact us link at\nthe bottom of every page and\n\n350\n00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,740\nyou can use that to open up\na support ticket and say, hey I'm,\n\n351\n00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:22,210\nI'm thinking about subscribing and\nI'm just uncertain about this, or this.\n\n352\n00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,410\nAnd we'll, we'll help you out.\n\n353\n00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,063\nWe'll make sure you get the information\nyou need to be successful.\n\n354\n00:17:26,063 --> 00:17:29,465\nIt's really important you pick\nthe right certifications to,\n\n355\n00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,736\nto start with cuz if you pick\nthe wrong ones at the beginning,\n\n356\n00:17:32,736 --> 00:17:35,299\nit can really set you up for\na, a tough time, and\n\n357\n00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:37,813\nyou can get kind of disenfranchised or-\n>> Overwhelmed.\n\n358\n00:17:37,813 --> 00:17:38,811\n>> Whatever.\nYeah.\n\n359\n00:17:38,811 --> 00:17:39,890\nYou, you get overwhelmed.\n\n360\n00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,785\nAnd then, then, you say,\nIT is not right for me.\n\n361\n00:17:42,785 --> 00:17:45,565\nAnd it could have been great, you could\nhave a really wonderful career there.\n\n362\n00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,245\nAnd you just started\noff on the wrong foot.\n\n363\n00:17:47,245 --> 00:17:49,965\nSo, you know,\nwe definitely wanna help with that.\n\n364\n00:17:49,965 --> 00:17:50,875\nAll right.\nWell,\n\n365\n00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,277\nwe're excited to get into the episode.\n\n366\n00:17:52,277 --> 00:17:53,683\nSo, enough stalling around.\n\n367\n00:17:53,683 --> 00:17:58,920\nStay tuned, we've got MTA episodes\ncoming up and we'll see you then.\n\n368\n00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:04,789\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.306 --> 00:00:13.811\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n5\n00:00:13.811 --> 00:00:16.330\nWelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.200\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.850\nToday's episode, well, we're moving\nforward with more on our MTA track.\n\n8\n00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.640\nThat's right, the good old 98-349 exam,\nthat's what we're here for.\n\n9\n00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.210\nAnd joining us today to help us out with\na little bit on the Control Panel options,\n\n10\n00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.560\nour good friend Mr Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.120\nWes, welcome back sir,\nhow's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.680\n&gt;&gt; Man it's going great, as always great\nto be here in the studios with ITProTV.\n\n13\n00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.660\nThat's right, we're gonna be looking\nat an interface I should say.\n\n14\n00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.310\nI can't say utility cuz it's actually\na collection of utilities but\n\n15\n00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.510\nwe're gonna look at one of\nthe primary interfaces that you use\n\n16\n00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.720\ninside of the Windows\noperating system world.\n\n17\n00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.590\nAnd what do we use this interface for?\n\n18\n00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.630\nWell, a ton of things.\n\n19\n00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.350\nJust about every thing\nthat we can configure,\n\n20\n00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.660\nwe can do from the Control Panel.\n\n21\n00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.440\nNow, we're gonna look at some of the, more\nspecifically some of the administrative\n\n22\n00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.330\ntools that are inside of\nthe Control Panel today.\n\n23\n00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.310\nWe're gonna look at specifically\nconfiguring administrative tools.\n\n24\n00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.380\nNow, I'm sure you might be asking, well,\n\n25\n00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.310\nwhat is Control Panel to begin with and\nwhat are administrative tools?\n\n26\n00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.440\nSo let's go ahead and let's just show\nyou a little bit about the Control Panel\n\n27\n00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.730\nfirst, and then we'll dive in a little\nbit more specifics, if you will.\n\n28\n00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.132\nSo I've got my Windows 10 machine here,\nand we're right here on the desktop.\n\n29\n00:01:22.132 --> 00:01:23.736\nNow, if we want to get to Control Panel,\n\n30\n00:01:23.736 --> 00:01:25.540\nthere's a couple of ways\nthat we can do this.\n\n31\n00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.220\nOne of the easiest ways to get to\nthe Control Panel today is this\n\n32\n00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.620\nadministrative quicklinks menu.\n\n33\n00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.410\nAnd if I right click on it,\nall I have to do,\n\n34\n00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.820\nyou can see in this list,\nis the Control Panel.\n\n35\n00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.700\nAnd we can launch it up from here,\nall right.\n\n36\n00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.330\nNow this is your Control Panel and\nit really hasn't changed much in about,\n\n37\n00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.870\nI wanna say, about four operating systems.\n\n38\n00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.777\nGoing back to XP Windows 7,\nWindows 8, and 8.1 and\n\n39\n00:01:51.777 --> 00:01:56.420\nthen finally we've got Windows 10 here, so\nfor the most part it has looked the same.\n\n40\n00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.410\n&gt;&gt; They made it prettier.\n\n41\n00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.040\n&gt;&gt; They did, they have polished\nthe interface just a little bit.\n\n42\n00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.170\nAnd one of those things that has\nchanged through the years is that,\n\n43\n00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.950\nsome of these different\ncategories are called.\n\n44\n00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.410\nAnd what do I mean by categories?\n\n45\n00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.310\nWell, if we look in\nthe upper right hand corner,\n\n46\n00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.180\nyou're gonna notice that it\nsays category right here.\n\n47\n00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.890\nAnd going back to Windows XP,\n\n48\n00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.580\nand you don't have to worry about it for\nXP being on this MTA exam.\n\n49\n00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.110\nI just wanna kinda show\nyou where it's come from.\n\n50\n00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.030\nYou used to have two modes, you had modes\ngoing back to Windows 2000 that was\n\n51\n00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.300\ncalled the classic mode and\nyou could switch in and\n\n52\n00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.470\nout of what's known here as the Category\nmode and then Classic view.\n\n53\n00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.560\nWell, when Windows 7 came out,\nthey did away with that term classic.\n\n54\n00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.090\nI don't know if it's just because they\ndidn't want people looking to the past,\n\n55\n00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.620\nhey, live in the now,\nman, look to the future.\n\n56\n00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.335\n&gt;&gt; It worked for Coke.\n\n57\n00:02:42.335 --> 00:02:44.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So they,\nwhat they did was said okay,\n\n58\n00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.510\nwe're no longer gonna call\nit classic mode, all right?\n\n59\n00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.570\nWhat we're gonna do,\n\n60\n00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.280\nis we're gonna call this something known\nas just Large icons and Small icons.\n\n61\n00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.720\nNow, what do we mean by this?\n\n62\n00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.550\nBut, really speaking, Control panel\nhas two main different views,\n\n63\n00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.920\nthe category view that you see right here.\n\n64\n00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.670\nWhat it does is it groups everything\ntogether based on a type of category,\n\n65\n00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.760\nif you will, hence the name.\n\n66\n00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.850\nHowever, sometimes you're\ngoing to see that this view\n\n67\n00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.580\nleads you to a link that you click to\nthat leads you to another link and then\n\n68\n00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.270\nfinally another link before you get to\nthe utility that you might be looking for.\n\n69\n00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.850\nWell, for some that might be a little\nbit too clustered if you will, and some\n\n70\n00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.470\npeople just want to see every utility that\nyou can find here in the Control Panel.\n\n71\n00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.210\nAnd that's what the classic view used to\nbe called, today it's called Large icons.\n\n72\n00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.270\nAnd as you can see here Dan,\n\n73\n00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.840\nwe've got a whole bunch of\ndifferent icons that show up.\n\n74\n00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.270\nNow, some prefer this view, personally,\n\n75\n00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.960\nI like this view especially because with\na couple of things that I'm looking for,\n\n76\n00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.640\nI kind of have a hard time\nfinding it in the Category view.\n\n77\n00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.040\nBut there are times that the Category\nview for me is just as important and\n\n78\n00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.380\nlet me tell you why.\n\n79\n00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.440\nIf you are in a support role, right?\n\n80\n00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.588\nYou might be watching this MTA because\nmaybe you're starting to kinda,\n\n81\n00:03:54.588 --> 00:03:58.200\nthis is your stepping stone into\nthe IT field work at Help Desk.\n\n82\n00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.793\nAs you start to work with these Windows\noperating systems, like Dan's worked with\n\n83\n00:04:01.793 --> 00:04:04.790\nWindows for a very long time now and\nan enterprise operating system.\n\n84\n00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.336\nI'm gonna throw a question at you, Dan.\n\n85\n00:04:06.336 --> 00:04:09.075\nHow many times did you find that a user,\n\n86\n00:04:09.075 --> 00:04:13.190\nyour average user,\nwould modify default settings?\n\n87\n00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.560\n&gt;&gt; It's very very rare.\n\n88\n00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.420\nSome of them, they get a little strong,\nthey think man, I can do this.\n\n89\n00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.110\nAnd that's good, as you should\nplay around with your system.\n\n90\n00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.185\nBut then sometimes that would break,\n\n91\n00:04:21.185 --> 00:04:25.285\nbut normally, users leave it the way\nit is because that's the way it works.\n\n92\n00:04:25.285 --> 00:04:26.385\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it and\n\n93\n00:04:26.385 --> 00:04:29.805\nthat's why I wanna say that the Category\nview has its place in your training.\n\n94\n00:04:29.805 --> 00:04:30.825\nLet me show you why.\n\n95\n00:04:30.825 --> 00:04:34.965\nIf we look at my screen here, Category\nview is typically what the default or\n\n96\n00:04:34.965 --> 00:04:38.655\njust the average end user sees, all right?\n\n97\n00:04:38.655 --> 00:04:40.925\nAnd if I'm on a Help Desk support ticket,\nright?\n\n98\n00:04:40.925 --> 00:04:44.510\nAnd I'm trying to walk somebody\nthrough the configuration of a certain\n\n99\n00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:45.490\nutility, right?\n\n100\n00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.920\nAdjust your power options, right?\n\n101\n00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.650\nIf they're seeing something different\nthan what you're used to, or\n\n102\n00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.820\nif you're not used to using this\nCategory view, you're gonna be a little\n\n103\n00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.990\nless efficient at how you help\nsomebody in a Help Desk situation.\n\n104\n00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.990\nSo if I wanna get power options, right?\n\n105\n00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.820\nMy first thought is well, if I'm in\nthe large icon view, I mean, you can\n\n106\n00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.620\nlook right here and you can see that,\nthere's my power options right there.\n\n107\n00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.990\nI didn't have to click around and\nfind it, right?\n\n108\n00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.600\nSo that's very convenient for me.\n\n109\n00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.110\nProbably convenient for Dan too,\n\n110\n00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.620\nas many times as he's stared\nat this screen as well.\n\n111\n00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.060\nBut for the average end user that probably\ndoesn't even know what Control Panel is,\n\n112\n00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.270\nyou would have to support them by saying\nokay, I want you to go to System and\n\n113\n00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.770\nSecurity, open up Control Panel\nlike we just showed you.\n\n114\n00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.870\n&gt;&gt; Click view by, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Click view by and\n\n115\n00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.560\nchange to large icons.\n\n116\n00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.990\nThat would probably be the smart thing, or\nyou can just say System and Security and\n\n117\n00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.870\nthen right here you have Power Options.\n\n118\n00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.846\nSo there are a few different ways to\nunderstand how to work through this.\n\n119\n00:05:40.846 --> 00:05:44.784\nThe other thing that the Category view\ndoes that the other view doesn't do is\n\n120\n00:05:44.784 --> 00:05:48.475\nthat it gives you these task links,\nit gives you some common options for\n\n121\n00:05:48.475 --> 00:05:50.770\nthe different utilities that you will use.\n\n122\n00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:51.530\nSo again,\n\n123\n00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.200\nthere's no right way or wrong way, I'm\ngonna use it here in the Category view.\n\n124\n00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.370\nHowever, if you're studying out there,\nknow both ways, right?\n\n125\n00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:04.140\nAnd if it's something that fits and\nsuits you, like large icons, then use it.\n\n126\n00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.900\nBut however, just keep in mind\nthat both have their place.\n\n127\n00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.760\nNow that being said, what we gonna\nfocus in on what the MTA exam\n\n128\n00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.100\ntalks about really hearing control\npanel and a couple of things.\n\n129\n00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.250\nThe first thing is administrative tools,\nnow what are the administrative tools?\n\n130\n00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.990\nWhen you say tools administrators use but\nadministrators use Control Panel as well.\n\n131\n00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.090\nAdministrative tools under the System and\nSecurity if we scroll all the way down\n\n132\n00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.460\nhere you will see administrative\ntools right here.\n\n133\n00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.660\nIf I click on this,\nthese are tools that first of all, and\n\n134\n00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.080\nit's gonna sound like well,\ngeez Wes, thanks.\n\n135\n00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.310\nThat you most likely have\nto be an administrator,\n\n136\n00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.110\nyou need a higher level of\nprivileges than a standard user.\n\n137\n00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.190\nThat's why a lot a standard users\nwon't even be here because,\n\n138\n00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:49.350\ntypically they are not gonna be\nconfiguring any of these options in here.\n\n139\n00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:50.660\nAnd you can see that there's a bunch.\n\n140\n00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.590\nNow we're gonna talk about a few of these\nand I will say it that we do have some\n\n141\n00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.880\nepisodes that are coming up that\nmight go in more depth to these.\n\n142\n00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.000\nHowever, we are gonna talk about\nsome of the major one's here and\n\n143\n00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.570\nthen in later episodes where we\nneed to call on these utilities,\n\n144\n00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:09.090\nyou can always come back to this episode\nif you need a more in depth explanation.\n\n145\n00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.450\nLike for instance, Computer Management.\n\n146\n00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.350\nComputer Management, we've got\nsomething coming up that's gonna talk\n\n147\n00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.890\na lot about Computer Management,\nall right?\n\n148\n00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.110\nBut when we talk about\nComputer Management briefly here,\n\n149\n00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:23.490\nthis is actually a collection,\na suite of utilities that we can use.\n\n150\n00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.512\nAnd it really is one of those hidden gems\ninside of Windows and if you haven't used\n\n151\n00:07:27.512 --> 00:07:31.062\nit, I will tell you and almost\nrecommend that if you're going into IT,\n\n152\n00:07:31.062 --> 00:07:34.852\nyou should know all about computer\nmanagement whether you're studying for\n\n153\n00:07:34.852 --> 00:07:36.360\na certification exam or not.\n\n154\n00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.730\nLet's go ahead and launch it up here and\n\n155\n00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:44.440\njust kinda take a look at\nwhat it offers us, all right?\n\n156\n00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.450\nSo, Computer Management you can see,\nwe have bundled in here,\n\n157\n00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.110\nwe have different system tools, right?\n\n158\n00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:52.716\nWe have things for automation,\nwe're going to come back to Event Viewer\n\n159\n00:07:52.716 --> 00:07:55.386\ncuz it has its own spot here\nin administrative tools.\n\n160\n00:07:55.386 --> 00:07:59.439\nWe've got the Event Viewer looking up\nthings like system events that happen\n\n161\n00:07:59.439 --> 00:08:00.579\nacross the machine,\n\n162\n00:08:00.579 --> 00:08:04.837\nsecurity events that happen on the machine\nWe have shared folders, all right.\n\n163\n00:08:04.837 --> 00:08:08.421\nIf you're gonna set up a shared resource\nso that you can connect to it and\n\n164\n00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:10.471\nuse it over the network, or vice versa.\n\n165\n00:08:10.471 --> 00:08:13.424\nSo that somebody else can connect\nto it over the network and\n\n166\n00:08:13.424 --> 00:08:15.546\nuse it, you have that right here as well.\n\n167\n00:08:15.546 --> 00:08:17.653\nWe also have local users and groups.\n\n168\n00:08:17.653 --> 00:08:21.916\nAnd local users and groups is a way that\nyou can not only look at the current users\n\n169\n00:08:21.916 --> 00:08:24.963\non this machine, but\nalso the groups that are built in.\n\n170\n00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:28.262\nIn fact, this is kind of a handy utility,\nbecause if you were,\n\n171\n00:08:28.262 --> 00:08:30.022\nlet me take you another way here.\n\n172\n00:08:30.022 --> 00:08:34.645\nIf we're gonna get back into control panel\nand I decide we're gonna go ahead and\n\n173\n00:08:34.645 --> 00:08:39.073\nwe're gonna use, in fact, let me get\nback to the control panel like I said.\n\n174\n00:08:39.073 --> 00:08:42.830\nWe're gonna use the user\naccounts over here, right?\n\n175\n00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:44.482\nWe're gonna create user accounts.\n\n176\n00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:46.675\nAnother place should you can create them,\nright?\n\n177\n00:08:46.675 --> 00:08:49.562\nThe one thing that I can't do here,\nis if I go in user accounts,\n\n178\n00:08:49.562 --> 00:08:52.410\nI don't really have a place that\nI can manage groups, right?\n\n179\n00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:55.392\nI can manage just the user accounts.\n\n180\n00:08:55.392 --> 00:08:58.569\nSo, that's one of the things\nthat the local users and\n\n181\n00:08:58.569 --> 00:09:03.520\ngroups node, or console if you will in, on\nthe left hand side here, helps us to do.\n\n182\n00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:08.177\nI can see and view the current default\ngroups that are on this machine.\n\n183\n00:09:08.177 --> 00:09:11.500\nIf I wanted to I could always right click,\nand I could create a group, right Dan?\n\n184\n00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.544\nSo maybe we're gonna help\ncreate a help desk group.\n\n185\n00:09:14.544 --> 00:09:18.740\nAnd if I wanted to, I could turn\naround and I could add a user to that.\n\n186\n00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:19.498\nLet's see, Admin.\n\n187\n00:09:19.498 --> 00:09:21.380\nLet's see if that name's in there.\n\n188\n00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.649\nThere it is.\n\n189\n00:09:22.649 --> 00:09:26.789\nI could add somebody to the group and\nI could create this.\n\n190\n00:09:26.789 --> 00:09:29.042\nAnd then sure enough\nthere in the background,\n\n191\n00:09:29.042 --> 00:09:30.845\nyou can see that that group comes up.\n\n192\n00:09:30.845 --> 00:09:34.165\nSo not only managing and maintaining,\nor monitoring if you want,\n\n193\n00:09:34.165 --> 00:09:37.795\nthe groups that are local to the machine,\nyou can also add groups later.\n\n194\n00:09:37.795 --> 00:09:40.549\nAnd then you can add your\npeople to those groups as well,\n\n195\n00:09:40.549 --> 00:09:42.430\nthe users that are on in this machine.\n\n196\n00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:45.663\nKeep in mind though,\nthis isn't an Active Directory domain,\n\n197\n00:09:45.663 --> 00:09:48.963\nwhat we're talking about\nspecifically here is, local users.\n\n198\n00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:50.320\nNow there's some other ones in here too.\n\n199\n00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.848\nWe've got performance monitors, so\n\n200\n00:09:51.848 --> 00:09:54.530\nif you want to look at performance\nrelated information, you can.\n\n201\n00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:57.583\nWe got an episode coming up where\nwe're gonna actually show you and\n\n202\n00:09:57.583 --> 00:09:59.010\nwe're gonna dive in to these.\n\n203\n00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:02.956\nKeep in mind, just more a high level\noverview of computer management.\n\n204\n00:10:02.956 --> 00:10:04.615\nWe also have disk management here, right?\n\n205\n00:10:04.615 --> 00:10:08.544\nDrive utilities, we gotta maintain\nthe hard drives that are in the machines,\n\n206\n00:10:08.544 --> 00:10:10.462\nmanage and maintain the partitions.\n\n207\n00:10:10.462 --> 00:10:14.817\nCreating things like virtual hard disks\nif we wanna use virtual hard disks inside\n\n208\n00:10:14.817 --> 00:10:16.620\nof this operating system, too.\n\n209\n00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.704\nAgain keep in mind,\ncoming up in the future.\n\n210\n00:10:19.704 --> 00:10:22.100\nNow, we also have service and\napplications.\n\n211\n00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.181\nThe applications I will say services,\n\n212\n00:10:24.181 --> 00:10:27.719\nbackground processes that\nare commonly running on this machine.\n\n213\n00:10:27.719 --> 00:10:30.394\nSometimes they're not\nrunning on the machine, but\n\n214\n00:10:30.394 --> 00:10:33.202\nI can see what the current\nstate of these services are.\n\n215\n00:10:33.202 --> 00:10:36.499\nAlright, last one here,\nI'll just kinda mention here, WMI control.\n\n216\n00:10:36.499 --> 00:10:39.014\nThis is\nWindows Management Instrumentation and\n\n217\n00:10:39.014 --> 00:10:42.875\nif any of you guys maybe are familiar\nwith other open standards if you will,\n\n218\n00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:46.570\nlike SNMP, that's the simple\nnetwork management protocol, right?\n\n219\n00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:48.788\nWe use these on things like\nCisco switches and servers.\n\n220\n00:10:48.788 --> 00:10:51.943\nAnd then what they do is they kinda tell\nyou what their health is and the state.\n\n221\n00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:53.058\nAnd you can query them for\n\n222\n00:10:53.058 --> 00:10:56.156\na whole bunch of different kind\nof diagnostic information, right?\n\n223\n00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:57.189\nManagement information.\n\n224\n00:10:57.189 --> 00:11:00.634\nWell, Windows has their own\nset of characteristics, and\n\n225\n00:11:00.634 --> 00:11:04.865\nthat's what the WMI is,\nit's Windows Management Instrumentation.\n\n226\n00:11:04.865 --> 00:11:09.912\nIt's where if I know the syntax, and I\nknow how to set it up, I can actually ask\n\n227\n00:11:09.912 --> 00:11:15.605\nthe operating system for information from\nbasically just about any characteristic.\n\n228\n00:11:15.605 --> 00:11:20.020\nHowever, it is very complex, so\nI believe it's way beyond the MTA exam.\n\n229\n00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:21.729\nSo I just do mention that there.\n\n230\n00:11:21.729 --> 00:11:25.921\n&gt;&gt; Well Wes, it really seems like the\ncomputer management console here has taken\n\n231\n00:11:25.921 --> 00:11:29.668\na bunch of the most commonly used\ncomputer management type software,\n\n232\n00:11:29.668 --> 00:11:32.544\nslapped all into one easy to find,\neasy to use place.\n\n233\n00:11:32.544 --> 00:11:35.933\nYou don't have to search around\ntrying to where was that tool at?\n\n234\n00:11:35.933 --> 00:11:37.523\nIt's right there in\nthe community management.\n\n235\n00:11:37.523 --> 00:11:38.220\n&gt;&gt; You're exactly right Dan.\n\n236\n00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:42.146\nI can basically call it the convenience\nstore for Windows utilities, right?\n\n237\n00:11:42.146 --> 00:11:42.902\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n238\n00:11:42.902 --> 00:11:44.226\n&gt;&gt; Everything that you got\nunder one store, that's right.\n\n239\n00:11:44.226 --> 00:11:48.028\nThe 7/11 of Windows management for sure.\n\n240\n00:11:48.028 --> 00:11:49.044\n&gt;&gt; Or Wawa, wherever you're from.\n\n241\n00:11:49.044 --> 00:11:49.594\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n242\n00:11:49.594 --> 00:11:50.421\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n243\n00:11:50.421 --> 00:11:51.033\n&gt;&gt; Circle K.\n\n244\n00:11:51.033 --> 00:11:51.801\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n245\n00:11:51.801 --> 00:11:53.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n246\n00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:54.945\n&gt;&gt; So, that's a little bit\nabout computer management.\n\n247\n00:11:54.945 --> 00:11:59.021\nLike I said guys, we're gonna have an\nepisode coming up where we actually dive\n\n248\n00:11:59.021 --> 00:12:01.943\ninto each one of these utilities and\ntalk more about it.\n\n249\n00:12:01.943 --> 00:12:04.517\nBut they're in the administrative tools,\nand\n\n250\n00:12:04.517 --> 00:12:07.420\nI want you to know how to\nget to administrative tools.\n\n251\n00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.180\nNow, the next one that we have.\n\n252\n00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.444\nThis one goes back a while and like I\nsaid, we're gonna talk about them, and\n\n253\n00:12:12.444 --> 00:12:14.136\nI've kinda of grouped them together.\n\n254\n00:12:14.136 --> 00:12:16.608\nWhat we're talking about right\nnow is more system utilities.\n\n255\n00:12:16.608 --> 00:12:19.520\nKeep in mind, all of them\nreally can be a system utility.\n\n256\n00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:23.097\nBut we'll talk about things\nlike security as well and\n\n257\n00:12:23.097 --> 00:12:26.686\ndisk utilities that are all\nunder this one location.\n\n258\n00:12:26.686 --> 00:12:30.966\nThe next one that we're gonna look at is\nsomething known as system configuration.\n\n259\n00:12:30.966 --> 00:12:33.979\nAnd when we look at system configuration,\nthis is a really cool utility.\n\n260\n00:12:33.979 --> 00:12:37.040\nThere's a couple of different\nways that you can launch it.\n\n261\n00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:41.119\nIf I go ahead and I just launch up system\nconfiguration here in administrative\n\n262\n00:12:41.119 --> 00:12:44.711\ntools, and we just go ahead and\ndo our old double click, all right?\n\n263\n00:12:44.711 --> 00:12:49.858\nNow, system configuration,\nit's a utility that you can use in\n\n264\n00:12:49.858 --> 00:12:55.018\norder to control and maintain and\nmanage your start up process.\n\n265\n00:12:55.018 --> 00:12:59.211\nFor instance, if you need to troubleshoot\na driver installation that causes\n\n266\n00:12:59.211 --> 00:13:03.663\na problem, causes your machine to start\nacting haywire on the boot process code,\n\n267\n00:13:03.663 --> 00:13:05.484\nI've done it many times before.\n\n268\n00:13:05.484 --> 00:13:06.672\nAnd you can do that, right?\n\n269\n00:13:06.672 --> 00:13:10.718\nWe can go into things like for\ninstance, a diagnostics startup.\n\n270\n00:13:10.718 --> 00:13:14.048\nI install a driver, the driver causes\na problem, I have to reboot the computer.\n\n271\n00:13:14.048 --> 00:13:16.824\nFor some reason,\nthe computer doesn't boot right,\n\n272\n00:13:16.824 --> 00:13:18.806\nstarts giving me all kinds of errors.\n\n273\n00:13:18.806 --> 00:13:23.403\nI can come back in here, and I can enter a\ndiagnostics boot, if you will, and what it\n\n274\n00:13:23.403 --> 00:13:27.960\ndoes is it eliminates that driver from\nactually loading during the boot process.\n\n275\n00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.815\nIf all of those problems seem to disappear\nthen I can pretty much deduce that there's\n\n276\n00:13:31.815 --> 00:13:34.165\nsomething wrong with\nthe driver that I installed.\n\n277\n00:13:34.165 --> 00:13:38.164\nSo, it's a really good way that you\ncan control different aspects of your\n\n278\n00:13:38.164 --> 00:13:39.010\nboot process.\n\n279\n00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:44.656\nFor instance, here in the Boot tab, if\nyou zoom in here, you can see Safe Boot.\n\n280\n00:13:44.656 --> 00:13:49.403\nIf you're not aware out there, you can\nboot into what's known as Safe Mode.\n\n281\n00:13:49.403 --> 00:13:53.624\nAnd if you boot into safe mode, in fact,\nI'll go ahead and show you here.\n\n282\n00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:57.016\nWe'll go ahead and restart this machine\nand show you what it looks like to boot\n\n283\n00:13:57.016 --> 00:13:59.956\ninto Safe Mode, so you can see that\nyou can use it for diagnostics.\n\n284\n00:13:59.956 --> 00:14:02.490\nNow, when you boot into minimal, right?\n\n285\n00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:07.183\nWhat that does is that says, take all of\nthe basic services and all the boot start\n\n286\n00:14:07.183 --> 00:14:12.178\ndrivers, not these third-party drivers,\nand just start the machine up that way.\n\n287\n00:14:12.178 --> 00:14:15.035\nAnd then what we can do,\nif that starts your machine, then again,\n\n288\n00:14:15.035 --> 00:14:18.162\nwhat we can tell is that some\nthird-party driver's causing a problem.\n\n289\n00:14:18.162 --> 00:14:22.865\nNow, you're gonna notice something, that\nwhen we boot into this minimalistic safe\n\n290\n00:14:22.865 --> 00:14:26.935\nboot, again, also known as Safe Mode,\nit is gonna look a lot different.\n\n291\n00:14:26.935 --> 00:14:31.375\nAnd one of the reasons you'll notice that\nthe display looks different is the fact\n\n292\n00:14:31.375 --> 00:14:34.196\nthat it's loading a very,\nvery basic VGA driver.\n\n293\n00:14:34.196 --> 00:14:37.362\nIn fact, I do apologize for\nthe little black mat around there, Dan.\n\n294\n00:14:37.362 --> 00:14:40.964\nBecause we're using a basic VGA driver,\nit's not scaling right.\n\n295\n00:14:40.964 --> 00:14:46.312\nSo you can see that something going\nout the gate is a little different.\n\n296\n00:14:46.312 --> 00:14:48.027\nAll right, we'll go ahead and\nget logged in.\n\n297\n00:14:48.027 --> 00:14:52.017\nNow, you might notice that it's telling\nme that there's a certain app that's not\n\n298\n00:14:52.017 --> 00:14:54.639\nallowed to run because I gotta\nbe in the the Build IT, or\n\n299\n00:14:54.639 --> 00:14:57.493\nI can't launch it with a built\nin administrative account.\n\n300\n00:14:57.493 --> 00:14:58.517\nLet me get that out of there.\n\n301\n00:14:58.517 --> 00:15:03.040\nNow, notice it tells me what the build is,\nand there we go.\n\n302\n00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.880\nI was looking for the Safe Mode,\nlittle tag there.\n\n303\n00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.124\nYou can see right there it says Safe Mode.\n\n304\n00:15:08.124 --> 00:15:10.651\nAgain, notice that it's\na minimalistic boot.\n\n305\n00:15:10.651 --> 00:15:14.347\nNow, if any of you guys that are watching\nthis have ever been in a situation where\n\n306\n00:15:14.347 --> 00:15:17.880\nyou've actually launched into Safe Mode,\nthen you reboot the computer and\n\n307\n00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.000\nit launches normally.\n\n308\n00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.125\nIt's a little different here from\nyour system configuration utility,\n\n309\n00:15:22.125 --> 00:15:23.670\nit's persistent across reboots.\n\n310\n00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:28.670\nSo if I want this to stop, well I have\nto launch up system configuration and\n\n311\n00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:30.211\nI have to change this.\n\n312\n00:15:30.211 --> 00:15:33.280\nSo that leads me to my next point, and\nhow you can launch this another way.\n\n313\n00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:38.368\nThis is also called ms_config, and\nI can launch it from the run line here.\n\n314\n00:15:38.368 --> 00:15:41.376\nNow I don't believe, I'm not sure if\nCortana's gonna be working right now.\n\n315\n00:15:41.376 --> 00:15:45.122\nBecause again, Safe Mode,\nit does turn off a lot of those services.\n\n316\n00:15:45.122 --> 00:15:46.310\nBut there's other ways we can do this.\n\n317\n00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:50.366\nWe can do ms_config.exe from here.\n\n318\n00:15:50.366 --> 00:15:52.443\nAnd you'll see that it launches\nup system configuration.\n\n319\n00:15:52.443 --> 00:15:55.107\nThere was a reason I did that, right?\n\n320\n00:15:55.107 --> 00:15:56.653\nIf you're on a certification exam, and\n\n321\n00:15:56.653 --> 00:15:58.381\nthey ask you to get to\nsystem configuration,\n\n322\n00:15:58.381 --> 00:16:01.122\nnotice that there's a couple different\nways that you can launch this.\n\n323\n00:16:01.122 --> 00:16:03.321\nSo please remember.\n\n324\n00:16:03.321 --> 00:16:07.474\nThe system configuration utility\nis also called MS config.\n\n325\n00:16:07.474 --> 00:16:10.390\nAlright, and\nthen again you can see those services.\n\n326\n00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:12.200\nRemember we've seen those\nin computer management.\n\n327\n00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.560\nWell I can also see them here too.\n\n328\n00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:17.440\nSo a really quick way to do\nsome of the configurations that\n\n329\n00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.400\nmight happen at boot time.\n\n330\n00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.660\nWell you say well wait a second Wes,\nhow does this service.\n\n331\n00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:23.300\nHow's this affect my boot time?\n\n332\n00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.550\nWell, these services.\n\n333\n00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:27.200\nI can actually look at\nthe properties if I want.\n\n334\n00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.170\nAnd I can change their startup types,\nright?\n\n335\n00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:32.890\nI can tell them,\ndo an automatic delayed startup.\n\n336\n00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:36.110\nWhich means change it from\nstarting automatically and\n\n337\n00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:38.110\nkeep it out of my boot process.\n\n338\n00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:41.100\nAfter the boot process is finished,\nthen start the service.\n\n339\n00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:46.230\nAnd again, like I said, you're managing\nand configuring different aspects of boot.\n\n340\n00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:48.810\nAll right, and, well,\nthat's pretty much it.\n\n341\n00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:51.980\nStart up, we'll talk about a little\nbit later that goes on task manager,\n\n342\n00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:55.100\nit was here for years, it's not anymore,\nit's now on task manager but\n\n343\n00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.940\nwe're not gonna deal with that right now.\n\n344\n00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:00.280\nAnd then a couple of the utilities\nthat you can get to.\n\n345\n00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:05.440\nNow I was gonna say, there's some of these\nutilities that we haven't shown yet.\n\n346\n00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.210\nThey also have the ability to\nconnect to other computers.\n\n347\n00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:13.180\nAnd I might double back,\nkind of sand against the grain here Dan,\n\n348\n00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:15.470\nI might double back on computer\nmanagement and show them here.\n\n349\n00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:19.680\nBut some of these utilities not only allow\nyou to connect to the local machine but\n\n350\n00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.270\nthey allow you to connect to another\nmachine and manage it as well.\n\n351\n00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:26.790\nLet me go ahead and I'll bring up\nthe local system information and\n\n352\n00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:28.432\nwe'll see what it looks like locally and\n\n353\n00:17:28.432 --> 00:17:30.900\nthen we'll show you what you can\ndo to it which is really cool.\n\n354\n00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:36.850\nNow this is another one that's also inside\nof, and you know what let me go ahead and\n\n355\n00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:42.930\nchange my boot process and\nwe will get that computer restarted.\n\n356\n00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:47.860\nNow if you've ever had a scenario,\nmaybe you haven't, but again they\n\n357\n00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:52.640\nmight put you in a scenario on the exam\nwhere, you need to gain the information.\n\n358\n00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:58.110\nYou need a really comprehensive\nview of all of the hardware and\n\n359\n00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:02.000\nall of the software in a current machine.\n\n360\n00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.910\nWould you have the ability to tell\nwhat that hardware and software is?\n\n361\n00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:09.800\nWell, see that's the purpose of\nthe system information, all right?\n\n362\n00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:14.660\nSystem information gives you that\nfull comprehensive overview.\n\n363\n00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.650\nOf all the hardware in your machine and\nall the software.\n\n364\n00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:19.280\nLet's go ahead and\nget logged back in here and\n\n365\n00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.500\nwe'll show you what we're talking about.\n\n366\n00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:24.470\nEnter our super secret\nMicrosoft password there.\n\n367\n00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:27.680\nAnd we will get logged in.\n\n368\n00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.199\nAll right-\n&gt;&gt; The Windows password is Linux.\n\n369\n00:18:31.199 --> 00:18:33.558\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right, one, two,\n\n370\n00:18:33.558 --> 00:18:34.584\nthree, four, five, six.\n\n371\n00:18:34.584 --> 00:18:37.035\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] They're like you.\n\n372\n00:18:37.035 --> 00:18:39.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So here we go.\n\n373\n00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:43.030\nBack to the desktop, let's go ahead and\nwe're gonna go back to our control panel.\n\n374\n00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:47.632\nWe're right clicking on our Windows charm,\nor icon if you will.\n\n375\n00:18:47.632 --> 00:18:49.642\nWe're gonna change it\nup a little bit here.\n\n376\n00:18:49.642 --> 00:18:53.530\nI'm gonna go to large icons so you can\nsee that hey it's even easier to get\n\n377\n00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:57.650\nto administrative tools and that's again\nwhy some people do like this view.\n\n378\n00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:00.120\nAdministrative tools it's alphabetic\nit's right there at the top.\n\n379\n00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.770\nIt does make it easy.\n\n380\n00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:05.160\nAnd if we scroll down you'll see\nSystem Information right there.\n\n381\n00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.140\nAll right.\n\n382\n00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:09.140\nNow if we go ahead and\nlaunch System Information.\n\n383\n00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.510\nYou will see.\n\n384\n00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:12.260\nWell, this is it.\n\n385\n00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:17.740\nNotice that I get detailed information\non the hardware components\n\n386\n00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:22.110\nas well as the software environment\ninside of this operating system.\n\n387\n00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:26.750\nAnd if expand out hardware resources and\nI select, let's see one of these.\n\n388\n00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.416\nI can see the different, for instance,\n\n389\n00:19:28.416 --> 00:19:30.772\nthings that we usually don't\nhave to work with anymore.\n\n390\n00:19:30.772 --> 00:19:33.605\nBut I can see things like your DMA,\n\n391\n00:19:33.605 --> 00:19:38.213\ndirect memory access, your IOs,\nif you will the IRQs.\n\n392\n00:19:38.213 --> 00:19:41.790\nDan's over here getting shivers\nabout the interrupt request lines.\n\n393\n00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:43.930\nThank goodness we don't have\nto configure those today.\n\n394\n00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:45.095\n&gt;&gt; They will not be named again.\n\n395\n00:19:45.095 --> 00:19:46.435\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n396\n00:19:46.435 --> 00:19:49.751\nDan, I might not survive\nthis episode if I do.\n\n397\n00:19:49.751 --> 00:19:50.831\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n398\n00:19:50.831 --> 00:19:54.875\nthe other thing that you can see is things\nlike memory addresses as well here and\n\n399\n00:19:54.875 --> 00:19:58.260\na lot of this information Windows\nis handling in the background.\n\n400\n00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:01.170\nBut if you did need to see\nthat information, you could.\n\n401\n00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:04.880\nI could see other things like the hardware\ncomponents that we were talking about.\n\n402\n00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:05.920\nAnd I can select one.\n\n403\n00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:09.540\nAnd I can kinda see the information\naround that device.\n\n404\n00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:11.210\nThings about the driver.\n\n405\n00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:12.710\nNow that's really nice.\n\n406\n00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:16.540\nI told you that this can also\nconnect to other machines, right?\n\n407\n00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:20.230\nTo give me the resource information,\nall this resource information for\n\n408\n00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.900\nanother machine.\n\n409\n00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:22.530\nLet's go ahead and do that.\n\n410\n00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:27.120\nIf I choose the view option, up here\nat the top you'll see remote computer.\n\n411\n00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.410\nAll right.\nLet me go ahead and select that.\n\n412\n00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:32.220\nAnd here's where it by default it\nstarts with the local computer.\n\n413\n00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.370\nBut I can change this\nto remote computer and\n\n414\n00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:37.270\nprovided that the remote\ncomputer is set up right,\n\n415\n00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:40.330\nwhich we're gonna keep our fingers crossed\nand hopefully I got that setup right.\n\n416\n00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:42.650\nI should be able to connect\nto another machine.\n\n417\n00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:44.330\nNow notice that it did\nit right that quick.\n\n418\n00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:46.180\nIt doesn't really look\nlike much different, but\n\n419\n00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:50.030\nif you'll notice that we can\nsee a shared location here.\n\n420\n00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:51.060\nNotice this is client01.\n\n421\n00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:55.440\nAll right, I'm not on client01,\nI'm actually on client02.\n\n422\n00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.628\nAnd let's just verify that by\ngoing to our system control panel.\n\n423\n00:20:58.628 --> 00:21:01.857\nAll right if you'll notice,\nthis is my local computer's name.\n\n424\n00:21:01.857 --> 00:21:03.156\nIt's client 02.\n\n425\n00:21:03.156 --> 00:21:06.702\nSo that's how I can tell I'm connected\nremotely to another machine.\n\n426\n00:21:06.702 --> 00:21:09.386\nI could see what operating\nsystem it's running.\n\n427\n00:21:09.386 --> 00:21:13.025\nI could see for instance the version,\nI could see the system model and\n\n428\n00:21:13.025 --> 00:21:14.739\nthis might be important right?\n\n429\n00:21:14.739 --> 00:21:18.475\nIf Dan's the senior administrator and\nhe says hey Wes, I'm at help desk.\n\n430\n00:21:18.475 --> 00:21:21.199\nHe says Wes,\nI need you to connect to another machine,\n\n431\n00:21:21.199 --> 00:21:25.120\nI need to find information about\na certain hardware device is there.\n\n432\n00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:27.130\nWell I can use system information, right?\n\n433\n00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:29.010\nAnd I could connect to that machine.\n\n434\n00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:30.600\nWell what does that do for ya?\n\n435\n00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.980\nYou can connect to the machine,\nhow does that help Dan?\n\n436\n00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.070\nWell I want you to notice something\nelse that you can do here.\n\n437\n00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:38.230\nIf you look at the top under File.\n\n438\n00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:40.120\nNotice I can export.\n\n439\n00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:45.390\nLet me choose export and we're gonna go it\nahead and I'll save this to the desktop,\n\n440\n00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:48.570\nand you'll see in the background I've\nalready got one created cuz it does\n\n441\n00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:53.130\ntake a little bit on this one Dan, and\nI don't wanna waste everybody's time, but\n\n442\n00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:55.690\nyou can see that it's starting to\ngenerate its information, right?\n\n443\n00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:56.330\nSee that right there?\n\n444\n00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:58.980\nAnd it's saying Refreshing System\nInformation, so it's collecting and\n\n445\n00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.010\ngathering the information.\n\n446\n00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:05.270\nNow this is about client 01,\nanother machine on the network.\n\n447\n00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:07.100\nLet's see what that\ninformation looks like.\n\n448\n00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:11.910\nIf we pull it up here,\nit spits out your little text document.\n\n449\n00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:12.710\nAll right.\n\n450\n00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:15.720\nNotice that I can see\nall this information and\n\n451\n00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:19.920\nin a scenario where like I told you Dan\nmight be the senior administrator says,\n\n452\n00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.770\nhey I need you to tell me\nwhat information is here?\n\n453\n00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:24.290\nWhat information is there?\n\n454\n00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:26.490\nThe driver configuration,\n\n455\n00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:30.180\nthe hardware configuration,\nwhat current drivers are loaded up.\n\n456\n00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:35.240\nI can just output this information, just\nlike we're doing in the background here.\n\n457\n00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:38.090\nThis is what the file looks like, and\nI can email that file over to Dan,\n\n458\n00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:38.810\nand guess what?\n\n459\n00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:41.020\nNow he's got all the information he needs.\n\n460\n00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:44.660\nAnd he can add that with a control f\nif he's looking for something specific.\n\n461\n00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:50.670\nAll right, and there we go, so\nthis is also Client 01's, right?\n\n462\n00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:52.130\nSo this is a completely different machine.\n\n463\n00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:57.200\nSo you can see how you can utilize this\nin order to, not only get that overview\n\n464\n00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:01.580\nof your local machine but pretty much any\nother machine as long as it's setup right,\n\n465\n00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:03.625\nyou can do what's known\nas remote management.\n\n466\n00:23:03.625 --> 00:23:08.790\nAll right, now Dan I did say I kinda\ncheated you guys out there about computer\n\n467\n00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:12.150\nmanagement also I wanted to take a second\nand show you guys that real quick.\n\n468\n00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:16.777\nAnother quick way that I can get to\ncomputer management is just right clicking\n\n469\n00:23:16.777 --> 00:23:18.129\non the Windows icon and\n\n470\n00:23:18.129 --> 00:23:22.990\nchoosing computer management out\nof the administrative links.\n\n471\n00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:24.930\nAnd if you all notice here at the top.\n\n472\n00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:31.060\nNext to computer management,\nyou'll notice that it says Local, right?\n\n473\n00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.391\nThere's Local.\nWell that let's me know,\n\n474\n00:23:33.391 --> 00:23:37.924\njust like we've seen with MS Info 32,\nsystem information,\n\n475\n00:23:37.924 --> 00:23:42.216\nthat it's the local machine\nthat I'm currently viewing.\n\n476\n00:23:42.216 --> 00:23:47.289\nHowever, if I do have the remote\nmachine set up correctly I can right\n\n477\n00:23:47.289 --> 00:23:52.006\nclick on this and I could choose\nconnect to another computer and\n\n478\n00:23:52.006 --> 00:23:57.346\nwhen I do that again provided that\nthe other computer is set up correctly\n\n479\n00:23:57.346 --> 00:24:01.974\nI can choose okay by putting that\ncomputer's name in there and\n\n480\n00:24:01.974 --> 00:24:05.997\nwe can go ahead and\nExpand these out, and there we go.\n\n481\n00:24:05.997 --> 00:24:07.425\nI, have the ability to do.\n\n482\n00:24:07.425 --> 00:24:10.684\nWell, everything we can do computer\nmanagement to the local machine,\n\n483\n00:24:10.684 --> 00:24:13.889\nprovided I have the privileges on\nthe remote machine and it's set up,\n\n484\n00:24:13.889 --> 00:24:16.085\nI can also look at\ninformation of that machine.\n\n485\n00:24:16.085 --> 00:24:18.620\nSo, very, very good handy thing to have.\n\n486\n00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:20.397\n&gt;&gt; So,\nwhen you say privileges you just mean.\n\n487\n00:24:20.397 --> 00:24:22.484\nYou have a username and\npassword that works on that computer.\n\n488\n00:24:22.484 --> 00:24:24.194\n&gt;&gt; With administrative privileges.\n\n489\n00:24:24.194 --> 00:24:26.270\nYeah, that is right.\n\n490\n00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:31.313\nSo, if you're doing this inside of an\nActive Directory Domain, typically you're\n\n491\n00:24:31.313 --> 00:24:35.870\ngonna have other privileges set up by\nwhat's known as a domain controller.\n\n492\n00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:39.838\nBut, if you're doing this in a work\ngroup environment, Dan's exactly right.\n\n493\n00:24:39.838 --> 00:24:44.048\nYou have to have an account on that\nremote computer and that remote computer,\n\n494\n00:24:44.048 --> 00:24:46.400\nyou'll also have to be an administrator.\n\n495\n00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.270\nYou don't have to worry about\nthe security vulnerability.\n\n496\n00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:51.852\nNot anybody can just connect on this.\n\n497\n00:24:51.852 --> 00:24:55.316\nAll right, so Dan that takes\nus down to a couple more that,\n\n498\n00:24:55.316 --> 00:24:57.870\nI really think people need to be aware of.\n\n499\n00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:01.420\nOne of them is going to be\nwhat's known as event viewer.\n\n500\n00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:04.800\nNow we kind of looked at it just\nbriefly in computer management.\n\n501\n00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:11.240\nOops, however, let's go ahead and\nlet's go back to our control panel.\n\n502\n00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:17.254\nAnd I'll go back to the category view and\ndown to System and\n\n503\n00:25:17.254 --> 00:25:21.440\nSecurity, and Administrative Tools.\n\n504\n00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.530\nAll right, and here's Event Viewer.\n\n505\n00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:25.950\nNow, Event Viewer is\na really good utility.\n\n506\n00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:28.610\nIf you haven't used it,\nI would suggest using it.\n\n507\n00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:32.070\nAnd again,\nnot just from a certification endeavor.\n\n508\n00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:34.810\nBecause of the fact that,\nthis is a way to keep track of\n\n509\n00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:37.890\neverything that happens on your\nmachine whether it's good or bad.\n\n510\n00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:40.230\nWhether it's just basic information.\n\n511\n00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:42.950\nWhether it's services that cause problems,\nor\n\n512\n00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:47.524\nwhether it's things that lead up to even\ncritical events as they might be called,\n\n513\n00:25:47.524 --> 00:25:49.930\nlike for instance a kernel power failure.\n\n514\n00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:53.690\nAnd, you can see over here,\nthat there again,\n\n515\n00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:58.214\nwe have the local,\nthat means that it is a local machine.\n\n516\n00:25:58.214 --> 00:26:00.640\nI can expand out Custom Views.\n\n517\n00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.610\nI haven't really done anything\nwith Administrative Events.\n\n518\n00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:06.190\nThe ones that I definitely spend\nthe time with, are the Windows Logs.\n\n519\n00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:09.120\nThese are the ones that are really,\nreally common that we come in here and\n\n520\n00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.130\nwe definitely have to look\nat from time to time.\n\n521\n00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:17.080\nFor instance, you think you might be\nhaving problems with your system.\n\n522\n00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:20.256\nI, just click the System Logs and\nif you look to the right of System Logs,\n\n523\n00:26:20.256 --> 00:26:23.449\nyou can see that there's already\nsomething going on with this machine.\n\n524\n00:26:23.449 --> 00:26:24.545\n&gt;&gt; It's working perfectly.\n\n525\n00:26:24.545 --> 00:26:25.578\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n526\n00:26:25.578 --> 00:26:26.649\n&gt;&gt; No problems here.\n\n527\n00:26:26.649 --> 00:26:28.598\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n528\n00:26:28.598 --> 00:26:32.250\nwhat is it that Dan's joking around about?\n\n529\n00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:35.410\nWell, he can see right away,\nthat we have some errors happening.\n\n530\n00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:38.930\nWe have some information events and\nwe have some warnings, right?\n\n531\n00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:42.470\nAnd I don't know exactly what this means,\nI really have no clue.\n\n532\n00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:45.340\nIn fact, I wasn't even expecting\nit on the show, so this is kind of\n\n533\n00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:49.980\na good thing to see what's going on here,\nand really it wasn't scripted on this one.\n\n534\n00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:53.870\nLet's go ahead and we're gonna double\nclick one of these events that have come\n\n535\n00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:56.110\nup, and see if we can get a little\nmore information about them.\n\n536\n00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:58.720\nAll right, notice it says,\n\n537\n00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:04.550\ngot some kinda error from computer 01\nwhen attempting to activate the server.\n\n538\n00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:07.631\nSo, apparently this was a DCOM event when,\nwe turned around and\n\n539\n00:27:07.631 --> 00:27:11.526\nwe tried to connect to that machine that\nI was telling you for remote management.\n\n540\n00:27:11.526 --> 00:27:13.940\nIt's telling me there's some\nkind of distributing com error.\n\n541\n00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:18.610\nI'm not exactly sure what it is,\nbut I can see the event level.\n\n542\n00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:21.870\nI can also see the Event ID, and the Event\nID's are really good because we could\n\n543\n00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:26.750\ntake these and plug these into a search\nengine, and just say, Event Error and\n\n544\n00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:28.540\nthen whatever the ID number is.\n\n545\n00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:30.611\nAnd you go up to Microsoft's\nknowledge base, and\n\n546\n00:27:30.611 --> 00:27:32.596\nwhen you go up to\nMicrosoft's knowledge base.\n\n547\n00:27:32.596 --> 00:27:36.900\nTypically, if you're seeing this error,\nsomebody before you has seen this error.\n\n548\n00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:40.470\nNow, it doesn't mean there's gonna\nbe a resolution to the error, but\n\n549\n00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:44.070\nit doesn't mean that you can get\na little bit more information about it.\n\n550\n00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:46.260\nAll right.\n\n551\n00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:48.710\nSo, that is a little bit\nabout a Event Viewer.\n\n552\n00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:52.930\nOne other one that I might say in here is,\nthe security logs.\n\n553\n00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:56.074\nSecurity logs happen or I should say,\n\n554\n00:27:56.074 --> 00:28:01.192\nan event is generated any time\nsomebody access to something.\n\n555\n00:28:01.192 --> 00:28:03.990\nIf you logon, that's a security event.\n\n556\n00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:06.710\nIf you logoff, that's a security event.\n\n557\n00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:11.020\nIf your system, in the background\nperforms some kind of event,\n\n558\n00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.860\nit's gonna create a security log here.\n\n559\n00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:16.590\nAll of that information is right\nhere in the security logs so\n\n560\n00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:18.568\nthat's another location that you can go.\n\n561\n00:28:18.568 --> 00:28:22.420\nThe applications and services log, I\nmight just take a second to mention that.\n\n562\n00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:26.715\nAnd the one that I really look at,\nyou do have hardware events here, but\n\n563\n00:28:26.715 --> 00:28:29.020\nunder Microsoft, and then Windows.\n\n564\n00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:33.920\nJust about any piece of software that\nruns in Windows will generate some kind\n\n565\n00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.310\nof application log.\n\n566\n00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:39.920\nSo, for instance,\nif I happen to do a disc clean-up, right.\n\n567\n00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:44.030\nAnd I want to find out\ninformation about that.\n\n568\n00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:48.684\nWell, I can actually scroll down\nhere a little bit and I do believe,\n\n569\n00:28:48.684 --> 00:28:50.328\nI don't see it in here.\n\n570\n00:28:50.328 --> 00:28:54.836\nSo, I stand corrected here, apparently\nthere isn't one in here about that.\n\n571\n00:28:54.836 --> 00:28:57.886\nBut, I will tell you there are some\nthat I have dealt with and\n\n572\n00:28:57.886 --> 00:28:59.534\nthat's BitLocker right here.\n\n573\n00:28:59.534 --> 00:29:03.686\nBranch cash and everybody's favorite,\n\n574\n00:29:03.686 --> 00:29:08.438\nif I can scroll down here and\nfind, there it is.\n\n575\n00:29:08.438 --> 00:29:12.172\nDan's gonna love this one, he's gonna\ncringe as I bring that one into view,\n\n576\n00:29:12.172 --> 00:29:12.930\ngroup policy.\n\n577\n00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:14.506\n&gt;&gt; I love group policy.\n\n578\n00:29:14.506 --> 00:29:15.879\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n579\n00:29:15.879 --> 00:29:20.111\nyou can see that we have ways to\nbasically trouble shoot if we will or\n\n580\n00:29:20.111 --> 00:29:24.724\ndiagnosis things that are related to\nthe Windows Operating System, and\n\n581\n00:29:24.724 --> 00:29:27.990\napplications surrounding\nthe operating system.\n\n582\n00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:31.300\nAll right, Dan so\nthat's a little bit about event viewer.\n\n583\n00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:33.160\nI know we're running\na little bit short on time.\n\n584\n00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:36.850\nGotta couple more that I'd like to\ntake care of in this part here.\n\n585\n00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:41.020\nAnd one of them, let me go ahead and close\ndown some of these other applications.\n\n586\n00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:43.790\nThe other one is gonna be in\nthe administrative tools, and\n\n587\n00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:45.973\nthat's what's gonna be known as services.\n\n588\n00:29:45.973 --> 00:29:49.934\nNow services here, keep in mind\nthat it is in computer management.\n\n589\n00:29:49.934 --> 00:29:52.450\nYou have seen it also in MS configuration,\nright?\n\n590\n00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:53.635\nIn your system configuration.\n\n591\n00:29:53.635 --> 00:29:56.289\nSo, there are a few different\nways that you can be of services.\n\n592\n00:29:56.289 --> 00:29:59.699\nYou can also do this from the task\nmanager too, but we're gonna go ahead and\n\n593\n00:29:59.699 --> 00:30:01.500\nwe'll bring up the services console.\n\n594\n00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:06.058\nAll right, and the services console gives\nme a good way, that if I want to look at\n\n595\n00:30:06.058 --> 00:30:10.900\nthese background processes that run on\nthe machine, I do have that ability.\n\n596\n00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:15.060\nAnd I could actually modify, how they\ninteract with the operating system for\n\n597\n00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:17.460\ninstance, their startup type.\n\n598\n00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:21.160\nDo I want them to start after the boot\nprocess is finished, the delayed start?\n\n599\n00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.010\nOr I just say, I need this right away,\n\n600\n00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:25.740\nI can start it as soon as\nthe computer boots up.\n\n601\n00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:26.670\nCould say manual.\n\n602\n00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:30.080\nWait till an application needs it,\nthen trigger the service to start.\n\n603\n00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.884\nSo, you may save yourself some\nresources in the background, right?\n\n604\n00:30:32.884 --> 00:30:35.750\nOr I can say, you know what I\ndon't want this running at all.\n\n605\n00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:37.480\nAnd it can be completely disabled.\n\n606\n00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.250\nYou can also start and\nstop services as well.\n\n607\n00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:43.760\nI'll tell you one that's probably gonna\nbe worth it's weight in gold here.\n\n608\n00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.060\nAnd that's something known as\nthe principle service, right.\n\n609\n00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:49.090\nIf you ever need to reboot the printer\ninside of your operating system.\n\n610\n00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:51.710\nHow do I reboot the service?\n\n611\n00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:55.430\nWell, that's good thing we have\nthe services console here.\n\n612\n00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:59.280\nCoz, I can scroll down to where\nI see the print spooler, and\n\n613\n00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:02.260\nI can view the, right click on it,\nview the properties of it.\n\n614\n00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:06.050\nAnd if I need to, start and\nstop it, well we can do that,\n\n615\n00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:08.610\nwe just use stop, stops the service.\n\n616\n00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:10.960\nThen we choose start and\nit starts the service.\n\n617\n00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:17.418\nAll right, so good way that you can\ninteract with those background processes.\n\n618\n00:31:17.418 --> 00:31:21.741\nDan, the last one I think I'm gonna do\nhere on system utilities is going to\n\n619\n00:31:21.741 --> 00:31:23.525\nbe one that can come in handy.\n\n620\n00:31:23.525 --> 00:31:25.540\nEspecially, if you think you\nmight have memory issues.\n\n621\n00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:28.558\nNow, when you look at diagnosing RAM,\n\n622\n00:31:28.558 --> 00:31:32.590\nyour random access memory\nthat's in your machine.\n\n623\n00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:36.110\nSometimes it's hard to tell whether you're\nhaving memory problems in a machine,\n\n624\n00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:39.480\nbecause it's usually sporadic,\nand it happens one time, and\n\n625\n00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.680\nthen it doesn't happen again.\n\n626\n00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.040\nAnd then it happens after a month.\n\n627\n00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.090\nAnd then it doesn't happen again.\n\n628\n00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:44.890\nSo, this is a good way\nyou can get in here,\n\n629\n00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:46.700\nyou can run the Windows Memory Diagnostic.\n\n630\n00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:47.560\nIt schedules it.\n\n631\n00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:49.030\nIt restarts your machine.\n\n632\n00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:54.470\nAnd then it runs some tests along your,\nthe memory that's in the system.\n\n633\n00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:55.520\nAnd you can see.\n\n634\n00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.570\nWe can restart it, or\nwe can reschedule it.\n\n635\n00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:00.740\nIt says, next time I start my computer up,\ngo ahead and run this program, and\n\n636\n00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:03.440\nsee if the memory has any issues.\n\n637\n00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:09.220\nWell Dan, that is the system utility\nportion of administrative tools,\n\n638\n00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.070\nand I know I've talked a lot here.\n\n639\n00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:14.340\nDan's giving me that evil eye,\nbut we do have more to go.\n\n640\n00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:16.260\n&gt;&gt; Wes,\njust thinks I'm the meanest guy around.\n\n641\n00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:19.750\nI'm standing here looking patiently at\nhim gone, this is good information.\n\n642\n00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:21.440\nI think our viewers are enjoying it.\n\n643\n00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.159\nAnd then you're listening to\nhim over here [INAUDIBLE].\n\n644\n00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.710\nBut, it is time for us to go.\n\n645\n00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:27.410\nAnd we do thank you,\nWes for joining us today.\n\n646\n00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:30.540\nA lot of great utilities that are built\ninto the Windows Operating System that we\n\n647\n00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:31.500\ndo need to be familiar with.\n\n648\n00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:34.810\nIt's gonna help us pass the exam, plus\nthey're great for us to just be familiar\n\n649\n00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:38.960\nwith so that we can work with our\ncomputers in a much easier fashion.\n\n650\n00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.090\nSo a lot of great stuff.\n\n651\n00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:41.370\nWe thank you Wes for that.\n\n652\n00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:45.014\nWe thank you guys for joining us today but\nit is time for us to sign off.\n\n653\n00:32:45.014 --> 00:32:46.950\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n654\n00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:48.198\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes

--> 00:00:14.023\n&gt;&gt; All right, greeting everyone and\n\n4\n00:00:14.023 --> 00:00:16.450\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.000\nI am your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n6\n00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.660\nAnd today, well, we're moving on with\none of our MTA, that's right, the 98349.\n\n7\n00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.260\nAnd joining us back again for\na part two and more the control panel\n\n8\n00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.640\narea of your Windows operating system,\nit's our friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.040\nWes, welcome back sir, how is it going?\n\n10\n00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.819\n&gt;&gt; It's going okay men,\nI gotta give you props, Dan hosts so\n\n11\n00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:38.990\nmany different shows around here, I don't\nknow how you keep those numbers straight.\n\n12\n00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.589\n&gt;&gt; I write them on this paper right here,\nand I read them.\n\n13\n00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:44.470\n&gt;&gt; Notes, yes, notes do happen.\n\n14\n00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.300\nThat's right guys, and\nit's great to be here by the way.\n\n15\n00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.520\nThat's right we're coming\nback with a part two, yeah,\n\n16\n00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.440\nI talk a lot and you guys are probably\nwatching the show, if not,\n\n17\n00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.140\nyou'll learn really quick that,\nyes, I do talk a lot.\n\n18\n00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.325\nWell, in the first one we started\ntalking about control panel,\n\n19\n00:00:58.325 --> 00:01:02.330\nkinda showed you a way how you could\nmodify the look of control panel depending\n\n20\n00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.870\non whether you want category view, or\n\n21\n00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.090\nyou wanna see all of the utilities that\nyou can use inside of the control panel.\n\n22\n00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.100\nWe also started looking at some of the\nadministrative utilities, if you remember,\n\n23\n00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.850\nif not go back and watch that\nthen come back and join us here.\n\n24\n00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.650\nWe talked about computer management,\nwe talked about system configuration,\n\n25\n00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.640\nsystem information,\nevent viewer, services,\n\n26\n00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.510\nand the Windows memory diagnostic\nutility is what we left off on.\n\n27\n00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.230\nHowever, there are a few other\nones that we wanna talk about.\n\n28\n00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.379\nSo let's go ahead,\nwe'll dive right back into it, and\n\n29\n00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:32.950\nI've got my Windows 10 machine here.\n\n30\n00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.790\nWe're gonna right click on the Windows\nicon, we're gonna choose control panel.\n\n31\n00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.980\nRemember, if you were in the category\nview, it's gonna be system and security.\n\n32\n00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.490\nAnd then at the bottom of system and\nsecurity, we're gonna see,\n\n33\n00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.300\nwell, administrative tools, right here.\n\n34\n00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.680\nWe'll go ahead and launch those back up.\n\n35\n00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.890\nAnd, like I said, we've got a few\nmore that we wanna talk about.\n\n36\n00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.800\nThe first ones group of\nutilities that we are going to\n\n37\n00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.350\ntalk about is what you can use to help\nmaintain your storage, for instance,\n\n38\n00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.580\nwe have what's known as defragment and\noptimized drives.\n\n39\n00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.768\nNow, for\nthose of you maybe that have been,\n\n40\n00:02:05.768 --> 00:02:09.908\ncome from all the way back from Windows XP\ndays and, well, really even Windows 7,\n\n41\n00:02:09.908 --> 00:02:12.646\nyou might have heard it\ncalled the disk defragmenter.\n\n42\n00:02:12.646 --> 00:02:17.208\nAnd then if you come in here you're like\nwhere did it go, what happened to it?\n\n43\n00:02:17.208 --> 00:02:20.850\nWell, nothing has changed, it's just a new\ncode of paint over a technology that we've\n\n44\n00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.640\nhad for a while and\nit does exactly what it sounds like.\n\n45\n00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.840\nIt's a defragmenter.\n\n46\n00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.900\nAnd if I decide to open this,\nyou will see that we have the ability.\n\n47\n00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.678\nNow, understand optimization is\nnot available on these drives and\n\n48\n00:02:34.678 --> 00:02:36.940\nI'll give you a reason here in a second.\n\n49\n00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.626\nYour hard drive overuse, all right, if\nyou've got a traditional mechanical drive,\n\n50\n00:02:43.626 --> 00:02:47.726\nwhat can happen is from the movement of\nthe files being placed on the physical\n\n51\n00:02:47.726 --> 00:02:50.180\nmedium over time, they can get fragmented.\n\n52\n00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.070\nAnd what that does is causes\nperformance hindrances.\n\n53\n00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.740\nSo in order to rearrange those pieces in\na contiguous block making it easier for\n\n54\n00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.160\nthe operating system and\nthe drive controller to find that data,\n\n55\n00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.360\nwhat you do is you come in here and\nyou do an optimization on it.\n\n56\n00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.270\nWhen you optimize it,\n\n57\n00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.080\nessentially what you're doing\nis you're doing a defrag on it.\n\n58\n00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.340\nAgain, that's why they call it\ndefragment and drive optimizer here.\n\n59\n00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.640\nNotice you have analyze and\nyou have optimize.\n\n60\n00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.990\nBy analyze,\nit just do I need to defragment it?\n\n61\n00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.780\nDo I need to optimize it, if you will?\n\n62\n00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.000\nChances are, if you go through\nthe analyze process, you're\n\n63\n00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.180\nprobably gonna find out that you need to\ngo ahead and do the optimize process.\n\n64\n00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.430\nNow, you might say, well, Wes,\nwhy would I use one over the other?\n\n65\n00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.220\nWell, that's up to you.\n\n66\n00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.080\nKeep in mind that if you have\na two terabyte drive in here and\n\n67\n00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.840\ndrives are scaling up larger and\nlarger and\n\n68\n00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.420\nlarger, an analyzation is just\ngonna go through it one time.\n\n69\n00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.320\nIt's gonna do a pretty quick job of the\nanalysis, but then when you actually start\n\n70\n00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.450\nmoving the pieces around and it starts\nto defragment, it could take a while.\n\n71\n00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.770\nAnd that's why you might wanna\ndo an analyzation and you say,\n\n72\n00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.670\nokay, well,\nthis drive is 55% fragmented, right?\n\n73\n00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.810\nIt's in need of optimization, but\nit's a 2TB drive, I might decide\n\n74\n00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.170\nthat I wanna do that, run that at 5\no'clock as I'm leaving the office for\n\n75\n00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.520\nthe day and then I can come back\ntomorrow and it'll be done.\n\n76\n00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.970\nBecause if you do this during work hours,\n\n77\n00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.480\nyou could see even more of a performance\nhindrance inside of your overall system.\n\n78\n00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.460\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, something that jumps out at\nme real quick, I mean, as soon as you\n\n79\n00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.630\nblew that up so we could see it really\nwell, is that it's kinda grayed out.\n\n80\n00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.060\nIt's like the options aren't available for\nyou.\n\n81\n00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.660\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and\n\n82\n00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.000\nwhat they don't want you to do is\nwhat we do from time to time, right?\n\n83\n00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.490\nWe go click happy on something and\n\n84\n00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.640\nwe get in here and we accidentally click\naround here and we start something.\n\n85\n00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.170\nWell, this is an administrative\nprivileged tasks.\n\n86\n00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.690\nThis, you have to be an administrator.\n\n87\n00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.580\nNow, again, I know you might say,\nwell, Wes, yeah, but\n\n88\n00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.430\nyou're in administrative tools, of course,\nwe know you need to be an administrator.\n\n89\n00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.390\nWell, I am an administrator\non this machine and\n\n90\n00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.800\nif you've seen in part one of\nthis episode, if you will,\n\n91\n00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.760\nnot every one of these utilities requires\nadministrator level privileges to launch.\n\n92\n00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.530\nThis one on the other hand, it does not\nrequire an administrative level privilege\n\n93\n00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.970\nto launch but if you wanna work with it,\nthis is where you have to change settings.\n\n94\n00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.230\nWhen you change the settings,\nthis is where I can start to, and\n\n95\n00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.350\nI will tell you why these are grayed out\nfor more, you notice the shields are gone\n\n96\n00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.690\nfrom them, that's because of\nthis little thing right here,\n\n97\n00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.620\nnotice it says optimization\nisn't available.\n\n98\n00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.860\nYou might be saying, well,\nwait a second, Wes, this utility is so\n\n99\n00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.460\ngood that you can't use it.\n\n100\n00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.450\nNo, that's not what the case is.\n\n101\n00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.530\nThese are solid state drives that I\nhave inside of this machine, all right?\n\n102\n00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:29.550\nAnd because of that fact,\n\n103\n00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.660\nsolid state drives do not work the same\nas traditional mechanical drives.\n\n104\n00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.650\nAnd what Windows supports and has it has\nsince Windows 7 is an option called, trim.\n\n105\n00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:39.630\nIn which it,\n\n106\n00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.960\nI always think of it as trimming off the\nfat, getting rid of what you don't need.\n\n107\n00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.900\nIt does that the moment you perform a file\ndeletion or you're moving files around.\n\n108\n00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.230\nIt optimizes it on the fly for you,\n\n109\n00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.850\nso solid state drives do not\nbenefit from a defragment.\n\n110\n00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.970\nIn fact, it actually hinders their\noverall lifetime because you're\n\n111\n00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.230\nbasically just shortening the overall\nlifespan of a solid state drive.\n\n112\n00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.350\nSo that's why you can see\nthat they're grayed out.\n\n113\n00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.920\nThe other reason, two, that they were\ngrayed out even if you did have your\n\n114\n00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.250\nmechanical drives, this is cuz it does\nrequire an administrative level privilege.\n\n115\n00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.690\nNow that being said, there's another one\nin here and it's called disk cleanup, and\n\n116\n00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.860\nwe can see that one right\nunder the disk defragmenter.\n\n117\n00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.650\nAnd I'm always gonna call it that,\nbecause that's what I've been\n\n118\n00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.040\nused to it being called for\nthe last four operating systems.\n\n119\n00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.730\nThis one is called disk cleanup,\nand this one is actually a really,\n\n120\n00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.270\nreally, cool utility.\n\n121\n00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.670\nLet me see if I can, I guess it's\nnot gonna give me the option here.\n\n122\n00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.250\nNow, disk cleanup,\nwhat does this allow you to do?\n\n123\n00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.990\nThis allows you to scan your hard drive,\nin fact, let's go ahead and\n\n124\n00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.890\nlet's see if we can scan.\n\n125\n00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:42.570\nI don't think I have\na big hard drive in here.\n\n126\n00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:43.760\nWe'll let it run.\n\n127\n00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.590\nNow, over the course of you using\nyour operating system, right?\n\n128\n00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.340\nYou will have things like log files,\n\n129\n00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.510\nyou'll have excess application\ninstallation files that are left behind.\n\n130\n00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.350\nYou could have things like system files,\nagain, logs really a lot of times.\n\n131\n00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.010\nTemporary Internet files\nthat are in your browser.\n\n132\n00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.860\nAll of these can hinder\nthe performance of your drive, right?\n\n133\n00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.250\nIt's unnecessary files that you no\nlonger need on your hard drive,\n\n134\n00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:11.760\nso wouldn't it be nice to have a utility\nthat allows us to clean them up, right?\n\n135\n00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.270\nWell, that's exactly what this is doing.\n\n136\n00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:16.210\nSo it's running in the background, and\nthen what it's gonna give me the option\n\n137\n00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:20.950\nto do is once it generates and\nit analyzes every location\n\n138\n00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:26.880\nin the operating system where it thinks\nthat these excess unnecessary files are,\n\n139\n00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.470\nit's gonna go ahead and it's gonna give\nyou an output that says, all right,\n\n140\n00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.880\ndo you wanna clean these files up?\n\n141\n00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.900\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nwe'll let that run and\n\n142\n00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.950\nwe'll come back to it\nhere in a minute there.\n\n143\n00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:37.550\nSo that's the disk cleanup,\nand like I said,\n\n144\n00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:38.940\nI'm gonna let this run\nin the background and\n\n145\n00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:43.130\nwe'll show you guys what it\nlooks like when it finishes.\n\n146\n00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.270\nNow, the next one I just wanna mention,\n\n147\n00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.610\nI do believe it's a little bit farther\nthan what you need on the exam.\n\n148\n00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.381\nBut if you have things like devices.\n\n149\n00:07:51.381 --> 00:07:52.309\n&gt;&gt; Bless you.\n\n150\n00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:53.344\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n151\n00:07:53.344 --> 00:07:56.856\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You are absolutely right, but\nif you have things like SAN storaged area\n\n152\n00:07:56.856 --> 00:07:59.610\nnetwork on your network and\nyou need to connect to them Then,\n\n153\n00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:03.466\none of the ways you need to be able to do\nthat, typically, is through SCSI commands.\n\n154\n00:08:03.466 --> 00:08:07.300\nWell, the iSCSI is,\nit stands for Internet SCSI.\n\n155\n00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.710\nIn fact, our disk clean up just came up.\n\n156\n00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.170\nLet me go ahead and finish this,\nwe'll get right back to that.\n\n157\n00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:15.150\nAnd if I need this machine to connect\nover the network with the Internet SCSI\n\n158\n00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.188\nprotocol, iSCSI,\nthis is the way that I would do it.\n\n159\n00:08:18.188 --> 00:08:21.540\nSo, you could launch up your\niSCSI initiator, all right, and\n\n160\n00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.110\nthe service isn't running here guys cuz,\nagain, I'm not connected to a SAN and\n\n161\n00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:26.860\nI don't need to be connected to a SAN.\n\n162\n00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:31.760\nBut I could start the service up here,\nand then, launch the SCSI initiator.\n\n163\n00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.290\nAnd I could point it to a target,\n\n164\n00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:36.050\nwhich would allow me to connect\nto the storage area network.\n\n165\n00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:38.642\nSo, I do mention that one\nin the context storage.\n\n166\n00:08:38.642 --> 00:08:42.265\nHowever, I do believe it's going to be\na little bit more than what you would\n\n167\n00:08:42.265 --> 00:08:44.775\nneed to know on the 98349 exam.\n\n168\n00:08:44.775 --> 00:08:47.805\nNow, in the background,\nyou might have seen that disk clean up for\n\n169\n00:08:47.805 --> 00:08:51.333\nC does look like it has finished and\nwe can kind of look at these, Dan.\n\n170\n00:08:51.333 --> 00:08:54.621\nYou see setup logs,\ndownloaded program files,\n\n171\n00:08:54.621 --> 00:08:59.524\ntemporary Internet files,\nyou can see the Windows reporting service.\n\n172\n00:08:59.524 --> 00:09:03.635\nIt might have archived information here,\nand you can see some different things.\n\n173\n00:09:03.635 --> 00:09:07.231\nRecycle bin, temporary files,\nand there are a few of them here.\n\n174\n00:09:07.231 --> 00:09:11.630\nNow, I will tell you and I want you\nto be aware of this, let me see.\n\n175\n00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:14.300\nI don't think I have this on my machine,\nbut let's go ahead and\n\n176\n00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.270\ndo a little walkabout here.\n\n177\n00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:18.690\nI'm gonna go down to our Local Disk C.\n\n178\n00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:22.981\nOkay, I don't have in this location\na folder called Windows.old.\n\n179\n00:09:22.981 --> 00:09:24.340\nLet me tell you what this is.\n\n180\n00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.650\nIf you do an upgrade of your\nWindows operating system, or\n\n181\n00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:33.200\nif you do a new installation, what it\ndoes, if you don't format your hard drive,\n\n182\n00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.850\nit places a windows.old folder\nthat is the exact size of Windows.\n\n183\n00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:41.670\nCould be 30 gigs, could be 40, could\nbe 60 gigs, and it puts it right here.\n\n184\n00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.070\nIf you try to right-click on that and\n\n185\n00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:46.230\ndelete that,\nthis location is a system location.\n\n186\n00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:47.640\nYou're gonna have to close down,\n\n187\n00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.900\nI don't know how many, but\nquite a few of these access denied.\n\n188\n00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:55.950\nThat's not the way you delete the old\ninstallation files, all right?\n\n189\n00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.255\nThe way you're supposed to delete these\ninstallation files is through disk\n\n190\n00:09:59.255 --> 00:09:59.831\nclean-up.\n\n191\n00:09:59.831 --> 00:10:03.630\nAnd I'm not goinna make this scan because\nthat's really the only thing that it adds.\n\n192\n00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:06.260\nIt adds a couple more things\nincluding old windows installations.\n\n193\n00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:11.070\nSo, if I was to re-run this under\nthe context of a systems administration or\n\n194\n00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:12.740\na windows administrator if you will.\n\n195\n00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.570\nIt would also put the previous\ninstallation files in there, and\n\n196\n00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.350\nI could successfully delete that\nwithout all of those problems.\n\n197\n00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.800\nSo, I just really wanna throw\nthat out there as a titbit.\n\n198\n00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.160\nI wouldn't worry about it on the exam.\n\n199\n00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.598\nBut that can definitely help\nyou in the real world, and\n\n200\n00:10:25.598 --> 00:10:30.230\nsave you a lot of time sitting there\nclicking OK, OK, OK, to about 100\n\n201\n00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:35.283\naccess denied little Windows so we'll\ngo ahead and we'll select all of these.\n\n202\n00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.770\nAnd we'll kind of show\nyou what it does here.\n\n203\n00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:45.260\nAgain just a way to clean\nup these temporary files.\n\n204\n00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.880\nNow there's other ways that you\ncan clean up temp files too.\n\n205\n00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.900\nBut that's not for this episode today.\n\n206\n00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.080\nIf you know where the locations of some of\nthese temp files are you can always go and\n\n207\n00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.060\nmanually delete them.\n\n208\n00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:56.820\nBu that's the purpose of disk cleanup.\n\n209\n00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:00.880\nIf I've got a GUI that's gonna allow, that\nor a application that's gonna do it for\n\n210\n00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.020\nme, why not just go ahead and run through,\nand let the application do it,\n\n211\n00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.260\nand there we go.\n\n212\n00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:06.030\nJust that easy.\n\n213\n00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:10.799\nSo, you do have an administrative utility,\nor administrative tool, excuse me.\n\n214\n00:11:10.799 --> 00:11:13.990\nYou do have Storage utilities\nthat you could use to manage and\n\n215\n00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:16.230\nmaintain the storage\non a day to day basis.\n\n216\n00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:21.830\nNow, one last thing that I will say and\nthen I'm gonna kind of jump ahead to and\n\n217\n00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:25.120\nI'm gonna talk about\nautomation as it relates to\n\n218\n00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:30.090\nadministrative tools because it's directly\nrelated back to the disc defragmenter.\n\n219\n00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.460\nInside of our administrative tools,\n\n220\n00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:37.230\nwe have this task scheduler option,\nall right.\n\n221\n00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:40.820\nI wanna make mention of this in\ncontext with disk defragmenter.\n\n222\n00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:45.090\nSince Windows Vista, your disk\ndefragmentation, if Windows realizes you\n\n223\n00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:48.810\ndon't have a solid state drive,\nis actually in the task scheduler.\n\n224\n00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:52.340\nTask scheduler is a way that you can\nautomate day to day processes so\n\n225\n00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:57.940\nthat you don't have to go through and\nmanually click on these different\n\n226\n00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.630\nicons if you will, an application for\ninstance that you just cleaned up.\n\n227\n00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:06.000\nI could also schedule a disk\ncleanup to run at a certain time,\n\n228\n00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.620\nevery week, so\nthat I know that it's gonna happen.\n\n229\n00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:12.710\nWell disk defragmenter since Vista is\nactually part of your task scheduler.\n\n230\n00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:13.950\nSo it's supposed to run.\n\n231\n00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:16.960\nAt idle times in the back ground\nwhen you're not using the computer.\n\n232\n00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.240\nBut you wanna throw that out there.\n\n233\n00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:22.120\nBut there might be times when maybe you\nwanna just force it to go ahead and\n\n234\n00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.850\nrun your defragmentation you can do that.\n\n235\n00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:28.030\nAnd it also helps us to just kind\nof talk about task scheduler.\n\n236\n00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:31.500\nTask scheduler again guys, like I said,\nis like a way you can come in here and\n\n237\n00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.850\nwe an automate certain processes here.\n\n238\n00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:37.520\nUnder windows you will see there are all\nkinds of little things we can do.\n\n239\n00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.510\nFor instance if I wanted to\ndo a check disk, you know,\n\n240\n00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:44.820\nthe old DSK that I could\nrun from the command line.\n\n241\n00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:45.540\nI could come in here and\n\n242\n00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:50.950\nI could tell windows I don't wanna have\nto open up my command line, right?\n\n243\n00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:55.920\nAnd then type CMD, and\nI know this isn't that big of a deal,\n\n244\n00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.210\nexcept for I can't spell it.\n\n245\n00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:02.880\nBut I could run it, come in here and\nmanually run it, right?\n\n246\n00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.820\nNot really a big deal All right?\n\n247\n00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.110\nBut what if Dan calls me\nas my administrator and\n\n248\n00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:09.980\nsays hey Wes I need you\nto go to this location.\n\n249\n00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.510\nAnd I need to make sure that that\ncomputer's running CheckDisk.\n\n250\n00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:17.220\nWell is he gonna ask me every\nWednesday to go out to that location?\n\n251\n00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.090\nWell he could, or\nI could say you know what Dan?\n\n252\n00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.490\nI tell you what,\nI'll just put a task scheduler out there.\n\n253\n00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:23.930\nI'll connect to it remotely,\nI'll set a task.\n\n254\n00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:26.220\nAnd it'll run it everyday at Wednesday.\n\n255\n00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.030\nNow, a hands off, hands free approach\nis good, and I don't have to\n\n256\n00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:31.680\nworry about getting my hands dirty\ndown here in the command prompt.\n\n257\n00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.930\nSo, again, Task Scheduler,\nvery good utility.\n\n258\n00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:35.830\nI've used it before.\n\n259\n00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:41.090\nI've used it for media players to wake up\nmachines, to record my favorite video and\n\n260\n00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:42.480\nthen shut the machine down so\n\n261\n00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.630\nI didn't have to be there\nif I was teaching at night.\n\n262\n00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:47.520\nBecause we do that [LAUGH]\nfrom time to time.\n\n263\n00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.780\nOr I have in my past.\n\n264\n00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:49.650\nYeah Wes, totally.\n\n265\n00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:54.280\nThe automation portion of your Windows\nsystem, it's there for a very good reason.\n\n266\n00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.520\nGo ahead and use it to your advantage.\n\n267\n00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.390\nIt's nice to be able to set and\nforget things.\n\n268\n00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.900\nLet's stop using our computers\nas manually as possible,\n\n269\n00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.310\nlet's automate as much\nAs humanly possible.\n\n270\n00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:05.240\nIt's a great tool,\nI'm glad you brought it up.\n\n271\n00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know, as you get more into\nadministration you're gonna start to\n\n272\n00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:12.820\nrealize the more you can automate\nthings the easier your life becomes.\n\n273\n00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:16.200\nSo, anything that we can set it and\nforget it,\n\n274\n00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:21.200\nI guess is the way we always like\nto say it, makes life very easy.\n\n275\n00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.280\nNow the next place that we're\ngonna go is we're gonna look.\n\n276\n00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.730\nWe're still in administrative tools,\n\n277\n00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.580\nI said like we're going on a journey\nhere but we're actually gonna\n\n278\n00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:31.690\nlook at some security utilities that\nwe have inside of administrative tools.\n\n279\n00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:32.940\nIn fact, if we go ahead and\n\n280\n00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:37.230\nlook here you'll see See that we've got\none called local security policy and\n\n281\n00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:39.840\nlet me see if I have already got this\npulled up just to make sure I don't.\n\n282\n00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.330\nOkay I'm gonna go and double click on\nthis, there is a couple of different ways\n\n283\n00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.130\nthat you can lauch this and I want\nyou to have and be aware of this for\n\n284\n00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:51.780\nthe exam Here in administrative tools\nlike you've just seen, hence the episode.\n\n285\n00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:55.940\nBut I also want you to know that if you\nright click, or actually in my search\n\n286\n00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:04.540\nfield if I decide to just type\nS-E-C-P-O-L.msc, secpol as I say.\n\n287\n00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:07.100\nThat also launches\nthe local security policy.\n\n288\n00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:13.960\nLike the Windows exams, like to do from\ntime to time, is they like to test\n\n289\n00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:19.310\nyour abilities to get different locations\njust, multiple ways to get to the same\n\n290\n00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:23.546\nutility and, boy, I tell you in Windows,\nthere are usually is six [INAUDIBLE] and\n\n291\n00:15:23.546 --> 00:15:25.863\nthe other ways to get to\nall of these utilities.\n\n292\n00:15:25.863 --> 00:15:27.910\nNow, what is the local security policy?\n\n293\n00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:33.800\nWell Local security policy is\na subset of settings, okay,\n\n294\n00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:39.130\nthat are part of a larger collection\nof settings called group policy, right?\n\n295\n00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:43.568\nGroup policy has thousands of settings\nthat you can manipulate, modify and\n\n296\n00:15:43.568 --> 00:15:46.689\nchange the settings from\nthe run time environment and\n\n297\n00:15:46.689 --> 00:15:50.039\nconfigure the computer to run\nexactly the away you want.\n\n298\n00:15:50.039 --> 00:15:54.733\nLocal security policies says let's\ntake the security-centric settings and\n\n299\n00:15:54.733 --> 00:15:57.304\npull them out of the group policy console.\n\n300\n00:15:57.304 --> 00:16:00.060\nAnd we'll put these into\nthis security console,\n\n301\n00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.234\nhence the term local security policy.\n\n302\n00:16:02.234 --> 00:16:03.568\nLet me go ahead and\nshow you what I mean here.\n\n303\n00:16:03.568 --> 00:16:06.493\nIf I was to launch up\nsomething known as GP edit,\n\n304\n00:16:06.493 --> 00:16:09.359\nthat's our group policy management editor.\n\n305\n00:16:09.359 --> 00:16:12.745\nOnce this comes up you'll see\nthat they are just tons and\n\n306\n00:16:12.745 --> 00:16:14.341\ntons of settings in here.\n\n307\n00:16:14.341 --> 00:16:17.572\nAnd it really does configures\nthe run time environment.\n\n308\n00:16:17.572 --> 00:16:19.737\nIt configures all aspects of the machines.\n\n309\n00:16:19.737 --> 00:16:21.605\nUsually, you don't do\nthis in a local sense.\n\n310\n00:16:21.605 --> 00:16:24.613\nYou'll see that this is\nthe local group policy editor.\n\n311\n00:16:24.613 --> 00:16:28.490\nMost of the time that we do this, we do\nthis through active directory in group\n\n312\n00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:32.690\npolicy that's push out by another\ncomputer to the entire organization.\n\n313\n00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:36.953\nBecause this is a very hands-on approach,\nand it's a very decentralized model.\n\n314\n00:16:36.953 --> 00:16:38.701\nBut if I come into here, and\n\n315\n00:16:38.701 --> 00:16:43.569\nI look at security settings inside of\nthe group policy management consult.\n\n316\n00:16:43.569 --> 00:16:46.157\nYou'll notice that I have,\nwell, a few security settings.\n\n317\n00:16:46.157 --> 00:16:48.961\nNotice, account policies, local policies.\n\n318\n00:16:48.961 --> 00:16:53.979\nBut if we sit here and come back, and we\nconfigure or compare these to what we see.\n\n319\n00:16:53.979 --> 00:16:59.304\nIn the local security policy, you're gonna\nnotice that they're pretty much the same.\n\n320\n00:16:59.304 --> 00:17:03.353\nI don't know if, well,\nit's kinda hard to see that like that.\n\n321\n00:17:03.353 --> 00:17:06.220\nI'll try that again there, there we go.\n\n322\n00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:11.970\nNotice that if I click on these, you can\nsee that they're exactly the same, right?\n\n323\n00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:13.519\nAccount policies, account policies.\n\n324\n00:17:13.519 --> 00:17:17.786\nSo what this does is it says, let's take\nthose security settings out of the group\n\n325\n00:17:17.786 --> 00:17:20.378\npolicy consul and\nput them in a single location.\n\n326\n00:17:20.378 --> 00:17:24.182\nSo that if you just need to manage\nsecurity on your local machine,\n\n327\n00:17:24.182 --> 00:17:25.849\nyou can do this a lot easier.\n\n328\n00:17:25.849 --> 00:17:27.043\nAnd there are various settings.\n\n329\n00:17:27.043 --> 00:17:29.034\nIn fact, one of the things that I had,\n\n330\n00:17:29.034 --> 00:17:32.158\nI actually had to use this Dan\nto set up our lab environment.\n\n331\n00:17:32.158 --> 00:17:36.532\nIn our first part of this when we did\nremote communications, your remote\n\n332\n00:17:36.532 --> 00:17:41.623\nnetworking, or, excuse me, I'm sorry,\nremote management doesn't work unless\n\n333\n00:17:41.623 --> 00:17:46.664\nyour network location is set to a private\nor what it usually is, a domain location.\n\n334\n00:17:46.664 --> 00:17:50.902\nIt closes down certain things in\nthe firewall unless you have those network\n\n335\n00:17:50.902 --> 00:17:51.849\nlocation sets.\n\n336\n00:17:51.849 --> 00:17:55.319\nSo I actually had to launch\nup our local security policy,\n\n337\n00:17:55.319 --> 00:17:57.280\nlet me show you what I mean here.\n\n338\n00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:01.011\nAnd I had to modify\nthe Network List Managers policy here and\n\n339\n00:18:01.011 --> 00:18:05.491\nsay unidentified networks,\nbecause my network adapter in Windows was\n\n340\n00:18:05.491 --> 00:18:09.160\nviewing my current network\nconnection as unidentified.\n\n341\n00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.459\nAny unidentified network is just\nassigned to public profile.\n\n342\n00:18:12.459 --> 00:18:16.621\nAnd that really locks down your machine,\nand it closes off remote administration.\n\n343\n00:18:16.621 --> 00:18:18.145\nSo, I actually had to use this.\n\n344\n00:18:18.145 --> 00:18:21.050\nI came in here and I modified the setting.\n\n345\n00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:23.584\nAnd you can see it's not set on this\none but it's set on the other one,\n\n346\n00:18:23.584 --> 00:18:24.380\nthe other computer.\n\n347\n00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:28.658\nI had to change this to private and\nbefore I actually configure this,\n\n348\n00:18:28.658 --> 00:18:31.329\njust to show you how this works instantly.\n\n349\n00:18:31.329 --> 00:18:33.610\nIf I open my Network and Sharing Center,\n\n350\n00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:37.852\nnotice that it says Unidentified network\nand it says Public network here.\n\n351\n00:18:37.852 --> 00:18:42.524\nWell, there are certain times in our lab\nenvironment that we're using demonstrating\n\n352\n00:18:42.524 --> 00:18:46.558\nhere at ITProTV, that I need that to\nbe public, or not public it is public.\n\n353\n00:18:46.558 --> 00:18:47.709\nExcuse me, private.\n\n354\n00:18:47.709 --> 00:18:50.973\nSo when I turn the setting and I say okay,\n\n355\n00:18:50.973 --> 00:18:55.968\nUnidentified Networks,\nI wanna make private I choose, OK.\n\n356\n00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:58.439\nAnd then I come back to that location.\n\n357\n00:18:59.941 --> 00:19:03.779\nYou're gonna notice now and\nUnidentified network is a Private network.\n\n358\n00:19:03.779 --> 00:19:04.965\nAnd that's what it's doing,\n\n359\n00:19:04.965 --> 00:19:07.026\nit's configuring some of\nthose security settings.\n\n360\n00:19:07.026 --> 00:19:08.157\nYou say wait a second Wes,\n\n361\n00:19:08.157 --> 00:19:11.254\nhow does network location have\nanything to do with security settings?\n\n362\n00:19:11.254 --> 00:19:13.073\nYou're gonna have to wait for\nthat for another episode.\n\n363\n00:19:13.073 --> 00:19:16.553\nIt is a suite of security configurations\nthat we can configure, hence,\n\n364\n00:19:16.553 --> 00:19:18.957\nwe can configure it to\nthe local security policy.\n\n365\n00:19:18.957 --> 00:19:23.244\nNow, one that's really important\ninside of our Administrative Tools,\n\n366\n00:19:23.244 --> 00:19:27.392\nlet me close down all these extra\nwindows open, I think I got a few here,\n\n367\n00:19:27.392 --> 00:19:30.318\nis the Windows Firewall\nwith Advanced Security.\n\n368\n00:19:30.318 --> 00:19:31.570\nCouple of different firewalls.\n\n369\n00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:34.132\nWe're not gonna go into\nthis too much right now,\n\n370\n00:19:34.132 --> 00:19:38.207\nbecause we do have an episode that's\ngonna talk about the Windows Firewall.\n\n371\n00:19:38.207 --> 00:19:42.743\nBut the Windows Firewall with Advanced\nSecurity, one of their things that it\n\n372\n00:19:42.743 --> 00:19:47.072\nmakes it advanced is cuz we can\ncustomize individual configurations with\n\n373\n00:19:47.072 --> 00:19:50.520\nwhat are called rules that\nallow traffic or deny traffic.\n\n374\n00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:54.088\nBut with the basic firewall we\ncan just apply that to a program.\n\n375\n00:19:54.088 --> 00:19:56.450\nAll right,\nI could say Remote Desktop here,\n\n376\n00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:59.198\nyou can communicate through the firewall,\nright?\n\n377\n00:19:59.198 --> 00:20:02.783\nWith the Windows Firewall\nwith advanced security,\n\n378\n00:20:02.783 --> 00:20:07.100\nif I decide that I want it setup\nsomething like Remote Desktop,\n\n379\n00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:11.100\nI have the ability to get even\nmore specific, if you will.\n\n380\n00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:15.140\nAnd really, really get granular with\nmy rules rather than just saying\n\n381\n00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.890\nRemote Desktop won't turn it on and\nallow you.\n\n382\n00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:21.700\nYou can see that there are quite\na few different options, right?\n\n383\n00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:26.318\nAnd you can see they also apply to the\ndifferent profiles that we were talking\n\n384\n00:20:26.318 --> 00:20:26.831\nabout.\n\n385\n00:20:26.831 --> 00:20:30.030\nThe other thing that you can do\nhere is you can set up things.\n\n386\n00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:33.283\nFor instance, IPsec or\nInternet protocol security,\n\n387\n00:20:33.283 --> 00:20:37.104\nI would believe that far beyond\nthe MTA but exam knowing IPsec but\n\n388\n00:20:37.104 --> 00:20:41.915\njust to understand that inside of Windows\nFirewall with Advanced Security we can\n\n389\n00:20:41.915 --> 00:20:46.653\nget really advanced, and we can set it\nup internet protocol security rules that\n\n390\n00:20:46.653 --> 00:20:51.292\nInsure that our communications are\nencrypted and protected on our network.\n\n391\n00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:53.760\nSo, really cool utility to have.\n\n392\n00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:57.536\nYou can also monitor all the rules\nwhether they're inbound or outbound in to\n\n393\n00:20:57.536 --> 00:21:01.321\nthe firewall or I'm communicating Al,\nI can see what the current state is.\n\n394\n00:21:01.321 --> 00:21:02.601\nI can expand this out.\n\n395\n00:21:02.601 --> 00:21:06.165\nChoose firewall and\nit shows me all of my rules that are on.\n\n396\n00:21:06.165 --> 00:21:08.810\nYou'll notice that when I was\nlooking at inbound rules.\n\n397\n00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:12.825\nNotice how, if I scroll down,\nsome of them don't have green check marks,\n\n398\n00:21:12.825 --> 00:21:14.879\nit means they're not on, all right?\n\n399\n00:21:14.879 --> 00:21:16.848\nSo, that information might\nnot really be useful to you.\n\n400\n00:21:16.848 --> 00:21:20.544\nIf you just wanna currently see\nwhat is on, I'm not looking for\n\n401\n00:21:20.544 --> 00:21:23.962\nanything specifically,\nI can just go to Firewall here and\n\n402\n00:21:23.962 --> 00:21:27.891\nI can just see what's on versus\nwhat is there but isn't turned on.\n\n403\n00:21:27.891 --> 00:21:29.850\n&gt;&gt; And that can be confusing\nwhen it comes to firewalls.\n\n404\n00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:31.929\nNot that we're trying to confuse you, but\n\n405\n00:21:31.929 --> 00:21:35.007\nthere might be a rule that says\nallow this and it's on, right?\n\n406\n00:21:35.007 --> 00:21:37.600\nBut if it's off,\nit doesn't allow it, right?\n\n407\n00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.500\nOr the opposite is true,\nif it says disallow this, and it's on\n\n408\n00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:44.519\nthen it's disallowing it, but if it's not\nturned on then it's allowing it, right?\n\n409\n00:21:44.519 --> 00:21:47.681\nSo it can get really a little hinky,\nand so Wes said it's\n\n410\n00:21:47.681 --> 00:21:52.407\ngonna be a whole show unto itself, it can\nbe ten shows, it's a lot of information.\n\n411\n00:21:52.407 --> 00:21:56.127\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, in fact I know Dan right\nnow in the background is working with\n\n412\n00:21:56.127 --> 00:21:57.808\na couple of programs that needs.\n\n413\n00:21:57.808 --> 00:22:02.617\nExcess fire wall configuration so,\nwe haven't even scratched the surface yet.\n\n414\n00:22:02.617 --> 00:22:06.649\nSo, just understand that you have a lot\nmore granular control in here with\n\n415\n00:22:06.649 --> 00:22:11.880\nthe Windows Firewall with Advanced\nSecurity, then you do the basic firewall.\n\n416\n00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.926\nSo those are some of the security ones,\n\n417\n00:22:13.926 --> 00:22:17.711\ncouple of the other ones that I do\nwant to look at is performance, right?\n\n418\n00:22:17.711 --> 00:22:20.142\nWhen we talk about performance\na couple of the ones,\n\n419\n00:22:20.142 --> 00:22:22.583\nwe kind of mentioned\nperformance monitor already.\n\n420\n00:22:22.583 --> 00:22:27.118\nThis is a way that I can look at\nstatistical information based on\n\n421\n00:22:27.118 --> 00:22:31.669\nthe attributes of a component\ninside of the operating system.\n\n422\n00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:34.978\nAnd I wanna see for instance,\nhow it's performance is in real time,\n\n423\n00:22:34.978 --> 00:22:38.761\nI could come in here to the performance\nmonitor and I can see that information.\n\n424\n00:22:38.761 --> 00:22:43.054\nFor instance you can see down here, I've\ngot a counter that is basically showing me\n\n425\n00:22:43.054 --> 00:22:46.571\nwhat is the percent of the processor\ntime that I'm using right now.\n\n426\n00:22:46.571 --> 00:22:52.083\nAnd I could add more to this, depending on\nhow I wanted to create a series of tests.\n\n427\n00:22:52.083 --> 00:22:55.048\nAnd you can do what's known\nas performance baselining,\n\n428\n00:22:55.048 --> 00:22:57.778\nwhich we will show you coming\nup in another episode.\n\n429\n00:22:57.778 --> 00:23:01.698\nThe other one is resource monitor and\nresource monitor is very,\n\n430\n00:23:01.698 --> 00:23:03.011\nvery handy utility.\n\n431\n00:23:03.011 --> 00:23:05.291\nIf you've got a process that's going on,\n\n432\n00:23:05.291 --> 00:23:08.648\nif you've got an application\nthat's currently being used and\n\n433\n00:23:08.648 --> 00:23:12.145\nyou wanna find out how much memory,\nhow much hard drive, space?\n\n434\n00:23:12.145 --> 00:23:15.150\nHow much CPU and\nnetwork communication is it using?\n\n435\n00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:20.028\nYou can come in here and find it in the\nlist and turn around and put a check mark\n\n436\n00:23:20.028 --> 00:23:24.694\nin here and next to that whatever\nthat process or application might be.\n\n437\n00:23:24.694 --> 00:23:27.496\nAnd you can find out what\nit is currently using.\n\n438\n00:23:27.496 --> 00:23:31.300\nSo, it does not look like it's using\nmuch of the disk activity right now.\n\n439\n00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:35.921\nLet's see is it using network, so we can\nsee that this isn't really using too much.\n\n440\n00:23:35.921 --> 00:23:37.940\nProbably not a good example.\n\n441\n00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.209\nLet's find, performance monitor.\n\n442\n00:23:40.209 --> 00:23:45.533\nLet's see how resource monitor,\nmonitors Performance monitor boy that's.\n\n443\n00:23:45.533 --> 00:23:47.639\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's redundant there.\n\n444\n00:23:47.639 --> 00:23:48.535\n&gt;&gt; I'm confused.\n&gt;&gt; And you can see.\n\n445\n00:23:48.535 --> 00:23:49.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n446\n00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:53.991\nSo, we're basically using resource\nmonitor to monitor the resources that\n\n447\n00:23:53.991 --> 00:23:58.409\nanother application is currently using,\nand the moment I put a check mark in here,\n\n448\n00:23:58.409 --> 00:24:00.426\nit filters that down and it says okay,\n\n449\n00:24:00.426 --> 00:24:04.200\nthis is what's currently being\nused by that application.\n\n450\n00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:08.843\nRather than, for instance, if I was to\ndo something like open Task Manager, and\n\n451\n00:24:08.843 --> 00:24:12.807\nwhen I open Task Manager,\nsure I can see performance information but\n\n452\n00:24:12.807 --> 00:24:15.540\nI don't get the individual\nspecifics of well,\n\n453\n00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:19.468\nwhat If it is performance monitor\nusing it, how much is it using it?\n\n454\n00:24:19.468 --> 00:24:23.625\nI just get an overall totality of\nwhat's being used by the entire system,\n\n455\n00:24:23.625 --> 00:24:27.192\nall applications,\nincluding users logged in on the machine.\n\n456\n00:24:27.192 --> 00:24:32.474\nAll right, so that's resource monitor and\nthat really gonna take us through all\n\n457\n00:24:32.474 --> 00:24:37.987\nof our administering tools and we do have\nsome additional things to going, but I'll\n\n458\n00:24:37.987 --> 00:24:43.132\nleave Dan to decide whether we're gonna\ndo that and this one maybe part three?\n\n459\n00:24:43.132 --> 00:24:46.442\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what the heck, we like\ntrilogies around here there always fun,\n\n460\n00:24:46.442 --> 00:24:48.441\nLord of The Rings, Starwars you named it.\n\n461\n00:24:48.441 --> 00:24:49.558\nThe best things always come in threes.\n\n462\n00:24:49.558 --> 00:24:51.141\nSo, we'll save that for part three.\n\n463\n00:24:51.141 --> 00:24:55.796\nWes, thanks so much for dropping by and\nexplaining these system utilities that we\n\n464\n00:24:55.796 --> 00:24:59.910\nhave built in another set of great\ntools that allow us to work better, and\n\n465\n00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:02.891\nmake sure our computers\nare working as they should.\n\n466\n00:25:02.891 --> 00:25:03.808\nVery, very nice stuff.\n\n467\n00:25:03.808 --> 00:25:06.394\nAnd Wes, you did a great job\nof explaining it for us, so\n\n468\n00:25:06.394 --> 00:25:09.051\nthat we can understand it too and\nmaybe even pass a test.\n\n469\n00:25:09.051 --> 00:25:11.319\nThat being said,\nit is time to rest, to sign off so\n\n470\n00:25:11.319 --> 00:25:13.000\nit looks like that time for ITProTV.\n\n471\n00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.904\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n472\n00:25:14.904 --> 00:25:16.180\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Brian.\n\n473\n00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.285\n&gt;&gt; See you next time.\n\n474\n00:25:18.285 --> 00:25:24.330\n[MUSIC]\n\n475\n00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:27.562\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

and\n\n5\n00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:23.491\ntoday's episode we're back for more on\nour MTA series, good old 98-349 exam.\n\n6\n00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:24.720\nGoing into our part three,\n\n7\n00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.510\nthat's right our trilogy here\non the control panel options.\n\n8\n00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.510\nJoining us back for that action is\nour good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.200\nWes, welcome back Sir.\n\n10\n00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.886\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me here.\n\n11\n00:00:32.886 --> 00:00:34.502\nThat's right, yeah, I talk a lot.\n\n12\n00:00:34.502 --> 00:00:36.688\nBut, there are some things that\nwe really need to know, and\n\n13\n00:00:36.688 --> 00:00:38.370\nwe needed to know\nthe administrative tools.\n\n14\n00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.896\nThank goodness we got through that in\nthe first 2,000 episodes, or just kidding,\n\n15\n00:00:42.896 --> 00:00:44.190\nthe first two episodes.\n\n16\n00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.996\nKeep in mind that that's what we,\nwe looked over in the first two episodes,\n\n17\n00:00:47.996 --> 00:00:51.087\nreally was just the administrative tools,\nand that's one of\n\n18\n00:00:51.087 --> 00:00:55.146\nthe things that the MTA exam does call\nout, is the configuration of those tools.\n\n19\n00:00:55.146 --> 00:00:58.090\nNow what we're gonna talk about,\nis something a little bit different.\n\n20\n00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.017\nThis is gonna be more of a focus on,\nwell the first subject,\n\n21\n00:01:02.017 --> 00:01:06.417\nis gonna be more of a focus on helping\nto make the computer easier for\n\n22\n00:01:06.417 --> 00:01:09.420\npeople that maybe have\ndisabilities to use.\n\n23\n00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.528\nLet's go ahead and jump right in here.\n\n24\n00:01:12.528 --> 00:01:14.718\nWe're gonna talk about something\nknown as the Ease of Access center.\n\n25\n00:01:14.718 --> 00:01:16.160\nI'm gonna get back to my control panel.\n\n26\n00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.200\nWhat we're gonna do here, just gonna\nright-click on our Windows icon.\n\n27\n00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.510\nWe're gonna choose Control Panel.\n\n28\n00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.215\nAnd then you'll gonna see on\nthe left-hand column, or excuse me,\n\n29\n00:01:24.215 --> 00:01:26.945\nthe right-hand column all\nthe way at the bottom,\n\n30\n00:01:26.945 --> 00:01:30.130\nyou'll see this Ease of Access Center or\nEase of Access.\n\n31\n00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.902\nAnd this is one of the reasons you're\ngonna see that some people don't like\n\n32\n00:01:32.902 --> 00:01:33.440\nto category.\n\n33\n00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.586\nDo you remember I told you a link\nthat takes you to a link or\n\n34\n00:01:35.586 --> 00:01:36.738\ndoor that takes you to a door.\n\n35\n00:01:36.738 --> 00:01:39.714\nThen I'm gonna go ahead and\nchoose Ease of Access.\n\n36\n00:01:39.714 --> 00:01:43.250\nAnd apparently I'm going to\nchoose Ease of Access again.\n\n37\n00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.612\nSo, nothing like having two links\nto take you to the same spot.\n\n38\n00:01:46.612 --> 00:01:47.954\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's not redundant, redundant.\n\n39\n00:01:47.954 --> 00:01:49.362\n&gt;&gt; Not at all.\n\n40\n00:01:49.362 --> 00:01:51.883\nNow I will tell you that, and\nthis is the Ease of Access Center,\n\n41\n00:01:51.883 --> 00:01:53.940\nwe're gonna go through\nsome of the settings here.\n\n42\n00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.248\nCuz what they want you to know is\na little bit about how to configure\n\n43\n00:01:57.248 --> 00:01:58.760\nthe accessibility options.\n\n44\n00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.022\nAnd I will tell you that before we\nstarted, you'll see that there's this\n\n45\n00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:06.980\nAlways read this section aloud and\nAlways scan this section.\n\n46\n00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.882\nGuys, I went ahead and\nI turned that off just because it does\n\n47\n00:02:09.882 --> 00:02:12.901\nexactly what it sounds like and\nI didn't wanna open this up and\n\n48\n00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:15.590\nhave the narrator just start\nnarrating that section.\n\n49\n00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.426\nNow, I'll go ahead and just take this\nopportunity since we're talking about I'll\n\n50\n00:02:19.426 --> 00:02:21.400\ntell you a little bit about the narrator.\n\n51\n00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.820\nIf there is field within a web page or\n\n52\n00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.584\napplication that you have open that\nis compatible with the narrator,\n\n53\n00:02:28.584 --> 00:02:34.008\nit can read where your app and again like\nit says, it can read text on the screen.\n\n54\n00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:39.399\nSo if you maybe need that auto,\na reminder of where you're at or\n\n55\n00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:44.720\nthat dictation like that,\nyou can use the narrator.\n\n56\n00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.794\nYou can see that there a few things\nthat you can get to really quickly,\n\n57\n00:02:47.794 --> 00:02:48.810\nright here at the top.\n\n58\n00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.960\nYou can see the magnifier, and\nwe'll show you that here in a second.\n\n59\n00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.647\nStart the narrator,\nI went ahead and disabled it,\n\n60\n00:02:55.647 --> 00:02:58.648\ncuz we don't need it sitting\nhere narrating while we're\n\n61\n00:02:58.648 --> 00:03:03.352\ntrying to narrate these for you as well, I\ndon't want any competition, that's right.\n\n62\n00:03:03.352 --> 00:03:06.316\nSo the next thing that we have\nis setting up high contrast, and\n\n63\n00:03:06.316 --> 00:03:09.460\nagain, you're gonna see these\nsetting come up in a bit.\n\n64\n00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.052\nAnd then the on-screen keyboard,\nand I'll go ahead and\n\n65\n00:03:12.052 --> 00:03:15.186\nlaunch the on-screen keyboard and\nyou can see it does exactly that.\n\n66\n00:03:15.186 --> 00:03:19.988\nIt's kinda interesting, I've actually\nused the on-screen keyboard in a way\n\n67\n00:03:19.988 --> 00:03:24.649\nthat it probably wasn't originally\nsupposed to be used for but there's been\n\n68\n00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:29.450\ntimes where I lose the ability to use the\nkeyboard for one reason or another, and\n\n69\n00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.010\nI've fallen back on just go ahead and\nopening up the on-screen keyboard.\n\n70\n00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.022\nSo you can use that.\n\n71\n00:03:36.022 --> 00:03:39.459\nKeep in mind that if you do any of your,\nlike for instance,\n\n72\n00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.526\nif I hit the Windows key here,\nit brings up the start menu just like if I\n\n73\n00:03:43.526 --> 00:03:46.630\nuse the tactile Windows key\non the keyboard itself.\n\n74\n00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.930\nSo, you do have the ability\nto use that likewise.\n\n75\n00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.750\nNow, I do wanna kinda look at some\nof these other settings here.\n\n76\n00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.940\nYou can see,\nI always thought this was interesting,\n\n77\n00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.460\nUse the computer without a display.\n\n78\n00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.830\nAll right, so for instance,\nif we come into here.\n\n79\n00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.884\nAll right, you can see that it includes\nthe Narrator and the Audio Descriptions\n\n80\n00:04:07.884 --> 00:04:12.650\nthat I was talking about and the Turn\noff all necessary animations as well.\n\n81\n00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.628\nAll right, go ahead look at a couple of\nother ones these ones are ones that I\n\n82\n00:04:16.628 --> 00:04:20.671\nwould like to use here as well from time\nto time, Make the computer easier to\n\n83\n00:04:20.671 --> 00:04:24.635\nsee as you can see I've got four eyes,\nso I do need that from time to time.\n\n84\n00:04:24.635 --> 00:04:28.430\nWe'll go ahead and will take a look\nat that really briefly all right.\n\n85\n00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.690\nAnd remember that those four options\nthat it starts you out with.\n\n86\n00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.652\nEveryone of them can be configured to\nthis task links that we are showing you.\n\n87\n00:04:36.652 --> 00:04:40.566\nJust keep in mind that gives you\nthat kinda a quick heads up,\n\n88\n00:04:40.566 --> 00:04:43.010\nview of some of the basics features.\n\n89\n00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.126\nBut you can see i can do choose\na high contrasting here.\n\n90\n00:04:46.126 --> 00:04:50.688\nFor if you have a hard time\nmaybe with some color blindness,\n\n91\n00:04:50.688 --> 00:04:52.830\nyou can also use that.\n\n92\n00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.937\nAgain, you can say same thing before\nnarrator on Audio Description and\n\n93\n00:04:56.937 --> 00:04:59.552\nnotice that I can also\nturn on the magnifier.\n\n94\n00:04:59.552 --> 00:05:03.080\nAnd I can do things like change\nthe size of the text of the icons.\n\n95\n00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.596\nNow, I do want you to\nkeep in mind that I'm\n\n96\n00:05:06.596 --> 00:05:10.124\nusing a traditional control panel here.\n\n97\n00:05:10.124 --> 00:05:15.004\nAnd you can do that, but you'll notice\nthat when I click that little task\n\n98\n00:05:15.004 --> 00:05:18.206\nlink it takes me to\nthe newer systems location.\n\n99\n00:05:18.206 --> 00:05:23.230\nSo Microsoft does this, they've got an old\ninterface or a traditional interface.\n\n100\n00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.850\nThey've got a new interface.\n\n101\n00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.030\nThey definitely want you to be\nable to use this interface.\n\n102\n00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.430\nYou might ask, well, Wes, why aren't\nyou really showing us in this context?\n\n103\n00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.225\nWell, let me show you what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n104\n00:05:34.225 --> 00:05:38.429\nThere are all kinds of settings\nthat you can make here.\n\n105\n00:05:38.429 --> 00:05:42.641\nAnd you will sometimes see\nthat you will flip in and\n\n106\n00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:46.965\nout of the new interface\nback to the old interface.\n\n107\n00:05:46.965 --> 00:05:50.708\nSo for instance,\nwhen it said adjust the text size.\n\n108\n00:05:50.708 --> 00:05:52.380\nIt took me to the new interface.\n\n109\n00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.590\nNow what happens,\nwatch what happens when I click this link.\n\n110\n00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.290\nAdvanced sizing of text and other items.\n\n111\n00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.408\nIt takes me right back\nto the old interface.\n\n112\n00:06:00.408 --> 00:06:04.267\nSo that's, I just wanted to kinda let you\nguys know that's why I'm in the older\n\n113\n00:06:04.267 --> 00:06:05.735\ninterface here too.\n\n114\n00:06:05.735 --> 00:06:09.138\nI would get used to using both as\nyou are getting ready for exam and\n\n115\n00:06:09.138 --> 00:06:11.661\nyou're gonna see more on\nthis action center and\n\n116\n00:06:11.661 --> 00:06:16.035\nthe newer settings location cuz we're\ngonna be using it throughout this series.\n\n117\n00:06:16.035 --> 00:06:20.055\nBut just a heads-up on that guys,\nso that you are aware of it.\n\n118\n00:06:20.055 --> 00:06:22.794\nNow what this does is it sets things,\nfor instance,\n\n119\n00:06:22.794 --> 00:06:26.670\nyou can set custom scaling, for\ninstance, to this task link right here.\n\n120\n00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.963\nThis is all based on that one little task\nlink that we clicked back in the Ease of\n\n121\n00:06:30.963 --> 00:06:31.900\nAccess Center.\n\n122\n00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.200\nAnd I'm not gonna modify these,\nbut I could change the scaling.\n\n123\n00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.645\nAnd I could bring this up to make the text\nbe a little bit larger on the screen.\n\n124\n00:06:40.645 --> 00:06:44.425\nHowever, keep in mind that this is\nsomething that stays in the user profile\n\n125\n00:06:44.425 --> 00:06:47.485\nand it configures it, so\nyou have to log off and log back on for\n\n126\n00:06:47.485 --> 00:06:49.055\nthese changes to take effect.\n\n127\n00:06:49.055 --> 00:06:52.188\nSo if you change it and\nit doesn't look like it does anything,\n\n128\n00:06:52.188 --> 00:06:55.639\nthat's because you've probably\nforgot to log out of the machine.\n\n129\n00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.670\nNow the other thing that we can do in the\nEase of Access Center, let me go ahead and\n\n130\n00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.004\njust navigate back here.\n\n131\n00:07:02.004 --> 00:07:04.540\nAll right,\nthere are other things that we can do.\n\n132\n00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.040\nFor instance your input devices,\nmouse and keyboard, right?\n\n133\n00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.500\nWe can setup making the mouse\neasier to use, for instance.\n\n134\n00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.380\nRight, you could change the size of\nthe pointer, right, again for visual.\n\n135\n00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.310\nWe could turn on things\nlike the mouse keys.\n\n136\n00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:24.499\nYou can see, use the numeric keypad\nto move the mouse around the screen,\n\n137\n00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:26.780\nif you so choose to do that, all right?\n\n138\n00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.356\nYou can also do things like activating\na windows by hovering over it with\n\n139\n00:07:30.356 --> 00:07:31.020\nyour mouse.\n\n140\n00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:36.056\nSo you can see you can modify how you\ninteract with the operating system, and\n\n141\n00:07:36.056 --> 00:07:41.170\nit can make it a little bit easier,\nif you have again, things like rheumatoid\n\n142\n00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:46.051\narthritis, or something wrong with\nyour hands in the aspect that it makes\n\n143\n00:07:46.051 --> 00:07:50.960\nit harder to use that mouse, hopefully\nthat can simplify it a little bit.\n\n144\n00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.586\nNow, I do wanna make mention\nof something though,\n\n145\n00:07:53.586 --> 00:07:56.282\nbecause there are some other\nthings that you can do.\n\n146\n00:07:56.282 --> 00:08:01.183\nWhen they say, they talk about configuring\naccessibility options, I'm pretty\n\n147\n00:08:01.183 --> 00:08:05.870\nsure that what they're gonna want you to\nknow if right in here, is just what can\n\n148\n00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:10.580\nyou do to make The machine a little bit\neasier to use through the Ease of Access.\n\n149\n00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.550\nHowever, keep in mind that you\ncan get creative with this,\n\n150\n00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.520\nyou don't have to stay right here.\n\n151\n00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.750\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n152\n00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:20.180\nIf I right click on the Windows icon.\n\n153\n00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:24.000\nAnd file explorer is not what\nI wanted to launch up and\n\n154\n00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.350\nI launch Control Panel again.\n\n155\n00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:28.010\nAnd I'm doing this, I know I got a lot\nof Control Panel Windows open in\n\n156\n00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.870\nthe background, but I want you to know\nhow to navigate to these locations,\n\n157\n00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.010\nthat's why I keep opening them.\n\n158\n00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:35.220\nIt's probably going to be something you're\ngoing to need to know for the exam.\n\n159\n00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.770\nIf I go to Hardware and\nSound and then I go to Mouse.\n\n160\n00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.990\nAgain there are other things\nthat you can do to get creative.\n\n161\n00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:45.010\nLike for instance,\nI can change the Pointer here too.\n\n162\n00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:47.590\nI can change the Pointer Options for\ninstance,\n\n163\n00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:51.110\nif you want the pointer to\nmove a little bit faster.\n\n164\n00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:54.370\nWhen you increase the speed on it,\nas you move the mouse around,\n\n165\n00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.130\nit goes farther quicker.\n\n166\n00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:57.740\nIt can make it a little bit easier too.\n\n167\n00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.700\nI also have, for instance, showing\nthe location of the pointer when I press\n\n168\n00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:06.850\nthe Ctrl key for somebody who\nmaybe their site isn't too good.\n\n169\n00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:10.770\nYou press the Ctrl key you can\nfind out where that cursor is.\n\n170\n00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:14.610\nPersonally, I use that in a training\nenvironment like you can see here.\n\n171\n00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.710\nBut you can also use it as\nan accessibility option,\n\n172\n00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.590\nif somebody can't see too well.\n\n173\n00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:24.490\nSo, configuring your accessibility\noptions, pretty straightforward,\n\n174\n00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:27.940\njust remember how to get there,\nremember it's the Ease of Access Center.\n\n175\n00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.540\nSo we go to Ease of Access\n&gt; Ease of Access Center and\n\n176\n00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:35.390\nthere are a ton of different\nsettings that you can manipulate,\n\n177\n00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:40.150\nmodified to make somebody's life a little\nbit easier when they're on their machine.\n\n178\n00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:40.690\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n179\n00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:41.890\nWell that's good to know, right.\n\n180\n00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:45.770\nThat the good people Microsoft didn't\nleave everybody out in the woods.\n\n181\n00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:49.411\nAnd if guess some sort of some\nsort of ability that's not up to,\n\n182\n00:09:49.411 --> 00:09:51.980\nmaybe some other persons\nthey thought about that.\n\n183\n00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.960\nAnd they thought about hey,\nsome people don't see that well.\n\n184\n00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.760\nSome people don't hear that well.\n\n185\n00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.680\nLet's do what we can do make\nit more accessible for them.\n\n186\n00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.380\nSo we like the accessibility options,\n\n187\n00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:02.990\nbrings everybody to the table\nthey can all use a computer.\n\n188\n00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:05.860\nAnd now that being said, Wes, you talk\nabout, well I don't know, I don't if I\n\n189\n00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:08.710\nremember if it was this show or another\none, where you talk about Power Options.\n\n190\n00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:12.580\nI know that's somewhere we need to get\nwhen it comes to this specific episode.\n\n191\n00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:13.390\n&gt;&gt; It definitely is.\n\n192\n00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:15.700\nAnd that's another thing that\nthey call out in the objectives.\n\n193\n00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.250\nYou might say well wait a second, we're\ntalking about Administrative Tools and\n\n194\n00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.550\nthen we go right into Power Options?\n\n195\n00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:24.340\nWell, keep in mind, like I said when\nwe first started this episode way back,\n\n196\n00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:29.300\nway back years ago in part one\n[LAUGH] that just because they\n\n197\n00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:33.140\ncall it an Administrative Tool under\nAdministrative Tools doesn't negate\n\n198\n00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:38.900\nthe fact that other utilities are gonna be\nused on a daily basis or on a commonality.\n\n199\n00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.620\nAnd Power Option is\ndefinitely one of them.\n\n200\n00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:45.370\nSo let's go ahead, one of the things they\ncall out is configure power settings.\n\n201\n00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:47.620\nWe're gonna go back to our\nControl Panel home and\n\n202\n00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.890\nI want you to know that it's easy,\nreal easy to get to just System and\n\n203\n00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:54.550\nSecurity, from System and\nSecurity you have Power Options here and\n\n204\n00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:56.990\nyou can see that's what fourth\ndown from the top there?\n\n205\n00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.140\nAnd here are Power Options.\n\n206\n00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.940\nNow, what is a Power Option for us?\n\n207\n00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.130\nWhat are Power Options?\n\n208\n00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:06.630\nWell, Power Options\nallow you to basically,\n\n209\n00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:08.640\nit's a collection of hardware and\n\n210\n00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:13.400\nsystem settings that essentially define\nhow the power's consumed by the device.\n\n211\n00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.860\nNow, if you have a desktop device or\na laptop that's plugged into the wall,\n\n212\n00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.220\nthen maybe you don't care so\nmuch for the power settings.\n\n213\n00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.280\nBut if you've got a mobile device,\n\n214\n00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:25.260\nif you've got a laptop that you're on\nthe road with an Ultrabook, then you're\n\n215\n00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.300\ndefinitely gonna wanna know a little\nbit more about these power settings.\n\n216\n00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.230\nAnd more specifically,\nsomething known as a power plan.\n\n217\n00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.770\nAll right, a power plan, again,\nis that collection of hardware and\n\n218\n00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:39.080\nsystem settings that define,\nhow the computer is going to use power.\n\n219\n00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.000\nAnd it's based on two things.\n\n220\n00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.640\nTypically it's based on\nyour computer's performance\n\n221\n00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.890\nversus how well does it save power.\n\n222\n00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:50.130\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at these power plans here.\n\n223\n00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.730\nAnd we've got three of them, all right.\n\n224\n00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:57.230\nThe very first one is called Balanced\nrecommended, Power saver and\n\n225\n00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:58.120\nHigh performance.\n\n226\n00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.830\nWell, what are these power plans,\nall right.\n\n227\n00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:03.900\nWell the first one, Balanced,\nI want you to see what it says here.\n\n228\n00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:08.010\nNotice it says, Automatically balances\nperformance with energy consumption on\n\n229\n00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:10.000\ncapable hardware, all right.\n\n230\n00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:12.740\nPut this another way for you.\n\n231\n00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:17.200\nBalanced is the power plan that\ntries to save you power where it can\n\n232\n00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.500\nwithout hindering your performance,\nunderstand that.\n\n233\n00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.080\nThat's why it's balanced.\n\n234\n00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:26.380\nBalance is the performance\nwith power savings.\n\n235\n00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:31.150\nNow, how does that differ from power\nsaving or our Power saver plan.\n\n236\n00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:34.860\nThe Power saver plan says, we're going to\ndo everything we can to save your power.\n\n237\n00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.950\nWe're even gonna throttle\nyour CPU a little bit.\n\n238\n00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:40.570\nWe're gonna tone down how much\nyou're using the hard drive, right.\n\n239\n00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:46.340\nSo this says, save power at the risk\nof lowering your performance, right.\n\n240\n00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:47.430\nThat means hey,\n\n241\n00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:51.280\nif I go into this power plan, I don't\nhave much battery life left, right.\n\n242\n00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.190\nSo that's why it's really,\nreally important and\n\n243\n00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:55.980\nvery handy when it comes\nto your mobile devices.\n\n244\n00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:59.430\nNow, the last one says\nwe're not saving any power.\n\n245\n00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:02.330\nWe don't care about power,\nin fact use more of it.\n\n246\n00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:07.250\nHigh performance just says hey, let's run\neverything to its full potential there.\n\n247\n00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:10.520\nAnd again, we're not really gonna\ntone anything down if you will.\n\n248\n00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.430\nWe're not gonna throttle anything and\nsave you any power on there.\n\n249\n00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:14.670\nSo forget being green.\n\n250\n00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:15.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n251\n00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:16.810\n&gt;&gt; We're not gonna hug any trees here.\n\n252\n00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:19.540\nSo be careful with this\none if you have a laptop.\n\n253\n00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:23.750\nIf you set it, be careful with this\none because if you don't change it,\n\n254\n00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:26.850\nyou're gonna chew through some\nbattery life pretty quick.\n\n255\n00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:29.340\nNow, that's the traditional Power Options.\n\n256\n00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.130\nLet me show you what you get\nwith the newer Action Center.\n\n257\n00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:33.610\nNow my head's kinda covering this one up,\n\n258\n00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:37.690\nbut if I go down here you can\nsee this little message icon.\n\n259\n00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:40.050\nYou can see it's\na notification icon there.\n\n260\n00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:44.260\nIf I click that,\nthat launches our new Action Center.\n\n261\n00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.770\nAnd if I go into All Settings\n\n262\n00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.390\nthis brings up the newer menu\nthat I was talking about.\n\n263\n00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.190\nAnd we're gonna go to System.\n\n264\n00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:55.645\nFrom System if I scroll down just\na little bit you'll see Power &amp; Sleep.\n\n265\n00:13:55.645 --> 00:13:57.454\nNow it's very basic here.\n\n266\n00:13:57.454 --> 00:14:01.170\nAnd if I choose Power &amp; Sleep,\nnotice what it gives me the ability to do.\n\n267\n00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:04.630\nIt gives me the ability it says\nthe screen, When plugged in,\n\n268\n00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:07.200\nturn off after and\nhow many minutes I want.\n\n269\n00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.160\nAnd I can even say down\nhere at the bottom.\n\n270\n00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.490\nLet me see if I can make it a little\neasier for you guys to see.\n\n271\n00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:15.360\nIf I scroll down at the bottom,\nI could also say Never.\n\n272\n00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.490\nNotice it also says,\nI can put this computer to Sleep.\n\n273\n00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:22.840\nIt says When plugged in,\nPC goes to sleep after such and such time.\n\n274\n00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:26.250\nNow, how does a sleep\nmode affect your power?\n\n275\n00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:28.710\nWell what sleep does, is it keeps\n\n276\n00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:32.420\na little bit of current on your random\naccess memory, your system memory so\n\n277\n00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:36.300\neverything, applications and data that's\nstored in RAM is going to be fine.\n\n278\n00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:40.890\nHowever, everything else that can be\nshut off is going to be shut off.\n\n279\n00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:44.500\nBut notice, there's not really\nmuch that you can do there, right.\n\n280\n00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.100\nSo they have some\nadditional power settings.\n\n281\n00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.470\nWatch what happens when I click this link.\n\n282\n00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:51.010\nI choose additional power settings, and\n\n283\n00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:55.220\njust like before it takes me to\nthe same Power Options we were just at.\n\n284\n00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:58.150\nSo you can see that you're kinda\nusing both interfaces here.\n\n285\n00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:02.100\nThat's one of the reasons I\nwanted to mention it here.\n\n286\n00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.860\nThat you can do this here as well.\n\n287\n00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:04.650\nSo, for instance,\n\n288\n00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:08.450\nif I want you can see that there's\nsome basic task links over here.\n\n289\n00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:09.930\nChoose what the power button does.\n\n290\n00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:11.315\nCreate a power plan.\n\n291\n00:15:11.315 --> 00:15:13.845\nWe could choose when to\nturn the display off.\n\n292\n00:15:13.845 --> 00:15:15.545\nAnd change when the computer sleeps.\n\n293\n00:15:15.545 --> 00:15:20.325\nSo, there again, you can see we\ncan do those same things here.\n\n294\n00:15:20.325 --> 00:15:24.665\nNow, I can also get a little bit more\nspecific in a power plan if I want.\n\n295\n00:15:24.665 --> 00:15:29.405\nIf I have any one that I'm gonna choose\nhere, for instance Balance recommended.\n\n296\n00:15:29.405 --> 00:15:34.490\nIf I decide that,\nI wanna change the defaults.\n\n297\n00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:38.920\nWell, I could go over here and choose\nChange plan settings little task link.\n\n298\n00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.960\nNow, doesn't look like I can change much,\nright.\n\n299\n00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.210\nNotice, it's the same thing\nthat's in the new interface.\n\n300\n00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:45.200\nTurn the display off.\n\n301\n00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.490\nPut the computer to sleep, right.\n\n302\n00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:48.420\nSo, it's no different.\n\n303\n00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:52.990\nBut notice that I want to change oop,\nand in fact, let me back out of that.\n\n304\n00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:55.380\nIt kind of disappeared on me there.\n\n305\n00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:58.243\nOne second guys, let's go ahead and\nopen that back up.\n\n306\n00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:03.559\nAll right, so if I want to go ahead.\n\n307\n00:16:03.559 --> 00:16:05.042\nThere we go, back where we were.\n\n308\n00:16:05.042 --> 00:16:09.367\nIf I wanna go ahead and I wanna a little\nbit more granular control over,\n\n309\n00:16:09.367 --> 00:16:13.180\nI could choose the change\nadvanced power settings.\n\n310\n00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:16.330\nAnd this is the dialogue box that\nI wanted you guys to see here.\n\n311\n00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:20.760\nNotice that we have advanced settings,\nbasically says, I can go in and\n\n312\n00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:24.220\nI can define individually, these settings.\n\n313\n00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.584\nLike for instance, wireless adapter\nsettings, it says balanced,\n\n314\n00:16:27.584 --> 00:16:31.420\nit says maximum performance, but if I\nwanted to, I could say, you know what?\n\n315\n00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:34.770\nGive me a little bit more power\nsaving on my network adapter.\n\n316\n00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:36.960\nThat might be what you want,\nit might not be.\n\n317\n00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.790\nBut notice that you can\nget granular on this.\n\n318\n00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:41.840\nI can define what those settings are.\n\n319\n00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.230\nThe other thing I wanna show you too,\n\n320\n00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.770\nis that maybe you want to\ndefine your own power plan.\n\n321\n00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:50.320\nAnd that's what Windows allows you to do,\nit allows you to create a power plan here\n\n322\n00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.510\nand if I want,\nI can choose this little link, there.\n\n323\n00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:58.680\nAnd it's going to use one of the three\nexisting power plans as a template, right?\n\n324\n00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:02.990\nSo I can say balance my custom plan,\nI could do something, I don't know.\n\n325\n00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:08.002\nOne that I do a lot is StayAwakeOn\n&gt;&gt; Stay away.\n\n326\n00:17:08.002 --> 00:17:08.790\n&gt;&gt; Close.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n327\n00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:09.630\n&gt;&gt; Stay away,\n\n328\n00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:11.060\nyeah Dan get away from me man.\n\n329\n00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:12.215\n[LAUGH] Let's try that again.\n\n330\n00:17:12.215 --> 00:17:16.830\nStayAwake, if I can spell it and it does\nhelp to be able to spell these right.\n\n331\n00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:21.335\nI mean it is for you to recognize but\nyou might not want to stay away.\n\n332\n00:17:21.335 --> 00:17:25.909\n[LAUGH] All right, so StayAwakeOnClose I\nwanted to do something like this,\n\n333\n00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:27.226\nI could choose Next.\n\n334\n00:17:27.226 --> 00:17:30.860\nAnd it gives me the basic settings first,\nand I can choose create.\n\n335\n00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:34.970\nNow, notice that my plan is here,\nI haven't really done anything to it,\n\n336\n00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.480\nit's just like having\na second balanced power plan.\n\n337\n00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.450\nBut if I wanted to I could\nchange the settings, and\n\n338\n00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:43.280\nagain I could get a little\nbit more granular.\n\n339\n00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:48.210\nI can say advanced settings here,\nall right, and for instance I could\n\n340\n00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:52.050\ngo down to the power button and\nI could say, power button action, right?\n\n341\n00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:55.380\nPower button, usually it's shut down,\nbut I could change that,\n\n342\n00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.440\nI could say, you know what?\n\n343\n00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.710\nWhen I push the power button\njust turn off the display or\n\n344\n00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:01.980\njust send it to sleep, right?\n\n345\n00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.430\nSo you have that option as well.\n\n346\n00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:08.090\nYou can get very granular including\ncreating your own power plans.\n\n347\n00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:10.810\nNow, one of the last things I'll mention\nwith configuring power settings that I\n\n348\n00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:12.340\nwant you to be aware of the MTA.\n\n349\n00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:16.080\nI don't really think that they're\ngonna ask you in depth other than to\n\n350\n00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.115\nunderstand that you can also do this from\nthe command prompt, is the fact that if I\n\n351\n00:18:20.115 --> 00:18:24.730\nright-click and I choose PowerShell or\ncommand prompt it works in both.\n\n352\n00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:30.890\nI can choose to use a command\ncalled powercfg, short for\n\n353\n00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:34.860\npower configuration, and I want you\nto be aware of that for the exam.\n\n354\n00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:35.710\nSo, for instance,\n\n355\n00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:40.320\nI could do a list if I wanted to and\nI could see all the power plans.\n\n356\n00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:44.340\nNow they're called power schemes\nin the command prompt, same thing.\n\n357\n00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:48.490\nBut I can see that StayAwakeOnClose,\nand if I decide that, you know what?\n\n358\n00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:49.800\nI want the power saver, right?\n\n359\n00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:54.480\nIf I was in the command prompt here I\ncould copy this crazy long string, and\n\n360\n00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.480\nI could do something like this.\n\n361\n00:18:55.480 --> 00:19:00.252\nI could do powercfg/setactive, and\n\n362\n00:19:00.252 --> 00:19:04.720\nI could turn around and\npaste that long GUID in there.\n\n363\n00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.773\nGo ahead and do that real quick.\n\n364\n00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.355\nIt's not letting me copy.\n\n365\n00:19:11.355 --> 00:19:15.420\nIt should, there we go.\n\n366\n00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.300\nAnd I run that and wow,\ndidn't that look amazing, right?\n\n367\n00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:23.110\nWe don't get all the flare here in\nthe CLI, but if I turned around and\n\n368\n00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:27.480\nI redo this list, see the little asterisk\nsymbol went from StayAwakeOnClose,\n\n369\n00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.530\nthe one that we just created,\nto the power saver.\n\n370\n00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:35.500\nThe point is remember powercfg allows you\nto also configure the power settings.\n\n371\n00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.400\nSo, Dan that's a little bit about the\npower settings that we've talked about.\n\n372\n00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.880\nLike I said guys I threw the powercfg\njust in case you might get some kind of\n\n373\n00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:46.510\nquestion that says, which of these allows\nyou to modify your power settings?\n\n374\n00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:49.240\nYou'll know that control\npanel is one of them and\n\n375\n00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:52.140\npowercfg would be the one that you'd\nuse inside of the command prompt.\n\n376\n00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.500\n&gt;&gt; Excellent, and like Wes said,\nmake sure you spell it correctly.\n\n377\n00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.240\nCuz if you're trying to script anything,\nwell if you misspelled it,\n\n378\n00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.175\nit's not gonna work very well.\n\n379\n00:19:58.175 --> 00:20:00.790\n[LAUGH] Always a good sign,\ncheck your spelling.\n\n380\n00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:02.860\nIt's a very important safety tip for\nyou guys out there.\n\n381\n00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.980\nWes, we've got a little bit of time left,\ndo we have anything else that we want\n\n382\n00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.190\nto walk through before\nwe close the show today?\n\n383\n00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:10.100\n&gt;&gt; We do, we have one that's\nbeen kind of updated, and\n\n384\n00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:11.720\nthis has actually been in Windows for\na long time.\n\n385\n00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.750\nIt's gone through different names,\ntoday it's called File Explorer,\n\n386\n00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:17.190\nyou guys might know it out\nthere as Windows Explorer.\n\n387\n00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:20.800\nNow if we're outside of a certification\nendeavor and you were talking to me about\n\n388\n00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.190\nWindows Explorer,\nI wouldn't sit there and correct you.\n\n389\n00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:25.510\nBe like, yeah, yeah, Windows Explorer,\nI know what you're talking about.\n\n390\n00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:29.310\nJust understand today that it's got\na new name, it's called File Explorer.\n\n391\n00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:32.447\nSo for some of you that have been\naround the Windows operating system for\n\n392\n00:20:32.447 --> 00:20:35.330\na while, if you know it as\nWindows Explorer, that's just fine.\n\n393\n00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.050\nNow how do we get to File Explorer?\n\n394\n00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:38.070\nAnd what is it?\n\n395\n00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.890\nWell, let's go ahead and\nwe'll do both at the same time.\n\n396\n00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:44.930\nLittle folder icon on your desktop,\nit will take you to File Explorer and\n\n397\n00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:47.940\nyou can just click on that and\nlaunch it up.\n\n398\n00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.280\nHopefully you can launch it up,\nWes will just sit here and\n\n399\n00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.440\nminimize it a couple of times.\n\n400\n00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:55.840\nNow, once you've got that loaded up,\nthis is your file and\n\n401\n00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.220\nfolder management utility.\n\n402\n00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:02.020\nThis is your main graphical user\ninterface way to view files and folders\n\n403\n00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:06.750\non your machine, including things like\nremovable media and even optical drives.\n\n404\n00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:11.340\nIt has a newer look,\na newer look than it has in the past.\n\n405\n00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.560\nAnd what they decided to do is\nthat they were gonna include\n\n406\n00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:18.080\nsomething known as the ribbon\nhere inside of File Explorer.\n\n407\n00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:22.650\nNow if you're used to the Office suite you\nprobably already seen this ribbon before,\n\n408\n00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:24.020\nmaybe even used it.\n\n409\n00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:28.586\nIt is contextually sensitive cuz notice\nhow I've got a couple of things that I can\n\n410\n00:21:28.586 --> 00:21:32.628\ndo over here but everything, for\nthe most part, is really grayed out.\n\n411\n00:21:32.628 --> 00:21:37.040\nHowever if I select something, notice that\nthese other areas start to highlight.\n\n412\n00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.495\nIt's all based on what you're selecting,\nall right?\n\n413\n00:21:39.495 --> 00:21:45.240\nWe'll define what you can actually\ndo inside of that ribbon.\n\n414\n00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:48.280\nOn the left hand side,\nyou have the console tree.\n\n415\n00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:53.250\nIn earlier, going way back, in earlier\neditions of Windows, we might have\n\n416\n00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:56.490\ncalled this the folder hierarchy,\nit's a little bit different today.\n\n417\n00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:59.470\nIt's still a hierarchical tree,\nhowever, they do have things like\n\n418\n00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:02.230\nQuick access which is new and\nwe'll show that here in a second.\n\n419\n00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:05.100\nThey also have things like Library,\nso it has changed a little bit\n\n420\n00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:08.460\nfrom the earlier days when\nWindows Explorer was first launched.\n\n421\n00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:09.620\nFor instance, right?\n\n422\n00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:14.570\nI can see this PC and I can see the hard\ndrives that are currently in the machine\n\n423\n00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:16.740\nincluding some of the shared\nresources as well.\n\n424\n00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.580\nAnd like I mentioned the Optical drive,\n\n425\n00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:21.370\nI can see that our installation\nmedia is there too.\n\n426\n00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:24.990\nSo I can manage and\nmaintain those all from a single location.\n\n427\n00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:31.980\nI also mentioned this Quick access,\nQuick access is something that is new.\n\n428\n00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:37.990\nAnd that is over here at the highest part\nof the hierarchy here in our consult tree.\n\n429\n00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:41.330\nNow, notice that I've got\nthese pins here next to me or\n\n430\n00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:46.030\nnext to these locations,\nQuick access is for exactly that.\n\n431\n00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:49.440\nIf you've got a place that you go\ncommonly and you want one click access,\n\n432\n00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:52.520\nwell, one click after you click\nthe folder, two click access,\n\n433\n00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.830\nthen you can pin it to the Quick access\nlocation and get there a little quicker.\n\n434\n00:22:55.830 --> 00:23:00.730\nSo for instance, if I had in my Documents,\ntake a folder that's already there and\n\n435\n00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:01.450\nlets, there we go.\n\n436\n00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:03.980\nIf I right click on a folder\nthat's in my Documents,\n\n437\n00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:07.820\nnotice that I have the option to pin\nthis to the quick access, right?\n\n438\n00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:12.110\nWhen I pin that to Quick access, if you\nnotice over here I now have that folder,\n\n439\n00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:14.770\nthat location, right there at the top and\nI can get to it.\n\n440\n00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:16.120\nWhat if I decide, Wes, that's silly.\n\n441\n00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.680\nWhy would you want BGInfo at the top and\nnot Documents?\n\n442\n00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:22.802\nWell, I've already got Documents, so maybe\nI don't want BGInfo, I made a mistake.\n\n443\n00:23:22.802 --> 00:23:28.933\nWell, I can always go in here, and I can\nright-click on Quick access, all right?\n\n444\n00:23:28.933 --> 00:23:30.409\nAnd I can choose Options.\n\n445\n00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:35.580\nAnd you can modify the look and\nthe feel of Quick access.\n\n446\n00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:39.390\nYou can actually remove and\nyou can restore defaults here too.\n\n447\n00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:41.930\nOne of the things you can do,\n\n448\n00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:46.960\nis you can just right click on it and\nunpin it from Quick access as well.\n\n449\n00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:51.680\nNow I will say something to be\ncareful about the Quick access,\n\n450\n00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:58.070\nyou'll notice that with our new File\nExplorer, we also have a newer location.\n\n451\n00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:01.179\nAnd notice it says Recent files?\n\n452\n00:24:01.179 --> 00:24:04.189\nI don't have any files here, I haven't\nreally opened anything on this machine.\n\n453\n00:24:04.189 --> 00:24:05.691\nLet's see here.\n\n454\n00:24:05.691 --> 00:24:09.330\nThere's our end user licence agreement for\nBGInfo.\n\n455\n00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:12.484\nAll right, let me go ahead and\nget back out to the main.\n\n456\n00:24:12.484 --> 00:24:15.721\nThere we go, and\nI clicked a little too fast, there.\n\n457\n00:24:15.721 --> 00:24:18.000\nNotice how it says recent files there?\n\n458\n00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000\nNow for privacy reasons, maybe you\ndon't want this, that's up to you.\n\n459\n00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.770\nIt does give you a way to\nget back to it really quick.\n\n460\n00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:28.602\nHence, quick access term.\n\n461\n00:24:28.602 --> 00:24:34.180\nBut you can modify the way file\nexplorer shows you different things.\n\n462\n00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:35.901\nNow there's a couple different\nways you could do this.\n\n463\n00:24:35.901 --> 00:24:38.534\nYou can go first of all to the view tab.\n\n464\n00:24:38.534 --> 00:24:41.030\nAll right,\nif you're working in the ribbon.\n\n465\n00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:45.775\nAll right, and we can do things like for\ninsane I could see the preview pane.\n\n466\n00:24:45.775 --> 00:24:49.504\nSo, for instance, if I select this file,\nnotice that the preview pane shows me\n\n467\n00:24:49.504 --> 00:24:52.560\nthe context of that file\nright there in file explorer.\n\n468\n00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:58.880\nI can also use the details pane if I want\nor not, I can keep that off of there.\n\n469\n00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.600\nI can also go to seeing file extensions,\n\n470\n00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:07.000\ntypically these file extensions, these\nthree and four layer extensions are hidden\n\n471\n00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.020\nby default because the average end\nuser doesn't need to see them.\n\n472\n00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:14.630\nHowever, if we wanna see them, we can,\nand we could choose filename extensions.\n\n473\n00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:18.160\nAnd now you see my end user license\nagreement, does have that there.\n\n474\n00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:22.870\nBut more importantly,\nI wanna show you folder options.\n\n475\n00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:26.480\nAnd that is now available\nthrough the ribbon.\n\n476\n00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.548\nIt used to be,\nyou could go into control panel,\n\n477\n00:25:28.548 --> 00:25:31.880\nI'll show you where it is in the control\npanel as we wrap this up, all right?\n\n478\n00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.740\nBut notice that in the general option,\nright?\n\n479\n00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:36.020\nNotice privacy here?\n\n480\n00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:37.370\nThis could be a privacy concern.\n\n481\n00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:41.650\nYou could clear the recent files,\nand you'll notice over here\n\n482\n00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:45.680\nin the right-hand side that it does\ntell me that those files, wait,\n\n483\n00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:46.930\nit's not showing them anymore, right?\n\n484\n00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:49.150\nCuz I cleared the history,\nkind of like temporary files.\n\n485\n00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:53.424\nBut If you don't wanna show those,\nyou could always uncheck those.\n\n486\n00:25:53.424 --> 00:25:55.439\nAnd then you can choose Apply or OK.\n\n487\n00:25:55.439 --> 00:25:58.720\nI'm gonna choose Apply cuz I wanna\nshow you one other tab, too.\n\n488\n00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:02.060\nRemember, though we were talking\nabout hiding file extensions or\n\n489\n00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:03.600\nnot hiding file extensions?\n\n490\n00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.690\nWell, when I clicked that in the ribbon\nI said show me those extensions,\n\n491\n00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:09.120\nnotice how it cleared the check mark,\nright there.\n\n492\n00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.370\nHide extension for known file types,\nor hidden files and folders.\n\n493\n00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:16.440\nSo you can also modify file explorer,\nthe way it looks,\n\n494\n00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.580\nnot only from the ribbon, but\nyou can also do it from folder options.\n\n495\n00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:21.530\nI did say, Dan, I wanted to show\nyou that from the control panel,\n\n496\n00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:23.140\ncuz that's what we're talking about here,\nright?\n\n497\n00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:24.315\nIs the control panel.\n\n498\n00:26:24.315 --> 00:26:28.640\nLet me go ahead and right-click on\nthe Windows icon, choose control panel.\n\n499\n00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.890\nAnd I'm gonna switch it up\na little bit on this one Dan.\n\n500\n00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:33.920\nI'm actually gonna go from category view,\n\n501\n00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:38.830\nto large icons,\nbecause this one is a lot easier to find.\n\n502\n00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:41.955\nNotice it's called file explorer options.\n\n503\n00:26:41.955 --> 00:26:43.226\nThat's something that's\na little bit different.\n\n504\n00:26:43.226 --> 00:26:46.051\nYou notice I'm still\ncalling it folder options,\n\n505\n00:26:46.051 --> 00:26:49.346\nwell that's because if you've\never launched it before,\n\n506\n00:26:49.346 --> 00:26:53.530\nit used to say folder options right here,\nand that's a bad habit of mine.\n\n507\n00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:57.240\nIt is file explorer options because\nthat's what you're modifying today.\n\n508\n00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:01.820\nAnd you can say open file explorer to\nquick access, or you could even that, you\n\n509\n00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:05.112\ncan change it to this PC like you've seen\non the left hand side, that's up to you.\n\n510\n00:27:05.112 --> 00:27:09.050\nCouple of different ways that you can\nget to your file explorer options.\n\n511\n00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:15.280\nMake sure I get that right and stop that\nbad habit, so that you can modify, manage,\n\n512\n00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:18.724\nand maintain the different files and\nfolders you have on your Windows system.\n\n513\n00:27:18.724 --> 00:27:21.520\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, well,\na lot of great options here, as well.\n\n514\n00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.300\nWe thank you for your demonstrations,\nyour explanations that you give us.\n\n515\n00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:26.280\nYou always do a great job\nof explaining things so\n\n516\n00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:30.400\nthat we can understand them and apply\nthem in our everyday computing lives.\n\n517\n00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.782\nSo we do thank you for dropping by, but\n\n518\n00:27:31.782 --> 00:27:33.694\nit looks like that's all\nthe time we have for today.\n\n519\n00:27:33.694 --> 00:27:37.256\nWe thank you guys for joining us as\nwell but it is time for us to sign off.\n\n520\n00:27:37.256 --> 00:27:39.807\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n521\n00:27:39.807 --> 00:27:40.656\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n522\n00:27:40.656 --> 00:27:42.920\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n523\n00:27:42.920 -->

00:00:12.420\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.270\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings good people and\n\n5\n00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.430\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.370\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's we continue forth with more on our\n\n7\n00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.280\nMTA series, that's right,\nthe good old, what is it, 98 349.\n\n8\n00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.903\nThat's right.\n\n9\n00:00:24.903 --> 00:00:26.071\nAnd this time I didn't cheat.\n\n10\n00:00:26.071 --> 00:00:28.434\nI didn't look at my cheat sheet there,\nI actually memorized that.\n\n11\n00:00:28.434 --> 00:00:31.914\nJoining us back in the studio again\nto lend his expertise on that topic,\n\n12\n00:00:31.914 --> 00:00:33.670\nour good friend, Mr. Wes Bryant.\n\n13\n00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.610\nWes, welcome back sir.\n\n14\n00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:35.260\nHow's it going today?\n\n15\n00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.311\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, man, props.\n\n16\n00:00:36.311 --> 00:00:37.255\nI don't know how you do it\nsometimes with all those numbers.\n\n17\n00:00:37.255 --> 00:00:40.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, we're coming back with OS\n\n18\n00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.916\nfundamentals, and we're gonna be looking\nat some basic stuff today, maybe some\n\n19\n00:00:44.916 --> 00:00:49.220\nstuff that you've seen, day in and day out\nand maybe you don't even think about it.\n\n20\n00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.290\nBut for those of you that are studying for\n\n21\n00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.692\nthe MTA exam, we do want you to be\nfamiliar with some of these settings, and\n\n22\n00:00:54.692 --> 00:00:59.120\nwell the objectives call out, so\nwe're here to get our work done for sure.\n\n23\n00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.750\nAnd speaking of that, getting our work\ndone, the first thing that we're gonna\n\n24\n00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.550\ntalk about is how we get our work\ndone in the operating system.\n\n25\n00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.075\nAnd the primary interface that we've\nbeen working with, pretty much going\n\n26\n00:01:09.075 --> 00:01:12.227\nback to the early days of Windows\nis something known as the desktop.\n\n27\n00:01:12.227 --> 00:01:15.460\nI believe that goes back as far as what,\nsomething like Windows 95.\n\n28\n00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.700\nSo it's been around for a while and\n\n29\n00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.440\nit's definitely had some changes, through\nthe various additions of Windows, but for\n\n30\n00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.520\nthe most part today,\nI really like the Windows 10 desktop.\n\n31\n00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.030\nIt looks really good, and I tell you,\nthey've made some good improvements.\n\n32\n00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.260\nSo let's go ahead and let's just jump in\nand let's talk about some of the things\n\n33\n00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.040\nthat you would do in order to configure\nyour desktop and the settings around it.\n\n34\n00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.830\nI've got my Windows machine here pulled\nup and you can see, well here's a basic\n\n35\n00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.600\ndesktop and like I said guys,\nthis isn't anything really advanced here.\n\n36\n00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.280\nYou've probably seen a desktop or\n\n37\n00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.370\ntwo in your lifetime whether it be\nWindows 7, Windows 8, maybe XP and\n\n38\n00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.338\nit is the primary graphical user\ninterface that we use inside of Windows.\n\n39\n00:01:57.338 --> 00:02:00.414\nBeing that it's the first thing\nthat we see after we log in and\n\n40\n00:02:00.414 --> 00:02:04.031\nthere's various things that you can\ndo with it, but let's go ahead and\n\n41\n00:02:04.031 --> 00:02:06.923\nlook at some of the things that\nthey call out on the exam and\n\n42\n00:02:06.923 --> 00:02:10.267\nthen we'll come back to some of\nthe basics on the desktop itself.\n\n43\n00:02:10.267 --> 00:02:13.001\nThe first thing we're going to look\nat are display settings because,\n\n44\n00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:15.640\nlet's just face it, if your display\nsettings aren't right well,\n\n45\n00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.840\nyou can't really work with\nyour desktop to begin with.\n\n46\n00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.705\nLet's go ahead and\n\n47\n00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:21.850\nlook at some of the things that you\ncan do with your display settings.\n\n48\n00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.630\nNow, where do we go inside of our\noperating system in order to figure out\n\n49\n00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.230\nhow do we configure\nthose display settings?\n\n50\n00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.640\nWell they make it really easy for\nyou and it starts with your desktop.\n\n51\n00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.060\nAnd we'll show you a couple\ndifferent ways here.\n\n52\n00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.890\nIf I was to right-click on my desktop\nyou can see some right-click options,\n\n53\n00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.410\nand there's various options that\nwe can do, that we can look at,\n\n54\n00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.820\nviewing the icons on the desktop, sorting\nicons, if I have them on the desktop,\n\n55\n00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.520\nI can sort them by name, and\nas well as creating some new things.\n\n56\n00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.850\nFor instance, if you have the Office Suite\ninstalled, you'd see that here in\n\n57\n00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.960\nyour new menu and you could\ncreate thing like text documents.\n\n58\n00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.160\nBut the one that I really want\nhere is display settings.\n\n59\n00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.990\nSo we'll go ahead and launch that up and\nthis launches the newer settings menu\n\n60\n00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.810\nthat's inside of the operating system, a\nlittle bit different than the traditional\n\n61\n00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.670\ncontrol panel that we've talked\nabout in previous episodes.\n\n62\n00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.560\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead and we'll show\nyou a couple of different ways that you\n\n63\n00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.200\ncan get to these display settings and\n\n64\n00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.364\nthen we'll look at what you can\nactually do with those settings.\n\n65\n00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:21.570\nSo, that's one way, the other way that you\ncan do this is through the action center.\n\n66\n00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.010\nThat is new,\nwell the action center's been around, but\n\n67\n00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.930\nwhere they put it in\nWindows 10 is kind of new.\n\n68\n00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.290\nAnd my head's kind of covering it up, but\n\n69\n00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.530\nthere's a little icon in\nthe lower right hand corner here.\n\n70\n00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.100\nYou can see all the way at\nthe bottom of the taskbar and\n\n71\n00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.470\nwe're gonna look at that\ntaskbar coming up as well.\n\n72\n00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.552\nAnd notice it says, no new,\nI can't say it, notifications.\n\n73\n00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:40.209\n&gt;&gt; Nudeifications.\n\n74\n00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:41.985\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's not something that you want,\n\n75\n00:03:41.985 --> 00:03:42.660\nthat's for sure.\n\n76\n00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.260\nSo we don't have any notifications,\nwe'll try that, a little bit easier there.\n\n77\n00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.210\nAnd notice that I've got a heads up,\nkind of a quick heads up,\n\n78\n00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.960\nof things that are going on in\nthe computer but I want to go ahead and\n\n79\n00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.110\nchoose the all settings button.\n\n80\n00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.760\nAnd then from the all settings\nbutton we can go back to system and\n\n81\n00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.850\nthen from the system you can see,\nwell it starts us out on display.\n\n82\n00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.025\nSo we're essentially back to where we\nwere when we started out on the desktop.\n\n83\n00:04:06.025 --> 00:04:08.234\nLet me go ahead and\nwe will close that down and\n\n84\n00:04:08.234 --> 00:04:12.830\nI'm gonna show you the traditional control\npanel way that you can do this likewise.\n\n85\n00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.702\nI'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna\nright-click on our Windows icon and\n\n86\n00:04:15.702 --> 00:04:17.315\nthen I'm gonna choose control panel.\n\n87\n00:04:17.315 --> 00:04:19.848\nAnd then from the left-hand side,\nsecond down from the top,\n\n88\n00:04:19.848 --> 00:04:22.050\nyou're gonna see appearance and\npersonalization.\n\n89\n00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.170\nAnd then the second from\nthe top here is display.\n\n90\n00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.080\nAnd when I pull this up,\nthis is the traditional control panel way.\n\n91\n00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.500\nSo I want you guys to know the new\nas well as something that we've been\n\n92\n00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.190\nusing for awhile.\n\n93\n00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.610\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and for\nnow I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n94\n00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.960\nclose down the old way,\ncuz we wanna live in the now.\n\n95\n00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.640\nYou remember that Windows 10 is gonna be\nsomething that's gonna be on this exam, so\n\n96\n00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.260\nwe wanna make you familiar, so basically\nI'm gonna go back to the newer interface.\n\n97\n00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.711\nAnd this is where, well, you can see it,\nit tells you right there at the top,\n\n98\n00:04:49.711 --> 00:04:51.645\nthis is where you customize your display.\n\n99\n00:04:51.645 --> 00:04:53.442\nAnd there are some things that you can do,\nand\n\n100\n00:04:53.442 --> 00:04:55.110\nthere are some things that you can't do.\n\n101\n00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.000\nOne of the very first things that\nyou can see here at the top is that\n\n102\n00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.330\nwe can identify and detect.\n\n103\n00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.300\nLet me tell you a little bit about what\nthose two options mean right here.\n\n104\n00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.090\nNow, identify, when you have more than\none, well actually let me show you,\n\n105\n00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.870\nprobably when you have one monitor\nyou only see the number one, but\n\n106\n00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.760\nthis is really good in an arrangement\nwhere you have more than one monitor,\n\n107\n00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.160\nmultiple monitors.\n\n108\n00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.830\nIf you've ever seen somebody say,\nmy monitors aren't arranged right and\n\n109\n00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.970\nthey literally, physically, just try to\nrearrange their monitors, you can them no\n\n110\n00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.940\nno no, don't go through that problem,\ndon't go through that hassle.\n\n111\n00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.770\nIn fact, if you do an identify, you can\nfind out which monitor the operating\n\n112\n00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.982\nsystem currently sees as one, two, three,\nfour, six if you have six monitors.\n\n113\n00:05:34.982 --> 00:05:39.101\nAnd then you can arrange them\nwith this box pattern right here.\n\n114\n00:05:39.101 --> 00:05:42.317\nAnd I could drag these around if I had\nmore then one and then I could arrange\n\n115\n00:05:42.317 --> 00:05:45.130\nthem according to what the physical\nlayout is of the monitors.\n\n116\n00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.940\n&gt;&gt; Right Wes it's like a virtual graphical\nrepresentation of what you're seeing in\n\n117\n00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:49.760\nthe physical world.\n\n118\n00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.190\nSo if you see one and two side by side but\n\n119\n00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.580\nin the physical world you're seeing two\nand one well you just swap them around.\n\n120\n00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.170\nYou can click and\ndrag them around to where you like them.\n\n121\n00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.720\nI do this as well because a lot of\ntimes I'll have one monitor kind of\n\n122\n00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.330\nhigher than the other.\n\n123\n00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.890\nI use my laptop as a monitor as well so\nI can set them in an arrangement where\n\n124\n00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.170\nI'm not bumping into the wall,\nthe invisible wall there with my mouse.\n\n125\n00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.490\nIt's just it looks just like it\ndoes in my physical life, so\n\n126\n00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.940\nI can just slide right over,\neverything is very fluid.\n\n127\n00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:15.730\nIt's very handy.\n\n128\n00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.710\nI have used this a ton, it's very helpful.\n\n129\n00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.700\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell you too, you can actually\nbe the hero of your office If you\n\n130\n00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.370\nhave other people in the office that\ndon't know about this, you can say,\n\n131\n00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.350\nno stand back, let me make this happen and\nthat's when the magic begins.\n\n132\n00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:29.271\nNow the other one is detect.\n\n133\n00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:32.827\nThat's right next to it, you might see,\nand again this is more for\n\n134\n00:06:32.827 --> 00:06:33.980\nmultiple monitors.\n\n135\n00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.460\nIf you happen to have a monitor that you\nplug in and maybe it doesn't do things\n\n136\n00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:42.590\nlike auto adjustment or, the operating\nsystem usually is really good about\n\n137\n00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.320\nrecognizing it right away and\nthrowing it here in this list.\n\n138\n00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.160\nHowever, if for some reason it doesn't,\nyou can choose detect, and\n\n139\n00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.370\nwhen you choose detect,\nthe other monitor will show up.\n\n140\n00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:58.520\nNow, I don't have a second monitor\nshowed up here, but if it was there,\n\n141\n00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.790\na lot of times what you'll see is now it\ncomes on and a portion of the desktop,\n\n142\n00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.760\ndepending on how you have it set up,\nwill show up on there as well.\n\n143\n00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.740\nNow there is,\nyou can see there is orientation.\n\n144\n00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.330\nNow this is grayed out for me.\n\n145\n00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:17.130\nAnd Dan, one of the reasons it's grayed\nout is because I don't have, for\n\n146\n00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.270\ninstance, a tablet or a mobile device,\nbut I will tell you too, and\n\n147\n00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.740\nI only got a single monitor.\n\n148\n00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.710\nBut this also works not only on tablets,\ndon't just think tablets guys.\n\n149\n00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:30.430\nBut in fact our dev team here at ITProTV\nthey need a little bit more real estate\n\n150\n00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.940\non their screen when they're doing code,\ncuz they have several hundreds and\n\n151\n00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.280\nhundreds, if not thousands of\nlines of code they're looking at.\n\n152\n00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:40.180\nSo what they're gonna do is they're\ngonna put one of their monitors\n\n153\n00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.880\nin what's known as this landscape mode.\n\n154\n00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.498\nThat's the normal mode that maybe you and\nI use from day to day.\n\n155\n00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:48.920\nBut then the other one they're gonna do is\nit's gonna turn the monitor upright and\n\n156\n00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.614\nthey're gonna put it in portrait mode.\n\n157\n00:07:50.614 --> 00:07:53.166\nAnd that's how a lot of our\ndevelopment team works,\n\n158\n00:07:53.166 --> 00:07:57.168\nbecause they have their normal monitor\nthat they're doing, you know, whatever\n\n159\n00:07:57.168 --> 00:08:01.054\nit is that they do day to day, and then\nwhen they're really crunching the code,\n\n160\n00:08:01.054 --> 00:08:05.115\nthey'll bring that over to a portrait\nfacing monitor that's you know, upright.\n\n161\n00:08:05.115 --> 00:08:06.601\nSo you can also do that.\n\n162\n00:08:06.601 --> 00:08:08.736\nYou have the ability as well.\n\n163\n00:08:08.736 --> 00:08:13.110\nNow if it happens to be\na tablet of some sort, right.\n\n164\n00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.940\nThen has a touch screen monitor, then\nyou can also lock the rotation of this.\n\n165\n00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.810\nI don't know if you've ever done that,\nleft it unlocked and\n\n166\n00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.190\nyou turn the tablet or\nyou don't turn the tablet.\n\n167\n00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.620\nIt just, the, what is it?\n\n168\n00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:24.810\n&gt;&gt; The gyros.\n\n169\n00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:25.500\n&gt;&gt; The gyros.\n\n170\n00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.069\nCatch it just a slight movement and\n\n171\n00:08:27.069 --> 00:08:30.530\nthey change their arrangement of your\nmonitor well you can lock that down and\n\n172\n00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:33.980\nmake it a little bit easier so\nit doesn't happen to you.\n\n173\n00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.560\nThe other thing that you can do\nis you can change the brightness\n\n174\n00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.930\nautomatically when the lighting changes,\ndepending on the model that you have.\n\n175\n00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:44.180\nI don't have that feature available\nbecause I don't have that\n\n176\n00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:48.360\nhardware built into the machine so\nthat's why it's non-existent here so\n\n177\n00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.380\nkeep in mind, you might have these and\nyou might not have these,\n\n178\n00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.520\ndepending on the hardware that\nyou have Windows installed on.\n\n179\n00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.530\nWindows is pretty good at\nrecognizing the devices that\n\n180\n00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.500\nyou are installing the operating\nsystem going out the gate.\n\n181\n00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.340\n&gt;&gt; So, Wes, what are some of the more\nadvanced options we're going to look at?\n\n182\n00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.720\nI mean, everybody deals with landscape.\n\n183\n00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.350\nThis is nice, it's the most\n\n184\n00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:10.480\ncommon things that we're gonna\nbe doing with our monitors.\n\n185\n00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.010\nWhat are more, some of the.\n\n186\n00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.130\nI'm a little more on the techie side, I\nwanna get into more of the advanced stuff.\n\n187\n00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:15.930\nWhat can we do there?\n\n188\n00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.550\n&gt;&gt; You know, that's actually a Catch-22.\n\n189\n00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.100\nI'm glad you asked that.\n\n190\n00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.580\nBecause, Dan, what is one thing you\nalmost always have to do when you\n\n191\n00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:24.100\nconnect to a monitor for the first time?\n\n192\n00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.800\nWhat is one of the major\nconfigurations that you have to do?\n\n193\n00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.490\n&gt;&gt; I'm probably gonna change\nthe screen resolution.\n\n194\n00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:29.320\n&gt;&gt; The resolution.\n\n195\n00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.530\nAnd if you look at my screen here, this\nis something that's new to Windows 10.\n\n196\n00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.390\nI can't change the resolution.\n\n197\n00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.610\nSo, to answer your first question,\n\n198\n00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:41.730\nthe first thing that you have to do is go\nto advanced display settings down here,\n\n199\n00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.430\njust to be able to get\naccess to your resolution.\n\n200\n00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:45.890\nWe'll go ahead and\nclick that and back out.\n\n201\n00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.308\nAnd now, you can see what Dan\nwas mentioning right there.\n\n202\n00:09:48.308 --> 00:09:49.878\nNotice I have this for the show, so\n\n203\n00:09:49.878 --> 00:09:53.194\nthat you guys don't get the black\nbars around there, and it looks good.\n\n204\n00:09:53.194 --> 00:09:57.630\nBut we have it at 720, or\nexcuse me I'm sorry 1280 by 720.\n\n205\n00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.690\nAnd if fact I'll change this just for\na second and\n\n206\n00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:02.890\nI'm gonna change it right back because\nyou guys can see how it does change.\n\n207\n00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:03.630\nThe arrangement.\n\n208\n00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:04.880\nOne of the great things, and\n\n209\n00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:10.220\nthis started I want to say back in\nWindows 98 if not Windows 2000.\n\n210\n00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.250\nIf I don't do anything to the monitor,\n\n211\n00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:16.400\nyou're going see that it's going to revert\nback to the settings that it was before.\n\n212\n00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.280\nSo we can just wait here a second and\nthere you go.\n\n213\n00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.920\nIt goes back to what it was before.\n\n214\n00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.090\nWhy does it do that?\n\n215\n00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:24.550\nWell, prior to that, in the days that you\nwould configure a resolution that your\n\n216\n00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.810\nmonitor wouldn't support,\nWindows would stick it there, and\n\n217\n00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:29.610\nyou couldn't see your screen anymore.\n\n218\n00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:31.130\nAt all.\nYou couldn't even work with your computer.\n\n219\n00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:31.930\nSo, what would you have to do?\n\n220\n00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:34.590\nYou'd have to reboot the computer,\nboot into safe mode, and\n\n221\n00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:36.370\nchange [LAUGH] your resolution.\n\n222\n00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:40.690\nThey got smart enough to say that if you\ncouldn't see the Apply button, then your\n\n223\n00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:44.620\nresolution wasn't set correctly, so\nthey leave the focus on the Revert option.\n\n224\n00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:48.790\nAnd the thought process is if I can't see\nthat Revert button or that Apply button,\n\n225\n00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:53.280\nthen at least it'll go back to the old\nway, or the previous configuration, and\n\n226\n00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.350\nthen I don't have to restart\nmy computer in Safe Mode.\n\n227\n00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:57.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was a headache,\nI remember those days.\n\n228\n00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.090\nAnd you got really good at\nbooting into safe mode back in\n\n229\n00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:01.116\nthe 98 era, that's for sure.\n\n230\n00:11:01.116 --> 00:11:01.720\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n231\n00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.931\nYou're like a gunslinger with\n\n232\n00:11:02.931 --> 00:11:03.848\nthat F8 button,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n233\n00:11:03.848 --> 00:11:05.400\n&gt;&gt; Man I can get to that quick.\n\n234\n00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.465\nAnd that's right, but\nlet's go a little bit farther.\n\n235\n00:11:07.465 --> 00:11:10.250\nCuz Dan was talking about some\nadvanced settings that you can do.\n\n236\n00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:12.820\nLike for instance,\nyou have color management here.\n\n237\n00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:18.600\nAnd color management really is about\nprofiles that can be set, color profiles.\n\n238\n00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:25.510\nAnd you can see that it's\nnot just the display here.\n\n239\n00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:28.930\nFor instance, if I'm printing too,\nI wanna make sure that a certain color\n\n240\n00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:32.180\nprofile's applied, so\nthat my printout prints out a certain way.\n\n241\n00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.320\nAnd you could see all the profiles\nthat are in the machines.\n\n242\n00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.730\nAgain, just know that it's there.\n\n243\n00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:40.820\nI'm not sure that they're gonna have you\nadjusting color profiles on the MTA exam,\n\n244\n00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.220\nbut at least, you'll know where it is.\n\n245\n00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.030\nJust in case, maybe, they do ask you.\n\n246\n00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:45.660\nAnd then,\nyou can go a little bit more advanced and\n\n247\n00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.740\nyou can really peek and tweak here.\n\n248\n00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:50.780\nI'm not gonna peek and tweak any of\nthese color profiles or anything.\n\n249\n00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:54.310\nBut then we have color calibration and\nif you ever feel that maybe your\n\n250\n00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.160\ncolor when you're looking at it\ndoesn't look quite right, well,\n\n251\n00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.730\nyou can go through the color calibration.\n\n252\n00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:03.280\nAnd the color calibration is just a really\nintuitive point and click wizard.\n\n253\n00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.608\nMy head's kind of covering it up but\n\n254\n00:12:04.608 --> 00:12:06.970\nyou can see there's only two options here,\nright.\n\n255\n00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:08.510\nI've got Next and I've got Cancel.\n\n256\n00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:10.690\nSo it doesn't,\nyou don't really have to be.\n\n257\n00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:12.670\nEven though they call\nit an advanced setting.\n\n258\n00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:14.530\nYou don't really have to be\nthat advanced to do this.\n\n259\n00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:16.120\nWe can just walk through this.\n\n260\n00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.790\nAnd it basically tells you\n\n261\n00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:22.200\nthat you're going to get started\nwith some basic color settings.\n\n262\n00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.290\nWe'll go ahead, next through here.\n\n263\n00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:24.450\nTalks about the gamma.\n\n264\n00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:27.200\nIt shows you what you should see,\nversus what's.\n\n265\n00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.590\nNot really right.\n\n266\n00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:29.950\nAnd then we'll choose Next.\n\n267\n00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:34.390\nAnd it gives you the ability to set that\nbased on what you feel it should be.\n\n268\n00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:36.890\nMine's already set,\nI've already configured this beforehand.\n\n269\n00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:39.980\nBut, I could bump up\nthe slider if I wanted to.\n\n270\n00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:43.130\nAnd then we can do a brightness and\ncontrast adjustment.\n\n271\n00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:47.460\nAnd it shows you what it should be, and\nyou can see right there in the middle.\n\n272\n00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.760\nAnd then it shows you\nwhat it currently is and\n\n273\n00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.510\nif you feel that it's not right\nyou can make adjustments to it.\n\n274\n00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:55.520\nAnd then finally, we've got the contrast.\n\n275\n00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.040\nAnd again,\n\n276\n00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:00.400\nthey give you an example of what should\nbe versus what yours is right now.\n\n277\n00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.120\nAnd they tell us, hey,\n\n278\n00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.990\nif you can see the wrinkles in his\nwhite shirt then you're doing good.\n\n279\n00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:07.940\nIf you adjust it, the contrast, and\nyou lose those wrinkles in there,\n\n280\n00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.210\nthen well your contrast\nisn't really that good.\n\n281\n00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:14.490\nSee I'm for sure not a color or\nvideo expert by any means.\n\n282\n00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:18.310\nWe've got a production staff that knows\nit like a science, but it makes it for\n\n283\n00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:23.240\nsomebody like me who doesn't understand\nthose things fairly easy to walk through,\n\n284\n00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:29.050\ngo ahead and set it and I didn't have to\nbe a video expert or graphics expert.\n\n285\n00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:31.680\nAnd you can see a few more\nthings that we can do here.\n\n286\n00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:36.110\nAnd then finally,\nonce that's done you can choose finish.\n\n287\n00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:38.800\nAll right, and\nonce you choose finish you can't see\n\n288\n00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.240\nit right here because there's a couple\nof changes that I didn't make to it.\n\n289\n00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.595\nI don't want to mess up\nthe screen here on camera.\n\n290\n00:13:44.595 --> 00:13:48.125\nYou can turn around and now that becomes\na color profile that you can select.\n\n291\n00:13:48.125 --> 00:13:51.555\nHowever, I will tell you,\nif you don't make any choices and\n\n292\n00:13:51.555 --> 00:13:52.945\nyou're not gonna change anything,\ngo ahead and\n\n293\n00:13:52.945 --> 00:13:56.875\ncancel out of the wizard,\nbecause it'll just stay the basic profile.\n\n294\n00:13:56.875 --> 00:14:02.445\nAnd you won't have to add another\nslider button here or a drop down menu.\n\n295\n00:14:02.445 --> 00:14:05.375\nCouple other things that we can do here,\nclear text type, this is\n\n296\n00:14:05.375 --> 00:14:08.770\nexactly what it sounds like, it's another\nwizard just like the one we showed.\n\n297\n00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:13.070\nThat tries to adjust the text on the\nscreen to where you can see it clearest.\n\n298\n00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:17.920\nAnd I have four eyes here so\nI might need to do that.\n\n299\n00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:21.600\nBut again Windows has already\ndone this fairly well for me.\n\n300\n00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.850\nSo when I open up the ClearText wizard\nI really don't have to go through it.\n\n301\n00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:29.500\nIt's gonna do like the doctor's office,\nI know you got glasses there Dan.\n\n302\n00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.210\nWhere they put one patch over your eye and\n\n303\n00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:36.640\nthen they sit there and they switch\nback and forth between what's clear.\n\n304\n00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:37.580\nIs this clearer?\n\n305\n00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:41.755\nIs this fuzzy or clear, fuzzy clear?\n\n306\n00:14:41.755 --> 00:14:43.289\n&gt;&gt; Number one or number two?\n\n307\n00:14:43.289 --> 00:14:44.447\n&gt;&gt; That's exact-\n&gt;&gt; Number one or number-\n\n308\n00:14:44.447 --> 00:14:45.034\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly,\n\n309\n00:14:45.034 --> 00:14:46.325\nit sounds like you've done that before.\n\n310\n00:14:46.325 --> 00:14:47.357\n&gt;&gt; I've been down that\nroad a couple times.\n\n311\n00:14:47.357 --> 00:14:48.450\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that's what this is\n\n312\n00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:49.795\ngonna do as we walk through this.\n\n313\n00:14:49.795 --> 00:14:51.945\nAnd I can just next through this\nhere I'm not gonna change anything.\n\n314\n00:14:51.945 --> 00:14:55.105\nYou can see they're basically\nshowing you the exact same text.\n\n315\n00:14:56.155 --> 00:14:57.555\nIn quite a few different times.\n\n316\n00:14:57.555 --> 00:14:59.305\nJust to make sure that you're\npicking the right one.\n\n317\n00:14:59.305 --> 00:15:01.515\nAnd it's not any mind tricks,\n\n318\n00:15:01.515 --> 00:15:06.130\nas it is just really something\nwrong with the text on the screen.\n\n319\n00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:07.588\nAnd we'll choose finish.\n\n320\n00:15:07.588 --> 00:15:12.200\nAll right now as far as the, about\nthe last one in the advanced settings I'd\n\n321\n00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.330\nwant to talk about is the Display\nadapter properties here.\n\n322\n00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:19.710\nAnd this can also be found inside\nof Device Manager, guys, but\n\n323\n00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:24.360\nkeep in mind, this puts everything\nrelated to your display in front of you.\n\n324\n00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.850\nRight?\nWhere if we're in Device Manager,\n\n325\n00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:28.670\nwe're gonna have all the hardware\ncomponents that doesn't have\n\n326\n00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:31.900\nto be centric to your display properties.\n\n327\n00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.855\nAll right.\nSo we'll go ahead and launch that and\n\n328\n00:15:33.855 --> 00:15:37.210\nthen again you can see, well,\nhere's a little bit of information about\n\n329\n00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:40.290\nthe adapter and I really wanna see\nthe properties and the drivers,\n\n330\n00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:43.700\nI can just choose Properties and this\nis the same thing that you would see in\n\n331\n00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:47.503\nDevice Manager or you can do things like\ndriver management on your video adapter.\n\n332\n00:15:47.503 --> 00:15:52.169\nAll right, so we've got a lot of control,\nDan, over the settings that we use to\n\n333\n00:15:52.169 --> 00:15:56.280\ncontrol the display inside of our\noperating system, and you also have\n\n334\n00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:00.341\nthe ability to peek and tweak it to\nmake sure that it suits your needs.\n\n335\n00:16:00.341 --> 00:16:03.089\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and that's good stuff to\nknow because Everybody knows you're gonna\n\n336\n00:16:03.089 --> 00:16:05.681\nbuy a monitor, you're gonna get a better\nmonitor, your monitor is gonna die one\n\n337\n00:16:05.681 --> 00:16:08.570\nday, you're gonna have to get another one,\nbut your computer is not necessarily gone.\n\n338\n00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:13.029\nSo you wanna make sure that you're able to\nget your computer to work with any monitor\n\n339\n00:16:13.029 --> 00:16:15.077\nthat you might attach to your system.\n\n340\n00:16:15.077 --> 00:16:19.286\nThat being said, Ryan West, we're kinda\ngonna jump into another topic not quite\n\n341\n00:16:19.286 --> 00:16:23.681\nconnected, but definitely can be a mystery\nto a lot people especially if they're new\n\n342\n00:16:23.681 --> 00:16:27.100\nto computers, icons on their screen,\nthings look crazy.\n\n343\n00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.870\nAnd that's the shortcut,\nthe idea of the shortcut.\n\n344\n00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:32.760\nCan you demystify that for\nus and the good people at home?\n\n345\n00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.650\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nA shortcut really is nothing more than\n\n346\n00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:37.610\na pointer to an application that\nmakes it easier for you to get to it.\n\n347\n00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:40.865\nSo you don't have to do an underwater\nfree dive to try to find it and\n\n348\n00:16:40.865 --> 00:16:43.420\n[LAUGH] get to that application,\nessentially.\n\n349\n00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:46.260\nAnd we can create shortcuts\nright here on the desktop.\n\n350\n00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.700\nRemember that the point\nof this episode is really\n\n351\n00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.970\nfocusing on things like your display\nsettings, your desktop and shortcuts.\n\n352\n00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:56.470\nAnd all of these centered right\naround that main graphical interface.\n\n353\n00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:58.008\nLet me go ahead and show you what I mean.\n\n354\n00:16:58.008 --> 00:17:01.950\nIf I right-click on my desktop here,\nagain remember we have the view by.\n\n355\n00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:05.880\nAnd I'll show you real quick,\nI could change the icon size here.\n\n356\n00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:10.143\nBut you'll notice that we also have\nthis New option and then from that,\n\n357\n00:17:10.143 --> 00:17:14.425\nwe have another suboption menu and\nright there at the top is Shortcuts.\n\n358\n00:17:14.425 --> 00:17:15.265\nLet's say for\n\n359\n00:17:15.265 --> 00:17:19.956\ninstance I'm constantly opening File\nExplorer to get to Local Disk C, right?\n\n360\n00:17:19.956 --> 00:17:21.895\nAnd maybe I don't wanna do that, okay?\n\n361\n00:17:21.895 --> 00:17:25.312\nNow I know this is just a click of the\nbutton, depends on which button you click,\n\n362\n00:17:25.312 --> 00:17:26.800\ncould be just as easy.\n\n363\n00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:30.510\nBut I could make it potentially a little\nbit easier by creating a shortcut.\n\n364\n00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:33.110\nNow, I could say well,\nwhat is the location of this item?\n\n365\n00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:38.005\nIf I wanted to, I could really dig deep\nhere and I could get into Program Files.\n\n366\n00:17:38.005 --> 00:17:41.790\nAnd then I could put a program\nright there on the desktop.\n\n367\n00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:44.590\nSo for instance, if I wanted Chrome there,\nright, I could say okay,\n\n368\n00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:46.850\nwe're gonna put Chrome there.\n\n369\n00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:48.530\nAnd we'll call it Chrome.\n\n370\n00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:53.288\nName it and in fact, let me go ahead\njust cuz the OCD, I'll capitalize that.\n\n371\n00:17:53.288 --> 00:17:54.736\nAnd I could choose Finish and\n\n372\n00:17:54.736 --> 00:17:57.760\nthen sure enough I've got\nthe Chrome icon on the desktop.\n\n373\n00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.390\nNow, the other thing that I can do here,\nlike I said, is Local Disk C.\n\n374\n00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:05.010\nMaybe I'm constantly in the root drive and\n\n375\n00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:07.360\nI want access to that right\nthere on the desktop.\n\n376\n00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:11.310\nWell this is as simple as doing C:\\ and\nchoosing Next.\n\n377\n00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:16.095\nNotice that it knew what I wanted and it\njust named it right there, Local Disk (C).\n\n378\n00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:20.168\nI can choose Finish, and then sure enough,\nif I wanna get to Local Disk C,\n\n379\n00:18:20.168 --> 00:18:22.100\nall I have to do is double click it.\n\n380\n00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.350\nNow it went right to File Explorer,\nguys, then you might argue well,\n\n381\n00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:29.420\nyou could've just hit the folder icon\non your taskbar, but again, remember,\n\n382\n00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:32.380\nthey might want you to create\nthese shortcuts on the desktop.\n\n383\n00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.200\nOr at least know how to create them.\n\n384\n00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.855\nSo it does make it easier to get\nto your programs like we've shown.\n\n385\n00:18:38.855 --> 00:18:41.800\nIt's also makes it easier to get to\ndifferent directories or folders,\n\n386\n00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.760\nif you will,\nif you're commonly going there.\n\n387\n00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.540\nJust try to simplify your day\nto day work activities and\n\n388\n00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.020\nhopefully make you a little\nbit more productive.\n\n389\n00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:54.080\nAll right, so now, the next part of\nthe desktop that they really want us to\n\n390\n00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:58.670\nlook at is something that went away for\na while and then something that came back.\n\n391\n00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:00.100\nThey introduced it to us.\n\n392\n00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.960\nThey kept it for 25 years.\n\n393\n00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.590\nEverybody got used to it,\nthen they took it out.\n\n394\n00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:04.948\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n395\n00:19:04.948 --> 00:19:06.875\nthen they realized what\na large mistake that was.\n\n396\n00:19:06.875 --> 00:19:08.384\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n397\n00:19:08.384 --> 00:19:11.876\nAnd in Windows 8, 8.1, they went to\na completely different interface so\n\n398\n00:19:11.876 --> 00:19:13.530\nit confused a lot of people.\n\n399\n00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:14.990\nWell I really think\nthey've done a good job,\n\n400\n00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:17.090\nbecause they've kind of brought it back.\n\n401\n00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:20.770\nThey've taken some of the features that\nhonestly, people might not agree with me,\n\n402\n00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:24.050\nthat I really liked in 8.1, and\nthey've kind of fused them together here.\n\n403\n00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:27.160\nInside of the new Start menu,\nthat's what we're talking about here.\n\n404\n00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.924\nSo let's look a little\nbit at the Start menu.\n\n405\n00:19:28.924 --> 00:19:32.755\nAll right, you've got a Windows icon,\ntile if you will, down here.\n\n406\n00:19:32.755 --> 00:19:35.472\nIt used to be called a start button,\nI'm just gonna call it the Windows tile.\n\n407\n00:19:35.472 --> 00:19:41.325\nAnd when you click on that,\nthat takes you to this new Start menu.\n\n408\n00:19:41.325 --> 00:19:45.589\nAll right, and I wanna kinda talk\nabout what you see here in the middle.\n\n409\n00:19:45.589 --> 00:19:51.100\nAll right, if you look at the top, you can\nsee your frequently used applications.\n\n410\n00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:53.870\nNow, I haven't installed\nanything on this machine so\n\n411\n00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:56.080\nthere is a column that's kinda blank here.\n\n412\n00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.380\nAnd I know, Dan, you might be saying,\n\n413\n00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.530\nwell where are the apps you\nfrequently use in this list?\n\n414\n00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:03.840\nWell, they would be,\nthese are the most used,\n\n415\n00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:08.000\nand not frequently used, I'm sorry,\nrecently installed is what I meant to say.\n\n416\n00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.750\nAnd those are typically here\njust under frequently used.\n\n417\n00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:15.762\nSo you might remember in the older days,\nlet's go back to XP, right,\n\n418\n00:20:15.762 --> 00:20:20.114\nXP as you used different applications,\nthey would pop up in the Start menu.\n\n419\n00:20:20.114 --> 00:20:23.278\nAnd you could always clear that, but\nbecause you were commonly using them,\n\n420\n00:20:23.278 --> 00:20:25.440\nthey would put them right there for you.\n\n421\n00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.900\nWell, that's still here as well.\n\n422\n00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:30.100\nYou can see I got my Hyper V, in fact,\nHyper V, I launched right before\n\n423\n00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.250\nwe started the show just to kinda\ncheck a couple of things out.\n\n424\n00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:36.900\nBut then if you've got a whole\nbunch of recently installed apps,\n\n425\n00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:41.410\nthey're gonna show up here at the top too\nand then there's an alphabetic listing of\n\n426\n00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:44.690\nall of the applications that\nyou have on your machine.\n\n427\n00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:48.620\nNow, what I'm gonna show you here\nis new to the anniversary update,\n\n428\n00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.980\nwe're using the sync brand,\nthe latest and greatest.\n\n429\n00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:52.347\nRight?\nWe're using in fact, I'm using,\n\n430\n00:20:52.347 --> 00:20:53.435\nlet me see if I can get this right.\n\n431\n00:20:53.435 --> 00:20:59.086\nWindows 10 Enterprise current branch\nversion 1607, that's a mouthful for sure,\n\n432\n00:20:59.086 --> 00:21:04.360\nand 1607 guys, by the way, let's take\nsome of the cryptic meaning off of that,\n\n433\n00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:08.770\nthat means the anniversary edition,\nafter the anniversary update.\n\n434\n00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:10.790\n&gt;&gt; And you praised me for knowing numbers.\n\n435\n00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:12.171\nPretty good.\n[LAUGH]\n\n436\n00:21:12.171 --> 00:21:12.833\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n437\n00:21:12.833 --> 00:21:17.500\nAnd here is something, Dan, I really like\nthat they've added to the Start menu.\n\n438\n00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.000\nIf I know that I wanna\ngo to Windows tools or\n\n439\n00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.670\nWindows accessories,\nI don't have to scroll all the way down.\n\n440\n00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:26.110\nAll I have to do is hit any of\nthe letters or in this case, a pound.\n\n441\n00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:30.290\nAny of the letters in the Start menu and\nit brings me to this alphabet here and\n\n442\n00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:34.260\nI can hit the letter W and\nit takes me right to the W category or\n\n443\n00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.160\nsection within the Start menu.\n\n444\n00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.880\nI really like that because I go to\nthe Windows Administrative Tools a lot and\n\n445\n00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:40.960\nI don't have to scroll.\n\n446\n00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.620\nI just hit the letter A in this case,\ncuz I first launch it up.\n\n447\n00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:45.850\nOr you have the recently used.\n\n448\n00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:47.770\nYou can look at that, too.\n\n449\n00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:49.140\nMost users they call it.\n\n450\n00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:53.195\nSo they've made the Start menu,\nat least for you application sense,\n\n451\n00:21:53.195 --> 00:21:57.333\na little bit easier to get to\nthe different applications that you have.\n\n452\n00:21:57.333 --> 00:22:01.730\nNow the other thing that we\nhave is on the right side here.\n\n453\n00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:03.220\nAnd what is this right side?\n\n454\n00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:07.760\nWell, this right side is about\nsomething known as the modern UI.\n\n455\n00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.380\nNow remember some of\nthe things that I've told you.\n\n456\n00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:12.962\nI said Windows 8.1 brought some stuff,\nand they've kind of taken that stuff and\n\n457\n00:22:12.962 --> 00:22:14.506\nthey brought it into Windows 10.\n\n458\n00:22:14.506 --> 00:22:18.515\nBut one of the things I really like is\nthat they've kind of changed here is\n\n459\n00:22:18.515 --> 00:22:21.341\nthese modern UI,\nformerly known as metro UI apps,\n\n460\n00:22:21.341 --> 00:22:24.120\nare no longer completely full screen.\n\n461\n00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:27.020\nSo that was one of\nthe drawbacks in Windows 8.1,\n\n462\n00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:30.590\nis if you were launching one of these\napps, it would take up your full screen.\n\n463\n00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:34.497\nBut they've gone ahead and\nthey've kept the modern UI apps and\n\n464\n00:22:34.497 --> 00:22:38.340\nyou can launch them from right here,\nwithin your Start menu.\n\n465\n00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:42.410\nNow that being said believe it or\nnot, Start menu's got more.\n\n466\n00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:46.940\nOn this left hand side,\nwe've got kind of a quick launch location.\n\n467\n00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:50.010\nAnd it's kinda hard to see\ncuz it is minimized here but,\n\n468\n00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:53.300\nif I took the time to go ahead and\nhit the expand option,\n\n469\n00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:58.290\nthese three bars that's the expand option,\nI can scroll down, right?\n\n470\n00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:01.710\nAnd I can see that we've got some\nadditional settings that are kind of\n\n471\n00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:03.120\nhidden right here, right?\n\n472\n00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.410\nWell, I've got Admin.\n\n473\n00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:08.270\nAdmin is the current user that's logged\nin to the machine and if I choose that,\n\n474\n00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:11.360\nyou can see that I also get some options\nlike, changing account settings.\n\n475\n00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.880\nAnd you can do your Windows Lock right\nfrom here rather than doing the Windows\n\n476\n00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.700\nkey L shortcut.\n\n477\n00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.720\nYou can just lock\nthe machine from right here.\n\n478\n00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.510\nOr I could completely sign out.\n\n479\n00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:21.080\nNow the other thing that you can do.\n\n480\n00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.508\nAnd it doesn't really show it right here,\nguys.\n\n481\n00:23:23.508 --> 00:23:27.830\nCuz I don't have another\nuser on this machine.\n\n482\n00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:31.284\nBut if you wanna do a quick fast\nuser switching, if you've got\n\n483\n00:23:31.284 --> 00:23:35.613\nmultiple users on this machine, you\ncould just hit their icon in their name.\n\n484\n00:23:35.613 --> 00:23:40.240\nAnd it would lock your\ncomputer to the current user.\n\n485\n00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.630\nAnd it would bring up the authentication\npage for another person to login so\n\n486\n00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:46.180\nthey still have that fast user switching\n\n487\n00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:50.010\neven though it isn't in the Power menu\nhere that we're gonna see in a second.\n\n488\n00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:54.000\nNow settings guys, that takes us to\nthe same location that you see when we're\n\n489\n00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.300\nconfiguring our display settings.\n\n490\n00:23:55.300 --> 00:24:00.277\nIf I choose settings, it takes me\nto this newer settings interface.\n\n491\n00:24:00.277 --> 00:24:06.452\nAll right, now the other one that's in\nhere as well is well power All right and\n\n492\n00:24:06.452 --> 00:24:11.110\nthe power you guys know what\nthe power button is all about.\n\n493\n00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:15.710\nI can put my computer into sleep, I can\nshut down the computer or you can turn\n\n494\n00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:19.030\naround and restart the computer, so\nthat's pretty self-explanatory there.\n\n495\n00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:23.880\nAll right, now just when you thought\nwe were done with that Windows icon,\n\n496\n00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.980\nwe've got a little bit more\nthat I want you to be aware and\n\n497\n00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:29.770\nthat's something that was a feature\nthat started in Windows 8.\n\n498\n00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:35.400\nIt was made even better in Windows 8.1,\nand now I wanna say that it's really come\n\n499\n00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:40.130\nto a maturity in Windows 10, and that's\nthe quick launch icons, the quick links.\n\n500\n00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.750\nIf I right-click on my Windows key here,\n\n501\n00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:45.450\nnotice all of these things\nthat I have access to.\n\n502\n00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:49.560\nMe, as you can see through the show,\nI use this a lot.\n\n503\n00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.530\nEspecially to get to things\nlike control panel and\n\n504\n00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:57.720\nget to my PowerShell as well as some\ncommon administrative tools too.\n\n505\n00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.970\nNow what can we do for the start menu?\n\n506\n00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:01.640\nAre there things that we can modify?\n\n507\n00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:07.910\nWell, this left hand section isn't\nreally anything you can modify.\n\n508\n00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:11.880\nThe middle section, you really can't\nmodify, but the right hand section,\n\n509\n00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:14.830\nyou do have the ability\nto do minor things.\n\n510\n00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:18.980\nLike for instance, if I right\nclick on any one of these tiles,\n\n511\n00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:21.920\nI can resize them, and\ndepending on if they are a live tile or\n\n512\n00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:26.560\nnot, I could choose to turn off live tile\nand it doesn't show those animations.\n\n513\n00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:30.807\nSo if you are the one that's worried about\nresources, you might wanna turn these\n\n514\n00:25:30.807 --> 00:25:34.806\nLiveTiles off cuz again anything that's\nconstantly updating is using your\n\n515\n00:25:34.806 --> 00:25:38.391\nCPU resources and it's also using\nyour networking resources too.\n\n516\n00:25:38.391 --> 00:25:43.027\nSo if you're on a data plan, if you have\nmaybe one of those 4G cards stuck in your\n\n517\n00:25:43.027 --> 00:25:46.960\ncomputer or you're using,\nyou might wanna turn these off.\n\n518\n00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:51.160\nBut I also have the ability to make it a\nlittle bit easier to find an application,\n\n519\n00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.170\nrather than scrolling through this list.\n\n520\n00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:56.860\nSo for instance, let me see if I\ncan find one that isn't on here.\n\n521\n00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.550\nAll right,\nI'm just gonna put settings up here, and\n\n522\n00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:02.210\nI know it's probably in the list here.\n\n523\n00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:04.480\nBut settings,\nmaybe I wanna get to settings faster.\n\n524\n00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:08.970\nI can always right-click on that, and\nI can choose this option to pin to Start.\n\n525\n00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:13.070\nAll right, and If I pin it to start,\nwell you can see it's now there as\n\n526\n00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:15.530\na tile on the start menu, and\nI can launch it a little quicker.\n\n527\n00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:19.700\nSo again, keep in mind that you\ndo have some flexibility there,\n\n528\n00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:23.290\nand also remember that Windows pane,\nthose administrative Quick Links Menu.\n\n529\n00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:25.230\nI'll tell you, I use that a lot.\n\n530\n00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:28.440\nBut Dan, the start menu's back and\nI think it looks better than ever, and\n\n531\n00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.360\nI really think that it never\nshould have gone anywhere.\n\n532\n00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.900\nBut at least we have it today.\n\n533\n00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:34.630\n&gt;&gt; I understand the reasoning behind it,\nright?\n\n534\n00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:38.700\nTablets were the rage, and that was\nhappening and they wanted to kind of move\n\n535\n00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:41.600\nto that and they realized, you know what,\nwe kinda jumped the gun on this.\n\n536\n00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:45.500\nPeople still use computers in the normal\nfashion, so let's jump back to that.\n\n537\n00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:46.940\nAnd that's exactly what they did.\n\n538\n00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.680\nBut he had a chance to blend\nthe best of both of those worlds and\n\n539\n00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.140\nI think he did a great job on Windows 10.\n\n540\n00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:53.450\nNow you've talked about Start Menu.\n\n541\n00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:55.080\nThat's not the only menu\nthat we have available.\n\n542\n00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.070\nWe also have the task bars\nlike a menu system as well\n\n543\n00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:59.240\nthat we tend to use quite a bit.\n\n544\n00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.991\nAnd I've seen some pretty jacked\nup taskbars in my day, but\n\n545\n00:27:01.991 --> 00:27:05.305\nyou're gonna explain to us how we\ncan jack up our own taskbars, right?\n\n546\n00:27:05.305 --> 00:27:07.864\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right,\nyou can come to ITProTV and\n\n547\n00:27:07.864 --> 00:27:09.770\nwe'll show you how to\nmess up your desktop.\n\n548\n00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:12.130\nWe're just kidding here guys,\nyou don't wanna do that.\n\n549\n00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:15.610\nBut the three main components on your\ndesktop are the icons that you use,\n\n550\n00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:18.890\nthe start menu, and the third one that\nDan just mentioned is the task bar.\n\n551\n00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:20.390\nIt's been around for a while, and\n\n552\n00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:22.960\nit is something that we can use to\nhelp increase our productivity.\n\n553\n00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:25.380\nLet's go ahead and dive in and\nshow you what we're talking about.\n\n554\n00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:29.320\nSo down here at the bottom, this strip\ndown at the bottom is the task bar, here.\n\n555\n00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:31.990\nAnd the taskbar is made up of what\nwe've already looked at, right,\n\n556\n00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:35.660\nthe start button, or the Windows\nicon brings me to the start menu.\n\n557\n00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:36.490\n&gt;&gt; Old habits die hard.\n\n558\n00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:37.645\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n559\n00:27:37.645 --> 00:27:39.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Your search functionality is now\n\n560\n00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:41.010\nbuilt into the taskbar.\n\n561\n00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:45.580\nIn fact, this is also things like,\nit does your traditional run line command.\n\n562\n00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:49.950\nSo for instance, rather than having to\nRight click on the windows icon and\n\n563\n00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:52.720\nchoose RUN, in the traditional\nRUN option you can see for\n\n564\n00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:55.460\ninstance CMDs in there to\nlaunch the command prompt.\n\n565\n00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:57.440\nWe'll lets see if core\ntunnel will help me,\n\n566\n00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.580\nthis is also a core\ntunnel search engine too.\n\n567\n00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.030\nI could type CMD and right there.\n\n568\n00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:03.580\nYou could see I could run command prompt.\n\n569\n00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:07.320\nSo it's also your traditional run\nline at your search functionality.\n\n570\n00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:11.820\nInside of your operating system and then\nit goes a step further because if you want\n\n571\n00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:17.410\nto ask Cortana, the digital assistant\nin Windows, you can set that up.\n\n572\n00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:20.410\nKeep in mind that there are some setting\nyou have to through to configure Cortana.\n\n573\n00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:22.320\nWe'll look through Cortana\nin a later episode, but\n\n574\n00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:26.360\nwe do want to mention it here because\nit's a major feature of the task bar.\n\n575\n00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:29.090\nNow we have down here across the bottom,\nthese are what are called\n\n576\n00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:33.900\nquick launch icons, and they give me\none-click access to some common locations.\n\n577\n00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:37.110\nThey do have some defaults here\nthat they start with, for instance,\n\n578\n00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:40.290\nlike File Explorer,\nit's been on the task bar\n\n579\n00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:43.530\neven back when it was called\nWindows Explorer for a very long time.\n\n580\n00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:47.330\nNow does that mean that I have to keep\nfile explorer, if it starts out that way.\n\n581\n00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:50.310\nDo I have to keep file\nexplorer on my task bar.\n\n582\n00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:53.050\nWell, no I can right click\non any of this icons and\n\n583\n00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:56.190\nyou get some options including\nunpinning it from the task bar.\n\n584\n00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:58.430\nAnd there you go, it goes away.\n\n585\n00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:02.150\nNow keep in mind as well,\nyou can also go to your start menu and\n\n586\n00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:04.890\nanything that you wanna\nput on the taskbar.\n\n587\n00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:05.970\nYou can right click on it.\n\n588\n00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:09.750\nAnd rather than choosing Pin to Start,\nlike we did earlier, you choose More, and\n\n589\n00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:11.570\nyou can pin it to the taskbar there.\n\n590\n00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:14.710\nAnd now I can see that my alarm and\nclock is on the taskbar, and\n\n591\n00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:16.480\nI have that one click access to it.\n\n592\n00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.470\nAnd by the way, this is a modern UI app.\n\n593\n00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:21.070\nNotice how it isn't full screen anymore.\n\n594\n00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:25.290\nThat's one of the good things there,\nabout those modern UI apps.\n\n595\n00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:29.870\nNow, my head right now is\ncovering it up this is like big,\n\n596\n00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:33.650\nbig thing on the desktop and that's\nsomething called the notification area.\n\n597\n00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:35.810\nAnd if I can figure out\nwhere my mouse went.\n\n598\n00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:37.830\nThere we go.\n\n599\n00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:40.220\nWe can get here, there we go.\n\n600\n00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.440\nNotice the notification area here.\n\n601\n00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:46.230\nYou've got some, again I wanna\nsay kinda quick launch icons, but\n\n602\n00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:48.650\nthese are real time icons.\n\n603\n00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:52.440\nThey change depending on certain\nhappenings on your computer.\n\n604\n00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.040\nFor instance I don't have\nany network access here.\n\n605\n00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.080\nThis is my network monitor.\n\n606\n00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.470\nIn fact, I can right-click on that and\nopen up network and sharing center.\n\n607\n00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:02.040\nYou also have hidden icons here.\n\n608\n00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.930\nI can choose the up arrow and\nit gives me the,\n\n609\n00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:08.190\nit collapses down if you have an access\nof these quick launch icons here.\n\n610\n00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:09.160\nIn your notification area.\n\n611\n00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:12.050\nYou can see,\nthere's my safely remove my hardware.\n\n612\n00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:15.590\nAnd there's my Windows Defender, as well.\n\n613\n00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:17.950\nCloud if I've got one\ndrive if I'm signed in and\n\n614\n00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:20.480\nthen you can see things\nlike your Bluetooth device.\n\n615\n00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.430\nI also got the date and time, and\nas well the new Action Center.\n\n616\n00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:30.670\nNow this interesting, and it looks like\nI adjusted the size of the icons here.\n\n617\n00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:31.580\n&gt;&gt; You went a little crazy with that.\n\n618\n00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:32.440\n&gt;&gt; Yes that's okay.\n\n619\n00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:36.000\nWell, everybody needs to\nbe able to view these.\n\n620\n00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.170\n&gt;&gt; It's Godzilla's computer.\n\n621\n00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:38.100\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n622\n00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:39.542\nWe can see these from space.\n\n623\n00:30:39.542 --> 00:30:42.378\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The other thing that's really\n\n624\n00:30:42.378 --> 00:30:44.960\ncool about the Windows task bar today.\n\n625\n00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:49.040\nIt's something that's been around in other\noperating systems like I believe Linux had\n\n626\n00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.160\nthis for a while.\n\n627\n00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:53.670\nHave you ever wanted to have\nwindows open on one desktop, and\n\n628\n00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:56.260\nthen maybe go to another desktop and\nhave other windows open?\n\n629\n00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:57.350\nHow do we do that?\n\n630\n00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:58.340\n&gt;&gt; You buy multiple monitors.\n\n631\n00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:59.381\n&gt;&gt; We get multiple monitors, right?\n\n632\n00:30:59.381 --> 00:31:00.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now I can do that.\n\n633\n00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:03.340\nWell, Windows does have a way\nthat you can almost do that\n\n634\n00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:06.750\nhere without having multiple monitors, and\nyou can do this with multiple monitors and\n\n635\n00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:10.720\nthen it goes even more complex, but\nthat is something known as the Task View.\n\n636\n00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.950\nThis is something new to Windows 10.\n\n637\n00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:15.490\nAnd this gives me the ability\nto have more than one desktop.\n\n638\n00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:20.290\nSo for instance,\nif I happen to have command prompt\n\n639\n00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:24.420\nopen on one and I decide that you know\nwhat, I wanna leave that open but\n\n640\n00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:26.210\nI wanna have some other applications open.\n\n641\n00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:29.760\nWell you can go to task view, and\nyou can create multiple desktops.\n\n642\n00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.430\nNow you didn't see that I actually\nhave another desktop created,\n\n643\n00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:34.580\nI created it right before\nwe started the show.\n\n644\n00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:38.560\nBut I can choose that desktop there and\nnow I've got File Explorer open and I've\n\n645\n00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:42.790\ngot PowerShell open and I can switch in\nand out of these two different desktops.\n\n646\n00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:43.360\nAnd if I decide,\n\n647\n00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.890\nyou know what, I'm done with that desktop,\nI can always cancel it out.\n\n648\n00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:50.070\nRight and then its gone and\nthen I can come back to, it\n\n649\n00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:54.020\nbasically takes all of those applications\nand puts them on single desktop.\n\n650\n00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:58.360\nSo that's really, really good to have\nthe one gem that is on the taskbar that's\n\n651\n00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:02.240\nkind of hidden and people forget\nabout it because its been since XP\n\n652\n00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:05.390\nsince we have a little Window all\nthe way to the right of the taskbar.\n\n653\n00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:09.730\nLet me go ahead and show you my hand is\nkind of covering it up but you really\n\n654\n00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:14.120\ncan't see it too well but Dan, can you\nsee that little black bar right there?\n\n655\n00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:15.240\n&gt;&gt; That little bar, yeah.\n\n656\n00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:19.210\n&gt;&gt; Little bar is hiding over there,\nthat's the show desktop option.\n\n657\n00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:21.500\nAnd some people don't\nknow that that's there.\n\n658\n00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:26.360\nAnd you can get right to your desktop if\nyou want to just by clicking that bar, so\n\n659\n00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.200\nlot of little hidden gems in here.\n\n660\n00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:32.110\nAnd you can really use this desktop\ninterface to make yourself productive.\n\n661\n00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:34.400\nKeep in mind it's called pc for a reason.\n\n662\n00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.350\nPersonal computing.\n\n663\n00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:38.010\nYou personalize it to your\ncomputing experience and\n\n664\n00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:40.525\nyou can make it a lot better and\na lot more enjoyable for you.\n\n665\n00:32:40.525 --> 00:32:43.740\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, a lot of great\ninsight on these desktop settings.\n\n666\n00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:44.880\nWe appreciate that.\n\n667\n00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:45.970\nThanks for stopping by, but\n\n668\n00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:49.340\nit does look like we have come to the end\nof the time for this here episode.\n\n669\n00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:50.810\nWe thank you guys for watching.\n\n670\n00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:52.720\nBut signing off for ITPRO.TV.\n\n671\n00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:53.939\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n672\n00:32:53.939 --> 00:32:54.748\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n673\n00:32:54.748 --> 00:32:56.286\n&gt;&gt; Will see you next time.\n\n674\n00:32:56.286 --> 00:33:03.213\n&gt;&gt;

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:10.542 --> 00:00:14.181\n&gt;&gt; All right,\ngreetings our faithful viewers.\n\n4\n00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:16.449\nAnd welcome to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.640\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n6\n00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.960\nAnd in today's episode, that's right,\nmore on our MTA series.\n\n7\n00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.889\nMore of your favorite that's the 98 349.\n\n8\n00:00:24.889 --> 00:00:28.694\nJoining us back in the studio again\nto give us a little information,\n\n9\n00:00:28.694 --> 00:00:31.790\na little more knowledge in\nthat area is Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:32.550\nWes, welcome back.\n\n11\n00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.170\nHow's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.265\n&gt;&gt; It's going great and\ngreat to be back here.\n\n13\n00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:37.693\nThat's right, we're going to be looking\nat some additional applications.\n\n14\n00:00:37.693 --> 00:00:42.382\nAnd tools and in this one, the objective\nis configure native applications and\n\n15\n00:00:42.382 --> 00:00:42.885\ntools.\n\n16\n00:00:42.885 --> 00:00:44.105\nNow you might be saying, well, Wes,\n\n17\n00:00:44.105 --> 00:00:46.615\ndidn't you show us some administrative\ntools in another episode?\n\n18\n00:00:46.615 --> 00:00:47.670\nWe did.\n\n19\n00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.104\nI went ahead and prefaced that one with,\njust about anything you use\n\n20\n00:00:51.104 --> 00:00:54.899\ninside of Windows might just be called\nan administrative utility or tool or\n\n21\n00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:55.576\nsomething.\n\n22\n00:00:55.576 --> 00:00:57.965\n&gt;&gt; Why don't they just call Windows an\nadministrative tool and be done with it?\n\n23\n00:00:57.965 --> 00:00:59.744\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And in all seriousness,\n\n24\n00:00:59.744 --> 00:01:02.747\nwhat we're going to be looking at\nare some of the accessories that\n\n25\n00:01:02.747 --> 00:01:06.040\nare built into WIndows, and\nthey're not administrative tools.\n\n26\n00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.490\nWe will be looking at things\nlike the new Edge browser.\n\n27\n00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.120\nAs well as,\nwhat else do we got on tap today here?\n\n28\n00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.730\nWe're gonna look a little bit at Cortana,\nas well.\n\n29\n00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.985\nSo then we're gonna be basically doubling\nback around to some things that you will\n\n30\n00:01:17.985 --> 00:01:21.745\nuse in your administrative endeavors\ninside of your Windows environment.\n\n31\n00:01:21.745 --> 00:01:24.015\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's just dive into accessories.\n\n32\n00:01:24.015 --> 00:01:27.018\nNow these accessories have been\nbuilt into windows for a while here,\n\n33\n00:01:27.018 --> 00:01:27.859\nsome of them have.\n\n34\n00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:31.545\nAnd let's go ahead and\nshow you what I am talking about now.\n\n35\n00:01:31.545 --> 00:01:34.400\nI'll go ahead and show you that little\nshortcut that I was using in the Start\n\n36\n00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.400\nmenu when we described that\nin a previous episode.\n\n37\n00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.330\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nuse the Start menu here.\n\n38\n00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.609\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nhit the little pound icon, in my case.\n\n39\n00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:46.940\nIt's just because that's what\nthis alphabetized itself under.\n\n40\n00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.580\nAnd then we're gonna scroll down to W,\nright?\n\n41\n00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.960\nAnd then that's gonna take us to Windows\nAccessories, here, in the Start menu.\n\n42\n00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.430\nAll right, now,\nWindows Accessories in the Start Menu.\n\n43\n00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.160\nIf you look, we have a whole bunch\nof different things that you can do,\n\n44\n00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.030\nall right.\n\n45\n00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.670\nAnd it's not really necessary to go\nthrough every individual one, but\n\n46\n00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.778\nwe will just talk about the common\nones here that you can see.\n\n47\n00:02:08.778 --> 00:02:12.552\nInternet Explorer, right, Internet\nExplorer has been around for a while and\n\n48\n00:02:12.552 --> 00:02:14.107\nit is still heavily supported.\n\n49\n00:02:14.107 --> 00:02:18.415\nSo if you are one of those ones that likes\nto get onboard with the Microsoft Edge,\n\n50\n00:02:18.415 --> 00:02:19.521\nthe newer browser.\n\n51\n00:02:19.521 --> 00:02:23.107\nKeep in mind that they did keep IE in\nhere because it still has a lot of\n\n52\n00:02:23.107 --> 00:02:24.520\ncompatibility.\n\n53\n00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.591\nWhere Edge they're really trying for\nsecurity reasons to lock it down.\n\n54\n00:02:26.591 --> 00:02:30.963\nSo it's compatibility will be\nslow moving as they make sure and\n\n55\n00:02:30.963 --> 00:02:32.868\ntry to keep it very secure.\n\n56\n00:02:32.868 --> 00:02:35.980\nNow we do have some other things in here,\nNotepad.\n\n57\n00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.120\nI'm sure everybody's used Notepad once,\nat least, maybe, myself,\n\n58\n00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.320\nI would say I probably use it once or\ntwice a day.\n\n59\n00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.150\nVery easy, basic text editor.\n\n60\n00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.412\nDoesn't give you any processing ability.\n\n61\n00:02:47.412 --> 00:02:50.648\nAlmost no processing abilities at all, but\n\n62\n00:02:50.648 --> 00:02:55.900\nif you launch it up you do have\nthe ability to just do basic text editing.\n\n63\n00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.780\nAnd when I say basic text editing,\nI do mean basic like this is my text.\n\n64\n00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.750\nAnd if I wanted to,\n\n65\n00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.090\nI could change the format a little\nbit by modifying fonts, right.\n\n66\n00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.580\nSo, nothing really big there,\nnothing really too difficult at all.\n\n67\n00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.889\nKeep in mind that it is there, and\nyou do have the ability to use it as well.\n\n68\n00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:16.110\n&gt;&gt; It's great for reviewing things like,\nread me files, or\n\n69\n00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.380\nmaking modifications to a configuration\nfile that's in text format.\n\n70\n00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.300\nThere's a lot of great reasons that you\nwould wanna use that basic text editor.\n\n71\n00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.560\nLike Wes said, we use it all the time,\nmaybe once, twice, three times a day.\n\n72\n00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.370\nBecause we're always\nediting stuff like that.\n\n73\n00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.240\nIt's very, very good for that purpose.\n\n74\n00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know one of the things\nthat I use it for too is copy and\n\n75\n00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.451\npasting like little tidbits\nwhen I'm studying on something.\n\n76\n00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:40.670\nMaybe a new feature in Windows and\nI'm not quite sure about it.\n\n77\n00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.730\nJust copy it off of the website, maybe\nTechNet, throw it into a text document or\n\n78\n00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.930\nNotepad here, and then save it and\nyou can find it later.\n\n79\n00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.520\nOne of the great things is,\nis it creates basic TXT documents.\n\n80\n00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.670\nSo Dan is a heavy Linux user.\n\n81\n00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.001\nSo if I had a TXT file I was creating\nin Notepad and I emailed it to him and\n\n82\n00:03:59.001 --> 00:04:02.362\nhe downloaded it to his Linux Box,\nhe can open it up and\n\n83\n00:04:02.362 --> 00:04:06.430\nhe can read it again because it's\njust very basic text editing.\n\n84\n00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.806\nUnlike something which you might use\nif you use a word processor, right,\n\n85\n00:04:09.806 --> 00:04:13.511\nyou might have compatibility issues\nbetween the different word processors that\n\n86\n00:04:13.511 --> 00:04:15.310\nare out there and so there you have it.\n\n87\n00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.510\nIt's a nice convenient way and it is\nkind of a basic standard format there.\n\n88\n00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.410\nSo it can be open on a lot\nof different platforms.\n\n89\n00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.040\nNow the next thing that we have is Paint.\n\n90\n00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.280\nThere's another one that\nI probably use a lot.\n\n91\n00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.090\nNow, I'm not artistic in any way but,\n\n92\n00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.900\nI do take screenshots from time to time\nand then paint paste them to Paint.\n\n93\n00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.380\nSo again Paint is, we're not looking\nat things like an Adobe product\n\n94\n00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.100\nwhere we can do all these amazing\ntransformations or anything like that.\n\n95\n00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.420\nBut at least you do have\nthe ability to create\n\n96\n00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.390\nbasic things like graphic documents\nlike bitmap images and stuff like that.\n\n97\n00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.540\nLike I said, for\nme I might do something like this.\n\n98\n00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.158\nLet's go ahead and\n\n99\n00:04:56.158 --> 00:04:58.642\nthere's the Snipping Tool and we're\ngonna get to that one here in a second.\n\n100\n00:04:58.642 --> 00:05:01.146\nBut I can go-\n&gt;&gt; I think we just did.\n\n101\n00:05:01.146 --> 00:05:02.255\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n102\n00:05:02.255 --> 00:05:04.160\nwe'll talk about this one coming up.\n\n103\n00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.630\nBut if I wanted to I could take\na real quick snippet of this, right.\n\n104\n00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.000\nAnd then, if I decided that I\nwanted to maybe save that snippet,\n\n105\n00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.210\nwe'll save it to the desktop, and\nwe'll just call it, it's a PNG file here.\n\n106\n00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.000\nAnd if I wanted to then I could\nturn around and I could edit it.\n\n107\n00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.320\nAnd you'll notice that when I edit it,\nI edit it inside of Paint.\n\n108\n00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.300\nSo it is kind of like a default app if\nyou don't have other image applications,\n\n109\n00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.390\ngraphics applications installed.\n\n110\n00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:33.402\nSo it does come in handy.\n\n111\n00:05:33.402 --> 00:05:35.401\nIt launches by default there.\n\n112\n00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:39.109\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and it's great because the Snippet\ntool does have some annotation features\n\n113\n00:05:39.109 --> 00:05:39.880\nwhich is great.\n\n114\n00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.202\nI love the Snippet tool it's one of\nthe best things that they've put into\n\n115\n00:05:42.202 --> 00:05:43.245\nthe Windows operating system.\n\n116\n00:05:43.245 --> 00:05:49.898\nBut you don't get as much usability,\nability as you get with Paint.\n\n117\n00:05:49.898 --> 00:05:53.274\nYou can annotate all over the place,\nuse the different colors.\n\n118\n00:05:53.274 --> 00:05:56.120\nI've done a ton of stuff for\nwriting up procedures,\n\n119\n00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.090\npointing to important pieces of screenshot\nthat I need my end user to be able to see.\n\n120\n00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.235\nI know they seem like kid's tools, right.\n\n121\n00:06:03.235 --> 00:06:06.890\nWe've got Notepad,\nit just types text, whoop-de-doo.\n\n122\n00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.380\nYou've got a Paint program,\nI can draw hearts and whatever.\n\n123\n00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.380\nBut they do have more\npowerful applications,\n\n124\n00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.150\nand you just gotta be creative\nin the way that you use them.\n\n125\n00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.900\n&gt;&gt; Right, definitely.\n\n126\n00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.410\nAnd one of the things, too,\nsince I have launched up Snipping Tool.\n\n127\n00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.810\nThey brought a new feature in\nit that I really, really like.\n\n128\n00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.910\nAnd I'm gonna bring\nthe Snipping Tool back.\n\n129\n00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:27.980\nLet's say, for instance, and\n\n130\n00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.610\nwe'll bring a couple of these utilities\nthat we've been talking about.\n\n131\n00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.320\nI'm gonna bring up Internet Explorer.\n\n132\n00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.100\nAnd let me go ahead and\naccept the defaults here, say OK.\n\n133\n00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.080\nAnd I'm going to close any little\nextra tabs that's coming up.\n\n134\n00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.630\nSo, maybe I wanted to show somebody,\nmaybe Dan called up and said, hey,\n\n135\n00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:45.260\nyou know, Wes.\n\n136\n00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.070\nI need you to create a document real quick\nor create a screenshot that shows people\n\n137\n00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.943\nhow to get to Internet Options\ninside of Internet Explorer.\n\n138\n00:06:51.943 --> 00:06:53.270\nThat's all I need you to do.\n\n139\n00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.490\nJust show them where Internet Options are.\n\n140\n00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.983\nAll right, so\nif I bring up the Snipping Tool again.\n\n141\n00:06:57.983 --> 00:07:01.657\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and just pin\nthis to the task bar for a second,\n\n142\n00:07:01.657 --> 00:07:02.572\nso I can find it.\n\n143\n00:07:02.572 --> 00:07:05.240\nAnd I wanna use the Snipping Tool, right?\n\n144\n00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.680\nSo I choose New.\n\n145\n00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.040\nAnd now I'm gonna go up here and\nhit, wait.\n\n146\n00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.150\nThat's not working, right?\n\n147\n00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.690\nSo, okay,\nmaybe I need to use the drop down menu.\n\n148\n00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:14.662\nAnd now I'll go to the Snipping Tool.\n\n149\n00:07:14.662 --> 00:07:18.068\nAnd well wait, I'm having an issue here.\n\n150\n00:07:18.068 --> 00:07:21.400\nI can't seem to keep that menu open\nwhen I'm using the Snipping Tool.\n\n151\n00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.590\nWell in Windows 10 they brought\nin what's known as a delay.\n\n152\n00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.170\nAnd I think this is excellent.\n\n153\n00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.860\nI really wish I would have had this for\nsome of the documentation,\n\n154\n00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.950\nlike Dan was saying,\nthat I've made as well.\n\n155\n00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.630\nWhere you have to show\nsomebody how to do something.\n\n156\n00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.670\nBut every time you want\nto get to the sub menus,\n\n157\n00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.690\nit closed before you had the chance\nto actually take a screenshot of it.\n\n158\n00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:42.060\nSo now what I could do is I could say,\nokay do a three second delay, right.\n\n159\n00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.342\nAnd I could say New, and I could come\nup here and I could wait three seconds.\n\n160\n00:07:45.342 --> 00:07:49.946\nAnd now I have the ability to\nsay there's Internet Options.\n\n161\n00:07:49.946 --> 00:07:53.780\nNotice how the sub menu didn't go away\nbecause of the fact that it did have\n\n162\n00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.070\na little bit of that delay in there.\n\n163\n00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.848\nSo, good thing to have.\n\n164\n00:07:55.848 --> 00:07:58.040\nI'm not gonna save any of these.\n\n165\n00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.565\nIn fact I'll say no don't know me again.\n\n166\n00:08:00.565 --> 00:08:02.454\n&gt;&gt; And James makes a good point in this.\n\n167\n00:08:02.454 --> 00:08:06.358\nYou don't have to actually\nsave your work to use it.\n\n168\n00:08:06.358 --> 00:08:08.768\nIf I've got a body of an email up,\nI can directly just copy and\n\n169\n00:08:08.768 --> 00:08:10.536\npaste that right into\nthe body of the email.\n\n170\n00:08:10.536 --> 00:08:11.640\nI don't have to save that image.\n\n171\n00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.480\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n172\n00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.980\n&gt;&gt; And fill up my hard drive\nwith a bunch of snippets and\n\n173\n00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.330\nthen have to clean that up.\n\n174\n00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.030\nIt's really nice because you drop it\nright into something, and you're done.\n\n175\n00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.158\nClose out snippet, and it's done.\n\n176\n00:08:20.158 --> 00:08:21.054\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely.\n\n177\n00:08:21.054 --> 00:08:24.460\nSo great comments out there\nin the chat room for sure.\n\n178\n00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:25.610\nAnd that is absolutely right.\n\n179\n00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.620\nIt makes it really easy.\n\n180\n00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:31.130\nNow, since we're talking about things\nlike creating step-by-step documentation.\n\n181\n00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:32.670\nYou know what?\nThey've got another one in here in\n\n182\n00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:35.440\nthe accessories and if you haven't\nseen it, you need to get on board and\n\n183\n00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.470\nyou need to learn this utility.\n\n184\n00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:39.810\nI really wish they would of\nhad this a few years ago and\n\n185\n00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:41.270\nthat's something known as the PSR.\n\n186\n00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.520\nYes, another acronym for\n\n187\n00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:46.590\nyou cuz we are never short of\nalphabet soup here at ITProTV.\n\n188\n00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:48.500\nThat is the Problem Step Recorder.\n\n189\n00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.920\nNow let me show you another thing\nthat we could have done if, well,\n\n190\n00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.330\nwe had the Problem Step Recorder.\n\n191\n00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.030\nSo this is also Windows Accessories.\n\n192\n00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:59.370\nI'm just using the alphabet, here,\nthe letters there to cycle down through to\n\n193\n00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:03.490\nWindows Accessories a little faster,\nand there's the Problem Step Recorder.\n\n194\n00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.300\nAnd wow!\nDoesn't that look amazing, Dan,\n\n195\n00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.930\nthat looks like probably the best piece\nof software you've seen in your life.\n\n196\n00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:10.570\nI know, I'm joking, I'm kidding, right?\n\n197\n00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:13.120\nBut this is a very powerful little tool.\n\n198\n00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.580\nLet me show you what it can do.\n\n199\n00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.350\nMaybe I needed to show somebody how\nto delete their history, right?\n\n200\n00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.702\nNow, we could use the snipping tool,\nand I could go in and\n\n201\n00:09:20.702 --> 00:09:23.840\ntake little snippets of every single\nlittle piece that I'm doing, right?\n\n202\n00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.202\nAnd then, with one of our\ncomments as well, sit there and\n\n203\n00:09:27.202 --> 00:09:30.605\npaste it into an email and\nsend that email out.\n\n204\n00:09:30.605 --> 00:09:31.860\nOr I can do something a little different.\n\n205\n00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.950\nFor instance, I could start a recording.\n\n206\n00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:37.718\nAll right, so now we're recording here,\nand I could say, okay,\n\n207\n00:09:37.718 --> 00:09:42.633\nyou're gonna push the gear icon, you're\ngonna scroll down to Internet Options, and\n\n208\n00:09:42.633 --> 00:09:44.607\nright here is your Delete button.\n\n209\n00:09:44.607 --> 00:09:48.494\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nchoose Delete, Delete again, right?\n\n210\n00:09:48.494 --> 00:09:51.800\nAnd you don't have to really worry\nabout what I'm doing here, right?\n\n211\n00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.437\nI'm choosing all these options,\nI say Delete, I say OK,\n\n212\n00:09:55.437 --> 00:09:58.778\nI've just captured,\nwhen I choose Stop Recording,\n\n213\n00:09:58.778 --> 00:10:03.690\nI've just captured all the steps that\nit took to clear the browsing history.\n\n214\n00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:04.920\nAnd what can I do?\n\n215\n00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.810\nI can save this, well, it's already saved\nto a file, well I can save it up here, but\n\n216\n00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:10.420\nnotice what it shows me.\n\n217\n00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:15.270\nIt shows us that he went\nup to the gear icon, right?\n\n218\n00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:19.880\nAnd if I scroll down, here's another\nscreenshot, says the next step was.\n\n219\n00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.220\nOops, Internet options.\n\n220\n00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.060\nSorry about that, guys.\n\n221\n00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:28.610\nAnd I now have every one of\nthe step-by-steps that it took for\n\n222\n00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:31.860\nme to clear my browsing history.\n\n223\n00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:36.680\nI can save this as a file, and I can turn\naround and I can email it to somebody, and\n\n224\n00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.830\nthey have the step-by-steps of what they\nneed to do, in order, well in this case,\n\n225\n00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.580\nto clear their history\ninside of the browser.\n\n226\n00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.550\nNow, they also, and\nlet me go ahead and scroll down.\n\n227\n00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.410\nIt also gives them text information.\n\n228\n00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:51.980\nTextual step-by-steps that\nthey could follow as well.\n\n229\n00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.810\nMaybe they don't know exactly\nwhat your clicking on,\n\n230\n00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.110\nbecause the green box doesn't\nhighlight it precisely.\n\n231\n00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.640\nWell, that's okay.\n\n232\n00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.830\nYou can compare it with\nthe steps at the bottom here.\n\n233\n00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:01.970\nAnd you know exactly where you're going.\n\n234\n00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:06.114\nSo I could, like I said,\nI could save this document here, and\n\n235\n00:11:06.114 --> 00:11:08.765\nI could say, I don't know, history.\n\n236\n00:11:11.558 --> 00:11:13.290\nClear, right?\n\n237\n00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:16.030\nWe save this to the desktop here so\nWes can find it again.\n\n238\n00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:24.980\nAnd now I have a nice little ZIP file with\nthat Problem Step Recorder document in it.\n\n239\n00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.330\nSo, nice handy,\n\n240\n00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:31.918\nhandy little accessory that is built\ninto our Windows operating system.\n\n241\n00:11:31.918 --> 00:11:34.380\nNow there's a ton of\nother ones in theirs too.\n\n242\n00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:39.440\nFor instance, there's like a,\na Remote Desktop is in here as well.\n\n243\n00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.623\n&gt;&gt; No one ever uses that though, right?\n\n244\n00:11:41.623 --> 00:11:42.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n245\n00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:44.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Dan means that joking.\n\n246\n00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:46.297\n&gt;&gt; That's facetiousness.\n&gt;&gt; That's one of the most important\n\n247\n00:11:46.297 --> 00:11:50.020\nremoting technologies that\nyou'll use in Windows.\n\n248\n00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:54.420\nI'm not gonna go into this too much\nhere because Remote Desktop Connection,\n\n249\n00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:57.550\nit's such a powerful piece of software and\nit does take some configuration.\n\n250\n00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.050\nThat we're gonna go ahead and\nput it in its own episode, so\n\n251\n00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:03.090\nthat you can have a more thorough\nunderstanding of what it is.\n\n252\n00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:05.080\nRather than me,\njust like the Problem Step Recorder,\n\n253\n00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.130\nkinda showing you an easy step-by-step.\n\n254\n00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.310\nSo, Remote Desktop's in there.\n\n255\n00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:12.150\nYou got the media player, and\n\n256\n00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:17.240\neverybody in the world uses an XPS Viewer,\njust kidding, and WordPad.\n\n257\n00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:22.310\nWordPad creates things like rich\ntext file, RTF files, if you will.\n\n258\n00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:25.970\nAnd these files have a limited\namount of word processing,\n\n259\n00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:28.580\na little bit of formatting in them,\nnot much but there you go.\n\n260\n00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:32.400\nSo accessories, Dan, I don't know that\nthey're call any one or the other out.\n\n261\n00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.820\nBe aware of them for the exam.\n\n262\n00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.460\nJust kinda know what they do.\n\n263\n00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.760\nIf you haven't used them before,\njust open them up, play around with them.\n\n264\n00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:39.810\nWhat's the worst case scenario?\n\n265\n00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:44.280\nYou create a paint document, that well,\nlooks like my artistic abilities.\n\n266\n00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.537\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's not gonna be anything that hurts\n\n267\n00:12:46.537 --> 00:12:49.093\nyou, it can only get you more\nfamiliar with the operating system.\n\n268\n00:12:49.093 --> 00:12:52.155\n&gt;&gt; That's right, don't ever be afraid\nto play with whatever they give you\n\n269\n00:12:52.155 --> 00:12:53.900\ninside of your operating system.\n\n270\n00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.120\nYou paid for the whole thing,\nyou might as well use it, right?\n\n271\n00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.700\nThat being said, talking about paying for\nthe whole thing, you also get bundled in.\n\n272\n00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:05.490\nIf you act now, the new flagship Web\nbrowser that Microsoft has developed.\n\n273\n00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:08.590\nThat's right, Internet Explorer's\nstarting to become a thing of the past,\n\n274\n00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:10.287\nnow we're on the Edge, right?\n\n275\n00:13:10.287 --> 00:13:14.060\nNow Wes, you're gonna explain how the Edge\nis different than Internet Explorer and\n\n276\n00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.840\nwhy we might wanna not use it, or use it?\n\n277\n00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.120\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, well,\n\n278\n00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:22.920\nwhat he's kind of alluding to is that it\nis kind of a, it's still a baby, right?\n\n279\n00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.070\nIt's still growing, right?\n\n280\n00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:24.810\n&gt;&gt; In it's infancy.\n\n281\n00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:26.540\n&gt;&gt; That's right, it hasn't matured yet.\n\n282\n00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:30.700\nAnd it's because, you've probably heard of\n\n283\n00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:34.540\nmaybe some of the rumors over the years\nabout Internet Explorer, right?\n\n284\n00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.120\nAnd Internet Explorer has\nvulnerabilities here and there,\n\n285\n00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.740\nI think it's an okay browser, it's in\nthe Windows systems that I've used.\n\n286\n00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:44.510\nI really haven't had too much of a problem\nwith it, however what they are trying to\n\n287\n00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:49.720\ndo is bring to the forefront\na more modern browser that is\n\n288\n00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.940\na little bit more secure, actually a lot\nof bit more secure than Internet Explorer.\n\n289\n00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.780\nSo, their still developing add-ins and\nstuff and\n\n290\n00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:02.470\ntheir really trying to lock this browser\ndown so that it is a lot more secure and\n\n291\n00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:06.360\nmore efficient to for\nmore of our modern interfaces that we use.\n\n292\n00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:11.410\nLet's go ahead and we'll fire up\nMicrosoft Edge here from the Taskbar.\n\n293\n00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.400\nAll right, so here is Edge.\n\n294\n00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:19.863\nEdge is very basic, it doesn't look\nlike a lot on the surface by any means,\n\n295\n00:14:19.863 --> 00:14:22.403\nbut let's kinda show you around.\n\n296\n00:14:22.403 --> 00:14:26.410\nAll right now, in the upper right hand\ncorner you have a couple of options here.\n\n297\n00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:30.008\nYou have a Reading List option, we'll talk\nabout that coming up here in a second.\n\n298\n00:14:30.008 --> 00:14:34.210\nI also have the ability to bookmark, add\nthings to favorites just like you can in\n\n299\n00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:36.990\nInternet Explorer and a lot of\nthe other common browsers out there.\n\n300\n00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:38.700\nThis isn't really anything new.\n\n301\n00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:42.465\nNow, this little, I don't know\nwhat you would call that there,\n\n302\n00:14:42.465 --> 00:14:43.950\nthat little list there is called the Hub.\n\n303\n00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:47.730\nAll right, and if I go to the Hub, this is\nwhere you see things like your Bookmarks,\n\n304\n00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:49.230\nor Favorites, if you will.\n\n305\n00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:52.880\nSomething known as your Reading List,\nyour History and Downloads, right?\n\n306\n00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.710\nSo you can see that I've obviously,\nsince I launched it up,\n\n307\n00:14:56.710 --> 00:15:00.480\nI visited ITProTV,\nthere's my History and Reading List.\n\n308\n00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.905\nNow Reading List is something that's\nnewer to your browser and you have\n\n309\n00:15:03.905 --> 00:15:07.461\nto find a website that actually supports\nit so let me kind of show you that.\n\n310\n00:15:07.461 --> 00:15:10.794\nI believe TechNet has a few\narticles up here that you can\n\n311\n00:15:10.794 --> 00:15:13.050\nactually get into the Reading List.\n\n312\n00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:16.882\nGuys, by the way, if you're studying\nout there for this exam and\n\n313\n00:15:16.882 --> 00:15:21.565\nyou need to find out any information\nabout Windows, definitely go to TechNet.\n\n314\n00:15:21.565 --> 00:15:28.774\nIt is a great, great place for\ninformation on Microsoft-based products.\n\n315\n00:15:28.774 --> 00:15:31.877\nAll right, let's see, Windows 10 and\nWindows 10 Mobile, and\n\n316\n00:15:31.877 --> 00:15:33.516\nmaybe What's new in Windows 10.\n\n317\n00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:36.762\nGotta find one here and I don't see,\n\n318\n00:15:36.762 --> 00:15:42.460\nit doesn't look like it's\nlighting up that bookmark there.\n\n319\n00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:43.070\nThere we go.\n\n320\n00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:44.900\nTook a second.\nYou gonna find some that are compatible\n\n321\n00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.150\nwith the reading list.\n\n322\n00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:48.380\nBut notice this has Reading view,\nall right.\n\n323\n00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.847\nWell, Reading view if I choose that,\n\n324\n00:15:49.847 --> 00:15:52.420\nit says let me take out all\nthe other distractions, right?\n\n325\n00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.510\nMaybe you're on a mobile device and\nyou just wanna scroll through and\n\n326\n00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:56.290\nI wanna see the textual information,\n\n327\n00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:58.300\nI don't care about all\nthese glitter graphics.\n\n328\n00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.040\nI don't care about all these\nother little links and\n\n329\n00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.020\nit says just show me what I need to read.\n\n330\n00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.287\nRight, well that's Reading view.\n\n331\n00:16:04.287 --> 00:16:06.963\nBut I could add this to my favorites and\nI could turn around and\n\n332\n00:16:06.963 --> 00:16:08.182\nadd it to the Reading List.\n\n333\n00:16:08.182 --> 00:16:11.364\nNow understand that what that does\nis it saves me the process of\n\n334\n00:16:11.364 --> 00:16:14.546\nHitting the reading list button,\nthen I know I have a series of\n\n335\n00:16:14.546 --> 00:16:18.523\narticles that are compatible with the\nreading view and I can get to them very,\n\n336\n00:16:18.523 --> 00:16:21.980\nvery quickly by going to the Hub and\nthen going to the Reading List.\n\n337\n00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:25.970\nAnd again, Favorites guys keep in mind\nFavorites are just like anything else, so\n\n338\n00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:30.410\nI could bookmark this in Favorites too\nif I want, and now it's in the Favorites\n\n339\n00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:32.710\nlist, right, these are no different\nthan your bookmarks, guys.\n\n340\n00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:37.030\nNow, here's something that's new to the,\nwell,\n\n341\n00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:41.190\nweb browsing experience in Windows and\nthat's something called WebNotes.\n\n342\n00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:43.480\nNow, this integrates with OneNote, and\n\n343\n00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:48.690\nthis gives me the ability that if I find\nsomething,right, that I want to mark,\n\n344\n00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:51.830\nI can go and say, okay,\nI really wanna know about ICD.\n\n345\n00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:53.841\nOkay, that line was absolutely horrible.\n\n346\n00:16:53.841 --> 00:16:55.929\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, apparently I can't stand it.\n\n347\n00:16:55.929 --> 00:16:59.433\nBut, you can see where I can make\na note and I can save it and\n\n348\n00:16:59.433 --> 00:17:03.230\nI can save it to my Favorites or\nI can integrate it to OneNote.\n\n349\n00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:07.040\nI don't have OneNote installed here, guys,\nand this certainly an episode on OneNote,\n\n350\n00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.280\nbut I can choose to put it\nin my Favorites, all right?\n\n351\n00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:14.520\nAnd when I save it, and then exit and\nthen let me go ahead and\n\n352\n00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:20.420\nlet me get back out of the reading view,\nwe'll go back to TechNet here, all right.\n\n353\n00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:24.480\nI decide, there was something on\nthis website that I'd seen and\n\n354\n00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.755\nI wanna get back to it but\nI can't remember what it is.\n\n355\n00:17:26.755 --> 00:17:33.058\nWhy go back up to my Favorites, All right,\nand notice that I have WebNotes,\n\n356\n00:17:33.058 --> 00:17:36.500\nI don't know if you guys can see that\nall right out there notice Web Note.\n\n357\n00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.718\nAnd I click on that and\nmy note has been saved, right.\n\n358\n00:17:39.718 --> 00:17:43.080\nSo, it saves it in my favorites and then\n\n359\n00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.350\nmy association if I wanted to explore out\nto OneNote I can, and that is really good,\n\n360\n00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:49.290\nespecially, I don't know if you got\na website we talked about copy,\n\n361\n00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:52.140\npasting that information,\nimagine leaving that information there and\n\n362\n00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:55.950\nhighlighting it, saving it and\njust going back to that same website.\n\n363\n00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.250\nA month later when you need\nto recall the information, so\n\n364\n00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:00.590\nthat's a good handy feature\nto have in your Web Browser.\n\n365\n00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:05.690\nAll right, now the other things that we\ncould do here is we could share as well.\n\n366\n00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:09.260\nI'm not gonna worry about the sharing\noption, but I will tell you,\n\n367\n00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.160\nlet's go ahead and\nhit this little ellipsis and\n\n368\n00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.660\nshow you the various settings\nthat are under here.\n\n369\n00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:18.090\nThis is where you start really\ngetting into being able to configure\n\n370\n00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:22.240\nMicrosoft Edge and you can see, if you\nhave things like a Miracast based device,\n\n371\n00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:28.840\nit's basically Wi–Fi Direct, this is\nMiracast is Microsoft's Wi-Fi Direct.\n\n372\n00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:32.230\nBasically, sending that to another\ndevice like a TV, if you will or\n\n373\n00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:34.120\nsomething that supports Miracast.\n\n374\n00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.450\nFind on Page, open with Internet Explorer,\nif you happen to find\n\n375\n00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:40.930\na website that you go to that isn't\ncompatible with Microsoft Edge.\n\n376\n00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:43.080\nYeah, that's fine,\njust open it with Internet Explorer.\n\n377\n00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.760\nDoes exactly what it sounds like, guys.\n\n378\n00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:50.070\nNow, one thing that's kind of really cool,\nI like this is developer options.\n\n379\n00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:52.308\nDeveloper options,\nnow I'm not a developer, guys,\n\n380\n00:18:52.308 --> 00:18:53.650\nI can spell C++ on a good day.\n\n381\n00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:55.840\nI don't know anything about code so\ndon't let me sit here and\n\n382\n00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:00.490\nmasquerade like I do, but\nI really like the performance tab on here.\n\n383\n00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:05.340\nI can take profiling and\nstart profiling the performance of my\n\n384\n00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:09.540\nmachine as it relates to this\nWeb Browser and then once we're done,\n\n385\n00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:12.250\nthis might not give us any information,\ncuz I haven't really done anything.\n\n386\n00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:16.070\nIt gives me a statistical breakdown\nto the visual through put and\n\n387\n00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:19.810\nframes per second, as well as things\nlike your CPU utilizations, so\n\n388\n00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:21.960\nto me that's really fascinating.\n\n389\n00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.240\nEven if you aren't a programmer,\neven if you don't code,\n\n390\n00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:27.610\nI'd really like to know what's\nthis browser doing to my hardware?\n\n391\n00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:31.700\nNow, that I do understand and\nthat's beneficial to me, all right.\n\n392\n00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:35.520\nWhether it's beneficial to you or\nnot again is really up to you.\n\n393\n00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.150\nSome of the other things that we have here\nthat we can do, we've got more settings\n\n394\n00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:41.810\nand I want to go all the way,\nscroll all the way down to settings and\n\n395\n00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:44.580\njust show you some of the basics\nthat you can do here.\n\n396\n00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:49.490\nSome of those basics that we can do for\ninstance, we can set things like themes if\n\n397\n00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:53.550\nwe want, we could choose light themes,\ndark themes depending on where you are at.\n\n398\n00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:56.400\nIf you are reading at night,\ndark theme might help you out a little bit\n\n399\n00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:00.530\nbetter to see that's up to you, or\nmaybe you just have a vision impairment.\n\n400\n00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:04.540\nMaybe that's how you need to read it\nall the time, so you can do that.\n\n401\n00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:07.230\nOpen Microsoft Edge with specific pages,\n\n402\n00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:11.830\nthis usually starts with the Edge\nstart page, a lot of starts there, but\n\n403\n00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:16.038\nthat's where it usually starts out\nis on the Microsoft Edge start page.\n\n404\n00:20:16.038 --> 00:20:18.140\nWhat I do is I changed that,\nin fact Dan and\n\n405\n00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.540\nI were just kinda talking about\nthis before we started the episode.\n\n406\n00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:24.220\nWe always set all of our browsers\nto ITProTV because we don't\n\n407\n00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.730\nknow what's going on in the background and\nwe don't want something coming\n\n408\n00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:30.130\nup across the Web Browser that's\ncontroversial whatever, right.\n\n409\n00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:33.820\nWe want you just to focus on\nthe technology, so I went ahead and\n\n410\n00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:37.750\nset specific page and when I did,\nI just had to type in ITProTV and\n\n411\n00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:41.920\nnow every time I open the Edge\nbrowser it opens to ITProTV.\n\n412\n00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.290\nAnd I also went a little bit farther,\n\n413\n00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:47.070\nI said when I open a new tab, I don't\nwant suggestions, give me a blank tab.\n\n414\n00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:50.310\nJust give me a blank page and\nI'll go ahead and type in what I want.\n\n415\n00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:54.700\nNow, your browsing history,\nyou've seen where in Internet Explorer,\n\n416\n00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.050\nI showed you about clearing\nthe browsing history.\n\n417\n00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:59.740\nWell, it was on demonstration\nof something else to PSR.\n\n418\n00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:02.500\nNow, you know how to do it, let me show\nyou how to clear your history inside of\n\n419\n00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.060\nthe Edge browser and it's right here.\n\n420\n00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:08.137\n&gt;&gt; Wes is a master at this [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n421\n00:21:08.137 --> 00:21:09.196\nDon't tell my secrets.\n\n422\n00:21:09.196 --> 00:21:10.126\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n423\n00:21:10.126 --> 00:21:12.070\n&gt;&gt; So, you clear your browsing history,\n\n424\n00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:16.350\nthe browsing history really is just\nlike a lot like if you've done this in\n\n425\n00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:20.180\nInternet Explore it's really no different,\nyou select what you wanna clear,\n\n426\n00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:23.950\nyou choose clear and then you can also say\njust like in Internet Explorer when I shut\n\n427\n00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:26.580\nthis down go ahead and\nclear out that browsing history.\n\n428\n00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.720\nSo, nothing really too special there then,\n\n429\n00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:32.690\nlet's see couple of other things\nthat we might wanna look at.\n\n430\n00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:36.280\nLet's go ahead real quick and\nlook at the advanced settings and\n\n431\n00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:40.230\nsome of the advanced settings are pop-up\nblockers that you can configure here and\n\n432\n00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:44.070\nI believe you can set things like if you\nwanna change your search engine it's\n\n433\n00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:47.570\nin the address bar, blocking cookies and\ndown at the bottom,\n\n434\n00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:50.180\nthis one's kind of important\ncuz it's a security setting.\n\n435\n00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:53.830\nThis is the Windows SmartScreen Filter and\nthis is where you can check to make sure\n\n436\n00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:57.100\nthat that Windows SmartScreen is on and\nrunning.\n\n437\n00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:00.980\nAnd that is a good thing to have just for\nyour own protection there.\n\n438\n00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:05.320\nSo, Edge Browser guys, if you are getting\nready for a certification endeavor,\n\n439\n00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:08.720\nI would suggest getting in here and\nworking with a little bit.\n\n440\n00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.540\nWe all have our favorite browsers,\n\n441\n00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:14.280\nyou might have seen some icons that\nare in my operating system right now.\n\n442\n00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:18.480\nBut don't hesitate to use it, especially\nif you are in a certification endeavor,\n\n443\n00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:22.050\ncuz the one thing I don't think they're\ngonna ask you about on a Windows exam is\n\n444\n00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:25.250\nsomething about Opera, or something\nabout Safari, or something about Chrome.\n\n445\n00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:28.500\nSo, definitely get in there and\nuse the Edge Browser.\n\n446\n00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:32.080\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely, we want to be on\nthe cusp of things, because guess what?\n\n447\n00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.520\nEdge is gonna have new iterations,\nit's gonna evolve,\n\n448\n00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:39.380\nit's gonna grow as a browser and maybe one\nday that'll be your favorite browser or\n\n449\n00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:42.640\nI definitely know that it's gonna be the\nbrowser on an exam so as you continue to\n\n450\n00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:46.620\ncertify and recertify gonna need to\nknow that guide just a little bit so.\n\n451\n00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:49.870\nDefinitely kick your feet around\nthere see what you can find out.\n\n452\n00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:53.000\nThe next thing we wanna though Wes is\nmove on to our good friend we have some\n\n453\n00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.730\ntime left on the clock and that is The P,\nthe personal digital assistant.\n\n454\n00:22:57.730 --> 00:22:58.642\nI know, it's an old term.\n\n455\n00:22:58.642 --> 00:22:59.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; From back in the day.\n\n456\n00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:03.910\nI think PDA, I think of the old\npalm pilots that they gave us, but\n\n457\n00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:05.530\nnow we have Cortana.\n\n458\n00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:06.120\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n459\n00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:10.270\nCortana and all the Halo fans\nout there are saying, \"We know.\n\n460\n00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:13.230\nWe've known it for\na while.\" [LAUGH] And, that's right.\n\n461\n00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:16.290\nThis is our digital personal assistant,\nor personal digital assistant.\n\n462\n00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:17.070\nJust like you said,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n463\n00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:19.440\n&gt;&gt; It's been a long time since\nwe've had to say PDA, right?\n\n464\n00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.030\nLet's go ahead and dive in and\nshow you a little bit about Cortana.\n\n465\n00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:24.500\nNow Cortana,\nif you're in a secure environment,\n\n466\n00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:28.340\nit might be a security risk because of\nthe location awareness that it does and\n\n467\n00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:31.190\nstoring information, so pay attention\nto whatever your security policy is.\n\n468\n00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:34.410\nIs the most likely, it isn't you that has\nto pay attention to this, it's probably\n\n469\n00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:38.590\nyour admins or if you're going on to being\nan admin, so just keep that in mind here.\n\n470\n00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:40.250\nLet's go ahead and show you Cortana.\n\n471\n00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:43.100\nNow, remember I did say that\nthe search bar is Cortana,\n\n472\n00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.850\nit's also like your traditional run line.\n\n473\n00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:46.788\nWell if I press this little halo.\n\n474\n00:23:46.788 --> 00:23:49.660\nDon't know where I came from, button here.\n\n475\n00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:53.590\nRight this is gonna bring up Cortana and\nCortana says, hey what can I do for you.\n\n476\n00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:57.386\nNow, let me go ahead and\nlet you know a couple of things here,\n\n477\n00:23:57.386 --> 00:24:02.450\nyou have to accept the privacy at the EOLA\nand accept the privacy settings here and\n\n478\n00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:05.449\nread the privacy agreement\nto turn on Cortana.\n\n479\n00:24:05.449 --> 00:24:09.076\nI've already done that here so we can\njust get right to showing you Cortana,\n\n480\n00:24:09.076 --> 00:24:11.128\nkeep in mind that you\ndo have to set that up.\n\n481\n00:24:11.128 --> 00:24:15.575\nThe other thing I'll let you know is that\nCortana works heavily and integrates with\n\n482\n00:24:15.575 --> 00:24:20.100\nyour Microsoft account, and you get\nthe full benefit of the Microsoft account.\n\n483\n00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:24.510\nI'm not logged in with\na Microsoft account here, so\n\n484\n00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:26.940\nyou're not gonna see some\nof those advanced benefits.\n\n485\n00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:31.140\nBut keep in mind that if you are gonna\nuse Cortana and you wanna get the best\n\n486\n00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:33.970\nexperience out of it, make sure that\nyou're logged into your Microsoft account.\n\n487\n00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:37.140\nNow, what are some of\nthe things that we can do here?\n\n488\n00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:40.680\nWell, some of the things that we can\ndo is for instance, searching for apps.\n\n489\n00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:44.540\nI can search for\ndocuments on my desktop here.\n\n490\n00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:46.620\nI can search the web, right?\n\n491\n00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:47.988\nBut that's not all I can do, right?\n\n492\n00:24:47.988 --> 00:24:51.590\nThere's a lot more that I can do\njust by asking different things.\n\n493\n00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:54.800\nNotice that it does require permissions.\n\n494\n00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.590\nSo pay attention to the permissions, and\n\n495\n00:24:56.590 --> 00:25:00.330\nif that's something that concerns you,\nyou might want to say maybe later, right?\n\n496\n00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:03.720\nFor now, I'm gonna say maybe later here,\nbut we do have some additional settings.\n\n497\n00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.835\nLike for instance, I can go to Settings.\n\n498\n00:25:05.835 --> 00:25:08.760\nAnd let me show you, I'm kind of doing\nthis because I'm used to doing this,\n\n499\n00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.670\nI'm doing that a little bit fast here.\n\n500\n00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:12.020\nThe expand option,\n\n501\n00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:15.340\njust like we were talking about\nin the traditional start menu.\n\n502\n00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:19.793\nWell on the Cortana menu, you also have\nan expand option and this is just for\n\n503\n00:25:19.793 --> 00:25:22.066\nCortana, then you choose Settings.\n\n504\n00:25:22.066 --> 00:25:24.350\nThe Setting's gear down\nhere at the bottom.\n\n505\n00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:27.415\nNotice that I have the ability\nto see permissions,\n\n506\n00:25:27.415 --> 00:25:29.706\nif I've given her the permission to.\n\n507\n00:25:29.706 --> 00:25:33.142\nShe can listen to my microphone and\ngather how I speak and\n\n508\n00:25:33.142 --> 00:25:36.060\nwhat my interests are, again Hey Cortana.\n\n509\n00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:40.270\nThat is something I can turn on that if\nI've got my built-in microphone on my\n\n510\n00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:41.110\ncomputer.\n\n511\n00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:44.477\nI can just say, Hey Cortana, and\nshe comes up, and she's waiting for\n\n512\n00:25:44.477 --> 00:25:46.319\nwhatever I'm gonna ask for, right?\n\n513\n00:25:46.319 --> 00:25:47.823\nAnd you can see the lock screen,\n\n514\n00:25:47.823 --> 00:25:50.350\ndo I wanna use Cortana even\nwhen the device is locked.\n\n515\n00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:54.690\nAnd you can see some various settings\nthat you can configure inside of Cortana.\n\n516\n00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:58.020\nYou can also do things like clearing\nyour device history as well.\n\n517\n00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:01.364\nSo Cortana is a nice feature to have,\nagain,\n\n518\n00:26:01.364 --> 00:26:04.539\nkeep in mind that how\nyou use it is up to you.\n\n519\n00:26:04.539 --> 00:26:07.721\nAnd to get the best utilization\nout of Cortana keep in\n\n520\n00:26:07.721 --> 00:26:12.850\nmind that you wanna have your own\nMicrosoft account logged in to use that.\n\n521\n00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:17.760\nSo Cortana, not really too difficult\nto use here, Don, and like I said,\n\n522\n00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:22.420\njust make sure that you pay attention\nto the permissions when it asks.\n\n523\n00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.980\nDon't just blindly click yes,\ngo ahead and read through there, so\n\n524\n00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:26.720\nyou know what you're saying yes to.\n\n525\n00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.160\nBecause if you are in an environment where\nyou need to be a little bit more secure\n\n526\n00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:35.180\nit might be something that causes you\na little bit of risk to your company.\n\n527\n00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:38.415\nAgain, I'll let your security\nteam deal with that one.\n\n528\n00:26:38.415 --> 00:26:40.888\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, always like to shock\nthe blame, don't you there, Wesley?\n\n529\n00:26:40.888 --> 00:26:41.652\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n530\n00:26:41.652 --> 00:26:43.578\n&gt;&gt; Well that being said,\nwe'll talk about shock and blame,\n\n531\n00:26:43.578 --> 00:26:45.120\nI like to shock the blame\nonto my own computer.\n\n532\n00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.770\nI always love to yell at it and\nsay, why are you doing this?\n\n533\n00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:50.813\nYou crazy little machine, I have to\nfigure it out and one of the places\n\n534\n00:26:50.813 --> 00:26:54.033\nto probably spend a little time with\nit trying to figure out when things.\n\n535\n00:26:54.033 --> 00:26:57.107\nI've worked with this utility\nwe're about to speak with,\n\n536\n00:26:57.107 --> 00:26:59.514\nwhen it comes to my\ncomputers having trouble.\n\n537\n00:26:59.514 --> 00:27:02.410\nWell my computer's running slow,\nwhat do I do?\n\n538\n00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:04.790\nFirst thing I run to is the MSConfig,\n\n539\n00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:07.810\nbecause it's gonna show me all\nthose lovely start up programs.\n\n540\n00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:11.650\nAnd I love that about that, it went\naway in one version of Windows, but\n\n541\n00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:13.910\nthey've brought it back,\ncuz they sell the power, people complain.\n\n542\n00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:16.416\nIt's definitely a misversion, and\nWes, you taught us that before but\n\n543\n00:27:16.416 --> 00:27:17.849\nyou're gonna go in a little more depth.\n\n544\n00:27:17.849 --> 00:27:18.980\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n545\n00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:23.305\nWe definitely wanna make sure\nthat we understand MSConfig.\n\n546\n00:27:23.305 --> 00:27:28.110\nMSConfig is basically a utility that you\nuse to ensure that you can configure,\n\n547\n00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:30.470\nyou can control your start up settings.\n\n548\n00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:33.250\nLet's go ahead and let's dive in here,\nand let's look at this a little bit.\n\n549\n00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:36.020\nSo there's a couple of different\nways that you can launch this.\n\n550\n00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:41.065\nIn a previous episode, we just basically\ntalked about system information.\n\n551\n00:27:41.065 --> 00:27:45.830\nExcuse me, I'm sorry, system\nconfiguration and administrative tools.\n\n552\n00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:49.440\nAnd then I also mentioned to know that\nyou can launch it by typing MSConfig.\n\n553\n00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.611\nThat's where we're gonna\nstay right here in MSConfig.\n\n554\n00:27:52.611 --> 00:27:55.570\nNow there are a few different\nthings that you can do right here.\n\n555\n00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:57.848\nFor instance,\nyou've got a General tab, and\n\n556\n00:27:57.848 --> 00:28:00.899\nthe General tab just controls\nhow the computer is gonna boot.\n\n557\n00:28:00.899 --> 00:28:02.807\nWhether it's going to do a normal startup,\n\n558\n00:28:02.807 --> 00:28:05.320\nwhether you're gonna do\na selective startup.\n\n559\n00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:08.745\nWhether you're gonna use the original\nboot configuration, the original BCD,\n\n560\n00:28:08.745 --> 00:28:10.822\nas it's called,\nthe Boot Configuration Data.\n\n561\n00:28:10.822 --> 00:28:14.015\nWe also have the boot tab,\nif you have multiple Windows Operating\n\n562\n00:28:14.015 --> 00:28:17.220\nsystems installed on a single machine,\nyou would see them here.\n\n563\n00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.173\nAnd you can see what currently the volt,\n\n564\n00:28:19.173 --> 00:28:20.100\nthe default-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n565\n00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.790\n&gt;&gt; Operating system is, and\n\n566\n00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:23.400\nyou can choose what the default is.\n\n567\n00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:27.255\nSo when you're presented with\na multi-operating system selection screen.\n\n568\n00:28:27.255 --> 00:28:30.881\nAnd you wanna choose maybe Windows 10\nPro over Windows 10 Enterprise, or\n\n569\n00:28:30.881 --> 00:28:33.530\nWindows 10 Home over\nWindows 10 Enterprise.\n\n570\n00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:38.500\nYou can rearrange it in the lineup, and\nthat changes that boot configuration data,\n\n571\n00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:42.090\nthat file that essentially\nthe Windows bootloader uses to know\n\n572\n00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:44.940\nhow to bootstrap the operating system.\n\n573\n00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:47.620\nWe also have things like Safe boot here,\nand let me just go ahead and\n\n574\n00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:48.900\nexplain these options.\n\n575\n00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:50.190\nThis is what safe mode is.\n\n576\n00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:52.937\nRemember, when Dan and\nI were kind of joking around and\n\n577\n00:28:52.937 --> 00:28:55.815\nwe talked in a previous episode\nabout display settings.\n\n578\n00:28:55.815 --> 00:28:59.091\nAnd that if you modified your display\nsettings and you set it to a resolution\n\n579\n00:28:59.091 --> 00:29:02.378\nthat the monitor didn't support,\nwell you couldn't see your computer.\n\n580\n00:29:02.378 --> 00:29:04.987\nYou couldn't work with your computer\nanymore, and you have to reboot it and\n\n581\n00:29:04.987 --> 00:29:05.733\nboot it in safe mode.\n\n582\n00:29:05.733 --> 00:29:08.025\nWell that's what you can do here,\nall right.\n\n583\n00:29:08.025 --> 00:29:10.596\nI can, inside of the operating system,\n\n584\n00:29:10.596 --> 00:29:15.359\nif I want to just start the operating\nsystem with the basic set of drivers and\n\n585\n00:29:15.359 --> 00:29:20.216\nservices that is needed to get the\noperating system started, I can do that.\n\n586\n00:29:20.216 --> 00:29:23.700\nAnd that's good for diagnostic purposes\nwhen you have a third party driver that\n\n587\n00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:24.955\nmight be causing problems.\n\n588\n00:29:24.955 --> 00:29:26.886\nOr an application that you have installed,\nand\n\n589\n00:29:26.886 --> 00:29:28.970\nthen your system becomes\nproblematic after that.\n\n590\n00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:33.033\nAlternate shell, guys that is\nlaunching in the command prompt.\n\n591\n00:29:33.033 --> 00:29:36.310\nBe careful with this one,\nit's a little bit more advanced.\n\n592\n00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:37.380\nIt boots you in the safe mood, but\n\n593\n00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:40.230\nthe only thing you're gonna get is\nthe old time DOS prompt, right?\n\n594\n00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:41.910\nThe command prompt and\nthat's all you'll have to get and\n\n595\n00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:43.100\nyou're gonna have to know your commands.\n\n596\n00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.541\nThat's how you work with\nthe operation system.\n\n597\n00:29:44.541 --> 00:29:46.390\nYou might say, well Wes,\nwhy would I wanna do that?\n\n598\n00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:48.347\nWe're your troubling\nyour video sub system,\n\n599\n00:29:48.347 --> 00:29:50.780\nthat's when you're gonna wanna do that.\n\n600\n00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:53.250\nActivity Directory repair,\nwe're not gonna worry about that one here.\n\n601\n00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:55.670\nNetwork says boot me in the safe mode,\nright?\n\n602\n00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:57.790\nJust those minimalistic drivers and\nservices,\n\n603\n00:29:57.790 --> 00:29:59.399\nbut also start the network adapter.\n\n604\n00:29:59.399 --> 00:30:03.443\nJust in case I have to connect maybe\na network share or maybe the Internet and\n\n605\n00:30:03.443 --> 00:30:07.440\ndownload an uncorrupted driver to\nmaybe fix what the problem is.\n\n606\n00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:11.385\nSome of the other ones you can see here,\nNo GUI boot, Boot log,\n\n607\n00:30:11.385 --> 00:30:13.631\nBase video, OS boot information.\n\n608\n00:30:13.631 --> 00:30:18.590\nAgain, more diagnostics that you can enter\ninto when you decide to do a Safe boot.\n\n609\n00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:22.558\nI will tell you this is a little different\nthan doing an advanced start up.\n\n610\n00:30:22.558 --> 00:30:26.440\nAdvanced startup,\nI can pick just boot into safe mode.\n\n611\n00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:30.000\nWhen I restart the machine, it restarts\nnormally, cuz I didn't pick it that time.\n\n612\n00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.650\nThis is persistent,\nif you choose a Safe boot,\n\n613\n00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:36.235\nremember that when you reboot the computer\nonce you're done with the diagnostics.\n\n614\n00:30:36.235 --> 00:30:38.606\nCome in here and change it,\nuncheck that Safe boot.\n\n615\n00:30:38.606 --> 00:30:42.745\nThe other thing that we have here\nare the services and their current state.\n\n616\n00:30:43.755 --> 00:30:46.970\nAnd we'll see the services and\nhave seen the services console before and\n\n617\n00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:47.663\nwe'll see it.\n\n618\n00:30:47.663 --> 00:30:50.827\nProbably, more as we go\nthrough this series.\n\n619\n00:30:50.827 --> 00:30:53.997\nBut if I wanted to, I can stop services,\n\n620\n00:30:53.997 --> 00:30:59.331\nI can rearrange the category of them,\ncategorize them if you will.\n\n621\n00:30:59.331 --> 00:31:00.977\nSo which ones are running versus stopped.\n\n622\n00:31:02.077 --> 00:31:05.345\nNow this is one, exam alert,\nexam alert, exam alert.\n\n623\n00:31:07.793 --> 00:31:12.782\nIn previous addition of MSConfig,\nwe would configure applications and\n\n624\n00:31:12.782 --> 00:31:16.800\nwe would put some start up\nprocesses at boot time, right?\n\n625\n00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:20.630\nWe would configure right here, you could\nsee it says, Open this Task Manager.\n\n626\n00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:22.470\nIt is no longer here I\nwant you to know that for\n\n627\n00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:27.330\nthe exam, just in case they say, you have\nto configure some of your start up file.\n\n628\n00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:28.692\nWhich is these can do that?\n\n629\n00:31:28.692 --> 00:31:31.850\nYou don't wanna use MSConfig,\nif you've been using it for a while.\n\n630\n00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:33.292\nBecause that's-\n&gt;&gt; But that's one of my favorite tool.\n\n631\n00:31:33.292 --> 00:31:34.733\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nIt's been like a tool to me.\n\n632\n00:31:34.733 --> 00:31:38.357\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So just keep that in mind.\n\n633\n00:31:38.357 --> 00:31:40.306\nAnd we're gonna look at\nTask Manager here in a second.\n\n634\n00:31:40.306 --> 00:31:45.720\nAnd then you also have some of\nthe basic tools that you can get to.\n\n635\n00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:49.690\nFor instance, if I wanna configure the\nUser Account Control, I can select that.\n\n636\n00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:53.081\nI could choose launch and it takes me into\nthe Control Panel where that setting is,\n\n637\n00:31:53.081 --> 00:31:54.667\nand I don't really have to dig for it.\n\n638\n00:31:54.667 --> 00:31:59.940\nSo that's a really, really good feature\nof system configuration, or MSConfig.\n\n639\n00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:04.621\nKeep that in mind, to launch your\nsystem configuration utility,\n\n640\n00:32:04.621 --> 00:32:06.385\nthat is msconfig.exe.\n\n641\n00:32:06.385 --> 00:32:10.010\nJust in case, they ask you on the exam.\n\n642\n00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.105\nAll right, so that's MSConfig.\n\n643\n00:32:13.105 --> 00:32:17.574\nKeep in mind that the main thing\nto remember about that is,\n\n644\n00:32:17.574 --> 00:32:24.420\nthat it's going to be a way to configure\nyour startup process and boot process.\n\n645\n00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:27.410\nNow Dan, there some other that\nI have to go into, I know,\n\n646\n00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:31.212\nbut it does look like I have talked yet\nagain way too much.\n\n647\n00:32:31.212 --> 00:32:34.001\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well when you've got as much\nbreath of information that we gotta\n\n648\n00:32:34.001 --> 00:32:35.356\nget through to these good people.\n\n649\n00:32:35.356 --> 00:32:39.040\nAnd you have just a short amount of\ntime to do it, that does tend to happen.\n\n650\n00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:39.615\nBut you know what?\n\n651\n00:32:39.615 --> 00:32:44.150\nWe'll go into a lovely part two, which I'm\nsure you all look forward to, I know I do.\n\n652\n00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:45.912\nWes, it's always a good time\nhaving you on the show.\n\n653\n00:32:45.912 --> 00:32:49.570\nYou have a wealth of knowledge and\nwe appreciate you sharing that with us.\n\n654\n00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:53.523\nBut signing off I guess, for ITPro.TV,\nhopefully we'll see you in part two.\n\n655\n00:32:53.523 --> 00:32:54.891\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n656\n00:32:54.891 --> 00:32:55.915\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n657\n00:32:55.915 --> 00:32:56.571\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n658\n00:32:56.571 --> 00:33:04.012\n[MUSIC]\n\n659\n00:33:04.012 --> 00:33:07.484\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:12.680\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.480\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.320\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.689\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode, well,\n\n7\n00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.372\nwe're kicking it with more of our\nMTA series, the good old 98349.\n\n8\n00:00:24.372 --> 00:00:28.970\nJoining us back yet again for more of that\naction is our good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.000\nWes, welcome back sir,\nwe're glad to have you.\n\n10\n00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.315\nWhat are we gonna talk about today?\n\n11\n00:00:32.315 --> 00:00:32.990\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n12\n00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.105\nwe're gonna talk about a couple of\nthings that we couldn't fit in part two\n\n13\n00:00:36.105 --> 00:00:38.785\ncuz I really didn't wanna make\nit like a 45-minute episode.\n\n14\n00:00:38.785 --> 00:00:42.175\nSo, we've got a couple more\nutilities that we're gonna look at.\n\n15\n00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:47.115\nAnd they are important utilities, not only\nin your exam endeavours, but also just in\n\n16\n00:00:47.115 --> 00:00:52.155\nyour basic administration endeavours in\nadministering to a Windows environment.\n\n17\n00:00:52.155 --> 00:00:55.115\nAnd what I'm talking about is one\nthat's been in our operating system for\n\n18\n00:00:55.115 --> 00:00:57.660\na good long while now, and\nthat's called Task Manager.\n\n19\n00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.870\nLet's go ahead and dive right in.\n\n20\n00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.270\nWe're gonna just right-click on our\ntask bar and we're gonna choose, well,\n\n21\n00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.680\nTask Manager.\n\n22\n00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.947\nNow, when Task Manager first starts\nout it's gonna look like this and\n\n23\n00:01:08.947 --> 00:01:13.088\nyou're gonna say well,\nthere really isn't much to Task Manager.\n\n24\n00:01:13.088 --> 00:01:15.872\nAnd that is because they've\nsimplified the interface for\n\n25\n00:01:15.872 --> 00:01:19.750\npeople that just want a quick heads up\nview of what's running on their machines.\n\n26\n00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.210\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n27\n00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.870\nAnd just for a second here I'm gonna\ngo ahead and close that down and\n\n28\n00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.950\nwe're gonna launch a couple\nof applications here.\n\n29\n00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.290\nWe'll launch a Computer Management,\nwe'll launch Performance Monitor,\n\n30\n00:01:35.356 --> 00:01:40.288\nPerfmon, we gotta put an f in there,\nlet's see,\n\n31\n00:01:40.288 --> 00:01:44.640\nand we'll launch Resource Monitor as well.\n\n32\n00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.930\nSo we've got a few items, or applications\nif you will, that are running.\n\n33\n00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.870\nAnd now we'll launch back up our Task\nManager and kinda see what it looks like.\n\n34\n00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.140\nAgain, remember that the default view\nof Task Manager is very simplistic.\n\n35\n00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.157\nLike I said it's just\nreally nothing more for\n\n36\n00:02:01.157 --> 00:02:04.621\na quick heads-up view of the applications\nthat are running on your machine.\n\n37\n00:02:04.621 --> 00:02:07.476\nAnd should you want to stop\nany of those applications,\n\n38\n00:02:07.476 --> 00:02:11.276\nsometimes they become problematic,\nsometimes they just like to hang.\n\n39\n00:02:11.276 --> 00:02:14.875\nAnd if a problem happens where\nan application stops responding,\n\n40\n00:02:14.875 --> 00:02:18.606\nin the default view, all you have\nto do is select that application,\n\n41\n00:02:18.606 --> 00:02:19.784\nchoose End Task, and\n\n42\n00:02:19.784 --> 00:02:25.020\nyou're basically sending a kill command to\nthat application and it's closing it down.\n\n43\n00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.820\nIt's a kill task,\nI think that's what it is in Windows.\n\n44\n00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.150\nI know the kill commands in some\nof the other operating systems but\n\n45\n00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.650\nthis is a kill task command or\noperation that it does.\n\n46\n00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.980\nAnd, it kind of disappeared there.\n\n47\n00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.200\nWe can go ahead and end that task.\n\n48\n00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.030\nNotice how we just basically closed\nall of our applications down.\n\n49\n00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.290\nThat's the simplified view.\n\n50\n00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.820\nHowever, If you choose More details down\nhere at the bottom well you will get\n\n51\n00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:47.450\njust that.\n\n52\n00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.422\nNot only are you gonna get the\napplications that are currently running\n\n53\n00:02:51.422 --> 00:02:53.450\nincluding itself, Task Manager.\n\n54\n00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.890\nYou might notice that when\nyou use fewer details,\n\n55\n00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.610\nTask Manager doesn't\nconsider itself running.\n\n56\n00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.670\nHowever, when you choose More\ndetails It includes itself and\n\n57\n00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.680\nall the background processes that\nare happening right now, on the machine.\n\n58\n00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.190\nAnd most of these things,\na lot of the times, we don't have any\n\n59\n00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.610\ninteractions with these things as users,\nor as human beings, if you will.\n\n60\n00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.330\nIt's the operating system and\n\n61\n00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.430\nother programs that might be running\nas part of the operating system.\n\n62\n00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.430\nAnd they communicate\nwith other applications.\n\n63\n00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.850\nSo all these processes are running.\n\n64\n00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.140\nAnd that comes from, well,\nwhat's known as a Processes tab.\n\n65\n00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.410\nNow the Processes tab is very neat\nin the way it categorizes things.\n\n66\n00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.540\nIn fact,\nthere really isn't many categories.\n\n67\n00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.720\nIt's applications running\nin background process, but\n\n68\n00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.390\nthen over here to the right-hand side,\n\n69\n00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.040\nyou can see the resource utilization\nof these processes or applications.\n\n70\n00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.590\nLet me go ahead, Dan, and\n\n71\n00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.720\nlaunch up another of these applications so\nwe can kinda see what's going on.\n\n72\n00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.670\nThere's Resource Monitor.\n\n73\n00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.020\nWe'll go ahead and\ndo Performance Monitor again.\n\n74\n00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.030\nAnd then,\nwe're gonna look back at our Task Manager.\n\n75\n00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.290\nSo now if I wanna decide,\nokay I've got Performance Monitor and\n\n76\n00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.680\nI've got Task monitor launched up.\n\n77\n00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.120\nOr excuse me, Performance Monitor and\nResource Monitor launched up I can see\n\n78\n00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.330\nbasically, what are they utilizing\nas far as my hardware resources go.\n\n79\n00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.750\nYou can see how this is categorized,\nCPU right,\n\n80\n00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.770\nour processing,\nwhat is the processor utilization.\n\n81\n00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:22.290\nAnd you'll notice that it is across all\nof the cores, which is interesting.\n\n82\n00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.910\nMemory, you can see that I've got about\n58% memory utilization, disk utilization,\n\n83\n00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.500\nand this it the total number,\nversus what is Performance Monitor using.\n\n84\n00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.060\nSo you can see the performance monitor\nhere if we scroll over, Resource and\n\n85\n00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.180\nPerformance Monitor.\n\n86\n00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.410\nNot really using too much CPU,\nreally isn't using too much of your RAM.\n\n87\n00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.790\nHowever, I will tell you that if you have\nan application that has a memory leak,\n\n88\n00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.080\nthis is a quick way to get in here and\nfind it,\n\n89\n00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.180\nfind out which application's\nhaving the problem.\n\n90\n00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.950\nAnd a lot of time what you'll see is\nthat the memory utilization is gonna\n\n91\n00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.380\nkeep skyrocketing.\n\n92\n00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.110\nAnd just keeps slowly climbing up,\nand climbing up, and\n\n93\n00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.970\nclimbing up even if\nthe applications no longer open.\n\n94\n00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.420\nHence, what a memory leak is,\nit doesn't release that memory.\n\n95\n00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.770\nWell, this would be a good way to isolate\nthat application, or that process, and\n\n96\n00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.815\nthen turn around and End Task.\n\n97\n00:05:08.815 --> 00:05:12.960\nHowever, let's be very, very careful\n\n98\n00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.730\nwhen we talk about the Processes tab,\nand closing our system services down.\n\n99\n00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.250\nYou could cause an instability\nin your operating system.\n\n100\n00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.990\nSo know what you're doing before you\ndecide that [LAUGH] you wanna shut down\n\n101\n00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.268\nbackground processes.\n\n102\n00:05:26.268 --> 00:05:29.756\nI will tell you that there are some times\nthat I'll know that one's here that\n\n103\n00:05:29.756 --> 00:05:33.820\nI really wanna close down and I'll close\nit down, because I know what it is.\n\n104\n00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.600\nHowever, there are many in this list I\ncouldn't tell you the first thing about\n\n105\n00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.110\nwhat they are.\n\n106\n00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.450\nThere are so many of those service\nhost controllers in there, which SVC?\n\n107\n00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:41.310\n&gt;&gt; VC Hosts Yeah.\n\n108\n00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.390\n&gt;&gt; Hosts, yeah.\n\n109\n00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.020\nWhich one of those\nare you gonna close down?\n\n110\n00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.035\nProbably you want to stay\naway from all of them.\n\n111\n00:05:46.035 --> 00:05:46.904\n&gt;&gt; You are your own virus.\n\n112\n00:05:46.904 --> 00:05:48.355\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n113\n00:05:48.355 --> 00:05:50.850\nYou will become-\n&gt;&gt; Why is this not running?\n\n114\n00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.375\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You will become your\nown worst enemy, for sure.\n\n115\n00:05:54.375 --> 00:05:58.925\nSo wise words, be very careful,\nbecause in optimizing your computer you\n\n116\n00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:00.955\ncan cripple it, and\nthat's certainly not what we want to do.\n\n117\n00:06:00.955 --> 00:06:03.605\n&gt;&gt; If they only made a tool to\nwhere you could search a large,\n\n118\n00:06:03.605 --> 00:06:08.230\ngathered pool of information for\nwhat these hosts do.\n\n119\n00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.913\nYeah, it's called Google.\n\n120\n00:06:08.913 --> 00:06:10.070\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right,\n\n121\n00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.600\nit's your search engine.\n\n122\n00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.120\nSo that's a little bit\nabout the Processes tab.\n\n123\n00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.670\nNow the Processes tab, I'm gonna go\nahead and skip a couple of tabs.\n\n124\n00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.590\nCuz I wanna go all\nthe way over to Details.\n\n125\n00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:25.310\nBecause, they really are close, and\none in the same, as what they do.\n\n126\n00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.430\nSee, if you'll notice\nin the Processes tab,\n\n127\n00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.120\nnotice how it's got this expansion arrows.\n\n128\n00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.230\nAnd I could see Antimalware\nservice executable, or\n\n129\n00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.170\nI can see that's the Windows Defender\nservice that's running.\n\n130\n00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:41.810\nRemember we were talking about those,\nwhat was it, SVChost?\n\n131\n00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.710\nWe said there's a whole bunch of them?\n\n132\n00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.170\nWell if I expand that out,\n[LAUGH] there's a few.\n\n133\n00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.870\n&gt;&gt; One or two.\n\n134\n00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.020\n&gt;&gt; And you certainly don't want to\nend this task because you can see\n\n135\n00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.240\nall the other things that it kills.\n\n136\n00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.320\nIt might not even let you end it\nanyways because the system tries to\n\n137\n00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.320\nprotect itself.\n\n138\n00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.930\nBut notice how they have them bundled\nin like a hierarchical tree fashion.\n\n139\n00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.440\nWell details, it really gives you\na lot of the same information.\n\n140\n00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.130\nIt goes a little bit farther,\nhence, the name details.\n\n141\n00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.310\nBut you're gonna see that\nit does not collapse.\n\n142\n00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.590\nJust because there's a single category,\nit doesn't collapse them.\n\n143\n00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:19.450\nNotice there's two of these csrss.exe's\nand i can see a little bit more.\n\n144\n00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:24.350\nNot only do I see the processor\nidentification, PID, that's what that is,\n\n145\n00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.250\nProcessor ID.\n\n146\n00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.580\nI can see the status, I can also see\nthe context in which it's running.\n\n147\n00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.800\nI can tell that this is being\nrun by the system account,\n\n148\n00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.450\nthat's the local system account.\n\n149\n00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.000\nI can see that explorer.exe, that's me.\n\n150\n00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.290\nWell, you might say,\nyou don't have Windows Explorer open.\n\n151\n00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.790\nYour desktop,\nYour desktop is Windows Explorer.\n\n152\n00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:48.679\nThat is what shows you your desktop.\n\n153\n00:07:48.679 --> 00:07:51.688\nSo keep in mind, that's why when we say,\nthey call it File Explorer,\n\n154\n00:07:51.688 --> 00:07:53.632\nbut the service hasn't changed it's name.\n\n155\n00:07:53.632 --> 00:07:57.217\nFile Explorer is one of the major\ninterfaces that you use in the Windows\n\n156\n00:07:57.217 --> 00:07:58.748\noperating system GUI based.\n\n157\n00:07:58.748 --> 00:08:02.571\nIt's because everything is Windows\nExplorer or File Explorer in that case.\n\n158\n00:08:02.571 --> 00:08:07.520\nAll right, so details again does\ngive you a lot of that information.\n\n159\n00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.950\nA lot more information.\n\n160\n00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:12.040\nNow what can I really do\nwith this information?\n\n161\n00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:12.880\nWhat if I decide,\n\n162\n00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.660\nwell I'm trying to figure out\ndo I have a virus or not, right?\n\n163\n00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:20.180\nThese are good If your\noperating system kinda\n\n164\n00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.230\nstarts working a little haywire, right?\n\n165\n00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:25.660\nWell I can see what account it's running\nin, I can see the description of it.\n\n166\n00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.560\nAnd there's been times where I don't\nhave a description in here, right?\n\n167\n00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.640\nAnd I'm not exactly sure what that is.\n\n168\n00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.110\nBut I, remember what I told you,\nit still sticks,\n\n169\n00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:38.260\ndon't just disable it if you're\nnot aware of what it is.\n\n170\n00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.312\nI can always right click on it, right?\n\n171\n00:08:40.312 --> 00:08:42.690\nAnd we've got a lot of different options.\n\n172\n00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:47.030\nMore advanced options than we really want\nto get in here like setting a priority.\n\n173\n00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:53.245\nAnd this just says how much of the CPU's\ntime is it gonna have a higher priority.\n\n174\n00:08:53.245 --> 00:08:56.015\nThe other thing that we have here\nis set it an affinity, right.\n\n175\n00:08:56.015 --> 00:08:59.300\nSo I can set processor affinity\nas well as core affinity.\n\n176\n00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.284\nAffinity, if I can say that.\n\n177\n00:09:01.284 --> 00:09:07.695\nBut the one that I really like here\nis that little option right there.\n\n178\n00:09:07.695 --> 00:09:11.170\nIf I think I might have a virus and\nI'm not sure what this is.\n\n179\n00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:12.810\nWe just go ahead and\nsearch online, all right.\n\n180\n00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:16.368\nAnd it's gonna ask me, well,\ndo you wanna do, I'll go ahead and\n\n181\n00:09:16.368 --> 00:09:18.724\nI'll just keep Edge here since it's MTA.\n\n182\n00:09:18.724 --> 00:09:21.000\nAll right, and notice what it tells me.\n\n183\n00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.170\nRight, it says this process is\nthe Desktop Windows Manager.\n\n184\n00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:27.070\nWe know that this is gonna be\nsomething that we don't have to\n\n185\n00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:29.540\nworry about because it's\nbuilt into Windows.\n\n186\n00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:32.580\nSo I could probably say\nwithout a question of a doubt,\n\n187\n00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.330\nI don't want to shut that one down.\n\n188\n00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.650\nI certainly don't want to Right-click\non this and choose End Process.\n\n189\n00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:44.150\nSo, again, you could collapse\nthe whole entire process tree.\n\n190\n00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:47.570\nThat would be akin to taking\none of these over here.\n\n191\n00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.706\nAnd where you could see, for instance,\nservice host has a whole bunch of them.\n\n192\n00:09:50.706 --> 00:09:53.510\nYou're basically closing\ndown the whole entire thing.\n\n193\n00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.190\nNow, we certainly don't advocate\nthat here at IT PRO TV.\n\n194\n00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:01.710\nBecause, again, you might become your own\nworst enemy in your computing environment.\n\n195\n00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:05.880\nAll right so, couple other things that\nwe need to look at here in Task Manager.\n\n196\n00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.150\nWe'll look at the performance now.\n\n197\n00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:10.490\nI really like this\nPerformance tab location.\n\n198\n00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:12.800\nAnd one of the reasons\nI say that is because.\n\n199\n00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.700\nFor the longest time, this was a very,\n\n200\n00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:20.880\nvery simplistic utility that didn't\nhave a lot of flashy flair to it, right?\n\n201\n00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.440\nWhich is basically what people wanted.\n\n202\n00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.950\nWell now that we've got\nstronger processors and\n\n203\n00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:30.660\nthis is now considered basic,\nno flair, they finally upgraded it.\n\n204\n00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.810\nSo we get these real time displays.\n\n205\n00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:35.604\nFor instance you can see\nthe CPU utilization.\n\n206\n00:10:35.604 --> 00:10:40.846\nAnd I do believe that\nthere is a way that we can\n\n207\n00:10:40.846 --> 00:10:45.680\nchange graphically used, view, CPU.\n\n208\n00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.679\nThere, you can do some basic modifications\nto how you view this here, like for\n\n209\n00:10:50.679 --> 00:10:52.410\ninstance memory.\n\n210\n00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.860\nI can change the view just by\nclicking on it, changes it over,\n\n211\n00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.740\nshows me a little bit of information.\n\n212\n00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:01.810\nAnd usually see what's available,\nwhat's committed, cache, the page pool.\n\n213\n00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:02.850\nDisc IO, right?\n\n214\n00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:05.880\nIf I want to find out disc utilization,\nwhat's currently happening.\n\n215\n00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:10.610\nI might use the performance tab, and maybe\ncoupled with the performance monitor.\n\n216\n00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:15.190\nTo find out a little bit more information\nabout how my operating system is using\n\n217\n00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:16.800\nthe storage technology.\n\n218\n00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.600\nThat we have inside of it.\n\n219\n00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.170\nYou can also see that there is\ndifferent network adaptors here too.\n\n220\n00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:23.890\nLike for instance ethernet, you can see\nbluetooth, I don't have it connected.\n\n221\n00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:27.230\nIf you happen to have a wi-fi interface\ntoo, that would also show up in the list.\n\n222\n00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:31.770\nSo you could have multiple\nnetwork connections.\n\n223\n00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:34.430\nThat are being monitored here\nin the performance tab too.\n\n224\n00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:39.540\nAnd you can see what is sent\nversus what is received down here.\n\n225\n00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.790\nAnd you can also see the adapter name and\nthe name of the connection type.\n\n226\n00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:45.790\nSo a lot of good information that's here.\n\n227\n00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:48.280\nYou can get to it and\nget to it really quick.\n\n228\n00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.720\nThen we have application history.\n\n229\n00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.780\nApplication history guys this\nis all of your modern UI apps.\n\n230\n00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:58.580\nAnd what they are utilizing,\nCPU time, network, tile updates.\n\n231\n00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:00.070\nYou can see here metered network.\n\n232\n00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.570\nNow I might want to just take a second\nhere and talk about metered network.\n\n233\n00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:06.910\nWhen you flag a connection\nas a metered network.\n\n234\n00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.250\nIt changes how your\noperating system works.\n\n235\n00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:12.820\nFor instance Live Tile updates stop,\nyour Windows updates stop.\n\n236\n00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.130\nSo it's basically,\n\n237\n00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:17.810\nyou're flagging this saying hey this\nis a cellular connection right.\n\n238\n00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:19.380\nSo I've got a data plan.\n\n239\n00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.320\nAnd I certainly don't\nwant to chew up the role.\n\n240\n00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:25.380\nMy data plan just by live tile update,\nreaching out the Windows update.\n\n241\n00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:29.990\nAnd pulling those updates over my metered\nconnection, or over my data plan.\n\n242\n00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:33.335\nSo, it does change the way.\n\n243\n00:12:33.335 --> 00:12:34.765\nYour computer interacts.\n\n244\n00:12:34.765 --> 00:12:38.035\nAnd this shows you if\nthese modern UIFs have\n\n245\n00:12:38.035 --> 00:12:41.085\nbeen used over one of\nthose metered connections.\n\n246\n00:12:41.085 --> 00:12:44.705\nAnd then how often are they\ngetting tile updates.\n\n247\n00:12:44.705 --> 00:12:49.085\nYou can see that the majority of\nthe one is, what is that like, 200K.\n\n248\n00:12:49.085 --> 00:12:50.645\nSo not very big there.\n\n249\n00:12:50.645 --> 00:12:53.283\nBut, you might wanna be aware\nof that information too.\n\n250\n00:12:53.283 --> 00:12:56.250\nNow, exam alert.\n\n251\n00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:02.450\nWe talked about in the last portion or\nthe last part two I guess.\n\n252\n00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:06.240\nWe talked about MS configure and\nI said exam alert, exam alert, exam alert.\n\n253\n00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:10.809\nI said that MS config, you no longer\nconfigure your start up programs.\n\n254\n00:13:10.809 --> 00:13:15.117\nAnd some of the files or\nprocesses that it puts in your boot time.\n\n255\n00:13:15.117 --> 00:13:18.740\nBut you do that inside\nof Task Manager today.\n\n256\n00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.360\nThis is that tab.\n\n257\n00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:24.070\nSo you could see right here, for\ninstance, One Drive is in there.\n\n258\n00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:27.120\nAnd you can also see things\nlike the Publisher, the status,\n\n259\n00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:27.990\nif it's enabled or not.\n\n260\n00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:31.420\nAnd then the Startup Impact\nwhether it's high, medium or low.\n\n261\n00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.450\nIf you do happen to have one of\nthese that are a high level, and\n\n262\n00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:36.600\nthey really impact your startup time.\n\n263\n00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.800\nAnd you want to optimize the boot process,\nwell you can always disable them.\n\n264\n00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.550\nHowever, I would be careful\non the ones that you disable.\n\n265\n00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:47.390\nFor instance, if you have\nanti-malware technologies in here.\n\n266\n00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:51.360\nYou want those anti-malwares,\nanti-virus software,\n\n267\n00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.170\nyou want that coming on\nas soon as possible.\n\n268\n00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:56.870\nAnd If it does slow down,\nif you even notice it really,\n\n269\n00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:59.770\nif it does slow down your\nboot process a little bit.\n\n270\n00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:04.060\nSlowing that down, erring on the side of\nprotection I would say is much better than\n\n271\n00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.130\nhaving a fast boot time.\n\n272\n00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:07.455\nMan, it got you to those\nviruses a lot quicker.\n\n273\n00:14:07.455 --> 00:14:09.740\n[LAUGH] So be careful there, here.\n\n274\n00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.990\nOther than that I typically disable\neverything else just because I\n\n275\n00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.420\nwant the fastest boot time I can get.\n\n276\n00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.680\nUsers, I can see the users that are\ncurrently logged into the machines here.\n\n277\n00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.470\nI can't do this to myself but\nI can see what's being utilized by this.\n\n278\n00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:26.070\nSo if you have somebody that's a,\ndid a fast user switch.\n\n279\n00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:27.650\nAnd they're still logged into the machine.\n\n280\n00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:31.160\nChances are they've got processes\nthat are still being stored in RAM.\n\n281\n00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.750\nAnd you could still be wasting\nsome of those resources.\n\n282\n00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.950\nSo if you needed to,\nyou could always disconnect that user.\n\n283\n00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:38.520\nIf they're no longer gonna be\nsitting at this computer but\n\n284\n00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:39.920\nthey still remain logged in.\n\n285\n00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.580\nDetails, we've kind of talked about that.\n\n286\n00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:45.790\nAnd just like in MS config,\nwe also have the services.\n\n287\n00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.060\nAnd the services goes\na little bit more here,\n\n288\n00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:51.920\nbecause you can see the processor ID here,\nthe PID.\n\n289\n00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.290\nI could also open the service\nconsole from the Task Manager.\n\n290\n00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:59.200\nIf I wanted to here just by clicking the\nlittle task link down here at the bottom.\n\n291\n00:14:59.200 --> 00:14:59.920\nWe're gonna go ahead.\n\n292\n00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.910\nWe're not gonna launch that now but\nyou can see task manager,\n\n293\n00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:05.790\ngreat little utility to have, Dan.\n\n294\n00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:09.840\nIf you just need a quick heads-up view\nof what's going on your computer.\n\n295\n00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.960\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nThis is one of those tools that you will\n\n296\n00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.210\nuse quite often, right?\n\n297\n00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:15.680\nYou're gonna wanna take a look,\nhow is this computer running?\n\n298\n00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.990\nYou're gonna get phone calls,\n\n299\n00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:20.220\nmaybe yourself is experiencing\nslowdown in your PC.\n\n300\n00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:21.300\nIt's a great place to jump, right?\n\n301\n00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:25.090\nYou can see all the process that are\nrunning, you can look at Performance and\n\n302\n00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:26.440\nsee, maybe something's going on.\n\n303\n00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.640\nI see my CPU's spiked through the roof,\n\n304\n00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:32.300\nlet me see which applications\nactually spiked up.\n\n305\n00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.170\nJump over to there,\ncheck those applications,\n\n306\n00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:36.880\nsee which has a CPU that's\njacked through the roof.\n\n307\n00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.720\nKill that application, maybe do\nsome research on that application,\n\n308\n00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.832\nsee if that's a common problem.\n\n309\n00:15:40.832 --> 00:15:44.660\nYou guys can see, this small little\nwindow into the computer's soul,\n\n310\n00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:48.550\nas it were, will help you in\nyour administration daily tasks.\n\n311\n00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:49.500\nThat is for sure.\n\n312\n00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:50.285\n&gt;&gt; That's right, I like that.\n\n313\n00:15:50.285 --> 00:15:51.005\nThat analogy too.\n\n314\n00:15:51.005 --> 00:15:53.075\nThe small window into your computer soul.\n\n315\n00:15:53.075 --> 00:15:53.931\nI'm gonna use that.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n316\n00:15:53.931 --> 00:15:55.181\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully you don't got that patented.\n\n317\n00:15:55.181 --> 00:15:59.936\nThat's right, and speaking of your\ncomputer's soul, how do we configure it?\n\n318\n00:15:59.936 --> 00:16:00.489\nNo, just kidding.\n\n319\n00:16:00.489 --> 00:16:02.884\n[LAUGH] The next thing that we're\ngonna look at is something known as\n\n320\n00:16:02.884 --> 00:16:03.752\nComputer Management.\n\n321\n00:16:03.752 --> 00:16:07.152\nSo again guys, let's not sit here and\ntalk a whole bunch about it,\n\n322\n00:16:07.152 --> 00:16:10.080\nlet's actually show it to you\nas we are talking about it.\n\n323\n00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.670\nNow there's a couple of different ways\nyou can get to computer management and\n\n324\n00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:16.690\nI'm gonna go ahead and show you a few\ndifferent ways that you can do this,\n\n325\n00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:18.130\njust in case it comes up on the exam.\n\n326\n00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:21.860\nOne of the easiest ways that we\ncan get to it is from the start,\n\n327\n00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.590\nlittle search field right here.\n\n328\n00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:27.150\nI can type COMPMGMT.MSC, right?\n\n329\n00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:28.360\nRolls right off the tongue.\n\n330\n00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.700\nJust kidding, that's one of the old run\nline commands and you can see here that,\n\n331\n00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.480\nthat would launch Computer Management.\n\n332\n00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.810\nI mention that more for\n\n333\n00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:39.560\nexam purposes really than I do\njust day to day functionality.\n\n334\n00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:43.370\nI've got it memorize because I've used\nit so much because I teach Windows.\n\n335\n00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:45.830\nThat's not really a common way\nto get to Computer Management.\n\n336\n00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:48.000\nThe other way that you can get to it.\n\n337\n00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.390\nIs you can get to it through your\nadministrative tools that we've shown you\n\n338\n00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:52.560\nin other episodes.\n\n339\n00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.190\nWe right click on our Windows icon and\nchoose Control Panel.\n\n340\n00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:58.860\nSystem and Security.\n\n341\n00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:00.520\nAdministrative Tools, and\n\n342\n00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.950\nthen you can see second down from the top\nis Computer Management right there.\n\n343\n00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:08.210\nI'm gonna go ahead and just,\nI'm not gonna launch that right there.\n\n344\n00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:09.390\nBut I'll go ahead and close this down.\n\n345\n00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:12.130\nNow the other way believe it or not, that\nyou can get to it is by File Explorer.\n\n346\n00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:14.260\nAnd you might say,\nwell wait a second, Wes.\n\n347\n00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.280\nComputer management,\nfile explorer, what do you mean?\n\n348\n00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.340\nLet me go ahead and show you.\n\n349\n00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:19.070\nIf I open up file explorer,\n\n350\n00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:23.488\nnotice that there is in the console tree\non the left-hand side, there's this PC.\n\n351\n00:17:23.488 --> 00:17:24.270\nIf I right-click,\n\n352\n00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:28.520\nyou might notice a little UAC shield\nicon next to the work manage.\n\n353\n00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.220\nThis PC, let's go ahead and\nmanage it and see what it does.\n\n354\n00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:37.300\nAll right, and what you might see here is\nthat yes, that opened Computer Management.\n\n355\n00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:41.460\nNotice that there was a few different\nways to get to computer management guys.\n\n356\n00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:44.220\nI show you three different\nways just cuz you never know\n\n357\n00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:45.710\nhow they're gonna ask you on the exam.\n\n358\n00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:49.410\nAnd the one way that you like\nto get to computer management.\n\n359\n00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:52.630\nMurphy's law dictates it might not be\nthe way they're gonna ask you on the exam,\n\n360\n00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:54.360\nso have your bases covered there.\n\n361\n00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.390\nNow when it comes to these\nutilities that we have,\n\n362\n00:17:56.390 --> 00:18:01.040\nnotice that we've got basically like\na convenience store of utilities.\n\n363\n00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.370\nYour one stop shop,\ngot everything under one roof.\n\n364\n00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:07.640\nYou can see that we've got them\ncategorized in the console tree\n\n365\n00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.180\nhere on the left.\n\n366\n00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:11.780\nThey've got them categorized\nas System Tools, Storage, and\n\n367\n00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.020\nServices and Applications.\n\n368\n00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.970\nFor instance, there's the Task Scheduler.\n\n369\n00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:18.240\nTask Scheduler, believe it or\nnot, you're using this and\n\n370\n00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.170\nyou're probably didn't even know it,\nunless you got a solid-state drive then\n\n371\n00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:25.320\nyou're not using it at all,\nuntil you can figure that.\n\n372\n00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.440\nWhat do I mean?\n\n373\n00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.240\nI mean Disk Defragmenter.\n\n374\n00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.150\nIn Vista, back when Vista came out,\n\n375\n00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:32.640\nthey decided that they were\ngonna make sure that people's\n\n376\n00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:37.220\nhard drives were defragmented, whether\nthey wanted to do it or not, all right?\n\n377\n00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:41.700\nAnd they actually set a task in motion and\nit has been there for a while now.\n\n378\n00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.670\nAnd a lot of times it's buried,\nlet me show you what I mean.\n\n379\n00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:47.880\nIf expand out task manager,\nand task library,\n\n380\n00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:54.830\nand then Microsoft, and then under Windows\nlet me go ahead and expand out Windows.\n\n381\n00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:59.260\nAnd there should be an option in\nhere called defrag, yup right there.\n\n382\n00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:03.790\nAnd you'll notice that\nthere is a scheduled task.\n\n383\n00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:08.130\nNotice that it says the operation\ncompleted successfully.\n\n384\n00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:10.460\nDan, I never did anything with this,\nright?\n\n385\n00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.275\nI haven't set anything in motion here.\n\n386\n00:19:13.275 --> 00:19:13.975\nSo what is that about?\n\n387\n00:19:13.975 --> 00:19:19.405\nWell that's because it's a task that's\nbeen scheduled that's automated, right?\n\n388\n00:19:19.405 --> 00:19:21.095\nAnd that's the good thing\nabout Task Scheduler.\n\n389\n00:19:21.095 --> 00:19:22.485\nI can automate things so\n\n390\n00:19:22.485 --> 00:19:25.725\nthat I don't have to be in front of\nthe computer on a day to day basis.\n\n391\n00:19:25.725 --> 00:19:29.460\nIf I know that maybe I want disk\ncleanup to run once a week.\n\n392\n00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:32.180\nBut well Wes would forget\nif he attach the next.\n\n393\n00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:35.620\nSo I forgot that there are four computers\nthat I didn't do a disk leanup on.\n\n394\n00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:40.540\nWell if I set a task across all of\nthem to initiate a certain time,\n\n395\n00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.900\nI could set it, forget it,\nwalk away and I know it's gonna happen.\n\n396\n00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:47.320\nSo Task Scheduler is a very,\nvery handy tool to do automation.\n\n397\n00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.980\nAll right, it's one of those hidden gems.\n\n398\n00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.760\nReally, the whole computer\nmanagement console it's a hidden gem\n\n399\n00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.200\ninside of Windows.\n\n400\n00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.690\nSome of the other things\nthat we can use in here,\n\n401\n00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:57.580\nwe can use things like Even Viewer, right.\n\n402\n00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.010\nEven Viewer is a great way.\n\n403\n00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:01.810\nWe talked a little bit about\nit in another episode.\n\n404\n00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:06.170\nAbout how to find the different happenings\nthat go on in your computer the day to day\n\n405\n00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:09.390\noperations, they're tagged in\nevent viewer as events, but\n\n406\n00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.290\nthey're essentially day to day operations.\n\n407\n00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:14.200\nAnd sometimes they're good and\nsometimes they're not so good.\n\n408\n00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:18.620\nAnd you can find out which side of\nthe tracks you fall on, when you for\n\n409\n00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.420\ninstance go in here to system logs, right.\n\n410\n00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.090\nAt the top here,\nI can see just information logs, right?\n\n411\n00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:26.970\nSo far so good, everything looks good.\n\n412\n00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:28.580\nGoodness, we've got a warning.\n\n413\n00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.880\nAll right, so\nI can see different level events, right?\n\n414\n00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:37.390\nThe event levels are information, warning,\nerror, and critical, so four of them.\n\n415\n00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:39.750\nBut what if you're just looking for\nspecific events,\n\n416\n00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:42.480\nyou say well something\nwent on the machine.\n\n417\n00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.440\nI know it just blue screened it and\nthen rebooted.\n\n418\n00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.950\nWell you can actually do\na filter on these logs.\n\n419\n00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:49.720\nIf I come over here to the right-hand\nside, fifth down from the top,\n\n420\n00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.310\nI look at Filter Current Log.\n\n421\n00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:53.370\nI could do exactly that.\n\n422\n00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:56.520\nSo maybe I'm not too worried about\nthe information level events, but\n\n423\n00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.400\nI do want warning,\ncritical and error, right?\n\n424\n00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.190\nAnd maybe I want a specific time frame.\n\n425\n00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:04.320\nI say I know it happened\nwithin the last 24 hours and\n\n426\n00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:07.480\nthen what I can do is I can,\nI could just filter right through there.\n\n427\n00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:11.560\nNow I can see what's happening\nthat isn't going too well\n\n428\n00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.640\nwithin the last 24 hour period.\n\n429\n00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.090\nNow, what could I do with these events?\n\n430\n00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:18.440\nYou can look at the properties\nof each individual event.\n\n431\n00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:23.910\nNow, the one good thing about this\nconsole is that as you just select it,\n\n432\n00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:26.030\nyou could see the information down here.\n\n433\n00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:31.010\nBut I like to have that information free\nstanding and the reason I like to do that\n\n434\n00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:35.090\nis because I might have more than one\nthat I want to compare side by side, and\n\n435\n00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:38.140\nI'll tell you that the information\nlevel events are handy.\n\n436\n00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:39.060\nWhy?\n\n437\n00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:44.224\nBecause it tells you on the information\nevent a service started at 9.30 PM.\n\n438\n00:21:44.224 --> 00:21:49.180\n9:31 PM or seconds after 9:30, right?\n\n439\n00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.080\nWe had a crashed.\n\n440\n00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.720\nWell, I might wanna compare what\nwas it that caused the crashed.\n\n441\n00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:58.752\nYes, the information event told me\nsomething turned on and the warning,\n\n442\n00:21:58.752 --> 00:22:04.109\nthe error or the critical event tells me\nthe result of that service turning on,\n\n443\n00:22:04.109 --> 00:22:08.520\nso it's really, really good to\ndo some troubleshooting here.\n\n444\n00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.600\nAnd you might say, well you can\nsee network link is disconnected.\n\n445\n00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.045\nEven I can read that one and\nunderstand that one's kind of basic.\n\n446\n00:22:14.045 --> 00:22:15.435\n[LAUGH] But it's not on.\n\n447\n00:22:15.435 --> 00:22:16.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's not hard, right?\n\n448\n00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:18.435\nHe pushed the power button.\n\n449\n00:22:18.435 --> 00:22:19.995\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; He unplugged the cable.\n\n450\n00:22:19.995 --> 00:22:22.870\n[LAUGH] But\nsome of them were a little bit more\n\n451\n00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:27.240\ncryptic than that because they'll have\na crazy explanation of what it is.\n\n452\n00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.730\nIn fact, here's one, right.\n\n453\n00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:30.040\nI don't know what this [INAUDIBLE] means.\n\n454\n00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:33.240\nI couldn't tell you for\nthe life of me what that guit means.\n\n455\n00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.580\nI can tell you this is\na DistributedCOM error, okay?\n\n456\n00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.620\nWell I can tell that just\nby the first word there.\n\n457\n00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.260\nBut I don't exactly know what it means.\n\n458\n00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:46.570\nAnd I can take this event ID, and I can\nsay, you know what event ID, what is that?\n\n459\n00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:47.470\nThat is 1601.\n\n460\n00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:51.251\nLet's go ahead an see if\nedge will work for me.\n\n461\n00:22:52.977 --> 00:22:54.310\nAlright, we'll go ahead and open this up.\n\n462\n00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:57.690\nAnd we're gonna do event ID.\n\n463\n00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:06.140\n10,006, and sure enough in the list\nI can see DCOM come up there, right.\n\n464\n00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:07.120\nSo here's TechNet, right.\n\n465\n00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.520\nThey have what's known\nas a knowledge base, and\n\n466\n00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:13.660\nI can find out what is that\nproblem that we had here, right.\n\n467\n00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:17.190\nAnd it's telling me,\ngives me some options as to what that is,\n\n468\n00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:20.640\nwhat caused that event, and\nalso some resolutions to that event.\n\n469\n00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.780\nSo that's one of the reasons I really,\nreally like Event Viewer.\n\n470\n00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:28.270\nNow guys, I'm gonna go ahead and\nclose these down, but we've got a whole\n\n471\n00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:32.890\nbunch of other utilities that you can use\ninside of computer management, right.\n\n472\n00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:37.840\nLocal users and groups to manage and\nmaintain your local users and groups.\n\n473\n00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:41.350\nPerformance monitors for\nperformance related information.\n\n474\n00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:43.970\nDevice Manager,\nI can open up device manager,\n\n475\n00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:47.670\nI can see the state of all the hardware\nthat's currently in our systems.\n\n476\n00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:50.530\nNow when we start talking about drivers,\nwhen we starting talking about\n\n477\n00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:55.005\ndoing things like management of our hard\ndrives, we'll see these applications more.\n\n478\n00:23:55.005 --> 00:23:57.825\nBut it is good to know that\ncomputer management's here, and\n\n479\n00:23:57.825 --> 00:24:01.295\nthat it does have your back with some of\nthose utilities in a single location.\n\n480\n00:24:01.295 --> 00:24:02.565\nYou can see disk management.\n\n481\n00:24:02.565 --> 00:24:05.667\nIf I decide, hey you know what,\nI wanna come in here and\n\n482\n00:24:05.667 --> 00:24:07.893\nI wanna work with disk management, and\n\n483\n00:24:07.893 --> 00:24:12.229\nI wanna do a little bit of modification\nto the partitions that are on a drive.\n\n484\n00:24:12.229 --> 00:24:14.930\nWell I can select the drive\nthat's in question, right.\n\n485\n00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:20.120\nAnd then I can make modifications provided\nthat those modifications are available.\n\n486\n00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:24.260\nFor instance, I decide that I don't want\none massive partition on this drive.\n\n487\n00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.810\nNow, this is only 20 gigs, but\nimagine if it was 2 terabytes.\n\n488\n00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:30.980\nMaybe I wanna say, I don't want 2\nterabytes in a single partition.\n\n489\n00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.010\nMaybe I wanna divide that up a little bit,\nright?\n\n490\n00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:35.050\nWell I can come in here and\nI can do a shrink volume.\n\n491\n00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:39.560\nAnd it tells me, well how much space\nI can shrink if I want to, and\n\n492\n00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.810\ncreate another partition.\n\n493\n00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:42.390\nSo let's see, that's a 17.\n\n494\n00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:44.281\nI'll tell you what we'll do.\n\n495\n00:24:44.281 --> 00:24:46.291\n&gt;&gt; Two.\n\n496\n00:24:46.291 --> 00:24:46.897\n&gt;&gt; Two.\n\n497\n00:24:46.897 --> 00:24:47.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There we go.\n\n498\n00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:48.560\nThere we go.\n\n499\n00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:49.641\nI like your simple numbers, man.\n\n500\n00:24:49.641 --> 00:24:50.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That makes it easier,\n\n501\n00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:51.890\neven Wes can figure those out.\n\n502\n00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:52.805\nAnd we'll choose shrink here.\n\n503\n00:24:52.805 --> 00:24:53.370\n&gt;&gt; And notice that.\n\n504\n00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:55.941\n&gt;&gt; It's the number of toes\nyou have on your left foot.\n\n505\n00:24:55.941 --> 00:24:57.260\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n506\n00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:59.010\nWe kid but we have a lot of fun.\n\n507\n00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:02.210\nSo notice that I just went ahead and\nI split that right down that middle,\n\n508\n00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:03.000\nthat partition.\n\n509\n00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.990\nAnd now I have the ability\nthat if I wanted,\n\n510\n00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:06.790\nI could create a simple volume out of it.\n\n511\n00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:12.530\nAnd just walk through the wizard, and\nI'm not gonna put a volume label on this.\n\n512\n00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:16.260\nIt will have a letter on it,\nand sure enough there we go,\n\n513\n00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:21.030\nwe've got another partition and if I look\nand file explorer I now have a evolume\n\n514\n00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:25.930\nthat is ready to use just like that\nbecause of the fact, that well we've\n\n515\n00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:30.000\ngot good old dismantlement parked there\ninside of computer management for us.\n\n516\n00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.400\nSo now the great utility here.\n\n517\n00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:35.470\nThen probably the last one I mention\nis the services note here, and\n\n518\n00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:38.340\nI know we cannot talk about it but\nlet's go ahead I'll show you a little\n\n519\n00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:42.040\nbit more about the services and\napplications note.\n\n520\n00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:46.890\nIf we have processes that are going on\nin the background that are running,\n\n521\n00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:48.770\nsometimes those processes hang,\n\n522\n00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:54.500\nsometimes you need a process to be\nstarted in order for technology to work.\n\n523\n00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:55.590\nLet me give you an example.\n\n524\n00:25:55.590 --> 00:26:01.660\nInside of your Windows server operating\nsystem they allow you to apply\n\n525\n00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:05.480\nsomething known as AppLocker, if you are\nin an Active Directory environment, right.\n\n526\n00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.920\nThe problem is AppLocker works\non a service on Windows that by\n\n527\n00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.250\ndefault isn't started automatically.\n\n528\n00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:15.700\nIn fact, it says manual but\nit doesn't even start even if it's\n\n529\n00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:18.900\nin a manual start of type,\nso you need to start it.\n\n530\n00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:19.730\nHow do we do that?\n\n531\n00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:20.480\nLet me show you.\n\n532\n00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.520\nIt's called\nthe Application Identity Service here.\n\n533\n00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.480\nAnd it's not really\nan instruction on AppLocker,\n\n534\n00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.900\nbut I need to start the service\nin order for it to work.\n\n535\n00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.140\nSo I can come in here.\n\n536\n00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:31.170\nI can find that\nApplication Identity service.\n\n537\n00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:34.270\nI can double click on it, and\nI can look at the different properties.\n\n538\n00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:37.110\nNotice it says that\nthe start up type is manual.\n\n539\n00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:40.160\nWell, I could choose the down arrow and\nI could say no, start it automatically.\n\n540\n00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:43.130\nAnd in fact, go ahead and\nstart the service now.\n\n541\n00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:46.544\nNow if I got the other components and\nAppLocker configured.\n\n542\n00:26:46.544 --> 00:26:47.330\nAnd you know what?\n\n543\n00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:51.539\nI don't know if I am a administrator.\n\n544\n00:26:51.539 --> 00:26:56.640\nOkay, so gotta be an administrator\n[LAUGH] to be able to set some of these,\n\n545\n00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.130\nbut you can see the fact that\nyou can configure them for\n\n546\n00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:02.730\ninstance, restarting the print\nspooler happens sometimes.\n\n547\n00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:03.850\nWe need that to happen.\n\n548\n00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:08.330\nAgain, I've showed you that in another\nepisode, where if you need to start and\n\n549\n00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:10.260\nstop the service, it's just that easy.\n\n550\n00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:10.760\nYou can stop it.\n\n551\n00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:14.020\nService stops and you restart it.\n\n552\n00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:15.540\nBasically, like restarting your printer.\n\n553\n00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:19.380\nSo you have the ability that, if you need\nto, you can not only see the current\n\n554\n00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:22.800\nstate of the services, but you can\ninteract with them if you need to stop and\n\n555\n00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.000\nrestart services, and\nchange their start up type.\n\n556\n00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.100\nSo keep in mind.\n\n557\n00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:31.210\nComputer management is a great utility and\nif you are in a Windows environment,\n\n558\n00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:33.230\nyou're gonna be doing\nan administration on it.\n\n559\n00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:37.130\nYou're probably gonna be using this\nutility a lot more than maybe you\n\n560\n00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:40.780\nrecognize or realize, so\nknow where it is, use it and\n\n561\n00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:44.462\nalso know some different ways to open it\njust in case they ask you how to use it.\n\n562\n00:27:44.462 --> 00:27:45.201\n&gt;&gt; Nail in the heads Wes.\n\n563\n00:27:45.201 --> 00:27:45.891\nNail in the head.\n\n564\n00:27:45.891 --> 00:27:47.120\nHe's exactly right.\n\n565\n00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:50.410\nThey'll quiz you on 12 different ways\nto get to one stinking thing, and\n\n566\n00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:53.770\nlike he said before,\nin that one way that you like, that's man,\n\n567\n00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:56.450\nthat's so convenient to do it that way,\nthey'll never ask you about that.\n\n568\n00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:59.270\nThey're gonna ask you about the hardest,\nmost convoluted path possible\n\n569\n00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:01.130\nto get to some tool that\nthey want you to know about.\n\n570\n00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:03.070\nSo I know it's a bear.\n\n571\n00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:07.040\nBut, try to learn all those different\nways, and know them by heart.\n\n572\n00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.550\nIt's just something that\nwe have to go through.\n\n573\n00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:11.170\nIt's a rite of passage, into the IT world.\n\n574\n00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:13.170\nThat being said Wes,\nwe do thank you for dropping by.\n\n575\n00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:14.140\nIt was great stuff.\n\n576\n00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:17.980\nWe appreciate your knowledge in\nbringing that to us here on the show.\n\n577\n00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:20.700\nWe thank you guys for watching,\nbut it is time for us to sign off.\n\n578\n00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:22.950\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n579\n00:28:22.950 -->

Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.040\nWes, welcome back, sir,\nhow's it going today?\n\n9\n00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.910\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me here.\n\n10\n00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.290\nThat's right, we are working on a mini\nseries on native applications and tools.\n\n11\n00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.755\nBut we did have another one\nthat we wanna throw in and\n\n12\n00:00:37.755 --> 00:00:41.935\nwe just didn't have enough time in part 2,\nso hence, part 3,000, like Dan says here.\n\n13\n00:00:41.935 --> 00:00:43.345\nAnd what utility is that?\n\n14\n00:00:43.345 --> 00:00:47.975\nWell, that utility, or tool, is a common\none, and it's one that's been around for\n\n15\n00:00:47.975 --> 00:00:50.787\na good while now, in fact,\nI remember using it in XP and\n\n16\n00:00:50.787 --> 00:00:54.617\nI'm sure it was there prior too,\nbut that's computer management.\n\n17\n00:00:54.617 --> 00:00:56.467\nAnd computer management for\n\n18\n00:00:56.467 --> 00:01:01.287\nthe most part really hasn't changed\ntoo much since the days of XP.\n\n19\n00:01:01.287 --> 00:01:05.130\nCouple variations here for the most part,\nbut well, what is computer management?\n\n20\n00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.950\nComputer management is kinda like\na convenience store when it comes to\n\n21\n00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.620\nthe different capabilities that it has.\n\n22\n00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.360\nIt has what's known as snap-ins, and\n\n23\n00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.630\nlet me go ahead and\nshow you too this utility here.\n\n24\n00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.600\nNow, I also am going to emphasize,\nif I can say it right,\n\n25\n00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.420\nthe the necessity to know multiple\nways to get to different utilities.\n\n26\n00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.610\nWe've really been stressing that, and\n\n27\n00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.600\nthat's just cuz we want you\nto be prepared on the exam.\n\n28\n00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.840\nSo the one way that I like to get to\na utility might not be the way that\n\n29\n00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.290\nDan gets to that utility, right?\n\n30\n00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.140\nThe one where you might like to get to\na utility might not be the way either\n\n31\n00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.680\nof us do.\n\n32\n00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.810\nSo which one is gonna be on the exam?\n\n33\n00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.990\nWell, we just really don't know.\n\n34\n00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.200\nSo we're gonna make sure that\nyou're taken care of here.\n\n35\n00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.000\nNow couple of different\nways that we can do this.\n\n36\n00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.570\nWe can use our search\nfunctionality here if we want to.\n\n37\n00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.840\nAnd I can type compmgmt.msc because,\nwell what does that mean?\n\n38\n00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.880\nWell, that msc there, if you will,\n\n39\n00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.950\nis nothing more than\na Microsoft Management Console.\n\n40\n00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.750\nWe're gonna touch base on a Microsoft\nManagement Console and what it really\n\n41\n00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.260\nmeans for us, and how we can get\nthe best advantage of that utility, but\n\n42\n00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.060\nthis is a pre-built here, and\nif we launch it you can see.\n\n43\n00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.200\nWell, here comes Computer Management.\n\n44\n00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.790\nWait for it, it'll get there eventually,\n[LAUGH] and it is launched up.\n\n45\n00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.860\nNow that's not the only way\nthat you can get to it.\n\n46\n00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.730\nSo let's go ahead, and\nwe're gonna close this down and\n\n47\n00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.480\nwe're gonna look at another\nway that we can get to this.\n\n48\n00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.600\nI'm gonna go to our Windows key.\n\n49\n00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.730\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nright click on that Windows key.\n\n50\n00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.240\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nchoose control panel.\n\n51\n00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.630\nAnd in control panel remember that\nthis is an administrative tool.\n\n52\n00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.940\nAnd we talked about the various\nadministrative tools here\n\n53\n00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.250\nin a previous episode.\n\n54\n00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.400\nBut we're gonna go to system and security.\n\n55\n00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.160\nGonna go down here to the bottom.\n\n56\n00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.810\nYou will see Administrative Tools and\nthat's where we wanna be.\n\n57\n00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.510\nWhen we open this up,\n\n58\n00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.780\nsecond down from the top we should see\nhere that we've got Computer Management.\n\n59\n00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.690\nSo there's another way\nthat you can get to it.\n\n60\n00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.830\nWe got one more way that\nwe wanna show you and\n\n61\n00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.680\nthis is again it's something that's\nbeen in Windows Explorer and Windows 7,\n\n62\n00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.290\nFile Explorer in Windows 8 and\non up, and here in Windows 10.\n\n63\n00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.850\nSo that's where we're gonna go, and you're\nprobably saying well Wes, wait a second.\n\n64\n00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.560\nWe need computer management,\nwhy are we launching File Explorer?\n\n65\n00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.180\nWell, let me show you what I mean here.\n\n66\n00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.810\nIf you'll notice that on the left-hand\nside, just under OneDrive,\n\n67\n00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:12.620\nthere's this PC.\n\n68\n00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.030\nAnd if I right-click and I scroll up to\nthe top you're gonna see manage here.\n\n69\n00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.850\nWell, if I click manage you'll probably\nguess that's computer management as well.\n\n70\n00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.730\nAnd that one really has been around for\na while.\n\n71\n00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.250\nIf you where in Windows 7, for\ninstance, you push the start button,\n\n72\n00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.500\nyou go to computer on the right hand side,\nabout half way down the list,\n\n73\n00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.240\nyou right click and choose manage.\n\n74\n00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.380\nSo it has been there for a while now.\n\n75\n00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.380\nCan you open it with Cortana?\n\n76\n00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.010\n&gt;&gt; You know you can if you have\nthe speech recognition turned on.\n\n77\n00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.850\nIf I had hey Cortana turned on,\nwhich we did talk about in this series,\n\n78\n00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.160\nif you will,\nthat we're going through here.\n\n79\n00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.760\nYou could say, hey, Cortana, launch\nComputer Management and it would open.\n\n80\n00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.400\nI don't have the voice recognition turned\non here, the microphone if you will.\n\n81\n00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.130\nAll right, so now that we've got\ncomputer management open and\n\n82\n00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.290\nwe've seen a couple of different ways to\nopen it up, be aware of that for the exam.\n\n83\n00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.790\nAnd if we look at computer management,\nremember one of the things that I told you\n\n84\n00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.830\nis that it really is kinda\nlike a convenient store\n\n85\n00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.040\nwhen it comes to different utilities\nthat it has built or bundled into it.\n\n86\n00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.375\n&gt;&gt; Has everything and\nsteals your dignity when you go there.\n\n87\n00:04:16.375 --> 00:04:17.980\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, absolutely.\n\n88\n00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.420\nAnd you'll be shamed on\nthe way out the door for sure.\n\n89\n00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.310\nNow you can see how it's categorized here,\nyou can see system tools at the top, and\n\n90\n00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.740\nwe'll talk about some of\nthese system tools as well.\n\n91\n00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.400\nI know that we've talked about some\nof these in other episodes, but\n\n92\n00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.680\nsome of them we have not.\n\n93\n00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.450\nAnd I want you to be aware of them too,\nso you could never really talk\n\n94\n00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.300\ntoo much about these utilities, in fact in\nlater episodes, we won't just talk about\n\n95\n00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.540\nwhat the utility does, we're gonna show\nyou it in action so do keep that in mind.\n\n96\n00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.260\nThis is really gonna set the basis for\nthese utilities and then we'll show you\n\n97\n00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.570\nmore of a practical application as\nwe progress through the series.\n\n98\n00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.020\nSo, we talked about task scheduler before,\nbut lets kind of revisit task scheduler.\n\n99\n00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.750\nTask scheduler is a way that you\ncan automate daily tasks, right?\n\n100\n00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.690\nFor instance if I'm in\na small environment,\n\n101\n00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.970\nmaybe I'm helping to assist\na very small business right,\n\n102\n00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.390\nwe've got less than 10 computers in\nwhat Microsoft would call a work group.\n\n103\n00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.280\nWell it isn't really easy to\nautomate things that you wanna do.\n\n104\n00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.680\nYes you can maybe apply scripts and stuff\nlike this but how about a way that I can\n\n105\n00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.150\nschedule something to run at a certain\ntime and I can walk away from it and\n\n106\n00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.560\nI know if the computer's on, when that\ntime hits or whatever the the trigger\n\n107\n00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.310\nmight be that actually sets that\ntask in motion, is gonna happen.\n\n108\n00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.240\nAnd I don't have to sit there and\nstay in front of this computer, and\n\n109\n00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.750\nthen walk to the next computer, and\nthen the next computer, and vice versa,\n\n110\n00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.740\nuntil I get through ten\ndifferent computers.\n\n111\n00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.030\nSo let me show you here.\n\n112\n00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.090\nSo give you an example\nof when task scheduler.\n\n113\n00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.660\nActually, in this step, one of the things\nthat they started doing automatically.\n\n114\n00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.080\nMaybe you're not aware of this is they\nstarted running the disk defragmenter in\n\n115\n00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.730\nthe background.\n\n116\n00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.460\nAnd even though they tell you,\nyou don't have to run it today,\n\n117\n00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.480\nI still run it on\nmechanical disks anyways.\n\n118\n00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.030\nBut it is tasked there and\nrunning regardless, so if you forget,\n\n119\n00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.220\nyour drive in the background is\nstill getting optimized, right?\n\n120\n00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.560\nWhich is a good a thing,\nthere's nothing really wrong with that.\n\n121\n00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:19.320\nAnd if I drill down in here,\nunder the task scheduler hierarchy,\n\n122\n00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.300\nlet me go ahead and open up this menu a\nlittle bit so you can see a little better.\n\n123\n00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.710\nWe get into Windows, and you can scroll\ndown, you see all the different little\n\n124\n00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:32.130\ncategories we have here, file history,\nmaintenance, but let me show you one here.\n\n125\n00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.050\nDefrag.\n\n126\n00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.090\nWell defrag is where Imagine this,\nthe disk defragmenter is located.\n\n127\n00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.980\nEven though they call it a drive optimizer\ntoday guys, don't let that fool you.\n\n128\n00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.690\nA lot of times in Windows what\nyou'll see is a new coat of\n\n129\n00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.260\npaint over a technology that\nreally hasn't changed too much.\n\n130\n00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.110\nA few minor upgrades but\nthey'll call it something different.\n\n131\n00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.050\nThey call it the defragmenter and\ndrive optimizer today.\n\n132\n00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.200\nIt's still really the same thing.\n\n133\n00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.210\nIn fact, so much so that you can see\nit called by it's original name here in\n\n134\n00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.770\nTask Scheduler, which is defrag.exe.\n\n135\n00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:06.300\nAnd you can see that it's scheduled and\nthe status is ready.\n\n136\n00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.530\nNow I will tell you,\nyou might say well if it works so\n\n137\n00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:13.540\ngood Wes,\nwhy hasn't this test actually run yet?\n\n138\n00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.550\nIf it is automated?\n\n139\n00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:19.920\nWell let me let you know that task\nscheduler's good enough and Windows itself\n\n140\n00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.010\nis good enough to recognize that you have\na solid state drive in your machine.\n\n141\n00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:27.570\nAnd solid state drives don't benefit\nfrom a defragment because the way they\n\n142\n00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:31.920\nstore information and they clear\ninformation and erase it to store more\n\n143\n00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.860\ninformation isn't really the same\nthing as a mechanical drive.\n\n144\n00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.420\nSo you really don't run the optimizer.\n\n145\n00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:42.630\nBut If you don't have solid state drives,\nthis is running at a certain time.\n\n146\n00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:47.080\nAnd we could actually look at\nthe properties down here at the bottom.\n\n147\n00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.050\nThis'll run every Wednesday.\n\n148\n00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:50.905\nWhat's it say?\n\n149\n00:07:50.905 --> 00:07:53.896\nTell you what,\nlet's pull up the properties here.\n\n150\n00:07:53.896 --> 00:07:56.958\nAll right, and let's see.\n\n151\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.194\nSchedule.\n\n152\n00:07:58.194 --> 00:07:59.893\nTriggers, you got your action.\n\n153\n00:07:59.893 --> 00:08:03.086\nOkay, so\nactions are when you look at your tasks,\n\n154\n00:08:03.086 --> 00:08:06.280\nactions are what is gonna actually happen.\n\n155\n00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:11.250\nAnd notice that it's defrag.exe and\na couple of options.\n\n156\n00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:15.520\nSo, what is this telling you when\nyou look at this string path here,\n\n157\n00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.070\nif you will, and then defrag.exe?\n\n158\n00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:22.210\nWell what that means, is Task Scheduler,\nwhen it hits a certain time,\n\n159\n00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.940\nand let me see if I can find the time,\nthere we go.\n\n160\n00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.350\nEvery three days, three minutes history,\n\n161\n00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:31.490\nokay it doesn't look like,\nyeah it hasn't run yet.\n\n162\n00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:35.420\nBut it should run every Wednesday,\nI want to say at like three AM.\n\n163\n00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:38.790\nAnd, what it's gonna do is,\n\n164\n00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:43.820\nTask Scheduler will look to see if\nthere's a current task that is turned on.\n\n165\n00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:48.570\nAnd when it does, it's gonna automate\nthe process by running the defrag.exe, and\n\n166\n00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:49.640\nthese switches.\n\n167\n00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.950\nAnd that's akin to me,\nif I wanted to, launching up for\n\n168\n00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:54.840\ninstance a command prompt.\n\n169\n00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.970\nAnd inside of the command prompt,\nI run a defrag.exe and\n\n170\n00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:02.322\nI'll just give you some of\nthe options here, right.\n\n171\n00:09:02.322 --> 00:09:05.570\nSo here's our defrag.exe,\nif I wanted to to run this, right,\n\n172\n00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.490\nI'd have to come in here, and\nI have to do this manually.\n\n173\n00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:12.740\nBut what it's telling you, is that the\nTask Scheduler is gonna do this for us.\n\n174\n00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:18.279\nAnd if you look at the actions,\nit's going to run -c -h -o,\n\n175\n00:09:18.279 --> 00:09:21.140\nright, automatically as part of this task.\n\n176\n00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:24.345\nWell, I can come back here if I\ndon't understand what that is, and\n\n177\n00:09:24.345 --> 00:09:26.130\nsee -c says on all volumes, right?\n\n178\n00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:29.520\nAnd there should be an o here,\nit says perform proper optimization for\n\n179\n00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.630\neach media type.\n\n180\n00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.061\nWhich is another thing that's really cool,\nbecause of the fact that well,\n\n181\n00:09:34.061 --> 00:09:36.164\nmaybe you've got different\ntypes of drives.\n\n182\n00:09:36.164 --> 00:09:39.227\nWe've got solid state, we've got\nSCSI drives, we've got mechanical,\n\n183\n00:09:39.227 --> 00:09:40.390\ntraditional SATADrives.\n\n184\n00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:43.880\nSo it also says do whatever's\nappropriate for the media type.\n\n185\n00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:48.355\nI don't have to guess what the media type\nis between Task Scheduler and Defrag.\n\n186\n00:09:48.355 --> 00:09:50.065\nThey're kind of working together here, and\n\n187\n00:09:50.065 --> 00:09:51.950\nthey're gonna do this in\nthe background for us.\n\n188\n00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:55.650\nSo, that is a great utility to have,\nI tell you,\n\n189\n00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:57.728\nyou can really have some fun with it.\n\n190\n00:09:57.728 --> 00:10:02.340\nI used it really, to send things like Waco\nand LAN packages to other computers, wake\n\n191\n00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:05.620\nthem up and then turned around on that\ncomputer, and use a task to shut it down.\n\n192\n00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:10.990\nSo I completely automate the whole entire\nprocess between these two computers.\n\n193\n00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:14.620\nAll right, next one,\nnext one we got is Event Viewer.\n\n194\n00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:19.018\nNow Event Viewer is very, very important\nbecause it is a way to track all system\n\n195\n00:10:19.018 --> 00:10:23.810\nwide activities that happen with inside\nof your Windows operating system.\n\n196\n00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:27.880\nAnd if I wanna find out what's going on,\nall I have to do is well, first of all,\n\n197\n00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.040\nlaunch Computer Management, right?\n\n198\n00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.250\nAnd then I have to expand out the Event\nViewer tree here, and I can look, and\n\n199\n00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:37.300\nI can see Custom Views, Windows Logs,\nApplications and Services Logs, and\n\n200\n00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:38.250\nthen Subscriptions.\n\n201\n00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:40.210\nSubscriptions is a really cool thing,\n\n202\n00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:42.820\nbecause you can actually subscribe\nto other computers' logs, and\n\n203\n00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:46.030\nthey can actually forward those\nlogs to a centralized machine.\n\n204\n00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:50.300\nAnd then I can read that information\nwithout being inside, or if you will,\n\n205\n00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:54.630\npresent at that remote computer\nthat's sending me the information.\n\n206\n00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.840\nI will tell you, on the exam,\npay attention to these logs right here,\n\n207\n00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.720\nthese logs are very, very important.\n\n208\n00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.143\nThese are some of the common logs\nthat we look at from to time.\n\n209\n00:11:03.143 --> 00:11:05.755\nYou got Application,\nSecurity Setup and System, and\n\n210\n00:11:05.755 --> 00:11:08.890\nthen those Forwarded Events\nthat I was telling you about.\n\n211\n00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:13.170\nI tell you what, let's look system here,\nwe'll just take one of these logs so\n\n212\n00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.070\nyou can just kinda see.\n\n213\n00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.860\nIt takes a second to populate\nthe information, because it's actually\n\n214\n00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:21.130\nquerying the subsystem here, and it's\ngonna basically give you back the logs.\n\n215\n00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:24.810\nKind of like your own little\nelectronic paper trail.\n\n216\n00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:28.580\nAnd you can see that I do have some\ninteresting stuff going on on my\n\n217\n00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.510\nWindows machine.\n\n218\n00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:32.719\nSo for instance,\nif I was to grab one of these\n\n219\n00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:36.490\ndifferent event levels that come\nin four different event levels.\n\n220\n00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:39.920\nYou've got Error, Critical,\nWarning and Informational, and\n\n221\n00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:45.340\nif I want to know what is it that's\ngoing on with this particular event.\n\n222\n00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.350\nAll I gotta do it click on it,\nand here are the properties, and\n\n223\n00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:50.150\nit tells me there's\nan installation failure.\n\n224\n00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.430\nAnd it talks about failing to\ninstall a certain update, and\n\n225\n00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:55.990\nit can tell me a lot of\ninformation about it, right?\n\n226\n00:11:55.990 --> 00:12:00.740\nSo, for instance I can look at the Event\nID, I can use that Event ID if I want to\n\n227\n00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.680\ngo look at Microsoft's\nknowledge base as they call it.\n\n228\n00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.600\nYou might see these little\narticles there that say KB, and\n\n229\n00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.250\nthen have a string of numbers behind it.\n\n230\n00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:12.130\nThat's a knowledge base article that says,\n\n231\n00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:16.090\nif you run into one of these events\nthey log the information in the event.\n\n232\n00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:21.190\nAnd then they also have a database out\nthere that you can go reference what is it\n\n233\n00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:25.100\nexactly that happened,\nthat caused this error.\n\n234\n00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:29.580\nOr in this case, this event to\nbe generated in the first place.\n\n235\n00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:33.270\nI can see what the user is,\nin this case it's the system account.\n\n236\n00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:36.400\nYou might see things like networks\nservice, if it's the system account or\n\n237\n00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.810\nnetwork service.\n\n238\n00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:40.190\nThese aren't really something that\nyou're gonna interact with, and\n\n239\n00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:42.540\nit really isn't anything that\nyour users are gonna do.\n\n240\n00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.723\nThese are the system accounts that will\nallow the different operations to happen\n\n241\n00:12:45.723 --> 00:12:46.715\non the Windows machine.\n\n242\n00:12:46.715 --> 00:12:48.971\nAnd then in the background\nnetwork computers to be able to\n\n243\n00:12:48.971 --> 00:12:50.030\ncommunicate together.\n\n244\n00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:52.270\nSo I can see all of that information,\n\n245\n00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:56.870\nbasically, just by opening\nthis one single event.\n\n246\n00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:02.940\nNow, Event Viewer is, again,\nreally good for finding\n\n247\n00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.560\nout problems that happen, but it's also\ngood for things like security auditing.\n\n248\n00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.110\nFor instance,\nif I go over here to Security,\n\n249\n00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:13.240\nyou can see that it is doing\nsome auditing here, right?\n\n250\n00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.560\nAnd if I look at one of these events,\nthese are a little bit different.\n\n251\n00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.580\nNotice that these are related\ngenerally to things like access.\n\n252\n00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:23.050\nFile object access,\ninteractive log on's, logging on and\n\n253\n00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:25.220\nlogging off to the computer.\n\n254\n00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:28.140\nIf you set a permission on an object,\nright, for instance,\n\n255\n00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.480\nI've got a file there and I say,\nDan has full control of it.\n\n256\n00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.880\nI need him to be able to\nmodify that document.\n\n257\n00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.720\nWell guess what, that's gonna show\nup right here in the security log.\n\n258\n00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:40.700\nSo, as you might think, all security\ncentric it really is a good way to\n\n259\n00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:46.380\nkeep track of what is going on,\nsecurity wise and related to your machine.\n\n260\n00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:50.030\nA couple of the other ones in here that\nI might ask, or might tell you about,\n\n261\n00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:52.800\nApplications and\nServices Log is really good.\n\n262\n00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.160\nAnd you can see Hardware Events,\nInternet Explorer, and under Microsoft,\n\n263\n00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.040\nyou have a lot of stuff under Microsoft.\n\n264\n00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:01.080\nBy going to Windows for instance,\nif I'm in a domain environment,\n\n265\n00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:05.480\nI might scroll down here under Windows,\nand look for something like GroupPolicy.\n\n266\n00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:11.455\nLet's see, I probably passed it there,\nslow down, there we go.\n\n267\n00:14:11.455 --> 00:14:13.930\nGroupPolicy, so\nI could see the operational logs for\n\n268\n00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:15.290\ndifferent pieces of software.\n\n269\n00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:19.180\nAnd if you're in a domain environment,\nthat might be very, very important for\n\n270\n00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.140\nyou, to find out what's going\non in your local machine,\n\n271\n00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.170\nas it relates to GroupPolicy.\n\n272\n00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:26.630\nWhere if you didn't have something\nlike these applications and\n\n273\n00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:28.940\nservices logs,\nyou would be none the wiser.\n\n274\n00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.710\nSo it is good to have this information.\n\n275\n00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:33.860\nEspecially in a troubleshooting scenario,\nwhere maybe a problem's happened and\n\n276\n00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:34.970\nyou wanna isolate it down.\n\n277\n00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:37.510\nOne of the first places I\ngo is here in Event Viewer.\n\n278\n00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:39.670\nSo very good utility to have.\n\n279\n00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:44.700\nShared Folders, this is a way,\nwe're gonna talk about file permissions.\n\n280\n00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.790\nWe'll talk about folders in\nanother episode coming up,\n\n281\n00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:49.480\nbut a share is basically\na way to share resources.\n\n282\n00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:53.250\nEither on this local computer, or with\nthe rest of the people on the network,\n\n283\n00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:55.880\nprovided that they have the permissions,\nand they can access it.\n\n284\n00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.830\nAnd I can manage and modify them here.\n\n285\n00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:03.090\nIf I wanna see for instance,\nwhen Windows is first installed,\n\n286\n00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:06.480\nit creates some default shares that\nthe system uses to communicate.\n\n287\n00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.700\nWell, with other portions of the system,\nother computers on the network and\n\n288\n00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.390\nwe can see that here for instance.\n\n289\n00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:14.240\nIf I choose share, or\n\n290\n00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.310\nshares, you can see that these are what\nare known as administrative shares here.\n\n291\n00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:21.890\nThey have the dollar sign behind them,\nwhich makes them a hidden share.\n\n292\n00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:25.962\nAnd that just basically just means\nyou have to be an admin to use these,\n\n293\n00:15:25.962 --> 00:15:27.430\nyou can see that the C$.\n\n294\n00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:31.600\nIf I'm on a network where I have\na local account on that machine,\n\n295\n00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.380\nI can connect over to the network to C$.\n\n296\n00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:38.560\nAnd what it's gonna do in my File\nExplorer, provided I have the permissions.\n\n297\n00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:44.006\nIt's basically gonna open that machine\nup to local disk C when I browse to it\n\n298\n00:15:44.006 --> 00:15:49.375\n,so I can actually see the root drive,\nif you will, on another machine.\n\n299\n00:15:49.375 --> 00:15:51.166\nAnd as administrator,\nthat's very, very important.\n\n300\n00:15:51.166 --> 00:15:52.901\nMaybe, as an average end user,\n\n301\n00:15:52.901 --> 00:15:55.937\nthat might not be too important\nto the average end user.\n\n302\n00:15:55.937 --> 00:16:00.609\nBut again, like we've said, you guys\nare coming look at the MTA, to be in IT.\n\n303\n00:16:00.609 --> 00:16:03.825\nMaybe the entrance into help desk support.\n\n304\n00:16:03.825 --> 00:16:07.636\nSo these administrative shares definitely\ncome in handy, especially at a help desk\n\n305\n00:16:07.636 --> 00:16:11.260\nlevel when you need to connect\nto another machine as well.\n\n306\n00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.530\n&gt;&gt; And not to mention\nthe whole network share issue.\n\n307\n00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:15.855\nI mean, you're going to,\nas someone who works in IT,\n\n308\n00:16:15.855 --> 00:16:17.435\nyou're just going to\ndeal with networks here.\n\n309\n00:16:17.435 --> 00:16:18.815\nIt's just a fact of life.\n\n310\n00:16:18.815 --> 00:16:21.965\nAnd using the computer management console,\nright,\n\n311\n00:16:21.965 --> 00:16:24.865\nis gonna be a place that you\nspend a lot of your time.\n\n312\n00:16:24.865 --> 00:16:29.410\nHaving quick easy access to all the shares\nthat you deal with on a daily basis\n\n313\n00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:30.892\nright there, very convenient.\n\n314\n00:16:30.892 --> 00:16:32.910\nThat is why they slapped that in there,\n\n315\n00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:36.275\nbecause it's one of those\nvery commonly used features.\n\n316\n00:16:36.275 --> 00:16:38.970\nAnd it says, we're gonna use\nthe computer management console?\n\n317\n00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:41.940\nWhy the heck not,\nwe'll slap that in there as well.\n\n318\n00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:43.590\nSo they did a really good job on that.\n\n319\n00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:45.700\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and\nto build on that too, what Dan's saying,\n\n320\n00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:46.990\nyou see the sessions over here.\n\n321\n00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:49.146\nIf somebody is actually connected\nto one of these shares, and\n\n322\n00:16:49.146 --> 00:16:50.476\nI don't have a connection right now.\n\n323\n00:16:50.476 --> 00:16:54.164\nDan says, I want to monitor, I want to see\nwho is connected to this compute,r and\n\n324\n00:16:54.164 --> 00:16:56.510\nmaybe grabbing that marketing document,\nright.\n\n325\n00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:59.865\nThere's other ways that in a corporate\nenvironment we're gonna share documents,\n\n326\n00:16:59.865 --> 00:17:02.180\nbut we'll just say even if\nyou're in a solo environment,\n\n327\n00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.891\nwell I'm actually see who's connected\nto a share on this machine.\n\n328\n00:17:04.891 --> 00:17:09.572\nSo it's a good, convenient way to\nbasically monitor interactions with your\n\n329\n00:17:09.572 --> 00:17:11.740\nshare as well as create shares too.\n\n330\n00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:17.550\nAll right, so the next one we\nhave is local users and groups.\n\n331\n00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:22.029\nNow, I will tell you that we could,\nif we needed to, right, we can make\n\n332\n00:17:22.029 --> 00:17:26.959\nthis very very modular in the fact that if\nI just wanted to look up local users and\n\n333\n00:17:26.959 --> 00:17:29.825\ngroups I can do something like this,\nright?\n\n334\n00:17:29.825 --> 00:17:35.010\nI could do LSR MGR.MSC, right.\n\n335\n00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:39.510\nAnd if I wanted to I could launch\nthis management console by itself.\n\n336\n00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:43.900\nIf I, maybe I decided that, you know what,\nI need to look at performance monitor.\n\n337\n00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.680\nThat's one thing that I forgot to mention.\n\n338\n00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.500\nWhy would you use something\nlike computer management?\n\n339\n00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.850\nAnd you can see, yeah I have the ability,\n\n340\n00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:53.730\nI can launch all of these\ndifferent utilities if I want.\n\n341\n00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:59.770\nBut the problem is, again,\nit's very, very I don't know.\n\n342\n00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:00.690\nIt's piecemeal, right.\n\n343\n00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:01.370\n&gt;&gt; Disjointed.\n\n344\n00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:02.370\n&gt;&gt; Very disjointed, thank you.\n\n345\n00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:04.110\nThat's the word I'm looking for, right.\n\n346\n00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:08.180\nRather than have everything in a single\nlocation, and I should have probably have\n\n347\n00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:12.450\nstarted with what's another one of\nthe major benefits of computer management?\n\n348\n00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:15.410\nAnd it's just that,\nthat everything's right here.\n\n349\n00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:20.345\nPerformance monitor, we're gonna\ndefinitely look more at performance\n\n350\n00:18:20.345 --> 00:18:25.209\nmonitor towards some of the later\ndomains on the MTA 98-349 exam.\n\n351\n00:18:25.209 --> 00:18:29.111\nBut performance monitor is how you can\nget statistical information related to\n\n352\n00:18:29.111 --> 00:18:32.260\nthe performance of individual\ncomponents in the system unit.\n\n353\n00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:36.760\nAnd what I mean by that is for instance,\nif I expand out performance monitor and\n\n354\n00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.930\nthen I select, and let's zoom in so\nyou guys can see that a little easier.\n\n355\n00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:44.450\nAnd if I select performance monitor,\nI get real time performance data, right.\n\n356\n00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:47.950\nNow I will tell you that the only\none that, and you know what?\n\n357\n00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:49.630\nThat's interesting,\nthere isn't a single one in here.\n\n358\n00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:53.540\nI tell you what, let me go ahead and\nadd what's known as a counter.\n\n359\n00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.780\nLet me add that component\nthat we wanna monitor.\n\n360\n00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:59.260\nSo I'll go ahead and\npush the green plus button here,\n\n361\n00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.420\nand there's a processor right there.\n\n362\n00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.140\nWe'll go ahead and add the processor.\n\n363\n00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:11.590\nScroll up back here to,\nyeah we'll do memory here,\n\n364\n00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:16.730\ndouble click and we'll add memory,\nwe'll just keep it at that, right.\n\n365\n00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:20.280\nNow notice what I've done is I've added\nthese, what are known as counters,\n\n366\n00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:24.260\nat the bottom and these are all\nthe different little characteristics of\n\n367\n00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:28.020\nmemory and the processor, maybe,\nthat I want to monitor here.\n\n368\n00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.186\nAnd now what you're seeing\nguys is real-time information,\n\n369\n00:19:31.186 --> 00:19:33.230\nreal-time performance data.\n\n370\n00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:36.900\nAnd if I've got a computer where maybe\nI'm trying to test out an application,\n\n371\n00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.500\nand I want to see how the application in\n\n372\n00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:43.090\nrelation to what this current\ncomputer configuration is performing.\n\n373\n00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:46.420\nAnd then make up my mind, maybe I need\nto do some upgrades to the computer.\n\n374\n00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.180\nMaybe the application just shouldn't\nbe running on this machine at all.\n\n375\n00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:53.670\nWell I can find the statistical\nperformance information by these counters.\n\n376\n00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:56.740\nWe can also set up what are known\nas performance baselines.\n\n377\n00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:01.660\nPerformance baselines is the expected\nperformance of a machine in\n\n378\n00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:02.830\nits production environment.\n\n379\n00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:07.740\nAnd if I want to find out if a machine\nis straying from that performance level\n\n380\n00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:11.330\nthat we should expect, well I can create\nwhat is known as a Data Collector Set,\n\n381\n00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:12.660\nthat's a DCS.\n\n382\n00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:16.060\nData collector set guys are those counters\nthat we were just telling you but\n\n383\n00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:18.700\nyou pick the counters that you just want,\nright.\n\n384\n00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.780\nAnd that counter becomes\nthat group of counters,\n\n385\n00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:25.205\nthat data collector set becomes\nthe test that you're gonna perform.\n\n386\n00:20:25.205 --> 00:20:27.589\nAnd then what I can do\nis I can run that test,\n\n387\n00:20:27.589 --> 00:20:31.248\nfind out what the expected performance is,\nsave that same test.\n\n388\n00:20:31.248 --> 00:20:34.263\nAnd then in a few months when I think\nthat there's a performance degradation\n\n389\n00:20:34.263 --> 00:20:36.110\nsomewhere in the computer,\nI rerun the test.\n\n390\n00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:39.772\nAnd then we could compare what we\ninitially seen to what we see now and find\n\n391\n00:20:39.772 --> 00:20:43.990\nout if there is some kind of variation or\ndeviation from the expected performance.\n\n392\n00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:47.430\nAnd then use that maybe to leap frog\noff into some more troubleshooting.\n\n393\n00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:51.770\nAll right, now another one\nthat's been in our systems for\n\n394\n00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:54.150\nawhile is good old Device Manager.\n\n395\n00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:56.950\nAnd we're gonna talk more\nabout drivers and stuff and\n\n396\n00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:59.950\nkinda show you this in\naction in a later episode.\n\n397\n00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:01.630\nBut I do wanna just take a second here and\n\n398\n00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:04.330\ntalk a little bit about\nwhat Device Manager is.\n\n399\n00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:08.240\nDevice Manager is essentially a way that\nyou can monitor all of the devices that\n\n400\n00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:13.680\nyour operating system recognizes as being\nconnected to the system unit, all right.\n\n401\n00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.910\nAnd what I mean by, or\ninside the system unit.\n\n402\n00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:18.990\nSo, what hardware do you\nhave inside of this system?\n\n403\n00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:21.000\nI come into Device Manager and\nI can find out.\n\n404\n00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.350\nFor instance,\nI can see things like display adapters.\n\n405\n00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:26.500\nAnd if I feel that maybe I had this\ndisplay adapter for a while and\n\n406\n00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:30.621\nI haven't been doing any updates, I want\nto do something like update its driver.\n\n407\n00:21:30.621 --> 00:21:33.647\nWell that's the other great\nthing about Device Manager,\n\n408\n00:21:33.647 --> 00:21:36.423\nnot only are you looking and\nmanaging the devices, or\n\n409\n00:21:36.423 --> 00:21:40.700\nthe state of the devices if you will, you\ncan also do driver management from here.\n\n410\n00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:45.460\nSo it's a good centralized location to do\ndriver management on the major components\n\n411\n00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.270\nthat are attached to the system.\n\n412\n00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:50.550\nSo for\ninstance I can also choose Properties, and\n\n413\n00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:52.180\nhere we get properties of the device.\n\n414\n00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:55.630\nAnd really what I really, really wanna\nknow about is Is the driver itself.\n\n415\n00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:59.320\nWell I can see who the driver is,\nin this case it's Microsoft HCP,\n\n416\n00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:02.720\nthe hardware compatibility publisher.\n\n417\n00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.140\nAnd I can look at the drive details.\n\n418\n00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:07.400\nI can find out where these\ndrivers are located, right.\n\n419\n00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.580\nWe have something known inside of our\noperating system, Windows operating\n\n420\n00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:14.250\nsystem, as the driver store and\nI can actually see that location.\n\n421\n00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:18.694\nI'm going to take a second Dan and\nI'm gonna say, exam alert, exam alert,\n\n422\n00:22:18.694 --> 00:22:20.159\nexam alert, all right.\n\n423\n00:22:20.159 --> 00:22:21.700\nIt could be on the exam, and\n\n424\n00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:27.230\nthat's that path that you see right\nthereC:\\Windows\\system32\\DRIVERS, right.\n\n425\n00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:29.080\nI just want to go ahead and\nmention that because if they ask you,\n\n426\n00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:33.210\nwhere are the drivers located inside of\nyour system that you need to troubleshoot,\n\n427\n00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:34.150\nright there.\n\n428\n00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:35.190\nSo do remember that.\n\n429\n00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:38.330\nI can also do additional things for\ndriver management.\n\n430\n00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:41.000\nWe can do things like updating the driver,\nlike we said.\n\n431\n00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.389\nRoll back the driver is very good in\nthe scenario where maybe I'm testing out\n\n432\n00:22:45.389 --> 00:22:48.694\na brand new driver that's just\ncome out and I install it.\n\n433\n00:22:48.694 --> 00:22:52.550\nFor whatever reason the driver could be\nfine, but there's a network corruption,\n\n434\n00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:55.801\ncommunication caused a corruption\nof the driver when I installed it,\n\n435\n00:22:55.801 --> 00:22:58.440\nit starts to cause some\nsystem instabilities.\n\n436\n00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:01.450\nWell I can always roll back the driver,\nand that's a great way to say hey,\n\n437\n00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:02.880\nthis driver's not working.\n\n438\n00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:07.140\nLet's just roll it back to\nthe immediate predecessor, and\n\n439\n00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.200\nif that solves my problem,\nif my computer's no longer having issues,\n\n440\n00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.550\nthen I know that it was the driver\nthat's causing the problem.\n\n441\n00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:16.000\nNow, I will tell you,\nit's not a one-size fits all,\n\n442\n00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.990\nit's not the solution to\neverything because you might\n\n443\n00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:22.610\nnotice when you roll back the driver that\nyou're still getting that same issue.\n\n444\n00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:27.251\nAt least you can probably start to isolate\nit down as a hardware issue at that point,\n\n445\n00:23:27.251 --> 00:23:29.860\nall right.\n\n446\n00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:32.150\nSo that is our device manager.\n\n447\n00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:33.670\nNow, disc management.\n\n448\n00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:38.290\nThis is a great one, in fact,\nthis is a utility that I use a lot and\n\n449\n00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:41.190\nthere's really two major\ndisc management utilities.\n\n450\n00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:44.010\nOne is the graphical user interface\nthat you see here as disc management.\n\n451\n00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:47.260\nThe other one is in the command prompt\nthat we'll see a little bit later and\n\n452\n00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:48.842\nthat's called DiskPart, right.\n\n453\n00:23:48.842 --> 00:23:52.548\nWell, if you don't understand\nthe command prompt yet, that's fine,\n\n454\n00:23:52.548 --> 00:23:53.592\nyou don't have to.\n\n455\n00:23:53.592 --> 00:23:56.448\nYou have a graphical user interface\nthat you can work with and\n\n456\n00:23:56.448 --> 00:23:57.906\nmanage all of the hard drives.\n\n457\n00:23:57.906 --> 00:24:02.650\nAnd storage media that's attached to your\nmachine, you could do things like, for\n\n458\n00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:06.037\ninstance, I could right-click\non this if I wanted to, and\n\n459\n00:24:06.037 --> 00:24:09.491\nI could divide this partition in half,\nand maybe free it up,\n\n460\n00:24:09.491 --> 00:24:13.170\nif I wanted to do a multi-boot system for\nwhatever reason.\n\n461\n00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:16.670\nYou know, you could do things like,\nfor instance, creating\n\n462\n00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:19.980\nvirtual hard disks which we'll talk\nabout a little bit more on a VHD there,\n\n463\n00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.030\nDan in our Hyper-V episode.\n\n464\n00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:25.420\nBut I could attach virtual\nhard drives as well.\n\n465\n00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:30.070\nBring disks on and offline, convert them\nbetween the different disks type, so.\n\n466\n00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:33.010\nAnd complete disk,\nlike it says disk management software.\n\n467\n00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:36.299\nSo it's your disk utility\ninside of Windows.\n\n468\n00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:39.910\nAll right,\nnow I know we're coming up on time.\n\n469\n00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:41.650\nDan's giving me that evil eye over there.\n\n470\n00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:43.910\nSo the last one that I want to go into.\n\n471\n00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:47.800\nYou might see two more there,\nI'll just briefly mention the WMI Control.\n\n472\n00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.950\nI don't really think you guys\nhave to worry about WMI.\n\n473\n00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:54.680\nReally, even at the MCSA level,\nlet alone an MTA level.\n\n474\n00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.210\nAnd the reason I say that,\nit's very complex.\n\n475\n00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:58.220\nIt's called\nWindows Management Instrumentation.\n\n476\n00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:02.660\nIt's Microsoft's, basically, their\nversion or flavor, if you will, of what\n\n477\n00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:07.340\nwe have for network devices known as SNMP,\nSimple Network Management Protocol, right?\n\n478\n00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:08.990\nThat's an industry wide standard.\n\n479\n00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:12.850\nThat uses different,\na different type of database,\n\n480\n00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:15.820\nif you will, to find out what is\nthe status of your network devices?\n\n481\n00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:19.620\nAre they,\ndo they have the appropriate uptime?\n\n482\n00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:20.470\nAre they healthy?\n\n483\n00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:21.520\nAre they online?\n\n484\n00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.990\nWell we can actually use WMI to query\nthe operating system in Windows for\n\n485\n00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:29.490\nall different types of information,\nif we really, truly need to.\n\n486\n00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:30.430\nBut again, like I said,\n\n487\n00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:33.020\nI think that's a little bit more\nadvanced than what you'll see here.\n\n488\n00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:36.480\nBut, we mention for the sake of completion\ncuz we're mentioning all the other ones.\n\n489\n00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:40.380\nHowever, this one you will need to,\nI would know about.\n\n490\n00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:42.981\nYou've seen some of the other utilities\nthat we've mentioned, services.\n\n491\n00:25:42.981 --> 00:25:45.685\n[LAUGH] I believe Dan mentioned\nin another episode that man,\n\n492\n00:25:45.685 --> 00:25:48.342\nservices are just about everywhere\nin this operating system.\n\n493\n00:25:48.342 --> 00:25:52.210\nI'll tell you what,\nthis is the major console that you,\n\n494\n00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:54.790\nif you're gonna deal with services,\nyou should go to.\n\n495\n00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:57.750\nAgain, it's one of those ones that\nhas its own if you wanna launch it,\n\n496\n00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:00.850\nbut we're here in computer management,\nso we have it right here.\n\n497\n00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:02.500\nWe don't have to launch it separate.\n\n498\n00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:06.630\nI get the ability that I can manage\nthose background processes that go on,\n\n499\n00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:08.930\nagain services we typically\ndon't interact with.\n\n500\n00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:15.080\nHuman interaction, if you will,\nwe work with them every day,\n\n501\n00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:16.320\nwe don't realize them.\n\n502\n00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.950\nIt's essentially just a process\nthat goes on and we don't launch.\n\n503\n00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:23.570\nBut from time to time these services have\nproblems, for instance if you let's say,\n\n504\n00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:28.390\nif you had a print problem, I know that\nit's sometimes common for you to try to\n\n505\n00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:31.970\nsend a print job to a printer, and\nit never appears in the queue.\n\n506\n00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:33.970\nWell what do you do in that case?\n\n507\n00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:39.000\nWell the principlers actually a service\nin here that you can see just by double\n\n508\n00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.780\nclicking on it and it manages the entire\nprint process from beginning to end.\n\n509\n00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:47.470\nAnd if I do my Ctrl + P shortcut or\nI right click and I choose print and\n\n510\n00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:50.740\nI send to the print job and\nI look at the print queue and it's blank.\n\n511\n00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:55.780\nWell it could be the fact that\nthe printer needs to be rebooted and\n\n512\n00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:59.960\nit would be just as simple as launching\nup your computer management here.\n\n513\n00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:03.430\nFinding the appropriate service,\nin this case print spooler,\n\n514\n00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:05.612\nchoosing stop and start.\n\n515\n00:27:07.315 --> 00:27:11.065\nAnd we've now rebooted our printer\ninside of our operating system, and\n\n516\n00:27:11.065 --> 00:27:15.595\nhopefully at that point what would\nhappen is you would see that the printer\n\n517\n00:27:15.595 --> 00:27:16.885\nstarted printing again.\n\n518\n00:27:16.885 --> 00:27:18.875\nAt least the print queue would\nstart receiving those print\n\n519\n00:27:18.875 --> 00:27:20.310\njobs that were coming to it.\n\n520\n00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:22.250\nNow, we're gonna talk more about services.\n\n521\n00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:25.640\nWe're gonna talk about them more\nin depth in another episode.\n\n522\n00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:29.820\nBut this is the consult inside of computer\nmanagement that you would use to.\n\n523\n00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:34.076\nNot only monitor them, but\nactually work with them if you need.\n\n524\n00:27:34.076 --> 00:27:38.146\nAnd change the different start up types,\nstop and start them, reboot the service,\n\n525\n00:27:38.146 --> 00:27:41.200\nif you will, cuz sometimes those\nservices don't play right.\n\n526\n00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:45.970\nBut that in a nutshell, Dan is computer\nmanagement very handy utility.\n\n527\n00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:49.120\nI use it probably once or\ntwice a week, easily.\n\n528\n00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:51.970\nAnd in a lab environment we're using\nthis thing almost all the time.\n\n529\n00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:55.875\nSo guys, know where it is, know how\nto get there, know different ways and\n\n530\n00:27:55.875 --> 00:27:59.195\nknow the individual utilities in there and\nthe scenarios in which you would use them.\n\n531\n00:27:59.195 --> 00:28:01.825\nAnd you'll be doing really good for\nyour MTA exam.\n\n532\n00:28:01.825 --> 00:28:04.515\n&gt;&gt; Wes, what I think I'm\nhearing you say here is that\n\n533\n00:28:04.515 --> 00:28:07.525\nin the computer management console,\nI can manage my computer.\n\n534\n00:28:07.525 --> 00:28:08.300\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n535\n00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.097\n&gt;&gt; Okay, just making sure I'm on par with\n\n536\n00:28:10.097 --> 00:28:11.767\nyou, that we're tracking right along.\n\n537\n00:28:11.767 --> 00:28:14.007\nAnd that's exactly why we're\nbeing a little facetious here,\n\n538\n00:28:14.007 --> 00:28:14.947\nhaving a good time with it.\n\n539\n00:28:14.947 --> 00:28:18.047\nBut that is an app name for\nthis because it's got so\n\n540\n00:28:18.047 --> 00:28:20.997\nmany features, common usage,\nthings of that nature.\n\n541\n00:28:20.997 --> 00:28:23.240\nThat's what you're gonna find\ninside of computer management.\n\n542\n00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:27.890\nAnd like Wes says, you tend to kick\nyour feet around in there a little bit\n\n543\n00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:31.890\nwhen you work as an advanced user or\nif you're just advanced user at home.\n\n544\n00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:34.740\nYou don't necessarily\nhave to be in IT career.\n\n545\n00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:36.850\nYou just say I wanna know a little\nbit more about my computer.\n\n546\n00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:38.890\nI wanna be able to work with\nit a little bit better.\n\n547\n00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:43.140\nComputer management is a great place to\nget a firm foundation of being able to do\n\n548\n00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.230\nthat very thing.\n\n549\n00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:48.730\nWes, thank you so much for joining us\ntoday and explaining the last few tidbits\n\n550\n00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:52.410\nof what we have when it comes\nto the native applications and\n\n551\n00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:53.910\ntools found inside of Windows 10.\n\n552\n00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:57.510\nThat being said it looks like it's\nour time to go ahead and sign off.\n\n553\n00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:59.703\nFor ITPRO.TV I've been\nyour host Daniel Lowery.\n\n554\n00:28:59.703 --> 00:29:00.543\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n555\n00:29:00.543 --> 00:29:01.390\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n556\n00:29:01.390 -->

00:00:08.197\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.197 --> 00:00:12.050\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.883\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.883 --> 00:00:16.930\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.540\nAnd today, we're taking a look at\nWindows operating system fundamentals.\n\n8\n00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.230\nWe're specifically going to be\ndiving into the world of Hyper-V.\n\n9\n00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.296\nAnd here to help us understand\nwhat Hyper-V is and\n\n10\n00:00:26.296 --> 00:00:28.570\nwhat we're actually talking about is Mr.\nWes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.708\nWes, welcome back to our show.\n\n12\n00:00:29.708 --> 00:00:31.090\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me here, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.130\nIt's always good to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.430\nThat's right, we're going to start talking\na little bit about virtualization and\n\n15\n00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.400\nwhy it benefits us, and\n\n16\n00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.460\nsome of the things that you can expect to\nsee when it comes to configuring Hyper-V.\n\n17\n00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.595\nKeep in mind in the MTA's as we progress\nthrough this series that they're not gonna\n\n18\n00:00:45.595 --> 00:00:48.726\nwant you to get really really in\ndepth on the configurations but\n\n19\n00:00:48.726 --> 00:00:52.410\nthey're gonna want you probably,\nmost likely, to know the interface.\n\n20\n00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.160\nSo, we're gonna start out talking a little\nbit about what virtualization is.\n\n21\n00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.270\nWhy it even benefits us,\nas to why we would even go into\n\n22\n00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.880\nusing some kind of platform like that and\nthen we'll show you a little bit about\n\n23\n00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.680\nthe Hyper-V interface and talk a little\nbit about things like virtual machines.\n\n24\n00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.550\nSo if that's what you're looking for and\nstudying right now, well you are in for\n\n25\n00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.560\na treat because that's what we're\ngonna talk about in this episode.\n\n26\n00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.554\n&gt;&gt; All right so Wes, let's go ahead and\nsince you've actually mentioned the term\n\n27\n00:01:19.554 --> 00:01:23.906\nHyper-V, and we're now talking about the\nideas of virtualization, somebody in our\n\n28\n00:01:23.906 --> 00:01:27.733\naudience may not have a clue or\nunderstanding of what we're talking about.\n\n29\n00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:30.966\nSo what makes this different from what\nwe're normally using on a regular\n\n30\n00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:31.875\nphysical machine?\n\n31\n00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:33.315\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question, Ronnie.\n\n32\n00:01:33.315 --> 00:01:36.033\nWhen it comes to virtualization and\nit comes to Hyper-V,\n\n33\n00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:39.200\nwe've got to start by understanding\nwhat Hyper-V allows us to do.\n\n34\n00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.610\nAll right, so one of the things that it\nallows us to do is, let's go ahead and\n\n35\n00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.120\nstart where Ronnie started there, with\ntalking about our basic operating system,\n\n36\n00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.780\nour basic devices.\n\n37\n00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.140\nWhen you have a piece of hardware,\n\n38\n00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.015\na computer, you have a certain\nset amount of resources.\n\n39\n00:01:52.015 --> 00:01:55.320\nAnd we talk about resources,\nwe talk about things like here CPU.\n\n40\n00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.089\nWe talk about things like memory, your\nhard drive, networking communications.\n\n41\n00:01:59.089 --> 00:02:01.953\nNow where virtualization\ncomes into play for\n\n42\n00:02:01.953 --> 00:02:06.180\nus is it allows us to divide those\nresources up a little bit better.\n\n43\n00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.880\nLet me go ahead and show you what I mean.\n\n44\n00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.680\nI got a little diagram here, and\nwhen you look at basic computing,\n\n45\n00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.870\njust the basic without any virtualization\ntechnologies, this is what we have.\n\n46\n00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.830\nWe have an abstract layer, you could\nprobably put some different layers in here\n\n47\n00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.600\nif you really wanted to get in depth,\nbut these are the basics that we have.\n\n48\n00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.570\nRight at the bottom of\nthe stock we have our hardware.\n\n49\n00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.540\nAnd our hardware sometimes can be\nconsidered our computing resources.\n\n50\n00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.390\nAnd that's definitely something\nthat becomes more and\n\n51\n00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.030\nmore of a terms as we talk about\nthings like the cloud out there,\n\n52\n00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.820\nbut that's really what it boils down to.\n\n53\n00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.170\nWe have a certain amount of resources,\n\n54\n00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.770\ntraditionally we install\nan operating system on it.\n\n55\n00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.180\nAnd then what do we do after that?\n\n56\n00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.440\nWell, the operating system gives\nus access to that hardware.\n\n57\n00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.710\nAnd then from there we can\ngo by the top layer here and\n\n58\n00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.130\nthat's installing applications\nwithin the operating system.\n\n59\n00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.850\nNow, if we were to leave Hyper-V] or\n\n60\n00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.720\nvirtualization technologies completely\nout of it, this is what we would have.\n\n61\n00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.330\nBut imagine being able to take and utilize\nthose resources that are at the hardware\n\n62\n00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.010\nlevel and\ndivide them up a little bit more.\n\n63\n00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.250\nAnd that's one of the benefits\nof virtualization.\n\n64\n00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.470\nWhen it comes to virtualization,\nvirtualization it adds a different layer.\n\n65\n00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.620\nAnd let's go ahead and think a little bit,\noop, didn't mean to do that.\n\n66\n00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.592\nBoy messing up all over.\n\n67\n00:03:19.592 --> 00:03:22.452\nOkay, so let's go ahead and\nlet's talk about, again,\n\n68\n00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:24.190\nthe basic resource utilization.\n\n69\n00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.860\nLet's say that we've got our hardware.\n\n70\n00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.390\nWe've got, CPUs today are really\nreally powerful, right?\n\n71\n00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.770\nWe'll say, you can get 8 cores.\n\n72\n00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.810\nYou know quad cores,\nsix cores, eight cores.\n\n73\n00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.190\nReally powerful.\n\n74\n00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.550\nI bet you if you were to look\nat your machine right now,\n\n75\n00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.620\nI doubt you're even using the full\npotential of that eight core processor.\n\n76\n00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.860\nMemory, now memory back in Ronnie's days\nwhen he first started was very limited.\n\n77\n00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.260\nIt isn't really that way anymore.\n\n78\n00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.040\nAll joking aside, we tend to have a lot of\nmemory that we can use inside of a system\n\n79\n00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.250\nwhen you look at your storage.\n\n80\n00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.480\nA terabyte,\na terabyte is easy today and beyond and\n\n81\n00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.110\nthen we have a gigabit network adaptor,\nif you look at the basic model.\n\n82\n00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.060\nLet's say we've got,\n\n83\n00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.500\nthe operating system is running, we'll\nsay two gigs of RAM, just for itself.\n\n84\n00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.173\nThis is what it's consuming.\n\n85\n00:04:12.173 --> 00:04:16.019\nRegardless of what we actually have in\nthe machine, this is what it's running,\n\n86\n00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.230\nit's running two gigs.\n\n87\n00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.260\nWe got three applications open on the\ndesktop, we're using three gigs of memory.\n\n88\n00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.490\nSo notice that we have three\ngigs that we're using of memory.\n\n89\n00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.200\nAnd these are just ballpark\nfigures to show you,\n\n90\n00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.980\nwe got two gigs for the operating\nsystem itself, we've used five gigs.\n\n91\n00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.330\nWhat bout the other,\nthe rest of the 32 gigs?\n\n92\n00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.570\nWhat happens?\n\n93\n00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.020\nAnd in the normal computing system,\n\n94\n00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.370\nwhat ends up happening is all of\nthose extra resources gets wasted.\n\n95\n00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.357\nYou've got a terabyte drive in your\nmachine, you're using 100 gigs.\n\n96\n00:04:46.357 --> 00:04:48.770\nWell, what happens to the rest of it?\n\n97\n00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.410\nWell, you could go into partitioning.\n\n98\n00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.410\nAnd you could create it, and\nyou could divide it up logically.\n\n99\n00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.430\nBut that's still one operating system\nusing the entirety of that storage.\n\n100\n00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.670\nAnd that's one of the reasons we\nlook at virtualization, all right?\n\n101\n00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.240\nVirtualization gives us the advantage,\n\n102\n00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.220\nthe benefits that we can, for\none, better resource utilization.\n\n103\n00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:12.200\nCan I divide all this hardware I have up,\nmore than one operating system?\n\n104\n00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.370\nAnd that's where virtualization comes\nin because it gives us the chance to\n\n105\n00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.270\nrun more than a single operating system,\ndividing those resources better.\n\n106\n00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.820\nThe other thing that it allows\nus to do is isolate it.\n\n107\n00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.260\nEach one of those operating systems\nthat are now running on this,\n\n108\n00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.880\nwhat normally would be a single operating\nsystem, are now isolated from each other.\n\n109\n00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.670\nSo it's good for things like\nisolated test labs, development.\n\n110\n00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.130\nThis is a big thing, imagine installing\nyour operating system, in our\n\n111\n00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.970\napplication up here that we're using all\nthe way at the top causes a problem, and\n\n112\n00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.430\nthen what happens?\n\n113\n00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.030\nAll the other applications suffer from it,\nthe operating system suffers from it.\n\n114\n00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.802\nBefore you know it we're having to, at the\nvery worst, pull out an installation disk\n\n115\n00:05:53.802 --> 00:05:57.670\nand reinstall all of our operating system,\nso we've got down time.\n\n116\n00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.866\nAnd that's why we wanna look a little\nbit more at what virtualization is\n\n117\n00:06:00.866 --> 00:06:02.190\ngonna do for us.\n\n118\n00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.492\nSo when we look at virtualization I\nwant you to think of it this way.\n\n119\n00:06:04.492 --> 00:06:06.829\nThink of adding an extra layer,\n\n120\n00:06:06.829 --> 00:06:11.076\nadding an extra layer to your\nabstract computing layers.\n\n121\n00:06:11.076 --> 00:06:14.118\nWhat we end up having is the hardware,\nnothing's changed.\n\n122\n00:06:14.118 --> 00:06:16.820\nNotice that we still have\nan application layer.\n\n123\n00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.015\nWe still have an operating system layer.\n\n124\n00:06:19.015 --> 00:06:24.750\nBut now we've got one extra layer in\nthere, and that's what a hypervisor is.\n\n125\n00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:30.560\nI want you to think of as a hypervisor as\na communication between your hardware and\n\n126\n00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.200\nwhatever's running above it.\n\n127\n00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.780\nIn this case,\nwhen we talk about the hypervisor,\n\n128\n00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.210\nthis is what's called\na type one hypervisor.\n\n129\n00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.075\nAll right, and these,\nthis is what Hyper-V is.\n\n130\n00:06:40.075 --> 00:06:44.050\nHyper-V is a type one hypervisor\nin the fact that it runs directly\n\n131\n00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.040\non top of your hardware.\n\n132\n00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.400\nAnd now, what I can do is I can install\n\n133\n00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.120\nmultiple operating systems\non top of that layer.\n\n134\n00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.756\nEach one of these operating\nsystems are what are known as\n\n135\n00:06:55.756 --> 00:06:57.780\na guest operating system.\n\n136\n00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.240\nYour platform here below that, the\nhypervisor becomes what's known as a host.\n\n137\n00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.530\nWhy is it called a host?\n\n138\n00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:08.480\nWell I want you to think, it's hosting\nisolated instances of operating systems.\n\n139\n00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.586\nAnd then on top of that,\nlook at what we can do even more.\n\n140\n00:07:12.586 --> 00:07:17.414\nWe now have three applications\nthat could be running on top\n\n141\n00:07:17.414 --> 00:07:19.982\nof a single operating system.\n\n142\n00:07:19.982 --> 00:07:24.692\nSo you start to see that the benefit is,\nif we go back to our math,\n\n143\n00:07:24.692 --> 00:07:28.380\nhere, and\nyou guys will see how great I am at math.\n\n144\n00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:35.060\nNow look what happens when we start to\ndivide the resources up with Hyper V or\n\n145\n00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.680\na hypervisor.\n\n146\n00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.730\nNotice that we are starting to\nsee that we can use three gigs.\n\n147\n00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:44.978\nRemember the three gigs that we were\nusing earlier for applications?\n\n148\n00:07:44.978 --> 00:07:49.601\nNotice that they're now running in their\nisolated environment and I can divide\n\n149\n00:07:49.601 --> 00:07:53.741\nthe rest of those resources between\nthe available amount that I have and\n\n150\n00:07:53.741 --> 00:07:55.882\nthe additional operating systems.\n\n151\n00:07:55.882 --> 00:08:00.190\nSo you'll notice in this model now that\nI'm running three individual operating\n\n152\n00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:00.768\nsystems.\n\n153\n00:08:00.768 --> 00:08:05.745\nI'm now utilizing 15 gigs of the memory\nbetween the operating systems In\n\n154\n00:08:05.745 --> 00:08:07.091\nthe applications.\n\n155\n00:08:07.091 --> 00:08:10.941\nSo I'm getting a much more\nefficient utilization.\n\n156\n00:08:10.941 --> 00:08:13.710\nYou can also see that I've got 4 GB for\nthe host.\n\n157\n00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:16.414\nYou tally it up, we're using 19 GB.\n\n158\n00:08:16.414 --> 00:08:19.160\nYou say, well wait a second Wes,\nyou've still got 11 GB to go.\n\n159\n00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.510\nWell, that's okay.\n\n160\n00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.779\nBecause if I need to expand in the future,\n\n161\n00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:27.530\nI can add another operating system in and\nguess what?\n\n162\n00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:31.920\nNow I'm starting to use some more of that\nthat otherwise under the traditional model\n\n163\n00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.210\nlike going back to what\nRonnie first mentioned.\n\n164\n00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:35.565\nI wouldn't be able to use it.\n\n165\n00:08:35.565 --> 00:08:39.050\nIt'd just be sitting there idly waiting.\n\n166\n00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:42.320\nAnd really when it comes down to it,\nit can be a waste.\n\n167\n00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:42.930\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes,\n\n168\n00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:46.970\nlet's make sure that we understand this\nidea that you're trying to get across.\n\n169\n00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:52.917\nWhat the idea of virtualization really\nallows me to be able to do is of course,\n\n170\n00:08:52.917 --> 00:08:56.217\ninstead of me having to buy five machines.\n\n171\n00:08:56.217 --> 00:09:00.670\nAnd I can actually run three separate\noperating systems on the same hardware.\n\n172\n00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:01.630\nIs that what you're saying?\n\n173\n00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.115\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it.\n\n174\n00:09:03.115 --> 00:09:05.136\nAnd when he says, three separate machines,\n\n175\n00:09:05.136 --> 00:09:07.440\nwhat are we talking about\nwhen we say machines now?\n\n176\n00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.400\nWhat we're talking about a physical\ndevice that is now running what's\n\n177\n00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.080\nknown as a virtual machine inside of it.\n\n178\n00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.140\nAn isolated instance that's\nreally just software.\n\n179\n00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:18.050\nWell you're operating system's\nsoftware anyways, right.\n\n180\n00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:21.050\nSo the hypervisor allows\nyou that variability.\n\n181\n00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:24.757\nThat's good, everybody's going green\ntoday, wants to save power and\n\n182\n00:09:24.757 --> 00:09:27.790\nresources, right, electrical resources.\n\n183\n00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:31.300\nImagine having to have three physical\nmachines to do what you need to do here,\n\n184\n00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.930\nbut now we put it all\non a single machine and\n\n185\n00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:37.200\nwe start to get better\nresource utilization that way.\n\n186\n00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.490\nSo that's exactly right, Ronnie.\n\n187\n00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:43.350\nThe ability to run multiple instances\nof operating systems, side-by-side.\n\n188\n00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:44.680\nNow, where does this become beneficial?\n\n189\n00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.150\nLet's go ahead and\nget some of my crazy math out of here, and\n\n190\n00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:50.800\nkinda talk about where this\nwould become beneficial, right.\n\n191\n00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.970\nOn the original model if\nsomething went wrong,\n\n192\n00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:57.090\nthat problematic app cause, well it caused\na problem within the operating system,\n\n193\n00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:59.740\nit could crash the whole operating system.\n\n194\n00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.930\nBut now let's say that this\nis the same app up here and\n\n195\n00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.700\nnotice that it's isolated from\nall the other applications, and\n\n196\n00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.800\neven more importantly isolated between\nall the other operating systems.\n\n197\n00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:15.080\nSo if it becomes a problem,\nsure it might bring this one offline.\n\n198\n00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.610\nBut guess what, what's not gonna\naffect the two set next to it.\n\n199\n00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:22.910\nAnd this is where we talk about things\nbeing able to do things, for instance,\n\n200\n00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.171\nhaving develop environments, right.\n\n201\n00:10:25.171 --> 00:10:28.837\nI wanna test an application,\nI wanna see if an application can\n\n202\n00:10:28.837 --> 00:10:32.090\nrun well with inside the systems\nthat I have right now.\n\n203\n00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:38.250\nWell if I've got that virtualization\ntechnology, I can easily bring up, install\n\n204\n00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:42.310\nan operating system no different than\nyou would on any other physical machine.\n\n205\n00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:45.600\nBut now I can run that application, and\nif that application becomes problematic,\n\n206\n00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.870\nit brings that application down,\nit brings that operating system down.\n\n207\n00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:53.830\nBut since it's isolated from all\nthe other operating systems,\n\n208\n00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:54.770\nwe no longer have a problem.\n\n209\n00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.770\nAll right, so that's a little bit about\nwhy you would want virtualization.\n\n210\n00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:04.910\nAnd you know what Ronnie, that makes me\nthink about a topic that I kinda mention,\n\n211\n00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:06.600\nbut then I went right on pass it.\n\n212\n00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.260\nAnd we know, and\nRonnie's gonna remind me if i don't,\n\n213\n00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:13.076\nwe can't assume that you understand\nthe term type 1 and type 2.\n\n214\n00:11:13.076 --> 00:11:15.350\nSo if we can go back to\nmy diagram real quick,\n\n215\n00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:18.400\none of the things that I talked\nabout was the type 1 hypervisor.\n\n216\n00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.220\nWell, how do we,\nwhat do we compare that to?\n\n217\n00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.760\nWell a type 1 hypervisor is one\nthat you use in production,\n\n218\n00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:29.460\nas you can see how close to the hardware\nthis extra software layer works,\n\n219\n00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:32.840\nit gives you better performance,\nbetter utilization.\n\n220\n00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.805\nHowever, there are what\nare known as type 2.\n\n221\n00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:39.720\nAnd one of the big differences between\nthe type 2 hypervisor is you notice that\n\n222\n00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:42.550\nit still adds another layer.\n\n223\n00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:47.770\nBut notice that the layer is above\nthe traditional operating system, right.\n\n224\n00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:50.960\nNo different than the traditional\noperating system because now the type 2\n\n225\n00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.820\nhypervisor works like\nanother program side-by-side\n\n226\n00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:56.300\nwith things like Microsoft Paint\nif you will, Word, right.\n\n227\n00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:00.240\nIt's just another application running\non top of your operating system.\n\n228\n00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.680\nSo type 2 hypervisors,\n\n229\n00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.200\nthey don't do really good if you\nwill with the performance level and\n\n230\n00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.490\nit's typically something you're\nnot gonna see in production.\n\n231\n00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.830\nNotice that it doesn't say configure\nsomething other than Hyper-V.\n\n232\n00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:13.720\nIt says configure Hyper-V because that's\nwhat you are gonna see in production.\n\n233\n00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.550\nSo I just wanted to make mention of that,\nright.\n\n234\n00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:21.760\nThe old virtual PC that would have been\nan example of a type 2 hypervisor.\n\n235\n00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.400\nThere's other ones out there that you can\nbuy too VMware, Virtual Boxer's out there.\n\n236\n00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:30.100\nThese are applications essentially that\nallow you to virtualize your hardware.\n\n237\n00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.600\nBut they don't it in\nthe most efficient way.\n\n238\n00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.028\nSo again, I don't wanna just\nkinda breeze on past that.\n\n239\n00:12:35.028 --> 00:12:38.020\nRemember that Hyper-V and for\nthe purposes of what we're talking here,\n\n240\n00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:41.280\nthis is a type 1 hypervisor,\nwhich means it puts that\n\n241\n00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.200\nsoftware layer closest to the hardware\ngiving you better performance.\n\n242\n00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:50.470\nNow I wanna talk a little bit more\nabout some additional topics here.\n\n243\n00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:54.070\nI wanna kinda talk about how do\nwe install, how do this work?\n\n244\n00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:57.620\nWhat are the components that\nare inside of a virtual machine\n\n245\n00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:58.930\nthat we need to be aware of?\n\n246\n00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:02.050\nWell one of the things that we\nkind of have to be aware of\n\n247\n00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.830\nare what are known as virtual hard disks.\n\n248\n00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:05.970\nWith a virtual hard disk,\n\n249\n00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:08.880\nI want you to think of that physical\nhard drive if you've ever seen one.\n\n250\n00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.960\nIf not, I don't recommend you\npulling it out right now.\n\n251\n00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.440\nBut I mention a physical drive, right.\n\n252\n00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.120\nAnd what happens?\n\n253\n00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.880\nWe store information in that.\n\n254\n00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.890\nIt works just like you would think\nof with a file system, right,\n\n255\n00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:20.800\ntraditional disk operations.\n\n256\n00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:25.090\nWell part of the virtualization is\nthe fact that all of your hardware and\n\n257\n00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:29.200\nyour disk space, your storage,\nis all software based, right.\n\n258\n00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.290\nNow this gets a little confusing.\n\n259\n00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:32.810\nIt is stored on the physical machine.\n\n260\n00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:38.200\nBut imagine each one of those guest\nvirtual machines, those logical divisions,\n\n261\n00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.560\neach have a folder within them that\nworks and acts just like a hard drive.\n\n262\n00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:44.900\nThat's what a virtual hard disk is.\n\n263\n00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.600\nVirtual, just replace it in\nyour mind with software, right.\n\n264\n00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.680\nIt's not a physical device, but\nlooks like a folder to us, really.\n\n265\n00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:57.250\nBut inside of it, all the operations\nare just a traditional disk operations.\n\n266\n00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.490\nThere are two different types that\nI wanna make mention of here.\n\n267\n00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:02.280\nAnd you can see some of\nthe ones up here on the screen.\n\n268\n00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.265\nAll right, well there's really only two\nthat we have to worry about here in\n\n269\n00:14:05.265 --> 00:14:07.920\nHyper-V and\nthat is the older format known as VHD.\n\n270\n00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:11.902\nAll right VHD was one of the first\nformats that they used for\n\n271\n00:14:11.902 --> 00:14:13.744\nthe virtual hard disks, all right.\n\n272\n00:14:13.744 --> 00:14:16.830\nIt does have a scaling size\nas a limitation if you will.\n\n273\n00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:22.780\nYou can see with the 512 cluster size\nthat it doesn't scale up over 2 TB.\n\n274\n00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:25.920\nThat was good maybe five, six,\nseven years ago, it's not really good for\n\n275\n00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.000\ntoday's large drives, all right.\n\n276\n00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.110\nNo live resizing,\nactually gonna show you that.\n\n277\n00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.950\nThat's kinda cool, well it's not\ncool if you don't have the option,\n\n278\n00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:36.320\nbut comparative to the VHDX,\nyou're gonna see that's a real cool\n\n279\n00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.460\nfunctionality that was brought in\nwith the new format, all right.\n\n280\n00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.970\nI want you to keep in mind on the exam,\nif they throw a question at you,\n\n281\n00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:45.470\nVHD, it's only gonna work on,\nit's gonna work on Windows 7 and up.\n\n282\n00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.840\nBut here's where the exam alert comes in.\n\n283\n00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.894\nWhen you move to the new format the VHDX,\nall right.\n\n284\n00:14:51.894 --> 00:14:56.272\nYou got a smaller cluster size so\nit scales up to very large drives, right.\n\n285\n00:14:56.272 --> 00:14:58.950\n64 TB, fairly big drive.\n\n286\n00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:02.260\nI don't have any of those yet,\nbut it will happen.\n\n287\n00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.285\nThe other thing is, we're gonna\ntalk about what a checkpoint is,\n\n288\n00:15:05.285 --> 00:15:07.570\nit utilizes checkpoints better.\n\n289\n00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:11.930\nAnd the other thing is you\ncan do a live resizing,\n\n290\n00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:14.090\nwhich means if Ronnie comes to me and\nsays hey Wes,\n\n291\n00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:17.330\nI was just logged into our Hyper-V\nserver and I've noticed that the one\n\n292\n00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:23.030\nwe're running our database on the drive's\nstarting to get utilized too much.\n\n293\n00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:26.950\nI need you to go in there and\nI need you to make the drive,\n\n294\n00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:29.890\nthat folder,\nthe virtual hard disk, larger.\n\n295\n00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:33.750\nBut I can't have you turn that,\nlet's say database server off.\n\n296\n00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:36.140\nWell that's the ability,\nI go to the Hyper-V console, and\n\n297\n00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.670\nI can actually expand the size of\nthe drive while it's still running,\n\n298\n00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:40.440\nand then we don't lose\nany production time.\n\n299\n00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:44.690\nNow the next thing I want\nyou to keep in mind is that,\n\n300\n00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:48.190\nthere are a few different types of disks,\nall right.\n\n301\n00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:53.180\nThere's what's known as a fixed disk, and\nthere's what's known as a dynamic disk.\n\n302\n00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.211\nLets talk about the fixed disk.\n\n303\n00:15:54.211 --> 00:15:57.665\nThis might be something of a concept\nyou're a little more familiar with\n\n304\n00:15:57.665 --> 00:16:00.616\nbecause of the fact that you\nprobably deal with it every day.\n\n305\n00:16:00.616 --> 00:16:03.585\nWhen I install a hard drive\nphysically in the machine, right, and\n\n306\n00:16:03.585 --> 00:16:05.236\nI install an operating system on it.\n\n307\n00:16:05.236 --> 00:16:08.408\nThe total capacity of that\ndrive is allocated right there.\n\n308\n00:16:08.408 --> 00:16:11.770\nThat operating has, right?\n\n309\n00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:13.020\nWell, I just wanna fix this disk.\n\n310\n00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:17.000\nWhen you create a virtual hard\ndisk that is a fixed disk.\n\n311\n00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.990\nIt means if I create one that's 60 gigs,\ninstantly,\n\n312\n00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:23.060\n60 gigs is reserved just for\nthat hard drive.\n\n313\n00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:23.859\nThat virtual hard disk.\n\n314\n00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.940\nHowever, there's also something called\na dynamic disk, and this is good for\n\n315\n00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.350\nthings like testing environments.\n\n316\n00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:33.780\nWhen you're trying to utilize,\nmore efficiently your storage,\n\n317\n00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.240\nthat you have on your machine.\n\n318\n00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.080\nYou could say, I know I'm not gonna use\nthis in a production environment, so\n\n319\n00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.430\nI don't really worry too\nmuch about stability,\n\n320\n00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:42.535\nwhich fix disks tend to give you.\n\n321\n00:16:42.535 --> 00:16:44.000\nBut I do worry about storage.\n\n322\n00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.370\nI can say the same size drive is\ngonna be 60 gigs, and guess what?\n\n323\n00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:51.950\nIt's only gonna consume what\nI'm utilizing at that time,\n\n324\n00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:56.350\nand over time it gets to\nexpanding to a maximum of 60 gigs.\n\n325\n00:16:56.350 --> 00:17:01.290\nSo this is good if you've got a HyperV\nserver that is just running demonstration,\n\n326\n00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:03.430\ndevelopment machines, all right?\n\n327\n00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:07.410\nBecause I wanna utilize the space,\nthat they're consuming at the time.\n\n328\n00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:11.710\nAnd the dynamic aspect is that over time,\nin this case, this example,\n\n329\n00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:12.950\nthat can grow up to 60 gigs.\n\n330\n00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:16.770\nAll right, what's next?\n\n331\n00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:21.690\nI think I'm gonna leave\nthe virtual switches here, and\n\n332\n00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:24.210\nI wanna talk a little\nbit about a checkpoint.\n\n333\n00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.281\nAll right.\nThat's the other big thing that we need to\n\n334\n00:17:26.281 --> 00:17:27.500\ntalk about.\n\n335\n00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:28.270\nWhat is a checkpoint?\n\n336\n00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:31.280\nYou might have heard them call snapshots\nin the earlier version to hyper v,\n\n337\n00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.630\ntoday they call checkpoints.\n\n338\n00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:35.190\nGuys, don't worry about the terminology,\nthey're one in the same.\n\n339\n00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.560\nAll right.\n\n340\n00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:40.390\nImagine when you make changes,\nsystem changes,\n\n341\n00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:44.350\ninstalling application, you don't have\nhyper v, you don't have virtualization.\n\n342\n00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:47.500\nWhat happens when that application becomes\nproblematic, it crashes your system, and\n\n343\n00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:48.030\nnow what do you do?\n\n344\n00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:54.930\nWell, if you're doing what you're supposed\nto be doing, we are high on a back up, and\n\n345\n00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.832\nwe reinstall our operating system\nworse maybe a system restore.\n\n346\n00:17:57.832 --> 00:18:00.190\nWell a lot of time and\neffort goes into that.\n\n347\n00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:01.630\nAlright.\n\n348\n00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:05.980\nNow, imagine the ability to\ncreate a point in time snapshot,\n\n349\n00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:09.910\nthat captures system state data.\n\n350\n00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:15.050\nThe memory, the running configuration at\nthe time you create the snapshot, and\n\n351\n00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:17.320\nthe new boot up the machine.\n\n352\n00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.730\nAnd you make some changes,\n\n353\n00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:22.240\nyou install an application,\nyou make another change, right?\n\n354\n00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.130\nYou configure that application, and\n\n355\n00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:29.540\nall of the sudden here at last\nthe application becomes problematic.\n\n356\n00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:33.700\nOne of the greatest thing about\ncheckpoints, is when they do become\n\n357\n00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:38.050\nproblematic, and\nI need to revert to an earlier point time.\n\n358\n00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.400\nI don't have to pull out my backup tapes,\n\n359\n00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:45.205\nI don't have to pull out my backup media,\nI don't have to use system restore.\n\n360\n00:18:45.205 --> 00:18:50.530\nIn fact, what I can do is I\ncan restore that configuration\n\n361\n00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:55.100\nto the previous configuration that it\nwas the moment I took the snapshot.\n\n362\n00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:55.820\nAnd that's very good.\n\n363\n00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.010\nAnd that's one of the great\nthings about using Hyper-V for\n\n364\n00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:59.920\nthe purposes of development.\n\n365\n00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.410\nApplication testing, right?\n\n366\n00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:05.380\nWe wanna test it in a lab environment\nbefore we roll it down to our production\n\n367\n00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.070\nnetwork, so we don't have these problems.\n\n368\n00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:10.320\nAnd when you roll back your checkpoint,\none ends up happening.\n\n369\n00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.800\nSo like those configurations\nnever existed.\n\n370\n00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.430\nSo that's one of the great things\nabout utilizing checkpoints\n\n371\n00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:20.100\nin your virtual hard disk files.\n\n372\n00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:24.490\nIs the fact that instead of kinda like\nyour V8, your get out of jail free.\n\n373\n00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:26.325\nNow Ronnie,\nI know I've talked a lot about it.\n\n374\n00:19:26.325 --> 00:19:29.010\nSo how about we go ahead,\nand we dive in, and\n\n375\n00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:31.660\nmaybe show you a little bit\nabout the Hyper-V console.\n\n376\n00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:33.230\n&gt;&gt; Well Wes,\nthat's actually a great point.\n\n377\n00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:36.720\nWe understand now the very basics\nof what we need to do, but\n\n378\n00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.740\nwe're not exactly sure\nhow we would create it.\n\n379\n00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.210\nBecause a lot of times there\nmaybe other questions.\n\n380\n00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:45.440\nYou might be saying, I know now what I\nneed to do, but how do we get started?\n\n381\n00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:49.120\nWes, how do we get started in\nterms of actually finding?\n\n382\n00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.280\nIs it a separate product I have to buy?\n\n383\n00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.480\nWhat's going on here?\n\n384\n00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.652\n&gt;&gt; You know, I'm glad you asked that cuz I\nalmost forgot to let you guys [LAUGH] know\n\n385\n00:19:55.652 --> 00:19:57.930\nout there that it's built\ninto your operating system.\n\n386\n00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:58.830\nNow it used to be,\n\n387\n00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:02.535\nand I wanna say this was Windows 7, it\nwasn't included in the operating system.\n\n388\n00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:03.630\nAnd if you were gonna use hyper V,\n\n389\n00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:07.430\nyou have to jump over\nthe server to be able to do it.\n\n390\n00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:11.900\nAs of Windows 8.1 they said you know what\nas we go ahead let's put that hyper V\n\n391\n00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:12.990\nright in the client.\n\n392\n00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:17.000\nThey say, why is it so beneficial.\n\n393\n00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.980\nWell exactly what we're\ngonna show you here.\n\n394\n00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:23.020\nThe ability to use the same interface\nthat you would use on a server,\n\n395\n00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:26.090\nbecome familiar with it, and\nit translates between the two.\n\n396\n00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:27.020\nSo let's go ahead.\n\n397\n00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.430\nNo more talking, let me dive in here now.\n\n398\n00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:32.860\nI want you guys to know, let me show\nyou real quick, I've already done this.\n\n399\n00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.790\nSo you guys don't have to wait.\n\n400\n00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:38.240\nThe way you get hyper v\ninstalled enough and running,\n\n401\n00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.640\nit's actually a feature that's\ndisabled by default, all right?\n\n402\n00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:45.790\nAnd if we drilled out in here to turn\non Windows features, or turn them on or\n\n403\n00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:51.000\noff, you'll notice that this is\nwhere your options are, right?\n\n404\n00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.860\nAnd you can see here that I've got\na couple of check marks in there,\n\n405\n00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:55.718\nand hopefully guys can see that,\nall right?\n\n406\n00:20:55.718 --> 00:20:59.310\nThat's the Hyper-V Management Tools,\nand the Hyper-V Platform.\n\n407\n00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:00.790\nIsn't turned on by default.\n\n408\n00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:01.800\nSo you have to do that.\n\n409\n00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.360\nIt'll make some changes, and\nthen it'll reboot the system.\n\n410\n00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:08.820\nGuys, it's as simple as that as\nfar as getting it up and running.\n\n411\n00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.600\n&gt;&gt; Now, Wes, I've seen this before, but\n\n412\n00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:15.390\nI've also seen it grayed out where I\ncouldn't actually put a check mark in it.\n\n413\n00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:16.422\nWhat's that about?\n\n414\n00:21:16.422 --> 00:21:17.491\n&gt;&gt; That's very good.\n\n415\n00:21:17.491 --> 00:21:20.610\nThat is due to the requirements\nto run Hyper-V.\n\n416\n00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:22.120\nIf you're gonna configure Hyper -V,\n\n417\n00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.960\nit might be a good idea to know\nwhat you need in order to run it.\n\n418\n00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:29.060\nOne of the things that you're gonna need,\nis platform specific.\n\n419\n00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:31.370\nYou need a 64 bit operating system.\n\n420\n00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:34.280\nAnd even more so, you need an operating\nsystem that supports something known as\n\n421\n00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.600\nSLAT, second level address translation.\n\n422\n00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.280\nThat is important.\n\n423\n00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.270\nThat's where that Hyper-V communication\nbetween the operating system, and\n\n424\n00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:41.760\nthe hardware happens.\n\n425\n00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.740\nSo that is important.\n\n426\n00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:43.780\nRemember that.\n\n427\n00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:45.160\nThe other thing that keep in mind too,\n\n428\n00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:49.990\nis you need the resources in order\nto support the Hyper-V Platform.\n\n429\n00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:51.820\nSo if you have four gigs\nof RAM in your machine,\n\n430\n00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:55.660\nchances are you're not gonna be\nrunning hyper-v too well because\n\n431\n00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:59.110\nall of the additional operating systems\nthat you install require their resources.\n\n432\n00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:02.300\nAnd last but not the least,\none of the things that I would mention is,\n\n433\n00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.860\npay attention to the addition\nof windows that you have.\n\n434\n00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:08.120\nAnd if you have Windows 10 home,\nyou don't have access to this.\n\n435\n00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.900\nYou need the Pro, and\nyou need the enterprise edition.\n\n436\n00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.150\nThat is important, all right?\n\n437\n00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:13.260\nAnd remember that for the exam.\n\n438\n00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:17.160\nIf you have those, you'll notice\nthat they won't be grayed out, and\n\n439\n00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.040\nyou can do what we've\nalready done here for you.\n\n440\n00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.455\nYou could turn them on.\n\n441\n00:22:20.455 --> 00:22:21.119\nAll right.\n\n442\n00:22:21.119 --> 00:22:25.113\nOnce you do that, like I said, you'll\nsee that it just applies the requested\n\n443\n00:22:25.113 --> 00:22:27.970\nchanges, and it reboots the machine.\n\n444\n00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:30.260\nAnd then if you look\ndown on your Start menu,\n\n445\n00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:33.540\nscroll all the way down to the bottom\nto Windows Administrative Tools,\n\n446\n00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.090\nyou should see that Hyper-V's in the list.\n\n447\n00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:41.020\nNow, Ronnie, I would forget my head\nif it wasn't attached at the neck.\n\n448\n00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:44.130\nSo I actually put it in the task bar here\nso I can find it a little bit easier.\n\n449\n00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:46.400\nBut know where it is, just in case.\n\n450\n00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.643\nAnd this is the Hyper V interface,\nall right?\n\n451\n00:22:48.643 --> 00:22:52.068\nThere's two different interfaces\nthat I kinda want you guys to see,\n\n452\n00:22:52.068 --> 00:22:56.440\nwhich we gonna take a look at, and then\nwe're, we'll kinda talk about them here.\n\n453\n00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:01.530\nThe first one is the Client or\nthe Hype V's settings themselves.\n\n454\n00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:06.330\nIf I'm up here at client 01,\nI want you know that this is my machine.\n\n455\n00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:12.080\nIf I right click on client01, you're gonna\nnotice that we have a series of options.\n\n456\n00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:17.060\nWe have the ability to manage Hyper-V\nSettings, our Virtual Switch Manager,\n\n457\n00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:20.740\nwhich I'll talk about that coming up,\nrather than just giving a diagram here.\n\n458\n00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:23.580\nAnd then, you can also create\nthings like Virtual SAN.\n\n459\n00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:25.800\nBut, the one that I really wanna look is,\nwell,\n\n460\n00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.390\nthe Hyper-V Settings themselves,\nall right?\n\n461\n00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:33.480\nVery basically guys, what this does\nis it gives us a chance to configure,\n\n462\n00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:37.080\nyou can leave the defaults, or configure\nwhere Hyper-V is Virtual Disks, and\n\n463\n00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.770\nVirtual Machines are stored.\n\n464\n00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:43.720\nYou can also manage additional\nHost configuration.\n\n465\n00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.540\nNot the each individual machine,\nbut this is the actual host itself,\n\n466\n00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:50.160\nthat's running the hypervisor or\nthe Hyper-V, itself.\n\n467\n00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.070\nAll right.\n\n468\n00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:55.223\nAnd then some more, if you will,\nadvanced configurations.\n\n469\n00:23:55.223 --> 00:24:01.225\nYou also have session,\nwhat your input is, and that's great.\n\n470\n00:24:01.225 --> 00:24:04.185\nThese are global options\nacross all of your machines.\n\n471\n00:24:04.185 --> 00:24:07.625\nAll right Now,\nthe next thing we wanna look at,\n\n472\n00:24:07.625 --> 00:24:10.970\nis where the Virtual Machines are stored.\n\n473\n00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:12.060\nThese are your Virtual Machines.\n\n474\n00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:15.041\nNow, by default,\nyou won't have these here.\n\n475\n00:24:15.041 --> 00:24:18.836\nWe went ahead and took the time to create\nsome of these, so that they'd be ready for\n\n476\n00:24:18.836 --> 00:24:19.947\nyou, here in the show.\n\n477\n00:24:19.947 --> 00:24:22.610\nBut understand that that\ndialog box will be blank.\n\n478\n00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:29.450\nIf I wanna create a Virtual Machine,\nI have the actions playing over here.\n\n479\n00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:34.440\nNow, this is very simply, no different\nthen if I was to come over here and\n\n480\n00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:38.390\nright click, you might see that\nnew option that was up on the top.\n\n481\n00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:41.610\nSo there's couple different ways,\nyou can get this done.\n\n482\n00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:43.958\nI don't know why, I grabbed the tape\ntowards the action playing here.\n\n483\n00:24:43.958 --> 00:24:47.661\nBut you can see, we have the ability\nto create a Virtual Machine.\n\n484\n00:24:47.661 --> 00:24:50.270\nA hard disk and a floppy disk.\n\n485\n00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:54.170\nNow, you might say well, [LAUGH] floppy\ndisk that crazy, who uses those?\n\n486\n00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:56.690\nWell, floppy is easier to\nvirtualize than USB is.\n\n487\n00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:59.470\nUSB doesn't do virtualization,\n\n488\n00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:01.740\nwhen it comes to creating\nlike a virtualized drive.\n\n489\n00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:03.184\nSo we virtualize, floppy disks a lot.\n\n490\n00:25:03.184 --> 00:25:06.034\nHowever, I can't create just a hard drive,\n\n491\n00:25:06.034 --> 00:25:09.419\nif I know that I don't have a machine,\nhere locally.\n\n492\n00:25:09.419 --> 00:25:14.060\nBut maybe I'm gonna pull one off of my\nenvironment, from the server environment.\n\n493\n00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.028\nWell, I can just attach\nthe virtual hard disk.\n\n494\n00:25:16.028 --> 00:25:17.674\nOr, we could create it from the ground up.\n\n495\n00:25:17.674 --> 00:25:21.098\nAnd if we create it from the ground up,\njust select Virtual Machine.\n\n496\n00:25:23.937 --> 00:25:26.560\nNow, we got this nice little wizard here.\n\n497\n00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:31.030\nAnd, the wizard is fairly intuitive.\n\n498\n00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:32.780\nIt walks you step by step.\n\n499\n00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.070\nRead this information if you're studying.\n\n500\n00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:39.560\nRead this information if maybe you forgot,\nnot here in the episode, but\n\n501\n00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:42.320\ndefinitely make use of it.\n\n502\n00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.910\nIt's here for a good reason.\n\n503\n00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:46.050\nAnd what we're gonna do here,\nis we're gonna just walk through this and\n\n504\n00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:46.720\nit's gonna tell me.\n\n505\n00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:48.790\nWhat's the name?\n\n506\n00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:53.100\nAnd we'll call this tes.\n\n507\n00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:54.830\nCuz I'm so creative.\n\n508\n00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:58.640\nNow, if you create it from here,\nit stores it in the machine and\n\n509\n00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.750\nthe default location.\n\n510\n00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:02.520\nHowever, you can see right here,\nthat you do have the ability,\n\n511\n00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.960\nthat you can modify\nthese default locations.\n\n512\n00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.140\nFor the test or for\nour purposes here Ronnie,\n\n513\n00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:10.170\nI'm gonna keep it in the default\nlocation and choose next.\n\n514\n00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:10.700\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n515\n00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.910\n&gt;&gt; Now,\nhere's one thing that I didn't mention,\n\n516\n00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:15.250\nbecause I want you to\nsee it here in action.\n\n517\n00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:16.910\nGen 1, gen 2.\n\n518\n00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:20.120\nGeneration 1, Virtual Machines are ones\nthat do have some limitations,\n\n519\n00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:23.730\nand they're limited to things\nlike traditional bios settings.\n\n520\n00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:26.130\nHowever, you have gen 2.\n\n521\n00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:28.790\nAnd gen 2, gives you a lot of features.\n\n522\n00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:30.110\nFor instance, the UEFI,\n\n523\n00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:33.340\nthe Unified Extensible Firmware Interface\nsecure boot, things like that.\n\n524\n00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:38.460\nIt brings again, a lot more support.\n\n525\n00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:41.290\nHowever, you have to configure this now.\n\n526\n00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:42.131\nSo, make up your mind here.\n\n527\n00:26:42.131 --> 00:26:43.614\nThis isn't something,\nyou can go back and change.\n\n528\n00:26:43.614 --> 00:26:46.338\nLike you are gonna see,\nwe can modify some of the settings,\n\n529\n00:26:46.338 --> 00:26:49.080\nafter the fact when we usually do,\nbut this one you cannot.\n\n530\n00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.720\nThen we can configure it's,\nstartup memory.\n\n531\n00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.510\nHow much memory do we want to have,\nin this machine?\n\n532\n00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:58.938\nWell how much memory you\nallocate to this machine,\n\n533\n00:26:58.938 --> 00:27:02.213\nis really contingent on how much\nmemory you have in your machine, and\n\n534\n00:27:02.213 --> 00:27:04.480\nversus all the other\nguest operating systems.\n\n535\n00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.800\nI'm gonna keep this one low.\n\n536\n00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:08.160\nI know, I got plenty of memory in here and\nnothing's running.\n\n537\n00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.640\nGot 16 gigs, but we'll go ahead and\nleave it at the gig.\n\n538\n00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.260\nWhat's this Dynamic Memory mean?\n\n539\n00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:15.920\nWell, much like our dynamic disks,\n\n540\n00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.310\nthat only utilize the drive capacity and\nthey expand up.\n\n541\n00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:21.550\nWell, Dynamic Memory does the same.\n\n542\n00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:25.420\nIf your computer currently isn't using\nthat memory, well, dynamic memory says,\n\n543\n00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:28.750\ngo ahead and free it up for\nthe hypervisor and it can allocate it.\n\n544\n00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:32.490\nAnd when I need it, might grow up to\nthat one gig that we're giving it.\n\n545\n00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:35.420\nWe'll choose, Next.\n\n546\n00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:38.720\nNow, here's the next thing that we have.\n\n547\n00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.330\nThe ability to connect\nto a virtualized switch.\n\n548\n00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:45.910\nVirtualized switches,\nyou're gonna have network communications.\n\n549\n00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:48.170\nThese work just like physical machines,\n\n550\n00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:52.530\nbut there are three types of virtual\nswitches, that I want you to be aware of.\n\n551\n00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:54.610\nThe one that I've created here,\nis called a private switch.\n\n552\n00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:58.220\nI've named it that way, just so\nI could keep track of what it is.\n\n553\n00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:01.480\nIt's a name, it's an arbitrary name, but\nthe switch itself is called private,\n\n554\n00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:05.410\nbecause it only allows\nthe Virtual Machines to communicate,\n\n555\n00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:06.100\namongst each other.\n\n556\n00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:10.730\nNow, I couldn't create something,\nknown as an internal switch.\n\n557\n00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:12.790\nThe internal switch allows\nthe Virtual Machines,\n\n558\n00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:15.230\njust like any network communication,\nto communicate together.\n\n559\n00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:20.100\nBut they can also, communicate\nwith the host that's running them.\n\n560\n00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.880\nLast but not least, is an external switch.\n\n561\n00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:25.430\nAnd an external switch, is one that you\ncan create, you give your Virtual Machines\n\n562\n00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:28.290\naccess to the network, like any other\nphysical machine that you walked over,\n\n563\n00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:30.580\nto the drop panel and plugged it in.\n\n564\n00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:31.440\nSo that's also good,\n\n565\n00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:35.610\nif you need to communicate just normally,\nif you're maybe testing.\n\n566\n00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:36.900\nSo, I'll go ahead.\n\n567\n00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.020\nI'm gonna connect it to the private\nswitch, and I'm gonna choose Next.\n\n568\n00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.990\nAnd I want you to notice something here.\n\n569\n00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:44.660\nWe use this option, to create a VHDX.\n\n570\n00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:50.850\nIf you want to attach to\nan old Virtual Hard Disk,\n\n571\n00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:54.310\nthe VHD file format,\nyou have to create the disk first.\n\n572\n00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:55.900\nIt does what you do it,\nfrom this interface and\n\n573\n00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.910\nthen you attach the disk after.\n\n574\n00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:00.362\nAnd you could see this,\nthat's where I could do that.\n\n575\n00:29:00.362 --> 00:29:03.160\nI can attach it to an existing\nVirtual Hard Disk.\n\n576\n00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:07.770\nHowever, it lets me know, that if you\nare gonna use this first option here.\n\n577\n00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:10.210\nYou're gonna use the VHDX file.\n\n578\n00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:12.830\nAnd it says that,\nwe can allocate 127 gigs.\n\n579\n00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:18.800\nI'm gonna give 40 gigs,\nand then I'll choose Next.\n\n580\n00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.590\nAnd here's where we can install,\n\n581\n00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:24.650\nan operating system right\nnow if we wanted to.\n\n582\n00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:31.860\nSo, I could attach an ISO, in fact, let\nme see if we can browse to an ISO here.\n\n583\n00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:32.763\nAnd we'll attach it.\n\n584\n00:29:35.802 --> 00:29:40.420\nSo we we'll get down here, I'm not\nsure if I have an ISO in this machine.\n\n585\n00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:41.890\nWe'll put DVD in later here.\n\n586\n00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:44.915\nNow, the good thing is, as you can.\n\n587\n00:29:44.915 --> 00:29:47.235\nSee it, I don't have the ISO ready to go.\n\n588\n00:29:47.235 --> 00:29:49.055\nThis would be no different than later on,\n\n589\n00:29:49.055 --> 00:29:52.725\nif I want to attach the ISO to\nthe machine and do the installation.\n\n590\n00:29:52.725 --> 00:29:53.902\nWe'll go ahead and leave it blank now.\n\n591\n00:29:53.902 --> 00:29:56.834\nWe've got our summary pane and\nwe've finished.\n\n592\n00:29:56.834 --> 00:29:58.965\nIt's configuring the memory.\n\n593\n00:29:58.965 --> 00:30:02.520\nAnd just like that,\nI've got a Virtual Machine ready to go.\n\n594\n00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:05.140\nThat all I need to do,\nis install an operating system.\n\n595\n00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:07.960\nAnd the installation is no\ndifferent than what you'll see,\n\n596\n00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:11.420\nin our installation\nepisode here in the MTA.\n\n597\n00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:15.070\nNow, the other thing that we can do,\nfor instance.\n\n598\n00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:18.120\nIs, we can modify settings after the fact.\n\n599\n00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:22.050\nSo in one of my machines here, if I\nright click on it and I choose Settings,\n\n600\n00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:27.430\nI have all different kinds of things, that\nwe can add or configure after the fact.\n\n601\n00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:29.640\nI can add a different drive,\nif I wanted to.\n\n602\n00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:35.770\nIf I select SCSI Controller, notice that\nit gives me the ability to put in another\n\n603\n00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:40.200\nvirtualized optical drive,\nor hard drive, if you will.\n\n604\n00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.830\nIf I decide that I've given it,\nallocated it, memory, but\n\n605\n00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:45.750\nthe memory wasn't good enough for\nthe system in my testing.\n\n606\n00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:47.250\nI can come back here and I can add,\n\n607\n00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:49.890\nI can say, sorry,\none gig just [LAUGH] didn't work.\n\n608\n00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:51.970\nI can adjust it that fast.\n\n609\n00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:55.520\nSo, notice that you get the benefits\nof being able to allocate the memory\n\n610\n00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.860\non the fly like that,\njust the way you want.\n\n611\n00:30:57.860 --> 00:30:58.660\nAnd that's very good,\n\n612\n00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:01.230\nwhere we wouldn't have it,\nif we didn't have our hypervisors.\n\n613\n00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:05.200\nNow, I'll show you one more thing here.\n\n614\n00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.027\nAnd.\n\n615\n00:31:07.364 --> 00:31:08.794\nI know Ronnie's, giving me that eye.\n\n616\n00:31:08.794 --> 00:31:10.520\nIt's about time to wrap this one up.\n\n617\n00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:16.900\nSo, I wanna show you real quick,\nthe live Resizing.\n\n618\n00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:21.348\nMy app 2 legacy if I kinda zoom\nin here and show you guys,\n\n619\n00:31:21.348 --> 00:31:25.050\nI want you to see that\nit's got the VHD format.\n\n620\n00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:29.286\nVHD, doesn't allow the ability to resize,\nit while it's turned on.\n\n621\n00:31:29.286 --> 00:31:32.600\nLet me go ahead and show you guys,\nhow I even start one of these machines.\n\n622\n00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:36.330\nWell, you can right click on it and\nyou can choose Start.\n\n623\n00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:39.530\nBoy, wasn't that amazing?\n\n624\n00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:41.780\nWe can see that it's running now,\nbut what happen?\n\n625\n00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:42.890\nWhere is it?\n\n626\n00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:46.010\nWell, it's running in the background and\nyou actually have to connect to it, and\n\n627\n00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:47.400\nthat's the other option.\n\n628\n00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:52.017\nIf we right click on and choose Connect,\nthat's a little different here.\n\n629\n00:31:52.017 --> 00:31:57.258\nAnd what you can see,\nis that I'm running an operating system,\n\n630\n00:31:57.258 --> 00:32:00.084\non top of my Windows 10 desktop.\n\n631\n00:32:00.084 --> 00:32:03.919\nThat's where the benefit comes in,\nof running virtualization technologies.\n\n632\n00:32:03.919 --> 00:32:06.696\nAll right, and\nlet me go ahead and connect.\n\n633\n00:32:06.696 --> 00:32:10.170\nAnd I'm actually running a server here,\nall right?\n\n634\n00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:13.620\nNow that being said, let's go ahead and\ngo back to the Hyper-V.\n\n635\n00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:18.220\nAnd let's say that scenario that I set up\nearlier where Ronnie calls me and says,\n\n636\n00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:19.860\nhey, Wes, I need you to resize it.\n\n637\n00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:20.868\nRemember that database?\n\n638\n00:32:20.868 --> 00:32:24.170\nIt's growing and it needs a bigger hard\ndrive, right, or needs more space.\n\n639\n00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:29.798\nSo I right-click and I choose Settings,\nand I go into Hard Drive.\n\n640\n00:32:32.369 --> 00:32:33.480\nAnd everything's grayed out.\n\n641\n00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:38.220\nYou don't get the ability with a VHD file,\nall right?\n\n642\n00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:44.260\nNow, let me go ahead and\nlet's see what we can do with app1.\n\n643\n00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.905\nAnd while that's booting up,\nlet me go and start it.\n\n644\n00:32:46.905 --> 00:32:51.130\nWhile that's happening in the background,\nlet me show you this type of hard drive.\n\n645\n00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:57.941\nRight, the defaults that we showed you\nhow to configure here in this episode,\n\n646\n00:32:57.941 --> 00:33:01.100\nI used a VHDX, no different, all right?\n\n647\n00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:05.235\nNow, let's go ahead and connect to it\njust to verify that it is running.\n\n648\n00:33:05.235 --> 00:33:08.120\nYou can see it's running here\nin the background, right?\n\n649\n00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.320\nAll right, now I can log in if I wanted.\n\n650\n00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:15.760\nSo let me go ahead, see if I can remember\nthe super secret Microsoft password there.\n\n651\n00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.620\nAnd now, get the same call.\n\n652\n00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:21.450\nRonnie says,\nI need you to resize that drive.\n\n653\n00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:24.689\nSo I come in here and I pick the hard\ndrive and I want you to notice something.\n\n654\n00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.840\nNotice this isn't grayed out\nlike it was in the VHD file.\n\n655\n00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:31.700\nSo I could come in here and\nI could say, Edit.\n\n656\n00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:36.540\nRight, Locate the Disk, and\n\n657\n00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:41.530\nit lets me know that this isn't something\nyou should do on all the time, right?\n\n658\n00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:43.550\nNotice it says Expand.\n\n659\n00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:45.470\nAnd I want to expand the disk?\n\n660\n00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:47.996\nWell, current size is 20 gigs.\n\n661\n00:33:47.996 --> 00:33:50.488\nI decide 40 gigs.\n\n662\n00:33:50.488 --> 00:33:55.970\nWe'll choose Next, and\nwe'll choose Finish.\n\n663\n00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:59.110\nAnd just like that, I've dynamically\nresized that hard drive and\n\n664\n00:33:59.110 --> 00:33:59.859\nI now have more space.\n\n665\n00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:03.490\nSo Ronnie, as you can see,\nHyper-V is a great platform.\n\n666\n00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:08.090\nIt allows you the ability to allocate the\nresources that you need that you consume\n\n667\n00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:09.090\non a computer.\n\n668\n00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:13.240\nIt also allows you for development,\nit allows you to test applications.\n\n669\n00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:15.720\nI don't have to worry about\nresizing my operating system.\n\n670\n00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:18.430\nAnd I will tell you one more\nthing that I didn't mention.\n\n671\n00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:20.420\nWhat if I wanna do a checkpoint?\n\n672\n00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:24.420\nLet me show you how, real quick,\nthat before we call it there, all right?\n\n673\n00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:28.380\nA checkpoint, again,\nis that point in time snapshot, all right?\n\n674\n00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:33.974\nIf I right-click and I choose Checkpoint,\ngive it a second there.\n\n675\n00:34:33.974 --> 00:34:37.426\nAnd I'll go ahead and\ndo a checkpoint on this one as well, and\n\n676\n00:34:37.426 --> 00:34:40.430\nwe'll give it just a second there.\n\n677\n00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:43.500\nAnd it says Production Checkpoint Created.\n\n678\n00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:48.220\nIt didn't tell me on the other one,\nbecause of the fact that well, guess what?\n\n679\n00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:54.250\nThe earlier file formats don't\nreally do good with checkpoints.\n\n680\n00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:57.110\nYou can create them, but\nthey're not good in production.\n\n681\n00:34:57.110 --> 00:35:01.620\nAnd now what I have is if I was to install\nan application and that application\n\n682\n00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:08.780\nbecomes a problem, I can come back here\nand I could apply this checkpoint.\n\n683\n00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:12.830\nAnd it basically applies the configuration\nfiles that were there at the point that\n\n684\n00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:17.451\nthis machine's checkpoint was created,\nallowing me to get around those\n\n685\n00:35:17.451 --> 00:35:22.136\nlengthy reinstall processes,\nreconfiguring your applications.\n\n686\n00:35:22.136 --> 00:35:24.812\nSo again, great product.\n\n687\n00:35:24.812 --> 00:35:27.520\nUtilize it if you've got your\nWindows 10 Pro machines,\n\n688\n00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:30.000\nif you've got your\nWindows Enterprise machines.\n\n689\n00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.675\nGet it in there and utilize it.\n\n690\n00:35:31.675 --> 00:35:35.969\nYou can get things like trial\nsoftware from Microsoft and\n\n691\n00:35:35.969 --> 00:35:41.910\nyou can get your Windows 10 Enterprise\ntrial, you can get Server 2016.\n\n692\n00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:45.700\nAnd you can really explore, and that's one\nof the great things is not only doesn't\n\n693\n00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:48.480\nbenefit you in production and like what\nwe have talked about, it will also\n\n694\n00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:52.426\nbenefit you in your studies as you\nprogress forward in the MTA certification.\n\n695\n00:35:52.426 --> 00:35:54.806\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes,\nwell thank you again for\n\n696\n00:35:54.806 --> 00:35:59.313\nhelping us to understand a little bit\nmore about the ideas of virtualization.\n\n697\n00:35:59.313 --> 00:36:04.007\nSpecifically in the realm of using\nMicrosoft's Hyper-V that normally we can\n\n698\n00:36:04.007 --> 00:36:08.058\nfind not only in the server products,\nbut now today of course even in\n\n699\n00:36:08.058 --> 00:36:12.822\nthe actual desktop environment when we\nsee Windows 8.1 or even Windows 8 and\n\n700\n00:36:12.822 --> 00:36:14.890\neven Windows 10 as well.\n\n701\n00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:18.870\nSo those will help you at least to get\nstarted in this world of virtualization,\n\n702\n00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:21.500\nwhich you'll see throughout\nthe entire IT world.\n\n703\n00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:26.190\nAnd so, it'll get that momentum going and\nmaybe actually end up finding something\n\n704\n00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:27.920\nnew that you haven't\nbeen able to do before,\n\n705\n00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:32.020\nwhich is run multiple operating systems\non a single piece of hardware, as well.\n\n706\n00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:35.000\nWell, that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode, then.\n\n707\n00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.250\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n708\n00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:39.360\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n709\n00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:42.831\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more\nWindows System Operating Fundamentals.\n\n710\n00:36:42.831 --> 00:36:50.038\n[MUSIC]\n\n711\n00:36:50.038 --> 00:36:52.680\n&gt;&gt; Thank you

These features help with extending battery life and staying connected to resources such as other computers and even files when there is no connection to the network, according to the team.  They demonstrate the use of Remote Desktop Connection, using the Mobility Center and how to Synchronize files when the mobile device and network resource is connected back to the network.",

00:00:15.030\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.705\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\n\n5\n00:00:16.705 --> 00:00:20.950\ntoday we're taking a look at\nWindows Operating System Fundamentals.\n\n6\n00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.630\nWe're specifically going to be diving\ninto some of the different mobility\n\n7\n00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.750\nsettings that you need to be aware of\nin the Windows operating system, and\n\n8\n00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.780\nhere to help us out is going to be Mr.\nWes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:29.890\nWes, welcome back to our show.\n\n10\n00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:30.940\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.050\nAs always, it's great to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.200\nAnd, that's right, we're going to be\ntalking about, well, something in Windows\n\n13\n00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.550\nthat's been there for a while, and that's\nsomething known as the Mobility Center.\n\n14\n00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.290\nAnd, it's a very handy tool that you\n\n15\n00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.850\nshould have access to if you have a laptop\nor you have a tablet of some sort.\n\n16\n00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.050\nNow, if you have a desktop,\nyou might not see this.\n\n17\n00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.610\nAnd that's because well, the Mobility\nCenter is geared around those devices that\n\n18\n00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.610\nwe have to worry about\nreally one major thing.\n\n19\n00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.730\nAnd that is power, right, the power\nconservation cuz with any mobile device,\n\n20\n00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.210\nwe really have two things.\n\n21\n00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.690\nIf you remember from back to like\nsome of your hardware fundamentals,\n\n22\n00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.630\nyou remember the two main things and\nmobility is, any kind of mobile device is\n\n23\n00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.240\ngonna be things like heat, generating\nheat and then power consumption.\n\n24\n00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.790\nWe don't want to lose battery life\nright in the middle of things\n\n25\n00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.190\nlike presentations.\n\n26\n00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.590\nWhen you're not connected\nto your power adapter.\n\n27\n00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.670\nHow can we conserve that energy if you\nwill, and prolong our battery life.\n\n28\n00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.630\nSo, and that's what we're gonna\nbe focused on in this episode.\n\n29\n00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.020\nWe're gonna be focusing in on something\nknown as the Mobility Center.\n\n30\n00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.280\nNow, one of the things that we're gonna\nstart with, and it's kinda interesting.\n\n31\n00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.630\nThat if you look at the MTA objectives,\nin the Mobility Center,\n\n32\n00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.560\none of the things that they call\nout is well, Remote Desktop.\n\n33\n00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.460\nAnd this is a technology that's been\naround in Windows for a while and I kinda\n\n34\n00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.990\nask myself well why would they put\nremote desktop in a mobility situation.\n\n35\n00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.470\nWell, and then it kinda dawned on me.\n\n36\n00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.790\nThink about being able to take your laptop\nof of your corporate network and you\n\n37\n00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.550\ntake it somewhere in the states, could be\nin the same building but It's not on your\n\n38\n00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.710\ncorporate network anymore, and you need to\nconnect back in, maybe to a work computer.\n\n39\n00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.230\nSo, it does kind of make\nsense that it is here.\n\n40\n00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:09.470\nAnd that's what we're gonna start out,\n\n41\n00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.660\nwhen we start to talk\nabout mobility settings.\n\n42\n00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.460\nNow, let's go ahead and\n\n43\n00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.200\njump right in to something known as\nRemote Desktop, and let's talk about.\n\n44\n00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.500\nWhat it is and what it means for you,\n\n45\n00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.510\nand also what you might\nexpect to see on the exam.\n\n46\n00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.420\nFirst of all we need to understand\nwhat is Remote Desktop,\n\n47\n00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.530\nwhat is it allowing us to do?\n\n48\n00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.570\nWell, I want you to think about you\nlog into your computer at work, right?\n\n49\n00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.330\nWhat do you have to do?\n\n50\n00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.610\nYou have to sit down at that computer,\nyou have to log in, right, and\n\n51\n00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.120\nnow you take control over the interface\nand you start to work with the machine.\n\n52\n00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.170\nWell, wouldn't it be nice to have some\nkind of technology that if you left work,\n\n53\n00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.940\nbut you still needed to connect back and\nget some kind of work done.\n\n54\n00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.000\nMaybe from home, maybe from a hotel,\nif you are on the road.\n\n55\n00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.400\nWouldn't it be nice to be able to connect\nback into that work computer, and\n\n56\n00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.670\ntake over the desktop and be able to use\nit just like you were sitting at it.\n\n57\n00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.830\nWell, that's what Remote Desktop\nallows you to do.\n\n58\n00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.910\nAnd there are some things that we wanna\nlook at when we talk about getting it\n\n59\n00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.280\nconfigured and getting it set up.\n\n60\n00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.210\nSo, in fact let's go ahead and show you.\n\n61\n00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.850\nI've got a Windows 10 machine right here\nand I'm gonna show you how to set it up so\n\n62\n00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.990\nthat you can receive\nan incoming connection.\n\n63\n00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.050\nAnd that's the point to keep in mind is\nthat when Remote Desktop is configured.\n\n64\n00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.390\nYou're typically configuring it on\nthe machine that you wanna connect to.\n\n65\n00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.500\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n66\n00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.840\nI'm gonna go ahead, and I'm going\nto right click on the start icon.\n\n67\n00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.040\nIn fact, there's a couple\ndifferent ways we can get to this.\n\n68\n00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.180\nOne of the ways you can get to this\nthat's been there for a while,\n\n69\n00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.400\nis the Windows Accessories.\n\n70\n00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.480\nAnd I believe this goes back,\n\n71\n00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.660\nRonnie might be able to help me on this,\nall the way to XP.\n\n72\n00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.690\nAnd if we open up our Start Menu and\nwe scroll all the way down,\n\n73\n00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.110\nyou'll see,\nwell we have our Windows Accessories here.\n\n74\n00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.240\nAnd then in this list,\n\n75\n00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.120\nyou'll see something known as\nthe Remote Desktop Connection.\n\n76\n00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.860\nAll right, understand that\nthis is the utility you will\n\n77\n00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.390\nuse to make a connection\nto the other machine.\n\n78\n00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.490\nBut the problem is, by default.\n\n79\n00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.010\nWell, it's not a problem as long as\nyou know to remedy the situation,\n\n80\n00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.750\nis that Remote Desktop\nisn't turned on by default.\n\n81\n00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.680\nIt's actually disabled, you have to open\nit up and allow that communication to\n\n82\n00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.558\nthe Firewall, so\nthe settings have to be configured right.\n\n83\n00:04:07.558 --> 00:04:10.850\nSo, I'm gonna show you how to\nconfigure it on this machine, and\n\n84\n00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.420\nthen we'll use it to\nconnect to another device.\n\n85\n00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.900\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n86\n00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.050\nIn order to set the machine up, in this\ncase it would be the work computer that\n\n87\n00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:23.070\nyou want to connect to when you are no\nlonger in the vicinity of that network,\n\n88\n00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.740\nall you have to do is right click on your\nstart icon, and you can choose system.\n\n89\n00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.860\nNow, if you get into\nthe system control panel,\n\n90\n00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.870\nyou might have seen this interface before,\nthere are a few of these quick task links,\n\n91\n00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.280\nwhat I call them, on the left-hand side.\n\n92\n00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.240\nNotice that we have an option\nhere that says Remote Settings.\n\n93\n00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.130\nI'm gonna go ahead and launch that but\nI also want you to know,\n\n94\n00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.310\nthat, with these tasks, these task links,\nif i was to click System Protection,\n\n95\n00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.690\nthat would just bring me\nin the System Protection.\n\n96\n00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.960\nIf I was to choose Advance system\nsettings, that just take me to the Advance\n\n97\n00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.350\nbutton It's nice to have\nthree different links but\n\n98\n00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.200\nthey all take you to the same interface so\njust be aware of that.\n\n99\n00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.520\nNow, this is actually [LAUGH]\nalready turned on by default, but\n\n100\n00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.510\nthis is what you would see\nif the defaults are here.\n\n101\n00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.530\nYou can see that I use this enough that I\nhave to have it on, on my machines, but\n\n102\n00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.650\nthis is what you would see in the default.\n\n103\n00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.530\nNotice that it says,\nlet me go ahead and zoom in here.\n\n104\n00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.340\nNotice that it says, Don't allow\nremote connections to this computer.\n\n105\n00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.020\nLike I said, that's the default, right?\n\n106\n00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.140\nYou have to open this up.\n\n107\n00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.430\nNow, what do I mean by open this up.\n\n108\n00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.622\nWell, not really just a switch like\nyou can see here that it says,\n\n109\n00:05:24.622 --> 00:05:26.497\nAllow connections to this computer.\n\n110\n00:05:26.497 --> 00:05:27.620\nSo what has this done?\n\n111\n00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.710\nAll right, not only has this turned on\nthe ability I can connect to this machine\n\n112\n00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.540\nfrom another computer but\nit also opens up the Firewall.\n\n113\n00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.160\nAnd that's important in fact we can\nkind of dig down into the Firewall if we\n\n114\n00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.050\nwant here and\nI'll just do Windows Firewall we'll see if\n\n115\n00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.220\nCortana can help me find\nthe basic firewall.\n\n116\n00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.860\nWhat this does,\nis this opens up the fire wall, and\n\n117\n00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:59.190\nmore specifically these settings, scroll\ndown to it here real quick, right here.\n\n118\n00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.350\nRemote Desktop is something\nthat the Firewall closes down.\n\n119\n00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.390\nBy default cuz that allows an incoming\ncommunication to your computer.\n\n120\n00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.420\nNow, that communication, just for\nexam purposes, I want you to know.\n\n121\n00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.110\nAnd really for your own set-up,\nif you ever have to set-up things like\n\n122\n00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.410\nport forwarding on your routers to get\nthis to work at home, it's port 3389 so\n\n123\n00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.810\ndo keep that in mind in the exam.\n\n124\n00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.820\nYou never know, they might set\nyou up with a scenario that says,\n\n125\n00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.630\nhey you configured Remote Desktop but\nfor some reason it's not working.\n\n126\n00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:29.640\nWhat might you need to do?\n\n127\n00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.510\nWell, it could be as simple as allowing\n\n128\n00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.890\nport 3389 through the firewall or\neven through your home network.\n\n129\n00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.470\nSo, once you have turned it on,\nit opens that up.\n\n130\n00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.730\nAnd it allows that incoming communication.\n\n131\n00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:49.650\nAnd what I mean by that is if I\nhave things set up right now,\n\n132\n00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:53.010\nI should be able to connect to this\nmachine and take control over it.\n\n133\n00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.330\nAnd that's what Remote Desktop\nallows me to do.\n\n134\n00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.390\nIt allows me to take\ncontrol over the desktop.\n\n135\n00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:59.760\nWell, what do I mean by that?\n\n136\n00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.210\nWell, if you connect to a machine\nthat somebody was logged in to\n\n137\n00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.380\nover a Remote Desktop Connection, you're\ngonna locked them out of the computer.\n\n138\n00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.640\nIf you think about Windows,\n\n139\n00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.410\nwhen I do an interactive log on to\nthe local machine, what happens?\n\n140\n00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:14.540\nWell, Ronnie's machine, if he's already,\nlet's say it's Ronnie's machine and\n\n141\n00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.590\nhe's already logged in,\nwhat's he gonna do?\n\n142\n00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.490\nWell, at the very least it's\ngonna do a switch user.\n\n143\n00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.920\nRonnie might still stay logged in, but\nhe can no longer see the desktop, right.\n\n144\n00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.310\nSo, only one person can be working\nwith the desktop at a time.\n\n145\n00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.830\nLet's go ahead, and\n\n146\n00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:34.980\nnow that we've got this connected I can go\nahead and I can connect to this machine.\n\n147\n00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.740\nI've actually got this set\nup on another machine, so\n\n148\n00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:42.300\nthat from here we can also show you how do\nyou use what's known as the client side.\n\n149\n00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.800\nSee, the Remote Desktop is what they\ncall a client/server protocol, right?\n\n150\n00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.920\nWe have a client that is\ncalling out to the network and\n\n151\n00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.510\nit's requesting a service\nof another device.\n\n152\n00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:54.586\nWell, that's what\nthe Remote Desktop Connection Software,\n\n153\n00:07:54.586 --> 00:07:56.160\na little exam alert for you too.\n\n154\n00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.946\nIt's been around for awhile.\n\n155\n00:07:57.946 --> 00:08:02.760\nYou can actually type in your search\nengine, you could type MSTSC And\n\n156\n00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:07.990\nthat goes back from the days when this\nused to be called Terminal Services.\n\n157\n00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.500\nThe executable that's in Windows\nhasn't changed its name,\n\n158\n00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.520\nit's Microsoft Terminal Services Client,\nthat's what MSTSC stands for.\n\n159\n00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.320\nBut you never know, they might ask you to\nuse that old run line command in the exam\n\n160\n00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.210\ntoo, so you'll know how to open it but\n\n161\n00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:26.220\nwhat you're seeing now isn't\nthe server side of this.\n\n162\n00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.880\nThis is what's gonna reach out to\nthe network, the client, and say,\n\n163\n00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.230\nhey, anybody out there?\n\n164\n00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.550\nLet's allow them to take\na remote desktop connection.\n\n165\n00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:35.045\nWell, is it gonna be anybody,\n\n166\n00:08:35.045 --> 00:08:37.525\nnow it's gonna be a little\nbit more specific than that.\n\n167\n00:08:37.525 --> 00:08:42.255\nYou can do this by client name if you\nwant, the name of the operating system or\n\n168\n00:08:42.255 --> 00:08:45.605\nthe machine, or you can do this by IP\naddress when you make your connection.\n\n169\n00:08:45.605 --> 00:08:47.945\nLet me show you here, so\nI've got another machine,\n\n170\n00:08:47.945 --> 00:08:49.315\nit's out there on the network too.\n\n171\n00:08:50.355 --> 00:08:53.870\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and we're\ngonna take the time to connect to it.\n\n172\n00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.510\nThen we'll dig down in some of\nthe other options you can do.\n\n173\n00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.760\nIn fact, before we do that,\nlet's go ahead and do that now.\n\n174\n00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:06.755\nWhat I did is, I choose the option,\nshow options, a little down arrow here.\n\n175\n00:09:06.755 --> 00:09:09.040\nAnd you can see that there\nare different things that you can do,\n\n176\n00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:14.130\nyou can modify your experience in\nthe remote desktop client software.\n\n177\n00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.410\nFor instance, display.\n\n178\n00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:18.890\nI can configure display and how I want\nit to look here on this local machine,\n\n179\n00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.410\nas well as doing things live\ngiving local resources.\n\n180\n00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:24.120\nIf I happen to have a file\non this machine that I\n\n181\n00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:29.900\nwanna give it the ability to transfer that\nfile to the machine I'm connecting to,\n\n182\n00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.970\nwell I can give that access\nto the local resources.\n\n183\n00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:33.520\nSo that's up to you as well.\n\n184\n00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.440\nAnd then you get set different levels\nof experience you know based on your\n\n185\n00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.580\nconnection.\n\n186\n00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:38.850\nWhat's the strength of connection?\n\n187\n00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.890\nIf it's really strong,\nyou can get a better experience.\n\n188\n00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.910\nHowever, if you're limited in\nyour bandwidth, you might wanna\n\n189\n00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:48.930\nreel in some of those resources that it's\ngonna use in favor of a better connection.\n\n190\n00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:50.720\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and\nleave the defaults.\n\n191\n00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.260\nAnd what I'm doing here, when you don't\nsee the options, it's just plugging in\n\n192\n00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:58.140\nthe IP address of the computer that I\nwanna connect to or as well you can do\n\n193\n00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:02.200\nthe host name or computer name of\nthe machine too, and I can choose connect.\n\n194\n00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:06.165\nNow, I can tell something must\nbe right because I've got this\n\n195\n00:10:06.165 --> 00:10:07.400\nwhat they call the user,\n\n196\n00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.865\nthe credential UI that's what it's called\nthe credential user interface here.\n\n197\n00:10:11.865 --> 00:10:15.365\nAnd this is gonna allow me to put\nin the password to the machine\n\n198\n00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:16.335\nthat I am connecting to.\n\n199\n00:10:16.335 --> 00:10:19.285\nKeep in mind we're not talking\nabout authenticating against this\n\n200\n00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:20.825\nmachine you see here.\n\n201\n00:10:20.825 --> 00:10:24.195\nWe have to have an account of\nthe machine we're connecting to.\n\n202\n00:10:24.195 --> 00:10:25.855\nSo that is important, keep that in mind.\n\n203\n00:10:25.855 --> 00:10:30.000\nAnd that just happens to be XPS for\nour purposes here.\n\n204\n00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.430\nAnd we'll choose admin and\n\n205\n00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:36.230\nthen of course we'll use our\nsuper secret Microsoft password.\n\n206\n00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:39.720\nNow, one of the first things that I get\nright here is a certificate warning.\n\n207\n00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.180\nUnderstand what they mean by this is when\nyou're connecting to another machine\n\n208\n00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:46.690\nthrough a remote desktop, the first thing\nyour computer's gonna do on the other end,\n\n209\n00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:49.340\nor the computer that you're connecting\nto is it's gonna present a certificate,\n\n210\n00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.460\na little digital information\nthat we use in security.\n\n211\n00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.490\nSee, the problem is, this local\ncomputer doesn't know what that means,\n\n212\n00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:56.180\nhas no clue what that certificate means.\n\n213\n00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.960\nSo it's giving you a warning saying, well,\nif you're gonna connect to this machine,\n\n214\n00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.770\nmake sure it's the machine you want,\nand you understand that.\n\n215\n00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:04.170\nAnd we're fine with that.\n\n216\n00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:06.310\nSo if we wanted to we could\nview this certificate.\n\n217\n00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:08.690\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nbreeze on past this.\n\n218\n00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:09.690\nAnd here we are.\n\n219\n00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:14.480\nNow, I want you to see,\nnotice this little bar up here alright.\n\n220\n00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:19.470\nThis little bar lets me know that\nI'm actually looking at the desktop\n\n221\n00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:21.660\nif you can see here the XPS.\n\n222\n00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:26.980\nNo longer on my local machine in fact,\nif we were to minimize this, you can see\n\n223\n00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:32.280\nthat I basically have a window\ninside of a window, all right.\n\n224\n00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.960\nWe've talked about\nvirtualization in another\n\n225\n00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.380\nepisode where you have\nyour operating system.\n\n226\n00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:38.540\nAnd then you still have your desktop.\n\n227\n00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.490\nWell this is kinda interesting because\nthe window looks a lot the same but\n\n228\n00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.710\nI'm connected to that other\nmachine over the network.\n\n229\n00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.830\nAll right.\n\n230\n00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:49.160\nAnd let's go ahead and\nlet's look at that a little bit more.\n\n231\n00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:53.820\nI have the ability now because\nI am in control of this machine\n\n232\n00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:56.670\nto do things like remote management,\nremote administration.\n\n233\n00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.365\nWhy might I even wanna use\nsomething like Remote Desktop.\n\n234\n00:11:59.365 --> 00:12:02.575\nWell if, in a mobile situation,\nyou're no longer on your network and\n\n235\n00:12:02.575 --> 00:12:05.535\nyou need to connect back to\na work machine or even a server.\n\n236\n00:12:05.535 --> 00:12:08.875\nA lot of times your administrators use\nthis to manage the servers remotely,\n\n237\n00:12:08.875 --> 00:12:11.770\nwithout ever having to go locally and\nconnect to their interfaces.\n\n238\n00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:13.830\nSo, it is a great thing to have and\n\n239\n00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:17.010\nit's one of the reasons it's\nhere in the mobility settings\n\n240\n00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:21.010\nwhere as far as this episode, so\nI want you to be aware of that.\n\n241\n00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:25.000\nKeep in mind you have to configure it\non the machine you wanna connect it.\n\n242\n00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.670\nYou have to ensure that\nthe firewall is open on port 3389.\n\n243\n00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:32.410\nIf you use Windows and\njust configure it normally\n\n244\n00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:35.620\nyou should see that Windows\nautomatically opens the firewall.\n\n245\n00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:39.020\nHowever, that doesn't\nnecessarily mean that\n\n246\n00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:42.230\nthe other components on your network\nare gonna allow that traffic.\n\n247\n00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:44.840\nSo just look with your local vendors\non what you'd have to do in order to\n\n248\n00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:48.450\nconfigure TCP port 3389.\n\n249\n00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:53.930\nNow, that we've connected to this\nremote device, let's show you a little\n\n250\n00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:57.400\nbit more about some of the things that\nyou can do inside the mobility center.\n\n251\n00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.120\nAnd in fact,\nI'm gonna show you a couple of things,\n\n252\n00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.220\nnotice on the machine that I\nuse to connect, all right.\n\n253\n00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:04.570\nThis is the first machine.\n\n254\n00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:09.190\nIf I was to right click on our Start icon,\na little windows charm, you'll notice that\n\n255\n00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:13.620\nwhat I have here is well, programs and\nfeatures, power options and event viewer.\n\n256\n00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.400\nRemember what I told you,\ndesktop they don't consider you needing\n\n257\n00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.050\nthese mobility settings so\nthe option isn't there.\n\n258\n00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:23.530\nHowever, switching over to a device\nthat is, in this case a tablet.\n\n259\n00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:27.230\nIf I right click on the Windows icon,\nI see something.\n\n260\n00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:30.380\nRight here in between programs and\nfeatures that wasn't there before.\n\n261\n00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.130\nAnd that's the mobility center.\n\n262\n00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:36.180\nThat's one of the benefits of having\n\n263\n00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:40.110\nthe mobility center in general is in fact\nthat you get to it very, very quickly.\n\n264\n00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:41.510\nWhy might I wanna get to this quickly?\n\n265\n00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:42.630\nLet's go ahead and launch it up and\n\n266\n00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:45.240\ntalk about some of the settings\nthat you see inside of here.\n\n267\n00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:49.950\nAll right, remember the main thing that\nthe Mobility Center really is focused on\n\n268\n00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:53.220\nis conserving your battery life, right?\n\n269\n00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:54.940\nWell, let's look at some of the settings.\n\n270\n00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:56.120\nAll right, display brightness.\n\n271\n00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.320\nNow, you can't really see this, but\nI'm sure if somebody was sitting next to\n\n272\n00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.950\nthis tablet would be wondering why\nthe screen's brightness is dimming and\n\n273\n00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:04.230\nbrightening up and stuff.\n\n274\n00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.020\nWell, again, remember that consumes power.\n\n275\n00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:10.620\nAlso, mute is more for\nthings like your presentation settings,\n\n276\n00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:11.800\nwhich we're gonna look at.\n\n277\n00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.370\nNotice that I see things, like for\ninstance, my battery status.\n\n278\n00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:19.980\nRight away, you say well, Wes,\nI can see that down here as well.\n\n279\n00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:24.010\nYeah, you can, but isn't it nice to\nhave all of these power settings,\n\n280\n00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:26.520\nat what power centric settings\nin a single location.\n\n281\n00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:29.960\nAnd that's one of the good things\nabout the mobility center.\n\n282\n00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.490\nI have the ability that if I want to,\n\n283\n00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:34.660\nthink about a presentation where\nI connect to an external display.\n\n284\n00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:37.960\nThis is a really good\nthing to have likewise.\n\n285\n00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.250\nThe other thing that we can do here\nis notice it says not presenting.\n\n286\n00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.370\nAnd it says turn on presentation settings.\n\n287\n00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:47.470\nWell if I click and\nI decide that I want to maybe\n\n288\n00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:51.450\nmake some modifications to these settings,\neveryone of these icons are clickable.\n\n289\n00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:55.070\nSo for instance, if I choose the little\nprojector icon here, I can get into\n\n290\n00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:58.330\npresentation settings and say hey,\nI'm currently giving a presentation.\n\n291\n00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.420\nYou say well, what would that matter?\n\n292\n00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:03.460\nWell, I don't want things like\nnotifications popping up, right?\n\n293\n00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:04.760\nI want it to be quiet.\n\n294\n00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.420\nI don't want it reaching out and\ndoing things like updates that\n\n295\n00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:10.890\nare pulling some of my data plan in\nthe background maybe wasting and\n\n296\n00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:12.220\nconsuming some of my bandwidth.\n\n297\n00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:16.330\nSo I can tell it, I can tell the machine\nright now, turn on presentation settings.\n\n298\n00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.410\nAnd it's a profile that you set and\n\n299\n00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:21.780\nyou can see that you can make\nmodifications to it on what is going.\n\n300\n00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:24.770\nTo interrupt your presentation versus\nwhat you might want to keep out of your\n\n301\n00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:25.530\npresentation.\n\n302\n00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.580\nSo those are some of\nthe things that you can do.\n\n303\n00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.300\nIn fact, you can get right\ninto your power options here.\n\n304\n00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.700\nWe talk about power options\nin another episode,\n\n305\n00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.210\nbut keep in mind that\nthe same thing applies here.\n\n306\n00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:39.565\nYou can get into your power options and\nI don't have to sit here and\n\n307\n00:15:39.565 --> 00:15:41.279\ndig around in the control panel.\n\n308\n00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:44.994\nSo this is a nice thing to have access to.\n\n309\n00:15:44.994 --> 00:15:49.127\nBut some of the things that I'd really\nlike to set up is this little option over\n\n310\n00:15:49.127 --> 00:15:51.425\nhere where it talks about the Sync Center.\n\n311\n00:15:51.425 --> 00:15:56.040\nThis is another thing that's part of your\nMobility Settings, and you don't really\n\n312\n00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:00.076\nhave to use the Sync Center in a mobile\nenvironment, but it is very handy.\n\n313\n00:16:00.076 --> 00:16:01.595\nSo, what is the Sync Center?\n\n314\n00:16:01.595 --> 00:16:03.232\nWhat does it allow us to do?\n\n315\n00:16:03.232 --> 00:16:06.686\nNow, if you're gonna connect\nto a shared resource, right.\n\n316\n00:16:06.686 --> 00:16:10.020\nWe talk about shares and connecting\nto them over the network, right.\n\n317\n00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:12.300\nThere is something that\nhas to be available for\n\n318\n00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.380\nyou to be able to do that and\nwhat is that?\n\n319\n00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:15.600\nA network connection, right?\n\n320\n00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.160\nI mean it's a shared resource,\nyou connect to it over the network.\n\n321\n00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.410\nWhat happens if the network\nisn't available?\n\n322\n00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:23.450\nWell, unfortunately, you'd lose\naccess to any of the information\n\n323\n00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:26.630\nin that shared resource, so\nthat could be a problem.\n\n324\n00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:27.930\nThat could be problematic for us.\n\n325\n00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:30.050\nIn fact,\nlet me give you an example of this.\n\n326\n00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:32.530\nI've actually got a shared\nresource on our network here.\n\n327\n00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:34.510\nWe went ahead, we typed in the UNC path.\n\n328\n00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:38.080\nRemember, your universal naming\nconventions, backslash backslash, whatever\n\n329\n00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.820\nthe computer name is, and then backslash,\nwhat the resource, the share name is.\n\n330\n00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:46.610\nAnd if you look here, I've got access to\nthings like, well our company documents.\n\n331\n00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:48.730\nYou know I could take it a little\nbit farther if I wanted to.\n\n332\n00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:51.930\nIn fact I could actually map\na drive if I wanted to, right?\n\n333\n00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:53.110\nIf I want to get access and\n\n334\n00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.685\nI don't want to have to keep\ntyping those UNC paths, right?\n\n335\n00:16:56.685 --> 00:17:00.760\nI could always come up to this PC And go\nto Computer, and I can map the same thing,\n\n336\n00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:04.330\nthis network drive here,\nor the share if you will.\n\n337\n00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:11.575\nAnd I can just type it in here,\n// in this case, client01/storage.\n\n338\n00:17:11.575 --> 00:17:13.805\nRight, we can choose finish and\nit will attempt to connect, and\n\n339\n00:17:13.805 --> 00:17:19.185\nnow I have access to this location\njust like any other hard drive, right?\n\n340\n00:17:19.185 --> 00:17:21.555\nSo we've mapped the drive,\nand that's great.\n\n341\n00:17:21.555 --> 00:17:26.179\nI click on it, it makes it very easy,\nI've got access to our company resources.\n\n342\n00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:32.210\nBut what happens, what happens when\nsomething goes wrong where I'm not,\n\n343\n00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:35.190\nmy laptop,\nI'm no longer on the network, right?\n\n344\n00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:39.710\nI take it off of the network and now I\ndon't have access to the resources or\n\n345\n00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.650\nit goes offline and\nsomething happens to the network.\n\n346\n00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:45.140\nLet's go ahead and\nshow you what that would look like.\n\n347\n00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:48.260\nI've actually got that other machine here,\nright here.\n\n348\n00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.550\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nwhat we're gonna do here is,\n\n349\n00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.750\nRonnie I think we'll simulate\na network failure here.\n\n350\n00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:56.280\nI'm gonna open up the network adapter,\nnetwork and sharing center.\n\n351\n00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.230\nChange adapter settings and we're gonna\ngo ahead and just right click and\n\n352\n00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.640\nwe'll disable this network adapter.\n\n353\n00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:06.020\nAll right, it's disabled now,\nso network failure or\n\n354\n00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.290\nI'm no longer connected to\nthat local network, right?\n\n355\n00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:10.490\nMobility, keep that in mind.\n\n356\n00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:12.830\nNow if I go back and\nI decide that hey, you know what?\n\n357\n00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:15.970\nAnd let's go ahead and\nclose that down so it isn't cached.\n\n358\n00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.180\nNotice that the icon has changed.\n\n359\n00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:22.230\nIt doesn't show me the capacity\nanymore that I have.\n\n360\n00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:23.390\nNow I know this.\n\n361\n00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:24.060\nRonny knows this.\n\n362\n00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.360\nWe've looked at these icons for\na while now.\n\n363\n00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:29.430\nWe've seen these before, we know what's\ngoing on, but the end user doesn't.\n\n364\n00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:34.490\nSo now when I go to click on\nthis resource, what's happening?\n\n365\n00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:38.360\nAnd what you would expect to happen when\nyou lose network connection to some kind\n\n366\n00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.700\nof resource like the shared resource.\n\n367\n00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.910\nAnd that's where the sync center comes in.\n\n368\n00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:47.745\nThe sync center allows us, even though we\nmight be disconnected from that shared\n\n369\n00:18:47.745 --> 00:18:52.725\nresource to still be able to have\naccess to our files when we're offline.\n\n370\n00:18:52.725 --> 00:18:54.175\nNow even more so than that,\n\n371\n00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:57.365\nthey will update the moment we\nregain our network connection.\n\n372\n00:18:57.365 --> 00:18:59.710\nAnd that's what we kinda\nwant to show you here\n\n373\n00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:01.900\nwhen it comes to a resource like that.\n\n374\n00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.430\nNow, let me go ahead,\nfirst things first, we'll disconnect.\n\n375\n00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:07.620\nI'm going to undo what I've done here.\n\n376\n00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:10.750\nIt might take a second\nbecause it is trying to\n\n377\n00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:15.720\nreach out to connect to that resource and\nhonestly I could really speed this up and\n\n378\n00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:19.900\nlet's say we brought the network back on,\nor back up, if you will.\n\n379\n00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:25.460\nI enabled the network adapter or\nwe come back off of that other network.\n\n380\n00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.120\nAnd there we go.\n\n381\n00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.530\nNotice it didn't give\nme access to anything.\n\n382\n00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:29.570\nAnd that's the other thing.\n\n383\n00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:34.000\nI don't have access to those files once\nI'm disconnected from the network, and\n\n384\n00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.170\nthat's a problem.\n\n385\n00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:39.060\nSo if we decide,\nwe can come back to our mobility center.\n\n386\n00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:41.600\nWe can choose our sync center icon.\n\n387\n00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:46.990\nAnd what you should see here is\nthat there isn't anything in here.\n\n388\n00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:51.040\nNow for the purposes of this\ndemonstration I went ahead and\n\n389\n00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.450\ninitiated sync center to begin with,\nand let me show you what I mean.\n\n390\n00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:59.510\nTo turn on sync center, you have to\nstart by managing your offline files.\n\n391\n00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:02.670\nNow, this is typically disabled and\nI want you to know that.\n\n392\n00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:04.880\nBut to save time here so\nyou didn't have to wait for\n\n393\n00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.930\na reboot,\nall I did is said enable offline files,\n\n394\n00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:12.540\nit says OK, and it restarts your\nmachine and that's where we are now.\n\n395\n00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:18.040\nHowever, I need to make sure\nthat that shared resource\n\n396\n00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:22.450\nis also available offline and\nlet's show you how to do that.\n\n397\n00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:27.180\nSo we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\ngo back to that same network location.\n\n398\n00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:31.500\nNotice that it's back up here, right,\nwe restored network connectivity, right,\n\n399\n00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:36.580\nwe're back online if you will or\nwe're connected to the local network, and\n\n400\n00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:37.940\nI'm gonna right click.\n\n401\n00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:41.190\nAnd when I right click, you're gonna\nnotice that there's an option right\n\n402\n00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:43.510\nhere that says always available offline.\n\n403\n00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:46.100\nYou go ahead a select that.\n\n404\n00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.120\nNotice that it says\nalways available offline.\n\n405\n00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:51.070\nIt says preparing the files.\n\n406\n00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:55.120\nNow, let's go back and\nsee what sync center is telling us.\n\n407\n00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.160\nNotice that sync center is saying,\noffline files.\n\n408\n00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.030\nSync is completed.\n\n409\n00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:02.930\nNow let me go ahead and let me look.\n\n410\n00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.620\nAre my documents there?\n\n411\n00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:05.340\nWell, let's find out.\n\n412\n00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:09.960\nLet's go ahead and I'm gonna create\na document here real quick, and\n\n413\n00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:14.110\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ncall this my online document.\n\n414\n00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:18.510\nAll right, and\nI wanna specifically name that so\n\n415\n00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:21.940\nthat we can switch over to where\nthis resource is stored and\n\n416\n00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:25.790\nsee if we have while the network is\nconnected, if we've got a synchronization.\n\n417\n00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:28.200\nHas nothing to do with the sync center,\nright?\n\n418\n00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.930\nThat's normally how things should work.\n\n419\n00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:33.140\nAnd if I come down in here, right?\n\n420\n00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:35.480\nAnd I get into where this location is.\n\n421\n00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:40.080\nHere's storage,\nI see that I have my online document.\n\n422\n00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.990\nAll right,\nI want you to keep that in mind.\n\n423\n00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:44.530\nBecause now we're gonna do the same thing.\n\n424\n00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:47.660\nWe're gonna simulate the network failure.\n\n425\n00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:51.690\nWe're gonna simulate Ronnie taking his\nlaptop off of the local network, and\n\n426\n00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:54.470\nmaybe he's traveling across the country.\n\n427\n00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:55.700\nRight, no longer connected.\n\n428\n00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:58.850\nSo let's switch back up,\nactually we'll stay right here.\n\n429\n00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:02.040\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nsimulate that network failure again.\n\n430\n00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:05.790\nI'm gonna right click on the network\nadapter, disable it again,\n\n431\n00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:07.860\nno different than what we did before.\n\n432\n00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:12.850\nAll right, I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna close down the File Explorer\n\n433\n00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:17.940\ninterface and I'm gonna reconnect,\nopen it back up.\n\n434\n00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:19.500\nNotice the icon, right?\n\n435\n00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:22.630\nI could tell again something's wrong here.\n\n436\n00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:25.880\nWe lost connection, connectivity is lost.\n\n437\n00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:29.050\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna double click this.\n\n438\n00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:34.025\nAnd now your really not,\ndoesn't look like much has changed, right?\n\n439\n00:22:34.025 --> 00:22:35.975\nDoesn't look like it's any different.\n\n440\n00:22:35.975 --> 00:22:37.305\nBut what it's trying to do, and\n\n441\n00:22:37.305 --> 00:22:40.575\nthe sync center can help you just\nwith your network communications,\n\n442\n00:22:40.575 --> 00:22:45.765\nis trying to reach to that location and\nsay, can I communicate with it?\n\n443\n00:22:45.765 --> 00:22:49.260\nBecause if it can, well,\nthen we don't have to worry about it.\n\n444\n00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.900\nBut notice the network isn't connected.\n\n445\n00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.570\nHow can I tell that?\n\n446\n00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:56.180\nNotice the little icon right here.\n\n447\n00:22:56.180 --> 00:23:00.950\nIt's no longer connected to the network,\nyet I still have access to my files.\n\n448\n00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:02.600\nAll right.\n\n449\n00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:06.690\nNow we're gonna create a file in here just\nso we can kind of show that we don't have\n\n450\n00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:11.510\nany, no cards up our sleeves here, Ronnie\ndoesn't have a magic wand over here, so\n\n451\n00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:13.900\nyou know there's nothing flaky going on,\nright?\n\n452\n00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:19.210\nLet's go ahead, we're gonna create\na new file, we're gonna call this\n\n453\n00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:23.750\nOffline and\nI'm gonna call this Remote, right, so\n\n454\n00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:26.640\nwe're on the remote computer so\nwe can keep track of these.\n\n455\n00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:30.940\nBut I'm also gonna go back to the machine\nwhere that storage location was.\n\n456\n00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:33.730\nAnd we're not gonna\nreconnect the adaptor yet.\n\n457\n00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:38.800\nAnd I'm gonna create one\nthat says Offline Local.\n\n458\n00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:41.920\nAll right, where it's locally stored.\n\n459\n00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:48.400\nAll right, so now you can see that we\ndon't have an Offline Remote in here, but\n\n460\n00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.220\nwe do have an Offline Local.\n\n461\n00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.993\nIf I switch back over\nto the other machine,\n\n462\n00:23:51.993 --> 00:23:53.432\nyou can see I have Offline Remote.\n\n463\n00:23:53.432 --> 00:23:56.240\nThis is a remote machine, but\nI don't have an Offline Local.\n\n464\n00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:00.784\nLet's go ahead and reestablish\nthe network communication and see.\n\n465\n00:24:00.784 --> 00:24:04.912\nWhat we would get if we deploy\nsomething like Sync Center.\n\n466\n00:24:04.912 --> 00:24:07.780\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nswitch back over, we're gonna right-click.\n\n467\n00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:09.970\nActually, I don't even have to\nright-click over here, it's right there.\n\n468\n00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:10.830\nWe're gonna choose Enable.\n\n469\n00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:13.870\nAnd I wanna pay attention,\n\n470\n00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:18.490\nsometimes this happens [LAUGH] very fast,\nsometimes it takes a bit.\n\n471\n00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:19.600\nAnd if you noticed,\n\n472\n00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:25.830\nright away I now have an offline local on\nthe remote computer, cuz what happened?\n\n473\n00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:28.550\nThis is the benefit,\nthe other benefit of Sync Center.\n\n474\n00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:31.600\nNot only do you have availability\nof your files offline, but\n\n475\n00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.380\nyou also have the ability to\nsynchronize what you've missed\n\n476\n00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:38.590\nonce the network communication\nhas been reestablished.\n\n477\n00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:41.400\nNow you can also go a little bit\nfather than this if you want inside of\n\n478\n00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:45.920\nthe Sync Center and you can find\nout things like conflicts, right?\n\n479\n00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:49.630\nIf I have two files that are the same,\nwhich one gets, what happens?\n\n480\n00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:50.660\nWhich one gets thrown out?\n\n481\n00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.870\nWhich one gets cached, right?\n\n482\n00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:57.300\nSync results,\nnow if you look at our sync results,\n\n483\n00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:00.320\nI can see that the Sync Completed.\n\n484\n00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:04.530\nIt started very first when we set it up\nand then the sync happened the moment\n\n485\n00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:07.840\nthe network connection was reestablished,\nand I can see that.\n\n486\n00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:12.690\nAnd now you can see that we have\naccess to our resource here,\n\n487\n00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:15.080\neven though we didn't have connection.\n\n488\n00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:18.770\nAnd the other side of the other\ntracks are the fact that if I look\n\n489\n00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:24.280\nin the folder where I had my offline\nlocal, now I have my Offline Remote.\n\n490\n00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.960\nSo the synchronization happened both ways.\n\n491\n00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.780\nAnd that's the great thing,\nthat's one of the benefits of Sync Center.\n\n492\n00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:32.700\nAnd it's why it's a good\ntechnology to have.\n\n493\n00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:36.710\nAnd it's great that they have bundled it\nall here in a single location where you\n\n494\n00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:39.154\ncan do things like control your power,\nright?\n\n495\n00:25:39.154 --> 00:25:42.322\nThe power expenditure on the machine,\nyou can make sure that if you're giving\n\n496\n00:25:42.322 --> 00:25:44.775\npresentations, you're not\ninterrupted by these popups.\n\n497\n00:25:44.775 --> 00:25:47.600\nAnd last but not least,\nif you're not on the network or\n\n498\n00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.980\nthe network fails, you still have\naccess to your information and\n\n499\n00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:53.540\nyou can make yourself\na lot more productive.\n\n500\n00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:56.040\nSo that's some of the benefits\nto the Mobility Center, Ronnie.\n\n501\n00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:56.750\nAnd I tell you what,\n\n502\n00:25:56.750 --> 00:26:00.380\nit's nice to have in a single\nlocation when you need to get to it.\n\n503\n00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:03.330\n&gt;&gt; Wes, there's no doubt that\nin today's world there are so\n\n504\n00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:07.100\nmany more devices that we have and\nmost of them are becoming more mobile.\n\n505\n00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:10.045\nThat means we do need to extend\nthe life of our battery and\n\n506\n00:26:10.045 --> 00:26:13.692\nalso be able to stay connected to get\naccess to the files that we need.\n\n507\n00:26:13.692 --> 00:26:18.202\nAnd we can see right here that Windows has\nprovided several different techniques for\n\n508\n00:26:18.202 --> 00:26:22.202\nus and different tools and utilities\nto really help us out so that we're not\n\n509\n00:26:22.202 --> 00:26:26.420\nhaving to worry too much about in terms\nof adding in third party applications.\n\n510\n00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:29.160\nBut it's all built right\ninto the operating system.\n\n511\n00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:33.230\nSo thank you, Wes, for introducing us\nto those different concepts there, and\n\n512\n00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:36.470\nthank you also for\njoining us today as well.\n\n513\n00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:39.870\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n514\n00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:40.735\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n515\n00:26:40.735 --> 00:26:44.858\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more\nWindows operating system fundamentals.\n\n516\n00:26:44.858 --> 00:26:51.870\n[MUSIC]\n\n517\n00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:56.839\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

right.\n\n5\n00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:35,581\nGood morning, good afternoon,\nand good evening.\n\n6\n00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:38,910\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,971\nI'm your host, Don Pezet back with Mr.\nRonnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:41,971 --> 00:00:42,870\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n9\n00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,445\nIt is cold again.\n\n10\n00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:47,070\n[LAUGH] It is so cold.\n\n11\n00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,540\nIt is amazing.\n\n12\n00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,020\nAnd normally we get to brag about\nbeautiful, sunshiny Florida.\n\n13\n00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,090\nSunny Florida, yeah.\nBut not this time around, right.\n\n14\n00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,480\nThis time we get to be cold.\n\n15\n00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,905\nSo, we are back with a,\nwell we're not really back.\n\n16\n00:00:58,905 --> 00:01:00,600\nRight?\nWe're kicking off a brand\n\n17\n00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,740\nnew series right here.\n\n18\n00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:07,030\nThis is our first episode for\nthe Microsoft Technology Associate.\n\n19\n00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,900\nThe MTA, or technical associate.\n\n20\n00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,370\nAnd so we're going to be diving into that.\n\n21\n00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,130\nParticularly we're hitting\nthe operating system\n\n22\n00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,620\nfundamentals branch of the MTA, right?\n\n23\n00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,840\nSo we're going to kick right off\nwith the first objective and\n\n24\n00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,890\nstart moving through some of our content.\n\n25\n00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:26,280\nAnd that first objective is understand\noperating system configurations.\n\n26\n00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,170\nAnd what that means is well,\nwhen you sit down at a computer,\n\n27\n00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,802\nthat computer is running\nan operating system at a minimum.\n\n28\n00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:35,110\nRight?\nIt may not have any cool programs or\n\n29\n00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:38,110\nanything like that installed but\nin a minimum its got an operating system.\n\n30\n00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:42,860\nAnd that might be Windows XP,\nWindows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8,\n\n31\n00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,050\nwhatever version of Windows\nit happens to be, and\n\n32\n00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,470\nthere's some basic things that\nwe might wanna configure or\n\n33\n00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,670\nchange about that OS, not even thinking\nabout other software just yet.\n\n34\n00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,730\nWe're just focusing in on\nthe operating system itself.\n\n35\n00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,410\nYeah.\n\n36\n00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:01,917\nRemember that when taking a look at from\nthis standpoint of being a technology\n\n37\n00:02:01,917 --> 00:02:06,440\nassociate, technical associate is\ndoing it from the support side.\n\n38\n00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,380\nIt's not just enough to say,\n\n39\n00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,760\nwell I've been using Windows 7,\nI know where things are.\n\n40\n00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,250\nWe need to be able to get in there and\n\n41\n00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,250\nbe able to configure it to make it\ndo what we need to be able to do.\n\n42\n00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,630\nSo I want to make sure that you\nexplore the operating system,\n\n43\n00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,360\nthat you feel comfortable, especially\nwith manipulating and changing it.\n\n44\n00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,650\nThat actually becomes more\nhelpful to somebody else too.\n\n45\n00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,290\nAnother thing to remember is, we're gonna\ntalk about operating system fundamentals,\n\n46\n00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,510\nand they do apply to several\ndifferent operating systems.\n\n47\n00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,650\nBut on the exam you're\ngoing to see Windows 7.\n\n48\n00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,520\nNow you might be saying to yourself,\nwell Windows 8 is out and\n\n49\n00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,030\nWindows 10 is coming out soon, so why\nare we still doing Windows 7 on the exam?\n\n50\n00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,670\nAnd the reason is the MTA is tailored to\n\n51\n00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,070\nthe most common operating\nsystem owned businesses.\n\n52\n00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,410\nSo at home, yeah, a lot of people\nswitched over to Windows 8, that's fine.\n\n53\n00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,080\nBut in businesses,\nmost of them are still tied to Windows 7,\n\n54\n00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,500\nand that's what the exam is based on.\n\n55\n00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,340\nFortunately, a lot of what we talk\nabout carries over between them, so\n\n56\n00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,640\nit's good, reusable knowledge.\n\n57\n00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,270\nBut just be aware,\nthe exam is based on Windows 7.\n\n58\n00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:11,860\nAlso remember that if you don't have\na Windows 7 machine to practice on,\n\n59\n00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,970\ntake advantage of the IT Pro TV view labs.\n\n60\n00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:19,020\nWe have virtual labs, and if you go in, we\nhave one view lab, I know that's made for\n\n61\n00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,620\nthe CompTIA plus certification.\n\n62\n00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,690\nIf you launch that one, it's got a Windows\n7 machine that you can access and run and\n\n63\n00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,200\npractice with even though you might be\nrunning a different operating system\n\n64\n00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,290\non your computer.\n\n65\n00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,902\nSo take advantage of those V labs,\nthey are a part of IT Pro TV subscription.\n\n66\n00:03:33,902 --> 00:03:39,330\nAll right, let's dive into\noperating system configuration.\n\n67\n00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:43,270\nOur first topic that we need to hit on,\nand I'm just pulling up the Microsoft\n\n68\n00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:46,760\nexam objectives here to make sure that we\nmove through each of them appropriately.\n\n69\n00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,030\nLet's get these up on the screen for\na second.\n\n70\n00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:53,340\nThese are the Microsoft exam objectives\nand they're just kind of high level.\n\n71\n00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,120\nThey always identify it, Ronnie.\n\n72\n00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,800\nLikes to make fun of it where they say\nplease note that the questions may test on\n\n73\n00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,210\nbut will not be limited to\nthe topics in the following list.\n\n74\n00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,210\nRight, this is straight\nfrom Microsoft's website.\n\n75\n00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,800\nAnd so they give you the general areas\nyou need to be aware of thereof,\n\n76\n00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,170\nand there can be more,\nthere usually isn't,\n\n77\n00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:13,720\nit usually does come right off of this,\nbut there can be a little but more.\n\n78\n00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,940\nSo we're going to take\na look at the control panel.\n\n79\n00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,240\nWe're going to take a look at desktop\nsettings, native applications,\n\n80\n00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,170\nmobility and\nremote management and assistance.\n\n81\n00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,430\nSo a few different components of the OS,\nbut\n\n82\n00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,810\nwe're gonna start with that Control Panel.\n\n83\n00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,370\nAll right, now what is the Control Panel?\n\n84\n00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,670\nBefore we even dive into that,\nright, what is it?\n\n85\n00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,700\nYeah, the control panel is an application\n\n86\n00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,590\nthat's installed inside of Windows 7\nthat gives us the ability to control\n\n87\n00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:45,820\nanything that we really need to as\na user about the operating system.\n\n88\n00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,220\nSo even though it's called\nthe Control Panel and\n\n89\n00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,490\nit's made up of multiple little utilities\nthat we can go in and then customize and\n\n90\n00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,130\nconfigure the way we need to so\nthat when we finish adjusting it,\n\n91\n00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,460\nit actually makes a change in\nthe overall operating system.\n\n92\n00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:03,180\nAnd now if Windows came pre-installed\non your computer, and, everything's set\n\n93\n00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,000\nthe way that you want it, then you may\nnot ever need to use the control panel.\n\n94\n00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,260\nBut, if there's ever a behavior in Windows\nthat you don't like, or that you would\n\n95\n00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,790\nprefer to be set a different way,\nthe Control Panel's your destination.\n\n96\n00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,900\nIt's real easy to get to it.\n\n97\n00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,910\nit's just tucked away\nunder our Start menu.\n\n98\n00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,510\nSo in Windows 7, that means going\ndown to our Windows button down here.\n\n99\n00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,310\nAnd we'll click on that.\n\n100\n00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:26,650\nThat's actually called the Start button\nbecause in older versions of Windows,\n\n101\n00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,930\nit actually had the word\nstart written on it.\n\n102\n00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,610\nSo they refer to this as the Start menu,\nand\n\n103\n00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,420\nthat's your Start button, but\nI usually just call it the Window's button\n\n104\n00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:38,920\nnow because it's got the Windows logo on\nit and there's no word that says start.\n\n105\n00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,812\nBut if you bring that up,\nyou'll see the link.\n\n106\n00:05:40,812 --> 00:05:43,100\nWhoops!\n[LAUGH] Right there that says,\n\n107\n00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:43,720\nControl Panel.\n\n108\n00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,210\nAll right?\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n109\n00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:48,630\nclick on that to go into\nthe Control Panel, and like Ronnie said,\n\n110\n00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,610\nhere's where I start to see all\nthe different individual components.\n\n111\n00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,050\nAll the different things I\ncan change about my system,\n\n112\n00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:55,990\nthere's a lot of stuff in here.\n\n113\n00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,430\nWe've got security settings and\n\n114\n00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,720\nnetwork settings, hardware settings,\nprograms, our user accounts if\n\n115\n00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,220\nwe have multiple family members that\nwant to use the computer, Appearance and\n\n116\n00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:11,120\nPersonalization if we just want\nWindows to look differently and so on.\n\n117\n00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,660\nNow if you are a user of\n\n118\n00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:18,150\nolder Windows operating systems you\nmight expect a different view of this.\n\n119\n00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,000\nIn older versions of Windows,\n\n120\n00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,100\nthere was an icon view that was\ndisplayed in the Control Panel.\n\n121\n00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,060\nIn Windows 7 we get what's called a\ncategory view, so these are actually just\n\n122\n00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,830\ncategories and inside of them\nare a number of different programs.\n\n123\n00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,450\nThat's what all these little links are.\n\n124\n00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,880\nSo all of these are representing different\nprograms that we can run as part of\n\n125\n00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,190\nthe Control Panel.\n\n126\n00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:41,550\nIf you like that old view,\nup here you can click on category and\n\n127\n00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:45,650\nyou can see where you can switch\nit to large or small icons.\n\n128\n00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:49,530\nAnd that's the icon view that we\nused to have in the Control Panel.\n\n129\n00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,140\nBut there just got to be so\n\n130\n00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,420\nmany icons that it became confusing\nto find out what you needed.\n\n131\n00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,940\nThere's a lot in here.\n\n132\n00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,600\nAnd that's why they switched\nto the category view.\n\n133\n00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,580\nTo say what's the general\nare you're trying to get to and\n\n134\n00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,710\nthen we'll narrow it down and\nmake it easier to work with.\n\n135\n00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,810\nAll right, so what are some of the tools\nthat we need to be aware of in here?\n\n136\n00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:15,870\nWell, one of the first ones that we want\nto touch on is the accessibility options.\n\n137\n00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,890\nWhen you're working inside of the control,\nor\n\n138\n00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:23,100\nWindows in general, Windows is really\ndesigned for the average and typical user.\n\n139\n00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,650\nBut, not every user has the same needs.\n\n140\n00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:33,050\nIf you're like me and are terrible\nat hearing, then there's certain\n\n141\n00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,200\nthings we can tweak inside of Windows to\nmake it a little more optimal for us.\n\n142\n00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,830\nIf you have a disability,\nif you're visually impaired or\n\n143\n00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,755\nauditory impairment,\nany kind of condition that might make it\n\n144\n00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:48,995\nmore difficult to use a computer in\nthe native way that it's set up.\n\n145\n00:07:48,995 --> 00:07:52,778\nThere's a lot of additional features\ninside of Windows we can turn on and\n\n146\n00:07:52,778 --> 00:07:55,021\nthose are called Accessibility Options.\n\n147\n00:07:55,021 --> 00:07:58,156\nThey're tucked away right\nhere under Ease of Access.\n\n148\n00:07:58,156 --> 00:08:02,875\nAnd Microsoft always uses this\nlogo right here to represent where\n\n149\n00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,465\nthere's accessibility options.\n\n150\n00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:10,003\nSo when we click on that, we'll see some\nof the different things that we can tweak\n\n151\n00:08:10,003 --> 00:08:14,879\nand there's various suggestions they make,\nbut we can optimize our visual display,\n\n152\n00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,841\nreplace sounds with visual cues.\n\n153\n00:08:16,841 --> 00:08:19,031\nRight?\nIf you have a hearing impairment and\n\n154\n00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,712\nWindows makes a beep to let\nyou know you got a new email,\n\n155\n00:08:21,712 --> 00:08:24,174\nyou're not gonna hear that,\ndoesn't help you.\n\n156\n00:08:24,174 --> 00:08:24,800\nDoes it?\n\n157\n00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,027\nOr you can do a visual queue, instead and\nit'll make the window flash or\n\n158\n00:08:29,027 --> 00:08:33,185\na little pop-up bubble will appear and\nnow it becomes a visual queue,\n\n159\n00:08:33,185 --> 00:08:36,801\ninstead of an audio queue and\nthat becomes a lot more useful.\n\n160\n00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:40,899\nThere's also speech recognition for\nsome people.\n\n161\n00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:44,232\nFor example, if you have\nParkinson's disease, motor control\n\n162\n00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:48,631\nbecomes a real challenge when you're in\nthe later stages of Parkinson's disease.\n\n163\n00:08:48,631 --> 00:08:50,140\nIt can be very difficult to type.\n\n164\n00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,172\nWell, speech recognition.\n\n165\n00:08:52,172 --> 00:08:54,274\nYou talk to the computer,\ninstead of typing.\n\n166\n00:08:54,274 --> 00:08:55,852\nNow you don't have to\nworry about the keyboards.\n\n167\n00:08:55,852 --> 00:08:59,416\nYou can tell it to run a program or\nbrowse to a web page.\n\n168\n00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:03,947\nThat kind of interactivity, makes\ncomputers useful for people who would\n\n169\n00:09:03,947 --> 00:09:08,635\nnormally find it very difficult and\nthat's why they call it ease of access.\n\n170\n00:09:08,635 --> 00:09:10,738\nRight?\nYou're making it easy for\n\n171\n00:09:10,738 --> 00:09:13,550\neveryone to be able to\nuse that computer and so\n\n172\n00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:18,816\nthese are all just wrapped together into\none big term, the accessibility options.\n\n173\n00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:23,049\nThe other option that the exam\nspecifically call out is what we call\n\n174\n00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:25,747\nAdministrative Tools and\njust like it sounds.\n\n175\n00:09:25,747 --> 00:09:29,188\nThat these are things you're not gonna\nsee a regular end user choosing to do\n\n176\n00:09:29,188 --> 00:09:29,798\nvery often.\n\n177\n00:09:29,798 --> 00:09:31,774\nThese are things you might have to do, so\n\n178\n00:09:31,774 --> 00:09:35,859\nthat you can actually control the computer\nsystem the way that you need to control.\n\n179\n00:09:35,859 --> 00:09:40,542\nNow in the Control Panel,\nthe easiest way to get access to it,\n\n180\n00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:44,865\nif we bring that computer backup\nis to go back to system and\n\n181\n00:09:44,865 --> 00:09:51,369\nsecurity in Control Panel and then this is\nnormally the unusual thing about Windows.\n\n182\n00:09:51,369 --> 00:09:54,143\nEverything normally is listed in\nalphabetical order, except for\n\n183\n00:09:54,143 --> 00:09:55,189\nAdministrative Tools.\n\n184\n00:09:55,189 --> 00:09:59,336\nAdministrative Tools happens to be down at\nthe bottom of the list, and if you select\n\n185\n00:09:59,336 --> 00:10:03,007\nthat, that will actually give you\naccess to a bunch of these other tools,\n\n186\n00:10:03,007 --> 00:10:04,801\nwhich not everybody's gonna use.\n\n187\n00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:08,576\nBut someone as an IT technician,\nmay have to come in here and\n\n188\n00:10:08,576 --> 00:10:10,396\nget these things adjusted.\n\n189\n00:10:10,396 --> 00:10:14,240\nAnd the reason these are separated\nout is that your average end user,\n\n190\n00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,945\nnot only should they never need them, but\nthey absolutely shouldn't mess with them\n\n191\n00:10:18,945 --> 00:10:22,942\nunless they know what they're doing\nwith the other settings, right?\n\n192\n00:10:22,942 --> 00:10:24,882\nWhen you go into your\nregular Control Panel,\n\n193\n00:10:24,882 --> 00:10:26,471\nall these settings that are in here.\n\n194\n00:10:26,471 --> 00:10:31,487\nWhatever you mess with is pretty easy\nto fix, you can undo what was done.\n\n195\n00:10:31,487 --> 00:10:35,642\nIt's kinda hard to ruin or break your\ncomputer right here in the Control Panel.\n\n196\n00:10:35,642 --> 00:10:38,449\nBut once you go into your\nAdministrative Tools,\n\n197\n00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:42,562\nthese give you the ability to do\nadditional changes far more advanced.\n\n198\n00:10:42,562 --> 00:10:45,457\nAnd these are well beyond\nthe scope of a normal end user and\n\n199\n00:10:45,457 --> 00:10:48,483\nso it's stuff that you typically\nwon't want to mess with.\n\n200\n00:10:48,483 --> 00:10:52,286\nAnd if you do, well, there's\nseveral bad things that can happen.\n\n201\n00:10:52,286 --> 00:10:54,198\nYou could weaken\nthe security of your system,\n\n202\n00:10:54,198 --> 00:10:57,348\nwhich would make it where you could\npotentially get infected with viruses.\n\n203\n00:10:57,348 --> 00:10:59,329\nYou can actually do damage to your system,\n\n204\n00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:03,083\nthere's some things you can do in here\nthat can put undo stress on your hardware.\n\n205\n00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,683\nSo if you know what you're doing, great.\n\n206\n00:11:05,683 --> 00:11:07,587\nJump in here and use these,\nthey're really powerful.\n\n207\n00:11:07,587 --> 00:11:11,779\nAnd for those of you that go on to do the\nMCSA certification, we spend a lot of time\n\n208\n00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:16,050\nin these Administrative Tools, cuz as\na system administrator, you need them.\n\n209\n00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,729\nRight?\nThey give you that control, but\n\n210\n00:11:17,729 --> 00:11:20,323\nfor your average end user,\nyou don't go in here, right?\n\n211\n00:11:20,323 --> 00:11:24,888\nThese are areas that mostly center\naround security and other pieces, but\n\n212\n00:11:24,888 --> 00:11:27,390\nother things, your Windows Firewall,\n\n213\n00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:31,734\nyou've got your Memory Diagnostics for\nhardware troubleshooting,\n\n214\n00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:36,168\nsome really advanced stuff that just\nend users don't typically need.\n\n215\n00:11:36,168 --> 00:11:38,202\nAll right.\nSo as far as the Control Panel,\n\n216\n00:11:38,202 --> 00:11:40,200\nthere is a lot of stuff in here.\n\n217\n00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,594\nIt can be kinda difficult to navigate\nif this is your first time seeing it.\n\n218\n00:11:43,594 --> 00:11:47,961\nSo to help with that, if you're not\nsure exactly what you're looking for,\n\n219\n00:11:47,961 --> 00:11:50,839\nyou can use the little\nsearch feature right here.\n\n220\n00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:53,416\nSo if I know I want to\nconfigure my sound settings.\n\n221\n00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,796\nSo Windows, it's too loud or too quiet or\n\n222\n00:11:55,796 --> 00:11:59,953\nmakes these beeping noises that I\ndon't like, I wanna mess with sound.\n\n223\n00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:03,928\nWell, if I know to go to Hardware and\nSound and go in here and\n\n224\n00:12:03,928 --> 00:12:06,779\nstart modifying settings, then great.\n\n225\n00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:07,801\nI know where to go.\n\n226\n00:12:07,801 --> 00:12:12,681\nBut if I don't, right up here in\nthe search box, I can type sound and\n\n227\n00:12:12,681 --> 00:12:18,006\nit'll filter it down to show me all\nthe settings that apply just to sound.\n\n228\n00:12:18,006 --> 00:12:22,365\nAnd when I go back to that main screen,\nit says, Hardware and Sound, but\n\n229\n00:12:22,365 --> 00:12:23,729\nlook at these topics.\n\n230\n00:12:23,729 --> 00:12:26,790\nView devices and printers,\nadd a device, connect a projector,\n\n231\n00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:30,254\nadjust commonly used mobility settings and\nnone of these mention sound.\n\n232\n00:12:30,254 --> 00:12:30,869\nRight?\n\n233\n00:12:30,869 --> 00:12:35,559\nBut when I type sound up here right at\nthe top, I get Change Sound Card Settings,\n\n234\n00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:39,774\nChange System Sounds, Adjust System\nVolume, Manage Audio Devices.\n\n235\n00:12:39,774 --> 00:12:42,014\nIt's all geared towards what I want.\n\n236\n00:12:42,014 --> 00:12:46,702\nSo that little search feature is really\nhandy to find the settings you need,\n\n237\n00:12:46,702 --> 00:12:49,641\nif you don't remember\nexactly where they are.\n\n238\n00:12:49,641 --> 00:12:52,614\nAll right.\nSo that's basically the Control Panel.\n\n239\n00:12:52,614 --> 00:12:56,375\nBrowse around in it and explore, you'll\nsee there's a lot of stuff in there.\n\n240\n00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,871\nSome you may never need,\nsome you may use every day.\n\n241\n00:12:58,871 --> 00:12:59,610\nRight?\n\n242\n00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,784\nBut you'll definitely wanna\ncheck a lot of that out.\n\n243\n00:13:02,784 --> 00:13:04,416\nAll right?\nWhat's next on our agenda, Ronnie?\n\n244\n00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,679\nIt looks like- We have\nsome desktop settings.\n\n245\n00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:09,944\nWe wanna make sure then that every user,\nof course,\n\n246\n00:13:09,944 --> 00:13:14,325\nknows you can help a user be able\nchange things like the resolution, or\n\n247\n00:13:14,325 --> 00:13:18,576\neven to change the way the background\nactually ends up looking too.\n\n248\n00:13:18,576 --> 00:13:20,820\nYou could go through the Control Panel,\nbut\n\n249\n00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,616\nI'm a habitual right-clicker\non everything, Don.\n\n250\n00:13:23,616 --> 00:13:26,719\nAnd so the easiest way that I know how\nto get to it is by right-clicking on\n\n251\n00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:29,515\nthe desktop and that'll bring a nice,\nlittle shortcut menu and\n\n252\n00:13:29,515 --> 00:13:32,344\nthen I can go down to those three\noptions that we see right there.\n\n253\n00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:36,421\nScreen resolution is pretty much\nthe one that I was thinking about.\n\n254\n00:13:36,421 --> 00:13:36,938\nYeah, so\n\n255\n00:13:36,938 --> 00:13:41,229\nyou can right-click anywhere you want\non the desktop, you just pick a place.\n\n256\n00:13:41,229 --> 00:13:42,493\nNot on an icon, right?\n\n257\n00:13:42,493 --> 00:13:44,122\nYeah.\n[LAUGH] If you right-click on an icon,\n\n258\n00:13:44,122 --> 00:13:44,973\nyou get icon stuff.\n\n259\n00:13:44,973 --> 00:13:49,043\nBut if you right-click on any blank spot\non your desktop, you'll get this menu and\n\n260\n00:13:49,043 --> 00:13:51,834\nscreen resolution is a great\none to start with, Ronnie,\n\n261\n00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:54,122\ncuz this is a problem on\na lot of new computers.\n\n262\n00:13:54,122 --> 00:13:59,013\nMost new computers today are shipping\nat a resolution of 1920 by 1080,\n\n263\n00:13:59,013 --> 00:14:01,134\nthat is a really high resolution.\n\n264\n00:14:01,134 --> 00:14:05,761\nAnd if you're a big monitor, if you're\non a 27 inch monitor, it looks great and\n\n265\n00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,727\nit's super easy to use and\nyou get HD quality video.\n\n266\n00:14:08,727 --> 00:14:09,911\nIt's awesome.\n\n267\n00:14:09,911 --> 00:14:13,408\nBut if you're on a 12 inch laptop,\nit is microscopic.\n\n268\n00:14:13,408 --> 00:14:16,791\nIt is microscopic.\nIt is really hard to read what's going on.\n\n269\n00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:20,288\nAnd so adjusting that screen\nresolution lets you fix that.\n\n270\n00:14:20,288 --> 00:14:22,016\nIf I go into my screen resolution,\n\n271\n00:14:22,016 --> 00:14:26,318\nI can see I've got this computer at 1280\nby 720 and the text is pretty legible.\n\n272\n00:14:26,318 --> 00:14:29,197\nI can read this,\nI'm not having to squint to look at it.\n\n273\n00:14:29,197 --> 00:14:32,959\nThings look good on my screen,\nbut what if I bump that up?\n\n274\n00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,539\nRight?\n\n275\n00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,337\nI'm gonna bump it up\nto 1920 by 1080 right?\n\n276\n00:14:36,337 --> 00:14:37,219\nWe'll take that all the way up.\n\n277\n00:14:37,219 --> 00:14:41,641\n[LAUGH] And when I bump that up,\nit's gonna adjust my resolution.\n\n278\n00:14:41,641 --> 00:14:42,756\nHere we go.\n\n279\n00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:47,403\nAnd now look how small everything got,\nall right?\n\n280\n00:14:47,403 --> 00:14:50,393\nThings get really tiny,\nI can barely read that text and\n\n281\n00:14:50,393 --> 00:14:52,476\nthe computer's right in front of me.\n\n282\n00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:53,605\nRight?\n\n283\n00:14:53,605 --> 00:14:55,516\nThis is a lot more challenging.\n\n284\n00:14:55,516 --> 00:14:57,558\nIf this were on a big monitor, right?\n\n285\n00:14:57,558 --> 00:15:00,798\nStretched out to be large,\nthis would look great.\n\n286\n00:15:00,798 --> 00:15:02,737\nBut on a tiny screen, it's not going to.\n\n287\n00:15:02,737 --> 00:15:07,219\nSo adjusting resolution is pretty\nimportant, if you wanna go in and\n\n288\n00:15:07,219 --> 00:15:08,797\ntweak those settings.\n\n289\n00:15:08,797 --> 00:15:12,784\nAnd I lowered mine down and it's not\nalways the best way to do it though,\n\n290\n00:15:12,784 --> 00:15:13,325\nRonnie.\n\n291\n00:15:13,325 --> 00:15:18,164\nSo when you lower resolution like that,\nif I take it down to 1280 by 720,\n\n292\n00:15:18,164 --> 00:15:21,359\nI'm actually making my\nscreen a little less sharp.\n\n293\n00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:21,904\nRight?\n\n294\n00:15:21,904 --> 00:15:25,948\nAnd so if you're a video gamer or\nyou're concerned about video quality,\n\n295\n00:15:25,948 --> 00:15:28,568\nthat isn't necessarily\nthe greatest option.\n\n296\n00:15:28,568 --> 00:15:32,465\nYour monitor might be specifically\ndesigned to operate at 1920 by 1080 or\n\n297\n00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:34,733\nsome higher resolution,\nso I had some higher.\n\n298\n00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:38,225\nWell, in that scenario,\ninstead of making the screen bigger,\n\n299\n00:15:38,225 --> 00:15:42,314\nyou can just make the text bigger and\nso you'll see that option right here.\n\n300\n00:15:42,314 --> 00:15:45,620\nMake text and\nother items larger or smaller and\n\n301\n00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,961\nthe default is they're set to smaller,\nwhich is 100%.\n\n302\n00:15:49,961 --> 00:15:50,541\nRight?\n\n303\n00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:55,128\nBut you can boost it to 125 or 150%,\nso if you've on a massive resolution,\n\n304\n00:15:55,128 --> 00:15:58,197\neven on a small screen,\nyou can make the text legible.\n\n305\n00:15:58,197 --> 00:16:01,027\nSo those are the two settings\nin screen resolution or\n\n306\n00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:04,065\nGet in that panel that I usually\nI usually jump right to.\n\n307\n00:16:04,065 --> 00:16:04,739\nYeah.\n\n308\n00:16:04,739 --> 00:16:09,094\nThe only thing about setting this one when\nyou do change that text a lot of times,\n\n309\n00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:13,060\nit's going to ask you to log and\nlog back in when you do that.\n\n310\n00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:16,440\nSo, if that ends up happening, if you're\nin the middle of doing something right,\n\n311\n00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,770\ndon't just log out, make sure you\nsave all your stuff and then logout,\n\n312\n00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,320\nand log back in.\n\n313\n00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,450\nAnd you'll see the text size will change,\nand everything will look fairly nice.\n\n314\n00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,900\nYeah.\n\n315\n00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,380\nNow, that was the screen resolution,\nright?\n\n316\n00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,010\nBeneath that are gadgets.\n\n317\n00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,130\nNow, what are gadgets?\n\n318\n00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,020\nI will tell you.\n\n319\n00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:34,690\n[LAUGH] Gadgets are pretty pointless and\nnot something that people need anymore.\n\n320\n00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,800\nThey were really cool way\nback in Windows '98, and\n\n321\n00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,950\nthey got a little cooler in Windows Vista.\n\n322\n00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,630\nBut in Windows 7 and on,\nthe gadgets are kinda pointless.\n\n323\n00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:47,560\nBut the idea with the gadget was\nyou can add icons to your desktop\n\n324\n00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,230\nthat did something more than\njust launched a program.\n\n325\n00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,980\nI could have an icon on my desktop\nthat actually displayed the weather or\n\n326\n00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,400\nthe CPU utilization on my system.\n\n327\n00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,720\nAnd those were gadgets.\n\n328\n00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,220\nAnd in previous versions of Windows,\nyou could put them wherever you wanted, or\n\n329\n00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,400\nyou could have what was called a Side Bar.\n\n330\n00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,180\nAnd the side bar was over here on the\nright of your screen where these, yeah,\n\n331\n00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,640\nit just would reside.\n\n332\n00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,590\nSo when you right click on the desktop and\n\n333\n00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:14,640\nchoose gadgets, that's what you\nare configuring are these little icons,\n\n334\n00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,480\nthese widgets basically that\nwe can add to our system.\n\n335\n00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,940\nSo, I mentioned weather.\n\n336\n00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,550\nLet's see, do we have weather.\n\n337\n00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,670\nWeather yeah, we got weather.\n\n338\n00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:21,650\nThis is a big one.\n\n339\n00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:25,180\nI'm just gonna take it, and drag it,\nand drop it, and stick it right there.\n\n340\n00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,910\nAnd then, we'll do the CPU meter for\nmy performance.\n\n341\n00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,090\nI'll drag that out and\ndrop it out here too.\n\n342\n00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:30,740\nAll right.\n\n343\n00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,970\nSo, these are my widgets.\n\n344\n00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,620\nNow, in Windows Vista,\n\n345\n00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,260\nthey were bound to a side bar that\nwas stuck on the side of the screen.\n\n346\n00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,430\nIn Windows 7,\nyou can put them wherever you want.\n\n347\n00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:42,260\nRight, so\nI can have them sitting way over here, and\n\n348\n00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,730\nsome of them have various\nsettings that you can adjust.\n\n349\n00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,230\nI don't know if this one does,\nbut I know the weather does.\n\n350\n00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,930\nYou'll notice my weather\nwidget is showing New York.\n\n351\n00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,380\nWell, I'm not in New York.\n\n352\n00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,950\nSo if I float my mouse over it,\nI can hit this gear or wrench, and\n\n353\n00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,880\nI can change it to another city.\n\n354\n00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,590\nSo, we're in Gainesville, Florida.\n\n355\n00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,690\nAll right.\nSo I'll just punch that in.\n\n356\n00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,440\nAnd we'll search that out.\n\n357\n00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,020\nThere we go.\n\n358\n00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,960\nAnd so, now it's gonna show\nthe weather here in Gainesville.\n\n359\n00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,295\nAnd I can see it's a nice,\nwarm 41 degrees outside.\n\n360\n00:18:12,295 --> 00:18:15,201\n[LAUGH] Which I know if you're in\nWisconsin, you're laughing at us.\n\n361\n00:18:15,201 --> 00:18:17,000\n[LAUGH] But for us,\nthat's pretty darn cold.\n\n362\n00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,780\nSo there, I got my weather.\n\n363\n00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,550\nAnd there were other settings\nin there you could tweak.\n\n364\n00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:23,200\nIt seems like there's a way to make\nthis thing bigger, isn't there, Ronnie?\n\n365\n00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,240\nHow do you?\n\n366\n00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:24,810\nYes.\n\n367\n00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:25,310\nMaybe not.\n\n368\n00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,610\nIs it not the arrow right above that?\n\n369\n00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:29,430\nLarger.\nThere we we go, yeah,\n\n370\n00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,400\nwe can make it a little bit bigger.\n\n371\n00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,120\nSo, you pick how you\nwant that gadget to be.\n\n372\n00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,800\nSo these are kind of neat,\nyou can have them just sitting around,\n\n373\n00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,900\ndoing whatever it is\nthat you want them to do.\n\n374\n00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:43,540\nThe problem with the gadget is,\nwhat happens when you launch a program?\n\n375\n00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,420\nSo, how effective is that gadget\nwhen it's in the background?\n\n376\n00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,620\nAnd that's why a lot of people don't\nmake use of the gadgets because you\n\n377\n00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,280\njust don't see them.\n\n378\n00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,580\nYou only see them when all of\nyour programs are minimized.\n\n379\n00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,360\nAnd if all of your programs are minimized,\nyou're not doing anything.\n\n380\n00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,300\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] So you know, it just,\nwe don't see a lot of use of these.\n\n381\n00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:02,800\nBut they are there.\n\n382\n00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,636\nYou can have fun with them.\n\n383\n00:19:05,636 --> 00:19:06,870\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n384\n00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,170\nSo, those are some gadgets.\n\n385\n00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,238\nWhat was the third one?\n\n386\n00:19:09,238 --> 00:19:11,212\nOh, personalized.\n\n387\n00:19:11,212 --> 00:19:12,900\nPersonalized.\n\n388\n00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,610\nSo, Personalized allows us to be able\n\n389\n00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,800\nto change the entire look\nof the desktop itself.\n\n390\n00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,530\nWe use to really harp\non the idea of themes.\n\n391\n00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,370\nToday, they call it Personalization.\n\n392\n00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,180\nBecause it can match up to you,\nand normally,\n\n393\n00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,250\nthere's actually multiple\npeople using the same computer.\n\n394\n00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,330\nAnd they can then have different\npersonalization settings that will\n\n395\n00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:34,760\nactually suit their personalities.\n\n396\n00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,780\nYeah, this Windows background here with\nsome kind of plant life on it, and\n\n397\n00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,760\nwhatever, that might\nnot be your cup of tea.\n\n398\n00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,810\nI know for me it is, and\nI always disable this thing right away.\n\n399\n00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:45,630\nSo, if you right click and\n\n400\n00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,840\ngo to personalize, you'll see\nwhere you can start to tweak that.\n\n401\n00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,810\nAnd the main thing are themes.\n\n402\n00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:52,130\nYou can pick various themes.\n\n403\n00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:56,570\nAnd so, maybe I want,\nlet's go with nature themes.\n\n404\n00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,030\nSo I'm going to click on that and\nI'll see my screen changes.\n\n405\n00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:03,600\nAnd now I've got this nice little\nplant wallpaper of some sort, and\n\n406\n00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,860\nvarious things have updated and changed\non my screen to reflect this new theme.\n\n407\n00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,160\nAnd you can create your own\ncustom theme if you want.\n\n408\n00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,610\nThere's more online you can browse and\nfind.\n\n409\n00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:15,550\nWhat I do though,\nI like to go to Windows classic.\n\n410\n00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,300\nI like to put it all\nthe way back to old school\n\n411\n00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,770\nbecause this turns off a lot of\nthe graphic acceleration and\n\n412\n00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:25,230\nall of that crazy stuff, and it can make\nthe system run a little more efficiently.\n\n413\n00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:29,720\nIf you don't take advantage of the fancy\ngraphics, but we do lose a lot of\n\n414\n00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,830\nthe prettiness of Windows,\nthere is also some high-contrast ones.\n\n415\n00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:40,530\nAgain, if you're visually impaired, maybe\nnot blind, but you have tunnel vision or\n\n416\n00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:45,040\nsome kind of visual degradation,\nsometimes you need greater contrast.\n\n417\n00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,590\nThere's this trend right now,\nand I absolutely hate it,\n\n418\n00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:51,550\nwhere websites are doing light\ngray text on a white background.\n\n419\n00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,530\nI don't know why this is in style,\nI don't know why people do it.\n\n420\n00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:58,690\nEven if you have perfectly healthy eyes,\nit's hard to read that stuff.\n\n421\n00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,340\nAnd so, the high contrast\nmodes go to help with that.\n\n422\n00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,400\nThey make everything nice and\nlight and dark, right.\n\n423\n00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,600\nYellow on black,\nwe can really see that difference.\n\n424\n00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,490\nReally kind of separating things out and\nmaking it easier to tell apart.\n\n425\n00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:14,950\nBut, you can personalize these, you can\ncustomize them, make whatever you want.\n\n426\n00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,440\nBut, that main Windows\ntheme is still there,\n\n427\n00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,320\nwe can always switch right back to it and\nyou're back to normal.\n\n428\n00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,350\nYeah, the personalization\nreally does help when you\n\n429\n00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:28,180\nhave different people working on\nthe computer or on the same computer.\n\n430\n00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,530\nCuz I know you don't just walk up and go,\nhey, wait a minute, it's not my computer.\n\n431\n00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,730\nThey personalize it\nthe way that they have.\n\n432\n00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,790\nVisually be able to go, wait,\nsomething else is different.\n\n433\n00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,900\nCheck out who's logged in and\n\n434\n00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,950\nyou'll probably find out somebody\nelse is logged in instead of you.\n\n435\n00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,630\nYeah.\nNow,\n\n436\n00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,260\none customization that a lot\nof people are going to make\n\n437\n00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,420\nis to change the icons that\nare available on-screen.\n\n438\n00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,190\nWhen we look at this desktop,\nlet's bring this desktop back up.\n\n439\n00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:53,170\nWhen we look at it, we've got\na recycle bin sitting on our desk.\n\n440\n00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:55,880\nAnd that's where we would throw\nfiles we wanted to delete.\n\n441\n00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,460\nAnd that's it.\n\n442\n00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,680\nThere's no other icons\nright here on our desktop.\n\n443\n00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,290\nIt's empty.\n\n444\n00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:04,660\nAnd what people used to do is they\nused to put icons on their desktop for\n\n445\n00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,360\nthe programs they ran all the time.\n\n446\n00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,820\nAnd you can still do that.\n\n447\n00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,180\nIf we find a program\nthat we run all the time.\n\n448\n00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,880\nSo, maybe like the Window's calculator.\n\n449\n00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,700\nI use that calculator everyday,\nso I want an icon for it.\n\n450\n00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:21,780\nWell, you can right click on that, and\nyou'll see some various options in here.\n\n451\n00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,510\nAnd actually, you know what,\n\n452\n00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:26,060\nwe don't have the, [LAUGH],\nthe option that I was looking for.\n\n453\n00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,070\nThere used to be an option where\nyou could do send to desktop, and\n\n454\n00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:30,370\nit would create that shortcut\nright on your desktop.\n\n455\n00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:33,950\nBut in Windows 7, Microsoft doesn't\nwant you to have to do that anymore,\n\n456\n00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:36,510\nyou still can, right,\nso we actually could.\n\n457\n00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:42,930\nIf you hold your right mouse button,\nyou can drag it and let it go and\n\n458\n00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:45,430\nsee how it is saying\nCreate Link in desktop.\n\n459\n00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,830\nAnd so, I can do that and\nI'll choose create shortcut here.\n\n460\n00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:51,000\nAnd there it is,\nI've got it on my desktop.\n\n461\n00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,050\nSo, we can still create icons for all of\nour programs right there on the desktop,\n\n462\n00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,950\nand when we want them, we can fire it up.\n\n463\n00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,190\nBut, Microsoft doesn't want\nyou to do that anymore,\n\n464\n00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,590\nthat's why they removed that\nSend to desktop option.\n\n465\n00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:07,700\nAnd the reason is they've given us other\nmethods, they made this even easier.\n\n466\n00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:12,160\nThe problem with icons on your desktop\nis the same problem with gadgets.\n\n467\n00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,450\nWhat do you see when\nyou're running a program?\n\n468\n00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,320\nYour icons are all hidden.\n\n469\n00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,900\nYou don't see the desktop.\n\n470\n00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:20,600\nSo you have to minimize your windows to be\nable to see what was in the background and\n\n471\n00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,980\nthat's just not ideal.\n\n472\n00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:26,710\nSo we now have two new options for when we\nhave a program that we use all the time\n\n473\n00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:31,290\nthat we want to make readily available,\nand they're the pin options.\n\n474\n00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:35,950\nYou can pin any program to your\nStart menu or to your task bar.\n\n475\n00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:39,450\nNow the Start menu,\nthat's this menu over here, right?\n\n476\n00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,660\nAnd if I use calculator all the time,\n\n477\n00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:46,160\nit's probably already showing\nup in this list, right?\n\n478\n00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,130\nIf I go into All Programs, I'll see all\nthe different programs that I want.\n\n479\n00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:54,022\nAnd if I go back here, this is just\nthe last ten that I've run, all right?\n\n480\n00:23:54,022 --> 00:23:55,229\nAnd so, if I run them all the time,\n\n481\n00:23:55,229 --> 00:23:57,378\nit might just happen to be in\nthe last ten and it'll be there.\n\n482\n00:23:57,378 --> 00:24:00,200\nBut let's say Windows DVD Maker.\n\n483\n00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,360\nThat's the one that I use all the time,\nright?\n\n484\n00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,830\nWell, it's not under here because it's\nnot one of the last ten that I ran.\n\n485\n00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:10,380\nAnd if I run it, Window's DVD maker,\nso I'll fire that up.\n\n486\n00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,540\nSo, there it is.\n\n487\n00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:16,380\nAnd now when I bring up my Start Menu,\nit may make it onto this list or,\n\n488\n00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:21,150\nsince I've only run it once,\nit may just not make it there.\n\n489\n00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:25,790\nSo instead,\nI can right click on Windows DVD Maker and\n\n490\n00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:28,980\nI can choose Pin to Start Menu.\n\n491\n00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:33,600\nWhen you do that,\nit will force it to be on the Start Menu.\n\n492\n00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,000\nSo you'll now have this little\nsection up here at the top and\n\n493\n00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,240\nit will always be there.\n\n494\n00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,840\nDoesn't matter if you\nhaven't run it in six months,\n\n495\n00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,210\nit will still be right there and\neasy to get at.\n\n496\n00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:45,170\nThe advantage here is, I could be\nin ten different programs, right?\n\n497\n00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:48,050\nI could be running all sorts of\ndifferent stuff on my computer.\n\n498\n00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:50,570\nI've got all these different windows open,\nand\n\n499\n00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,950\nI don't have to minimize all\nthese windows to see my icon.\n\n500\n00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:56,530\nI can just go to the Start Menu,\nand there's Windows DVD Maker.\n\n501\n00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,820\nI can fire it right up,\nand I'm in business.\n\n502\n00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,150\nSo that's a pretty cool way to be\nable to get at that pretty quickly.\n\n503\n00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:06,810\nThe other way to do this is to\npin it instead to the taskbar,\n\n504\n00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:09,410\nwhich is the bar across\nthe bottom of the screen.\n\n505\n00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,700\nAnd in Windows 7,\nthey've made it a lot easier because now,\n\n506\n00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,150\nthese icons are relatively large, so\n\n507\n00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:17,170\nthat we can actually see what we're\nactually clicking on, instead.\n\n508\n00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:18,710\nYep.\n\n509\n00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,580\nSo I'm gonna pin that to my taskbar.\n\n510\n00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,680\nAnd now, looking right down here at\nthe taskbar, I've got the icon for\n\n511\n00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,910\nWindows DVD Maker, right there.\n\n512\n00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:29,200\nNow, notice how it doesn't have a box\naround it, like the other icons.\n\n513\n00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,380\nIf there's a box around it,\nthat means it's currently running.\n\n514\n00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,350\nIf there's no box around it,\nit's just a shortcut.\n\n515\n00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,270\nAnd so, if I wanna run Windows DVD Maker,\n\n516\n00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,970\nI don't even have to bring\nup my Start Menu any more.\n\n517\n00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:43,240\nI can just click right on that icon and\nnow, it's up and running.\n\n518\n00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,950\nAnd you'll see where the icon now\nhas a box around it, all right?\n\n519\n00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,270\nSo it's boxed up.\n\n520\n00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,660\nI know it's running and here I am.\n\n521\n00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,730\nAnd if I'm using other programs right now,\n\n522\n00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:56,010\nI still know that DVD Maker\nis running in the background.\n\n523\n00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:59,950\nAnd if I click on its icon,\nit'll switch over, and there we go, right?\n\n524\n00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,860\nSo pinning to the Start Menu and\n\n525\n00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:07,190\npinning to the Taskbar have kind of\nreplaced putting icons on your desktop.\n\n526\n00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,860\nAnd that's why when you\ninstall windows for\n\n527\n00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:12,510\nthe first time,\nyou won't have any icons on your desktop.\n\n528\n00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,709\nAll right, and\nwe just don't really need them anymore.\n\n529\n00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:23,970\nAll right, we got one other little tidbit\nto touch on when it comes to the desktop.\n\n530\n00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,990\nWhen I was picking themes\nyou might have noticed that\n\n531\n00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:30,220\nsome themes were labeled as Aero themes.\n\n532\n00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,935\nAnd some were just labeled\nas just regular themes.\n\n533\n00:26:31,935 --> 00:26:34,059\nNow what is Aero?\n\n534\n00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:37,883\nThat's A-E-R-O.\n\n535\n00:26:37,883 --> 00:26:44,680\nAero, is actually the user interface for\nwindows.\n\n536\n00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:49,430\nIt's a 3D accelerated,\nfairly powerful user interface.\n\n537\n00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:52,870\nThe problem with Aero,\nit's not a problem I guess.\n\n538\n00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:55,450\nThe thing to remember with Aero,\n\n539\n00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:59,870\nis it leverages your video card that\nf you have a really fancy video card,\n\n540\n00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:03,660\nit can use the power of that video card\nto render the user interface in Windows.\n\n541\n00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:06,625\nIf you have a really old video card\nthough that's not very powerful at all,\n\n542\n00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,750\nAero might not work.\n\n543\n00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:13,285\nAnd so in that scenario when you boot\nWindows it will actually turn Aero off.\n\n544\n00:27:13,285 --> 00:27:16,870\nAero is pretty to recognize because\nit makes the screen look neat.\n\n545\n00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,860\nLet me show you an example.\n\n546\n00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:24,440\nAll right, I know that I'm running Aero\nbecause when I look at my taskbar,\n\n547\n00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,460\nit's semitransparent.\n\n548\n00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,580\nI can see through it, right?\n\n549\n00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,428\nAnd when I launch other windows,\nthey're semitransparent too.\n\n550\n00:27:32,428 --> 00:27:39,300\nNotice how my title bar,\nthis bar here at the top of the window.\n\n551\n00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,740\nWhat's in it is kind of changing,\n\n552\n00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,490\nif I moved in front of these pictures I\ncan see that ladies eyes are showing up.\n\n553\n00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:48,100\nIt's semi transparent, that's one of\nthe effects of the Aero interface.\n\n554\n00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,780\nIn fact they called it Aero\nglass originally, right?\n\n555\n00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:54,980\nSo it was glass that we could look\nthrough, that's a neat effect.\n\n556\n00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,550\nAnd that's not the only\nthing that arrow does.\n\n557\n00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,210\nEverything, form bringing up your menu,\n\n558\n00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:05,280\nto the animation that happens when\nyou make a window larger or smaller.\n\n559\n00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,190\nAll of that is being\nrendered by your video card.\n\n560\n00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:12,860\nAnd that's usually a lot faster than just\nusing the regular CPU in your computer,\n\n561\n00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,550\nwhere you'll really see that\nis with smooth video playback.\n\n562\n00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,450\nLet me show you an example.\n\n563\n00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:22,510\nI've got a video here, and\nthis is a movie trailer, and\n\n564\n00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:27,640\nof course it wants to play really big,\nI'm gonna make it small.\n\n565\n00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,280\nAnd my desktop is doing a little\nscreen sharing thing, so\n\n566\n00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,330\nthat you guys can see it, and that's\ngoing to effect the way this plays back.\n\n567\n00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:37,190\nBut, so let me give it a second\nto kind of settle down there.\n\n568\n00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:40,910\nBut basically when you're playing a video,\n\n569\n00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:43,850\nin the past if you started\nmoving it around on the screen.\n\n570\n00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:48,110\nBecause it was being rendered in software\nthe video would pause as it was moving.\n\n571\n00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:51,120\nBut here's it's not being rendered in\nsoftware, it's being rendered in hardware,\n\n572\n00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,620\nyour video card is doing it.\n\n573\n00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,870\nSo if I start moving the window around,\n\n574\n00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:57,280\nsee how the video is\nplaying the whole time.\n\n575\n00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,700\nThe video is not actually stopping,\n\n576\n00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,840\nit's continuing to play while it's moving,\nthat's Aero that's doing that.\n\n577\n00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,210\nIt's enabling that video to be directly\nrendered through the video card.\n\n578\n00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:13,130\nIf we turn off Aero, all of that\nfunctionality disappears, okay?\n\n579\n00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:16,510\nAnd the way you turn it off is by, well,\n\n580\n00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:19,730\nswitching that theme from an Aero\ntheme to a non-Aero theme.\n\n581\n00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:25,480\nSo, if I go back to my personalized menu,\nand here's my arrow themes,\n\n582\n00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,660\nand if I scroll down I\ncan find basic themes.\n\n583\n00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,508\nAnd if I pick WIndows 7 Basic,\n\n584\n00:29:31,508 --> 00:29:37,870\nit's gonna look basically the same but\nall the effects are gone.\n\n585\n00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:40,210\nNotice my taskbar is\nno longer transparent.\n\n586\n00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:42,600\nThe top of this bar is\nno longer transparent.\n\n587\n00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,650\nAs I move it around,\nif I bring up that web page again,\n\n588\n00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,190\nI don't know if that lady\nwill still be on it or not.\n\n589\n00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,190\nNow there she is.\n\n590\n00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:54,070\nSo if I put this on top of her face there,\nI don't see her eyes anymore, right?\n\n591\n00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,350\nSo I've lost that acceleration.\n\n592\n00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:02,810\nNow, if you don't have a 3D video card\nin your system, which most people do.\n\n593\n00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:06,040\nIf you don't, then Windows will\nautomatically disable it, and\n\n594\n00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,860\nyou'll see it like this.\n\n595\n00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,680\nSo if you're looking at my\nscreen a minute ago, and saying,\n\n596\n00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,110\nmine doesn't look like that.\n\n597\n00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,370\nWell, it's probably just\nyour video card but\n\n598\n00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:15,880\nif you have a 3D video card, it will\nenable an Aero and it's pretty slick.\n\n599\n00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,900\nYou get some neat benefits\nout of running that.\n\n600\n00:30:20,642 --> 00:30:23,380\nAll right, so\nthat's basically the nuts and\n\n601\n00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:27,920\nbolts of it as far as our\ndesktop settings are concerned.\n\n602\n00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:32,330\nSo, in this segment we got a chance to\nsee the Control Panel and how that works.\n\n603\n00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,710\nAnd we got a chance to see\nthe desktop settings, and\n\n604\n00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,480\nsome basic customizations there.\n\n605\n00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,260\nWe've got more to talk on,\nlooks like we got, what two or\n\n606\n00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,130\nthree more topics to hit on.\n\n607\n00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:44,606\nSo, stay tuned, we're not done yet.\n\n608\n00:30:44,606 --> 00:30:48,250\nBut for right now, we're gonna take a\nbreak and we'll be back in just a moment.\n\n609\n00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:55,827\n[MUSIC]\n\n610\n00:30:55,827 --> 00:30:57,670\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n611\n00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:00,430\nSo in the first segment we took\na look at some various settings and\n\n612\n00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:03,318\nconfigurations in the Operating System.\n\n613\n00:31:03,318 --> 00:31:07,180\nNow, I wanna take a look at some of the\nnative applications that are included with\n\n614\n00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:07,770\nWindows, right?\n\n615\n00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:11,550\nWhen you install Windows 7 you don't\njust get the OS and that's it.\n\n616\n00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:14,350\nThere's a couple of general purpose,\n\n617\n00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:17,700\ncommon use applications that are\ninstalled, and you're welcome to use them.\n\n618\n00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,220\nThey're fairly basic, and\n\n619\n00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,470\nyou might choose to swap them\nout with third party software.\n\n620\n00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:25,040\nBut what Microsoft is trying to do is\ngive you just basic functionality so\n\n621\n00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,670\nthat you can use your system on day one\n\n622\n00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:30,560\neven if you don't choose to bring\nin anybody else's software.\n\n623\n00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,040\nNow, Microsoft really\ndid this very nicely so\n\n624\n00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,900\nthat when you buy the computer you\ndon't have to immediately go out and\n\n625\n00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,960\nbuy a word processing program or\neven a calculator.\n\n626\n00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:44,297\nAnd Nate said even a basic graphics\nutility such as Paint that's out there,\n\n627\n00:31:44,297 --> 00:31:47,025\nyou can actually use\nwhat's already built in.\n\n628\n00:31:47,025 --> 00:31:50,545\nAnd as limited as it is,\nit is a tool that you can use and\n\n629\n00:31:50,545 --> 00:31:55,343\nat least get basic functionality and\nWindows calls these accessories.\n\n630\n00:31:55,343 --> 00:31:58,733\nAnd accessories have been around for\na long, long time.\n\n631\n00:31:58,733 --> 00:32:02,868\nAnd so we still have those picker\ntools with us, even in Windows 7.\n\n632\n00:32:02,868 --> 00:32:05,030\nYeah, let's take a look at some of them.\n\n633\n00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,950\nRight?\nSo, when you install Windows and\n\n634\n00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:09,190\nlook at the desktop,\nthings are fairly blank.\n\n635\n00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,848\nRight?\nThere's not a whole lot there.\n\n636\n00:32:10,848 --> 00:32:13,773\nBut when we go under our Start Menu,\nand all programs,\n\n637\n00:32:13,773 --> 00:32:17,715\nyou'll see some programs right here,\nthings like Windows Fax and Scan,\n\n638\n00:32:17,715 --> 00:32:22,400\nWindows Media Center and Media Player,\nWindows DVD Maker, right?\n\n639\n00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,940\nThese are little software packages\nthat are made available and\n\n640\n00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:29,660\nyou're ready to use, but these may or\nmay not be present on your system if you\n\n641\n00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:32,900\nhave the Windows 7 home edition,\nor Enterprise, or whatever.\n\n642\n00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,970\nSome of these may be there, some may not.\n\n643\n00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:39,680\nBut under the Accessories folder, if we\ngo under there we're going to see some\n\n644\n00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:44,360\ncommon utilities that are present\non all of the versions of Windows.\n\n645\n00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,200\nSome of the bigger ones,\n\n646\n00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,670\nRonnie, you mentioned a word processor and\ncalculator, right?\n\n647\n00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:48,660\nSo I can look down here and\n\n648\n00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:53,110\nfind WordPad, oops,\nI didn't mean to click there but whatever.\n\n649\n00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:56,400\nWordPad and\nif I go back to my accessories,\n\n650\n00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,510\nright there,\nwhich is just a simple word processor.\n\n651\n00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:02,890\nIf you need to type letters,\nschool papers, documents or\n\n652\n00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,770\nwhatever, you can do that right here.\n\n653\n00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:10,430\nSo you can start to do a dear so-and-so.\n\n654\n00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:12,060\nMy name is Don.\n\n655\n00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:12,560\nAnd so on.\n\n656\n00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,480\nSo you can start to write your letters.\n\n657\n00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,510\nYou got your font formatting,\nyour pagination,\n\n658\n00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:20,360\nall the various things you might\nneed in a simple word processor.\n\n659\n00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:24,450\nIt even does spell checking,\nso this is the spell checker.\n\n660\n00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:28,900\nAnd then up here we got a little,\nwhere is that Spell Checker button?\n\n661\n00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:35,170\nAm I lying, is the spell checker, they\ndidn't remove that, that would be crazy.\n\n662\n00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:38,160\nIt's not on the button,\nthey've removed that?\n\n663\n00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,100\nThat is crazy talk.\n\n664\n00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,265\nAll right, so it is a little bit basic\nif it doesn't even have a spell checker,\n\n665\n00:33:42,265 --> 00:33:43,960\nthen that's going to\ncause a bit of a problem.\n\n666\n00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,760\nAnd we'll find that with a lot of these\nnative applications is they're usually\n\n667\n00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,860\nmissing something, that might make us want\nto move up to something more advanced.\n\n668\n00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,040\nI'm really surprised it's not.\n\n669\n00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,940\nYeah, underlining it.\n\n670\n00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,880\nDoing a spellcheck.\n\n671\n00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,840\nYeah, it's bizarre.\n\n672\n00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,490\nBut, yeah so it will work.\n\n673\n00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:00,390\nIt'll serve its purpose, but\nyou may want something better.\n\n674\n00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,980\nSame thing with the calculator.\n\n675\n00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,850\nYou mentioned paint, right?\n\n676\n00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:04,900\nMicrosoft Paint.\n\n677\n00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,160\nThat's another utility if\nyou want to draw pictures.\n\n678\n00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,960\nIt's all right here under Accessories.\n\n679\n00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,220\nIn fact, let me open this a different\nway so we can look at some of these.\n\n680\n00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,499\nLet's go Large Icons.\n\n681\n00:34:15,499 --> 00:34:16,820\nHere we go.\n\n682\n00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,440\nSo we've got the Calculator,\n\n683\n00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,100\nwhich is a simple calculator\nutility we can do things.\n\n684\n00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:22,870\nI say it's simple.\n\n685\n00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:23,800\nIt doesn't have to be.\n\n686\n00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,130\nIf we put it in programmer mode,\nor scientific mode.\n\n687\n00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:30,370\nYou get all sorts of extra buttons\nin there that do cool things,\n\n688\n00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:34,700\nif you're into logarithms and all that,\nit's got that functionality in there.\n\n689\n00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:39,540\nSo, it's pretty neat, we've got paint,\nthere's that drawing program.\n\n690\n00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:43,270\nSo, if you want to channel your artistic\nside, you can get in here or if you have\n\n691\n00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:47,915\nsome photos that you want to do some basic\ntouch up work with, you can do that too.\n\n692\n00:34:47,915 --> 00:34:52,240\nLike, lots of stuff kind of built into\nthat one but again, pretty basic.\n\n693\n00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:56,380\nAll right any other particular ones\nwe want to call other than that.\n\n694\n00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,130\nNo, not really.\n\n695\n00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:00,240\nYeah, well that does lead us to\nanother accessory right here,\n\n696\n00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,550\nthe snipping tool,\nwhich is a pretty cool one.\n\n697\n00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:06,980\nThe snipping tool, from time to time there\nmight be some kind of an issue on your\n\n698\n00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:10,540\nsystem where you want to take\na picture of what's on the screen.\n\n699\n00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,060\nMaybe something's not working right and\nyou get an error message.\n\n700\n00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,580\nAnd you don't know what to do.\n\n701\n00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,830\nAnd so you call tech support and\n\n702\n00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:19,000\nthey say can you send me\na picture of what's going on?\n\n703\n00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,590\nWell the snipping tool's\nthe tool that lets us do that.\n\n704\n00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:24,790\nIf I double click on it,\nit's gonna to launch.\n\n705\n00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:31,440\nAnd what it lets me do is use these cross\nhairs to select a portion of my screen.\n\n706\n00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,450\nAnd so I can come in here and\n\n707\n00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:35,720\nhighlight a portion of my screen,\nwhatever portion I want.\n\n708\n00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,170\nAnd then it takes a picture.\n\n709\n00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:41,380\nAnd so here it is, it just made a picture\nfor me of just that one window.\n\n710\n00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,920\nAll right.\n\n711\n00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:46,060\nAnd I can take that and I can email that\nto whoever, you got a little save button\n\n712\n00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:50,480\nup here as well as an email button, so you\ncan send the picture to tech support or\n\n713\n00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,320\nwhoever to be able to convey\nwhatever your issue happens to be.\n\n714\n00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,810\nThe nice thing about the snipping\ntool is its ability for\n\n715\n00:35:56,810 --> 00:36:01,450\nus to focus in on just what it is\nthat we are trying to show someone.\n\n716\n00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,000\nSo at the top you have an eraser,\nyou actually have a highlighter, and\n\n717\n00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,590\nyou have this pen, that you can then just\ncircle what you want people to focus in on\n\n718\n00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,200\nif you want them.\n\n719\n00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,910\nSo I notice you have a red pen,\nso if you wanted to circle.\n\n720\n00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,880\nYep, there it is connect to a projector.\n\n721\n00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,460\nWe can do that.\n\n722\n00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,260\nIf we wanted to highlight something,\nwe can switch over to highlighter.\n\n723\n00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,520\nAnd be able to mark that.\n\n724\n00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:23,380\nNow we could kinda do this before\nwe had the snipping tool but\n\n725\n00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:27,580\nwe would've had to do, well,\na screenprint I think is what we call it.\n\n726\n00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:31,420\nAnd that would actually take a picture of\nthe entire screen, which was great, but\n\n727\n00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:35,440\nthen you'd have to open it up in pain and\nthen you'd, you know, highlight or\n\n728\n00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,180\ncircle what you want to do and\nyou would do the same thing.\n\n729\n00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:42,100\nThe snipping tool allows you to zoom in\nexactly on what you want to show people\n\n730\n00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,420\nand that way you can send it to them or\nsave it and\n\n731\n00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,740\nthen insert it into a document.\n\n732\n00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,160\nI really like this tool.\n\n733\n00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,530\nYeah, its great for support, for\ndefinitely for purposes like that.\n\n734\n00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,302\nOr if there's an image that\nyou see on a website and\n\n735\n00:36:54,302 --> 00:36:57,611\nyou want to lift it without licensing\n[LAUGH] it works there too.\n\n736\n00:36:57,611 --> 00:36:58,611\nNobody does that.\n\n737\n00:36:58,611 --> 00:37:01,620\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nthat's the snipping tool.\n\n738\n00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:04,650\nIt's another accessory it's just\nkind of built into Windows 7.\n\n739\n00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:07,621\nNow one of the problems that I always\nbump into is remembering where all of\n\n740\n00:37:07,621 --> 00:37:08,410\nthese things are.\n\n741\n00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:11,670\nIn fact, I think this might be the first\ntime that I've ever run the snipping tool\n\n742\n00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,550\nby clicking on its icon.\n\n743\n00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:18,430\nBecause some of our stuff is right here\nunder our Start and All Programs screen.\n\n744\n00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:21,100\nOther things are buried\nunder Accessories and so on.\n\n745\n00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:25,010\nSo remember if you can't\nremember where the stuff is,\n\n746\n00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:27,680\nyou've always got this search box\nat the bottom of your Start menu.\n\n747\n00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,150\nYou can bring up the Start menu.\n\n748\n00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,870\nAnd if you just type snip.\n\n749\n00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,990\nThere it is,\nit finds the snipping tool for you.\n\n750\n00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:35,600\nSo you're going to use that quite a bit.\n\n751\n00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,480\nAnd it's really nice because for\na lot of us\n\n752\n00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,150\nwe don't even remember where the icons are\nanymore because, I know I need WordPad so\n\n753\n00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:45,690\nlet me just type in word, and\nthere it is, the very first program.\n\n754\n00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:47,130\nAnd there's other stuff that shows up too,\n\n755\n00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:49,540\nbut that's what I wanted,\nand I'm in WordPad.\n\n756\n00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,030\nMakes it really quick and easy.\n\n757\n00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,030\nYeah.\n\n758\n00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:55,420\nBut before that particular feature\ncame out, I remember I was so\n\n759\n00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:58,260\ndependent on the mouse,\nnow the only thing I do is I\n\n760\n00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:01,560\nkind of click on the Windows button and\nI bring it up, and I just start typing.\n\n761\n00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:05,930\nIt brings up so\nquickly it makes it nice and easy.\n\n762\n00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,980\nI'm not as dependent on the actual mouse,\n\n763\n00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,480\nhaving to click four locations\nto be able to do that.\n\n764\n00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,230\nThis is by far the fastest way to get\naccess to a lot of programs is using that\n\n765\n00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,500\nsearch programs in files bar.\n\n766\n00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:20,080\nNow probably the most important\napplication package with Windows,\n\n767\n00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,360\nis a web browser.\n\n768\n00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,490\nMore and more people use the Internet for\ntheir basic services.\n\n769\n00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:26,620\nYou might want to write a paper for\nschool.\n\n770\n00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:29,470\nAnd instead of using a word\nprocessor on your own machine,\n\n771\n00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:33,460\nmaybe you use Office 365\non Microsoft's website or\n\n772\n00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:38,160\nGoogle Apps to fire up their spreadsheet\nprogram or document program.\n\n773\n00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,020\nSo there's all sorts of other options\nthat are out there that are web based.\n\n774\n00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,890\nSo using a web browser is pretty critical.\n\n775\n00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:45,730\nWindows includes Internet Explorer.\n\n776\n00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:49,610\nThat's the Microsoft web browser, and\nyou might switch to a different one like\n\n777\n00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:54,580\nGoogle Chrome or Apple Safari or whatever,\nbut Internet Explorer is packaged with\n\n778\n00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:59,200\nevery version of Windows 7 that's\nsold outside of Europe, right?\n\n779\n00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,970\nIn Europe they had some various\nlaws get passed, and so\n\n780\n00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:05,920\nin Europe, you get a version of Windows 7\nthat doesn't include Internet Explorer.\n\n781\n00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,250\nSo it's a little bit different.\n\n782\n00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,640\nBut on most systems, you will have it.\n\n783\n00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,180\nOn the exam, you'll see it.\n\n784\n00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:14,690\nAnd Internet Explorer is, well,\npretty generic, as far as web browsers go.\n\n785\n00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:16,700\nThey all kind of look the same these days.\n\n786\n00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:21,070\nSo if I launch it, it's just\nthe blue E down here in the taskbar.\n\n787\n00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:25,120\nAnd we can start to see, well,\nit went to MSN's pages here first.\n\n788\n00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,410\nSo it might go to something\na little less morbid.\n\n789\n00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:30,190\nLots of negative news today.\n\n790\n00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:32,830\nSo we can browse the ITProTV's website.\n\n791\n00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,770\nEventually.\nOh, shoot.\n\n792\n00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,865\nI forgot about this.\n\n793\n00:39:37,865 --> 00:39:39,048\nWindows 7.\n\n794\n00:39:39,048 --> 00:39:44,110\nWhen you install it, it comes with\nInternet Explorer 8.0, right.\n\n795\n00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:47,972\nNow, Internet Explorer 8,\nat the time was new, exciting,\n\n796\n00:39:47,972 --> 00:39:50,065\nhad all sorts of great features.\n\n797\n00:39:50,065 --> 00:39:51,884\nBut it's pretty old now.\n\n798\n00:39:51,884 --> 00:39:57,092\nInternet Explorer 9 has come out,\n10 has come out, 11 has come out,\n\n799\n00:39:57,092 --> 00:40:01,964\nso this is four versions behind\ncurrent And a lot of modern webpages,\n\n800\n00:40:01,964 --> 00:40:05,996\nlike the ITProTV page,\nuse HTML5 and advanced CSS, and\n\n801\n00:40:05,996 --> 00:40:10,450\nthese are technologies that\nare used on tons of websites.\n\n802\n00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:15,090\nAnd Internet Explorer 8 doesn't support\nany of that It causes problems, and so\n\n803\n00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:19,550\nall of a sudden, the ITProTV page looks\npink and things just aren't loading right,\n\n804\n00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:23,290\nand it looks all strange because\nI'm in this older web browser.\n\n805\n00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:25,390\nI need to do Windows updates.\n\n806\n00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:28,040\nI need to get this updated\nto the current version, and\n\n807\n00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,700\nthen everything will look just fine.\n\n808\n00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,170\nIf I browse around with\nInternet Explorer 8,\n\n809\n00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:35,320\nI will find other sites that\njust don't render right.\n\n810\n00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,490\nWhere things get messed up and\ndon't display.\n\n811\n00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,850\nI bump into them all the time\njust on my own in testing, but\n\n812\n00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:44,770\nit's hard for me to remember one off hand.\n\n813\n00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:47,960\nBut if your browser is running slow,\nif pages aren't loading right,\n\n814\n00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,060\nit usually means that you might be behind.\n\n815\n00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,120\nNow how do you know?\n\n816\n00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,170\nWell in Internet Explorer, you get\nthis little question mark over here.\n\n817\n00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:57,932\nAnd if you click on it, one of the options\nis about Internet Explorer and it will\n\n818\n00:40:57,932 --> 00:41:02,110\ntell you what version you're running and\nI can see I'm running Internet Explorer 8.\n\n819\n00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:03,710\nI definitely need to update.\n\n820\n00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:06,640\nThere's several well known exploits\nout there for Internet Explorer 8.\n\n821\n00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,670\nSo if I stay running it, I run risk\nof having my machine get infected.\n\n822\n00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:13,160\nYeah.\nOne of the things that you do want to make\n\n823\n00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:18,447\nsure that you emphasize is that you want\nto make sure you're running the later or\n\n824\n00:41:18,447 --> 00:41:21,220\nlatest possible version of\nInternet Explorer that you can.\n\n825\n00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,020\nOr even any web browser that you have.\n\n826\n00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,940\nCuz there's always exploits coming out.\n\n827\n00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,300\nYou want latest ones that will help\nsecure you from those exploits.\n\n828\n00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,920\nNow with Internet Explorer\nwhen you fire it up,\n\n829\n00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,485\nyou can start browsing the internet and\nseeing all the great advertisements.\n\n830\n00:41:33,485 --> 00:41:36,800\n[LAUGH] CNN's entire webpage\nis now an advertisement for\n\n831\n00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,780\nNorton Security apparently.\n\n832\n00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:41,680\nAnd I think yeah I'll take a pass\non installing Flash today.\n\n833\n00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,250\nBut you can start browsing the internet,\naccessing systems,\n\n834\n00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:45,740\nso that's all available.\n\n835\n00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:49,060\nYou can use your web based email,\nand so on.\n\n836\n00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:52,440\nThere are some neat features inside\nof Internet Explorer, though.\n\n837\n00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,270\nOne that I like is,\nwhenever you browse the web,\n\n838\n00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:57,090\nyou're basically creating a history,\nright?\n\n839\n00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:59,340\nSo, it's tracking everywhere\nthat you've been to, and\n\n840\n00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:03,160\na lot of the sites you go to\ncreate what are called cookies.\n\n841\n00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:07,680\nAnd cookies are just a little file they\nuse to track you, to remember who you are.\n\n842\n00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,800\nWell, the problem is when you\nstart going to other websites,\n\n843\n00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,490\nthey can inappropriately use those cookies\nto get some of your personal information.\n\n844\n00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:17,100\nAnd we typically don't want that.\n\n845\n00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:21,510\nSo Internet Explorer includes\nsomething called In-Private Browsing.\n\n846\n00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:24,940\nAnd it allows you to launch special\nwindows of Internet Explorer\n\n847\n00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,960\nthat don't allow for tracking objects.\n\n848\n00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,080\nSo if you're gonna be going to a website\nyou've never been to before and\n\n849\n00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:35,690\nyou don't trust it yet, you might go to\nthe in private mode to secure that and\n\n850\n00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:38,670\nensure that your data is kept\nsafe while you're there.\n\n851\n00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:41,160\nBut when you're going to websites\nthat you trust like CNN or\n\n852\n00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,820\nwhatever, you're okay\nwith them tracking you.\n\n853\n00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,475\nA great example of that\nwould be like Amazon.\n\n854\n00:42:45,475 --> 00:42:46,410\nRight?\n\n855\n00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:51,300\nIf I go to Amazon.com and\nI am searching for something, right, so\n\n856\n00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:56,180\nmaybe I'm here and I want to find Xbox,\nwell here before I even search.\n\n857\n00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:00,100\nIf I look at the homepage it's\ntelling me about their FireHD tablet.\n\n858\n00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:03,900\nIt's telling me about some routers\nI might be interested in and\n\n859\n00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,660\nsome other devices, right?\n\n860\n00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:08,590\nTents, camping material, so\njust really generic stuff.\n\n861\n00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:11,690\nThey don't know know anything\nabout me yet, right?\n\n862\n00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:15,590\nBut if I start searching for\nThe X-Files on DVD, right?\n\n863\n00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:18,690\nSo not I'm saying, hey I want to\nsee something about the X-FIles.\n\n864\n00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:20,645\nMaybe I want to buy the whole collection.\n\n865\n00:43:20,645 --> 00:43:23,160\nI'm just gonna go crazy and\nwatch all of them.\n\n866\n00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,507\nWell it even includes the movies.\n\n867\n00:43:24,507 --> 00:43:26,500\nWe could go super hardcore.\n\n868\n00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,680\nSo I start looking at that and I say oh\nwow they've got some suggestions here.\n\n869\n00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,980\nMore X-Files related stuff.\n\n870\n00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:37,670\nSo I'm shopping and when I close that\nbrowser, so I;m out of there and\n\n871\n00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:41,620\nI fire it back up again and I decide,\nlater on I'm gonna go back to Amazon.\n\n872\n00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,492\nNow, I never logged in.\n\n873\n00:43:43,492 --> 00:43:46,330\nI never put in a username or\npassword or anything like that, but\n\n874\n00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:50,420\nwhen I go back to the website,\nit's going to remember that that was me.\n\n875\n00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:54,900\nThat I had a cookie, that I access\nthe site, and look at what it did.\n\n876\n00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,080\nHere's items that you viewed, right?\n\n877\n00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:01,110\nYou might be interested in an X-Files\nmovie two pack or whatever, and so\n\n878\n00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:05,930\nit starts giving me suggestions\ntailored on what I searched for.\n\n879\n00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:08,100\nAnd that's not a bad thing.\n\n880\n00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:11,390\nNow you're getting a market that more\nclosely reflects the stuff that you want.\n\n881\n00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:15,400\nSo, for things like that,\nwe want it to trust,\n\n882\n00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:20,290\nwe want to trust them, let them recognize\nus and tailor the advertisements to us.\n\n883\n00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:24,600\nBut if you don't trust the site, well,\nthen you can go up to your Safety menu\n\n884\n00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:28,090\nhere, and under Safety you'll\nsee In-Private Browsing.\n\n885\n00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:33,670\nAnd when we click In-Private Browsing,\nthat will take us to a private window.\n\n886\n00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:37,350\nAnd now if I go to Amazon.com.\n\n887\n00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:40,130\nAnd I see my little note right there\nletting me know that I'm in private.\n\n888\n00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:44,440\nAnd when I go to amazon.com,\nI'll get there.\n\n889\n00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:49,340\nHere's the page and notice there's\nnone of that X-Files stuff, right?\n\n890\n00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:50,470\nWhere did it all go?\n\n891\n00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:51,930\nIt doesn't know who I am.\n\n892\n00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:53,300\nThe cookies are all hidden.\n\n893\n00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,830\nAll that data is safely tucked away.\n\n894\n00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:57,530\nThat's a pretty neat feature.\n\n895\n00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:00,750\nIf you're going to a site and you don't\nwant that site to know your personal\n\n896\n00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:03,320\ninformation, then this is what you use.\n\n897\n00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:08,760\nNot only do we have that neat feature to\nbe able to do the In-Private browsing, but\n\n898\n00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,590\nmost of us go to multiple\nwebsites during the day.\n\n899\n00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:14,820\nAnd it's probably a regular pattern for\nus to be able to do so.\n\n900\n00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,700\nWhat we also have the ability\nto do is keep favorites.\n\n901\n00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:20,650\nNow Don,\nI think you're the only person that\n\n902\n00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:23,165\nopens like 46 different\nbrowser tabs at one time.\n\n903\n00:45:23,165 --> 00:45:24,410\nYeah.\nAnd I know you don't know every\n\n904\n00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:25,570\nsingle URL.\n\n905\n00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:26,590\nRight.\n\n906\n00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:28,495\nI use a lot of favorites.\n\n907\n00:45:28,495 --> 00:45:30,982\nYou'll hear people call these bookmarks,\nalso.\n\n908\n00:45:30,982 --> 00:45:33,050\nPretty much every other\nbrowser calls them a bookmark.\n\n909\n00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:34,920\nMicrosoft calls them a favorite.\n\n910\n00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,610\nIf you have web pages you go to a lot or\neven if you don't go to them a lot,\n\n911\n00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:41,210\nyou just want to remember the page,\nyou can create a favorite for it.\n\n912\n00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:44,060\nSo if I know I'm gonna go to\nAmazon.com a lot like here.\n\n913\n00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:45,450\nLet's pull this back up.\n\n914\n00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:50,995\nSo if I'm gonna be going to Amazon.com\na lot, I can bookmark it, I can save it.\n\n915\n00:45:50,995 --> 00:45:54,220\nRight?\nAnd so I can basically click on favorites\n\n916\n00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:58,320\nand add to favorites, and\nnow it's gonna add it to the list.\n\n917\n00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,690\nAnd it gives me a chance to rename it,\n\n918\n00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:02,120\nbecause the name it picks\nis usually not very good.\n\n919\n00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,230\nSo I'll pick one.\n\n920\n00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:05,020\nThat's not Internet Explorer's fault.\n\n921\n00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:07,120\nWhoever made the website,\nthey picked the name,\n\n922\n00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:11,030\nand a lot of times they do what Amazon\ndid and just put a ton of stuff in there.\n\n923\n00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:14,039\nSo I'm just going to rename it Amazon.com.\n\n924\n00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:14,780\nAll right.\n\n925\n00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:19,285\nAnd maybe I go to SlashDot a lot, so\nI might wanna go and add a bookmark for\n\n926\n00:46:19,285 --> 00:46:19,970\nthat one.\n\n927\n00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:24,618\nSo I can just browse to it and then I'll\ngo to favorites and add the favorites.\n\n928\n00:46:24,618 --> 00:46:25,715\nNow I've got a bookmark for that one.\n\n929\n00:46:25,715 --> 00:46:27,128\nAll right.\n\n930\n00:46:27,128 --> 00:46:29,275\nName that in a little bit.\n\n931\n00:46:29,275 --> 00:46:30,770\nThere.\n\n932\n00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:37,270\nSo now in the future when I come into the\noffice and I fire up Internet Explorer and\n\n933\n00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:40,900\nI'm ready to get to work, instead of\nhaving to type those addresses in,\n\n934\n00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:45,990\nI can just go up here to favorites and\nthere's Amazon and there's Slashdot.\n\n935\n00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:50,260\nAnd I can just click on it, and it'll\ntake me straight to that page, right.\n\n936\n00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:54,770\nNow if I go to that page a lot,\nif I always go to Slashdot,\n\n937\n00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:57,270\nif that's the webpage that I go to\nthe first time I launch my web browser\n\n938\n00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:00,690\nevery day,\nI might want to set that as my homepage.\n\n939\n00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:03,380\nYour homepage is the page that's\ndisplayed when you launch it.\n\n940\n00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:07,500\nYou probably noticed that mine keeps\ngoing to MSN, that's the default.\n\n941\n00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:11,833\nAnd I don't like the MSN page, cuz it's\nall, well, like here, it's all negative.\n\n942\n00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:14,921\nLook, we got two people dead,\none person who is a killer.\n\n943\n00:47:14,921 --> 00:47:17,435\n[LAUGH] So that's not what I\nwant to see when I launch this.\n\n944\n00:47:17,435 --> 00:47:21,922\nSo what you can do is you can go\nto Tools and Internet Options and\n\n945\n00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:25,821\nright in there you can define\nwhere your homepage is.\n\n946\n00:47:25,821 --> 00:47:30,080\nAnd I'm gonna get rid of MSN and we're\ngonna replace that with something else.\n\n947\n00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,971\nI'm going to replace it with,\nwe'll do Slashdot or, actually,\n\n948\n00:47:33,971 --> 00:47:37,670\nlet's go a little more accurate,\ngoogle.com, right?\n\n949\n00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:41,740\nI will usually fire it up and go straight\ninto Google, or you might choose Bing or\n\n950\n00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,610\nwhatever, we can put that there.\n\n951\n00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:47,235\nIn fact, if you have more than one\npage you visit all of the time,\n\n952\n00:47:47,235 --> 00:47:49,260\nyou can add more than one homepage.\n\n953\n00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:52,254\nSo, maybe I'll add Bing as my second page.\n\n954\n00:47:52,254 --> 00:47:53,866\nRight?\nSo I've got Google and\n\n955\n00:47:53,866 --> 00:47:55,678\nBing, and I'll hit Okay to that.\n\n956\n00:47:55,678 --> 00:48:01,123\nNow When I close my browser and\nopen it again, instead of going to MSN,\n\n957\n00:48:01,123 --> 00:48:06,200\nthat I don't care about,\nit's gonna go to Google and Bing.\n\n958\n00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:06,820\nRight there.\n\n959\n00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:08,340\nSo it opened those two tabs for me.\n\n960\n00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:11,400\nAnd I can close them if I want,\nbut I'm now on these two.\n\n961\n00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,810\nAnd I might leave those there, so\nI can do my searches throughout the day.\n\n962\n00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:18,220\nAnd I can open up more tabs\nto browse to other sites.\n\n963\n00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:19,580\nAnd so here I can fire up Amazon.\n\n964\n00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,660\nAnd then over here I can fire up Slashdot.\n\n965\n00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,904\nAnd now I'm browsing through four\ndifferent web pages at the same\n\n966\n00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:28,737\ntime, right.\n\n967\n00:48:28,737 --> 00:48:32,821\nSo I can get at it,\nsee what I wanna see and that's that.\n\n968\n00:48:32,821 --> 00:48:33,322\nAll right.\n\n969\n00:48:33,322 --> 00:48:34,790\nBing is warning me here.\n\n970\n00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:36,510\nMy Internet Explorer is out of date.\n\n971\n00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:38,120\nDownload the latest version now.\n\n972\n00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:41,050\nYou'll see that if you stay on the\nInternet Explorer 8, websites will warn\n\n973\n00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:44,760\nyou because it's actually hard for them\nto support Internet Explorer 8 now, too.\n\n974\n00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:45,910\nThey want you to move beyond that.\n\n975\n00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:50,670\nNow, Don, I'm noticing this\nblue bar across the top, there.\n\n976\n00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:54,936\nThat's saying, right now,\nmy current search is Bing.\n\n977\n00:48:54,936 --> 00:48:56,047\nIs there a way I can change that?\n\n978\n00:48:56,047 --> 00:48:56,863\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n979\n00:48:56,863 --> 00:49:01,240\nSo, I have a search page pulled up here,\nGoogle.\n\n980\n00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:05,320\nBut normally I don't even use that\nbecause most web browsers these days have\n\n981\n00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,520\nwhere you can search right\nfrom the address bar up here.\n\n982\n00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:13,494\nSo for example on Google if I\nwere to do a search for fishing.\n\n983\n00:49:13,494 --> 00:49:15,520\nRight, so I wanna learn about fishing.\n\n984\n00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,670\nSo I can do a Google search and\nthere it is.\n\n985\n00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:20,790\nBut I could have just typed\nright here in the address bar,\n\n986\n00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:25,110\nfishing and well, see how I tried\nto turn that into a website?\n\n987\n00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:26,880\nAnd that didn't quite work.\n\n988\n00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,090\nBut over here, I can type fishing and\n\n989\n00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:33,740\nthat's my search bar,\nas we know auto complete shows up.\n\n990\n00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:35,680\nAnd now it's doing a search for fishing.\n\n991\n00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,250\nBut see how I used Bing?\n\n992\n00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:41,110\nInternet Explorer defaults to Bing,\nthat's Microsoft's search engine.\n\n993\n00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:44,330\nBut you can change that, and that's\nexactly what Google is offering to do for\n\n994\n00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:48,770\nme, is back here,\nwhen Google displayed that blue bar,\n\n995\n00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:52,170\nit was saying do you wanna update\nyour default search engine?\n\n996\n00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:53,970\nAnd I could just say,\nsure, and let it do it.\n\n997\n00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:55,700\nBut we can actually do that from up here,\ntoo.\n\n998\n00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,770\nIf you hit the down arrow\non your search box,\n\n999\n00:49:57,770 --> 00:50:00,230\nyou'll see where you can\nfind more providers.\n\n1000\n00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:03,540\nThat's where we can customize who\nwe're doing our searches through.\n\n1001\n00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:07,070\nAnd when I hit that it'll take\nme to a page that lets me pick\n\n1002\n00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:09,820\nfrom various providers that\nMicrosoft has approved, and\n\n1003\n00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:14,210\nyou'll see Yahoo, Google Search,\nand other ones that are out there.\n\n1004\n00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:16,890\nSome of these you may have never\nheard of they're just not as popular,\n\n1005\n00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:19,350\nother ones are fairly big, so\nyou find the one you want.\n\n1006\n00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:20,743\nI'll pick Google.\n\n1007\n00:50:20,743 --> 00:50:24,080\nAll right, so there it is, and\nI'll just add that to Internet Explorer.\n\n1008\n00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,070\nAnd when I add it I'm gonna\nchoose to make it my default.\n\n1009\n00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:28,470\nAnd watch up here.\n\n1010\n00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:30,580\nSee how I've got that Bing emblem?\n\n1011\n00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:34,040\nWhen I add this, see how it just changed?\n\n1012\n00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,050\nAnd now when I go up here and do a search,\n\n1013\n00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:40,355\nI can type in fishing, and\nnow it's gonna search using Google.\n\n1014\n00:50:40,355 --> 00:50:43,775\nBut when I typed it,\nI could still click on Bing, and\n\n1015\n00:50:43,775 --> 00:50:45,725\nnow it'll do the search with Bing.\n\n1016\n00:50:45,725 --> 00:50:48,905\nSo you can flip from your default\nto another provider if you want,\n\n1017\n00:50:48,905 --> 00:50:50,005\nit's pretty straightforward.\n\n1018\n00:50:51,795 --> 00:50:54,715\nAll right, so that's some of\nthe basics of Internet Explorer,\n\n1019\n00:50:54,715 --> 00:50:55,985\nit's a perfectly good browser.\n\n1020\n00:50:55,985 --> 00:50:57,215\nYou do need to keep it up-to-date.\n\n1021\n00:50:57,215 --> 00:50:58,645\nIt's very powerful.\n\n1022\n00:50:58,645 --> 00:51:03,140\nMany people do choose to use\nGoogle Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.\n\n1023\n00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:06,230\nThose are probably the next two\nbiggest browsers that are out there.\n\n1024\n00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:08,190\nIt's up to you, which one you prefer.\n\n1025\n00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:11,210\nPersonally I use Google Chrome\nalmost exclusively.\n\n1026\n00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:12,220\nWhat are you on right now?\n\n1027\n00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:12,870\nGoogle Chrome.\n\n1028\n00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:13,740\nSame?\n\n1029\n00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:16,046\nYeah, okay.\nYou see variations, but\n\n1030\n00:51:16,046 --> 00:51:18,621\nChrome is pretty popular today.\n\n1031\n00:51:18,621 --> 00:51:22,330\nAll right, so that's basically it for\nInternet Explorer.\n\n1032\n00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:24,850\nWhat else do we have on our\nlittle laundry list here?\n\n1033\n00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:28,080\nWe've gotta take a look at\nmultimedia today because it's so\n\n1034\n00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,930\nbig in the world of computing,\n\n1035\n00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:35,700\nwhere we can play music as well as take\na look at videos directly on our computer.\n\n1036\n00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:38,180\nAnd sometimes when you don't do this,\n\n1037\n00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:40,540\nyou might think that's because\nthe third party admin.\n\n1038\n00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:42,510\nBut Windows actually has it built in for\nus.\n\n1039\n00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:44,390\nThey've got two utilities.\n\n1040\n00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:50,080\nAnd so on every version of Windows 7,\nyou'll have the Windows media player.\n\n1041\n00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:53,250\nIt's a simple software package that\nwill play pretty much any video or\n\n1042\n00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:54,980\nmusic file that you have.\n\n1043\n00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,530\nAnd it's right there on my task bar.\n\n1044\n00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:59,000\nLet me close all the stuff\nI have open here.\n\n1045\n00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,360\nWe can see it down on\nmy task bar right here.\n\n1046\n00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:05,820\nThat's the Windows Media Player, little\norange circle on a blue box with an arrow,\n\n1047\n00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:11,870\nand if I fire that up, it lets me see\nmy music, my videos, my pictures, my\n\n1048\n00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:15,150\nrecorded TV, whatever it is that I have on\nthis system, and I can start to play it.\n\n1049\n00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:17,930\nSo there's that video that I\nplayed earlier in the show.\n\n1050\n00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:19,220\nAnd if I click on that,\n\n1051\n00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:24,020\nthis is now playing inside of\nWindows Media Player, all right?\n\n1052\n00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:27,990\nI didn't go out and get some video player,\nthis one's just built in, and\n\n1053\n00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:32,980\nthere it is, and it's got the full pause,\nfast forward, rewind buttons and\n\n1054\n00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:37,180\nall of the stuff that you'd expect to\nfind inside of a viewer like this.\n\n1055\n00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:41,780\nI like how you can take it and make it\nreally small, so we can kind of stick\n\n1056\n00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:45,850\nit up in the corner like this and\nyou can tell it to stay on top.\n\n1057\n00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:51,190\nSomewhere in here is an option\nthat will say- You just saw it.\n\n1058\n00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:52,053\nOh, did I skip over it?\n\n1059\n00:52:52,053 --> 00:52:52,800\nThird one from the bottom.\n\n1060\n00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,440\nAlways show now playing on top.\n\n1061\n00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,580\nOh, okay.\n\n1062\n00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:58,290\nThere we go.\n\n1063\n00:52:58,290 --> 00:53:02,300\nSo now that that's, what I can do is I\ncan start to fire up other programs, and\n\n1064\n00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:03,920\nsee how this one stayed on top?\n\n1065\n00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,545\nSo I can be watching that video while\nI work, or pretend to work, right?\n\n1066\n00:53:07,545 --> 00:53:10,960\n[LAUGH] So I can start to go to various\nsites, like CNN or whatever, and\n\n1067\n00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,372\nI can do browsing while\nthat video's playing.\n\n1068\n00:53:12,372 --> 00:53:14,560\nSo kinda neat,\njust lets you play your content.\n\n1069\n00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:17,295\nYou can play music and\njust let it run in the background.\n\n1070\n00:53:17,295 --> 00:53:21,130\nAnd you can always minimize it and get it\nout of the way, and whatever you need.\n\n1071\n00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:22,710\nSo it's a good little system there.\n\n1072\n00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:25,780\nAll right, that one's packaged in\nevery version of Windows, right.\n\n1073\n00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:31,045\nNot in every version of Windows\nis a special media player\n\n1074\n00:53:31,045 --> 00:53:33,650\nthat called the Windows Media Center.\n\n1075\n00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:37,020\nAnd Windows Media Center is\ndifferent than Windows Media Player.\n\n1076\n00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:41,730\nWindows Media Center\ndoes play your videos and\n\n1077\n00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:44,490\nyour music,\njust like Windows Media Player does.\n\n1078\n00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:48,620\nBut where Media Center differs, is\nWindows Media Center is designed to be run\n\n1079\n00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:53,090\nfull screen, and\ncontrolled with a TV remote control.\n\n1080\n00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:56,830\nThis is designed for when you hook\nyour computer up to a television.\n\n1081\n00:53:56,830 --> 00:54:00,240\nAnd use it as a media PC.\n\n1082\n00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,750\nAnd you can have your entire video\nlibrary, your music, and so on, and\n\n1083\n00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:04,710\nyou can control it with\na standard television,\n\n1084\n00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:08,020\nwell, it's not standard,\nit's a specific controller that they sell.\n\n1085\n00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:10,475\nAnd you can use the controller and\nwatch TV.\n\n1086\n00:54:10,475 --> 00:54:15,005\nIf you have a TV tuning adapter, where you\ncan plug in your cable television into\n\n1087\n00:54:15,005 --> 00:54:19,365\nthe back of your computer, it can\nactually watch live TV, and record TV.\n\n1088\n00:54:19,365 --> 00:54:21,135\nAnd that's pretty cool.\n\n1089\n00:54:21,135 --> 00:54:22,345\nI use that myself at home.\n\n1090\n00:54:22,345 --> 00:54:25,590\nI have a Windows Media Center, and\nthat's how I record television and\n\n1091\n00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:27,400\nwatch it back and so on.\n\n1092\n00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,700\nSo Windows Media Center is pretty cool.\n\n1093\n00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:33,430\nIt's not included in every single\nversion of Windows though.\n\n1094\n00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:36,270\nIt's in Windows 7 Home Premium and\n\n1095\n00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:39,390\nWindows 7 Enterprise apparently,\nthose are the two that had it.\n\n1096\n00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:41,140\nSo you've got to have a special version.\n\n1097\n00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:48,070\nIf you have Windows 7 Home regular or\nWindows 7 professional?\n\n1098\n00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:49,830\nThere's a Windows 7 professionals.\n\n1099\n00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:52,200\nSo those two don't have\nWindows Media Center.\n\n1100\n00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,470\nSo they don't all do,\nyou'll see it though under my Start menu.\n\n1101\n00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:59,900\nIf we bring that up and go into All\nPrograms, and you'll see where I've got\n\n1102\n00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:03,510\nWindows Media Player right there and\nright above it Windows Media Center.\n\n1103\n00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:07,360\nIt's got a green icon instead\nof the orange and blue one.\n\n1104\n00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:11,140\nAnd when I launch it,\nit's got a pretty fancy interface.\n\n1105\n00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:14,890\nIt'll probably run a little choppy here\nbecause of the way I'm sharing my desktop,\n\n1106\n00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:17,900\nbut this is it.\n\n1107\n00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:20,830\nWell whatever.\n\n1108\n00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:23,762\nIt's asking if I want set something up,\nI'll just yes to it.\n\n1109\n00:55:23,762 --> 00:55:25,258\nBut and here is, and\n\n1110\n00:55:25,258 --> 00:55:30,880\nif I had a remote control that I could\npoint at this thing and control it.\n\n1111\n00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,490\nI'd see this interface and\nit's designed to be able\n\n1112\n00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:36,750\nto be very easy to scroll through,\nyou throw this up on a flat screen TV or\n\n1113\n00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:40,400\nwhatever up on your wall and\nyou can go through and pick things.\n\n1114\n00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,681\nNow, if I had a TV tuner I'd be able to\ncome in here and watch my recorded TV.\n\n1115\n00:55:44,681 --> 00:55:47,459\nAnd once I set up the tuner it\nwould actually have a TV guide,\n\n1116\n00:55:47,459 --> 00:55:50,461\nI could click on, and I would see\nall the upcoming television and\n\n1117\n00:55:50,461 --> 00:55:52,254\nschedule recordings and all of that.\n\n1118\n00:55:52,254 --> 00:55:56,721\nAs it stands, I at least have that one\nvideo, so I can go into my video library,\n\n1119\n00:55:56,721 --> 00:56:01,328\nand I'll see the same videos that we saw\nover in Windows Media Player earlier, so\n\n1120\n00:56:01,328 --> 00:56:04,250\nthere's the trailer I've been showing.\n\n1121\n00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:08,230\nAnd when I fire it up, it will be\nnice full screen, edge to edge video,\n\n1122\n00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:11,650\nthere it goes, and now it's starting\nto play that content back and\n\n1123\n00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:15,240\nwe'll see what's all\ncoming up in this movie.\n\n1124\n00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,310\nSo, really neat stuff there.\n\n1125\n00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:22,770\nAnd I know it looks a little choppy with\nthe way that I'm sharing my desktop.\n\n1126\n00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:26,590\nBut in real life it is super smooth and\ndoes HD quality video.\n\n1127\n00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:27,910\nIt's a good product.\n\n1128\n00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:29,510\nIt's really neat.\n\n1129\n00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:32,030\nBut it is designed for\nuse when you're attached to a television.\n\n1130\n00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:38,880\nAll right, so that's Windows Media Player\nand Windows Media Center.\n\n1131\n00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,630\nYeah.\nRemember that these are utilities\n\n1132\n00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:45,330\nthat are all a part of\nthe Microsoft Windows 7 operating system,\n\n1133\n00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:47,510\nwithout having to purchase any additional.\n\n1134\n00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:48,770\nNow, the only other version, I think,\n\n1135\n00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:52,690\nthat we didn't mention is that there\nis also in Windows 7 Ultimate.\n\n1136\n00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:53,360\nOh that's right.\n\n1137\n00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:56,985\nI forgot, the addition that nobody\nshould buy because it's way over priced.\n\n1138\n00:56:56,985 --> 00:57:01,850\n[LAUGH] So, it's pretty cool,\nit's a need to have especially,\n\n1139\n00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:04,430\nif you have a TV tuner,\nthat's where it gets really powerful.\n\n1140\n00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:08,070\nAll right, the very last accessory that\nwe have to talk about actually isn't\n\n1141\n00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:10,240\nan accessory, it's a system tool.\n\n1142\n00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,150\nThere are times when you have\nproblems with your system and\n\n1143\n00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:15,000\nyou may need to do some troubleshooting.\n\n1144\n00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,360\nWhen you boot your computer up,\n\n1145\n00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:19,030\nthere's a lot of software that\nmay be starting automatically.\n\n1146\n00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:22,820\nAnd in Windows we have an easy way to\nsee what's starting up when our computer\n\n1147\n00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:24,610\nstarts up and to tweak it.\n\n1148\n00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:26,760\nTo turn things on and off if we want.\n\n1149\n00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:29,050\nIt's called\nthe System Configuration Utility, and\n\n1150\n00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:31,290\nit's buried away under\nour Administrative Tools.\n\n1151\n00:57:31,290 --> 00:57:33,530\nLet me show you guys how to get to it.\n\n1152\n00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:36,110\nWe're gonna go back into our control\npanel from the beginning of the show.\n\n1153\n00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:42,100\nAnd in here, I'm gonna go to System and\nSecurity, and\n\n1154\n00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:44,640\nfrom there I'm gonna go down\nto Administrative Tools.\n\n1155\n00:57:46,155 --> 00:57:48,615\nInside of there we'll find\nsystem configuration.\n\n1156\n00:57:49,755 --> 00:57:51,635\nNow for those of you that have\nbeen using Windows for a while,\n\n1157\n00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:53,905\nyou might know this by its\nother name which is msconfig.\n\n1158\n00:57:53,905 --> 00:57:57,435\nAnd that's a command line name\nthat you can run that will\n\n1159\n00:57:57,435 --> 00:57:58,945\ncall up this same program.\n\n1160\n00:57:58,945 --> 00:57:59,985\nBut this is the icon for it.\n\n1161\n00:57:59,985 --> 00:58:01,375\nSystem configuration.\n\n1162\n00:58:01,375 --> 00:58:02,995\nAnd we can fire that up, and\n\n1163\n00:58:02,995 --> 00:58:05,965\nit shows us how our computer\nis going to start next time.\n\n1164\n00:58:05,965 --> 00:58:09,490\nIs it going to start normally,\nis it going to do a diagnostic start up?\n\n1165\n00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:15,000\nOr a selective startup, where I only\nrun some programs and not others.\n\n1166\n00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,510\nIf I want to know what programs,\nI can go to the start up tab and\n\n1167\n00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:20,010\nI'll see the programs that start up.\n\n1168\n00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:24,140\nNow, I don't have much on this machine\nbecause it's pretty much a brand new\n\n1169\n00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:28,710\nmachine, but as you install more and more\nsoftware you'll see things appear here.\n\n1170\n00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:29,470\nEven simple things,\n\n1171\n00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:33,400\nlike if you install Adobe Acrobat Reader,\njust their little PDF reader.\n\n1172\n00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,250\nThey have a little program that starts\nwhen you boot that keeps that software up\n\n1173\n00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:39,950\nto date and\ngets it ready to run at a moment's notice.\n\n1174\n00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:41,330\nYou may or may not want that.\n\n1175\n00:58:41,330 --> 00:58:46,330\nAnd you can uncheck things here, and\nnow they won't start when you boot up.\n\n1176\n00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:49,230\nSo the next time I boot,\nthese two utilities will not run.\n\n1177\n00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:51,520\nI can use that for troubleshooting,\nthen I can come back and\n\n1178\n00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:56,020\njust turn those back on and\nreboot again, and now they will start.\n\n1179\n00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:59,250\nSo neat little utility that helps us for\ntroubleshooting purposes as far as\n\n1180\n00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:01,210\nwhat's going to start,\nwhen our computer starts up.\n\n1181\n00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:05,480\nIt's real nice to see that\nthe operating system, itself,\n\n1182\n00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:11,030\nreally has a lot of the basic\ntools we need to keep a user being\n\n1183\n00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:15,930\nable to use the operating system, without\nhaving to buy a lot of additional tools.\n\n1184\n00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:19,850\nEven so, remember that most of them have\njust a really basic functionality, but\n\n1185\n00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:21,520\nallows you to get by.\n\n1186\n00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:25,570\nAnd we should know where these utilities\nare, and how they at least work.\n\n1187\n00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:31,330\nAll right, well, I know we've overshot\nour break on this particular segment.\n\n1188\n00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:33,100\nSo let's stop here and take a pause.\n\n1189\n00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:36,080\nWhen we get back, we're gonna talk\nabout some of the software built in for\n\n1190\n00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:38,370\nlaptop devices and mobility.\n\n1191\n00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:41,762\nAnd we're gonna take a look at the last\nsection which is a little remote\n\n1192\n00:59:41,762 --> 00:59:43,209\nmanagement and assistance.\n\n1193\n00:59:43,209 --> 00:59:45,323\nSo additional tools that\nare built into the OS.\n\n1194\n00:59:45,323 --> 00:59:47,181\nStay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n1195\n00:59:47,181 --> 00:59:50,886\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n1196\n00:59:50,886 --> 00:59:56,322\nwelcome back everybody.\n\n1197\n00:59:56,322 --> 01:00:00,451\nIn this segment what we want to do is\ntake a look at how our operating system\n\n1198\n01:00:00,451 --> 01:00:02,360\nwould behave on a mobile device.\n\n1199\n01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:06,200\nOperating systems like Windows\nwere originally developed for\n\n1200\n01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:10,080\ndesktop computers, computers that\nwere plugged into a wall socket and\n\n1201\n01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:13,660\nstayed there for their whole lives,\nright, had all the power they wanted.\n\n1202\n01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:18,060\nBut on a mobile device like a laptop,\nwe have different needs, right?\n\n1203\n01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:21,210\nWe have a battery that we're operating\non and we usually want to stretch that\n\n1204\n01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:24,760\nbattery power as long as we can\nbecause when the battery runs out,\n\n1205\n01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:28,180\nif we're not near a wall socket, we're not\ngonna be able to use our laptop anymore.\n\n1206\n01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:33,420\nSo on a Windows machine\nthat's on a battery,\n\n1207\n01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:36,640\nthings look just a little bit different.\n\n1208\n01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,340\nLet's take a look at that.\n\n1209\n01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:42,210\nThe main thing that we're gonna notice\nis that when we go into Windows,\n\n1210\n01:00:42,210 --> 01:00:47,100\nthere's a little extra icon in our system\ntray and, actually can we make this\n\n1211\n01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:49,880\ncomputer full screen for a second\nbecause my head is gonna cover it up.\n\n1212\n01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,110\nThere we go.\n\n1213\n01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:53,990\nYou've got this little\npower icon down here and\n\n1214\n01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:57,010\nit's basically a battery with\na wall plug on it, and if\n\n1215\n01:00:57,010 --> 01:00:59,740\nyou float your mouse over it it will tell\nyou how much battery life you have left.\n\n1216\n01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:01,470\nSo I can see I'm fully charged and\n\n1217\n01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:06,110\nI've got 100% of my battery left so,\nthings are looking pretty good there.\n\n1218\n01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:08,370\nIf it was lower, I would know that,\nand it would reflect it.\n\n1219\n01:01:08,370 --> 01:01:12,080\nAnd if my battery was really low,\nit would warn me, right?\n\n1220\n01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:15,040\nNow, how do I get the most\nout of my battery?\n\n1221\n01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,230\nWell, we have our power\noptions inside of Windows.\n\n1222\n01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:22,400\nAnd if we go into our control panel,\nwe'll be able to see that.\n\n1223\n01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:25,500\nInside of our control panel, you'll see\na bunch of stuff that's in here, and\n\n1224\n01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,120\nthe power options are actually buried.\n\n1225\n01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,450\nLet's see.\nIs that- Hardware and sound.\n\n1226\n01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:29,690\nHardware and sound.\n\n1227\n01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,130\nThere we go.\n\n1228\n01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:33,530\nAnd here's our power options.\n\n1229\n01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:35,980\nAnd we'll see various things\nlike our battery settings and\n\n1230\n01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:37,800\nwhat our power buttons do and so on.\n\n1231\n01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:40,450\nI'm just going to click on power options.\n\n1232\n01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:44,380\nAnd it's going to show us\nwhat plan we're on right now.\n\n1233\n01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:47,410\nMicrosoft has predefined three\ndifferent power plans for\n\n1234\n01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:51,410\nus to choose between to\ndictate how our computer runs.\n\n1235\n01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:53,850\nA normal desktop is going to\nrun in high performance mode,\n\n1236\n01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:58,590\nthat means it will use as much power as it\nneeds, it's not worried about a battery.\n\n1237\n01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:02,280\nBut on a machine like mine, where I'm on\na battery, I do worry about that, and so\n\n1238\n01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,780\nI might want to choose to balanced,\n\n1239\n01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:09,800\nwhich is, a healthy balance between\npower saving and performance, or\n\n1240\n01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:14,040\nif I'm going to be on a long flight\nI might want to go power saver.\n\n1241\n01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:19,400\nBe as stingy as possible with that battery\nto make it last as long as possible.\n\n1242\n01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:26,620\nEach one of these different power savings\nplans that we have, they all adjust\n\n1243\n01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:32,980\nthe different devices on our computer or\non our laptop that eat up the most power.\n\n1244\n01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:34,960\nSo we can think about\nthings like the display.\n\n1245\n01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:39,160\nIt can say power down display after\na few minutes or after a few hours.\n\n1246\n01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:40,220\nSame thing with a hard drive.\n\n1247\n01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:44,910\nTelling it to slow down or power down\nthe hard drive after so much usage or\n\n1248\n01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:47,020\nwhen it's idle, it can go ahead and do it.\n\n1249\n01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:48,270\nSo depending on what you pick,\n\n1250\n01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:51,690\nusually these three meet\nthe majority of our options.\n\n1251\n01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:53,730\nBut, if you want to\ncustomize it even more,\n\n1252\n01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:56,400\nyou have the ability to create your own,\nif you choose to.\n\n1253\n01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,340\nBut, these three normally\nmeet most of our power needs.\n\n1254\n01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:02,940\nAnd the other neat thing is, sometimes\nyour laptop is plugged into a wall socket\n\n1255\n01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:04,790\nand you don't need to be that stingy, so,\n\n1256\n01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:08,610\nyou'll see things like over here where\nit says change when the computer sleeps.\n\n1257\n01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:10,970\nIf you click on that,\nit gives you choices for\n\n1258\n01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:15,210\nwhen it puts the computer to sleep\non battery versus plugged in.\n\n1259\n01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:18,200\nIf, you're plugged into the wall,\nyou don't need the computer to sleep,\n\n1260\n01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,920\nit can just run and run and\nrun and eat all the power at once.\n\n1261\n01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:24,040\nBut, if you're on battery, and you're\nnot going to be using the computer for\n\n1262\n01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:26,730\na little while,\nmaybe after fifteen minutes.\n\n1263\n01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:29,820\nIf I don't touch the computer for\nfifteen minutes, put it to sleep.\n\n1264\n01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:34,370\nAnd that means it powers as much down as\nit can without losing your documents.\n\n1265\n01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:38,570\nSo it does stay on, it's just\nconsuming as little power as possible.\n\n1266\n01:03:38,570 --> 01:03:41,280\nSo you can adjust these settings,\nput them however you need,\n\n1267\n01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,740\nand then you'll be ready to rock.\n\n1268\n01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:47,707\nNow, I had mine set to never, and the\nreason I do is because I'm on the show.\n\n1269\n01:03:47,707 --> 01:03:50,872\nI don't want my computer to go to sleep\nduring the show so I leave it that way so\n\n1270\n01:03:50,872 --> 01:03:52,257\nwe don't have to worry about it,\n\n1271\n01:03:52,257 --> 01:03:54,849\nbut this is all a customizable\nyou can change these settings.\n\n1272\n01:03:54,849 --> 01:03:56,289\nTo however you want.\n\n1273\n01:03:56,289 --> 01:03:58,994\nAll right, so\npower management's a big deal.\n\n1274\n01:03:58,994 --> 01:04:03,516\nThere is one other thing that's\nreally useful on mobile devices, and\n\n1275\n01:04:03,516 --> 01:04:06,460\nthat is the Windows Mobility Center.\n\n1276\n01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:10,355\nNow, to get to the mobility center\non a desktop, it doesn't work.\n\n1277\n01:04:10,355 --> 01:04:13,020\nWell it sort of works, but\nit's missing some pieces.\n\n1278\n01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:14,900\nBut, on a device with a battery,\n\n1279\n01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:18,730\nthe mobility center contains some neat\nstuff that really pertains to laptops.\n\n1280\n01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:24,050\nYou can hit the windows key X short cut\nkey on your keyboard to bring it up or,\n\n1281\n01:04:24,050 --> 01:04:26,400\nyou can just type mobility in your\nsearch box and it'll turn up,\n\n1282\n01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,400\nthere's Windows Mobility Center.\n\n1283\n01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:31,640\nAnd we can bring that up and it will show\nme things like my battery performance.\n\n1284\n01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:32,360\nRight?\n\n1285\n01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:34,860\nWe don't care about battery\nlife in a desktop so,\n\n1286\n01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:36,510\nthat's why we don't really need this.\n\n1287\n01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:39,670\nWe've also got quick muting or\nvolume adjustments.\n\n1288\n01:04:39,670 --> 01:04:41,723\nWhether we're sending to a projector.\n\n1289\n01:04:41,723 --> 01:04:43,500\nRight?\nSo if you've got a laptop and\n\n1290\n01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:46,080\nyou're doing a presentation,\nyou can turn that on and off.\n\n1291\n01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:49,660\nWhether there's an external\ndisplay hooked up to your laptop.\n\n1292\n01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:51,580\nAnd sync settings.\n\n1293\n01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:53,510\nNow what the heck\nare Sync Settings Ronnie?\n\n1294\n01:04:53,510 --> 01:04:54,700\nYeah.\n\n1295\n01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:55,900\nWhen we have multiple devices,\n\n1296\n01:04:55,900 --> 01:05:00,060\nwe want to makes sure that the files\nare consistent across those devices.\n\n1297\n01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:03,450\nIn Windows, it gives us the ability\nto have this sync center.\n\n1298\n01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:07,080\nAnd allows us,\nif we change our files one machine,\n\n1299\n01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:08,910\nwhen we go to the other machine\nwe can have it sync up.\n\n1300\n01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:11,950\nAnd it will actually take\nthose changes with it.\n\n1301\n01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:14,540\nYeah, now you might ask yourself, why not\njust put all your files in one place?\n\n1302\n01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:16,140\nThen you don't have to worry about that.\n\n1303\n01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:18,720\nWell the problem is what\nif I'm at the office, and\n\n1304\n01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:21,290\nmy files are on a file\nserver at the office?\n\n1305\n01:05:21,290 --> 01:05:22,240\nAnd then I go on a trip and\n\n1306\n01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:25,215\nI'm not at the office anymore,\nI don't have my files I can't work.\n\n1307\n01:05:25,215 --> 01:05:26,340\nRight?\n\n1308\n01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:29,640\nSo what sync center does, it allows\nus to cache a copy of those files.\n\n1309\n01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,980\nWe save a copy to our own machine and\n\n1310\n01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:34,340\nthen we are able to work with\nthem as if we were in the office.\n\n1311\n01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:35,670\nAnd when we get back,\n\n1312\n01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:38,800\nthey just automatically upload\nback to the server again.\n\n1313\n01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,430\nAnd now everybody else has\naccess to our changes.\n\n1314\n01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:42,520\nSo it allows you to work offline.\n\n1315\n01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:44,230\nWhen you don't have a network connection.\n\n1316\n01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:45,390\nIt's pretty cool stuff.\n\n1317\n01:05:45,390 --> 01:05:45,910\nRight?\n\n1318\n01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:49,290\nAll built right here\ninto our Mobility Center.\n\n1319\n01:05:49,290 --> 01:05:53,040\nYou know, the majority of what we see here\non that mobility center is really neat.\n\n1320\n01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:56,650\nBecause of what it really does, which is\nto help us save power when we need to,\n\n1321\n01:05:56,650 --> 01:06:02,010\nor to send power where we need to\nthe most, and it's all in one location.\n\n1322\n01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:03,950\nAll the different settings\nwe see right here,\n\n1323\n01:06:03,950 --> 01:06:07,330\nif I wanted to change the battery sets,\nI have to go to control panel and go here.\n\n1324\n01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:10,470\nWant to change the sound,\nhave to go to a different location.\n\n1325\n01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:13,030\nFor display, I have to go to\na different location to do it.\n\n1326\n01:06:13,030 --> 01:06:17,760\nBut with the mobility center, very quickly\nwe can have access to it all right here.\n\n1327\n01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:18,260\nYeah.\n\n1328\n01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:22,860\nSpeaking of mobile, one of the things\nI like to do is when I'm traveling,\n\n1329\n01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:25,610\nI might not have my laptop with me.\n\n1330\n01:06:25,610 --> 01:06:27,640\nAnd if I need to access some software or\n\n1331\n01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:30,930\nthings I use back at the office, if I\ndon't have my laptop, I don't have it.\n\n1332\n01:06:30,930 --> 01:06:31,640\nRight?\n\n1333\n01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:35,450\nWell, Windows includes a technology\ncalled Remote Desktop.\n\n1334\n01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:39,030\nAnd what it does, is it allows you\nto see the desktop of your computer,\n\n1335\n01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:41,970\neven if you're not there in\nthe same location as your computer.\n\n1336\n01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:43,110\nAll right?\n\n1337\n01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:48,886\nThe client for it is built into Windows,\nif we go to Start > All Programs\n\n1338\n01:06:48,886 --> 01:06:53,640\n> Accessories, you'll see it right there,\nRemote Desktop Connection.\n\n1339\n01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:58,230\nAnd you can punch in the address of\nyour computer, and it'll connect up and\n\n1340\n01:06:58,230 --> 01:07:02,000\nyou'll see the desktop as if you\nwere sitting at that machine.\n\n1341\n01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,240\nSo I could punch in a machine\nthat we have on our network.\n\n1342\n01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,280\nAnd it's gonna ask me to log in.\n\n1343\n01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:13,090\nLet's see if I can remember\nmy password for this machine.\n\n1344\n01:07:13,090 --> 01:07:13,990\nAnd so I'll punch that in.\n\n1345\n01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:15,615\nIt's gonna reach out to that machine,\n\n1346\n01:07:15,615 --> 01:07:18,600\n[LAUGH] and I don't remember my\npassword so it failed me there.\n\n1347\n01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:22,360\nBut let's try this a little\nbit differently here.\n\n1348\n01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:28,970\nAnd it's gonna connect up, and I'll see\na desktop that is that remote machine.\n\n1349\n01:07:28,970 --> 01:07:32,070\nSo I'm not sitting at this computer\nthat I'm connecting to right now.\n\n1350\n01:07:32,070 --> 01:07:34,690\nIt's here in this building,\nit's in another room.\n\n1351\n01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:39,040\nBut when it connects,\nit'll be as if I'm sitting right there.\n\n1352\n01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:40,380\nI'll have my start menu.\n\n1353\n01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:42,280\nI can get in and start to do work.\n\n1354\n01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:45,380\nAnd this is a server so you see I've\nbeen doing some various junk on it.\n\n1355\n01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:46,690\nBut basically I can get in and\n\n1356\n01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:48,760\nstart working with the system\nas if I was sitting there.\n\n1357\n01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:51,970\nThat's really cool because it means\nyou don't necessarily have to\n\n1358\n01:07:51,970 --> 01:07:53,890\nhave your laptop with you.\n\n1359\n01:07:53,890 --> 01:07:58,510\nInstead, could just borrow\nsomebody else's computer and\n\n1360\n01:07:58,510 --> 01:08:02,121\nuse remote desktop to view your machine,\nwherever it is.\n\n1361\n01:08:02,121 --> 01:08:06,080\nAll right, and there's a little more to it\nthan that, there's network configuration\n\n1362\n01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:09,140\nthat's involved, they don't get\ninto it on the MTA exam, but\n\n1363\n01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:11,640\nif you want to learn more,\ndefinitely check out Microsoft's website,\n\n1364\n01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,448\nthey've got a lot of\ndocumentation on remote desktop.\n\n1365\n01:08:13,448 --> 01:08:15,478\nAll right.\n\n1366\n01:08:15,478 --> 01:08:20,430\nSo, that wraps up some of\nthe basic mobile features, but\n\n1367\n01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:23,530\nwe're gonna kind of stay on that\nsame train of thought for the last\n\n1368\n01:08:23,530 --> 01:08:28,210\nobjective here, which is understand\nremote management and assistance.\n\n1369\n01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:31,950\nWhen I brought up that remote desktop,\nI was able to see the desktop of that\n\n1370\n01:08:31,950 --> 01:08:35,485\nmachine in another room,\neven though I wasn't there.\n\n1371\n01:08:35,485 --> 01:08:40,485\nAnd that's pretty cool, because you\ncan use that for remote assistance.\n\n1372\n01:08:40,485 --> 01:08:42,225\nA lot of IT departments will do that.\n\n1373\n01:08:42,225 --> 01:08:44,895\nThey'll use it to be able to remotely\nconnect to somebody else's machine.\n\n1374\n01:08:44,895 --> 01:08:46,445\nSo, if an end user calls in and\n\n1375\n01:08:46,445 --> 01:08:50,530\nsays hey I need some help, they can\npull up your screen to look at it.\n\n1376\n01:08:50,530 --> 01:08:52,240\nNow, the problem with remote desktop,\nis, that,\n\n1377\n01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:57,010\nby default, when you connect to somebody\nelse's screen, it locks their computer.\n\n1378\n01:08:57,010 --> 01:08:58,950\nThey can't see it anymore.\n\n1379\n01:08:58,950 --> 01:09:03,870\nSo, remote desktop really only allows\none person to use that machine.\n\n1380\n01:09:03,870 --> 01:09:06,540\nBut if we're gonna be supporting or\nhelping somebody.\n\n1381\n01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:10,660\nWe need two people to be able\nto see the machine, the user and\n\n1382\n01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:12,610\nthe help desk person.\n\n1383\n01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:13,230\nRight?\n\n1384\n01:09:13,230 --> 01:09:16,640\nSo if you're that user and you're\ncalling for help, they may tell you,\n\n1385\n01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:20,810\nhey, can I get you to turn\non remote assistance?\n\n1386\n01:09:20,810 --> 01:09:24,170\nAnd all remote assistance is\na special version of remote desktop\n\n1387\n01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:27,090\nthat let's the screens stay\nopen while it's connected.\n\n1388\n01:09:27,090 --> 01:09:27,760\nYeah.\n\n1389\n01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:31,920\nThe ability to have both the user\nas well as the help desk technician\n\n1390\n01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,300\nto be able to see,\nto monitor it at the same time,\n\n1391\n01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:37,940\nis that it allows the user to go see\nexactly what the technician is doing.\n\n1392\n01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:42,850\nAnd they can also interact through\na basic chat that opens between them.\n\n1393\n01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:45,400\nAnd it's very neat because you're\nsharing control of that desktop.\n\n1394\n01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:49,270\nAll right, so one of the things we\nhave to remember is that it may or\n\n1395\n01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:51,230\nmay not actually be turned\non on our computer.\n\n1396\n01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:54,170\nSo we need to double check that, and\nlet me show you how that's done.\n\n1397\n01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:56,060\nIf you bring up your Start Menu.\n\n1398\n01:09:56,060 --> 01:10:00,610\nYou can just right click on Computer and\nchoose Properties.\n\n1399\n01:10:01,970 --> 01:10:04,940\nAnd in the Properties screen of your\ncomputer, this is where you see what\n\n1400\n01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:09,015\nversion you're running and\nother data about your system in general.\n\n1401\n01:10:09,015 --> 01:10:12,735\nAnd on the left side,\nyou'll see Remote Settings.\n\n1402\n01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:16,245\nAnd under Remote Settings is where\nwe can turn on Remote Desktop, and\n\n1403\n01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:17,885\nwe can turn on Remote Assistant.\n\n1404\n01:10:17,885 --> 01:10:19,185\nSo you'll see mine's already on,\n\n1405\n01:10:19,185 --> 01:10:21,575\nAllow Remote Assistance\nconnections to this computer.\n\n1406\n01:10:21,575 --> 01:10:25,640\nSo, a help desk person would be allowed\nto connect and be able to see my screen.\n\n1407\n01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:28,210\nRemote desktop on the other\nhand is turned off.\n\n1408\n01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:31,670\nSo if I want that I need to turn it on,\nand I've got two options here.\n\n1409\n01:10:31,670 --> 01:10:35,590\nOne, that is the old way of doing it,\nless secure,\n\n1410\n01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:38,060\nand another way that's the new way\nof doing it, which is more secure.\n\n1411\n01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:40,150\nAnd that's generally the one we want.\n\n1412\n01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:43,180\nThe reason the less secure is there\nis if you're still supporting older,\n\n1413\n01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:46,480\nlike Windows 2000 machines,\nthen you might need to choose that option.\n\n1414\n01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:50,060\nBut otherwise you should be able\nto do the higher level one.\n\n1415\n01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:53,430\nAnd when we say OK,\nnow remote desktop is turned on.\n\n1416\n01:10:53,430 --> 01:10:55,630\nSomebody could fire up their\nremote desktop client and\n\n1417\n01:10:55,630 --> 01:10:58,630\npoint it at this computer, and\nas long as they had a username and\n\n1418\n01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:00,980\na password,\nthey'd be able to connect and see it.\n\n1419\n01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:01,540\nRight?\n\n1420\n01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:03,000\nThere's still a username and a password.\n\n1421\n01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:03,820\nRight?\nIt doesn't mean we're just\n\n1422\n01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:06,040\nautomatically sharing our\ncomputer with everybody.\n\n1423\n01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:08,078\nThere's still some authentication\nthat has to occur.\n\n1424\n01:11:10,738 --> 01:11:11,280\nAll right,\n\n1425\n01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:15,700\nnow the last thing that Microsoft calls\nout is something a little more advanced.\n\n1426\n01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:20,520\nThere are some specialized administrative\ntools that are built into the system, and\n\n1427\n01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,640\nwe talked about those earlier in the show.\n\n1428\n01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,810\nMost end users will never need them,\nbut they are there.\n\n1429\n01:11:25,810 --> 01:11:29,650\nThey can be used and as you learn more\nabout the Windows operating system,\n\n1430\n01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:32,130\nyou'll find yourself using them more and\nmore.\n\n1431\n01:11:32,130 --> 01:11:34,600\nThe two main interfaces for those tools,\n\n1432\n01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:37,050\nthough, are something special\nthat we need to be aware of.\n\n1433\n01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:38,960\nThey don't expect you to be\nable to use them for the exam.\n\n1434\n01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,560\nThey just want you to be aware of them.\n\n1435\n01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:41,270\nAll right.\n\n1436\n01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:45,590\nThe most common one is a graphical\nuser interface called the MMC or\n\n1437\n01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:47,850\nthe Microsoft Management Console.\n\n1438\n01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:50,430\nNow the MMC is really pervasive.\n\n1439\n01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:52,816\nIt's used throughout a lot of\ntools inside of Microsoft Windows.\n\n1440\n01:11:52,816 --> 01:11:54,856\nLet me show you what the MMC is.\n\n1441\n01:11:54,856 --> 01:11:59,675\nSo I'm just gonna bring up my start\nmenu and I'll just type MMC by itself.\n\n1442\n01:11:59,675 --> 01:12:03,215\nAnd I'll run that, it's asking for\nour administrative privileges so\n\n1443\n01:12:03,215 --> 01:12:05,170\nI'll say yes to that.\n\n1444\n01:12:05,170 --> 01:12:08,570\nAll right,\nthis is the Microsoft Management Console.\n\n1445\n01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:10,830\nBy itself, it's not very impressive.\n\n1446\n01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:15,295\nYou have a navigation tree on the left,\nyou have a action, or a Details pane.\n\n1447\n01:12:15,295 --> 01:12:17,335\nDetails pane, there we go.\n\n1448\n01:12:17,335 --> 01:12:21,645\nWhere our actual work gets done, and\nthen our action pane on the right\n\n1449\n01:12:21,645 --> 01:12:25,642\nthat shows what normally would\nbe under a right click menu.\n\n1450\n01:12:25,642 --> 01:12:28,422\nWhen I launch the MMC\nit's got none of that.\n\n1451\n01:12:28,422 --> 01:12:33,012\nSo all the MMC really is,\nis a framework for other tools.\n\n1452\n01:12:33,012 --> 01:12:33,602\nThat being said,\n\n1453\n01:12:33,602 --> 01:12:36,602\nyou're going to see this all throughout\nthe rest of the administrative tools.\n\n1454\n01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:42,842\nIf I go to my control panel,\nand I go into my system and\n\n1455\n01:12:42,842 --> 01:12:47,920\nsecurity administrative tools, and\nI pick really any of these tools.\n\n1456\n01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,840\nI'll go into,\nlet's do computer management.\n\n1457\n01:12:50,870 --> 01:12:52,200\nThat's a popular one.\n\n1458\n01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,790\nSo I'm gonna go into computer management.\n\n1459\n01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:58,520\nAnd what you'll see is,\nthis is built on top of the MMC.\n\n1460\n01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:02,950\nI've got my navigation pane on the left,\nmy detail pane in the middle, and\n\n1461\n01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:04,900\nmy action pane on the right.\n\n1462\n01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:07,020\nAnd they're context sensitive so\n\n1463\n01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:10,300\ndepending on what I click on,\nwhat it displays is going to change.\n\n1464\n01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:14,720\nSo for example, if I want to manage\nmy hard drives, I might click on disk\n\n1465\n01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:20,050\nmanagement and so I'll choose that,\nthe middle changes to show my hard drives.\n\n1466\n01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:23,830\nI've got a C drive,\nit's 60 gbs in size, and here it is.\n\n1467\n01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:30,140\nAnd then on the right side, this will\nchange based on what I click on too, and,\n\n1468\n01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:31,780\nit's actually not really doing much here,\nis it?\n\n1469\n01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:33,590\nI might have picked a bad\nexample on this one.\n\n1470\n01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:37,350\nLets try device manager.\n\n1471\n01:13:37,350 --> 01:13:37,850\nWell, shoot.\n\n1472\n01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:41,090\nAnd then, oh there we go, event viewer.\n\n1473\n01:13:41,090 --> 01:13:45,230\nSo when I go into my event viewer, as I\ngo in to view my event logs or whatever,\n\n1474\n01:13:45,230 --> 01:13:47,950\nsee how the right side is\nstarting to fill up with stuff?\n\n1475\n01:13:47,950 --> 01:13:51,560\nThese are all different commands that I\ncan run, things that I can get the system\n\n1476\n01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:56,360\nto do, so if I am looking at a log entry\nhere, I can clear it, I can filter,\n\n1477\n01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:59,600\nI can pull the properties of that event,\nI can find events, right?\n\n1478\n01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,900\nJust simple actions that I can perform.\n\n1479\n01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:04,340\nSo that's why they call\nit the Action Center.\n\n1480\n01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:08,490\nBut this framework is what the MMC is,\nthree window panes.\n\n1481\n01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:10,330\nNavigation on the left,\n\n1482\n01:14:10,330 --> 01:14:15,280\ndetails in the middle, action on\nthe right, and that's what we're seeing.\n\n1483\n01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:18,030\nAnd you can turn those panes on and off.\n\n1484\n01:14:18,030 --> 01:14:20,640\nSo sometimes you might be in the MMC and\n\n1485\n01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,800\nnot realize it just because you\ndon't see those other panes.\n\n1486\n01:14:24,290 --> 01:14:27,470\nThe nice thing about this, the blank MMC,\nis that it gives you the ability to\n\n1487\n01:14:27,470 --> 01:14:31,150\ncreate your own custom set\nof tools if you want to.\n\n1488\n01:14:31,150 --> 01:14:34,680\nAnd you learn more about that as you\ngo into other certifications too.\n\n1489\n01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:37,530\nThat way you're only focusing\nin on the tools you need\n\n1490\n01:14:37,530 --> 01:14:39,210\nwithout having to pick\nthrough the entire list.\n\n1491\n01:14:40,730 --> 01:14:41,550\nYup.\n\n1492\n01:14:41,550 --> 01:14:45,320\nNow, there is another administrative\ntool that they want us to touch on.\n\n1493\n01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:47,310\nIt's the most advanced one.\n\n1494\n01:14:47,310 --> 01:14:48,670\nA lot of the tools we've shown you,\nactually,\n\n1495\n01:14:48,670 --> 01:14:52,220\nall the tools we've shown you have\nbeen graphical user interfaces.\n\n1496\n01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:54,970\nAnd that's great if you're the person\nsitting at the computer and\n\n1497\n01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:59,350\nyou want to do something and\nit's just a one time thing.\n\n1498\n01:14:59,350 --> 01:15:02,790\nBut what if I need to change\na setting on a thousand computers?\n\n1499\n01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:07,020\nWell, we're not gonna want to go to each\nof those machines and do it by hand.\n\n1500\n01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:08,750\nWe're gonna want to automate that.\n\n1501\n01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:10,840\nAnd we automate it by writing scripts.\n\n1502\n01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:13,580\nScripts are just a file that\ncontains a series of commands, and\n\n1503\n01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:15,230\nthey all run in order.\n\n1504\n01:15:15,230 --> 01:15:18,590\nAnd you can use those to run\ncommands on thousands of machines\n\n1505\n01:15:18,590 --> 01:15:21,310\nin a matter of minutes, very,\nvery quickly, all right?\n\n1506\n01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:23,570\nBut it's all done via command line.\n\n1507\n01:15:23,570 --> 01:15:26,920\nSo I want to show you an example of that,\neven though you don't have to use it.\n\n1508\n01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:29,000\nBut just so\nyou can see what it looks like.\n\n1509\n01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,890\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nfire up the PowerShell.\n\n1510\n01:15:32,890 --> 01:15:39,300\nNow, if I bring that up, just bring\nit here, the font's a little small.\n\n1511\n01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:44,190\nLet me bump that font size up so we'll\nactually be able to see it on the screen.\n\n1512\n01:15:44,190 --> 01:15:45,273\nAnd that should probably be big enough.\n\n1513\n01:15:45,273 --> 01:15:45,773\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n1514\n01:15:46,785 --> 01:15:48,835\nAll right, there we go.\n\n1515\n01:15:48,835 --> 01:15:52,310\nAll right, so this is the command\nprompt for the Windows PowerShell.\n\n1516\n01:15:52,310 --> 01:15:53,815\nAn average end user,\n\n1517\n01:15:53,815 --> 01:15:57,780\neven your average help desk support\ntechnician is not going not use this.\n\n1518\n01:15:57,780 --> 01:16:00,750\nBut your desktop engineers, the people\nwho are designing massive deployments,\n\n1519\n01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:02,380\nthey are going to use this.\n\n1520\n01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:06,990\nAnd there's a ton of commands that they\ncan run that do all sorts of things,\n\n1521\n01:16:06,990 --> 01:16:10,810\nfrom launching applications in the\nbackground, to shutting the computer down,\n\n1522\n01:16:10,810 --> 01:16:15,340\nto installing software,\nto just harvesting all sorts of data.\n\n1523\n01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:16,490\nIt's really, really powerful.\n\n1524\n01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:18,490\nSo, for example,\n\n1525\n01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:21,680\nI can pull up a list of all of\nthe software running in the background.\n\n1526\n01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:23,530\nI can say get-service, and\n\n1527\n01:16:23,530 --> 01:16:28,720\nit'll return a list of all the services,\nand whether they're running or not.\n\n1528\n01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:29,950\nAnd so I can look in here and\n\n1529\n01:16:29,950 --> 01:16:32,510\nsee all these different things\nthat are kind of running.\n\n1530\n01:16:32,510 --> 01:16:36,150\nAnd maybe I'll find one,\nhere, we'll take DNS cache.\n\n1531\n01:16:36,150 --> 01:16:40,070\nMy DNS cache is running right now,\nI can see it right there, and\n\n1532\n01:16:40,070 --> 01:16:43,750\nI could start it or stop it or\nwhatever right from here.\n\n1533\n01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:48,290\nSo I could say stop-service dnscache,\nand that's gonna run.\n\n1534\n01:16:48,290 --> 01:16:52,050\nAnd apparently it is, let's see.\n\n1535\n01:16:52,050 --> 01:16:54,040\nCannot open DNS cache on computer.\n\n1536\n01:16:55,330 --> 01:16:56,270\nThat might not be its name.\n\n1537\n01:16:56,270 --> 01:16:58,440\nIt might actually be called.\n\n1538\n01:16:58,440 --> 01:16:59,560\nWell no it recognized it.\n\n1539\n01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:00,240\nDNS client.\n\n1540\n01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:02,700\nWonder why it didn't stop it?\n\n1541\n01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:03,680\nWe can try and restart it.\n\n1542\n01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:06,090\nSo I'll try and restart that service.\n\n1543\n01:17:06,090 --> 01:17:07,560\nMaybe I picked one that can't be stopped.\n\n1544\n01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:10,630\nYeah, it's not happy about that one.\n\n1545\n01:17:10,630 --> 01:17:11,690\nLet's pick somebody else.\n\n1546\n01:17:11,690 --> 01:17:12,260\nSpooler?\n\n1547\n01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:14,820\nSure, what's the Spooler called,\ndo you remember?\n\n1548\n01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:16,040\nI think it's called Spooler.\n\n1549\n01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:16,540\nOh is it.\n\n1550\n01:17:17,890 --> 01:17:18,570\nWell here, we can find out.\n\n1551\n01:17:18,570 --> 01:17:19,791\nYeah.\nLet's go back up here and\n\n1552\n01:17:19,791 --> 01:17:23,250\nwe'll find the print Spooler It\nis called Spooler, you are right.\n\n1553\n01:17:23,250 --> 01:17:26,520\nSo I'll say stop-service spooler.\n\n1554\n01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:29,800\nThat's what controls printing,\noh I know what the problem is.\n\n1555\n01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:30,380\nAdministrative.\n\n1556\n01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:31,830\nI'm not an administrator, shoot.\n\n1557\n01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,430\nWhen you launch that thing,\nit's not an administrator by default, and\n\n1558\n01:17:36,430 --> 01:17:37,610\nthat's why it's not letting me do it.\n\n1559\n01:17:37,610 --> 01:17:41,030\nSo here let me run that as\nan administrator this time.\n\n1560\n01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:44,640\nI'm logged in as just a regular user so\nit was just kind of angry about that.\n\n1561\n01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:47,310\nAnd and\nstopped me from doing what I wanted so,\n\n1562\n01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:50,700\nagain you won't have to\ndo this on the exam.\n\n1563\n01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:52,740\nIt's just something to be familiar with,\nso\n\n1564\n01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:58,860\nnow if I say stop-service spooler,\nhas dependent services.\n\n1565\n01:17:58,860 --> 01:18:00,150\nOkay.\nYeah that'll, that'll do it every time.\n\n1566\n01:18:00,150 --> 01:18:01,724\nAll right.\nSo I don't want to hunt that one down.\n\n1567\n01:18:01,724 --> 01:18:02,720\n[LAUGH] Let's do the cache.\n\n1568\n01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:03,612\nThere we go.\nThere we go.\n\n1569\n01:18:03,612 --> 01:18:05,100\nSo that one's now stopped.\n\n1570\n01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:11,700\nAnd if I do a get-service,\nI can go in here and find the DNS cache,\n\n1571\n01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:15,240\nand what I'll see is that it's no longer\nrunning, or at least I hope it's not.\n\n1572\n01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:15,780\nYep, it's stopped.\n\n1573\n01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:16,380\nThere it is, yep.\n\n1574\n01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:20,855\nSo it is stopped, and\nI can always start it again if I want to.\n\n1575\n01:18:20,855 --> 01:18:26,353\nThat was the DNS cache and\nnow it's gonna start up, now it's running.\n\n1576\n01:18:26,353 --> 01:18:28,965\nSo interesting way to work with things,\nnot convenient.\n\n1577\n01:18:28,965 --> 01:18:33,400\nYou gotta remember your commands and all\nthat, it's not easy, but if you're gonna\n\n1578\n01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:38,020\nautomate some kind of activity,\nthe PowerShell is really powerful.\n\n1579\n01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:39,750\nYep.\nThat is the name so.\n\n1580\n01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:43,710\nAll right that is another administrative\ntool that is at our disposal.\n\n1581\n01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:46,480\nAll right, well with that,\n\n1582\n01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:50,700\nthat pretty much wraps up our basic\noperating system configurations.\n\n1583\n01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:53,680\nFor those of you that\nmove on to do the MCSA or\n\n1584\n01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:57,590\nthe MCSE track,\nyou're gonna learn a ton more.\n\n1585\n01:18:57,590 --> 01:19:00,740\nDeveloping custom Windows installations,\nand software deployments,\n\n1586\n01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:02,320\nand PowerShell out the wazoo.\n\n1587\n01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:05,590\nYou'll learn all sorts of stuff\nthat's really powerful, but\n\n1588\n01:19:05,590 --> 01:19:08,320\nat the MTA level they just want you to be\nfamiliar with some of the different things\n\n1589\n01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,710\nthat are out there and\njust kind of know what's on the table.\n\n1590\n01:19:10,710 --> 01:19:14,600\nWhat are the possibilities for you when\nyou work with the operating system?\n\n1591\n01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:19,620\nAll right, well, that's a pretty good\nspot for us to wrap up this episode.\n\n1592\n01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:24,840\nWe've got more MTA episodes coming up,\nso don't ditch just yet, but\n\n1593\n01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:29,410\nif you have any questions on what\nwe covered so far, be sure to ask.\n\n1594\n01:19:29,410 --> 01:19:32,430\nLive during the show,\nyou can go to itpro.tv/live and\n\n1595\n01:19:32,430 --> 01:19:35,030\nyou'll see the chat window\nright beneath the video.\n\n1596\n01:19:35,030 --> 01:19:36,220\nPost your questions in there.\n\n1597\n01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:38,530\nWe monitor and answer during the show.\n\n1598\n01:19:38,530 --> 01:19:41,853\nIf you have questions after the show,\nuse our Q&A

00:00:38,751\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:38,751 --> 00:00:40,960\nI'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,910\nBack again with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:42,840\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,170\n>> It is going well today.\n\n8\n00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:48,553\nWe are ready for another exciting episode\ninto the world of MTA and taking a look at\n\n9\n00:00:48,553 --> 00:00:52,760\nour operating system, learning more\nabout configuration and installing.\n\n10\n00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,224\n>> Now we're picking right up where we,\nwe left off and\n\n11\n00:00:56,224 --> 00:01:01,050\njumping into the second objective for\nthe 98-349 exam.\n\n12\n00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,610\nI've gotta remember my exam numbers.\n\n13\n00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:03,752\n>> That's a weird number.\n\n14\n00:01:03,752 --> 00:01:08,332\n>> And this one, the official exam\nobjective name is Installing and\n\n15\n00:01:08,332 --> 00:01:10,340\nUpgrading Client Systems.\n\n16\n00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,899\nAnd, I don't know why they say client\nsystems cuz they're really talking about\n\n17\n00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:15,060\njust Windows 7 systems.\n\n18\n00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,340\nBut when we're upgrading,\n\n19\n00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,750\nthat means we're coming from an older\noperating system to Windows 7.\n\n20\n00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,920\nSo I guess that's why they\njust say client in general.\n\n21\n00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,800\nSo, there's some things\nwe need to think about\n\n22\n00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,130\nwhen we're trying to put Windows 7\non a machine that doesn't have it.\n\n23\n00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:29,830\nAll right?\n\n24\n00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,860\nLet's start with the easiest scenario.\n\n25\n00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,470\nYou just got a computer and it has no\noperating system on it whatsoever.\n\n26\n00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,150\nAll right?\nSo, it's just blank, it's got no OS, and\n\n27\n00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,570\nwe need to install Windows 7.\n\n28\n00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,020\nSo, we're not coming from anything,\n\n29\n00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,630\nwe don't need to restore any data,\nwe're just putting Windows 7 on a machine.\n\n30\n00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,670\nNow, you might be really excited\nto get Windows 7 fired up and so\n\n31\n00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,880\nyou jump right in and start installing.\n\n32\n00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,140\nBut that shouldn't be your first step.\n\n33\n00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,850\nYour first step should be to make\nsure the that machine you've got,\n\n34\n00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:02,100\nthe hardware,\nis actually capable of running Windows 7.\n\n35\n00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,750\nWindows 7 has a set of minimum system\nrequirements that your hardware needs\n\n36\n00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,750\nto meet, or\nyou won't be able to run Windows 7.\n\n37\n00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,544\nA lot of times, it'll still let\nyou install, but it'll run so\n\n38\n00:02:11,544 --> 00:02:13,650\nslow that you're gonna be miserable.\n\n39\n00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,910\nYou'd be better off staying with some\nother operating system at that point.\n\n40\n00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,060\n>> With the installation, we not only have\nto check out those minimum requirements.\n\n41\n00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,620\nWe should know what they are.\n\n42\n00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,960\nThe nice thing is, when you go and\n\n43\n00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,520\nfind your copy of Windows 7 that you're\nready to install, most of them will have\n\n44\n00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,730\nthe minimum requirements directly on if\nyou go and purchase it and it's in a box.\n\n45\n00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,690\nOr you can go and check out a website\nto actually help you to figure out\n\n46\n00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,220\nwhat the minimum requirements are.\n\n47\n00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,180\nThat way,\n\n48\n00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,420\nyou'll be able to actually know if your\ncomputer system's ready for it or not.\n\n49\n00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,810\n>> Yeah and I've got that\nwebpage pulled up right here.\n\n50\n00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,960\nAnd I, just so you guys know, at home,\nI have these in our show notes.\n\n51\n00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,020\nAnd we'll post the show\nnotes with the episode, so\n\n52\n00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,620\nyou don't have to try to jot\nall these down, or whatever.\n\n53\n00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,890\nBut we'll have links for\nit on the website.\n\n54\n00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:59,970\nBut what we're looking at here is the\nthe Windows 7 system requirements page,\n\n55\n00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,340\nand so we can see some basic information\ntelling us what we need to have\n\n56\n00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,520\nif we want to install Windows 7.\n\n57\n00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,760\nAnd I guess I will.\n\n58\n00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,220\nLet me zoom that in so\nit's a little bit more legible.\n\n59\n00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,380\nIt's kind of hard to see all that.\n\n60\n00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:14,822\nBut but this is basically it and now\nmy screen is scrolled kind of weird but\n\n61\n00:03:14,822 --> 00:03:15,754\nwe-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n62\n00:03:15,754 --> 00:03:16,384\n>> We can still see it.\n\n63\n00:03:16,384 --> 00:03:17,754\nI'll, I'll bear with it.\n\n64\n00:03:17,754 --> 00:03:22,380\nSo so here, if we want to run Windows\n7 on your PC here's what it takes.\n\n65\n00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,555\nWe need a one gigahertz or\nfaster processor.\n\n66\n00:03:25,555 --> 00:03:30,615\nAnd it can be 32-bit, or 64-bit, doesn't\nmatter, Windows 7 will run on both.\n\n67\n00:03:30,615 --> 00:03:33,135\nNow, just to put this in perspective,\n\n68\n00:03:33,135 --> 00:03:39,000\nI don't think you can buy a computer today\nthat is lower than one gigahertz, right?\n\n69\n00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,270\nBut, you, this might not be a new\ncomputer, this might be one you've had for\n\n70\n00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:42,820\na few years.\n\n71\n00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,890\nSo, you need at least to have a gigahertz\nfor the speed of the processor.\n\n72\n00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,730\nYou also need at least one\ngigabyte of RAM, right?\n\n73\n00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:55,150\nYou need some memory to be able to handle\nthis, and Windows 7 recommends one gig.\n\n74\n00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,930\n>> We also have, of course,\nthe hard drive space that we need.\n\n75\n00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,580\nAnd you're running\na 32-bit operating system,\n\n76\n00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,530\nit tells you it requires at least\n16 gigs of hard drive space.\n\n77\n00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,840\nBut if you're going for\n\n78\n00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,370\nthe 64-bit, it's gonna require at least\n20 gigs of free space on that hard drive.\n\n79\n00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,300\n>> Yeah, and that's just,\nyou know, room on the drive.\n\n80\n00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,140\nNow that used to be a lot of space,\nbut on modern hard drives,\n\n81\n00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,010\nI don't think you could buy a hard drive\ntoday that was less than like 128 gigs.\n\n82\n00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,286\nSo, this is not normally a big issue,\nbut again,\n\n83\n00:04:21,286 --> 00:04:24,880\nif you're dealing with older hardware,\nwe've got to pay attention to that.\n\n84\n00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,101\nAnd the last entry here says that we need\nto have a DirectX 9 graphics device with\n\n85\n00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:31,400\nWDDN 1.0 or higher driver.\n\n86\n00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,880\nThat is really specific,\nwhat the heck is it talking about?\n\n87\n00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,080\nWell, when you buy a video card for\n\n88\n00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,350\nyour computer, it'll specify on there\nwhat level of DirectX it supports.\n\n89\n00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:45,024\nAnd DirectX 9 is not a new thing, so any\nvideo card manufactured in the last five,\n\n90\n00:04:45,024 --> 00:04:48,980\nmaybe even six years is more than\nlikely going to meet that, but\n\n91\n00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,620\nit's always worth double-checking.\n\n92\n00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,280\nThe arrow interface that\nwe talked about back in,\n\n93\n00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,970\nin the first episode is dependent\non this video card functionality.\n\n94\n00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,300\nIf you don't, you'll lose certain\nthings like the Aero interface.\n\n95\n00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,320\nMaybe you don't care about that.\n\n96\n00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:02,920\nThat might be fine.\n\n97\n00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,260\nBut, otherwise you'll need it, right?\n\n98\n00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,805\n>> So, here are the basic system\nrequirements to ensure that Windows 7 will\n\n99\n00:05:08,805 --> 00:05:10,200\nat least run.\n\n100\n00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,430\nNow, if you just meet those bare\nrequirements, you're gonna be able\n\n101\n00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,770\nto run it, but you're probably not going\nto get the best experience of your life.\n\n102\n00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:20,610\nSo just kinda realize that, that what\nwere talking about as the minimum.\n\n103\n00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,800\nNotice that even on this list,\n\n104\n00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,000\nthere is actually a whole list of\nadditional requirements that you might\n\n105\n00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,760\nfind that might enhance the way you\ncan actually run the operating system.\n\n106\n00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,340\n>> Yeah, and\nthese are just like odds and ends.\n\n107\n00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,920\nIf you have internet access.\n\n108\n00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You'll be happy.\n\n109\n00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:34,630\nRight?\n\n110\n00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,760\nIf you don't have internet access,\nyou won't.\n\n111\n00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,712\nSo, so various things like that.\n\n112\n00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:42,455\nYou know, for some Windows Media Center\nfunctionality, a TV tuner is required.\n\n113\n00:05:42,455 --> 00:05:44,885\nThese are extra components\nyou don't have to have, but\n\n114\n00:05:44,885 --> 00:05:48,525\nif you want that particular functionality,\nyou'll need.\n\n115\n00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:52,095\nAnd so, those were all kind of\noptional components there at the end.\n\n116\n00:05:52,095 --> 00:05:54,846\nNow, they also mentioned\nmulti-core processors and\n\n117\n00:05:54,846 --> 00:05:58,705\nWindows 7 does support multi-core\nprocessors, so that's fine.\n\n118\n00:05:58,705 --> 00:06:02,865\nYou don't need a multi-core, so\nif your system is dual core or\n\n119\n00:06:02,865 --> 00:06:05,710\nquad core or whatever, that's great.\n\n120\n00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,380\nIt'll run faster, but\nyou don't need that, all right?\n\n121\n00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,630\nSo, just bear that in mind when\nyou're looking at your hardware.\n\n122\n00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,920\nIf it doesn't meet these requirements,\nyou shouldn't run Windows 7 on it.\n\n123\n00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,380\nIt's not gonna run very well.\n\n124\n00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,250\nThe other thing to remember is that\nthese are the minimum requirements.\n\n125\n00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,080\nThis is just to run Windows.\n\n126\n00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,890\nWell, most people don't just run Windows.\n\n127\n00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,940\nYou normally run other\napplications on top of it.\n\n128\n00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,720\nAnd they're going to have their\nown demands that add on to this.\n\n129\n00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,320\nSo, just barely meeting these\nminimums is usually not good enough.\n\n130\n00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,260\nYou normally need to exceed it to\nallow for your other software.\n\n131\n00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,670\nSo, key thing to remember.\n\n132\n00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,890\nNow there is one thing that they\ndon't mention on this page and\n\n133\n00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,170\nthey really should.\n\n134\n00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,290\nThere's some things like\nWindows Media Center.\n\n135\n00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:53,890\nIf you want Windows Media Center,\nnot every version of Windows 7 has it.\n\n136\n00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:58,110\nSo, when we know that our hardware\nmeets the minimum requirements,\n\n137\n00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:01,270\nthe next thing that we've\ngot to figure out is,\n\n138\n00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,960\nwhat version of Windows 7 is going to\nhave all the software that we need?\n\n139\n00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,520\nAnd this is where it\ngets kind of confusing.\n\n140\n00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,400\n>> There's multiple editions of\nWindows 7 ranging from actually there,\n\n141\n00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,830\nthere used to be like a lot more,\n\n142\n00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,150\nI think we've kind of paired it down-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n143\n00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:19,230\n>> Things like Windows oh 7 Home Premium,\nand now Windows 7 Professional and\n\n144\n00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:23,880\nthen there's an Enterprise and Ultimate,\nI think is what we end up with.\n\n145\n00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,995\n>> Yeah, there u, there,\n\n146\n00:07:24,995 --> 00:07:27,552\nI think at one point they were\nup to eight different SKUs.\n\n147\n00:07:27,552 --> 00:07:29,345\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They had to call them SKUs or S-K-Us,\n\n148\n00:07:29,345 --> 00:07:31,110\nthere were,\nthere were several different ones.\n\n149\n00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,420\nAnd Microsoft has pruned\nthat down a good bit.\n\n150\n00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:38,580\nSo, there was a Windows Home Edition and\na Home Premium and they\n\n151\n00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,610\nbasically eliminated the Home Edition and\njust went with Home Premium after a while.\n\n152\n00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,970\nThere's professional,\nenterprise, and ultimate.\n\n153\n00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:45,720\nEnterprise and ultimate,\n\n154\n00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,120\nthey group together cuz they're\nbasically the same thing.\n\n155\n00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,920\nAnd then there was a Starter Edition\nthat they pruned off.\n\n156\n00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,140\nThey don't do that one anymore.\n\n157\n00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,082\nAnd, and, there, there were a few\nother weird ones that were out there.\n\n158\n00:07:55,082 --> 00:07:57,546\nSo, now there's really just three\nthat we need to remember and\n\n159\n00:07:57,546 --> 00:07:59,880\nthese are the ones you'll see on the exam.\n\n160\n00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,406\nThe most base version\nIs Windows Home Premium.\n\n161\n00:08:03,406 --> 00:08:06,920\nAnd like its name implies,\nit's designed for home users.\n\n162\n00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,560\nIf you're going to be using this at home,\na single machine or\n\n163\n00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,280\na couple of machines that share files,\nit works great.\n\n164\n00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,060\nIts got the features that\nyour average user needs.\n\n165\n00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,810\nSo, you'll see that its got improved\ndesktop navigation and so on.\n\n166\n00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,790\nMost of this stuff is marketing fluff,\nright?\n\n167\n00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,810\nBut but its got the basic\nthings that you want for home.\n\n168\n00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:24,960\nIt's Home Premium.\n\n169\n00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,260\nSo it includes Windows Media Center,\nwhich is kind of nice.\n\n170\n00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,610\nThe old Home without the Premium\npart didn't include Media Center.\n\n171\n00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:36,365\n>> We also have the Windows\n7 Professional Edition.\n\n172\n00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:39,805\nThe advantage of the Windows 7\nProfessional Edition is being able to do\n\n173\n00:08:39,805 --> 00:08:43,475\nwhat we, we call the domain join here,\nis really the clear advantage.\n\n174\n00:08:43,475 --> 00:08:46,545\nThat allows us to be able to have that\ncomputer as part of a bigger security\n\n175\n00:08:46,545 --> 00:08:49,747\ngroup and\nthen we can manage it using policies, too.\n\n176\n00:08:49,747 --> 00:08:54,227\n>> Yeah, in a business environment, you're\nalmost always going to have a domain that\n\n177\n00:08:54,227 --> 00:08:56,287\nconnects all the computers together so\n\n178\n00:08:56,287 --> 00:09:00,207\nyou can have one user account, and\nlog in on all the different computers.\n\n179\n00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,467\nIt's really kind of\na requirement these days.\n\n180\n00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:05,426\nSo, you're pretty much gonna need to\nstep up to the Professional version,\n\n181\n00:09:05,426 --> 00:09:07,217\nthe Home version doesn't.\n\n182\n00:09:07,217 --> 00:09:10,159\nAnother difference that we'll see,\nit's buried in here somewhere,\n\n183\n00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,460\nis remote desktop.\n\n184\n00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:16,400\nThe Home versions of Windows 7 don't\nsupport being a remote desktop host,\n\n185\n00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,110\nlike you can't remote desktop into them.\n\n186\n00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,780\nThey can be a client but not a host.\n\n187\n00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,300\nWith the WIndows 7 Professional,\nthey can, they can do both, and so\n\n188\n00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,310\nthat's an extra function that we get.\n\n189\n00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:29,920\nIf that's something you need,\nyou'll need to step up to Windows 7 Pro.\n\n190\n00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,560\nAnd then,\nthere's the Windows 7 Enterprise/Ultimate.\n\n191\n00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,210\nOkay?\n\n192\n00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,880\nThese include all of\nthe features of Windows 7.\n\n193\n00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,694\nEvery little bell and\nwhistle that you can think of and\n\n194\n00:09:41,694 --> 00:09:47,215\nthey even include over 35 different\nlanguages that you can run Windows in.\n\n195\n00:09:47,215 --> 00:09:50,404\nSo if you speak something other\nthan the localized language for\n\n196\n00:09:50,404 --> 00:09:54,506\nyour countries, like here in the US,\nif I speak German instead of English.\n\n197\n00:09:54,506 --> 00:09:58,210\nWell, I can install Ultimate Edition,\nand I can put it in German mode and\n\n198\n00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,397\nit will change all the icons and\nbuttons and\n\n199\n00:10:00,397 --> 00:10:03,980\nstuff to reflect their German\nnaming as opposed to English.\n\n200\n00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,280\nSo, kind of cool\nfunctionality if you need it.\n\n201\n00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,850\nMost people don't.\n\n202\n00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,920\nNow, ultimate is the most\nexpensive of these versions.\n\n203\n00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,090\nAnd for a Home user, if you want all of\nthe features, that's what you will need.\n\n204\n00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:17,540\nIn the business world,\nthere's the Enterprise edition.\n\n205\n00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,680\nAnd of these four, Enterprise is\nthe only one that you can't buy.\n\n206\n00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,160\nYou can't go down to the store and\nfind a copy of the Enterprise Edition.\n\n207\n00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,690\nYou only get that if you enter into an\nenterprise agreement with Microsoft, and\n\n208\n00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,160\nthat requires you to be\npurchasing hundreds,\n\n209\n00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,980\nif not thousands of\nlicenses from Microsoft.\n\n210\n00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,030\nIt's designed for big companies, and\nthey get it as part of their agreement.\n\n211\n00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,260\nSo it's special.\n\n212\n00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,770\nIt's not sold on the web.\n\n213\n00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,430\nYou have to have it as\npart of your agreement.\n\n214\n00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:47,540\nNow, you might ask yourself,\nwhy not just go with the big one up there?\n\n215\n00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,230\nAnd it all comes down to price point.\n\n216\n00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,580\nWith each addition,\nit gets more and more expensive.\n\n217\n00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,100\nUltimate, when it first came out,\nwas about $400 a license.\n\n218\n00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,430\nSo, if you take an already\nexpensive computer and\n\n219\n00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:02,830\nthen stick a $400 OS license on there,\nthat's pretty expensive.\n\n220\n00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:06,660\nVersus Home Premium, when it came out was,\nI want to say it was $89 or something.\n\n221\n00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,090\nIt wasn't, you know,\nthat terribly expensive.\n\n222\n00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,610\nSo, huge difference in\nprice between the editions.\n\n223\n00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:17,910\nSo, if our hardware meets the requirements\nand we know which edition we want.\n\n224\n00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,450\nWe go out and buy that edition that\nwe're ready to do the install right?\n\n225\n00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,470\nWe've done our homework, now it's time to,\nto actually get to work.\n\n226\n00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:26,600\nNow.\n>> Now.\n\n227\n00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,110\n>> Oh sorry, go ahead.\n\n228\n00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:27,630\n>> Yeah.\n\n229\n00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,870\nThere's a lot of times though,\n\n230\n00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:32,830\nwhere what you have is not just, you're\nready to install the operating system, but\n\n231\n00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,700\nwhat if you have a previous\noperating system on your computer?\n\n232\n00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,605\nSo maybe you're running\nsomething like Windows XP,\n\n233\n00:11:37,605 --> 00:11:40,018\nmaybe you're running\nsome like Windows Vista.\n\n234\n00:11:40,018 --> 00:11:44,030\nOr maybe even Linux or another operating\nsystem, we might want to talk about\n\n235\n00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:48,250\ninstead of actually doing a, an install,\nwe might want to talk about an upgrade.\n\n236\n00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,511\n>> And upgrades are a lot more difficult\nbecause when you do a clean install,\n\n237\n00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:55,756\nWindows is just putting itself\non there and it's done.\n\n238\n00:11:55,756 --> 00:12:00,812\nBut when you do an upgrade, Windows is\ngoing to try and collect your data and\n\n239\n00:12:00,812 --> 00:12:04,923\nyour settings from the old OS and\nbring them into Windows 7.\n\n240\n00:12:04,923 --> 00:12:07,783\nSo that Windows 7 is now configured\nexactly the way you want it and\n\n241\n00:12:07,783 --> 00:12:09,390\nall of your data is there.\n\n242\n00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:14,095\nBut, Microsoft doesn't know exactly how\nyou used your computer before, and so\n\n243\n00:12:14,095 --> 00:12:17,365\nit's having to try and figure that out,\nand it takes a lot of work, and\n\n244\n00:12:17,365 --> 00:12:19,835\nit's not a perfect process.\n\n245\n00:12:19,835 --> 00:12:23,265\nIt's not uncommon to lose some data or\nhave some settings not carry over.\n\n246\n00:12:23,265 --> 00:12:27,895\nVarious problems can occur because\neverybody uses their systems differently.\n\n247\n00:12:27,895 --> 00:12:30,673\nSo it's not a,\nnot a perfect process by any means.\n\n248\n00:12:30,673 --> 00:12:36,148\nSo, Microsoft has some well-defined rules\nwhen it comes to upgrades, they will only\n\n249\n00:12:36,148 --> 00:12:41,174\nsupport upgrades for certain scenarios,\nand they publish those on a web page.\n\n250\n00:12:41,174 --> 00:12:45,804\nLet me see, I think I've got that pulled\nup around here somewhere right here,\n\n251\n00:12:45,804 --> 00:12:47,540\nthe Windows 7 upgrade paths.\n\n252\n00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,830\nAnd they start right off at the beginning\njust by listing what's not supported.\n\n253\n00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:56,090\nSo here are some upgrades\nthat they do not support.\n\n254\n00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:59,730\n>> You know, if you're running a really\nold operating system like Window 95,\n\n255\n00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:00,450\nWindows 98.\n\n256\n00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,810\nYou're not gonna be a able to\ndirectly upgrade to Windows 7,\n\n257\n00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,010\nis, is what we're actually seeing.\n\n258\n00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,550\nSo, they don't want you to be able\nto add in older components like that\n\n259\n00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,460\nonto our newer operating system.\n\n260\n00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,250\n>> And, and not even that old,\nnecessarily.\n\n261\n00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:12,881\nWell I guess I shouldn't say.\n\n262\n00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:14,006\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Oh yeah, Windows XP.\n\n263\n00:13:14,006 --> 00:13:15,803\nWindows XP is like 15 years old now.\n\n264\n00:13:15,803 --> 00:13:19,700\n>> Yeah.\n>> So some of these are, are pretty old\n\n265\n00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,760\nOS's even though they might still be\nin general use out there in the public.\n\n266\n00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,040\nThere's plenty of people still\nrunning Windows XP right now.\n\n267\n00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,780\nBut it even goes beyond that.\n\n268\n00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,700\nLike, notice Windows Vista.\n\n269\n00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,600\nWindows Vista was the last version\nof Windows before Windows 7, and\n\n270\n00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,920\nright here, it's telling me it doesn't\nsupport upgrading from Windows Vista.\n\n271\n00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,990\nWell what, what the heck does it\nsupport upgrading from, right?\n\n272\n00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,210\n>> Well, pay attention to the note\nafter it, where it says RTM.\n\n273\n00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,180\nThat means release to manufacture.\n\n274\n00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,650\nThat's the original\nversion of Windows Vista.\n\n275\n00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:50,080\nIf you want to upgrade from\nWindows Vista to Windows 7,\n\n276\n00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,225\nwhat they're telling you here is,\nyou need to do your Windows updates.\n\n277\n00:13:54,225 --> 00:13:58,305\nYou need to be running at least\nWindows Vista Service Pack 1.\n\n278\n00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:01,435\nIf you're running Service Pack One,\nthen you can upgrade to Windows 7.\n\n279\n00:14:01,435 --> 00:14:06,570\nSo they're very specific in some cases\nwhere an upgrade might not be possible.\n\n280\n00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,260\nRight?\n\n281\n00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,870\nNow, other things like cross\narchitecture upgrades.\n\n282\n00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,420\nWhat is that?\n\n283\n00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:17,940\nWell, if my old system was 32-bit and\nmy new system is 64-bit, it can't upgrade.\n\n284\n00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,180\nOr the opposite,\n64-bit going down to 32-bit.\n\n285\n00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,520\nIt can't do that either.\n\n286\n00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,640\nSo you need to stay within the same\narchitecture when you upgrade.\n\n287\n00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,640\nSame thing with cross-languages.\n\n288\n00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,100\nIf your old system was in German, your\nnew system needs to be in German too, for\n\n289\n00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,173\nit to do the upgrade,\notherwise it's not gonna work.\n\n290\n00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:35,469\n>> Yeah, they even show some,\nsome other things,\n\n291\n00:14:35,469 --> 00:14:38,437\nthat we're probably not be\nconcerned about as a home user, but\n\n292\n00:14:38,437 --> 00:14:41,970\nmaybe as a business user are,\nyou are, such as those SKU upgrades.\n\n293\n00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,640\nNotice when you're trying to go\nfrom one version to another one,\n\n294\n00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,220\nusually this means from, well,\nreally, one country to another.\n\n295\n00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,322\nA lot of times you see that K and\nthe N additions.\n\n296\n00:14:51,322 --> 00:14:54,382\nThose are, are what you tend\nto find in other countries.\n\n297\n00:14:54,382 --> 00:14:59,041\n>> Yeah, and those, those little name,\nletters, or whatever they have,\n\n298\n00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,215\nthose are the ones.\n\n299\n00:15:00,215 --> 00:15:04,555\nRemember, I think I mentioned in\nthe other episode where in Europe,\n\n300\n00:15:04,555 --> 00:15:07,985\nWindows 7 is distributed\nwithout Internet Explore, and\n\n301\n00:15:07,985 --> 00:15:11,220\nthey identify that by calling\nit Windows 7 N, right?\n\n302\n00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,835\nWhich the, the joke was that was,\nyou know, no Internet Explorer.\n\n303\n00:15:13,835 --> 00:15:14,360\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n304\n00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,970\n>> And then Windows 7K,\nthat was the one that left off\n\n305\n00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,740\nWindows Media Player cuz there\nwas a dispute about that, too.\n\n306\n00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,870\nSo, some of them may or\nmay not include those tools.\n\n307\n00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,990\nAnd they're just saying that\nyou can't cross between them\n\n308\n00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,640\nto add in that support if you want,\nthey don't allow that.\n\n309\n00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,880\nAll right, but beneath that,\nwe get what is supported.\n\n310\n00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,230\nSo here's the upgrade\nscenarios they allow.\n\n311\n00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,490\nIf you're running Windows Vista\nwith Service Pack 1 or\n\n312\n00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:38,940\nService Pack 2,\nyou can upgrade to Windows 7, no problem.\n\n313\n00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,548\nBut, pay attention to what\nedition you are running.\n\n314\n00:15:41,548 --> 00:15:45,724\nIf you're running Windows 7 Business,\nyou can upgrade to Window, I mean,\n\n315\n00:15:45,724 --> 00:15:50,029\nif you're running Windows Vista Business,\nyou can upgrade to Windows 7 Pro,\n\n316\n00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:51,465\nEnterprise or Ultimate.\n\n317\n00:15:51,465 --> 00:15:55,830\nYou can't upgrade to Windows 7 Home or\nHome Premium, right?\n\n318\n00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,736\nSo you gotta upgrade to one\nof the business versions.\n\n319\n00:15:57,736 --> 00:16:02,243\nNow that, that is kind of common down the\nline, if we were running Vista Home Basic,\n\n320\n00:16:02,243 --> 00:16:06,829\nor Vista Home Premium We can't upgrade to\nWindows 7 Pro, or Windows 7 Enterprise.\n\n321\n00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:09,366\nWe can only upgrade to the home versions.\n\n322\n00:16:12,662 --> 00:16:16,077\nAll right, so, that's kind of consistent\nas it runs down the line the various\n\n323\n00:16:16,077 --> 00:16:17,440\nupgrade pads that we've got.\n\n324\n00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,480\nAnd they also show some little\nthings here at the end.\n\n325\n00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,330\nLike, if you bought Home Premium, so,\nyou're running Windows 7 Home Premium, and\n\n326\n00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:28,640\nyou decide you need to step up\nto Professional or Ultimate.\n\n327\n00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,630\nWell, they actually do\nlet you do that upgrade.\n\n328\n00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,690\nAnd it's not a true upgrade.\n\n329\n00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,340\nYou're really just changing your\nlicense key, and it will update and\n\n330\n00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,220\nadd the features.\n\n331\n00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:40,310\nSo, this is Windows 7 to Windows 7,\nand that's just the anytime upgrade so\n\n332\n00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,440\nyou can move up to the higher\ntier if you need to.\n\n333\n00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,840\nSo, these are all different\nsupported upgrade paths.\n\n334\n00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,330\nNow, if your system meets\nthose requirements,\n\n335\n00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,830\nlet's say I'm running\nVista Service Pack 1.\n\n336\n00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,680\nAll I have to do is sit down\nat my Windows Vista machine,\n\n337\n00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,900\ntake my brand new shiny Windows 7 DVD,\nand pop it in the computer.\n\n338\n00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,860\nAnd it's gonna launch the upgrade wizard.\n\n339\n00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,120\nAnd it'll walk through a very simple\nwizard, and perform that upgrade.\n\n340\n00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,680\nBut, one of the first things it's gonna\nrecommend doing is running what's called\n\n341\n00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,320\nthe Upgrade Advisor.\n\n342\n00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,580\nSo, let's talk about that for a moment.\n\n343\n00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:14,050\n>> The Upgrade Advisor is a small piece\nof software that we can download from\n\n344\n00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:19,010\nMicrosoft, and it can run on your\nmachine to check and see whether or\n\n345\n00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:23,030\nnot your system is ready to\nactually upgrade to Windows 7.\n\n346\n00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,805\nSo, the nice thing is, it's free.\n\n347\n00:17:24,805 --> 00:17:26,430\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You can go to the Microsoft site,\n\n348\n00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,350\ndownload it.\n\n349\n00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,835\nAnd let it run.\n\n350\n00:17:28,835 --> 00:17:32,130\n>> And if you already bought Windows 7,\nit's right there on the DVD.\n\n351\n00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,130\nSo you can run it.\n\n352\n00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,042\nBut, if you're trying\nto make the decision,\n\n353\n00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:37,460\nyou don't wanna buy Windows\n7 just to see if it'll work.\n\n354\n00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,160\nSo, you go to Microsoft's website and\ndownload it.\n\n355\n00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,530\nWe'll post a link in the show notes.\n\n356\n00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,630\nBut, you go an download it.\n\n357\n00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,980\nYou run it on your computer.\n\n358\n00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,940\nIt'll check the minimum requirements,\nso it'll check your hardware.\n\n359\n00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,790\nIt will check what operating system\nyou're running, and whether or\n\n360\n00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,040\nnot it matches the upgrade path.\n\n361\n00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,290\nSo, you don't even have\nto know the upgrade path.\n\n362\n00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:57,600\nBut, it also goes a step further, and\nlooks at the programs that you run.\n\n363\n00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,820\nYou might have some software that\nis not compatible with Windows 7,\n\n364\n00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,700\nand it'll let you know.\n\n365\n00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,980\nNormally, the problem\ncenters around drivers.\n\n366\n00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,390\nYou might have some drivers that\nare not compatible with Windows 7.\n\n367\n00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,460\nAnd it'll warn you about that.\n\n368\n00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,840\nAnd usually give you links to the\nmanufacturer's website for that hardware,\n\n369\n00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,910\nto be able to download the new drivers.\n\n370\n00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,190\nSo, really useful utility.\n\n371\n00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:17,690\n>> Yeah.\n\n372\n00:18:19,088 --> 00:18:21,730\nAll right, now, if we go that route,\nif we're gonna be going and\n\n373\n00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:26,280\ndoing our update and we start to bump\ninto software that's not compatible.\n\n374\n00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,290\nWell, we gotta find some\nkind of action to take.\n\n375\n00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:33,100\nAnd maybe there's new software\nwe can update too to fix that.\n\n376\n00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,930\nBut, identifying that software\ncan be really challenging,\n\n377\n00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:39,210\nespecially if you've got hundreds or\nthousands of machines,\n\n378\n00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:43,140\nand you don't know what software\nis running on each one.\n\n379\n00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,070\nSo, Microsoft actually puts out a list,\nthey have this,\n\n380\n00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,870\nthis application compatibility, well,\n\n381\n00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:50,460\nthey call the Windows-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n382\n00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,490\n>> Application compatibility list for\n\n383\n00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:53,540\nIT professionals.\n\n384\n00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,155\nIt's a mouthful.\n\n385\n00:18:54,155 --> 00:18:55,135\n>> Hm.\n\n386\n00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,905\n>> And let me just show that to you guys.\n\n387\n00:18:56,905 --> 00:18:58,575\nHere I'm gonna pull up the page.\n\n388\n00:18:58,575 --> 00:19:00,675\nAnd what they do is they\npublish this list, and\n\n389\n00:19:00,675 --> 00:19:03,975\nit shows information about\nWindows 7 compatibility.\n\n390\n00:19:03,975 --> 00:19:06,927\nAnd they've actually added\nWindows 8 stuff in there too.\n\n391\n00:19:06,927 --> 00:19:09,927\nBecause, you know,\nthat's the current operating system.\n\n392\n00:19:09,927 --> 00:19:14,617\nBut, it's just a little Excel\nspreadsheet you can download and\n\n393\n00:19:14,617 --> 00:19:17,177\nyou can take a look at it\nin Excel if you've got it.\n\n394\n00:19:17,177 --> 00:19:22,403\nOr if you don't have Excel, you can always\nget the Excel viewer and pull it up there.\n\n395\n00:19:22,403 --> 00:19:23,913\nBut, you can take a look at this, and\n\n396\n00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:28,713\nit will show you all of the different\napplications that are out there.\n\n397\n00:19:28,713 --> 00:19:32,523\nThere are over 60,000\napplications in this spreadsheet.\n\n398\n00:19:32,523 --> 00:19:38,130\nSo, whenever it actually comes up for\nme here, we can see this application list.\n\n399\n00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:42,120\nAnd just about anything you\ncan think of is in here.\n\n400\n00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,478\nAnd it is, it's really kind of impressive.\n\n401\n00:19:44,478 --> 00:19:48,360\nLet me just, try to make this\nwhere you can kind of read it.\n\n402\n00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,160\nSo you get your application name,\nfollowed by the major and minor version,\n\n403\n00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,000\nthe company and their home page.\n\n404\n00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,900\nAnd on the right side, it actually tells\nus what the compatibility status is.\n\n405\n00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:03,410\nSo, is it compatible with 32-bit Windows\n7, 64-bit Windows 7, 32-bit Windows 8,\n\n406\n00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,520\n64-bit Windows 8?\n\n407\n00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,970\nAnd you can look down the list and\nfind it.\n\n408\n00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,120\nSo, Ronnie,\nwhat's some software we can check?\n\n409\n00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,096\n>> I don't even think. [CROSSTALK] >>\nLet's think of something that I enjoy.\n\n410\n00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:17,621\nSo-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n411\n00:20:17,621 --> 00:20:18,623\n>> You know, it is hard to think of\n\n412\n00:20:18,623 --> 00:20:19,750\nsoftware on the spot, isn't it?\n\n413\n00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,552\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n414\n00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,039\n>> So, I use Jump Desktop.\n\n415\n00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:22,794\nRight.\n>> Yeah.\n\n416\n00:20:22,794 --> 00:20:25,615\n>> So, let's see if Jump Desktop turns up.\n\n417\n00:20:25,615 --> 00:20:26,602\n>> Oh, yeah that's a good one.\n\n418\n00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:31,388\n>> And it's gonna search inside it.\n\n419\n00:20:31,388 --> 00:20:32,571\nSo, let me just get down to the Js.\n\n420\n00:20:32,571 --> 00:20:34,407\nThere can't be that much\nsoftware that starts with J.\n\n421\n00:20:34,407 --> 00:20:36,101\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we'll go down here.\n\n422\n00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:36,986\nThere's Jewel Quest.\n\n423\n00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:37,694\nThat's important.\n\n424\n00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:38,309\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n425\n00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:39,772\n>> Gotta make sure we\nhave our Jewel Quest.\n\n426\n00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:43,740\nSo, I can look in here and\nhopefully it's in the list.\n\n427\n00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,290\nThere it is Jump Desktop.\n\n428\n00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,680\nSo here's Jump Desktop.\n\n429\n00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,080\nIt's a little remote connection\nsoftware that I like to use.\n\n430\n00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,809\nAnd, so I can come in here, and I can see\nthat they've tested up to version 3.2.\n\n431\n00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:57,000\nThere, there might new\nversions since then, but\n\n432\n00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,970\nthis is what they've tested up to.\n\n433\n00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,640\nAnd if we start to scroll over,\nwe can see the compatibility.\n\n434\n00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,380\nAnd-\n>> [LAUGH] Unknown.\n\n435\n00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,650\n>> Well, that's convenient.\n\n436\n00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,720\nSo for\nWindows 7 it's listed as unknown, for\n\n437\n00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,120\nWindows 8 it's compatible, though-\n>> Yeah.\n\n438\n00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,750\n>> So we know we're good on Windows 8.\n\n439\n00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:14,310\nSo now, I get an idea of if I'm going\nto Windows 7, I need to test it.\n\n440\n00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:18,630\nNow, when you look you may see unknown,\nright?\n\n441\n00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,860\nWhich means you gotta\ndo your own research.\n\n442\n00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,880\nCompatible which means it works, but\n\n443\n00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,620\nMicrosoft hasn't actually approved it\nthemselves, or you'll see non compatible.\n\n444\n00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,280\nWhich I don't really see any of those,\noh, actually there's one right there,\n\n445\n00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,020\nnot compatible.\n\n446\n00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,274\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, that just means it's\n\n447\n00:21:34,274 --> 00:21:35,260\nnot gonna work.\n\n448\n00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,560\nBut, sometimes you'll see logo certified,\nwhat's that all about?\n\n449\n00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:43,330\nWell that means that, whoever wrote this\nsoftware submitted it to Microsoft for\n\n450\n00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:45,080\nextensive testing.\n\n451\n00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:49,840\nSo, not only is it compatible, but\nMicrosoft themselves tested it and\n\n452\n00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,200\nsaid it works great.\n\n453\n00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,930\nSo when you see logo certified, that's the\nbest possible answer that you can find.\n\n454\n00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,990\nAll right, so that's all stuff that's\ninvolved with going and testing for\n\n455\n00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:01,920\nan upgrade like that.\n\n456\n00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,740\nAnd verifying whether or not,\nyour software is gonna be ready.\n\n457\n00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:09,680\nNow, for the exam we need to\nbe aware of those concepts.\n\n458\n00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,750\nThey don't actually expect\nyou to do the install, but\n\n459\n00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:15,700\nI know some of you are thinking\ngee shouldn't we see the install?\n\n460\n00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,630\nWell, what I encourage you to do is\nto jump over to our Windows 7 show,\n\n461\n00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,760\nthe 70-687 exam show.\n\n462\n00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,640\nIt's an MCSA exam, but\ndon't worry about that.\n\n463\n00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:31,040\nBut in the first couple of episodes, we\nshow doing a full Windows 7 installation.\n\n464\n00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,380\nWe do an upgrade, so we upgrade a machine\nfrom Windows Vista to Windows 7.\n\n465\n00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,480\nSo, you get a chance to see\nthat process right there, and\n\n466\n00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,570\nyou can actually go\nthrough it step-by-step.\n\n467\n00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:42,300\nRemember, all the shows are part\nof your IT Pro TV subscription,\n\n468\n00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,280\nso just jump on over and check those out.\n\n469\n00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,540\nBut for this exam, what we need to\nremember are simply things like\n\n470\n00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:52,050\nthe minimum requirements for\ngetting Windows 7 installed.\n\n471\n00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:56,520\nAnd the upgrade paths that Windows Vista\nservice pack 1 and service pack 2,\n\n472\n00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,580\ncan be upgraded to Windows 7, pretty much\neverything behind that can't be, right?\n\n473\n00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,782\nThat's our main upgrade path.\n\n474\n00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:07,830\nAll right, some of the other things,\nwhat's next?\n\n475\n00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,490\nInstallation types.\n\n476\n00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,020\n>> Right.\nYep.\n\n477\n00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,330\nWe're taking a look at now understanding\nsome of the different ways that we can\n\n478\n00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,820\ninstall Windows 7.\n\n479\n00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,570\nMost of us are probably familiar,\n\n480\n00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,590\nif you've tried to install\nan operating system before.\n\n481\n00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:23,550\nYou use to go to the store buy the\noperating system take it out of the box\n\n482\n00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:27,282\nput it in the DVD player, and\nlet it run and just follow the directions.\n\n483\n00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:31,295\nBut there's more types then that for\nus to actually just install Windows\n\n484\n00:23:31,295 --> 00:23:34,205\n7 the depending on the situation\nthat you are in, so we're gonna\n\n485\n00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:37,065\ntalk about some of the different\ntypes that are actually available.\n\n486\n00:23:37,065 --> 00:23:39,227\nNow the DVD installer\nis still there right,\n\n487\n00:23:39,227 --> 00:23:45,635\nWindows 7 in fact it there used to\nbe CD versions of like Windows XP,\n\n488\n00:23:45,635 --> 00:23:49,345\nbut starting with Windows Vista it got so\nlarge it wouldn't fit on a CD anymore.\n\n489\n00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:52,120\nSo, DVD is the smallest\nmedia you can get now.\n\n490\n00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,941\n>> And, the Windows 7 DVD Installer,\n\n491\n00:23:53,941 --> 00:23:57,715\nis still considered by Microsoft to be\nthe official way to install Windows.\n\n492\n00:23:57,715 --> 00:24:00,802\nSo you have that disk that\nyou pop in the computer.\n\n493\n00:24:00,802 --> 00:24:04,358\nAll right, but,\nwhat if you have a computer?\n\n494\n00:24:04,358 --> 00:24:07,098\nIt doesn't have a DVD drive, right?\n\n495\n00:24:07,098 --> 00:24:09,780\nWell Ronnie, your laptop-\n>> Yep.\n\n496\n00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,410\n>> My laptop, for that matter,\nneither of us have DVD drives.\n\n497\n00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,670\n>> Yep.\n>> We don't even have a CD drives.\n\n498\n00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:16,120\nThere's no optical media in our computers.\n\n499\n00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,440\nSo how do you install Windows on\na machine that doesn't even have a drive?\n\n500\n00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,430\nWell, Microsoft supports a USB installer.\n\n501\n00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:26,870\nSo you can take a USB thumb drive,\nright, a little memory stick.\n\n502\n00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:30,660\nAnd you can actually put\nthe Windows 7 installer on there.\n\n503\n00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,900\nAnd boot your computer up off\nthat memory stick to install it.\n\n504\n00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,710\nAnd I don't think you did that Ronnie.\n\n505\n00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:36,990\n>> No.\n>> But I know I did that with mine.\n\n506\n00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:40,430\nAnd so it's you know, it's something\nthat's pretty easy to do and\n\n507\n00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:44,920\nyou can get things installed usually\nfaster than a DVD or CD drive, right?\n\n508\n00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,860\nUSB media is usually a lot faster.\n\n509\n00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,450\n>> Now even though USB media is fast Don,\n\n510\n00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,420\nthe very fact that is if I end\nup working in the company.\n\n511\n00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:55,211\nWhat if I have like 30, or\nwhat if I have 100 or 1,000 computers,.\n\n512\n00:24:55,211 --> 00:24:56,310\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Are you gonna\n\n513\n00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:59,090\ntake on that USB queued out or\nall 1000 of those?\n\n514\n00:24:59,090 --> 00:24:59,770\n>> Well, we could.\n\n515\n00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:00,470\n>> Yeah, we can.\n[LAUGH]\n\n516\n00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,210\n>> If we're an hourly employee that\n\n517\n00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,210\nis the way to do it right.\n\n518\n00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,888\nThat's going to give you job security.\n\n519\n00:25:04,888 --> 00:25:05,580\nBut, [LAUGH] But\n\n520\n00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,160\nif you're a salaried employee you\ndefinitely don't want to mess with that.\n\n521\n00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,120\nSo, we need automated ways\nto deploy Windows and\n\n522\n00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,170\nthat's the third installation that\nwhich is installing over the network.\n\n523\n00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:18,080\nIf your computers are networked together,\n\n524\n00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,300\nyou can actually have your computer\nboot up off of its network connection.\n\n525\n00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,670\nIt can find an installation\nserver on the network and\n\n526\n00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:27,930\nautomatically install\nWindows on your new machine.\n\n527\n00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,700\nNow there's two different\nvariations of this.\n\n528\n00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,500\nThere's LTI and ZTI.\n\n529\n00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,605\nZTI is like the holy grail\nof enterprise computing.\n\n530\n00:25:35,605 --> 00:25:39,010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It stands for zero touch install.\n\n531\n00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:42,710\nYou get a new computer,\nyou plug its network cable in, and\n\n532\n00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,420\nyou push the power button.\n\n533\n00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,510\nAnd when it boots up, zero touch.\n\n534\n00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,860\nYou don't have to touch anything.\n\n535\n00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,950\nIt just automatically starts\ninstalling Windows 7.\n\n536\n00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:52,730\nIt has all the line of business\napplications on there.\n\n537\n00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:53,710\nThe computer boots up.\n\n538\n00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,350\nJoined your domain,\nhas your user accounts ready to go.\n\n539\n00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,760\nYou didn't have to touch a thing.\n\n540\n00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,530\nAlright.\n\n541\n00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,950\nIt takes a lot of planning and\n\n542\n00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:05,360\ninfrastructure to build\na technology like that.\n\n543\n00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,881\nAnd so, Microsoft has these entire\nsoftware suites that are dedicated to\n\n544\n00:26:08,881 --> 00:26:10,710\nmaking that dream possible.\n\n545\n00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,210\nSo, for an enterprise, that's very real.\n\n546\n00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:16,820\nRight, a lot of enterprises do that,\nthey have that exact type set up.\n\n547\n00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,940\nBut if you're a smaller organization\nlike us, here like Spread TV, we have,\n\n548\n00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:23,700\nwe have well over 100,\nwe have over 200 computers here.\n\n549\n00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,570\n>> I think right under 200.\n\n550\n00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,090\n>> Okay, so\nwe're getting close to that part,\n\n551\n00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:31,430\nwe've got a lot of computers and\na lot of them we erase pretty frequently,\n\n552\n00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:34,040\nevery few weeks to keep them nice and\nclean.\n\n553\n00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,270\nAnd for that,\nit'd be nice if it was zero touch, but\n\n554\n00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,550\nwe don't want that infrastructure.\n\n555\n00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:42,460\nIt's such a maintenance burden for\njust a little under 200 machines.\n\n556\n00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:47,020\nSo instead we do the LTID,\nlight touch installation.\n\n557\n00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:50,280\nIf we want to install window\n7 on one of our machines,\n\n558\n00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,930\nany one of our techs can walk\nover to a machine and reboot it.\n\n559\n00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:54,660\nAnd when they boot it,\n\n560\n00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,970\nthey can hit a little hotkey on their\ncomputer to boot off the network.\n\n561\n00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:01,820\nAnd it will ask them to pick,\nhey, what do you wanna do?\n\n562\n00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:05,190\nInstall Windows 7, install Windows 8,\nwe have a couple of different choices.\n\n563\n00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:08,200\nAnd they pick one, and\nthey start the install.\n\n564\n00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,750\nIt's not automatic.\n\n565\n00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,240\nIt's a light touch installation.\n\n566\n00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,030\nThey have to do just a couple\nof clicks to get it going.\n\n567\n00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:19,530\nSo they can run into a room and move\naround the 20 computers in that one room,\n\n568\n00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,440\ntakes about ten minutes\nto walk around the room,\n\n569\n00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,640\nand then all those machines\nare installing Windows 7, and\n\n570\n00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,940\nabout an hour or later, they're all done,\nfresh and clean, ready to be used.\n\n571\n00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,300\nIt's a neat setup.\n\n572\n00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,160\n>> Yeah.\n\n573\n00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,600\n>> But it does take a lot of planning and\ninfrastructure and for those of you who\n\n574\n00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,000\nare interested in learning how to do that,\nyou should definitely check out\n\n575\n00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,650\nour Windows server, actually did we\ndo that in the workstation show?\n\n576\n00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,690\n>> We do some of it,\nwe still haven't touched.\n\n577\n00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,720\n>> But that we do the bulk\nof it in the server shows.\n\n578\n00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,310\nIf you jump into, like, the Windows Server\n2012 shows, we cover WDS,\n\n579\n00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,720\nWindows Deployment Services.\n\n580\n00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,280\nAnd that's a key piece of\ndoing a light touch install.\n\n581\n00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,620\nAnd if you wanna learn about ZTI,\n\n582\n00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:01,420\nZero Touch, that's a part of Microsoft\nSystems Center Configuration Manager,\n\n583\n00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:05,910\nSCCM, that product is what makes\nzero touch installs possible.\n\n584\n00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:09,760\nAnd we don't have a show on that one yet\nbecause it's really specialized for\n\n585\n00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,370\nlarge companies.\n\n586\n00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,440\nAnd it is huge.\n\n587\n00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,310\nBut it is a neat one.\n\n588\n00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,690\nI know we talked about SCCM and\n\n589\n00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:21,510\ndemonstrated a little bit in the 414\nthe last of the MCSEE shows,\n\n590\n00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:25,280\nso at the high end of Microsoft, that's\nwhere we start to cover that a little bit,\n\n591\n00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,690\nso, just be aware that those\ntechnologies are out there.\n\n592\n00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:34,295\nFor most of us, it's gonna be a DVD or\na USB key that we install from.\n\n593\n00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:37,670\n>> Yeah.Once we install the operating\nsystem, we're not completely done yet.\n\n594\n00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:41,630\nWe still have to go through the process\n\n595\n00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:45,000\nof adding in a little bit of information\nwhen we're doing light touch, but\n\n596\n00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,270\na key element of that is what we\ncall the product key information.\n\n597\n00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,810\n>> Yeah.\nWhenever you install Windows 7,\n\n598\n00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:53,550\njust to get through the installer,\nyou have to put in a product key.\n\n599\n00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:58,200\nNow the product key is\na 25 character string.\n\n600\n00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,610\nAnd it's basically\nidentifying your license.\n\n601\n00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,640\nRight.\nYour, your ability to install it.\n\n602\n00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,980\nWhen you buy a computer that has\nWindows pre-installed, you know, that,\n\n603\n00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:10,310\nthat comes with the system, then you\nshould actually be able to find that 25\n\n604\n00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:13,530\ncharacter key on a sticker on the case.\n\n605\n00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:17,210\nYou can look on the case on your,\nyour laptop or desktop and find it.\n\n606\n00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:19,820\nSo, Ronnie, on yours,\nyours is hidden, isn't it?\n\n607\n00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,500\nIt's,\n>> Yep.\n\n608\n00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,870\nIt's underneath the flap, yep,\non, on the bottom of the, laptop.\n\n609\n00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:28,410\nSo there's a metal cover, and if I open it\nup it looks like a little certificate has\n\n610\n00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:34,250\nwhat looks like a barcode a a little\n25 alpha-numeric number underneath it.\n\n611\n00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:37,441\n>> And on a desktop,\nit's normally a lot easier to find.\n\n612\n00:29:37,441 --> 00:29:38,810\n>> Yeah.\n>> It might be stuck on the top of he\n\n613\n00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:39,880\ndesktop, or on the side.\n\n614\n00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,160\nIt might even be on the back.\n\n615\n00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:46,100\nYou know, it'll just kind of be\nsomewhere where you can spot it.\n\n616\n00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,630\nAnd, I here I'm pulling up,\nlike, a Google image search so\n\n617\n00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,200\npeople can see what they look like.\n\n618\n00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,880\nThis is what the stickers look like and\nthey can vary based on when you bought\n\n619\n00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,580\nthem or where bought them, but\nthis is a pretty good example.\n\n620\n00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,355\nHere's Windows 7 Home Premium.\n\n621\n00:29:58,355 --> 00:29:58,900\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n622\n00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,240\n>> And see how it's got the product\nkey would normally be right here.\n\n623\n00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,190\nThey've x'd it out because, well,\n\n624\n00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:05,700\nyou don't wanna put your\nproduct key on the Internet.\n\n625\n00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,840\nAnd they've kinda done\nthe same thing here.\n\n626\n00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,660\nThe key would be listed right there.\n\n627\n00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,590\nSo that's what those stickers look like.\n\n628\n00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:14,550\nThese where it looks all torn up,\nthat's not torn up.\n\n629\n00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,760\nIt didn't go through the wash.\n\n630\n00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,090\nIt's got these copy protection\nmechanisms built into it.\n\n631\n00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:22,990\nAnd it makes it where it is\nvery hard to duplicate these.\n\n632\n00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,295\nA lot of them have holograms\nbuilt into them too.\n\n633\n00:30:26,295 --> 00:30:29,365\nSo depending on the angle of it, you might\nsee little patterns underneath that.\n\n634\n00:30:29,365 --> 00:30:32,225\nIf you want to see what a product\nkey actually looks like though,\n\n635\n00:30:32,225 --> 00:30:36,235\nMicrosoft publishes a collection\nof them for remote deployment.\n\n636\n00:30:36,235 --> 00:30:38,670\nAnd do they still publish\nthe Windows 7 ones?\n\n637\n00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,125\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Yea, right here.\n\n638\n00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:47,625\nSo here's a whole collection of Windows\n7 ones that that you can see in.\n\n639\n00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:49,465\nYou know they don't give me\nthe ability to scroll over, but\n\n640\n00:30:49,465 --> 00:30:51,290\nyou can see the bulk of them here.\n\n641\n00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:56,000\nSo like, for Windows 7 Professional,\nEnterprise, they look the same.\n\n642\n00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,250\nThey're all 25 characters\nseparated by hyphens, but\n\n643\n00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:03,370\nencoded in that somehow is\nwhat edition this is for.\n\n644\n00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:06,400\nThis one is for Windows 7 Professional and\nthis one down here is for\n\n645\n00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,340\nWindows 7 Enterprise and so on.\n\n646\n00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,480\nIt's related to that version.\n\n647\n00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,970\nSo when you install Windows 7,\nit's gonna ask you for that key.\n\n648\n00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:17,490\nYou gotta put it in, and once you put\nthe key in that's not enough, right?\n\n649\n00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,950\nOnce Windows 7 boots up the first time\n\n650\n00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:25,150\nit's gonna want to reach out to\nMicrosoft and say, \"is this key valid?\".\n\n651\n00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:28,090\nThat way you can't just go in and use the\nsame key on a thousand machines, right?\n\n652\n00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:30,060\nYou gotta, you gotta pay for\nyour licenses.\n\n653\n00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:33,780\nSo, if you were to use one of these keys\nthat I'm showing onscreen right now,\n\n654\n00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:36,600\nthese are already invalidated\nin Microsoft system.\n\n655\n00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:41,140\nThese are enough to get the install\ndone but you can't actually run with it.\n\n656\n00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:44,570\nAfter about three days these will stop\nworking and your machine will stop.\n\n657\n00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,770\nSo the idea is that you\ninstall using the key,\n\n658\n00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:49,310\nand then within three days you\nchange it to your real key.\n\n659\n00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:52,430\nThese are designed just to be\nlike dummy keys that you can use.\n\n660\n00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:54,200\nSo that's kinda how these keys work.\n\n661\n00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,300\nThey are important, and\nyou should keep them safe.\n\n662\n00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,490\nRight, don't put them on\nthe internet like these.\n\n663\n00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:01,720\nBecause, people will use them and\nyou won't be able to activate anymore.\n\n664\n00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,469\nAnd that's a big problem.\n\n665\n00:32:02,469 --> 00:32:05,461\n>> Yeah, when you do use a key,\nand you go ahead and install it.\n\n666\n00:32:05,461 --> 00:32:09,017\nWhat were talking about in this process,\nwhere it checks it is activation.\n\n667\n00:32:09,017 --> 00:32:11,569\nIt wants to check in with Microsoft and\nsay, hey is this valid?\n\n668\n00:32:11,569 --> 00:32:13,241\nMicrosoft will say, okay.\n\n669\n00:32:13,241 --> 00:32:15,065\nBut if you put it out\nthere on the Internet and\n\n670\n00:32:15,065 --> 00:32:18,171\nwithin five minutes I'm gonna assume\nyou're not gonna be able to actually\n\n671\n00:32:18,171 --> 00:32:21,916\ninstall that ever again, because multiple\npeople will probably have activated it as\n\n672\n00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:24,040\nmany times as they'll allow you to.\n\n673\n00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,440\nSo it really is about fighting you know,\nthe, the ability for\n\n674\n00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,715\nyou to put it on, on multiple machines,\nor hundreds of machines, I should say.\n\n675\n00:32:31,715 --> 00:32:32,830\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n676\n00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:35,690\n>> The product activation\nis very important.\n\n677\n00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:38,130\nSo much so that even if you\nentered in the product key and\n\n678\n00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:42,340\nyou don't activate it's gonna tell\nyou you've got 30 days to activate.\n\n679\n00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:46,630\nAfter if you don't activate it, you're\ngonna see warnings on the desktop itself,\n\n680\n00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:50,980\nit's gonna tell you, hey, you haven't\nactivated it, you need to do it now, and\n\n681\n00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:55,260\nif you don't, you may find some, some,\nI don't want to say complete loss but\n\n682\n00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:59,260\nyou may, there may be times when it\njust tells you, you didn't activate,\n\n683\n00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:02,060\ngo ahead and activate now or\nyou're not gonna be able to use it.\n\n684\n00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,348\n>> Yeah.\n\n685\n00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:06,380\nAll right, well that's enough\nabout product keys for now and\n\n686\n00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,565\nwe've shot way past our break time,\nso let's stop here and take a break.\n\n687\n00:33:09,565 --> 00:33:12,785\nWhen we get back, we've got another\nneat insulation method to talk about,\n\n688\n00:33:12,785 --> 00:33:14,085\nwhich is virtualization.\n\n689\n00:33:14,085 --> 00:33:17,063\nSo stay tuned,\nwe'll be back with that in just a moment.\n\n690\n00:33:17,063 --> 00:33:24,313\n[MUSIC]\n\n691\n00:33:24,313 --> 00:33:26,330\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n692\n00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:29,130\nSo the, the last installation method\nthat we're gonna talk about is\n\n693\n00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:32,150\none of my favorites because\nI use it all of the time.\n\n694\n00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:36,200\nAnd that's a virtualized\ninstall of Windows 7,\n\n695\n00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,170\nor really any OS for that matter.\n\n696\n00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:41,630\nNow, what are we talking about\nwhen we say, virtualize?\n\n697\n00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,450\nWell, normally when we're\ninstalling an operating system,\n\n698\n00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:47,350\nwe're installing on an actual hardware,\nand your hardware, your laptop,\n\n699\n00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:50,890\nyour desktop, or whatever, will\nprobably just run one operating system.\n\n700\n00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:56,970\nBut what if you wanna go to Windows 7 but\nyou have a program that's not compatible.\n\n701\n00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:57,710\nRight?\nYou've got this\n\n702\n00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:00,710\nprogram that works on Windows XP but\nnot on Windows 7.\n\n703\n00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:04,880\nWell, do you just say, all right, well,\nforget it, I'm not going to Windows 7?\n\n704\n00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,580\nNo, you can still go to Windows 7.\n\n705\n00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:11,610\nAnd what you can do is you can\nrun your older operating system\n\n706\n00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:15,020\nin a virtual machine, simulated hardware.\n\n707\n00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:18,420\nYou create a,\na fake computer effectively, and\n\n708\n00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,890\nyou run that older operating\nsystem inside of it.\n\n709\n00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:25,050\nNow your computer can be running\ntwo operating systems or even more.\n\n710\n00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:28,500\nSo you'd have Windows 7 running\non your actual hardware, and\n\n711\n00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:32,790\nthen you'd have other operating\nsystems running in virtual software,\n\n712\n00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:35,160\nallowing you to have\nthe best of both worlds.\n\n713\n00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,350\nThe reason I like this so\nmuch and, and Ronnie and\n\n714\n00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:42,690\nthe rest of the guys here in the studio,\nwe do so many shows on so many different\n\n715\n00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:47,660\noperating systems that I can't always\nhave that installed on my laptop.\n\n716\n00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:52,200\nSo I need to be able to switch between\noperating systems at any given time.\n\n717\n00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,280\nAnd I, I just do it out of hand.\n\n718\n00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,440\nI, I don't even think about it anymore and\nit, it does get a little confusing.\n\n719\n00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,240\nSo like let,\nlet me show you guys here on my laptop.\n\n720\n00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,460\nSo I've been running\nWindows 7 on the show.\n\n721\n00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:07,890\nAnd I wanted to have a nice\nclean install of Windows 7.\n\n722\n00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,140\nSo, that's what I did.\n\n723\n00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,200\nI brought up this fresh and clean install.\n\n724\n00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,530\nNow that kind of bit me in the butt,\nbecause it has a ton of windows updates to\n\n725\n00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:17,550\ndo, but but this one is clean\nhas no additional software.\n\n726\n00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,830\nWell, if my laptop were\nactually like that,\n\n727\n00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:22,340\nI wouldn't be able to share\nmy screen like I'm doing.\n\n728\n00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,470\nAnd I wouldn't be able to\nedit my show notes and\n\n729\n00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,620\nall the other things that I need to do.\n\n730\n00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:31,120\nSo this is just one of several\nvirtual machines that I run.\n\n731\n00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,850\nI've actually got another virtual\nmachine on here which is the one that is\n\n732\n00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:37,470\ntruly sharing my screen, but\nthe operating system under the hood,\n\n733\n00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:41,770\nI'm actually running, well there's\ntuck away back here somewhere.\n\n734\n00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:45,030\nI'm running Mac OS way\ndown buried under here, so\n\n735\n00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,895\nI'm actually running on an Apple computer.\n\n736\n00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:48,595\nThere we go.\n\n737\n00:35:48,595 --> 00:35:51,545\nIf I get far enough into the background\nthere is so much junk open.\n\n738\n00:35:51,545 --> 00:35:54,555\nSo, I'm running an Apple,\nand that way I can run both.\n\n739\n00:35:54,555 --> 00:35:58,385\nI can run Windows and\nMac OS all at the same time.\n\n740\n00:35:58,385 --> 00:36:00,175\nAnd I run more than one\nversion of Windows too.\n\n741\n00:36:00,175 --> 00:36:03,625\nIf I pull up my library, my Boot Camp,\n\n742\n00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:07,755\nmy other installs Windows 8, so\nI can flip between Windows 7, Windows 8,\n\n743\n00:36:07,755 --> 00:36:11,590\nMac OS, all just with, you know,\njust a couple of swipes.\n\n744\n00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:15,240\nThat's virtualization, now I'm doing\nit on Apple, you don't have to, right?\n\n745\n00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,690\nSo Ronnie you do it all the time right\non your laptop and you got Windows 8.\n\n746\n00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,820\n>> I do, I have Windows 8,\nand I have Windows 7.\n\n747\n00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,210\nSo, normally when I'm switching back and\nforth,\n\n748\n00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:26,110\nit's usually because we, we normally\nmight get somebody who calls in and\n\n749\n00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:29,840\nsays hey I'm running Windows 7 and I'm\nhaving this problem, can I test it out?\n\n750\n00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:33,630\nWell instead of me having to go and\nfind a Windows 7 machine,\n\n751\n00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:38,150\nI simply use my virtualization software,\nrun my Windows 7 and I try and\n\n752\n00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:41,680\nrecreate the exact problem to see\nif I have the exact same issue.\n\n753\n00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,290\nSo it really does help to,\nto make sure that\n\n754\n00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:47,570\nwe can run multiple operating systems and\nbe able to test with them.\n\n755\n00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:50,280\nAnd maybe even at some\npoint move that into a real\n\n756\n00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,360\nproduction environment when we need to.\n\n757\n00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:56,370\n>> Yeah now, most end users aren't ready\nto grasp the idea of virtualization.\n\n758\n00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:57,610\nAnd even if they are,\n\n759\n00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:00,970\ninstalling the virtualization\nsoftware can be a bit of a challenge.\n\n760\n00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,020\nI know,\nI use a product call VMware Fusion.\n\n761\n00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,970\nRon, you use.\n\n762\n00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:05,094\n>> Oracle Virtual Box.\n\n763\n00:37:05,094 --> 00:37:05,860\n>> Okay.\n\n764\n00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,420\nAnd there is several\nothers that are out there.\n\n765\n00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,990\nAnd Windows 8, you have Microsoft Hyper V.\n\n766\n00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:11,420\nSo, there's several different\nproducts you can use.\n\n767\n00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:14,860\nWell, in the Window 7 world Microsoft\nwanted to make that really easy.\n\n768\n00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,770\nWhere the end user didn't\nhave to worry about it.\n\n769\n00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:20,240\nSo, Microsoft created what\nwas called Windows XP mode.\n\n770\n00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,680\nAnd what it allowed you to\ndo is run Windows 7 as your\n\n771\n00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,750\noperating system on your computer.\n\n772\n00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:30,630\nAnd then you could run Windows XP as a\nhidden virtual machine in the background,\n\n773\n00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:35,390\nand that was called Windows XP mode, and\nMicrosoft actually no longer supports it.\n\n774\n00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:39,950\nThe support for it ended, but\nyou can still do it, and it's an exam\n\n775\n00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:44,400\nobjective which is kind of odd, but but\nit is there so we need to be aware of it.\n\n776\n00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,850\nTo use Windows XP mode,\nyou have to do two things.\n\n777\n00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:51,670\nFirst off, you have to be running\nWindows 7 is, is it just enterprise, or\n\n778\n00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:52,700\nis enterprise and professional?\n\n779\n00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,600\n>> It's enterprise.\n\n780\n00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,360\n>> Just enterprise.\n\n781\n00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:54,980\nAll right.\n\n782\n00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,560\nSo if you're running Windows 7 Home,\nor Pro,\n\n783\n00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,510\nor even Ultimate, Microsoft\ndoesn't support XP mode on those.\n\n784\n00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,190\nIt's just enterprise.\n\n785\n00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:01,840\nIt was designed for\n\n786\n00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,760\ntheir enterprise customers to be\nable to upgrade to Windows 7 faster.\n\n787\n00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,730\nAll right.\n\n788\n00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:09,310\nThen, you have to go to Microsoft's\nwebsite and download it.\n\n789\n00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:12,430\nIt's not included with\nthe base install of Windows 7.\n\n790\n00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:16,570\nSo I've got that webpage pulled up\nhere and this is the the page, and\n\n791\n00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:17,510\nwe'll post a link for it.\n\n792\n00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:20,520\nBut where you can go and\ndownload Windows XP mode.\n\n793\n00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,530\nAnd it's a pretty big download, it's I\nthink it's a little over a, gigabyte.\n\n794\n00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:25,160\nIs it three gigs?\n\n795\n00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,620\n>> I think it's almost three gigs.\n\n796\n00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:29,450\n>> Bigger than I thought, but but\nyou download it and what it does,\n\n797\n00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:33,830\nit puts virtualization software on your\nsystem, and a Windows XP machine and\n\n798\n00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:37,010\nit gets it running in the background\nwhere you don't have to worry about it.\n\n799\n00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:40,220\nAnd then you can have some\napplications that when they run,\n\n800\n00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:43,420\nthey look like they're running right there\non your Windows 7 machine, but in reality,\n\n801\n00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:47,030\nthey're running in the background\non this virtual Windows XP machine.\n\n802\n00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:47,880\nIt's really neat.\n\n803\n00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,790\nIt's designed to be super easy to use.\n\n804\n00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:54,530\nIn real life land, though, if you haven't\ndeployed this before now, don't start.\n\n805\n00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:58,310\nMicrosoft doesn't support\nWindows XP in any form anymore,\n\n806\n00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:00,060\nunless you pay them a lot of extra money.\n\n807\n00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,150\nSo so for\nmost people they aren't doing that.\n\n808\n00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:06,360\nSo they dont get the support, and\nthis product is, is effectively dead.\n\n809\n00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,470\nBut, you can still fire\nup Oracle Virtualbox, or\n\n810\n00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:13,230\nVMware workstation, or, or any of the\nvarious other products that are out there\n\n811\n00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:16,660\nthat allow you to run Windows XP\nin a virtual machine.\n\n812\n00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:20,830\nEven if it's not Windows XP you\nmight wanna run other OS's, right?\n\n813\n00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:24,150\nWindows 8 is out, maybe you want\nto experiment with Windows 8 but\n\n814\n00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:27,600\nyou're not ready to pull the trigger and\nswitch over to it completely.\n\n815\n00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,150\nYou could run Windows 7 on your machine,\nand\n\n816\n00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,158\nthen run Windows 8 in a virtual machine.\n\n817\n00:39:33,158 --> 00:39:35,340\nOr Windows 10 is in preview right now, so\n\n818\n00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,620\nyou could run Windows 10\nin a virtual machine.\n\n819\n00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:40,500\nReally neat functionality\nout there if you pursue it.\n\n820\n00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,490\nAnd the the product I use\nthe VMware product I use\n\n821\n00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:45,050\nis actually kind of expensive.\n\n822\n00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:48,350\nBut the one Ronnie uses\nis awesome because it is.\n\n823\n00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,430\n>> Free.\n[LAUGH]\n\n824\n00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,180\n>> Absolutely free.\n\n825\n00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,080\nYou just can't beat that price and\nit works really well.\n\n826\n00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:52,590\n>> It does.\n\n827\n00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,540\n>> It's from Oracle.\n\n828\n00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,650\nIt's call Virtual Box.\n\n829\n00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:56,950\nYou can get it at virtualbox.org.\n\n830\n00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:57,830\nYou can install it.\n\n831\n00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,260\nDoesn't cost you a dime.\n\n832\n00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,590\nAnd then you can throw whatever\noperating system you want in there.\n\n833\n00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:04,816\nYou can do Linux, or\nWindows, various versions.\n\n834\n00:40:04,816 --> 00:40:07,412\nYou can't do Mac OS but\nyou can do all the other ones.\n\n835\n00:40:07,412 --> 00:40:09,456\nAnd they run great!\n\n836\n00:40:09,456 --> 00:40:12,618\n>> Now, Don I made a mistake on the XP\nmode you can run it in Professional as\n\n837\n00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:15,619\nwell, I just checked on the system\nrequirements on that page, and\n\n838\n00:40:15,619 --> 00:40:17,780\nit does say Professional right there.\n\n839\n00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:21,770\n>> Okay, so Professional and Enterprise,\nso no, no Home or Home Premium,\n\n840\n00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:22,852\njust the business ones.\n\n841\n00:40:22,852 --> 00:40:25,940\nAll right, so\npretty cool stuff that's out there.\n\n842\n00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,890\nVirtualization is something\nthat as an IT worker,\n\n843\n00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:31,860\nit's pretty much a guarantee that you are\ngoing to use it at some point or another.\n\n844\n00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:37,060\nAs a home user, or a non IT worker,\nif you are using it,\n\n845\n00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,400\nit's probably been made transparent so\nyou won't even know it.\n\n846\n00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,800\nYou know, it's kind of hidden from you, so\n\n847\n00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,850\nit's not something your\naverage user will experience.\n\n848\n00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:48,650\nA couple of other alternatives to\nvirtualization, there are times where you\n\n849\n00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:52,160\nneed access to software but\nyour system doesn't support it.\n\n850\n00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,390\nSo instead of running it on your system,\n\n851\n00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:57,070\nwe could run it from\na serve somewhere else.\n\n852\n00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:59,740\nAnd you could connect to that\nsoftware through the server.\n\n853\n00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:04,070\nTo do that, we can use another technology\nfrom Microsoft called remote desktop\n\n854\n00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:06,090\nservices, RDS.\n\n855\n00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:08,020\nNow we talked about remote\ndesktop in another episode.\n\n856\n00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:11,370\nI said eh, it's a great way to see your\ncomputer, if you're out of the office.\n\n857\n00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:15,760\nBut now I'm talking about just like\nparticular software packages, and\n\n858\n00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,080\nthat's a lot different than one\nperson connecting to one computer.\n\n859\n00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,010\nAnd we use this pretty heavily here.\n\n860\n00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:24,940\nWe have a couple of remote desktop\nservices servers, or RDS servers,\n\n861\n00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,200\nthat are set up here so\nthat we can have many,\n\n862\n00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:32,580\nmany employees all connect into\nthe same system to be able to access\n\n863\n00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:36,920\ntheir e-mail and their office applications\nand, and all of that good stuff.\n\n864\n00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,530\nSo for us, a lot of us use laptops\nthat are, are personal laptops or\n\n865\n00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:43,670\nones that were just assigned to us, and\n\n866\n00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:46,180\nwe didn't wanna have to keep\ntrack of software licensing.\n\n867\n00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,890\nSo for example, Microsoft Office.\n\n868\n00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:51,270\nHow do we really know how many computers\nwe have Microsoft Office installed on?\n\n869\n00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:53,750\nWell, in large environments\nyou use tracking software, but\n\n870\n00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:56,470\nwe're small enough that it,\nit doesn't make sense to do it.\n\n871\n00:41:56,470 --> 00:42:00,320\nSo instead, we don't install\nMicrosoft Office on people's machines.\n\n872\n00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,890\nIf you look at Ronny's machine or\nmy machine,\n\n873\n00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:03,910\nwe don't, we don't have Office right here.\n\n874\n00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:07,550\nWe have Microsoft Office running\non a server in the server closet\n\n875\n00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:10,450\nwhere we can track how many copies\nare running at any given time.\n\n876\n00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:14,650\nAnd if somebody wants to access it,\nthey just remote into the server and\n\n877\n00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:15,550\nthey have that access.\n\n878\n00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:16,420\nLet me show you an example.\n\n879\n00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:20,810\nSo here's my Windows 7 machine, and\n\n880\n00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:23,790\nI don't have hardly\nanything installed on it.\n\n881\n00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:27,460\nIf I look for like Microsoft Word,\nI've got Wordpad, but\n\n882\n00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,410\nI don't have Word from the Office suite.\n\n883\n00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:34,070\nSo, I don't have that software\non my own machine, but,\n\n884\n00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:41,730\nI can fire up the remote desktop client,\nand I can point it to one of our servers.\n\n885\n00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:46,520\nAnd so I'll point it to one\nof our RDSs servers, and\n\n886\n00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:52,088\nwhen I connect I'll have access to all\nof the software that's on that system.\n\n887\n00:42:52,088 --> 00:42:54,250\nSo I'm gonna get connected up,\nand here I am,\n\n888\n00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:57,790\nI've got my little desktop,\nand I can fire it up.\n\n889\n00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:01,080\nAnd here I've got Microsoft Office.\n\n890\n00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,995\nAnd here's Microsoft Word and Outlook and\nPublisher and all that good stuff,\n\n891\n00:43:03,995 --> 00:43:07,105\nand I can fire up Microsoft Word, and now,\n\n892\n00:43:07,105 --> 00:43:08,880\nremember I didn't have\na spellchecker before.\n\n893\n00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,085\n[LAUGH] So\nthis is the spell check feature.\n\n894\n00:43:12,085 --> 00:43:14,072\nNow, I do.\nNow I've got the full functionality of\n\n895\n00:43:14,072 --> 00:43:17,292\nMicrosoft Word,\nbecause it's running on that server.\n\n896\n00:43:17,292 --> 00:43:20,972\nIts not running on my machine but\nI have access to it.\n\n897\n00:43:20,972 --> 00:43:24,152\nThere's a lot of, of reasons\na company would want to do this.\n\n898\n00:43:24,152 --> 00:43:25,462\nThe main one is license management.\n\n899\n00:43:25,462 --> 00:43:29,742\nThat is definitely a lot easier,\nbut upgrades are easier too.\n\n900\n00:43:29,742 --> 00:43:33,622\nIf I have Office installed on 100 machines\nand I want to upgrade it, I'm gonna go and\n\n901\n00:43:33,622 --> 00:43:35,282\nupgrade it 100 times.\n\n902\n00:43:35,282 --> 00:43:38,920\nBut if I have Office running\non one centralized RDS server,\n\n903\n00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,200\nI just upgraded here once,\nand then it's upgraded for\n\n904\n00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,320\neverybody cuz they're all running\nit right here, from this server.\n\n905\n00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,780\nAnd I'm not the only person\non this server, or at least,\n\n906\n00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,180\nI seriously doubt that I am.\n\n907\n00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:52,550\nLet's see,\nwho else is floating around this one.\n\n908\n00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:55,770\nSo if we take a look at it,\nyou can look at all these names.\n\n909\n00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:59,190\nWe have Art and there's me.\n\n910\n00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:02,450\nYou know you know,\nall sorts of people in here.\n\n911\n00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:03,545\nSome of these people I don't know.\n\n912\n00:44:03,545 --> 00:44:05,840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mean, obviously they're authorized,\n\n913\n00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,770\nthey wouldn't have an account,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n914\n00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:08,330\n>> I just don't know them personally.\n\n915\n00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:11,430\nSo, you'll see all these different\npeople in here, all doing stuff.\n\n916\n00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:12,570\n>> Yeah.\n>> And working in the system.\n\n917\n00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:15,790\nSo we're all sharing this server,\nand that works out really well.\n\n918\n00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:16,910\nThat's RDS.\n\n919\n00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:18,845\nRemote Desktop Services.\n\n920\n00:44:20,512 --> 00:44:21,910\nAll right, so.\n\n921\n00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:24,020\nThose are some of the different\nthings that we need to think about\n\n922\n00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:28,600\nwhen we install Windows 7 or when we adopt\nWindows 7 as our base operating system.\n\n923\n00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,120\nMost of the time it works great for\n\n924\n00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:34,400\nall of our needs, but if we have software\nthat's not compatible, there's options.\n\n925\n00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,800\nRight?\nAnd there's other things we can do\n\n926\n00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:40,060\nto maintain that compatibility and\nstill upgrade to Windows 7.\n\n927\n00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:43,320\nAll right, Ronny,\nI think that wraps up this objective.\n\n928\n00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,780\n>> It does.\n>> Can you think of anything we left out?\n\n929\n00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:45,400\n>> I don't think so.\n\n930\n00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,262\nYeah, I think everything was good.\n\n931\n00:44:47,262 --> 00:44:48,941\n>> All right, so,\nlet's just do a quick recap,\n\n932\n00:44:48,941 --> 00:44:52,620\ncuz we've covered quite a bit in\na fairly short amount of time.\n\n933\n00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:57,870\nWe started talking about the, the minimum\nsystem requirements of Windows 7.\n\n934\n00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:02,180\nWe moved on to the different\nversions of Windows 7,\n\n935\n00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:05,430\nthe SKUs, the different editions.\n\n936\n00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:08,460\nAnd then we talked a little bit about\nthe upgrade paths, if you're coming from\n\n937\n00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:12,040\nan older OS to a newer one, which ones\nwere allowed and which ones weren't.\n\n938\n00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,760\nSo those were all basic things centering\naround the installation of Windows.\n\n939\n00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:19,700\nThen we discuss some of the installation\ntypes like the installation media,\n\n940\n00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,750\nas well as DTI and LTI,\nall those crazy things.\n\n941\n00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:27,420\nAnd we just wrapped up talking\nabout other alternative\n\n942\n00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:31,040\ninstallations like virtualization and\nremote desktop services.\n\n943\n00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:35,952\nSo quite a, quite a bit to be able\nto use the power of Windows 7.\n\n944\n00:45:35,952 --> 00:45:40,160\nAll right, well, that's a pretty good\nspot for us to wrap up this objective.\n\n945\n00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:44,530\nWe've still got a good bit more on\nthe MTA tracks, so don't stop now.\n\n946\n00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:47,040\nBut, for today,\nit's okay to stop, I guess.\n\n947\n00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,564\nSo maybe it is okay to stop right now.\n\n948\n00:45:48,564 --> 00:45:51,050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, let me remind you guys if you have\n\n949\n00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:54,650\nquestions on anything that we've covered,\nfeel free to ask.\n\n950\n00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:58,640\nLive during the show, you can go to\nitpro.tv/live

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:08.211 --> 00:00:12.365\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.365 --> 00:00:15.930\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.540\n&gt;&gt; I'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\n\n7\n00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.078\ntoday we're taking a look at\nWindows Operating System fundamentals.\n\n8\n00:00:21.078 --> 00:00:25.050\nWe're specifically gonna be diving into\nthe realm of what different upgrades and\n\n9\n00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.220\ndifferent additions and\ndifferent requirements that you\n\n10\n00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.360\nneed if you're gonna be running some\ntype of Windows operating system.\n\n11\n00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.140\nAnd here to help us understand that\na bit more is gonna be Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.220\nWes, welcome back to our show.\n\n13\n00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.260\n&gt;&gt; Thanks man, I tell you what,\nthat's a challenging one.\n\n14\n00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.990\nI threw an entire novel for the title.\n\n15\n00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.740\nWe got a lot of stuff that\nwe're gonna look at, and\n\n16\n00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.338\nit is something that\nyou should be aware of.\n\n17\n00:00:44.338 --> 00:00:48.770\nIf you're gonna endeavor to take the MTA\nexam in Windows Operating System\n\n18\n00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.240\nfundamentals, because, well,\nwhat do we mean when we say fundamentals?\n\n19\n00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.600\nWell, you have to know\nexactly what you need\n\n20\n00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.430\nin order to start with\nthe operating system.\n\n21\n00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.400\nAnd by that,\nI mean the installation of it.\n\n22\n00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.704\nAnd it might be something that\nthey call out on the exam.\n\n23\n00:01:00.704 --> 00:01:04.765\nNow, I will tell you one good though\nis with Windows system requirements,\n\n24\n00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:06.966\nthey really haven't changed too much.\n\n25\n00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:11.830\nNow, as new technologies that come out,\nthey require additional support for\n\n26\n00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.221\nthe technologies that\nweren't there even just four,\n\n27\n00:01:15.221 --> 00:01:18.620\nfive years ago, but\nthe specifications themselves.\n\n28\n00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.180\nThe requirements of what you need\nin order to get Windows up and\n\n29\n00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.820\nrunning really hasn't change too much,\nas long as you know.\n\n30\n00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.520\nNow, we've also mentioned additions.\n\n31\n00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.980\nWhy is that even important?\n\n32\n00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.990\nWell, not only on an exam, but\neven if you're a help desk, somebody says,\n\n33\n00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.360\nwell, I need this feature, and\nyou say well, is it in Windows 10?\n\n34\n00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.360\nWell, I don't know.\n\n35\n00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.990\nThat depends.\n\n36\n00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.320\nDepends on what edition you have,\n\n37\n00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.390\na feature might be there,\na feature might not be there.\n\n38\n00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.910\nSo, that's also gonna be something\nthat's important on the exam,\n\n39\n00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.300\nbut even just in your general\nunderstanding of Windows,\n\n40\n00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.190\njust to help you become a little\nbit more proficient with it.\n\n41\n00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.060\nThe last thing Ronnie's already\nmentioned was upgrades.\n\n42\n00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.970\nWell, what if you already have\nan existing Windows operating system?\n\n43\n00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.560\nDo you have to pay full price and\nget another operating system?\n\n44\n00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.020\nIf so, what if you really like all the\ninformation that you've got stored on your\n\n45\n00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.369\nprior Windows 10 operating system, your\napplications, and you don't wanna lose it?\n\n46\n00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.480\nWhat do you do there?\n\n47\n00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.810\nWell, that's where upgrades come in.\n\n48\n00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.110\nBut for an upgrade to happen,\n\n49\n00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.650\nyou have to know what operating system you\ncan come from to move into Windows 10.\n\n50\n00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.810\nAnd that's what we're gonna take\na look at here in this episode.\n\n51\n00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.230\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Wes, speaking about\nrequirements and additions and\n\n52\n00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.560\nupgrades, let's go ahead and just begin\nwith the concept of requirements.\n\n53\n00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.760\nWhy does it really matter?\n\n54\n00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.610\nIf I have a computer sitting at home,\n\n55\n00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.970\nI should just be able to install Windows\n10 on it and be perfectly fine, right?\n\n56\n00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.222\n&gt;&gt; You would think that'd be the case.\n\n57\n00:02:38.222 --> 00:02:40.978\nWith the different types of\ndevices that they have out there,\n\n58\n00:02:40.978 --> 00:02:44.165\nwith all these different computers,\nyou would think, you know what?\n\n59\n00:02:44.165 --> 00:02:47.930\nAn operating system is an operating\nsystem is an operating system.\n\n60\n00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.490\nWell, that might be, but\nnot every piece of hardware is the same.\n\n61\n00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.360\nSo, it is important to understand that\n\n62\n00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.700\nWindows does require a certain\namount of resources to run.\n\n63\n00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.055\nNot only that, it does require a certain\namount of resources to run efficiently.\n\n64\n00:03:01.055 --> 00:03:01.971\nOnly two.\n\n65\n00:03:01.971 --> 00:03:04.595\nSo, what I'd like to talk about\nare the specifications for\n\n66\n00:03:04.595 --> 00:03:06.995\ninstalling your Windows\n10 operating system.\n\n67\n00:03:06.995 --> 00:03:09.715\nIn fact, they've got a great website\nout there, all you gotta to do\n\n68\n00:03:09.715 --> 00:03:14.155\nis plug in research engine, whether\nyou use Bing, whether you use Google.\n\n69\n00:03:14.155 --> 00:03:19.225\nJust type into the search engine,\nWindows 10 system requirements.\n\n70\n00:03:19.225 --> 00:03:22.780\nAnd what you should come up\nwith is a website like this,\n\n71\n00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.310\nthat it tells you exactly\nwhat the requirements are for\n\n72\n00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.276\nyour Windows 10 operating system,\nand even more so than that,\n\n73\n00:03:28.276 --> 00:03:32.998\nwhat I like about what they've done is\nthat they've giving a lot more, right?\n\n74\n00:03:32.998 --> 00:03:35.860\nSome of these upgrade editions,\nwe'll talk about as well, but\n\n75\n00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.490\nthey give a lot more than just\nyour system requirements.\n\n76\n00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.200\nThat's where we're gonna\nfocus in here at first.\n\n77\n00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.400\nAnd if we look,\nyou're gonna see that the requirements\n\n78\n00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.910\nreally aren't that bad by\nthe day standards, however,\n\n79\n00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.080\nRonnie said, I've gotta a laptop here,\nI've gotta a device here.\n\n80\n00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.080\nCan I run it?\n\n81\n00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.330\nWell, does it fall in the realm\nof these minimum requirements?\n\n82\n00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.340\nNow, I do want you know that\nthese are minimum requirements.\n\n83\n00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.920\nIf your machine can support this, it\ndoesn't necessarily mean that you're gonna\n\n84\n00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.970\nget the greatest experience\nout of Windows 10, okay?\n\n85\n00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.040\nSo let's talk about them, right?\n\n86\n00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.580\nThe first thing we need to know is\nthat there are a few different set of\n\n87\n00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.210\nrequirements if you have 64\nbit versus 32-bit, all right?\n\n88\n00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:22.030\nAnd that's something\nwe need to understand.\n\n89\n00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.850\nWe do talk about system\narchitecture a little bit more in\n\n90\n00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.510\nour architecture episode.\n\n91\n00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.018\nBut remember that 32-bit,\njust as a real quick recap,\n\n92\n00:04:30.018 --> 00:04:34.716\n32-bit versus 64-bit means how much\nmemory do I want to have available?\n\n93\n00:04:34.716 --> 00:04:39.900\nYour earlier 32-bit operating systems, and\neven today, they do have a limitation.\n\n94\n00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.790\nFour gigs of RAM is all that you can have.\n\n95\n00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.413\nIf it's all that it can see,\n\n96\n00:04:43.413 --> 00:04:47.280\nit doesn't matter how much RAM\nmight be in the machine, all right?\n\n97\n00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.940\nSo, that's a big one.\n\n98\n00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.030\nBut in a 32-bit operating system,\nif you are gonna install Windows,\n\n99\n00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.610\nthey do recommend having a minimum\nrequirement of a single gig.\n\n100\n00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.920\nAnd again, by today's standards,\nthat doesn't seem like a lot, but\n\n101\n00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.870\nkind in mind, If you are a help desk,\nyou might say,\n\n102\n00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.760\nwhy would I even care about\nthat minimum requirement?\n\n103\n00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.440\nWhat if you are at a help desk position,\nand\n\n104\n00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.160\nyou're supporting people that have had\nmachines around for a while and they\n\n105\n00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.300\ndon't have the money to just throw out,\nand deploy a whole bunch of new machines?\n\n106\n00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.890\nThat's where it starts to become a little\nbit more useful to know this information.\n\n107\n00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:24.500\nNow, when you talk about 64-bit,\nI almost said 64 gig there, 64 bit.\n\n108\n00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.890\nRemember, that kinda breaks\nthe bounds of memory that we have.\n\n109\n00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.800\nThat gives us access to a lot of memory.\n\n110\n00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.025\nIn fact, so much memory, that we don't\nreally have systems today that support it,\n\n111\n00:05:34.025 --> 00:05:37.366\noutside of stacking a lot of big\nold servers together in the cloud.\n\n112\n00:05:37.366 --> 00:05:41.272\nAll right, but do keep in mind that\nbecause it uses a little bit more memory\n\n113\n00:05:41.272 --> 00:05:44.359\nin a 64-bit system, for\nthe operating system itself,\n\n114\n00:05:44.359 --> 00:05:48.087\nyou could see that its double\nthe minimum requirement of a 32-bit.\n\n115\n00:05:48.087 --> 00:05:49.677\nWe have two gigs of RAM.\n\n116\n00:05:49.677 --> 00:05:53.281\nAnd again, you might be thinking, well,\nman, I got this beast of a machine over\n\n117\n00:05:53.281 --> 00:05:56.950\nhere, and its got 32, it's got 16,\nit's got eight gigs, so I'll be okay.\n\n118\n00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.430\nBut not every laptop or\ntablet has that too.\n\n119\n00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.430\nAnd that's where we'll stop to talk\na little bit about the additions.\n\n120\n00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.030\nNow, notice, notice that we have\na hard disk space, all right?\n\n121\n00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.910\nThey say the minimum recommended for\nthe 32-bit is 16, and\n\n122\n00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.930\nthe minimum recommend for\nthe 64 is 20 gigs.\n\n123\n00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.790\nWhy is there a difference?\n\n124\n00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.640\nWell, there's a difference in how much\nof the applications that are installed,\n\n125\n00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.240\ndirectories.\n\n126\n00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.789\nYou have more directories inside of a\n64-bit operating system than you do inside\n\n127\n00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:25.570\nof the 32-bit.\n\n128\n00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.610\nIn fact, you got inside of the 64-bit,\n\n129\n00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.150\nyou've got an entire subsystem that allows\nyou to run these 32-bit applications.\n\n130\n00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.310\nSo essentially, starting out,\nyou get two program folders.\n\n131\n00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.700\nGet one, or\nProgram Files folder, excuse me,\n\n132\n00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.680\nget one that's just called Program Files.\n\n133\n00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.450\nYou also get one that's\ncalled Program Files X86,\n\n134\n00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.472\nand that's where your\n32-bit applications go.\n\n135\n00:06:45.472 --> 00:06:48.410\nSo, do realize it takes a little\nbit more hard drive space\n\n136\n00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.930\nin order to support the 64-bit\noperating systems, but really,\n\n137\n00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.670\nwhen it comes down to it,\nthese are minimum requirements.\n\n138\n00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:59.480\nAnd I'm gonna show you guys\nhere in a second why a 16 gig\n\n139\n00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.840\nhard drive isn't really too good of\nhardware to have in your machine.\n\n140\n00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:07.845\nNow, I will make mention of\nthis graphics card, remember,\n\n141\n00:07:07.845 --> 00:07:12.585\nthese are the bare minimum requirements,\nokay?\n\n142\n00:07:12.585 --> 00:07:17.111\nIt says DirectX 9, I believe we're on\nDirectX 11 now, we might be going into 12,\n\n143\n00:07:17.111 --> 00:07:19.730\nbut it's about there at\nthe time of the shooting.\n\n144\n00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.048\nOkay, the other thing I want you to know,\nwhat is this WDDM?\n\n145\n00:07:22.048 --> 00:07:25.267\nThat's the Windows display driver model,\nall right?\n\n146\n00:07:25.267 --> 00:07:28.326\nAnd you have to have 1.0 or higher.\n\n147\n00:07:28.326 --> 00:07:32.440\nKeep in mind, DirectX 9 is old, so\nyou might not get the benefits of your\n\n148\n00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.280\ngraphics card that you\nhave inside of the system.\n\n149\n00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.780\nBecause of the newer technologies, and\nall of the beefier hardware that we have,\n\n150\n00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.400\nagain, this is just\nthe minimum requirements.\n\n151\n00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.510\nNotice also too, I believe that's SVGA,\n\n152\n00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.160\ngonna try to remember my\nhardware basics here.\n\n153\n00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:52.792\nI believe 800 by 600 resolution\nis the old SVGA resolution.\n\n154\n00:07:52.792 --> 00:07:56.351\nAnd in today of high definition, that\ndoesn't seem like much, but there again,\n\n155\n00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:58.636\nkeep in mind,\nthese are the minimum requirements.\n\n156\n00:07:58.636 --> 00:07:59.894\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Wes,\n\n157\n00:07:59.894 --> 00:08:04.267\nwith these ideas of the requirements\nthat you've just talked about.\n\n158\n00:08:04.267 --> 00:08:06.927\nWhat if I don't meet every single\nrequirement but I meet like,\n\n159\n00:08:06.927 --> 00:08:09.249\nthree out of four or\ntwo out of the three Is that enough?\n\n160\n00:08:09.249 --> 00:08:11.330\n&gt;&gt; Well, not necessarily.\n\n161\n00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.860\nOne of the things that you might want\nto consider there is an upgrade of\n\n162\n00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.160\nthe component that maybe\nisn't where it needs to be.\n\n163\n00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.910\nNow I understand that certain things\nyou might not be able to upgrade.\n\n164\n00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:23.370\nFor instance, if you have a laptop that\nhas a motherboard that has things built\n\n165\n00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.940\ninto to it, well you don't\nreally have ability to upgrade.\n\n166\n00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.560\nSo that is something to keep and it's a\ngreat question cuz it's something to keep\n\n167\n00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.500\nin mind before you even install\nin the operating system.\n\n168\n00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.640\nThat's why it's best to know what type\nof device you are going to install.\n\n169\n00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.190\nIn fact, let's go ahead and\nlet me show you.\n\n170\n00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:37.091\nI've actually got a machine here.\n\n171\n00:08:37.091 --> 00:08:39.450\nAnd this is kinda interesting Ronnie.\n\n172\n00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.090\nWe're gonna see how painful this might be.\n\n173\n00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:46.995\nI've got a machine here that's got less\nthan the gig ram that they say and\n\n174\n00:08:46.995 --> 00:08:50.870\nhard drive space is severely\nlimited on this one as well.\n\n175\n00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:55.200\nIn fact If we bring up our system\nproperties, we'll give you guys a, or\n\n176\n00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.860\nsystem control panel,\nwe'll give you an idea to see.\n\n177\n00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:01.990\nAnd boy, you can see, that's taking\nforever just to launch up here.\n\n178\n00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:07.370\nLet's see what kind of memory we have,\nall right.\n\n179\n00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:11.814\nIf you can see that one, Ronnie, I'll tell\nyou what, we've got around 300 MB of RAM.\n\n180\n00:09:11.814 --> 00:09:15.120\nNow why is that gonna be a hassle?\n\n181\n00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:15.980\nLet's show you here.\n\n182\n00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.730\nIf you remember we talked about some of\nour management utilities that we have.\n\n183\n00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:20.170\nAnd one of them is task manager.\n\n184\n00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:22.600\nI'm going to go ahead and\nright click on the task bar.\n\n185\n00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.770\nI'm gonna launch up task manager.\n\n186\n00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:26.939\nAnd hopefully within the episode\nit actually launches up.\n\n187\n00:09:26.939 --> 00:09:31.587\nYou can see that we've got well we've\ngot some memory utilization and\n\n188\n00:09:31.587 --> 00:09:34.690\nour memory utilization is already at 89%.\n\n189\n00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:35.956\nGuys we don't have anything\ninstalled on this.\n\n190\n00:09:35.956 --> 00:09:38.250\nLet me take that back.\n\n191\n00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.060\nI do have Chrome installed on it, but\n\n192\n00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.660\nthat was it,\nthat was all that was installed on it.\n\n193\n00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.110\nIt's not even running, but\n\n194\n00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.280\nI have not a single application\npretty much running here.\n\n195\n00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.200\nAnd if I go over to the Performance tab,\ncheck that out Ronnie.\n\n196\n00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.160\nWe are pegged, we are all ready at 93% of\n\n197\n00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.210\nwhat it takes to run\nthe operating system alone, okay?\n\n198\n00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:02.740\nSo if I decide that I wanna start\nrunning additional applications, and\n\n199\n00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.028\nthis is where it starts to become\na little bit painful here.\n\n200\n00:10:05.028 --> 00:10:09.280\nWe're gonna launch up Internet Explorer,\nand it isn't gonna connect here guys but\n\n201\n00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.600\nwe'll let it run in the background.\n\n202\n00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:15.430\nNotice, we barely get\nto the start menu here.\n\n203\n00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:17.100\nNotice things are starting\nto slow down a little bit?\n\n204\n00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.595\nWe're gonna launch up some Fresh Paint\ncuz everybody needs Fresh Paint\n\n205\n00:10:20.595 --> 00:10:22.700\nin an operating system.\n\n206\n00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.630\nAnd we're gonna wait for it.\n\n207\n00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.060\nNow I've launched it here, guys.\n\n208\n00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:30.270\nBut notice we're starting to get\na little bit of sluggish nature.\n\n209\n00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:34.610\nIn fact, I can barely even\nget to my task manager there.\n\n210\n00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:36.449\nYou cans see it's 94%.\n\n211\n00:10:36.449 --> 00:10:38.270\nIf you can see that little\ngauge in the background there.\n\n212\n00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.690\nIt's not allowing me to run anything.\n\n213\n00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:46.620\nSo that's important to remember when\nit comes to these minimum requirements.\n\n214\n00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.020\nLook how long it took\njust to launch that up.\n\n215\n00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.000\nAnd it actually closed it down and\nit crashed.\n\n216\n00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.980\nI would almost be willing to\nbet that it crashed here.\n\n217\n00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.270\nAnd you can see that we're\npaging a lot of information.\n\n218\n00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.780\nSo this memory is running so bad that\n\n219\n00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:05.050\nour hard drive in now starting to be used\nas a little bit portion of that memory.\n\n220\n00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:08.940\nAnd we're having a little bit of extra\nwork that the operating system has to do\n\n221\n00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.520\nin order to keep this thing running.\n\n222\n00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.830\nAnd you could see it's barely\neven loading this up all right?\n\n223\n00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:18.580\nSo notice that the performance starts\nto wane very, very badly here.\n\n224\n00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:25.170\nAnd so much so that now my desktop\nis kind of going haywire here.\n\n225\n00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:28.089\nAnd I'll tell you what,\nwhat I'm going to go ahead and do is,\n\n226\n00:11:28.089 --> 00:11:30.460\nI guess I'm gonna have to\nend some of these tasks.\n\n227\n00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.860\nNotice I'm at 99% my CPU utilization.\n\n228\n00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:38.530\nSo if you have an older CPU that doesn't\nmeet the one gigahertz requirement,\n\n229\n00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:41.290\nthat's another thing the CPU\nhas to meet its requirement.\n\n230\n00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:43.720\nYou aren't going to get very\ngood performance on these.\n\n231\n00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.970\nRemember when I told you about\nthe hard drive that I have\n\n232\n00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:48.790\njust barely what I need in a hard drive.\n\n233\n00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:50.210\nBut I'm trying to launch things here,\nRonnie.\n\n234\n00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.840\nAnd it's kind of funny.\n\n235\n00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.060\nNothing's really happening here.\n\n236\n00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:57.550\nAnd we might not be able to even see that\nhard drive in the time that we have for\n\n237\n00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:58.220\nthis episode.\n\n238\n00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:04.310\nSo notice that we're getting red lights,\nwe got 99% CPU utilization.\n\n239\n00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:09.590\nYou can see that all I did was launch\nthe default little image editor here and\n\n240\n00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:12.750\nit's struggling,\nit's struggling to come up and open up.\n\n241\n00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:16.659\nSo that's probably one of the reasons you\ndon't want to skimp on any one of these.\n\n242\n00:12:16.659 --> 00:12:20.243\nGetting back to the question that\nRonnie had well, what if I've got,\n\n243\n00:12:20.243 --> 00:12:22.630\nwhat if I have a drive that's enough,\nright?\n\n244\n00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.356\nWhat if my CPU's enough, but\nI don't have enough RAM?\n\n245\n00:12:24.356 --> 00:12:25.493\nWell you could see right here,\n\n246\n00:12:25.493 --> 00:12:27.918\nwe're having a hard time just\ngetting even the basic tasks done.\n\n247\n00:12:27.918 --> 00:12:32.183\nAnd we haven't even talked about moving\ninto something like installing Office,\n\n248\n00:12:32.183 --> 00:12:35.728\nright, and starting to work with\nspreadsheets or Word processor.\n\n249\n00:12:35.728 --> 00:12:40.760\nIf I come down here to my hard drive,\nwe'll go ahead and select This PC.\n\n250\n00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:48.010\nAnd hopefully we get some kind\nof File Explorer opens up for\n\n251\n00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:49.910\nus, you can see how painful this is.\n\n252\n00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:54.150\nNow base install, Ronnie this is one of\nthe reasons I was saying well what if\n\n253\n00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:57.070\nthe hard drive, everything else is\nthere but the hard drive isn't there,\n\n254\n00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:02.540\nwith a base install 16 gigs here I've got,\nwhat, two gigs left?\n\n255\n00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:06.210\nThat I can use and your operating\nsystem is using a portion of that now,\n\n256\n00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:09.980\nbecause the memory is so bad that\nit's writing to the hard drive and\n\n257\n00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.010\npulling that information in and\nout of the hard drive.\n\n258\n00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:15.880\nSo at a certain point, I won't even be\nable to use the paging file anymore.\n\n259\n00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.930\nSwapping memory in and out of\nthe hard drive and back into RAM, so\n\n260\n00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:22.112\nyou can start to see that these\nspecifications they're running.\n\n261\n00:13:22.112 --> 00:13:25.540\nThey do come in, you know, handy.\n\n262\n00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.840\nBut they're also very very important.\n\n263\n00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.510\nEven the minimum rec, the minimum\nrecommended requirements that we've shown\n\n264\n00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:34.130\nyou here guys are still\ngonna be painfully slow.\n\n265\n00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:38.570\nIf you want to get the full utilization of\nWindows 10, then the more RAM you have,\n\n266\n00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:40.120\nthe better, I always say that.\n\n267\n00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.530\nThe processing power, make sure you\nhave plenty of processing power.\n\n268\n00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:45.300\nMake sure you have hard drive space.\n\n269\n00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.750\nKeep in mind that just because\nyou can run it doesn't mean,\n\n270\n00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:51.770\nnecessarily, that it's gonna be\nthe greatest operating system\n\n271\n00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:54.590\nif you don't give it a little bit\nof the horsepower that it needs.\n\n272\n00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:58.782\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Wes, now with a fairly\ndecent understanding of having to meet\n\n273\n00:13:58.782 --> 00:14:01.660\nthe minimum hardware requirements.\n\n274\n00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.210\nWhat do we need to know\nabout the idea of additions?\n\n275\n00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:07.300\nI buy the computer,\nit's got whatever addition on it,\n\n276\n00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.290\nwhat do I need to know besides that?\n\n277\n00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:10.450\n&gt;&gt; That's another great question,\n\n278\n00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:12.811\none of the things that comes to mind\nis the amount of features, right.\n\n279\n00:14:12.811 --> 00:14:15.875\nThey have three different\ntypes of operating system,\n\n280\n00:14:15.875 --> 00:14:18.406\nfour I'll mention\nthe fourth one here too but\n\n281\n00:14:18.406 --> 00:14:22.950\nprimarily with Windows 10 you have three\nmain different editions of Windows.\n\n282\n00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:25.830\nAnd when it comes to the different\neditions, it's really the demographic that\n\n283\n00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:29.620\nthat operating system is focused for,\nthat it's intended for.\n\n284\n00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:31.640\nSo for instance, you have Windows 10 Home.\n\n285\n00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.478\nWindows 10 Home is good for\nsimplified Word processing,\n\n286\n00:14:34.478 --> 00:14:35.964\nrunning basic applications.\n\n287\n00:14:35.964 --> 00:14:40.608\nI get the multimedia experience if I want,\nbut one of the things that I'm\n\n288\n00:14:40.608 --> 00:14:45.270\nlacking are some of the higher level\nsecurity functionality all right.\n\n289\n00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:49.220\nIf I have a Windows 10 home machine and\ndoesn't matter what device is running,\n\n290\n00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.992\nsays I need you to plug in to, bring your\ncomputer in, plug in to our network,\n\n291\n00:14:52.992 --> 00:14:55.920\njoin it to the domain and\nwe'll start to help you manage it.\n\n292\n00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:59.740\nWindows 10 home is not for\nan enterprise environment.\n\n293\n00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:01.920\nSo there's no ability\nto join it to a domain.\n\n294\n00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.610\nYou see, you lose that functionality,\nbecause that's not what it's geared for.\n\n295\n00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:07.490\nIts intended purpose is,\nlike it says, inside of the home.\n\n296\n00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.440\nHence the name, I mean imagine that,\nWindows 10 Home.\n\n297\n00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:14.650\nNow, if you wanna start getting some\nof those business class type features,\n\n298\n00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:16.710\nthat's where you Windows 10 Pro.\n\n299\n00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:19.250\nNow Windows 10 Pro if\nI've got that edition and\n\n300\n00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.050\nRonnie says Wes bring your laptop up in,\n\n301\n00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:25.680\nhook it up to our network and lets go\nahead and get it joined to the domain.\n\n302\n00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.205\nNow I get that ability right.\n\n303\n00:15:27.205 --> 00:15:29.275\nThat's one of\nthe functionalities that you get.\n\n304\n00:15:29.275 --> 00:15:33.185\nYou get the ability to run things like\nbitlocker drive encryption right?\n\n305\n00:15:33.185 --> 00:15:33.895\nThat you wouldn't\n\n306\n00:15:33.895 --> 00:15:36.245\nget because I don't think some of\nthose security functionalities,\n\n307\n00:15:36.245 --> 00:15:39.735\nfeatures are something that you\nneed available in the home market.\n\n308\n00:15:39.735 --> 00:15:42.125\nGo even more than that,\nyou have Windows 10 enterprise.\n\n309\n00:15:42.125 --> 00:15:44.790\nNow when you get\nthe Windows 10 enterprise,\n\n310\n00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:48.903\nyou get the full functionality every,\nbasically features turned on.\n\n311\n00:15:48.903 --> 00:15:52.776\nYou know we mentioned in a previous\nepisode, let me go ahead mention this one,\n\n312\n00:15:52.776 --> 00:15:53.373\nHyper-V.\n\n313\n00:15:53.373 --> 00:15:55.725\nIf you wanna run Hyper-V\nin your Windows 10 machine?\n\n314\n00:15:55.725 --> 00:15:59.248\nYou aren't gonna do it on a Windows\n10 Home Box It's going to have to be\n\n315\n00:15:59.248 --> 00:16:01.623\na Windows 10 Pro or Windows 10 Enterprise.\n\n316\n00:16:01.623 --> 00:16:03.863\nNow, whether you get into\nWindows 10 Enterprise,\n\n317\n00:16:03.863 --> 00:16:07.100\nyou get additional features like things\nlike AppLocker that you don't get,\n\n318\n00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.170\nBranchCache, and\nthere's a lot of other ones.\n\n319\n00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:11.090\nKnow your additions and know the features.\n\n320\n00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:16.310\nAnd up on the website that we showed you,\nyou could find that information out too.\n\n321\n00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:20.270\nNow, I got a little diagram here and\nwe can talk just briefly about some of\n\n322\n00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:26.000\nthe different types of computers that\nyou might install this on, right?\n\n323\n00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.070\nDesktops, Windows 10,\nall the way across the board.\n\n324\n00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:31.300\nRemember the fourth one I told you,\nI didn't mention it?\n\n325\n00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:35.540\nThat's called IoT, Internet of Things,\nand there is an IoT edition built for\n\n326\n00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:39.860\nthings like Ras pies, specialty\ndevices that I didn't put there, but\n\n327\n00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.740\nI don't really worry about\nit too much on the MTA.\n\n328\n00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:43.670\nJust know that it's there and\n\n329\n00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:46.240\nif they ask you a question on\nit as far as availability.\n\n330\n00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.290\nYes, it's available, all right?\n\n331\n00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:52.330\nBut notice that the desktops, you can\npretty much have any addition you want.\n\n332\n00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:55.660\nYou can have Windows 10 Home,\nPro, Windows Enterprise, and\n\n333\n00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.190\nalso something called\nLong Term Service Branching.\n\n334\n00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:01.120\nNow, we'll talk about in some of the other\nadditions it's how updates going to apply.\n\n335\n00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:06.540\nNow, if you have tablets right,\nwhat kind of device would you or\n\n336\n00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.310\nwhat kind of operating system there?\n\n337\n00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:13.665\nWell, that's were you going to get Windows\n10 home and Windows 10 pro, all right.\n\n338\n00:17:13.665 --> 00:17:17.490\nSpecially devices the long term service\nbranching because it doesn't apply updates\n\n339\n00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:19.630\nthis is good for\nsystems that don't change much and\n\n340\n00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:22.070\nyou don't really need to patch them.\n\n341\n00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:24.020\nAll right, and IoT.\n\n342\n00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:24.800\nAll right, again,\n\n343\n00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.960\nit's an arm based edition of Windows\nthat applies to arm based devices.\n\n344\n00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:32.830\nNow, when it comes to business,\nyou're gonna want to be running Pro,\n\n345\n00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:36.460\nand then you're gonna want\nto be running Enterprise.\n\n346\n00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:39.510\nNow you say, where can I gain\naccess to Enterprise, right?\n\n347\n00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:43.610\nWindows 10 Home, Windows 10 Pro, you could\nbuy it right off any third party reseller.\n\n348\n00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:45.770\nGo right over to Microsoft\nyou could buy it.\n\n349\n00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.160\nBut when it comes to Enterprise\nis a little bit different.\n\n350\n00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.980\nTraditionally Enterprise, because you have\nto prove that you need a certain amount of\n\n351\n00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.560\noperating systems, and\nI'm talking a bunch.\n\n352\n00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.940\nYou need to enter into what's known as\na volume licensing agreement with Windows,\n\n353\n00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.598\nor with Microsoft, all right.\n\n354\n00:17:59.598 --> 00:18:02.160\nSo the enterprise isn't readily\navailable to the market,\n\n355\n00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.010\nit's something you have to go\nstraight to Microsoft and get.\n\n356\n00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:08.125\nBut it is there, it's there for\nbusinesses, all right.\n\n357\n00:18:08.125 --> 00:18:10.585\nSo that's a little bit about\nthe device types running and\n\n358\n00:18:10.585 --> 00:18:12.275\nsome of the features that you might see.\n\n359\n00:18:12.275 --> 00:18:16.175\nKeep in mind that definitely want you to\nreview the website that I showed you.\n\n360\n00:18:16.175 --> 00:18:19.525\nCuz you wanna go through some of those\ndifferent features that they have,\n\n361\n00:18:19.525 --> 00:18:24.145\njust in case on the MTA exam, they ask\nyou, they say, well, I need this features.\n\n362\n00:18:24.145 --> 00:18:25.615\nYou're gonna have to know,\ndoes it come in pro?\n\n363\n00:18:25.615 --> 00:18:27.685\nDoes it come in home?\n\n364\n00:18:27.685 --> 00:18:29.055\nDoes it come in enterprise?\n\n365\n00:18:29.055 --> 00:18:30.910\nAnd is it available to the market?\n\n366\n00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:34.680\nAll right, Wes, so helping us out with\nthe idea of those different editions and\n\n367\n00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:38.840\nunderstanding some of the different\nfeatures that are involved.\n\n368\n00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.790\nWell, you had also mentioned\nthe idea here of upgrades.\n\n369\n00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:47.810\nSo if I might be running say like a\nWindows 7 operating system on my computer,\n\n370\n00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:50.810\nbut I realize that Windows 10 is out now.\n\n371\n00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:54.980\nIs my only option to just install Windows\n10 on it and just start all over?\n\n372\n00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:58.780\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nit depends on what the end result is.\n\n373\n00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:00.485\nThe answer unfortunately is yes and no.\n\n374\n00:19:00.485 --> 00:19:03.570\n[LAUGH] So,\nit really depends on what you want.\n\n375\n00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:05.430\nWe have a couple of\ndifferent types of upgrades.\n\n376\n00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:06.260\nNow, what is an upgrade?\n\n377\n00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.870\nJust like Ronnie said I got an older\nversion of Windows, it's mine,\n\n378\n00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:10.250\nI paid for it.\n\n379\n00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:12.840\nNew version comes out, what do I do?\n\n380\n00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:16.220\nDo I have any benefits from\nbeing already a Windows owner?\n\n381\n00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.170\nAnd the answer is yes, you do.\n\n382\n00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:21.450\nTypically, when you do an upgrade, if you\nwant to move to the new operating system,\n\n383\n00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:23.660\na lot of times it's cheaper, all right?\n\n384\n00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:27.430\nBut you do have to consider some things,\ndo you want your applications and\n\n385\n00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:29.520\nyour settings to remain behind?\n\n386\n00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.880\nIf you do because you can't afford to\nlose them, maybe you don't have any more\n\n387\n00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:37.730\nlicensing for the software, so\nyou can't afford to reinstall it.\n\n388\n00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:40.450\nThen you're gonna do what is\nknown as an in place upgrade.\n\n389\n00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:43.400\nAn in place upgrade is where I take\nthat Windows 7 machine that when Ronnie\n\n390\n00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:47.500\nwas talking about and essentially install,\nor wrap around the installation,\n\n391\n00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:50.810\nthe new Windows 10 operating\nsystem around the old.\n\n392\n00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:51.870\nWhat is I do?\n\n393\n00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:55.400\nAt least my applications,\nmy settings my files are there and\n\n394\n00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.580\nI have to worry about reinstalling.\n\n395\n00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:01.510\nYou can also do an upgrade where they give\nyou the media, now when I say the media\n\n396\n00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:05.060\ncan be electronic form it doesn't\nnecessarily mean optical discs anymore but\n\n397\n00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:10.260\nyou purchase the media and when you\ninstall it, it wipes everything clean.\n\n398\n00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:14.220\nNow, that's still an upgrade\nbecause you typically get a cheaper\n\n399\n00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.380\nprice cuz you don't need it.\n\n400\n00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.510\nYou've got Windows 7.\n\n401\n00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:18.120\nGreat an operating system you paid for it.\n\n402\n00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.220\nWhy do you need to go to the new one.\n\n403\n00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:23.000\nSo, they give you an incentive a lot of\ntimes to go to the newer operating system\n\n404\n00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.020\nbut keep in mind when you\ndo that type of upgrade.\n\n405\n00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.380\nIf you're not worried about\nthe spring cleaning and\n\n406\n00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:32.380\nyou're not worried about losing your data,\nyou can just do a clean install.\n\n407\n00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:37.170\nWhich one you do is up to you, however,\nyou do have to know can I upgrade it all?\n\n408\n00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:38.420\nWell, let's find out.\n\n409\n00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:40.660\nStarting with Windows 7 here,\nsince Ronnie mentioned that.\n\n410\n00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:43.190\nWe'll start right here and\nI've got a little chart here.\n\n411\n00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:46.220\nAll right, I want you to know that\nif you have Windows 7 Home Basic and\n\n412\n00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.580\nHome Premium,\nyou can go to Windows 10 Home.\n\n413\n00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.050\nIf you have Windows 7 Professional and\n\n414\n00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:54.660\nWindows 7 Ultimate,\nyou can go to WIndows 10 Pro.\n\n415\n00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:59.820\nAll right, so keep in mind that if you're\ndoing an upgrade it's the underlying\n\n416\n00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:03.260\nfeatures that are in the old operating\nsystems that a lot of times dictate which\n\n417\n00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.790\none you can upgrade to after the fact,\nright?\n\n418\n00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:09.060\nYou're not gonna take an ultimate\nedition that has all the features and\n\n419\n00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.900\nthen essentially downgrade\nit to a home edition.\n\n420\n00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.600\nAll right, so\nkeep that in mind when you're in the exam.\n\n421\n00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:14.710\nBut that's just Windows 7.\n\n422\n00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:20.620\nAll right, we do have some other upgrades\nthat we wanna be aware of, all right.\n\n423\n00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:23.099\nAnd that is Windows 8.1, okay.\n\n424\n00:21:23.099 --> 00:21:27.010\nWindows 8.1, if you have what\nwas just called Windows 8.1,\n\n425\n00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:30.130\nthat means you can go to\nthe Windows 8.1 home.\n\n426\n00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:32.290\nIf you have Windows 8.1 Pro,\nit's a one to one,\n\n427\n00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:33.920\nit makes it easier to\nremember on the exam.\n\n428\n00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:34.970\nYou can go to Windows 10 Pro.\n\n429\n00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:39.220\nAnd here's another thing,\nif you have a Windows phone 8.1,\n\n430\n00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:44.210\nyou can always upgrade to Windows\n10 mobile if you want to.\n\n431\n00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:47.040\nNow, there are a couple of caveats\nwhen it comes to upgrades, and\n\n432\n00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.030\nwe want you to be aware\nof them on the exam.\n\n433\n00:21:50.572 --> 00:21:53.200\nAll right, and\nthese are a couple of specialty.\n\n434\n00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:57.270\nAnd I say specialty cuz there's\nsome things to consider.\n\n435\n00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:00.790\nThe Windows RT editions, the arm based\neditions that we had I want you to\n\n436\n00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:06.150\nunderstand even the Windows 8.1\nRT there isn't an upgrade path.\n\n437\n00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:07.780\nWe don't have RTs in Windows 10.\n\n438\n00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:11.814\nSo unfortunately, if you have one of\nthe [LAUGH] earlier RT installations,\n\n439\n00:22:11.814 --> 00:22:14.190\nyou're not gonna be running Windows 10.\n\n440\n00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:18.180\nAll right, the other thing too is keep in\nmind whether you have Windows 7 Enterprise\n\n441\n00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:21.150\nor Windows 8.1 Enterprise,\nwe can just lump these together,\n\n442\n00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:25.210\nyou can upgrade through your\nsoftware assurance licensing.\n\n443\n00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:28.330\nI can't remember the volume licensing\nthat we've talked about at the beginning.\n\n444\n00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:30.210\nYou have a contract with Microsoft.\n\n445\n00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:32.210\nAnd that's usually what they\ncall software assurance.\n\n446\n00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:33.430\nRight, Ronnie's company comes in.\n\n447\n00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:37.210\nSays I need 250 more computers\noperating systems in a single year and\n\n448\n00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:42.410\nthen two months after he buys that\nvolume licensing Windows upgrades.\n\n449\n00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:45.680\nThe software assurance says\nwhen Windows 10 upgrades\n\n450\n00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.400\nyou can move to the new operating system.\n\n451\n00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.470\nHowever, that is gonna be\nsomething that is contingent\n\n452\n00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:53.710\non the contract that you have with\nMicrosoft with a volume license.\n\n453\n00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:56.910\nThose are the upgrade paths, and that's\nsome of the upgrade paths that I would be\n\n454\n00:22:56.910 --> 00:23:00.750\nfamiliar with if you're gonna\ntackle the MTA certification exam.\n\n455\n00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:02.960\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes,\nwell that's a lot of information,\n\n456\n00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:08.050\ntaking a look at the idea of requirements,\nas well as additions and upgrades.\n\n457\n00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:10.860\nRemember that when you take a look at\nthe idea here, and you're gonna be\n\n458\n00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:14.730\nworking these on a daily basis, you have\nto know more than just understanding that\n\n459\n00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:17.980\nthere's an operating system on your\ncompute and that you're gonna be using it.\n\n460\n00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:20.630\nYou also need to understand those\ndifferent additions as well,\n\n461\n00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:23.490\nand understand that business\nmay choose one or the other.\n\n462\n00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:24.650\nAnd even an upgrade patch,\n\n463\n00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:27.430\nyou don't tend to see that more\nin a corporate environment.\n\n464\n00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:29.360\nBut you do tend to see it\nin home use environment.\n\n465\n00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:33.480\nSo, if you're gonna be supporting them\nyou may need to understand that as well.\n\n466\n00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.300\nSo Wes, thank you again for\nhelping us understand that.\n\n467\n00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:39.330\nThank you also for joining us today.\n\n468\n00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:42.250\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n469\n00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:44.680\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here at ITProTV

00:00:08.288\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.288 --> 00:00:10.859\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.246 --> 00:00:15.490\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.020\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n7\n00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.380\ntoday we're taking a look at Windows\noperating system fundamentals.\n\n8\n00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.380\nMore specifically, gonna be diving\ninto different installation types,\n\n9\n00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.350\nthat you're gonna be able to find out\nabout installing Windows onto a computer.\n\n10\n00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.590\nAnd here to help us out,\nis gonna be Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:31.670\nWes, welcome back to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.380\n&gt;&gt; Thanks, sir, as always,\nfor having me back.\n\n13\n00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.170\nThat's right it is good to be here, and\n\n14\n00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.830\nthat's Ronny's pretty much\nset the stage for us.\n\n15\n00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.490\nWe're gonna be looking\nat installation today.\n\n16\n00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.060\nAnd it's something as we've been working\nthrough the series we've been talking\n\n17\n00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.460\nabout the operating system.\n\n18\n00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.090\nWe've been talking about components\nwithin the operating system.\n\n19\n00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.580\nBut now we're gonna kinda step back.\n\n20\n00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.040\nMaybe we put the carriage in\nfront of the horse on this one,\n\n21\n00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.920\nand how do we even start out with our\noperating system if we've got a barebones\n\n22\n00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.850\nmachine, versus maybe we've got a machine\nthat's been in our company for a while.\n\n23\n00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.090\nAnd now we got Windows 10 out, and\nit's time to determine how we're gonna get\n\n24\n00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.200\nWindows 10 on some of those\nolder machines as well,\n\n25\n00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.360\nso we're gonna look at\na couple of different things.\n\n26\n00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.380\nOne of the first things we're\ngonna look at is how do we install\n\n27\n00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.280\nthe operating system?\n\n28\n00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.391\nWhat are the methods\nthat we have available?\n\n29\n00:01:16.391 --> 00:01:19.783\nAnd there are few different types and\ndepending on what scenario you are in,\n\n30\n00:01:19.783 --> 00:01:21.436\nyou might choose one over the other.\n\n31\n00:01:21.436 --> 00:01:25.729\nBut then we're gonna look at not only\nhow you get it installed but methods,\n\n32\n00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.548\nthe methodology, cuz there\nare different types of installations\n\n33\n00:01:29.548 --> 00:01:32.640\nregardless of how you\ninstall the operating system.\n\n34\n00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.740\nThere are some different types,\nand we wanna look at those, too,\n\n35\n00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.030\nbecause they can differ very greatly\ndepending on the scenario and\n\n36\n00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.710\nsituation you're in which might be\nsomething that you see on the exam.\n\n37\n00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.424\nIt's not gonna be a one size fits all.\n\n38\n00:01:44.424 --> 00:01:46.950\nThere are gonna be different scenarios and\nyou might have to be aware of them.\n\n39\n00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.990\nSo those are a couple of the things that\nwe're gonna take care of in this episode.\n\n40\n00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.590\n&gt;&gt; All right Wes.\n\n41\n00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.530\nSo when I began first in working with\ncomputers and installing an operating\n\n42\n00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.091\nsystem, it was simply a series of\nfloppy discs that I had to follow,\n\n43\n00:01:59.091 --> 00:02:02.860\nand it just kinda told you disc one,\ndisc two, disc three, disc four.\n\n44\n00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.479\nI don't seem to actually recall call\nfloppy disks happening anymore but\n\n45\n00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.500\nisn't it just the same process?\n\n46\n00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.810\n&gt;&gt; You know it really isn't much different\nyou know if you want to take you people\n\n47\n00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.680\nare saying really floppy disk.\n\n48\n00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.220\nWhat are you crazy Wes,\nit is a lot different.\n\n49\n00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.250\nWell what is a floppy disc?\n\n50\n00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.820\nLet's think very basically, right?\n\n51\n00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.230\nWhat is a floppy disc?\n\n52\n00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.130\nFor some of you that don't know it,\nyou might have to go to a museum, right?\n\n53\n00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.510\nBut it's removable media.\n\n54\n00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.540\nThat's what it boils down to.\n\n55\n00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.230\nIt's removable media, and\nthat installation type still exists today.\n\n56\n00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.630\nIt's the medium itself that's\nchanged a little bit but\n\n57\n00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.300\nwhen it boils down to it, we today have\nwhat are known as our DVDs, right?\n\n58\n00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.880\nWe don't have floppies and that's okay.\n\n59\n00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.580\nAnd they moved in to CDs and\nas the capacities grow, who knows?\n\n60\n00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.100\nAnother five years maybe we'll be saying,\nhey, you're gonna install on Blu-Ray disk.\n\n61\n00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.690\nI'm not sure.\n\n62\n00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.698\nBut it comes down to optical\nmedia as one of the ways.\n\n63\n00:02:48.698 --> 00:02:50.430\nIn fact I had little diagram here.\n\n64\n00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.670\nLet's look at this real quick.\n\n65\n00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.310\nThree of the major installation medias,\n\n66\n00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.360\nif you will, are going to be, it really\nboils down to these three, right?\n\n67\n00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.480\nThe first two, though, are really just\nreminiscent back to those days when you\n\n68\n00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.040\nhad to create an install\noff of a floppy disk.\n\n69\n00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.730\nWhy?\n\n70\n00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.465\nWell, CDs, think about it,\nagain it's a removable media.\n\n71\n00:03:09.465 --> 00:03:12.180\nNow this one is one that yes,\nyou can still have it.\n\n72\n00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.560\nYou still have it a lot out there but\nit might even be kind of\n\n73\n00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.060\ngoing the way of the Dodo bird, if you\nwill, just because everything's electronic\n\n74\n00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.740\ntoday if you think about it, we store\na lot of information in the Cloud today.\n\n75\n00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.540\nBut it's still available, still handy, and\n\n76\n00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.910\nit's still something that you might\ncome into and encounter, right.\n\n77\n00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.890\nWe talk about the CD,\nall right, I say CD, DVDs.\n\n78\n00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.165\nAnd let me be very clear on that,\nwhy it's a DVD and it's not a CD.\n\n79\n00:03:35.165 --> 00:03:39.670\nAnd that's the size of\nthe operating systems today.\n\n80\n00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.000\nEven with them being in alter\npacked kind of archived type\n\n81\n00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.380\nfile that we call a WIN file.\n\n82\n00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.610\nWhich is basically, just think about\nit as the Windows image format where\n\n83\n00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.810\nyou can just pack a whole bunch of\ndifferent components in there essentially\n\n84\n00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.240\nthat come out to be\na full operating system.\n\n85\n00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.030\nBut even at being ultra compact we're\nstill talking about three gigs.\n\n86\n00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.530\nSo you're operating systems\ndon't fit on the floppy for\n\n87\n00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.350\nsure and they don't fit on CDs either.\n\n88\n00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.230\nSo today if it is going to be an optical\nmedia it's going to be a DVD just because\n\n89\n00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.710\nof the DVDs the average size of\nthem are four and a half gigs or\n\n90\n00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.285\n4.7 gigs you know I believe is what\nthe you know, one side DVD is.\n\n91\n00:04:18.285 --> 00:04:20.810\nSo you can still fit\nthe entire operating system,\n\n92\n00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.552\nat least at the time of the recording\nyou could still fit it on a single DVD.\n\n93\n00:04:24.552 --> 00:04:28.640\nBut again as things progress\nwe might see things change.\n\n94\n00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.169\nAnd we'll talk a little bit\nmore about these guys and\n\n95\n00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.080\nwhat makes each one unique and\nwhere you'll see it.\n\n96\n00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.560\nBut then the next one is still\nremovable media as well right.\n\n97\n00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.760\nNow, we're just talking about\nelectronic storage device, right.\n\n98\n00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.580\nA usb, a usb drive, right.\n\n99\n00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.122\nThere are programs out there and\n\n100\n00:04:43.122 --> 00:04:46.774\nthere are third party programs that help\nyou to do this too but you also have,\n\n101\n00:04:46.774 --> 00:04:50.795\nthings like inside of your deployment\ntechnologies that you have an enterprises.\n\n102\n00:04:50.795 --> 00:04:55.988\nWhere you can literally, Microsoft gives\nyou the ability to take your operating\n\n103\n00:04:55.988 --> 00:05:01.097\nsystem and put it on a USB drive, and then\nmake it bootable so that when you plug it\n\n104\n00:05:01.097 --> 00:05:06.970\ninto the machine, you can run your\ninstallation software right from that USB.\n\n105\n00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.270\nNow, another one that we have access\nto is a network installation.\n\n106\n00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.670\nAnd a network installation\nhas changed over the years,\n\n107\n00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.120\nit's got a lot more efficient\ntoday through services like WDS.\n\n108\n00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.862\nSorry for the alphabet soup right away,\nWindows Deployment Services.\n\n109\n00:05:20.862 --> 00:05:24.228\nIt's something that you see in\nan enterprise level environment and\n\n110\n00:05:24.228 --> 00:05:27.140\nwe'll talk a little bit\nabout that one as well.\n\n111\n00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.110\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nlet's kinda revert all the way\n\n112\n00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.940\nback to the optical drive that\nRonnie first mentioned, all right.\n\n113\n00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.650\nSo when we look at the installation\nmethods, right, we look at DVD.\n\n114\n00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.050\nDVD, it's nothing wrong with\nthis installation method.\n\n115\n00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.440\nBut you have to keep in mind, this is\na completely decentralized method, right?\n\n116\n00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.490\nIf we think about what\nyou're having to do.\n\n117\n00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.920\nYou're having to take your optical media.\n\n118\n00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.010\nFirst you have to obtain\nyour optical media and\n\n119\n00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.040\nhow would you go about doing that?\n\n120\n00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.860\nWell, typically you're gonna go to a third\nparty reseller, and you're gonna buy a box\n\n121\n00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.079\nthat says Windows 10, and hopefully\nthey'll give you your installation media.\n\n122\n00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.850\nNow, it is a local installation type,\nwhich means I have to have the physical\n\n123\n00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.670\nmedia, I have to walk over,\nI have to do our old sneaker net, right?\n\n124\n00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.730\nNo network here, and I have to\nphysically put the optical disk in,\n\n125\n00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.730\nnot the cup holder, but the drive tray.\n\n126\n00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:18.470\nAnd, Ronnie,\n\n127\n00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.540\nyou could probably see that with the\ndecentralization of this It's kinda can\n\n128\n00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.710\nbecome very complex if you happened\nto be in a larger environment, right?\n\n129\n00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you think about it,\nthe very fact is I have to move that DVD\n\n130\n00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.450\nfrom one machine to another one and\nafter a while, if you're like me,\n\n131\n00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:38.170\nyou kind of drop it a couple of times,\nyou slide it across the desk.\n\n132\n00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:42.160\nYou might find out that after a little bit\nof time it might not work as efficiently\n\n133\n00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.720\nanymore, as well.\n\n134\n00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.790\nSo even though this is kinda the media\ntype that really has become popular\n\n135\n00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.980\nbecause of the capacity of the thing.\n\n136\n00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.050\nThe problem is you do,\n\n137\n00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.760\nyou have to worry about the media surface\nitself and keeping that thing pristine.\n\n138\n00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.980\nNow, Wes I do have another question,\nthough.\n\n139\n00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.297\nOkay, even though I have a DVD.\n\n140\n00:07:00.297 --> 00:07:05.150\nWell, on the laptop in front of me\nright now, there is no DVD drive.\n\n141\n00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:11.640\nSo I would at least need to be able to\nget an external DVD drive before I can\n\n142\n00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:16.490\nactually even install it on my computer on\nmy laptop, is that my only option then?\n\n143\n00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.180\n&gt;&gt; Well, if you are going with\nan optical media installation,\n\n144\n00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.560\nabsolutely that really\nis your only option.\n\n145\n00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.340\nYou have to have a USB\nexternal DVD reader,\n\n146\n00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.750\nif you will, to be able to\ninstall the operating system.\n\n147\n00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.980\nAnd that's another thing, and\nI'm glad you mentioned it.\n\n148\n00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:35.070\nThat's another thing that's making this\nchallenging as an installation source is\n\n149\n00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:36.900\nwell, we've got computers\nall over the place.\n\n150\n00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.110\nIn fact, we've got some older computers\nnow that are old by computer standards\n\n151\n00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:43.450\nthat are two or three years old and they\ndidn't even come with an optical tray.\n\n152\n00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.890\nSo not to mention some of the ones that\nwe have now that are a little bit more\n\n153\n00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:50.330\nmodern, so\nthat does make it even more of a problem.\n\n154\n00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.420\nProblematic if you wanna say for\nsomething that's a larger industry and\n\n155\n00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:55.660\nreally even in the home environment.\n\n156\n00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.342\nSo you'd have to have one of those.\n\n157\n00:07:57.342 --> 00:08:00.302\nUnderstand that this kind of deployment\nmethod is, if you say deployment,\n\n158\n00:08:00.302 --> 00:08:02.260\njust understand that\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n159\n00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.787\nWe use these Terms in the enterprises,\ninstalling an operating system.\n\n160\n00:08:06.787 --> 00:08:09.190\nWhen you say a deployment,\ntypically you mean more than one.\n\n161\n00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.450\nSo these are good for SOHO environments.\n\n162\n00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:15.054\nSmall environments where maybe you might\njust be, might be your family members,\n\n163\n00:08:15.054 --> 00:08:17.630\nit might even be supporting a very,\nvery small business.\n\n164\n00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.599\nSo it'll work for those type of scenarios.\n\n165\n00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:24.310\nOne of the problems you'll also\nrun into is configuration, right?\n\n166\n00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.470\nWe have to configure our operating\nsystems, and the thing about doing\n\n167\n00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:31.490\nthe installation here is individually\nyou are doing these installations.\n\n168\n00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.640\nAnd I'll tell you Ronnie, you guys have\nseen me, I can't type to save my life.\n\n169\n00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.470\nIt's been very easy to make mistakes and\nthen have to go back and configure these\n\n170\n00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:43.140\nand change these configurations\nonce you notice the mistakes.\n\n171\n00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:46.205\nThe other problem is in\nthe decentralized model like this,\n\n172\n00:08:46.205 --> 00:08:50.030\nit's very hard to monitor\nthe installation process.\n\n173\n00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:54.890\nHow do I know if an installation\nhas been successful?\n\n174\n00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:58.530\nWell, if I'm getting up to about five\ncomputers, get past five computers,\n\n175\n00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.390\nmaybe even on up to just about ten,\npretty much the limit for\n\n176\n00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:05.260\na SOHO environment, It becomes problematic\nas well to figure out which ones have\n\n177\n00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.460\ninstalled correctly and\nwhat happens if you have a problem, right?\n\n178\n00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.730\nWell, you're gonna find out after the fact\nby going back to each one of those\n\n179\n00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:17.320\ncomputers and looking at\nthe progress of the installation.\n\n180\n00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.974\nNow, Ronnie also mentioned,\ndo we have any alternatives?\n\n181\n00:09:20.974 --> 00:09:24.220\nIf you're going for\noptical DVD or optical drives,\n\n182\n00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:29.692\nyou really don't have another alternative\nother than getting an external DVD reader.\n\n183\n00:09:29.692 --> 00:09:32.582\nNow, if you're not\nlimited to only the DVD,\n\n184\n00:09:32.582 --> 00:09:38.630\nthat's where the other option comes in,\nthe next option that we'll talk about.\n\n185\n00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.600\nAnd this is USB, all right?\n\n186\n00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.960\nSo, even though we don't have\noptical trace on our machines,\n\n187\n00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:48.890\nwe tend to have one or two,\nif not more, USB ports, all right?.\n\n188\n00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:50.350\nNow, let me go ahead and\n\n189\n00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.470\nkinda paraphrase this because just because\nyou have a USB port doesn't mean that\n\n190\n00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:57.630\nyou can install your operating system\nvia USB, and what do I mean by that?\n\n191\n00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:01.550\nYou have to boot into the BIOS or the UEFI\ndepending on how new your system is, and\n\n192\n00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:05.220\nyou have to determine if the BIOS\nsupports booting to USB, all right?\n\n193\n00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.970\nSo that's gonna be a deal breaker.\n\n194\n00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:10.456\nIf it doesn't support that, you're gonna\ngo back to what Ronnie was saying,\n\n195\n00:10:10.456 --> 00:10:13.030\nwe have to get that\nexternal optical drive.\n\n196\n00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:14.930\nNow, this is also a local installation,\n\n197\n00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:19.280\nit's really no different in theory when\nyou take the media's changes, right?\n\n198\n00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.140\nI've got a DVD or I've got a USB drive.\n\n199\n00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.990\nWhen it comes down to it guys,\nit's the same thing.\n\n200\n00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:28.030\nAgain, you could see all the same\ntype of little points here that it's\n\n201\n00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:31.190\nchallenging to monitor,\nit doesn't scale up very large, and\n\n202\n00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:34.490\nit also requires the USB\ndrive preparation.\n\n203\n00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:37.890\nNow, I know what you're thinking, you're\nsaying, man, we gotta prepare the drives?\n\n204\n00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:42.030\nWe've got a lot of third party systems\nout there, or software that'll do that.\n\n205\n00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.300\nYou don't have to worry about that on the\nMTA, but you can also do this through some\n\n206\n00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:49.870\nof the automation kits you have\ninside of an enterprise environment.\n\n207\n00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:52.090\nBut see, then that begs the question,\n\n208\n00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:55.580\nwhy would I just not do\nan enterprise level deployment?\n\n209\n00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:56.660\nAnd again, there's the catch-22,\n\n210\n00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:00.270\nyou can get some access to some\nof these tools that you can use.\n\n211\n00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:03.020\nDrop down to a command prompt,\ndrop down to a command line,\n\n212\n00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:06.050\nrun a couple of commands and\nmake the USB bootable.\n\n213\n00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:10.350\nHowever, keep in mind, it's not as easy\nas just throwing an optical drive in, or\n\n214\n00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:13.640\na DVD in an optical drive and\njust pushing a couple buttons.\n\n215\n00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.873\nYou have to know what you're doing\nin order to be able to install this.\n\n216\n00:11:16.873 --> 00:11:18.524\nAnd more specifically,\n\n217\n00:11:18.524 --> 00:11:22.459\nyou have to know what to do with\nthe USB drive to even make it.\n\n218\n00:11:22.459 --> 00:11:26.660\nAlso how are we gonna get an operating\nsystem on that USB drive?\n\n219\n00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:27.520\nAnd that's another thing.\n\n220\n00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.590\nAnd that brings me into a point\nthat you don't really see up here.\n\n221\n00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:32.635\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and mention it.\n\n222\n00:11:32.635 --> 00:11:35.300\nThat another way that you can\nget access to the operating\n\n223\n00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.210\nsystem is through an industry\nstandard we call ISO file, right?\n\n224\n00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.790\nAn ISO file, I-S-O,\nit's essentially a bootable,\n\n225\n00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:44.990\nit's really nothing more than a container\nbut we use it to boot operating systems.\n\n226\n00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:47.190\nAnd we can apply that to the USB drive.\n\n227\n00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:50.270\nSo now you start to see there's a little\nbit more of a complexity when it comes\n\n228\n00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:52.920\nto using this even though it's\na great installation style,\n\n229\n00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.840\nbecause you're using solid state drive,\nyou're using electronic storage.\n\n230\n00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.550\nSo you might even see that your\nperformance on the installation is\n\n231\n00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:03.008\na little bit better but then again\nit's not gonna scale up very well.\n\n232\n00:12:03.008 --> 00:12:06.520\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, the only thing I really\nheard you list there and it was great\n\n233\n00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:10.670\nbecause we understand now that we have\nan option, but, it just sounds complex.\n\n234\n00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:14.875\nSo, is there any other reason besides\nthe idea of just saying, okay,\n\n235\n00:12:14.875 --> 00:12:17.533\nI might get better\nperformance out of this.\n\n236\n00:12:17.533 --> 00:12:21.393\nThat I would choose USB\nover just an optical drive?\n\n237\n00:12:21.393 --> 00:12:25.312\n&gt;&gt; Well, honestly I don't really have\none that comes to mind other than\n\n238\n00:12:25.312 --> 00:12:28.284\nthe fact that,\nI like to use the USB just in general,\n\n239\n00:12:28.284 --> 00:12:32.680\nbecause of the fact that it's easier for\nme to carry a USB drive.\n\n240\n00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.760\nAnd remember what Ronnie\nsaid about the media?\n\n241\n00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.330\nThink about the media.\n\n242\n00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:37.840\nThe media one little scratch,\nsorry [LAUGH].\n\n243\n00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.290\nYou're gonna have to convince Microsoft or\n\n244\n00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:43.600\nyour third party reseller\nthat you need another DVD.\n\n245\n00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.260\nAnd that doesn't usually work because\nit's tied to a license on each media.\n\n246\n00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:51.310\nNow, if I put it on USB drive,\nand I've got an ISO format,\n\n247\n00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:52.860\nwhich is just electronic file anyway.\n\n248\n00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:56.590\nAnd something goes wrong with\nthe USB drive, which happens, right?\n\n249\n00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:58.630\nI was born with two left feet.\n\n250\n00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:01.620\nYou guys probably don't know\non camera how graceful I am,\n\n251\n00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.610\nbut you could drop a USB drive,\ncause a problem.\n\n252\n00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:05.200\nBut as long as you have\nthat electronic file,\n\n253\n00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.290\nyou can always apply it\nback to another USB drive.\n\n254\n00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.480\nSo that's one of the great\nthings about having the USB.\n\n255\n00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:16.790\nNow, I did mention you can go to,\nif you have enterprise level tools,\n\n256\n00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:20.300\nyou can get in there, you can grab a piece\nof software that'll allow you to drop\n\n257\n00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:24.660\ndown to the command prompt and copy\nover the installation files to the USB.\n\n258\n00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:28.180\nBut at that point if you've already got\naccess to enterprise level technologies,\n\n259\n00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.240\nthe first two are probably\nnot going to be your option.\n\n260\n00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.060\nIn fact, most likely aren't\ngoing to be your option.\n\n261\n00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.710\nAnd that's where we get into what's\nknown as a network installation.\n\n262\n00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:37.970\nNow network installations have\ndefinitely progressed, and\n\n263\n00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:40.670\nI'm kind of blessed in the fact that,\nwhen I got into them,\n\n264\n00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:43.660\nthey already had some technologies\nthat were built into Microsoft.\n\n265\n00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:48.090\nOr not built into Microsoft, but Microsoft\ndeployed some technologies that allow\n\n266\n00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:51.899\nus to get these operating systems out\nto the machines over the network.\n\n267\n00:13:51.899 --> 00:13:54.967\nIn the earlier days it was just a folder,\nand you would connect to it and\n\n268\n00:13:54.967 --> 00:13:57.985\nover time you would pull down a file,\nand that would be one computer.\n\n269\n00:13:57.985 --> 00:14:02.350\nAnd you hope you have enough bandwidth,\nbut they have gotten better.\n\n270\n00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:03.450\nThis allows for\n\n271\n00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:09.810\na much larger scale of operating\nsystems to be deployed or installed.\n\n272\n00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:13.080\nJust use that term deploy,\ninstall in your mind.\n\n273\n00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.310\nWe could do thousands of computers, right?\n\n274\n00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.586\nAnd, in fact, Ronnie and\nI used to work for\n\n275\n00:14:17.586 --> 00:14:21.270\nan organization that we would do\n40 computers times, what was it?\n\n276\n00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:25.676\n20 computers times 5, so we've got 100\ncomputers that we could do in a night,\n\n277\n00:14:25.676 --> 00:14:26.900\nin one night.\n\n278\n00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.460\nCome back the next morning and\n\n279\n00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:31.222\nwe can start to do with\nthe process of automation.\n\n280\n00:14:31.222 --> 00:14:33.290\nAll right,\nnow this is a very complex setup and\n\n281\n00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:35.570\nit's not one that they call\nout on the MTA exam, but\n\n282\n00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:39.020\nwe wouldn't be doing you any justice if we\ndidn't talk about the things that as you\n\n283\n00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:42.690\nprogressed through your training,\nyou're definitely going to run into.\n\n284\n00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:45.470\nIt's a centralized installation\nmethod when you've used some of\n\n285\n00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:48.520\nthe utilities that Microsoft\nhas provided us, like WDS.\n\n286\n00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.580\nWhat is WDS?\n\n287\n00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:54.500\nIt's a role that is on a server and\nwhat happens is your computers, if\n\n288\n00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:58.540\nthey support something known as PXE boot,\nthe pre execution environment, a little\n\n289\n00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:02.422\nbit of firmware that gets loaded to small\nTCPIP stack in the network adaptor.\n\n290\n00:15:02.422 --> 00:15:03.810\nAnd it just calls out to the network and\n\n291\n00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:06.150\nsays, hey,\nanybody out there got an operating system?\n\n292\n00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:07.540\nI could really use one.\n\n293\n00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:11.370\nAnd that server out there, that again,\nMicrosoft has provided the technology,\n\n294\n00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:12.830\nif you've got it set up is listening out.\n\n295\n00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:14.650\nIt says, yeah,\nI gotta an operating system here.\n\n296\n00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:17.710\nLet me just check my database and my\nconfigurations on which one I'm gonna give\n\n297\n00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:22.130\nyou, and you can get that operating\nsystem over the network, all right?\n\n298\n00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.610\nBut, again, it has its benefits, but\n\n299\n00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:27.190\nit also has its drawbacks in the fact\nthat it's not just as simple as\n\n300\n00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:30.570\ntaking an installation media and\nplugging in into a machine.\n\n301\n00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:32.160\nYou have to know the components behind it.\n\n302\n00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.213\nIt's a pretty large setup and\nit's typically used in the enterprise\n\n303\n00:15:35.213 --> 00:15:38.190\nenvironment where we need to install\noperating systems, we need a way to\n\n304\n00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:42.190\nmonitor it and we also need a way to\ndo a lot of systems at a single time.\n\n305\n00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:45.610\nSo network installations, they're gonna\nbe the ones that you're gonna typically\n\n306\n00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:47.390\nuse in your corporate environments.\n\n307\n00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:51.486\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, since you and I have used\nthis before, another great benefit\n\n308\n00:15:51.486 --> 00:15:56.349\nof using something like WDS here, some\ntype of deployment system that's actually\n\n309\n00:15:56.349 --> 00:16:00.724\navailable to us out there, is that we\ncan actually customize it a bit more,\n\n310\n00:16:00.724 --> 00:16:04.909\nwhich is what we tend to do inside of\nsome type of business environment.\n\n311\n00:16:04.909 --> 00:16:07.831\nSo Wes, just like what we were talking\nabout, we can install an operating system,\n\n312\n00:16:07.831 --> 00:16:10.810\nbut even once I've installed it,\nthere's still some configuration.\n\n313\n00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:14.320\nBut also,\nI might need some additional applications.\n\n314\n00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:19.030\nWith the use of WDS, we can create\na custom type of installation.\n\n315\n00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:23.420\nAnd Wes, how does that save us time\nin terms of applications and things?\n\n316\n00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:24.560\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question.\n\n317\n00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.000\nThink about this,\nthink about I have a production computer.\n\n318\n00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.290\nYou're sitting at your computer right now,\nright?\n\n319\n00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:31.030\nJust take deployment completely out of it,\n\n320\n00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:33.140\nI don't even want you to\nworry about installation.\n\n321\n00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.040\nYou're sitting at your computer for\nthe first time.\n\n322\n00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.440\nYou've got all of your\nbusiness line of applications.\n\n323\n00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.650\nThis is a nice just a pristine\ncomputer ready to go.\n\n324\n00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:41.800\nAll right, now,\n\n325\n00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.490\nI want you to take that computer and think\nabout taking it off of the network, right?\n\n326\n00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:49.100\nIt's the way you want it,\nit's got all the applications you need.\n\n327\n00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:53.010\nIt's even got the configurations that are\nrelevant to your corporate environment.\n\n328\n00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:54.940\nAnd what we do is we take a picture of it.\n\n329\n00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.290\nNow, do I break out the Canon?\n\n330\n00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:57.920\nNo, I'm not a photographer.\n\n331\n00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.760\nBut what we're meaning is we use\nthat as a reference computer, and\n\n332\n00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:05.840\nthat reference computer essentially\nbecomes the copy, right, the clone, right,\n\n333\n00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:08.000\nwell we're gonna make some clones here,\nwe're going clone wars here.\n\n334\n00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.220\nWe're gonna make a copy of that initial,\nwhat they call a reference computer.\n\n335\n00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:17.470\nAnd then, when we put that image that\nit creates which is an installation.\n\n336\n00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.100\nIt's an installation of\nan operating system.\n\n337\n00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:21.820\nBut it goes a little bit farther\nthan basic installation,\n\n338\n00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:26.730\ncuz all of those applications\nare preloaded into the image itself,\n\n339\n00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:30.470\ninto the installation, so\nthat when I pull the machine down,\n\n340\n00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:34.490\nI don't have to do what I'd have to with\na DVD or with a USB, and go back and\n\n341\n00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:38.510\nreinstall all of the applications,\nmake the configurations.\n\n342\n00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:41.200\nThose applications are prebaked\ninto this installation, and\n\n343\n00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.880\nwhen we set it, we can just let it go and\nit's pretty much ready for us.\n\n344\n00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.650\nNow, Ronnie alluded to something else too,\nit was configurations.\n\n345\n00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:53.034\nThat'd be nice if your computers\ncontact that server and\n\n346\n00:17:53.034 --> 00:17:55.600\nthey say I'm a Optiplex 745.\n\n347\n00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.220\nAnd then it says okay, I've got 745's.\n\n348\n00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:01.040\nAnd you need drivers that\nare specific to your machine.\n\n349\n00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.750\nIn fact, I've got those here.\n\n350\n00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:04.620\nLet's go ahead and hand those to you.\n\n351\n00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:08.490\nAnd you can install your drivers\nduring the installation.\n\n352\n00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:12.930\nBut then we've got another machine that\ncalls out and says hey, I'm a 740.\n\n353\n00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:16.470\nOur server says, I've got a listing for\n740s, you don't need the drivers for\n\n354\n00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:17.630\n745s, they're not the same.\n\n355\n00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:19.300\nHere's the drivers for 740s.\n\n356\n00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:22.060\nNow you might say,\nwell why is that a problem?\n\n357\n00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.240\nLet's go ahead and\nstep back to the installation part,\n\n358\n00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.990\nwhen we're doing decentralized methods.\n\n359\n00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:28.340\nI have to have the drivers handy.\n\n360\n00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.610\nAnd they're usually a post\ninstallation thing.\n\n361\n00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:34.140\nA lot of times we don't put\ndrivers in unless it requires\n\n362\n00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:37.360\nbeing able to identify the storage\ndevice that we're installing on.\n\n363\n00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:40.020\nIf your computer doesn't\nrecognize the hard drive,\n\n364\n00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.770\nthe operating system isn't gonna install.\n\n365\n00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:43.920\nBut usually we do this after the fact.\n\n366\n00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:47.510\nWouldn't it be nice that when you install\nyour operating system, the moment you sit\n\n367\n00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:50.610\ndown, all you have to do is log in and\nyou're ready to go to work.\n\n368\n00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:53.420\nThat's one of the things that also\nmakes the network installation\n\n369\n00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.720\nprobably the most efficient and\n\n370\n00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:59.710\none of the most common installation\nmechanisms inside of businesses.\n\n371\n00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:03.780\nNow, the other thing we have to talk\nabout are the types of installations.\n\n372\n00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:04.720\nThese are the methods.\n\n373\n00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.840\nThese are the method to the madness,\nall right?\n\n374\n00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:11.620\nAnd when it comes to\nthe type of installation,\n\n375\n00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.060\nwe've got a few different types.\n\n376\n00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:17.330\ni've got another little diagram here\nthat will hopefully help us out.\n\n377\n00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:19.247\nAll right, these are the categories.\n\n378\n00:19:19.247 --> 00:19:21.195\nWhat's known as a clean installation.\n\n379\n00:19:21.195 --> 00:19:23.709\nWhat's known as an upgrade\ninstallation and\n\n380\n00:19:23.709 --> 00:19:26.500\nthen what is known finally as a migration.\n\n381\n00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.770\nI said migration install.\n\n382\n00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:30.770\nTypically they just call\nit a migration guys, but\n\n383\n00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:34.370\nin the context of installations keep\nin mind you are installing Windows 10.\n\n384\n00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:36.260\nSo what are the differences?\n\n385\n00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:40.610\nWell, a clean install, there's a couple\nof reasons you have to do this.\n\n386\n00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:43.760\nOne, if you don't care about your files,\nsome people I know Ronnie and I,\n\n387\n00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.210\nwhen we're building a machine we\ndon't like a lot of remnants before.\n\n388\n00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:49.820\nWhen we're testing stuff out\nwe like a nice clean machine,\n\n389\n00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.950\nready to go, ready for me to break.\n\n390\n00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:55.780\nAll right now just kidding, but I don't\ncare about anything that was on it before.\n\n391\n00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:57.040\nSo when I do a clean install,\n\n392\n00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:00.880\nthe reason it's called clean install\nis it completely wipes the hard drive.\n\n393\n00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.640\nAny data that was on that\nstorage medium prior to\n\n394\n00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.550\nyou doing the installation\nis going to be lost.\n\n395\n00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:07.420\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n396\n00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:10.220\nNow where is a scenario\nwhere I might use that?\n\n397\n00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.840\nWell one scenario, like I just said,\nis that you want a nice, fresh,\n\n398\n00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.550\nclean install.\n\n399\n00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:17.750\nAnd you don't have a problem with\nloading up software after the fact.\n\n400\n00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:22.100\nThe other thing happens, too, is when you\ndo what's known as an upgrade, all right?\n\n401\n00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:26.630\nA lot of times, and we've got an episode\nthat talks about upgrades, you typically\n\n402\n00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:31.580\nget a cheaper price if you've already\ngot an existing operating system.\n\n403\n00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.980\nAll right, now in that episode,\njust as a real quick recap,\n\n404\n00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:37.340\nwe talked about an upgrade as being a way\nto take an old operating system and\n\n405\n00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.750\ninstalling the new one over it.\n\n406\n00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:44.110\nWell if you've got what's known as a valid\nupgrade path, right, and check those\n\n407\n00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:48.450\nepisodes out if you're not aware and\nthen come back and look at this episode.\n\n408\n00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:50.980\nIf you don't have a valid upgrade path,\n\n409\n00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:54.020\ndo you get to benefit from the cheaper\ninstall or the cheaper price?\n\n410\n00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:55.400\nAnd the answer is yes.\n\n411\n00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.930\nIf I've got a XP machine, great operating\nsystem even though they don't support it,\n\n412\n00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:01.060\nit's still out there,\nit's still chugging along.\n\n413\n00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:05.310\nBut it doesn't have the underlying\narchitecture that Windows 10 has.\n\n414\n00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:06.900\nSo in order to do your upgrade,\n\n415\n00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:08.800\nyou have to make sure you\nformat your operating system.\n\n416\n00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.390\nYou have to start clean.\n\n417\n00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:13.170\nRight, so there's too much time\nbetween these operating systems.\n\n418\n00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:16.700\nAnd there's no way I can wrap the new\narchitecture around the old, so\n\n419\n00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.630\nI have to format the drive, all right.\n\n420\n00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:21.780\nBut then that takes us\nto the upgrade install.\n\n421\n00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.270\nThe upgrade install,\njust like we've mentioned before,\n\n422\n00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:28.560\nis exactly that,\nwhere you have something like Windows 7.\n\n423\n00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.150\nYou have something like Windows\n8.1 where the architecture's\n\n424\n00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:33.570\naren't too much different.\n\n425\n00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:35.170\nI mean there's more bells and\nwhistles, but\n\n426\n00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:39.080\nthe underlying architecture is\npretty much the same, all right.\n\n427\n00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.680\nAnd what I do is I purchase\nmy new operating system,\n\n428\n00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.660\nI don't want to lose my files,\nI don't want to lose my applications and\n\n429\n00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:47.100\nI essentially install\nthe operating system, a new one,\n\n430\n00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:50.550\nWindows 10 in this case, over the old one\nwhether it be Windows 7 or Windows 8.1.\n\n431\n00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:54.580\nAnd pay attention to mobile out there\nguys, because they also have options for\n\n432\n00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.230\nWindows 8 mobile.\n\n433\n00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:59.240\nThe last one is what's known as a migrate,\na migration.\n\n434\n00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:03.500\nNow, I put migration, install it for the\npurposes of you've never seen it before.\n\n435\n00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:06.510\nIf you go up on TechNet's website,\nyou go to Microsoft Documentation,\n\n436\n00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:08.130\nthey're going to call it a migration,\nguys.\n\n437\n00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:10.284\nBut, just understand\nthat that's what it is.\n\n438\n00:22:10.284 --> 00:22:10.910\nIt's an install.\n\n439\n00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:15.550\nBut, the difference between this\none is maybe I can't upgrade.\n\n440\n00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:16.150\nAll right?\n\n441\n00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:19.260\nMaybe I can't do the in\nplace upgrade where I wrap\n\n442\n00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.710\nthe new system over the old system,\nall right?\n\n443\n00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:22.740\nBut I still want my data.\n\n444\n00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:24.870\nThis is not a back up.\n\n445\n00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:27.310\nUnderstand, none of this\nreplaces good back ups.\n\n446\n00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:29.480\nYou should have back ups\nbefore you start any of this.\n\n447\n00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.200\nBut the migration says,\n\n448\n00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.500\nlet me take certain components\nwithin the old operating system and\n\n449\n00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:39.140\nI'll scrape them off of it and I'll put\nit in a store, an intermediate store.\n\n450\n00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.960\nIn which I can turn around later and\n\n451\n00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:45.490\nafter the installation is done, I can pull\nthat information back down to the machine.\n\n452\n00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.890\nThat's a migration, and again,\nthis is a little bit more complex, but\n\n453\n00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:51.260\nsometimes it needs to be done.\n\n454\n00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:54.940\nAnd in a corporate environment where,\nlet's say Ronnie's got a laptop.\n\n455\n00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:56.250\nHe's been traveling, right?\n\n456\n00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:58.830\nHe's been doing teaching all over the US,\nright?\n\n457\n00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:02.880\nGot contacts, got information,\ngot files on there and\n\n458\n00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.300\nnow we need to get him a new\noperating system on his laptop.\n\n459\n00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.990\nWell we don't wanna lose that information,\nso by using a migration, we can take his\n\n460\n00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:13.060\ninformation off of there, and then we\ncan install the new operating system.\n\n461\n00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:16.020\nWe can connect to where we've stored it,\nwe can pull it down to the new machine,\n\n462\n00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.620\nand now he's got access to his data.\n\n463\n00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.150\nSo that's actually something that I\nwant to show you here real quick.\n\n464\n00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:25.580\nYou know we talked a lot about\nthe installations, the install types.\n\n465\n00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:28.450\nWe're gonna take you through a couple\nof different installation types guys,\n\n466\n00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:30.340\ncuz I really want you guys to see this.\n\n467\n00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:33.260\nWe've talked about it but\nlet's go ahead and let's dive in.\n\n468\n00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.800\nThe first one I want to talk about and\n\n469\n00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.520\nI've actually got\na Windows 8.1 machine here.\n\n470\n00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:42.260\nAll right, I wanna show you how\nwe would initiate the migration.\n\n471\n00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:43.140\nOkay?\n\n472\n00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:46.440\nSo keep in mind that they're probably\nnot gonna ask you too much of\n\n473\n00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.370\nthe individual pieces in here.\n\n474\n00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:50.840\nBut if you've never seen a migration,\nyou gotta see it.\n\n475\n00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.690\nIt's pretty awesome, it is pretty cool.\n\n476\n00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:56.770\nAnd if you're going on to additional\ntracks, things like MCSA and Windows 10,\n\n477\n00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:58.820\nyou will have to know\na little bit more about this.\n\n478\n00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:03.546\nSo what we do, is we get the components,\nsomething called the USMT,\n\n479\n00:24:03.546 --> 00:24:05.508\nuser state migration tool.\n\n480\n00:24:05.508 --> 00:24:06.217\nWe.\n\n481\n00:24:06.217 --> 00:24:09.838\nPoll them down to the machine that\nwe need to save our settings, right?\n\n482\n00:24:09.838 --> 00:24:12.920\nSo you could say I've got,\nmy important document on my desktop.\n\n483\n00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.750\nAnd I wanna move to Windows 10, but\nI gotta keep my data, all right?\n\n484\n00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:18.700\nWell, we have the option\nthat we can do that.\n\n485\n00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:23.290\nIf I drop down to an administrative\ncommand prompt, we'll go ahead and\n\n486\n00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:24.110\ndo that real quick.\n\n487\n00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.980\nAnd let's make sure,\nthe resolution's not too good, guys.\n\n488\n00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:31.315\nLemme go ahead and change that real quick.\n\n489\n00:24:33.851 --> 00:24:36.279\nI'm gonna give everybody migraines\ntrying to see what I'm doing out there.\n\n490\n00:24:38.065 --> 00:24:39.670\nThere we go.\n\n491\n00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:40.880\nAll right.\n\n492\n00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:45.550\nNow I'm gonna go ahead, and\nlet me drop back down to the root here.\n\n493\n00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.630\nAll right, so what we're gonna do here.\n\n494\n00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:53.130\nI've got my architecture,\nmy 64 bit architecture for this utility.\n\n495\n00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:56.440\nI'm just gonna drop that down on C:, and\nthe reason I do that is because it's\n\n496\n00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.730\neasier to type the commands\nin the command prompt.\n\n497\n00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:00.230\nAll right, so what we have to do here is,\n\n498\n00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:03.320\nwe have to determine what it\nis that we want to migrate.\n\n499\n00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.260\nAll right, in this case I'm\njust gonna take the documents.\n\n500\n00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:07.520\nYou could take things like applications,\n\n501\n00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:11.060\nsettings if you will,\ncertain user configurations.\n\n502\n00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:12.890\nIn this case, just so\nyou could see what we're doing here,\n\n503\n00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:15.430\nI'm just gonna do the documents\nthemselves, all right?\n\n504\n00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:20.210\nAnd what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna go ahead\nand let me navigate real quick into that\n\n505\n00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:26.540\nfolder, and we're going to run\na utility called ScanState, all right?\n\n506\n00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:30.410\nAnd with ScanState, it's part of the user\nstate migration tool that is actually\n\n507\n00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:36.130\ndoing, if you will,\nthe gathering of the information.\n\n508\n00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.780\nAnd we'll do MigDocs.xml here.\n\n509\n00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:43.110\nAnd what else are we going to do?\n\n510\n00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:47.030\nGoing to do genconfig.\n\n511\n00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:52.320\nNow, I also have the ability to customize\nthis a little bit if I want to.\n\n512\n00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:57.160\nI can exclude things if I so chose to and\nthat's with a configuration file.\n\n513\n00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:01.820\nUnderstand guys,\nthese are nothing more than XML files and\n\n514\n00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:07.840\nthey tell the operating system what\nto do with the migration process.\n\n515\n00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.840\nLet me see here.\n\n516\n00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:13.190\nOkay, at first, I thought I'd errored out.\n\n517\n00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:15.270\nOne of the interesting things\nis when it errors out,\n\n518\n00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:16.820\nit gives you the error log message.\n\n519\n00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:20.380\nBut it's letting you know if there\nare errors, look in that log.\n\n520\n00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:23.750\nSo, if you do something wrong,\njust check your synthax and start again.\n\n521\n00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:26.130\nNow, this process that I just did,\n\n522\n00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:31.470\nis actually generating something\nthat we call, a config.xml file.\n\n523\n00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:34.530\nAnd, if we open it up, guys don't worry\nabout knowing any of this language.\n\n524\n00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:36.980\nI don't understand x\namount to save my life.\n\n525\n00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:43.704\nBut, basically what this does,\nis this allows me to essentially\n\n526\n00:26:43.704 --> 00:26:49.420\neliminate things that I don't want to.\n\n527\n00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:49.980\n&gt;&gt; Migrate.\n\n528\n00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:50.500\n&gt;&gt; Migrate!\n\n529\n00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:51.020\nThank you, there.\n\n530\n00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:54.294\nAnd, let me make sure that's right.\n\n531\n00:26:55.495 --> 00:27:00.405\nBecause there are some locations,\nessentially, that we can eliminate,\n\n532\n00:27:00.405 --> 00:27:03.105\nthat we don't want to migrate over.\n\n533\n00:27:03.105 --> 00:27:06.375\nSo, that's the point of that file,\njust want you guys to understand this.\n\n534\n00:27:06.375 --> 00:27:10.720\nNow, this could take a little bit,\nbecause It's gonna gather all of the data.\n\n535\n00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.070\nI'm gonna actually set this\nthing in motion here guys, and\n\n536\n00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:16.630\nthen what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna use the magic of TV.\n\n537\n00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:18.040\nWe'll make a timeout and come back.\n\n538\n00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:20.710\nSo, let me go ahead real quick and\ndo that.\n\n539\n00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:22.235\nLet's go ahead and run ScanState.\n\n540\n00:27:27.261 --> 00:27:30.437\nAnd again, this time,\nwhat we're gonna do is,\n\n541\n00:27:30.437 --> 00:27:35.330\nwe will, and you know what,\nlet me just double check here real quick.\n\n542\n00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:38.930\nI need a location to send\nthis migration data, and\n\n543\n00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:44.110\nlet me make sure that my\nstorage location is online.\n\n544\n00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:47.650\nNo it is not.\n\n545\n00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:50.510\nAll right guys, give me one moment here.\n\n546\n00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:55.920\nYou got to make sure,\nit just fell asleep on me.\n\n547\n00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:56.960\nThere we go.\nSo\n\n548\n00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.660\nwhat we're gonna do is we're\ngonna take this data, and\n\n549\n00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:01.450\nwe're gonna put it up onto\nthat intermediate store.\n\n550\n00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:05.493\nSo I've got a location out here,\nand let me just double check,\n\n551\n00:28:05.493 --> 00:28:07.488\nmake sure that it came online.\n\n552\n00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:12.403\nThere we go.\n\n553\n00:28:12.403 --> 00:28:15.221\nAnd client01.\n\n554\n00:28:15.221 --> 00:28:20.070\nThere we go, okay, so\nI had to make sure that it was there.\n\n555\n00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:23.220\nIf you don't have the location,\nyou aren't gonna store anything.\n\n556\n00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:28.680\nSo we'll do client01, and we're gonna\npoint this migration data to the storage,\n\n557\n00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.870\nand we're gonna tell it go ahead, and\n\n558\n00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:35.050\nwhat I want you to do is I want\nyou to grab these documents.\n\n559\n00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:38.412\nAnd that's with a migration docs XML file\n\n560\n00:28:43.336 --> 00:28:49.000\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nrun that, let's see what I did.\n\n561\n00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.850\nThat's not supposed to be a zero,\nthat's an o for over ride, not zero.\n\n562\n00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:54.050\nThere we go, all right,\n\n563\n00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:57.810\nso you can see right here that it\nis starting the migration process.\n\n564\n00:28:57.810 --> 00:29:01.850\nNow, actually that gathering of\nthe data goes fairly quick, and\n\n565\n00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:04.780\nit really depends on how many accounts\nyou have inside of the machine.\n\n566\n00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:07.710\nAnd, like I was talking to Ronnie,\nI've seen this, as you can see,\n\n567\n00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:12.250\nit's already gathered all of the documents\n[LAUGH] inside of the admins folder.\n\n568\n00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:17.110\nBut actually that didn't take too long,\nso we might just be able to wait here.\n\n569\n00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:20.110\nThe 99%'s gonna go really fast,\nthat last one percent takes forever.\n\n570\n00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:22.485\nAnd of course it's gonna make\na liar out of me there too so.\n\n571\n00:29:22.485 --> 00:29:24.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What we're gonna go ahead and\n\n572\n00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.770\ndo is we're gonna start our installation.\n\n573\n00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:30.720\nSo we're gonna take\na just a TV time out and\n\n574\n00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.930\nwhen we come back,\nwe're gonna start the upgrade, all right?\n\n575\n00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:36.350\nBut it does take a second so\nlet's go ahead and\n\n576\n00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:38.710\nwe'll be back in just a few minutes.\n\n577\n00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:42.060\nSo we've got our migration\ncompleted as far as\n\n578\n00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:43.660\npulling the data off of the computer.\n\n579\n00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:47.910\nNow, when an upgrade happens, an in place\nupgrade like we're doing right here,\n\n580\n00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:51.700\nyou have to have your installation\nmedia thrown in the optical tray.\n\n581\n00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.160\nOr if it happens to be a USB,\n\n582\n00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:58.090\nyou're gonna connect it to the machine\nwhile the operating system is on.\n\n583\n00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:00.760\nAnd that's an important part here\nif you are performing an upgrade.\n\n584\n00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.490\nSo let's go ahead and show you here.\n\n585\n00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:04.870\nI've got the DVD if you\nwill in the optical tray.\n\n586\n00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:07.040\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nkick this off here.\n\n587\n00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:10.730\nLike I said, if you did this to where\nyou booted to the installation media and\n\n588\n00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:13.440\nyou tried to perform an upgrade,\nit'll just stop and\n\n589\n00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:16.380\nit'll give you a line of text that says,\nreboot your machine and\n\n590\n00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:19.580\nstart this process inside\nof the operation system.\n\n591\n00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:24.760\nSo now what we're doing right here is it's\ngonna ask us, do we wanna do updates?\n\n592\n00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.930\nDo you wanna download\nthe updates beforehand?\n\n593\n00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:29.330\nAnd yes, you can do it,\nit does take a while.\n\n594\n00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:31.450\nBut we're gonna go ahead, and\nwe're gonna kick this off.\n\n595\n00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:35.520\nAnd what it's gonna do is, it's gonna\nscour the operating system seeing that\n\n596\n00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:40.810\nif it needs to make any kind of updates\nhere while it's doing this process.\n\n597\n00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:43.460\nSo you can see right here,\nif we check it out.\n\n598\n00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:46.060\nIt is getting a few things ready.\n\n599\n00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:50.220\nWe got our end user license agreement and\nit's asking me what I wanna keep.\n\n600\n00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:50.800\nAll right.\nAnd\n\n601\n00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.320\ndepending on what kind\nof installation I have\n\n602\n00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.830\nwill dictate whether you keep files or\nnothing.\n\n603\n00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:58.910\nIn this case we're doing an upgrade,\nbut we're gonna go ahead and\n\n604\n00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:01.970\nwhat we're gonna do is\nkinda wipe the slate clean.\n\n605\n00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:04.670\nAnd we're gonna keep\nabsolutely nothing there.\n\n606\n00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:08.790\n&gt;&gt; Now, Wes, where I normally also\nsee the use of the migration, right?\n\n607\n00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:11.500\nIs not only in the situation that you're\nseeing right here in which somebody\n\n608\n00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.960\ndecides, hey they want to do\nthis process of an upgrade.\n\n609\n00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:18.880\nBut instead of actually adding it on top\nof the operating system, they say, look,\n\n610\n00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.530\nI wanna make sure all\nmy files are off of it.\n\n611\n00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:22.770\nI wanna do the upgrade.\n\n612\n00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:25.580\nThat way if anything happens,\nI still have all my files available.\n\n613\n00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:29.005\nBut the other part is what if you actually\nare migrating to another machine?\n\n614\n00:31:29.005 --> 00:31:31.180\nYou're upgrading the actual\ncomputer yourself but\n\n615\n00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:33.820\nyou still need all of those files too.\n\n616\n00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:37.790\nSo that's usually the process or the\ncontext that you normally see the idea of\n\n617\n00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:40.790\nmigrations, and\nin businesses this happens all the time.\n\n618\n00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:43.340\nSo that's probably why you are wondering,\n\n619\n00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:46.530\nlike I don't think I've ever seen anybody\ntry and do that in the home environment.\n\n620\n00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:49.460\nCuz it's normally this much work\nto actually get it to work.\n\n621\n00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:52.700\nAnd that's why you don't, but\nsince in the business environment,\n\n622\n00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:55.560\nyou have a lot more set up,\nit's probably easier to do it.\n\n623\n00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:58.600\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and what Ronnie's\nreferencing there is the side by side\n\n624\n00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.825\nmigration versus what's\nknown as a wipe and load.\n\n625\n00:32:00.825 --> 00:32:03.612\nIf I've got the source and\nthe destination computer are different,\n\n626\n00:32:03.612 --> 00:32:04.821\nthat's called side by side.\n\n627\n00:32:04.821 --> 00:32:08.049\nIf in this case, like you see right here,\nthe example, the source and\n\n628\n00:32:08.049 --> 00:32:11.420\nthe destination computer are the same,\nwe call it a wipe and load.\n\n629\n00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:14.650\nWhy, because, well, we wiped the all\noperating system and we load a new one.\n\n630\n00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:19.141\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\nfire this one off and it's gonna go ahead.\n\n631\n00:32:19.141 --> 00:32:21.570\nIt's gonna take the time\nto check its updates.\n\n632\n00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:26.427\nNow, again, what it's doing here is it's\nreaching out to Microsoft and it's saying,\n\n633\n00:32:26.427 --> 00:32:30.572\nokay, here's the hardware profile,\nhere's what we see in the registry,\n\n634\n00:32:30.572 --> 00:32:32.320\ncan you look in your database and\n\n635\n00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:35.716\ncan we find out if there are drivers\nthat need to be installed?\n\n636\n00:32:35.716 --> 00:32:40.260\nAre there components that are missing\nin Windows 8.1 that are included in\n\n637\n00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:42.895\nWindows 10 that we also need to download?\n\n638\n00:32:42.895 --> 00:32:43.820\nSo that's what it's doing.\n\n639\n00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:46.820\nSo, again, this is gonna be one of those\nthings, it's gonna take a little bit, we\n\n640\n00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:49.900\nwant you to see it but we certainly don't\nwant you to have to wait on this process.\n\n641\n00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:52.540\nSo we're gonna use\nthe magic of TV here and\n\n642\n00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:54.520\nwe'll come back once\nthis process is finished.\n\n643\n00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:57.515\nSo, it's finished all\nof its inspection now.\n\n644\n00:32:57.515 --> 00:33:01.110\nLet's talked to Microsoft update servers,\nif you will, and\n\n645\n00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:02.250\nwe should be ready to install.\n\n646\n00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:06.630\nIn fact, if we look, the wizard actually\ntells me, hey, we are ready to install.\n\n647\n00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:11.360\nAnd essentially what it's going to do\nnow is, if we did need to make changes,\n\n648\n00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.190\nright now is the time to make changes.\n\n649\n00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:13.930\nIt's one of those things.\n\n650\n00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:17.830\nSpeak now or forever hold your peace\nbecause if you made a mistake here, and\n\n651\n00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:22.190\nyou don't believe that you wanna Keep\nnothing, you don't wanna erase everything,\n\n652\n00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:25.940\nthis is your last chance to go back and\nmake sure that, that doesn't happen.\n\n653\n00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:29.840\nThen, what we do is we just\nstart the installation process.\n\n654\n00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.380\nAnd now you can see here,\nit's going through the process.\n\n655\n00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:35.740\nI'm sure you guys have seen\nmany a progress bars before.\n\n656\n00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:37.440\nSo you could see it's churning away.\n\n657\n00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:42.490\nWe get our lovely spinning cheerio\nDarwin balls, whatever they call those.\n\n658\n00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:45.989\nAnd essentially, we're gonna have\nto wait for a little bit and\n\n659\n00:33:45.989 --> 00:33:50.741\njust like any other process if you're new\nto technology, if you're new to computers\n\n660\n00:33:50.741 --> 00:33:55.163\nprobably 30 to 40% of your entire IT\ncareer is gonna be waiting on a reboot or\n\n661\n00:33:55.163 --> 00:33:56.700\nstaring at a progress bar.\n\n662\n00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:59.010\nSo, we're not gonna\ntorture you with that and\n\n663\n00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:01.700\nwe'll come back after this\ninstallation's finished and\n\n664\n00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:06.250\nwe can look at what Windows 10 looks like\nwhen you do an upgrade installation.\n\n665\n00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:07.960\nThank goodness for the magic of TV, right?\n\n666\n00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:11.320\nSo you guys didn't have to stare\nat a progress bar on this one,\n\n667\n00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:13.980\nbut I can't guarantee you\nthat in your IT career,\n\n668\n00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:17.160\nyou're not gonna be doing that a lot,\nso be prepared.\n\n669\n00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:20.834\nSo we can see it here, that it's actually\nfinished now and I do apologize.\n\n670\n00:34:20.834 --> 00:34:24.083\nI kinda got these bars on the side cuz\nremember, video drivers haven't been\n\n671\n00:34:24.083 --> 00:34:27.398\nconfigured or anything like that so\nwe do have kinda this matted background.\n\n672\n00:34:27.398 --> 00:34:29.961\nBut, It's letting me know very politely.\n\n673\n00:34:29.961 --> 00:34:31.361\nHi there, how are you doing,\n\n674\n00:34:31.361 --> 00:34:34.962\ndo you want to set all of the stuff that\nwe would set on a normal installation?\n\n675\n00:34:34.962 --> 00:34:37.905\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nchange this to Eastern time zone.\n\n676\n00:34:37.905 --> 00:34:40.220\nBut the only thing I'm\nreally gonna change,\n\n677\n00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:42.790\nus being here in Florida,\nin the Eastern time zone,\n\n678\n00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:45.610\nit's really about the only thing I ever\nhave to change on an installation.\n\n679\n00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:47.860\nYou just, we've got viewers everywhere.\n\n680\n00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:52.690\nKeep in mind whatever your regional or\nlocal language might be and time zone,\n\n681\n00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:55.800\njust to set that appropriate and\nwe'll choose Next.\n\n682\n00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.490\nAnd now, it gives us the express set up.\n\n683\n00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:02.820\nIf you've ever installed a machine or\ninstalled the operating system that\n\n684\n00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:05.140\nit isn't an upgrade,\nthan you'll be doing the same thing here.\n\n685\n00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:08.550\nSo, it's really no different than\nif you were doing a clean install.\n\n686\n00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:12.430\nAnd we'll go ahead and it's going to say,\nokay, Just a moment here and\n\n687\n00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:14.210\nwe're gonna go ahead and\nfinish these settings and\n\n688\n00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:17.020\nnow what it's doing it's\ncreating the new profile.\n\n689\n00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:21.660\nActually I've got to,\nI'm gonna create the profile right here.\n\n690\n00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:25.650\nAnd we'll go ahead and keep this\nthe same as it was on the other machine.\n\n691\n00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:29.734\nDoesn't have to be, by the way, guys\nthat's just for me for simplicity sake and\n\n692\n00:35:29.734 --> 00:35:31.553\nI'm keeping everything the same.\n\n693\n00:35:31.553 --> 00:35:35.630\nAnd now what it's going to do after\nwe get, do you wanna use Cortana,\n\n694\n00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:37.760\ndo you want to meet Cortana?\n\n695\n00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.710\nWe're gonna leave Cortana for\nanother episode,\n\n696\n00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:43.070\nwe're not gonna introduce to her right\nnow, [LAUGH] I won't say not now.\n\n697\n00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:47.170\nAnd now hopefully, you'll see\nthe screen is gonna go dark here, and\n\n698\n00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:48.990\nthen what you see in the middle is, Hi.\n\n699\n00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:49.840\nThere we go.\n\n700\n00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:54.000\nAnd now what it's doing, I have to make\nsure I get the steps right is it's taking\n\n701\n00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.920\nwhat's known as a default\nprofile which is a template.\n\n702\n00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:01.283\nAnd it's apply, it's creating a copy of\nthat and it's applying that new username\n\n703\n00:36:01.283 --> 00:36:04.411\nto it and essentially making\nthe registry edits and stuff.\n\n704\n00:36:04.411 --> 00:36:08.400\nNow this one isn't another one of those\nthings that does take a little bit, and\n\n705\n00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:12.390\nwe certainly don't want you to sit here\nand stare at the nice pretty colors that\n\n706\n00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:14.940\nare going by and\nthe welcome message that you get.\n\n707\n00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:16.780\nSo, we're gonna do this one more time.\n\n708\n00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:21.200\nWe are gonna use TV time out and the magic\nof it so that when we come back here,\n\n709\n00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:25.330\nwe can see the last step,\nwhich is gonna be using load state\n\n710\n00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:28.980\nto take that information that\nwe took off of the 8.1 machine.\n\n711\n00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:32.704\nAnd we'll start that process, at least\nshow you guys getting it initialized so\n\n712\n00:36:32.704 --> 00:36:35.594\nthat you'll see what an upgrade\ninstallation looks like from\n\n713\n00:36:35.594 --> 00:36:36.497\nbeginning to end.\n\n714\n00:36:36.497 --> 00:36:38.582\nBut, we'll see ya back here in a few.\n\n715\n00:36:38.582 --> 00:36:41.840\nAll right, wait no longer, we've\nactually come to the end of the road,\n\n716\n00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.200\nor close to the end of the road here.\n\n717\n00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.010\nI know it's been a little\nbit of a journey here but\n\n718\n00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:49.300\nat least you're getting the chance to see\nwhat Ronnie has already mentioned that,\n\n719\n00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:51.940\nthis is typically not something that\nyou're gonna do in a small environment.\n\n720\n00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:54.760\nCuz you can see that the process,\nit does take quite a few steps.\n\n721\n00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.840\nAnd that's why they say, clean\ninstallations a lot of times are easy\n\n722\n00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.200\ninstallations and especially for\nsmall environments.\n\n723\n00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:02.670\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at our Windows 10 machine.\n\n724\n00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:06.390\nAt least I hope it's Windows 10, because\nwe got a Windows 10 lock screen here.\n\n725\n00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:07.200\nAnd, we'll go ahead and\n\n726\n00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:11.340\nget logged in as our user there that\nwe created as part of the upgrade.\n\n727\n00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:16.060\nAnd now, what we have to do is we wanna\nget those settings back down, right?\n\n728\n00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:20.900\nWe wanna get those files back down to this\nmachine here because I don't have them.\n\n729\n00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:25.810\nSo, that's the other part of the migration\nwhich this is actually, I didn't\n\n730\n00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:29.000\nthink about it Ronnie, this is combining\ntwo different types of installations.\n\n731\n00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.080\nThis is an upgrade and\n\n732\n00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:32.880\na migration, so you're seeing\nboth of them combined in one.\n\n733\n00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.200\nBut we got to get those files there.\n\n734\n00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:38.203\nSo, that when we started initial\nprocess of loading that information up,\n\n735\n00:37:38.203 --> 00:37:41.709\nyou might remember that I connected\nto a network share out there.\n\n736\n00:37:41.709 --> 00:37:46.925\nAnd I told that this software I said,\nhey, I want you to, USMT by the way,\n\n737\n00:37:46.925 --> 00:37:52.965\nsorry about that, I want you to store\nthe migration data in a certain location.\n\n738\n00:37:52.965 --> 00:37:55.765\nWell you can see here, there's the USMT.\n\n739\n00:37:55.765 --> 00:37:57.265\nI know it says, USMT on that folder,\n\n740\n00:37:57.265 --> 00:38:00.785\nI'll explain that, but\nthese are actually the USMT files\n\n741\n00:38:00.785 --> 00:38:04.540\nthat you have to copy down on the machine\nto use scan state and load state.\n\n742\n00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:05.820\nWhen you use ScanState,\n\n743\n00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:10.040\nthe migration data actually sits\nin this little USMT MIG file.\n\n744\n00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:11.890\nAnd that's what we're gonna use here.\n\n745\n00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:18.060\nBut before we do that,\nwe're gonna go ahead, and we're gonna pull\n\n746\n00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:23.170\nthe actual User State Migration Engine or\nTools down to this local machine.\n\n747\n00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:26.540\nAnd when we do this, we're gonna,\nand let me just get in here and\n\n748\n00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:28.410\nshow you that these\nare actually executables.\n\n749\n00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:30.650\nThere you'll see, loadstate is.\n\n750\n00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:33.045\nYou'll see some of those\ndocuments that I chose.\n\n751\n00:38:33.045 --> 00:38:36.780\nMigDocs is another XML file or\nconfig files in here.\n\n752\n00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:41.440\nAnd I do believe down here somewhere,\nyep, I scrolled past it is scanstate.\n\n753\n00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:46.030\nSo, we're going to be using LoadState now,\nand I want you to keep in mind\n\n754\n00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:48.960\nthat you do have to have administrative\ncommand prompt to open to do this.\n\n755\n00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:51.920\nSo I probably should have\nlet you guys know that,\n\n756\n00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:56.700\nthis does require admin privileges on the\nmachine to be able to do this, all right?\n\n757\n00:38:56.700 --> 00:39:01.970\nAnd let's go ahead and let's make that\njust a little bit easier to see there.\n\n758\n00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:03.490\nWe'll change these colors.\n\n759\n00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:09.079\nAll right, let's see if that'll make\nit a little easier to see for you guys.\n\n760\n00:39:09.079 --> 00:39:13.219\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead and\none of the things that we have to do is,\n\n761\n00:39:13.219 --> 00:39:17.130\nI should go ahead and\nprobably just throw that down on C: there.\n\n762\n00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:19.470\nAnd again, it just makes it easier for\nyour typing guys.\n\n763\n00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:22.500\nAnd then, I don't have to run it with\na path that leads back to my desktop.\n\n764\n00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.600\nAnd again, it's just for\neasier typing there.\n\n765\n00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:29.750\nAll right, well,\nhopefully it'll copy on me.\n\n766\n00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:32.010\nLet's take a second here.\n\n767\n00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:33.290\nI wanna make it a little bit easier.\n\n768\n00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:37.300\nI don't know why it didn't copy\nover there and it's calculated.\n\n769\n00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:38.984\nWell, looks like I might\njust be running for\n\n770\n00:39:38.984 --> 00:39:41.600\nthis from the desktop whether I like to or\nnot.\n\n771\n00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:42.740\nThat's always interesting.\n\n772\n00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:44.240\nSo, we can do that if we have to.\n\n773\n00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:49.359\nSo let me go ahead and\nlet me get up to my desktop.\n\n774\n00:39:52.788 --> 00:39:55.242\nAnd if we have to,\nwe will run it from here.\n\n775\n00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:01.520\nWhen in doubt just improvise, right?\n\n776\n00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.374\nAll right, so here's what we're gonna run.\n\n777\n00:40:03.374 --> 00:40:07.624\nAll right, first thing we're gonna\ndo is we're gonna run LoadState.\n\n778\n00:40:07.624 --> 00:40:12.778\nAnd we have to tell it where\nthe location of that USMT folder is,\n\n779\n00:40:12.778 --> 00:40:16.390\nand guys, don't rename that USMT folder.\n\n780\n00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:20.325\nThat's very important, as part of\nthe load state process, It's actually\n\n781\n00:40:20.325 --> 00:40:24.735\nlooking at the location that you tell\nit and it's looking for a USMT folder.\n\n782\n00:40:24.735 --> 00:40:29.685\nSo it's smart enough to know that if\nyou lie to it or change that name it's\n\n783\n00:40:29.685 --> 00:40:33.305\nbasically saying you lied to me I've\nlooked for that file and it isn't here.\n\n784\n00:40:33.305 --> 00:40:36.911\nAnd we'll do our migdocs.xml.\n\n785\n00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:41.130\nAnd throw just a couple\nof more switches in here.\n\n786\n00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:43.630\nLet me scoot this over so\nyou guys can see a little bit better.\n\n787\n00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:46.222\nAnd we'll do the C:.\n\n788\n00:40:46.222 --> 00:40:47.430\nAll right.\n\n789\n00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:51.190\nAnd what it's gonna do is it's going\nto look inside of that folder.\n\n790\n00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:55.920\nAnd if we've got things right,\nit's gonna start to bring that data over.\n\n791\n00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.220\nYou could see Admin already.\n\n792\n00:40:57.220 --> 00:41:01.150\nIt It's already got most of it done,\nthis computer.\n\n793\n00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:07.470\nThe first part in both of these utilities\nis analyzation and then the gathering.\n\n794\n00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:09.920\nIn this case it's analyzation and\nthen the loading.\n\n795\n00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:12.330\nAll right, and it could take a bit.\n\n796\n00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:16.750\nNotice that I named the username the same.\n\n797\n00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:19.750\nThat is something that helps if you\nare going to do these migrations.\n\n798\n00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:24.730\nKeep in mind that it gets even more\ncomplex if you try to start migrating\n\n799\n00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:28.760\ndata into a user's profile, you know\nthe suite of settings that we talked about\n\n800\n00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:32.320\nthat this installation created,\nand they don't have the same name.\n\n801\n00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:36.500\nSo again, what we should start to see, and\nyou know Ronnie without even finishing it\n\n802\n00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:39.830\nbecause I didn't do any settings here,\nnotice my important document?\n\n803\n00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:40.840\nIt's back.\n\n804\n00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:45.520\nAs this kind of goes through,\nit looks like it's not going too bad.\n\n805\n00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:48.322\nIt's making some of the final registry\nsettings and modifications Ronnie and\n\n806\n00:41:48.322 --> 00:41:49.940\nI were talking about\nthis before we started.\n\n807\n00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:52.900\nLike, that darn disk computer field,\nit takes forever.\n\n808\n00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:55.478\nAll I had was one document running,\nRonnie made the point well,\n\n809\n00:41:55.478 --> 00:41:57.800\nstill have to make registry\nconfigurations there.\n\n810\n00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:01.150\nThat's why we say, now it does\nsay errors could have been fatal.\n\n811\n00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:02.670\nI put a C in there.\n\n812\n00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:04.690\nLet me tell you what that's about.\n\n813\n00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:07.660\nJust so you know that it's\nsomething that's gonna happen, and\n\n814\n00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:09.060\nyou can be aware of it.\n\n815\n00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.690\nThose are Windows Defender definitions,\nall right.\n\n816\n00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:16.540\nAs part of the configurations of the\nregistry, the registry's not gonna get in\n\n817\n00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:19.780\nthere and modify Windows Defender\nsignature definitions, right?\n\n818\n00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:23.960\nThat's what viruses do, so It errored out,\nI put a C there so we could go past it.\n\n819\n00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:27.150\nBut if that happens, keep in mind\nthat C option just says, okay,\n\n820\n00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:30.330\nI know it's Windows signature definitions,\njust move past it.\n\n821\n00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:32.350\nAnd Ronnie,\nthat's it from beginning to end.\n\n822\n00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:35.750\nI know it's a long journey here, but we\nkinda took two of the different types of\n\n823\n00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:39.990\ninstallations, an upgrade,\nin place upgrade, and a migration, and\n\n824\n00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:42.450\nshowed you the process\nfrom beginning to end.\n\n825\n00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:45.750\n&gt;&gt; Well Wes, that was definitely a lot of\ninformation to consider when we talk about\n\n826\n00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:47.970\nthe idea of installing operating systems.\n\n827\n00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:53.150\nBut this is a technique, this is a utility\nthat you will have to be able to call upon\n\n828\n00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:56.690\nwhen you are working in an environment\nfull of computers, especially of course,\n\n829\n00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:58.390\nWindow's Operating Systems.\n\n830\n00:42:58.390 --> 00:43:01.120\nSo do remember that you do have choices,\nright,\n\n831\n00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:03.430\nwhen you talk about\ninstalling operating systems.\n\n832\n00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:07.250\nDepending on the environment,\nsmaller environments doing the one offs,\n\n833\n00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:10.820\nsuch as using optical media is\npretty much the way to go, or USB.\n\n834\n00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:13.720\nBut once you get into a larger environment\nwhere you start having hundreds of\n\n835\n00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:18.290\ncomputers, or thousands, you may consider\nthat idea of the network installation.\n\n836\n00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:23.580\nAlso, you have to take a look at whatever\nyour program is from your IT shop and\n\n837\n00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:25.870\nsay, hey here's what we're about to do.\n\n838\n00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:27.110\nAnd then from that point,\n\n839\n00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:31.480\nof course, choose whether it's gonna be a\nclean install or it's gonna be an upgrade.\n\n840\n00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:34.250\nYou probably won't do an upgrade\nin a business environment.\n\n841\n00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:37.030\nBut migrations are very common, so\n\n842\n00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:42.460\ndon't take that for granted when you\nstart thinking about this process.\n\n843\n00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:45.340\nWell, thank you also for joining us today.\n\n844\n00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:49.080\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n845\n00:43:49.080 -->

They take the time to break the operating system down into fundamental parts of the user mode, kernel mode, hardware abstraction layer that runs on the hardware.  The team emphasizes why it’s important and how it affects the use of RAM and additional hardware.  This division is foundational to way the operating system can continue to function even in light of an application crash.",

[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Live from San Francisco, California-\n\n4\n00:00:06.122 --> 00:00:08.253\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n5\n00:00:08.253 --> 00:00:09.380\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProvTV.\n\n6\n00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.620\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.260\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n8\n00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.730\ntoday we're taking a look at the Windows\noperating system fundamentals.\n\n9\n00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.170\nWe're specifically gonna be taking a look\nat operating system architecture and\n\n10\n00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.840\nhere to help us out is gonna be Mr.\nWes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.510\nNow, Wes before we get started you got\nto explain that particular term for\n\n12\n00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.000\nme, operating system architecture,\nand then we can\n\n13\n00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.460\ndive into whatever we're talking about,\ncuz I'm a little bit confused now.\n\n14\n00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.006\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n[LAUGH]\n\n15\n00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:39.518\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n16\n00:00:39.518 --> 00:00:40.188\n&gt;&gt; In fact,\n\n17\n00:00:40.188 --> 00:00:42.468\nwe had to do a spell check\nto make sure I got it right.\n\n18\n00:00:42.468 --> 00:00:43.218\nBut that's right,\n\n19\n00:00:43.218 --> 00:00:46.010\narchitecture, well what does it mean?\nDoes it mean we're building something?\n\n20\n00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.540\nNo, not necessarily, but if you look\nat any architectural drafting, right,\n\n21\n00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.170\nyou do have a layout of, well, what?\n\n22\n00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.690\nA building or whatever is being designed.\n\n23\n00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.610\nWell, operating systems\nfollow a framework as well.\n\n24\n00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.970\nAnd that's really what\narchitecture comes down to.\n\n25\n00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.340\nIt comes down to a framework that your\noperating system can be built in.\n\n26\n00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.820\nAnd we've got a couple of\ndifferent frameworks if you will.\n\n27\n00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.640\nProbably the first thing that we'll talk\nabout is the difference between what is\n\n28\n00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.960\nknown as 32 bit and\n64 bit operating systems.\n\n29\n00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.120\nNow, I know, Ronnie, I'm kinda jumping out\nof turn here, but that's directly related\n\n30\n00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.920\nto architecture, so we're gonna put that\none right up at the first of the list.\n\n31\n00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.920\nAnd what do we mean when we\nsay 32 bit versus 64 bit?\n\n32\n00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.260\nWell when we talk about 32 bit versus\n64 bit it really boils down to\n\n33\n00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.230\nhow the information, again remember\narchitecture, framework how the cpu works,\n\n34\n00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.340\nwhat is the available amount of RAM that\nan operating system can address right?\n\n35\n00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.420\nThat's what it boils down to.\n\n36\n00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.170\nWe'll look a little bit more into\nthe memory allocation here coming up.\n\n37\n00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.370\nBut keep in mind,\nwhen it comes to architecture,\n\n38\n00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.400\nwe're primarily talking about\nthree different types today.\n\n39\n00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.250\nTwo are more common.\n\n40\n00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.790\nOne is common in the mobile industry.\n\n41\n00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.620\nBut, there are Windows 10\noperating systems that do give you\n\n42\n00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.720\nthe third one as well.\n\n43\n00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.850\nSo we're talking about\n32 bit operating system.\n\n44\n00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.590\nWe're talking about a 64\nbit operating system,\n\n45\n00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.000\nas well as something known as\nan arm based operating system, and\n\n46\n00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.590\nwe're not going to go too much into\nthe arm based operating system.\n\n47\n00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.790\nYou know that it's there.\n\n48\n00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.430\nI don't even know if it's going to show up\non the exam but that's called Windows for\n\n49\n00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.980\nIoT, Internet of Things.\n\n50\n00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.700\nAnd again arm based architecture\nhas been around for\n\n51\n00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.660\na long time, very popular today because of\nthe explosion of the mobile market, but\n\n52\n00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.690\nprimarily what we're going to be looking\nat and seeing inside of our industry,\n\n53\n00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.107\noutside of a mobile-type market,\nit's gonna be your 32-bit and your 64-bit.\n\n54\n00:02:32.107 --> 00:02:33.130\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n55\n00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.150\nlet's start to break down\nthe components of our operating system.\n\n56\n00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.100\nUnderneath the operating system,\n\n57\n00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.620\nunderneath everything,\nwhat essentially you could almost\n\n58\n00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.410\nconsider the core of an operating\nsystem is something called the kernel.\n\n59\n00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.080\nThis isn't something that's\nspecific to Windows.\n\n60\n00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.910\nYou have a kernel inside\nthe Unix operating system,\n\n61\n00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.790\nUnix derivatives if you will.\n\n62\n00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.370\nLinux based operating systems.\n\n63\n00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.800\nAnd I say Mac, and Mac underneath it, so\n\n64\n00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.300\nit is a Unix like\noperating system as well.\n\n65\n00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.560\nBut the kernel is something that,\n\n66\n00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.610\nbasically, drives the entire\noperating system.\n\n67\n00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.871\nNow on top of that we don't really\ndirectly interact with the core,\n\n68\n00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:14.628\nall right.\n\n69\n00:03:14.628 --> 00:03:17.568\nWhat happens is, we have services and\nwe have drivers and stuff, and\n\n70\n00:03:17.568 --> 00:03:20.070\nthat's really what\ninteracts with the core.\n\n71\n00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.600\nWhat us as users interact with\nis something known as the UI,\n\n72\n00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.550\nthe user interface.\n\n73\n00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.510\nNow these user interfaces have\ndiffered over the years, but\n\n74\n00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.820\nprimarily today we have\ntwo major interfaces.\n\n75\n00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.670\nWe have what's known as\na command line interface.\n\n76\n00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.310\nAll right, and the command line\ninterface is just one where you have\n\n77\n00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.450\ntext based input, you type in commands,\nyou get some kind of text back, right?\n\n78\n00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.240\nIn fact that actually is one of the\nearlier type of interfaces that you had\n\n79\n00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.680\nbefore the next one that we talk\nabout that when I say is more modern,\n\n80\n00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.230\nI mean you really can't say modern\nanymore, it's been around for\n\n81\n00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.680\na very long time, and that's called\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n82\n00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.290\nAnd the graphical user interface\nis essentially what makes it easy.\n\n83\n00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.600\nIt makes it for\naverage people like you and\n\n84\n00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.410\nmyself to be able to use an operating\nsystem and you don't have to know some\n\n85\n00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.590\nkinda programming language or\ncommands to be able to work with it.\n\n86\n00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.925\nWhich is what you had to do in\nthe early days of computing.\n\n87\n00:04:07.925 --> 00:04:12.265\nIf you weren't a programmer you really\nweren't gonna be using a computer because\n\n88\n00:04:12.265 --> 00:04:15.975\nyou'd spend a $1,000 on your computer,\nanother $300 on your operating system and\n\n89\n00:04:15.975 --> 00:04:20.270\nyou would have a book about this big that\nwould come with that operating system so\n\n90\n00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:22.690\nyou can dig in, and hopefully you\ncan figure out how to use it.\n\n91\n00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.520\nBut today we have point and\nclick technology.\n\n92\n00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.020\nWe've had it for a while now.\n\n93\n00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.840\nIt goes back to days, gosh,\n\n94\n00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.310\nall the way back to 1985 when they\nfirst started MS DOS Executive.\n\n95\n00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.796\nAs Microsoft progressed,\nthey got into the 90s.\n\n96\n00:04:35.796 --> 00:04:39.260\nIt was program manager and then what\nkind of changed everything was in\n\n97\n00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.980\nWindows 95 when we started to have\nsomething known as the start menu.\n\n98\n00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.850\nRight, a very interactive way to\nwork with your operating system.\n\n99\n00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.250\nIn 2006, when Vista came out, or\n\n100\n00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.020\nactually it was Windows 7 I believe\nthat introduced the arrow interface,\n\n101\n00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.430\nno I take it back, it was Vista that\nintroduced the arrow interface.\n\n102\n00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.020\nThis is where flashy type graphical\ninterface had a lot of translucencies.\n\n103\n00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.070\nNow, that interface,\nlet's get back to the architecture.\n\n104\n00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.790\nThe interface is the way that you and\nI as users,\n\n105\n00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.760\nas Ronnie, as everybody out\nthere that's using computers,\n\n106\n00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.590\nit's pretty much the way that\nwe interact with our hardware.\n\n107\n00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.530\nBecause what is an operating system?\n\n108\n00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.120\nWhy do we even need an operating system?\n\n109\n00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.920\nWell if we don't have an operating system,\n\n110\n00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.530\nwe got a lot of hardware that\nlooks really cool and if it got\n\n111\n00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.930\ncool colors on it maybe it looks really\ncool, but it really does nothing for us.\n\n112\n00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.390\nIt's a very expensive paperweight, and\n\n113\n00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.060\nthat's not the kind of money you want\nto have wrapped up into a paperweight.\n\n114\n00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.100\nSo our operating system is a piece\nof software that has different\n\n115\n00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.920\ncomponents that allow us to interact with\nthe hardware that it's installed on.\n\n116\n00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.660\nRight?\nIt's essentially what gives our\n\n117\n00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.670\nentrance into the whole computing world.\n\n118\n00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.780\nWithout it,\nwe wouldn't have a computing world.\n\n119\n00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.070\nSo with that in mind,\nkeep that in mind, the kernels,\n\n120\n00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.325\nthe core component that\ndrives an operating system.\n\n121\n00:05:58.325 --> 00:05:59.755\nAgain it provides the services and\n\n122\n00:05:59.755 --> 00:06:02.475\neverything you need to have\nthat operating system running.\n\n123\n00:06:02.475 --> 00:06:04.165\nAll right,\nthere's a reason they call it a shell.\n\n124\n00:06:04.165 --> 00:06:07.055\nYou wrap the shell around the kernel and\n\n125\n00:06:07.055 --> 00:06:11.735\nwe interact with that shell, which then\ngives us interaction down to basic,\n\n126\n00:06:11.735 --> 00:06:15.900\nagain, back to the point gives us\ninteraction with our hardware.\n\n127\n00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.430\nNow how we interact and how the operating\nsystem interacts with the hardware are two\n\n128\n00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.010\ncompletely different concepts.\n\n129\n00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.830\nTwo completely different things,\nall right?\n\n130\n00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.520\nAnd what this boils down to is\nanother abstract architecture.\n\n131\n00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.730\nI've got a diagram up here and\nthere's a lot of information on it guys.\n\n132\n00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.970\nWe're going to zoom in, we'll go\nby each one of these individually.\n\n133\n00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:40.280\nAll right, you have two different\nways to interact with your,\n\n134\n00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.890\nexcuse me, you've got two different levels\nof interaction with an operating system.\n\n135\n00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:46.970\nAt first we have what's\nknown as User Mode.\n\n136\n00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.160\nAll right,\nUser Mode is basically where we stay, and\n\n137\n00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.500\nthere's a reason they call it User Mode.\n\n138\n00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.420\nIt's where we stay as users.\n\n139\n00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.680\nIt's where our applications run.\n\n140\n00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.050\nSo what are some types of drivers run,\nright?\n\n141\n00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:00.710\nYour applications run here.\n\n142\n00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:05.300\nThere's something known as the user\nmode driver framework, all right?\n\n143\n00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.250\nLet's talk about what\na driver is really quick.\n\n144\n00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.190\nRemember that a driver is what\nallows our operating system\n\n145\n00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.020\nto communicate with our hardware.\n\n146\n00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.950\nAnd drivers can sit in\ndifferent locations.\n\n147\n00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:17.930\nYou do have certain drivers that\nwill sit in this user space and\n\n148\n00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.720\nthey interact with the kernel.\n\n149\n00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.610\nThey allow us again to use certain\ncomponents within the operating system.\n\n150\n00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.450\nGive you an example, a USB device.\n\n151\n00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.270\nYou plug it in,\nthe driver's installed, right?\n\n152\n00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.780\nThat USB device is essentially\n\n153\n00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:34.330\nhas a driver that operates in\nthis user space, all right?\n\n154\n00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.990\nNow, what are these differences?\n\n155\n00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.100\nWhy would we have a different space?\n\n156\n00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.360\nAnd what do I mean by space?\n\n157\n00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.940\nWell, I want you to think\nabout where we work,\n\n158\n00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.830\nwhere we operate in an operating system.\n\n159\n00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:48.860\nAnd that all happens in memory.\n\n160\n00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.110\nYour operating system runs in RAM.\n\n161\n00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.690\nAll right now,\nRAM we've gotta keep protected.\n\n162\n00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.831\nSo User Mode is something that doesn't\nhave things like direct access to\n\n163\n00:07:56.831 --> 00:07:57.501\nthe hardware.\n\n164\n00:07:57.501 --> 00:08:01.540\nAnd it tries to keep the operating system,\nthe reason they broke this up,\n\n165\n00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:06.118\nis it tries to keep your operating system,\nit's critical functionality stable.\n\n166\n00:08:06.118 --> 00:08:10.553\nIn the earlier days,\nif people I say XP, going back to XP.\n\n167\n00:08:10.553 --> 00:08:14.287\nThere were certain video drivers\nthat if you installed and\n\n168\n00:08:14.287 --> 00:08:18.690\nit caused a problem, it would wipe\nout your entire system, right?\n\n169\n00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:21.490\nSo all of your processes\nhere in user mode,\n\n170\n00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:24.170\nthey don't run in what's known\nas direct memory, right?\n\n171\n00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.910\nWe talk about DMA technologies and\nthe fundamentals of hardware, right?\n\n172\n00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.140\nDirect memory access.\n\n173\n00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.620\nYou don't have direct memory access,\nright?\n\n174\n00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:35.840\nCuz I want you to think of a virus and not\neven a virus from a security standpoint.\n\n175\n00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.540\nI want you to think about a corrupted\npiece of programming, right,\n\n176\n00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:41.430\nwhich I guess you could\ncall a virus as well.\n\n177\n00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:45.420\nIf it causes a problem, right,\nit could potentially wipe out\n\n178\n00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.860\nall the data that's in memory including\nyour operating system and cause problems.\n\n179\n00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.360\nSo what they've done is\nthey've sectioned that off.\n\n180\n00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.780\nAnd instead of being able to store\nyour data inside of direct memory,\n\n181\n00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:00.850\nyour operating system handles this for\nyou and it stores in this logical place.\n\n182\n00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:05.230\nAnd it says yeah, I'll be the one that\ntells when this information goes in and\n\n183\n00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:06.590\nout of memory, right?\n\n184\n00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.960\nThose are called virtual addresses and\nit's a way that you can keep\n\n185\n00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:14.400\nthe system stable and for security\npurposes also try to keep it secure.\n\n186\n00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.840\nNow, what is it that\nthe kernel mode is about?\n\n187\n00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:23.090\nWell, the kernel mode, we've got to\nunderstand, the kernel mode is what\n\n188\n00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:26.820\nultimately has unrestricted access\nto the hardware, all right.\n\n189\n00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.610\nThe devices and the drivers that run here\n\n190\n00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.950\nhave unrestricted access to the hardware,\nall right?\n\n191\n00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:35.630\nAnd here's something to keep in\nmind as well, more importantly.\n\n192\n00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:40.030\nWhy did I say in the earlier days prior\nto the user mode driver framework,\n\n193\n00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:43.870\nwould a video driver crash\nthe entire operating system?\n\n194\n00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:47.250\nBecause it has access to the kernel space,\nthe kernel mode.\n\n195\n00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.760\nAnd here's the thing to remember\nabout the kernel mode and\n\n196\n00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.500\nwhy it is very essential\nto keep it secure.\n\n197\n00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:58.830\nIs the fact that every piece of code\nthat runs in kernel mode shares one\n\n198\n00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.880\ncommon memory location, all right.\n\n199\n00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:06.300\nAnd if I have a driver that's corrupt,\nright, that little piece of code that\n\n200\n00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.630\nallows my operating system to communicate\nwith my hardware, well guess what?\n\n201\n00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.550\nIt's standing next to the video driver\nthat's standing next to the audio\n\n202\n00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:16.710\ndriver that's standing next to any other\ndriver that you have for the machine.\n\n203\n00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.740\nAnd if that one driver causes a problem,\n\n204\n00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:22.810\nit crashes the entire operating system\nbecause guess what else is sitting there?\n\n205\n00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:28.520\nSomething we call the ntoskrnl.exe,\nthat essentially is your kernel.\n\n206\n00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.810\nAnd seeing this, that's one of\nthe reasons the kernel mode is protected.\n\n207\n00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:35.580\nIt's another reason we\ntalked about code integrity.\n\n208\n00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.840\nIf you're not aware of this in\n64 bit operating systems today,\n\n209\n00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.680\nevery one of your kernel mode\ndriver has to be digitally signed.\n\n210\n00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.650\nWhat are they doing that for?\n\n211\n00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:45.200\nYes, they're doing it for\nsecurity purposes,\n\n212\n00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.930\nbut they're also proofing the code\nitself that it's free of bugs, right?\n\n213\n00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:53.780\nAnd that it's not going to or\nit isn't going to cause problems\n\n214\n00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.680\ndown there at the lower levels\nof the operating system.\n\n215\n00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:00.990\nAll right, now the other thing that I want\nto mention is something that we don't\n\n216\n00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:04.690\nreally talk about in computing anymore\nsince we have things like plug and play.\n\n217\n00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.100\nAll right, and we'll get to plug and\nplay here in a second.\n\n218\n00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.220\nIt's something known as the HAL,\nthe hardware abstraction layer.\n\n219\n00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.780\nAll right, now some of you guys will\nprobably remember an earlier movie there\n\n220\n00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:18.800\nwhere we had a HAL, essentially\na talking ship I guess you would say.\n\n221\n00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.808\nWell, this really isn't that type of HAL.\n\n222\n00:11:21.808 --> 00:11:24.970\nThe hardware abstraction layer is\nsomething that actually makes it a lot\n\n223\n00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:27.700\neasier for\npeople that are designing software.\n\n224\n00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:32.060\nAnd people that are developing hardware\nto get this into the operating system and\n\n225\n00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:32.800\nget it functional.\n\n226\n00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.165\nBecause in the earlier days prior\nto things like the hardware\n\n227\n00:11:35.165 --> 00:11:35.910\nabstraction layer.\n\n228\n00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:37.450\nIf you were a software programmer and\n\n229\n00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:40.840\nyou wanted to build a piece of code\nthat would run in the operating system.\n\n230\n00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.280\nNot only did you have to have\nthe intricate knowledge of the operating\n\n231\n00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.410\narchitecture, you had to\nknow the hardware too.\n\n232\n00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.490\nAnd there came a point\nin time where they said,\n\n233\n00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:53.980\nyou know what, let's give kind of a middle\nman if you will, an intermediary.\n\n234\n00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.760\nSo that the people that\nare developing software,\n\n235\n00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.370\nthey don't have to have that\ndeep knowledge of the hardware.\n\n236\n00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:01.450\nAnd how it works and\n\n237\n00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:05.190\nhow the physical device moves along\nthe traces of the motherboard.\n\n238\n00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:08.290\nWe can write our software to this HAL and\n\n239\n00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:11.280\nthen we'll take the hardware\nmanufacturer's.\n\n240\n00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:16.800\nAnd we'll make them invent the drivers and\ncreate the drivers, if you will.\n\n241\n00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.240\nThat allows that communication\nbetween the software's programming and\n\n242\n00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.220\nthe hardware devices that\nthe manufacturers create.\n\n243\n00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.958\nThe other thing about the hardware\nabstraction layer is it allows for\n\n244\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.710\ncode portability, all right?\n\n245\n00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:33.390\nIf I'm writing to an abstraction layer,\nall I gotta do is move\n\n246\n00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:36.910\nthe abstraction layer to another\noperating system and guess what?\n\n247\n00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:40.510\nThe code still works and it's up to\nthe hardware manufacturers again\n\n248\n00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:43.610\nto make the drivers that suit\nthe products that they put out.\n\n249\n00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:45.080\nLast but not least is the hardware.\n\n250\n00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.020\nI want you to keep in mind as\na real quick recap, I know that\n\n251\n00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:51.650\nit's a lot of information guys, but if you\nstart out as with this kind of knowledge.\n\n252\n00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:55.790\nKnowing what is going on inside\nunder the hood, it can make you make\n\n253\n00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:59.360\na little bit better decisions about how\nyour computing environment's going to run.\n\n254\n00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.040\nHow it's running and\nhow you're going to interact with it.\n\n255\n00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:06.540\nLike I said, the last layer here,\nis something known as the hardware.\n\n256\n00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:10.910\nNow I have mentioned, protecting,\nprotecting our operating system.\n\n257\n00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:14.280\nAnd it is from a security standpoint,\nas well as a stability standpoint.\n\n258\n00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.510\nAnd I do wanna take the time to\nmention something known as privileges.\n\n259\n00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:21.440\nThe reason the kernel is so\nprotected is because of that stability and\n\n260\n00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.920\nyou have what are known\nas these privilege rings.\n\n261\n00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:28.100\nNow the great thing here in Windows,\nMicrosoft only implements two of these.\n\n262\n00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.970\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna take two of these rings out.\n\n263\n00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:36.380\nJust understand that your user mode\nhas the least privilege of all,\n\n264\n00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.380\nit sits all the way out\nhere in ring three.\n\n265\n00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:44.060\nAnd as you get closer to code\nthat's gonna run on the kernel,\n\n266\n00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.580\nyou have to have a higher\nlevel of privilege.\n\n267\n00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.660\nAnd that's another reason when we\ndistinguish between user mode and\n\n268\n00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.010\nthe applications that\nrun there in the kernel.\n\n269\n00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:54.560\nIs because it has to go\nthrough a series of checks and\n\n270\n00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.820\nbalances in order to get the privileges\nto work with the kernel, all right.\n\n271\n00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:02.530\nSo it's about separation,\nright, and it's about again,\n\n272\n00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:06.730\nkeeping that memory that\nthe kernel runs in secure.\n\n273\n00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:12.030\nSo that's a little bit about\nkernel mode and user mode.\n\n274\n00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:14.260\nI know it's a lot of talking guys,\nI do understand that.\n\n275\n00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:18.580\nBut it does help to understand these\nthings when it comes to if you're just\n\n276\n00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:22.029\nstarting out in computing and especially\nwhen it comes to just Windows in general.\n\n277\n00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:24.926\nNow we mentioned architecture, all right?\n\n278\n00:14:24.926 --> 00:14:29.147\nAnd one of the things I talked about\nwas a 32-bit operating system versus\n\n279\n00:14:29.147 --> 00:14:30.960\na 64-bit operating system.\n\n280\n00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.128\nI said we'll get back to\nthe memory allocation.\n\n281\n00:14:34.128 --> 00:14:38.480\nAll right, when it comes to these two\ndifferent architectures, that's what it\n\n282\n00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:43.710\nboils down to is, how much memory can\nthe operating system have access to?\n\n283\n00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:45.500\nAll right, don't worry about user mode and\nkernel mode.\n\n284\n00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.610\nWe still have the same thing.\n\n285\n00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:49.570\nThat's the basis, doesn't matter if\nyou have a 32-bit operating system, or\n\n286\n00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:51.450\nyou have a 64-bit operating system.\n\n287\n00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:54.421\nBut now we're saying,\nhow big is that space?\n\n288\n00:14:54.421 --> 00:14:56.117\nHow big is that work bench, right?\n\n289\n00:14:56.117 --> 00:15:00.300\nRemember RAM, remember back to\nyour hardware fundamentals?\n\n290\n00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:00.910\nWhat is your RAM?\n\n291\n00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:01.690\nWhat is your memory?\n\n292\n00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:04.590\nIt's a temporary workbench for\nyour data, so you can work with it.\n\n293\n00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:06.635\nThe more you have,\nthe more work you could do at one time.\n\n294\n00:15:06.635 --> 00:15:11.620\nAnd that's one thing to keep in mind\nabout a 32-bit operating system.\n\n295\n00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:16.430\nThe 32-bit operating system only allows\nyou access to four gigs of RAM, all right?\n\n296\n00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:17.740\nI think it's just a little\nbit under four gigs.\n\n297\n00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.990\nBut in general, four gigs of RAM, okay?\n\n298\n00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:22.640\nWell, how do we get that four gigs?\n\n299\n00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.800\nWhere does that number even come from?\n\n300\n00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.210\nWell, if you look at\neverything being binary,\n\n301\n00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:31.900\njust a binary equation two to\nthe power of 32 is 4.3 billion.\n\n302\n00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.760\nWhen you look at the overhead in NTFS,\n\n303\n00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:38.820\nit works out to four gig or in general\nin binary not NTFS, that's file systems.\n\n304\n00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:39.879\nIt works out to four gigs.\n\n305\n00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.740\nNow inside of a 32-bit operating system,\n\n306\n00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.470\nyou are kind of restricted\neven more than that.\n\n307\n00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:50.390\nI know some people always push I got\nfour gigs of RAM, that's enough.\n\n308\n00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:52.023\nI'm only running this or I'm running that.\n\n309\n00:15:52.023 --> 00:15:56.898\nWell, not really, because the way Windows\nbreaks it into these two sections,\n\n310\n00:15:56.898 --> 00:16:00.632\nuser mode and kernel mode,\nthat kernel space uses two gigs.\n\n311\n00:16:00.632 --> 00:16:03.824\nRight away, you use two gigs for\nyour kernel space.\n\n312\n00:16:03.824 --> 00:16:09.883\nThe space that you can operate in, the\nsize of your temporary [LAUGH] workbench,\n\n313\n00:16:09.883 --> 00:16:14.140\nis only 2 gigs,\nthat's all you can work with.\n\n314\n00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:17.400\nSo one of the things to keep in\nmind is if you're needing to run\n\n315\n00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:21.970\napplication intensive processes, and\nmultiple applications at one time,\n\n316\n00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:25.300\nin the earlier portions of computing,\n32-bit would have been just fine.\n\n317\n00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:29.470\nIn fact, when you go from 16-bit into\n32-bit, you had a lot of memory.\n\n318\n00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:32.630\nBut the thing is,\napplications are getting more complex,\n\n319\n00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:34.630\nthey're requiring more processing power,\nand\n\n320\n00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:39.190\nthey're requiring more of that temporary\nworkbench, that RAM, to work it.\n\n321\n00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:44.141\nNow when we look at this,\nthat's where we go to 64-bit, all right.\n\n322\n00:16:44.141 --> 00:16:45.191\nNow 64-bit,\n\n323\n00:16:45.191 --> 00:16:49.920\nit has an amount of memory that we don't\neven have systems that support it.\n\n324\n00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:53.250\nIn fact, Windows the way they implement\nit doesn't actually use all of the space.\n\n325\n00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:56.340\nBut I do just wanna throw some theory\nout here guys so you're aware of it,\n\n326\n00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.120\ngive you a good foundation.\n\n327\n00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:01.842\nYou can see 64-bit,\n16 exabytes, all right.\n\n328\n00:17:01.842 --> 00:17:04.268\nWhat is that?\n\n329\n00:17:04.268 --> 00:17:05.451\nWhat does that mean?\n\n330\n00:17:05.451 --> 00:17:10.176\nI'm gonna give you an example,\nin one day the entire world wide\n\n331\n00:17:10.176 --> 00:17:14.380\ninternet in one day averages\nabout 8 exabytes of data.\n\n332\n00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:17.620\nThis is twice that.\n\n333\n00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.416\nAll right, 16 exabytes.\n\n334\n00:17:19.416 --> 00:17:22.670\nSo when I say we don't have\nsystems right now that use that,\n\n335\n00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:27.230\nmaybe some supercomputer somewhere does\nbut certainly not what you're going to see\n\n336\n00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:30.252\nin your home and your enterprise\nenvironments on basic machines, okay?\n\n337\n00:17:30.252 --> 00:17:35.630\nSo 64-bit gives you, and we're just going\nto say, an unrealistic amount of memory.\n\n338\n00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:40.320\nBut access to all the memory you need at\nleast at this point in history, all right?\n\n339\n00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:46.720\nNow you get a lot more workbench\nin this kind of a system, right?\n\n340\n00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.620\nNotice we went from 2 gigs to 8 gigs?\n\n341\n00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:52.525\nYour user mode, your user space, you can\nuse 8 gigs of that memory, all right?\n\n342\n00:17:52.525 --> 00:17:55.705\nAnd that's a good bet,\nthat's a good chunk, right.\n\n343\n00:17:55.705 --> 00:17:58.415\nThe other thing to keep in\nmind is that the kernel,\n\n344\n00:17:58.415 --> 00:18:03.985\nit has access to 248 terabytes,\nwhich again, is just mind boggling.\n\n345\n00:18:03.985 --> 00:18:07.095\nHowever, I do want you to keep in mind\nthat it's not all used, all right.\n\n346\n00:18:07.095 --> 00:18:08.450\nSo that being said.\n\n347\n00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:12.510\n&gt;&gt; Now, Wes, you said 8 gigs or\ndo you mean 8 terabytes?\n\n348\n00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:13.210\n&gt;&gt; That's what I meant.\n\n349\n00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:14.350\n&gt;&gt; Okay, just want to make sure.\n\n350\n00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:15.600\n&gt;&gt; You are absolutely right, Ronnie.\n\n351\n00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.540\nMy goodness, thank you for\n[LAUGH] making sure that's right.\n\n352\n00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:22.350\nYour user mode has a theoretical\naccess to 8 terabytes.\n\n353\n00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:24.030\nThank you for the correction on that.\n\n354\n00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:27.055\nBoy, we would've gotten some support\ntickets on that one for sure.\n\n355\n00:18:27.055 --> 00:18:28.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But yeah, and\n\n356\n00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:31.620\nthere's a large portion of this\nthat isn't even implemented at all.\n\n357\n00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.780\nEven though Microsoft says we reserve 248,\n\n358\n00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:40.710\nI think that's actually the architectural\ndesign, because your operating system's,\n\n359\n00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:43.970\nI wanna say and I don't think\nthis is going to be on the exam.\n\n360\n00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:48.260\nI think the maximum on a client\noperating system can conceives 128 gigs.\n\n361\n00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.670\nWhich is still a lot.\n\n362\n00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:52.410\nBut it certainly isn't\nclose to the terabytes of\n\n363\n00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:53.660\nmemory that you have access to.\n\n364\n00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:57.700\nAnd that's really what it boils down to,\nis the fact that you have access to so\n\n365\n00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:58.300\nmuch memory.\n\n366\n00:18:58.300 --> 00:18:59.740\nNow we didn't even talk about CPU.\n\n367\n00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.360\nIf we're gonna talk about architecture.\n\n368\n00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.550\nWe might as well mention the CPUs and\n\n369\n00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:07.730\nI'm not gonna bore you of a slide\nup here of what a CPU looks like.\n\n370\n00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:10.860\nI want you to think about 32-bit, okay?\n\n371\n00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:14.820\nTake 32 electrical conductors,\nlike highways,\n\n372\n00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:19.816\nput them side-by-side and pipe them\ninto the CPU and you do 32-bit chunks\n\n373\n00:19:19.816 --> 00:19:24.010\nevery time that processor bites,\nif you will, chews off a piece of data.\n\n374\n00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:26.700\nIt's doing it 32 bits at a time,\nall right?\n\n375\n00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:27.930\nI believe they call that a word,\n\n376\n00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:31.510\nif you're looking at your basic\nhardware fundamentals, right?\n\n377\n00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:32.380\nSo 32-bit chunks at a time.\n\n378\n00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:37.350\nNow I want you to take that amount\nof data and I want you to double it.\n\n379\n00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:41.690\nNow we got 64 electrical traces across\nthe motherboard that are piping\n\n380\n00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:44.050\nin 64-bits of data at a time.\n\n381\n00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:48.710\nAll right, so the amount of information\nthat you can work with at one time is also\n\n382\n00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:51.770\nrelevant to the fact that you can pipe\nin more information into the CPU and\n\n383\n00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:54.290\nit ends up calculating it faster.\n\n384\n00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:58.880\nAll right, so there's a lot of\nbenefits to 62, or 64-bit, excuse me.\n\n385\n00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.570\nSo would you see 32-bit anymore?\n\n386\n00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:03.650\nAbsolutely, you got tablets out there\nthat maybe don't need all the extra\n\n387\n00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:04.226\nmemory space.\n\n388\n00:20:04.226 --> 00:20:07.130\nIt's just something little that they're\ngonna use, 32-bit is still there.\n\n389\n00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:12.200\nA lot of your systems have gone to 64-bit,\nthat's the way they are, but\n\n390\n00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:16.210\nI don't really see that 32-bit is gonna,\nit still has its place today, right?\n\n391\n00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:18.340\nIf I am not doing anything\napplication intensive,\n\n392\n00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:22.650\nif I don't have to run World of\nWarcraft on the highest level\n\n393\n00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:27.270\nof video output I can get then I'm not\nreally gonna be too worried about it.\n\n394\n00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:33.120\nNow the next thing I'd like to talk about\nis a concept that we really don't have\n\n395\n00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.750\nto deal with anymore because of plug and\nplay and that is something known as IRQ's.\n\n396\n00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:39.190\nIn fact, I've been talking a lot.\n\n397\n00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:41.880\nLet me jump into the operating system and\nlet's talk a little bit\n\n398\n00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.990\nabout something that we used to\nhave to deal a lot with and today,\n\n399\n00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:47.750\nthank goodness, because of plug and\nplay it's happening behind the scenes.\n\n400\n00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:51.130\nBut it's still under the hood somewhere,\nwe just gotta find it.\n\n401\n00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:53.300\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n402\n00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.890\nI'm gonna open up, a couple different\nplaces that you can see this.\n\n403\n00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:58.320\nThe one place that I'm\ngonna open up is something,\n\n404\n00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.550\na little utility called msinfo32.\n\n405\n00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:06.430\nAnd hint, hint, exam alert,\nthat might come up, you never know.\n\n406\n00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:10.290\nSo we can give you an example\nof what we'll see and\n\n407\n00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:13.540\nthe utility that you can use\nif you need to ever see this.\n\n408\n00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:19.640\nNotice that we have in system information\nagain, MS Info32 System Information,\n\n409\n00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.610\nsame utility,\nsee it in the administrative tools.\n\n410\n00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:24.650\nNotice that we have Hardware Resources.\n\n411\n00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:27.360\nWhat's that about,\na Hardware Resource, right?\n\n412\n00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.580\nWell, we have direct memory access lines.\n\n413\n00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.920\nWe have things like I/Os,\ninput/outputs, and\n\n414\n00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.100\nwe have,\nthere's your Memory right there, too.\n\n415\n00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:36.330\nSo I'll tell you what,\n\n416\n00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.470\nwe'll do this relative to the memory\nwe just talked about, right?\n\n417\n00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:40.470\nRemember I told you that there was so\n\n418\n00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:43.080\nmuch space that you have\ninside of your kernel mode?\n\n419\n00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.640\nWell these are the memory\naddresses that you have.\n\n420\n00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.330\nAnd you can see there are a bunch of them.\n\n421\n00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:51.650\nNow, Ronnie could probably tell you\nthe days where you had to configure these.\n\n422\n00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:55.170\nAnd if you didn't configure them right,\nyour computing wasn't going to happen.\n\n423\n00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:58.560\nThe great thing is, we have a plug and\nplay subsystem, and we got an advanced\n\n424\n00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:02.710\nconfiguration interface that's been out\nfor a while that handles this for us.\n\n425\n00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:05.280\nBut we also have what are known\nas interrupt request lines and\n\n426\n00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:08.910\nthis is something that they\ndo call out on the MTA.\n\n427\n00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:13.180\nIt's something that you really don't see\nmuch anymore, but we wouldn't be doing you\n\n428\n00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:16.090\nany justice if they called it out and\nwe didn't at least address it here.\n\n429\n00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:18.378\nIt's funny, we're talking about\nmemory addresses addressing.\n\n430\n00:22:18.378 --> 00:22:19.188\nBad pun.\n\n431\n00:22:19.188 --> 00:22:22.970\n[LAUGH] But when we look here,\nwe've got what are known as IRQs.\n\n432\n00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:27.510\nIRQ basically is a dedicated\ntrace on the motherboard.\n\n433\n00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:31.110\nBecause the CPU moves so fast,\nwe're talking these are, what,\n\n434\n00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:33.960\n3 billion calculations in a single second?\n\n435\n00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.000\nWell, if I need to send information,\nhow do I do it?\n\n436\n00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.690\nIf I have a device that's on\nthe motherboard that needs to fire off\n\n437\n00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:41.700\na communication, I'd say,\nCPU, pay attention to me.\n\n438\n00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:42.780\nWell what do I do?\n\n439\n00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:45.910\nWell we said what's known as\nan interrupt request, right?\n\n440\n00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:49.100\nI say we, we don't actually do it,\nthe operating system is doing it for\n\n441\n00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:50.010\nus, all right.\n\n442\n00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:53.190\nSo in the earlier days of computing,\nif you needed a device to\n\n443\n00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:57.825\nbe able to communicate to the CPU you\nwould have to allocate the appropriate\n\n444\n00:22:57.825 --> 00:23:02.015\ninterrupt request line and I believe there\nwere limits up to 15, technically 16.\n\n445\n00:23:02.015 --> 00:23:04.575\nOne was reserved for the system clock so\nyou couldn't use it, but\n\n446\n00:23:04.575 --> 00:23:07.005\n15 devices could be connected, right?\n\n447\n00:23:07.005 --> 00:23:11.035\nToday we have I think it's up to 255,\nand we're not really managing these.\n\n448\n00:23:11.035 --> 00:23:16.390\nAgain you can see things like ACPI,\nsorry about the acronym guys.\n\n449\n00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:19.980\nThat's a design that came out of Intel,\nI want to say in the late 90s.\n\n450\n00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.000\nIt's the advanced\nconfiguration power interface.\n\n451\n00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.140\nAnd thank goodness, this is all taken\ncare of for us in the background.\n\n452\n00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:29.330\nBut this is a place you can\nsee things like your IRQs and\n\n453\n00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:31.490\nthank goodness we don't\nhave to worry about it.\n\n454\n00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:33.090\nAnd why don't we have to worry about it?\n\n455\n00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:35.600\nWell, this little section right here,\nConflicts/Sharing.\n\n456\n00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.670\nWhen you used to get these conflicts,\nin fact,\n\n457\n00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:40.370\nRonnie could probably\ntell you about these.\n\n458\n00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:41.450\nRonnie, what would happen if,\n\n459\n00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:46.990\nyou had two of these devices that\nwere both using the same IRQ line?\n\n460\n00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:49.220\n&gt;&gt; Well, one would normally not work and\nthe other one would.\n\n461\n00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:50.720\nOr you'd get them to work part-time.\n\n462\n00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.490\n&gt;&gt; And why is that?\n\n463\n00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:54.150\nWell, if you think about it,\nif I've got a dedicated call line, right?\n\n464\n00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:57.400\nThat line goes right to the presidential\noffice, the red phone, right?\n\n465\n00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.810\nWhen I pick it up, I'm going to hear it,\nthey're going to hear it.\n\n466\n00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:02.845\nI can't have two people on\nthe same dedicated line like that.\n\n467\n00:24:02.845 --> 00:24:05.277\nAnd that's really no\ndifferent than what IRQs are,\n\n468\n00:24:05.277 --> 00:24:08.275\nbecause IRQs use that dedicated\nline to communicate with a CPU.\n\n469\n00:24:08.275 --> 00:24:12.661\nAnd if you misconfigure these and\nyou put two devices using the same line,\n\n470\n00:24:12.661 --> 00:24:17.178\nif one was talking and the other\none tried to, well, who wins out?\n\n471\n00:24:17.178 --> 00:24:20.530\nAnd, like Ronnie said, things would start\nto cause problems and they wouldn't work.\n\n472\n00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:23.110\nThank goodness you can see\nwe've got conflicts right here.\n\n473\n00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:27.600\nNotice it says we've got conflicts going\non right now, but the thing about it is,\n\n474\n00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.490\nwith this more advanced\nconfiguration interface,\n\n475\n00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:32.450\nwe don't have to worry about this anymore.\n\n476\n00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:36.040\nWe don't have to worry about this\nbecause of things like plug and play.\n\n477\n00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.500\nNow, Ronnie, I've mentioned plug and play,\n\n478\n00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.650\nlet's talk a little bit about\nwhat plug and play means.\n\n479\n00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:40.569\nIn the earlier days,\n\n480\n00:24:40.569 --> 00:24:43.384\n[LAUGH] it would've been called\nsomething known as plug and pray.\n\n481\n00:24:43.384 --> 00:24:47.132\nAnd that's because there was a point\nin time when we're talking about\n\n482\n00:24:47.132 --> 00:24:48.910\nhaving to configure all of this,\n\n483\n00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:52.932\nthat they started switching over to\nan automatic configuration, right?\n\n484\n00:24:52.932 --> 00:24:57.040\nAnd an automatic configuration is what\nthe plug n play subsystem was, right?\n\n485\n00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.980\nWe could communicate with the operating\nsystems, the bios' could communicate with\n\n486\n00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.960\nthe devices and they could figure\nout what drivers are needed.\n\n487\n00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.320\nThey could figure out,\nyou're gonna sit on this IRQ,\n\n488\n00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.030\nyou're gonna have this memory address,\nand they do it for you.\n\n489\n00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:11.540\nThat's the benefit of plug and play.\n\n490\n00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:15.740\nBut there was a certain time where they\nwere making that jump, that devices,\n\n491\n00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:18.600\nif they didn't automatically configure,\n\n492\n00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.940\nthey'd fall back on\na manual configuration, and\n\n493\n00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:24.570\nyou'd just have to wait until you realized\nit didn't work and then you'd set it.\n\n494\n00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:25.940\nThey called it plug and pray.\n\n495\n00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:28.228\nToday, we don't have to worry about that.\n\n496\n00:25:28.228 --> 00:25:32.379\nIn fact, let's go ahead and\ntalk about how driver installations\n\n497\n00:25:32.379 --> 00:25:36.086\nstart today inside of your\noperating system, all right?\n\n498\n00:25:36.086 --> 00:25:40.210\nSo the first thing that happens here\nis Windows detects a new device.\n\n499\n00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:43.790\nAll right, now you have inside\nof your operating system,\n\n500\n00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:46.470\nyou have something known\nas a driver store, okay?\n\n501\n00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:51.100\nAnd there's a file repository that\ncontains the majority of the drivers that\n\n502\n00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:54.980\nWindows or Microsoft knows about that's\nbundled into the operating system.\n\n503\n00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:56.870\nThey're digitally signed,\nso they're secure.\n\n504\n00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:58.674\nThey have to be if they're\ngonna bundle with Windows,\n\n505\n00:25:58.674 --> 00:26:00.216\nso we know they're not\ngonna cause a problem.\n\n506\n00:26:00.216 --> 00:26:03.343\nAll right, and what plug and\nplay does is it says, okay,\n\n507\n00:26:03.343 --> 00:26:05.831\ndevice, do you have an identifier, right?\n\n508\n00:26:05.831 --> 00:26:07.927\nAnd if I'm gonna walk up and\nI got dinner reservations,\n\n509\n00:26:07.927 --> 00:26:09.096\nI gotta provide my ID, right?\n\n510\n00:26:09.096 --> 00:26:10.800\nYou gotta know that I'm\nsupposed to be there.\n\n511\n00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:14.490\nWell, it says is there an identifier,\nall right?\n\n512\n00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:18.131\nNow, once it knows the identifier,\nthe next thing it does is it says, okay,\n\n513\n00:26:18.131 --> 00:26:22.056\nis inside of this driver store, this file\nrepository where we've got drivers that\n\n514\n00:26:22.056 --> 00:26:26.290\naren't connected to devices, they're doing\nnothing, they're just sitting there.\n\n515\n00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:31.292\nDoes it match an identifier I see there,\nall right?\n\n516\n00:26:31.292 --> 00:26:36.160\nNow I'll get to the yes after the fact,\nbecause if the yes happens,\n\n517\n00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.480\nwe skip a whole bunch of steps, all right?\n\n518\n00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:42.400\nBut let's say it isn't there, and\nthis is one of the benefits of plug and\n\n519\n00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.750\nplay, all right?\n\n520\n00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:46.830\nIt says, okay, well let's search\nthe driver package in the configured\n\n521\n00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:47.700\nlocations.\n\n522\n00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:49.630\nAll right, and\nthat just means where is plug and\n\n523\n00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:52.580\nplay configured to look, all right?\n\n524\n00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:58.400\nWell, if it doesn't find a driver,\nthe device says I'm not identified,\n\n525\n00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:02.430\nyou need to find a driver, and\nyou need to manually install it, right?\n\n526\n00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:06.430\nBut most of these devices today,\nthey find an identifier.\n\n527\n00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:09.924\nThey find a matching driver store,\nand that's where we go to yes, but\n\n528\n00:27:09.924 --> 00:27:13.494\nthen the next thing is does the user\nhave the permissions to install it?\n\n529\n00:27:13.494 --> 00:27:16.362\nAll right, and that's the other\nthing you gotta keep in mind.\n\n530\n00:27:16.362 --> 00:27:20.985\nYou have to have administrative privileges\nto install drivers, because why?\n\n531\n00:27:20.985 --> 00:27:23.510\nLet's go back to our architecture\nthat we started with.\n\n532\n00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:25.180\nKernel mode, right?\n\n533\n00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:28.720\nThat drivers gonna be in kernel mode, it's\ngonna have access to all the other memory,\n\n534\n00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:32.950\nwell, the same memory space that all the\nother drivers have access to, all right?\n\n535\n00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:35.790\nSo does it have a valid signature?\n\n536\n00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:40.880\nNow, it doesn't mean it's a good\npiece of code, so it inspects it for\n\n537\n00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:44.370\na little digital security mark on it\nthat we call a digital signature.\n\n538\n00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:48.717\nA little security information that says,\nyes, I know this came from Microsoft or\n\n539\n00:27:48.717 --> 00:27:51.930\nI know that this is\nWindows Hardware Quality Labs approved,\n\n540\n00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:55.145\nwhich is just their internal\nintegrity check, if you will.\n\n541\n00:27:55.145 --> 00:27:57.323\nAnd then it says, all right,\n\n542\n00:27:57.323 --> 00:28:02.911\ncopy the driver package from that\nlocation to the driver store, all right?\n\n543\n00:28:02.911 --> 00:28:04.320\nNow we're going into five.\n\n544\n00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:08.290\nLet's go back up to what happens\nback in step three one more time.\n\n545\n00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:10.310\nIs there a matching driver\nin the driver package?\n\n546\n00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:11.935\nI just showed you what no means.\n\n547\n00:28:11.935 --> 00:28:16.896\nIf it's yes, then we skip all\nof those steps for a, b, c, and\n\n548\n00:28:16.896 --> 00:28:19.289\nd, and we skip right to five.\n\n549\n00:28:19.289 --> 00:28:24.328\nPnP copies the files from that driver\nstore to the final locations where that\n\n550\n00:28:24.328 --> 00:28:30.450\ndriver's gonna rest in order to get that\nhardware interacting with us, all right?\n\n551\n00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:35.640\nPnP, and here's where it gets really cool,\nPnP then configures the registry and\n\n552\n00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:40.550\ntells, now, the database of\nconfigurations, which is the registry,\n\n553\n00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:43.830\nthis is where you're gonna look now for\nthat driver, all right?\n\n554\n00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:45.090\nI want you to use that driver.\n\n555\n00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:47.020\nSo it configures the registry.\n\n556\n00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:51.276\nThen, PnP takes any service that's\nassociated with the device or\n\n557\n00:28:51.276 --> 00:28:54.621\njust the device itself and\nit starts it, all right?\n\n558\n00:28:54.621 --> 00:28:57.356\nThis is essentially the steps\nthat make up plug and play.\n\n559\n00:28:57.356 --> 00:28:59.779\nNow, you probably didn't\nknow all that was going on.\n\n560\n00:28:59.779 --> 00:29:03.985\nThe next time you grabbed that USB camera,\nthat webcam, and you plug it in and\n\n561\n00:29:03.985 --> 00:29:06.070\nit says, it does a little wait there.\n\n562\n00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:07.720\nAnd it says, installing new hardware.\n\n563\n00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.970\nGet a little green progress bar.\n\n564\n00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:12.060\nThere's a lot going on behind the scenes.\n\n565\n00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:15.350\nAnd if you understand where\nthese drivers are sitting and\n\n566\n00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:20.190\nwhy you need user permissions, right,\nrelated to kernel mode, why you need to be\n\n567\n00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:23.760\nan administrator to be able to make\ncore changes to the operating system?\n\n568\n00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:28.075\nThat's what's your doing every time you\ninstall one of these USB based devices or\n\n569\n00:29:28.075 --> 00:29:29.962\nthese plug and play ready devices.\n\n570\n00:29:29.962 --> 00:29:32.120\nSo Ronnie,\nI know that's a lot of information.\n\n571\n00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:35.346\nBut we really wanna just give you\nthe good basic foundations on some\n\n572\n00:29:35.346 --> 00:29:38.285\nthings that you really don't\nsee anymore and a lot of times,\n\n573\n00:29:38.285 --> 00:29:40.204\nyou don't realize are under the hood.\n\n574\n00:29:40.204 --> 00:29:43.001\nBut I think in the future,\nif you start out here,\n\n575\n00:29:43.001 --> 00:29:47.510\nyou'll know why certain things are\nhappening and why you need permissions and\n\n576\n00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:50.468\nprivileges, and\nwhy you need driver signatures.\n\n577\n00:29:50.468 --> 00:29:53.800\nCuz remember, at the end of the day,\n\n578\n00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:57.380\nit's about the user experience, want you\nto have the best user experience, and\n\n579\n00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:01.160\nyou have to do that by having a stable\noperating system, and it has to be secure.\n\n580\n00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.610\nAnd the other thing really\nis just making sure, and\n\n581\n00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:07.153\nensuring that your operating system is\nstable and that machine doesn't blue\n\n582\n00:30:07.153 --> 00:30:10.110\nscreen on you, which is definitely\nwhat we're trying to avoid.\n\n583\n00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:13.430\n&gt;&gt; No doubt, Wes, definitely a part of\nunderstanding the system architecture's\n\n584\n00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:15.300\nunderstanding that stability.\n\n585\n00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:19.230\nAnd one of the big changes that they\nmade inside of Windows a long time ago\n\n586\n00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:22.142\nwas to separate out that user mode and\nthe kernel mode.\n\n587\n00:30:22.142 --> 00:30:25.164\nSo that something that the user\ndoes does not that go ahead and\n\n588\n00:30:25.164 --> 00:30:27.072\naffect the entire operating system.\n\n589\n00:30:27.072 --> 00:30:29.371\nSo by limiting it in\nthe way that it happens,\n\n590\n00:30:29.371 --> 00:30:31.308\nit really does show you some things.\n\n591\n00:30:31.308 --> 00:30:34.610\nSo you may go, I've never experienced\nthis user mode and kernel mode.\n\n592\n00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:37.007\nWell, if you've ever locked\nup an application but\n\n593\n00:30:37.007 --> 00:30:40.410\nthe entire operating system still\ncontinued to work, you've actually\n\n594\n00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:43.552\nexperienced the architecture that\nWes has been describing here.\n\n595\n00:30:43.552 --> 00:30:47.552\nSo whether you're in 32 bit or\n64 bit, that is actually going to\n\n596\n00:30:47.552 --> 00:30:51.639\nplay a difference in how much memory\nis gonna get used on your system.\n\n597\n00:30:51.639 --> 00:30:53.855\nAnd so you do have to think about that,\n\n598\n00:30:53.855 --> 00:30:58.070\nespecially with these very memory\nintensive types of programs.\n\n599\n00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:01.080\nSo do understand that at least\nfrom the very beginning, and\n\n600\n00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:05.420\nas you start seeing as your work inside of\nWindows starts to develop and grow, you'll\n\n601\n00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:09.620\nend up seeing where it actually does come\ninto play a lot more often than you think.\n\n602\n00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:12.810\nWell, Wes, thank you again for\nintroducing us to some of these concepts.\n\n603\n00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:15.366\nThank you also for watching us today.\n\n604\n00:31:15.366 --> 00:31:18.824\nSigning off for ITPro TV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n605\n00:31:18.824 --> 00:31:19.732\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n606\n00:31:19.732 --> 00:31:23.935\n&gt;&gt; Stayed tuned right here for more\nWindows Operating System fundamentals.\n\n607\n00:31:23.935 --> 00:31:30.513\n[MUSIC]\n\n608\n00:31:30.513 --> 00:31:33.816\n&gt;&gt; Thank you

Greeting from, [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Coming at you live from San Francisco.\n\n4\n00:00:04.763 --> 00:00:08.648\n[CROSSTALK]\n[SOUND]\n\n5\n00:00:08.648 --> 00:00:11.936\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.936 --> 00:00:15.108\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.108 --> 00:00:17.199\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today,\n\n8\n00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.800\nwe're looking at Windows\noperating system fundamentals.\n\n9\n00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.014\nWe're specifically gonna be diving into\nthe world of configuring applications,\n\n10\n00:00:25.014 --> 00:00:27.617\nas well as learning a little\nbit more about the UAC.\n\n11\n00:00:27.617 --> 00:00:28.553\nAnd we have Mr.\n\n12\n00:00:28.553 --> 00:00:32.945\nWes Bryan here to explain what in\nthe world the UAC actually means for us.\n\n13\n00:00:32.945 --> 00:00:34.264\nWes, welcome back to our studios.\n\n14\n00:00:34.264 --> 00:00:35.226\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me here.\n\n15\n00:00:35.226 --> 00:00:37.158\nYeah, we are pretty mean on that one-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n16\n00:00:37.158 --> 00:00:38.134\n&gt;&gt; In that title.\n\n17\n00:00:38.134 --> 00:00:41.304\nThrowing you guys an acronym before\nthe show even starts, but the UAC's been\n\n18\n00:00:41.304 --> 00:00:44.390\naround for awhile and it is a security\nfeature that's built into Windows.\n\n19\n00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.626\nIt's one of the things that actually\nmarked a big departure from Microsoft's\n\n20\n00:00:48.626 --> 00:00:50.500\nearlier security architecture.\n\n21\n00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.800\nIt goes all the way back to well\neverybody's operating system that they\n\n22\n00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.740\nprobably like to forget,\nand that's Windows Vista.\n\n23\n00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.830\nNow I say that jokingly, I really\ndidn't have any problems with Vista.\n\n24\n00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.088\nBut it definitely was a departure from\nthe earlier XP model in which you\n\n25\n00:01:03.088 --> 00:01:07.365\ndidn't really have this little\ndialogue box appearing all the time.\n\n26\n00:01:07.365 --> 00:01:11.270\nBut we're gonna go ahead and we'll get to\nthe end of the UAC here in a little bit,\n\n27\n00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.670\nlike Ronnie said, we are talking\nabout configuring applications.\n\n28\n00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.757\nNow I want you to understand\nthat we're not in this class,\n\n29\n00:01:17.757 --> 00:01:20.410\nlet me just tell you guys\nwhat we're not gonna do.\n\n30\n00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.552\nWe're not gonna show you how to\nconfigure each individual application\n\n31\n00:01:23.552 --> 00:01:25.603\ncuz there are so\nmany applications out there.\n\n32\n00:01:25.603 --> 00:01:27.256\nBut you do have to know the basis for\n\n33\n00:01:27.256 --> 00:01:30.450\nwhen you're installing an application\non your Windows machine.\n\n34\n00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.704\nAnd one of the great things is we really\nonly have a couple of different formats we\n\n35\n00:01:34.704 --> 00:01:38.280\nhave to look at, and we're gonna\nlook at a couple of things today.\n\n36\n00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.180\nWe're gonna look at something\nknown as an EXE file, and\n\n37\n00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.420\nwe're gonna look at a MSI file and\nkind of explain what those are.\n\n38\n00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.170\nBecause traditionally,\n\n39\n00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.900\nthese have been the way we install\nmore of your traditional applications.\n\n40\n00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.080\nHowever, when Windows 8 came out,\nwe also got another subsystem,\n\n41\n00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.550\nif you will, application subsystem.\n\n42\n00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.865\nAnd that was something that originally was\ncalled, maybe you might remember this,\n\n43\n00:01:58.865 --> 00:01:59.434\nthe Metro UI.\n\n44\n00:01:59.434 --> 00:02:02.380\nAnd then after that, they renamed it,\nand today it's just the Modern UI.\n\n45\n00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.150\nWell these applications\nare a little bit different.\n\n46\n00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.100\nAnd where they get installed,\nhow they get installed, managed, and\n\n47\n00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.290\nmaintained are really\ndifferent than the way we've\n\n48\n00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.740\ntypically been doing this before\nthe invention of this Windows Store.\n\n49\n00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.180\nSo let's go ahead, and let's dive in and\n\n50\n00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.110\ntalk a little bit about\ntraditional applications.\n\n51\n00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.083\nNow when you go to install an application,\nit's fairly easy, in fact,\n\n52\n00:02:22.083 --> 00:02:23.463\nI've got one here on my desktop.\n\n53\n00:02:23.463 --> 00:02:26.983\nThis is a little installer package here,\nit's an executable and\n\n54\n00:02:26.983 --> 00:02:29.160\nyou might notice something right away.\n\n55\n00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.096\nAnd again, we're gonna kinda touch base on\nwhy the UAC is important as we go through\n\n56\n00:02:33.096 --> 00:02:35.249\nthis, so\nyou can kinda see what's going on.\n\n57\n00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:37.078\nNotice there's a little shield right here.\n\n58\n00:02:37.078 --> 00:02:41.900\nWell that shield is letting me know that\nif I decide that I'm gonna install this\n\n59\n00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.688\napplication, it's gonna trigger the UAC.\n\n60\n00:02:44.688 --> 00:02:47.010\nAnd you can see here it comes up.\n\n61\n00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.170\nAll right, and again, sorry about\nthe acronyms right first thing.\n\n62\n00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.230\nBut this is the User Account Control.\n\n63\n00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.870\nNow why is this important?\n\n64\n00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.480\nWhy should we have some kind of\nsecurity implementation like this and\n\n65\n00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.750\nwhat is it really doing for us?\n\n66\n00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.060\nWell when you go to\ninstall an application or\n\n67\n00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.170\nyou go to make a configuration\nlike we just did,\n\n68\n00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.100\nit's gonna make changes to the core\nfunctionality of the operating system.\n\n69\n00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.281\nAnd I say core functionality,\nwhen the operating system,\n\n70\n00:03:13.281 --> 00:03:16.788\nwe hope the goal is that\nthe functionality is gonna stay the same.\n\n71\n00:03:16.788 --> 00:03:20.925\nAnd that's what's really important about\nthe user account control as it relates to\n\n72\n00:03:20.925 --> 00:03:24.480\ninstalling applications,\nbecause if you install an application, and\n\n73\n00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.069\nit doesn't play nice, right?\n\n74\n00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.493\nIt doesn't follow a certain framework,\na security framework, a .NET framework and\n\n75\n00:03:31.493 --> 00:03:36.041\nstuff, the application interfaces\nthat they really develop these in.\n\n76\n00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:39.042\nThen it can start to cause problems\nwith some of the services that\n\n77\n00:03:39.042 --> 00:03:41.781\nare on your Windows machines\nas well as other components.\n\n78\n00:03:41.781 --> 00:03:47.241\nSo when we see something like this UAC,\nthis User Account Control, it's really\n\n79\n00:03:47.241 --> 00:03:52.820\ngood to verify find that you know what\nthe software is and who it's coming from.\n\n80\n00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.580\nNow the question is how do we do that?\n\n81\n00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.980\nHow do we verify that this\nsoftware is trustworthy?\n\n82\n00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.802\nWell that is where something\nknown as certificates come in.\n\n83\n00:04:01.802 --> 00:04:05.095\nNow, we don't really wanna get in to more\nadvance certificates or anything and\n\n84\n00:04:05.095 --> 00:04:08.043\nif you're going on to the MCSA track,\nif you're getting into server,\n\n85\n00:04:08.043 --> 00:04:11.162\nyou're definitely going to learn more\nabout public key infrastructure.\n\n86\n00:04:11.162 --> 00:04:15.224\nBut it really is important just knowing\na basic understanding on what's going\n\n87\n00:04:15.224 --> 00:04:19.880\non here, and what certificates mean for us\nwhen it comes to installing applications.\n\n88\n00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.213\nNow, let's go ahead, and let's just think\nof a certificate as nothing more than\n\n89\n00:04:23.213 --> 00:04:25.793\na digital security stamp, boom,\nput right on a piece of code.\n\n90\n00:04:25.793 --> 00:04:27.612\nNow what does that help us do?\n\n91\n00:04:27.612 --> 00:04:32.352\nWell the thing that it helps us do is,\nand in fact, let me show you guys,\n\n92\n00:04:32.352 --> 00:04:35.908\nif I show more details here,\nit lets me know that hey,\n\n93\n00:04:35.908 --> 00:04:39.910\nthis program is gonna install\nin a certain location.\n\n94\n00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.676\nNow the program location for this one is\ngonna be in a folder called programs.\n\n95\n00:04:44.676 --> 00:04:48.840\nProgram Files x86, and I'll show\nyou that location here in a second.\n\n96\n00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.594\nBut more specifically,\nnotice what it says.\n\n97\n00:04:51.594 --> 00:04:56.660\nIt says, show information about\nthe publisher's certificate.\n\n98\n00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.270\nAnd I didn't mean to click on that so\nquick here, but\n\n99\n00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.810\nwhat do we mean when we say\npublisher's certificate?\n\n100\n00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.720\nWell that's the authors of\nthis piece of software.\n\n101\n00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.845\nIn this case, the owners,\nthe publishers of Notepad++.\n\n102\n00:05:08.845 --> 00:05:11.805\nNow why is that important for us?\n\n103\n00:05:11.805 --> 00:05:15.831\nAll right,\nwell let's just go figuratively.\n\n104\n00:05:15.831 --> 00:05:19.870\nLet's say that Ronnie owns the company\nthat produces this software, right?\n\n105\n00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.230\nOr any piece of software\nthat we're going to install.\n\n106\n00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.010\nWell, I need a way, and\nhe's got a reputable company.\n\n107\n00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.355\nI need a way to make sure that I can\ntrack this back and I can find out.\n\n108\n00:05:28.355 --> 00:05:30.355\nWas that even Ronnie's company?\n\n109\n00:05:30.355 --> 00:05:33.540\nI mean I don't know, what is a file, is\njust a file and you guys know out there.\n\n110\n00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.555\nYou can download a lot of\nstuff up on the Internet, and\n\n111\n00:05:36.555 --> 00:05:38.910\nwho know where it comes from.\n\n112\n00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.875\nSo that's the first step in\nunderstanding whether you can\n\n113\n00:05:41.875 --> 00:05:43.915\ntrust this software or not.\n\n114\n00:05:43.915 --> 00:05:47.655\nNow as that relates to the User Account\nControl, in the earlier days prior to like\n\n115\n00:05:47.655 --> 00:05:50.955\nfor instance, Vista, when the user\naccount control first showed up.\n\n116\n00:05:50.955 --> 00:05:53.264\nIf you went to install\na piece of software,\n\n117\n00:05:53.264 --> 00:05:55.445\nyou wouldn't get this information.\n\n118\n00:05:55.445 --> 00:05:59.715\nIt would silently run or maybe\nan interactive interface for a little bit,\n\n119\n00:05:59.715 --> 00:06:04.760\nlike a Wizard driven installation,\nbut if it didn't play nice.\n\n120\n00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.000\nLet's say, for instance,\nwas Ronnie's company and somebody hijacked\n\n121\n00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.840\nmaybe that file and decided to put\na little bit of their code in there?\n\n122\n00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.560\nWe have no way to verify.\n\n123\n00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.700\nSo with the user account control, first\nof all, is that first security mechanism,\n\n124\n00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.720\nit's saying,\ndo you trust this application?\n\n125\n00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.744\nWell, if I know the download source,\nwell then maybe I trust it.\n\n126\n00:06:25.744 --> 00:06:29.440\nBut even more so, we wanna make sure that\neven if you do know the download source,\n\n127\n00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.890\nthe company that you got this from,\n\n128\n00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.260\nyou wanna be able to verify\nthat it is their software.\n\n129\n00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.870\nAnd that's where we can look\nat things like certificates.\n\n130\n00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:42.637\nAll right, now again, we don't really\nwanna dive down into the public\n\n131\n00:06:42.637 --> 00:06:46.611\nkey infrastructure that basically\nsets the precedence for\n\n132\n00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:50.758\nevery global transaction we do or\ninstallation of software.\n\n133\n00:06:50.758 --> 00:06:52.412\nBut notice what it tells you, right?\n\n134\n00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:56.600\nVery basically, this certificate is\nintended for the following purposes.\n\n135\n00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.845\nIt ensures this software came\nfrom the software publisher, and\n\n136\n00:07:00.845 --> 00:07:06.364\nmore importantly, it protects the software\nfrom alteration after publication.\n\n137\n00:07:06.364 --> 00:07:09.610\nAnd you might be asking yourself\nwell why should I even trust this?\n\n138\n00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.970\nWell if we look at this certification path\n\n139\n00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:17.190\nthere is a hierarchy out there of\ncompanies that provide these certificates.\n\n140\n00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:20.390\nAnd they ensure what they're doing,\nso that you can trust them.\n\n141\n00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.792\nAnd that's one of the important purposes\nof these certificates, and these digital\n\n142\n00:07:24.792 --> 00:07:28.828\nstamps, and being able to verity that\nthe publisher is who they say they are.\n\n143\n00:07:28.828 --> 00:07:33.868\nNow, once that's done, when it comes\nto installing a file like this or\n\n144\n00:07:33.868 --> 00:07:39.918\nan application a lot of times, it's just\na wizard driven installation, all right?\n\n145\n00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:43.280\nAnd that's always contingent on\nwhat application you have, right?\n\n146\n00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.145\nAnd we get some dialog boxes here\nthat we just followed through, right?\n\n147\n00:07:47.145 --> 00:07:49.140\nNothing really spectacular here, right?\n\n148\n00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.742\nYou guys have seen Next,\nNext, Next, Next, install,\n\n149\n00:07:51.742 --> 00:07:53.598\nwell that's essentially what this is.\n\n150\n00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:57.928\nThat's one good thing about the Wizard\ndriven installation is it makes it very\n\n151\n00:07:57.928 --> 00:08:02.059\neasy Most of your installations are gonna\nhave some kind of end user license\n\n152\n00:08:02.059 --> 00:08:04.289\nagreement that you have to enter into and\n\n153\n00:08:04.289 --> 00:08:08.710\nby clicking agree you are bound to the\nterms of that end user license agreement.\n\n154\n00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:12.780\nSo, it is important to understand that\nif you're using this software for\n\n155\n00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.580\na home environment maybe you're\nnot too worried about this.\n\n156\n00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.639\nBut as you move into\nthe corporate environment\n\n157\n00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:24.030\nIf you are not following the end-user\nlicense agreement or your company is not,\n\n158\n00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:28.480\nyou stand the chance of some pretty hefty\nfines if they were to ever catch you.\n\n159\n00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:33.430\nSo you have to be careful when you are in\na corporate environment and again we've\n\n160\n00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:37.770\ngotta have the right etiquette when\nwe're in the home environment, for sure.\n\n161\n00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:41.730\nBut it's definitely gonna be something\nthat you have to pay attention to inside\n\n162\n00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.250\nof a corporate environment.\n\n163\n00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.630\nNow, I want you to look at something here,\n\n164\n00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.140\nnotice that it says where\nit's being installed.\n\n165\n00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.210\nWe mentioned this earlier,\n\n166\n00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:54.120\nit says Program Files x86 Notepad\n++ well what is that about?\n\n167\n00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.920\nWell, let's go ahead and let's drill down\ninto out operating system a little bit\n\n168\n00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.370\nhere with file explorer and\nlet's see what they're talking about.\n\n169\n00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:04.150\nIf we go to this PC, Local disk (C:),\n\n170\n00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:08.170\nyou're gonna see a couple of folders\nhere that are waiting for us.\n\n171\n00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:13.520\nYou see Program Files and you see\nwhat is known as Program Files (x86).\n\n172\n00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.730\nWhy do I have two different\nprogram file directories?\n\n173\n00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:18.420\nOr a folder if you will.\n\n174\n00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:22.850\nWell that's because Windows\nallows you to run 32 bit\n\n175\n00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:27.350\nsoftware on top of a 64\nbit operating system.\n\n176\n00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:31.610\nSo what you're seeing here when you\nsee X86 is you're seeing that this.\n\n177\n00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:32.640\nYou can think of it in your mind.\n\n178\n00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.020\nIn fact, I don't think you\ncan rename a system folder,\n\n179\n00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.120\nbut you can think of it as\njust saying 32-bit, right?\n\n180\n00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.760\nThat's x86.\n\n181\n00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.650\nNow you might notice something\nis missing right here.\n\n182\n00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:44.220\nProgram Files doesn't say x86.\n\n183\n00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.200\nWhat does that mean?\n\n184\n00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.870\nWell, that's where your\n64-bit applications go.\n\n185\n00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:52.620\nWhen I install a 64-bit application,\nit goes into this directory.\n\n186\n00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:57.439\nSo it is very handy to be able to\nhave the ability, if you will,\n\n187\n00:09:57.439 --> 00:10:02.100\nto run 32-bit and\n64-bit on a 64-bit system.\n\n188\n00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.600\nNow, I have to stop you there because\nthat doesn't work on 32-bit, okay?\n\n189\n00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.400\nIf you have a 32-bit system,\n\n190\n00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.360\nyou don't have two folders.What you\nhave is a single folder, right?\n\n191\n00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:16.890\n32 bit system, you cannot install a 64\nbit application on a 32 bit system.\n\n192\n00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:17.720\nIt just doesn't work.\n\n193\n00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.520\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n194\n00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:25.220\nThe other way around, 32 bit also works\non 64 bit but you can't do vice versa.\n\n195\n00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.100\n64 bit doesn't work on 32 bit.\n\n196\n00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:32.750\nAll right, so that's a little bit about\nthe context of where you can expect\n\n197\n00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:34.980\nthese programs to be installed.\n\n198\n00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:35.780\nAnd it is important.\n\n199\n00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:39.420\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll just kinda next through this wizard.\n\n200\n00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:43.308\nAnd this is just any local customizations\nand stuff that you're doing.\n\n201\n00:10:43.308 --> 00:10:46.520\nAgain, remember at Dippers or\nany kind of third party application.\n\n202\n00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.370\nIt doesn't even have to be a third party\napplication it could be things like\n\n203\n00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:51.060\nMicrosoft Office and stuff.\n\n204\n00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:55.820\nThey're each gonna have their own unique\ntype of installation process for the most\n\n205\n00:10:55.820 --> 00:11:00.100\npart a lot of times it's just making\na couple of simple choices like this.\n\n206\n00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:04.730\nAnd just clicking next until finally\nyou get to the install option here.\n\n207\n00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:09.850\nNow, before I click install, I just want\nto kind of prove what I'm saying here.\n\n208\n00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:13.810\nI'm going to go back down\ninto that program x86 folder,\n\n209\n00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:20.370\nall right, and I want you to notice\nthat right here between INW here.\n\n210\n00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:21.560\nWe don't have Notepad, right?\n\n211\n00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.700\nSo, they're alphabetic, right,\nand it doesn't exist here.\n\n212\n00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.090\nSo, Notepad++ isn't installed.\n\n213\n00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:28.940\nLet's go ahead, and\n\n214\n00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:32.825\nlet's finish the installation process,\nand it churns through.\n\n215\n00:11:32.825 --> 00:11:34.225\nShouldn't take too long,\nand it's interesting.\n\n216\n00:11:34.225 --> 00:11:37.315\nYou put it there at the bottom,\nand here it is.\n\n217\n00:11:37.315 --> 00:11:38.485\nWe've got an installation.\n\n218\n00:11:38.485 --> 00:11:40.875\nNow there's update packages and\nstuff to this.\n\n219\n00:11:40.875 --> 00:11:45.525\nI'm not going to, this really isn't a,\nlet me cancel out of there before.\n\n220\n00:11:45.525 --> 00:11:47.555\nWe've got all kinds of things going on.\n\n221\n00:11:47.555 --> 00:11:49.635\nThis isn't an episode about Notepad++.\n\n222\n00:11:49.635 --> 00:11:54.810\nThis is more of an episode\non what a .exe is, okay?\n\n223\n00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:57.680\nNow, you might say, well,\nwhat do you mean, dot exe, Wes?\n\n224\n00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.850\nI don't understand.\n\n225\n00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:03.850\nWell, that's a file extension that\ndenotes, basically, an application.\n\n226\n00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:09.800\nAnd we can actually see that here by\nusing the desktop directory here.\n\n227\n00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.370\nNotice that we have Npp-7,\n\n228\n00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:17.710\nso this is the installer,\nNotepad ++ version seven installer.\n\n229\n00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:21.340\nYou say well wait a second,\nI don't see a file extension.\n\n230\n00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.290\nWell we can actually change that,\nif I go up here to View,\n\n231\n00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:27.220\nthere's this option over here\nthat says file name extensions.\n\n232\n00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:32.300\nAnd I can choose that, and\nnow you'll see that there's EXE, okay?\n\n233\n00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.330\nBut notice there's also a program.\n\n234\n00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:35.830\nThat's an EXE file too.\n\n235\n00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:37.900\nSo what are we talking about?\n\n236\n00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.210\nIt's kind of interesting.\n\n237\n00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:42.720\nIt's an executable that\ninstalls an executable.\n\n238\n00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:47.690\nSo keep in mind that executables\ncan be installation wizards,\n\n239\n00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:51.680\nif you will, that install a program but\ninside of that program,\n\n240\n00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.420\nyou also have its own executable\nthat runs the software.\n\n241\n00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:59.660\nWe can also see that just by digging\nback down in here to Program Files,\n\n242\n00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:04.030\nyou'll see now between Microsoft.NET there\nand Windows Defender, we have this little\n\n243\n00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:09.070\ndirectory called Notepad++, and\nnotice that the executable is here.\n\n244\n00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:10.610\nNow Ronnie,\nI know that's a little confusing,\n\n245\n00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:15.170\nwe use an executable to\ninstall an executable.\n\n246\n00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:18.820\nBut it is one of the common ways\nyou install your applications,\n\n247\n00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.190\nso makes it a little bit easier\nto distribute applications and\n\n248\n00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:26.500\nit certainly as you can see made it fairly\neasy to install this type of application.\n\n249\n00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.330\n&gt;&gt; Now, Wes, there's no doubt that\na lot of times when you start to\n\n250\n00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:33.560\ndownload of course program from\nthe internet You might find that these\n\n251\n00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.690\nare actually gonna be the types of files\nthat you'll see the majority of the time.\n\n252\n00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:41.240\nAnd that's because people that program it,\nthey choose what the file type's gonna be.\n\n253\n00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.870\nAnd I wanna make it as easy as\npossible for you to install this.\n\n254\n00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:50.270\nSo this particular file type's actually\nbeen around for a long, long time but\n\n255\n00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:55.110\nMicrosoft, of course, has a way to try and\nmake it a little bit easier so\n\n256\n00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:58.110\nit's not just a generic type of install.\n\n257\n00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:01.890\nAnd Wes, you're gonna actually introduce\nus to something called a .MSI?\n\n258\n00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:02.620\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n259\n00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:06.180\nSo when we talk about\ndeployment of applications,\n\n260\n00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:10.980\nyou don't deploy applications in an\nenterprise environment from an executable,\n\n261\n00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.980\nnot in a Windows environment.\n\n262\n00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:17.120\nIt doesn't mean that you can't Distribute\napplications that are EXEs, but\n\n263\n00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.910\nwhen you use some of the Microsoft\nenterprise level technologies,\n\n264\n00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:22.260\nwhat you have to use is\nthat file extension.\n\n265\n00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.150\nThat file type that Ronnie just mentioned.\n\n266\n00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.900\nThe Microsoft Installer Package.\n\n267\n00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.480\nI know that acronym's a little\nbit interesting there but\n\n268\n00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.090\nit's essentially an installer package.\n\n269\n00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:34.800\nAnd what it includes Is\na whole bundle of stuff.\n\n270\n00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.560\nNow the executables,\nagain, can hold these too.\n\n271\n00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:42.710\nBut MSIs will also do things\na little bit more robust.\n\n272\n00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:46.480\nIt'll look into the registry and it'll\nkeep track during the installation of\n\n273\n00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.340\nwhat's being installed,\nwhere it's being installed and\n\n274\n00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:54.630\nMSI files will also,\nduring the uninstall process, we call,\n\n275\n00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:59.450\nwe have a thing you wanna try to avoid\nover time of using an operating system.\n\n276\n00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:01.200\nIt's called tattooing the registry, right.\n\n277\n00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.270\nI got plenty of tattoos,\nright, they're there for life.\n\n278\n00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:06.980\nWell, think about a tattoo on\nyour configuration database,\n\n279\n00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:11.190\nthat once a program's uninstalled,\nit leaves the remnants of all those little\n\n280\n00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:14.640\nentries that it made and\nit didn't erase them completely.\n\n281\n00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.080\nWell, that's called\ntattooing the registry.\n\n282\n00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:20.430\nAnd over the time you can get a lot of\nthis extra information in your registry\n\n283\n00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:24.600\nthat can start to cause problems and start\nto degrade the performance of the machine.\n\n284\n00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.160\nSo the MSI files also\nhave the benefit that\n\n285\n00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.460\nnot only does the installer keep\ntrack of those locations but\n\n286\n00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:35.560\nthe uninstaller that's a part of it as\nwell It will keep track of what to remove,\n\n287\n00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.190\nnow it goes a little bit father too\nbecause it also has additional files too\n\n288\n00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:44.880\nlike these INF files that tell\nthe installer, the Microsoft installer,\n\n289\n00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:49.370\nexactly what to do through the process as\nwell as how to configure certain things.\n\n290\n00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:50.746\nSo, it's a little bit more robust.\n\n291\n00:15:50.746 --> 00:15:53.243\nEven though it looks exactly\nthe same to us, right.\n\n292\n00:15:53.243 --> 00:15:56.100\nIt's a file extension that changes.\n\n293\n00:15:56.100 --> 00:16:00.444\nYou can also do things like publishing and\npushing out MSI files to install\n\n294\n00:16:00.444 --> 00:16:04.310\napplications within things,\nlike an active directory domain.\n\n295\n00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:07.530\nSo, you can also do, you don't have\nto be in an enterprise environment.\n\n296\n00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:08.940\nSo, we do want to keep that in mind.\n\n297\n00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:12.210\nWe're really focused on local\ninstallations, but just understand\n\n298\n00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:15.894\nthat that's one of the benefits that you\nget when you are using these MSI files.\n\n299\n00:16:15.894 --> 00:16:20.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there is no doubt that MSI files,\nthey really were designed\n\n300\n00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:23.990\nto make sure that you could make that\ncomplete removal if you need to, but\n\n301\n00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:29.220\nalso to ensure that whatever else\nthat application may need to install\n\n302\n00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:31.530\nwas right there without\nyou having to go and\n\n303\n00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:35.640\ndownload another third-party utility\nto get all the things that you needed.\n\n304\n00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.534\nBut along with that, of course,\n\n305\n00:16:37.534 --> 00:16:40.453\napplications have continued\nto change over time.\n\n306\n00:16:40.453 --> 00:16:47.185\nSo, as old as the EXP is, the MSI is not\nexactly a very young notion itself, but\n\n307\n00:16:47.185 --> 00:16:53.816\nwe do have something now that we've\ntalked about as being the modern UI apps.\n\n308\n00:16:53.816 --> 00:16:58.101\nSo, Wes, what's the difference between\nwhat were just talking about in this idea\n\n309\n00:16:58.101 --> 00:17:00.050\nwhat we call modern ui apps?\n\n310\n00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:04.350\n&gt;&gt; Well, the modern UI apps pretty much\nchanged [LAUGH] the way application\n\n311\n00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:08.650\nare installed and that came out in Windows\n8, and then revise on Windows 8.1.\n\n312\n00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:12.270\nAnd again, these modern ui apps there\nwork on something known as the,\n\n313\n00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:13.970\nthere's two different APIs, right?\n\n314\n00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:19.830\nThe traditional API that we use is,\nfor instance, like the explorer.exe.\n\n315\n00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:25.660\nHowever, they have an RT API that's\nused for these applications, too.\n\n316\n00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:28.530\nThe one thing I do wanna kinda\nmention before I forget, though,\n\n317\n00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:32.650\nis I wanna show you guys how you could,\nand do an installation of an MSI file.\n\n318\n00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:36.669\nI've actually got one here\non our Windows 10 machine.\n\n319\n00:17:36.669 --> 00:17:41.038\nNow, one of the things about the MSI files\nis the publishers of these MSI files work\n\n320\n00:17:41.038 --> 00:17:43.270\na little bit closer to Microsoft on this.\n\n321\n00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:48.213\nSo, for instance, if I need to do, maybe\nI needed Chrome in the enterprise level\n\n322\n00:17:48.213 --> 00:17:52.668\nenvironment, because we want to use\nthat browser for whatever reason.\n\n323\n00:17:52.668 --> 00:17:55.620\nWell, they have a Google 4 business, and\n\n324\n00:17:55.620 --> 00:18:00.458\nyou can see with this MSI file here,\nthey are working with Microsoft in\n\n325\n00:18:00.458 --> 00:18:05.460\norder to ensure that this installation\nprocess is gonna be successful.\n\n326\n00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:09.340\nSo, let's go ahead and show you,\nthere's a utility, cuz Ronnie\n\n327\n00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:12.560\nhit the nail on the head here when he said\nboy, these MSI files have been around.\n\n328\n00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.350\nThere's actually a little utility that's\ntucked away, and we don't see it a lot,\n\n329\n00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:18.260\nbecause we're so used to the point and\nclick, and wizard driven\n\n330\n00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:22.430\ninstallations that you can use, and\nthat's called the MSI executive utility.\n\n331\n00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:25.990\nI'm gonna go ahead, and what I'll do\nis open up a PowerShell right here, and\n\n332\n00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:29.900\nwe'll kinda show you what\nyou can do with MSI exec.\n\n333\n00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.640\nSo let me go ahead and\nget down to the root here.\n\n334\n00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.810\nAnd we'll do our DIR,\nmake sure that that is there.\n\n335\n00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:40.420\nOkay, so, the benefit of the MSI exec,\nor the MSI executive utility,\n\n336\n00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.560\nis the fact that I can do things like\nscripted base installations, right?\n\n337\n00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.840\nI don't have to have an interact\nInstallation process.\n\n338\n00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.230\nAnd the other thing, too, is logging and\n\n339\n00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:54.650\nhaving access to logs pretty readily,\nis another great thing to have.\n\n340\n00:18:54.650 --> 00:19:00.240\nSo, let's go ahead and show you how you\ncan do an install through MSI exec.\n\n341\n00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:04.760\nSo, if I did MSI exec, all right,\nit is an executable but\n\n342\n00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:09.880\nremember that PowerShell and\nCommand Prompt today have come a long way.\n\n343\n00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.230\nCuz you don't really have to type\nthe exe if you do not want to.\n\n344\n00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:19.485\nSo, we'll go ahead, and we're gonna do\na forward slash i here for install.\n\n345\n00:19:19.485 --> 00:19:22.565\nAll right, and the next thing I'm\ngonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n346\n00:19:22.565 --> 00:19:26.665\ntab and point to the MSI file.\n\n347\n00:19:26.665 --> 00:19:29.415\nNow, it's kinda interesting, PowerShell,\n\n348\n00:19:29.415 --> 00:19:33.645\nthe MSI exec doesn't understand\nwhat we calla relative path.\n\n349\n00:19:33.645 --> 00:19:35.195\nSo, you actually have to take that out.\n\n350\n00:19:35.195 --> 00:19:39.050\nIf you guys are starting to get familiar,\nyou've seen maybe some of our PowerShell\n\n351\n00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:42.062\nepisodes, and you're starting to\nget used to that tab Autofill.\n\n352\n00:19:42.062 --> 00:19:45.690\nMSI exec doesn't understand\nthat format there,\n\n353\n00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:48.550\nso just keep in mind you'll\nhave to keep that off.\n\n354\n00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:51.830\nAll right, so, the next thing that we're\ngonna do is we're gonna go ahead, and\n\n355\n00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:54.750\nwe're going to add\na logging functionality,\n\n356\n00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:59.690\ncuz I want to show you one of the benefits\nof using this type of installation.\n\n357\n00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:01.944\nAnd we'll go ahead, and we'll choose.\n\n358\n00:20:01.944 --> 00:20:04.646\nThese are the options,\nactually, so that's log.\n\n359\n00:20:04.646 --> 00:20:06.774\nAnd there's a slew of\noptions that you could say.\n\n360\n00:20:06.774 --> 00:20:10.158\nI'm gonna go ahead and do all options\nincluding verbosity there, so\n\n361\n00:20:10.158 --> 00:20:12.210\nwe can see a little bit more information.\n\n362\n00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:16.600\nWe'll say log here, and then I'm gonna\ngo ahead, and I'm gonna name the log.\n\n363\n00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:21.160\nLet me back out of here, so you guys\ncould see that a little bit better.\n\n364\n00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:30.578\nAll right, I'll put this on C:, and we'll\njust call this the Chromeinstall.txt.\n\n365\n00:20:30.578 --> 00:20:34.850\nAnd here's the other thing,\nnotice that we have the wizard\n\n366\n00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:39.260\nthat was launching up during notepad plus\nplus, what if I don't want an interaction?\n\n367\n00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:42.092\nWhat if I don't want people to know that\nwe're installing it during some kind of\n\n368\n00:20:42.092 --> 00:20:43.121\nscripting functionality?\n\n369\n00:20:43.121 --> 00:20:47.717\nWell, I can actually put a quiet on\nthe end of this, and when I run it,\n\n370\n00:20:47.717 --> 00:20:49.480\nit should look like that.\n\n371\n00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's one thing that you could see.\n\n372\n00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.680\nIt's not supposed to happen.\n\n373\n00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.810\nAll right, so-\n&gt;&gt; You're missing a c after-\n\n374\n00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:57.070\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n375\n00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:58.315\nI'm glad Ronnie's got here.\n\n376\n00:20:58.315 --> 00:21:00.900\nRonnie's is my word processor\nbecause you don't have one inside of\n\n377\n00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:01.686\nthe command prompt.\n\n378\n00:21:01.686 --> 00:21:05.330\nHow about MSI exec, and\nwe'll try that there.\n\n379\n00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:12.265\nAll right, and apparently,\nI've got one of my options\n\n380\n00:21:12.265 --> 00:21:17.090\nwrong here.\n\n381\n00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:20.430\nAnd I wonder, give me one moment here.\n\n382\n00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:24.570\nIf the logging option needs\nto be a separate asterisk.\n\n383\n00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:25.700\nThere it is, okay.\n\n384\n00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:26.550\nSo, I missed the space.\n\n385\n00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:28.290\nLet me show you guys what I did here.\n\n386\n00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:29.900\nAnd syntax helps, just like Ronnie says.\n\n387\n00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:33.660\nSpelling the right thing,\nnotice the asterisk symbol?\n\n388\n00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.250\nThis is an option,\na flag that you can throw and say, hey,\n\n389\n00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:38.510\ngive me every single thing in the log.\n\n390\n00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:43.220\nBut the problem is it needs a delimiter\nthere, or a space, and that's the issue.\n\n391\n00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:46.840\nNow, notice that, or\nmaybe what you don't notice,\n\n392\n00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.970\nI don't really notice that\nanything is going on here.\n\n393\n00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:51.258\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nminimize my PowerShell.\n\n394\n00:21:51.258 --> 00:21:54.990\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and minimize, and\nlook at what happens on the desktop.\n\n395\n00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:58.960\nMy Chrome icon shows up right away.\n\n396\n00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:03.260\nSo, I didn't get any interaction\nas far as working with this, so\n\n397\n00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:07.270\nyou can imagine if you need the supported\nend user, you don't need to bug them.\n\n398\n00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:10.060\nYou don't want to bug them for\nthe installation process.\n\n399\n00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:14.380\nThis is a good way that you can script it\nout, and you can add that quiet option.\n\n400\n00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.670\nThen you don't have to worry\nabout bugging the user.\n\n401\n00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:20.330\nNow, I wanna kinda show you this log here.\n\n402\n00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:22.428\nIt should be on C:, let's make sure.\n\n403\n00:22:22.428 --> 00:22:27.900\nOkay, so, one of the things that I\ntold you, I said that inside of your\n\n404\n00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:34.520\ninstallation process, it makes it\nmakes entries into the registry.\n\n405\n00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.130\nWell, we can actually see\nthat in this log file,\n\n406\n00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:42.050\nwhich is another thing that is really\ncool about having this MSI log.\n\n407\n00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:43.620\nCan't find h key.\n\n408\n00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:46.040\nAll right, well,\nlet's go ahead and scroll down.\n\n409\n00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.920\nThis doesn't look like it's too much.\n\n410\n00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.550\nProbably something in front of HKEY,\nprobably like an application GUID.\n\n411\n00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:54.870\nOkay, so\nI can look at the areas that it's using.\n\n412\n00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:57.430\nYou can see some of the temporary files.\n\n413\n00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:01.830\nNow, remember what I said, 64-bit gets\ninstalled in the Program Files directory,\n\n414\n00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:03.480\nnot in the x86?\n\n415\n00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.820\nWell, notice where it's going, all right?\n\n416\n00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:06.780\nAnd that's funny.\n\n417\n00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:10.910\nI say that, this looks like it may be,\ntwo installation types.\n\n418\n00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:13.410\nThere it is, I was gonna say,\nwait a minute, this is the 64-bit.\n\n419\n00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:16.640\nBut you can see it's actually\ninstalling in two different locations,\n\n420\n00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.850\nwhich I think is interesting in and\nof itself.\n\n421\n00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:20.620\nI don't really have an answer for\nthat one.\n\n422\n00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:24.110\nBut this is definitely the 64-bit\ninstaller and application.\n\n423\n00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:26.820\nBut I wanted to show you, and\nthese are all the locations that it,\n\n424\n00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:29.030\nmakes that it makes entries.\n\n425\n00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:31.100\nIt shows you something\nknown as the UserSID.\n\n426\n00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:33.860\nIt's what the operating system\nsees as my account right here.\n\n427\n00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:37.090\nSo, this information's really\ngood to have if you need to do\n\n428\n00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:41.220\nthings like troubleshooting why\nan installation did or didn't happen, and\n\n429\n00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.230\nwhether it was successful or not, right?\n\n430\n00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:46.190\nYou can see right here,\nInstallation has completed successfully.\n\n431\n00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:49.360\nAnd the user was not\ninterrupted with any of it.\n\n432\n00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.445\nNow, Ronnie asked a good question.\n\n433\n00:23:50.445 --> 00:23:53.973\nI did want to just take a second to show\nthat MSI file, but I really want to get\n\n434\n00:23:53.973 --> 00:23:58.117\nback to Ronnie's question about the modern\nUI, because it is really important today,\n\n435\n00:23:58.117 --> 00:24:00.807\nbecause it's a common thing\nthat we're gonna be using.\n\n436\n00:24:00.807 --> 00:24:05.111\nAnd you'll probably see we're gonna\nbe using it more and more as Windows,\n\n437\n00:24:05.111 --> 00:24:09.020\nmaybe not Windows 10 but\nas we move in to other operating systems.\n\n438\n00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.120\nSo let me go ahead and show you that.\n\n439\n00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:16.591\nNow, we noticed that when I\ndid the Installer, all right?\n\n440\n00:24:16.591 --> 00:24:20.915\nIn the Notepad++, notice that I got this\n\n441\n00:24:20.915 --> 00:24:25.745\nwarning with the user account control that\nsaid, can you verify the publisher, well,\n\n442\n00:24:25.745 --> 00:24:28.873\nlet's go ahead and let's open up\nthe Windows Store here real quick.\n\n443\n00:24:28.873 --> 00:24:33.690\nSo If I\"m gonna get an application\nin the Modern UI apps,\n\n444\n00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:37.440\nI'm gonna get it from this location,\nright, the Windows Store itself.\n\n445\n00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.880\nAnd let me show you where\nthose are actually stored.\n\n446\n00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.020\nNow, the next thing that I'm gonna do,\n\n447\n00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:43.140\nguys, I don't recommend\nyou guys doing out there.\n\n448\n00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:47.270\nAnd this is just for the purposes of\nshowing you where they're located.\n\n449\n00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:51.600\nThese areas and the reason I say that\nis because this is typically a hidden\n\n450\n00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:55.680\ndirectory, and it's hidden for a reason\nand you'll see why here in a second.\n\n451\n00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:00.820\nBut if I go into the program files, and\nagain this is the 64 bit folder and\n\n452\n00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.950\nI choose to unhide these items.\n\n453\n00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:07.060\nNotice that we have this WindowsApps\nlocation, all right, and\n\n454\n00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:08.780\nif I dig into here,\n\n455\n00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:14.020\nhere are all the Modern UI applications\nthat come bundled in by default.\n\n456\n00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:17.795\nAnd if I choose my Start Menu,\nyou'll see that these Modern UI apps,\n\n457\n00:25:17.795 --> 00:25:20.435\nthey have a little bit different look and\nfeel.\n\n458\n00:25:20.435 --> 00:25:22.970\nThey're actually on the right\nhand side of the Start Menu.\n\n459\n00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:26.750\nAnd I do get the ability, if I need to,\nI can change these tiles.\n\n460\n00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:28.400\nI can move them around if I need to.\n\n461\n00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.150\nAnd again, we're not really looking\nat the Start Menu too much here.\n\n462\n00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:33.630\nBut I can also uninstall\nthem from this location,\n\n463\n00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:35.700\nwhich is,\nI mean that's what we're talking about.\n\n464\n00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:36.820\nConfiguring applications.\n\n465\n00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:40.879\nSo I can actually uninstall some of\nthese Modern UI apps from this location.\n\n466\n00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:42.590\nLet me go ahead and\n\n467\n00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:48.290\nshow you an installation of one of these\nModern UI apps just so you can see\n\n468\n00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:53.330\nthat it really isn't any different than\nwhat we do with the other applications.\n\n469\n00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:54.860\nAnd actually it's kinda easier.\n\n470\n00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:58.730\nSo I guess I'll just take one,\neverybody's favorite music one.\n\n471\n00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:00.770\nWe'll install Pandora.\n\n472\n00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:02.880\nAll right, so here's Pandora here.\n\n473\n00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:08.160\nAnd if I decide that I want to install\nthis, I'll choose install, all right.\n\n474\n00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:10.980\nNow you can see that it's working, right.\n\n475\n00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:13.190\nWell what's it doing?\n\n476\n00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:15.390\nIt's starting a download.\n\n477\n00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:18.130\nNotice I didn't get,\nwell it's downloading.\n\n478\n00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:20.070\nOkay, so here we go.\n\n479\n00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:21.391\nI haven't done anything, right.\n\n480\n00:26:21.391 --> 00:26:25.360\nAll I did is said install,\nand I can launch it now?\n\n481\n00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:30.830\nWell why can I launch it, why didn't I get\na trigger of the User Account Control?\n\n482\n00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:35.510\nAnd that's the difference between the way\nModern UI apps are maintained versus\n\n483\n00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:38.420\nthese standalone installers that we use.\n\n484\n00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.110\nMicrosoft manages these.\n\n485\n00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:43.860\nThrough the Windows Store they update\nthem, they manage them, they install them,\n\n486\n00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:48.202\nthey manage the uninstall and\nwhy is it that we trust them?\n\n487\n00:26:48.202 --> 00:26:50.560\nWe've gotta trust them right,\nthe User Account Control didn't say,\n\n488\n00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.520\nhey verify the publisher,\nthat's because Microsoft has already\n\n489\n00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.420\ndone that they even get\ninto this Windows Store.\n\n490\n00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:57.472\nLet me show you fact right now.\n\n491\n00:26:57.472 --> 00:27:00.280\nAll right if I dive down in here,\n\n492\n00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:02.970\nyou're gonna notice that there are some\nfolders in here, all right, and\n\n493\n00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:05.750\nif I try to get it,\nit's actually gonna let me get in here.\n\n494\n00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:09.570\nGuys if it gives you a warning and says\naccess is denied, you have to make some\n\n495\n00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:13.510\npermission modifications here,\nI do not recommend doing that.\n\n496\n00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:15.070\nThere's a reason Microsoft\n\n497\n00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.390\ntries to ensure that you can't\nget into these locations here.\n\n498\n00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:21.860\nLet me see.\n\n499\n00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:24.310\nTrying to find, there's a PX file.\n\n500\n00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:27.090\nGive me a second here guys,\nI want to find the.\n\n501\n00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:28.340\nIt should be in here somewhere.\n\n502\n00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:29.380\nOkay, there we go.\n\n503\n00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:31.120\nYou can see signatures, right.\n\n504\n00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:33.060\nNotice that we have these\nsignatures right here.\n\n505\n00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:37.340\nWell, that's because they\nhave already signed this app.\n\n506\n00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:42.330\nMicrosoft already trusts this application,\nand essentially the reason we didn't\n\n507\n00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:46.450\nget the verify the publisher is because\nMicrosoft verified the publisher and\n\n508\n00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:50.460\nthe stability of the application before\nit ever got to the Windows Store.\n\n509\n00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:53.590\nSo that is one of the good\nthings when it comes to\n\n510\n00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:56.760\ninstalling these apps\nfrom the Windows Store.\n\n511\n00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.850\nRonnie I know we're running\na little short on time here so\n\n512\n00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:00.888\nlet me just show one more thing here.\n\n513\n00:28:00.888 --> 00:28:03.980\nAnd I wanna show you how easy\nit is to uninstall an app.\n\n514\n00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:07.220\nIn fact, you can update them by the way\nlet me make mention of that is when\n\n515\n00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:10.940\nan update comes out right there from\nthe Windows Store I can choose update.\n\n516\n00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:13.190\nBut you'll see if we go\nto the start menu here.\n\n517\n00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:21.280\nAll right, and I right-click on Pandora in\nthis case I can choose Uninstall, right,\n\n518\n00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:27.150\nand it lets me know, warning,\nthat if you do this it's gonna disappear.\n\n519\n00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:31.020\nNow, with the uninstallation\nof certain programs,\n\n520\n00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:33.730\nyou have to go to Programs and\nFeatures, all right.\n\n521\n00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:34.650\nKeep that in mind.\n\n522\n00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:35.990\nAnd if I open up Programs and\n\n523\n00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:40.100\nFeatures, I can see the applications\nthat are already installed by default.\n\n524\n00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:42.920\nThere's my Chrome that we just installed.\n\n525\n00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.860\nThere's my Notepad++.\n\n526\n00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:47.660\nNotice up here at the top that\nif I choose Uninstall and\n\n527\n00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:50.350\nChange, all I've gotta do is click this.\n\n528\n00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:51.030\nClick that button.\n\n529\n00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:55.461\nAll right, and usually what'll happen,\nit doesn't always happen, but\n\n530\n00:28:55.461 --> 00:28:58.839\nusually what'll happen is\nthe applications, good applications, have\n\n531\n00:28:58.839 --> 00:29:02.930\ntheir own uninstaller built right in, and\nit'll just launch the uninstaller, right.\n\n532\n00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:08.620\nAnd close, and if we look, well,\nI've still got my installer package, but\n\n533\n00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:14.140\nif I go down into local disk C,\nprogram files x86,\n\n534\n00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:17.220\njust like we had when we started\nthe episode it's no longer there.\n\n535\n00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:20.860\nSo it's fairly easy to manage these as\nlong as you know where you're looking and\n\n536\n00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:23.415\nkeep in mind that when you're\ndownloading software that\n\n537\n00:29:23.415 --> 00:29:27.200\ndoesn't come from the Windows Store, make\nsure its a trusted installation source so\n\n538\n00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.930\nyou know that you're gonna maintain\nsome kind of stability in your Windows\n\n539\n00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:33.930\noperating system and isn't gonna\ncause some kind of security concern.\n\n540\n00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:36.700\n&gt;&gt; The other thing that you also want\nto make sure you understand about these\n\n541\n00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:39.940\ntypes of Modern UI apps,\nespecially in going to the Windows Store,\n\n542\n00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:43.980\nis that you have to have an account to\nmake sure that it actually installs.\n\n543\n00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:48.010\nSo if you didn't set one up\nwhen you first went ahead and\n\n544\n00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:53.830\ninstalled Windows 10 or Windows 8.1,\nit will actually ask you to go ahead and\n\n545\n00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:58.590\ncreate one so that you can get access to\nthat store and be able to also download.\n\n546\n00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:02.520\nWithout that you'll probably actually find\nyourself not being able to do very much\n\n547\n00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:05.240\nin terms of that Modern UI app as well.\n\n548\n00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.415\nOkay now Wes, do we have anything\nelse that we need to show?\n\n549\n00:30:08.415 --> 00:30:10.540\nWe've got probably,\nmaybe a couple of minutes left.\n\n550\n00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:13.460\n&gt;&gt; Well I think we're gonna have to\ngo into a part two because I do have\n\n551\n00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:14.200\nsome other things.\n\n552\n00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:17.300\nThis is the configuring\napplications in the UAC.\n\n553\n00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:18.920\nWe talked about the UAC, but\n\n554\n00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:21.150\none thing I didn't show you at\nall was how to configure it.\n\n555\n00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:22.890\nSo I've talked a little bit too much.\n\n556\n00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:24.500\nWe're probably gonna have\nto go into a part two.\n\n557\n00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:25.940\nSo how about we save it for that?\n\n558\n00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:27.400\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great.\n\n559\n00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:30.530\nNow remember that what you've actually\nseen here, right, is the different types\n\n560\n00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:34.120\nof applications that you can\ngenerally see in terms of an install.\n\n561\n00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:36.510\nYou download something from the Internet.\n\n562\n00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:38.590\nYou'll probably see it as\nactually being an .exe,\n\n563\n00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:42.642\nan executable file, or a .msi,\nand you just run them as normal.\n\n564\n00:30:42.642 --> 00:30:45.020\nIf you're get something\nout of the Windows Store,\n\n565\n00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:48.240\nwell just realize that Windows\nhas already validated everything.\n\n566\n00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:51.520\nAnd that you pretty much can\nrun that inside of Windows and\n\n567\n00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.220\nbe perfectly fine with it.\n\n568\n00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:55.970\nBut there's a lot more to go in terms\nof that User Account Control, and\n\n569\n00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:58.340\nwe'll talk about some of\nthe safety things there.\n\n570\n00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:01.300\nBut we're gonna save that for\nthe part two, just like Wes said.\n\n571\n00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:05.250\nSo, signing off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n572\n00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:06.230\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n573\n00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:10.861\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more\nWindows operating system fundamentals.\n\n574\n00:31:10.861 --> 00:31:16.667\n[MUSIC].\n\n575\n00:31:16.667 --> 00:31:18.645\nThank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

The team emphasizes this because an important part of keeping your network secure is keeping regular desktops secure as well.  They show how to enable windows features, and configure smart screen technology.  Lastly, the team briefly demonstrates and describes the different settings available for configuring the UAC.",

from\n\n3\n00:00:03.991 --> 00:00:05.501\nSan Francisco California.\n\n4\n00:00:05.501 --> 00:00:06.868\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n5\n00:00:06.868 --> 00:00:08.227\n[MUSIC]\n\n6\n00:00:08.227 -->

host, Ronnie Wong, and\n\n9\n00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.290\ntoday we're taking a look at\nWindows Operating System Fundamentals.\n\n10\n00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.400\nWe're specifically gonna\nactually be going into a part two\n\n11\n00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.420\non Configuring Applications and\nthe UAC as well.\n\n12\n00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.360\nAnd here to help us out with some of\nthe extra details that we couldn't\n\n13\n00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.920\nfit into the part one is Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n14\n00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.010\nWes, welcome back to the show.\n\n15\n00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.000\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, Ronnie.\n\n16\n00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.998\nYeah, that's probably one of the most\nPC ways to say Wes talks too much.\n\n17\n00:00:37.998 --> 00:00:41.021\n[LAUGH] That's right,\nwe did have some additional things.\n\n18\n00:00:41.021 --> 00:00:42.331\nAnd it's kinda interesting,\n\n19\n00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:45.420\nwe called the first part of this\nConfiguring Applications in the UAC.\n\n20\n00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.630\nAnd I mentioned the UAC, but I certainly\ndidn't show you anything about it.\n\n21\n00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.640\nSo, we're gonna get into that as well.\n\n22\n00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.650\nBut we do have a couple of intermediate\nitems, I guess you could say,\n\n23\n00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.480\nthat we also wanna look at too.\n\n24\n00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.340\nDid they call out on the MTA exam just so\nyou'll be aware of them?\n\n25\n00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.350\nWe wanna make sure to have\naccess to that information.\n\n26\n00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.370\nAnd we did talk about configuring and\ninstalling the applications but\n\n27\n00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.430\nthere are a couple of other things that\nyou can do when it comes to configuring\n\n28\n00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.680\nhow for instance the UAC interacts\nas well as how applications start.\n\n29\n00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.286\nAnd then also something that we\ndidn't mention was Windows features.\n\n30\n00:01:22.286 --> 00:01:25.948\nAnd this is something that they call out\non the MTA exams wanting you to just know\n\n31\n00:01:25.948 --> 00:01:29.160\nwhat the features are and\nhow you would gain access to them.\n\n32\n00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.470\nHow you would install them and\nhow you would uninstall them?\n\n33\n00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.320\nSo, we're gonna take a look at\nthat right here in this episode.\n\n34\n00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.550\nSo, the first thing that we're gonna do\nis we're gonna dive in to something that\n\n35\n00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.770\nstill relates to the first part of\nthis and that's application start up.\n\n36\n00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.080\nNow, when you install an application, it's\nnot only do you have the files that we\n\n37\n00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.890\nmentioned in the first part of this,\nin the programs file directories,\n\n38\n00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.500\nwhether it is x86 or 64 bit, but\nyou also have sometimes where your\n\n39\n00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.340\napplications will start at the moment your\ncomputer runs through its boot process.\n\n40\n00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.550\nNow, I don't mean in the earliest\nportions of the boot process.\n\n41\n00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.570\nWe're talking out after all the boots,\nstart driver, and service that started up.\n\n42\n00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.230\nThere is one does boot up at that time.\n\n43\n00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.160\nAnd we'll talk just a little\nbit that one coming up.\n\n44\n00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.910\nBut let show you what I mean here, we've\ngot back in my Windows time machine here\n\n45\n00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.640\nand I'm gonna just bring up task manager.\n\n46\n00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.420\nI love a little shortcut on this one\nbecause I'm left-handed, south paw,\n\n47\n00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.910\nwe do everything backwards.\n\n48\n00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.340\nAnd it's Ctrl + Shift + Esc\nbrings it up real quick.\n\n49\n00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.200\nKeep in mind that if you\nneed to get to Task Manager,\n\n50\n00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.970\nyou can also right-click\ndown here on the Task bar.\n\n51\n00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.250\nThat's where it's been for\na long time, and\n\n52\n00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.280\nwe can run Task Manager from right here,\ntoo.\n\n53\n00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.560\nSo, I won't keyboard\nshortcut you to death,\n\n54\n00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.500\nyou might need to know a couple different\nlocations to get to Task Manager.\n\n55\n00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.190\nNow, we're not really too worried\nabout processes right here right now,\n\n56\n00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.110\nbut what I do wanna look at a little\nbit is application history, all right.\n\n57\n00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.685\nAnd I also wanna look at the startup tab,\ncause both of these really have to do with\n\n58\n00:02:56.685 --> 00:02:59.911\nour applications, and the configuration,\nand maintaining them too.\n\n59\n00:02:59.911 --> 00:03:03.347\nSo, even though we talked\nabout just configuring apps,\n\n60\n00:03:03.347 --> 00:03:06.067\nI think this will benefit you on the exam,\nand\n\n61\n00:03:06.067 --> 00:03:10.526\nin the real world as well when it comes\nto maintaining your applications.\n\n62\n00:03:10.526 --> 00:03:16.930\nSo when we look at the app history\nsection, of Task Manager here.\n\n63\n00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.260\nYou're gonna notice something here.\n\n64\n00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.520\nAll right,\nyou'll notice a handful of applications.\n\n65\n00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.573\nNow, what's interesting about\nthis is these applications,\n\n66\n00:03:24.573 --> 00:03:27.220\nthey're not things like Notepad ++ or\nChrome.\n\n67\n00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.200\nAll right,\n\n68\n00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.130\nthese are modern UI applications that we\nmentioned in the end of part 1, okay?\n\n69\n00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.750\nAnd what this tab does is it\n\n70\n00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.790\nmonitors how their interacting with\nthe resources on your systems.\n\n71\n00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.360\nAnd what I mean by resources.\n\n72\n00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.110\nWe’ll talk about the four horsemen, right?\n\n73\n00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.380\nWe’ll talk about the CPU.\n\n74\n00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.700\nWe’ll talk about the hard drive.\n\n75\n00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.960\nWe’ll talk about the network.\n\n76\n00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.250\nAnd we’ll also talk about,\nwhat did I miss Ronnie?\n\n77\n00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.010\nCPU memory.\n\n78\n00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.927\nSlipped my mind.\n\n79\n00:03:53.927 --> 00:03:59.869\nYep, [LAUGH] so when we look at the Task\nManager, and this tab here, what we're\n\n80\n00:03:59.869 --> 00:04:06.060\nseeing is what is the amount of resources\non your machine that are being used?\n\n81\n00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.070\nAll right,\nyou can notice things like tile updates.\n\n82\n00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.340\nHow much information is that\ntaking to do a tile refresh?\n\n83\n00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.150\nWell, what do you mean by tile refresh it?\n\n84\n00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.880\nWell, you might see that this Start\nmenu has some live action tiles here,\n\n85\n00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.740\nthat are kinda rolling over.\n\n86\n00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.630\nAnd we can configure that if we want,\n\n87\n00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.930\nwe can actually turn off\nthe live tile if we want.\n\n88\n00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.690\nWhy might that be an issue?\n\n89\n00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.570\nWell, there's a couple\nreasons it might be an issue.\n\n90\n00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.666\nIf you're on a tablet, like we've\ntalked about some of the devices that\n\n91\n00:04:31.666 --> 00:04:34.053\nyou can install your Windows\n10 operating system in,\n\n92\n00:04:34.053 --> 00:04:36.800\nyou might want to save\nsome of your resources.\n\n93\n00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.910\nThe other thing is really\ndirectly related here to, for\n\n94\n00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.472\ninstance, this metered network option.\n\n95\n00:04:43.472 --> 00:04:44.870\nWhat is does that mean for us and\n\n96\n00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.970\nwhy would I even be concerned\nabout a metered network?\n\n97\n00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.240\nWell, I want you to keep in mind\njust because you can used wired and\n\n98\n00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.250\nwireless doesn't mean that you won't\nnecessarily be on some kind of data plan.\n\n99\n00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.470\nMaybe you have some kind of wireless\nbroadband, well I guess it's wireless\n\n100\n00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.490\nanyways, but a broadband card that allows\nyou to connect through your carrier right,\n\n101\n00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.080\nyour service provider and\nyou can be on the road, right?\n\n102\n00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.690\nWell, that metered network basically means\nis I'm flagging this network as being.\n\n103\n00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.100\nSomething that's gonna cost me money\nif too much data goes over it.\n\n104\n00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.910\nOr, metered in the fact that I've\ngot a certain amount of data,\n\n105\n00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.540\nlet's just start with the word metered,\nright?\n\n106\n00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.110\nSo you can keep track of that, right.\n\n107\n00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.360\nAnd the tile updates do take just\na moderate amount of information.\n\n108\n00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.190\nBut if you're like me, you're getting\ndown to some point where maybe\n\n109\n00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.880\nyou only have a couple hundred megs left.\n\n110\n00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.680\nWell, that might be something that sets\nyou over budget, so do keep that in mind.\n\n111\n00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.710\nAnd then you can see the other\noptions here, CPU, time, network.\n\n112\n00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.890\nI really wanted to just touch base on what\nthis tab is, what type of applications\n\n113\n00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:49.010\nyou're looking here and why that metered\nnetwork might or might not effect you.\n\n114\n00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.110\nAnd as well as configuring the live tiles\non the start menu that are directly\n\n115\n00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.500\nrelated to your applications.\n\n116\n00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.340\nNow, I did mention startup files.\n\n117\n00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.540\nAll right, let's go ahead and\ngo to the startup tab.\n\n118\n00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.490\nCertain applications, and you can see even\nthe ones that Microsoft has built in,\n\n119\n00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.720\nbaked into the Windows operating system,\n\n120\n00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.400\nsometimes will put their files\nin your startup process.\n\n121\n00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.740\nAnd, sometimes it doesn't matter.\n\n122\n00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.730\nLike for instance,\nthe Windows Defender notification,\n\n123\n00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.870\nremember one of the things I\ntold you is for the most part,\n\n124\n00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.980\nyour applications will start\nrunning after the boot process.\n\n125\n00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.120\nThis isn't one of those that does that.\n\n126\n00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.260\nThis actually works in combination within\na very early system driver that comes\n\n127\n00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.040\non during the boot process called ELAM.\n\n128\n00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.950\nAs we're not, we have our acronyms, right?\n\n129\n00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:36.190\nThat's the early launch\nAnti Malware driver, it's a driver,\n\n130\n00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.850\nsoftware if you will.\n\n131\n00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.570\nBut it launches during the boot process,\n\n132\n00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.410\nto make sure that that boot\nprocess isn't corrupted.\n\n133\n00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.710\nAnd it doesn't have things\nlike root kits in it, okay?\n\n134\n00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.060\nSo this one right here, I'm gonna tell\nyou, Windows and then in combination,\n\n135\n00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.790\nuntil Windows Defender software\nactually initiates, and\n\n136\n00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.460\nthen it can hand over the Security\nsubsystem to Windows defender.\n\n137\n00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.865\nThis is one I wouldn't\nrecommend disabling.\n\n138\n00:06:58.865 --> 00:07:02.200\nOkay, so I'm gonna show you disabling\na couple of the other ones.\n\n139\n00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.714\nAny malware software\nguys don't disable it.\n\n140\n00:07:04.714 --> 00:07:08.130\nAll right, even if you look at\nthe startup impact which means how\n\n141\n00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.810\nmany resources, how much can\nthis effect your boost process.\n\n142\n00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:17.170\nGuys, if it's your antivirus software,\nyour anti-malware protection,\n\n143\n00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.990\nit doesn't matter if it's\nat high level impact.\n\n144\n00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.150\nYou should keep that on, right,\nkeep your systems protected.\n\n145\n00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.590\nHowever, I'm not using\nOneDrive on this machine.\n\n146\n00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.100\nAnd you can see it's\na medium level impact.\n\n147\n00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.090\nAnd it's not that I don't like OneDrive.\n\n148\n00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.490\nI'm just not using it, right?\n\n149\n00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.290\nWell, by default, like Ronnie\nmentioned in the first episode,\n\n150\n00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.640\nwhen you attach your Microsoft\naccount to this machine,\n\n151\n00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.420\nyou also have access to your\nOneDrive through Windows.\n\n152\n00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.540\nIt's built into the subsystem.\n\n153\n00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:46.335\nWell, if I'm not logged into my Microsoft\naccount, I really don't need that\n\n154\n00:07:46.335 --> 00:07:50.134\napplication interfering in the boot\nprocess, or taking resources from other\n\n155\n00:07:50.134 --> 00:07:54.244\napplications, and system processes, that\nI might want to work more efficiently.\n\n156\n00:07:54.244 --> 00:07:58.746\nSo, that's all it really is, and\nwhat if I don't want it to start?\n\n157\n00:07:58.746 --> 00:07:59.889\nRight, well, that's okay.\n\n158\n00:07:59.889 --> 00:08:02.855\nYou can right-click on it,\nand you can choose Disable.\n\n159\n00:08:02.855 --> 00:08:06.740\nNow remember one of the things I told\nyou about your anti malware software.\n\n160\n00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.230\nHere's the other side of that tracks.\n\n161\n00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:10.000\nNotice one thing that I also get.\n\n162\n00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.487\nWhat if I see a file in here that has\nsome strange character name in it, and\n\n163\n00:08:14.487 --> 00:08:16.047\nyou can't really tell?\n\n164\n00:08:16.047 --> 00:08:17.960\nI don't know what the heck that is.\n\n165\n00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.360\nWell, you could also\nopen the file location,\n\n166\n00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.770\nfind out where it's running from.\n\n167\n00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:24.680\nAnd then turn around and\nsearch online, all right?\n\n168\n00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.270\nSo that's a good thing\nthat if you end up having.\n\n169\n00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:31.713\nIf you don't follow our recommendation\nfrom the first episode and make sure that\n\n170\n00:08:31.713 --> 00:08:36.023\nyou verify who the publisher is and\nit causes some problem, well, you can also\n\n171\n00:08:36.023 --> 00:08:41.420\nmaintain hopefully stop that application\nfrom being put in your startup process.\n\n172\n00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:46.460\nSo that's a little bit about how you can\nconfigure startup for these as well as\n\n173\n00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:51.530\nmonitoring, managing, and maintaining,\nif you will, your modern UI apps.\n\n174\n00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.520\nAnd this is a very good thing to have.\n\n175\n00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.870\nKeep in mind that at any time\nyou can also launch your app.\n\n176\n00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:56.810\nI'm not gonna launch these but\n\n177\n00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:59.670\nyou could launch your\napplications from here as well.\n\n178\n00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.730\nSo that's got more of\nthe application side of it.\n\n179\n00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.840\nNow, the other thing that I did mention,\n\n180\n00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.530\nI mentioned the fact that we\nhave certain Windows features.\n\n181\n00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:10.480\nAll right, what is a Windows feature?\n\n182\n00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.850\nWell a Windows feature is something\nthat you can have access to,\n\n183\n00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:17.950\nbut maybe a piece of software or\n\n184\n00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:22.290\na functionality that isn't\nturned on by default.\n\n185\n00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.315\nNow I say that, some are and some aren't.\n\n186\n00:09:24.315 --> 00:09:26.210\nAnd you're gonna see the list in a second.\n\n187\n00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:30.980\nBut it's an added functionality, it's\nan added application that maybe isn't so\n\n188\n00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.510\ncommon through all the research\nthat they've done.\n\n189\n00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.770\nBut they want you to have access\nto it if you need it, right?\n\n190\n00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:39.350\nAnd there's a couple of\nthings that are very handy\n\n191\n00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:40.920\nin this list that we're gonna show you.\n\n192\n00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:45.186\nSo that's what we're gonna look at now,\nis where do I go for those features and\n\n193\n00:09:45.186 --> 00:09:47.270\nwhat do I do with them once I find them?\n\n194\n00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.229\nWhat can I do with them?\n\n195\n00:09:48.229 --> 00:09:52.198\nSo, remember that we told you in the end\nof the last episode that if you were gonna\n\n196\n00:09:52.198 --> 00:09:55.932\nadd and remove some of these programs,\nyou could do it from the Programs and\n\n197\n00:09:55.932 --> 00:09:56.900\nFeatures, guys.\n\n198\n00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.740\nNow, I know I'm doing that kinda fast,\nso let me slow down a little bit here\n\n199\n00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.930\nIf I right click on the start menu I\nhave programs and features, right?\n\n200\n00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:07.140\nBut Ronnie like you've said in\nthe past and many episodes as well,\n\n201\n00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:10.490\nknow more than one way to get to something\nbecause the one way that you know how to\n\n202\n00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:13.650\nget to something probably isn't going\nto be the way they ask you on the exam.\n\n203\n00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:17.080\nSo we can also get to this\nthrough the control panel, so\n\n204\n00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.850\nif I go ahead I open the control panel.\n\n205\n00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:23.031\nNotice that we have programs and\nthe category view,\n\n206\n00:10:23.031 --> 00:10:26.948\nnothing like a door in front of\na door that leads to another door.\n\n207\n00:10:26.948 --> 00:10:29.666\nSo we'll go to programs and\nyou'll see what I mean here in a second,\n\n208\n00:10:29.666 --> 00:10:31.400\nthen we'll go to programs and features.\n\n209\n00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.120\nUnderstand guys,\n\n210\n00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:36.070\nthat these are the same location\njust a different way to get there.\n\n211\n00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:40.860\nBut notice that we have this\noption over here, all right?\n\n212\n00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:44.150\nAnd again, like we're leading up to\nshowing you the user account control.\n\n213\n00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:45.850\nNotice the little shield\nthat is right here.\n\n214\n00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:50.410\nThat little shield tells me, that hey,\nI can expect the user account control to\n\n215\n00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:54.250\ntrigger, if even if sometimes,\neven if I am an administrator, but\n\n216\n00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:56.680\ndefinitely if I am\na standard user all right?\n\n217\n00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:00.960\nSo, when I go to turn on a feature,\ndoesn't look like much right?\n\n218\n00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.510\nWe get this other little dialogue box,\nokay?\n\n219\n00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:06.620\nAnd notice that it says\nTurn Windows features on or off.\n\n220\n00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.670\nAnd we've got a series of\nsome that we can turn on.\n\n221\n00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:13.900\nNow we, Ronnie and I did a Hyper-V episode\nwhere we did talk about virtualization,\n\n222\n00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.150\nand one of the things that we\ntalked about in there is that,\n\n223\n00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:19.130\nyou can turn on the Hyper-V Functionality\nright from here.\n\n224\n00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:20.460\nI'm not gonna turn this one on but\n\n225\n00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:24.890\nwe could if we needed to enable Hyper-V,\nwe do it right here.\n\n226\n00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:28.140\nNow, currently we're running\non a newer framework,\n\n227\n00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:31.108\nthe application framework that\nthese applications are written in.\n\n228\n00:11:31.108 --> 00:11:35.209\nBut sometimes you need backwards\ncompatibility with applications that were\n\n229\n00:11:35.209 --> 00:11:38.752\nwritten in the days of Windows 7,\nVista, maybe even Windows 8.\n\n230\n00:11:38.752 --> 00:11:40.552\nJust prior to Windows 10.\n\n231\n00:11:40.552 --> 00:11:44.399\nAnd I need to install the .NET Framework\nbecause it's got to be there to support\n\n232\n00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:46.800\nthe application that I'm trying to run.\n\n233\n00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.010\nWell all I have to do is\nI can expand this out.\n\n234\n00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:52.810\nI can see that this is also a hierarchical\ntree here and I could say, you know what?\n\n235\n00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.310\nI wanna turn on the .NET Framework, right?\n\n236\n00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:56.290\nAnd I can do that.\n\n237\n00:11:56.290 --> 00:12:00.960\nMaybe I decide that I for whatever reason,\nmaybe I want Telnet, right?\n\n238\n00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.870\nTelnet, it's an insecure protocol,\nwe really shouldn't be using it for\n\n239\n00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:05.840\ncertain things.\n\n240\n00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.040\nBut, one of the cool things about Telnet\nis it could be used to test things like\n\n241\n00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.050\nport connection.\n\n242\n00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:14.239\nSo I turn that, I actually turn the client\non because I'm not worried about somebody\n\n243\n00:12:14.239 --> 00:12:15.191\nconnecting to me.\n\n244\n00:12:15.191 --> 00:12:21.208\nAll right, so as a recap,\nkeep in mind all I did was put a checkmark\n\n245\n00:12:21.208 --> 00:12:26.253\nright here in .NET Framework 3.5 and\nwe choose OK.\n\n246\n00:12:26.253 --> 00:12:30.718\nNow notice what it's doing It's asking me,\nit says, sometimes these files are baked\n\n247\n00:12:30.718 --> 00:12:33.790\ninto the operating system and\nthey're ready to go for you.\n\n248\n00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:35.140\nBut notice what this one says,\n\n249\n00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:40.070\nit says, Windows needs files from\nWindows Update to finish installing these.\n\n250\n00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.340\nSo, it's asking us, do we want to do that?\n\n251\n00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:46.620\nSo we'll go ahead, we'll allow that\nto connect real quick, all right, and\n\n252\n00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.210\nnotice how it's downloading the files.\n\n253\n00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:53.400\nNow, it depends on what type\nof feature you're installing.\n\n254\n00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:58.020\nI chose this one for a reason, and\nwe're gonna put me on the spot here Ronny,\n\n255\n00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:01.460\nthat this one shouldn't require a restart\nwhen you put the .NET framework on there.\n\n256\n00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:05.120\nHyper-V will and that's one of\nthe reasons I'm not doing it here on\n\n257\n00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:09.100\nthe show cuz again, I don't want\nyou guys to have to wait for that.\n\n258\n00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.720\nBut notice that it says\ndownloading required files.\n\n259\n00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.720\nAnd if we give it a second,\neventually what it's gonna do is it'll\n\n260\n00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:19.180\nhave those files locally, it'll, you could\nsee, apply the changes and then it'll say\n\n261\n00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:23.220\nthe requested changes have been applied\nand sometimes it needs a restart.\n\n262\n00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:27.310\nIf I remember right, cuz I've had to\ninstall the earlier .net framework,\n\n263\n00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:30.760\nI'm pretty sure this is just\na subsystem that's built-in once it's\n\n264\n00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.310\nturned on if you will and\nthe files are downloaded.\n\n265\n00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:37.439\nAnd I don't really think that we're\ngonna have to do any restart here.\n\n266\n00:13:37.439 --> 00:13:41.718\nSo that's one of the ways that\nyou can do the Windows features,\n\n267\n00:13:41.718 --> 00:13:46.060\nadding them and removing them,\nas simple as finding them.\n\n268\n00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:49.092\nKnowing which ones you want or\nwhich ones you want to remove and\n\n269\n00:13:49.092 --> 00:13:52.724\nall you gotta do is add a check mark or\nyou can just take the check mark away.\n\n270\n00:13:52.724 --> 00:13:56.940\nSo pretty straightforward process just\nas long as you know where to look.\n\n271\n00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.710\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, there's no doubt that\na lot of these features we don't\n\n272\n00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:03.010\nnecessarily need on a regular\ndesktop computer every day.\n\n273\n00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:05.110\nIt doesn't hurt you to\nactually know where they are,\n\n274\n00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:08.860\nso if you want to run every\nsingle one of them you can, but\n\n275\n00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.338\nremember it's going to take up\nresources on your computer.\n\n276\n00:14:11.338 --> 00:14:15.420\nSo normally It's recommend that you only\ninstall the features that you really\n\n277\n00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:19.310\nneed on that device, especially if\nit's something like a tablet or\n\n278\n00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:20.780\na laptop as well.\n\n279\n00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:23.980\nYou really want to make sure that\nyou understand that as well cuz\n\n280\n00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:26.760\neven though it's neat to say I'm\ngoing to turn on everything.\n\n281\n00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.550\nIt's probably not a best practice for us.\n\n282\n00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:31.130\nSo normally you don't.\n\n283\n00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:32.930\nAnd that's what you\nhave the ability to do.\n\n284\n00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:35.810\nBut it is neat that you\nhave the ability to\n\n285\n00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:38.140\nhave additional features when you need to.\n\n286\n00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:42.520\nBut also then a best practices, if you're\ndone with it, such as Telnet, right?\n\n287\n00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.420\nAnd you're going, hey, I'm done.\n\n288\n00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.800\nAlways uncheck that thing.\n\n289\n00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.470\nBecause you're just leaving\nsomething open if you don't.\n\n290\n00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:51.830\nAnd then when you need it again, check\nit back, and you're ready to go again.\n\n291\n00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.830\nSo just kinda realize that as\ngreat as these features are,\n\n292\n00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:58.080\ndon't do all of them is\npretty much the key.\n\n293\n00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:01.137\nAll right, Wes, so what else do we\nactually need to take a look at here?\n\n294\n00:15:01.137 --> 00:15:04.381\n&gt;&gt; And I could have used that\nadvice about six years ago.\n\n295\n00:15:04.381 --> 00:15:06.478\n[LAUGH] I wish I would have known.\n\n296\n00:15:06.478 --> 00:15:09.783\nAnd that's right,\nsmaller foot print means smaller attack\n\n297\n00:15:09.783 --> 00:15:12.834\nsurface when it comes to\nthings that you security wise.\n\n298\n00:15:12.834 --> 00:15:15.129\nAnd speaking of security wise that's\nwhere we're going next Ronny.\n\n299\n00:15:15.129 --> 00:15:20.323\nWe are leading up to the finale which\nis the user account control but\n\n300\n00:15:20.323 --> 00:15:26.447\nwe also got one more piece of security\nrelated I guess application or component\n\n301\n00:15:26.447 --> 00:15:32.513\nwithin your operating system that can\nhelp you protect these applications.\n\n302\n00:15:32.513 --> 00:15:36.570\nAnd remember we talked about knowing and\nverifying publishers?\n\n303\n00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:40.460\nWell, there is a component inside\nof your Windows operating system\n\n304\n00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:43.130\nthat allows you to do just that,\nall right?\n\n305\n00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:46.971\nAnd let's go ahead and we'll go to\na location in the control panel and,\n\n306\n00:15:46.971 --> 00:15:51.902\nremember, all I'm doing here, guys, is I'm\njust right-clicking on the Windows icon,\n\n307\n00:15:51.902 --> 00:15:53.328\nchoosing Control Panel.\n\n308\n00:15:53.328 --> 00:15:58.278\nAnd we're gonna actually look down\ninto our Control Panel &gt; System and\n\n309\n00:15:58.278 --> 00:16:01.590\nSecurity &gt; Security and Maintenance, okay?\n\n310\n00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:03.642\nNow, when we talk about the security here,\n\n311\n00:16:03.642 --> 00:16:05.920\nthere's a lot of things that are in here,\nguys.\n\n312\n00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.410\nYou can see things like\nyour network firewall.\n\n313\n00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:12.930\nYou can see virus protection,\ninternet security settings.\n\n314\n00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:14.950\nNotice that\nthe User Account Control is here.\n\n315\n00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:17.320\nWe'll get to that in a second here,\nbut the one that I'm looking for\n\n316\n00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:20.350\nis right below that, right?\n\n317\n00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:23.100\nEven though the User Account Control's\na very good security setting,\n\n318\n00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.560\nwe also have another one called\nthe Windows SmartScreen.\n\n319\n00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.860\nAnd you can see guys here,\nnotice what it says.\n\n320\n00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:29.650\nAll right.\n\n321\n00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:32.410\nSo Windows SmartScreen\nis helping to protect\n\n322\n00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:37.345\nyour PC from unrecognized applications and\nfiles downloaded from the Internet.\n\n323\n00:16:37.345 --> 00:16:40.555\nSo, this actually kinda works hand in\nhand with the User Account Control.\n\n324\n00:16:40.555 --> 00:16:43.345\nYou see Windows, one of the things I like\nabout their security is it's not any\n\n325\n00:16:43.345 --> 00:16:46.045\none thing that's built into Windows\nit's helping to make it secure.\n\n326\n00:16:46.045 --> 00:16:50.655\nIt's a dynamic security that's\nmore of a intimate relationship,\n\n327\n00:16:50.655 --> 00:16:53.573\n[LAUGH] if you will,\nbetween multiple components.\n\n328\n00:16:53.573 --> 00:16:58.860\nAnd the SmartScreens filter and\nthe User Account Control are two\n\n329\n00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:02.750\nof those components that are kinda like\nthe dynamic security working together.\n\n330\n00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:05.630\nLet's go ahead, and\nlet's open up the settings here, and\n\n331\n00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:07.350\ntalk a little bit more about this.\n\n332\n00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:11.290\nNotice that it says, what do you wanna\ndo with unrecognized applications?\n\n333\n00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:13.230\nAnd I just leave this.\n\n334\n00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:14.680\nI don't change this, right?\n\n335\n00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:18.500\nMaybe if you're in an isolated lab\nenvironment, you're doing testing, and\n\n336\n00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:23.880\nyou're developing an application, so\nyou don't have any digital signature.\n\n337\n00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.508\nYou haven't worked with Microsoft yet.\n\n338\n00:17:25.508 --> 00:17:27.730\nYou might wanna disable this for\nthat purpose, but\n\n339\n00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:30.230\nthat's the only purpose I can tell you for\ndisabling this.\n\n340\n00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:33.040\nBecause, what does this actually do?\n\n341\n00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.190\nNow it does say, unrecognized apps,\nfiles downloaded from the Internet.\n\n342\n00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:37.680\nHow does it even known?\n\n343\n00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.670\nWell, one of the great\nthings that Microsoft has.\n\n344\n00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:41.830\nAnd it's kinda under the hood.\n\n345\n00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:43.210\nWe don't realize it.\n\n346\n00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:47.480\nIt's only until we don't have access\nto it that we start to realize how\n\n347\n00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.670\nbeneficial it is.\n\n348\n00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:52.530\nIs, Microsoft maintained something\nknown as a reputation database.\n\n349\n00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:56.660\nThis reputation database\ncontains reputations for\n\n350\n00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:00.730\nsites that are known, trusted, and good,\nas well as those sites that are known to\n\n351\n00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:05.870\npropagate things like phishing scams,\nmalware distribution.\n\n352\n00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:08.650\nAnd what it does is when\nyou go to a website, and\n\n353\n00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:13.520\nyou start to download a file,\nit instantly SmartScreen filter.\n\n354\n00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.270\nReaches out to Microsoft database and\nsays,\n\n355\n00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:20.960\nwhat do we know about this application,\nwhat do we know about this website?\n\n356\n00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.500\nAll right.\nCouple of things might happen.\n\n357\n00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.100\nFirst of all, we know what's gonna\nhappen cuz it tells us right here.\n\n358\n00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.330\nIt's gonna warn us that this\nan unrecognized application.\n\n359\n00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:30.930\nWhat does it mean by unrecognized?\n\n360\n00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:34.060\nIt means when it goes to look for\nthat signature information that we talked\n\n361\n00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:35.435\nabout in the first part,\nthere's nothing there.\n\n362\n00:18:35.435 --> 00:18:36.635\nAll right?\n\n363\n00:18:36.635 --> 00:18:37.525\nIt doesn't find it.\n\n364\n00:18:37.525 --> 00:18:39.945\nOr it finds a signature that it's like,\n\n365\n00:18:39.945 --> 00:18:43.045\njust because you told me it's\nBob's application, who's Bob?\n\n366\n00:18:43.045 --> 00:18:44.995\nI don't know who Bob's application is.\n\n367\n00:18:44.995 --> 00:18:49.945\nSo it's giving you the opportunity to say,\ndo you wanna trust it?\n\n368\n00:18:49.945 --> 00:18:51.395\nWell, if I know Bob, right?\n\n369\n00:18:51.395 --> 00:18:55.695\nAnd he's just a little bit behind the\neight ball when it comes to getting his\n\n370\n00:18:55.695 --> 00:18:59.240\ncertificate on his application,\nthen maybe I'll go ahead and install it.\n\n371\n00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:02.598\nBut if I don't know who that is, it gives\nme the chance to shut it down, all right?\n\n372\n00:19:02.598 --> 00:19:06.856\nAnd that's very important because\nthe fact that these phishing scams,\n\n373\n00:19:06.856 --> 00:19:10.416\nthese applications that get\ndownloaded to your computer and\n\n374\n00:19:10.416 --> 00:19:15.093\nstart to hijack your information,\nhijack the functionality of your operating\n\n375\n00:19:15.093 --> 00:19:18.990\nsystem are used to actually\nattack other computers.\n\n376\n00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:22.000\nIf you didn't have technologies\nlike this you wouldn't even be\n\n377\n00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.240\naware that they exist.\n\n378\n00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:27.330\nSo that's a little bit about\nthe Windows SmartScreen Filter.\n\n379\n00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:29.270\nI showed you one way that\nyou could configure it.\n\n380\n00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:31.975\nThere's a couple other ways that\nI want you to be familiar with.\n\n381\n00:19:31.975 --> 00:19:33.295\nThis is the Control Panel way.\n\n382\n00:19:33.295 --> 00:19:36.815\nAnd this is globally across\ntwo different applications.\n\n383\n00:19:36.815 --> 00:19:40.825\nOne is Internet Explorer, and\nas well the newer Edge browser.\n\n384\n00:19:40.825 --> 00:19:44.585\nSo when you do this from Control Panel,\nyou're essentially affecting both.\n\n385\n00:19:44.585 --> 00:19:47.025\nHowever, you might wanna configure\nthem on an individual basis.\n\n386\n00:19:47.025 --> 00:19:48.465\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n387\n00:19:48.465 --> 00:19:50.805\nIf I go ahead, and\nI'm just gonna get out of Control Panel.\n\n388\n00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:53.580\nI say that.\nWill try that again.\n\n389\n00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:56.660\nGet out of control panel and\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n390\n00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:01.140\nI will launch up our Internet Explorer.\n\n391\n00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.400\nAll right?\nNow I went ahead and\n\n392\n00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.415\nlaunched it in private browser cuz I\ndon't need it connecting to MS- MSN, or\n\n393\n00:20:05.415 --> 00:20:06.415\nanything like that.\n\n394\n00:20:06.415 --> 00:20:10.095\nSo don't worry whether you're in in\nprivate browsing, or anything like that.\n\n395\n00:20:10.095 --> 00:20:11.865\nIt still works in both sides.\n\n396\n00:20:11.865 --> 00:20:15.335\nBut if I go up to this\nlittle gear icon at the top,\n\n397\n00:20:15.335 --> 00:20:18.775\nyou're gonna notice that we have\na series of options here, right?\n\n398\n00:20:18.775 --> 00:20:21.965\nAnd one of the options I have is safety.\n\n399\n00:20:21.965 --> 00:20:25.290\nAll right.\nIf I look at safety, and then,\n\n400\n00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:28.360\noop, let me see if I can scroll it and\nnot make that disappear.\n\n401\n00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.290\nNotice I have a few options\nhere that even more.\n\n402\n00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:36.160\nThis is where your\nWindows SmartScreen Filter starts to\n\n403\n00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.740\ngive you more of a proactive\nthan a reactive solution, right?\n\n404\n00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.800\nProactive is you connect to the website,\nit doesn't recognize it.\n\n405\n00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.060\nIt checks that database and\nwell I'm sorry that's all you get.\n\n406\n00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.120\nAll right.\n\n407\n00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:51.270\nHow about being able to check\nthe database before you go to a website?\n\n408\n00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:54.644\nOr the moment you connect to it,\nlet's say that SmartScreen Filter,\n\n409\n00:20:54.644 --> 00:20:57.870\nthis is a brand new website and\nit isn't aware of it, right?\n\n410\n00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:58.890\nIt's not aware of it.\n\n411\n00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:00.400\nIt has no match for this.\n\n412\n00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.048\nWell you can check the website, right?\n\n413\n00:21:03.048 --> 00:21:05.150\nYou can don't do this.\n\n414\n00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:08.320\nYou can turn [LAUGH] off\nthe SmartScreen Filter from here.\n\n415\n00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.850\nOr if we check the website,\nit reaches out to that database and\n\n416\n00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:14.380\nsays hey, I don't know what this is.\n\n417\n00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:16.400\nI have no clue and that now loops on.\n\n418\n00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.020\nYou started to see that maybe\nyour computer's not acting right.\n\n419\n00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.690\nMaybe you got some unauthorized files\nthat are now on your desktop or\n\n420\n00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:24.000\nyour downloads folder.\n\n421\n00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.620\nYou can report it as unsafe.\n\n422\n00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:30.050\nThen you start to help become a part\nof the solution to the problem that is\n\n423\n00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:31.890\nfishing and this malware distribution.\n\n424\n00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:34.320\nSo you have that ability\nwhich is really cool.\n\n425\n00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.320\nSo that's Internet Explorer.\n\n426\n00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:37.080\nRight?\nUnderstand that\n\n427\n00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.090\nthe functionality is still the same, guys.\n\n428\n00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:40.760\nWhether you do this\nthrough the control panel.\n\n429\n00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:45.420\nIf you do it with the control panel it's\nglobally across both of the browsers.\n\n430\n00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:51.525\nHowever, if you do this individually\nit's on a browser by browser basis.\n\n431\n00:21:51.525 --> 00:21:52.225\nAll right?\n\n432\n00:21:52.225 --> 00:21:53.505\nNow, this is the Edge browser.\n\n433\n00:21:53.505 --> 00:21:56.885\nLet me go ahead and\nthere's our website perfectly.\n\n434\n00:21:56.885 --> 00:21:58.090\nHopefully that one doesn't come back.\n\n435\n00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:03.075\n[LAUGH] And show you where you guys\ncan go in order to look this up.\n\n436\n00:22:03.075 --> 00:22:05.685\nNow, to do this we're gonna go ahead and\n\n437\n00:22:05.685 --> 00:22:09.175\nwe're gonna go to the ellipsis here,\nall right.\n\n438\n00:22:09.175 --> 00:22:11.255\nAnd we're gonna scroll down to Setting.\n\n439\n00:22:11.255 --> 00:22:12.615\nAnd my head's kinda covering up.\n\n440\n00:22:12.615 --> 00:22:13.630\nThank you there.\n\n441\n00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:14.270\nWe'll choose setting.\n\n442\n00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:16.900\nAnd then we're gonna scroll all\nthe way to the bottom here, and\n\n443\n00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.046\nit's kinda interesting.\n\n444\n00:22:18.046 --> 00:22:20.809\nAdvanced settings, all right?\n\n445\n00:22:20.809 --> 00:22:24.489\nAnd then if I scroll all the way\nto the bottom again, all right?\n\n446\n00:22:24.489 --> 00:22:30.267\nNotice it says right here it tells me\nhelp me protect from malicious sites and\n\n447\n00:22:30.267 --> 00:22:31.270\ndownloads.\n\n448\n00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:32.980\nSo this doesn't just affect software.\n\n449\n00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:37.940\nIt also, the reputation's not just\nbased on the files themselves and\n\n450\n00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:42.310\nthe downloads, it's also based on\nthe website itself too, right?\n\n451\n00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:48.090\nSo SmartScreen Filter really easy way\nto kinda help keep yourself protected.\n\n452\n00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:50.870\nKeep in mind those different\nlocations just in case they ask.\n\n453\n00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:53.390\nAnd if they ask you on the exam,\nis this available inside of the,\n\n454\n00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:55.730\nknow more Modern Edge browser.\n\n455\n00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:57.680\nYou can say yes, it is.\n\n456\n00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.370\nNow, here's the finale.\n\n457\n00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:00.740\nWe've been talking about security.\n\n458\n00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:04.120\nWe've been talking about the User Account\nControl since the beginning of part\n\n459\n00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:04.620\none here.\n\n460\n00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:07.980\nAnd I really haven't shown you\nanything about the settings and\n\n461\n00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:08.870\nwhat you can do there.\n\n462\n00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:11.992\nSo let's go ahead without further ado,\nand we'll check those out.\n\n463\n00:23:11.992 --> 00:23:14.350\nWe're gonna go back to that security and\nmaintenance section.\n\n464\n00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:15.980\nThere's actually a couple\ndifferent locations, but\n\n465\n00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:18.820\nI want you to be aware of it for\nthe exam just in case they ask you that\n\n466\n00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:22.960\none question that wasn't the way\nthat you actually practiced it.\n\n467\n00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.270\nSo if I go ahead, and\nI right click on my windows icon,\n\n468\n00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:29.140\nI'm gonna go back to Control Panel,\nback to System and\n\n469\n00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:34.030\nSecurity, Security and Maintenance,\nwe're going the scenic route here.\n\n470\n00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:36.390\nExpand out security.\n\n471\n00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:39.510\nAnd then notice that you have\nthe User Account Control settings right\n\n472\n00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:40.160\nunder Security.\n\n473\n00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.260\nI want you to be aware of that.\n\n474\n00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:45.230\nAnd if I choose Change Settings,\nlook at the dialog box that comes up.\n\n475\n00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:48.410\nAnd you can see here up at the top,\nUser Account Control settings.\n\n476\n00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:50.510\nNo I'm gonna go and cancel out of that.\n\n477\n00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:51.740\nLet me show you why.\n\n478\n00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:56.506\nBecause if I go back to the Control Panel,\nHome Page if you will,\n\n479\n00:23:56.506 --> 00:24:00.585\nand I go to User Accounts and\nthen User Accounts again.\n\n480\n00:24:00.585 --> 00:24:02.858\nNotice that I also have this option here.\n\n481\n00:24:02.858 --> 00:24:06.080\nChange the User Account Control settings.\n\n482\n00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:09.293\nAnd if I click that,\nalways more than one way usually\n\n483\n00:24:09.293 --> 00:24:13.615\nin Windows to get something done and\nget somewhere so be aware of that.\n\n484\n00:24:13.615 --> 00:24:18.400\nNow, when Vista came out,\nthe setting was really strict.\n\n485\n00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.110\nI'm almost convinced that if you sneezed,\n\n486\n00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:24.530\nthe user account control would\nsay did you mean to do that?\n\n487\n00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:27.300\nPress yes to continue, no to cancel.\n\n488\n00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:31.060\nSo the setting was always notify me,\nand it's very very strict.\n\n489\n00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:34.790\nAnd people got a little bit upset\nabout that, said it was too intrusive.\n\n490\n00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:37.720\nSo what they did It's no so much that they\n\n491\n00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:41.220\nkind of redesigned the user account\ncontrol, but not from the ground up.\n\n492\n00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:44.560\nWhat they did is they said,\ncertain binaries that run in Windows,\n\n493\n00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.830\nshouldn't really be\ntriggered inside of the UAC.\n\n494\n00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:51.370\nSo, the new default option is,\nNotify me only when\n\n495\n00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:55.540\napps try to make changes to my\ncomputer and that's the default.\n\n496\n00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:59.940\nAgain, when Vista came out, it said any\ntime a system configuration was happening,\n\n497\n00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:03.420\neven if it was a system binary,\nit could have triggered it.\n\n498\n00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.830\nThey're not that intrusive anymore.\n\n499\n00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:09.790\nAll right, now I wanna make mention\nbecause some people disable this, right?\n\n500\n00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:12.170\nThey say I don't don't need this,\nthey disable it, and\n\n501\n00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:14.730\nnow they don't understand why they\ngot a virus on their machine or\n\n502\n00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:17.850\nthey got a runaway application that's\nnow taking control of their computer.\n\n503\n00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:21.320\nYou should not use these last two,\nshouldn't,\n\n504\n00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.100\nexcuse me, use these last two options.\n\n505\n00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:26.580\nYou can if you want,\nthat's why we call it PC,\n\n506\n00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:30.330\nit's a personal computer, but it's also\na personal choice that you're making\n\n507\n00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:33.200\nto basically hinder the security\nsubsystem in Windows.\n\n508\n00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:37.383\nNotice this option here that says,\ndo not dim my desktop.\n\n509\n00:25:37.383 --> 00:25:39.005\nThat's something called secure desktop.\n\n510\n00:25:39.005 --> 00:25:42.660\nIt is a built in feature, for\nthe user account control, and\n\n511\n00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:44.670\nlet me tell you what that means here.\n\n512\n00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:48.220\nIn fact, I wonder if I can\ntrigger it here real quick?\n\n513\n00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:48.780\nLet me see.\n\n514\n00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:53.990\nRegistry editor, sometimes when you are\nelevated in your privileges, there we go.\n\n515\n00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:59.020\nAll right, now notice this\ndark region that we have here.\n\n516\n00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:03.270\nNow I can move this app, right,\nI can move the user account control.\n\n517\n00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:06.790\nBut what I can't do is launch\nany other application.\n\n518\n00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:08.420\nWhy is that important?\n\n519\n00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:12.190\nI want you to know that this is\nan instant almost safe mode, right?\n\n520\n00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:14.900\nIt instantly locks the registry and says,\n\n521\n00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:20.780\nuntil you interact with this dialogue box,\nnothing is gonna happen in the registry.\n\n522\n00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:24.160\nNow, if I turn this off, okay?\n\n523\n00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.720\nAnd I don't dim the desktop.\n\n524\n00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:31.260\nWhat is to say that somebody couldn't\ncreate an application that launches\n\n525\n00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:35.150\njust like the command prompt does and\nlooks like a user account control.\n\n526\n00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:37.980\nAnd, even worse than that,\nwhen you are a standard user,\n\n527\n00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:40.450\nyou get an administrative dialogue box.\n\n528\n00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:42.540\nWhat if you knew\nan administrative password, and\n\n529\n00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:45.500\nthe dialogue box that pops up\nshows you the authentication.\n\n530\n00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:49.170\nAnd when you enter the administrative\nusername and password, it's a key logger\n\n531\n00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:53.660\nthat sends your information outbound,\nsomebody who's waiting on a server.\n\n532\n00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:58.160\nDo not dim the desktop, you basically\ncripple the user account control just for\n\n533\n00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.850\na very minor inconvenience.\n\n534\n00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:06.280\nLast one, last but not least is,\njust turn it off right?\n\n535\n00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.050\nWe do not want to do that.\n\n536\n00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:09.190\nNot at all.\n\n537\n00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:11.760\nNow I know that we're running\na little bit short on time.\n\n538\n00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:15.842\nI do want to mention one more thing\nwhen it comes to user account control.\n\n539\n00:27:15.842 --> 00:27:19.728\nI really don't know if they're gonna\nask you this at an enterprise level\n\n540\n00:27:19.728 --> 00:27:23.296\non an [LAUGH] MTA exam, but\nI'm gonna show you where you can also make\n\n541\n00:27:23.296 --> 00:27:27.650\nadditional modifications to the user\naccount control on a more granular basis.\n\n542\n00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:30.870\nIt's not important that you know\neach one of the settings and\n\n543\n00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:33.580\nunderstand what each one of\nthe settings are doing, but\n\n544\n00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:36.760\nI do want you to know that\nit is inside of Windows 10.\n\n545\n00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:42.629\nAnd if I was to launch our\nlocal policy editor and\n\n546\n00:27:42.629 --> 00:27:48.620\nI do a gpedit.msc, that's our\nMicrosoft management console and\n\n547\n00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:51.200\nI get into the local group policy editor.\n\n548\n00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.780\nAll right, this is another location that\nyou can make modifications to the user\n\n549\n00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:55.760\naccount control.\n\n550\n00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.770\nAnd this is under Windows Settings,\n\n551\n00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.130\nit's under Security Settings\n&gt; Account Policies and\n\n552\n00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:08.560\nI think it is Local Policies,\nthere we go, Security Options.\n\n553\n00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:13.440\nNow, you can get to them easier by\nhitting your name column header and\n\n554\n00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.865\njust reversing the,\n&gt;&gt; Sort.\n\n555\n00:28:15.865 --> 00:28:16.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the sort.\n\n556\n00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.080\nThank you there, Ronnie, appreciate it.\n\n557\n00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:21.930\nAnd you have nine to ten user account\ncontrol settings that you can get very\n\n558\n00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:22.490\ngranular.\n\n559\n00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:26.130\nHowever be careful because\nyou can secure yourself so\n\n560\n00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:28.010\nmuch that you can't even\nget into your own computer.\n\n561\n00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:30.900\nBut if you don't know what\nthe settings are, that's okay.\n\n562\n00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.480\nRemember, Enable, Disable, and\n\n563\n00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:36.580\nthey also have an Explain tab here that\ncan tell you what this feature would do.\n\n564\n00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:41.230\nIf you don't do anything,\nif you enable it, if you disable it, so\n\n565\n00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:44.810\njust know, in your local policy editor,\nyou can go a lot\n\n566\n00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:49.390\nfarther in what you can do controlling and\nconfiguring the user account control.\n\n567\n00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:51.588\nI would think it's a little\nbit outside of this exam.\n\n568\n00:28:51.588 --> 00:28:54.990\nIt's probably gonna be more\nimportant to you to know those\n\n569\n00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:58.830\nbasic configurations that we showed,\nthat you can get inside the control panel.\n\n570\n00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:03.190\nBut when it comes down to it, Ronnie, the\nuser account control is a great feature.\n\n571\n00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:07.240\nI do not recommend turning it off, and\nI really don't even recommend modifying\n\n572\n00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.780\nthe default settings,\ncuz it's there to help you.\n\n573\n00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:13.940\nIt's there to help ensure that\nyour machine stays protected.\n\n574\n00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:17.890\n&gt;&gt; Wes, there's no doubt that the idea\nhere of the user account control is\n\n575\n00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:20.110\nactually a great security feature.\n\n576\n00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:24.190\nSomething that an end-user, even if they\ndon't know anything about computers, well,\n\n577\n00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:26.960\nthey can know that they're protected,\njust by this.\n\n578\n00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:30.410\nThe other feature about the way that the\nuser account control works, especially,\n\n579\n00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:33.250\nwith that dimming feature is,\nyou might be wondering, well,\n\n580\n00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:35.300\nwhy do I care if nothing's\nrunning in the background?\n\n581\n00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:39.880\nWell, what can happen with a lot of the\ndifferent ways that a malware gets onto\n\n582\n00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:43.790\nyour computer is while you're waiting or\nyou're actually doing something else,\n\n583\n00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:45.990\nsomething can be running\nin the background.\n\n584\n00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:50.380\nWith the UAC, that user account control,\nand the way that it dims the screen,\n\n585\n00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:54.580\nit will not even allow something\nrunning maliciously in the background.\n\n586\n00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:56.760\nAnd that's why it's such\nan important feature.\n\n587\n00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:00.010\nAlso what if you just leave it there for\nten minutes or however long it takes.\n\n588\n00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:03.190\nI think it's only like three or\nfour minutes, maybe five total, but\n\n589\n00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:06.590\neven if you do so\nit automatically defaults to a no.\n\n590\n00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:08.670\nSo that way you're not\nactually going to say,\n\n591\n00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:11.110\nall right, we'll just wait\nuntil it actually finishes.\n\n592\n00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:16.180\nAnd then an application can launch,\nbecause it will now be up and ready to go.\n\n593\n00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:21.140\nSo it is a really neat feature and\nsomething you don't want to disable that\n\n594\n00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:25.960\nsecurity feature, because it really\ndoes help keep your computer, well,\n\n595\n00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:30.210\npretty much secure from a lot of different\nthings that you are not intending.\n\n596\n00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:34.430\nSo, in other words, if you're ignorant\nabout it, it's the best thing to keep on.\n\n597\n00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:35.920\nIf you're not sure whether or\n\n598\n00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:39.090\nnot you should do it, leave it\nalone is pretty much the key here.\n\n599\n00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:42.290\nOkay, now Wes,\nyou have actually taken us through some\n\n600\n00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:45.090\nof the different settings that are\nactually there and available in the UAC.\n\n601\n00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:48.730\nYou've shown us also of course\nthe idea of the SmartScreen.\n\n602\n00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:50.710\nAnd this is a very\nimportant element as well.\n\n603\n00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:53.745\nAnd we start to see something,\nif you haven't seen it before.\n\n604\n00:30:53.745 --> 00:30:57.780\nAnd Windows itself is trying to\nprovide as much security as possible,\n\n605\n00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:00.110\neven at the desktop level and\nthat's a great thing.\n\n606\n00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:01.440\nLes, any last words?\n\n607\n00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.810\n&gt;&gt; No, I think that's it.\n\n608\n00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:05.170\nI couldn't, I can't add anything to that.\n\n609\n00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:06.330\nI think Ronnie's right on.\n\n610\n00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:08.610\nDon't disable your security features.\n\n611\n00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:11.820\nThey're there for a reason and\nall you gotta do is have\n\n612\n00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:15.670\nto reinstall a couple of operating\nsystems, try to restore user data to\n\n613\n00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:20.290\nrealize why a simple click of the UAC\nshould be left there in place.\n\n614\n00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:21.150\nBut nope, I think that's it.\n\n615\n00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:25.610\nWell Wes, well that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n616\n00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:27.330\nSigning off for ITProTV.\n\n617\n00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:29.020\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n618\n00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:29.930\n&gt;&gt; And I'm

Wes,\nwelcome to our studios.\n\n12\n00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:38.790\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back,\n\n13\n00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.983\nit almost sounds like a challenge-\n&gt;&gt; It is [LAUGH].\n\n14\n00:00:39.983 --> 00:00:42.899\n&gt;&gt; But I'm up for the task,\nthat's right, and Ronnie's right,\n\n15\n00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.013\nwe're gonna be looking\nat say our firewalls.\n\n16\n00:00:45.013 --> 00:00:48.380\nWe're gonna be looking at a few\ndifferent things including services.\n\n17\n00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.867\nAnd these are really,\nreally important technologies to have.\n\n18\n00:00:51.867 --> 00:00:55.542\nWe'll start out with security\ntechnologies like antivirus, and\n\n19\n00:00:55.542 --> 00:00:58.530\nlet's start talking\na little bit about that.\n\n20\n00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.496\nWell when it comes to antivirus, what is\nthe purpose of our malware protection?\n\n21\n00:01:02.496 --> 00:01:06.310\nAnd viruses, really that\n\n22\n00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.720\nterm alone now is more of a small\npiece of the puzzle, right?\n\n23\n00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.540\nNow sometimes we just say\nantivirus software is taking care\n\n24\n00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.630\nof the bad files that we\ndon't want on our machine.\n\n25\n00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.310\nBut really when it comes down to it\nit's more about what the term malware.\n\n26\n00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.360\nAnd we just want you to understand that\nreally viruses today are just a small\n\n27\n00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.610\npiece of the puzzle, and\nthe larger umbrella term would be malware.\n\n28\n00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.289\nSo even though we call things like,\nwe're gonna see Windows Defender and\n\n29\n00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:39.805\nthe Microsoft Malicious Software Removal\ntoolkit as antivirus techniques.\n\n30\n00:01:39.805 --> 00:01:42.615\nYou really could call it\nanti-malware software.\n\n31\n00:01:42.615 --> 00:01:44.635\nAnd what is the purpose\nof anti-malware software?\n\n32\n00:01:44.635 --> 00:01:50.182\nWe all know that the viruses and code is\nout there that can run on our machines.\n\n33\n00:01:50.182 --> 00:01:53.620\nAnd it can cause some kind of unwanted,\nundesired effect, okay.\n\n34\n00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.585\nNow I'm not talking about\nan application that you don't like.\n\n35\n00:01:55.585 --> 00:01:59.205\nI'm talking some kind of specific\ncode that gets on your machine and\n\n36\n00:01:59.205 --> 00:02:02.200\nnow has some kind of unauthorized or\nundesired effect.\n\n37\n00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.990\nWell, we wanna be aware of that.\n\n38\n00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.620\nAnd one of the purposes of the malware\nprotection is to remember, first and\n\n39\n00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.120\nforemost, it's about user awareness,\nall right?\n\n40\n00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.672\nNow I know I put it at the bottom of\nthe list here, but as looking at it.\n\n41\n00:02:14.672 --> 00:02:16.930\nAnd it really should be\nat the top of the list.\n\n42\n00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.290\nAnd what do I mean by user awareness?\n\n43\n00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.760\nWell if you don't have\nanti-virus software, right.\n\n44\n00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.339\nLet me play devil's advocate here and\nstep back.\n\n45\n00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:25.471\nAnd say what if you don't\nhave anti-virus software, and\n\n46\n00:02:25.471 --> 00:02:27.470\na virus gets onto your computer?\n\n47\n00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.610\nAre you gonna be aware of it?\n\n48\n00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.530\nAnd most likely you're not\nuntil something goes wrong.\n\n49\n00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.010\nYou start to see some kind of that\nundesired effect like I was mentioning.\n\n50\n00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.010\nCommand prompts going\noff on your computer and\n\n51\n00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.850\ndisappearing, applications launching,\nright.\n\n52\n00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.279\nOr your computer starts looking,\nit starts running pretty bad, right.\n\n53\n00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:49.946\nThe performance starts to deteriorate,\nnow we're aware that something's wrong.\n\n54\n00:02:49.946 --> 00:02:53.448\nBut we don't know, we know the symptoms.\n\n55\n00:02:53.448 --> 00:02:56.490\nWe know that it's become problematic,\nbut we don't know the source.\n\n56\n00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.036\nAnd that's really what our\nanti-malware software,\n\n57\n00:02:59.036 --> 00:03:02.170\nour anti-virus software\nallows us to do is.\n\n58\n00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.290\nFirst of all,\n\n59\n00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.840\nbeing aware of what the current state\nof the security is in our system.\n\n60\n00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.332\nAnd when it relates to this the malware,\nthe viruses themselves.\n\n61\n00:03:12.332 --> 00:03:18.950\nThe other thing too is just as important\nis the real time counter measures, right.\n\n62\n00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.522\nAnd that's why it is important,\nnot only making you aware of it.\n\n63\n00:03:21.522 --> 00:03:28.090\nBut also providing some kind of real time\naction when this stuff is discovered.\n\n64\n00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.828\nThe other thing is to, for instance,\nprevent data loss and theft, right.\n\n65\n00:03:32.828 --> 00:03:34.635\nYou say, well theft,\nnobody is going to take my computer.\n\n66\n00:03:34.635 --> 00:03:36.484\nWell, maybe not,\nif somebody takes your computer,\n\n67\n00:03:36.484 --> 00:03:37.892\nyou don't have to worry about viruses.\n\n68\n00:03:37.892 --> 00:03:42.791\nThat's the least of your worries, but\nhow about the data that is on that device?\n\n69\n00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:44.840\nAnd that's what we talk about\nwhen we talk about theft.\n\n70\n00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.627\nWe talk about your personal information\nthat maybe you don't want people to\n\n71\n00:03:49.627 --> 00:03:50.688\nhave access to.\n\n72\n00:03:50.688 --> 00:03:52.612\nWe talked about unauthorized\nenterprise access, and\n\n73\n00:03:52.612 --> 00:03:54.045\nthat's one of the things that it helps.\n\n74\n00:03:54.045 --> 00:03:58.455\nIt kinda gives you that first security\ndoor into your system that prevents\n\n75\n00:03:58.455 --> 00:04:00.445\nthe unauthorized access.\n\n76\n00:04:00.445 --> 00:04:02.905\nAs well as overall just reducing the,\n\n77\n00:04:02.905 --> 00:04:07.165\nwhat we would call the TCO, right,\nthe total cost of ownership.\n\n78\n00:04:07.165 --> 00:04:09.905\nNow, you might think in a home\nenvironment, well that TCO,\n\n79\n00:04:09.905 --> 00:04:12.225\nI don't really care about that.\n\n80\n00:04:12.225 --> 00:04:15.682\nWell, that's understandable, but\nin an enterprise environment,\n\n81\n00:04:15.682 --> 00:04:17.742\nyour managers, your project managers.\n\n82\n00:04:17.742 --> 00:04:20.083\nThe people that are over you,\nthey're definitely looking at cost.\n\n83\n00:04:20.083 --> 00:04:26.728\nAnd just starting out by having some kind\nof anti-malware protection is gonna reduce\n\n84\n00:04:26.728 --> 00:04:32.740\nthe overall total cost that it requires\nfor instance to support that system.\n\n85\n00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.680\nCuz think about it, if you get a virus\nit starts wiping out your system.\n\n86\n00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.280\nYou've got some kind of support staff\nthat's gonna have to come to your\n\n87\n00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.130\ncomputer.\n\n88\n00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.070\nWhether remote administration or\nthey're sneaker-netting it and\n\n89\n00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.350\nthey're right in front of your computer\nand they've got to fix these things.\n\n90\n00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.450\nThe other thing, too, is that data that's\non that computer isn't owned by you.\n\n91\n00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.300\nIt's owned by the company,\nit's intellectual property of the company.\n\n92\n00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.340\nAnd that's where it can get really costly\nbecause if they steal that information,\n\n93\n00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.230\nif they erase that information, whatever.\n\n94\n00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.370\nJust, again, tampering of that information\ncould cause your company a lot of money.\n\n95\n00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.890\nSo that's one of the,\n\n96\n00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.920\nsome of the main goals when we look\nat the purpose of malware protection.\n\n97\n00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.240\nNow I wanna go a little\nbit farther than that.\n\n98\n00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.990\nI wanna kind of talk about the basics\nof malware protection, all right.\n\n99\n00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.740\nBasics of malware protection is\nyou typically have some kind of\n\n100\n00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:16.900\nscanning service.\n\n101\n00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.932\nAnd when we talk about a scanning service,\nthe scanning service is\n\n102\n00:05:20.932 --> 00:05:25.758\ntypically doing proactive real time\nmonitoring of common locations, right?\n\n103\n00:05:25.758 --> 00:05:28.755\nAnd I just kind of give you some\nexamples of those locations, right?\n\n104\n00:05:28.755 --> 00:05:32.480\nYour folder system, your filesystem I\nshould say, your folder hierarchy and\n\n105\n00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.950\ndifferent directories where\nyou store information.\n\n106\n00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.786\nIt's gonna look in these common areas,\ncommon locations,\n\n107\n00:05:37.786 --> 00:05:39.794\nlike your program's folders if you will.\n\n108\n00:05:39.794 --> 00:05:43.885\nThings like where your Windows\noperating system is stored.\n\n109\n00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:48.332\nThe other thing, in totality it's gonna\nbe looking at the hard drive, right, and\n\n110\n00:05:48.332 --> 00:05:49.419\nextra hard drives.\n\n111\n00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:52.300\nI put a hard drive up here\nyou might say well don't my\n\n112\n00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.250\nfolders reside on the hard drive?\n\n113\n00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.640\nThey do, but\nwhat if you have more than one hard drive?\n\n114\n00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.390\nIs that second hard drive being\nmonitored if you're storing data in it?\n\n115\n00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.488\nWell that data is going from\none hard drive to the next, and\n\n116\n00:06:02.488 --> 00:06:03.953\nif you're not aware of it.\n\n117\n00:06:03.953 --> 00:06:07.423\nYou very well could have malicious code\nin that data that's being transferred to\n\n118\n00:06:07.423 --> 00:06:10.140\nanother drive, so that's important too.\n\n119\n00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.120\nThe other thing is removable media,\nthis is a big one right?\n\n120\n00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.978\nThis is definitely becoming more\nproblematic as things like USB drives and\n\n121\n00:06:17.978 --> 00:06:22.380\nstuff become more and\nmore cheaper and cheaper and cheaper.\n\n122\n00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.590\nIs the fact that you can transfer files\n\n123\n00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.840\nthat do contain malicious data in them\nto a computer just by plugging it in.\n\n124\n00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.208\nWell wouldn't it be nice to\nhave that real time protection.\n\n125\n00:06:33.208 --> 00:06:36.537\nThat when you plug a device in you\ncan say apply some default action.\n\n126\n00:06:36.537 --> 00:06:42.960\nLet me scan this USB drive before I'm\nallowed to transfer the information.\n\n127\n00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.261\nNow what is it doing, when I say scanning\nservice what is it actually doing.\n\n128\n00:06:46.261 --> 00:06:48.051\nWell it depends but very basically,\n\n129\n00:06:48.051 --> 00:06:51.900\nwhat you have is something known as\na signature database, all right.\n\n130\n00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.450\nAnd the signature database guys\njust think of it a definition,\n\n131\n00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.510\nthink about what you do when you\nlook it up a dictionary, right.\n\n132\n00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.160\nI don't know what a cat is, all right.\n\n133\n00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.730\nWell I do know what it is but\nI don't know what a cat is, so\n\n134\n00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:04.898\nI go to the dictionary, right.\n\n135\n00:07:04.898 --> 00:07:08.867\nAnd it kinda tells me what a cat is, and\nheck, if it's a really good dictionary.\n\n136\n00:07:08.867 --> 00:07:11.250\nI might even get a picture, so\nI could see what it looks like.\n\n137\n00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.680\nSo that's all your definitions are,\ninside of this database.\n\n138\n00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.990\nIt's saying, this is what\na virus looks like, all right.\n\n139\n00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.920\nAnd it's just a little piece of code\nthat it then turns around and it scans.\n\n140\n00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.079\nAnd it says okay, let me take\nthe information that's in this database,\n\n141\n00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:27.135\nand let me look at these locations.\n\n142\n00:07:27.135 --> 00:07:30.060\nAnd do I see inside of\nthese common locations,\n\n143\n00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.612\nanything that matches that signature.\n\n144\n00:07:32.612 --> 00:07:36.420\nThat definition,\nthat what defines what a virus looks like.\n\n145\n00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:41.040\nAnd if I find a match, here's where\nthe real time protection comes in and\n\n146\n00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.430\nthe user awareness.\n\n147\n00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:46.029\nI'm gonna make you aware that\naccording to what I see here.\n\n148\n00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:49.953\nAnd according to what my dictionary,\nif you will, my database says,\n\n149\n00:07:49.953 --> 00:07:51.225\nthat might be a virus.\n\n150\n00:07:51.225 --> 00:07:54.205\nOr it could be an exact match and\nit knows it's a virus.\n\n151\n00:07:54.205 --> 00:07:58.446\nAnd now you get the ability to\nprovide some kind of action.\n\n152\n00:07:58.446 --> 00:08:02.270\nRight, to what it's found.\n\n153\n00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:06.407\nAll right, so that's some of the basics\nof the malware protection and\n\n154\n00:08:06.407 --> 00:08:07.609\nwhy we would use it.\n\n155\n00:08:07.609 --> 00:08:13.393\nNow, I wanna talk about two of the major\ntools that they call out for the MTA.\n\n156\n00:08:13.393 --> 00:08:17.269\nAll right, and that is Windows Defender\nand something known as, you might see it\n\n157\n00:08:17.269 --> 00:08:21.272\nabbreviated inside of your operating\nsystem, and I'll show you coming up, MRT.\n\n158\n00:08:21.272 --> 00:08:25.624\nThat [LAUGH] MRT doesn't actually map\nreally good to its name there, so\n\n159\n00:08:25.624 --> 00:08:30.147\nlet me go ahead and just, I won't use\nthe MRT designation here at first.\n\n160\n00:08:30.147 --> 00:08:33.528\nThat is\nthe Malicious Software Removal Toolkit.\n\n161\n00:08:33.528 --> 00:08:37.060\nNow, I wanna go ahead and I wanna kind\nof focus in on Defender because these,\n\n162\n00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:41.190\nbelieve it or not, they have two\nvery different purposes, okay.\n\n163\n00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:45.780\nThe ultimate end goal is to get rid\nof malicious data, right, data,\n\n164\n00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.214\nviruses if you will.\n\n165\n00:08:47.214 --> 00:08:52.980\nBut however, how they approach\nthat end result is different.\n\n166\n00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.020\nSo when we look at Windows Defender,\n\n167\n00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.430\nWindows Defender provides\nyou real-time protection.\n\n168\n00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:00.690\nRemember I was telling\nyou user awareness and\n\n169\n00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.280\nbeing aware of what's going\non in your computer, right?\n\n170\n00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.290\nWe talk about a lot of security,\nwhether it's a policy,\n\n171\n00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.720\nwhether it's an application,\nwhether it's some kind of implementation,\n\n172\n00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.570\na lot of times it starts\nwith the user awareness.\n\n173\n00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:15.620\nSo we get real-time protection.\n\n174\n00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:16.760\nThe other thing that we get,\n\n175\n00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:21.140\nand I really like this because if\nyou don't understand the malware,\n\n176\n00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:26.180\nwell, it can get a little bit challenging\nas to what you might need to do as a user.\n\n177\n00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:30.250\nWindows Defender has a really\nminimalistic user interaction.\n\n178\n00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:33.656\nThere's not a lot that's\nrequired by the end user and\n\n179\n00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:36.014\nit silently runs in the background.\n\n180\n00:09:36.014 --> 00:09:39.581\nAnd we hope,\nif we're updating our computers,\n\n181\n00:09:39.581 --> 00:09:42.950\nthat it's gonna do its job, all right?\n\n182\n00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:47.490\nNow, it applies something known as\nsignature-based recognition, right?\n\n183\n00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.842\nThat's that database,\njust think of it as a dictionary, and\n\n184\n00:09:49.842 --> 00:09:51.348\nI've got all these definitions here.\n\n185\n00:09:51.348 --> 00:09:54.310\nAnd these definitions tell\nme what a virus looks like.\n\n186\n00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:59.630\nIf the definition says ABCD is this type\na virus, and I look in that file system,\n\n187\n00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:05.190\nI look at that hard drive, that USB drive,\nand I see ABCD, guess what?\n\n188\n00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.510\nLooks like a duck, walks like a duck,\nprobably a duck, right?\n\n189\n00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:08.710\nSame thing with a virus.\n\n190\n00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:10.210\nThe other thing is heuristics-based.\n\n191\n00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.310\nNow, don't worry too much about that term.\n\n192\n00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:14.660\nThat terms sounds absolutely crazy,\nall right?\n\n193\n00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.840\nI want you to think about\nit as a best guess.\n\n194\n00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.800\nRemember I said ABCD is a virus?\n\n195\n00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:23.620\nWell I see ABC_, is it a virus?\n\n196\n00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.920\nI don't know but boy, it really has\nthe characteristics of a virus,\n\n197\n00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.180\nat least I can see\na portion of it that does.\n\n198\n00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:32.720\nSo my best guess Is that it's a virus.\n\n199\n00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.521\nNow, heuristics versus signature-based\ndefinitions, what are the benefits?\n\n200\n00:10:37.521 --> 00:10:42.030\nWell, first of all, make sure that your\nsignature database is constantly updated.\n\n201\n00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:46.100\nAnd Windows Defender updates in the\nbackground with Windows Update already.\n\n202\n00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.130\nSo make sure those updates\nare continually running.\n\n203\n00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:52.690\nI will tell you, with heuristics-based,\nyou gotta be a little careful.\n\n204\n00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:54.102\nBecause what if it wasn't ABCD?\n\n205\n00:10:54.102 --> 00:10:55.732\nMaybe it was ABCE.\n\n206\n00:10:55.732 --> 00:10:57.133\nThat isn't a virus.\n\n207\n00:10:57.133 --> 00:10:59.277\nSo it can do what's known\nas a false positive.\n\n208\n00:10:59.277 --> 00:11:02.150\nIt can say well, I thought it was a virus,\nI tried to help you out.\n\n209\n00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:07.100\nBut actually that was a component in your\noperating system that helps Office work.\n\n210\n00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:11.360\nNow, Windows Defender is very aware\nof Microsoft-based products, but\n\n211\n00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.550\nthe analogy still applies.\n\n212\n00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:16.160\nAll right,\nhere's the other thing to keep in mind.\n\n213\n00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.040\nAnd this is one of the big differences\nbetween the next one that we're gonna\n\n214\n00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.160\ntalk about.\n\n215\n00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:27.440\nThe goal is to prevent malware from\ninfecting the PC, proactively, all right?\n\n216\n00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.350\nAnd that's the big difference.\n\n217\n00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:34.860\nThis tries to stop malware before\nit even gets onto your computer.\n\n218\n00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.810\nAll right, and\nwe do need to keep that in mind.\n\n219\n00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:39.830\nAll right,\nnow let's go ahead and show you.\n\n220\n00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.770\nI know I've done a lot of talking here,\nwe're gonna come back to the MRT here in\n\n221\n00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:46.270\na second, or excuse me,\nthe Malicious Software Removal Toolkit.\n\n222\n00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:49.010\nBut I wanna go ahead and I wanna\nswitch over to our Windows machine and\n\n223\n00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:51.480\nshow you a little bit more about\nWindows Defender because there's\n\n224\n00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.790\na couple of different\nlocations that it is today.\n\n225\n00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:56.910\nYou might see in Windows 10, and\nas you're progressing through this series,\n\n226\n00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:01.710\nthat Microsoft is kind of\nmaintaining two different UIs today.\n\n227\n00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:03.700\nKinda like we talked about command line,\nand\n\n228\n00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.515\nwe talked about graphical user interface.\n\n229\n00:12:05.515 --> 00:12:08.400\nWell, in the graphical [LAUGH]\nuser interface, they're now\n\n230\n00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:12.620\nkinda maintaining two types of different\ninterfaces to get to these locations.\n\n231\n00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:15.160\nI'm gonna go to the traditional route\nthat maybe you're already aware of, and\n\n232\n00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.770\nthat's Control Panel.\n\n233\n00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:19.650\nWe're gonna go ahead, and we're gonna\nright-click on our Windows charm.\n\n234\n00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:20.690\nWe'll choose Control Panel.\n\n235\n00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.323\nAnd then we're gonna go down\nhere to System and Security.\n\n236\n00:12:23.323 --> 00:12:26.940\nAnd you know what, it's easier, honestly,\nthis one is easier to find if I just\n\n237\n00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:31.020\nturn around and change it from\ncategory view to large icons.\n\n238\n00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.910\nIt gets a little bit tricky\nto find in the category view.\n\n239\n00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:36.240\nAnd if you'll notice,\nthere's this little shield icon.\n\n240\n00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.119\nDon't confuse this, guys,\nwith the UAC shield.\n\n241\n00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:43.026\nIn certain aspects you are required to\nbe an administrator to look at different\n\n242\n00:12:43.026 --> 00:12:46.140\nthings in here, but this shield is\njust the Windows Defender icon.\n\n243\n00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:52.300\nAnd if I open this up, all right, now it's\ntelling me what's new, that's my job.\n\n244\n00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.651\nSo [LAUGH] I'm gonna close this dialogue\nbox here or this episode's gonna end,\n\n245\n00:12:55.651 --> 00:12:58.110\nwe can just pause on this and\nlet you read it.\n\n246\n00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:02.910\nBut this is the older interface for\nWindows Defender.\n\n247\n00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:07.420\nIn fact, it goes back to the interface for\na technology that you could download after\n\n248\n00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:11.950\nthe fact in Windows 7 that was called the\nMicrosoft Security Essentials platform.\n\n249\n00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:16.980\nWell, Windows had their enterprise\nlevel software called Forefront,\n\n250\n00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:22.990\nand they were also maintaining the client\nside called Client-side Security.\n\n251\n00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:26.034\nSo when Windows 8.1 came out,\nthey said, you know what?\n\n252\n00:13:26.034 --> 00:13:29.974\nRather than just trying to manage these\ndifferent technologies that are really\n\n253\n00:13:29.974 --> 00:13:32.678\ndoing the same thing,\nwe'll take Windows Defender,\n\n254\n00:13:32.678 --> 00:13:36.634\nwe'll take Microsoft Security Essentials,\nand we'll blend them together.\n\n255\n00:13:36.634 --> 00:13:39.936\nAnd we'll stick them in the operating\nsystem going out the gate.\n\n256\n00:13:39.936 --> 00:13:44.880\nAll right, so that's just a little bit of\na history behind where Windows Defender\n\n257\n00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.826\nwas and where it's come to now.\n\n258\n00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:48.671\nAll right, so what can we do here?\n\n259\n00:13:48.671 --> 00:13:52.461\nAll right, well, we can perform\nquick scans, what's a quick scan?\n\n260\n00:13:52.461 --> 00:13:54.112\nRemember those common\nareas that I told you?\n\n261\n00:13:54.112 --> 00:13:58.991\nIt's just gonna look in some\nreally common areas that it thinks\n\n262\n00:13:58.991 --> 00:14:02.870\nmaybe these viruses might be found in.\n\n263\n00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:03.840\nNow, what's the full scan?\n\n264\n00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.470\nIt's exactly what it says.\n\n265\n00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:08.610\nIt says I don't care if it's a common\nlocation or not, I'm scanning it anyways.\n\n266\n00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:10.340\nAnd it's gonna take awhile.\n\n267\n00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:11.920\nThe next one is a custom scan.\n\n268\n00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.828\nAnd when you do a custom scan and\nyou go to do a Scan now,\n\n269\n00:14:14.828 --> 00:14:18.010\nit gives you the ability to get\na little bit more granular.\n\n270\n00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:21.610\nMaybe Ronnie comes to me and says,\nhey Wes, I've got a thumb drive.\n\n271\n00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:23.030\nWe've got an isolated machine here.\n\n272\n00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:24.588\nCan you scan this thumb drive for me?\n\n273\n00:14:24.588 --> 00:14:26.050\nWell, I could plug the thumb drive in and\n\n274\n00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:29.240\nwe could find out just if that\nthumb drive is having a virus.\n\n275\n00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.288\nNow, there is kind of a caveat to that.\n\n276\n00:14:31.288 --> 00:14:35.812\nA custom scan also does a quick scan.\n\n277\n00:14:35.812 --> 00:14:37.189\nSo [LAUGH] and when you do custom,\n\n278\n00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:39.332\ndon't think you can get\naway with the quick scan.\n\n279\n00:14:39.332 --> 00:14:41.175\nBecause it performs a quick scan and\n\n280\n00:14:41.175 --> 00:14:43.948\nthen looks into the area you\njust customized as well.\n\n281\n00:14:43.948 --> 00:14:46.707\nSo just as a heads up there.\n\n282\n00:14:46.707 --> 00:14:48.065\nNow, once that's done,\n\n283\n00:14:48.065 --> 00:14:51.480\nthat's really all [LAUGH] we're\ndoing here in Windows Defender.\n\n284\n00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.100\nYou got some other things you can do like,\nfor instance, updates.\n\n285\n00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.460\nRemember our Signature database?\n\n286\n00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.565\nIf I wanted to make sure I had\nthe current dictionary, right,\n\n287\n00:14:58.565 --> 00:15:00.850\nMerriam-Webster's dictionary, right?\n\n288\n00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:02.470\nI'd look for the current revision.\n\n289\n00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:04.540\nWell, think about this as\nupdating the definitions.\n\n290\n00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.750\nBeing able to say, you know what,\nI don't wanna buy a new book but\n\n291\n00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:08.720\nI do one to slip a few\nmore pages in the book.\n\n292\n00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.533\nWell, that's what this is gonna do.\n\n293\n00:15:09.533 --> 00:15:13.732\nIt's gonna put more definitions,\nif you will, in Signature so\n\n294\n00:15:13.732 --> 00:15:16.020\nthat we identify as viruses.\n\n295\n00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.620\nAnd the other great thing here is too,\n\n296\n00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:21.720\nis that I can see when this\nwas last updated, right?\n\n297\n00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:26.420\nI can know what is the definition version,\ncuz it's an entire database, if you will.\n\n298\n00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:32.452\nAnd when I say entire database, it might\nlook back here at your Windows Defender\n\n299\n00:15:32.452 --> 00:15:37.596\nand say, hey, you've got 75%\nof the entire database, right.\n\n300\n00:15:37.596 --> 00:15:39.517\nBut it now includes these extra pages.\n\n301\n00:15:39.517 --> 00:15:41.357\nAnd again, I'm speaking proverbially here,\n\n302\n00:15:41.357 --> 00:15:43.245\nwe're talking about\nelectronic information.\n\n303\n00:15:43.245 --> 00:15:45.745\nAnd I can also see when\nthe definitions were created.\n\n304\n00:15:45.745 --> 00:15:49.466\nSo this is good to find out\nif you are up to date or not.\n\n305\n00:15:49.466 --> 00:15:53.890\nIf you wanna update, you just click Update\nand it reaches out to Windows Update and\n\n306\n00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:56.857\nit downloads any Virus\ndefinitions that might be new.\n\n307\n00:15:56.857 --> 00:16:00.609\nHowever, if you're doing your due\ndiligence, and you've got Windows Update\n\n308\n00:16:00.609 --> 00:16:04.810\nalready running, every time Windows Update\nconnects, it's checking this database.\n\n309\n00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:08.090\nSo don't turn off those updates.\n\n310\n00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:13.380\nNow remember I said that certain\nportions of this might require\n\n311\n00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.070\nadministrative privileges?\n\n312\n00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:17.270\nI believe,\nif I go to the history location,\n\n313\n00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:20.270\nI'm gonna see the user account\ncontrol shield right there.\n\n314\n00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:21.030\nWhy is that?\n\n315\n00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:24.229\nWell it does tell you, right here,\nto protect user privacy,\n\n316\n00:16:24.229 --> 00:16:26.145\nthese items are hidden, all right?\n\n317\n00:16:26.145 --> 00:16:29.925\nAnd if I'm a standard user and Ronnie's\nan administrator on this machine, Ronnie\n\n318\n00:16:29.925 --> 00:16:33.873\nmight not want me seeing what other people\nare doing because he's doing the auditing.\n\n319\n00:16:33.873 --> 00:16:35.501\nHe's the administrator, right?\n\n320\n00:16:35.501 --> 00:16:39.044\nSo I don't need to see that information,\nand that's why they keep\n\n321\n00:16:39.044 --> 00:16:42.790\nthis as an administrative elevation\nthat you would have to do.\n\n322\n00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:44.880\nNow I am an administrator\nhere on this machine so\n\n323\n00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:48.810\nI really don't have to worry about it,\nbut at least you know why they do that.\n\n324\n00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:50.370\nSo keep that in mind,\n\n325\n00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:53.950\nnotice that it didn't have a shield\njust to launch the interface up.\n\n326\n00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:56.620\nZen alert, there is some things that\n\n327\n00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:58.820\nrequire administrator level\nprivileges in Defender.\n\n328\n00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:02.870\nAnd I can see any quarantined items,\nan item that it found and\n\n329\n00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.340\nit puts it to the side in\na protected location but\n\n330\n00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:07.650\nit's not removed from\nthe computer just like you seen.\n\n331\n00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:11.260\nMaybe there are certain things that it\nhas said, hey, that's a virus and you say\n\n332\n00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:15.180\nno it's not, it can be an allowed item you\ncan mark it as allowed and it's gonna run.\n\n333\n00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:18.110\nCareful make sure you know\nwhat you're doing on that one.\n\n334\n00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:21.820\nAnd then all detected items\nin the history, all right.\n\n335\n00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:23.520\nSettings, what can we do here in settings?\n\n336\n00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.300\nNow notice what happens.\n\n337\n00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.230\nIt takes us to a completely\ndifferent location, and\n\n338\n00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:32.150\nthat's why I told you Microsoft is having\nto support two different interfaces.\n\n339\n00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:33.150\nAnd in fact,\n\n340\n00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:36.420\nlet me show you the way that you would\nget to that if we were at the desktop.\n\n341\n00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:40.420\nNow my head's kinda covering it up because\nthis is the new action center down here\n\n342\n00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:43.800\nall the way at the bottom, and\nI can see some notifications down here.\n\n343\n00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.790\nThis little flag icon,\nthat's the Action Center today.\n\n344\n00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:50.940\nAnd if I go to the Action Center, and\nthen you'll see all settings here.\n\n345\n00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:54.390\nIn fact, recent, you can see\nWindows Defender is actually running in\n\n346\n00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:56.560\nthe background for me as we speak.\n\n347\n00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.970\nAnd that's the good thing about\nthe real time protection.\n\n348\n00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:00.169\nNotice I go to all settings.\n\n349\n00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:03.300\nThis is the new Windows Settings menu.\n\n350\n00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:06.200\nWe're gonna go to Update &amp; Security and\nthen you'll see,\n\n351\n00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.520\nthis is basically, guys, where it took me.\n\n352\n00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.780\nBut you might need to know that for\nthe exam cuz it is a new interface and\n\n353\n00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:17.140\nMicrosoft likes to test on new things that\nare coming out on the operating system.\n\n354\n00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.390\nAll right,\nremember I said the real-time protection?\n\n355\n00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:21.430\nHere we get our real-time protection.\n\n356\n00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:22.830\nRemember, I said heuristics?\n\n357\n00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:26.400\nI think it looks like a virus,\nbut I'm not sure?\n\n358\n00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.108\nWell, heuristics also combines it with\nsomething known as cloud-based protection\n\n359\n00:18:30.108 --> 00:18:32.130\nand this is kind of cool, all right?\n\n360\n00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:34.010\nRemember the dictionary that\nI was telling you about?\n\n361\n00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:37.710\nWell, what if somebody else\nhas found another virus,\n\n362\n00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:39.640\nbut it is not in that dictionary, right?\n\n363\n00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.550\nIt's not in that database.\n\n364\n00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:43.540\nThis can reach out to the cloud and\n\n365\n00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.660\nfind things like what we call\nzero day exploits, right?\n\n366\n00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:50.100\nRonnie, it hit his computer,\nhe remedied the situation right away, but\n\n367\n00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:53.660\nI live halfway around the country or\nworld for that matter, and\n\n368\n00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:56.520\nI haven't seen that virus yet\nbut he's already aware of it.\n\n369\n00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.570\nWell, with the submissions that you\ndo in the background giving feedback,\n\n370\n00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:01.150\nyour operating system to Microsoft,\n\n371\n00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:03.840\nthey can put that in the cloud\nbased protection system.\n\n372\n00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.850\nAnd when your system\ndoes an anti virus scan,\n\n373\n00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:08.930\nit reaches out to that cloud and\nit says, is there anything\n\n374\n00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:13.260\nthat we're aware of right now that hasn't\nbeen slipped into Windows Update yet?\n\n375\n00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.342\nIt's a good thing to have.\n\n376\n00:19:15.342 --> 00:19:18.650\nAll right, and that's where the automatic\nsample submissions come in.\n\n377\n00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:20.420\nThis is up to you guy's\nwhether you do it or not.\n\n378\n00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:25.010\nThis isn't a tin foil hat episode\nwhere we're telling you should you or\n\n379\n00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:26.370\nshouldn't you do this.\n\n380\n00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:30.560\nI would recommend it because it's how we\nbecome aware of things in a little bit\n\n381\n00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.240\ncloser to real time.\n\n382\n00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.617\nRemember exclusions,\n\n383\n00:19:33.617 --> 00:19:37.686\nI told you that they called it allowed\nitems in the earlier interface.\n\n384\n00:19:37.686 --> 00:19:41.340\nThat's exclusions, you can say no,\nno I don't wanna scan this location or\n\n385\n00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.900\nI know that this file is not a virus,\nand I wanna be able to run it.\n\n386\n00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.190\nAnd then enhanced notifications,\nyou can see some of the other things.\n\n387\n00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:51.520\nNow, this is new, newer to Windows,\nas Windows Defender Offline.\n\n388\n00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:56.470\nA lot of rootkits, they call them\nrootkits because they start up in\n\n389\n00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:59.020\nthe earliest portions of the boot process.\n\n390\n00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:03.310\nThey're initiated before\nthe operating system even starts.\n\n391\n00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:06.970\nAll right, well if I want to do a scan\noffline, Windows will restart itself and\n\n392\n00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.010\nit won't allow those files to start up.\n\n393\n00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:12.890\nAt least that's the goal and\nit'll do an offline scan.\n\n394\n00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:16.360\nThis does not mean, please understand,\nit doesn't mean that it reaches over and\n\n395\n00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.750\nunplugs your network adapter.\n\n396\n00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:19.450\nIt means it's gonna reboot the system.\n\n397\n00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:22.700\nAnd before those viruses get\ntheir ability to activate and\n\n398\n00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:26.030\ninitialize, again the goal,\nwe can hopefully get to him.\n\n399\n00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:28.330\nDoesn't always work,\nrootkits are very, very smart.\n\n400\n00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:31.350\nSometimes even the best\nsoftware doesn't take them off.\n\n401\n00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:34.500\nBut at least it gives you\nan opportunity and a chance.\n\n402\n00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:39.000\nNow I also talked about the version\ninformation that we have here as well.\n\n403\n00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.760\nI can see the same information here,\nright?\n\n404\n00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:43.420\nThat definition database and\nyou can see that it's, and\n\n405\n00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:47.450\nthis is why I tell you don't get\nhang up on the term antivirus.\n\n406\n00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:49.410\nCan you see these different terms here?\n\n407\n00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:52.050\nSpyware, we've got, what else is here?\n\n408\n00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:54.760\nNIS, network inspection systems, right?\n\n409\n00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.400\nAntivirus definition,\nantimalware client version.\n\n410\n00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.243\nIt's the malware term.\n\n411\n00:20:59.243 --> 00:21:02.275\nThis does more than just viruses alone,\nall right?\n\n412\n00:21:02.275 --> 00:21:04.850\nSo Ronnie, that's a little bit\nabout the Windows Defender.\n\n413\n00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:07.590\nThere is another utility that\nwe wanna talk about briefly.\n\n414\n00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:11.160\nthis one doesn't have all the luster,\nif you will, that Windows Defender does.\n\n415\n00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:15.670\nI like the interface, but\nit's not quite as exciting if you will,\n\n416\n00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:18.640\nI would say, as the Windows Defender here.\n\n417\n00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.370\nAnd that's something known as\nthe malicious software removal tool.\n\n418\n00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:27.470\nNow this is something that if you keep\nyour Windows machines up to date,\n\n419\n00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:30.570\nthis goes back, you can also\nhave this in Windows 7 as well.\n\n420\n00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:35.770\nIt'll install this and it might be\none of those updates that you find,\n\n421\n00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:40.050\nthat you have to agree to an end user\nlicense agreement as part of the update,\n\n422\n00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:44.050\nbefore it even installs,\nand this is again, MRT.\n\n423\n00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:45.810\nHere's the difference, all right?\n\n424\n00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:52.860\nIt is to protect against malware, but\nnotice that it is user initiated.\n\n425\n00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:56.290\nWindows Defender runs in the background\nwith a very minimalistic user interaction\n\n426\n00:21:56.290 --> 00:22:00.040\nrequired unless you need to make\na response to something that you found.\n\n427\n00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.450\nThis doesn't do that.\n\n428\n00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:03.570\nIf you get a virus and\nyou've turned off Windows Defender,\n\n429\n00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:07.080\ndon't expect MRT to help you,\nnot in the least.\n\n430\n00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.430\nIt's a wizard driven interface,\nwhich isn't too bad, but\n\n431\n00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:10.890\nit lacks the real-time protection.\n\n432\n00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.430\nIt is a different utility.\n\n433\n00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:17.750\nIts goal is to remove viruses after\nthey're already on your machine, right?\n\n434\n00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:20.990\nRemember, pro-active with\nWindows Defender, all right?\n\n435\n00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:25.710\nAgain, it's a reactive utility\nversus a proactive utility.\n\n436\n00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:28.770\nSo with that said, let's go ahead and\nswitch back over and let's see if MRT or\n\n437\n00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:33.120\nthe Malicious Software Removal Tool,\nis inside of the operating system.\n\n438\n00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.930\nThe reason guys I keep\nhammering on the MRT\n\n439\n00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:41.820\nis cuz if you type in MRT to a command\nprompt or your search engine here,\n\n440\n00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:45.570\nyou'll see that it says run that command,\nthat little icon right there.\n\n441\n00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:49.140\nAll right, and\nwe'll let this get started up.\n\n442\n00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:54.050\nThere's our user account control,\nand we'll let this run.\n\n443\n00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:54.920\nNow notice what we do.\n\n444\n00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:57.450\nThis is a fairly easy software to run.\n\n445\n00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:59.540\nLike I said, it's wizard driven.\n\n446\n00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:03.560\nAnd you're just gonna choose Next, and\nnotice the scan options are really no\n\n447\n00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.860\ndifferent than what we've seen\ninside of Windows Defender.\n\n448\n00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.330\nNow I'm not gonna run a scan here guys,\n\n449\n00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:10.300\ncuz you guys have probably\nseen these scans run.\n\n450\n00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:14.870\nBut just notice that if I decided that I\nwanted to do a quick scan here I could.\n\n451\n00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:17.386\nBut it's, again, reactive,\nkeep that in mind.\n\n452\n00:23:17.386 --> 00:23:21.130\nNow I also wanna make mention\nof the fact that I told\n\n453\n00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:26.000\nyou that you would have to agree to the\nend user license every time MRT updates.\n\n454\n00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000\nAnd why is that fact?\n\n455\n00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:30.830\nMRT isn't modular, all right?\n\n456\n00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:32.385\nWindows Defender is modular.\n\n457\n00:23:32.385 --> 00:23:36.075\nIt's a framework of an application\nthat they add definitions to.\n\n458\n00:23:36.075 --> 00:23:38.945\nEvery time they come out\nwith an update with MRT,\n\n459\n00:23:38.945 --> 00:23:41.465\nit's a completely rebuilt application.\n\n460\n00:23:41.465 --> 00:23:45.181\nThat's why you're constantly renewing\nthe end-user license agreement,\n\n461\n00:23:45.181 --> 00:23:48.966\nbecause Microsoft is constantly trying\nto stay ahead of the bad guys, right?\n\n462\n00:23:48.966 --> 00:23:53.249\nSo keep that in mind,\nyou might say, I know there was for\n\n463\n00:23:53.249 --> 00:23:56.271\na while there were, I was my gosh.\n\n464\n00:23:56.271 --> 00:23:59.806\nWhy do I have to keep updating\nthe end user license agreement?\n\n465\n00:23:59.806 --> 00:24:01.577\nAnd that's why,\ntechnically under the hood,\n\n466\n00:24:01.577 --> 00:24:04.360\nit's a different application\nevery single time.\n\n467\n00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:10.310\nSo that is one way that we can protect,\nif you will, in real time our computers.\n\n468\n00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:14.970\nBut wouldn't it be nice to have something\nthat is protecting, not just viruses,\n\n469\n00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:19.060\nbut all communications coming into and\ngoing out of your computer.\n\n470\n00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:22.480\nAnd that's where the next topic comes\nin and that's the Windows Firewall.\n\n471\n00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.160\nNow, with the Windows Firewall,\n\n472\n00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:28.460\nit's a traditional firewall just like\nany other firewall that's out there.\n\n473\n00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:31.290\nThe difference is this one\nis built in by default.\n\n474\n00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:33.170\nWe're gonna go to control panel.\n\n475\n00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:36.730\nAll right, and if you're in large\nicons you can find it fairly easy.\n\n476\n00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:39.180\nIf you aren't, you can go to\nthe Windows system and security,\n\n477\n00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:42.510\nand you'll see here up at the top,\nWindows firewall.\n\n478\n00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:44.840\nNow a couple of times we've gone\nto security and maintenance, and\n\n479\n00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.290\nwe've also gone to the security section.\n\n480\n00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:51.120\nAll right, and I can see that the firewall\nis on, but you'll notice something.\n\n481\n00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.490\nI don't really have the ability\nto set anything here.\n\n482\n00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:56.840\nI do wanna make mention of that\njust in case they bring it up.\n\n483\n00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:00.530\nBut if I go to the firewall,\nhere's my options, right.\n\n484\n00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:04.580\nThis is the basic firewall, and\na firewall essentially blocks all inbound\n\n485\n00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:09.860\ncommunication coming to your computer\nexcept for what you allow through it.\n\n486\n00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:13.320\nThat's what we call in security,\nwe call it an implicit deny, all right.\n\n487\n00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:19.570\nIt means everything is denied except for\nyou specifically allow, all right.\n\n488\n00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:22.720\nAnd if we wanted to,\nwe could change notification settings.\n\n489\n00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.400\nFor instance, if you wanna turn them off.\n\n490\n00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.090\nAgain, remember user\nawareness is on of the first\n\n491\n00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:29.700\nentry points of a good security base.\n\n492\n00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:33.890\nIf your not aware that something's\nhappening you could be unsecure and\n\n493\n00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:36.220\nnot even realize it so\nI don't really mess with those.\n\n494\n00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.720\nYou can if you want to but\nI wouldn't recommend it.\n\n495\n00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.990\nAll right,\nwe can turn the firewall on or off here.\n\n496\n00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:43.010\nThat's fairly simple like a light switch,\nright?\n\n497\n00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:45.120\nWe can restore to the defaults and\nyou're like me and\n\n498\n00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:48.520\nyou can configure it until\nit's broke well that's okay.\n\n499\n00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.020\nHit the reset to default,\nso you can start over, and\n\n500\n00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:52.650\nthat's always a good thing to happen.\n\n501\n00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:56.420\nLet me go ahead and show you real quick\nhow we can do the allow an application or\n\n502\n00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.420\nfeature through the firewall.\n\n503\n00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:02.630\nAll right, I want you to notice that\nthis does require administrative level\n\n504\n00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:06.800\nprivileges, because this is not\nonly changing core functionality.\n\n505\n00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:09.750\nThis is changing the core security\nof your operating system, and\n\n506\n00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:13.220\nit's just as simple as\nturning something on or off.\n\n507\n00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:14.750\nNow you might notice something here.\n\n508\n00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:16.900\nWhat's this private and public about?\n\n509\n00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:21.850\nAll right, well the private and public\nis about something known as profiles.\n\n510\n00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:26.370\nProfiles for your Windows firewall is\na global suite of settings that apply\n\n511\n00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:28.370\ndepending on what network\nyou're connected to.\n\n512\n00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:30.260\nIf you're connected to a home network,\n\n513\n00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:33.950\nyou could mark it as private and other\ncomputers can see you on the network.\n\n514\n00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:37.130\nWhich means the firewall's\na little less restrictive.\n\n515\n00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:41.450\nHowever, if you're on a public network,\nlike a public hotspot and you denote that\n\n516\n00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:47.250\nas your network location when it asks you,\nthen what happens is you're really.\n\n517\n00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:51.250\nTightening up the firewall in the fact\nthat you don't really want anything to,\n\n518\n00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:53.290\nyou don't want to be seen.\n\n519\n00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:55.420\nYou don't wanna allow\nanybody to connect to you.\n\n520\n00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:58.120\nSo it's definitely one of those\nthings that we recommend for\n\n521\n00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:01.740\nthese public hotspots.\n\n522\n00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.020\nNow there is another suite of\nsettings that you can use.\n\n523\n00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:08.220\nI don't really expect them to have\ntoo much on this on the MTA, but\n\n524\n00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:09.680\nI just want to mention it here.\n\n525\n00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:14.000\nNotice that I can set in-bound\ncommunications, allow them or deny them.\n\n526\n00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.570\nWell, I can also go a little bit more\nadvanced and choose the advanced option.\n\n527\n00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:21.430\nAnd then you get what's known as the\nWindows Firewall with Advanced Security.\n\n528\n00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:24.270\nWe talk about the Windows Firewall\nwith Advanced Security, and\n\n529\n00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:27.750\nwhat this does essentially\nis allow me to not only\n\n530\n00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:33.090\ncontrol inbound rules, but\nallows me to control outbound rules.\n\n531\n00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:34.920\nI have a lot more options in here.\n\n532\n00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:39.750\nI can specify things like ports,\nthe specific service, whether it's open or\n\n533\n00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:44.030\nclosed, allowed, deny, and including\nmore advanced features like IPsec,\n\n534\n00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:46.890\nwhich I don't really expect\nthem to ask you too much.\n\n535\n00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:49.710\nBut if you needed to configure\nthings like that, including IPsec,\n\n536\n00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:51.720\nyou can do it right here\nin the advanced firewall.\n\n537\n00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:57.370\nAll right, so we talked about,\na lot about these security technologies.\n\n538\n00:27:57.370 --> 00:28:02.100\nWhat is it that drives a lot of these\napplications that we've been looking at?\n\n539\n00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:06.640\nWhat drives a lot of the firewall,\nthe Windows Defender?\n\n540\n00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.910\nAnd that's something known as services.\n\n541\n00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:13.820\nWhen we look at services, services\nare a background process that run.\n\n542\n00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:16.110\nAnd you might say, well,\nwait a second, don't applications run?\n\n543\n00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.370\nAnd, yes, they do.\n\n544\n00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:19.890\nBut the difference between a service and\nan application,\n\n545\n00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:23.065\na service runs in the background and\ntypically it's not user initiated.\n\n546\n00:28:23.065 --> 00:28:25.605\nAnd a lot of times you\ndon't even run it yourself.\n\n547\n00:28:25.605 --> 00:28:27.335\nYou don't launch it.\n\n548\n00:28:27.335 --> 00:28:30.245\nAn application is something that is\ntypically launched by the end user.\n\n549\n00:28:30.245 --> 00:28:33.205\nBut these are important processes\nthat happen in the background,\n\n550\n00:28:33.205 --> 00:28:35.150\nso that Windows can maintain itself.\n\n551\n00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:38.215\nThey can keep itself running,\nkeep itself stable.\n\n552\n00:28:38.215 --> 00:28:40.915\nLet me go ahead and\nshow you a little bit about our services.\n\n553\n00:28:40.915 --> 00:28:43.517\nThere's a few different ways\nthat you can get to this.\n\n554\n00:28:43.517 --> 00:28:46.330\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nmake this a little easier.\n\n555\n00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:49.320\nJust by choosing services.msc.\n\n556\n00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:54.690\nThis is the services Microsoft\nmanagement console, however, I'll tell\n\n557\n00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:58.480\nyou it's in your administrative tools by\nitself, as well as in computer management.\n\n558\n00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.840\nYou can find it there too.\n\n559\n00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.280\nHowever, it's the same console.\n\n560\n00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.550\nIt really doesn't matter which one we use.\n\n561\n00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:06.030\nKnow a few different\nways to get the services.\n\n562\n00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:09.200\nKnow where they reside just\nin case the exam ask you.\n\n563\n00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.660\nThese are all the background\nprocesses that you have.\n\n564\n00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:15.010\nWhen I say background process,\ndoes that mean everything is running?\n\n565\n00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:15.620\nThe answer is no.\n\n566\n00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:18.700\nNot all of these services\nare really going to be needed and\n\n567\n00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:20.150\nsome of them you can see aren't running.\n\n568\n00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:23.780\nAnd that's the good thing about being able\nto filter these name column headers and\n\n569\n00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:28.350\nsort them according to what's maybe\nrunning and what's not running, all right?\n\n570\n00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:30.710\nNow they also have something\nknown as a startup type.\n\n571\n00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:34.330\nStartup type depends,\nit's exactly like it says guys.\n\n572\n00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:36.060\nWhen do these services run?\n\n573\n00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:42.090\nAll right, and every service has\na default startup type, if you will.\n\n574\n00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:44.650\nLet me find our favorite, right?\n\n575\n00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:47.354\nEverybody loves supporting printers,\nright?\n\n576\n00:29:47.354 --> 00:29:50.156\n[LAUGH] I'm just kidding, literally.\n\n577\n00:29:50.156 --> 00:29:51.820\n[LAUGH] Prints puller, right?\n\n578\n00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:54.840\nThis is a service that basically\nis the printer inside of Windows.\n\n579\n00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.780\nYou look at Microsoft documentation,\nthat little physical device that you got\n\n580\n00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:00.220\nthat the paper comes out,\nthat's not the printer.\n\n581\n00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:01.010\nThis is a printer,\n\n582\n00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:05.010\nit is a service that manges\nthe print process from begin to end.\n\n583\n00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:07.200\nNotice that it has a start up type and\n\n584\n00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.340\nthis start up type tells\nus that it's automatic.\n\n585\n00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:13.610\nIt means the moment this computer boots,\nboot start drivers, boot start services\n\n586\n00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:17.170\nthat are required to get the operating\nsystem boot strap are going to start and\n\n587\n00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:17.849\nthen so is this.\n\n588\n00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:21.580\nSometimes services can cause problems,\nright?\n\n589\n00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:25.940\nSometimes for whatever reason\nservice doesn't work right.\n\n590\n00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:28.130\nThis one it happens a lot, right?\n\n591\n00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:29.480\nSo what can I do?\n\n592\n00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:33.550\nWell, I get the ability that if I want,\nI can reboot the printer,\n\n593\n00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:35.940\nI know this is getting funny,\nwell what do you mean reboot the printer?\n\n594\n00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:38.460\nAgain, I'm not talking\nabout the print device.\n\n595\n00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:39.490\nWhere the paper comes out.\n\n596\n00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:42.270\nI'm talking about the service that\nsupports your printing abilities and\n\n597\n00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:44.150\ncapabilities inside of Windows.\n\n598\n00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:49.260\nIf need to reboot it, it's simple as stop,\nyou can see that it does stop right there.\n\n599\n00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:51.410\nAnd I can turn around, and I can start it.\n\n600\n00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:55.090\nThat essentially stops and restarts\na service, keep in mind that some of these\n\n601\n00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:59.410\nservices have to be running in order for\napplications to work.\n\n602\n00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:02.620\nNow, just when we think we've\nhad enough of the services,\n\n603\n00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:04.300\nit goes a little bit farther.\n\n604\n00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:09.090\nSome services need other services\nto be able to run, all right?\n\n605\n00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:11.290\nAnd that's where this\nDependencies tab comes in.\n\n606\n00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:14.710\nDependencies, if we go to\nthis Dependencies tab,\n\n607\n00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:18.820\nmeans that some services require\nthe Print Spooler service.\n\n608\n00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.760\nIn order for them to function.\n\n609\n00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:24.360\nHowever, in certain\ncases the print spooler\n\n610\n00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:27.430\nrelies on a service to\nbe able to do its job.\n\n611\n00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:28.380\nAnd you can see right here.\n\n612\n00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:31.530\nNotice this service depends on\nthe following system components?\n\n613\n00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:33.880\nWell, I can tell you this RPC,\n\n614\n00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:37.230\neverything in windows depends\nupon remote procedure call.\n\n615\n00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:41.020\nIn fact, you can't even stop this\nprocedure it's so important, all right.\n\n616\n00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:45.180\nBut however, if I decided that I\nwanted to launch the fax service,\n\n617\n00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:47.980\nmaybe I'm sending a fax in Windows,\nI don't know if we do that any more, but\n\n618\n00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:50.210\nmaybe we're going to send a fax,\nall right?\n\n619\n00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:56.100\nWell, I have to have the print server\nservice running in order for fax to run.\n\n620\n00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:59.730\nAll right, so\nkeep in mind that we have Dependencies and\n\n621\n00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:05.020\nyou can end up having a service chain\nthat's broken because one service that\n\n622\n00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:08.550\nIs basically the staple for\nall other services has turned off.\n\n623\n00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:12.480\nIf you need to find that out, if you need\nto find out that a supplier service isn't\n\n624\n00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:16.210\nrunning, use your services console,\nuse your dependencies tab.\n\n625\n00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:19.430\nFind out if another service has caused\nthis one to fail or vice versa.\n\n626\n00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:23.290\nAnd it's a great way that you can\nkeep these process managed and\n\n627\n00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:24.970\nmaintained on your system.\n\n628\n00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:26.840\nAnd you got a few different\nways that you can do that.\n\n629\n00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:30.590\nSo, definitely get in here, know a few\ndifferent ways to get into your services.\n\n630\n00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:34.230\nKnow about your firewall,\nknow about some of these commonalities.\n\n631\n00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:37.810\nDo not turn your anti-virus software off,\nkeep it up to date.\n\n632\n00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:42.160\nAnd make sure, above all else,\nthat you are using it.\n\n633\n00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.540\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, thank you again for\n\n634\n00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:48.180\nshowing us this idea of taking a look\nat the antivirus and the anti-malware,\n\n635\n00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:51.820\nand some of these services that we\nactually have to understand and know.\n\n636\n00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:56.280\nRemember, if you're going to be supporting\nregular desktop computers, you need to at\n\n637\n00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:59.550\nleast know where some of these settings\nare and you need to be familiar with them.\n\n638\n00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:02.090\nSo, get in there, make sure you do\nunderstand where they're going to be\n\n639\n00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:04.940\nlocated and\nwhat they actually end up doing.\n\n640\n00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:07.790\nSo this is a great place for\nus to also end this episode.\n\n641\n00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:11.220\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronny

right good morning,\ngood afternoon, and good evening, and\n\n5\n00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:39,671\nwelcome back to another episode of ITProTV\nI'm your host Don Pezet, back with Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:39,671 --> 00:00:41,307\nRonnie Wong, how's it going Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:42,700\n>> It is going great.\n\n8\n00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,469\nHad a good lunch, ready to get started\ninto our Microsoft Technical Associate and\n\n9\n00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,089\nready to get started into files and\nfolders I believe is where we're heading.\n\n10\n00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:53,480\n>> You know when it comes to IT learning\nthere is no substitute to a full stomach.\n\n11\n00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,450\n>> That's true.\n>> So let's dive right in,\n\n12\n00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,582\nwe're diving back into the world of MTA,\nright?\n\n13\n00:00:58,582 --> 00:01:02,600\nThe Microsoft Technical Associate and in\nparticular, operating system fundamentals.\n\n14\n00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,240\nToday's objective is managing files and\nfolders and so we're gonna take a look\n\n15\n00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,881\nat the file system inside of Windows and\nsome of the different tricks of the trade\n\n16\n00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:15,569\nthat we need to remember as we\ndeal with storing files locally.\n\n17\n00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:18,050\nAnd we talk a little bit\nabout networking too and, and\n\n18\n00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,581\nwe even go a little bit into printers so\nit's a little more than just files and\n\n19\n00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,754\nfolders, but\nit's still good stuff to know.\n\n20\n00:01:23,754 --> 00:01:26,046\nSo time to dive right in.\n\n21\n00:01:26,046 --> 00:01:28,792\n>> Speaking of files then.\n\n22\n00:01:28,792 --> 00:01:32,520\nWhen we store things on hard drives\nwe don't just get to put files onto\n\n23\n00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,620\nhard drives and then expect that\nwe're gonna be able to find them.\n\n24\n00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,560\nWhat we have to have first on\nthe hard drive to be able to do this\n\n25\n00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,240\nis a structure.\n\n26\n00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,180\nSo that we can go back and retrieve\nthe information a little bit later on.\n\n27\n00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,440\nThe operating system works based\noff of some file system that we\n\n28\n00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,720\nput on the hard drive, so it knows how\nto go back and find those locations.\n\n29\n00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,550\nThere's really been three specific\nfile systems that WIndows has\n\n30\n00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,730\ntraditionally used.\n\n31\n00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,840\nThe earliest one is what we call FAT,\nwhich doesn't really stand for fat.\n\n32\n00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,431\nIt stands for file allocation table.\n\n33\n00:02:01,431 --> 00:02:04,508\nAnd then a one a little bit later for\nFAT32, and\n\n34\n00:02:04,508 --> 00:02:07,972\nthen the one we're still\nusing today one called NTFS.\n\n35\n00:02:07,972 --> 00:02:12,033\n>> Yeah, and the key thing to remember\nwith each of these is that there's pros\n\n36\n00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:13,073\nand cons, right?\n\n37\n00:02:13,073 --> 00:02:17,790\nThere's some good reason, some bad reasons\nto use the different file systems.\n\n38\n00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,210\nWhen you have a hard drive in your\ncomputer, if you buy your computer and\n\n39\n00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,240\nit's all ready got Windows on it, whoever\nthe manufacturer is has probably already\n\n40\n00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,560\nchosen what file system\nyou're going to use.\n\n41\n00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,640\nBut, if you're adding a hard drive\nto your system, you get to pick.\n\n42\n00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,220\nAll right?\n\n43\n00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,298\nSo, which one do we wanna pick and why?\n\n44\n00:02:34,298 --> 00:02:36,545\nWell, we'll find that there's\nreally one clear winner.\n\n45\n00:02:36,545 --> 00:02:40,305\nBut there are a few different choices that\nwe might go through and there's even more.\n\n46\n00:02:40,305 --> 00:02:43,569\nBut, the ones that Microsoft is really\nconcerned about Are the ones that Ronnie\n\n47\n00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:44,454\nmentioned, right?\n\n48\n00:02:44,454 --> 00:02:47,582\nFAT16, FAT32, and NTFS.\n\n49\n00:02:47,582 --> 00:02:50,183\nNow, I said FAT16.\n\n50\n00:02:50,183 --> 00:02:50,830\n>> Yeah.\n>> But\n\n51\n00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,327\nmost people do just call that one FAT,\nso either word for it will work.\n\n52\n00:02:54,327 --> 00:02:56,640\nBut let's start with that one, right.\n\n53\n00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,570\nFAT, file allocation table,\nthat is the oldest of the three.\n\n54\n00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,170\nAnd as a result,\n\n55\n00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,870\nit has certain limitations that\nour newer file systems don't have.\n\n56\n00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:10,380\nSo when adding a new hard drive today,\nI really can't think of a scenario where\n\n57\n00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:15,240\nyou'd want to do just a FAT16,\na regular file allocation table format.\n\n58\n00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,419\nThe main problems with it,\n\n59\n00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:22,073\nit can only handle partitions\nup to two gigabytes in size.\n\n60\n00:03:22,073 --> 00:03:25,429\nWell, in today's world,\nwhen you buy a hard drive, you know,\n\n61\n00:03:25,429 --> 00:03:28,786\nyou're probably gonna have\na 250 gig hard drive, a 500,\n\n62\n00:03:28,786 --> 00:03:32,905\na terabyte drive FAT16 was not designed\nto handle file systems of that size.\n\n63\n00:03:32,905 --> 00:03:34,455\nIt just wasn't.\n\n64\n00:03:35,645 --> 00:03:40,765\nEven within that, if we had a hard drive\nthat was two gigs in size, the files\n\n65\n00:03:40,765 --> 00:03:44,670\nwe created in it were held to that same\nlimit, so you couldn't store files\n\n66\n00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,920\nthat were over two gigs in size either,\ncuz there just wasn't enough room for it.\n\n67\n00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,740\nSo if you have today a lot of videos,\nmovies, anything like\n\n68\n00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,930\nthat it can easily exceed 2 gigs in size,\nand FAT16 just couldn't store it.\n\n69\n00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,505\nSo back in the 1980s and\neven the early 1990s FAT16 was fine but\n\n70\n00:04:02,505 --> 00:04:07,756\nin today's world it really doesn't have\na place so you shouldn't use it anymore.\n\n71\n00:04:07,756 --> 00:04:11,281\n>> The next step in the file systems\nthat we see is actually moving up\n\n72\n00:04:11,281 --> 00:04:15,419\nfrom that original file allocation table,\nto one that they call FAT32.\n\n73\n00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:18,836\nRemember that it actually stands for\nfile allocation table and\n\n74\n00:04:18,836 --> 00:04:20,585\nthey actually add in that 32.\n\n75\n00:04:20,585 --> 00:04:24,410\nThis is where hard drives\nstarted getting larger, and\n\n76\n00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,500\nfile sizes started getting larger too\n>> Now when you have\n\n77\n00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,440\nfile sizes that are more\nthan two gigs in size,\n\n78\n00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,178\nwell the original FAT, you wouldn't be\nable to store those on a single partition.\n\n79\n00:04:36,178 --> 00:04:42,350\nSo FAT 2 was an alternative or a successor\nto allow us to take hard drives and\n\n80\n00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:47,530\nactually make, well partitions that\nwere larger than that two gigabytes.\n\n81\n00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:52,318\nSo, normally with FAT32 you can have\na maximum partition size of about 32 gigs.\n\n82\n00:04:52,318 --> 00:04:56,422\nAll sizes now could be up\nto about four gigabytes.\n\n83\n00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:59,173\nSo a single file could\nbe up to four gigabytes.\n\n84\n00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:02,146\nEven though we have hard\ndrives that are much larger,\n\n85\n00:05:02,146 --> 00:05:06,924\nwe still end up finding that there's a lot\nof devices that are still running FAT32.\n\n86\n00:05:06,924 --> 00:05:10,499\nThings like our micro SD cards, and\na lot of times when you buy just\n\n87\n00:05:10,499 --> 00:05:14,336\na regular USB thumb drive they're\nnormally formatted with FAT32.\n\n88\n00:05:14,336 --> 00:05:19,474\n>> Yeah, and the main reason we see that\nis FAT32 has been around a long time and\n\n89\n00:05:19,474 --> 00:05:22,809\na lot of vendors or\noperating systems support it.\n\n90\n00:05:22,809 --> 00:05:27,036\nSo if you've got a Windows machine,\nor a Linux machine, or\n\n91\n00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:30,262\na MAC OS machine, they can all read FAT32.\n\n92\n00:05:30,262 --> 00:05:33,818\nIt's really one of the only file\nsystems you can choose today,\n\n93\n00:05:33,818 --> 00:05:36,430\nthat every operating system supports.\n\n94\n00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:40,950\nSo, memory cards, USB thumb sticks, things\nyou might be moving between devices.\n\n95\n00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:44,409\nIt makes sense to go ahead and do FAT32 on\nthose because you know you'll be able to\n\n96\n00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:46,377\nget those photos, or\nwhatever it is you need.\n\n97\n00:05:46,377 --> 00:05:51,369\nAnd handling a file size of up to\nfour gigabytes that's pretty big.\n\n98\n00:05:51,369 --> 00:05:55,329\nMost movies and things you're gonna fit\nunder that size, maybe not blu-ray discs,\n\n99\n00:05:55,329 --> 00:05:56,264\nor whatever right,\n\n100\n00:05:56,264 --> 00:05:59,619\nthey'll be bigger, but even DVDs for\nthe most part are below four gigs.\n\n101\n00:05:59,619 --> 00:06:02,636\nAnd with a partition size\nof up to 32 gigs, well,\n\n102\n00:06:02,636 --> 00:06:06,436\nif you've got a 32 gigabyte SD card,\nit's perfect, right?\n\n103\n00:06:06,436 --> 00:06:07,016\nIt works out.\n\n104\n00:06:07,016 --> 00:06:12,695\nIf you've got a larger SD card,\nthough, FAT32 can't handle that.\n\n105\n00:06:12,695 --> 00:06:15,963\nSo you end up having to make more more\nthan one partition dividing the SD card up\n\n106\n00:06:15,963 --> 00:06:16,583\ninto pieces.\n\n107\n00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:20,735\nOr go with a different file system.\n\n108\n00:06:20,735 --> 00:06:24,500\nSo this is going to impact us because\nthe next one is the newest one and\n\n109\n00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,420\nit's the one that most\nWindows systems default to.\n\n110\n00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,603\nAnd it's called NTFS.\n\n111\n00:06:29,603 --> 00:06:32,209\nAnd it stands for\nthe new technology file system.\n\n112\n00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:35,518\nNTFS breaks all the rules.\n\n113\n00:06:35,518 --> 00:06:39,766\nIt can handle very, very large partitions\nand very, very large file system or,\n\n114\n00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:40,460\nfile sizes.\n\n115\n00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:45,292\nAll right, the partition can be\nup to 256 terabytes in size,\n\n116\n00:06:45,292 --> 00:06:48,434\nthat's big even by today's standards.\n\n117\n00:06:48,434 --> 00:06:53,319\nAnd it can handle an individual file\nsize bigger than four gigabytes without\n\n118\n00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,169\ncomplaint.\n\n119\n00:06:54,169 --> 00:07:00,220\nI've done 30, 40, 100 gig files,\nno problems on a NTFS partition at all.\n\n120\n00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,860\nI think the actual theoretical file size\nlimit is something in the petabyte range.\n\n121\n00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,230\nIt's really massive.\n\n122\n00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,864\nSo they've kinda killed\noff that limitation.\n\n123\n00:07:06,864 --> 00:07:10,829\nSo It goes without saying that this is\nkind of the best of the three options.\n\n124\n00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:12,940\nRight?\nWe always want to use it.\n\n125\n00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,690\nWell, the problem is NTFS\nis Microsoft proprietary.\n\n126\n00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,700\nSo, when you're dealing\nwith Linux systems or\n\n127\n00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:23,930\nMac OS systems,\na lot of them can read from an NTFS drive.\n\n128\n00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,880\nBut, they can't write to it.\n\n129\n00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:31,230\nAnd so now you've got a file format\nthat's not compatible with other vendors.\n\n130\n00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:34,120\nIf you are an all Windows shop,\nthen it doesn't matter, right.\n\n131\n00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,080\nYou just go NTFS everywhere you can and\nthat works out great but if you are doing\n\n132\n00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,480\nmixed operating systems, you start\nto bump into some problems there.\n\n133\n00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,480\nAnd that is why FAT32 has stuck around.\n\n134\n00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,951\nNow the exam objectives don't mention it\nbut there is another file system that's\n\n135\n00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:53,766\ngaining traction called ex FAT or exFAT,\nthat's the extended file allocation table.\n\n136\n00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:58,363\nAnd what it does is it takes FAT32 and it\nimproves it, adding large file support and\n\n137\n00:07:58,363 --> 00:08:01,910\nlarge partition support to\nkinda resolve those issues.\n\n138\n00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,830\nSo you'll see a lot of systems\nmaking use of exFAT now.\n\n139\n00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:09,110\nAnd Mac OS, Linux and Windows can all\nread and write to exFAT just fine so\n\n140\n00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,710\nit gives you that compatibility.\n\n141\n00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:15,510\nSo with that in mind,\nwould not wanna use that instead of NTFS?\n\n142\n00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:19,370\nWell, we're going to show you some\nfeatures that NTFS has built into it,\n\n143\n00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,750\nthat exFAT doesn't.\n\n144\n00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,960\nAnd so there's things that are built\nin it that make it really ideal for\n\n145\n00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,940\nus to use it if you wanna\ntake advantage of it.\n\n146\n00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,850\nThe number one thing is surprisingly\nnot really mentioned in the And\n\n147\n00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,570\nthe permission so much, but\nit's called NTFS permissions.\n\n148\n00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:38,740\nWe can set file permissions on a file\nif it's stored on the NTFS drive, and\n\n149\n00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:45,020\nI can say for example that Ronnie can\nread the file but he can't write to it.\n\n150\n00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,610\nAnd I can do whatever I want to a file and\nJason or director over there,\n\n151\n00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,440\nhe can read the file and\nwrite through it, but he can't delete it.\n\n152\n00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,730\nWe can start to specify all sorts of\ninformation about how that file can\n\n153\n00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,930\nbe used.\n\n154\n00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,890\nNTFS is what let's us do that.\n\n155\n00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:05,230\nIf we go FAT32 or if we go exFAT,\nwe lose that permission function.\n\n156\n00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,120\nWe can either give somebody access\nto the file, or not and that's it.\n\n157\n00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,250\nWe can't tailor what they do to it.\n\n158\n00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,110\nSo there are various pros and\ncons of each but\n\n159\n00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,490\nyou'll find that NTFS is\ntypically the one you want.\n\n160\n00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:20,210\nIf you don't have a reason not to,\nyou should use NTFS.\n\n161\n00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,710\nThe only time you should\nuse one of the other guys,\n\n162\n00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,360\nis if you have a specific need.\n\n163\n00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,990\nMy hard drive is sitting\nhere besides my laptop.\n\n164\n00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,500\nI've got it formatted exFAT, and\n\n165\n00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,430\nthat's because I'm constantly\nmoving it between Windows and Mac.\n\n166\n00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:36,940\nSo I needed something that could work with\nboth systems that's why it's exFAT, right.\n\n167\n00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,580\nBut, the hard drive here for\nmy WIndows machine is NTFS.\n\n168\n00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,970\nIt's Windows and it's whats running on it.\n\n169\n00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,220\nI'm fine doing NTFS there.\n\n170\n00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,850\nSo you pick the right file system for\neach.\n\n171\n00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,590\n>> Yeah.\n\n172\n00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,860\nWith the file system choice that you have,\n\n173\n00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,010\nWindows 7 automatically, if you don't\nchoose a different file system,\n\n174\n00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:58,740\nwill install it by formatting your\nhard drive with NTFS anyways.\n\n175\n00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,400\nSo sometimes you can actually say,\nhey, I don't wanna do it that way,\n\n176\n00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,510\nbut today it's usually the only\nlogical choice that we have\n\n177\n00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:08,420\nbecause of the very fact that we have so\nbig hard drives to have.\n\n178\n00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,240\nYep.\n>> And let me show\n\n179\n00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,230\nthem an example, Ronnie.\n\n180\n00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,670\nI've got my Windows 7 machine here and\n\n181\n00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:16,020\nI've got an extra hard drive added into\nit that I haven't messed with yet.\n\n182\n00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,280\nSo I'm gonna Take a look at that and what\nI'm doing here, is I'm just bringing up my\n\n183\n00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:25,430\nstart menu, and I'm right clicking where\nit says computer, and I'm choosing manage.\n\n184\n00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,730\nThat's gonna take me into\nthe computer management screen, and\n\n185\n00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,825\none of the tools in there\nis my Disk management.\n\n186\n00:10:30,825 --> 00:10:34,205\nAnd this is a neat utility cuz it\nlets you see your hard drive, and\n\n187\n00:10:34,205 --> 00:10:35,665\ndo things like formatting.\n\n188\n00:10:35,665 --> 00:10:39,315\nIt just detected my new hard drive, and\nit's asking if I want to initialize it,\n\n189\n00:10:39,315 --> 00:10:41,265\nthat means to get it ready for\nWindows to use.\n\n190\n00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,935\nI'll just say okay to that.\n\n191\n00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:44,865\nAnd so there's my new hard drive.\n\n192\n00:10:44,865 --> 00:10:48,715\nI've got a 64 gig hard drive and\nsee, how it says, un-allocated?\n\n193\n00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:51,730\nThat means I haven't formatted it,\nthere's no partition.\n\n194\n00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:56,930\nIf you look at this guy up here,\nmy C drive is 60 gigabytes in size,\n\n195\n00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,450\nand it's NTFS.\n\n196\n00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,190\nSo it's telling me that\none's already formatted,\n\n197\n00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,250\nit's got a drive letter, this one isn't.\n\n198\n00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,650\nI'm gonna create a new partition here.\n\n199\n00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,100\nSo I'm just gonna go and\nright-click on that empty drive and\n\n200\n00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,781\nchoose new simple volume.\n\n201\n00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:12,500\nAnd in this little wizard,\nit's gonna ask how big I want to make it,\n\n202\n00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,750\nnow I'm going to make\nit twenty gigs in size.\n\n203\n00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,042\nSo I'm gonna type it in here,\nthat's 20,000 megabytes is 20 gigabytes so\n\n204\n00:11:20,042 --> 00:11:22,032\nI'll just punch that in and hit next.\n\n205\n00:11:22,032 --> 00:11:27,010\nIt's gonna ask for a drive letter,\nI'll give it the E drive and\n\n206\n00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,150\nthen it's going to ask for the format.\n\n207\n00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,230\nNow in my format I have\na drop down list and\n\n208\n00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,420\nI see I can pick between NTFS and FAT32.\n\n209\n00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,230\nNow I don't see FAT16 as an option.\n\n210\n00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:37,920\nAnd that's because,\n\n211\n00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,750\nwell, Microsoft doesn't want us to do\nthat unless we have a specific need.\n\n212\n00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,590\nSo, I'm just gonna choose\nNTFS on this one and for\n\n213\n00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:48,830\nthe volume label, I'm just gonna\ntype NTFS on that one, all right.\n\n214\n00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:52,860\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nlet that one format and it'll build up.\n\n215\n00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,090\nNow, while it's doing that,\nI'm gonna create another partition.\n\n216\n00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,515\nSo that ones now healthy, 20 gigs NTFS.\n\n217\n00:11:58,515 --> 00:12:01,920\nAnd see how it's not 20 gigs anymore,\nnow it's 19.53.\n\n218\n00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,590\nEach of the file systems has\na little bit of overhead, and\n\n219\n00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:09,480\nthere's also this conversion\nthat happens where, sometimes it\n\n220\n00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,960\ncounts the size of the drive in bits,\nand sometimes it does it in bytes.\n\n221\n00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,430\nWhen it switches between bits, and bytes.\n\n222\n00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,790\nA byte is 8 bits,\n\n223\n00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:21,520\nwhen it does that sometimes the numbers\nstart to get a little different so\n\n224\n00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,740\ndon't be worried if you see a slightly\ndifferent size on that drive.\n\n225\n00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:30,890\nI'm gonna create another one and\nI'll do this one as 20 gigs also.\n\n226\n00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:35,920\nSo here's another 20 gig drive and\nI'll give this one the F drive, except\n\n227\n00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:41,302\nthis time I'm gonna pick FAT32 on this\none and I'll just call it FAT32, okay.\n\n228\n00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:45,100\nIt's a large drive which\nFAT32 is okay with but\n\n229\n00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,050\nI'm gonna hit that\nmaximum file size limit.\n\n230\n00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,840\nIt's gonna bump into that and\nbe a little angry if I try and\n\n231\n00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,810\nthrow anything big on there.\n\n232\n00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:55,570\nNow if I made a really small drive,\nlike if I did a new simple volume and\n\n233\n00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:59,120\nI'll just make this one, one gig in size.\n\n234\n00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,790\nSo a much smaller drive here.\n\n235\n00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,530\nI can give it a drive letter and\nas I move forward.\n\n236\n00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,820\nSee how fat all the sudden appeared?\n\n237\n00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,690\nI'm under the limit for fat and\nso now I get the option.\n\n238\n00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:15,460\nI can use the file allocation table and\nit'll be okay with that, right?\n\n239\n00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,710\nSo let me actually go back.\n\n240\n00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,610\nI wanna try and\nget as much space out of this as I can.\n\n241\n00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:23,060\nWhich I think is somewhere around There.\n\n242\n00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:26,120\nI have to leave a little bit off the end.\n\n243\n00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,040\nDo you think I can go all the way?\n\n244\n00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,660\nLet's see if Windows will let\nme go all the way to 2,048.\n\n245\n00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:34,670\nIt did, there we go.\n\n246\n00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,725\nSo this one is just gonna be a regular,\nold FAT.\n\n247\n00:13:36,725 --> 00:13:40,300\n[COUGH] It's a smaller drive and\nhere it's warning me saying,\n\n248\n00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,690\nthis partition will not be compatible\nwith previous versions of Windows\n\n249\n00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,830\nbecause the FAT system as in allocation,\nunit, size greater than 32K.\n\n250\n00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:52,410\nThere was this hardware size thing\nthat changed many years ago.\n\n251\n00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,620\nI, I wouldn't worry about that one.\n\n252\n00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,080\nIt says previous versions of Windows, it's\nreally talking about Windows 95 and 98,\n\n253\n00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,090\nI think we will be ok on that one.\n\n254\n00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:02,940\nSo we will go ahead and let that\nfinish and now I've got a fat drive.\n\n255\n00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:08,330\nAll right, so I just created three drives,\nan E, F and G drive.\n\n256\n00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:11,710\nAll with different file systems.\n\n257\n00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:15,120\nI can start copying files,\nto an end user they all look the same.\n\n258\n00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,520\nRight, to an end user,\neach one is trying to open here so\n\n259\n00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,280\nlet me just get out of that.\n\n260\n00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,380\nAlright, to an end user if they browse\ninto they're computer, they just see E,\n\n261\n00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,860\nF, G.\n\n262\n00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:31,000\nI know which one's NTFS, FAT32 and\nFAT because I named them that way.\n\n263\n00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,260\nBut if I give them a name like that,\nI have no idea that one was the other.\n\n264\n00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,020\nSo your end users don't see this.\n\n265\n00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,540\nWe have to choose correctly to account for\n\n266\n00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,610\nhow the end user is going to\nmake use of this, all right.\n\n267\n00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,060\nAnd it can be problematic for\n\n268\n00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:48,250\nus if we try and copy files to the system\nthat are too large or whatever\n\n269\n00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:52,480\nthen it's gonna give me issues about that\nor tell me that it's not compatible.\n\n270\n00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,810\nFor example, well FAT it's pretty small\nanyways, so it's not like I, if I try and\n\n271\n00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:01,500\ncopy anything larger than two gigabytes\nto it the drive isn't big enough anyway.\n\n272\n00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,180\nBut if I take something like FAT32 right.\n\n273\n00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:10,240\nSo, my FAT32 drive has a maximum\nfile size of 4 gigabytes, right.\n\n274\n00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,380\nSo if I try and copy a 4 gigabyte file\nto that, it'll be okay with it, right.\n\n275\n00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,480\nSo here,\nI'll take my Windows snap feature here.\n\n276\n00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,290\nI'm gonna try and use, oop,\nthat's not what I wanted.\n\n277\n00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,490\nWhy is Windows not snapping?\n\n278\n00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,470\nHave I broken the snap rules?\n\n279\n00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,250\n>> You must have.\n\n280\n00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,355\n>> I guess so.\nI didn't pay my Windows Snap bill.\n\n281\n00:15:29,355 --> 00:15:30,330\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n282\n00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,940\nwell we'll do it the old fashioned way.\n\n283\n00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,370\nThere we go.\nAll right, so\n\n284\n00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,330\nI've got my FAT32 drive\nover here on the left.\n\n285\n00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:40,334\nAnd on the right, I'm just going\nto browse into my hard drive, and\n\n286\n00:15:40,334 --> 00:15:44,851\nI've got a couple of files I made before\nthe show that are of various sizes.\n\n287\n00:15:44,851 --> 00:15:47,250\nAnd I guess it's kind of off\nthe screen here, let me.\n\n288\n00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,045\nRearrange these columns there.\n\n289\n00:15:50,045 --> 00:15:50,950\nAll right.\n\n290\n00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,650\nSo I've got a file [LAUGH], there.\n\n291\n00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:59,200\nI've got a file that is pretty much\nthe maximum size as the FAT16 can hold.\n\n292\n00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,420\nIt's about two gigs in size.\n\n293\n00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,870\nI've got one that's the maximum\nsize that FAT32 can handle,\n\n294\n00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:08,700\nit's just under four gigs in size,\nand I've got one that NTFS can\n\n295\n00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,880\nhandle that's larger than four gigs and\nNTFS maximum is way higher than that.\n\n296\n00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,470\nI just did six gigs to know\nthat I was covered, all right.\n\n297\n00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:20,180\nFor FAT 32, of I try and copy something\nlike this file right here right,\n\n298\n00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,480\nthis one that's almost two gigs, it's\nokay with that, it copies right over and\n\n299\n00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,120\nthere it is, it's happy.\n\n300\n00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,130\nAll right, and if I try and copy one of\nthe bigger ones like this 3.9 gig one,\n\n301\n00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,900\nwell it'll be fine with that one too.\n\n302\n00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:37,150\nI can copy it over and\nIn typical Windows fashion,\n\n303\n00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,210\nit gets right to the end and\nthen sits there forever.\n\n304\n00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:39,710\nThere we go.\n\n305\n00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,470\nSo I can copy that one over.\n\n306\n00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,490\nSame thing, perfectly happy with that.\n\n307\n00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:47,180\nNot violating any maximize size or\nanything.\n\n308\n00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,170\nIt's just gonna shoot right over.\n\n309\n00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:55,300\nBut that last file is really big,\nand FAT32 isn't going to like that.\n\n310\n00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,100\nSo if I take this NTFS file here and\ndrag it and copy it over.\n\n311\n00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,130\nThe file is too large for\nthe destination file system.\n\n312\n00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,080\nI can't do it.\n\n313\n00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:04,860\nAll right.\n\n314\n00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,840\nBecause I chose an older file system,\n\n315\n00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:12,020\nI traded maximum file size,\nfor compatibility.\n\n316\n00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,310\nYeah, I can take this drive and hook it up\nto a Mac or a Linux box, that'll read and\n\n317\n00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:18,430\nwrite into it just fine, but now my\nfiles have to be smaller than four gigs.\n\n318\n00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:23,050\nAll right, so that's the real trade off\nwe have when we pick a file system,\n\n319\n00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:26,380\nversus if I switch over to\nmy NTFS one that we made.\n\n320\n00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,780\nThis guy right here.\n\n321\n00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:32,140\nWell, I can take this six gig file and\ncopy it there,\n\n322\n00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,730\nand it's gonna shoot right over.\n\n323\n00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,330\nNo problem, there it goes.\n\n324\n00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:35,920\nAll right.\n\n325\n00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,930\nSo, that's one of the big deciding\nfactors we have to make when we pick\n\n326\n00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:39,970\nhow to format a drive.\n\n327\n00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,410\n>> Yeah.\n\n328\n00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,470\nWhen we take a look at the file system,\n\n329\n00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,910\nremember that NTFS is the one\nthat you're generally gonna see.\n\n330\n00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:49,540\nIn today's world,\nespecially with Windows 7 but\n\n331\n00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:54,170\nthere's other additional,\nfeatures or helps.\n\n332\n00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:57,000\nThat is a reason why we wanna choose NTFS.\n\n333\n00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,910\nSo not only do we have larger file sizes,\nbut we can talk also about what\n\n334\n00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:05,590\nyou had mentioned a little bit\nearlier about file permissions too.\n\n335\n00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,770\nAnd we can even talk about a couple of\n\n336\n00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,210\nother things that we're gonna\nsee throughout the show.\n\n337\n00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,610\n>> Yeah and, you know, I kinda mentioned\nthose a little bit earlier, the bells and\n\n338\n00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,470\nwhistles of NTFS.\n\n339\n00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,910\nLet's take a look at some of them, right?\n\n340\n00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,830\nMicrosoft calls out a ton of\nthem in the objectives, and\n\n341\n00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,550\nI kind of mentioned some all ready.\n\n342\n00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:22,050\nThings like file permissions, right?\n\n343\n00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,800\nWhen we do a file permission in NTFS,\nactually let's see.\n\n344\n00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,260\nI don't want to jump ahead of myself here.\n\n345\n00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,120\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Yep.\n\n346\n00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,530\n>> Permissions are next.\n\n347\n00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,760\nOkay.\nSo, [LAUGH] when we deal with\n\n348\n00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,700\nfile permissions,\n\n349\n00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,030\nthese are the things that help us to\nshare files out with other people.\n\n350\n00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:38,080\nNow, there's a difference between whether\nyou're sharing a file with somebody on\n\n351\n00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,160\nthe same computer as you.\n\n352\n00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,470\nOr if they're on the network, all right.\n\n353\n00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,640\nIf somebody's on the same computer as you,\n\n354\n00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,130\nlike maybe you, you share\na computer with your spouse, right?\n\n355\n00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:51,960\nWell, you both sit down and log in on the\nsame machine, not at the same time, right,\n\n356\n00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,940\nthere's only one keyboard.\n\n357\n00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,350\nSo one of you logs in and\nuses it, then you log out and\n\n358\n00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,880\nthe other person logs in and uses it,\n\n359\n00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,210\nwell, if you do that, what if you want\nto exchange files between each other?\n\n360\n00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,190\nWell, you can set permissions\non the file to do that.\n\n361\n00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,960\nOr if you don't want to exchange\nfiles between each other,\n\n362\n00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,690\nif you want to keep files private,\nyou can do that too.\n\n363\n00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,050\nDo the file permissions.\n\n364\n00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:13,820\nAnd all you have to do is pull up the\nproperties of a file on an NTFS drive and\n\n365\n00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,440\nyou'll see the options.\n\n366\n00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,200\nLet me show you guys that.\n\n367\n00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,320\nSo here's that NTFS drive.\n\n368\n00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,500\nAnd if pull up the properties of this\nlarge file that I just copied a moment\n\n369\n00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,070\nago, when I go into its properties.\n\n370\n00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,210\nI'll see a security tab.\n\n371\n00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:30,570\nAnd it's on that security tab that\nwe can define who has what access.\n\n372\n00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:37,590\nSo here I can see the users group has\nthe ability to read, and execute.\n\n373\n00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:41,500\nFirst is the authenticated users that\nhave the ability to modify, read, write,\n\n374\n00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,790\nthey can do all sorts of things,\nall right.\n\n375\n00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:47,140\nThese security permissions apply to\npeople who are sitting right here\n\n376\n00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,710\non this machine.\n\n377\n00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:52,010\nIf I take a look at that FAT32 drive,\nthough, and\n\n378\n00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:57,860\nI pull up the permissions on a file there,\nnotice how the security tab is gone.\n\n379\n00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,680\nFAT32 doesn't support\nfile level permissions.\n\n380\n00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,770\nIt's just not there.\n\n381\n00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:06,590\nSo, I can't restrict a file\nfrom one user or another.\n\n382\n00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:09,472\nOn the same machine using FAT 32.\n\n383\n00:20:09,472 --> 00:20:13,950\nSo, that doesn't mean we\ncan't do any permissions.\n\n384\n00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,920\nIt just means we can't do permissions\nright here on our own system.\n\n385\n00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,590\nWhen you're accessing\nfiles over the network,\n\n386\n00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,630\nyour network users don't\nsee the file system.\n\n387\n00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:25,140\nThey see the network, so\nthey don't know if it's FAT32 or NTFS.\n\n388\n00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,048\nSo Microsoft created a different\nset of permissions for that.\n\n389\n00:20:28,048 --> 00:20:33,250\nIf you're gonna send share files across\nthe network well there you can set what\n\n390\n00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:38,160\nare called share permissions, and share\npermissions apply regardless of whether\n\n391\n00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,680\nit's FAT22 or NTFS but they only apply\nto people coming in over the network.\n\n392\n00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:47,200\nSo, just a quick example of that,\nif I take a look at my C-drive,\n\n393\n00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:53,460\nI've go this folder called Business\nDocs And if I pull up its properties and\n\n394\n00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:59,130\ngo to its sharing tab I'll see that\nthis one is shared out right now as\n\n395\n00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:03,820\nJD desktop slash Business Docs and\nif I go to advanced sharing.\n\n396\n00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,570\nI can then pull up the permissions,\nand I'll see the permissions.\n\n397\n00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:11,330\nRight now I've given\neverybody full control, but\n\n398\n00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,790\nyou can specify that very particularly.\n\n399\n00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:16,470\nYou can list certain people,\ngive them read, full control change,\n\n400\n00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,000\nwhatever it is that you\nwanted them to have.\n\n401\n00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,670\nYou would just specify it all right there.\n\n402\n00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,320\n>> The main advantage of using\nthe Share Permission, of course,\n\n403\n00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,840\nis only when people are trying to access\nyour computer from a different computer.\n\n404\n00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,720\nWhen you're both just sharing that one\ncomputer, only the NTFS permissions\n\n405\n00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,670\nare gonna apply, but when you're\nsitting on another computer and\n\n406\n00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,540\nyou're trying to get access\nto the Business Docs here,\n\n407\n00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,840\nyou're not going to deal with both of\nthose different permission levels.\n\n408\n00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,400\n>> And these permissions\ndon't just apply to files.\n\n409\n00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,910\nYou might be sharing\na printer on your network.\n\n410\n00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,460\nSo, for example, on this computer\nI've got a printer set up.\n\n411\n00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,082\nLet me get to my printers.\n\n412\n00:21:51,082 --> 00:21:54,280\nI'm gonna pull up my start menu and\ngo to Devices and Printers.\n\n413\n00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:59,940\nAnd you'll see in here that I've got\na printer, a Lexmark [LAUGH] 8323.\n\n414\n00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,890\nAnd it's got a little icon\nwith two people on it.\n\n415\n00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:04,380\nThat's what lets me know that this\nis shared now, on the network.\n\n416\n00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,260\nA network could browse and\nfind this printer.\n\n417\n00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:14,340\nAnd, if I right-click on it, and\ngo to my printing preferences, oh, no.\n\n418\n00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:14,980\nSorry.\n>> Properties.\n\n419\n00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,820\n>> Printer properties.\n\n420\n00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,910\nThat's what I want.\n\n421\n00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:17,850\nPrinter properties.\n\n422\n00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,050\nThere we go.\n\n423\n00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:23,630\nI can see a sharing tab and I can see\nthat it is share out, it's shared out and\n\n424\n00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,800\nit's named Lexmark E323.\n\n425\n00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,830\nAnd if I go in to change sharing options,\n\n426\n00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:34,510\nI'll have the ability to stop that and\nstop it from sharing if I don't want it.\n\n427\n00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:38,980\nAnd if I go over to security,\nhere I can start to add people in and\n\n428\n00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,642\ntailor whether they're allowed to print or\nnot.\n\n429\n00:22:41,642 --> 00:22:43,960\nAll right, now a printer is not a file.\n\n430\n00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,410\nRight so this isn't NTFS or\nFAT32 or anything like that.\n\n431\n00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,220\nThis is just a printer.\n\n432\n00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,820\nSo those share permissions come\ninto play in more than one place.\n\n433\n00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:57,800\nAll right, now Microsoft now really does\nstress one important concept we need to\n\n434\n00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,740\nunderstand which is users\nwhen they access a file,\n\n435\n00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,801\nthey end up with that's something called\nan effective permission, all right.\n\n436\n00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,050\nWhat is an effective permission?\n\n437\n00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:10,800\nWell, when I access a file,\nif I'm sitting right at\n\n438\n00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:16,220\nthat computer the only permissions that\napply are the NTFS, the file permissions.\n\n439\n00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,630\nSo, if I went in there and\n\n440\n00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:21,330\nI set NTFS permission on the file\nitself that would take effect.\n\n441\n00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:21,830\nAnd that's it.\n\n442\n00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:25,470\nBut if I come in over the network.\n\n443\n00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:30,620\nWhen I come in over the network\nthe share permissions apply and\n\n444\n00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,750\nthe NTFS permissions apply.\n\n445\n00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,900\nThey both apply.\n\n446\n00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,050\nSo there's two different\nsets of permissions.\n\n447\n00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:41,973\nWhat Microsoft is referring to with\neffective permissions is what happens when\n\n448\n00:23:41,973 --> 00:23:44,058\nthere's a conflict between the two.\n\n449\n00:23:44,058 --> 00:23:45,519\nLet me show you an example here.\n\n450\n00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:49,680\nIf I take my business docs folder,\nall right.\n\n451\n00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,920\nAnd I'm gonna go into the securities.\n\n452\n00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,400\nSo this is the NTFS side.\n\n453\n00:23:54,490 --> 00:24:00,230\nSo on the NTFS side, on the file system\nside, I'm gonna add in Jane Doe.\n\n454\n00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,840\nAll right.\nSo, we're just going to add in\n\n455\n00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,440\nJane Doe, here.\n\n456\n00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,790\nAnd I'm gonna give Jane, full control.\n\n457\n00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:12,430\nThat means she has total access to\nthe entire business docs folder.\n\n458\n00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,300\nShe can do whatever she wants in there.\n\n459\n00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,400\nAll right.\n\n460\n00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,120\nAnd when I say okay,\nthat now takes effect,\n\n461\n00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,980\nshe has full access, at the NTFS level.\n\n462\n00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,800\nOn the file system.\n\n463\n00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:27,180\nIf she sits down at this computer,\nthat's all that takes effect.\n\n464\n00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,670\nThat right there,\nshe'll have total access.\n\n465\n00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:34,110\nNow, I'm gonna go to my sharing tab,\nand into advanced sharing.\n\n466\n00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:41,970\nAnd permissions and I'm gonna add\nin Jane Doe here also, right.\n\n467\n00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:42,630\nSo there's Jane Doe.\n\n468\n00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:48,631\nAnd this time I'm gonna\ngive Jane just read access,\n\n469\n00:24:48,631 --> 00:24:52,735\nand I'm going to deny her,\nchange and full control.\n\n470\n00:24:52,735 --> 00:24:53,675\nI'm just gonna give her,\n\n471\n00:24:53,675 --> 00:24:56,825\nwell, nope let me do that-\n>> Yeah.\n\n472\n00:24:56,825 --> 00:24:58,485\n>> Oh, because of the-\n>> Right.\n\n473\n00:24:58,485 --> 00:25:00,115\n>> Shoot, I'll just deny her everything.\n\n474\n00:25:00,115 --> 00:25:02,395\nSo, I'm gonna deny Jane everything.\n\n475\n00:25:02,395 --> 00:25:07,565\nAt the NTFS level, Jane had full control,\nbut here at the share level,\n\n476\n00:25:07,565 --> 00:25:12,190\nI've denied her everything,\nno full control, no change, no read.\n\n477\n00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,250\nShe gets nothing.\n\n478\n00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,420\nNow that's a conflict.\n\n479\n00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,530\nIt's the two opposite\nends of the spectrum.\n\n480\n00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,950\nThis is just warning me\nabout my deny there.\n\n481\n00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,200\nI'll say yes to that.\n\n482\n00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,420\nIt's telling me, Don,\nyou're doing something kind of dumb.\n\n483\n00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,740\nAre you sure this is what you want?\n\n484\n00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,370\nSo, now we've got\nan argument between the two.\n\n485\n00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:29,100\nAt the file system,\nit says she gets everything.\n\n486\n00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,060\nAt the shell, it says she gets nothing.\n\n487\n00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,150\nWhat does she get,\nwhat is her effective permissions?\n\n488\n00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:38,580\n>> The overall effect of\npermissions when accessing\n\n489\n00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:44,610\nthis business documents folder from\nanother machine on the network\n\n490\n00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:48,310\nis actually going to be the most\nrestrictive of those two.\n\n491\n00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:50,780\nSo even though NTFS gives Jane Doe.\n\n492\n00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:55,840\nFull control, these particular shared\npermissions here says that she's denied,\n\n493\n00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,800\nwhile the most restrictive of\nthose two is gonna be denied so\n\n494\n00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:04,290\nJane Doe will not go to access the\nbusiness docs folder from another machine.\n\n495\n00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:06,760\n>> Yep when there's\na conflict between NTFS and\n\n496\n00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:12,350\nshared permissions you get the most\nrestrictive, you get the least of the two.\n\n497\n00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:15,060\nAll right, and\nthat's your effective permission.\n\n498\n00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,100\nAt the end of the day,\nthat's what you end up with.\n\n499\n00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,550\nAnd users can get\npermissions various ways.\n\n500\n00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:23,290\nIn some of the MCSA shows we covered\nin a lot of depths where we talk about\n\n501\n00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,320\nhow you can put users into groups and\nthey can get permissions based on what\n\n502\n00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,210\ngroup they're in, and so\nall that has to kind of congeal,\n\n503\n00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:32,610\nit's all gotta average together\ninto a full set of permissions.\n\n504\n00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:37,540\nBut when it comes to share permissions\nversus MTFS, you get the most restrictive.\n\n505\n00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,590\nBut do remember that if Jane comes and\n\n506\n00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:44,020\nsits down right on this computer and\nlogs in, share permissions don't apply.\n\n507\n00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,780\nThey don't apply to you when\nyou're sitting at the machine.\n\n508\n00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:50,210\nAnd so she would have full control\nwhen she's sitting at the computer.\n\n509\n00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:53,570\nBut if she goes to another computer and\ntries to come in via the network,\n\n510\n00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,840\nthe share permissions do apply and\nshe wouldn't have any access.\n\n511\n00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,520\nAll right.\n\n512\n00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,280\nSo that's what I've done here is,\nI've effectively limited her\n\n513\n00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,990\nto only being able to get those documents\nwhen she sits right at this computer.\n\n514\n00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:09,760\n>> Now Don, I saw when you shared out\nthat folder it kind of had a strange way\n\n515\n00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,060\nthat it named it.\n\n516\n00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,140\nWhat is that?\nBackslash backslash and\n\n517\n00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,490\nthe name of the computer.\n\n518\n00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:17,260\nAnd then looks like the name\nof the folder there.\n\n519\n00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:21,930\nAnd when we try to access a shared\nfolder from across the network,\n\n520\n00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:25,110\nwe have a couple of different options for\nus to be able to do that.\n\n521\n00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,490\nAnd one of the ways, of course,\n\n522\n00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:31,750\nis using that bigger syntax to be able\nto access that folder by doing that.\n\n523\n00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,420\nAnother way is also creating\na mapped networked drive.\n\n524\n00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,080\n>> Now when you access a network resource,\nlike a file or a folder,\n\n525\n00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,300\nthat's out there, you're normally\ngoing to browse to go and find it.\n\n526\n00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:44,940\nIf you know the name of the computer that\nhas the data you want, you can type it in\n\n527\n00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:48,420\nby typing, you know, basically bringing\nup your start menu and in the search\n\n528\n00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,360\nbox you can type in backslash,\nbackslash, and the name of the computer.\n\n529\n00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,260\nRight.\nSo if you know it, you can do it.\n\n530\n00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:56,750\nThat's called using the net bios\nname is what that's called.\n\n531\n00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,270\nAn easier way though is to just\nfire up windows explorer and\n\n532\n00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,430\nlet me show you most users will do it.\n\n533\n00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,820\nIs we fire up our Windows explorer.\n\n534\n00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,990\nAnd I'll start from scratch here.\n\n535\n00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:08,640\nSo that's just the little yellow\nfolder down here in our task bar.\n\n536\n00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,690\nAnd on the left side you'll\nsee where you have network.\n\n537\n00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:14,060\nAnd when you choose network your\ncomputer will scan the network and\n\n538\n00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,980\nshow all the other computers\nthat are out there.\n\n539\n00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,340\nAnd so you can find a computer and\ndouble click on it and\n\n540\n00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,820\nit'll show the things that are shared out.\n\n541\n00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:27,330\nSo I see that Lexmark E323,\nI see business docs, I see it right there.\n\n542\n00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,260\nAnd see how the name is written up here?\n\n543\n00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,440\nNetwork and then an arrow,\nJD desktop and so on.\n\n544\n00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,520\nIf I click up in the bar,\nsee how it changed it, and\n\n545\n00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,370\nnow it's backslash, backslash, JD Desktop.\n\n546\n00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,130\nAll right.\n\n547\n00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:43,000\nAnd, if I browsed into business docs,\nand I click.\n\n548\n00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,510\nThere's that same name they\njust showed in that screen.\n\n549\n00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,580\nSo, that's what that name is referring to.\n\n550\n00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:52,370\nI could have gone straight to it,\nby just typing in my search box backslash,\n\n551\n00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:56,560\nbackslash JD desktop and\nit's gonna reach out and try and\n\n552\n00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,850\nconnect to that machine and display\nthe list right here, sometimes it takes\n\n553\n00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,890\na moment, mine's apparently taking\na long moment and I'm impatient so\n\n554\n00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:06,620\nI'm just going to hit enter and\nthen I'll browse and pull it right up so.\n\n555\n00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,960\nThat's an easy way to build a browser and\nconnect to these.\n\n556\n00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,360\nRonnie, you mentioned a mapped drive.\n\n557\n00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,770\nIf I know I'm going to be using\nthese business docs all the time,\n\n558\n00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:15,560\nI can right click on them and\n\n559\n00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:20,260\nchoose map a network drive and that's\nwhere we assign a drive letter to this.\n\n560\n00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,650\nSo instead of having to browse\nthe network I can come in and\n\n561\n00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:26,520\nI can say this is my b drive,\nb for business.\n\n562\n00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,630\nThat's where my business docs are.\n\n563\n00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:32,120\nI want it to reconnect at log-in so\nI've always got this available.\n\n564\n00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:37,850\nI'll hit finish and now,\nwhenever I fire-up Windows Explorer,\n\n565\n00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:42,860\nI've got a c-drive,\nthat's my local hard drive.\n\n566\n00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,730\nAnd now I've got a B drive.\n\n567\n00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:47,050\nThat's where my business docs are.\n\n568\n00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:49,220\nAnd I can browse in there and\nget at my business docs.\n\n569\n00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:54,910\nSo, pretty easy to get those network\nresources set up and available for us.\n\n570\n00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:58,410\nI know we talked about a home\ngroup in another episode,\n\n571\n00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,160\nbut we'll take a lot at that too.\n\n572\n00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,860\nBut, looking at the clock, we're\na little short on time on this segment.\n\n573\n00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,900\nSo, let's tackle that after the break.\n\n574\n00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:11,435\nStay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n575\n00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:16,959\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n576\n00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:20,531\nSo, we left off talking about\nsharing content between systems and\n\n577\n00:30:20,531 --> 00:30:24,460\nwe've got a few other little\nbits to talk about with sharing.\n\n578\n00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,430\nOne of the problems with sharing in\nprevious versions of Windows was that it\n\n579\n00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,910\nwas kind of annoying to set up.\n\n580\n00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:33,250\nAnd if you were an IT worker,\nit was pretty easy,\n\n581\n00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,120\nI suppose,\nyou know cuz we knew what to do.\n\n582\n00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,130\nBut if you were a regular end-user,\n\n583\n00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:40,155\nthis whole idea of NTFS permissions and\nshared permissions and\n\n584\n00:30:40,155 --> 00:30:43,875\nall these weird different places to go and\nset things, really which is not easy.\n\n585\n00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:47,515\nAnd so sharing has in the past,\njust not been an easy thing.\n\n586\n00:30:47,515 --> 00:30:50,717\nWell, they work to fix that\nin Windows Vista and into.\n\n587\n00:30:50,717 --> 00:30:55,557\nTurn in Windows 7 by introducing\nsomething called a Windows home group.\n\n588\n00:30:55,557 --> 00:31:00,767\nAnd a home group is a really easy way to\nconnect different systems together and\n\n589\n00:31:00,767 --> 00:31:04,410\nautomatically share\nresources on the network.\n\n590\n00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:07,760\n>> Where as before, you'd have to make\nsure that your printer was ready, and\n\n591\n00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,340\nyour computers were ready.\n\n592\n00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,140\nConnect them to devices.\n\n593\n00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,380\nMake sure that they could communicate.\n\n594\n00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,100\nCreate our shared folders\nlike we did before.\n\n595\n00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,340\nToday, by using that\nhome grouped technology,\n\n596\n00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:22,860\nthat's built into Windows 7 All we\nneed is actually just a password.\n\n597\n00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,700\nWith that password we\nconnect those machines up and\n\n598\n00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,770\nthey're ready to show printers and files.\n\n599\n00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:32,699\n>> Now setting up a home group couldn't\nbe easier when you plug in a network\n\n600\n00:31:32,699 --> 00:31:34,598\ncable into a Windows 7 machine for\n\n601\n00:31:34,598 --> 00:31:38,216\nthe first time, it will ask you\nwhat type of a network you're on.\n\n602\n00:31:38,216 --> 00:31:43,665\nAre you on a home network,\na work network, or a public network?\n\n603\n00:31:43,665 --> 00:31:45,048\nA public network.\n\n604\n00:31:45,048 --> 00:31:48,136\nThat's going to be one like Starbucks,\nor a hotel.\n\n605\n00:31:48,136 --> 00:31:49,918\nYou're on a shared network.\n\n606\n00:31:49,918 --> 00:31:52,830\nYou don't wanna share stuff with\nthe strangers in one of those places.\n\n607\n00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:56,410\nSo, when you choose Public, it basically\nputs your computer on high alert.\n\n608\n00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:59,710\nTurns on that firewall,\nblocks that access, and gets you secure.\n\n609\n00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:04,300\nIf you choose a Work Network, it assumes\nthat there's going to be servers, and\n\n610\n00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:07,550\nother things on the network that\nare taking care of file sharing.\n\n611\n00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,481\nSo, that one's pretty straight forward.\n\n612\n00:32:08,481 --> 00:32:10,596\nBut, it does weaken security a bit,\n\n613\n00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:13,140\nbecause you are on\na safe work environment.\n\n614\n00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,740\nBut, the third option is Home.\n\n615\n00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:18,861\nAnd, if you choose a Home network,\nwhen you do that, it's going to say, oh,\n\n616\n00:32:18,861 --> 00:32:19,993\nyou're a Home user.\n\n617\n00:32:19,993 --> 00:32:21,344\nLet me open up some of the security, so\n\n618\n00:32:21,344 --> 00:32:23,091\nthat you can talk to other\npeople on the network.\n\n619\n00:32:23,091 --> 00:32:24,860\nAnd, let's set up a HomeGroup.\n\n620\n00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,610\nAnd, it does it all for you.\n\n621\n00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:29,620\nYou don't actually have to\ncheck much of anything.\n\n622\n00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:33,470\nIn fact, most of you have probably already\nenabled it, and don't even know it.\n\n623\n00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:35,520\nLet me show you on my machine here.\n\n624\n00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,180\nSo, I'm on my Windows 7 machine, and\nwhen I plugged into the network cable,\n\n625\n00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:43,000\nit asked me whether it was going\nto be Work, Home, or Public.\n\n626\n00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,940\nAnd, I told it Home.\n\n627\n00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,980\nSo, that's what I told it when\nI was setting this one up.\n\n628\n00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,698\nSo, it went ahead and\ncreated the other pieces for me.\n\n629\n00:32:49,698 --> 00:32:55,210\nIf I wanna see exactly what happened, I\ncan go into my Network and Sharing Center.\n\n630\n00:32:55,210 --> 00:33:00,630\nIf I go into my Control Panel,\nyou'll see Network and Internet,ight here.\n\n631\n00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:04,490\nAnd, under Network and Internet, I'll\nsee my Network and Sharing Center, and\n\n632\n00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:05,458\nthat's where I wanna go.\n\n633\n00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:10,670\nAnd, it's gonna show me that I'm plugged\ninto a network, and it's a Home network.\n\n634\n00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:13,250\nNow, if I pick wrong,\nif I pick Public by accident,\n\n635\n00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:17,452\nor Work by accident, it won't let you\ndo a HomeGroup on either of those.\n\n636\n00:33:17,452 --> 00:33:19,170\nYou've gotta be on\na Home network to do it.\n\n637\n00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,880\nSo, you can always change your mind.\n\n638\n00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,556\nI can choose Home network, and\n\n639\n00:33:22,556 --> 00:33:25,918\nnow here's that screen I saw\nthe very first time I plugged in.\n\n640\n00:33:25,918 --> 00:33:26,730\nAnd, I can say you know what?\n\n641\n00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,156\nNow, I'm on a Work network.\n\n642\n00:33:29,156 --> 00:33:33,220\nAnd, I can switch that over, and it's\ngonna switch me over to a Work network.\n\n643\n00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,790\nAnd, there we go,\nnow I'm on a Work network.\n\n644\n00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,539\nAnd then, I can switch back to Home.\n\n645\n00:33:37,539 --> 00:33:40,530\nIf I wanna do a HomeGroup,\nI need to be on a Home network.\n\n646\n00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:43,840\nSo, I'll switch that back over, and\nnow I'm gonna be on that Home network.\n\n647\n00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:48,484\nNow, when I did that,\nif this was the very first time,\n\n648\n00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:51,255\nit would have created a HomeGroup for us.\n\n649\n00:33:51,255 --> 00:33:54,994\nAnd, on one of the screens, it just\nquickly displays a message saying, hey,\n\n650\n00:33:54,994 --> 00:33:59,211\nwe're gonna create a HomeGroup, and we're\ngonna share these particular libraries.\n\n651\n00:33:59,211 --> 00:34:01,510\nWe're gonna talk more\nabout the libraries later.\n\n652\n00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,440\nBut, mine already did it.\n\n653\n00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,332\nNow how I know it already did it?\n\n654\n00:34:04,332 --> 00:34:05,700\nWell, we can check.\n\n655\n00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,730\nRight down here at the bottom,\nwe've got a link that says HomeGroup.\n\n656\n00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:13,950\nAnd, if I go in there, it's gonna tell\nme that I'm in a HomeGroup right now,\n\n657\n00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,210\nand here's what I'm sharing.\n\n658\n00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:18,170\nI'm sharing my pictures,\nmy Music, my Printers, and\n\n659\n00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:21,835\nmy Videos with the other\npeople in my HomeGroup.\n\n660\n00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:27,340\nAnd, right down here, I can see that\npassword Ronny was talking about.\n\n661\n00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,720\nView or print the HomeGroup password.\n\n662\n00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:33,100\nAnd if I click on that,\nthere's my password, okay?\n\n663\n00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,490\nNow, if Ronnie comes comes\nover to my house to visit, and\n\n664\n00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:41,260\nI want to share some files with him, I can\nsay, Ronnie, and just pick a home network.\n\n665\n00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:45,520\nAnd, when you do that, it'll ask you for\nthe HomeGroup password, and here it is.\n\n666\n00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,640\nThis is the password.\n\n667\n00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,710\nAnd so, he can punch that in, and\nnow he'll be able to see my documents,\n\n668\n00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,510\nvery easy sharing.\n\n669\n00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,800\nYou just need this password.\n\n670\n00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,918\nThe only problem is how\nannoying that password is.\n\n671\n00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:58,280\nBut you can come in here,\nand you can change it.\n\n672\n00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,284\nSo, I can go in.\n\n673\n00:34:59,284 --> 00:35:00,550\nOr, actually do we have\nto click something?\n\n674\n00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,800\n>> You have to go back to the settings.\n\n675\n00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,250\n>> Let me cancel that, and\nthere it is, Change the password.\n\n676\n00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,860\nSo, we can change that password,\nand I'll just make it itprotv.\n\n677\n00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,960\nNow, must contain at\nleast eight characters.\n\n678\n00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,170\nCome on.\n\n679\n00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:16,605\nSo, it'll be itprotv123.\n\n680\n00:35:16,605 --> 00:35:20,400\nWe'll break all the password policy rules.\n\n681\n00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,630\nSo, there it is.\n\n682\n00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,260\nSo now, when somebody comes to visit,\n\n683\n00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:26,210\ninstead of giving them some crazy\ncockamamie password I can't remember.\n\n684\n00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:29,550\nI can tell them, oh yeah, just pick\na Home network when you connect, and\n\n685\n00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,690\nthen it'll ask you for\nthe HomeGroup password.\n\n686\n00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,450\nJust punch in itprotv123.\n\n687\n00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:36,970\nAnd, you'll see it, you'll connect up, and\nyou'll be able to access my documents.\n\n688\n00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:41,110\nAnd, the way they see that\non the network is like this.\n\n689\n00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:46,030\nThey browse to their Explorer,\nand they'll have a HomeGroup\n\n690\n00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:48,780\nentry right here where they can see\nall the computers that are out there.\n\n691\n00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,480\nOr, they can go to Network, and\nnotice how I show up twice.\n\n692\n00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,780\nI actually show up as a Media Device,\n\n693\n00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:58,360\nso that you can stream music or\nvideos off of my machine.\n\n694\n00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:02,220\nWhen you go in there,\nit's gonna launch into Media Player.\n\n695\n00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:05,290\nI'll go ahead and\njust tell it to use the default settings.\n\n696\n00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,080\nThere we go.\n\n697\n00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,860\nSo, it'll connect up to that machine,\nand view the media library on it,\n\n698\n00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,900\nso you can stream video, and other stuff.\n\n699\n00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:16,710\nIf it's documents that I'm after,\ninstead of going to\n\n700\n00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,350\nthat Media Device, I could of gone\ninto just the regular desktop.\n\n701\n00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:27,680\nAnd, there's a new folder that's\nbeen created called Users.\n\n702\n00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,580\nAnd, when I go into Users,\nI'll see John Doe right there.\n\n703\n00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,749\nAnd in there, I start to see information.\n\n704\n00:36:34,749 --> 00:36:38,460\nThe things that were shared out by\nJohn Doe are a part of that, right?\n\n705\n00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,310\nSo, that's kind of\nthe point of the HomeGroup,\n\n706\n00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:43,460\nit makes it really easy to share things,\nand exchange that information.\n\n707\n00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,160\nHere, I'm connected to that Media Share.\n\n708\n00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:52,460\nAnd so, I've got my little videos\nall present, and there they are.\n\n709\n00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,160\nSo, home groups are pretty neat.\n\n710\n00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,900\nThey factor into just Home networks.\n\n711\n00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,340\nIf you're in a Work or a Public network,\nthey don't function, so\n\n712\n00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,720\nthat's really\na single-purpose environment.\n\n713\n00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,490\nIt's not really suitable for business.\n\n714\n00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:06,380\n>> Now Don, I noticed that in that\nHomeGroup when we took a look\n\n715\n00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:10,680\ninto one of your libraries, there was also\nnot only that Users folder and John Doe,\n\n716\n00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,750\nthere was another folder\nin there called Public.\n\n717\n00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:16,804\nAnd, that's actually a special\nfolder that's on just about every\n\n718\n00:37:16,804 --> 00:37:17,669\nWindows machine.\n\n719\n00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:19,188\n>> Yeah, when you set up a HomeGroup,\n\n720\n00:37:19,188 --> 00:37:22,670\nyou probably don't want to share all\nof your stuff with everybody, right?\n\n721\n00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:25,593\nSo, you've got some people you want\nto have access to your documents,\n\n722\n00:37:25,593 --> 00:37:26,334\nsome you don't.\n\n723\n00:37:26,334 --> 00:37:28,908\nBut, a home group tries to keep that easy,\nand\n\n724\n00:37:28,908 --> 00:37:32,550\nthey do that by giving you a Public\nlibrary and a Private library.\n\n725\n00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,090\nLet's go back to my machine here.\n\n726\n00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:41,280\nSo, here I am, and\nI'm just firing up my Explorer.\n\n727\n00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,360\nAnd notice, on the left side here,\nI have what's called my libraries.\n\n728\n00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,570\nHere's all my Documents, all my Music,\nall my Pictures, all my Videos.\n\n729\n00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,840\nSee how there's a little\narrow beside each one.\n\n730\n00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:56,540\nIf I expand those out,\neach one of them actually has two folders.\n\n731\n00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:00,780\nOne that says My Videos,\nor My Music, My Documents.\n\n732\n00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:04,580\nAnd, the other one says, Public Videos,\nPublic Music, Public Documents.\n\n733\n00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:10,590\nIf I wanna share something with\nthe HomeGroup, I put it in the Public one.\n\n734\n00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:16,340\nSo, if I have a video file, and\nlet's go take a look at one of my videos.\n\n735\n00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:19,970\nSo, here's that Serenity Video Trailer.\n\n736\n00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:26,260\nIf I want to share that with everybody,\nI put it in my Public Videos folder.\n\n737\n00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,790\nSo now, it's in my Public Videos,\nand there it is.\n\n738\n00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:34,470\nIf I just want to share it with me and\nnobody else, I put it in My Videos.\n\n739\n00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:37,540\nAnd, in My Videos, it will be available\nto me, but not to other people.\n\n740\n00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:42,100\nSo, that gives us the ability to\ncreate public and private stuff.\n\n741\n00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,710\nBut, you might be asking yourself,\n\n742\n00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:46,670\nI don't want to store stuff in two\ndifferent places, that's really annoying.\n\n743\n00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,540\nThe libraries do this roll-up thing.\n\n744\n00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:55,516\nSo, when I click on Videos, it's showing\nme a mixture of both Public and Private.\n\n745\n00:38:55,516 --> 00:38:57,560\nAnd then, when I go down here,\nthat's where it divides it up.\n\n746\n00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:03,309\nSo, when I had Serenity in my Private\nVideos, and I've got this Sample Video\n\n747\n00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:08,182\nfolder in my Public Videos,\nwhen I go to just Videos, I see both.\n\n748\n00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:11,476\nSo, even though I've got them\nstored in two different places,\n\n749\n00:39:11,476 --> 00:39:14,240\nI have one place I go to see,\nand work with them.\n\n750\n00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,240\nSo, that's what a Public Folder is.\n\n751\n00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,090\nIt makes it easy to share\nthings out in the HomeGroup.\n\n752\n00:39:21,215 --> 00:39:24,120\nSo, sharing doesn't have to be hard.\n\n753\n00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:28,230\nYou can do this type of sharing,\nHomeGroup, which is super easy.\n\n754\n00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,990\nThere are other ways to share\nit without a HomeGroup though.\n\n755\n00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:33,600\nAnd, you might be asking yourself,\nwhy wouldn't I use a HomeGroup?\n\n756\n00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,976\nIf you're a business environment,\nyou won't use a HomeGroup.\n\n757\n00:39:36,976 --> 00:39:38,070\nIt's not designed for that.\n\n758\n00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,624\nYou need more control.\n\n759\n00:39:39,624 --> 00:39:43,914\nOr if you've got some Windows XP\nmachines on your network.\n\n760\n00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:46,380\nWindows XP doesn't support a home group.\n\n761\n00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:49,200\nSo there's certain environments\nwhere a home group is not suitable.\n\n762\n00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,710\nAnd, so in those cases, you have to\nuse the other form of Windows sharing.\n\n763\n00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,950\nAnd I showed you guys those\nshare permissions earlier.\n\n764\n00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,050\nBut I was doing it the hard way.\n\n765\n00:39:56,050 --> 00:40:01,070\nWhat I was doing was called\nadvanced sharing, right?\n\n766\n00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:04,520\n>> Advanced sharing gives us\nthe most control that we can have\n\n767\n00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,130\nbecause it allows us to be\nable to select a user and\n\n768\n00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:10,370\neven assign what levels of permission\nthat we want them to have.\n\n769\n00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:14,920\nThe other way to do it is actually about\nthe same, but a little bit easier.\n\n770\n00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,040\nWe can take a folder,\nsimply right-click on it,\n\n771\n00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,290\nand choose who we want to share that with,\nand then just assign them,\n\n772\n00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:23,510\njust, either, read permissions or\nread and write permissions.\n\n773\n00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,300\n>> And that's really suitable for\nmost people.\n\n774\n00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,470\nWe don't have to go crazy with it.\n\n775\n00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:29,440\nLet me show you guys\nthe difference here on my machine.\n\n776\n00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,200\nI just made a folder\ncalled shared documents.\n\n777\n00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:36,380\nAnd if I right-click on it,\nyou'll see this Share with, and\n\n778\n00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:40,710\nI can say share it with Homegroup Read,\nor Homegroup Read Write.\n\n779\n00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,350\nThat's why I wanna have access to this.\n\n780\n00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:47,230\nOr I can say specific people, and\nI can punch in who I want to have access.\n\n781\n00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:49,348\nSo I'm gonna add in Jane Doe.\n\n782\n00:40:49,348 --> 00:40:53,780\nAnd I'm gonna give Jane Doe either read or\nread write or nothing.\n\n783\n00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,310\nRight?\n\n784\n00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:56,660\nSuper easy to give her those permissions.\n\n785\n00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,650\nThose are called basic\nsharing permissions.\n\n786\n00:40:58,650 --> 00:40:59,290\nThey're quick.\n\n787\n00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,890\nThey're easy and\nthey meet most people's needs.\n\n788\n00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:07,440\nI might not just do that but\nalso do my home group, and so\n\n789\n00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,810\nI'm gonna give the home group the ability\nto read or maybe the home group gets\n\n790\n00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:14,230\nthe ability to read and write, whatever\nit is that I wanna give out there.\n\n791\n00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:17,940\nAnd I can now share it, and\nthat will be available to those people.\n\n792\n00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:22,320\nThe advanced way that I did it was I\npulled up the properties of the folder and\n\n793\n00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,450\nI went to the Sharing tab.\n\n794\n00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:28,840\nAnd I went to Advanced Sharing.\n\n795\n00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,180\nInside of here is where we\nhave a permission button, and\n\n796\n00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,430\nthat's where you can get\na little more specific.\n\n797\n00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:37,910\nIt's not just read and read write,\nhere I have read, change and full control.\n\n798\n00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:40,285\nChange is the equivalent of read write.\n\n799\n00:41:40,285 --> 00:41:43,395\nFull control means it can do\nall sorts of other things like\n\n800\n00:41:43,395 --> 00:41:45,135\nchange permissions on the file.\n\n801\n00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:48,405\nSo we can get a lot more granular here,\na little more specific about what\n\n802\n00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:52,097\ntype of access we want them to have and\nwe can list various people.\n\n803\n00:41:52,097 --> 00:41:55,707\nSo, three different ways to share\nthose files on the network,\n\n804\n00:41:55,707 --> 00:41:58,757\nthey all end with the same result.\n\n805\n00:41:58,757 --> 00:42:01,387\nSo, if you can use the easy method,\nyou should.\n\n806\n00:42:01,387 --> 00:42:02,287\nGo ahead and use it right?\n\n807\n00:42:02,287 --> 00:42:04,648\nThere's not really a benefit\nof going the advanced method,\n\n808\n00:42:04,648 --> 00:42:06,988\nunless you need more fine tuned control.\n\n809\n00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:12,458\n>> Our next objective that we're hitting\non is understanding encryption that's\n\n810\n00:42:12,458 --> 00:42:13,878\nused in Windows 7.\n\n811\n00:42:13,878 --> 00:42:17,278\nWindows 7 actually gives us more\nencryption than we had in previous\n\n812\n00:42:17,278 --> 00:42:22,088\neditions of the operating system for\nWindows in that it gives us the ability to\n\n813\n00:42:22,088 --> 00:42:27,888\nencrypt the entire hard drive or\nto individually encrypt files themselves.\n\n814\n00:42:27,888 --> 00:42:29,960\nSo there's a lot of neat\nfeatures with this.\n\n815\n00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,500\n>> And\nwhy would we want to encrypt our drive?\n\n816\n00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,160\nThe main reason is if your\ndrive is unencrypted and\n\n817\n00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,710\nsomebody steals your computer\n\n818\n00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:43,290\nthere are ways to bypass the log in screen\nto be able to access files on a drive.\n\n819\n00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:45,910\nThe easiest way is to take\nthe hard drive out, and\n\n820\n00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:48,960\nadd it as a second drive\nto another computer.\n\n821\n00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,210\nThen they can boot their\nown operating system and\n\n822\n00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:54,500\ncompletely bypass your\nauthentication altogether.\n\n823\n00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:59,255\nSo, if somebody gets physical access\nto your machine, your data is at risk.\n\n824\n00:42:59,255 --> 00:43:00,830\nRight?\nThey can get at your data.\n\n825\n00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:05,260\nBut if you encrypt your data, even though\nthey stole that physical hard drive and\n\n826\n00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:05,890\nthey've got it,\n\n827\n00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:09,625\nand they bypass your authentication,\nthe data is still encrypted.\n\n828\n00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:10,830\nRight?\n\n829\n00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:14,620\nNow, you can use BitLocker to\nencrypt your entire hard drive, and\n\n830\n00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:15,820\nthat's what Microsoft recommends.\n\n831\n00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:20,252\nThey want you to encrypt the whole drive,\njust protect everything, all right.\n\n832\n00:43:20,252 --> 00:43:22,200\nAnd BitLocker is a great technology for\ndoing that.\n\n833\n00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,250\nWhen you boot your computer up,\nyou have to authenticate someway.\n\n834\n00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:27,660\nYou can either type in\na really long password, or\n\n835\n00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:30,600\nyou might have a USB key that you\ninsert that it checks to make sure that\n\n836\n00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,630\nyou've got before it lets you pass it.\n\n837\n00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:36,720\nYou might have some kind of a thumb\nprint scanner integration with it, so\n\n838\n00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,060\nyou can do that.\n\n839\n00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:41,080\nOr a, what's called a TPM,\na trusted platform module,\n\n840\n00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:45,220\nbuilt into your motherboard that says,\nthis hard drive will only decrypt when\n\n841\n00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:48,580\nit's attached to this motherboard, and\nwe boot off of its operating system.\n\n842\n00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:51,710\nThat means you won't be able\nto bypass the authentication.\n\n843\n00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:54,660\nThere's a number of ways to\nconfigure BitLocker that work.\n\n844\n00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:58,550\nIf you want to use BitLocker, there's\na simple wizard that you run inside of\n\n845\n00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:01,070\nWindows that'll help you configure that.\n\n846\n00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:02,410\nKey thing to remember.\n\n847\n00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:06,000\nThe way BitLocker works is\nwhen you boot your computer,\n\n848\n00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,260\nyou'll have a small partition on\nyour hard drive that is unencrypted\n\n849\n00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:14,870\nthat tells it how to load BitLocker.\n\n850\n00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:20,470\nAnd then after that,\nthe whole rest of your drive is encrypted.\n\n851\n00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:24,570\nWhen you install Windows, it should\nhave already created those partitions\n\n852\n00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:26,230\nto get you set up for BitLocker.\n\n853\n00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:29,750\nBut if it didn't, then you might\nnot be able to run BitLocker.\n\n854\n00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,440\nNot every system can.\n\n855\n00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,300\nSo when you start to configure it,\nit's gonna run a little wizard and check.\n\n856\n00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:38,770\nNow, on my computer, I'm pretty\nsure I don't have that partition.\n\n857\n00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:40,410\nLet me just double check here.\n\n858\n00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:42,580\nI'm gonna go into my computer management,\nand\n\n859\n00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:43,890\nthen I'll go into\nthe disk management tool.\n\n860\n00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:46,260\nI don't think I have\nthe small unencrypted one.\n\n861\n00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,360\nYeah, I don't.\n\n862\n00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,490\nOn a lot of computers, when you look at\nthem, right here at the very beginning,\n\n863\n00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:54,390\nthere'll be a small partition that's\navailable to use for BitLocker.\n\n864\n00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:56,590\nMy computer is not gonna be compatible.\n\n865\n00:44:56,590 --> 00:45:00,140\nSo if I were to launch\nthe BitLocker Wizard, right.\n\n866\n00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:03,580\nSo I'm just typing BitLocker\nin my start menu search field.\n\n867\n00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,070\nAnd I'll go to BitLocker Drive Encryption.\n\n868\n00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:07,710\nSo here it is.\n\n869\n00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:11,420\nI see my C drive, and\nif I go to turn on BitLocker.\n\n870\n00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:14,260\nIt's gonna run though a check, and\nhere we go, I've got some problems.\n\n871\n00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:18,010\nWell, first off, I don't have a compatible\nTPM, so it's upset about that.\n\n872\n00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:21,465\nBut even if it wasn't upset about that,\nit'd be mad about me not having\n\n873\n00:45:21,465 --> 00:45:24,380\nan unencrypted partition at\nthe beginning of my drive.\n\n874\n00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:24,970\nAll right?\n\n875\n00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:27,570\nSo, I can't use Bitlocker.\n\n876\n00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:28,259\nAm I out of luck?\n\n877\n00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,900\nNo, not really.\n\n878\n00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:35,590\nIf we can't encrypt the entire drive\nvolume itself, the entire hard drive.\n\n879\n00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:36,556\nThat will protect us.\n\n880\n00:45:36,556 --> 00:45:39,283\nWe can encrypt-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n881\n00:45:39,283 --> 00:45:41,960\n>> individual folders and\n\n882\n00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,630\nfiles themselves.\n\n883\n00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:48,025\nAnd if you're running NTFS,\nit's part of that file system,\n\n884\n00:45:48,025 --> 00:45:52,011\nthese are one of the bells ans whistles\nthat we were talking about earlier\n\n885\n00:45:52,011 --> 00:45:54,184\nthat can give us the ability to do that.\n\n886\n00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:56,930\nAnd that is a special\nencryption that we call EFS.\n\n887\n00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,780\nEncrypting filesystem.\n\n888\n00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:00,280\nYeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n889\n00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,255\nSo NTFS has encryption built into it,\n\n890\n00:46:03,255 --> 00:46:07,040\nEFS, and all you have to do is make\nsure your drive is formatted NTFS.\n\n891\n00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,250\nNow in my case, I don't have that\nextra partition that I need.\n\n892\n00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:14,010\nBut I'm not out of luck, because at\nleast the partition I do have is NTFS.\n\n893\n00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:18,140\nSo I can pick the folders that have my\nsensitive data, and I can encrypt them, or\n\n894\n00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:20,960\nI can encrypt individual\nfiles if I want to.\n\n895\n00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,890\nOn my computer,\nI'm sharing it with Jane Doe.\n\n896\n00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:27,450\nSo I'm Joe Doe and there's Jane Doe,\nand we're sharing this computer.\n\n897\n00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:31,060\nBut maybe there's some data that I don't\nwant Jane to be able to get at and\n\n898\n00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,130\nso I encrypt it.\n\n899\n00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:37,280\nWhen you encrypt a file with EFS\na certificate is generated for\n\n900\n00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:42,360\nyour user, it's a private key, and the\nfile's encrypted using that private key.\n\n901\n00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,480\nThe only way you can decrypt it,\nis if you have the private key and\n\n902\n00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,330\nit's tied to your user account.\n\n903\n00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:50,730\nSo if a different user logs in,\nthey don't have access to it.\n\n904\n00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:51,280\nRight?\n\n905\n00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,440\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n906\n00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:58,510\nI'm gonna switch over to Jane Doe here,\nso let me just switch users and\n\n907\n00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:01,750\nwe'll pull up old Jane\n>> Old Jane.\n\n908\n00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:03,510\n>> Old Jane, that's, I don't know.\n\n909\n00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:04,230\nWhatever.\n\n910\n00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:08,060\nSo, so here I am, so\nI'm Jane Doe and on my computer,\n\n911\n00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:12,510\nif I browse, I can fire this up,\nbrowse through my C drive.\n\n912\n00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:16,230\nHere's that business docs folder and\nif I go into business docs,\n\n913\n00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:18,290\nhere's my employee handbook.\n\n914\n00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:18,950\nAll right?\n\n915\n00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:22,440\nAnd what I did is it's just a text file\nand it says this is the employee handbook\n\n916\n00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:27,460\nand then I put the text for tale of two\ncities in here, a little Charles Dickens.\n\n917\n00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:28,580\nSo I've got that.\n\n918\n00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:29,740\nSo here's, here it is.\n\n919\n00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:33,670\nAnd I can clearly see all the text and\nread what's in there, right.\n\n920\n00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:36,190\nJane has access to this file.\n\n921\n00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:37,120\nOkay.\n\n922\n00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:41,301\nNow, if I switch back over to John, so\n\n923\n00:47:41,301 --> 00:47:45,626\nI'm just gonna jump over here to John.\n\n924\n00:47:45,626 --> 00:47:47,009\nAnd I'm gonna log in as him.\n\n925\n00:47:47,009 --> 00:47:50,911\nNow, John says,\nthis employee handbook is super secret.\n\n926\n00:47:50,911 --> 00:47:53,192\nI wanna have it on this computer,\nbut I don't want Jane to get it,\n\n927\n00:47:53,192 --> 00:47:55,880\nor if somebody steals this computer,\nI don't want them to get it.\n\n928\n00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,030\nSo we want to encrypt it.\n\n929\n00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:00,810\nAnd so the first thing we need to check\nis to make sure that our computer\n\n930\n00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:03,050\nis indeed formatted NTFS, right?\n\n931\n00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:06,380\nSo I'll just pull up\nthe properties of my C drive, and\n\n932\n00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:09,170\nI can see that it is NTFS, so I'm a go.\n\n933\n00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:11,640\nI can use EFS right now.\n\n934\n00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,800\nAnd I'm gonna browse into\nthat Business Docs folder.\n\n935\n00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,190\nAnd I'll just pull up the properties\nof that employee handbook.\n\n936\n00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:22,170\nNow when I pull up the properties for it,\nright down here there's a little field\n\n937\n00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:25,510\ncalled Attributes, and\nthere's an Advanced button beside that.\n\n938\n00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:27,110\nAnd when I go into Advanced,\n\n939\n00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:31,220\nthat's where I'll see Encrypt\nthe contents to secure data.\n\n940\n00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:34,810\nI'm gonna encrypt this file, all right.\n\n941\n00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:38,040\nSo I'll go ahead and\nsay OK to that, and I'll apply it.\n\n942\n00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,190\nHere it is, it's asking if I want\nto encrypt the whole folder,\n\n943\n00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:42,335\nI'm just gonna do this one file.\n\n944\n00:48:42,335 --> 00:48:46,840\nOkay, so I’ll go ahead and\nchoose that, and I’ll hit OK.\n\n945\n00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,790\nAnd now it’s going to encrypt it.\n\n946\n00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:51,960\nNow I did just get a status warning\ntelling me I need to back up my encryption\n\n947\n00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:55,310\nkey because if I lose my key,\nI can’t decrypt it, right?\n\n948\n00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:58,814\nSo definitely a good idea to do that,\nbut for right now I’m gonna ignore that.\n\n949\n00:48:58,814 --> 00:49:00,974\n>> And you can see that it's encrypted.\n\n950\n00:49:00,974 --> 00:49:05,264\nThe file system itself marked the file\nby changing the lettering of the file or\n\n951\n00:49:05,264 --> 00:49:08,230\nthe name of the file and\nmarked it in green.\n\n952\n00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:09,280\nNow, the strange thing is,\n\n953\n00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,800\nif Don were to now go into that file,\nhe's gonna be able to read it.\n\n954\n00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,840\nIt actually doesn't look like\nit's encrypted at all, Don.\n\n955\n00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,340\n>> Yep.\n\n956\n00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:21,130\nSo the private key is\nattached to my user account.\n\n957\n00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:24,120\nSo when I open that file\nit uses the private key,\n\n958\n00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,880\nit decrypts the file so\nI see it this way, right?\n\n959\n00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,350\nThat's automatic,\nseamless to the end user.\n\n960\n00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:31,011\nThe end user doesn't\neven know that happened.\n\n961\n00:49:31,011 --> 00:49:33,315\nIt decrypts it on the fly and\nI work with it.\n\n962\n00:49:33,315 --> 00:49:38,635\nAnd if I change it, so\nhere's a change, right?\n\n963\n00:49:38,635 --> 00:49:42,875\nWhen I save that file,\nit's gonna re-encrypt it, and so\n\n964\n00:49:42,875 --> 00:49:45,265\nit's encrypting it again and storing it.\n\n965\n00:49:45,265 --> 00:49:49,125\nSo the end-user doesn't have to\ndo anything special after they've\n\n966\n00:49:49,125 --> 00:49:50,505\nturned on EFS.\n\n967\n00:49:50,505 --> 00:49:54,500\nIt's encrypted and that's it,\nI work with it like normal, but\n\n968\n00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,917\nif I switch over to Jane,\nsomething interesting is gonna happen.\n\n969\n00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:04,150\nSo over here on Jane's system,\nwhich is the same system,\n\n970\n00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:06,590\njust different person logged in,\nso now I'm Jane, and\n\n971\n00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:13,000\nI'm gonna browse into that computer and\nbrowse into my Business Docs folder.\n\n972\n00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,800\nAnd there's the employee handbook,\nit's green so that I know that it's there.\n\n973\n00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,310\nAnd if I double click on it,\nI get Access is denied.\n\n974\n00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:21,900\nNow what the heck does that mean?\n\n975\n00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:26,360\nI have permission to access this file but\nit's encrypted.\n\n976\n00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:30,180\nI don't have the encryption key.\n\n977\n00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:32,970\nI can't get into that file.\n\n978\n00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:35,630\nAnd in fact,\nif I go to like a command prompt,\n\n979\n00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:37,140\nwe'll see what I can get away with here.\n\n980\n00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:45,230\nLet me get into this from the command\nline, and I'm gonna use the TYPE command.\n\n981\n00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:51,540\nLet me see if one of the old DOS\ncommands will display this for\n\n982\n00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:53,670\nme, is what I'm thinking.\n\n983\n00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:56,530\nAnd I get Access denied there too.\n\n984\n00:50:56,530 --> 00:51:00,590\nIf I were to find some way to\nbe able to open this file,\n\n985\n00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:03,340\nall I would see is\na bunch of jumbled mess.\n\n986\n00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:08,360\nI wouldn't see letters like I expect,\nI would see a jumbled mess.\n\n987\n00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:12,930\nWindows is smart enough to know\nto display this error to me.\n\n988\n00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:16,900\nI wonder if like maybe\nNotepad++ will open it.\n\n989\n00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:19,710\nLet's see if somebody,\nif it's from Microsoft,\n\n990\n00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:22,120\nthey do a check to display\nthat error message.\n\n991\n00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,310\nBut other vendors might not.\n\n992\n00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:25,840\nSo let's see if Notepad++\nwill let me get around that.\n\n993\n00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,490\nBut yeah, if you open it up\nit is just a jumbled mess.\n\n994\n00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:30,170\nIt looks like nothing.\n\n995\n00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:33,380\nYou can't recognize any words,\nnone of it makes any sense.\n\n996\n00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:35,150\nIt's just a giant mess.\n\n997\n00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:40,130\nAnd that's because the file is fully\nencrypted so, it's just telling me\n\n998\n00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:43,446\nI don't have that access, so\nit's encrypted I can't get to it.\n\n999\n00:51:43,446 --> 00:51:47,590\nIf John were to remove the encryption,\nthen I could get to it, but\n\n1000\n00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:48,991\nas long as it's encrypted I can't.\n\n1001\n00:51:48,991 --> 00:51:54,002\nNow here I encrypted just an individual\nfile, you can encrypt an entire folder.\n\n1002\n00:51:54,002 --> 00:51:56,990\nAnd the nice part about\ndoing an entire folder\n\n1003\n00:51:56,990 --> 00:52:00,870\nis anytime you create new stuff in there,\nit'll automatically be encrypted.\n\n1004\n00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:05,320\nSo if I switch back over to John, and\n\n1005\n00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:08,370\nI type in the right password,\nit's probably gonna make a difference.\n\n1006\n00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:13,510\nThen what we can do is we can go up\nto the Business Docs folder, and\n\n1007\n00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:14,890\nwe can turn the encryption on there.\n\n1008\n00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:21,040\nAnd so if I take the Business Docs folder\nand I go to Advanced and I choose Encrypt,\n\n1009\n00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:25,990\nwhen I say OK it's gonna ask if I want\nto encrypt the entire folder and I do.\n\n1010\n00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:26,980\nI want to do the folder and\n\n1011\n00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:30,900\nanything inside of it, and\nso when I say OK to that.\n\n1012\n00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,025\nLet's see, an error occurred.\n\n1013\n00:52:32,025 --> 00:52:33,825\nThe file is being used\nby another processor.\n\n1014\n00:52:33,825 --> 00:52:36,445\nOh, Jane is still in the folder, shoot.\n\n1015\n00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:39,215\nI left Jane in the folder,\nso it's complaining there.\n\n1016\n00:52:39,215 --> 00:52:40,215\nI'll do a different folder.\n\n1017\n00:52:40,215 --> 00:52:42,835\nWe'll do Notepad++.\n\n1018\n00:52:42,835 --> 00:52:43,890\nSo I'll encrypt this one.\n\n1019\n00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:46,425\nWhoop, that's not what I wanted.\n\n1020\n00:52:46,425 --> 00:52:48,355\nSo I'm gonna go back into its properties.\n\n1021\n00:52:48,355 --> 00:52:52,770\nIn Advanced, I'll turn on encryption,\nand I'll encrypt this entire folder.\n\n1022\n00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:57,280\nNow it's gonna encrypt it and\nJane's in the Notepad++ folder,\n\n1023\n00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,980\nI forgot about that too.\n\n1024\n00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,200\nWell, let's do this.\n\n1025\n00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:04,070\nI'll just create an all new folder,\nnew private docs, or\n\n1026\n00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:06,540\nI guess I could do my My Documents folder,\nbut we'll do this one.\n\n1027\n00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:09,670\nSo I'm gonna call this\nmy Private Docs right.\n\n1028\n00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:12,670\nAnd I’ll turn on encryption there, and\nwhen you encrypt on the folder it's really\n\n1029\n00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:17,200\ncool because anything you add\nto it will get encrypted.\n\n1030\n00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:22,020\nSo I’m just checking that Encrypt contents\noption and I’ll tell it to do it.\n\n1031\n00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:25,690\nAnd now if I go into that folder I\ncan create new things like a new\n\n1032\n00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:30,990\ntext document, a new picture, whatever.\n\n1033\n00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:32,470\nAnd see how they're all green?\n\n1034\n00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:34,920\nIt knows to just encrypt anything\nthat goes in this folder, so\n\n1035\n00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,135\nthis is my new secure folder.\n\n1036\n00:53:36,135 --> 00:53:38,680\nAnytime I have something private,\nI throw it in here.\n\n1037\n00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:42,060\nAnd I know it's encrypted and\nI can still work with it like normal.\n\n1038\n00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:42,930\n>> Yeah.\n\n1039\n00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:45,900\nSo, with BitLocker and\nthe encrypting file system,\n\n1040\n00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:49,620\nwe have some good protection for\nour files and our folders.\n\n1041\n00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:54,500\nAnd remember that with EFS it's because\nwe're already running that NTFS as our\n\n1042\n00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:58,880\nfile system, BitLocker is the one that\nactually really just allows us to encrypt\n\n1043\n00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,055\nthe entire drive itself.\n\n1044\n00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,300\n>> There's another little feature\nin NTFS that can be used not\n\n1045\n00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:09,360\nat the same time as EFS but\nin replacement of.\n\n1046\n00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:13,450\nEFS gives us encryption,\nthere's also compression.\n\n1047\n00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:15,010\nIf you're running low on hard drive space,\n\n1048\n00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:19,300\nyou can tell NTFS to automatically\ncompress files that are stored.\n\n1049\n00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,970\nAnd let me show you an example of that.\n\n1050\n00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:23,850\nNow it doesn't work together with EFS,\nwe have to kinda do one or\n\n1051\n00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:26,200\nthe other, but\nwe can go in and turn it on.\n\n1052\n00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,730\nI'll go into my Business Docs, and\n\n1053\n00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:31,370\nI'm gonna turn off the encryption\non the employee handbook.\n\n1054\n00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:33,590\nLet me just pull that up and\ngo back into the settings.\n\n1055\n00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:37,560\nAnd I'm gonna uncheck the Encrypt\ncontents to secure data.\n\n1056\n00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:42,190\nSo I'll turn that off and now it's not\ngreen anymore, so it's not encrypted.\n\n1057\n00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:46,120\nBut if I go back into the properties and\ngo into Advanced.\n\n1058\n00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:49,790\nI can turn on Compress\ncontents to save disk space.\n\n1059\n00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:53,990\nSo I'll check that off and say OK,\nand now it's gonna compress it.\n\n1060\n00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:56,110\nSee how it turned blue?\n\n1061\n00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:58,030\nNow it still says 754 K right there.\n\n1062\n00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:01,340\nThat's the exact size it was before, so\n\n1063\n00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:04,420\nin looking at it,\nit didn't compress at all did it?\n\n1064\n00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:05,270\nThat's pretty crappy.\n\n1065\n00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:09,220\nWhy would I even bother with that?\n\n1066\n00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:10,780\n>> No, I was wondering the same thing.\n\n1067\n00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:13,110\nWhy in the world it didn't\nactually even do anything?\n\n1068\n00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:17,060\n>> So, Windows is reflecting\nthe size of the file itself.\n\n1069\n00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:21,400\nBut Windows actually tracks two different\nsizes, the size of the file, and\n\n1070\n00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,920\nthe space it occupies on the disk.\n\n1071\n00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:28,372\nIf I pull up the properties of that file,\nI'll see,\n\n1072\n00:55:28,372 --> 00:55:30,892\nyes, the file is 750 K [CROSSTALK].\n\n1073\n00:55:30,892 --> 00:55:32,268\nBut, on the disk.\n\n1074\n00:55:32,268 --> 00:55:34,860\n>> Here we go.\n>> It's only 520 K.\n\n1075\n00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:37,450\nThat means it actually\ncompressed it a good bit.\n\n1076\n00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:41,095\nI mean, that's almost 30%, I think.\n\n1077\n00:55:41,095 --> 00:55:42,312\nSo, [LAUGH] my math is not necessarily\n\n1078\n00:55:42,312 --> 00:55:43,274\nthe greatest, but it's-\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n1079\n00:55:43,274 --> 00:55:48,004\n>> about 25% or 30% So\nit actually got pretty good compression.\n\n1080\n00:55:48,004 --> 00:55:49,824\nBut Windows Explorer doesn't show that.\n\n1081\n00:55:49,824 --> 00:55:53,690\nIt shows you the full size, so that you\nknow if I was to copy this somewhere else,\n\n1082\n00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:56,050\nthis is the space it would take, right.\n\n1083\n00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:57,990\nBut it is actually compressing\nit on the disk and\n\n1084\n00:55:57,990 --> 00:56:02,670\nyou'll be able to get more space\nout of that disk, and, in fact,\n\n1085\n00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:07,220\nif we go back to my disk manager when\nwe formatted that drive earlier and\n\n1086\n00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:13,460\nchose to do NTFS it actually offered to\nturn on compression for the entire drive.\n\n1087\n00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:16,420\nSo when you format one,\nlike I'm gonna take this fat 32 drive and\n\n1088\n00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:20,585\nI'm gonna format it and\nI'm gonna format it NTFS.\n\n1089\n00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:24,170\nSo So this is gonna be another NTFS drive.\n\n1090\n00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:27,510\nAnd see how I've got Enable file and\nfolder compression,\n\n1091\n00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:32,900\nI can turn that on right from the get\ngo and it's gonna format that drive.\n\n1092\n00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:35,170\nIt shows up as a regular drive so\n\n1093\n00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:40,810\nan end user can start to store data\nthere that was what, my F drive I think.\n\n1094\n00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:43,970\nYes, and when they go in here and\nstart to create folders and\n\n1095\n00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:46,510\nthings it's gonna\nautomatically compress that.\n\n1096\n00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:50,730\nSo this will be my personal data and\nsee how it's already blue?\n\n1097\n00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:53,450\nCompression is turned on for\nthe whole drive and\n\n1098\n00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:56,270\nas I start to copy other files into here.\n\n1099\n00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:02,130\nSo if I take some of these big files and\ncopy them in, not only is it gonna copy\n\n1100\n00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:07,320\nthose files over, but it's gonna compress\nthem also, so they take less space.\n\n1101\n00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:11,330\nAnd so it's gonna copy those over and\nwhen it's done, it's compressing them.\n\n1102\n00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:13,590\nSo see how it's turned blue already,\n\n1103\n00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:16,980\nthis file is telling me that\nit's 2 gigabytes in size.\n\n1104\n00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:19,570\nBut once it's done copying\nin the compression happens,\n\n1105\n00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:22,380\nwe'll see that it ends up being much,\nmuch smaller.\n\n1106\n00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:26,620\n>> Now if you right click on that employee\nhandbook over on that other folder and\n\n1107\n00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:28,480\nlet's go back to the properties for\na moment.\n\n1108\n00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,580\nYou said I couldn't actually do both,\nbut it looks like I might be able to.\n\n1109\n00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:35,750\n>> Well I certainly could be wrong,\nguess we'll find out.\n\n1110\n00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:36,652\n>> No, you're not wrong.\n\n1111\n00:57:36,652 --> 00:57:37,237\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Now,\n\n1112\n00:57:37,237 --> 00:57:40,888\nif you take a look where it says compress\nor encrypt, notice how those check boxes,\n\n1113\n00:57:40,888 --> 00:57:43,965\nand usually that means that you can\nactually select more than the one,\n\n1114\n00:57:43,965 --> 00:57:45,655\njust like you see the two boxes above.\n\n1115\n00:57:45,655 --> 00:57:49,230\nBut this one will absolutely\nnot allow you to.\n\n1116\n00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:52,170\nIf you select compress,\nit's gonna automatically decrypt it.\n\n1117\n00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:56,680\nIf you select Encrypt, it's gonna\nactually decompress it so it can do it.\n\n1118\n00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,920\nSo even though it looks like\nyou have the option to do both,\n\n1119\n00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,970\nyou're not gonna be able to.\n\n1120\n00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:04,750\nSo, it can trick you, you might go,\nno I'm sure I can do it but\n\n1121\n00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:07,340\nyou can't,\nit's just not gonna allow it to happen.\n\n1122\n00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:08,120\n>> Yep.\n\n1123\n00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:10,980\nAnd so those files are now copied over and\nthese files,\n\n1124\n00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,900\nthey're actually fake files\nthat I made before the show.\n\n1125\n00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:16,470\nThey're completely empty, so\nthey should compress very, very small.\n\n1126\n00:58:16,470 --> 00:58:21,220\nSo if I take the biggest one here at six\ngigabytes, if I pull up its properties.\n\n1127\n00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:22,460\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> I'll see the space on disk\n\n1128\n00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:23,390\nis less than.\n\n1129\n00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:24,230\n>> Twenty megabytes.\n\n1130\n00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:25,400\n>> Just a hair over 20 megabytes.\n\n1131\n00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,290\nYeah.\ncompression\n\n1132\n00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:28,250\nratio way through the roof on that one.\n\n1133\n00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:30,330\nSo, that's kind of a neat little feature,\n\n1134\n00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:33,400\nif you've got a FAT32 drive,\nyou can't do that.\n\n1135\n00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,300\nThat's an NTFS feature.\n\n1136\n00:58:36,002 --> 00:58:39,200\nAll right, Ronnie, that is probably\na good spot to stop and take a break.\n\n1137\n00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:43,750\nI know we still have libraries to\ntalk about, some offline files, but\n\n1138\n00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:45,480\nI know we shot past our break point,\nanyways.\n\n1139\n00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:50,640\nSo let's stop here and\ntake a pause, when we get back,\n\n1140\n00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:57,630\nmore folder and file action after this.\n\n1141\n00:58:57,630 --> 00:59:01,256\nStay tuned.\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back everybody,\n\n1142\n00:59:01,256 --> 00:59:05,795\nso we're ready to move into our\nlast part of this objective,\n\n1143\n00:59:05,795 --> 00:59:08,562\nwhich is understanding libraries.\n\n1144\n00:59:08,562 --> 00:59:12,726\nAnd I know we saw libraries briefly\nearlier when I showed you guys the private\n\n1145\n00:59:12,726 --> 00:59:17,214\nversus public libraries that are a part of\nour user accounts in our homegroup, but\n\n1146\n00:59:17,214 --> 00:59:20,028\nthere is more than we can do\nto those if we so choose.\n\n1147\n00:59:20,028 --> 00:59:24,757\n>> Yep, libraries give us the ability to\nhave a single location that we can refer\n\n1148\n00:59:24,757 --> 00:59:28,030\nto, but our files can be\nstored in other locations.\n\n1149\n00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:31,240\nWhat we're doing is we're just\nconnecting it back to this one location,\n\n1150\n00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:34,980\nmakes it easy for us to click on it and\nit displays those files right there, so\n\n1151\n00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:38,570\nwe don't have to go and search for\nall of our files everywhere else.\n\n1152\n00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:42,510\n>> And now the stuff in your local user\nprofile is already in your library.\n\n1153\n00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:46,150\nSo for most people if you're choosing a\nsingle machine and that's where your data\n\n1154\n00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:49,188\nis the libraries are perfectly fine\nthe way they are right out of the box.\n\n1155\n00:59:49,188 --> 00:59:52,960\nRight, and that's what we've seen here, if\nI pull my libraries back up I'll just go\n\n1156\n00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:56,630\ninto windows explorer, the libraries\nare actually what it defaults to.\n\n1157\n00:59:56,630 --> 01:00:01,970\nIt just jumps straight to that so\nI see documents, music, pictures, videos.\n\n1158\n01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:04,410\nThose are all the things that\nare a part of my profile and\n\n1159\n01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:07,970\nwe normally save our stuff into documents,\nright as we put a lot of things.\n\n1160\n01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:09,580\nAnd [COUGH] you know,\nI could go in there and\n\n1161\n01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:13,100\nstart to put in my business documents and\nso on.\n\n1162\n01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:17,660\nBut one of the problems with\nthe library is Microsoft,\n\n1163\n01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:22,620\nkind of the way it's setup, you have to\nmove your files into these libraries.\n\n1164\n01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:25,220\nBut what if you've been storing your\nfiles in one location for years and\n\n1165\n01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:25,740\nyears and years?\n\n1166\n01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:28,330\nYou don't wanna move where they are,\nyou're used to where they are.\n\n1167\n01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:32,250\nYou can actually link other\nlocations in like Ronnie said.\n\n1168\n01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:35,510\nNow, to link the locations,\nthey can be local files.\n\n1169\n01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:38,490\nYou can link local files in here,\nit's no big deal at all.\n\n1170\n01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:41,980\nOr you can link network files in, right.\n\n1171\n01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:44,940\nBut remember the key thing about network\nfiles, if you have network files\n\n1172\n01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:47,740\nlinked in, and you disconnect\nfrom the network and walk away,\n\n1173\n01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:51,360\nif you take your laptop home you're\nnot gonna have access to those files.\n\n1174\n01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:56,040\nSo before we link any kind of\nnetwork files into our libraries\n\n1175\n01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:59,000\nwe need to take a look at offline access.\n\n1176\n01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,370\nWith offline access we can make it\nwhether we're on or off the network,\n\n1177\n01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:07,130\nwe'll see those files and if we can tie\nthem into a library all the better, right?\n\n1178\n01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:09,930\nSo offline files are gonna\nbe a key piece of that.\n\n1179\n01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:13,000\nIn fact,\nlet's do this without offline files first.\n\n1180\n01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,520\nLet's just kinda see what\nit's like without it.\n\n1181\n01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:19,040\nWhen I go into Documents,\nI don't have much in here, right?\n\n1182\n01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,130\nMy Documents,\nmy Public Documents there, empty.\n\n1183\n01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:27,340\nAll right, now I've got, on my hard\ndrive If I browse into my hard drive,\n\n1184\n01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:30,870\nI've got that business documents folder,\nwhich was right on my C drive.\n\n1185\n01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:33,720\nSo there it is right there,\nbusiness documents, all right.\n\n1186\n01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:37,510\nNow, I could just drag and drop that into\nthe library, move it into the library.\n\n1187\n01:01:37,510 --> 01:01:42,110\nBut if I want it to be right here on the\nhard drive I can just link it in, right?\n\n1188\n01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:44,270\nAnd for a local drive,\nthat's gonna work just fine.\n\n1189\n01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:47,960\nI can take a library like Documents and\nI can right-click on that and\n\n1190\n01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:53,350\npull up the properties and it's gonna\nshow me the library locations and\n\n1191\n01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:56,030\nyou'll see where I can\ninclude another folder.\n\n1192\n01:01:57,110 --> 01:01:58,910\nAnd I can hit that Include,\nand I can browse and\n\n1193\n01:01:58,910 --> 01:02:01,260\npick another folder on my system.\n\n1194\n01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:03,610\nI could have also dragged and\ndropped the folder right here and\n\n1195\n01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:04,960\nit would have linked it automatically for\n\n1196\n01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,820\nme, but I like to do it this way it's\na little bit safer in my opinion.\n\n1197\n01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:12,670\nSo I'm just gonna browse and pick that\nbusiness docs and hit include folder.\n\n1198\n01:02:12,670 --> 01:02:16,850\nSo now,\nbusiness docs is included in this library.\n\n1199\n01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:20,190\nWhen I say apply, it's gonna pop\nthat one in there and I can say ok,\n\n1200\n01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:23,120\nand now I can see I've got some documents.\n\n1201\n01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:28,040\nWhen I click on that documents library,\nI see, My Documents,\n\n1202\n01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,910\nmy Public Documents, and\nmy Business Documents.\n\n1203\n01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:32,340\nIt didn't move them from where they are,\n\n1204\n01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:36,750\nthey're still in that same folder,\nbut they show up right here.\n\n1205\n01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:41,800\nSo, I've now got many locations In one\nplace, and I can see, there's those files,\n\n1206\n01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:45,120\nthe employee handbook and so on,\nall in line with the other directories.\n\n1207\n01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:47,380\nAnd it's displaying them separately here.\n\n1208\n01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:51,180\nYou don't have to do it that way, we could\nchange this from folder arrangement To\n\n1209\n01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:56,650\nthings like Name, and now I don't even\nknow that they're in different folders.\n\n1210\n01:02:56,650 --> 01:02:58,400\nI can move some of these, right?\n\n1211\n01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:03,880\nLike I can take this large NTFS one and\nI can move it into public documents and\n\n1212\n01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:08,350\nI can take this FAT32 one and\nI can move it into My Documents, right.\n\n1213\n01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:11,670\nWhen I look at the Documents library they\nall look like they're right here but\n\n1214\n01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:15,740\nwhen I go into My Documents,\nthere's the FAT32 file, Public Documents,\n\n1215\n01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:19,090\nthere's NTFS, Business docs,\nthere's the ones that are left.\n\n1216\n01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:24,080\nSo you can have more More than one\nlocation tied into any of these libraries.\n\n1217\n01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:25,790\n>> With these libraries,\n\n1218\n01:03:25,790 --> 01:03:30,350\nremember that in Windows there's always\nmore than one way to do the same thing.\n\n1219\n01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:31,964\nSo a lot of times you might go well,\n\n1220\n01:03:31,964 --> 01:03:34,320\nI don't know if I'll\nremember exactly all that.\n\n1221\n01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,648\nBut Don, if we could go back to your\npersonal documents on the other,\n\n1222\n01:03:36,648 --> 01:03:37,340\nWindows explorer?\n\n1223\n01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:39,153\n>> Oh, over here?\n\n1224\n01:03:39,153 --> 01:03:40,221\n>> Yeah.\n\n1225\n01:03:40,221 --> 01:03:42,356\nAnd if you just so, private docs.\n\n1226\n01:03:42,356 --> 01:03:43,327\nSo, private docs.\n>> There you go.\n\n1227\n01:03:43,327 --> 01:03:43,965\nMy.\n\n1228\n01:03:43,965 --> 01:03:48,162\nAnd up at the top you'll see this blue\nbar that says include in library.\n\n1229\n01:03:48,162 --> 01:03:50,910\nYou can actually also select that too,\nright there.\n\n1230\n01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:54,720\nThen you can just do that\nlinking automatically as well.\n\n1231\n01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,800\nAnd that will also add that in there too.\n\n1232\n01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,330\nSo there's always gonna be\nmultiple ways to do that.\n\n1233\n01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:01,050\nBut these libraries really do help.\n\n1234\n01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:01,610\nLike Don said,\n\n1235\n01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:05,680\nif you've been saving all your stuff\nin that business docs for years.\n\n1236\n01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:08,300\nAnd now they're saying you need\nto include this in your library.\n\n1237\n01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:11,980\nDon's not gonna wanna move that if he\nhas shared documents in there that other\n\n1238\n01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:16,900\npeople are linking to,\nby simply now linking it to his library.\n\n1239\n01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:20,740\nHe can just go to his my documents and\nit opens right up and he's fine.\n\n1240\n01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:23,210\nAnd all the users can still connect.\n\n1241\n01:04:23,210 --> 01:04:24,705\n>> Now what about a network location?\n\n1242\n01:04:24,705 --> 01:04:26,070\n>> Yeah.\n>> That's where things get a little\n\n1243\n01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:27,530\nweird, right?\n\n1244\n01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:31,970\nFor example, here at ITProTV, we install\na lot of virtual machines and to set those\n\n1245\n01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:37,160\nup I need a copy of the installation\nmedia, CD or DVD for an operating system.\n\n1246\n01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,870\nSo we've go a server that's back here.\n\n1247\n01:04:38,870 --> 01:04:40,472\nBehind the set-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1248\n01:04:40,472 --> 01:04:42,995\n>> That holds all the little CD images\n\n1249\n01:04:42,995 --> 01:04:44,350\nthat we need.\n\n1250\n01:04:44,350 --> 01:04:47,050\nIf I want to access those,\nI can browse to it and find them.\n\n1251\n01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:51,590\nBut I could include those in\none of my libraries too, right.\n\n1252\n01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:53,210\nSo let's say I wanted to do that.\n\n1253\n01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:56,110\nMaybe I want to create\na whole separate library.\n\n1254\n01:04:57,112 --> 01:05:01,320\nCuz ISO's don't really fall into one\nof these categories, like Disk Images.\n\n1255\n01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:07,770\nSo maybe I'll create an all New Library,\nand I'll call this one Disk Images.\n\n1256\n01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:11,450\nSo I've got Documents, Music,\nPictures, Videos, Disk Images.\n\n1257\n01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:13,890\nAnd if I expand that out,\nwell there's nothing under it.\n\n1258\n01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:16,430\nI haven't linked any folders to it yet.\n\n1259\n01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:19,920\nAnd if I want to link\na network location I can.\n\n1260\n01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,910\nIf I browse to that network location,\nso I'm just gonna go up here and\n\n1261\n01:05:22,910 --> 01:05:27,000\nI'll browse to backslash,\nbackslash vm host.\n\n1262\n01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,660\nThere we go, and here's this ISO folder,\nand if I browse in there,\n\n1263\n01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:32,102\nyou'll see all our software that we use.\n\n1264\n01:05:32,102 --> 01:05:35,910\nThere's CentoS or Microsoft Windows 7,\nWindows 8, whatever it is that\n\n1265\n01:05:35,910 --> 01:05:40,940\nwe're gonna be working with, those are the\nfiles that I need access to, all right?\n\n1266\n01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:46,160\nSo if I wanna link this to a library,\nwell we can, right?\n\n1267\n01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:49,820\nNo big deal there, we just go\nover to our Disc Images library,\n\n1268\n01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:54,250\nwe pull up its properties,\nand we include it right here.\n\n1269\n01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:55,850\nSo I'm gonna hit include a folder.\n\n1270\n01:05:55,850 --> 01:05:59,620\nNow when we go to include the folder we\ncan browse to it if we've mapped a drive\n\n1271\n01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:01,550\nletter to it,\nyou can browse to it that way.\n\n1272\n01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:06,340\nI'm gonna browse over the network,\nand I'll find that folder and\n\n1273\n01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:07,940\nI'll hit Include Folder.\n\n1274\n01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:10,650\nNow, I got an error, all right.\n\n1275\n01:06:10,650 --> 01:06:14,340\nAnd it's telling me it can't include\nit because it is not indexed.\n\n1276\n01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:18,430\nLibraries are automatically\nsearched whenever we\n\n1277\n01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:21,340\ntype into this search field\ndown here in this box.\n\n1278\n01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:23,950\nAnd so that's how it knows\nwhere to look for stuff.\n\n1279\n01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:25,570\nThis is a network resource.\n\n1280\n01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:26,690\nAnd it's not indexed.\n\n1281\n01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:28,330\nIt doesn't know to go and look for that.\n\n1282\n01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:30,600\nSo it's not gonna let me\nadd it to the library.\n\n1283\n01:06:31,930 --> 01:06:35,040\nDoesn't mean we can't do it,\nwe just need to index it.\n\n1284\n01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:40,210\nAnd the easiest way to do that,\nis to flag the file as available offline.\n\n1285\n01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:43,015\nThat offline access that\nwill have access to it\n\n1286\n01:06:43,015 --> 01:06:46,145\nregardless of whether we're connected or\nnot, that's what's gonna make it indexed.\n\n1287\n01:06:46,145 --> 01:06:47,335\nAnd that's what's gonna make it available.\n\n1288\n01:06:48,565 --> 01:06:49,315\nAll right?\n\n1289\n01:06:49,315 --> 01:06:51,915\nSo that's why we need to go and\nset that up.\n\n1290\n01:06:51,915 --> 01:06:55,775\nAnd the way I can do that is\nwhen I browse to that server,\n\n1291\n01:06:55,775 --> 01:07:02,397\nI can right-click on that folder, and\nyou'll see always available offline.\n\n1292\n01:07:02,397 --> 01:07:04,387\nNow, I need to be careful\nwith that here in this show,\n\n1293\n01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:06,807\nbecause how much data is in there, Ronnie?\n\n1294\n01:07:06,807 --> 01:07:07,755\nIt's,\n>> A lot.\n\n1295\n01:07:07,755 --> 01:07:08,857\n[LAUGH]\n>> About\n\n1296\n01:07:08,857 --> 01:07:09,636\n50 gigs-\n>> Yeah.\n\n1297\n01:07:09,636 --> 01:07:10,630\n>> Of data.\nI really don't want to\n\n1298\n01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:11,273\ncopy-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1299\n01:07:11,273 --> 01:07:12,360\n>> That much data over the network.\n\n1300\n01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,820\nMaybe I'll pick a different one.\n\n1301\n01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:14,993\nHow big is this lab files?\n\n1302\n01:07:14,993 --> 01:07:16,580\nThat looks pretty small.\n\n1303\n01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:19,803\n[COUGH] Oh, I'll probably regret this but\nlet's see how big that one is.\n\n1304\n01:07:19,803 --> 01:07:22,370\nSo lab files, it is.\n\n1305\n01:07:22,370 --> 01:07:25,681\nIs it not gonna tell me?\n\n1306\n01:07:25,681 --> 01:07:28,440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Could be big.\n\n1307\n01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,345\nIt's not a migration pull but\nyou never know on that.\n\n1308\n01:07:30,345 --> 01:07:31,340\n>> Yeah.\n\n1309\n01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:35,110\n>> So actually it doesn't look too bad.\n\n1310\n01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:35,766\nGame saves perfect.\n\n1311\n01:07:35,766 --> 01:07:36,632\n>> Oh, Yeah.\n>> We'll do this one.\n\n1312\n01:07:36,632 --> 01:07:41,222\nSo this a lab files folder, it's pretty\nsmall so that one will index pretty fast.\n\n1313\n01:07:41,222 --> 01:07:41,744\n>> Yup.\n\n1314\n01:07:41,744 --> 01:07:44,482\n>> So I can right-click on lab files and\n\n1315\n01:07:44,482 --> 01:07:49,440\nI can choose always available offline and\nwhen I do that.\n\n1316\n01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:53,020\nIt indexes it and\nit makes it available offline.\n\n1317\n01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:56,290\nAnd see how I've got that little\ngreen swirly circle right there?\n\n1318\n01:07:56,290 --> 01:07:57,750\nThat's letting me know that it's done.\n\n1319\n01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:59,830\nAnd now whenever I make a change,\n\n1320\n01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:02,540\nit's gonna synchronize it between\nmy computer and that one.\n\n1321\n01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:05,930\nAnd if I go offline,\nI'll still have access to it.\n\n1322\n01:08:05,930 --> 01:08:09,980\nAnd the cool part is,\nI can now add that into my library.\n\n1323\n01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:13,340\nSo I'll rename this library since it's not\nreally going to be disc images anymore,\n\n1324\n01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:14,410\nnow I'll call it Lab Files.\n\n1325\n01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:17,340\nSo this is where I'm going\nto store my lab files.\n\n1326\n01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:20,180\nAnd I'll include a folder.\n\n1327\n01:08:21,190 --> 01:08:24,250\nAnd I'm going to browse over that\nother server and pick lab files,\n\n1328\n01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:27,190\nwhich is now available offline,\nand when I hit include.\n\n1329\n01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:30,180\nIt didn't give me any hassle there,\ndid it?\n\n1330\n01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:32,300\nIt's indexed, it's available offline.\n\n1331\n01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:34,350\nNow regardless of whether\nI'm on the network or not,\n\n1332\n01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:36,550\nit's right there in my libraries.\n\n1333\n01:08:36,550 --> 01:08:39,074\nAnd I can get to it, and\nI don't have to go and\n\n1334\n01:08:39,074 --> 01:08:42,298\nsift through a bunch of\ndifferent locations to do that.\n\n1335\n01:08:42,298 --> 01:08:45,030\nAll right, so there's my stuff,\nit's right in there.\n\n1336\n01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:48,720\nAnd I can add in other lab file\nfolders if I needed to and\n\n1337\n01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:51,610\nI have them all available in one place.\n\n1338\n01:08:51,610 --> 01:08:54,860\nThe thing I really like about libraries\nis if you looked at all of this and\n\n1339\n01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:56,805\nsay while that's kind of pointless,\nI like where I save my stuff.\n\n1340\n01:08:56,805 --> 01:08:57,890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The nice thing I like\n\n1341\n01:08:57,890 --> 01:09:01,400\nabout Libraries is that Windows defaults\nto it for darn near everything.\n\n1342\n01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:07,460\nSo if you are in a program like Word pad,\nand you go to File and Open.\n\n1343\n01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:09,340\nWhen you go to open a data or\n\n1344\n01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:11,680\na connection,\nit takes you right to your library.\n\n1345\n01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:14,820\nSo if your data is linked right here,\nyou can get to your files very,\n\n1346\n01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:19,270\nvery quickly versus maybe I have\nto go down here to network.\n\n1347\n01:09:19,270 --> 01:09:22,040\nAnd I have to find the machine and\nmaybe the machine doesn't show up,\n\n1348\n01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:23,710\nlike I don't see that VM host here.\n\n1349\n01:09:23,710 --> 01:09:25,770\nSo I gotta go and type it in.\n\n1350\n01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:27,580\nSo it starts to become really\ndifficult to browse and\n\n1351\n01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:29,750\ndo that or\nmaybe I've gotta browse in my hard drive.\n\n1352\n01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:31,890\nSo I go to computer and C and\n\n1353\n01:09:31,890 --> 01:09:34,600\nstart browsing to find\nthe folder I'm looking for.\n\n1354\n01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,170\nThat gets to be a bit of a hassle.\n\n1355\n01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:37,870\nBut your libraries are right here.\n\n1356\n01:09:37,870 --> 01:09:44,400\nSo you can jump in, and you can find those\nfiles super quick, and there they are.\n\n1357\n01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:45,010\nAll right?\n\n1358\n01:09:45,010 --> 01:09:47,620\nSo easy enough to jump in there,\nget to the data.\n\n1359\n01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:48,569\nLibraries are pretty neat.\n\n1360\n01:09:50,112 --> 01:09:53,790\nAll right, so we took a look at offline\nfiles, we took a look at network\n\n1361\n01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:57,160\nlocations, and just adding multiple\nlocations to our libraries.\n\n1362\n01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,620\nThat's pretty much how they work.\n\n1363\n01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:02,150\nCan you think of anything else,\nany other troops there?\n\n1364\n01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:03,030\n>> No.\nYeah, I'm trying to think\n\n1365\n01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:05,930\nif there's any other thing that we didn't\ncover under our files and folders, but\n\n1366\n01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:07,180\nI think we've covered everything.\n\n1367\n01:10:08,562 --> 01:10:13,310\n>> So yes, we're in pretty good shape\nthere, there's one last thing that I\n\n1368\n01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:16,050\nnoticed that we didn't cover in the last\nsegment and I just wasn't to tackle here\n\n1369\n01:10:16,050 --> 01:10:20,620\nbefore we wrap this show up,\nI talked about sharing a printer earlier.\n\n1370\n01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:22,600\nAnd we never actually showed that.\n\n1371\n01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:26,210\nSo I wanna bring that up real quick,\njust to show you guys as an example.\n\n1372\n01:10:26,210 --> 01:10:29,300\nWhen you install a printer\non your Windows machine,\n\n1373\n01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:32,060\nit asks you if you want to share it,\nand most people say, yes.\n\n1374\n01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:33,640\nI did point that part out, right?\n\n1375\n01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:38,570\nSo If I go to Start > Devices and\nPrinters, I pointed out\n\n1376\n01:10:38,570 --> 01:10:41,910\nhow my printer had the two little\npeople on it, and it was checkered out.\n\n1377\n01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,400\nThe cool thing about Microsoft printers,\n\n1378\n01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:49,870\nis that they have what's called Click and\nPrint.\n\n1379\n01:10:49,870 --> 01:10:52,480\nIf somebody else wants\nto print to my printer.\n\n1380\n01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:55,640\nAll they have to do is browse\nto my computer on the network.\n\n1381\n01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:59,190\nSo we'll go to backslash\nbackslash JD Desktop and\n\n1382\n01:10:59,190 --> 01:11:00,660\nthey'll see my printer right there.\n\n1383\n01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:04,560\nAnd if they want to print to it,\nall they have to do is double-click and\n\n1384\n01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,590\nit will install the printer\non their machine.\n\n1385\n01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:09,540\nIt'll install the printer and its drivers.\n\n1386\n01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:13,730\nThey don't have to provide a driver disk,\nit just knocks it right out, installs it.\n\n1387\n01:11:13,730 --> 01:11:17,620\nAnd now they can print to my printer,\nunless I turn my computer off, right?\n\n1388\n01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:22,020\nSo that functionality is super easy,\nworks really well.\n\n1389\n01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:23,040\nBut there's a slight problem.\n\n1390\n01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,670\nWhen you install Windows,\nyou make a choice.\n\n1391\n01:11:26,670 --> 01:11:29,855\nDo you want to install the 64\nbit version of Windows or\n\n1392\n01:11:29,855 --> 01:11:31,804\nthe 32 bit version of Windows?\n\n1393\n01:11:31,804 --> 01:11:37,497\nSo when you add that printer,\nit's gonna add the 32 bit driver or\n\n1394\n01:11:37,497 --> 01:11:40,963\n64 bit driver based on your decision.\n\n1395\n01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:46,290\nWell what if you're 64-bit and somebody\nelse is 32-bit and they wanna connect?\n\n1396\n01:11:46,290 --> 01:11:50,100\nWell then, you don't have the driver, and\nwhen they double click on your printer,\n\n1397\n01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:51,890\nit won't be able to do the click and\nprint.\n\n1398\n01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:55,230\nIt'll have to install a driver, and\nthey'll have to go and download it.\n\n1399\n01:11:55,230 --> 01:11:59,710\nIf you want to avoid that, when you\nshare printers it's a good idea to\n\n1400\n01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:03,430\nadd any additional drivers\nthat are necessary, all right?\n\n1401\n01:12:03,430 --> 01:12:06,210\nAnd it's not immediately\nobvious how to do that, and\n\n1402\n01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:08,039\nthat's why I wanted to\nshow it here real quick.\n\n1403\n01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:12,570\nIf we go to start, and\ndevices and printers,\n\n1404\n01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:18,160\nyou'll see each of your printers that are\nin there, and if I click on Lexmark A323,\n\n1405\n01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:23,600\nright up here at the top I'll\nsee print server properties.\n\n1406\n01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,269\nWhen you're sharing a printer with\nother people, you're a server,\n\n1407\n01:12:26,269 --> 01:12:29,920\nyou're a print server,\neverybody else is your print client.\n\n1408\n01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,540\nThey're connecting to you.\n\n1409\n01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:33,880\nSo I need to go into my\nprint server properties and\n\n1410\n01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:37,050\nit's in here that we'll see\nthe drivers that we've loaded.\n\n1411\n01:12:37,050 --> 01:12:39,515\nI'm running the 64-bit version of Windows.\n\n1412\n01:12:39,515 --> 01:12:44,615\nSo when I look down here, I'll see\nthe Lexmark E323 64-bit driver, x64.\n\n1413\n01:12:44,615 --> 01:12:47,705\nI don't see the 32-bit one.\n\n1414\n01:12:47,705 --> 01:12:49,515\nSo if I wanna make it easier for\n\n1415\n01:12:49,515 --> 01:12:52,105\nother people on my network\nthat are running 32-bit,\n\n1416\n01:12:52,105 --> 01:12:55,375\nI need to add that driver and you'll see\nright down here where we can add it in.\n\n1417\n01:12:56,435 --> 01:13:00,030\nAnd you can hit Add and\nfeed it into the system.\n\n1418\n01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:01,930\nSo here it's asking what I'm adding, and\n\n1419\n01:13:01,930 --> 01:13:04,098\nI can say that I'm going\nto add the 32-bit one.\n\n1420\n01:13:04,098 --> 01:13:05,950\nNow, 32-bit, they call it x86,\n\n1421\n01:13:05,950 --> 01:13:10,790\nbecause it was developed under\nthe Intel 286, 386, 486 processors.\n\n1422\n01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:12,718\nSo that's why they call it x86.\n\n1423\n01:13:12,718 --> 01:13:17,558\nBut the 64-bit stuff was designed by AMD,\nand so they call it, x64.\n\n1424\n01:13:17,558 --> 01:13:22,678\nIt's weird naming, doesn't really\nmatch up, but x86 means 32-bit.\n\n1425\n01:13:22,678 --> 01:13:26,188\nSo I can check that and hit Next and\nnow it's gonna look and\n\n1426\n01:13:26,188 --> 01:13:29,640\nsee if it's already got the driver and\nit may or may not.\n\n1427\n01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,040\nAnd we'll see if it does, right?\n\n1428\n01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,360\nSo I did a Lexmark.\n\n1429\n01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:36,280\nIf it does, it will load it\nright from here and we're done.\n\n1430\n01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:39,780\nIf it doesn't,\nI'll need to go to Lexmark's webpage and\n\n1431\n01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:44,060\ndownload the 32-bit driver and use this\nHave Disk button to give it to it, but\n\n1432\n01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:46,630\nwe'll see if it's actually\ngot it built in here.\n\n1433\n01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:49,590\nAnd it looks like it does.\n\n1434\n01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:52,770\nSo when I finish that,\noh, no it doesn't, shoot.\n\n1435\n01:13:52,770 --> 01:13:56,370\nSo it didn't have the 32-bit driver,\nit's asking for the disc, so\n\n1436\n01:13:56,370 --> 01:13:58,630\nnow I'm gonna have to go\nto Lexmark's webpage and\n\n1437\n01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:01,840\ndownload the 32-bit driver\nto provide that, all right?\n\n1438\n01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:06,700\nSo just be aware of that if you've\ngot mixed 32-bit and 64-bit machines.\n\n1439\n01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:09,070\nWhenever you install a printer,\nyou'll probably wanna come and\n\n1440\n01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:12,070\nadd this second driver\nto have it in there.\n\n1441\n01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:14,700\nIf you're all 64-bit,\nthen you don't have to worry about it.\n\n1442\n01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,110\nOr if you're all 32-bit.\n\n1443\n01:14:16,110 --> 01:14:18,850\nBut if you've got a mixture, it's\na good idea to add those extra drivers.\n\n1444\n01:14:21,010 --> 01:14:23,280\nSomething I meant to mention when\nwe were talking about printers and\n\n1445\n01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:25,550\nI forgot, so I'm sorry about that.\n\n1446\n01:14:25,550 --> 01:14:27,294\nBut we got it in here so anyway.\n\n1447\n01:14:27,294 --> 01:14:31,280\nAll right Ronnie can you think of\nanything else we might want to throw in?\n\n1448\n01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:34,940\n>> No yeah on the files in folder I\ncan't really think of anything else,\n\n1449\n01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:36,200\nI think we've covered it pretty well.\n\n1450\n01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:37,100\n>> Sweet.\n\n1451\n01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:40,180\nAll right, well, let me remind you guys,\nas you practice with this and\n\n1452\n01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:42,870\nexperiment with it,\nyou might have some questions.\n\n1453\n01:14:42,870 --> 01:14:44,700\nIf you do, feel free

00:00:08.417\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.417 --> 00:00:11.299\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.744\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another exciting\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.744 --> 00:00:17.202\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong and\n\n7\n00:00:17.202 --> 00:00:20.970\ntoday we're talking a look at Windows\noperating system fundamentals.\n\n8\n00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.790\nMore specifically, diving into the realm\nof file permissions, we're also gonna take\n\n9\n00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.380\na look of course at file systems as\nwell as the idea of sharing, and\n\n10\n00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.580\nwho better to help us than Mr Wes Brien,\nWes, welcome back to our studio.\n\n11\n00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.320\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me Ronnie, as always\ngreat to be here, and that's right,\n\n12\n00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.680\nwe gotta figure out well, we've got\nthis hard drive, what do we have to do\n\n13\n00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.560\nto ensure that we can use it, so\nthat's what we're gonna be looking at,\n\n14\n00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.940\nlike Ronnie said, we're gonna be looking\nat something known as file systems.\n\n15\n00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.750\nA way pretty much that you can apply a\nlogical structure to a physical device in\n\n16\n00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.660\norder to use it.\n\n17\n00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.000\nWe'll also be looking at\na way to secure the data,\n\n18\n00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.850\nensuring that only the people that you\nwanna have access to that information\n\n19\n00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.530\nhave access to that information.\n\n20\n00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.920\nAnd we'll also look at how you can make\nsome of those resources available to users\n\n21\n00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.130\nthat are connected to a network.\n\n22\n00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.620\nSo if that's what you would like to\nlearn about, that's what you're in for\n\n23\n00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.520\nhere in this episode.\n\n24\n00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.290\nSo let's go ahead, and what we're\ngonna do is we're gonna kick this off,\n\n25\n00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.900\ntalking about file systems.\n\n26\n00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.390\nAnd what is a file system?\n\n27\n00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.270\nWell, kinda like I said, It's a way\nthat you can take this physical device,\n\n28\n00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.330\nlay kind of like and architecture over it,\na logical architecture over it so\n\n29\n00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.900\nthat you can now structure in a way\nthat you can use it and store data.\n\n30\n00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.860\nFile systems have been around for a while,\nI mean when we talk about electronic\n\n31\n00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.680\ncomputing they go way back to\nthe earlier days of computing.\n\n32\n00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.980\nBut we're not gonna go so\n\n33\n00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.420\nfar back because we certainly don't\nwant to give you a history lesson here.\n\n34\n00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.730\nWe wanna look at the ones that are gonna\nbe more important inside of Windows.\n\n35\n00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.890\nSo I've got a little bit\nof a diagram here and.\n\n36\n00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.620\nI tell you, I said no history here but\n\n37\n00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.840\nwe'll go back just a little\nbit in time right.\n\n38\n00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.380\nNo flux capacitor here or DeLorians.\n\n39\n00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.630\nBut we're gonna talk about\nsomething known as FAT.\n\n40\n00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.990\nFile allocation table.\n\n41\n00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.430\nNow file allocation table,\n\n42\n00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.800\nwhen we talk about going back we're\ntalking about it was the original\n\n43\n00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.590\nfile system for the disk operating\nsystem that we commonly call DOS.\n\n44\n00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.061\nIt goes back to the earliest\ndays of Windows, Windows 3.11,\n\n45\n00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:09.730\n3.1, 3.1.1 And I don't want you\nto worry about it on the exam,\n\n46\n00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:12.250\nand I don't want you to worry about\nit inside of Windows cuz we largely\n\n47\n00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.320\ndo not use this at all outside of\nmaybe seeing it in action in a museum.\n\n48\n00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.890\nHowever, there is another one\nhere that we're gonna look at.\n\n49\n00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.085\nWe're gonna look at\nwhat Is known as FAT32.\n\n50\n00:02:22.085 --> 00:02:26.745\nNow FAT32 was the successor to\nthe earlier file allocation table,\n\n51\n00:02:26.745 --> 00:02:29.475\nand it had benefits in its day.\n\n52\n00:02:29.475 --> 00:02:32.655\nSo I don't wanna sit here and\nsound like, stay away from FAT32,\n\n53\n00:02:32.655 --> 00:02:37.895\nbecause it is supported by pretty much\nall of the major operating systems.\n\n54\n00:02:37.895 --> 00:02:40.895\nDoesn't matter if you have a UNIX system,\nif you have a Linux system,\n\n55\n00:02:40.895 --> 00:02:45.360\nif you have Mac,\nif you have Windows you can use FAT32.\n\n56\n00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.180\nAnd so, it does lend itself to that.\n\n57\n00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.670\nHowever, it does have some limitations,\nright?\n\n58\n00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.090\nEven though it allows you to scale\nup to larger drives than its earlier\n\n59\n00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.110\npredecessor, it does have limitations in\nthe fact that when you have a hard drive,\n\n60\n00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.680\nyour hard drive can't have\na single container in it.\n\n61\n00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.820\nWe call them partitions,\nbigger than two terabytes, right?\n\n62\n00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.010\nI want you to think of,\nwhen we talk about storing data,\n\n63\n00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.430\nkeep in mind that we\napply the file system.\n\n64\n00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.920\nAnd the file system pretty much tells\nus how we can structure the drive.\n\n65\n00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.590\nSo that's one of the limitations to\nstructuring your drive, if you will,\n\n66\n00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.200\nwith FAT32.\n\n67\n00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.410\nIs the fact that any one little individual\ndivision or partition inside or\n\n68\n00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.770\nyou might even hear the term volume,\nit can't exceed 2 terabytes.\n\n69\n00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.090\nNow the other thing we have to worry\nabout with FAT32 is the fact that it only\n\n70\n00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.290\nhas file sizes as large as 4 gigs.\n\n71\n00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.090\nNow, when FAT32 came out, this actually\nwasn't really too much of a concern.\n\n72\n00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.544\nIn fact, probably at that time a 4\ngig file would be unheard of, but\n\n73\n00:03:47.544 --> 00:03:52.235\nwith today's day and age where we\nhave things like Blu-Ray that stores\n\n74\n00:03:52.235 --> 00:03:55.297\na lot of data,\nwe have high definition video.\n\n75\n00:03:55.297 --> 00:04:01.910\nYou can really get into file sizes\nthat exceed 4 gigs, really easy.\n\n76\n00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.620\nSo It does have those limitations, but\nkeep in mind the advantages that it does\n\n77\n00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.990\nhave an interoperability with\nall the major operating systems.\n\n78\n00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.210\nThe other thing that it lacks is\nsomething known as built-in security.\n\n79\n00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.520\nI told you that we're gonna learn\nhow we can secure that data,\n\n80\n00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.860\nwe can make sure that the data\nthat's on your machine,\n\n81\n00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.780\nunauthorized users don't\ngain access to it.\n\n82\n00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.880\nAnd now when I say unauthorized,\nI'm not even talking about hacking, but\n\n83\n00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.070\nI'm talking about somebody\nthat logs into the machine.\n\n84\n00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.960\nSo what we're gonna look at are the two\nthat you will find in Windows today.\n\n85\n00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.510\nNow the one that we use in Windows that\nwas essentially the successor to FAT32,\n\n86\n00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.280\nit's called NTFS.\n\n87\n00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.620\nNTFS, new technology file system,\nisn't so new anymore.\n\n88\n00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.310\nIt's been around for a while and\n\n89\n00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.090\nit's gone through several revisions\nas it's progressed in its lifetime.\n\n90\n00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.550\nNow with NTFS, one of the things\nthat you get the advantage of\n\n91\n00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.898\nis you get the ability to\nuse built-in security.\n\n92\n00:04:54.898 --> 00:04:59.140\nAnd by built-in security, I mean we can\nnow apply something known as an ACL,\n\n93\n00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.630\nan access control list.\n\n94\n00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.050\nWith the access control list,\n\n95\n00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.470\nwe are going to be able to apply\npermissions to our files and folders.\n\n96\n00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.470\nNow don't let that term permission,\nright now don't worry about it,\n\n97\n00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.660\nbecause we'll come back to it,\nwe'll talk about it.\n\n98\n00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.980\nHowever, you can also add something\nknown as encryption to your files.\n\n99\n00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.080\nWhen you add encryption this is a way\nthat you can scramble the data so\n\n100\n00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.040\nonly the people that have a certain\nalgorithm built into the machine\n\n101\n00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.180\ncan gain access to it, so encryption is\na good way to secure that data making sure\n\n102\n00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.800\nagain on top of it with file\npermissions you get that security.\n\n103\n00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.408\nNow the last thing I want to kind of\nmention about NTFS is that it also has\n\n104\n00:05:34.408 --> 00:05:36.619\nsomething known as built in compression.\n\n105\n00:05:36.619 --> 00:05:41.045\nAnd when NTFS first came out the drive\nsizes weren't as large as they are today\n\n106\n00:05:41.045 --> 00:05:45.062\nbecause we do have drives today that\nare one terabyte, two terabyte,\n\n107\n00:05:45.062 --> 00:05:47.717\nfour terabyte,\nin fact I think Ronnie and I and\n\n108\n00:05:47.717 --> 00:05:52.040\nsome of the other hosts have even seen\nsome now as large as eight terabytes.\n\n109\n00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.090\nI mean that's just amazing\nhow big the drives are.\n\n110\n00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.370\nSo you might not think in today's day and\n\n111\n00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.670\nage that compression is really\nsomething that's necessary.\n\n112\n00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.610\nBut in the earlier days when NTFS first\ncame out it gave you the ability to take\n\n113\n00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.320\na large amount of data and\n\n114\n00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.220\njust basically think about it scrunching\nit down in order to save disk space.\n\n115\n00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.440\nSo how you were storing that data would\nmake it a little bit more efficient.\n\n116\n00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.020\nYou could get a little\nbit more data on there,\n\n117\n00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.810\nagain, through the compression process.\n\n118\n00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.130\nNow, the next one I want\nto mention is still\n\n119\n00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.150\nkind of trying to mature if you will.\n\n120\n00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.620\nIt's there who knows,\nhere in a couple of years,\n\n121\n00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.020\nwe might see a completely replace\nNTFS as the default file system.\n\n122\n00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.160\nNot sure if that's gonna happen yet,\nbecause it's still relatively new.\n\n123\n00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.580\nAnd that's something called\nthe resilient file system, ReFS.\n\n124\n00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.580\nNow where we see this today inside of our\noperating systems is really only in one\n\n125\n00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.990\ntechnology, and\nthat's something called storage spaces.\n\n126\n00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:51.580\nThat gives you the ability to\nmake these fault tolerant type of\n\n127\n00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.340\nstorage containers in which\nthe resilient file system,\n\n128\n00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.610\nReFS can move data around if one\nof those drives becomes corrupted.\n\n129\n00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.190\nIt also has some really,\nreally cool techniques that are built in,\n\n130\n00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.670\ntechnologies that give you an advantage.\n\n131\n00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.964\nIn fact, it says it talks about\nperforming online file repairs.\n\n132\n00:07:09.964 --> 00:07:12.770\nLet me talk about this real quick.\n\n133\n00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.060\nThis is kinda cool.\n\n134\n00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.600\nIt has what's known, built into it,\nas salvage operations, okay?\n\n135\n00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.460\nDon't worry about that\nterm salvage operation.\n\n136\n00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.675\nIt just means that this file system\nis actively monitoring itself.\n\n137\n00:07:22.675 --> 00:07:24.920\nBut if there's a portion of unrecoverable,\n\n138\n00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:29.370\ncorrupted data, it says, let me get rid\nof that data on the fly, get rid of it.\n\n139\n00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.110\nBecause we don't want that\ndata corrupting good data.\n\n140\n00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.710\nSo that's really kinda cool.\n\n141\n00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.590\nThe other thing is it can\nmake online repairs to data.\n\n142\n00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.320\nSo if it gets to a point where it can\nfind data that maybe is corrupted, but\n\n143\n00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.360\nit can try to repair it,\nit'll do it on the fly.\n\n144\n00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.039\nSo that's really a good thing.\n\n145\n00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:47.371\nSo how do we do we even\napply these file systems?\n\n146\n00:07:47.371 --> 00:07:50.334\nLet's go ahead and let's dive down and\nlets show you here,\n\n147\n00:07:50.334 --> 00:07:53.188\nI got a Windows machine here,\nlooks like I have to log in.\n\n148\n00:07:53.188 --> 00:07:57.506\nAren't you guys glad you I can teach\nyou how to log into a machine.\n\n149\n00:07:57.506 --> 00:08:00.385\nWe're gonna go ahead and what we're\ngonna do is we're gonna right-click and\n\n150\n00:08:00.385 --> 00:08:01.749\nwe're gonna go to Disk Management.\n\n151\n00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:03.705\nRight now in Disk Management,\n\n152\n00:08:03.705 --> 00:08:07.241\nthis is where we get the ability\nto make modifications or\n\n153\n00:08:07.241 --> 00:08:12.415\napply these file systems I should say,\nto the storage that we have, right.\n\n154\n00:08:12.415 --> 00:08:15.755\nAnd I can see right away that you can see\nthat we have some containers in here that\n\n155\n00:08:15.755 --> 00:08:16.955\nare called partitions, right.\n\n156\n00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:20.340\nJust a logical division of a larger space.\n\n157\n00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:23.040\nAnd you can see things like NTFS.\n\n158\n00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.580\nYou can see NTFS here, so again NTFS\n\n159\n00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:31.160\nreally comes down to the dominant\nfile system inside of Windows today.\n\n160\n00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.310\nBut I want you to notice something,\n\n161\n00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:34.890\nnotice that we have this\nunallocated space right here.\n\n162\n00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:36.190\nWell what does that mean?\n\n163\n00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:39.120\nWell that means, remember I told\nyou that applying a file system\n\n164\n00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.260\nis applying a logical\nstructure to a storage device?\n\n165\n00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.880\nThis doesn't have that logical structure.\n\n166\n00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.400\nIt's just kinda sitting there, and\nwhat do we want to do with it?\n\n167\n00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.010\nSo what we're gonna go ahead and\ndo here, is we're gonna go ahead and\n\n168\n00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:51.920\nwe're gonna right-click on this.\n\n169\n00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.840\nAnd we're gonna choose something\ncalled New Simple Volume.\n\n170\n00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.590\nAnd when you look at our\nNew Simple Volume Wizard that we have,\n\n171\n00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:02.660\nthis gives the abilities to start applying\nthat architecture to the hard drive.\n\n172\n00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.790\nFor instance,\nI can choose next here, all right.\n\n173\n00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:10.080\nNotice that it's telling me what is\nthe maximum space here on this disk?\n\n174\n00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.860\nNow guys, this is 10 gigs,\nI know it seems a little strange here,\n\n175\n00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.410\nyour disk space could be 2 terabytes,\nright?\n\n176\n00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:20.290\nSo that's always relative to\nwhatever the storage device is.\n\n177\n00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:25.620\nUnderstand that this will also apply if I\nplugged a USB Drive that was 10 gigs or\n\n178\n00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.650\nsomething, a little thumb drive in here.\n\n179\n00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.090\nThe same process would apply.\n\n180\n00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:33.730\nSo this is a really good way to learn\nhow to prepare a storage location so\n\n181\n00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:35.110\nthat you can use it.\n\n182\n00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:36.060\nWe can change it.\n\n183\n00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:36.980\nI'm not going to change it.\n\n184\n00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:41.750\nI'm going to go ahead and\nleave the entire default size on this and\n\n185\n00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:44.170\nwe'll go ahead and\nwe'll choose next in the Wizard.\n\n186\n00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:47.310\nAnd now we get the ability to set\nwhat's known as a drive letter,\n\n187\n00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.210\nin fact,\nas long as I don't click off of that.\n\n188\n00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:52.480\nAll right, now the drive letter,\nwhat is that about?\n\n189\n00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.820\nOkay, so we apply a file system but we\nalso need what's known as a mount point.\n\n190\n00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.750\nWe need a front door, if you will,\ninto the storage location, right?\n\n191\n00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.770\nIf I, for instance,\nif I'm building a house,\n\n192\n00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:05.040\nI could build the whole entire house,\nright?\n\n193\n00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.690\nHave it prepared, but if I don't give it\na front door, you can't use the house.\n\n194\n00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.260\nDoesn't matter what's on the inside.\n\n195\n00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.010\nSo consider your mount point as a way to\n\n196\n00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:16.900\nkinda give your storage location an entry\npoint so that you can start using it.\n\n197\n00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.880\nAnd also an identifier, so\nI know where this drive is.\n\n198\n00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.750\nAnd you'll see that in a second.\n\n199\n00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.680\nSo we'll go ahead and\nI am just going to leave the default.\n\n200\n00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.620\nYou'll see that you have a lot of choices.\n\n201\n00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.110\nPretty much the entire alphabet.\n\n202\n00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.800\nEarlier days of DOS,\nyou couldn't use A and\n\n203\n00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.380\nB in things like FAT32 because those\nare always defaulted to your floppy disk.\n\n204\n00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.600\nToday that is not even a problem here.\n\n205\n00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.410\nSo, I'll just leave\nthe next sequential letter.\n\n206\n00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:47.010\nChoose Next, and here's where we\nstart to get our options, right.\n\n207\n00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:49.470\nNow if I don't format this volume,\nit'd be the opposite way.\n\n208\n00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:52.060\nIt'd be like given a front door, but\nthere's nothing behind the door.\n\n209\n00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.540\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nformat that, and\n\n210\n00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:59.280\nthat process of formatting is applying\nthat logical structure to the hard drive.\n\n211\n00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.380\nNow, notice that I get two options.\n\n212\n00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.860\nRemember I told you don't worry about FAT.\n\n213\n00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.000\nDon't worry about FAT in\nyour operating systems.\n\n214\n00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.500\nNotice that REFS isn't an option here.\n\n215\n00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.961\nThat's because right now at this point\nit's only used in a technology called\n\n216\n00:11:11.961 --> 00:11:15.545\nstorage spaces so it's really the only\nplace that you get to see it, all right.\n\n217\n00:11:15.545 --> 00:11:18.385\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna choose NTFS\n\n218\n00:11:18.385 --> 00:11:23.830\njust because I want to take advantage\nof the security that's built into NTFS.\n\n219\n00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:27.860\nNow I could if I want give it\na volume label, and that's up to you,\n\n220\n00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.230\nit will default to new volume.\n\n221\n00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:35.960\nYour C drive is by default has\na volume label of local disk, right?\n\n222\n00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.540\nI'm going to go ahead and\nI'll just call this NTFS.\n\n223\n00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.380\nReally when it comes down to it,\nI'm not really a fan of volume labels.\n\n224\n00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:48.820\nBecause I've got the mount point right,\nI've got E, I know where it is.\n\n225\n00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.750\nThat's up to you,\nthat's a personal preference.\n\n226\n00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:52.560\nIt's not something I would\nworry about on the exam and\n\n227\n00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:56.420\nit's certainly not something that's going\nto effect the storage device itself.\n\n228\n00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:01.305\nAll right, now the next thing I\nwant you to notice is that we\n\n229\n00:12:01.305 --> 00:12:06.214\nhave this option, and\nthis one of the advantages of NTFS.\n\n230\n00:12:06.214 --> 00:12:08.990\nNotice I get file and\nfolder level compression, all right.\n\n231\n00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:13.401\nWhat that means is that if I turn this on,\nI can scrunch that data,\n\n232\n00:12:13.401 --> 00:12:15.568\nany data that I'm storing up and\n\n233\n00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:20.640\nI can save what is known as the on-disk\nstorage size of that file or folder.\n\n234\n00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.840\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna enable that.\n\n235\n00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.440\nAnd the other one,\nlet's not take it for granted.\n\n236\n00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:31.030\nI always breeze past this sometimes\njust not thinking about it anymore.\n\n237\n00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.630\nBut I can't assume that\nyou guys would do that.\n\n238\n00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:36.860\nWhat's the different between a quick\nformat or if I uncheck this?\n\n239\n00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:38.760\nWell a quick format does exactly that.\n\n240\n00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.350\nIt just lays that architecture,\nthat structure,\n\n241\n00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:45.990\nright over the storage container or\nstorage device.\n\n242\n00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:49.090\nIf I uncheck this, well,\nwhat's a full format?\n\n243\n00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:50.360\nWell a full format,\n\n244\n00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:55.600\nalso, underneath runs a utility that's\nbuilt into windows called chkdsk.\n\n245\n00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:01.230\nAnd what it does is, ahead of the format,\nit's checking every location within this\n\n246\n00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:06.630\ndrive to see if there's any pre-existing\ncorruption in the storage medium itself.\n\n247\n00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:11.440\nAnd if it finds it, it marks those areas\nas bad so that we don't apply files and\n\n248\n00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.890\nfolders to it later.\n\n249\n00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:15.150\nHowever, if you've got a brand new disk,\n\n250\n00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:18.380\na lot of times you don't have to use that\nand that's what we're gonna do here.\n\n251\n00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:19.640\nBut make up your choice,\n\n252\n00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.240\nbecause if you're in a production\nenvironment, you might want to run this.\n\n253\n00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:23.860\nThat's up to you.\n\n254\n00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.140\nKeep in mind that if it's a huge drive,\n\n255\n00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:32.700\nyour format's not gonna go nearly as\nquick as what you're gonna see here.\n\n256\n00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.440\nNow don't overlook the summary panes.\n\n257\n00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.470\nIn Windows, or even if you go\non into server administration,\n\n258\n00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:39.670\nthese summary panes are here for you.\n\n259\n00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.710\nIt gives you a chance\nto just check through.\n\n260\n00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:46.360\nFigure out did I assign this the way\nI want I got a Simple Volume.\n\n261\n00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.030\nIt's on the disk that I want.\n\n262\n00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:49.560\nThe whole entire Volume size.\n\n263\n00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:50.600\nIn this case.\n\n264\n00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.790\nI can see the Drive letter or path, right?\n\n265\n00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.340\nPath like the front door into the house.\n\n266\n00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:57.960\nI can see what the file system is.\n\n267\n00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.390\nI can see the Volume label.\n\n268\n00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:02.360\nQuick format and file compression and\nfolder compression.\n\n269\n00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.020\nAnd we choose to format it.\n\n270\n00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:05.910\nAnd just like that.\n\n271\n00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.170\nWe have our file system.\n\n272\n00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:11.050\nAnd Ronnie, that really when it comes\ndown to file systems, that's how we can\n\n273\n00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:15.110\napply that structure, and\nwe now have a container that we can use.\n\n274\n00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:18.150\nIf I was to open up\nthe file explorer here,\n\n275\n00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:23.640\nif you guys see down here on the bottom,\nI now have a hard drive that I can use.\n\n276\n00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.974\nI now have this storage location that\nif I wanted, I could come in here and\n\n277\n00:14:27.974 --> 00:14:30.899\nI could start just creating documents,\nright?\n\n278\n00:14:30.899 --> 00:14:36.010\nSo this is my text document because\nI'm very creative on this one.\n\n279\n00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:38.580\nBut Ronnie, now we've got a hard drive.\n\n280\n00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:41.730\nIt's ready to go, we can put it in\nbusiness and we can start using it.\n\n281\n00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:45.760\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt Wes that there's a lot\nof information here for file systems.\n\n282\n00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.580\nOne of the key elements to remember\nespecially if you're unfamiliar with\n\n283\n00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:53.050\nthe idea of file systems is what happens\nif you don't have a file system?\n\n284\n00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:56.630\nYou can have a hard drive but\nit means you can't store data onto it.\n\n285\n00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:00.266\nAnd the reason why you can't store data on\nto it is that even if you're able to put\n\n286\n00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:02.220\ndata on it, it doesn't leave any place for\n\n287\n00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:05.515\nsomebody to be able to identify\nwhere to retrieve that data.\n\n288\n00:15:05.515 --> 00:15:07.695\nSo a file system is exactly\nlike it sounds like.\n\n289\n00:15:07.695 --> 00:15:10.135\nIt's a system that's\nactually put in place so\n\n290\n00:15:10.135 --> 00:15:13.385\nthat when the operating system\nsays we need this particular file.\n\n291\n00:15:13.385 --> 00:15:16.535\nThe example that Wes gave us,\nthere, is the text file.\n\n292\n00:15:16.535 --> 00:15:19.315\nThat there are pointers that\nthe operating system can look for\n\n293\n00:15:19.315 --> 00:15:24.370\nand then find that file regardless of\nwhat partition it may be on as well.\n\n294\n00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:29.420\nAnd so Wes also showed us the example\nhere of actually using FAT32 or NTFS.\n\n295\n00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.760\nNTFS is usually the preferred and\nkinda the default today.\n\n296\n00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:35.060\nEven on the installation of Windows.\n\n297\n00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:39.130\nSo normally the only reason why\nyou should choose FAT32 today,\n\n298\n00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:43.054\nis if you have a special reason for\nyou not to actually run NTFS.\n\n299\n00:15:43.054 --> 00:15:47.360\nAnd you're saying I don't even know\nwhy I would then choose FAT32.\n\n300\n00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.108\nThere are instances though Wes\nin which we might do that.\n\n301\n00:15:50.108 --> 00:15:55.028\nFor example I'm actually on\na Macintosh notebook or a laptop.\n\n302\n00:15:55.028 --> 00:15:58.891\nRight, well,\nthat one doesn't really recognize NTFS.\n\n303\n00:15:58.891 --> 00:16:01.288\nSo if I wanted to move\nfiles between there,\n\n304\n00:16:01.288 --> 00:16:03.696\nwouldn't I actually have to use FAT32?\n\n305\n00:16:03.696 --> 00:16:07.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you would, because, again,\nwe're talking about an interoperability.\n\n306\n00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.400\nAnd I'm glad you mentioned about,\nsometimes we do need to use FAT32.\n\n307\n00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.930\nI can give you another example.\n\n308\n00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.610\nIf you guys are going on to\nlater Windows 10 training, and\n\n309\n00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:16.790\nyou start to get into\nthings like deployment.\n\n310\n00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:19.380\nWell, we have something known\nas the Windows PE disk.\n\n311\n00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:22.300\nAnd the Windows PE disk,\nwhen it's set up, it needs to be set up\n\n312\n00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.590\non a device that's formatted in FAT32,\nwhich is kinda interesting.\n\n313\n00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:29.180\nBecause like Ronnie said, if I was to do\na default installation of Windows and\n\n314\n00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.110\njust next, next, next,\n\n315\n00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:34.110\nnext right through the wizard,\ndon't pick anything he's right, it's NTFS.\n\n316\n00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:37.990\nSo again that's one of the benefits of\nFAT32 is like he is mentioning here that\n\n317\n00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:42.870\nwe do get an interoperability and we can\nmove files and folders in between systems.\n\n318\n00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:47.040\nKeep in mind though it lacks the ability\nto follow things like corruption.\n\n319\n00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.530\nSorry, if your files get corrupted,\nthey get corrupted.\n\n320\n00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:54.270\nAnd they also don't get the advantage\nof the built-in security as well.\n\n321\n00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:55.540\n&gt;&gt; All right Wes, you also mentioned,\n\n322\n00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:59.810\nalong with the idea here of using\nsomething like NTFS, that it not only gave\n\n323\n00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:03.900\nthat advantage of compression and\nthat ability but also file permission.\n\n324\n00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.890\nSo Wes,\nwhat do we need to take a look at here?\n\n325\n00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:09.040\n&gt;&gt; All right, well when it comes to file\npermissions, there are a series of file\n\n326\n00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.310\npermissions that we want you\nto be aware of for the exam.\n\n327\n00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:16.710\nI tell you what, in fact,\nRonnie taught me this many years ago.\n\n328\n00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:20.870\nIf you're not familiar with permissions\nyou'll probably have trouble on\n\n329\n00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:23.110\nevery single exam that you can take.\n\n330\n00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:24.540\nEspecially in the Windows world.\n\n331\n00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:27.390\nSo this is a very important topic guys and\n\n332\n00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:29.300\nit's one of the reasons\nthat we put it in here.\n\n333\n00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:31.290\nIf you are just getting into Windows.\n\n334\n00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:36.840\nIf you are just getting into even\nother certifications like A+, right?\n\n335\n00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.840\nIf you're in CompTIA world, you're still\ngonna need to know permissions, so\n\n336\n00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.200\nthey're very important.\n\n337\n00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.490\nLet's go ahead and\nlet's talk about file permissions and\n\n338\n00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:46.310\nI'll also mention a little bit, one\nthat's just a little bit different here,\n\n339\n00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:49.490\nbecause these same permissions\napply to folders as well.\n\n340\n00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:51.310\nAnd I'll show you what we mean by that.\n\n341\n00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:54.140\nSo here are the NTFS\npermissions that we have.\n\n342\n00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:57.380\nAnd again, like I said, there's one\ndown here that only applies to folders,\n\n343\n00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.970\nand I'll explain that.\n\n344\n00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:01.170\nWe have what's known as\nthe read permission.\n\n345\n00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:03.860\nWhen you have a read permission,\nthis gives you\n\n346\n00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:09.540\nthe ability to do certain things with a\ndocument, a file if you will, or a folder.\n\n347\n00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.240\nWhen it comes to the read permission,\nit gives you the ability.\n\n348\n00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.790\nIf it's on a folder, you can see\nwhat's inside of the folder and\n\n349\n00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:18.170\nyou can read any of\nthe documents in the folder.\n\n350\n00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:22.880\nIf it's on a file, it means I can open\nthat file and I can read the context.\n\n351\n00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.600\nYou might hear me say,\nyou can consume the document.\n\n352\n00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.170\nWell, you can read what's inside of it.\n\n353\n00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:29.400\nIt also gives you a little bit more too.\n\n354\n00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.320\nIf I want to see what permissions\nare currently on a file, and\n\n355\n00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.020\nI have the read permission,\nI can see that.\n\n356\n00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:38.780\nThe next one is the write permission,\nall right, and I'll tell you what.\n\n357\n00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:39.940\nI'm gonna kind skip over write,\n\n358\n00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:42.900\nI'll come back to that cuz I want to\ntalk about read and execute, okay.\n\n359\n00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.450\nFirst of all, understand that if you're\ngonna have the read and execute,\n\n360\n00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:47.100\nyou have to at least have read.\n\n361\n00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:51.090\nBecause execute also gives you\nthe ability to launch an application, and\n\n362\n00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:52.740\nthat is important.\n\n363\n00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.350\nThe next one we have is write.\n\n364\n00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:57.400\nWrite is an interesting permission\nin the fact that it allows you to\n\n365\n00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.770\nmake a change to a document, okay?\n\n366\n00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:03.350\nAnd the one thing that it\ndoesn't allow you to do\n\n367\n00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:05.120\nis it doesn't allow you\nto delete a document.\n\n368\n00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.680\nI can add information to a document, but\n\n369\n00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.550\nI don't get the ability\nto delete the document.\n\n370\n00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:12.400\nAnd that's where we get in to modify.\n\n371\n00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.770\nOnce we get to modify,\nwe have now permissions\n\n372\n00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:21.200\nnot only to make changes to the document\nbut also to delete the file if I want.\n\n373\n00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.960\nThe other thing I'd like to mention is,\nonce you get to modify, the modify level,\n\n374\n00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:29.140\nyou'll see that you have all\nlower permissions below it.\n\n375\n00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:32.222\nSo if I've got to modify permission\nit means I have the read permission,\n\n376\n00:19:32.222 --> 00:19:35.569\nI have the write permission, and I also\nhave the read and execute permission.\n\n377\n00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:39.390\nLast but not least, is full control.\n\n378\n00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:41.170\nNow you gotta be careful\ngiving full control.\n\n379\n00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:44.890\nThere are a couple of groups that,\nby default on a Windows machine,\n\n380\n00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:45.650\nhave full control.\n\n381\n00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:48.300\nVery first one,\nit's gonna be administrators.\n\n382\n00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.980\nDoesn't matter what permission you set,\n\n383\n00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:54.670\nan administrator has access to files and\nfolders.\n\n384\n00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:57.270\nThe other one is a group known as owner,\nall right?\n\n385\n00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:59.410\nOwner means you've created the file.\n\n386\n00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:02.570\nIf you create the file,\nyou by default have full control.\n\n387\n00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:03.900\nYou can set permissions.\n\n388\n00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.670\nYou can view permissions.\n\n389\n00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:08.600\nAnd that's one of the things\nthat sets full control\n\n390\n00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.520\napart from the modify permission,\n\n391\n00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:14.290\nis the fact that modify doesn't give\nme the ability to change permissions.\n\n392\n00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:17.600\nFull control gives me the ability\nto change the permissions or\n\n393\n00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:22.030\neven let's say if it was Ronnie's file and\nhe gives me full control.\n\n394\n00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:25.550\nI can play a sleight of hand here and\nI can come in and remove his permissions.\n\n395\n00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:27.640\nI can take ownership of the document.\n\n396\n00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.740\nNow just keep in mind if\nhe's an administrator,\n\n397\n00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.230\nthat does absolutely nothing.\n\n398\n00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.740\nBecause Ronnie comes in,\nhe looks at the file and\n\n399\n00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.930\nsays, I see what you're trying to do,\nyou're trying to pull one over on me.\n\n400\n00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:39.100\nBut because he's an administrator, doesn't\nmatter if I remove his permissions,\n\n401\n00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.160\nhe can always gain those back.\n\n402\n00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:44.810\nNow, the last one here,\nis one that's only on folders, all right.\n\n403\n00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:47.310\nAll the other ones are shared\nby folders and files.\n\n404\n00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:49.950\nThis last one is more like a listing.\n\n405\n00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:53.370\nIf I want to be able to see\njust what's in a folder,\n\n406\n00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:57.450\nI can't open each individual one up but\nI can at least see it like a listing.\n\n407\n00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:00.210\nThat's called list folder contents.\n\n408\n00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:04.420\nAll right, so that's one that\nagain is only applied to folders.\n\n409\n00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:06.450\nNow, I've talked a little bit about this.\n\n410\n00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:08.950\nLet's go ahead and\nkind of show you this in action and\n\n411\n00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:11.450\nshow you what we mean when we\ntalk about these permissions.\n\n412\n00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:14.330\nBecause it's easy to talk about it but\nit's not so\n\n413\n00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:18.050\neasy to understand what's going on unless\nyou can actually see it in action.\n\n414\n00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:22.660\nSo, I'm gonna switch over to my Windows\nmachine and I'm logged in as admin.\n\n415\n00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:26.580\nAnd just so you know,\nadmin is an administrative user.\n\n416\n00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:30.330\nOkay, so\nwe're going with that premise first.\n\n417\n00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:34.650\nI'm going to go ahead and\nI'm going to drop down to C: here and\n\n418\n00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:36.521\nI'm going to create a folder here in C:.\n\n419\n00:21:36.521 --> 00:21:41.200\nI'm going to go ahead and choose new,\nI'm going to create folder, and\n\n420\n00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:45.120\nI'm going to call it\napparently not new folder.\n\n421\n00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.590\nLet's try to rename that folder.\n\n422\n00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:52.330\nAll right, and we'll call it, it's even\nmore important, I'll call it folder01.\n\n423\n00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:56.040\nNow I'm gonna do a couple of\nmodifications so that we can see this.\n\n424\n00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:00.466\nI wanna show you it live in action, but\nI'll explain what's going on here and\n\n425\n00:22:00.466 --> 00:22:04.297\nsome of the modifications that I'm making,\nbut we'll go ahead.\n\n426\n00:22:04.297 --> 00:22:10.030\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, before you do that, on\nthe properties, that clicked up real fast.\n\n427\n00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:12.000\nCan you show us that slowly again so\n\n428\n00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.510\nthat we can see exactly what you did\nthere to make those properties show up?\n\n429\n00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:20.010\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so what we're doing is we're\nright clicking on the folder and\n\n430\n00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:21.590\nI'm choosing properties.\n\n431\n00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:24.260\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that just flashed up like a script,\nI mean it was just flashed up there,\n\n432\n00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:25.380\nI was like whoa.\n\n433\n00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:28.940\n&gt;&gt; The properties of folder is where I\ncan get to the permissions, all right.\n\n434\n00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:31.510\nAnd we're gonna get to the ACL here\nin a second, I'm gonna make some\n\n435\n00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:35.716\nmodifications to it real quick, and I'll\nexplain what I'm doing here in a second.\n\n436\n00:22:35.716 --> 00:22:39.920\nAll right,\nnow in order to set permissions,\n\n437\n00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.390\nyou set it on what is known as an ACL.\n\n438\n00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:45.240\nNow this is the ACL that we're looking at,\nall right?\n\n439\n00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:50.530\nAnd inside of this ACL, access control\nlist, you have a series of identities.\n\n440\n00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:54.090\nThese identities can be a group or\nit could be a single user.\n\n441\n00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:58.050\nIn this case,\nit's all user groups, all right?\n\n442\n00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:00.420\nAnd what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna make some modifications and\n\n443\n00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:03.650\nI'm actually going to remove\nsome of the access here.\n\n444\n00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:04.700\nAnd we're gonna come back, and\n\n445\n00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:07.790\nwe're gonna look at some of\nthe permissions individually here.\n\n446\n00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:09.150\nAll right, we're gonna choose Edit.\n\n447\n00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:12.290\nAnd let me go ahead, and\nI'm gonna remove Authenticated Users.\n\n448\n00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:15.040\nWe'll remove everybody, but\nthe Administrators group.\n\n449\n00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:19.680\nAnd then I'm gonna turn around, and\nI'm gonna add one user, all right?\n\n450\n00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.686\nWe're gonna try, you know what?\n\n451\n00:23:21.686 --> 00:23:22.230\nI'll tell you what.\n\n452\n00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:23.600\nWell, let's do it this way.\n\n453\n00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:28.450\nWe're just gonna remove\nall those users outright.\n\n454\n00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:30.590\nSo I'm gonna remove authenticated users.\n\n455\n00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:34.109\nI'm gonna leave the administrators group\nor I won't have access to this file,\n\n456\n00:23:34.109 --> 00:23:34.641\nall right?\n\n457\n00:23:34.641 --> 00:23:38.850\nSo at this point, nobody should\nhave access to this folder at all.\n\n458\n00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:42.090\nSo let me go ahead real quick and\nkind of show you this, all right?\n\n459\n00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:44.827\nAnd you can see it's telling me,\nhey, you don't have access.\n\n460\n00:23:44.827 --> 00:23:51.029\nAll right, I'm going to create a document\nand we're going to call this Important.\n\n461\n00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:56.237\nAll right, now what I'm going\nto do is I'm going to log out.\n\n462\n00:23:56.237 --> 00:24:00.691\nAnd we're gonna sign in as a user that\nis no longer in that list, right,\n\n463\n00:24:00.691 --> 00:24:02.415\nthat access control list.\n\n464\n00:24:02.415 --> 00:24:08.902\nSo let's go ahead and let's log in as\nanother user, in this case User01.\n\n465\n00:24:08.902 --> 00:24:13.570\nOne of the things that you might notice is\nthat I didn't have User01 in that list.\n\n466\n00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:19.400\nWe're gonna browse to that same location,\nwe're gonna go to C:,\n\n467\n00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:23.840\nall right, and if you'll notice\nhere's our Folder01, right?\n\n468\n00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:27.400\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead,\nand do absolutely nothing.\n\n469\n00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.860\nRemember what I told you about\nadministrators, all right?\n\n470\n00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:33.230\nSo if I set this permission and Ronnie was\nthe administrator, he could come in here,\n\n471\n00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:35.310\nhe could choose the Administrator tab, and\n\n472\n00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:38.550\nhe can put in his username and\npassword and he has access to it.\n\n473\n00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:41.840\nBut where this person\nisn't an administrator and\n\n474\n00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:48.060\nthey don't have user credentials,\nthey can't get any access, right?\n\n475\n00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:52.080\nThat's why we call it an access\ncontrol list, your permissions are.\n\n476\n00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:55.290\nSo, let's go ahead and\nlet's see what we would have to do in\n\n477\n00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:58.840\norder to give somebody even just\nthe basic access to this folder.\n\n478\n00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.980\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna sign out here real quick.\n\n479\n00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:05.040\nAnd we'll sign back in\nas our administrator\n\n480\n00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:10.380\nwhich also kind of falls under two\ncategories, administrator and owner.\n\n481\n00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:16.030\nSo, they are really king of\nthe hill on this one, all right?\n\n482\n00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:17.790\nSo we're gonna log back\nin as administrator, and\n\n483\n00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:19.290\nhopefully I typed the password right.\n\n484\n00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:21.389\nIf I typed the password right,\nI can get back in here.\n\n485\n00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:27.300\nAll right, so we're gonna go back to\nLocal Disk C, gonna right click and\n\n486\n00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:31.770\npull up the Properties again so\nwe can see the access control list.\n\n487\n00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:34.650\nNow, I said access control list, but\nlet me be a little bit more specific.\n\n488\n00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:37.860\nKinda like Ronnie pointed out\nearlier that's the Security tab.\n\n489\n00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.450\nAnd I don't know if i\nmentioned that earlier?\n\n490\n00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:40.960\nI really need to mention that.\n\n491\n00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:45.280\nRight, with the Security tab,\nis where we see that list, right?\n\n492\n00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.692\nBut now, I'm gonna go ahead and\nnotice that in this list,\n\n493\n00:25:47.692 --> 00:25:51.420\nlook at all the permissions here, you see\nthe permission we've been talking about?\n\n494\n00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:56.890\nFull control, Modify, Read, execute, List\nfolder cortents ,Write and Read, okay?\n\n495\n00:25:56.890 --> 00:26:01.958\nNow, we're gonna make an edit, and\nthis time what I'm gonna do is\n\n496\n00:26:01.958 --> 00:26:07.400\nI'm gonna add User01, if I could\nspell User01 that would be good.\n\n497\n00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:13.410\nAnd we'll do a Check names here,\nit allows me to add them to that list.\n\n498\n00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:18.340\nAnd I'll choose OK, now we see that\nthe user is in this control list and\n\n499\n00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.950\nwe'll choose Apply, all right.\n\n500\n00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:24.962\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and, yes, just\nlike we did before, we're gonna sign out,\n\n501\n00:26:24.962 --> 00:26:28.921\nand see what that read permission that we\njust gave User01 gives me the ability, or\n\n502\n00:26:28.921 --> 00:26:32.370\nthat person, I guess I should say,\ngives that person the ability to do.\n\n503\n00:26:37.318 --> 00:26:40.830\nAll right, and again,\nif I type the password right.\n\n504\n00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:44.980\nSo we're gonna go back to\nFile Explorer from our taskbar here.\n\n505\n00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:49.060\nWe're gonna go back to this PC and\nLocal Disk C.\n\n506\n00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:50.297\nNow remember what happened last time.\n\n507\n00:26:50.297 --> 00:26:53.479\nI didn't give him or\nthis her the read permissions, so\n\n508\n00:26:53.479 --> 00:26:56.510\nthey couldn't even get into the folder.\n\n509\n00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:59.440\nBut now if I click on it,\nnotice what happens.\n\n510\n00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:02.270\nNow, they can get into the folder.\n\n511\n00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:04.980\nNow if they wanted to,\nthey could even read the document.\n\n512\n00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:07.531\nProbably should've put some text in here,\nbut\n\n513\n00:27:07.531 --> 00:27:10.355\nlet's see if we can add\nsomething to this document.\n\n514\n00:27:10.355 --> 00:27:14.570\nAnd we'll put, this is my text.\n\n515\n00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:16.730\nAll right, I'm gonna do a File, Save.\n\n516\n00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:22.492\nBut I'm getting this Save As.\n\n517\n00:27:22.492 --> 00:27:24.940\nUsually when you save a file,\nit just happens right away.\n\n518\n00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:26.650\nSo let's go ahead and save this.\n\n519\n00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:30.130\nNow it's telling me,\nwait, it already exists.\n\n520\n00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:31.090\nDo you want to replace it?\n\n521\n00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:33.300\nAnd we'll keep it the same name,\nand we'll replace it.\n\n522\n00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.630\nAnd notice here, access control.\n\n523\n00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:39.180\nAccess is denied.\n\n524\n00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:40.630\nI don't have the right permission.\n\n525\n00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:43.262\nI can't add something to this document,\nall right?\n\n526\n00:27:43.262 --> 00:27:46.610\nSo, let's see what we\nhave to do to fix that.\n\n527\n00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:51.894\nAll right, so I'm not gonna save\nanything here cuz obviously I can't.\n\n528\n00:27:51.894 --> 00:27:59.172\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna log out one more time.\n\n529\n00:27:59.172 --> 00:28:01.960\nAll right, so\nwe'll log back in as our administrator.\n\n530\n00:28:05.038 --> 00:28:07.160\nAnd I want you to watch what I do here.\n\n531\n00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.930\nNow we're gonna try not to\ndo any slight of hand here,\n\n532\n00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:12.230\nno magic tricks if you will, all right?\n\n533\n00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:15.434\nI'm gonna go back to that same location,\n\n534\n00:28:15.434 --> 00:28:21.216\nI'm gonna go back to Local Disk C,\nI'm gonna open up Folder01, right?\n\n535\n00:28:21.216 --> 00:28:23.940\nNow I'm gonna do a couple of things here,\nall right?\n\n536\n00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:29.440\nI'm gonna add to this folder,\nan executable.\n\n537\n00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.630\nIn this case, the executable is\ngoing to be what's known as PUTTY.\n\n538\n00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:36.730\nIt is an EXE, okay, and\nthis time we're gonna make\n\n539\n00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:41.120\na slight modification to the Permissions\nlist, the access control list.\n\n540\n00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.320\nI'm gonna go to the Security tab again,\nlike we did before.\n\n541\n00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:48.480\nI'm gonna find the user or\ngroup that I want to make a modification.\n\n542\n00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:49.671\nI'm gonna choose Edit.\n\n543\n00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.024\nAll right, and here's our User01.\n\n544\n00:28:55.024 --> 00:28:59.250\nNotice that there is list folder contents.\n\n545\n00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:04.723\nWe had read, right, but\nwe didn't have the write permission.\n\n546\n00:29:04.723 --> 00:29:10.430\nWe had read, we had list folder contents,\nbut we didn't have the write permission.\n\n547\n00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:14.309\nAll right, and\nI'm gonna uncheck Read and execute.\n\n548\n00:29:14.309 --> 00:29:17.440\nI'm gonna choose OK to this,\nwe'll choose OK again.\n\n549\n00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:22.678\nAnd we'll go ahead, we'll right click, and\n\n550\n00:29:22.678 --> 00:29:28.013\nwe'll sign out, and\nwe're gonna sign back in as User01.\n\n551\n00:29:28.013 --> 00:29:33.346\nNow, we've got this example and\none more, because I do wanna show you,\n\n552\n00:29:33.346 --> 00:29:36.770\nand it looks like I\nlogged back in as User01.\n\n553\n00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:40.252\nLet's try that again,\njust a bit outside, ball one.\n\n554\n00:29:42.472 --> 00:29:48.850\nApparently you shouldn't be taking\ncourses with me to learn on how to login.\n\n555\n00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:50.690\nThat is a little bit challenging there.\n\n556\n00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:55.010\nI just wanna double check\nsomething here real quick.\n\n557\n00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:58.990\nJust make sure I've got\nthat ACL configured.\n\n558\n00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:01.070\nAnd that permissions list\nconfigured the way I want.\n\n559\n00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:07.450\nProperties, Security tab, okay, so\nwe just made sure that we got the Read\n\n560\n00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:13.600\npermission in there and\nthe right permission.\n\n561\n00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:19.000\nTry that one more time there,\nnow we'll log back in as our User01 and\n\n562\n00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.100\nsee what that's done to our\nlevel of access, all right.\n\n563\n00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:28.550\nThere we go, so\nwe'll open this folder back up.\n\n564\n00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:36.666\nAll right and we're gonna get into\nthis PC, Local disk C, Folder01.\n\n565\n00:30:36.666 --> 00:30:40.290\nWe're gonna go in here, and\nwe're gonna open this up.\n\n566\n00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:45.710\nAnd we're gonna say, this is my text.\n\n567\n00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:47.310\nAnd I'm gonna do a File, Save.\n\n568\n00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:49.510\nNow, I want you to notice something.\n\n569\n00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:51.950\nNotice that the save as didn't\ncome up like it did before.\n\n570\n00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:56.050\nThat's what should happen if you've\ngot the right permission on a file.\n\n571\n00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:59.840\nIf I close it down and open it back up,\nnotice what's happening.\n\n572\n00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:06.440\nIt is saving my information because\nI have the right permission.\n\n573\n00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.740\nBut I want you to notice something here.\n\n574\n00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:12.500\nNotice we got this executable right here\nlet me go ahead and launch that or not.\n\n575\n00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.020\nNow, remember what I told you.\n\n576\n00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:19.880\nYou have to have the read and\nexecute in order to launch this.\n\n577\n00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:23.730\nWe don't have the read and execute,\nbut I do have the read permissions.\n\n578\n00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:28.173\nSo let's verify that I can look\nat that folder, and I can see,\n\n579\n00:31:28.173 --> 00:31:29.978\nam I missing something?\n\n580\n00:31:29.978 --> 00:31:34.249\nAm I missing read and execute?\n\n581\n00:31:34.249 --> 00:31:39.070\nAnd if I look at the security, I mean,\nyou guys already know the answer, right?\n\n582\n00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:41.780\nThis is like watching something\nwhere you already know who did it.\n\n583\n00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:45.520\nNotice that the Read and\nexecute permission isn't there.\n\n584\n00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:47.842\nI don't have that level of access.\n\n585\n00:31:47.842 --> 00:31:50.803\nSo last thing here cuz I know\nwe're running low on time.\n\n586\n00:31:50.803 --> 00:31:56.317\nI wanna show you that I can also do the\nsame thing with giving read and execute.\n\n587\n00:31:56.317 --> 00:32:00.395\nAll right, so let's go ahead, we'll\nlog back in one time as administrator.\n\n588\n00:32:02.737 --> 00:32:05.026\nAnd we're gonna assign\none more permission here.\n\n589\n00:32:08.369 --> 00:32:10.798\nAnd we'll go back to File Explorer.\n\n590\n00:32:10.798 --> 00:32:15.695\nWe're gonna go back to Local disk (C:),\nright click on your folder,\n\n591\n00:32:15.695 --> 00:32:19.082\nthe appropriate location,\nchoose Properties.\n\n592\n00:32:19.082 --> 00:32:22.640\nThe security tab takes us back\nto the access control list.\n\n593\n00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.651\nWe select the user that we want.\n\n594\n00:32:24.651 --> 00:32:25.981\nWe're gonna choose Edit.\n\n595\n00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:32.312\nAnd we're gonna add the Read &amp; execute.\n\n596\n00:32:32.312 --> 00:32:34.928\nAnd you can see Full control and\nModify as well there,\n\n597\n00:32:34.928 --> 00:32:37.558\nthe permissions that we\nwere talking about earlier.\n\n598\n00:32:37.558 --> 00:32:39.474\nBut this should give\nyou a pretty good idea.\n\n599\n00:32:39.474 --> 00:32:41.394\nWe're gonna ahead and sign out now.\n\n600\n00:32:41.394 --> 00:32:45.750\nThis should give you a pretty good idea on\nhow you can control access to files and\n\n601\n00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:48.130\nfolders through those NTFS permissions.\n\n602\n00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:53.044\nLet me go ahead and logon as User01 now.\n\n603\n00:32:53.044 --> 00:32:56.708\nAnd the goal on this is to see if we\ncould actually execute that program,\n\n604\n00:32:56.708 --> 00:32:59.411\nin this case Putty,\nthat's inside of that folder.\n\n605\n00:32:59.411 --> 00:33:05.028\nYou're gonna go back to Local disk (C:),\nyou're gonna close out OneDrive.\n\n606\n00:33:05.028 --> 00:33:06.897\nAnd we're gonna see if we can launch that.\n\n607\n00:33:06.897 --> 00:33:09.857\nAnd sure enough,\nnow our application is executing,\n\n608\n00:33:09.857 --> 00:33:13.360\nbecause we've given the user\nthe level of access that we want.\n\n609\n00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.390\nWe're controlling access to files and\nfolders.\n\n610\n00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:20.110\nNow, why is it that these\nfiles allow me to do that?\n\n611\n00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:24.425\nThe last thing I wanna mention here is\nsomething known as permission inheritance,\n\n612\n00:33:24.425 --> 00:33:24.943\nokay?\n\n613\n00:33:24.943 --> 00:33:31.470\nNotice that these checkmarks are grayed\nout, they aren't dark, all right?\n\n614\n00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:33.470\nUnderstand that when you have a folder,\n\n615\n00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:36.550\nthere's a special relationship\nto a folder and a file.\n\n616\n00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:39.795\nIf I put a file in a folder\nthat has permissions set on it,\n\n617\n00:33:39.795 --> 00:33:42.499\nit automatically inherits the permissions.\n\n618\n00:33:42.499 --> 00:33:46.414\nThat's why I can see that if I look, for\n\n619\n00:33:46.414 --> 00:33:51.412\ninstance, let me go ahead and\nlook at Putty here.\n\n620\n00:33:51.412 --> 00:33:55.960\nChoose the properties, the Security tab,\nand we'll look at users.\n\n621\n00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:00.080\nNotice that I didn't set the permissions\non this individual file, or\n\n622\n00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.080\nin this case, an application.\n\n623\n00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.610\nWhere are they coming from?\n\n624\n00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:08.090\nThey're being inherited\nfrom their parent object.\n\n625\n00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:10.910\nNow that is a very easy way\nto manage your permissions.\n\n626\n00:34:10.910 --> 00:34:12.439\nWhy?\nIf I have 30 files,\n\n627\n00:34:12.439 --> 00:34:16.401\nI don't have to go in and just set\npermissions on each individual file.\n\n628\n00:34:16.401 --> 00:34:21.484\nI could set it one time at the folder\nlevel, dump all of those files in there,\n\n629\n00:34:21.484 --> 00:34:26.191\nand now they all inherit down,\nmaking it easier to do access control.\n\n630\n00:34:26.191 --> 00:34:29.468\nNow, that essentially is what\npermissions are doing for us.\n\n631\n00:34:29.468 --> 00:34:33.858\nAs you've seen, permissions allow us\nthe ability to control who has access.\n\n632\n00:34:33.858 --> 00:34:39.020\nBut not only who has access, what level of\naccess that they have to the documents and\n\n633\n00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:41.103\nthe data that's on the machine.\n\n634\n00:34:41.103 --> 00:34:45.119\n&gt;&gt; Well Wes, the idea of permissions is\nreally a very important concept that we\n\n635\n00:34:45.119 --> 00:34:49.261\nare actually going to really have to\ndeal with on a day-to-day basis if we're\n\n636\n00:34:49.261 --> 00:34:50.660\nsupporting users.\n\n637\n00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:55.167\nA lot of times people don't understand\nwhen they get a message from the operating\n\n638\n00:34:55.167 --> 00:34:59.749\nsystem that says that access is denied,\nor they're not allowed to do something.\n\n639\n00:34:59.749 --> 00:35:02.521\nAnd permissions is how we determine that.\n\n640\n00:35:02.521 --> 00:35:05.761\nAnd we can simply see that\nby using that Properties\n\n641\n00:35:05.761 --> 00:35:08.395\nlink to help us to see that dialogue box.\n\n642\n00:35:08.395 --> 00:35:11.598\nAnd to be able to actually examine that\nand figure out what's going on too.\n\n643\n00:35:11.598 --> 00:35:14.049\nNow Wes, there's a lot more for\nus to actually show.\n\n644\n00:35:14.049 --> 00:35:16.922\nSo I think this is a great point for\nus to actually do a part two,\n\n645\n00:35:16.922 --> 00:35:20.573\nbecause we've still got,\nI think sharing permissions, to go over.\n\n646\n00:35:20.573 --> 00:35:21.131\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n647\n00:35:21.131 --> 00:35:24.188\n&gt;&gt; We'll learn some different other\nthings too, but that's a great place for\n\n648\n00:35:24.188 --> 00:35:25.344\nus to also end this episode.\n\n649\n00:35:25.344 --> 00:35:28.200\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n650\n00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.186\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n651\n00:35:29.186 --> 00:35:33.252\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned

They begin with configuring file and printer sharing on the resource machine to allow for access.  Also, they show how to connect to the resource computer using the UNC path and mapping a network drive.  They also discuss the use of share permissions to grant access to the network resource.  The emphasize when connecting from a remote computer to the network resource, the most restrictive of the NTFS Permissions and Share permissions apply.",

00:00:08.259\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:12.485\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.485 --> 00:00:15.710\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.199\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.672\nAnd today, we're taking a look at\nWindows operating system fundamentals.\n\n8\n00:00:20.672 --> 00:00:25.555\nWe're specifically diving back into the\nrealm of file systems, permissions, and\n\n9\n00:00:25.555 --> 00:00:28.000\neven the idea of fileshares here.\n\n10\n00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.220\nAnd we're actually in a part two, so here\nto continue on with this is Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.440\nWes, welcome back to our studios.\n\n12\n00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.550\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me there, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.650\nThat's right, apparently, I talked\nway too much in the first one, but\n\n14\n00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.680\nwe do have some additional\ntopics that we wanna look at.\n\n15\n00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.870\nSo in this one, what we're gonna be\nlooking at are the sharing permissions and\n\n16\n00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.540\nwe wanna be able to differentiate\nbetween some of the earlier\n\n17\n00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.930\npermissions that we mentioned in\nthe first part of this episode.\n\n18\n00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.884\nWhat we originally mentioned were file and\n\n19\n00:00:52.884 --> 00:00:56.148\nfolder level permissions that\nare commonly called NTFS permissions.\n\n20\n00:00:56.148 --> 00:00:58.822\nAnd sometimes they're referred to\nas local permissions, all right?\n\n21\n00:00:58.822 --> 00:01:02.792\nAnd what that means is upon sitting at\nthe computer and where those files and\n\n22\n00:01:02.792 --> 00:01:06.020\nfolders reside and\nI've applied permissions, all right?\n\n23\n00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.010\nThose are called NTFS permissions.\n\n24\n00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.860\nHowever, there are times when you\nwanna share resources with other users\n\n25\n00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.080\nthat are connected to a network.\n\n26\n00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.830\nAll right, and when we do that we have\nanother set of permissions that we kinda\n\n27\n00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.810\nhave to discuss so that we know how\nwe can control access just like we do\n\n28\n00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.550\nlocally with a machine, how do we control\nwho we want to have access to files and\n\n29\n00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.660\nfolders on a machine when we\nconnect to it over the network.\n\n30\n00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.810\nAnd that's gonna be through something\nknown as shared permissions.\n\n31\n00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.840\nNow when we look at Share Permissions,\n\n32\n00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.350\nshare permissions they're\na little bit different, right?\n\n33\n00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.175\nAnd let me go in and\n\n34\n00:01:39.175 --> 00:01:42.570\ntake the term NTFS out of here cuz\nI don't wanna confuse anybody.\n\n35\n00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.900\nShare permissions really boil\ndown to these three permissions,\n\n36\n00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.820\nand I keep it kinda simple.\n\n37\n00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.100\nYou'll see the Full Control permission,\nyou'll see Change permission and\n\n38\n00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.400\nyou'll see the Read permission.\n\n39\n00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.590\nNow if you're looking at local permissions\nand where I'm sitting at the computer and\n\n40\n00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.870\nI sign a read permission,\n\n41\n00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.960\nwell, those two permissions are identical\nin what they give you the ability to do.\n\n42\n00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.440\nHowever, I would probably liken the change\npermission more to what a modify\n\n43\n00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.966\npermission is when we talk about locally.\n\n44\n00:02:09.966 --> 00:02:13.500\nSo you can kinda see what level of\npermission access that gives you.\n\n45\n00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.210\nLast but not least, we have full control.\n\n46\n00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.640\nAnd full control does what exactly what\nit would do [LAUGH] on local permissions.\n\n47\n00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.410\nAnd the fact that when you have full\ncontrol, you pretty much can do exactly\n\n48\n00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.760\nwhat you need to, or whatever you really\nwant to, to any file that's in a folder.\n\n49\n00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.940\nNow, let me go ahead and\nalso be specific about something.\n\n50\n00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.160\nOne of the things we can't do\nis share an individual app.\n\n51\n00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.090\nWe have to share folders because\nfolders are containers that can\n\n52\n00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.600\ncontain other files and,\nreally, other folders in files.\n\n53\n00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.720\nSo when you share resources, you create\nwhat's known as a shared folder.\n\n54\n00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.590\nAnd then,\nyou put the files inside of that folder.\n\n55\n00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.460\nNow, I want you to know that permission\ninheritance also works just like we talked\n\n56\n00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.430\nabout on the first part of this episode.\n\n57\n00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.080\nIf you will, if you don't remember,\nyou can go back and watch that.\n\n58\n00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.777\nBut we can do a real quick recap here.\n\n59\n00:03:04.777 --> 00:03:07.601\nKeep in mind that if I apply\na permission to a folder, and\n\n60\n00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:11.147\nI put a file in that folder,\nit automatically assigns that permission\n\n61\n00:03:11.147 --> 00:03:14.280\ndown to that file that's\ncalled permission inheritance.\n\n62\n00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.350\nWell, shared permissions\nwork that same way.\n\n63\n00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.121\nSo, as it relates to a shared folder,\n\n64\n00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:24.407\nif I put a file in that shared folder and\nthe folder has read permissions,\n\n65\n00:03:24.407 --> 00:03:28.411\nthe file also gains those\nread permissions, as well.\n\n66\n00:03:28.411 --> 00:03:30.400\nSo as you can see,\nwith the three permissions,\n\n67\n00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.809\nit does differ just a little bit.\n\n68\n00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:35.496\nBut they've made it kinda simple because\nwe do have a lot of permissions and\n\n69\n00:03:35.496 --> 00:03:38.950\nwe do have some other things that we\ngotta take into consideration when\n\n70\n00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.820\nwe start working with both of\nthese sets of permissions.\n\n71\n00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.903\nBut before we get into that,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n72\n00:03:43.903 --> 00:03:47.238\nshow you how you could share a resource\ninside of your Windows environment,\n\n73\n00:03:47.238 --> 00:03:49.500\nin case you wanna make it\navailable to other users.\n\n74\n00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.123\nSo I've got a couple of Windows\nmachines here, I've got a client 01 and\n\n75\n00:03:53.123 --> 00:03:54.595\nI've also got a client 02.\n\n76\n00:03:54.595 --> 00:03:58.003\nAll right, what we're gonna go ahead and\ndo, and let me just double check.\n\n77\n00:03:58.003 --> 00:04:00.469\nBecause I've got a couple\nof locations here, and\n\n78\n00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:03.240\nI wanna make sure that I'm\nsharing the right location.\n\n79\n00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.928\nOkay, so on client01, what we're gonna\ndo is we're gonna share a folder, okay?\n\n80\n00:04:06.928 --> 00:04:09.320\nAnd we're gonna make it available to\n\n81\n00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.510\nanybody that was sitting across the\nnetwork on the other machine, client02.\n\n82\n00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.220\nAll right, so open up Client 01 here.\n\n83\n00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.090\nI have a folder down here where we're\nstoring all of our work documents and\n\n84\n00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.260\nI wanna make them available to other\nusers, so that's just storage.\n\n85\n00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.470\nIt makes it easier for\nme to remember the name and\n\n86\n00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.030\nwe're gonna talk a little bit\nabout that name coming up.\n\n87\n00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.405\nSo, to do this, I'm gonna right-click\njust like we did when we were looking at\n\n88\n00:04:34.405 --> 00:04:37.150\nthe properties, right,\nwhen we were looking at the Security tab.\n\n89\n00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.198\nIt's the same thing, we're gonna\nright-click this time, choose Properties.\n\n90\n00:04:41.198 --> 00:04:45.215\nAnd instead of going to the Security tab,\nwe're gonna go to the Sharing tab.\n\n91\n00:04:45.215 --> 00:04:47.580\nAnd you don't wanna choose\nthe whole entire drive.\n\n92\n00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.400\nMake sure you select the right thing, so\n\n93\n00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.440\nyou get the appropriate\nright-click options.\n\n94\n00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.216\nSo now that I've selected the folder,\n[LAUGH] when I right-click,\n\n95\n00:04:56.216 --> 00:04:58.801\nyou'll see it looks\na little bit different and\n\n96\n00:04:58.801 --> 00:05:02.129\nwe want to look at these couple\nof options that we have here.\n\n97\n00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:06.397\nNow we've got two different ways\nthat we can do sharing, all right?\n\n98\n00:05:06.397 --> 00:05:09.014\nActually a third way, and\nI'll mention it briefly, but\n\n99\n00:05:09.014 --> 00:05:11.000\nthis is a common way that we do it.\n\n100\n00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.020\nWe have what's known as\na basic sharing wizard and\n\n101\n00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.680\nwe have an advanced sharing wizard.\n\n102\n00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.250\nNow I know they don't really call\nit out and say basic, right?\n\n103\n00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.440\nBut if I choose Share, all right,\nI get this little wizard here and\n\n104\n00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.440\nthis is a very easy way\nto share resources.\n\n105\n00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.720\nIt's nothing more than finding the user or\neven, like you could see,\n\n106\n00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.080\ncreating a user, and I'm just gonna\ngo ahead, I'll just say everyone.\n\n107\n00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.950\nAnd then I'm gonna choose Add.\n\n108\n00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.750\nNow by default when I add, notice\nthe three permissions that we were talking\n\n109\n00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.620\nabout, was Read, was Change,\nand Full Control.\n\n110\n00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.840\nWell, notice that it defaulted to Read.\n\n111\n00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.880\nAll right, the default is Read when\nyou share it out for the first time.\n\n112\n00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.450\nHowever, I want you to pay attention\nto this drop-down box right here.\n\n113\n00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:59.160\nSee, this drop-down box,\nit doesn't have change, why not?\n\n114\n00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.050\nWell, that's the basic sharing wizard,\nright?\n\n115\n00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.790\nThe basic sharing wizard just says,\nwe're gonna get you up and running really,\n\n116\n00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.220\nreally quick and we're not gonna\nmake it too difficult, all right?\n\n117\n00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.649\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna share\nit there, and then I'm gonna choose Share.\n\n118\n00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:15.098\nWe'll do exactly that.\n\n119\n00:06:15.098 --> 00:06:18.930\nNow notice that it says\nyour folder is shared.\n\n120\n00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.270\nAnd it gives me the individual items.\n\n121\n00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.850\nNow, notice this format here.\n\n122\n00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.778\nNotice how we've got a backslash,\nanother backslash.\n\n123\n00:06:28.778 --> 00:06:33.829\nIn this case, it's CLIENT01 Is my computer\nname, and then we have Storage, all right?\n\n124\n00:06:33.829 --> 00:06:37.533\nThis is what's known as a UNC path.\n\n125\n00:06:37.533 --> 00:06:39.140\nLet me go ahead and\nget back to my desktop.\n\n126\n00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.640\nAnd let's create a new\ndocument here real quick.\n\n127\n00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.850\nAnd let's talk about something known\nas the universal naming convention.\n\n128\n00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:51.232\nYou might hear this term from time to\ntime and it is good to know what it is.\n\n129\n00:06:51.232 --> 00:06:56.155\nNow, on a network if I want to, as they\nwould say, browse to a shared resource,\n\n130\n00:06:56.155 --> 00:07:00.860\nwhether it be a folder, whether it be\na hard drive or whether it be a printer,\n\n131\n00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.260\ncuz you can share printers,\nthat's a shared resource as well.\n\n132\n00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.898\nWhat I end up having to do is type\nin the Universal Naming Convention.\n\n133\n00:07:09.898 --> 00:07:13.909\nAll right, it's always\n\n134\n00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:20.791\n\\\\computername\\sharename, right?\n\n135\n00:07:20.791 --> 00:07:24.493\nThat's the UNC path, and\nif I go back to my folder here and\n\n136\n00:07:24.493 --> 00:07:27.970\nI can still see this even\nthough it disappeared.\n\n137\n00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:32.285\nDon't worry, I can right-click on this and\nchoose Properties again, and\n\n138\n00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:34.550\napparently it's still open.\n\n139\n00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:38.410\nAnd you can see that, all right,\nyou can see that UNC path right there.\n\n140\n00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:39.985\nNotice my computer name,\n\n141\n00:07:39.985 --> 00:07:44.480\nCLIENT01\\ the share name, in this case\nit's the name of the folder, Storage.\n\n142\n00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.925\nNow like I said, if you click past\nthis and you're like, I forgot,\n\n143\n00:07:47.925 --> 00:07:49.690\nthis is what I meant to show you here.\n\n144\n00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:51.853\nDon't worry, you can still find it.\n\n145\n00:07:51.853 --> 00:07:58.570\nSo keep that in mind on the exam if they\nask you that, \\\\computername\\sharename.\n\n146\n00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:02.113\nNow, here's the other thing that\nI also want you to keep in mind.\n\n147\n00:08:02.113 --> 00:08:06.642\nInside of Windows, let me go ahead, and\nit's gonna probably ask me to save this,\n\n148\n00:08:06.642 --> 00:08:09.152\nand we won't save it\ncuz we don't need that.\n\n149\n00:08:09.152 --> 00:08:12.975\nAnd we'll go ahead and we'll close out\nof File Explorer here for just a second.\n\n150\n00:08:12.975 --> 00:08:17.025\nI want you understand that there is\na network setting inside of Windows, and\n\n151\n00:08:17.025 --> 00:08:20.075\nwhen you share your first folder\nit is turned on by default.\n\n152\n00:08:20.075 --> 00:08:23.614\nHowever, people get in here and go click\nhappy, they might turn it off, and\n\n153\n00:08:23.614 --> 00:08:28.545\nthat's gonna stop the ability to actually\nconnect to their shared resource.\n\n154\n00:08:28.545 --> 00:08:29.709\nLet me show you real quick what I mean.\n\n155\n00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:32.684\nWe're gonna just drop down\nto our Control Panel.\n\n156\n00:08:32.684 --> 00:08:37.110\nNow, you've seen me right-click on\nthe Windows chart or tile plenty here.\n\n157\n00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:41.170\nWe're gonna go to Network and Internet,\nwe're gonna go to our network and\n\n158\n00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:42.201\nSharing Center and\n\n159\n00:08:42.201 --> 00:08:47.670\nthen if you look, there's this little task\nlink that says advanced sharing settings.\n\n160\n00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:52.053\nWe're gonna go to that and now I want\nyou to see, notice it says when file and\n\n161\n00:08:52.053 --> 00:08:56.854\nprinter sharing is on, files and printers\nthat you've shared from this computer\n\n162\n00:08:56.854 --> 00:09:00.009\ncan be accessed by people\nacross the network, okay?\n\n163\n00:09:00.009 --> 00:09:03.748\nSo that is an important\nthing to keep in mind.\n\n164\n00:09:03.748 --> 00:09:10.560\nNow I also wanna just briefly talk about\none more sharing option, way to share.\n\n165\n00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.130\nI showed you the basic editor,\nthe basic sharing wizard, excuse me,\n\n166\n00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.322\nit's not an editor.\n\n167\n00:09:15.322 --> 00:09:20.370\nI wanna show you how to\ndo the advanced sharing.\n\n168\n00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:21.240\nSo here's what I'm gonna do,\n\n169\n00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:26.010\nI'm gonna go to the Properties,\nI'm gonna go back to the Sharing tab.\n\n170\n00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:30.500\nBut this time, what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna go to Advanced Sharing, all right?\n\n171\n00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.530\nAnd we're gonna start this all over agin.\n\n172\n00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.780\nDon't worry, I'm gonna show you\nexactly what I'm doing here.\n\n173\n00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:39.250\nBut what I wanna do is unshare this,\nI wanna undo what I just did.\n\n174\n00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:42.880\nNow when you want a little bit more\nflexibility and you don't wanna\n\n175\n00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.950\ndo basic sharing, you can come in\nhere to this Advanced Sharing wizard.\n\n176\n00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:49.500\nAnd it's not a wizard,\nit's just a dialogue box really.\n\n177\n00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.220\nAnd we can choose Share this folder.\n\n178\n00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:57.010\nYou say, well, wait a second,\nWes, that's just as basic.\n\n179\n00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:58.280\nYes and no.\n\n180\n00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.189\nI get the ability to name the share,\nwhich is different.\n\n181\n00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:06.600\nThe folder's name is Storage,\nand it's just the default.\n\n182\n00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.500\nI could change this to\ndata files if I wanted.\n\n183\n00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.465\nI'm gonna keep it the same,\nbut I have that ability.\n\n184\n00:10:11.465 --> 00:10:16.277\nNotice that I can limit how many people\ncan be simultaneously connected to\n\n185\n00:10:16.277 --> 00:10:17.913\nthis folder at one time.\n\n186\n00:10:17.913 --> 00:10:21.200\nAnd I also have the ability\nto set permissions.\n\n187\n00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.680\nNow before you guys say, I know what\nyou told me the permissions were but\n\n188\n00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.250\nI didn't see it in the basic editor.\n\n189\n00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:29.828\nNotice that here's where the change\noption comes in and then if you say,\n\n190\n00:10:29.828 --> 00:10:33.480\nI don't wanna give you full control and\nI don't wanna just give you read.\n\n191\n00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.866\nI wanna give you somewhere in the middle,\n\n192\n00:10:34.866 --> 00:10:37.170\nthat's where you can\napply that change option.\n\n193\n00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:41.490\nAll right, now the other thing I want you\nguys to keep in mind, and I'll tell you\n\n194\n00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:46.220\nwhat, let's go ahead and see if we can\nread some of these documents in here.\n\n195\n00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.080\nNotice I've got some information here.\n\n196\n00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.010\nLet's switch over to\nthe other computer here and\n\n197\n00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:53.350\nsee if we can connect back over\nthe network to the shared resource.\n\n198\n00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:55.100\nSo we'll do exactly that.\n\n199\n00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.200\nI'm in File Explorer.\n\n200\n00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.860\nRemember the UNC path,\nit can actually be put\n\n201\n00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:03.550\ndown here in your search field where\nwe use Cortana if we wanna search.\n\n202\n00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:07.770\nWe can also put it in the address field,\nif you will, up here.\n\n203\n00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:12.140\nThe path that you would type\nin if you needed to and\n\n204\n00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:17.050\nif I type \\\\client01\\,\nI can then type storage.\n\n205\n00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:20.180\nAnd notice what happens.\n\n206\n00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:24.730\nNotice that I now have access,\nnotice this UNC path.\n\n207\n00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:28.320\nI'm not on Client01 and let's verify that.\n\n208\n00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:33.590\nIf I go to my System Control panel and\nI look at my computer name here,\n\n209\n00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:38.630\nyou'll notice that I'm actually\non Client02, I'm not on Client01.\n\n210\n00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:43.080\nSo we've connected across\nthe network in order to gain access.\n\n211\n00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.690\nNow, permissions,\n\n212\n00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:48.620\nI gotta watch them as well because I\nshould be able to read these documents.\n\n213\n00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.310\nEven though they don't have\nany information in them,\n\n214\n00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.740\nyou notice that I can open them up.\n\n215\n00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:53.920\nNow that's important to remember,\n\n216\n00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.600\nbut here's where it starts to\nget a little tricky, all right?\n\n217\n00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.660\nThere is an interaction between\npermissions that you have to be aware\n\n218\n00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:05.360\nof when you start mixing and\nmatching, sharing permissions and\n\n219\n00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.890\nthe local permissions that\nwe were talking about.\n\n220\n00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:10.760\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet me show you kinda what we've got,\n\n221\n00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.480\na scenario here, all right?\n\n222\n00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.600\nIf we've got a couple of users,\nthis gentlemen and\n\n223\n00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.090\nthis young lady are logged into\nthe same computer, all right?\n\n224\n00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.230\nThen remember NTFS permissions,\n\n225\n00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:27.360\nthose local permissions apply,\nshare permissions aren't included.\n\n226\n00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.120\nWhy?\n\n227\n00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.320\nBecause they're not connecting\nover the network, okay?\n\n228\n00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:35.100\nSo from this standpoint,\nwe have full control.\n\n229\n00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.150\nIf I've give these users full control,\n\n230\n00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:40.130\nthey can do whatever they want with the\nfile, with the folder that it's set on.\n\n231\n00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:41.880\nPermission inheritance set on a folder.\n\n232\n00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.300\nThey can also do that same thing to\nthe files contained in the folder.\n\n233\n00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:50.840\nHowever, we mix this scenario up just\na little bit, all right, like we just did.\n\n234\n00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:57.620\nAnd I probably should ahead and, let me\nchange to keep our examples accurate.\n\n235\n00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.819\nRemember, we connected from Client02,\nall right?\n\n236\n00:13:00.819 --> 00:13:04.923\nSo if this young lady decides\nthat she's gonna go ahead and\n\n237\n00:13:04.923 --> 00:13:10.035\nshe's gonna connect from Client02,\njust like I just demonstrated,\n\n238\n00:13:10.035 --> 00:13:14.752\nall right, now she connects over\nthe network back to Client 01.\n\n239\n00:13:14.752 --> 00:13:18.197\nNo longer do we have just\nNTFS permissions applying,\n\n240\n00:13:18.197 --> 00:13:21.520\nwe also have share permissions applying.\n\n241\n00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:25.550\nAnd there's a little bit of a rule of\nthumb that you've gotta remember and\n\n242\n00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:29.581\nyou've gotta keep in mind, especially for\nthe exam and pretty much [LAUGH]\n\n243\n00:13:29.581 --> 00:13:33.222\njust about any other Microsoft\nexam that you're gonna be taking,\n\n244\n00:13:33.222 --> 00:13:37.700\nis the fact that even though I give her,\nmaybe I gave her full control, right?\n\n245\n00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.210\nAnd if I give her full\ncontrol share permissions but\n\n246\n00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:45.230\nher NTFS permissions are read,\nwell, which one wins out?\n\n247\n00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:50.290\nWhat is, what is known as her\neffective level of permissions?\n\n248\n00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:54.295\nWell, notice when I told you that if you\ngive modify permissions to somebody,\n\n249\n00:13:54.295 --> 00:13:56.662\nthey also have all\nthe permissions below it and\n\n250\n00:13:56.662 --> 00:14:00.010\nthey can do everything below that\npermission, all those tasks.\n\n251\n00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:04.201\nIt's the opposite when you\ncompare share and NTFS.\n\n252\n00:14:04.201 --> 00:14:08.079\nAnd I don't care which\none is more restrictive.\n\n253\n00:14:08.079 --> 00:14:12.644\nThat becomes the effective permission, and\nthat's something you have to remember,\n\n254\n00:14:12.644 --> 00:14:13.340\nall right?\n\n255\n00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:17.960\nJust because you give somebody\nfull control NTFS, you give them\n\n256\n00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:24.030\nread-share permissions and their effective\nlevel of permission is read, all right?\n\n257\n00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.890\nYou give them full control\nshare permissions and\n\n258\n00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:30.830\nyou give them read NTFS and\nyou connect over the network where\n\n259\n00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:34.550\nboth permissions apply,\nthe results will still be the same.\n\n260\n00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:36.520\nIt's the most restrictive permission.\n\n261\n00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.291\nLet me show you what I mean here,\nall right?\n\n262\n00:14:38.291 --> 00:14:43.259\nIn fact, let me go ahead and\nswitch back over to clients, okay,\n\n263\n00:14:43.259 --> 00:14:45.288\nClient02, all right?\n\n264\n00:14:45.288 --> 00:14:50.421\nAnd here on this storage folder that\nwe've shared out, remember, this is\n\n265\n00:14:50.421 --> 00:14:56.990\nthe one that we've shared, notice that if\nwe look at the permissions, we have read.\n\n266\n00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:58.650\nAll right, so notice there's read.\n\n267\n00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:04.292\nAnd if I close this down,\nthis advanced sharing, all right,\n\n268\n00:15:04.292 --> 00:15:09.619\nand notice that the admin,\nall right, has full control.\n\n269\n00:15:09.619 --> 00:15:15.737\nAll right, if a user has full control\nNTFS and read-share permissions,\n\n270\n00:15:15.737 --> 00:15:19.989\nwhat is the permission\nthat's more restrictive?\n\n271\n00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:22.400\nIt's gonna be the read.\n\n272\n00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:27.910\nSo make sure that when you adjust for\nshare permissions, you keep that in mind.\n\n273\n00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:32.080\nIf I want somebody to have access and\nbe able to make changes, and\n\n274\n00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.630\nI set their share permissions,\nI have to come into the Security tab and\n\n275\n00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:41.170\nmake sure that I have at least\nthe equivalency to the NTFS permissions.\n\n276\n00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:42.240\nAnd that's very important.\n\n277\n00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.590\nVery important if you are setting\nup these permissions.\n\n278\n00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.528\nNow, so that is a little bit\nabout our shared permissions.\n\n279\n00:15:49.528 --> 00:15:55.294\nNow, is there a way that if we need to\nmaybe connect to one of these resources,\n\n280\n00:15:55.294 --> 00:15:59.047\ndo I have to type in This\ncrazy UNC path every time.\n\n281\n00:15:59.047 --> 00:16:02.948\nDo I have to always type //client01?\n\n282\n00:16:02.948 --> 00:16:05.330\nFor somebody like Ronnie and I,\nwe've been doing this so long, it's easy.\n\n283\n00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:09.180\nBut for average end user,\nthey don't wanna do anything like that.\n\n284\n00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:12.790\nSo we also have the ability to make it\na little bit easier on your end user.\n\n285\n00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:15.080\nAnd what we can do is map a drive.\n\n286\n00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:15.830\nNow, map a drive?\n\n287\n00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:16.340\nWhat does that mean?\n\n288\n00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:20.620\nIt really means just make it easier for\nyou to connect to a shared resource.\n\n289\n00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:23.805\nSo let me go ahead real quick and\nshow you how to do that.\n\n290\n00:16:23.805 --> 00:16:29.262\nIf I choose in the list, in the tree\nhierarchy here, if I choose This PC,\n\n291\n00:16:29.262 --> 00:16:35.195\nI have the ability to come up here and\nyou'll see, Map a network drive.\n\n292\n00:16:35.195 --> 00:16:39.343\nAll right, let's go ahead and click\nthat and see what we can get into here.\n\n293\n00:16:39.343 --> 00:16:42.200\nAll right, notice the example.\n\n294\n00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:46.604\nRemember what path we said, the naming\nconvention, universal naming convention?\n\n295\n00:16:46.604 --> 00:16:49.306\nWhen I map a drive, that's all I'm doing.\n\n296\n00:16:49.306 --> 00:16:54.664\nI'm typing in \\, in this case \\\\client01\\,\n\n297\n00:16:54.664 --> 00:16:59.185\nlet me make sure I've\ngot that right there.\n\n298\n00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:01.616\nNope, client02.\n\n299\n00:17:01.616 --> 00:17:07.782\n\\\\client02 and storage, and\nwe're gonna choose Finish.\n\n300\n00:17:07.782 --> 00:17:10.455\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Wes,\nthat UNC path, even though you and\n\n301\n00:17:10.455 --> 00:17:12.037\nI have been doing it for awhile.\n\n302\n00:17:12.037 --> 00:17:14.641\nIs there a way to make it easier for\nsomebody that says, hey,\n\n303\n00:17:14.641 --> 00:17:17.640\nI don't think I'm going to remember\nthat on every single machine?\n\n304\n00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.890\nWhat else can we do, Wes?\n\n305\n00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:20.760\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\nthat's a great question cuz you're right.\n\n306\n00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.140\nThe average end user probably\nwon't want to do all this typing.\n\n307\n00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.140\nThey just need to have access\nto their files and folders.\n\n308\n00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.940\nSo let's go ahead and show that.\n\n309\n00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:28.090\nSo I'm still connected, and\n\n310\n00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:31.630\nI did that through that UNC path\nthat Ronnie just mentioned.\n\n311\n00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:35.070\nBut can we make this easier for our end\nusers that don't want to type that?\n\n312\n00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:38.440\nCertainly can.\nIf I click on This PC in File Explorer,\n\n313\n00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.880\nI can use the ribbon bar that's\nat the top of File Explorer.\n\n314\n00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.760\nAnd you'll notice there's\na couple of items right here.\n\n315\n00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:47.364\nAnd more specifically there's this,\nwhat we call Map a network drive.\n\n316\n00:17:47.364 --> 00:17:48.300\nNow what does that mean?\n\n317\n00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.955\nDoes that mean I'm plugging in some kind\nof cable to a storage device somewhere?\n\n318\n00:17:51.955 --> 00:17:56.088\nNo, it's kinda just\na term that they say for\n\n319\n00:17:56.088 --> 00:18:02.581\nbasically taking a mounting point and\nmounting it right to that UNC.\n\n320\n00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:04.540\nBut let me show you what I mean here.\n\n321\n00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:09.543\nSo I'm going to type in\nthat same UNC path here and\n\n322\n00:18:09.543 --> 00:18:14.061\nI'm gonna type in the \\\\client01\\ and\n\n323\n00:18:14.061 --> 00:18:17.372\nwe'll do storage, all right?\n\n324\n00:18:17.372 --> 00:18:22.290\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nfrom here we'll choose Finish.\n\n325\n00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:24.891\nNow notice it didn't look like it,\nI mean, that happened really quick.\n\n326\n00:18:24.891 --> 00:18:27.625\nBut what it does is it\nreaches over the network and\n\n327\n00:18:27.625 --> 00:18:29.900\ntries to connect to that same location.\n\n328\n00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:35.140\nAnd you can still see a portion of\nthe universal naming convention.\n\n329\n00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.480\nBut more importantly, notice what it does.\n\n330\n00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:41.440\nIt just looks like another drive,\njust like locally, Local Disk (C:) does.\n\n331\n00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:45.718\nAnd now if I want, I can come in here,\nand look what I can do.\n\n332\n00:18:45.718 --> 00:18:48.480\nI can get right to this location.\n\n333\n00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:52.670\nNow, even more so, Ronnie,\nyou mentioned can we make it easy?\n\n334\n00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:54.428\nWell, we can make it\neven easier than that.\n\n335\n00:18:54.428 --> 00:18:58.900\nIf we right-click, we can actually\npin this to the Start if I wanted to.\n\n336\n00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:02.690\nAnd you could go into\nthe Start menu here and\n\n337\n00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:04.200\nthere it is right there in the Start menu.\n\n338\n00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.330\nSo you could make it even easier for\na user.\n\n339\n00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.130\nIt's right there on the Start menu.\n\n340\n00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:10.200\nYou could also create\na shortcut if you wanted to.\n\n341\n00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.510\nA lot of times that happens and\nwe put it on the desktop.\n\n342\n00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:16.580\nSo remember, just as a real quick recap,\nremember your permission.\n\n343\n00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:20.487\nShare permissions combined with NTSF\npermissions happen when you connect to\n\n344\n00:19:20.487 --> 00:19:23.350\nthis resource like we've\ndone over the network.\n\n345\n00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:26.295\nAnd I don't care what side of\nthe tracks is more restrictive.\n\n346\n00:19:26.295 --> 00:19:29.675\nIf NTSF says read and\nyou have full control share?\n\n347\n00:19:29.675 --> 00:19:32.560\nRead permission becomes\nthe effective permission.\n\n348\n00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:38.942\nYou reverse it, and I have now read-share,\nbut I've got full control NTFS.\n\n349\n00:19:38.942 --> 00:19:41.860\nIf I connect to it over the network,\ndoesn't matter what those NTFS\n\n350\n00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.624\npermissions say because the most\nrestrictive is gonna win out,\n\n351\n00:19:44.624 --> 00:19:46.840\nand you might not have\nthe level of access you want.\n\n352\n00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:50.770\nSo just remember that interaction\nbetween the combination of\n\n353\n00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:51.560\nthose two permission sets.\n\n354\n00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:54.690\n&gt;&gt; Well, Wes,\nthat's a lot of information for\n\n355\n00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:59.740\nus to remember about the idea of using\nthese share permissions to help us to\n\n356\n00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:03.510\ngain access to resources that are not\ndirectly connected to our computers.\n\n357\n00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:06.940\nAnd it's something that you will see\nevery day inside of a corporate or\n\n358\n00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:08.800\ninside of a business environment.\n\n359\n00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:13.510\nBecause most of the resources are not\nlocated directly on our desktop computers.\n\n360\n00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:16.497\nBut having said that, there's\nactually a lot more for us to cover.\n\n361\n00:20:16.497 --> 00:20:19.782\nWhich means we're gonna be coming back for\na part three in\n\n362\n00:20:19.782 --> 00:20:24.233\nextending this particular little mini\nseries out here on file permissions,\n\n363\n00:20:24.233 --> 00:20:26.730\nas well as the file system and shares.\n\n364\n00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:28.290\nSo there's a lot more for us to come and\n\n365\n00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:30.900\nit's a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n366\n00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:34.515\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n367\n00:20:34.515 --> 00:20:35.485\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n368\n00:20:35.485 -->

00:00:08.215\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.215 --> 00:00:12.276\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.276 --> 00:00:16.111\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITProTV, I'm your host\n\n6\n00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:20.248\nMike Rodrick and today, we're doing our\nWindows operating system fundamental.\n\n7\n00:00:20.248 --> 00:00:21.878\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n8\n00:00:21.878 --> 00:00:24.870\nwe're gonna be looking at\nunderstanding encryption.\n\n9\n00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.870\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nWes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:27.640\nHow you doing Wes?\n\n11\n00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.830\n&gt;&gt; Man I'm doing great Mike,\nthanks for having me here.\n\n12\n00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.710\nAlways a pleasure to be here with ITProTV.\n\n13\n00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.390\nThat's right, we're gonna be looking at\nMTA Windows operating system fundamentals.\n\n14\n00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.420\nAnd one of the things that they call out,\nif you look at\n\n15\n00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.400\nthe exam objectives is a little bit\nof just understanding encryption.\n\n16\n00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.460\nThey don't want you to become\npart of a hacking division.\n\n17\n00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.820\nYou certainly don't have\nto go out to Vegas and\n\n18\n00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.360\nI don't know what the heck the\ncompetitions are that you have out there.\n\n19\n00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.243\nIt's really not on that level, just\nkinda understanding what is encryption.\n\n20\n00:00:56.243 --> 00:00:58.397\nWhy do we even use it and\nwhere does it apply and\n\n21\n00:00:58.397 --> 00:01:00.560\nthen also maybe even how\ndo you implement it.\n\n22\n00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.140\nSo that's one of the things\nthat we're gonna look at today.\n\n23\n00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.080\nThe other thing that we're gonna look at\nis the technology that's been in Windows\n\n24\n00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.760\nfor a little while.\n\n25\n00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.270\nI mean it goes back to the days of Vista.\n\n26\n00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.000\nAnd honestly, there's a lot of different\ntechnologies out there that could help you\n\n27\n00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.620\ndo this outside of Windows but just\nkeep in mind that if it's an MTA exam.\n\n28\n00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.290\nChances are, they're not gonna be\nasking you about the third party\n\n29\n00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.810\ndrive encryption technologies.\n\n30\n00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.880\nThey'll be asking you about Microsoft's\nflagship in correct drive or\n\n31\n00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.160\ndisk encryption utility known\nas BitLocker technology.\n\n32\n00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.010\nSo those are a couple of\nthe things that we'll look,\n\n33\n00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.270\nwe'll talk a little bit about\nsomething known as EFS,\n\n34\n00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.490\nthe encrypted file system that has\nbeen in Windows for a while now.\n\n35\n00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.701\nAnd then again, we'll gonna talk\nabout BitLocker drive encryption.\n\n36\n00:01:39.701 --> 00:01:41.360\n&gt;&gt; Wes, I get that question a lot.\n\n37\n00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.070\nPeople come here and ask I know BitLocker,\nI know what it does kind of an idea.\n\n38\n00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.200\nI know EFS, why do we have both but\nthere is a big difference\n\n39\n00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.472\nbetween the two right and what they do and\nwhere I might implement them.\n\n40\n00:01:53.472 --> 00:01:56.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n41\n00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.900\nAnd there's a lot of criticisms\ntoo with things that go probably,\n\n42\n00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.380\nI'm sure along with those questions\nwho when it comes to BitLocker.\n\n43\n00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.700\nIt's not that strong\nwhen it drive encryption.\n\n44\n00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.520\nIt doesn't help people or whatever.\n\n45\n00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.870\nYou might hear some negative reviews.\n\n46\n00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.690\nYou might hear some positive reviews.\n\n47\n00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.650\nOne of the things to understand about\nBitLocker is what it was intended for.\n\n48\n00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.860\nIt's one think if you say well,\nthat tractor that I have out there doesn't\n\n49\n00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.854\nreally do good on the drag strip\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n50\n00:02:19.854 --> 00:02:21.079\n&gt;&gt; Well it shouldn't,\n\n51\n00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:23.400\nit wasn't meant to be on the drag strip.\n\n52\n00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.290\nSo we have to understand what BitLocker\n\n53\n00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.670\nis to understand if it's doing it's job or\nnot.\n\n54\n00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.190\nWell, BitLocker is a drive\nencryption technology.\n\n55\n00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.400\nIt's a full disk encryption technology and\nwhat it allows me to do is take the entire\n\n56\n00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.560\ncontents of the hard drive\nthat's in a system or\n\n57\n00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.320\neven multiple drives and\ndo a bit by bit disk encryption of it.\n\n58\n00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.300\nNow, understand that one of\nthe things that BitLocker,\n\n59\n00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.030\nits main thing that it's supposed to do\nis prevent from offline data attacks.\n\n60\n00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.930\nYou gotta understand that, all right.\n\n61\n00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.650\nBitLocker was never meant to be\nsomething that would protect\n\n62\n00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.918\nyour files when your system is on.\n\n63\n00:03:00.918 --> 00:03:02.580\nRight, because if your system is on,\n\n64\n00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.670\nthink about what somebody has to do\nin order to steal the data, right?\n\n65\n00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.270\nThey just have to use things\nlike network attacks.\n\n66\n00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.170\nMaybe you've got physical attacks that\nthey can do where they can reach over and\n\n67\n00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.060\ngrab the whole machine.\n\n68\n00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.210\nSo BitLocker doesn't help\nprotect against those things.\n\n69\n00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.379\nWhat it helps to do is encrypt your the\ndata, so that when you turn the hard drive\n\n70\n00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:24.312\noff, if anybody tries to boot the system\nand they don't have a password.\n\n71\n00:03:24.312 --> 00:03:28.539\nOr another way to authenticate to\nthe BitLocker subsystem the drive stays\n\n72\n00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:30.400\nencrypted it doesn't unlock.\n\n73\n00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.880\nSo you can't see\nthe information that's on it.\n\n74\n00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.070\nAll right, the other thing is what\nhappens if I pull that drive?\n\n75\n00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.840\nYou say, well, okay, what happens\nif I just pull the drive out and\n\n76\n00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.420\nI decide I'm gonna take\nit to another machine.\n\n77\n00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.750\nYeah, I'm gonna put it in that machine,\nI'm gonna turn it on.\n\n78\n00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.828\nAll right, well, BitLocker is looking for\nsome authentication information.\n\n79\n00:03:46.828 --> 00:03:51.380\nLooking for some a little bit of security\ninformation that it isn't going to find.\n\n80\n00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.190\nWhen its put into that other system and\nthe system's fired up.\n\n81\n00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.230\nSo understand that, first and foremost,\nwhat BitLocker helps us to do,\n\n82\n00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.550\nis do a bit by bit encryption of\nthe entire contents of the hard drive and\n\n83\n00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.400\nit makes sure that we have\noffline data protection.\n\n84\n00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.610\nThat's one of the big\nthings to keep in mind.\n\n85\n00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.690\nBut what do you do to encrypt files on,\n\n86\n00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.880\nmaybe a system that you never turn off,\nright?\n\n87\n00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.810\nMaybe I want to encrypt files but\nI don't wanna do a full disk encryption.\n\n88\n00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.680\nOr even more so, maybe you might\nwanna really be secure, right?\n\n89\n00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.540\nWe really wanna aim for\nthe sky here on this one.\n\n90\n00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.261\nAnd we wanna not only have disk encryption\nbut while our drive is online and\n\n91\n00:04:30.261 --> 00:04:32.493\nwe're working with our operating system.\n\n92\n00:04:32.493 --> 00:04:37.207\nMaybe we wanna way to encrypt individual\nfiles, just as a way to make sure that\n\n93\n00:04:37.207 --> 00:04:41.130\nother people can't gain access\nto them when the machine is on.\n\n94\n00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.710\nSo understand that BitLocker is\nabout offline data protection.\n\n95\n00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.639\nWhere EFS is offline and\nonline data protection and\n\n96\n00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:53.336\nthat's one of the big characteristics that\nwe gotta keep in mind is why do they have\n\n97\n00:04:53.336 --> 00:04:56.833\nthese two technologies if\nthey're both doing encryption.\n\n98\n00:04:56.833 --> 00:04:59.597\nThey both have very different\nroles inside of our network or\n\n99\n00:04:59.597 --> 00:05:02.200\ninside of our operating\nsystem infrastructure.\n\n100\n00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.050\n&gt;&gt; Very cool, very cool so\nEFS is protecting individual files and\n\n101\n00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.290\nprimarily while the system is up and\nrunning and online.\n\n102\n00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.360\nBitLocker is encrypting the entire\ndrive and really protect me from\n\n103\n00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.970\nsomebody stealing the laptop itself or\npulling a hard drive out of a system.\n\n104\n00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:18.750\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n105\n00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.780\nAnd there are other systems out there too.\n\n106\n00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.953\nAgain, on a Microsoft exam, they're gonna\nask you about and Microsoft utilities but\n\n107\n00:05:25.953 --> 00:05:29.570\nwe've got other ones, TrueCrypt is\none of them that comes to mind there.\n\n108\n00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.270\nI know it's recently had a name change.\n\n109\n00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.012\nI can't think of what the name is now but\nit also does full disk encryption.\n\n110\n00:05:35.012 --> 00:05:37.770\nWe wanna focus here in this episode\n\n111\n00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.800\non the ones that you're gonna\nsee potentially on the exam.\n\n112\n00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.440\nMore importantly,\n\n113\n00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.911\nthe ones that you're gonna see inside of\nthe Windows operating system by default.\n\n114\n00:05:43.911 --> 00:05:45.806\nSo what we're going to do,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n115\n00:05:45.806 --> 00:05:48.570\nso that's a little bit about\nwhat we're going to do.\n\n116\n00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.590\nRather than just talk about it right,\nlet me go ahead and show you what I mean.\n\n117\n00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.860\nI've got a Windows 10 machine here.\n\n118\n00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.150\nAnd what I'm gonna do,\nif we take a look at my screen.\n\n119\n00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.130\nWe're gonna go ahead and\n\n120\n00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:02.200\nwe're going to navigate into a location\nand I am logged in as the administrator.\n\n121\n00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.080\nAnd really when it comes\ndown to this EFS doesn't\n\n122\n00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.630\nrequire administrative\nlevel privileges all right.\n\n123\n00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.110\nSome things requires,\nas we've been seeing in past episodes,\n\n124\n00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.580\nsome require you to be an administrator,\nsome require you to be or\n\n125\n00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.670\nit doesn't matter,\nyou can be a standard user.\n\n126\n00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.020\nNow I will tell you, you're gonna see\nthat there would be a difference in this\n\n127\n00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.980\nadministrative level\nversus non administrative.\n\n128\n00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.823\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nwe're gonna create a file.\n\n129\n00:06:25.823 --> 00:06:29.271\nI'm gonna just go ahead, I'll navigate\ndown in to, I'll tell you what,\n\n130\n00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:32.066\nwe'll use the search functionality\nhere in File Explorer,\n\n131\n00:06:32.066 --> 00:06:35.660\nI really like this cuz you don't really\nhave to type the direct path anymore.\n\n132\n00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.050\nFile Explorer's kinda intuitive enough.\n\n133\n00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.250\nIt knows where you're looking.\n\n134\n00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.110\nPublic documents are kinda\nhidden out today.\n\n135\n00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.120\nSo I just type in, Public.\n\n136\n00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.390\nAnd it comes up and sure enough,\nyou can see it right there.\n\n137\n00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.850\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll put this in public documents.\n\n138\n00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:54.380\nNow, the reason I'm putting this\nin public documents is well,\n\n139\n00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.470\nit's exactly what it says.\n\n140\n00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:56.620\nIt's public, right?\n\n141\n00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.970\nSo anybody who has access to this machine.\n\n142\n00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.770\nWhen they log in and obviously,\nthey have to have an account.\n\n143\n00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.700\nBut when the log in they should have\naccess to the files that are placed\n\n144\n00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.800\nin the public documents\nwhat we've got them that.\n\n145\n00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.227\nSo we're gonna go ahead and do that,\nin fact as created as I am.\n\n146\n00:07:12.227 --> 00:07:15.145\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ncreate a text document and Mike,\n\n147\n00:07:15.145 --> 00:07:17.300\nwe will just call this secret.\n\n148\n00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.053\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; All right [LAUGH] inside my secret\n\n149\n00:07:19.053 --> 00:07:20.180\ndocument.\n\n150\n00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.530\nWell, we'll go ahead and do what everybody\nshould do, writing passwords down.\n\n151\n00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.295\nThat's completely secure, right?\n\n152\n00:07:25.295 --> 00:07:27.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't do that, I'm kidding.\n\n153\n00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.430\nAll right, and we'll call this\nLuggage Password because again,\n\n154\n00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.060\nmy creativity is impeccable.\n\n155\n00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.150\nAnd we'll call this 123456.\n\n156\n00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:37.510\nMike, do not tell anybody please.\n\n157\n00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:38.604\n&gt;&gt; I won't.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right.\n\n158\n00:07:38.604 --> 00:07:39.780\n&gt;&gt; Your secret is safe with me.\n\n159\n00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:44.310\n&gt;&gt; That's right, we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna save the file, all right?\n\n160\n00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:47.491\nNow, what I'm gonna do here\nis in a previous episode,\n\n161\n00:07:47.491 --> 00:07:50.267\nwe talked about file permissions,\nall right?\n\n162\n00:07:50.267 --> 00:07:52.660\nAnd I want you to understand\nthat when you look at this,\n\n163\n00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.901\nthere are two different things,\nit completely separate technologies.\n\n164\n00:07:55.901 --> 00:07:57.262\nFile permissions, yes.\n\n165\n00:07:57.262 --> 00:08:01.392\nThey dictate who has access to a file and\nat what level of access they have.\n\n166\n00:08:01.392 --> 00:08:03.730\nBut it's completely separate from EFS.\n\n167\n00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:05.798\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n168\n00:08:05.798 --> 00:08:09.220\nIf I right-click on this text document\nhere that we just create, and\n\n169\n00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.515\nwe choose Properties,\nwe can see, really see,\n\n170\n00:08:12.515 --> 00:08:16.480\nthe ACL that we talked about\nin other episodes, right?\n\n171\n00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.370\nThese are all of our permission, okay?\n\n172\n00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:21.140\nNow, here's what I'm gonna do.\n\n173\n00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.800\nI want you to understand that\nthey are separate technologies.\n\n174\n00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.180\nI control who has access to a file and\na level of access.\n\n175\n00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.560\nBut when the Window's sub system looks at\nit, it's looking at two different things.\n\n176\n00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.705\nI'll tell you what, let me go ahead and\ndemonstrate what I'm talking about here.\n\n177\n00:08:35.705 --> 00:08:37.710\nI've made Mike and\nan account on this machine here.\n\n178\n00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:41.980\nWe'll pick on Mike here since he's been so\nkind to host the show with me.\n\n179\n00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.810\nAnd I already got an account,\n\n180\n00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:47.290\nand provided I can spell Mike,\nI should be able to find it here.\n\n181\n00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.700\nSo we'll go ahead and\ndo a check names, and there he is.\n\n182\n00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.120\nMike is in the list.\n\n183\n00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.380\nAll right, so\nat this point Mike has Read access, right?\n\n184\n00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.160\nHe has Read &amp; Execute.\n\n185\n00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.450\nBut you know what?\n\n186\n00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.020\nWe're gonna live dangerously, right?\n\n187\n00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:03.281\nAnd I mean dangerous when you give\nMike full control of something, right?\n\n188\n00:09:03.281 --> 00:09:05.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we'll go ahead and\n\n189\n00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.380\nwe're gonna give him full control,\nand we're gonna choose OK.\n\n190\n00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.500\nAnd then OK.\n\n191\n00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:15.890\nNow, I know this isn't an episode on\npermissions, but as a just a quick recap.\n\n192\n00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.000\nIf I give Mike full control,\n\n193\n00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.950\nhe should be able to do whatever\nhe wants with the document, right?\n\n194\n00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:22.810\nHe can even take ownership and say, Wes,\nyour secrets are no longer safe, and\n\n195\n00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:23.670\nthey're now my secrets.\n\n196\n00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:24.860\nAnd take ownership over the file.\n\n197\n00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:28.300\nSo, he really shouldn't\nhave any restricted access.\n\n198\n00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.850\nAll right, but does he?\n\n199\n00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.350\nAll right, at this point he doesn't,\nhe's got full control.\n\n200\n00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:36.380\nWhat happens now if I right-click on this,\nand I choose Properties again?\n\n201\n00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.270\nNotice we have these attributes down here,\nand\n\n202\n00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.480\nwe've kinda talked about\nattributes as well.\n\n203\n00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:45.835\nOne of the things that we mentioned with\nattributes is it does give me the ability,\n\n204\n00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:50.775\nif I need to, to mark it as Read-only,\nor mark it as Hidden, okay?\n\n205\n00:09:50.775 --> 00:09:53.205\nBut if I choose the Advanced button here,\n\n206\n00:09:53.205 --> 00:09:56.065\nnow we've got a little\nbit more that we can do.\n\n207\n00:09:56.065 --> 00:09:58.235\nNotice that I can compress, right?\n\n208\n00:09:58.235 --> 00:09:59.168\nThat's part of NTFS.\n\n209\n00:09:59.168 --> 00:10:02.918\nAnd the other beauty of NTFS, the file\nsystem that we've also talked about,\n\n210\n00:10:02.918 --> 00:10:04.890\nis the encryption attribute.\n\n211\n00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:09.930\nWhen I add the encryption attribute,\nall right, what I can do is,\n\n212\n00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.300\nand I know I did that kind of fast.\n\n213\n00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.210\nLet me just slow down a little bit so\nyou guys can see what I do there.\n\n214\n00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:17.940\nI choose Encrypt contents to secure data,\nall right?\n\n215\n00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.400\nAnd then we just have the OK option here.\n\n216\n00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.850\nChoose OK.\n\n217\n00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:25.600\nDoesn't seem like it's done much,\nand then we hit OK again.\n\n218\n00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.590\nNow, it's given me the option here,\nguys, understand,\n\n219\n00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:30.070\njust kind of like we\ntalked about permissions,\n\n220\n00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:33.030\nwe say permission inheritance if\nI assign it at the folder level.\n\n221\n00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:36.340\nAny files that I put inside of that\nfolder, or sub-folders, right?\n\n222\n00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:37.490\nThey inherit that down.\n\n223\n00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:40.080\nWell, EFS also does inheritance as well.\n\n224\n00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.594\nNotice that it's asking me do I wanna\nencrypt the file and it's parent folder,\n\n225\n00:10:43.594 --> 00:10:44.912\nthe container that it's in?\n\n226\n00:10:44.912 --> 00:10:47.449\nNow, it is recommended, okay?\n\n227\n00:10:47.449 --> 00:10:48.940\nBut these are public documents.\n\n228\n00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.120\nI don't want to encrypt that folder,\nright?\n\n229\n00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.886\nThat's not the right folder to encrypt,\nright?\n\n230\n00:10:52.886 --> 00:10:55.330\nYou could start having problems\nwith your operating system.\n\n231\n00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:59.460\nSo it's just a purpose to show you\nwhat somebody should have access to.\n\n232\n00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.050\nThey don't, you've encrypted it.\n\n233\n00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:03.115\nYou've scrambled the data with EFS.\n\n234\n00:11:03.115 --> 00:11:05.242\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna live dangerously,\n\n235\n00:11:05.242 --> 00:11:06.949\nand we're gonna go against the grain,\nright?\n\n236\n00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:07.685\nNot recommended.\n\n237\n00:11:07.685 --> 00:11:09.297\nWe'll choose OK.\n\n238\n00:11:09.297 --> 00:11:12.175\nAll right, let's see,\nI don't know if it's gonna come up, okay,\n\n239\n00:11:12.175 --> 00:11:14.020\nit's down here in the bottom.\n\n240\n00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:16.760\nYes, here's something I\nwant you guys to see.\n\n241\n00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.070\nAnd this is kind of important, and\nI know it's kind of tucked away for\n\n242\n00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:23.250\nyou guys that have been in Windows for\na while, the Sys tray notification area.\n\n243\n00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.620\nWhatever you might like to say.\n\n244\n00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:29.840\nNotice that it says encrypting file system\nthere, back up your file encryption.\n\n245\n00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.700\nIt kind of trailed off there,\nlet me try that again.\n\n246\n00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.650\nNotice it says encryption key.\n\n247\n00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:35.820\nThat is important, right?\n\n248\n00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:40.140\nWe need our encryption key\nto have access to this file.\n\n249\n00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:43.950\nSo I just wanna take a quick second\nbefore we show you what it's doing, and\n\n250\n00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.230\nlet you know that is a thing to do.\n\n251\n00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:49.690\nIf you're in a domain environment,\ntypically your admin will give you\n\n252\n00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:53.130\nthe option to back up these keys to\nActive Directory so that we can implement\n\n253\n00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:57.640\nsomething known as a KRA and a DRA, data\nrecovery agent and a key recovery agent,\n\n254\n00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.820\nso that we can recover them in case\nthe key gets corrupted or lost.\n\n255\n00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:02.870\nThat's important.\n\n256\n00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:06.040\nMake sure you have a copy of this\nkey cuz the moment I encrypt it,\n\n257\n00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.010\nif I no longer have that\nprivate key it gets corrupted.\n\n258\n00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.190\nGuess what?\n\n259\n00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:11.711\nI lose access to the data as well.\n\n260\n00:12:11.711 --> 00:12:14.763\nSo that's just a real quick warning there\nthat you can get yourself in a lot of\n\n261\n00:12:14.763 --> 00:12:15.810\ntrouble there.\n\n262\n00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:17.898\nEspecially with a secret\npassword to your luggage.\n\n263\n00:12:17.898 --> 00:12:19.213\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n264\n00:12:19.213 --> 00:12:24.200\nAll right, so at this point we\nhave locked Mike out, right?\n\n265\n00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.630\nWe gave him full control,\nbut we also encrypted EFS.\n\n266\n00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:30.260\nHas it truly locked Mike out?\n\n267\n00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:31.340\nI don't know, let's find out.\n\n268\n00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:36.560\nSo I'm gonna go ahead, and I'm gonna\ndo my worst impression here of Mike\n\n269\n00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.770\nbecause I'm horrible at impressions so\nI won't even bother you.\n\n270\n00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:43.084\nAnd we're gonna do a fast user switch,\nall right?\n\n271\n00:12:43.084 --> 00:12:46.590\nNow, let me be careful\nwhen I tell you that.\n\n272\n00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:51.960\nHad Mike already been logged in, I would\nhave had him log out the account and\n\n273\n00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.160\nthen log back in.\n\n274\n00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.370\nRemember, ACLs don't adjust themselves for\nmissions and groups.\n\n275\n00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:00.730\nUntil you log off and then you log\nback in if you're already signed in.\n\n276\n00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:05.572\nAnd at this point he wasn't logged in, so\nwhen Windows goes to authenticate him,\n\n277\n00:13:05.572 --> 00:13:09.220\nit looks at those SIDs and\nall of those access control lists and\n\n278\n00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.206\nit applies them appropriately.\n\n279\n00:13:11.206 --> 00:13:15.509\nHad he been logged in, I would have had\nhim log out and log back in, all right?\n\n280\n00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:17.495\nJust a little note there, side note.\n\n281\n00:13:17.495 --> 00:13:18.550\nOkay, so here we go.\n\n282\n00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:22.388\nWe've got our File Explorer open,\nall right?\n\n283\n00:13:22.388 --> 00:13:24.117\nAnd I'm gonna take advantage\nof of the Search feature.\n\n284\n00:13:24.117 --> 00:13:28.990\nIt's actually in the user's profile,\nthis public documents and public music.\n\n285\n00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:31.677\nLet's try that again, just a bit outside.\n\n286\n00:13:31.677 --> 00:13:35.685\nAnd I hate digging down in\nthe file system to find it, so\n\n287\n00:13:35.685 --> 00:13:38.860\nI love this search functionality.\n\n288\n00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.721\nOkay, so\ncan Mike review things like attributes?\n\n289\n00:13:41.721 --> 00:13:43.270\nCan he review permissions?\n\n290\n00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:43.984\nWell, let's see.\n\n291\n00:13:43.984 --> 00:13:45.400\nWe gave him full control.\n\n292\n00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.290\nIf you remember our permissions episode,\n\n293\n00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:50.660\nhe should still be able to\nsee permissions, right?\n\n294\n00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:55.200\nWith basic Read permission,\nhe is in the Access Control List and\n\n295\n00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.270\nhe has full control.\n\n296\n00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:59.849\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet him dive into my secret document.\n\n297\n00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:02.670\nOr not.\n\n298\n00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:04.380\nSo what's happening there?\n\n299\n00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:09.930\nKeep in mind that the Access Control List\nis completely separate from EFS or\n\n300\n00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:12.450\nthe encrypted file system, all right?\n\n301\n00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:15.940\nSo we can control who\nhas access to a file and\n\n302\n00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:19.550\nwhat level of access they\nhave by their identity.\n\n303\n00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:24.730\nBut when I encrypt with EFS,\nnow the authorization is handled\n\n304\n00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:29.530\nby the private key that's associated with\nthat account that encrypted the file.\n\n305\n00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:32.170\nSo notice that Mike doesn't\nhave access anymore.\n\n306\n00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:34.100\nAnd another thing that I want to show you.\n\n307\n00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.250\nThis is kind of new.\n\n308\n00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:39.970\nSome of you guys that have been\naround Windows 8, 8.1, Windows 7,\n\n309\n00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:42.775\nWindows Vista,\nthey've kinda changed the way you used to,\n\n310\n00:14:42.775 --> 00:14:46.950\nyou used to be able to figure out right\naway that, hey, something's encrypted.\n\n311\n00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:48.470\nMike, do you remember how I could do that?\n\n312\n00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:51.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the file would be green, if it\nwas encrypted, or the name of the file\n\n313\n00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:54.500\nwould be listed as green if it was\nencrypted or blue for compressed.\n\n314\n00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:55.730\n&gt;&gt; That's absolutely right.\n\n315\n00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:59.300\nAnd you notice that none\nof them are here [LAUGH].\n\n316\n00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.850\nIt's kinda hard to see it.\n\n317\n00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:04.530\nAnd I'll show you, in fact,\nit gets even worse if I choose list view.\n\n318\n00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:05.835\nYou can't see that, guys.\n\n319\n00:15:05.835 --> 00:15:07.890\nYou'd have to zoom in a lot.\n\n320\n00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:10.980\nBut let's make that easy for\npeople like me who have four eyes.\n\n321\n00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.030\nNow there we go.\n\n322\n00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.910\nNice big lock.\n\n323\n00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:16.548\nIt let's you know that\nthe encrypted file system is there.\n\n324\n00:15:16.548 --> 00:15:20.980\nAll right, so as you can see,\nI can control access.\n\n325\n00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:24.930\nAnd we gotta be careful with that because,\nagain, it's not an Access Control List.\n\n326\n00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:28.550\nBut I can control who has access to\na file just by encrypting it, and\n\n327\n00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:30.370\nI am the only one that can see it.\n\n328\n00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:33.800\nAnd that's one of the benefits\nof the encrypted file system.\n\n329\n00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.590\nNow, notice everything is online, right?\n\n330\n00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:40.870\nWhen it comes down to it,\nif I am logged in to a machine, and\n\n331\n00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:42.310\nlet's say I walk away.\n\n332\n00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:46.010\nWell, my private key's in\nmemory right now, right?\n\n333\n00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:49.730\nThe encryption, might want to mention\nthis too, is file level encryption.\n\n334\n00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:51.898\nSo it's transparent to the user here,\nright?\n\n335\n00:15:51.898 --> 00:15:55.839\nIf I'm logged in to the machine as\nthe user that encrypts the file, in fact,\n\n336\n00:15:55.839 --> 00:15:58.978\nrather than, I tell you what,\nrather than talk about that,\n\n337\n00:15:58.978 --> 00:16:02.453\nlet me go ahead and just do a fast\nuser switch And we'll log back in.\n\n338\n00:16:02.453 --> 00:16:06.128\nIt becomes completely transparent to me,\nall right?\n\n339\n00:16:06.128 --> 00:16:10.009\nAnd that might be another thing, I'm not\nsure if it comes up on the exam, but\n\n340\n00:16:10.009 --> 00:16:14.210\nfile level encryption is really good for\nthe user that has done the encryption.\n\n341\n00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:14.900\nWhy?\n\n342\n00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.280\nBecause I don't have to worry\nabout entering a password.\n\n343\n00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.110\nNotice what happens when I open it up.\n\n344\n00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:22.640\nI open the file up,\nI didn't have to enter a password, right?\n\n345\n00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.820\nSo it's transparent to the end-user.\n\n346\n00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.270\nSo for me, it's perfect.\n\n347\n00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:30.180\nI can encrypt a file and as I'm sitting\nthere using them, I open them and\n\n348\n00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.300\nI close them.\n\n349\n00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.540\nNow the question would be, what happens\nif I leave my computer unlocked and\n\n350\n00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:37.120\nI walk away, and Mike decides\nto change my desktop background?\n\n351\n00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:41.500\nWell, if my computer's\nunlocked there is no way for\n\n352\n00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.660\nthe operating system\nknow that it isn't Wes.\n\n353\n00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.447\nAll right, so this doesn't protect\nagainst bad security practices.\n\n354\n00:16:47.447 --> 00:16:50.793\nAnd that's where I think sometimes\nmaybe those questions come from, Mike,\n\n355\n00:16:50.793 --> 00:16:53.586\nlike a BitLocker, an EFS,\nthey say, well it doesn't do that.\n\n356\n00:16:53.586 --> 00:16:55.698\nIt was never meant to.\n\n357\n00:16:55.698 --> 00:16:58.626\nSo understanding what the principle\nis might give you a better\n\n358\n00:16:58.626 --> 00:17:00.665\nunderstanding of how you should use this.\n\n359\n00:17:00.665 --> 00:17:02.735\nSo that's a little bit about EFS.\n\n360\n00:17:02.735 --> 00:17:05.752\nAgain, one final word of\ncaution that I would, again,\n\n361\n00:17:05.752 --> 00:17:09.157\nI would caution you is the fact\nthat back up the encryption key,\n\n362\n00:17:09.157 --> 00:17:12.197\nbecause if I lose,\nit doesn't matter if it's my file.\n\n363\n00:17:12.197 --> 00:17:15.907\nIf my encryption key gets lost,\nguess what?\n\n364\n00:17:15.907 --> 00:17:17.150\nI lose access to the data.\n\n365\n00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:20.560\nSo it's very important to do\nexactly what Windows says, and\n\n366\n00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.980\nmake sure you backup those keys.\n\n367\n00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.686\nIf you're in a domain environment,\nyou might not have the option, that might\n\n368\n00:17:24.686 --> 00:17:27.269\nbe controlled through a GPO inside of\nyour Active Directory environment.\n\n369\n00:17:27.269 --> 00:17:29.104\nAnd then you don't have to worry about it.\n\n370\n00:17:29.104 --> 00:17:34.151\nSo Mike that's a little bit about\nthe encrypted file system, but\n\n371\n00:17:34.151 --> 00:17:40.420\nwe do have to keep in mind that that is\nsomething that does a file by file basis.\n\n372\n00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:43.930\nNow we wanna go a little bit further,\nand that's where we wanna go, right?\n\n373\n00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:48.640\nWe can do a bit by bit encryption at\nthe disk level, complete disk encryption.\n\n374\n00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.540\nAnd we can do that with\nsomething known as BitLocker.\n\n375\n00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.880\nHowever, there are a couple of things\nthat I want you to know about BitLocker.\n\n376\n00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.610\nI've got a virtual machine right here, so\n\n377\n00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.550\nI'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna switch\nover to another machine that I have,\n\n378\n00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:03.610\nbecause I wanna talk a little bit\nabout what BitLocker is first of all.\n\n379\n00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:06.646\nAll right, first of all Bitlocker,\nwe talked about full drive encryption, but\n\n380\n00:18:06.646 --> 00:18:09.478\nthere are a couple of different methods\nin which you can use it, all right?\n\n381\n00:18:09.478 --> 00:18:12.838\nIt works in combination with\nsomething known as a TPM, all right?\n\n382\n00:18:12.838 --> 00:18:17.484\nNow I know what you guys are thinking,\nacronym soup or alphabet soup,\n\n383\n00:18:17.484 --> 00:18:19.471\nacronym city, what is a TPM?\n\n384\n00:18:19.471 --> 00:18:24.738\nFirst of all, first and foremost, TPM\nis not a Microsoft specific technology,\n\n385\n00:18:24.738 --> 00:18:28.700\nit is an industry wide\nhardware security platform.\n\n386\n00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.770\nTPM stands for\nthe Trusted Platform Module.\n\n387\n00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:33.390\nIt started back, I think it has\nbeen around for a while now.\n\n388\n00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:37.741\nIt's TCG, trusted computing group, they're\nthe independent third party body if you\n\n389\n00:18:37.741 --> 00:18:40.997\nwill that oversees this, and\nthis is an industry wide standard.\n\n390\n00:18:40.997 --> 00:18:41.754\nAnd what does it do?\n\n391\n00:18:41.754 --> 00:18:42.267\nAll right,\n\n392\n00:18:42.267 --> 00:18:45.817\nwell you might read some documentation\nthat says it's a cryptographic process.\n\n393\n00:18:45.817 --> 00:18:47.176\nWhat does that mean?\n\n394\n00:18:47.176 --> 00:18:50.540\nIt means a chip that hold security\ninformation when it comes down to it.\n\n395\n00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:54.998\nYou don't have to really make it much\nmore technical than that, right?\n\n396\n00:18:54.998 --> 00:18:59.624\nIt's a little hardware base chip that it\nis embedded in the device that it's on,\n\n397\n00:18:59.624 --> 00:19:02.086\nall right, that is unique to that device.\n\n398\n00:19:02.086 --> 00:19:04.102\nAnd what is BitLocker do?\n\n399\n00:19:04.102 --> 00:19:05.909\nWell, when I turn on BitLocker,\n\n400\n00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:10.252\nit actually looks through a TPM that\nis storing security information, right?\n\n401\n00:19:10.252 --> 00:19:13.050\nIt's storing your encryption keys.\n\n402\n00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:14.400\nThe other thing that it stores too,\n\n403\n00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.940\nwhich is the industry-wide standard\npart is something known as PCRs.\n\n404\n00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.670\nYou don't have to worry\nabout this on the exam, but\n\n405\n00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:23.250\nthey're called platform\nconfiguration registers.\n\n406\n00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:27.780\nAll it means is, when my operating system\nboots up, looks to the TPM and says,\n\n407\n00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.670\nI expect these configurations.\n\n408\n00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.160\nThey're stored in that TPM,\ndo I find them?\n\n409\n00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.530\nIf I don't find them,\n\n410\n00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:38.050\nthen I know that something's been\ntampered with inside of the hardware.\n\n411\n00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:39.650\nCould be the operating system for\nall we know,\n\n412\n00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:42.250\ncuz it also goes to check\nzones on the hard drive.\n\n413\n00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:46.910\nAnd then that signal some\nkind of compromised, right?\n\n414\n00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:48.668\nExploit on the system.\nAnd it locks the machine down,\n\n415\n00:19:48.668 --> 00:19:52.294\nit doesn't allow you to get into the hard\ndrive and it throws into recovery mode.\n\n416\n00:19:52.294 --> 00:19:54.970\nNow that's a lot of talk.\n\n417\n00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:57.140\n[LAUGH] Let's go ahead and\nshow you what I mean.\n\n418\n00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:01.131\nNow this machine it isn't a virtual\nmachine actually, this is on our network,\n\n419\n00:20:01.131 --> 00:20:04.422\nactually over there where our host sit,\nand I am remoted in to it.\n\n420\n00:20:04.422 --> 00:20:05.060\nWhy?\n\n421\n00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.800\nWell, virtual machines,\nyou can't virtualize a TPM.\n\n422\n00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:12.266\nIt's a hardware-based chip, it's kind of\nlike an HSM, hardware security module,\n\n423\n00:20:12.266 --> 00:20:14.105\nthat stores encryption keys.\n\n424\n00:20:14.105 --> 00:20:15.615\nYou can't virtualize it, right?\n\n425\n00:20:15.615 --> 00:20:18.425\nIf I could virtualize it and\ndo a software representation of it,\n\n426\n00:20:18.425 --> 00:20:20.385\nthen I could exploit it as well.\n\n427\n00:20:20.385 --> 00:20:24.685\nSo it kind of defeats the purpose\nof hardware level security modules.\n\n428\n00:20:24.685 --> 00:20:27.560\nNow let's go ahead and\nlet's look at the TPM.\n\n429\n00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.750\nWell, where would I even\nsee that information?\n\n430\n00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:33.520\nWell, there's a couple of different\nways that you can do this, all right?\n\n431\n00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:38.308\nOne of the ways you can do,\nis you can just fire up PowerShell, or\n\n432\n00:20:38.308 --> 00:20:41.390\nyou can fire up your Command Prompt.\n\n433\n00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:44.950\nI tend to stick in PowerShell,\nbecause I can run commands that\n\n434\n00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:49.350\nare native to Command Prompt and\nPowerShell inside a PowerShell.\n\n435\n00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:52.167\nSo why work with two\ncommand line interfaces?\n\n436\n00:20:52.167 --> 00:20:54.434\nThat's how I do it.\n\n437\n00:20:54.434 --> 00:20:58.700\nYou don't have to do that for\nthe exam, I would be aware of both.\n\n438\n00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:04.215\nSo let's go ahead and let's type, here is\nthe command I want you to be aware of,\n\n439\n00:21:04.215 --> 00:21:07.915\nand the great thing is you're gonna\nnotice that it's actually executable,\n\n440\n00:21:07.915 --> 00:21:09.925\nit's a program that runs.\n\n441\n00:21:09.925 --> 00:21:14.310\nSo you can actually run this inside of\nthe Command Prompt just as you can inside\n\n442\n00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:18.165\na PowerShell, notice that\nPowerShell puts the .exe on it.\n\n443\n00:21:18.165 --> 00:21:20.235\nYou can put that,\nyou don't really have to,\n\n444\n00:21:20.235 --> 00:21:23.915\nyou could actually take\nthat off if it's implied.\n\n445\n00:21:23.915 --> 00:21:28.924\nSo I wanna find out, does my machine\nhave a TPM that's supported?\n\n446\n00:21:28.924 --> 00:21:31.359\nLet's find out.\nWe'll do manage-bde,\n\n447\n00:21:31.359 --> 00:21:36.020\nthen I'm just gonna choose\na space dash status.\n\n448\n00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.414\nAnd if you guys all kind of zoom in there,\n\n449\n00:21:37.414 --> 00:21:38.986\nand you guys can see\nthat a little bit better.\n\n450\n00:21:38.986 --> 00:21:40.978\nAnd we're gonna run that, all right?\n\n451\n00:21:40.978 --> 00:21:44.479\nNow notice what it tells me here,\nall right?\n\n452\n00:21:44.479 --> 00:21:47.971\nIt tells me,\nthere's a couple of drives, all right?\n\n453\n00:21:47.971 --> 00:21:51.052\nNow I want you to know I already\nstarted to encrypt one drive,\n\n454\n00:21:51.052 --> 00:21:54.750\ncuz I wanted to show you that you\ncould pause the encryption, all right?\n\n455\n00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:58.316\nSo I can get the state right now, okay,\n\n456\n00:21:58.316 --> 00:22:02.560\nof my BitLocker encryption.\n\n457\n00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.804\nNow this drive,\nnotice it says fully decrypted, right?\n\n458\n00:22:04.804 --> 00:22:07.670\nBitLocker version is none, all right?\n\n459\n00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:10.950\nAnd then notice that it says\nlock status protection.\n\n460\n00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:14.390\nWe got a lot of information here\nin key protectors, all right?\n\n461\n00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:16.380\nWell, what about TPM?\n\n462\n00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:20.200\nThis one says key protector TPM,\nbecause I do have one inside of it.\n\n463\n00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.890\nThat is something that's important.\n\n464\n00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:24.004\nWhen you use what's known as TPM mode, and\n\n465\n00:22:24.004 --> 00:22:26.307\nwe'll get into the opposite\nhere in a second.\n\n466\n00:22:26.307 --> 00:22:27.724\nLet me make sure I get these right.\n\n467\n00:22:27.724 --> 00:22:32.200\nYou have to have TPM 2.0,\nand it has to be enabled.\n\n468\n00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.930\nAll right, that's one of the things\nyour devices come by default,\n\n469\n00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:37.400\nthe TPM is enabled.\n\n470\n00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:41.830\nThat's a Microsoft thing, I'm not sure\nthat every system has to have TPM enabled.\n\n471\n00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:44.510\nBut Windows 10 devices today,\n\n472\n00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:48.420\nthey've got something in the specification\nthat says they have to be enabled.\n\n473\n00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:49.980\nThere are earlier versions of this.\n\n474\n00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:54.020\nKeep in mind there's a 1.2 that we\nwere using in Vista and Windows 7,\n\n475\n00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:56.700\nand I wanna say up to Windows 8 and 8.1.\n\n476\n00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.078\nIt's weaker security,\n\n477\n00:22:58.078 --> 00:23:03.010\nhowever 2.0 is what you wanna use inside\nof Windows 10 with BitLocker encryption.\n\n478\n00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:05.938\nAnd that is a potential exam alert\nthat I want you to be aware of,\n\n479\n00:23:05.938 --> 00:23:08.240\njust in case it shows up on the exam.\n\n480\n00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.795\nYou can also see the encryption method,\nright?\n\n481\n00:23:09.795 --> 00:23:14.810\nAnd Mike, I know you have more\nknowledge than any one person should\n\n482\n00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:16.900\nabout encryption technologies, right?\n\n483\n00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:21.570\nSo you can AES 128,\nnot a really high level of encryption.\n\n484\n00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:22.082\nI could show you, and\n\n485\n00:23:22.082 --> 00:23:23.833\nI'm gonna show you where you can\nactually manipulate that a little bit.\n\n486\n00:23:23.833 --> 00:23:26.976\nKeep in mind anytime we talk\nabout encryption, all right?\n\n487\n00:23:26.976 --> 00:23:30.574\nIf you're understanding encryption,\nthe higher the level of encryption,\n\n488\n00:23:30.574 --> 00:23:33.670\nthe longer it takes to get into your\nfiles and out of your files, and\n\n489\n00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:35.742\nthen overall to do the encryption process.\n\n490\n00:23:35.742 --> 00:23:40.400\nAnd what drives today being for\n8, 10 terabytes?\n\n491\n00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.647\nIf you encrypt this with a higher level\nencryption, you're in for a wait, right?\n\n492\n00:23:43.647 --> 00:23:46.619\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a little trade\noff between security and time,\n\n493\n00:23:46.619 --> 00:23:49.990\nbecause if it's going to decrypt\nevery time you start the machine up,\n\n494\n00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:51.953\nyou don't want it to take five minutes.\n\n495\n00:23:51.953 --> 00:23:55.840\nWe've done a lot of work to get\nthat boot time down to 30 seconds.\n\n496\n00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:56.511\n&gt;&gt; That's right, absolutely.\n\n497\n00:23:56.511 --> 00:23:58.930\nSo I can see that there's a TPM present,\n\n498\n00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:02.998\nwhat happens if I wanna see a little\nmore information about the TPM?\n\n499\n00:24:02.998 --> 00:24:06.109\nWell, the good thing is\nWindows has baked in it, and\n\n500\n00:24:06.109 --> 00:24:09.646\nMike I'm gonna jumping the tracks\non you on our notes here,\n\n501\n00:24:09.646 --> 00:24:14.054\ncuz I certainly did put in it, but\nit comes to mind and it's great to know.\n\n502\n00:24:14.054 --> 00:24:18.914\nIt's something called the TPM Manager,\nall right?\n\n503\n00:24:18.914 --> 00:24:24.594\nAnd let me see if I can remember,\nI wanna see it's just TPM management.\n\n504\n00:24:24.594 --> 00:24:28.366\nIf I can spell it right .msc,\nwe can find out here.\n\n505\n00:24:28.366 --> 00:24:30.207\nDarn it, that's not it.\n\n506\n00:24:30.207 --> 00:24:32.860\nYou can always tell when\nit's searching in the web,\n\n507\n00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.039\nCortona can't find what I am looking for.\n\n508\n00:24:35.039 --> 00:24:36.663\nSo you know what it is,\n\n509\n00:24:36.663 --> 00:24:41.700\nI'm making this way more difficult\nthan it has to be, tpm.msc.\n\n510\n00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:42.290\nThere it is.\n\n511\n00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:43.007\nThat's what we're looking for.\n\n512\n00:24:43.007 --> 00:24:45.670\nAnd this is the TPM\nmanagement console guys.\n\n513\n00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:50.022\nI'm not sure that it's gonna be on an MTA\nexam, but if they ask you about BitLocker\n\n514\n00:24:50.022 --> 00:24:53.829\nand you need to look at a TPM, and\nyou need to kinda see what's going on.\n\n515\n00:24:53.829 --> 00:24:57.990\nWell, just know that on the exam this is\nsomething that you can use in order to\n\n516\n00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:59.486\nprepare the TPM, maybe for\n\n517\n00:24:59.486 --> 00:25:03.490\ninstance you got a whole bunch of\ndevices that you're gonna deploy.\n\n518\n00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:06.870\nYou wanna reset all the TPMs, and\nthen assign them back to their owners, so\n\n519\n00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:09.790\nthat you could enable BitLocker,\nmight be something that you have to do.\n\n520\n00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:14.520\nSo manage-bde, and remember tpm.msc.\n\n521\n00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.200\nI'm making it a little bit too difficult,\nessentially what it is,\n\n522\n00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.940\nis the TPM management console.\n\n523\n00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:23.333\nCouple of ways you could manage those\nTPM chips on your devices for BitLocker.\n\n524\n00:25:23.333 --> 00:25:24.457\n&gt;&gt; Very good, Wes.\n\n525\n00:25:24.457 --> 00:25:27.020\nAll right, I know you got some\nmore stuff you wanna show us.\n\n526\n00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:28.781\nWe're gonna take a look at how\nwe can implement BitLocker.\n\n527\n00:25:28.781 --> 00:25:31.623\nBut unfortunately, we're out of time for\nthis particular episode.\n\n528\n00:25:31.623 --> 00:25:34.910\nWe'll have to come back and\nshow you the rest of it.\n\n529\n00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:36.000\nSo we appreciate that, Wes.\n\n530\n00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.970\nWe hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed this one.\n\n531\n00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:40.185\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n532\n00:25:40.185 --> 00:25:41.286\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n533\n00:25:41.286 --> 00:25:42.445\n&gt;&gt; And we'll

00:00:23.120\nAnd specifically in this one we're\ngonna be continuing our look\n\n9\n00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.930\ninto understanding encryption.\n\n10\n00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.640\nAnd here to do that for us is Mr.\nWes Bryan, how are you doing Wes?\n\n11\n00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.610\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great Mike.\n\n12\n00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.505\nYeah, I talked way too\nmuch in the first one.\n\n13\n00:00:30.505 --> 00:00:32.356\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We had a lot more information\n\n14\n00:00:32.356 --> 00:00:35.298\ngo through so we decided to come back and\ndo a part two.\n\n15\n00:00:35.298 --> 00:00:36.996\nMike gave me the old\n[SOUND] in the earlier one.\n\n16\n00:00:36.996 --> 00:00:39.574\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I do wanna kinda jump right back in\n\n17\n00:00:39.574 --> 00:00:44.530\nto where left off and in the last episode\nwe kind of mentioned, we showed you EFS.\n\n18\n00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.690\nKind of looked at what it was,\nhow it encrypts our files,\n\n19\n00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.390\nand kind of contrasted that to full\ndisk encryption a BitLocker uses.\n\n20\n00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.970\nWe kind of showed you how to\nview its status, as well.\n\n21\n00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.140\nOne of the things that we didn't show\nyou is really how to turn it on, and\n\n22\n00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.570\nwe said okay, we're gonna show you how\nto turn it on in the next episode.\n\n23\n00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.440\nWell, here's the next episode.\n\n24\n00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.860\nI do wanna kinda show you one other\nthing that I completely forgot.\n\n25\n00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.090\nI said Mike, I'm gonna show you\nwhere you can modify the level of\n\n26\n00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.720\nencryption in BitLocker and\nI didn't do that at all, so\n\n27\n00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.140\nwe're gonna jump in and that's where\nwere to pick up where we left off.\n\n28\n00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.770\nSo my machine here you'll see really\nhasn't changed much from the last episode,\n\n29\n00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:24.550\nfirst part of this.\n\n30\n00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.460\nBut we'll go ahead and\nwe'll close down our TPM manager.\n\n31\n00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.290\nAnd one of the things that we're gonna\ndo is we're gonna fire up one of\n\n32\n00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.470\nMike's favorite utilities here, GPEdit.\n\n33\n00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.810\nSo we're gonna look a little\nbit at group policy.\n\n34\n00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:41.680\nAnd again this really isn't about how\ngroup policy applies to your systems\n\n35\n00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.530\nother than just to show you some of\nthe configurations that you can do here.\n\n36\n00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.780\nFor the most part Mike you can\nhelp me if I'm wrong on this one.\n\n37\n00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.350\nThe majority of all the configurations\nthat you could do on\n\n38\n00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.800\na local GPO you could typically\ndo in a domain environment.\n\n39\n00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.130\nYou're not really gonna be using\nthe local group policy except for\n\n40\n00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.030\nmaybe some one off special cases.\n\n41\n00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.930\nThe majority of this is gonna be\ncontrolled by your domain administrator.\n\n42\n00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.570\nHowever, the settings\nare gonna be the same,\n\n43\n00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.380\nso if you're familiar with this interface,\n\n44\n00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.620\nyou might be familiar with it in some\naspects on the server side as well.\n\n45\n00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.600\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna dive in,\n\n46\n00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.780\nunderstand that this is a computer\nconfiguration settings,\n\n47\n00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.200\nnot sure if that's gonna\ncome up on the MTA exam.\n\n48\n00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.964\nBut if it does, I want you to know\ncuz we love our paths here right,\n\n49\n00:02:24.964 --> 00:02:29.740\nwe're gonna be under Computer\nConfiguration &gt; Administrative Templates.\n\n50\n00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.810\nI'm gonna scroll down\nhere just a little bit.\n\n51\n00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.740\nWindows Components, and love it,\nit's right there at the top, and\n\n52\n00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.050\nwe are going to look at\nBitLocker Drive Encryption.\n\n53\n00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.460\nI'll come back here to the GPO in a bit.\n\n54\n00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.010\nThere's gonna be some configuration\nthat we do have to do in here for\n\n55\n00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.870\nthe next configuration of BitLocker so\nwe will be back here.\n\n56\n00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.030\nAll right, so here we go inside of\nyour group policy settings here.\n\n57\n00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.370\nYou'll notice that I have a few\ndifferent options here, right?\n\n58\n00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.820\nLet me click off of there,\nnotice it says, drive encryption method,\n\n59\n00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.560\ndrive encryption method,\ndrive encryption method.\n\n60\n00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.260\nWhat happened?\n\n61\n00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.068\nDid they stutter when they were\ntyping out these settings?\n\n62\n00:03:07.068 --> 00:03:09.864\nIs three settings better than one?\n\n63\n00:03:09.864 --> 00:03:10.930\nWhat's going on here?\n\n64\n00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.180\nWell, remember in the first part I told\nyou that BitLocker's gone through some\n\n65\n00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.835\nchanges, right?\n\n66\n00:03:14.835 --> 00:03:20.702\n1.2 and now we're into 2.0,\nkinda interesting the TPM on this machine.\n\n67\n00:03:20.702 --> 00:03:24.366\nI was just telling Mike before we started\nit was actually the older version because\n\n68\n00:03:24.366 --> 00:03:26.420\nit's an older machine it's got the 1.2.\n\n69\n00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.483\nSo how does that relate\nto these settings and\n\n70\n00:03:28.483 --> 00:03:30.504\nwhy are there three different lines here?\n\n71\n00:03:30.504 --> 00:03:32.583\nWell, each one you can see Windows 8,\n\n72\n00:03:32.583 --> 00:03:36.940\nServer 2012 in fact if I hover over there\nwe'll do a little hover to discover.\n\n73\n00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.700\nYou can see the operating\nsystems are included in them.\n\n74\n00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.555\nNotice that this one right here is\nversion 1511 and higher, right.\n\n75\n00:03:45.555 --> 00:03:48.790\nAnniversary Update for you guys out there,\nmaybe you're not aware of that,\n\n76\n00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:49.650\nthat's 1607.\n\n77\n00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.070\nSo that applies, this settings\napplies to those machines as well.\n\n78\n00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.450\nIt's just the fact that as they upgrade\nBitlocker there is a little bit\n\n79\n00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.270\nmore that you can do, all right.\n\n80\n00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.400\nNotice that I've got three\nsettings here right.\n\n81\n00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.370\nI got operating system drives,\nfixed drives, and removable drives right\n\n82\n00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.550\nthat's the newer you can see at least\nWindows Server 2016 and Windows 10.\n\n83\n00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.300\nSince the MTA was updated to Windows 10,\n\n84\n00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.120\nchances are you might need\nto know this setting.\n\n85\n00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.030\nVersus the other settings,\nyou'll notice that it didn't give you that\n\n86\n00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.350\ngranular ability, you might notice\nthis here Mike, I only got one option.\n\n87\n00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.466\nIf I choose Enable, I choose\nthe encryption, the cipher strength for\n\n88\n00:04:28.466 --> 00:04:30.087\neverything in BitLocker.\n\n89\n00:04:30.087 --> 00:04:31.674\nHowever, they said, well,\n\n90\n00:04:31.674 --> 00:04:36.200\nmaybe somebody isn't using operating\nsystem drive encryption, right?\n\n91\n00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.670\nMaybe they don't need\n\n92\n00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.680\nan encryption strength set on well\nmaybe they do in the operating system.\n\n93\n00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.850\nBut they also wanna set the encryption\nmethod for BitLocker to go, right?\n\n94\n00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.380\nWell when I Enable this now I can say I\nwant this on my operating system drives.\n\n95\n00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.810\nIf I've got data drives plugged in\nextra drives I can encrypt those and\n\n96\n00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.410\nchoose the Cipher Strength right?\n\n97\n00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.570\nAnd you can see here guys,\nyeah, I can go to 256, 256 bit.\n\n98\n00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.260\nBut remember what Mike\nsaid in the first one?\n\n99\n00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.930\nThere is always the trade off, right.\n\n100\n00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.193\nThat trade off is increase, encreep,\nI don't know what that is, but\n\n101\n00:05:11.193 --> 00:05:13.310\nincrease encryption.\n\n102\n00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.650\nI end up making the more\ncomputational power to encrypt and\n\n103\n00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.840\ndecrypt the information.\n\n104\n00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.271\nAnd the encryption part,\nespecially at the beginning,\n\n105\n00:05:21.271 --> 00:05:22.847\ncould take forever on large drives.\n\n106\n00:05:22.847 --> 00:05:26.665\nSo you do have the ability to\nchange the encryption strength.\n\n107\n00:05:26.665 --> 00:05:30.040\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna Group Policy down for now.\n\n108\n00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.320\nI just wanted to show you that because I\ndid mention it in the first part of this\n\n109\n00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.220\nshow and\n\n110\n00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.010\nwell the episode and I certainly didn't\ndo you guys any justice by showing that.\n\n111\n00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.560\nAll right, so here we are inside\nof our Windows machine, all right?\n\n112\n00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.200\nAnd you'll notice that I do\nhave a drive here, right?\n\n113\n00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.960\nRemember this is manage-BDE -status\nis what gave us this output.\n\n114\n00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.450\nNotice I have a 10-gigabyte drive here,\nand it isn't encrypted.\n\n115\n00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.170\nLet's go ahead and\nlet's show you how you would do this.\n\n116\n00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:01.772\nNow, a couple different\nways that you can do this.\n\n117\n00:06:01.772 --> 00:06:02.550\nI'm gonna go ahead, and\n\n118\n00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.390\nI'll show you through the graphical user\ninterface how you can do this, all right.\n\n119\n00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:12.498\nIt's as easy as opening up File Explorer,\nfinding the disk that you want,\n\n120\n00:06:12.498 --> 00:06:18.160\nright-clicking on it, and choosing Turn\non BitLocker that's one of the ways.\n\n121\n00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.969\nBut I will tell you, Microsoft exams are\nnotorious for the one way that you like\n\n122\n00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:25.568\nto do something is not gonna be away\n[LAUGH] that they asked you on the exams.\n\n123\n00:06:25.568 --> 00:06:28.771\nSo let's show you another way to do this.\n\n124\n00:06:28.771 --> 00:06:31.350\nAnd what's kinda\ninteresting about this one,\n\n125\n00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:36.058\nthis also ports over to things like Vista,\nWIndows 8, 8.1, I forgot Windows 7,\n\n126\n00:06:36.058 --> 00:06:40.683\nI can't believe that, good operating\nsystem and then Windows 10 as well.\n\n127\n00:06:40.683 --> 00:06:45.730\nIf I right-click on my Windows charm and\nI choose a Control Panel here.\n\n128\n00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.730\nWe can get down into Control Panel and\n\n129\n00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.960\nyou'll see right here I have\nthe System and Security option, right.\n\n130\n00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.140\nNow if I got out here and\n\n131\n00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:59.190\nI do scroll down a little bit and\nget that into view so you guys can see it.\n\n132\n00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.340\nNotice I have BitLocker drive\nencryption here as well.\n\n133\n00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:07.810\nWell, if I choose this I'm basically\ngonna start the same wizard here.\n\n134\n00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.330\nAll right, but I want you to notice\nsomething, it's kind of interesting.\n\n135\n00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.520\nIt still thinks this computer\nis joined to a domain so\n\n136\n00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.440\nit's telling me some settings\nare managed by your administrator.\n\n137\n00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.510\nLittle does this computer know\nthat domain controllers long gone.\n\n138\n00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.353\nSo we should probably fix that for sure.\n\n139\n00:07:21.353 --> 00:07:26.270\n[LAUGH] But notice it does say that\nBitLocker encryption is paused.\n\n140\n00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.215\nI'll come back to that because\nthe process is gonna be the same,\n\n141\n00:07:29.215 --> 00:07:32.285\nI wanna show you some of the manipulations\nyou can do with the manage-bde and\n\n142\n00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:34.765\nit's hard to do that if it's\nthe middle of the an encryption.\n\n143\n00:07:34.765 --> 00:07:39.385\nSo notice it says Fixed data drive that\nwas that other option remember that when\n\n144\n00:07:39.385 --> 00:07:42.870\nwe were setting the Cipher strength\nin the older versions of Windows.\n\n145\n00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:46.200\nWe couldn't set that Cipher Strength\non this one setting.\n\n146\n00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.482\nNow, we can on Windows 10 and\nI choose Turn on BitLocker.\n\n147\n00:07:49.482 --> 00:07:53.248\nPlease understand that that is no\ndifferent than what we did when we\n\n148\n00:07:53.248 --> 00:07:54.671\nright-click, right?\n\n149\n00:07:54.671 --> 00:07:58.108\nWe right-click on the drive and File\nExplorer brings up this window and says,\n\n150\n00:07:58.108 --> 00:07:59.419\nhey Is that what you wanna do?\n\n151\n00:07:59.419 --> 00:08:02.845\nAlright so couple different ways how\nwe wanna unlock this drive if you\n\n152\n00:08:02.845 --> 00:08:05.220\nhave Smart Card Authentication\nimplemented.\n\n153\n00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.190\nIf you're doing something like EAPTLS, and\n\n154\n00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:12.000\nyour active directory got certificate\nservices, you can certainly use this,\n\n155\n00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.690\ndefinitely increases\nthe strength of your security.\n\n156\n00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:19.050\nBecause now I have to have something\nI have, and something I know, so\n\n157\n00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:23.690\ntwo factor multi-factor authentication\ncould always help to strengthen\n\n158\n00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:26.530\nthe security a BitLocker but we're gonna\ngo ahead we're gonna use a password.\n\n159\n00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.440\nAnd I'm gonna use the password\nto Mike's luggage\n\n160\n00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.880\nthat isn't in that super secret document,\nand we're gonna choose next.\n\n161\n00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.940\nAll right now, Here's something that we're\ngoing to talk about in a little bit and\n\n162\n00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.580\nI do want you to be aware of it,\nrecovery key.\n\n163\n00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:45.950\nJust like in the encrypted\nfilesystem EFS when I told you,\n\n164\n00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.900\nit is important to back up your\nencryption key because if you lose it,\n\n165\n00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.760\nyou lose access to the file,\nthis is even worse.\n\n166\n00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.260\nI mean,\nI guess it depends what's in that file.\n\n167\n00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.770\nHonestly, this is even worse.\n\n168\n00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:58.800\nIf I lose this key, I lose access\nto the drive if it ever gets thrown\n\n169\n00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.800\ninto a recovery mode, or\nBitLocker checks that TPM and says,\n\n170\n00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.310\nI've seen signs condition of tampering,\nand it throws it into recovery mode.\n\n171\n00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:09.060\nNow you can't gain access to your data and\n\n172\n00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:13.620\nyou need this key, if you lose access to\nthis key you've lost access to your drive.\n\n173\n00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:14.700\nYou can see a couple of options,\n\n174\n00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.800\nit's just relatively new to the Microsoft\nworld, it wasn't in Windows 7 because we\n\n175\n00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.270\nweren't using what they call\nback then live accounts.\n\n176\n00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.900\nToday you can back it up to the Cloud and\nyou can use your Microsoft account,\n\n177\n00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.780\nwhether you do that is up to you or\nnot, in a home environment\n\n178\n00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.150\nyou might not to have the option\ninside of the domain environment.\n\n179\n00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:33.260\nThis could be something that's controlled\nby your domain administrator and\n\n180\n00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.970\nthat gives them the auto- I\nbelieve that transparent to you.\n\n181\n00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:40.050\nYou can back that key straight\nup to the directory so\n\n182\n00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.810\nyou get that centralized management.\n\n183\n00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:43.060\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n184\n00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:47.320\nwhat we're gonna do for dcemonstration\npurposes is to save this to a file.\n\n185\n00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:56.292\nNow, I will tell you guys it is important,\ndo you not lose this file.\n\n186\n00:09:56.292 --> 00:10:01.050\nAll right, let's go ahead and save this\nto the desktop so we can gain access.\n\n187\n00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:03.730\nYeah, I wanna save it.\n\n188\n00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.510\nOkay, there we go.\n\n189\n00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:06.600\nAnd I don't want to cancel that.\n\n190\n00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:11.000\nAll right, so that's done, we've got our\nrecovery key and we'll talk a little bit\n\n191\n00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.576\nmore about that recovery key here\non a bit, and we'll choose next.\n\n192\n00:10:14.576 --> 00:10:19.400\nAll right, now there are,\n\n193\n00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:24.450\nnotice it says,\nwith Windows 10 1511 and then beyond,\n\n194\n00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.740\nright, introduces new\ndisk encryption mode.\n\n195\n00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.740\nRemember I told you when we did\nthe status it said XTS-AES,\n\n196\n00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:35.800\nthis provides additional integrity\nsupport, it isn't compatible with\n\n197\n00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.820\nolder versions of Windows it's\nsomething you have to consider.\n\n198\n00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:41.130\nIt's Windows 10, I'm not worried about it.\n\n199\n00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:45.560\nI know this is at least 1511, in fact this\nis 1607, it's the anniversary update.\n\n200\n00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.640\nBut that is something\nyou need to consider.\n\n201\n00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.274\nAll right, and we'll try,\nand you know what?\n\n202\n00:10:51.274 --> 00:10:54.315\nYeah, I'm going to leave it,\nI'm going to live dangerously here.\n\n203\n00:10:54.315 --> 00:10:58.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It is a fixed drive so\nit really shouldn't, if it was a removable\n\n204\n00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:02.140\ndrive and you might hand it to somebody\nthat's running and older operating system\n\n205\n00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:05.000\nthen you'd have to worry about that\ncompatibility, but being a fixed internal\n\n206\n00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.890\ndrive you're running Windows 10 at\nthe right level you should be good to go.\n\n207\n00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:13.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah absolutely yeah, great way to put\nit too, so encryption of D is complete.\n\n208\n00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:14.540\nWow, that went fast.\n\n209\n00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:15.260\nWhew, why?\n\n210\n00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.675\nBecause, well, it's a very small drive.\n\n211\n00:11:17.675 --> 00:11:20.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so now we have it encrypted.\n\n212\n00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.840\nHow can I tell?\n\n213\n00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:25.520\nHow can I tell other than we'll drop back\ndown to the command line here in a second?\n\n214\n00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.960\nBut if I open up File Explorer,\nyou're gonna notice something.\n\n215\n00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.330\nNotice I have these two locks.\n\n216\n00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.235\nNotice the lock right here that's\non the i console was changed.\n\n217\n00:11:35.235 --> 00:11:37.050\nIt let's me know that\nBitLocker is enabled,\n\n218\n00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:40.700\nalso it shows me that\nit's unlocked as well.\n\n219\n00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:46.920\nAll right, so now I know I have BitLocker\nready to go on this machine, okay?\n\n220\n00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:52.330\nNow, I also wanna show you guys that\nyou have the ability to do additional\n\n221\n00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:58.100\nmanipulation, I say that will work with\nBitLocker through that manage-bde command.\n\n222\n00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.760\nLets go ahead, and\nlet's kinda show you that as well.\n\n223\n00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.030\nAnd I know I keep saying\ncommand prompt guys,\n\n224\n00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:05.890\njust keep it in mind I'm\nkind of a stickler for\n\n225\n00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:10.050\nlaunching PowerShell just because again,\nI can work with both, all right.\n\n226\n00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:13.790\nSo I'm gonna do a manage-bde.\n\n227\n00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:17.120\nAgain you could auto tab, that's another\nthing I like about PowerShell it makes\n\n228\n00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.270\na lot easier to work with\nin the command prompt.\n\n229\n00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:22.080\nI'm gonna go ahead to show you that\nyou don't have to put the .exe, and\n\n230\n00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:28.640\nwe're gonna re-run that option that\nsays manage-bde you'll see status right.\n\n231\n00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.240\nSo we're gonna ahead and we'll run that.\n\n232\n00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:35.800\nNow, notice this it says size 10.00 gigs,\nnotice the BitLocker version, 2.0,\n\n233\n00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:43.828\nthere is that XTS-AES 128 bit encryption,\nnotice protection status it's on.\n\n234\n00:12:43.828 --> 00:12:47.770\nAll right, there's another thing called\nauto unlock and I didn't really mention\n\n235\n00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:51.510\nthat and I know Mike I don't really have\nthat in the notes here, automatic unlock\n\n236\n00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:55.740\nit says when I see this drive is in\nthis machine, unlock it automatically.\n\n237\n00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:59.130\nI don't have that turned on,\nI disabled that.\n\n238\n00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:02.340\nYou could also do that with Bitlocker to\ngo that says when I have this USB key and\n\n239\n00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.970\nI plug it into this machine, unlock it and\nI don't have to use a password.\n\n240\n00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:10.030\nSo there are options to make it a little\nbit easier with you or for you.\n\n241\n00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:12.150\nThere's also something that\nyou don't have to worry,\n\n242\n00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:16.060\nI don't think about an MTA exam but I do\nwanna make mention of it because as you\n\n243\n00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.980\nprogress through your Microsoft training,\nyou might come\n\n244\n00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:23.550\ninto contact with it that's also\nsomething called Network Unlock, right?\n\n245\n00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:28.300\nBitLocker has progressed so far that even\nthe machines can connect to, I believe\n\n246\n00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:32.790\nit's a DHCP server, a server out on your\nnetwork and it could say, I know I'm on\n\n247\n00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:36.620\nthis network, so now that I'm attached\nto this network all unlocked as well.\n\n248\n00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:39.050\nSo there are other options\nto more advanced features,\n\n249\n00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:42.720\nI wouldn't worry about it for the exam,\nfor your own personal benefit and training\n\n250\n00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:48.060\nas you move to the Microsoft world, it\nmight be something you want to consider.\n\n251\n00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.020\nNow, I also wanna talk about\nkey protectors, all right?\n\n252\n00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:54.890\nKey protectors is the method that we use,\nand this is gonna sound bad or\n\n253\n00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:57.755\nsound obvious, to protect the keys.\n\n254\n00:13:57.755 --> 00:14:00.510\n[LAUGH] So how are we protecting the keys?\n\n255\n00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:04.940\nNotice that up here it tells you,\npassword, numerical password, right?\n\n256\n00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:09.410\nIt tells me what's protecting\nthis drive versus the TPM here.\n\n257\n00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:12.139\nI can see the key protector,\nwhich means, where are the keys?\n\n258\n00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:15.130\nThey're in that hardware\nmodule that I was telling you.\n\n259\n00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:17.980\nSo you could see what is\ndoing the protection.\n\n260\n00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:24.580\nThis protection I have to tell you isn't\nas strong as the TPM protection, why?\n\n261\n00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:27.540\nWell maybe I didn't listen to\nMike's security training and\n\n262\n00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.410\nI wrote down my password to that drive.\n\n263\n00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.752\nStick it on a sticky note\nto the side of the monitor,\n\n264\n00:14:32.752 --> 00:14:35.600\nMike decides, you know what,\nsocial engineering I don't even have to.\n\n265\n00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.410\nI'll sit down to your machine and\n\n266\n00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:40.725\nI'll type in the password to your\nencrypted drive, and guess what?\n\n267\n00:14:40.725 --> 00:14:43.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's no longer encrypted.\n\n268\n00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.860\nSo keep in mind that the TPM and\na password is really good.\n\n269\n00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.160\nSo there are ways that you can strengthen\nthis by adding key protectors as well.\n\n270\n00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:55.140\nAll right, now notice too that\nthe encryption is paused, woo.\n\n271\n00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.910\nAll right, can we change that?\n\n272\n00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:02.260\nWell guess what,\nit's very easy, manage -bde and\n\n273\n00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:06.300\nwe'll do status, I wanna say it's start.\n\n274\n00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:10.349\nLet me just check my syntax, apparently\nit doesn't even like a question mark.\n\n275\n00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.800\nAnd resume, that's what is.\n\n276\n00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.825\nI had to make sure.\n\n277\n00:15:14.825 --> 00:15:18.430\n-resume, and then make sure\nto put the drive letter, too.\n\n278\n00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:22.420\nSo I'm gonna do resume,\nand you know what guys,\n\n279\n00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:26.260\nlet me make this a little bit easier for\nyou guys out there, let me try that.\n\n280\n00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:31.930\nSo we're gonna do manage-bde, I'll use\nthe lovely tab there that we have,\n\n281\n00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:37.330\nwe'll type resume and\nwe will do our drive letters.\n\n282\n00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:40.633\nSo hopefully everybody,\nI know sometimes the texts can get\n\n283\n00:15:40.633 --> 00:15:44.265\na little bit small out there but\nhopefully you can see that okay and\n\n284\n00:15:44.265 --> 00:15:47.719\nwe'll run that [SOUND] okay,\nI always see, when I see output.\n\n285\n00:15:47.719 --> 00:15:49.696\nIn PowerShell when you\nsee output its great,\n\n286\n00:15:49.696 --> 00:15:52.254\nwhen you see output it's like\nyou did something wrong.\n\n287\n00:15:52.254 --> 00:15:53.998\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, apparently I'm somewhere in\n\n288\n00:15:53.998 --> 00:15:54.659\nbetween here.\n\n289\n00:15:54.659 --> 00:15:58.315\n[LAUGH] All right so,\nI can see that the BitLocker says,\n\n290\n00:15:58.315 --> 00:16:01.654\nwell it says the encryption\nis in progress, and,\n\n291\n00:16:01.654 --> 00:16:05.803\nyou used to be able to see Yeah,\nthere it is, okay, perfect.\n\n292\n00:16:05.803 --> 00:16:09.881\nSo I click on that little BitLocker\nDrive Encryption it shows me, and\n\n293\n00:16:09.881 --> 00:16:12.660\nI can see that this is taking a while,\nright?\n\n294\n00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.970\nAnd we're not talking, Mike,\nhere, too much difference.\n\n295\n00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:17.690\nNow, I guess relatively, it's 10 Gigs or\n\n296\n00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:22.390\n20 Gigs versus 250 Gigs, and\nwe're not even talking about terabytes.\n\n297\n00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:23.310\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n298\n00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:24.300\nYeah, it can take a little while.\n\n299\n00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.848\nYou definitely don't wanna start this\nat the beginning of your work day.\n\n300\n00:16:26.848 --> 00:16:29.410\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you do,\n\n301\n00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:32.880\njust make sure that you've got plenty\nof time to do other stuff like,\n\n302\n00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.790\nI don't know,\nplay Angry Birds or solitaire.\n\n303\n00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:38.250\n&gt;&gt; And I guess, technically, you can still\nuse the machine while it's encrypting.\n\n304\n00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:41.420\nBut obviously,\neverything is gonna run a little slower.\n\n305\n00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:43.880\nPlus, it's gonna take much\nlonger to finish the encryption.\n\n306\n00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:47.085\n&gt;&gt; Sure too, and there's another thing.\n\n307\n00:16:47.085 --> 00:16:50.655\nAnd just one more thing, I was sitting\nthere and it kind of dawned on me\n\n308\n00:16:50.655 --> 00:16:54.535\nthat I didn't explain one setting that\nmight be something you need to know for\n\n309\n00:16:54.535 --> 00:16:56.535\nthe exam as well.\n\n310\n00:16:56.535 --> 00:16:58.597\nThis is a newer feature on the BitLocker.\n\n311\n00:16:58.597 --> 00:17:02.230\nMike, honestly,\nI don't know when this came into play.\n\n312\n00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:03.110\nYou might be able to help me out.\n\n313\n00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:06.003\nI want to say it was probably\nWindows 8 some time.\n\n314\n00:17:06.003 --> 00:17:09.243\nI know it was definitely\nsupported in the server.\n\n315\n00:17:09.243 --> 00:17:13.110\nAnd you'll see here, Mike's like,\nwhat are you talking about man?\n\n316\n00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:17.090\nAll right, is this used space only.\n\n317\n00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:18.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n318\n00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:21.895\nyou have the option that you can leave,\nwhat do they call it, slack space?\n\n319\n00:17:21.895 --> 00:17:23.800\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; You can leave the slack space\n\n320\n00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:28.400\nunencrypted, cuz it doesn't\ncontain any data, or does it?\n\n321\n00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:33.300\nAll right, so unused portions of the drive\nremain unencrypted because they say, well,\n\n322\n00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.730\nwe're only gonna encrypt your data.\n\n323\n00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.980\nIs that relevent to your company?\n\n324\n00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:38.950\nI don't know.\n\n325\n00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:44.090\nAre you using drive disposal techniques\nwhere you're securely erasing the drives?\n\n326\n00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:45.460\nIt might be something\nyou want to consider.\n\n327\n00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:48.990\nYou might wanna do full disk encryption\nincluding the slack space, especially if\n\n328\n00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:51.840\nyou have some kind of, I don't know,\nhip of compliance for whatever reason.\n\n329\n00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.970\nSo please do keep that in mind.\n\n330\n00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:57.390\nIf you do have an internal security\npolicy, that might not be an option,\n\n331\n00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:59.710\nleaving that slack space un-encrypted.\n\n332\n00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:02.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, typically what they'll tell\nyou is, if it's a brand new drive,\n\n333\n00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.630\nthere's never been data on there,\nyou can use that option.\n\n334\n00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:07.410\nAnd it's secure because there's\nno data in that other spot.\n\n335\n00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:09.990\nBut if it's a used drive,\nyou guys know how it works.\n\n336\n00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:12.930\nWhen you partition a drive or\nyou delete files, they're still there.\n\n337\n00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:14.270\nThere's just no pointer to them, so\n\n338\n00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:16.960\nthe operating system can't find them or\nget to them.\n\n339\n00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.040\nBut the bits, the ones and zeros that\nmade up those files, are still there.\n\n340\n00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.650\nSo if you do just the use space,\n\n341\n00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:25.420\nthat other space is empty\naccording to the operating system.\n\n342\n00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:28.770\nBut if I use a data recovery software,\nI might be able to go in and\n\n343\n00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:29.540\ngrab those files.\n\n344\n00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.940\nSo usually if you've got a drive\nthat's being repurposed,\n\n345\n00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:35.640\nyou wanna just take the extra time and\nencrypt the entire drive.\n\n346\n00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.970\n&gt;&gt; Man, that's what's great about having\na host with you that knows how to\n\n347\n00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.370\ndo environmental reconnaissance.\n\n348\n00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:41.870\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n349\n00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:43.470\n&gt;&gt; Not that he's ever done that's before.\n\n350\n00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:44.150\n&gt;&gt; No, no. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; But that's\n\n351\n00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:47.020\nabsolutely right, so depends on\nwhat your internal policy might be.\n\n352\n00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.290\nYour policy might say that you have to\n\n353\n00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:50.670\nencrypt your entire drive.\nSo, now we see that.\n\n354\n00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:54.080\nWe've seen the encryption take place.\n\n355\n00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.030\nI'm gonna go ahead,\nI'm gonna jump over to another machine.\n\n356\n00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:57.650\nWe're jumping all over the place here,\nMike.\n\n357\n00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:00.375\nLet me make sure that I'm\njumping in the right direction.\n\n358\n00:19:00.375 --> 00:19:02.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz now what I wanna do is,\n\n359\n00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:04.010\nlet's go through that process again,\nall right?\n\n360\n00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:08.330\nWe're gonna go ahead and on this machine,\nwe're going to try it on BitLocker.\n\n361\n00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:09.270\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n362\n00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.450\nSo we'll show you a couple, again,\nwe'll show you the easy, easy\n\n363\n00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:17.260\nroute that I showed you earlier, where\nI just find the drive in file explorer.\n\n364\n00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:18.620\nIn this case, it's local disk C.\n\n365\n00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.110\nAnd I right-click on it, right?\n\n366\n00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:22.770\nAnd I choose Turn on BitLocker.\n\n367\n00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:28.370\nSo let's go ahead and let's, wait,\nturn on BitLocker, what happened?\n\n368\n00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:29.500\nI can't turn on BitLocker.\n\n369\n00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.600\nAnd here's something I want you\nto remember for the exam and\n\n370\n00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.910\nif you are going to implement it.\n\n371\n00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:37.630\nBitLocker, by default,\nis looking for a TPM.\n\n372\n00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:39.660\nThat's what it was designed to use, okay?\n\n373\n00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:44.500\nHowever, does that mean that if you don't\nhave a TPM you can't use BitLocker.\n\n374\n00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:45.570\nNo.\n\n375\n00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:48.110\nNo, it doesn't mean that at all.\n\n376\n00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:54.880\nIt means that you can use a password,\nor a pen, or a smart card for BitLocker.\n\n377\n00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.160\nBut here's where you start\nto get the complaints.\n\n378\n00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:00.740\nYou implement BitLocker in\na manner in which it was never\n\n379\n00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:01.920\nmeant to be implemented.\n\n380\n00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:05.810\nThey give you the option but it's not\nthe way they wanted you to use it, and\n\n381\n00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:07.910\nthen you complain because\nit is not secure enough.\n\n382\n00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:13.270\nSo please understand that they give you\nthe ability to encrypt your drive but\n\n383\n00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:15.560\nthe security strength is greatly reduced.\n\n384\n00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:18.880\nSo, I just want you to know that,\nsounds like a little disclaimer, and\n\n385\n00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.450\nit kinda is, but even for\nyour own personal endeavors here.\n\n386\n00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:24.170\nSo how do we get around this.\n\n387\n00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:27.670\nIf I can't turn it on\nbecause the virtual machine,\n\n388\n00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:30.470\nI can't visualize a TPM,\nso how do I do it?\n\n389\n00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:33.660\nWell, this is where we go\nback to our group policy.\n\n390\n00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.300\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe'll jump back to group policy, and\n\n391\n00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.380\nI want you to know this for the exam.\n\n392\n00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:39.920\nAgain, it's just one of those things.\n\n393\n00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:43.620\nI'm not sure what will come up\njust relative to the objectives,\n\n394\n00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:47.390\nmaking sure that we're putting enough and\neven maybe some more stuff in there so\n\n395\n00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:48.900\nthat you will be covered.\n\n396\n00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:50.960\nNow, follow along with\nme on this one guys, and\n\n397\n00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.800\nI want you to remember\nwhere we're going here.\n\n398\n00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:57.830\nWe've been here a couple of times now,\nand again, it might be important.\n\n399\n00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:01.170\nSo we're gonna go under the computer\nsettings in your group policy.\n\n400\n00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:03.660\nWe're gonna expand out\nAdministrative Templates,\n\n401\n00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.669\nwe're gonna scroll down\nto Windows Components.\n\n402\n00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:08.350\nAnd I don't know why I'm scrolling.\n\n403\n00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:09.081\nIt's right here at the top.\n\n404\n00:21:09.081 --> 00:21:13.805\n[LAUGH] We're gonna have to go to\nBitLocker Drive Encryption, all right?\n\n405\n00:21:13.805 --> 00:21:17.140\nNow notice these are the same\nsettings that we've seen before.\n\n406\n00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:19.950\nBut now what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna go to Operating System Drives.\n\n407\n00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.150\nAnd right here, and\n\n408\n00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:26.890\nin fact, that's a network unlock\nI was telling you at startup.\n\n409\n00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:29.230\nBut here is what we need to look at.\n\n410\n00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:32.740\nNotice this require additional\nauthentication at startup.\n\n411\n00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:36.260\nAnd when I turn this on, well, I'm not\nreally turning anything on at this point,\n\n412\n00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:39.060\nI'm just kind of inspecting it.\n\n413\n00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:43.750\nBy default, it's not configure, and again,\nthis really isn't a show on group policy,\n\n414\n00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:47.950\nespecially with this guy standing\nnext to me, I better be on the money.\n\n415\n00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:50.490\nIs that you have to be careful\ncuz in not configuring something,\n\n416\n00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:53.880\nit might be disabled, and in disabling it,\nyou might enable a functionality.\n\n417\n00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.420\nSo be very careful to\nread the explanations.\n\n418\n00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:57.900\nLet me help you out on this one.\n\n419\n00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.640\nWhen I choose Enable,\n\n420\n00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.890\nnotice that, remember we talked\nabout the key protectors?\n\n421\n00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:05.270\nTPM is one of them,\n\n422\n00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:09.830\nwe seen a password, PIN numeric, it can\nalso be a numeric password too, as well.\n\n423\n00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:12.970\nNotice that it gives us\na lot of other options, but\n\n424\n00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:15.270\nnotice it says start with a PIN and a TPM.\n\n425\n00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:20.950\nAllow a start up key and PIN with the TPM.\n\n426\n00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:23.170\nSo this gives us a lot of other options.\n\n427\n00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:26.830\nAgain, I want you understand,\nBitLocker was made,\n\n428\n00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:30.155\nand we'll go ahead and apply that\nsettings, was made to use a TPM.\n\n429\n00:22:30.155 --> 00:22:33.715\nI'm reducing the strength of\nthe security platform by using\n\n430\n00:22:33.715 --> 00:22:35.595\nwhat's called non-TPM mode.\n\n431\n00:22:35.595 --> 00:22:37.705\nWell, let's see if that did anything.\n\n432\n00:22:37.705 --> 00:22:41.680\nNow, again, I might wanna go ahead and\n\n433\n00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:46.165\nit should have applied automatically,\nbut I'm just so used to doing this.\n\n434\n00:22:46.165 --> 00:22:49.140\nI'm gonna do a gpupdate / fross?\n\n435\n00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.480\nI don't know what fross is, but\nwe will do a force and we'll go ahead and\n\n436\n00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.940\nupdate that policy.\n\n437\n00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:58.940\nLocal policy should be implemented\nthe moment you apply to the system,\n\n438\n00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:00.710\nthe moment you implement them.\n\n439\n00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:05.520\nBut i'm just so used to doing a GP update,\nforcing those settings to apply.\n\n440\n00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:09.119\nSo now, let's go ahead and\nlet's go back and\n\n441\n00:23:09.119 --> 00:23:14.150\nlet's see if we can enable\nBitLocker drive encryption.\n\n442\n00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:18.147\nAll right guys, nothing up my sleeves\nhere, no mirrors, I don't think,\n\n443\n00:23:18.147 --> 00:23:22.095\nin the background here and let's go\nahead and we will right click on that.\n\n444\n00:23:22.095 --> 00:23:25.680\nAnd we'll scroll back up\nhere to turn BitLocker on.\n\n445\n00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:29.101\nThe first thing I notice is that\nit got farther than the last time.\n\n446\n00:23:29.101 --> 00:23:32.888\nI didn't get the red x that's, stop,\ndo not pass go, do not collect $200'.\n\n447\n00:23:32.888 --> 00:23:38.940\n[LAUGH] So, now look what it's telling me,\nit's saying you can use a flash drive.\n\n448\n00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:42.650\nThat's actually a really cool technique\ncuz it's kinda like a smart card.\n\n449\n00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:44.505\nIn a way,\nit's not quite as secure as a smart card,\n\n450\n00:23:44.505 --> 00:23:46.270\ncuz that's certificate\nbased authentication.\n\n451\n00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:47.780\nBut now it gives me something I have.\n\n452\n00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:54.160\nAnd I can plug the thumb drive into the\ncomputer and it unlocks the drive for me.\n\n453\n00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:57.521\nI'm not that fancy so\nI'm gonna use a password here.\n\n454\n00:23:57.521 --> 00:24:01.526\nAnd again, remember, this password\nshould not be shared with anybody,\n\n455\n00:24:01.526 --> 00:24:05.928\nand it certainly shouldn't be one of\nMicrosoft's old super secret passwords.\n\n456\n00:24:05.928 --> 00:24:09.653\nIn fact, it's kinda interesting,\nthey also tell you Tips for\n\n457\n00:24:09.653 --> 00:24:11.421\ncreating a strong password.\n\n458\n00:24:11.421 --> 00:24:12.610\nAnd if you need a tip on that,\n\n459\n00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:15.212\nwe also have episodes that will\nhelp you out with that as well.\n\n460\n00:24:15.212 --> 00:24:18.120\n[LAUGH] All right,\nwe'll choose next on this.\n\n461\n00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:22.010\nAnd apparently, I don't know how to\ntype the password correctly twice.\n\n462\n00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:26.090\nI guess it was too difficult typing one,\ntwo, three, four, five, six.\n\n463\n00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:27.010\nThere we go!\n\n464\n00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:29.080\nAll right, and so it must be four right?\n\n465\n00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.950\n&gt;&gt; Now Wess I know a lot of times\nlike when I'm backing up my drive,\n\n466\n00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:36.320\nit warns me not to save the back on the\ndrive that I'm backing up is it a similar\n\n467\n00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:40.010\nconcept with the key I'm using to\nencrypt a drive I don't wanna put it\n\n468\n00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:41.630\non the drive Drive that I'm encrypting.\n\n469\n00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:44.240\n&gt;&gt; Well, Mike, I don't know.\n\n470\n00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.160\nWhat do you say we go find out?\n\n471\n00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.110\nJust kidding, guys.\n\n472\n00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:48.210\nIf we look at my computer here,\n\n473\n00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:50.850\nlike I said before,\nyou've seen this screen all right.\n\n474\n00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:53.720\nI'm going to go ahead and\ntry to save this to a file and\n\n475\n00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.341\nI'm going to save it to the desktop.\n\n476\n00:24:55.341 --> 00:24:57.980\nINTEL warns me it says\n\n477\n00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:01.090\nyou can't save the recovery key to\nthe same drive you are encrypting.\n\n478\n00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:04.700\nSo, let's go ahead and\nwe will choose a different drive.\n\n479\n00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:07.650\nWe have got a folder up here and\nI casually named it Keys,\n\n480\n00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:08.598\nbecause that it is.\n\n481\n00:25:08.598 --> 00:25:10.874\nCan't tell what, what's inside of that\nfor, and we'll go ahead and save it.\n\n482\n00:25:10.874 --> 00:25:13.834\nAll right, and it always warns you,\n\n483\n00:25:13.834 --> 00:25:17.854\nit says do you want to save\nthe recovery on this PC?\n\n484\n00:25:17.854 --> 00:25:20.855\nIt's a good idea to have\nit more than one place.\n\n485\n00:25:20.855 --> 00:25:23.020\nThe first thing I wanna do\nis if you're gonna copy it.\n\n486\n00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:24.910\nCopy it again and\nmaybe put it on a thumb drive.\n\n487\n00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:25.870\nMake sure you have backups.\n\n488\n00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:27.150\nRemember, we told you.\n\n489\n00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:31.150\nYou lose access to this key and\nyou lose access to your files.\n\n490\n00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:32.490\n&gt;&gt; And it's kind of like a password.\n\n491\n00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:35.940\nIf anybody gets a hold of that recovery\nkey, they can decrypt the drive.\n\n492\n00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:39.530\nSo I can steal the drive,\nsteal the recovery key.\n\n493\n00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:41.660\nAnd now I can get into\nthat data just the same.\n\n494\n00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:42.992\nSo, you might want to make sure that,\n\n495\n00:25:42.992 --> 00:25:46.110\nthat's the key is stored somewhere\nelse and in a secure location.\n\n496\n00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:47.180\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n497\n00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.110\nNow, so the next thing we've got here.\n\n498\n00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:50.890\nRemember earlier I told you,\n\n499\n00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:54.650\nI didn't include include\nthe slack space in the encryption.\n\n500\n00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:56.000\nHere's the option too.\n\n501\n00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.860\nNotice it says, it's faster and\nbest for new PC's and drives for\n\n502\n00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:02.810\nthe entire drive slower but\nif the drives were already been in used.\n\n503\n00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:04.270\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwill change this option.\n\n504\n00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:08.920\nAnd you'll see, when I choose Next,\nand here is the new encryption mode.\n\n505\n00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:12.550\nWe're gonna change it to compatibility\njust to choose a different option to\n\n506\n00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:13.400\nshow you that.\n\n507\n00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:16.880\nAnd it's gonna run the system check,\nremember when a non TPM mode so\n\n508\n00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:20.060\nwe can't check the TPM\nit's not even existing, so\n\n509\n00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.760\nit's gonna do some other checks and\nbalances.\n\n510\n00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:25.150\nIt's gonna run integrity checks if you\nwill to make sure that when I write\n\n511\n00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:28.290\nthese encryption keys,\ncan I read them as well?\n\n512\n00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:30.160\nSee, I don't have to worry\nabout that with the TPM.\n\n513\n00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:34.290\nWe're storing them in the TPM and the TPM\nretrieves them for us when we need it.\n\n514\n00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:38.280\nNow it's the operating system doing it so\nwe'll go ahead and choose continue, and\n\n515\n00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.619\nman does it look like it\ndid absolutely nothing.\n\n516\n00:26:40.619 --> 00:26:43.954\nNow I know my head's covering\nit up right here, but\n\n517\n00:26:43.954 --> 00:26:49.640\nyou can see that it tells you Encryption\nwill begin after the computers restart.\n\n518\n00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:52.104\nNow before we restart this computer here,\nin fact,\n\n519\n00:26:52.104 --> 00:26:55.576\nwe really don't have to restart it\nbecause all you're going to see is that\n\n520\n00:26:55.576 --> 00:26:58.670\nyou're entering a password to\nget back into this machine.\n\n521\n00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:02.280\nThe next thing I want to look at is I want\nto look at that recovery key real quick,\n\n522\n00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.470\nbecause we just want to\nmention what that's about so\n\n523\n00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:06.920\nyou would be being familiar with it.\n\n524\n00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.920\nThis recovery key is nothing nice,\n[LAUGH] to try and\n\n525\n00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.700\nremember that's why you wanna copy\npotentially more than one of it.\n\n526\n00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:18.080\nKeep in mind this is\na 48 digit recovery key.\n\n527\n00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:21.550\nIt should be backed up,\nit is specific to the drive.\n\n528\n00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:25.390\nIts typically you could back it up into\nthe Active directory if you have a larger\n\n529\n00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:29.130\ninfrastructure you can use the Microsoft\nBitLocker and administration and\n\n530\n00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:30.530\nmonitoring emblem as they call it.\n\n531\n00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:35.170\nThis is really up to you print it\nput on USB drive save it on a file.\n\n532\n00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:39.670\nKeep in mind, that if you go into recovery\nmode and you don't have access to this\n\n533\n00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:43.830\nfile your Bitlocker password won't\nwork you need the recovery password.\n\n534\n00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:47.460\nSo we'll go ahead, and\nI tell you what, let's go ahead.\n\n535\n00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:48.720\nI'll make sure this is\nthe virtual machine,\n\n536\n00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:51.150\nI'm not disconnecting myself\nfrom the RDP session.\n\n537\n00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:55.120\nWe'll go ahead and\nwe'll restart this machine.\n\n538\n00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:57.640\nAll right, and\nwe'll just go ahead and restart it.\n\n539\n00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:01.624\nWe won't log the virtual User\nthat was still logged in it.\n\n540\n00:28:01.624 --> 00:28:06.686\n[LAUGH] And then as it restarts,\nhopefully what we're gonna see\n\n541\n00:28:06.686 --> 00:28:12.047\nis what you need to do once your\nmachine has had BitLocker enabled.\n\n542\n00:28:12.047 --> 00:28:13.484\nNow if I've got a TPM,\n\n543\n00:28:13.484 --> 00:28:17.892\nI won't have to put in the password\nbecause it's checked in the TPM.\n\n544\n00:28:17.892 --> 00:28:21.327\nIt pulls the keys right out of the TPM but\nnotice.\n\n545\n00:28:21.327 --> 00:28:21.965\nWhat it's doing here?\n\n546\n00:28:21.965 --> 00:28:26.840\nIt's asking me for the BitLocker password\nthat we just set to unlock the drive.\n\n547\n00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:30.070\nNow I also want you to see, and\nI know it's kinda hard to see down here.\n\n548\n00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:32.930\nIn fact,\nI don't even know if I can show you that.\n\n549\n00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:34.455\nRight down here at the bottom.\n\n550\n00:28:34.455 --> 00:28:37.185\nYou'll see this escape for\nBitlocker recovery.\n\n551\n00:28:37.185 --> 00:28:39.242\nI can actually force it\nto go into recovery mode.\n\n552\n00:28:39.242 --> 00:28:41.345\nIt's a little bit different.\n\n553\n00:28:41.345 --> 00:28:45.381\nYou'll see, when it enters recovery mode,\nnow it's gonna give me the ability\n\n554\n00:28:45.381 --> 00:28:48.595\nto put in that 48 digit\nrecovery key if I choose to.\n\n555\n00:28:48.595 --> 00:28:51.775\nHowever, remember, if I don't have access,\nin fact, did it do it?\n\n556\n00:28:51.775 --> 00:28:52.725\nLet me see here.\n\n557\n00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:56.770\nEnter recovery mode, it looks like\nit just unlocked the drive here.\n\n558\n00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:58.925\nAnd you know what it is,\nit's not fully encrypted.\n\n559\n00:28:58.925 --> 00:29:01.028\nYeah, so that's what it is.\n\n560\n00:29:01.028 --> 00:29:05.020\nSo it has to finish the encryption before\nyou to be able to use the recovery.\n\n561\n00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:07.698\nNotice it says [SOUND],\nconfirm that you have, okay.\n\n562\n00:29:07.698 --> 00:29:08.986\nSo the key, like Mike said,\n\n563\n00:29:08.986 --> 00:29:12.460\nthat warning's letting me know it\nhasn't finished the encryption part.\n\n564\n00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:13.940\nYou gotta fully encrypt it for\n\n565\n00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:17.100\nBitLocker to actually be active\nto even enter the recovery mode.\n\n566\n00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:20.800\nAll right, so do keep that in\nmind that the recovery mode,\n\n567\n00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:26.822\n48 digit key gets you into the drive,\nyour BitLocker password doesn't work.\n\n568\n00:29:26.822 --> 00:29:31.488\nAll right, also remember that BitLocker is\nsupported in TPM mode and non TPM mode.\n\n569\n00:29:31.488 --> 00:29:36.497\nHowever if you want the most security\nout of the BitLocker technologies.\n\n570\n00:29:36.497 --> 00:29:40.381\nYou want to implement the hardware\nlayer protection there, that TPM,\n\n571\n00:29:40.381 --> 00:29:42.396\nin order to get the full protection.\n\n572\n00:29:42.396 --> 00:29:46.494\nAnd make sure that your drive stays safe,\nat least the data that's on them, and\n\n573\n00:29:46.494 --> 00:29:49.797\nthat they don't end up in the hands\nof somebody else that might do\n\n574\n00:29:49.797 --> 00:29:52.075\na physical hardware attack.\n\n575\n00:29:52.075 --> 00:29:53.980\nBitLocker is definitely the way to go.\n\n576\n00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:54.660\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes.\n\n577\n00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:55.720\nFantastic stuff.\n\n578\n00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:59.036\nThere really good look at a couple\ndifferent encryption methods we\n\n579\n00:29:59.036 --> 00:30:01.342\ncan use within windows,\nwe took a look at EFS,\n\n580\n00:30:01.342 --> 00:30:03.887\nour encrypting file system\nwhich is a part of NTFS,\n\n581\n00:30:03.887 --> 00:30:07.793\na common file system used within Windows,\nas well as taking a look at Bitlocker\n\n582\n00:30:07.793 --> 00:30:12.000\nwhich is full volume encryption we can\nimplement in our Windows operating system.\n\n583\n00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.750\nSo we thank you for that,\nWes Great demonstrations there.\n\n584\n00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:17.000\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n585\n00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.100\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n586\n00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:21.040\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n587\n00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:21.852\n&gt;&gt; And we'll

evening.\n\n4\n00:00:35,955 --> 00:00:39,771\nAnd welcome back to another episode\nof ITProTV, I'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:39,771 --> 00:00:41,380\nBack in with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,230\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,200\n>> It is going well.\n\n8\n00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,798\nI did not actually go out and\nsee the opening of Mockingbird?\n\n9\n00:00:46,798 --> 00:00:47,501\nMockingjay?\n\n10\n00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:48,204\nMockingjay.\n\n11\n00:00:48,204 --> 00:00:50,110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> See, I don't even know the name of it.\n\n12\n00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,060\nI would've.\n\n13\n00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:51,590\nThat's my fault.\n\n14\n00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:55,350\n>> How could you even possibly miss out\non the greatest movie launch of all time?\n\n15\n00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,210\n>> According to my 13-year-old daughter,\nit's the best movie ever.\n\n16\n00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,490\n>> There you go.\n\n17\n00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,690\nAll right, well,\nwe're jumping right back into the world of\n\n18\n00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,780\nthe Microsoft Technical\nAssociate Certification,\n\n19\n00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,570\nthe MTA, the 98-349,\nOperating system fundamentals exam.\n\n20\n00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:15,590\nAnd we're kind of getting towards\nthe end of the objectives now and\n\n21\n00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:20,070\nthe one we're going to be tackling\nin this episode is managing devices.\n\n22\n00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,090\nNow when we say managing devices,\nthat is really broad.\n\n23\n00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,952\nThere are all sorts of devices\nwe can use on the system and\n\n24\n00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,690\nwe've kind of already\ntalked about some of them.\n\n25\n00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,070\nSo there's going to be a little\nbit of overlap between this and\n\n26\n00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:35,100\nsome of the earlier episodes but\nthe idea is that when you have a computer,\n\n27\n00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,130\nbe it a laptop or a desktop,\n\n28\n00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:42,370\nit oftentimes won't have all the hardware\nyou need and we have to add to it.\n\n29\n00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:47,560\nWe attach things to the system and\nwhen Microsoft talks about devices,\n\n30\n00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,590\nthey are typically talking\nabout external devices,\n\n31\n00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,560\nthings that are outside of the case.\n\n32\n00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,450\nIf you have a laptop, there's not much\nroom for you to add anything else into it,\n\n33\n00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,060\nso everything is going to be outside and\nthere is\n\n34\n00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,000\ndifferent devices that meet certain needs\nand Windows handles them differently.\n\n35\n00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,610\nSo we're gonna take a look at that here\nin this episode as we move through\n\n36\n00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:08,640\neach of the various ones that are there\nand see what our capabilities are.\n\n37\n00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,860\n>> Speaking of external devices, one of\nthe very first external devices that I\n\n38\n00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,665\nremember ever buying was a printer and\njust being able to get that device\n\n39\n00:02:16,665 --> 00:02:20,225\nconnected to my printer was\nmore of a challenge then I\n\n40\n00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:22,575\never thought it could be at the beginning\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n41\n00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,215\n>> Because I didn't really know what I was\n\n42\n00:02:24,215 --> 00:02:27,250\nlooking for, I had bought a printer but\nit didn't come with a printer cable.\n\n43\n00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,437\nI had to actually go and buy a printer\ncable and then I went to the store and\n\n44\n00:02:30,437 --> 00:02:33,277\nthey're like,\nwhat type of printer cable do you need?\n\n45\n00:02:33,277 --> 00:02:35,377\nIt was incredibly\nchallenging to actually go,\n\n46\n00:02:35,377 --> 00:02:38,147\nI just need one that\nwill allow me to print.\n\n47\n00:02:38,147 --> 00:02:41,623\nWell, are you doing bidirectional or\nsingle direction?\n\n48\n00:02:41,623 --> 00:02:46,173\n>> I was really confused at some point\nin time but the good thing is, today,\n\n49\n00:02:46,173 --> 00:02:51,513\na lot of the devices that we connect to,\nwe don't need a lot of different\n\n50\n00:02:51,513 --> 00:02:55,480\ntypes of cables anymore because they do\nsomething that we call Plug and Play.\n\n51\n00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,920\n>> Yeah, there's a few different\ntechnologies we have in place to make life\n\n52\n00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,670\nso much easier today.\n\n53\n00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,980\nPlug and Play is basically a service or\n\n54\n00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,140\nsystem that runs in\nthe background of Windows and\n\n55\n00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:11,400\nwhen you plug a device in, Windows will\nrecognize that device is attached.\n\n56\n00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,820\nIt will see this new hardware, and\nonce it see it, if it has a driver for\n\n57\n00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:20,310\nit, then it'll fire it up and\nthe device is ready to go.\n\n58\n00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,400\nYou plug it in and you're ready to play.\n\n59\n00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,850\nPlug and play, right?\n\n60\n00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,940\nBut it is designed around\nthe idea of having the driver.\n\n61\n00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,660\nDoes Windows have the driver built in?\n\n62\n00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:35,210\nWell, Windows actually has a lot of\ndrivers that are built into its system.\n\n63\n00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:39,740\nSo when you add hardware, a good chunk of\nthe time, it's going to be detected and\n\n64\n00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:44,530\nready to rock but Microsoft doesn't\nhave every driver loaded and\n\n65\n00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,600\nnew hardware comes out all the time.\n\n66\n00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,050\nSo if you buy a new device,\nwhen you go to plug it in your computer,\n\n67\n00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,040\nWindows will detect it, and\nthen it'll say, well, I need a driver.\n\n68\n00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,090\nAnd if you're not familiar\nwith what a driver is,\n\n69\n00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:01,490\nit's just a little program that allows\nWindows to talk to this hardware.\n\n70\n00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,390\nDifferent hardware has different needs,\nright?\n\n71\n00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:08,070\nLike, there's different types of printers,\nor scanners, fax machines, whatever, and\n\n72\n00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:12,388\nso Windows has to know how to talk to that\ndevice and that's what the driver does.\n\n73\n00:04:12,388 --> 00:04:13,680\nIf Windows already has the driver,\n\n74\n00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,760\nthat means it all ready\nknows how to talk to it.\n\n75\n00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,970\nIf it doesn't, your manufacturer,\n\n76\n00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,840\nwhoever made your device,\nwill provide the drivers.\n\n77\n00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,890\nThose drivers might be on a CD or\nyou can go to the vendors website and\n\n78\n00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,860\ndownload them, there's different\nways that you might get that driver.\n\n79\n00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,280\n>> Yeah, speaking of drivers, Don, I\nremember going back to that first printer\n\n80\n00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,870\nI was talking about too and thinking\nthat I had the correct driver, and\n\n81\n00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,360\nthen realizing I had some other driver.\n\n82\n00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,852\nIn that day,\nwhen you installed the wrong driver,\n\n83\n00:04:40,852 --> 00:04:44,230\nit would end up printing just a single\nline of text or something like that,\n\n84\n00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,310\neven though you actually had four or\nfive pages to print.\n\n85\n00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,740\nIt'd kind of give you\nsome weird print errors.\n\n86\n00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,800\nA lot of times today with the Plug and\nPlay, trying to even install the wrong\n\n87\n00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,750\ndriver, the operating system kind of tells\nyou, you're trying to install a driver but\n\n88\n00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,900\nI'm not finding the device\nyou're trying to install.\n\n89\n00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,406\nSo, most of the operating today is so\nhelpful,\n\n90\n00:05:02,406 --> 00:05:06,680\nthat you can't even get the wrong driver\ninstalled on there, even by accident.\n\n91\n00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,040\nThat was really helpful.\n\n92\n00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,150\n>> Yeah, it's really come a long way.\n\n93\n00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,450\nNow, the other problem you mentioned,\nRonnie, was that the cable, right?\n\n94\n00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:20,470\nAnd with these printers, especially,\nback in the day, you had so many choices.\n\n95\n00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,110\nNow we've got these nice generic cable\ntypes we can pick from that work on many,\n\n96\n00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,050\nmany different devices and\nwe'll see that even though we've got\n\n97\n00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,590\nthese nice generic cables, there's\nactually more than one type of those too.\n\n98\n00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,680\nSo we'll need to take a look at those,\nand how they work, and\n\n99\n00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,650\nkind of get an idea there.\n\n100\n00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:40,030\nSo let's wander through some of\nthe different devices that are available.\n\n101\n00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:45,390\nNow I can think of a couple of devices\njust because I'm looking at my laptop here\n\n102\n00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:50,035\nand my laptop, there's some things\nit doesn't have that I wish it did.\n\n103\n00:05:50,035 --> 00:05:53,435\nAnd so when I'm up here on\nthe podium doing a show,\n\n104\n00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:56,755\nif my hard drive doesn't have those\ncomponents, I need to add them on.\n\n105\n00:05:56,755 --> 00:06:00,730\nYou guys can sort of see what's\non the podium around us.\n\n106\n00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,900\nWell, maybe you really can't.\n\n107\n00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,265\nI guess you guys see the back\nof our computers here.\n\n108\n00:06:04,265 --> 00:06:05,050\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n>> But,\n\n109\n00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,820\nI've got thinks like this guy right here,\nwhich is my track ball.\n\n110\n00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,330\nMost laptops today come with a touch pad.\n\n111\n00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,830\nRight, a little flat surface\nyou move your finger around and\n\n112\n00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,530\nit moves the pointer around on the screen\nand that's great for some people.\n\n113\n00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:21,180\nI get a little frustrated with touch pads\nsometimes, and I like my track ball.\n\n114\n00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,260\nSo even though I've got a built in\npointing device on my laptop, I still\n\n115\n00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:29,000\ncarry this thing around, and I plug it\ninto my computer, and I'm able to use it.\n\n116\n00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,660\nSo that's one external device that I use.\n\n117\n00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,400\nI've got an external hard drive over here.\n\n118\n00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,490\nThe hard drive in my laptop\nis Is a decent size but\n\n119\n00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,680\nit's not as big as I want it to be if\nI have a bunch of virtual machines and\n\n120\n00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,260\nother software,\nthere's just not enough room on my laptop.\n\n121\n00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,950\nSo I have an external hard\ndrive sitting here for\n\n122\n00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,680\nme to be able to store that other data.\n\n123\n00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,140\nThen my laptop has a wireless\nnetwork adapter in it, so\n\n124\n00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,950\nI can connect to wi-fi networks but\nwhen I'm doing a show, I want as much\n\n125\n00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:01,280\nreliable bandwidth as I can get and\nwi-fi is not the greatest for that.\n\n126\n00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,150\nSo I need a physical network cable where I\ncan plug an actual network cable into my\n\n127\n00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:09,240\ncomputer but my computer doesn't\nhave a physical network jack and so\n\n128\n00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,995\nI have a little external network\nadapter that I stick onto my laptop.\n\n129\n00:07:12,995 --> 00:07:14,300\nRonnie, you do the same thing.\n\n130\n00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,640\nSo we both have these network adapters.\n\n131\n00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,610\nYou can buy external devices like these\nto add all sorts of functionality and\n\n132\n00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,890\nif we wanna get an idea of that,\nlet's go shopping Ronnie.\n\n133\n00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:28,230\nI'm gonna just pull up,\nwe'll try Newegg's website.\n\n134\n00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:32,130\nLast time I tried to do Newegg on\nthis show, it was really slow.\n\n135\n00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:36,420\nSo let's see, we might have to go Amazon\nbut Newegg, if you've never heard of them,\n\n136\n00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,020\nthey are an online computer retailer.\n\n137\n00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,470\nThey sell electronics in general.\n\n138\n00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,820\nNow they sell a ton of stuff.\n\n139\n00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,420\nYou can't beat their selection.\n\n140\n00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,730\nThey've got a lot of stuff.\n\n141\n00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,130\nTheir pricing is usually decent.\n\n142\n00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,290\nShipping is ultra fast.\n\n143\n00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:52,090\nSo if you're in a hurry,\nI like to go to Newegg.\n\n144\n00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,380\nWe don't have any kind of\nrelationship with them, though.\n\n145\n00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,460\nWe don't get commissions or anything.\n\n146\n00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,090\nI don't care if you use NewEgg or not but\nBut basically, when you go to Newegg,\n\n147\n00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,960\nyou'll see where you can buy\nall sorts of computer hardware.\n\n148\n00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,491\nAnd a lot of it is internal stuff,\n\n149\n00:08:05,491 --> 00:08:09,330\nthings that are actually going inside\nof your computer, like memory.\n\n150\n00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:14,880\nBut you'll see where they have external\ndevices too, like external hard drives.\n\n151\n00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,110\nLet me fire that up in a new tab,\nwe've got Flash memory and\n\n152\n00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:23,360\nwe'll see other types of memory that\ncan be outside of your computer.\n\n153\n00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,180\nWe have printers, keyboards, and mice.\n\n154\n00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,780\nThose are things that are sitting\noutside of your computer.\n\n155\n00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,840\nIn Devices, these will be good.\n\n156\n00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,890\nSo various other input devices.\n\n157\n00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,820\nIf that'll respond for me.\n\n158\n00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,400\nThese are all things we can\nattach outside of our computer.\n\n159\n00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,070\nI mentioned that I have an external\nhard drive sitting outside of mine.\n\n160\n00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,600\nAnd so here on Newegg's website,\n\n161\n00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,030\nyou can see all of these\ndifferent external hard drives.\n\n162\n00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:52,100\nThey might look a little different but\nthey all work the same way, like mine.\n\n163\n00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,040\nSo this is mine,\n\n164\n00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,980\nwhich looks very similar to the one's\nthat we're seeing on the website there.\n\n165\n00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,860\nAnd, it's just a hard drive\nin there with a cable so\n\n166\n00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,060\nyou can attach it to\nthe outside of your computer.\n\n167\n00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:07,140\nAnd when you plug that in,\nnow you get more storage on your system so\n\n168\n00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,930\nthat you don't have to have\na giant hard drive in your laptop.\n\n169\n00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:14,860\nOr maybe you have some files that you want\nto move between two computers quickly.\n\n170\n00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,250\nAn external drive like this\ncan really help with it.\n\n171\n00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,460\nSo that's kind of\nthe purpose of one of these.\n\n172\n00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,330\n>> Yeah.\n\n173\n00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,310\nAnd a lot of times you\nsee the smaller drives,\n\n174\n00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,460\nlike what we traditionally\ncall things like thumb drives.\n\n175\n00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,690\nAnd today the microSD cards, these allow\nus to transfer data very quickly between\n\n176\n00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,100\ntwo devices without having\nto get them setup and\n\n177\n00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,500\nnetworked together to be able to do so.\n\n178\n00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,320\nAnd they come in different capacities.\n\n179\n00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,890\nAnd a lot of these plug directly\ninto a port on the computer.\n\n180\n00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:46,000\nOr, like the one that Don showed, can\nplug into some other different standards,\n\n181\n00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,160\nlike USB, not FireWire, Thunderbolt.\n\n182\n00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,277\nI was trying to make sure I remembered\n[CROSSTALK] which one it was.\n\n183\n00:09:51,277 --> 00:09:54,280\n>> Yeah, let's talk about some\nof those different things.\n\n184\n00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,240\nI know I'm going out of order from our\nshow notes here, but let's do it anyway.\n\n185\n00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,090\nSo, when you buy an external device,\nbe it a mouse, a keyboard,\n\n186\n00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:04,450\na hard drive, a printer,\nor whatever it is.\n\n187\n00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,100\nIf it's external it's gotta have\na cable to plug into your computer.\n\n188\n00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:12,850\nAnd the most common type of cable that\nyou're going to find out there today\n\n189\n00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:17,890\nis what's called a USB cable,\na Universal Serial Bus, USB.\n\n190\n00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:22,090\nEvery computer that's on the market\ntoday has at least one USB port, and\n\n191\n00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,740\nthey normally have more.\n\n192\n00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,750\nYou'll find laptops that\nhave several running.\n\n193\n00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,330\nHow many do you have on your laptop?\n\n194\n00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,130\n>> I have two USB slots on mine.\n\n195\n00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,160\n>> All right, and\nI've got two on mine also.\n\n196\n00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,570\nOn a desktop like mine at home, mine at\nhome actually has ten USB ports on it.\n\n197\n00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,320\nAnd sadly I've added four more,\nso I actually kind of ran out.\n\n198\n00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,210\nSo, why do we need so many of those ports?\n\n199\n00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,010\nBecause you can get so\nmany different devices that use it.\n\n200\n00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:50,680\nYou can get joysticks, keyboards,\nmice, printers, cameras, hard drives,\n\n201\n00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,130\nreally any kind of external\ndevice that you want in USB.\n\n202\n00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,900\nUniversal Serial Bus,\nany device can use it.\n\n203\n00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,918\nAnd back in the old day, different\ndevices all had different cables and\n\n204\n00:11:00,918 --> 00:11:02,530\nit was really frustrating.\n\n205\n00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:07,700\nBut in today's world, USB is this kind of\nnew standard that almost everything uses,\n\n206\n00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,600\nand it makes buying a cable\na heck of a lot easier.\n\n207\n00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,040\n>> The different cables\nthat we end up using,\n\n208\n00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,290\nwe're not going to get too much into some\nof those super detailed specifications.\n\n209\n00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,630\nBut, if you do want to actually\nlearn more about that,\n\n210\n00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:23,650\ndon't forget to check out our A plus\nepisodes to be able to do that.\n\n211\n00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,970\nWhere we go into depth on each of\nthose different cable types and\n\n212\n00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,310\nyou'll learn more about them and\n\n213\n00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:31,500\nsome of the different connectors that\nare actually involved with them too.\n\n214\n00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,634\n>> All right, but at a high level,\n\n215\n00:11:32,634 --> 00:11:35,560\nlet's talk about some of the little\ncomponents to worry about here.\n\n216\n00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,280\nUSB is nice,\nbecause almost everybody has it.\n\n217\n00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,880\nBut when you go to buy a USB device,\n\n218\n00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,370\nyou'll often times see where they say\nthey're USB 1.1, USB 2.0, USB 3.0.\n\n219\n00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,510\nWhat's that all about?\n\n220\n00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:54,660\n>> The USB standard has different speeds\nassociated with when they came out\n\n221\n00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,770\nin their development.\n\n222\n00:11:55,770 --> 00:12:01,630\nSo USB, the original standard or 1.1, gave\nyou up to about 12 megabits of throughput.\n\n223\n00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:05,610\nIn other words, how fast you could\nsend data to that device and\n\n224\n00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:06,990\neven retrieve data off.\n\n225\n00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:11,770\nThe second one was USB 2.0\nwhich made it much faster and\n\n226\n00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:15,150\ngave you throughput of up to about 480 Mb.\n\n227\n00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:19,330\nSo, much faster than what we\nhave at the regular USB 1.1.\n\n228\n00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:23,820\nAnd the, I don't wanna say the latest\nstandard, next to latest standard I guess,\n\n229\n00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:29,350\nis USB 3.0, and that gives you\nalmost 5 Gb of actual throughput.\n\n230\n00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:34,340\nAnd that's way faster,\nabout eight times as fast as the USB 2.0.\n\n231\n00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:40,280\nSo it's jumped in speed from about 12 Mb\nall the way up to about 5 Gb, which is\n\n232\n00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:45,620\nan incredible jump in speed and how fast\nwe can transfer data into those devices.\n\n233\n00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,850\n>> Yeah, USB standard itself is actually\na very old standard at this point.\n\n234\n00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,960\nThe first USB devices that\nwere commercially viable.\n\n235\n00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,140\nIn other words, not insanely expensive,\n\n236\n00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,990\nreally started coming out\nback in the mid 1990s.\n\n237\n00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,960\nSo this is a long time ago now.\n\n238\n00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,820\nIt's 20 years ago, really, that we started\nseeing those USB devices coming out.\n\n239\n00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,260\nSo it's evolved a good bit over the years.\n\n240\n00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,530\nThe general rule of thumb is,\nthe higher the version number,\n\n241\n00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,020\nthe faster the device is.\n\n242\n00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,040\nBut they're all backwards compatible.\n\n243\n00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,210\nIf I have a USB 3.0 device.\n\n244\n00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:18,780\nAnd I plug it in a USB 1.1 port, well,\n\n245\n00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,770\nit'll just slow down in\nthe old USB 1.1 port.\n\n246\n00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,670\nSo it'll still work, but\n\n247\n00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,060\nWindows will give you a little\nwarning message, and it'll say,\n\n248\n00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:30,930\nthis device could be faster if you plugged\nit into a port that was a higher version.\n\n249\n00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,270\nSo that's one of the things\nwe need to be aware of.\n\n250\n00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:37,020\nWhen you buy a USB device,\nbe it a hard drive, printer, whatever.\n\n251\n00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,670\nIf it says it's USB 3.0,\n\n252\n00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:44,020\nit'd be nice to plug it into a USB\n3.0 port versus USB 2.0 or 1.1.\n\n253\n00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,560\nAnd you'll need to look\nat the documentation for\n\n254\n00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,528\nyour computer to find out\nwhat speed your ports are at.\n\n255\n00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:52,320\nBut USB is really handy.\n\n256\n00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,770\nWe use the heck out of\nit here in the studio.\n\n257\n00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:57,580\nI've got numerous USB devices hooked\nup right here in front of me.\n\n258\n00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,230\nMy track ball, my hard drive,\nrunning your network adapter,\n\n259\n00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,840\nthese are all connected via USB.\n\n260\n00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:07,670\nBut, my network adapter\n\n261\n00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:10,900\nover here is actually hooked up\nusing a different type of connector.\n\n262\n00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,640\nThere are other universal\nstandards that are out there.\n\n263\n00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,290\nUSB is just the most popular.\n\n264\n00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,370\nThat's the one you're\ngoing to see the most.\n\n265\n00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,480\nSome of the other ones you might see,\nFireWire.\n\n266\n00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,240\nFireWire is another standard\nthat is very similar to USB.\n\n267\n00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,050\nYou can have practically any\ntype of device, cameras,\n\n268\n00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:32,720\nmice, keyboards, whatever,\nthat hook up via FireWire.\n\n269\n00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,440\nAnd FireWire is actually\na little bit faster than USB.\n\n270\n00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,970\nNow if it does the same\nbasic thing as USB and\n\n271\n00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:42,900\nit's a little bit faster,\nwhy aren't we all using FireWire today?\n\n272\n00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,790\nWhy are we using USB?\n\n273\n00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,330\nIt comes down to money.\n\n274\n00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,050\nFireWire is more expensive.\n\n275\n00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:52,920\nFireWire was developed in a kind of\npartnership between Apple and Intel.\n\n276\n00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,370\nAnd if you want to do a FireWire\nbased port on a system,\n\n277\n00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:00,320\nthey have to pay royalties to Intel\nwhich in turn pays royalties to Apple.\n\n278\n00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,350\nSo that means that it costs more\nto put those ports on the system.\n\n279\n00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,850\nUSB doesn't and so more people go to USB.\n\n280\n00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,428\nSometimes its not the best\ntechnology that wins a battle.\n\n281\n00:15:10,428 --> 00:15:14,610\nIt's the most easily accessible\ntechnology, and that's what USB did.\n\n282\n00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,420\n>> There's other types of standards\nthat are also out there depending on\n\n283\n00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,330\nthe device.\n\n284\n00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:23,056\nMost of the devices that we've\ntalked about, regular USB 1.1 and\n\n285\n00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:27,290\neven 2.0, will do perfectly fine for\neverything that we need.\n\n286\n00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,180\nBut when we start talking\nabout storage devices,\n\n287\n00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,260\njust like the one that Don\nhas on the desk over here.\n\n288\n00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:36,480\nThe faster we can get\naccess to that device\n\n289\n00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,100\nthe better the connection is gonna be,\nand that's what we really want.\n\n290\n00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:45,270\nAnother standard that's out there\nis one we call ESATA, E-S-A-T-A.\n\n291\n00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,380\nAnd, all external devices.\n\n292\n00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:51,170\nIf you're using something like USB 2.0 or\n3.0.\n\n293\n00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,946\nUsually what ends up happening is that\nthey're slower because we have to transfer\n\n294\n00:15:54,946 --> 00:15:56,160\ndata out of the computer.\n\n295\n00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,920\nThe eSATA standard says look,\nlet's not do that.\n\n296\n00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,062\nLet's make sure we get the same speeds\nexternally to those external devices as\n\n297\n00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:06,230\nwe have running internally\nto those hard drives.\n\n298\n00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,230\nAnd so that's why that's a standard.\n\n299\n00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,030\nBut you don't tend to see\ntoo many of those anymore.\n\n300\n00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:16,020\n>> Yeah, the main reason the eSATA even\ncame about was storage speed, right?\n\n301\n00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:20,300\nUSB 2.0 was considerably slower than\nwhat a native hard drive would be.\n\n302\n00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,280\nAnd so they introduced this eSATA.\n\n303\n00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,590\nNow eSATA was just for hard drives.\n\n304\n00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,320\nIt wouldn't work for mice,\nkeyboards, anything else.\n\n305\n00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,770\nJust hard drives.\n\n306\n00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,060\nNow the reason we don't see it so\n\n307\n00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:35,070\nmuch anymore is when USB 3.0 came out,\nit was a lot faster.\n\n308\n00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:39,330\nAnd by being faster it kind of eliminated\nthe need for the specialized port.\n\n309\n00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,560\nYou do still see eSATA\non a lot of systems,\n\n310\n00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,520\nI know my computer at home has eSATA.\n\n311\n00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,580\nDoes your laptop have eSATA?\n\n312\n00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:50,150\n>> My laptop does not, but\nthe laptop I have at home actually does.\n\n313\n00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,880\n>> And that's how I am.\n\n314\n00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,400\nMy old laptop had eSATA.\n\n315\n00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,780\nMy new laptop doesn't.\n\n316\n00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:58,020\nAnd it's because of the advanced speed of\nUSB 3.0 now that we've seen that go away.\n\n317\n00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,970\nBut they are still out there.\n\n318\n00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:01,950\nJust remember if you have an eSATA port\non your computer, you can use it for\n\n319\n00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:05,160\na hard drive hookup, and\nit gives you really good speed\n\n320\n00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,672\nif you don't have something\nlike USB 3.0 to make up for it.\n\n321\n00:17:07,672 --> 00:17:09,180\nAll right.\n\n322\n00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,330\nThe only other one that, well actually,\n\n323\n00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,490\nyeah I guess the only other one\nwe call out is a tricky one.\n\n324\n00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:19,870\nWhen it comes to storage devices,\nhard drives, we could have a hard\n\n325\n00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:24,690\ndrive that's not in our computer, that's\nnot directly attached to our computer but\n\n326\n00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,270\nis instead out there on the network.\n\n327\n00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,000\nThere's a technology called iSCSI.\n\n328\n00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,910\nAnd what iSCSI does is it allows you to\ntake your hard drive communications and\n\n329\n00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,840\nsend them over your network.\n\n330\n00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,890\nNow if you're on a wireless network,\nit's too slow.\n\n331\n00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:42,870\nDon't even bother with this, but if you're\non wired network that's at a giga bit\n\n332\n00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,740\nspeed or whatever, the speeds\nare actually pretty passable and\n\n333\n00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,980\nyou can connect to this drive and\nyour computer will think that it's local.\n\n334\n00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,590\nThat it's directly attached when it's\nactually out there on the network.\n\n335\n00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,710\nNow we don't normally use\nthis on work stations so\n\n336\n00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,000\non Windows 7 you're not\nlikely going to use it.\n\n337\n00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,140\nBut you can.\nThe support is there for iSCSI.\n\n338\n00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,070\nWe've got a server here that I'll\nshow you in a minute when we use it.\n\n339\n00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,830\nBut there are vendors out\nthere like Drobo pops to mind.\n\n340\n00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,840\nLet me pull up their website.\n\n341\n00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,030\nDrobo pops to mind because that's one\nof the devices that we have here.\n\n342\n00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:16,525\nThey're a company that makes network\nstorage and what you'll see is\n\n343\n00:18:16,525 --> 00:18:21,745\na device like, where is it, this one where\n\n344\n00:18:21,745 --> 00:18:25,415\nthey've got a giant bank of what is that\nlike 14 hard drives or 12 hard drives?\n\n345\n00:18:25,415 --> 00:18:26,497\n>> Yeah.\n\n346\n00:18:26,497 --> 00:18:28,847\n>> A huge bank of drives,\na lot of storage,\n\n347\n00:18:28,847 --> 00:18:31,147\nand you plug your network into it.\n\n348\n00:18:31,147 --> 00:18:32,167\nAnd then you can have one or\n\n349\n00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:35,709\nmore computers all connect to\nthese drives via the network.\n\n350\n00:18:35,709 --> 00:18:36,387\nAll right?\n\n351\n00:18:36,387 --> 00:18:40,927\nNow we know we can do shared folders and\nbrowse that way, but with iSCSI,\n\n352\n00:18:40,927 --> 00:18:44,257\nyour computer actually thinks the hard\ndrive is right there in the system, and\n\n353\n00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:46,380\nlet me show you what I mean.\n\n354\n00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,580\nHere's a server that we have running\nin our server room back there.\n\n355\n00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,920\nAnd when I go into the disk\nmanagement on that server,\n\n356\n00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:57,030\njust like we see in Windows 7, I can see\nthat it's got a 2 terrabyte hard drive.\n\n357\n00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,290\nRight here, it's S drive, okay?\n\n358\n00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:03,632\nAnd it shows up, here's my S drive and\nit looks just like my C drive.\n\n359\n00:19:03,632 --> 00:19:04,290\nRight?\nSo\n\n360\n00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:07,230\nit looks the same as the other\ndrive that's in there.\n\n361\n00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:10,990\nAs far as the system is concerned\nthese two drives are both internal to\n\n362\n00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:16,490\nthe server, but\nthis is what's called the iSCSI Initiator.\n\n363\n00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,340\nThis is what connects to that drive.\n\n364\n00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:22,610\nAnd I can see right here where I'm\nconnected to this crazy network address.\n\n365\n00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:24,020\nThis is called an IQN.\n\n366\n00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:28,420\nAnd this crazy address is telling it, hey\nwhen you try to write to that hard drive\n\n367\n00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,320\nwe actually need to send it\nover the network to this guy.\n\n368\n00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,010\nAnd then when we read from the hard drive\nwe need to reach out to that guy and\n\n369\n00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:34,920\nread from it.\n\n370\n00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,490\nSo its kind of translating it,\nhiding it in the background so\n\n371\n00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,980\nthat we don't realize that.\n\n372\n00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,240\nAnd then Windows just looks\nlike a local drive, all right?\n\n373\n00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,730\nIts a neat technology because it\ndoesn't have to be directly attached\n\n374\n00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:51,180\nto your computer and you can even share\nthat storage amongst multiple systems.\n\n375\n00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,890\nWhen you have a USB hard drive,\nyou can only plug that into one computer.\n\n376\n00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:58,540\nWhen you have a eSATA drive,\nyou can only plug it into one computer.\n\n377\n00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:02,570\nBut when you have an iSCSI system, you\ncan actually have more than one computer\n\n378\n00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:06,090\nconnected to it, and there's some uses for\nthat in the server world.\n\n379\n00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:08,210\nNot so much in the workstation world.\n\n380\n00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:11,060\nSo if you wanna learn more about that,\ndefinitely jump over and check out those\n\n381\n00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:14,220\nserver shows because we do cover the iSCSI\ntarget a lot more over there and\n\n382\n00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,550\nthe iSCSI initiator.\n\n383\n00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,490\nBut for the MTA they just want you to\nbe familiar with what this idea is,\n\n384\n00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,730\nthat the hard drives\nare attached to the network and\n\n385\n00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,558\nyour computer sees them as local.\n\n386\n00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:24,724\nAll right.\n\n387\n00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:28,670\nSo those are some of the different\nstorage types that are out there.\n\n388\n00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:32,620\nWhen we go and\nbuy external storage Microsoft does call\n\n389\n00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,820\nout a few other things that we've\nactually covered in previous episodes.\n\n390\n00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,980\nBut let's recap those real quick,\n\n391\n00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,010\njust in case you are watching\nthe episodes out of order.\n\n392\n00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,700\nWhen you get an external hard drive and\n\n393\n00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:47,100\nyou hook it up the first time,\nyou may need to format the drive.\n\n394\n00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,200\nThe storage that you get will\nhave a file system on there and\n\n395\n00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,250\nin today's world you're normally\ngoing to see FAT32 and NTFS.\n\n396\n00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,460\nThose are kinda the two most common.\n\n397\n00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:01,410\nThere's some other ones like FAT, which\nis older or exFAT, which is newer but\n\n398\n00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:04,890\nthe two main ones you need to know for\nthe exam are FAT32 and NTFS.\n\n399\n00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,520\nSo, if you get an external drive and\n\n400\n00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,695\nyou need to format it as one of those\ntwo file systems, which one do you pick?\n\n401\n00:21:11,695 --> 00:21:13,600\n>> Yeah.\n>> Which is right for us?\n\n402\n00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,200\n>> We normally would pick the file\nsystem based on our specific need.\n\n403\n00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,700\nA lot of times, it comes down to how big\npartitions we want to create on that hard\n\n404\n00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,470\ndrive, how we want to\ndivide that hard drive up.\n\n405\n00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:27,472\nAnd also,\nthe largest file size that we will need.\n\n406\n00:21:27,472 --> 00:21:32,190\nWith FAT32, the maximum file size\nis going to be about 4 gigs and\n\n407\n00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:37,390\nthe maximum partition is going to be about\n32 gigs or a little bit less that 32 gigs.\n\n408\n00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:41,239\nSo that means if you actually want to\ncreate a hard drive with 120 gigs,\n\n409\n00:21:41,239 --> 00:21:44,900\nit's probably not the way for\nyou to be able to do that.\n\n410\n00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:51,040\nGoing to NTFS we can actually have file\nsizes that are larger than 4 gigabytes,\n\n411\n00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:56,700\nand we can create partitions\nup to 256 terabytes in size.\n\n412\n00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,650\nSo this gives you an ability to actually\nhave incredibly large files and\n\n413\n00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,770\nreally large partitioning\nof hard drives too.\n\n414\n00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:08,020\n>> Yeah, now so it sounds like most of\nthe time we're gonna want to go NTFS\n\n415\n00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,000\nwhen we format that drive.\n\n416\n00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,080\nBut when you buy a drive it's\nrarely going to be formatted NTFS.\n\n417\n00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,180\nWhy is that?\n\n418\n00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:17,000\nWell NTFS just works with Windows.\n\n419\n00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,670\nIf you have a Mac or a Linux machine,\nit doesn't work out so well.\n\n420\n00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,670\nSo if you're going for compatibility,\n\n421\n00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:25,732\nto be able to move that drive between\nsystems, you'll want to format\n\n422\n00:22:25,732 --> 00:22:30,870\nit at FAT32, and so a lot of the companies\nthat manufacture these external drives,\n\n423\n00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:36,270\nthey'll go ahead and format it at FAT32\nanticipating how you might be using it.\n\n424\n00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:39,450\nAnd we're starting to see a new\nstandard of exFAT that's out,\n\n425\n00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:42,675\nwhich gets us past that 32 gig limit.\n\n426\n00:22:42,675 --> 00:22:45,970\nCuz if you buy a 250 gig external drive\nyou don't want it to have all these\n\n427\n00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:48,420\nsmall partitions across\nit if you don't have to.\n\n428\n00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,690\nSo things are changing in that world.\n\n429\n00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:55,680\nFor the exam though, it's a Microsoft\nexam and so we're normally talking NTFS.\n\n430\n00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,230\nRight?\n\n431\n00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:59,880\nIf the drive is not formatted when you\nfirst plug it in it'll ask you, it'll say\n\n432\n00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,040\nhey Windows needs to format this drive to\nuse it and you just say okay that's it.\n\n433\n00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,920\nRight?\nBut if you need to switch it\n\n434\n00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,615\nbetween one file system and another,\nwe showed that in, what was that episode?\n\n435\n00:23:08,615 --> 00:23:09,845\nIt's like storage episode, right?\n\n436\n00:23:09,845 --> 00:23:10,806\n>> It was, yeah.\n\n437\n00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,035\nIt was files and folders.\n\n438\n00:23:13,035 --> 00:23:13,765\n>> Files and folders, yep.\n\n439\n00:23:13,765 --> 00:23:16,445\nSo check out the files and\nfolder episode in this very show, right?\n\n440\n00:23:16,445 --> 00:23:20,405\nIn the MTA show and\nwe cover doing the formats in there.\n\n441\n00:23:20,405 --> 00:23:22,290\nThe other thing they mentioned\nwas security, right Ronnie?\n\n442\n00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,125\n>> Yeah.\n\n443\n00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:26,625\nSecurity is an important part of what\nwe're actually trying to make sure that\n\n444\n00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:29,750\neverybody understands,\nit's going to be a big part of our world.\n\n445\n00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:33,357\nBut for things like external\nstorage devices and our laptops and\n\n446\n00:23:33,357 --> 00:23:37,828\nour hard drives, one of the things that we\nworry about the most is losing the data\n\n447\n00:23:37,828 --> 00:23:42,233\non them due to things like me leaving my\nlaptop out, and somebody stealing it or\n\n448\n00:23:42,233 --> 00:23:45,960\nsomebody just walking off with\nDon's external storage device.\n\n449\n00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,433\nAnd then being able to take that drive and\nplug it into their own computer and\n\n450\n00:23:50,433 --> 00:23:52,500\nget access to all the data on that.\n\n451\n00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:57,120\nSo what Microsoft has actually done inside\nof the operating system Is that they've\n\n452\n00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,840\ndeveloped, really,\ntwo technologies a long time ago.\n\n453\n00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,840\nBut it's very popular today.\n\n454\n00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:08,400\nOne's called BitLocker, which allows us to\nbe able to encrypt the entire hard drive.\n\n455\n00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,650\nAnd then if we don't wanna be able to do.\n\n456\n00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,930\nOr we don't wanna be able.\n\n457\n00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:14,720\nWe don't wanna do something like\nencrypt the entire hard drive.\n\n458\n00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,600\nWe instead, can use what we\ncall encrypting file system,\n\n459\n00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,780\nmore commonly known as EFS.\n\n460\n00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,600\n>> And EFS just lets us encrypt\nindividual files or folders.\n\n461\n00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,150\nSo instead of encrypting the whole drive,\n\n462\n00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,820\nyou just pick your sensitive data and\nencrypt that.\n\n463\n00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,860\nBoth of the technologies require NTFS,\nthough, they don't work on FAT32.\n\n464\n00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,720\nSo we need to have NTFS in\nplace to take advantage\n\n465\n00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,570\nof either of those encryption standards.\n\n466\n00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,830\nIf you rely on FAT32,\n\n467\n00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:40,610\nyou'll need to use some kind of\nthird party software for encryption.\n\n468\n00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:44,110\nAnd we show EFS and how to use that back\nin that same file and folders episode, so\n\n469\n00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,110\nif you haven't watched it yet\nit's definitely one to check out.\n\n470\n00:24:47,212 --> 00:24:49,530\nAll right, now we've got some\nmore to talk about on storage.\n\n471\n00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,199\nWe need to talk about some of\nthe drive types that we bump into, and\n\n472\n00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:57,336\ncloud storage where it's not even in\nthe same building as us, so we need to\n\n473\n00:24:57,336 --> 00:25:01,303\ntake a look at each of those but\nthis a very good to stop and take a break.\n\n474\n00:25:01,303 --> 00:25:04,956\nSo, let's pause here for a moment and when\nwe get back, we'll talk a little bit more\n\n475\n00:25:04,956 --> 00:25:07,380\nabout storage,\nbefore moving onto our other devices.\n\n476\n00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,595\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n477\n00:25:09,595 --> 00:25:13,054\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n478\n00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:18,595\nwelcome back, everybody.\n\n479\n00:25:18,595 --> 00:25:23,429\nNow, when you attach a new hard drive to\nyour system if it's completely blank,\n\n480\n00:25:23,429 --> 00:25:26,027\nor if the vendor's already formatted it,\n\n481\n00:25:26,027 --> 00:25:30,960\nwhen you attach it Windows will detect\nit as what's called a basic disc.\n\n482\n00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,900\nA basic disc follows a certain set\nof rules that are very, very old.\n\n483\n00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,220\nRules that were actually\nestablished way back in the 1980's.\n\n484\n00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,390\nAnd there's certain limitations\nwe need to be aware of there.\n\n485\n00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:46,460\nAnd then we have the option to switch\nto a new type of disc which is called\n\n486\n00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,690\na dynamic disc.\n\n487\n00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:51,290\nAnd that eliminates those rules and\nallows us to do some crazier,\n\n488\n00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:54,660\nmore advanced things but\nthere's some trade offs we'll see.\n\n489\n00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:58,330\nSo let's talk a little bit about\nthat basic vs dynamic disc.\n\n490\n00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:01,980\nLet's say I get a new drive, stick it\non the outside of my computer, and\n\n491\n00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:06,740\nI don't change it, right, Windows\nwill pick it up as a basic disc and\n\n492\n00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,650\nlet's take a look at\nthe rules that apply to that.\n\n493\n00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:14,440\n>> The rules that generally apply to basic\ndiscs is that, at the very beginning,\n\n494\n00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,010\nthey never thought that hard\ndrives would be very big and\n\n495\n00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:21,800\nthey gave us the limitation of being able\nto create up to four basic chunks or\n\n496\n00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,290\nfour basic partitions\non that one hard drive.\n\n497\n00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,725\nYou couldn't do five.\n\n498\n00:26:26,725 --> 00:26:27,675\nMaximum was four.\n\n499\n00:26:27,675 --> 00:26:29,375\nYou could do one through four.\n\n500\n00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:31,565\n>> Now, what is a partition?\n\n501\n00:26:31,565 --> 00:26:33,795\nA lot of people don't use partitions.\n\n502\n00:26:33,795 --> 00:26:35,155\nNormally, I don't.\n\n503\n00:26:35,155 --> 00:26:37,895\nMost of my systems I don't\nbother doing a partition.\n\n504\n00:26:37,895 --> 00:26:42,270\nWhat a partition is where you\ntake one physical hard drive and\n\n505\n00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:47,310\nyou divide it up into more\nthan one logical hard drive.\n\n506\n00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,170\nRight?\nIt's not like you're\n\n507\n00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:50,660\nactually cracking that hard\ndrive in half to make it two.\n\n508\n00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:53,560\nYou're creating a logical\nboundary that divides it up.\n\n509\n00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,500\nYou can divide it up however you want.\n\n510\n00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,803\nSo, for example on my laptop right here,\nI have the hard drive divided in half.\n\n511\n00:27:00,803 --> 00:27:03,390\nI have a 512 gig hard drive,\nand I have it divided in half.\n\n512\n00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:09,600\nSo I've got a 256 gig logical hard drive,\nthat I use when i'm running Mac OS and\n\n513\n00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,070\nanother 256 gig hard drive that I\nuse when i'm running Windows 8.\n\n514\n00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:17,110\nSo it's like I have two different\nhard drives in my computer\n\n515\n00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,840\neven though it's one physical drive.\n\n516\n00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,270\nThat's what a partition is.\n\n517\n00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,990\nAnd I use it for\nbooting different operating systems,\n\n518\n00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,910\nthere's plenty of other\nreasons you might do it.\n\n519\n00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,070\nYou might do it just to keep\nyour files separate and\n\n520\n00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:31,310\nbe able to identify what's what,\nbut for most people,\n\n521\n00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:35,950\nthey get a hard drive, and\nthey do one big partition, right.\n\n522\n00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,920\nNow I've got both examples\nhere on this machine.\n\n523\n00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,160\nLet's take a look at it.\n\n524\n00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,370\nThis is the hard drive set-up that\nwe were using in the file and\n\n525\n00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,690\nstorage episode, all right.\n\n526\n00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:47,780\nSo if you watched the file and storage\nepisode you'll remember where we created\n\n527\n00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,610\nsome of these different partitions.\n\n528\n00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:53,970\nAnd I've got my C drive here,\nthis is a 60 gig hard drive.\n\n529\n00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:57,590\nAnd the entire hard drive\nin in one partition.\n\n530\n00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:03,030\nSo if the hard drive is 60 gigs,\nmy C drive is also 60 gigs, right?\n\n531\n00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:06,650\nIt's using that whole drive just for\nmy C drive.\n\n532\n00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,980\nBut my second disk.\n\n533\n00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:12,770\nI've got a 64 gig disk,\nhere, as my second one.\n\n534\n00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:16,540\nI've divided it up and\nyou'll see where I've got an E drive.\n\n535\n00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,780\nThat's when I format an NTFS.\n\n536\n00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:21,930\nWe got an F drive that I did fat 32 and\na G drive that's just fat.\n\n537\n00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:24,555\nAnd then I've got this unallocated space.\n\n538\n00:28:24,555 --> 00:28:28,315\nSpace I've I haven't used for\nanything yet.\n\n539\n00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:29,015\nAll right?\n\n540\n00:28:29,015 --> 00:28:34,405\nNow, when I created those partitions\nin my mind I was remembering the rules,\n\n541\n00:28:34,405 --> 00:28:35,885\nthe limits that I had.\n\n542\n00:28:35,885 --> 00:28:40,380\nAnd I knew that I was just creating three\nof those partitions and I was fine.\n\n543\n00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,430\nBut if I want to create a fourth one,\n\n544\n00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:45,380\nI'm going to bump into a little\nbit of a problem, all right.\n\n545\n00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:50,710\nFour is the maximum amount of partitions\nyou can have when you are a basic disk,\n\n546\n00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,410\nlike what it's showing right here.\n\n547\n00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:56,260\nSo the reason Is,\nthis is all tied to a master boot record,\n\n548\n00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:59,970\nan MBR and it imposes these\nlimits of the four partitions.\n\n549\n00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:04,590\nSo if I want to go beyond that, there's\nsomething really weird that has to happen.\n\n550\n00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:10,710\nAnd the weird thing is, it's going to\nhave to create a fourth partition,\n\n551\n00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,920\nbut it's not going to be\nthe same as these guys.\n\n552\n00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:17,390\nThe fourth partition is going to\nbe basically like a placeholder.\n\n553\n00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:21,210\nAnd inside of it we can start\nto create fake partitions and\n\n554\n00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:24,600\nthat's where we can create a fifth,\na sixth, a seventh, an eighth and\n\n555\n00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,400\ncreate even more all inside\nof this one big placeholder.\n\n556\n00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,060\nSo things get really weird.\n\n557\n00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,160\nWhen you get beyond that fourth or\nthat third partition.\n\n558\n00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:36,640\nSo if I were to add another one,\nI've got 22 gigs of space.\n\n559\n00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,060\nSo let's say I want to\ncreate three more drives.\n\n560\n00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:43,180\nSo I'm gonna do about seven gigs each and\ncreate three more drives, or\n\n561\n00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,790\nthree more partitions.\n\n562\n00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:48,303\nSo I'll right click and\nchoose to do a new volume.\n\n563\n00:29:48,303 --> 00:29:50,360\nI'm just going to page through this,\nI'm not going to do too much.\n\n564\n00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,886\nBut on the size, I want it to just be\nseven gigs, because I've only got so\n\n565\n00:29:54,886 --> 00:29:56,011\nmuch space left.\n\n566\n00:29:56,011 --> 00:29:57,887\nSo I'll do a seven gig drive, and\n\n567\n00:29:57,887 --> 00:30:00,920\nI'm going to give it\na letter of H drive is fine.\n\n568\n00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:07,820\nI'll format it NTFS and I'll call this,\nwe'll just call it Drive One.\n\n569\n00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,650\nAlright?\n\n570\n00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:09,600\nSo it's gonna create that.\n\n571\n00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,300\nNow when it creates it look at what\nhappened to my unallocated space.\n\n572\n00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:18,720\nThere's this dark green box,\nthat's the placeholder.\n\n573\n00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,960\nAnd if you look down here that's\ncalled an extended Partition.\n\n574\n00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,730\nThese guys were primary partitions.\n\n575\n00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,980\nThink of a primary partition as a normal.\n\n576\n00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,920\nIt's a normal partition.\n\n577\n00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,700\nThat's what we want, primary, right?\n\n578\n00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,730\nSo, my C drive up here is\none big primary partition.\n\n579\n00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:37,750\nMy E, F, and G,\nthose are all primary partitions.\n\n580\n00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,130\nBut this green box is a placeholder.\n\n581\n00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,760\nThat's an extended.\n\n582\n00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,970\nAnd inside of it we create these fake or\nlogical partitions.\n\n583\n00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,790\nAnd so here's my H drive that I just made.\n\n584\n00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,950\nAnd it's a different blue color.\n\n585\n00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,700\nAnd looking down here,\nI can see it's a logical drive.\n\n586\n00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,840\nAnd now I can start to create more in the\nfree space that's available inside of that\n\n587\n00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,730\nextended partition.\n\n588\n00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:01,860\nSo I can create another 7 gig partition.\n\n589\n00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,110\nI'll call this one Drive Two.\n\n590\n00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:08,970\nAnd assuming I've done good math,\nI should be able to create one more.\n\n591\n00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,040\nOh, yeah.\nI got plenty of room.\n\n592\n00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,320\nSo I'll create one more.\n\n593\n00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,360\nAnd you can just keep going.\n\n594\n00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,650\nThere's no limit to the amount of logical.\n\n595\n00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:17,760\nI'm not aware of a limit.\n\n596\n00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,460\nAre you aware of a limit, Ronnie?\n\n597\n00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:23,270\n>> The only limitation is if you wanted\nto assign drive letters to them, but, no.\n\n598\n00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,180\n>> You run out of letters.\n\n599\n00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,490\n>> Yeah, once you run out of letters,\nthen assigning drive letters you can't.\n\n600\n00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:30,428\nBut you can then go ahead and access\nit as a folder on your other drives.\n\n601\n00:31:30,428 --> 00:31:33,303\n>> And that's a good point,\na drive doesn't have to have a letter.\n\n602\n00:31:33,303 --> 00:31:36,715\nWe could attach it to, they call it a\nmount point, a folder on your hard drive,\n\n603\n00:31:36,715 --> 00:31:38,130\nand make it available that way.\n\n604\n00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,710\nSo there are like H, I, and J.\n\n605\n00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:44,730\nThose are those letters, but we could\nchange that to a folder, you can even have\n\n606\n00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:48,630\nit in both, where it had a letter and\na folder if you wanted to go really crazy.\n\n607\n00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:51,500\nBut these are all falling inside\nof this one big place holder.\n\n608\n00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:55,870\nThat was designed as a,\noops my bad, solution, right?\n\n609\n00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:56,605\nThey said, ooh,\n\n610\n00:31:56,605 --> 00:31:59,800\nsomebody might want more than four\npartitions how are we gonna pull that off?\n\n611\n00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,230\nLet's make fake partitions.\n\n612\n00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,550\nThat's how they achieve that.\n\n613\n00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:07,520\nSo this really isn't ideal, you know,\nit's not a perfect solution because,\n\n614\n00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,010\nwe're having to kind of fake\nthe system a little bit.\n\n615\n00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:13,467\nAnd that's a problem that's\nbeen around since the '80s,\n\n616\n00:32:13,467 --> 00:32:18,540\nsince the 1980s, over 30 years ago\nthis problem is kind of existed.\n\n617\n00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,720\nNow if I want to mount these to a folder,\nit's not on the exam objectives,\n\n618\n00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,440\nbut just to see it,\nwe can right-click on any of these and\n\n619\n00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,950\nchoose Change Drive Letter and Paths.\n\n620\n00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:33,450\nAnd in here you can change the drive\nletter, or you can add more drive letters.\n\n621\n00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,450\nOr you can add a folder like I'm gonna do.\n\n622\n00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:38,580\nAnd so it will let me go and\npick a folder to mount to.\n\n623\n00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,210\nAnd so\nmaybe I'll mount this one to my C drive.\n\n624\n00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:45,610\nAnd maybe I'll create\na folder here called, Drives.\n\n625\n00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,580\nDid I spell that right?\n\n626\n00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,210\nDrives, spelling not withstanding.\n\n627\n00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:53,070\nAnd then I'll create a Drive One folder\nand then maybe I'll go ahead and do a,\n\n628\n00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,880\nwhoops that's not what I wanted.\n\n629\n00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,470\nIt's going to be mad at that.\n\n630\n00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,850\nI'll have to clean that up.\n\n631\n00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:01,490\nAlright, so I'll create a Drive Two folder\nand I'll create a Drive Three folder.\n\n632\n00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:06,110\nAnd so I'm making these folders for my\ndrives and I'll be able to attach to it.\n\n633\n00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,940\nNow see how it's not\nletting me pick Drive One?\n\n634\n00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:12,630\nAnd that's because there's something\nin that folder now, this subfolder.\n\n635\n00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:15,572\nIt won't let you mount a drive to\na folder that's got something in it, so\n\n636\n00:33:15,572 --> 00:33:16,790\nit's a little mad at me here.\n\n637\n00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:22,990\nLet me get rid of all these little\nwindows that are popping up here.\n\n638\n00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:24,550\nAlright, let me go clean\nthat up real quick and\n\n639\n00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:26,720\nI'll be able to mount to that, no problem.\n\n640\n00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,100\nSo, if I go into Drives and Drive One,\nthere's that folder I accidentally made.\n\n641\n00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,270\nWhoops, that didn't work.\n\n642\n00:33:34,475 --> 00:33:36,525\nWe'll just delete that out of there.\n\n643\n00:33:36,525 --> 00:33:39,525\nAnd now I can pick Drive One.\n\n644\n00:33:39,525 --> 00:33:43,886\nAlright, so I'm gonna mount it Drive One,\nand then I can, do the same thing, for\n\n645\n00:33:43,886 --> 00:33:47,996\neach of these other drives, mounting each\none to a folder instead of to a drive\n\n646\n00:33:47,996 --> 00:33:53,445\nletter, or in this case in addition to\nthe drive letter, I'll have both choices.\n\n647\n00:33:53,445 --> 00:33:56,025\nAnd so\nthe cool part there is from my user,\n\n648\n00:33:56,025 --> 00:33:57,465\nthey don't have to remember\ndrive letters anymore.\n\n649\n00:33:57,465 --> 00:33:59,460\nThey just browse on their hard drive and\nthey find it.\n\n650\n00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,460\nIf you've ever had a hard drive that\nwas full and you said all right,\n\n651\n00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,390\nwell I'm gonna add another big hard drive.\n\n652\n00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:07,590\nWell, now you gotta get all your data\nmoved over to that drive somehow.\n\n653\n00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,260\nThis makes it a little bit easier.\n\n654\n00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,330\nInstead of having to remember what's on\nthe C drive and what's on the D drive and\n\n655\n00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:15,550\nthe E drive, just different folders\nright there on your one drive, and\n\n656\n00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,855\nit's kind of convenient, right?\n\n657\n00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:20,015\nI at least think so.\n\n658\n00:34:20,015 --> 00:34:22,200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n659\n00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,940\nwe'll go ahead and\nmount that last one There we go.\n\n660\n00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,380\nSo now, for my regular end user,\nif they're browsing the hard drive,\n\n661\n00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:29,065\nthey browse through their computer,\nthey go into the C drive.\n\n662\n00:34:29,065 --> 00:34:32,040\nThey've got this folder called Drives and\n\n663\n00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,720\nin there they see Drive One,\nTwo, and Three.\n\n664\n00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,230\nAnd if I make those larger\n\n665\n00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:39,090\nicons you'll see where it's actually\ngot little shortcuts on them.\n\n666\n00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:43,290\nInstead of looking like folders they look\nlike drives, but when they browse in there\n\n667\n00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:46,310\nThey just see it like a folder right\nup here, and now they're on that drive.\n\n668\n00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,260\nSo, pretty cool stuff.\n\n669\n00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:47,820\n>> It is.\n\n670\n00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:54,010\n>> Now that's all in response to\nthe limitation of a basic disk.\n\n671\n00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:58,574\nSo we saw primary partitions,\nwe saw extended partitions, and\n\n672\n00:34:58,574 --> 00:35:00,610\nwe saw logical partitions.\n\n673\n00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:05,630\nNow, Microsoft came up with\na solution that gets around this.\n\n674\n00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:09,160\nBut there is our key issue,\nit's a Microsoft solution.\n\n675\n00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,640\nIf you need compatibility with any\nother operating system, Linux, MacOS,\n\n676\n00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,120\neven older versions of Windows\nprior to Windows 2000,\n\n677\n00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,860\nyou've got to stick this\nway with the basic disk.\n\n678\n00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,580\nBut if you're just dealing\nwith Windows machines,\n\n679\n00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,260\nyou can switch to what's\ncalled a dynamic disk.\n\n680\n00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:29,220\nAnd a dynamic disk removes a lot of\nthe rules that we're limited by.\n\n681\n00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,900\nIt's real easy to make a disk dynamic.\n\n682\n00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,570\nIt's really hard to undo it.\n\n683\n00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:36,270\nSo this is really a one way change for\nmost people.\n\n684\n00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:39,820\nYou can convert a basic disk\ninto a dynamic disk and\n\n685\n00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,870\nthen the rules don't apply.\n\n686\n00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,260\nAll right.\n\n687\n00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,540\nLet me show you that process.\n\n688\n00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:49,230\n>> Yeah.\nOnce you start creating the dynamic disk,\n\n689\n00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:53,320\nright, it gives you the ability to go\nbeyond that four partition limit and\n\n690\n00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,550\nnow you can actually change it up.\n\n691\n00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:58,290\nAnd there's actually just certain rules\nthat Microsoft will actually allow you to\n\n692\n00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:01,350\ncreate and you'll see all those\noptions once we change it.\n\n693\n00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,790\nNow if I take Disk One here,\nI'm just gonna right-click on Disk One,\n\n694\n00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:06,230\nand you'll see Convert to Dynamic disk.\n\n695\n00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,460\nIt's right there, I can convert,\nand it's gonna do it.\n\n696\n00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:12,970\nNow, I'm just gonna convert Disk One,\nand that's gonna convert over, and\n\n697\n00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:13,930\nwe'll let it run.\n\n698\n00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:17,530\nNow, it's just letting me know that it's\ngonna work on it, and we won't be able to\n\n699\n00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:20,430\nboot off of this disk anymore, but\nit's not my boot disk anyway, right?\n\n700\n00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,820\nMy C drive is separate.\n\n701\n00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,590\nSo, I'm okay with that, and I'll say, yes.\n\n702\n00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:28,130\nAnd it's just warning me that this is\nkind of a one way thing, all right.\n\n703\n00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:31,370\nIt says that we're not up to date,\nbut it looks like it finished.\n\n704\n00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:33,470\nIt's complaining,\nsaying my screen didn't refresh, so\n\n705\n00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,096\nI'm just gonna make it refresh real quick.\n\n706\n00:36:35,096 --> 00:36:37,380\nYou can right-click on Disk Manager and\nhit Refresh,\n\n707\n00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:42,230\nor there was an icon up there, right here,\nthat little green arrow page thing.\n\n708\n00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,730\nI can never see it, though so\nI always do it this way.\n\n709\n00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:45,510\nSo I'm just gonna refresh.\n\n710\n00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:48,930\nBut what you'll notice is that\nnow that I'm a dynamic disk I\n\n711\n00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:50,730\ndon't have the partition limit anymore.\n\n712\n00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:55,340\nSo that kind of fake extended\npartition stuff, that's gone, and\n\n713\n00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:58,830\nnow I've got six partitions which\n\n714\n00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:02,098\nMicrosoft calls volumes now when your on\na dynamic disk they call them volumes.\n\n715\n00:37:02,098 --> 00:37:05,070\nSo I've got six of these volumes and\nthey're perfectly happy and\n\n716\n00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:05,660\nthey're right there.\n\n717\n00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:09,170\nAnd we also get some\nextended functionality.\n\n718\n00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:12,320\nLike, you can set up mirrors,\n\n719\n00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,880\nwhere you're actually cloning\nthe data between two drives.\n\n720\n00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,170\nSo if one drive fails,\nyou have a backup of it.\n\n721\n00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:20,510\nYou can do stripes, where your data is\nspread across drives to increase speed.\n\n722\n00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:23,370\nThere's a lot of neat\nstuff with dynamic disks.\n\n723\n00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:27,970\nBut if you take this hard drive out and\nstick it on a Mac or\n\n724\n00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:29,930\na Linux machine,\nthey won't even recognize it.\n\n725\n00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:32,710\nThey won't even see the petitions\nbetter yet the file system.\n\n726\n00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:36,210\nAnd while it was really\neasy to convert to dynamic,\n\n727\n00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:39,040\nyou can't convert it back to a basic disk.\n\n728\n00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,900\nWell, you can't as long as\nthere's even one volume on there.\n\n729\n00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,420\nSo what you have to do is you have\nto back up all of your data and\n\n730\n00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:49,250\nthen you have to go through and\ndelete all these volumes.\n\n731\n00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,630\nWe just have to delete every\none of them off of there.\n\n732\n00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:56,110\nAnd when we delete these guys out,\nthen we can go and convert it.\n\n733\n00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,380\nSo if I delete each of these.\n\n734\n00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,870\nI'm losing all my awesome data.\n\n735\n00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:01,890\nOh, I think most of these were empty,\nanyway, so it doesn't matter.\n\n736\n00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:04,280\nBut we'll through and\ndelete all of this stuff.\n\n737\n00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,470\nAnd when they're all gone, eventually.\n\n738\n00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,525\nThere we go.\n\n739\n00:38:09,525 --> 00:38:13,925\nOnce they're all gone, now the drive is\nempty and now I can right-click on it and\n\n740\n00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:17,110\nconvert it back to a base,\noh, well it already did it.\n\n741\n00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:20,540\nSo once I deleted the last one,\nit just automatically converted it over.\n\n742\n00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:23,770\nNow I could recreate my partitions and\nrestore my data from backup.\n\n743\n00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:25,920\nNot exactly convenient is it?\n\n744\n00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,930\nSo, in real life land,\n\n745\n00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:31,900\nwe pretty much just treat that as a one\nway conversion, and you don't go back.\n\n746\n00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:35,370\n>> So if you ever find yourself where you\ndo need to go beyond that four partition\n\n747\n00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:38,990\nlimit, in Microsoft, the easiest way\nthat they're gonna tell you is simply go\n\n748\n00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:43,110\nahead and convert it over to that dynamic\ndisk, and then you can be able to do that.\n\n749\n00:38:44,218 --> 00:38:47,320\nThere is another solution that's\nout there that's kind of new and\n\n750\n00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,510\nit's using virtual hard drives.\n\n751\n00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:53,340\nIf I want a Drive One,\nDrive Two, and drive Three.\n\n752\n00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,990\nInstead of actually\nmaking them partitions,\n\n753\n00:38:55,990 --> 00:39:00,470\nI can store the entire drive\ncontents in a file, alright?\n\n754\n00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,070\nLet me show you an example of that.\n\n755\n00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,570\nThis ones a little bit more advanced.\n\n756\n00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:06,870\nMost users aren't gonna use this, but\nit is another way to get around that.\n\n757\n00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:10,540\nHere I've got my basic disk, and\nI'm just gonna create one big volume.\n\n758\n00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,560\nAnd it's gonna be 64 gigs, that's fine.\n\n759\n00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,460\nIt'll be my E drive and\nI'm just gonna call it Drives.\n\n760\n00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,040\nRight?\n\n761\n00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,220\nSo that's gonna be my drive's drive.\n\n762\n00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,220\nThere we go.\n\n763\n00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:25,480\nSo, now I just got this\none big basic disk.\n\n764\n00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:31,020\nAnd then on that disk I can create\nfiles that contain entire hard drives.\n\n765\n00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,735\nAnd the way you do that is by creating\nwhat's called a virtual hard drive.\n\n766\n00:39:33,735 --> 00:39:37,623\nIf I right click on disk management here,\nI've got Create VHD,\n\n767\n00:39:37,623 --> 00:39:39,425\ncreate a virtual hard drive.\n\n768\n00:39:39,425 --> 00:39:43,167\nAnd so I can create one and I can\nspecify where it's going to be stored.\n\n769\n00:39:43,167 --> 00:39:48,500\nI'm gonna stick this one on my E drive.\n\n770\n00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,630\nSo I am going to go to E.\n\n771\n00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:52,782\nNow it's a good idea to not to stick\nit in the root of the E drive,\n\n772\n00:39:52,782 --> 00:39:56,470\nthere is actually some limits there as\nfar as how many files you can have and\n\n773\n00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:58,750\nhow big they can be when\nthey're in the root.\n\n774\n00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:02,478\nIf you put it in a subfolder,\nthen those limits don't apply.\n\n775\n00:40:02,478 --> 00:40:07,710\nSo, I'm gonna put it in the sub folder and\nI will just call this one Drive 1.\n\n776\n00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,970\nSo it's gonna create it.\n\n777\n00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:12,640\nAnd I'll make it seven gigs just\nlike the ones that I did earlier.\n\n778\n00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,120\nI could go even bigger.\n\n779\n00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:18,690\nWhen I make these disks you've\ngot the option to do fixed size.\n\n780\n00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:22,910\nSo if I say it's gonna be 36 gigs,\nit'll make it 36 gigs right now.\n\n781\n00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,630\nOr I can go dynamic, and\n\n782\n00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:29,530\nwith dynamic, as I copy data in to\nthe drive, the file will grow to match it.\n\n783\n00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:32,870\nSo it only consumes the space\nthat we're actually using.\n\n784\n00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:34,300\nAnd that's what I'm gonna do right here.\n\n785\n00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,535\nSo, I'm gonna create that, and\nthen I'll create another one.\n\n786\n00:40:38,635 --> 00:40:39,610\nI'll create another VHD.\n\n787\n00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:44,160\nIn that same location,\nI'll call this one Drive 2.\n\n788\n00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,910\nAnd.\n\n789\n00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,110\nYou know, Ronnie, I already forgot.\n\n790\n00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:46,910\nDid I do 36 gigs?\n\n791\n00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:47,410\n>> You did.\n\n792\n00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,340\n>> All right.\n\n793\n00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,420\nAnd then I'll do a third one for\nthat drive three.\n\n794\n00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:54,940\n>> I don't think you.\n\n795\n00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:58,640\n>> What did it do?\n\n796\n00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,820\nOh, I chose fixed!\n\n797\n00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,900\nShoot!\n\n798\n00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:04,980\nWhen you choose fixed it actually has to\nallocate out the 36 gigs, and that's what\n\n799\n00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,870\nit's doing right now, so my system is\nkind of paused while it's doing it.\n\n800\n00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:12,150\nAnd the larger the disc you create\nthe longer that'll take, to finish.\n\n801\n00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:14,990\nThat's a mistake, I'm going to run\nout of hard drive space on my laptop.\n\n802\n00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:19,842\nI'll just do one more here,\nwhich will be Drive 3.\n\n803\n00:41:19,842 --> 00:41:22,547\n>> I don't know if you\nactually have room to do that.\n\n804\n00:41:22,547 --> 00:41:25,390\n>> This time,\nI won't make my same mistake twice.\n\n805\n00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:31,110\nThat's the sign of a good learner right\nthere, don't make the same mistake twice.\n\n806\n00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,440\nI just added three new hard drives.\n\n807\n00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,830\nAnd if you look right\nhere in disk management,\n\n808\n00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:38,740\nthey show up as three hard drives,\nand I can format those right.\n\n809\n00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,260\nIn fact,\nit's probably asking me to format.\n\n810\n00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,970\nOh no, oh that's my E drive.\n\n811\n00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:45,570\nSo yeah, I can go through and\nstart to format these and get them ready.\n\n812\n00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:48,780\nThey're not initialized, so\nI do need to initialize them first.\n\n813\n00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,610\nSo I'll just right-click on the disk and\nchoose initialize.\n\n814\n00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,870\nAnd there we go,\nit's got all three of them.\n\n815\n00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:55,570\nWe'll just knock them all out.\n\n816\n00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:58,710\nAnd then once they're done,\nnow I can go through and\n\n817\n00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:01,580\nI can create my volumes on them, right?\n\n818\n00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:04,710\nSo I'll create a 36 gig\nvolume on this one.\n\n819\n00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:06,360\nAnd this is Drive 1.\n\n820\n00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:06,860\nAll right.\n\n821\n00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,480\nAnd then I can create a 36 gig\nvolume on this one and so on.\n\n822\n00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,090\nYou just kinda keep going down the line.\n\n823\n00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:18,220\nNow, when you set them up like this, I can\ncreate as many of these VHDs as I want.\n\n824\n00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,770\nBecause they're not partitions,\nI don't have those limits.\n\n825\n00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:24,670\nSo I'm still a basic disk\nbecause these are virtual files.\n\n826\n00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:27,980\nAnd if I browse on the hard drive, right?\n\n827\n00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:32,940\nI can brows to my E drive where\nI'm sticking all of these, and\n\n828\n00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:38,390\non my E drive, there's that VHDs folder\nand here's Drive 1, Drive 2, and Drive 3.\n\n829\n00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:41,625\nAnd see how Drive 1 and\nDrive 3 are very, very small, but\n\n830\n00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:42,885\nDrive 2 is already 36 gigs.\n\n831\n00:42:42,885 --> 00:42:46,693\nAnd that's because I chose a fixed size\non that one, so it laid it all out.\n\n832\n00:42:46,693 --> 00:42:51,505\nAll right, actually, again going a little\nbit beyond the exam objectives we\n\n833\n00:42:51,505 --> 00:42:53,100\ncould have some real fun here.\n\n834\n00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,680\nI'm going to convert these.\n\n835\n00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,460\nOh, will it not let you\nconvert those to dynamic?\n\n836\n00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,330\nDagummit.\n\n837\n00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:01,129\nI was going to try and\ncreate a mirror or whatever off of the.\n\n838\n00:43:01,129 --> 00:43:02,886\nYeah, it won't let me\nconvert it to dynamic,\n\n839\n00:43:02,886 --> 00:43:04,970\nso that's not gonna get us very far.\n\n840\n00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:07,350\nBut, yeah, we can go through and\npartition these.\n\n841\n00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:08,970\nUse them however you want.\n\n842\n00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:12,800\nThe nice thing about a VHD file,\nall the contents of that drive,\n\n843\n00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,700\nso anything that I put in\nmy F drive is Drive 1.\n\n844\n00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:22,080\nAnd if I go to my E drive and\ninto VHDs, there's Drive 1.\n\n845\n00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,800\nSo anything I put on my E drive\nis going in that one file.\n\n846\n00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,350\nAnd if I ever wanna move that to another\ncomputer, I just copy that VHD file.\n\n847\n00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:33,950\nI copy that file to a new machine,\nand over there I can attach it.\n\n848\n00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:36,840\nYou guys probably saw that option\nback here when we right-clicked\n\n849\n00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,800\non disk management,\nI could choose attach a VHD.\n\n850\n00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,130\nSo now it's a virtual hard drive that's\nsuper easy to move between systems.\n\n851\n00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:44,650\nIt's a neat technology.\n\n852\n00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:46,320\nIt's kind of a niche purpose though.\n\n853\n00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,730\nMost people aren't gonna use these.\n\n854\n00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:49,900\nBut, for like us, Ronnie you and I?\n\n855\n00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,710\nWe use them all the time\nbecause of our lab stuff.\n\n856\n00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,730\nSo neat resources that are out there.\n\n857\n00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:58,160\nSomething we need to keep in mind\nwith any type of storage we add.\n\n858\n00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,124\nAnd I know this section is built\naround external storage, but\n\n859\n00:44:01,124 --> 00:44:02,895\nit applies to internal storage too.\n\n860\n00:44:04,381 --> 00:44:06,660\nAll right,\nwhat else do we have on storage?\n\n861\n00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,790\n>> I think we have cloud storage next.\n\n862\n00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:11,010\n>> You know, Ronnie, let's see.\n\n863\n00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:11,950\nLet's do this.\n\n864\n00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:14,360\nWe've only got a few minutes\nleft in this segment so\n\n865\n00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,400\nwhy don't we stop and take a break.\n\n866\n00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:19,350\nWhen we get back we're gonna talk\nabout cloud storage which helps to\n\n867\n00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:23,450\neliminate our computer as a point\nof failure in our data solutions.\n\n868\n00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:26,660\nSo definitely an important thing\nwe're seeing more of lately.\n\n869\n00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:29,096\nStay tuned,\nwe'll be back in just a moment.\n\n870\n00:44:29,096 --> 00:44:35,981\n[MUSIC]\n\n871\n00:44:35,981 --> 00:44:38,610\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n872\n00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:41,680\nAnother type of storage you're going to\nhear about a lot today is not actually\n\n873\n00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,260\nan external device at all.\n\n874\n00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,950\nIt's not a device, period.\n\n875\n00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:49,700\nIt's cloud storage,\nwhere you rely on somebody else,\n\n876\n00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:54,190\nsome company that has servers that\nmay be thousands of miles away,\n\n877\n00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:57,200\nvia the internet,\nto be able to store your data.\n\n878\n00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:02,110\nAnd on a positive side, no matter where\nyou are, you can always access your files.\n\n879\n00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:04,130\nIf I have a hard drive\non my computer at home,\n\n880\n00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:06,180\nI can usually only get\nto it when I'm at home.\n\n881\n00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:08,720\nBut if it's in the cloud,\nif it's on the internet.\n\n882\n00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,260\nI can go anywhere I want, and\nI'll still have access to my files.\n\n883\n00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:16,400\nSo if my house burns down or gets\ndestroyed or whatever, my files are safe.\n\n884\n00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,550\nLike that's the positive\nside of cloud storage.\n\n885\n00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,430\n>> Another positive side of\ncloud storage today is that\n\n886\n00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:26,140\neven though you're gonna connect it to\nyour machine, it really doesn't look\n\n887\n00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:30,240\na lot different than just actually\nopening up your explorer and\n\n888\n00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,800\nbeing able to find that storage\ndevice with the software.\n\n889\n00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,140\nSo at one point it might have\nseemed super complicated.\n\n890\n00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:38,940\nLike, I don't wanna have to connect\nall the way out to the Internet and\n\n891\n00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:41,380\nconnect to a company and\nfigure out how they're gonna connect.\n\n892\n00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:42,390\nToday they've made it so\n\n893\n00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:45,790\neasy that it really does just look\nlike another device right there, and\n\n894\n00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:49,510\nyou easily connect to it just like\nit's right there on your hard drive.\n\n895\n00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:51,230\n>> And now there is a negative side, and\n\n896\n00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:56,100\nthe negative side of cloud storage is\nthat you are trusting another company.\n\n897\n00:45:56,100 --> 00:46:01,660\nYou're saying, I trust that company\nto hold my data and keep it private.\n\n898\n00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:03,840\nIf someone were to break\ninto their system,\n\n899\n00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,600\nthey could get access to your files.\n\n900\n00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:09,530\nAnd that's a big amount of trust that\nyou've got to give to a company.\n\n901\n00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:12,930\nSo, as long as you're okay with that,\nand you're legally allowed, right?\n\n902\n00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:15,510\nIf you're a hospital you can't\nstore medical records like this.\n\n903\n00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:19,290\nBut if you're allowed,\nthen it's a great service to use.\n\n904\n00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:22,330\nMicrosoft has a service called OneDrive,\nand\n\n905\n00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:25,545\nit is a cloud storage service\nthat's made available to everybody.\n\n906\n00:46:25,545 --> 00:46:31,890\nAnd, quick little footnote, when the exam\nwas written for the '98 SP49, it\n\n907\n00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:36,798\nwas called SkyDrive and Microsoft recently\nrebranded it and now it's called OneDrive.\n\n908\n00:46:36,798 --> 00:46:39,790\nSo, in real-life land,\nyou'll see OneDrive everywhere, but\n\n909\n00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:44,140\non the exam it's still called SkyDrive,\nso just be aware of that name change.\n\n910\n00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:46,160\nBut the service itself works identically.\n\n911\n00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,350\nLet me show you here as an example.\n\n912\n00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:51,321\nSo here I am on this Windows 7 machine\nthat I've been using all throughout\n\n913\n00:46:51,321 --> 00:46:51,830\nthis show.\n\n914\n00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:54,700\nAnd it's not anything special.\n\n915\n00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,520\nI don't have any crazy data on here.\n\n916\n00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,370\nSo, if this is a brand new machine and\nI want my data, well,\n\n917\n00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:02,280\nas long as it's in the OneDrive, I'm fine.\n\n918\n00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:06,030\nSo I can fire up the One Drive\nwebsite right here which is\n\n919\n00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:08,990\njust onedrive.live.com.\n\n920\n00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:12,770\nAnd here are all the files\nthat I've got in that system.\n\n921\n00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:15,610\nSo I can see some show notes\nthat I used awhile back.\n\n922\n00:47:15,610 --> 00:47:18,440\nI've got our ITPROTV wallpaper.\n\n923\n00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:22,070\nAnd I've even got a little picture of\na horse that I drew in an episode.\n\n924\n00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:23,570\nI'm a terrible, terrible artist.\n\n925\n00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:25,590\nSo we can see all these different things.\n\n926\n00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:26,500\nThese are my files.\n\n927\n00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:30,719\nSo if I want to get ready for\nthis 7680 hardware and apps episode,\n\n928\n00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:35,154\nI can pull up my notes, and even though\nI didn't have my note right here on\n\n929\n00:47:35,154 --> 00:47:38,830\nmy computer, now I can get at\nit because it's in the cloud.\n\n930\n00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:41,300\nI have that access.\n\n931\n00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,590\nNow, you might ask yourself,\nwait a minute Don.\n\n932\n00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:46,340\nI don't want to have to go to a web\npage every time I want to access a file.\n\n933\n00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:48,200\nThat's not really ideal.\n\n934\n00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,280\nMost of the cloud services that are out\nthere allow you to run a little\n\n935\n00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,100\napplication on your computer.\n\n936\n00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:56,090\nAnd it lets you download\nall the files locally.\n\n937\n00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:59,770\nAnd any time you change them it\nsynchronizes them up online.\n\n938\n00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:03,400\nAnd so you're normally going to want that,\nand if I go back to my main OneDrive page.\n\n939\n00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,630\nThat's not what I wanted.\n\n940\n00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:05,630\nBack here.\n\n941\n00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:09,390\nYou'll notice way down here it's\ngot this get OneDrive apps link.\n\n942\n00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:12,920\nAnd that's where I can go to\ninstall the little application\n\n943\n00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,200\nthat's going to let us\ndo that synchronization.\n\n944\n00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,340\nAnd it's just real simple.\n\n945\n00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:18,390\nThey've got the little\nclient we can install.\n\n946\n00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:21,060\nIn Windows 8 it actually has\nthe client built into it so\n\n947\n00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:23,550\nI'm not quite sure why they\nmention it down in there but\n\n948\n00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:28,130\nI'm just going to run that installer and\nwhen we go to install it.\n\n949\n00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:32,730\nWell, there's my administrative prompt,\ndo that.\n\n950\n00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:33,960\nIt's going to install.\n\n951\n00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,200\nAnd it'll attach to my Microsoft account.\n\n952\n00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:40,930\nAnd it'll synchronize my files for\nme so I don't have to do that.\n\n953\n00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:42,980\nAnd now I don't even have to\ngo to the webpage anymore.\n\n954\n00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:46,770\nSo I just got this new laptop,\nI install this client, and\n\n955\n00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:48,710\nnow all my files will be right here.\n\n956\n00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:49,480\nAll my data.\n\n957\n00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,400\nIt makes it real easy to\nswitch between computers.\n\n958\n00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,060\nAnd if I lose this computer, big deal.\n\n959\n00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,560\nAll my data was being\nsynchronized up to the cloud, and\n\n960\n00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,010\nmy data is still there waiting for me.\n\n961\n00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:01,200\nThat's what cloud storage is all about.\n\n962\n00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,820\n>> It makes is so easy because it means\nthe carrying around of these external\n\n963\n00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:09,610\ndrives, you can kind of just\nabout eliminate all of that.\n\n964\n00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:12,820\nUnless we need really massive storage,\nlike terabytes of storage.\n\n965\n00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:16,090\nBut we can even get around that by\npaying just a little bit more money.\n\n966\n00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:19,460\nIt normally is a monthly subscription\nthat you might end up paying for\n\n967\n00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,970\nhow much storage you're\ngoing to end up using.\n\n968\n00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:25,270\n>> And, you know Microsoft isn't\nthe only vendor in this space.\n\n969\n00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:27,280\nI'm trying to get logged\nin here on the background.\n\n970\n00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:32,670\nThere's other people like Dropbox,\nGoogle Drive, Amazon Cloud Drive.\n\n971\n00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:35,960\nApple iCloud, or idrive,\nor whatever they call it.\n\n972\n00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,640\nThere's a ton of different\nones that are out there.\n\n973\n00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:42,390\nIt's just kind of picking the one that\nyou trust and are willing to use.\n\n974\n00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:45,900\nA lot of us don't necessarily\ntrust one company versus another.\n\n975\n00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,070\nYou got to make sure you\nfind one that works for you.\n\n976\n00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:55,204\nNow, another thing I wanted to mention,\nwhen I went to the OneDrive website,\n\n977\n00:49:55,204 --> 00:50:01,220\nyou might have noticed it said\nOnedrive.live.com, not microsoft.com.\n\n978\n00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:04,380\nSo what is live.com?\n\n979\n00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,035\nRight?\nWhat is that?\n\n980\n00:50:06,035 --> 00:50:11,360\n>> Live.com is Microsoft's way\nof creating single account\n\n981\n00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:16,211\nthat then you can use those credentials to\nbe able to access all the surfaces that\n\n982\n00:50:16,211 --> 00:50:19,620\nthey want you to be able to access without\nyou having to create another user account\n\n983\n00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:22,680\nhere, another user account there,\nanother user account.\n\n984\n00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,800\nAnd it used to just be called live.com and\n\n985\n00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,130\nthen they started rebranding\nthis stuff again.\n\n986\n00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:29,650\nAnd they've now changed it.\n\n987\n00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:32,640\nToday, what you're going\nto see in reality.\n\n988\n00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,280\nIs what we call just\nthe Microsoft account.\n\n989\n00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:40,400\nSo with a single Microsoft account I can\ncreate the one drive, just like Don did.\n\n990\n00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,330\nI can go back and actually even use\nanother product called like Office 365.\n\n991\n00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:48,360\nI can go and access everything\nthat I have with Microsoft.\n\n992\n00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,750\nAnd today, with newer operating systems,\n\n993\n00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:54,690\nit even allows me to take my entire\ndesktop from one computer to another.\n\n994\n00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:59,010\nJust because of the way that Windows\n8.1 works with that Microsoft account.\n\n995\n00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:03,710\n>> Now when this first came out,\na lot of applications had to be\n\n996\n00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:06,810\nupdated to give them support\nto reach out to SkyDrive.\n\n997\n00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:07,840\nNow OneDrive.\n\n998\n00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,000\nAnd work with the files.\n\n999\n00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,620\nSo you saw things like Microsoft OneNote\nhas this special cloud integration and\n\n1000\n00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:14,670\nit could tie into OneDrive.\n\n1001\n00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:16,920\nWell now we don't have\nto worry about that.\n\n1002\n00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:20,760\nOnce we have the application\ninstalled on our computer, our drive,\n\n1003\n00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,910\nour one drive is being replicated\nright down here to our system.\n\n1004\n00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:27,280\nSo now we just use programs like normal,\nlet me show you what I mean.\n\n1005\n00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,900\nSo I just finished installing that client.\n\n1006\n00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:33,050\nI just had to log in and hit next a few\ntimes, so that client is installed.\n\n1007\n00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:35,490\nI'm going to just\nminimize the web browser.\n\n1008\n00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:39,890\nWhen I browse on my computer,\nhere's my favorites and my desktop.\n\n1009\n00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:42,960\nAnd notice how it's added\none drive right there.\n\n1010\n00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,990\nAnd here's all the stuff in my one drive.\n\n1011\n00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:47,510\nSee the little check mark by these things?\n\n1012\n00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:51,360\nThat green check mark lets me know\nthat that file has been uploaded and\n\n1013\n00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:55,230\nsynchronized with the OneDrive website,\nall right?\n\n1014\n00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:56,670\nIf I were to edit that, right?\n\n1015\n00:51:56,670 --> 00:52:00,010\nSo I'll take my little pony picture here,\nand\n\n1016\n00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:04,940\nI probably shouldn't edit this\nbecause it's a masterpiece in itself.\n\n1017\n00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:06,780\nBut sometimes we can make improvements,\n\n1018\n00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:09,800\nso I notice the pony is kind\nof standing in the air here.\n\n1019\n00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,170\nSo I'm just going to add some grass,\nright?\n\n1020\n00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,570\nSo we'll add that in there.\n\n1021\n00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:16,220\nThis picture gets more\nawesome every time I open it.\n\n1022\n00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:17,100\nAnd I'll go ahead and save it.\n\n1023\n00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,670\nSo I just made a change and\n\n1024\n00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:22,700\nin the background the pony,it\nkind of happened fast I guess.\n\n1025\n00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:23,270\nThere it goes.\n\n1026\n00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:25,755\nIt turned into little blue\nswirling arrows for a second.\n\n1027\n00:52:25,755 --> 00:52:27,305\nAnd then it went right back green.\n\n1028\n00:52:27,305 --> 00:52:29,575\nIt just synchronized it up to the website.\n\n1029\n00:52:29,575 --> 00:52:31,545\nSo I just work with the files right here.\n\n1030\n00:52:31,545 --> 00:52:33,815\nI don't need any crazy cloud integration.\n\n1031\n00:52:33,815 --> 00:52:37,365\nAnd this is part of my user profiles\nright here on the hard drive.\n\n1032\n00:52:37,365 --> 00:52:40,360\nIf I browse on my hard drive and\nif I go to my C drive,\n\n1033\n00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:45,240\nand I go into users,\nand I go into Jane Doe.\n\n1034\n00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,090\nI'm logged in as Jane today.\n\n1035\n00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:51,360\nInside of Jane there is that folder\none drive, and there is the file.\n\n1036\n00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:54,510\nSo your software programs\ndon't have to change.\n\n1037\n00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:58,240\nThey can keep using the software the way\nthey've used it ever since Windows was\n\n1038\n00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,320\noriginally developed and one drive\nsynchronizes it in the background.\n\n1039\n00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,680\nSo real easy to implement.\n\n1040\n00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,370\nThis is not an external device per say.\n\n1041\n00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:07,400\nBut another way to add\nstorage to our system.\n\n1042\n00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:12,270\n>> A lot of the newer programs that you\nmay end up seeing on the computers will\n\n1043\n00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:17,360\njust go ahead and directly link to one\ndrive because they've got it all set up.\n\n1044\n00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,940\nSo when you actually do a file save,\nusually the default to date,\n\n1045\n00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:24,340\nif you're running Windows 8.1 is that\nit automatically wants you to save\n\n1046\n00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:26,100\nit to the one drive instead.\n\n1047\n00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,120\nYou can always change it to\nsave it to your local computer.\n\n1048\n00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:32,570\nBut you're going to see that more and\nmore because it is about convenience.\n\n1049\n00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:35,180\nIt does allow you to actually\nbe incredibly mobile and\n\n1050\n00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:38,670\nstill keep all of your same files\nwherever you actually end up going.\n\n1051\n00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:40,490\nSo that's why it's actually\nbeing pushed very hard.\n\n1052\n00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:45,200\n>> All right, well Ronnie I think we\nhave driven storage into the ground\n\n1053\n00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:45,775\nat this point.\n\n1054\n00:53:45,775 --> 00:53:48,420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Remember that external devices aren't\n\n1055\n00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:49,780\nnecessarily storage.\n\n1056\n00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:51,120\nThere's plenty of other things.\n\n1057\n00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,480\nKeyboard and mouse come to mind.\n\n1058\n00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,240\nRight?\nThose are common devices that we attach.\n\n1059\n00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:58,240\nBut there's other things\ntoo like printers.\n\n1060\n00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,840\nSo let's talk about printers a little bit.\n\n1061\n00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,662\nIf you want to add a printer to\nyour computer it's going to have to\n\n1062\n00:54:03,662 --> 00:54:04,300\nbe external.\n\n1063\n00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:05,000\nRight?\nI don't think I've\n\n1064\n00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,950\never seen a computer that\nhad a printer internal.\n\n1065\n00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:08,350\nThat would be kind of interesting.\n\n1066\n00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:10,240\nBut it's normally external, and\n\n1067\n00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:15,100\nwhen we go to buy it almost\nevery printer today is USB.\n\n1068\n00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:18,290\nUSB is pretty much the given standard for\nprinters.\n\n1069\n00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:21,510\nThere are I'm sure some that are out\nthere that are FireWire, but\n\n1070\n00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:23,780\nit's definitely a pretty rare thing.\n\n1071\n00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:27,510\nI'm sure there's some that still use\nthe old style parallel port cables, but\n\n1072\n00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:30,530\nagain that should be a pretty\nrare thing by today's standards.\n\n1073\n00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:31,880\nSo the majority of them are USB.\n\n1074\n00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:36,040\nIf you have a computer and you want to\nbe able to print to it, you take that\n\n1075\n00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:40,800\nprinter, you plug it into the USB port,\nand your computer will see it, right?\n\n1076\n00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,370\nNow, USB gives us a lot of power.\n\n1077\n00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:46,340\nWe can communicate a lot\nof different ways over USB.\n\n1078\n00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:49,030\nAnd so more and more we're\nstarting to see printers that are,\n\n1079\n00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:52,450\nwhat are called multi-function printers,\nor MFP's.\n\n1080\n00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:58,740\nAnd they will combine a printer\nwith a scanner with a copier.\n\n1081\n00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:01,320\nThe stuff we need in\nan office environment.\n\n1082\n00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:04,150\nThe old parallel port connections,\nthey couldn't handle that.\n\n1083\n00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:05,440\nBut USB can.\n\n1084\n00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,650\nSo these all in one devices\nare becoming pretty common too and\n\n1085\n00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:13,390\nI've got Newegg's page on\nprinters pulled up here.\n\n1086\n00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:15,960\nAnd so\nyou will still see printers like this one\n\n1087\n00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,700\nwhere its just a printer that's all it is.\n\n1088\n00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:23,270\nBut you'll also find ones\nthat are office printers.\n\n1089\n00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:27,130\nThat's a strange looking\nprinter right there, Ronnie.\n\n1090\n00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:28,760\n>> That's a muli-functioning one there.\n\n1091\n00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,490\n>> It certainly is.\n\n1092\n00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:32,750\nNormally they at least try and\nmake them look nice.\n\n1093\n00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:37,210\nThat one kind of looks crappy,\nfor lack of a better term.\n\n1094\n00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:39,460\nI think that's our\ntechnical term right there.\n\n1095\n00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:43,710\nBut yeah, so these are ones that have\nmultiple functions built into them.\n\n1096\n00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:49,070\nSo it'll be a scanner, a fax machine,\na copier all rolled into one device.\n\n1097\n00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:52,680\nIt looks a lot different\nnow that I click on it.\n\n1098\n00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:53,565\nWell whatever, so\n\n1099\n00:55:53,565 --> 00:55:58,285\nit's just a great example of that and the\nprices are not that terribly expensive.\n\n1100\n00:55:58,285 --> 00:56:00,355\nYou see a full price that\nis almost two hundred.\n\n1101\n00:56:00,355 --> 00:56:01,685\nIt's on sale right now.\n\n1102\n00:56:01,685 --> 00:56:03,655\nSo printer prices have\ncome down a lot more.\n\n1103\n00:56:03,655 --> 00:56:06,254\nBut these will typically be USB and\nif I pull up the,\n\n1104\n00:56:06,254 --> 00:56:09,475\nlet's see if I can pull up\nthe text specs on this one.\n\n1105\n00:56:09,475 --> 00:56:12,265\nUSB might be it's only\nform of connectivity and\n\n1106\n00:56:12,265 --> 00:56:14,125\nthat will connect it to your machine.\n\n1107\n00:56:14,125 --> 00:56:17,670\nNow if you're the only person using\nthat printer, then that's great.\n\n1108\n00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:20,670\nYou just plug right in via USB and\nyou're done, right?\n\n1109\n00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:24,250\nIf you want other people\nto use the printer too,\n\n1110\n00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:27,410\nwe could share it out like we\ndid in the earlier episode.\n\n1111\n00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:29,380\nI think it was in the file and\nfolder episode.\n\n1112\n00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:32,130\nWhere we shared a printer out so\nother people can access it.\n\n1113\n00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:36,120\nBut the problem is what happens\nif you turn your computer off?\n\n1114\n00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,750\nIf the printer's attached to you and\nyou turn it off.\n\n1115\n00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:41,460\n>> Yeah,\nyou don't actually get any connection.\n\n1116\n00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:43,680\nSo if you have that printer attached,\n\n1117\n00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,540\nyou turn it off nobody else\nis going to be able to print.\n\n1118\n00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:50,960\nSo there are other types of printers\nout there that will allow you to\n\n1119\n00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,965\ndirectly attach it to a network\nconnection and it stands alone.\n\n1120\n00:56:54,965 --> 00:56:59,240\nThere's a little very small,\nvery low powered mini computer\n\n1121\n00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:03,015\nthat then can accept print jobs\neven from across a network.\n\n1122\n00:57:03,015 --> 00:57:05,570\n>> Yeah, and on this printer I was\nlooking through the tech specs and\n\n1123\n00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:08,170\nI just found it where it list the ports.\n\n1124\n00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:12,962\nIt's got a USB 2.0 port so\nit can plug right into your machine and\n\n1125\n00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:14,880\nit's got wireless.\n\n1126\n00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:15,982\nIt's got a Wi-Fi card in there.\n\n1127\n00:57:15,982 --> 00:57:19,165\nIt can connect to an 802.11b,\ng, or n network.\n\n1128\n00:57:19,165 --> 00:57:21,245\nSo if you've got a wireless\nnetwork in your building or\n\n1129\n00:57:21,245 --> 00:57:23,255\nat home, it'll connect to that.\n\n1130\n00:57:23,255 --> 00:57:27,495\nAnd now, as long as the printer is\nturned on, everybody can get to it.\n\n1131\n00:57:27,495 --> 00:57:30,190\nIt's no longer dependent\non a single computer.\n\n1132\n00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:32,610\nMore and\nmore printers are going this route.\n\n1133\n00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:35,180\nYou might see wireless, or\nit might even be wired.\n\n1134\n00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:37,910\nIt might have a physical network jack\non the back that you can plug into.\n\n1135\n00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:41,890\nSo when you purchase a printer,\nif you can, in today's world,\n\n1136\n00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:44,540\nyou should go ahead and\nget a network-enabled printer.\n\n1137\n00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:48,730\nIf you can't, the really cheap ones,\nthey just plug right into your machine and\n\n1138\n00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:51,270\nif you're the only person using it,\nthat's perfectly fine, right?\n\n1139\n00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:52,550\nThat will work for you.\n\n1140\n00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:53,900\nBut if you want to share it,\n\n1141\n00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:58,040\nyou're always better off doing\na network attached printer, all right.\n\n1142\n00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:02,710\nNow when it's a direct attached printer,\nyou plug that cable into your computer and\n\n1143\n00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:05,150\nthe computer will see it,\ndetect it and add it.\n\n1144\n00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:08,150\nSo, locally attached printers\nare really easy to add.\n\n1145\n00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:12,270\nBut a network printer, your computer\nwon't automatically find that.\n\n1146\n00:58:12,270 --> 00:58:15,390\nSo, if you wanna use a network printer,\nhow do we get those connected?\n\n1147\n00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:17,840\nWell there is two different ways to do it,\nall right.\n\n1148\n00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:21,900\nThe first way is we can try and\nbrowse the network and find it, all right.\n\n1149\n00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:25,290\nWe go into our Windows Explorer,\nso I'll just bring that up, and\n\n1150\n00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:30,920\nyou go to network, and under network\nit's gonna browse the network and\n\n1151\n00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,530\nshow me devices that it finds, all right?\n\n1152\n00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:36,990\nMaybe it finds my printer, all right?\n\n1153\n00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:40,020\nA lot of printers these days will\nautomatically advertise themselves.\n\n1154\n00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,420\nSo you might see Canon M6220.\n\n1155\n00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:45,258\nAnd it'll show up and\nyou can click on it and print to it.\n\n1156\n00:58:45,258 --> 00:58:47,295\nRight?\nIt's easy as that.\n\n1157\n00:58:47,295 --> 00:58:50,685\nBut if it doesn't show up,\nyou've got to manually add it.\n\n1158\n00:58:50,685 --> 00:58:53,375\nAnd when you add it,\nyou go to Add a Printer, up here.\n\n1159\n00:58:54,805 --> 00:58:58,890\nAnd when you choose to add it, you can\nchoose to add a network wireless or\n\n1160\n00:58:58,890 --> 00:58:59,630\nBluetooth printer.\n\n1161\n00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:01,320\nYou can choose that option.\n\n1162\n00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,940\nAnd it's going to try and\nscan and find one.\n\n1163\n00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:07,220\nAnd here it found one that\ndidn't show up a minute ago.\n\n1164\n00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:10,880\nOr, we can say the printer\nthat I wanted isn't listed and\n\n1165\n00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,310\nwe can manually add it here.\n\n1166\n00:59:12,310 --> 00:59:15,100\nSo I'm going to say that it isn't listed.\n\n1167\n00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:19,160\nAnd now you can put it in based on\na network name, if it has one, or\n\n1168\n00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:22,240\nmore commonly, the IP address.\n\n1169\n00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:25,125\nWhen you get a brand new printer and\nyou plug it into your network,\n\n1170\n00:59:25,125 --> 00:59:28,680\nit'll usually displays the IP\naddress on its screen.\n\n1171\n00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,500\nAnd you could come here and\nsay I'll add it by IP.\n\n1172\n00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:35,010\nAnd on the next page,\nyou can punch in that IP address.\n\n1173\n00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:38,040\nAnd so, you can just punch that in.\n\n1174\n00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:39,740\nI think that's one on our network.\n\n1175\n00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:41,580\nWe'll find out.\n>> 23 I think.\n\n1176\n00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:44,130\n>> Is it 23?\nSee, that's going to stop things.\n\n1177\n00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:45,030\nLet me cancel that.\n\n1178\n00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:46,508\nOh, it's going to make\nme start all over again.\n\n1179\n00:59:46,508 --> 00:59:48,640\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's unfortunate.\n\n1180\n00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,200\nAnd let's just turn that off.\n\n1181\n00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,690\nAll right, let's try this again.\n\n1182\n00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:54,140\nSo I put in the wrong IP address,\nthat didn't help.\n\n1183\n00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:56,520\nSo I'll go back in here and\nwe'll try it again.\n\n1184\n00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:59,270\nSo I'm gonna punch in a network printer\nthat I know we have here in the office\n\n1185\n00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:01,020\nthat it didn't see just a second ago.\n\n1186\n01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:07,320\nBut if I punch it in by its IP address,\nthen I can go forward and there it is.\n\n1187\n01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:08,520\nIt found it.\n\n1188\n01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,330\nBut it doesn't know what driver to use.\n\n1189\n01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:13,170\nWhen it's a network printer it may or\nmay not be able to figure out the driver,\n\n1190\n01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:17,880\nso I'll have to pick something, and I'm\npretty sure this driver isn't in here, but\n\n1191\n01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,720\nI'll just pick a random\none that will work.\n\n1192\n01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,253\nIt's what, a 70.65?\n\n1193\n01:00:22,253 --> 01:00:23,470\n>> Yeah, 70.65.\n\n1194\n01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:29,560\n>> I want to say the 5000 driver works\ntoo, so we'll just try that one.\n\n1195\n01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,390\nSo I'm just gonna pick this one.\n\n1196\n01:00:31,390 --> 01:00:33,020\nAnd we'll install it.\n\n1197\n01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:36,390\nNow I've got that printer available and\nI am not gonna share it.\n\n1198\n01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:37,910\nThere is no need in me sharing it.\n\n1199\n01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:39,900\nNow people shouldn't connect\nto me to get to the printer,\n\n1200\n01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:41,680\nthey should connect\ndirectly to the printer.\n\n1201\n01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:46,260\nSo this time I am going to say don't\nshare it and now I'll have that printer.\n\n1202\n01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:47,780\nI could print a test page if I want.\n\n1203\n01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:50,250\nI am not going to do that,\nin case I'm using the wrong driver.\n\n1204\n01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:52,490\nBut now I'll have a printer.\n\n1205\n01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:56,280\nAnd when I pull up my Start Menu,\nand I go to Devices and Printers,\n\n1206\n01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:02,110\nI should see, right there.\n\n1207\n01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:06,050\nCannon IR50555065, that's the printer\nthat I added just a moment ago.\n\n1208\n01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,830\nAll right, so\ngetting a printer added, pretty easy.\n\n1209\n01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:12,030\nLocal versus network.\n\n1210\n01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:15,260\nPretty simple stuff there.\n\n1211\n01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:17,510\nThere's a few other things we need\nto be aware of with printers.\n\n1212\n01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:18,688\nRight Ronnie?\n\n1213\n01:01:18,688 --> 01:01:19,920\n>> Yep.\nWhen we're using something like\n\n1214\n01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:22,510\nthe network printer,\nit could be that multiple people\n\n1215\n01:01:22,510 --> 01:01:26,130\nare going to connect to that printer so\nthat they can print.\n\n1216\n01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:27,305\nAnd to be able to do that,\n\n1217\n01:01:27,305 --> 01:01:29,950\nthen that printer has to be able\nto manage those print jobs.\n\n1218\n01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:33,940\nAnd what it does is it lines those print\njobs up into what we call a printer queue.\n\n1219\n01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:37,230\nThat way, somebody else managing\nthe printer can pause a print job\n\n1220\n01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:40,620\nif they need to or\neven cancel a print job if they need to.\n\n1221\n01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:44,270\nAnd we can easily see that printer\nqueue by going into the printers and\n\n1222\n01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:46,610\nbeing able to pull up its properties.\n\n1223\n01:01:46,610 --> 01:01:47,780\n>> Yeah.\nSo, I'm kinda\n\n1224\n01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:50,400\nalready on the right screen here,\nbut let's start from scratch here.\n\n1225\n01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:54,260\nI'll take this machine and\nI'm just gonna go to Start and Devices and\n\n1226\n01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:56,950\nPrinters and I'll see my various printers.\n\n1227\n01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:58,780\nAnd if you just double click\non any of them, right, so\n\n1228\n01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:00,670\nI'll take this one that I just added.\n\n1229\n01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:03,480\nIf I double click on it,\nit's going to show me some\n\n1230\n01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:06,860\nbasic information right here and\nI can see the print queue.\n\n1231\n01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:09,340\nThere's zero documents\nin the queue right now.\n\n1232\n01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:10,790\nAnd the printer is ready.\n\n1233\n01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:12,395\nI can see it.\n\n1234\n01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,500\nRight?\nIf I click\n\n1235\n01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:16,640\non the queue it gives me this screen, and\nI can see the documents that I'm printing.\n\n1236\n01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:20,080\nNow, it's empty right now,\nbecause I'm not printing anything.\n\n1237\n01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,595\nRight?\nSo let's print something,\n\n1238\n01:02:21,595 --> 01:02:23,150\nlet's have some fun.\n\n1239\n01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:27,322\nThis printer's in another\nroom here in the office, and\n\n1240\n01:02:27,322 --> 01:02:32,310\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm going to,\njust, this is a test, right?\n\n1241\n01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:36,275\nLet's see how big we can make this font.\n\n1242\n01:02:36,275 --> 01:02:43,465\n[LAUGH] We'll see how much data I can get\non to one page without going too crazy.\n\n1243\n01:02:44,995 --> 01:02:45,965\nThere we go.\n\n1244\n01:02:45,965 --> 01:02:47,165\nSo this is a test.\n\n1245\n01:02:47,165 --> 01:02:50,055\nThis is what I'm going to print out,\nright?\n\n1246\n01:02:50,055 --> 01:02:52,735\nAnd keep your eye on the queue over here.\n\n1247\n01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:53,405\nOkay?\n\n1248\n01:02:53,405 --> 01:03:00,325\nIf I go to my little file menu here and\nprint, it'll let me pick the printer.\n\n1249\n01:03:00,325 --> 01:03:03,990\nAnd I'm going to pick that\n5055 printer that I added.\n\n1250\n01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:06,020\nAnd I'm gonna hit Print and there it goes.\n\n1251\n01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:07,995\nSee it just appeared and\nthen it disappeared.\n\n1252\n01:03:07,995 --> 01:03:08,880\nRight?\n\n1253\n01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,630\nThat was it hitting the print queue.\n\n1254\n01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:12,780\nNow Ronnie you mentioned pausing it.\n\n1255\n01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:16,210\nIf I know the printer is out of paper, or\nif there's a paper jam, or it's broken,\n\n1256\n01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:17,380\nor whatever.\n\n1257\n01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:21,245\nAs an administrator I might choose\nto come in here and pause printing.\n\n1258\n01:03:21,245 --> 01:03:22,560\nRight?\n\n1259\n01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:25,710\nAnd what that's going to do is if any\nemployee tries to print right now,\n\n1260\n01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:28,250\nwhen they go to Print, so\nhere I'll print again.\n\n1261\n01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:34,525\nWhen we go to print to that printer\nthe job goes into queue and it sits there,\n\n1262\n01:03:34,525 --> 01:03:35,680\nall right.\n\n1263\n01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,130\nThe nice thing about this\nis the printer's paused.\n\n1264\n01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:41,806\nThat job is just gonna sit there and\nwait and now I can go fix the problem and\n\n1265\n01:03:41,806 --> 01:03:46,635\nwhen the problem is all fixed I can come\nback here and I can go to Printer, and\n\n1266\n01:03:46,635 --> 01:03:47,800\nI can unpause it.\n\n1267\n01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:51,250\nAnd then that print job will go,\nand off you go, right?\n\n1268\n01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:55,119\nSo now, people aren't losing print\njobs while the printer is broken.\n\n1269\n01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:58,076\nWe pause it, the print jobs wait,\nand they just build up.\n\n1270\n01:03:58,076 --> 01:04:00,110\nThey queue up in line.\n\n1271\n01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:03,410\nAnd then, when I start it again,\nthey'll print.\n\n1272\n01:04:03,410 --> 01:04:06,118\n>> Don, I noticed that there was\nanother option in printing that\n\n1273\n01:04:06,118 --> 01:04:07,951\nwe had when you went to File and\nthe Print.\n\n1274\n01:04:07,951 --> 01:04:12,650\nAnd there was a little check box that\nwe saw there that said print the file.\n\n1275\n01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:17,650\nThis is another option that we\nhave to be able to print as well.\n\n1276\n01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:20,830\nInstead of directly\nsending it to a printer.\n\n1277\n01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:22,850\nWe instead can actually\nsay I want it to print.\n\n1278\n01:04:22,850 --> 01:04:26,826\nAnd look exactly like this and\nstore it as a single file.\n\n1279\n01:04:26,826 --> 01:04:28,826\nNow if you're like me you're\nprobably wondering, well,\n\n1280\n01:04:28,826 --> 01:04:31,220\nwhy in the world would I\never do anything like that?\n\n1281\n01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:34,680\nThere's several reasons why we might\nchoose to do something like this.\n\n1282\n01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:38,410\nAnd one of those might be if\nwe chose to print this out.\n\n1283\n01:04:38,410 --> 01:04:40,951\nBut we wanted to send it,\nlet's say, to a commercial printer.\n\n1284\n01:04:40,951 --> 01:04:43,201\nAnd they didn't have the exact\nsame equipment I did.\n\n1285\n01:04:43,201 --> 01:04:45,560\nBy printing it to a file,\nthey can now load it up.\n\n1286\n01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:48,340\nAnd use theirs to be\nable to use the printer.\n\n1287\n01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:50,570\n>> Yep, I'm glad you mentioned\nthe commercial aspect there.\n\n1288\n01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:55,850\nBecause the file that it generates is\nnot really usable by normal people.\n\n1289\n01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:59,730\nWhen you send a print job to a printer,\nwhat you're really sending is a picture.\n\n1290\n01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:02,020\nA picture of what you\nwant to be on that paper.\n\n1291\n01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:03,560\nAnd the printer interprets it.\n\n1292\n01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:06,080\nSo when we do that print a file thing.\n\n1293\n01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:08,910\nIf I hit Print,\nit's gonna ask for the file name.\n\n1294\n01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:13,848\nAnd I'll just do like C:\\user\\,\nwhat is my directory,\n\n1295\n01:05:13,848 --> 01:05:16,826\nis it Jane Doe, or something else?\n\n1296\n01:05:16,826 --> 01:05:17,618\n>> Yeah, Jane Doe.\n\n1297\n01:05:17,618 --> 01:05:19,450\n>> Have to make sure I\nspecify the right directory.\n\n1298\n01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:23,285\nIt's not a very user-friendly prompt.\n\n1299\n01:05:23,285 --> 01:05:25,203\nJane Doe, and Desktop.\n\n1300\n01:05:25,203 --> 01:05:28,493\nSo I'm gonna put it on my Desktop.\n\n1301\n01:05:30,993 --> 01:05:32,300\nThere.\n\n1302\n01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:33,993\nOh, shoot, I didn't give it a file name.\n\n1303\n01:05:33,993 --> 01:05:34,868\nOh, no!\n\n1304\n01:05:34,868 --> 01:05:35,785\nThat's not good.\n\n1305\n01:05:35,785 --> 01:05:37,320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'll try that again.\n\n1306\n01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:38,860\nSo I'll just call it test.\n\n1307\n01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:42,930\nThere, all right, so\nit just generated my little test print.\n\n1308\n01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:48,240\nAnd if I go to my Desktop, there's that\ntest file that I just printed, right?\n\n1309\n01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:52,780\nNow that file, if I open it, if I try\nto edit it with something like Notepad.\n\n1310\n01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:56,120\nWhen I take a look at it,\nlook at that mess, right?\n\n1311\n01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,210\n>> Yeah.\n>> I can read a little bit.\n\n1312\n01:05:57,210 --> 01:05:59,460\nIt says, document, Jane Doe.\n\n1313\n01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:03,080\nThere's a little bit that's legible,\nbut the rest of this is a garbled mess.\n\n1314\n01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:05,480\nAnd that's because it's a picture, right?\n\n1315\n01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:07,880\nIt's a picture of what was\nsupposed to be printed.\n\n1316\n01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:11,350\nAnd it's effectively meaningless to me,\nright?\n\n1317\n01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:14,225\nI believe all this represents the word,\nthis.\n\n1318\n01:06:14,225 --> 01:06:15,558\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n1319\n01:06:15,558 --> 01:06:18,230\nall of this would represent the word is a.\n\n1320\n01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:21,410\nAnd in this would represent the word test,\nright?\n\n1321\n01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:25,536\nSo it's kind of broken up based\non what I sound but it is a mess.\n\n1322\n01:06:25,536 --> 01:06:29,806\nSo that kind of print to file is used in\ncommercial environments with typesetters\n\n1323\n01:06:29,806 --> 01:06:30,890\nand all that stuff.\n\n1324\n01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:33,600\nBut for the rest of us,\nif we want to print to a file.\n\n1325\n01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,780\nWe normally want it to\nbe in a usable format.\n\n1326\n01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:39,310\nAnd you may or may not actually\nuse the print function for that.\n\n1327\n01:06:39,310 --> 01:06:41,630\nThere's some things,\nlike if I go to Print.\n\n1328\n01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:43,420\nYou'll see an option in here where I can\n\n1329\n01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:47,350\nprint to a Microsoft XPS Document Writer,\nright?\n\n1330\n01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:50,060\nThat will print to a file also.\n\n1331\n01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:52,880\nIf I print to that,\nit's gonna ask me for a file name.\n\n1332\n01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,077\nI'll put this one on my desktop,\nand I'll call this one test, right?\n\n1333\n01:06:57,210 --> 01:06:59,170\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and save that.\n\n1334\n01:06:59,170 --> 01:07:00,700\nOh, shoot, I forgot the extension.\n\n1335\n01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:03,430\nThis one ends in .xps.\n\n1336\n01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:04,400\nAnd I'll go ahead and save it.\n\n1337\n01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,450\nNow the difference here is it\njust printed to a file, right?\n\n1338\n01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:10,970\nSo I've got that file\nright there on my desktop.\n\n1339\n01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:14,850\nAnd if I switch to some large icons,\nright?\n\n1340\n01:07:14,850 --> 01:07:17,480\nHere's the test file that\nwas pretty much unreadable.\n\n1341\n01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,820\nThis one I can see in the thumbnail\nthat it's already readable.\n\n1342\n01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:22,470\nAnd if I open that up, there it is,\nI can read my document.\n\n1343\n01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:25,670\nNow I've got a digital copy of that\ndocument that I can actually use,\n\n1344\n01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:26,850\nall right?\n\n1345\n01:07:26,850 --> 01:07:28,570\nSo that's one way that\nwe can print to a file.\n\n1346\n01:07:28,570 --> 01:07:30,880\nAnother way, and\nI don't know if WordPad will do this.\n\n1347\n01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,700\nBut some software will have\nwhere you can go to Save As.\n\n1348\n01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:39,330\nAnd it will support saving as\nsomething like an Adobe PDF, right?\n\n1349\n01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:40,619\nLet's see if this one does.\n\n1350\n01:07:40,619 --> 01:07:41,368\nWill it do?\n\n1351\n01:07:41,368 --> 01:07:42,610\nThere's RTF.\n\n1352\n01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:44,390\nNo, it won't do PDF, not this one.\n\n1353\n01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:46,160\nBut a lot of other documents will.\n\n1354\n01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:49,900\nThey'll support saving it to PDF or\nXPS or whatever.\n\n1355\n01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:53,590\nSo that you've got this actual usable\nfile that represents that document.\n\n1356\n01:07:55,010 --> 01:07:55,940\nAll right, so\n\n1357\n01:07:55,940 --> 01:07:58,990\nthose are a couple of different things\nto think about on the printing side.\n\n1358\n01:07:58,990 --> 01:08:00,600\nPrinting the file.\n\n1359\n01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:04,840\nAnother neat feature that's out\nthere is Internet printing.\n\n1360\n01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:07,910\nAnd Internet printing is where\nthe printer is not there in the same\n\n1361\n01:08:07,910 --> 01:08:08,730\nbuilding with you.\n\n1362\n01:08:08,730 --> 01:08:13,220\nInstead, it's located somewhere\nelse in the world, right?\n\n1363\n01:08:13,220 --> 01:08:16,040\nAnd what does that do for\nus if we're not there, right?\n\n1364\n01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:20,200\n>> It allows us to be able to send\na print job way across the world.\n\n1365\n01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:23,540\nAnd I actually set this up by accident,\nDon, at my house.\n\n1366\n01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:26,270\nWe got a new printer and my wife\nsaid should I go ahead and do this?\n\n1367\n01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:27,160\nI said sure thing.\n\n1368\n01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:30,700\nAnd then one day I was able\nto actually send a print job.\n\n1369\n01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:33,160\nAnd it actually went\ndirectly to that printer.\n\n1370\n01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:36,750\nI'd accidentally been here at the office,\nand I picked that home printer.\n\n1371\n01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:38,400\nAnd it was able to see it.\n\n1372\n01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:41,250\nAnd actually send a print job\nover to a printer at home,\n\n1373\n01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:44,880\nwhich did throw my wife off,\nprobably scared her to death.\n\n1374\n01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:48,400\nThe print job actually printed out\nwith nobody else sending a print job.\n\n1375\n01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:52,060\nShe was not sure what ended up happening.\n\n1376\n01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:55,450\n>> Microsoft supports something called\nthe Internet Printing Protocol, IPP.\n\n1377\n01:08:55,450 --> 01:08:59,470\nAnd it allows printers to\nbasically identify themselves.\n\n1378\n01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:02,826\nAnd register with a proxy on the Internet.\n\n1379\n01:09:02,826 --> 01:09:06,868\nAnd your desktop, or your laptop,\nor whatever can do the same thing.\n\n1380\n01:09:06,868 --> 01:09:11,290\nAnd when they both reach out to this proxy\nservice they can then find each other.\n\n1381\n01:09:11,290 --> 01:09:15,130\nAnd your computer anywhere\nin the world can reach out.\n\n1382\n01:09:15,130 --> 01:09:17,100\nAnd send a print job right to the printer.\n\n1383\n01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:20,260\nNow, normally if you have\na network attached printer,\n\n1384\n01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:21,250\nit's what takes care of it.\n\n1385\n01:09:21,250 --> 01:09:23,037\nThat's what Ronnie was\ndescribing right there,\n\n1386\n01:09:23,037 --> 01:09:24,576\nwhere the printer takes care of it for\nyou.\n\n1387\n01:09:24,576 --> 01:09:26,119\nYou set up your computer.\n\n1388\n01:09:26,119 --> 01:09:27,577\nYou set up your printer on your laptop.\n\n1389\n01:09:27,577 --> 01:09:31,150\nAnd then when you travel it\nautomatically finds that remote printer.\n\n1390\n01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:32,410\nMine's actually doing that right now.\n\n1391\n01:09:32,410 --> 01:09:35,240\nI don't know if you noticed\non this Windows 7 machine.\n\n1392\n01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:38,660\nWhen I went into my devices and printers.\n\n1393\n01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:40,826\nWe added that Canon printer there.\n\n1394\n01:09:40,826 --> 01:09:43,650\nBut you can see I've got some of\nthese other ones that are showing up.\n\n1395\n01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:47,250\nThis is a printer that's\ncoming from my work system.\n\n1396\n01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:49,160\nThis is a printer that's\ncoming from my house.\n\n1397\n01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:51,700\nAnd so\nit's picking up these different printers.\n\n1398\n01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:54,350\nAnd it's the Internet Printing Protocol\nthat's doing that.\n\n1399\n01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:57,350\nThere's other proprietary\ntechnologies that do it.\n\n1400\n01:09:57,350 --> 01:10:00,725\nBut Internet Printing Protocols is\nsomething that Microsoft worked to develop\n\n1401\n01:10:00,725 --> 01:10:01,993\nwith several other vendors.\n\n1402\n01:10:01,993 --> 01:10:05,910\nAnd your printer may turn\nit on automatically, right?\n\n1403\n01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:07,534\nIf you have to configure it yourself,\n\n1404\n01:10:07,534 --> 01:10:09,780\nit's actually pretty\ndifficult to get configure.\n\n1405\n01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:11,800\nThere's a lot that you have to go through.\n\n1406\n01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:15,020\nBut it is built into the OS so\nwe can add it in.\n\n1407\n01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:16,700\nAnd go through the configuration.\n\n1408\n01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:19,310\nIt's a little bit beyond\nwhat the MTA covers.\n\n1409\n01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:22,570\nBut just to kinda give you\nthe first steps along the journey.\n\n1410\n01:10:22,570 --> 01:10:24,890\nIt's pretty easy to add\nin to our Control Panel.\n\n1411\n01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:25,610\nSo let me show you that.\n\n1412\n01:10:27,338 --> 01:10:29,900\nAll right, so I'm just gonna\njump into my Control Panel here.\n\n1413\n01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:33,630\nAnd if we go into\nthe Program's Control Panel,\n\n1414\n01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:35,410\nthis is where it'll show\nme a lot of the stuff.\n\n1415\n01:10:35,410 --> 01:10:38,410\nThat my system may already have,\nor I can uninstall.\n\n1416\n01:10:38,410 --> 01:10:40,430\nBut there's this,\nturn Windows features on or off.\n\n1417\n01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:48,670\nAnd if I choose that, and I give it\nmy admin credentials, there we go.\n\n1418\n01:10:48,670 --> 01:10:51,540\nI can see the various Windows\nfeatures that I might need to enable.\n\n1419\n01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:53,480\nAnd if I look down the list,\nsomewhere in here,\n\n1420\n01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:55,060\nI'll find the Internet Printing Protocol.\n\n1421\n01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,820\n>> Yeah, under Print and\nDocument Services,\n\n1422\n01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:00,600\nyou're gonna see it's the first one.\n\n1423\n01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:02,910\nAnd by default it's already checked.\n\n1424\n01:11:02,910 --> 01:11:04,420\nBut sometimes if it's not working.\n\n1425\n01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:07,940\nThis is where you wanna make\nsure that you go to be able to\n\n1426\n01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:09,610\nverify that it's actually working.\n\n1427\n01:11:09,610 --> 01:11:11,530\nAnd the other thing that we\nneed done is to check and\n\n1428\n01:11:11,530 --> 01:11:15,170\nverify that the Print Spooler\nservice is running.\n\n1429\n01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:16,870\n>> Yeah, the Print Spooler service.\n\n1430\n01:11:16,870 --> 01:11:19,230\nI know we mentioned it at\nsome point in the show.\n\n1431\n01:11:19,230 --> 01:11:21,290\nIt's what makes printing possible.\n\n1432\n01:11:21,290 --> 01:11:24,260\nIf the Print Spooler service isn't\nrunning, you won't be able to print.\n\n1433\n01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:27,720\nNow if you can't print,\nsome people will say, well, let me reboot.\n\n1434\n01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:31,230\nAnd rebooting will effectively\nrestart the Print Spooler service.\n\n1435\n01:11:31,230 --> 01:11:33,850\nBut you can save a lotta time if\nyou know the service to look for.\n\n1436\n01:11:33,850 --> 01:11:35,500\nAnd just go and re-start it.\n\n1437\n01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:38,500\nSo for example,\nif I'm not able to print for some reason.\n\n1438\n01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:44,090\nI could go into my Control Panel and\nSystem and Security.\n\n1439\n01:11:44,090 --> 01:11:48,920\nAnd then go down to Administrative Tools,\nand from there, I can go into Services.\n\n1440\n01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:53,730\nNot Component Services,\nalthough you can get there through it, but\n\n1441\n01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:55,940\nthe one that just says\nServices is what I want.\n\n1442\n01:11:55,940 --> 01:12:01,010\nAnd in here, we can scroll down\nuntil we find the Print Spooler.\n\n1443\n01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:02,650\nIt is buried in here somewhere.\n\n1444\n01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:04,300\nThere it is.\n\n1445\n01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:07,060\nAnd you see mine's running,\nmine's working fine, right?\n\n1446\n01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:08,990\nBut let's stop it and see what happens.\n\n1447\n01:12:08,990 --> 01:12:12,270\nI'm gonna go ahead and just stop that.\n\n1448\n01:12:12,270 --> 01:12:14,680\nOh, shoot.\nI'm not an administrator right now, so\n\n1449\n01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:15,610\nit's griping at me.\n\n1450\n01:12:15,610 --> 01:12:17,010\nLet me rerun this.\n\n1451\n01:12:17,010 --> 01:12:19,710\nI should have logged in as an\nadministrator for the show, but I didn't.\n\n1452\n01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:24,780\nHere we go.\n\n1453\n01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:26,344\nAll right so\nI'm just going to go in here and\n\n1454\n01:12:26,344 --> 01:12:28,309\nI'm going to find that\nPrint Spooler service again.\n\n1455\n01:12:30,016 --> 01:12:31,308\nIt is right there.\n\n1456\n01:12:31,308 --> 01:12:32,130\nAnd I'm going to stop it.\n\n1457\n01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:36,960\nWhen I stop that print spooler,\nno printer will be able to print.\n\n1458\n01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:40,170\nMy entire printing\nsubsystem is now offline.\n\n1459\n01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:48,530\nIf I fire up something like Wordpad, and\nI start to type, and I go to File > Print.\n\n1460\n01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:52,280\nWhen I go to Print,\nit tells me I have no printers.\n\n1461\n01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:55,325\nI have no printers cuz\nthe spooler is not running so\n\n1462\n01:12:55,325 --> 01:12:57,455\nit can't find any other printers.\n\n1463\n01:12:57,455 --> 01:13:00,615\nAnd if I go to Start and Devices and\n\n1464\n01:13:00,615 --> 01:13:06,555\nPrinters, when I go in here all\nthe printers are gone also.\n\n1465\n01:13:06,555 --> 01:13:09,050\nSo I don't even see printers.\n\n1466\n01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:11,270\nBut if I have a job that's stuck, or\n\n1467\n01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:14,550\na printer that's just not working new,\nthere might be something wrong.\n\n1468\n01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:16,800\nWe can restart that print spooler and\nit'll fix it.\n\n1469\n01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,770\nAnd if I go back here and start it up.\n\n1470\n01:13:20,350 --> 01:13:24,740\nThat's gonna start, and\nnow if I go back to my printer screen.\n\n1471\n01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:25,650\nIt may take it a moment,\n\n1472\n01:13:25,650 --> 01:13:29,670\nbut eventually it will refresh, and\nall of those printers will show up.\n\n1473\n01:13:29,670 --> 01:13:30,230\nThere it is.\n\n1474\n01:13:30,230 --> 01:13:31,590\nAnd now we can print again, right?\n\n1475\n01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:33,490\nSpooler service is really important.\n\n1476\n01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:36,860\nIf you're using internet printing, you\ngot to have the spooler service running.\n\n1477\n01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:39,770\nIf your using printing of any sort,\nyou've got to have the spooler running.\n\n1478\n01:13:41,710 --> 01:13:43,940\nAll right, so\nthat's pretty much it for printers.\n\n1479\n01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:46,330\nWhen you buy them today,\nmost of them are USB and\n\n1480\n01:13:46,330 --> 01:13:49,660\nit's really just a matter of\nfiguring whether or not you want\n\n1481\n01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:54,560\nthe copier scanner combo stuff, or if you\nwant them to be color or black and white.\n\n1482\n01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:58,650\nIf you want them to be inkjet\nversus laser or toner based.\n\n1483\n01:13:58,650 --> 01:14:01,960\nYeah, see, you basically got to\nmake those decisions, otherwise,\n\n1484\n01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:03,800\ncompatibility is pretty straightforward.\n\n1485\n01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:07,470\nAll right, we do have a little bit more\nto talk about in this episode, but\n\n1486\n01:14:07,470 --> 01:14:11,070\nwe've already run long on this segment,\nso let's stop here and take a break.\n\n1487\n01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:14,670\nAnd when we get back we're gonna\njump in to our last objective,\n\n1488\n01:14:14,670 --> 01:14:16,700\nwhich are other system devices,\n\n1489\n01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:21,530\nvideo and audio and other things on our\nsystem and some basic troubleshooting.\n\n1490\n01:14:21,530 --> 01:14:22,766\nSo stayed tuned.\n\n1491\n01:14:22,766 --> 01:14:23,725\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n1492\n01:14:23,725 --> 01:14:29,233\n[SOUND] Welcome back,\n\n1493\n01:14:29,233 --> 01:14:32,600\neverybody.\n\n1494\n01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:35,810\nSo we've talked about external storage,\nlike hard drives.\n\n1495\n01:14:35,810 --> 01:14:38,060\nAnd we talked about external printers.\n\n1496\n01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:40,480\nWell, not that there's internal ones,\nbut printers in general.\n\n1497\n01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:43,910\nThose are two really common devices\nthat will attach to our systems and\n\n1498\n01:14:43,910 --> 01:14:45,730\nthey're pretty straightforward.\n\n1499\n01:14:45,730 --> 01:14:47,600\nBut after that, sky's the limit.\n\n1500\n01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:50,300\nThere's a ton of other\nthings that we can add in.\n\n1501\n01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:53,600\nAnd so Microsoft calls out just a few more\non the exam objectives here at the end.\n\n1502\n01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:59,400\nAnd they're focused on input devices,\nways that we get data into the computer.\n\n1503\n01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:03,450\nThe first one they call out is one that\nwe know really well, which is video.\n\n1504\n01:15:03,450 --> 01:15:05,270\nBecause that's what we do all the time,\nwe're doing it right now.\n\n1505\n01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:07,210\nI got a bunch of cameras\nall looking at me.\n\n1506\n01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:12,820\nAnd that's an important thing these\ndays because you have internet meetings,\n\n1507\n01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:13,830\npresence, phone calls.\n\n1508\n01:15:13,830 --> 01:15:16,910\nThings like Skype and Google Hangout,\n\n1509\n01:15:16,910 --> 01:15:19,690\nwhatever, where you can do\nvideo calls on the internet.\n\n1510\n01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:22,380\nAssuming you have a way to get\nyour video in to the computer.\n\n1511\n01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:25,650\n>> There's also, of course,\naudio devices and\n\n1512\n01:15:25,650 --> 01:15:29,500\na lot of times those video inputs\nalso integrate in the audio.\n\n1513\n01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,980\nSo not only do you have that\nability of the integration, but\n\n1514\n01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:34,394\nif you want to do things like\npodcasting and other things,\n\n1515\n01:15:34,394 --> 01:15:37,570\nyou may choose to a have a separate\naudio device, such as a microphone.\n\n1516\n01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:39,200\n>> Good point.\n\n1517\n01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:42,630\nIf you're doing a Skype call, and\nyou got your video but no audio,\n\n1518\n01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:44,060\nit's not going to do much for you.\n\n1519\n01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:46,230\nUsually, you chat, type your chat.\n\n1520\n01:15:46,230 --> 01:15:49,670\nSo you typically do want audio\npatched in with that, too.\n\n1521\n01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:53,120\nOn input devices, it's all about taking\nsomething happening in the real world and\n\n1522\n01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:56,410\nconverting it in a way that can be\ncommunicated across the computer.\n\n1523\n01:15:56,410 --> 01:15:59,040\nOn the video side,\nwe'll typically use webcams.\n\n1524\n01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:02,420\nMost laptops today will\nhave a webcam built in.\n\n1525\n01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:05,030\nSo my laptop does, Ronnie,\nyours does too, right it's a\n\n1526\n01:16:05,030 --> 01:16:06,260\n>> Right there at the top.\n\n1527\n01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:07,650\n>> Usually it's at the top so\n\n1528\n01:16:07,650 --> 01:16:11,140\nit's kind of looking at you\n>> Those cameras are not normally very\n\n1529\n01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:14,990\ngood because there's not a lot of\nroom on the laptops to house that, so\n\n1530\n01:16:14,990 --> 01:16:17,990\ntheir normally pretty poor quality,\nand to point them or\n\n1531\n01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:21,570\ndown you have to move your whole laptop\nlid so their kind of frustrating.\n\n1532\n01:16:21,570 --> 01:16:26,008\nIn that scenario you might wanna chose\nto add another web camera that you can\n\n1533\n01:16:26,008 --> 01:16:27,641\nposition the way you want.\n\n1534\n01:16:27,641 --> 01:16:31,711\n>> On a desktop computer, you're not very\nlikely to have a built in webcam, so\n\n1535\n01:16:31,711 --> 01:16:35,908\nagain, you might wanna add one to your\nsystem, so that you can do video calls or\n\n1536\n01:16:35,908 --> 01:16:40,810\nrecord content, whatever it is you want,\nso there's a lot of selection out there.\n\n1537\n01:16:40,810 --> 01:16:42,500\n>> Video cameras are another one where,\n\n1538\n01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:45,130\nalmost all of them today\nare going to be USB.\n\n1539\n01:16:45,130 --> 01:16:47,790\nUSB, it's universal,\nso it makes life easy.\n\n1540\n01:16:47,790 --> 01:16:52,140\nI've got Newegg's webpage pulled up here,\njust kinda shopping for webcams.\n\n1541\n01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:53,710\nAnd you'll see a bunch of different ones,\n\n1542\n01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:56,620\nLogitech is probably the most\nprolific manufacturer.\n\n1543\n01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:58,220\nThey make a ton of webcams.\n\n1544\n01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:02,230\n>> But Microsoft has their LifeCams,\nwhich are straight from them.\n\n1545\n01:17:02,230 --> 01:17:05,920\nYou got other vendors, actually there's\nsome Microsoft LifeCams right there.\n\n1546\n01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:09,080\nAnd what you'll see is they\nall kind of look the same.\n\n1547\n01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:12,940\nThey're a camera and\nthen they got a weird little mount to it.\n\n1548\n01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:16,190\nAnd that mount is designed to\nattach to the top of your monitor.\n\n1549\n01:17:16,190 --> 01:17:19,460\nAnd it's adjustable for\nwhether you've got a thick monitor or\n\n1550\n01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:22,780\na really ultra thins, flat screen.\n\n1551\n01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:26,920\nThey can adjust to that, so it's kind\nof like a bendable stand to attach it.\n\n1552\n01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:29,810\nOther ones are even fancier,\nlike this crazy thing.\n\n1553\n01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:33,190\nAnd that one's super fancy because\nit's got depth perception.\n\n1554\n01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:36,990\nIt can actually do 3D video which is kinda\nneat because to do 3D you need more than\n\n1555\n01:17:36,990 --> 01:17:38,880\none camera and it's got that.\n\n1556\n01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:42,720\nSo you can get really,\nreally cheap cameras that are really good.\n\n1557\n01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:46,720\nThese little five megapixel live cameras,\nthey actually give really good quality for\n\n1558\n01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:47,350\nabout $50.\n\n1559\n01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:49,900\nYou can get it even cheaper,\nthough, right.\n\n1560\n01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:51,970\nSo there's a Microsoft one for $25.\n\n1561\n01:17:51,970 --> 01:17:55,240\nUsually it is video quality\nthat you're sacrificing.\n\n1562\n01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:59,620\nThe more expensive ones are gonna give\nyou sharper video, a nicer picture, and\n\n1563\n01:17:59,620 --> 01:18:01,820\nusually special effects of some sort,\nright.\n\n1564\n01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:05,670\nYou can put like a shark head over\nyours or whatever it is that you want.\n\n1565\n01:18:05,670 --> 01:18:06,800\nThey do fancy stuff.\n\n1566\n01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:10,680\nBut other than that,\nthey're really just taking pictures and\n\n1567\n01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:13,670\nconverting them into something digital\nthat can be sent onto your computer.\n\n1568\n01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:16,900\nNow they might have audio built in,\ntoo, so\n\n1569\n01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,410\nthere will be a little\ntiny microphone in there.\n\n1570\n01:18:18,410 --> 01:18:22,260\nAnd microphones are another thing\nthat we know a decent bit about here.\n\n1571\n01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:25,350\nMost of the microphones in these\nwebcams are not very good.\n\n1572\n01:18:25,350 --> 01:18:27,600\nSo you're not gonna get\ngreat quality out of them.\n\n1573\n01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:28,660\nYou'll get some distortion,\n\n1574\n01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:32,030\na little bit of feedback, and\naudio can typically come through quiet.\n\n1575\n01:18:32,030 --> 01:18:34,790\nSo if you want a higher-quality\naudio sound on your computer,\n\n1576\n01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:37,620\nyou'll probably need to buy\nan external microphone.\n\n1577\n01:18:38,670 --> 01:18:42,750\nNow, external microphones,\na lot of them are USB, the good ones,\n\n1578\n01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:44,560\nUSB microphones sound great.\n\n1579\n01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:48,950\nBut many of them still use the older\nstyle dedicated microphone connector\n\n1580\n01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:53,560\nwhich looks like a headphone jack,\na 3.5 millimeter jack.\n\n1581\n01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:56,000\nThose are usually colored pink\non the outside of your system.\n\n1582\n01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,565\nSo if you look and\nyou see a pink headphone jack,\n\n1583\n01:18:58,565 --> 01:19:00,565\nthat's usually where you\ncan plug in a microphone.\n\n1584\n01:19:00,565 --> 01:19:01,745\nNot every system has that.\n\n1585\n01:19:01,745 --> 01:19:04,475\nMy laptop here does not\nhave a microphone jack.\n\n1586\n01:19:04,475 --> 01:19:06,545\nIt's got a headphone jack but\nnot a microphone.\n\n1587\n01:19:06,545 --> 01:19:09,115\nCuz it's got a built-in microphone and\nthey figure if you're going to use one,\n\n1588\n01:19:09,115 --> 01:19:10,160\nyou can do that..\n\n1589\n01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:12,010\nOr you can add USB.\n\n1590\n01:19:12,010 --> 01:19:13,260\nRonnie does yours have a microphone jack?\n\n1591\n01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:14,670\n>> Mine does not have a microphone jack,\n\n1592\n01:19:14,670 --> 01:19:17,750\nit just has that little dot on,\nright next to it.\n\n1593\n01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:19,560\n>> Yeah, so some devices have it,\nsome don't.\n\n1594\n01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:22,780\nDesktops almost always do\nhave a microphone jack still.\n\n1595\n01:19:22,780 --> 01:19:26,380\nBut when we shop for a microphone, here,\nwe'll shop a little bit for these.\n\n1596\n01:19:26,380 --> 01:19:28,830\nYou'll fins a good mix that are out there.\n\n1597\n01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:30,090\nLike here's these Yetis.\n\n1598\n01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:32,750\nWe really like these, but\nthey're kind of pricey, right?\n\n1599\n01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:35,367\nBut they're USB,\nthey plug right into a USB port and\n\n1600\n01:19:35,367 --> 01:19:38,283\nthey sound great Some of\nthe other ones that are out there,\n\n1601\n01:19:38,283 --> 01:19:41,340\nlike this desktop microphone\nit's a whopping $7.00.\n\n1602\n01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:43,693\nAnd it just plugs into\na regular microphone jack,\n\n1603\n01:19:43,693 --> 01:19:46,920\na 3.5 millimeter connector,\nand gets you a microphone.\n\n1604\n01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:49,290\nBut you can see the reviews\nare a little low on it,\n\n1605\n01:19:49,290 --> 01:19:52,660\nthe USB ones are nice cuz they convert\nyour voice to digital, and send it in.\n\n1606\n01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:54,650\nIt comes through nice, and clear.\n\n1607\n01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:58,060\nThe analog one's here,\nit's just an electrical impulse going in,\n\n1608\n01:19:58,060 --> 01:20:01,150\nand it has to get amplified, and you'll\nalways get some distortion with that.\n\n1609\n01:20:01,150 --> 01:20:05,410\nSo, you'll find the quality varies widely.\n\n1610\n01:20:05,410 --> 01:20:06,950\nYou can get microphones that are $7-8.00.\n\n1611\n01:20:06,950 --> 01:20:09,399\nYou can get microphones that are $8.00.\n\n1612\n01:20:09,399 --> 01:20:12,220\n[LAUGH] And there's gonna be\na quality difference between them.\n\n1613\n01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:13,979\nSo, lots of choices out there on this one.\n\n1614\n01:20:16,151 --> 01:20:19,020\nNow, if you get a webcam,\nits probably got both combined.\n\n1615\n01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:20,510\nMaybe that works for\nyou, maybe it doesn't.\n\n1616\n01:20:20,510 --> 01:20:21,420\nYou can buy them separate.\n\n1617\n01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:22,410\nYou can add them on.\n\n1618\n01:20:22,410 --> 01:20:24,260\nThe nice thing is you can\nmove them between computers.\n\n1619\n01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:27,390\nSo, if you have a desktop, and\na laptop you can swap them around.\n\n1620\n01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:31,020\nFor the most part, Windows will have\ndrivers for these, and detect them, and\n\n1621\n01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:33,120\nwork right out of the box.\n\n1622\n01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:36,550\nBut if they have advanced functionality\nin them, like a lot of webcams do,\n\n1623\n01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:39,680\nyou'll probably have software\nthat you need to install, too.\n\n1624\n01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:42,780\nNow, how do we know,\nif we need to go an extra step?\n\n1625\n01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:45,810\nHow do we know, if we need to install\nmore software to get a device to work?\n\n1626\n01:20:45,810 --> 01:20:47,880\n>> Yeah.\nA lot of times what ends up happening,\n\n1627\n01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:51,460\nis when you can't do all the features\nthat you want to be able to do.\n\n1628\n01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:52,620\nChanging backgrounds, or\n\n1629\n01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:56,750\neven zooming in a lot of times,\nthe basic driver will get it to work.\n\n1630\n01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:59,010\nBut if you only get to that point,\nand all of a sudden,\n\n1631\n01:20:59,010 --> 01:21:00,310\nyou go, I'd like to zoom in, or\n\n1632\n01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:04,110\nI'd like to change the coloring a little\nbit, you may not be able to do that.\n\n1633\n01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:05,950\nSo, usually what you wanna do of course,\n\n1634\n01:21:05,950 --> 01:21:09,470\nis install the manufacturer's\nadditional software.\n\n1635\n01:21:09,470 --> 01:21:10,690\nThat will give you that functionality.\n\n1636\n01:21:10,690 --> 01:21:14,210\nSometimes though, it gives you so much,\nit's hard to actually know exactly\n\n1637\n01:21:14,210 --> 01:21:16,760\nwhere to go/\n>> So, you can be a little bit overwhelmed\n\n1638\n01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:20,410\nby trying to just figure out where to\ngo to change, just a few settings in.\n\n1639\n01:21:20,410 --> 01:21:21,810\n>> Yeah.\nSo, what we're gonna do is we're gonna\n\n1640\n01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:24,600\ntake a look at what's called\nthe Device Manager here, in just a minute.\n\n1641\n01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:27,590\nThat helps us troubleshoot, and\nhelps us isolate when that's needed.\n\n1642\n01:21:27,590 --> 01:21:32,010\nBut before I jump into that, there's one\nmore input device I wanna cover, and\n\n1643\n01:21:32,010 --> 01:21:35,430\nthat is a infrared input device.\n\n1644\n01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:40,150\nNow, for most of us, infrared is a dead\ntechnology, we just don't see it anymore.\n\n1645\n01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:43,720\nSo, most computers don't even have\ninfrared sensors on them anymore.\n\n1646\n01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:47,180\nThere was a brief time in the 90s where\ninfrared printers were kind of picking up,\n\n1647\n01:21:47,180 --> 01:21:49,560\nand you'd get palm pilots\nwith infrared sync.\n\n1648\n01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:54,090\nBut if you ever used them, you'll know\nthat infrared was really bad, really slow,\n\n1649\n01:21:54,090 --> 01:21:55,700\nyou had to be really close.\n\n1650\n01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:58,730\nBut there's one place where you\nstill see infrared a lot today, and\n\n1651\n01:21:58,730 --> 01:22:00,980\nthat's in remote controls.\n\n1652\n01:22:00,980 --> 01:22:05,180\nIf you have a television, the odds are you\nhave a remote control for that television,\n\n1653\n01:22:05,180 --> 01:22:08,160\nthat's how you change the channels,\nturn up the volume, turn down the volume.\n\n1654\n01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:12,660\nMany computers these days\nare sold as a media center, or\n\n1655\n01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:15,650\na theater, home theater PC, HTPC.\n\n1656\n01:22:15,650 --> 01:22:18,180\nAnd for those,\nyou're gonna hook them up to a TV,\n\n1657\n01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:20,080\nand display the computer\nup on that screen.\n\n1658\n01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:23,180\nAnd if you're sitting back on the couch,\nyou don't wanna have to have a keyboard,\n\n1659\n01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:23,960\nand a mouse.\n\n1660\n01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:26,350\nYou wanna little remote control\nto be able to change the channel.\n\n1661\n01:22:26,350 --> 01:22:31,180\nAnd so, you might get an infrared\ninput device for your computer.\n\n1662\n01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:34,030\nA great example of that\nis a Hewlett-Packard.\n\n1663\n01:22:34,030 --> 01:22:39,710\nHP sells this little kit, and it's a USB\nbox, that you add onto your computer.\n\n1664\n01:22:39,710 --> 01:22:44,450\nThis guy right here, and\nit's got a giant infrared sensor on it.\n\n1665\n01:22:44,450 --> 01:22:48,750\nAnd it has a USB cable that runs to the\nback of your computer, and plugs in, and\n\n1666\n01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:50,540\nnow you've got an infrared sensor.\n\n1667\n01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:54,410\nAnd you get this nice little remote,\nthat has arrow keys, and\n\n1668\n01:22:54,410 --> 01:22:57,430\na media center button for\nlaunching the Windows Media Center.\n\n1669\n01:22:57,430 --> 01:22:59,550\nYou've got where you can\ndo all the various things,\n\n1670\n01:22:59,550 --> 01:23:03,450\nyou would want a channel,\nand control the device.\n\n1671\n01:23:03,450 --> 01:23:05,330\nSo, if you're running\nWindows Media Center,\n\n1672\n01:23:05,330 --> 01:23:07,000\nI know we showed that\nin an earlier episode.\n\n1673\n01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:10,230\nIf you're running Windows Media Center,\nyou can use this to control it.\n\n1674\n01:23:10,230 --> 01:23:14,110\nAnd it's just like a cable set top box,\nor a Tevo, or whatever.\n\n1675\n01:23:14,110 --> 01:23:17,370\nIt's, it's not something you need\na keyboard, and a mouse to control.\n\n1676\n01:23:17,370 --> 01:23:19,450\n>> Now, a lot of times when you do see,\n\n1677\n01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:23,240\nthese types of devices too\n>> If you bought the computer specifically\n\n1678\n01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:24,060\nfor a media center,\n\n1679\n01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:28,420\nyou'll probably see that they come with at\nleast some resemblance of a remote drive,\n\n1680\n01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:32,160\nbut this one looks a little\nfancy [INAUDIBLE] my laptop.\n\n1681\n01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:35,960\nThe older laptop that I have was actually\ndesigned to be a media center, and\n\n1682\n01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:40,120\nin that laptop itself, it came with\na little small remote control.\n\n1683\n01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:43,400\nThat simply slipped,\nit actually locked into a side slot.\n\n1684\n01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:46,580\nI was able to pull it out, and\nactually use it as a media center remote.\n\n1685\n01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:47,555\nSo, it was kind of fancy.\n\n1686\n01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:49,090\n>> Yeah.\n\n1687\n01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:52,290\nSo, infrared is not completely dead,\nthere is still a use for it, and\n\n1688\n01:23:52,290 --> 01:23:53,380\nyou might have that one out there.\n\n1689\n01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:54,830\nJust something to be aware of.\n\n1690\n01:23:55,950 --> 01:23:58,410\nNow, when we attach any of these devices.\n\n1691\n01:23:58,410 --> 01:24:00,410\nI mentioned that sometimes\nyou got to load software.\n\n1692\n01:24:00,410 --> 01:24:03,930\nAnd these right here, these\nare actually authorized by Microsoft.\n\n1693\n01:24:03,930 --> 01:24:05,590\nAnd so,\nthese don't need any additional software.\n\n1694\n01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:08,020\nYou plug it in, and it just works.\n\n1695\n01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:10,300\nBut you might plug in software, and\n\n1696\n01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:14,120\na little bubble appears on the screen\nsaying, hardware was not able to be\n\n1697\n01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:18,130\nconfigured, or unable to locate driver,\nor something like that.\n\n1698\n01:24:18,130 --> 01:24:20,480\nAnd if you see the bubble,\nyou'll notice the problem.\n\n1699\n01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:22,750\nBut if you've missed it,\nif the bubble's already gone,\n\n1700\n01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:25,540\nhow do you know your\nsoftware has an issue?\n\n1701\n01:24:25,540 --> 01:24:29,030\nAnd the Windows Device Manager is the tool\nthat will help you figure that out.\n\n1702\n01:24:30,260 --> 01:24:33,780\n>> When you do have a physical\ndevice plugged in, but\n\n1703\n01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:36,500\nyou're still not able to\nuse it on the computer.\n\n1704\n01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:39,910\nThe one place that we definitely wanna\nmake sure we get to is of course,\n\n1705\n01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:41,180\nthe Device Manager.\n\n1706\n01:24:41,180 --> 01:24:44,670\nThe Device Manager may see that\nthere is a device plugged in.\n\n1707\n01:24:44,670 --> 01:24:46,880\nIt just tells you,\nit can't communicate with it.\n\n1708\n01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,960\nSo, when we see anything else going on\nthat Device Manager besides what we're\n\n1709\n01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:53,350\nexpecting to see, it probably means\nthat we're missing the correct driver.\n\n1710\n01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:56,430\n>> So, let me show you the easiest\nway to troubleshoot this.\n\n1711\n01:24:56,430 --> 01:24:57,420\nAnd on the MTA exam,\n\n1712\n01:24:57,420 --> 01:24:59,700\nthey don't want you to be\ntroubleshooting geniuses, or anything.\n\n1713\n01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:02,280\nSo, I'll just show you the two\nbasic things that we look for.\n\n1714\n01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:05,130\nBut before I do that I guess [LAUGH] we\nshould get in the Device Manager first, so\n\n1715\n01:25:05,130 --> 01:25:06,590\nlet me show you how to get there.\n\n1716\n01:25:06,590 --> 01:25:09,040\nSo, we're just going to\nbring up our Start Menu.\n\n1717\n01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:11,770\nYou can find Computer,\nunder your Start Menu.\n\n1718\n01:25:11,770 --> 01:25:14,360\nJust right-click on that,\nand choose Manage.\n\n1719\n01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:18,800\nWhen you choose Manage, you do need\nto be an Administrator to do it.\n\n1720\n01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:24,040\nThere we go.\n\n1721\n01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:26,580\nAnd it's gonna take you into\nthe Computer Management screen.\n\n1722\n01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:29,040\nAnd inside of there,\nyou will see the Device Manager.\n\n1723\n01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:30,990\nThere's actually a few\ndifferent ways to get to it,\n\n1724\n01:25:30,990 --> 01:25:32,970\nthat's the way that I like to go.\n\n1725\n01:25:32,970 --> 01:25:36,710\nThe other ways are, you can go through the\nControl Panel, whittle through it there,\n\n1726\n01:25:36,710 --> 01:25:39,370\nbut this way is pretty quick, and easy.\n\n1727\n01:25:39,370 --> 01:25:43,290\nIn the Device Manager it will show\nyou all of the hardware that is\n\n1728\n01:25:43,290 --> 01:25:46,880\ncurrently attached to your system,\nand organize it by category.\n\n1729\n01:25:48,180 --> 01:25:53,490\nIf everything is healthy, and happy,\nyou'll normally see it look like this,\n\n1730\n01:25:53,490 --> 01:25:56,052\nwhere all of the categories are nice,\nand closed off.\n\n1731\n01:25:56,052 --> 01:26:02,160\nNow, during the break I plugged\nin a USB device into my computer,\n\n1732\n01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:03,910\nit's a memory card reader.\n\n1733\n01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:07,200\nSo, if you have like a SD cards,\nor micro SD cards, and\n\n1734\n01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:09,140\nyou want your computer to read them,\nyou have this little reader, and\n\n1735\n01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:12,120\nyou pop it on the device,\nand there it goes.\n\n1736\n01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:15,250\nSo, I plug one in, and\nWindows didn't recognize it.\n\n1737\n01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:16,430\nSo, it didn't know, what it was.\n\n1738\n01:26:16,430 --> 01:26:19,280\nIt needs a driver, and\nthere was a bubble that told me that, but\n\n1739\n01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:21,720\nit didn't stay up very long,\nand it's gone now.\n\n1740\n01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:25,210\nWell, if I'm sitting here wondering, well,\nwhy isn't my memory card reader working,\n\n1741\n01:26:25,210 --> 01:26:26,760\nwhy isn't it showing up?\n\n1742\n01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:29,680\nI could come into Device Manager,\nand the first thing to look for\n\n1743\n01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:33,120\nis if any of the categories\nare automatically expanded.\n\n1744\n01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:35,100\nIf you see a category expanded,\n\n1745\n01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:37,240\nthat means that one of the devices\nin there has a problem.\n\n1746\n01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:39,805\nSo, when I first fire this up,\n\n1747\n01:26:39,805 --> 01:26:43,180\nthe Universal Serial Bus Controllers\nwas expanded.\n\n1748\n01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:47,010\nI didn't expand it,\nthe system did because there's a problem.\n\n1749\n01:26:47,010 --> 01:26:51,010\nAnd looking in there,\nsure enough I see, Unknown Device.\n\n1750\n01:26:51,010 --> 01:26:53,260\nI plugged in my USB card reader.\n\n1751\n01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:55,080\nAnd Windows didn't know,\nwhat the heck it was.\n\n1752\n01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:59,430\nIt had absolutely no clue, and\nso, it shows as Unknown Device.\n\n1753\n01:26:59,430 --> 01:27:02,280\nThat tells me that it\nis not going to work,\n\n1754\n01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:06,010\nunless I install the software\nfrom the manufacturer.\n\n1755\n01:27:06,010 --> 01:27:09,060\nNow, that manufacturer could be\nany number of companies, and so,\n\n1756\n01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:12,055\nyou need to go to their website,\nand download the software.\n\n1757\n01:27:12,055 --> 01:27:16,100\nNow, when you install it, now Windows\nwill know what the device is, and\n\n1758\n01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:19,000\nit'll activate it, and\nit'll move it up here into,\n\n1759\n01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,030\nI think it ends up under disk drives,\nor something.\n\n1760\n01:27:21,030 --> 01:27:24,950\nIt moves it up to a different location,\nso that it is actually usable.\n\n1761\n01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:27,510\nSo devices that are malfunctioning,\n\n1762\n01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:30,500\nwe'll usually have a yellow\ntriangle with an exclamation point.\n\n1763\n01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:32,830\nAnd it's really hard to\nsee here cuz it's so tiny.\n\n1764\n01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:35,880\nBut it is a yellow triangle with\na black exclamation point on it.\n\n1765\n01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:37,670\nThat tells you the device has an issue.\n\n1766\n01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:39,630\nBut that name is a pretty\ngood hint there too.\n\n1767\n01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:40,960\nUnknown Device.\n\n1768\n01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,330\nIt's probably not gonna work,\nif it's unknown.\n\n1769\n01:27:42,330 --> 01:27:43,750\n>> Yeah.\n\n1770\n01:27:43,750 --> 01:27:47,130\nAnother thing to look out for is,\nlet's use your example, Ronnie.\n\n1771\n01:27:47,130 --> 01:27:50,080\nSo Ronnie mentioned,\nyou might have a web camera, and it works,\n\n1772\n01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:51,680\nyou can see yourself.\n\n1773\n01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:53,750\nBut you can't zoom in or zoom out.\n\n1774\n01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:59,040\nOr maybe the, Logitech has this\nright light technology where it\n\n1775\n01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:02,400\ntries to do your white balancing and stuff\nand your exposure levels automatically.\n\n1776\n01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:05,890\nMaybe that's not working, and\nyour picture is super over-exposed.\n\n1777\n01:28:05,890 --> 01:28:10,379\nWell, there's probably software\nthat makes that work, and Windows,\n\n1778\n01:28:10,379 --> 01:28:14,155\nwhile it might have recognized the camera,\ndoesn't have that software.\n\n1779\n01:28:14,155 --> 01:28:17,400\nThe easy way to spot that is,\nyou can go into your Device Manager, and\n\n1780\n01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:19,440\nyou can find the device.\n\n1781\n01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:22,080\nSo, if I go into my Device Manager here,\nand I find a device.\n\n1782\n01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:24,160\nLet's see here, Imaging Devices.\n\n1783\n01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:24,860\nAll right.\n\n1784\n01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:28,291\nSo, here, I've got this video device,\nall right.\n\n1785\n01:28:28,291 --> 01:28:30,990\nWell, here's my VMWare\nvirtual video device.\n\n1786\n01:28:30,990 --> 01:28:33,200\nBut if you see a generic name on there,\n\n1787\n01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:38,790\nif it says something like Microsoft\ngeneric camera or generic network adapter.\n\n1788\n01:28:38,790 --> 01:28:42,360\nIf you see that terminology,\ngeneric, or if you see\n\n1789\n01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:47,140\nthe WDDM note on there that lets you\nknow it's a built-in Windows driver.\n\n1790\n01:28:47,140 --> 01:28:51,890\nThose are your hints that say it's\njust installed a basic driver,\n\n1791\n01:28:51,890 --> 01:28:54,210\nnot a driver with\nthe advanced functionality.\n\n1792\n01:28:54,210 --> 01:28:59,000\nAnd so I may need to go and get a better\ndriver for that particular hardware.\n\n1793\n01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,670\nAnd I can go to that vendor's website,\ndownload the software from them, and\n\n1794\n01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:05,800\ninstall it, and\nnow you get the advanced functionality.\n\n1795\n01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:11,520\nA lot of these drivers that get installed\nare just generic Microsoft drivers.\n\n1796\n01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:14,706\nAnd so if I take, like,\nthis standard PS2 keyboard here and\n\n1797\n01:29:14,706 --> 01:29:17,458\nI pull up its properties,\nwe can look at the driver.\n\n1798\n01:29:17,458 --> 01:29:19,920\nAnd see how the driver\ncame from Microsoft?\n\n1799\n01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:23,610\nBut if my keyboard came from Logitech,\nthe Microsoft driver might work, but\n\n1800\n01:29:23,610 --> 01:29:27,414\nLogitech knows, they know all the little\nbells and whistles of that keyboard,\n\n1801\n01:29:27,414 --> 01:29:28,917\nthey're the ones who made it.\n\n1802\n01:29:28,917 --> 01:29:30,417\nTheir driver might be better.\n\n1803\n01:29:30,417 --> 01:29:34,625\nSo I can go their website,\nget their driver, and load it.\n\n1804\n01:29:34,625 --> 01:29:36,225\nThese are a little bit\nharder to troubleshoot,\n\n1805\n01:29:36,225 --> 01:29:38,455\nbecause it won't show a problem in here.\n\n1806\n01:29:38,455 --> 01:29:39,833\nIt's not that the device\nis malfunctioning.\n\n1807\n01:29:39,833 --> 01:29:40,935\nThe device does work,\n\n1808\n01:29:40,935 --> 01:29:44,507\nwe just haven't unlocked all of\nits additional functionality.\n\n1809\n01:29:44,507 --> 01:29:46,687\nSo that's the second thing\nthat we wanna look for.\n\n1810\n01:29:46,687 --> 01:29:49,157\nNumber one, look for the warning signs.\n\n1811\n01:29:49,157 --> 01:29:51,947\nLook for a category that's\nautomatically expanded and\n\n1812\n01:29:51,947 --> 01:29:53,547\na device with a yellow triangle on it.\n\n1813\n01:29:53,547 --> 01:29:54,787\nThat tell you you're missing a driver.\n\n1814\n01:29:56,018 --> 01:29:59,541\nOr look for a device that has\na generic name applied to it.\n\n1815\n01:29:59,541 --> 01:30:02,089\nAnd that lets you know that\nthere's more than likely a more\n\n1816\n01:30:02,089 --> 01:30:04,748\nadvanced specific driver from\nthe vendor of that hardware.\n\n1817\n01:30:06,448 --> 01:30:08,219\nDevice Manager's a great tool.\n\n1818\n01:30:08,219 --> 01:30:12,509\nOne thing to keep in mind is that once you\nopen it, it doesn't refresh automatically.\n\n1819\n01:30:12,509 --> 01:30:14,879\nSo if you started moving stuff around,\nadding devices,\n\n1820\n01:30:14,879 --> 01:30:17,099\nunplugging, you might need\nto refresh your screen.\n\n1821\n01:30:17,099 --> 01:30:19,447\nAnd there's a little button for\nthat at the top,\n\n1822\n01:30:19,447 --> 01:30:22,833\nsometimes there's a button at the top,\nor I'm not seeing my button.\n\n1823\n01:30:22,833 --> 01:30:23,875\nWhere the heck is that?\n\n1824\n01:30:23,875 --> 01:30:24,791\nOh, here we go.\n\n1825\n01:30:24,791 --> 01:30:27,997\nYou can just right-click on your\ncomputer name, and you'll see Scan for\n\n1826\n01:30:27,997 --> 01:30:29,154\nhardware changes.\n\n1827\n01:30:29,154 --> 01:30:32,339\nAnd that'll let it scan and do a refresh\nto pick up that additional hardware,\n\n1828\n01:30:32,339 --> 01:30:33,916\nwhatever it is that you moved around.\n\n1829\n01:30:33,916 --> 01:30:37,074\nAll right, so Device Manager,\npretty cool utility.\n\n1830\n01:30:37,074 --> 01:30:39,963\n>> Yeah, any time that you\nare plugging in a peripheral and\n\n1831\n01:30:39,963 --> 01:30:42,299\nit's not working the way\nthat you want it to,\n\n1832\n01:30:42,299 --> 01:30:46,667\nusually this is kind of the first place to\ncheck, verify that the driver is correct,\n\n1833\n01:30:46,667 --> 01:30:51,000\nor if it's not, you actually go ahead and\nof course then install the right driver.\n\n1834\n01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,592\nBut here's the first place\nyou're gonna actually go and\n\n1835\n01:30:53,592 --> 01:30:56,115\nsee that the operating\nsystem isn't recognizing it.\n\n1836\n01:30:56,115 --> 01:30:59,560\n>> And David in the chat room mentioned\nsomething that I completely forgot about.\n\n1837\n01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:02,420\nWhich there is another status\nthat could cause a category to be\n\n1838\n01:31:02,420 --> 01:31:04,870\nexpanded in the Device Manager.\n\n1839\n01:31:04,870 --> 01:31:06,750\nIf a device has been disabled.\n\n1840\n01:31:06,750 --> 01:31:07,440\nAll right.\n\n1841\n01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:11,330\nNow, most devices are never going to\nbe disabled unless you do it yourself.\n\n1842\n01:31:11,330 --> 01:31:12,380\nSo hopefully you know it.\n\n1843\n01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:16,060\nBut if you share a computer with somebody\nelse, you don't know what they've done.\n\n1844\n01:31:16,060 --> 01:31:16,580\nRight?\n\n1845\n01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:19,830\nAnd so there could be a device\nthat somebody has disabled.\n\n1846\n01:31:19,830 --> 01:31:24,552\nMaybe you share the computer with somebody\nwho's, like, ultra-paranoid and they say,\n\n1847\n01:31:24,552 --> 01:31:27,150\nman, I don't want that\nweb camera to function.\n\n1848\n01:31:27,150 --> 01:31:30,940\nI don't want it to be present at all,\nbecause somebody might be watching me.\n\n1849\n01:31:30,940 --> 01:31:31,570\nRight?\n\n1850\n01:31:31,570 --> 01:31:33,210\nWell, if you live in the United States,\n\n1851\n01:31:33,210 --> 01:31:35,410\nthe sad truth is that\nsomebody is watching you.\n\n1852\n01:31:35,410 --> 01:31:37,590\nBut, you know,\nyou're still being a little paranoid.\n\n1853\n01:31:37,590 --> 01:31:40,680\nSo, let's go in here and\nsee what that's like if we disable one.\n\n1854\n01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:43,940\nI'll go down here to my Imaging Devices,\nand there's that Video Device.\n\n1855\n01:31:43,940 --> 01:31:46,720\nAnd I'm just gonna right-click and\nchoose Disable, all right?\n\n1856\n01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:47,980\nI'm gonna disable it.\n\n1857\n01:31:47,980 --> 01:31:50,700\nAnd when I do that,\na different icon appears.\n\n1858\n01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:53,950\nIt's a white circle with\na black arrow pointing down.\n\n1859\n01:31:53,950 --> 01:31:57,790\nAnd what David was pointing, out and\nthank you David for reminding me,\n\n1860\n01:31:57,790 --> 01:32:02,083\nis that even if it's disabled, it'll\ncause it to automatically expand that.\n\n1861\n01:32:02,083 --> 01:32:07,150\nSo if I close that, and\nlet's just go back into my Device Manager,\n\n1862\n01:32:07,150 --> 01:32:10,780\nand we'll jump in there and\nsee it, all right.\n\n1863\n01:32:10,780 --> 01:32:12,360\nWhen I jump in there and\n\n1864\n01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:17,750\nI go into my Device Manager, see how it\nautomatically expanded Imaging Devices?\n\n1865\n01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:20,350\nAnd that's because, well,\nit's not a problem with the device.\n\n1866\n01:32:20,350 --> 01:32:22,110\nThe driver's perfectly good.\n\n1867\n01:32:22,110 --> 01:32:23,360\nWe've disabled it.\n\n1868\n01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:25,480\nAnd so, when it's disabled,\nit'll expand, so.\n\n1869\n01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:27,450\nYou may see that.\n\n1870\n01:32:27,450 --> 01:32:32,100\nIf you install, like, VPN software,\nVPNs will normally have a virtual network\n\n1871\n01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:34,820\nadapter that they disable\nwhen they're not in use.\n\n1872\n01:32:34,820 --> 01:32:38,450\nAnd so you might see something\ndisabled and it's done on purpose.\n\n1873\n01:32:38,450 --> 01:32:40,690\nThose virtual network\nadapters do it pretty often.\n\n1874\n01:32:40,690 --> 01:32:44,260\nBut if it's something else, like this\nmemory card reader, it's a real problem.\n\n1875\n01:32:46,310 --> 01:32:49,040\nAll right, so we got a chance to see\nquite a bit of stuff here, right?\n\n1876\n01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:52,280\nWe talked about devices that\nget attached to our computer.\n\n1877\n01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:54,640\nAnd we started talking about\nhard drives in the beginning.\n\n1878\n01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:56,560\nWe progressed onto printers.\n\n1879\n01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:01,890\nAnd then we got a chance to see video,\naudio, and infrared devices.\n\n1880\n01:33:01,890 --> 01:33:03,610\nAll sorts of good stuff there.\n\n1881\n01:33:03,610 --> 01:33:07,050\nWe even touched on cloud services like\ncloud storage and cloud printing,\n\n1882\n01:33:07,050 --> 01:33:07,830\nwhich is kind of fun.\n\n1883\n01:33:07,830 --> 01:33:12,552\nAnd we wrapped up there with some basic\ntroubleshooting and system identification\n\n1884\n01:33:12,552 --> 01:33:17,280\nstuff that is something you'll need to do\nas a IT service technician or a whatever.\n\n1885\n01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:20,920\nIf you wanna learn more about\ntroubleshooting and diagnostics and\n\n1886\n01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:23,590\nstuff, well, get your MTA first, right?\n\n1887\n01:33:23,590 --> 01:33:25,130\nThis is that starting point,\nget that done.\n\n1888\n01:33:25,130 --> 01:33:29,250\nAnd then for your next certification,\nyou should look into CompTIA A+, right?\n\n1889\n01:33:29,250 --> 01:33:33,300\nThat goes really into troubleshooting\nhardware and a lot of different tools and\n\n1890\n01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:37,470\ntechniques that are available to do that,\nfar beyond just what we touched on here.\n\n1891\n01:33:37,470 --> 01:33:40,041\nBut for the MTA, this is more than enough.\n\n1892\n01:33:40,041 --> 01:33:44,030\nSo get that one under your\nbelt first before moving on.\n\n1893\n01:33:44,030 --> 01:33:46,110\nAll right, well, Ronnie,\nI think that wraps up this objective.\n\n1894\n01:33:46,110 --> 01:33:48,510\nSo you think anything else we\nneed to throw in on that one?\n\n1895\n01:33:48,510 --> 01:33:49,140\n>> Nope.\n\n1896\n01:33:49,140 --> 01:33:51,620\nNow it's time to be able to go on and\nstudy.\n\n1897\n01:33:51,620 --> 01:33:53,770\nSo you've got a lot of material\nthat we've already covered, but\n\n1898\n01:33:53,770 --> 01:33:55,340\nthere's still some more to cover.\n\n1899\n01:33:55,340 --> 01:33:57,290\nSo we've got another episode\nthat we'll be heading into soon.\n\n1900\n01:33:57,290 --> 01:33:58,312\n>> Yeah.\n\n1901\n01:33:58,312 --> 01:34:01,640\nAll right, so if you have any questions\non what we've talked about so\n\n1902\n01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:03,730\nfar, feel free to ask.\n\n1903\n01:34:03,730 --> 01:34:04,480\nLive during

00:00:12.173\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.173 --> 00:00:15.884\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.884 --> 00:00:17.257\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\n\n6\n00:00:17.257 --> 00:00:20.310\ntoday we're doing our\nWindows Operating System Fundamentals.\n\n7\n00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.860\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're gonna be taking a look at storage.\n\n8\n00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.410\nWe really need to make sure\nwe have a good concept and\n\n9\n00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.570\nunderstanding of the different\nstorage options available.\n\n10\n00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.530\nBecause it has definitely changed,\nespecially, in the last few years.\n\n11\n00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.790\nThe different types of storage,\nand there's advantages and\n\n12\n00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.770\ndisadvantages to each one of those.\n\n13\n00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.640\nAnd in order to pick the right one,\nwe've gotta make sure we're familiar\n\n14\n00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.510\nwith the different technologies, and what\nthey're good at, what they're not good at.\n\n15\n00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.460\nWhere to best utilize those\ndifferent technologies.\n\n16\n00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.840\nAnd here to explain all that, and\n\n17\n00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.580\nmake a sense out of the myriad of\npossibilities is Mr Wes Bryan.\n\n18\n00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.470\nHow are you doing Wes?\n\n19\n00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.540\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing okay,\nwe're gonna give it our best,\n\n20\n00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.090\nbecause there are a lot of\ndifferent options out there.\n\n21\n00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.690\nAnd that's really where\nwe're gonna dive into,\n\n22\n00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.560\nwe've got a set of objectives that\nwe wanna tackle for the exam.\n\n23\n00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.560\nSome of them we've already tackled in\nother classes, or other courses or\n\n24\n00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.748\nother episodes, if I can give them.\n\n25\n00:01:08.748 --> 00:01:11.850\n[LAUGH] Other episodes\nthroughout this course.\n\n26\n00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.980\nBut we'll kinda mention them here and just\nquickly rehash on the concept of storage.\n\n27\n00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.225\nBecause really, when it comes down to,\n\n28\n00:01:16.225 --> 00:01:20.510\nit's gonna be some of the components in\ntechnology that you need to be aware of.\n\n29\n00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.170\nThe first thing that I wanna mention is\n\n30\n00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.470\na little bit about the fallout\nsecurity on your storage devices.\n\n31\n00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.280\nAll right, I just wanna kinda\nstart out with encryption and\n\n32\n00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.250\nsecurity on your storage devices.\n\n33\n00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.280\nAnd keep in mind, that we did do\nan episode on understanding encryption.\n\n34\n00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.630\nSo, I just wanna kinda\nbriefly run through it.\n\n35\n00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.680\nWe not gonna spend a lot of time.\n\n36\n00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.810\nIf you need a little bit more about\nsome of the things that you can do\n\n37\n00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.210\nwith encryption, go back and\n\n38\n00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.950\ncheck out our Understanding Encryption\nepisode that we shot.\n\n39\n00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.070\nSo, when it comes to securing\nyour storage devices today,\n\n40\n00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.790\nencryption really is about taking plain\ntexts, turning it into cipher texts.\n\n41\n00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.060\nAnd really just protecting it,\nso that if I pass, maybe,\n\n42\n00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.610\na file from myself to Mike, and I don't\nwant anybody else be able to see it.\n\n43\n00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.870\nWe can apply some type of encryption\nlevel to it, we can protect it.\n\n44\n00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.220\nNow, there are things that\nare built into Windows, and\n\n45\n00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.688\nthere are also third-party utilities,\nas well.\n\n46\n00:02:07.688 --> 00:02:10.980\nI do wanna mention, though,\nwhen it comes to the MTA exam,\n\n47\n00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.350\nyou're really only gonna see\nthe Microsoft technologies.\n\n48\n00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.760\nTwo biggest ones are gonna be\nEncrypted File System and BitLocker.\n\n49\n00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.690\nRemember, Encrypted File System,\nthis is the way we encrypt a file-by-file\n\n50\n00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.058\nencryption of our, I guess, our files and\nfolders on our storage devices.\n\n51\n00:02:26.058 --> 00:02:27.490\nAnd then, BitLocker,\n\n52\n00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.910\nthat's an encryption technology that\nessentially does full disk encryptions.\n\n53\n00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.610\nSo I just want to kinda mention those.\n\n54\n00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.120\nBecause it really is\none of the first couple\n\n55\n00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.280\nof things that they do mention here\ninside of understanding storage.\n\n56\n00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, encryption is a big part\nof keeping your data secure,\n\n57\n00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.950\nas we've already talked about,\nas you said in previous episodes.\n\n58\n00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:44.980\nWhen it comes to storage and,\n\n59\n00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.270\nespecially, removable drive types,\nthat we're gonna talk about.\n\n60\n00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.050\nThings that you can take with you,\nthey become easy to lose, easy for\n\n61\n00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.410\nsomebody to steal.\n\n62\n00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.280\nAnd if we're relying on strictly\npermissions, that's not gonna be enough.\n\n63\n00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.280\nBecause once it leaves that windows\noperating system, there's too many\n\n64\n00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.220\nways to get around permissions\n&gt;&gt; Moving it to a file system that doesn't\n\n65\n00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.660\nhave the same set of permissions,\nyou know other techniques people use.\n\n66\n00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.330\nIf it's encrypted,\nwhether you have permission or\n\n67\n00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.750\nnot if you don't have the permission\nkeys you're not gonna get access to it.\n\n68\n00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.320\nSo I can encrypt that thumb drive,\nleave it in the back of the cab.\n\n69\n00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.480\nSomebody can grab it,\nthey can plug it into their computer and\n\n70\n00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.353\nthey're not gonna be able to get\naccess to that data very easily.\n\n71\n00:03:24.353 --> 00:03:26.860\nIt's most likely gonna be not\nworth their time and effort.\n\n72\n00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.220\nBecause trying to break\nencryption is very difficult.\n\n73\n00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.010\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, so what are the storage\ndevices that we're talking about?\n\n74\n00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.970\nWell there are different technologies that\nwe've had, some we don't even use anymore.\n\n75\n00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.780\nSome that we've been using for\na while and will continue to use.\n\n76\n00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.900\nBut let's go ahead and talk, some of them\nwe're gonna be required on this exam for\n\n77\n00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.290\nyou to understand them.\n\n78\n00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.600\nA couple that I'm gonna mention,\n\n79\n00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.790\nthey don't even call them\nout of the objectives.\n\n80\n00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.590\nBut they're one of the most common\nstorage medium types today,\n\n81\n00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.690\nso I really need to mention it.\n\n82\n00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.380\nFirst I'm gonna talk about\nthe internal disks that we have, and\n\n83\n00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.440\nwhat kind of interfaces and\ntechnologies do we see there.\n\n84\n00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.790\nWell, I don't really expect you\nto see this one on the exam.\n\n85\n00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.410\nBecause, if you do see this one on\nthe exam, chances are that people need to\n\n86\n00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.840\nupgrade their computers if\nthey're gonna move to Windows 10.\n\n87\n00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.600\nAnd I'm talking about the old IDE drives,\nright, parallel ATA.\n\n88\n00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.740\nWell, this was a drive technology that was\na goes back to the earliest days of PC.\n\n89\n00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.780\nIn fact, that's where it gets it's name,\nadvanced technology attachment.\n\n90\n00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.110\nWe would attach it to the very first\nearliest motherboards in the PC industry.\n\n91\n00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.510\nHowever, we moved away from that, because\nit definitely had parallel interfaces.\n\n92\n00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.920\nIt suffered from all kinds of things.\n\n93\n00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.970\nSo what we use primarily today,\n\n94\n00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.694\nit's the serial ATA drives when\nit comes to our workstations.\n\n95\n00:04:31.694 --> 00:04:35.320\nThat's really the MTA we talk\nwhen we talk about Windows\n\n96\n00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.140\noperating system fundamentals.\n\n97\n00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.770\nA lot of time when you\ntalk about a client,\n\n98\n00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.862\nthat's all you're going to be dealing\nwith, with the serial ATA drives.\n\n99\n00:04:41.862 --> 00:04:45.310\nNow, the exception, Mike has already\nmentioned removable drives, right?\n\n100\n00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.870\nThere's a couple of technologies that\nwe can use for removable drives.\n\n101\n00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.770\nAnd it really depends on what\nfunctionality do you have on\n\n102\n00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.690\nyour system unit as to which of these\nthat you're gonna choose, all right?\n\n103\n00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.380\nMost common, I think Mike, I think\nyou already mentioned that, is USB.\n\n104\n00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.430\nUSB interface has been around for\nawhile, it goes all the way back to,\n\n105\n00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.340\nI think it was 1.1 was one\nof the first widely adopted.\n\n106\n00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.330\nThere was an earlier version there, but\nit was still kinda being developed.\n\n107\n00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.580\nWe didn't really get on the bandwagon.\n\n108\n00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.832\nGoes back to 1.1, watch out now.\n\n109\n00:05:14.832 --> 00:05:19.750\nVersion 1.1,\nwe had 12 megabit transfer speeds.\n\n110\n00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.220\n&gt;&gt; That's right, 12 megabits.\n\n111\n00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.400\n&gt;&gt; But then we also had USB 2.0, right?\n\n112\n00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.960\nAnd that fast,\nI think they call it fast USB.\n\n113\n00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.260\nThis was the standard for\na very long time,\n\n114\n00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.810\ncuz it was 480 megabit transfer speeds,\nso pretty good jump.\n\n115\n00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:39.430\nNow what we have today is USB 3.0 and\n3.1 is out there, too.\n\n116\n00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.070\nThese are just some pretty\nmind-boggling speeds.\n\n117\n00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.412\nWe're talking 5 gigabit transfer speed,\ntheoretically,\n\n118\n00:05:47.412 --> 00:05:49.349\nwhether you get into performance.\n\n119\n00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:53.668\nTheoretical standards don't necessarily\nmatch up to the actual throughput you get\n\n120\n00:05:53.668 --> 00:05:54.468\non the device.\n\n121\n00:05:54.468 --> 00:05:57.782\nBut, in theory, you could get up to\n5 gigabit transfer speeds for USB 3,\n\n122\n00:05:57.782 --> 00:05:58.734\n3.1 is out there.\n\n123\n00:05:58.734 --> 00:06:01.083\nAnd let's trying to keep\nup with Thunderbolt and\n\n124\n00:06:01.083 --> 00:06:03.390\nthat's a 10 gig transfer speed.\n\n125\n00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.635\nWhen it comes to the devices, well,\nwe usually use our external drives.\n\n126\n00:06:07.635 --> 00:06:10.940\nThese are storage devices\nthat we plug in to USB port.\n\n127\n00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.770\nAnd because of that fact that\nthe commonality of USB ports.\n\n128\n00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.420\nAnd we typically have a lot of\nthem on even a basic system.\n\n129\n00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.800\nThat's what makes them so common, right?\n\n130\n00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.660\nIt makes them so prevalent,\nit makes them very easy.\n\n131\n00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.700\nIn fact, Mike and I,\nI know we've used them on many occasions.\n\n132\n00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.020\nMike, you got that Server 2016 ISO?\n\n133\n00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.870\nIn fact,\nI was just asking him that last week, and,\n\n134\n00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.080\nat least, in relation to the time\nthat we're recording that.\n\n135\n00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.020\nHe's like yeah, I got that on the drive\nhere, well it makes it so easy, right?\n\n136\n00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.680\nI don't have to try to figure out how\nto connect to his computer, he doesn't.\n\n137\n00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.490\nNow that you can really do this,\ncuz files can tend to be really large,\n\n138\n00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.680\nI don't have to worry about emailing,\nall right?\n\n139\n00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.110\nHe's got his drive,\nI walk over to my machine, I plug it in,\n\n140\n00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.370\nand I have access to his files, right?\n\n141\n00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.530\nWell that's also where\nBitLocker to go comes in.\n\n142\n00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.250\nAnd that's one of the things that we have\nto keep in mind when it comes to security\n\n143\n00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.370\ntechniques.\n\n144\n00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.935\nUnderstanding encryption in the context of\nUSB is the technology called BitLocker to\n\n145\n00:06:59.935 --> 00:07:04.590\ng,o which allows me to\nencrypt removal devices.\n\n146\n00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:09.350\nNow there is another one that's\nalso plug and play capable, right?\n\n147\n00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:14.630\nWe plug it in externally,\nnot quite as common as USB,\n\n148\n00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.330\nbut still a very, very good technology.\n\n149\n00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.190\nAnd that's called eSATA right,\n\n150\n00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:22.710\nserial ATA is the internal\ndisks that we typically use.\n\n151\n00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.550\nHowever, when I plug in a USB device,\n\n152\n00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.210\nit has to have what's known as a USB\ncontroller, right, a host bus controller.\n\n153\n00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:33.000\nAnd a lot of times today with\nUSB being as fast as it is,\n\n154\n00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.340\nwe don't really notice too much.\n\n155\n00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.810\nBut when USB wasn't quite as fast as\nit was today eSATA really was a very,\n\n156\n00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:40.850\nvery good technology.\n\n157\n00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:46.940\nAnd, for the most part, still is, because\nit's internal SATA to external SATA.\n\n158\n00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.790\nWhat's going on there\nis the same controller.\n\n159\n00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:52.970\nWe don't have any of this translation\nspeed, so a one-to-one transfer,\n\n160\n00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.672\nthere's no translation in the middle.\n\n161\n00:07:54.672 --> 00:07:57.704\nAny time you don't have an interpreter or\na translator of some sort,\n\n162\n00:07:57.704 --> 00:07:59.391\nyou're saving yourself CPU cycles.\n\n163\n00:07:59.391 --> 00:08:03.592\nHowever, That might have been\nsomething you would say 10 years ago.\n\n164\n00:08:03.592 --> 00:08:07.976\nI'm not so sure that it's really relevant\ntoday in the fact that we have so\n\n165\n00:08:07.976 --> 00:08:12.431\nmany fast drives out there that are really\ntransferring over a very fast USB\n\n166\n00:08:12.431 --> 00:08:13.221\ninterface.\n\n167\n00:08:13.221 --> 00:08:15.598\nNow here's an oldy but goody.\n\n168\n00:08:15.598 --> 00:08:19.150\nWe're going way back,\nyeah way back, right?\n\n169\n00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:25.310\nWe're talking about the IEEE1384 man you\ngotta love standards those are always fun.\n\n170\n00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:31.107\nSo what do we have with IEEE 1394 that\nyou might recognize it by a marketing\n\n171\n00:08:31.107 --> 00:08:37.003\nname called Firewire however,\nwhat's this FireWire versus IEEE 1394?\n\n172\n00:08:37.003 --> 00:08:39.054\nWell not really too much.\n\n173\n00:08:39.054 --> 00:08:44.011\nSee when FireWire first came out really\none of the biggest proponents in\n\n174\n00:08:44.011 --> 00:08:45.890\ndeveloping was Apple.\n\n175\n00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.360\nI mean there were other people too,\nit was really a collection of companies.\n\n176\n00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:53.400\nBut Apple really got spearhead of\nthe movement forward on this so\n\n177\n00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.890\nthey took a marketing\nname called FireWire,\n\n178\n00:08:55.890 --> 00:09:00.240\nhowever, one of the things that we\nwere doing in those early and mid 80s,\n\n179\n00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.350\nwhich is something that we all benefit\nstill today from is standardization right?\n\n180\n00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:08.270\nThey hand the standard over,\nand all the collective groups,\n\n181\n00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:13.530\nif you will, release it as IEEE,\nstandard 1394 it's FireWire.\n\n182\n00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.390\nSo that's essentially\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n183\n00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.070\nNot so\ncommon to have that port on your machines.\n\n184\n00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:18.845\nIt doesn't mean that it's not there.\n\n185\n00:09:18.845 --> 00:09:22.639\nDoesn't mean you can't add\nthe functionality by expansion cards for\n\n186\n00:09:22.639 --> 00:09:26.570\ncertain, but for the most part,\nUSB has kind of become more prevalent.\n\n187\n00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:29.850\nAnd even, I know this isn't a Mac show,\nbut even in the Mac world today, you're\n\n188\n00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:33.580\nseeing less and less firewire ports for\nsubstitution of what we call Thunderbolt.\n\n189\n00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.361\nSo Thunderbolt's another technology,\nguys it isn't on this exam.\n\n190\n00:09:36.361 --> 00:09:39.567\nBut we really wouldn't be doing you\njustice if we were just telling you about\n\n191\n00:09:39.567 --> 00:09:42.322\ntechnologies that were 20 years\nago when they first started and\n\n192\n00:09:42.322 --> 00:09:43.641\nnow they've kind of matured.\n\n193\n00:09:43.641 --> 00:09:46.211\nSo there are some new\ntechnologies out there as well.\n\n194\n00:09:46.211 --> 00:09:52.810\nNow what if I need to connect to\na storage area network, how do I do that?\n\n195\n00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:55.003\nAbout $70,000 is how you do that.\n\n196\n00:09:55.003 --> 00:09:56.953\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You set up a storage array,\n\n197\n00:09:56.953 --> 00:10:01.355\nyou lay your switch fabric, you lay your\nfiber right and you set up your lawns,\n\n198\n00:10:01.355 --> 00:10:05.176\nlawn masking and now for\n$70,000 you can attach to that SAN.\n\n199\n00:10:05.176 --> 00:10:08.956\nOr at least the fiber optic cable\nbetween your $5,000 adapter and\n\n200\n00:10:08.956 --> 00:10:10.598\nwhat's in the server closet.\n\n201\n00:10:10.598 --> 00:10:14.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or, [LAUGH] Since we\n\n202\n00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:19.200\nalready had typically ethernet networks\nin place, TCP/IP based network remember\n\n203\n00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:24.070\nit stepped on top of ethernet but commonly\nthat's what we had, TCP/IP based networks.\n\n204\n00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:26.738\nWhat if I want a way that I can\nconnect to a storage area network but\n\n205\n00:10:26.738 --> 00:10:29.951\nI don't wanna have to spend a thousands\nof dollars to my little old company and\n\n206\n00:10:29.951 --> 00:10:30.953\nwe can't afford that.\n\n207\n00:10:30.953 --> 00:10:33.925\nWell, I can use something known\nas Internet scuzzy, iSCSI,\n\n208\n00:10:33.925 --> 00:10:37.240\nas you've commonly called it,\nor heard it called, right?\n\n209\n00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.237\nAnd you have in your client, built in,\nan iSCSI client it's call the iSCSI\n\n210\n00:10:41.237 --> 00:10:45.365\nInitiator, and really what it does is\nit allows me, from my Windows client,\n\n211\n00:10:45.365 --> 00:10:48.474\nif I wanna put in one of those\nexpensive host bus adapters,\n\n212\n00:10:48.474 --> 00:10:52.372\nor for that part, I don't even have\nthat expansion slot on my computer.\n\n213\n00:10:52.372 --> 00:10:56.794\nIt allows me the ability to send\ntraditional SCSI commands over TCP/IP base\n\n214\n00:10:56.794 --> 00:11:01.840\nnetwork, to that storage area network or\nthat storage right that's gonna understand\n\n215\n00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:06.910\nand give me the ability to work with\nthat storage, so that's another one.\n\n216\n00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:11.496\nLike I said more common better performance\nis gonna be doing the traditional hardware\n\n217\n00:11:11.496 --> 00:11:16.360\nbased SCSI implementations but let's face\nits not every company has $70,000, and\n\n218\n00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.500\nthose are cheap ones.\n\n219\n00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.321\nThose are the cheap ones\nthey only go up from there.\n\n220\n00:11:21.321 --> 00:11:24.920\nSo that's another technology\nthat's out there.\n\n221\n00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.790\nNext we have one that they call out but\nit's not really popular.\n\n222\n00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:31.141\nBut they call it out so\nwe want you to know and that's InfiniBand.\n\n223\n00:11:31.141 --> 00:11:35.757\nInfiniBand's been around for a little\nbit it uses either copper media, or\n\n224\n00:11:35.757 --> 00:11:37.930\nit uses fiber optic media.\n\n225\n00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:42.793\nIf it uses fiber optic media then much\nlike a fibre channel it can span up to\n\n226\n00:11:42.793 --> 00:11:44.562\nten kilometers, right?\n\n227\n00:11:44.562 --> 00:11:49.964\nSo was that 10000 meters if I\ngot my distance units right?\n\n228\n00:11:49.964 --> 00:11:54.565\nSo 10000 meters, now copper like most\noccasions unless it's a PSTN line\n\n229\n00:11:54.565 --> 00:11:58.480\nusually reduces the length that\nit can be it's about 30 meters.\n\n230\n00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.070\nSo it does go over copper,\n\n231\n00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:05.170\nit does go over fibre its got its\nown protocols and infrastructure.\n\n232\n00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:06.620\nReally, I just wanna\nkinda give you an idea.\n\n233\n00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:10.390\nWe're talking upwards of 25\ngigabit transfer speeds, right?\n\n234\n00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:12.350\nSo very, very fast, right?\n\n235\n00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:15.166\nBut more common today is gonna\nbe your storage area networks.\n\n236\n00:12:15.166 --> 00:12:19.350\nIf you start getting into fiber optics and\nspeed like that, but it is out there.\n\n237\n00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:22.491\nIt also applies things kinda like your\nPCI E bus does on your computers.\n\n238\n00:12:22.491 --> 00:12:27.292\nWhere I have a link, a lane if you will,\nand then I can aggregate the links and\n\n239\n00:12:27.292 --> 00:12:31.580\nthe more links I have by just double\nthe throughput as I add up links.\n\n240\n00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.810\nWell, that's the same thing\nthat InfiniBand does.\n\n241\n00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:36.592\nSo Mike, those are some of\nthe physical devices that we have and\n\n242\n00:12:36.592 --> 00:12:40.111\nyou gotta kinda understand what are the\noptions that you have when you're gonna\n\n243\n00:12:40.111 --> 00:12:42.648\nstart plugging these devices\nin your Windows machines.\n\n244\n00:12:42.648 --> 00:12:46.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when you talk about all these,\nthese are connection types, aren't they?\n\n245\n00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:47.240\nI mean, when I go and\n\n246\n00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:51.430\nlook At that physical hard drive\nthere's a couple of different sizes.\n\n247\n00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:55.231\nAbout three and a half, two and\na half and then USB and stuff like that.\n\n248\n00:12:55.231 --> 00:12:59.884\nBut, really, we're talking about how I'm\ngonna connect that cuz an iSCSI drive\n\n249\n00:12:59.884 --> 00:13:04.402\nwhere actually it will be virtual but,\nsay a iSCSI drive versus a I don't know,\n\n250\n00:13:04.402 --> 00:13:08.583\nIDE drive versus a beta drive, I mean,\nthey're all the same, except for\n\n251\n00:13:08.583 --> 00:13:09.880\nthe connectors on it.\n\n252\n00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.090\nSo that's what we're talking about here,\n\n253\n00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:14.820\nis how do I connect this storage device to\nthe computer so it can access the data?\n\n254\n00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.668\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and that connection\ninterface is gonna be something that's\n\n255\n00:13:17.668 --> 00:13:20.426\nvery, very important to understand\nbecause, the way I might implement,\n\n256\n00:13:20.426 --> 00:13:22.775\nlet's take security that we were\njust talking about briefly.\n\n257\n00:13:22.775 --> 00:13:26.066\nThe way I implement BitLocker on\nan internal drive is not going to be,\n\n258\n00:13:26.066 --> 00:13:29.811\nwell it's gonna be close to the same\nprocedure, but it is gonna be different so\n\n259\n00:13:29.811 --> 00:13:31.320\nwe do have to keep that in mind.\n\n260\n00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:35.054\nSo that's a little bit about\nthe physical devices themselves.\n\n261\n00:13:35.054 --> 00:13:38.036\nLet's talk a little bit\nabout the logical aspect and\n\n262\n00:13:38.036 --> 00:13:41.848\nhow we apply a file system if you will,\nor even why we would do this.\n\n263\n00:13:41.848 --> 00:13:44.537\nNow storage media by itself,\nwe can't really use it.\n\n264\n00:13:44.537 --> 00:13:47.475\nIt's kinda like having a file\ncabinet you take all the drawers and\n\n265\n00:13:47.475 --> 00:13:49.410\nrails out and\nyou got an empty shell right.\n\n266\n00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:51.380\nAnd I can't really use that, right.\n\n267\n00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:55.316\nI have to be able to put well, the rails\nin right, I have to put the shelves in\n\n268\n00:13:55.316 --> 00:13:59.000\neach one shelve and I want get so\nmany shelves like in you and I can't add\n\n269\n00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.588\nanother one unless I start, I don't know\nadding metal and I'm not metal fabricator.\n\n270\n00:14:03.588 --> 00:14:06.995\n[LAUGH] But you'll notice that there\nare some things that we have to do.\n\n271\n00:14:06.995 --> 00:14:10.230\nThere's a structure to a firing carb and\nthat has to be there in order for\n\n272\n00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.910\nus to use it.\n\n273\n00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:13.366\nAnd that's the same thing that\nwe have with hard drives.\n\n274\n00:14:13.366 --> 00:14:16.010\nSo inside of Windows, what do we have?\n\n275\n00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:19.080\nWell, we've got what are known\nas basic disks, all right.\n\n276\n00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.010\nA basic disk really follows, by default,\n\n277\n00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:27.070\nthe traditional MBR,\nMaster Boot Record, structure.\n\n278\n00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:29.054\nAnd what that means is we\nreally have some limitations.\n\n279\n00:14:29.054 --> 00:14:31.831\nAll right, we have inside of basic disks,\n\n280\n00:14:31.831 --> 00:14:34.851\nwe have what are known\nas primary partitions.\n\n281\n00:14:34.851 --> 00:14:38.538\nWe can have a couple different types\nof partitions, we can have a primary\n\n282\n00:14:38.538 --> 00:14:41.874\npartition and we can have what\nare known as extended partitions.\n\n283\n00:14:41.874 --> 00:14:46.342\nBecause in the days of the master boot\nrecord, which we still use, it's been\n\n284\n00:14:46.342 --> 00:14:50.741\naround for a while, it had a limitation\nand that was you can only have primary\n\n285\n00:14:50.741 --> 00:14:55.594\npartitions on a storage device that was\nconfigured with master boot record right?\n\n286\n00:14:55.594 --> 00:14:58.927\nLet me kinda show you what I mean in\nfact we talked a lot about it let me go\n\n287\n00:14:58.927 --> 00:15:01.124\nahead and\nshow you guys some things here too.\n\n288\n00:15:01.124 --> 00:15:04.107\nIf I jump into this machine right here and\n\n289\n00:15:04.107 --> 00:15:09.043\nI launch up disk management,\nall right, and I'm gonna go ahead.\n\n290\n00:15:09.043 --> 00:15:12.499\nAnd notice that right away,\nI've got the ability to initiate or\n\n291\n00:15:12.499 --> 00:15:15.188\ninitialize these disks,\nbringing them online.\n\n292\n00:15:15.188 --> 00:15:19.880\nAnd I have to apply a partitioning style\nto them Before I can ever use them, right?\n\n293\n00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.040\nI have to put the racks in the cabinet,\n\n294\n00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.690\nthe filing cabinet before I\neven start putting shelves.\n\n295\n00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:28.900\nConsider your shelves the partitions,\nand what I choose here defines how many\n\n296\n00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.880\npartitions I can put on\nthat storage device.\n\n297\n00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.367\nSo the first thing we do\nis we make this choice.\n\n298\n00:15:33.367 --> 00:15:36.060\nNow the other one's GPT\ngood partition table,\n\n299\n00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:39.029\nthese are not just Windows\nplease understand that.\n\n300\n00:15:39.029 --> 00:15:41.256\nThis is not proprietary to\nWindows we have been using these,\n\n301\n00:15:41.256 --> 00:15:42.620\nthese are industry wide standards.\n\n302\n00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.958\nNow the GPT is a little bit different.\n\n303\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:48.745\nIt gets around some of the limitations\nthat we find here in the traditional\n\n304\n00:15:48.745 --> 00:15:52.614\nmaster boot record and the fact that I\ncan have a lot more partitions right?\n\n305\n00:15:52.614 --> 00:15:56.486\nThe other thing is too the GUI partition\ntable is redundant in the fact that it\n\n306\n00:15:56.486 --> 00:15:57.770\nkeeps multiple copies.\n\n307\n00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:01.452\nSo if one gets corrupted Well,\nI could still boot from the other one.\n\n308\n00:16:01.452 --> 00:16:05.340\nMaster boot record gets corrupted,\nand the whole entire system stops.\n\n309\n00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:08.610\nSo there are benefits from MBR over GPT.\n\n310\n00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:11.050\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead,\nand I'll choose MBR here.\n\n311\n00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:12.980\nAll right.\n\n312\n00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.210\nWe'll bring these online.\n\n313\n00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:18.200\nNow, notice that this says this\nis a basic disk, all right?\n\n314\n00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.690\nSo what basically,\nwhat can I do with this disk?\n\n315\n00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:22.610\nLet's go ahead and show you.\n\n316\n00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:25.230\nRemember one of the things I told you,\nPrimary Partition.\n\n317\n00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:27.450\nWhat's the definition\nof a Primary Partition?\n\n318\n00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:30.890\nWell, Primary Partition is one\nthat holds a filing system.\n\n319\n00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:35.750\nYou might see them represented inside of\nthe operating system as a simple volume.\n\n320\n00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:36.990\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n321\n00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:38.620\nIn fact, if I right-click on this and\n\n322\n00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:42.540\nI decide,\nthat I wanna choose a New Simple Volume.\n\n323\n00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.250\nAll right we can choose that all right.\n\n324\n00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:49.300\nAnd essentially what I'm gonna do is I'm\njust gonna create a very small partition\n\n325\n00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:53.280\nhere and again you gonna see that it will\nbecome a volume once I attach a mount\n\n326\n00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.030\npoint to it we do this\nanother operating systems.\n\n327\n00:16:56.030 --> 00:17:00.520\nI attach a letter to it a drive letter to\nit if you will and now it's kinda like\n\n328\n00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.110\nhaving a house with a front door\nthat I can actually walk in and use.\n\n329\n00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.155\nSo we'll go ahead and we will choose Next.\n\n330\n00:17:05.155 --> 00:17:10.102\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nreduce this in the size,\n\n331\n00:17:10.102 --> 00:17:15.408\nI'm gonna cut it in half,\nI'm gonna show you what we can and\n\n332\n00:17:15.408 --> 00:17:19.050\ncan't do here, we'll choose Next.\n\n333\n00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:21.810\nAll right, now I get to assign\nit a drive letter, right?\n\n334\n00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:24.440\nAnd this is gonna give me\nthe ability to mount the drive and\n\n335\n00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.360\nactually store data in it.\n\n336\n00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:30.340\nLike I said, if I don't mount this drive,\nI've created the container, but\n\n337\n00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:33.160\nit's kinda like having a house\nwithout any doors or windows.\n\n338\n00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.175\nI can't go inside.\n\n339\n00:17:34.175 --> 00:17:35.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, we'll go ahead and\n\n340\n00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:38.150\nwe'll choose, the letter.\n\n341\n00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.420\nNow this next interface here.\n\n342\n00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.082\nWrong person to have hosting with me.\n\n343\n00:17:42.082 --> 00:17:44.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because we might do battle after this\n\n344\n00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:46.350\nbefore we go into the next explanation.\n\n345\n00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:49.370\nSee what we have here and\nit's not the formatting.\n\n346\n00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:52.340\nWe have to apply a logical structure and\nthat's the file system right.\n\n347\n00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:53.840\nAnd we have a couple of options.\n\n348\n00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.315\nWe got NTFS and we got FAT32.\n\n349\n00:17:55.315 --> 00:18:00.260\nMost of the time, most of the time\nyou're gonna be running NTFS.\n\n350\n00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:03.110\nIn a Windows environment that one\nsituation that I can think of\n\n351\n00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:06.695\nwhere you had to format in FAT32 and\nit was an external drive,\n\n352\n00:18:06.695 --> 00:18:09.750\nbecause you wanted to make it bootable for\nlike deployment.\n\n353\n00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:11.420\nYou had to use FAT32 for that.\n\n354\n00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:16.446\nIt's really the only example I can give\nyou of when you would use that over NTFS.\n\n355\n00:18:16.446 --> 00:18:19.240\nAlways use NTFS, it get the benefits\nof permission, the encryption,\n\n356\n00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.790\nand compression,\nwe've talked about in other episodes.\n\n357\n00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:27.155\nNow, here's what Mike and I might\ndisagree a little bit, and tell you what?\n\n358\n00:18:27.155 --> 00:18:28.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He's actually converted me,\n\n359\n00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:31.510\nI have to give him profits for\nthis, I would always be like, okay,\n\n360\n00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:34.840\nI'm gonna do my data volume,\nI'm gonna call it data, now,\n\n361\n00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.230\nI know it's that data volume, all right.\n\n362\n00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:39.320\nYou technically can leave that blank.\n\n363\n00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.400\nYou don't have to change it.\n\n364\n00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.100\nAnd you can actually erase it, all right.\n\n365\n00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:43.600\nI'm gonna go ahead.\n\n366\n00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.560\nAnd I'm gonna take\nthe Mike Rodrick approach and\n\n367\n00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:49.750\nsay, well, I don't need a volume label,\ncuz I got a drive letter.\n\n368\n00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:50.830\nWhy do I need a volume letter?\n\n369\n00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:53.260\nI could see its D or in this case F.\n\n370\n00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:55.900\nSo we'll choose Next,\nhere's your review string,\n\n371\n00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:58.280\nnotice it says completing\nthe simple volume wizard, right?\n\n372\n00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:01.350\nIt's gonna become a volume once I\ncan work with and I can use it,\n\n373\n00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:01.990\nwe'll choose Finish.\n\n374\n00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.480\nAll right, so here we go All right.\n\n375\n00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:12.630\nWe've got Disk 3, it's got a healthy\nprimary partition, all right,\n\n376\n00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:15.310\nand notice that it's got\nthe drive letter up here.\n\n377\n00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:17.260\n&gt;&gt; F.\n&gt;&gt; Now, notice that it doesn't say system\n\n378\n00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:17.890\nreserved, or\n\n379\n00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:20.880\nin this case storage space, because\nI've got a storage space built here.\n\n380\n00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.616\nAnd sometimes you'll se\nC is just local diskC.\n\n381\n00:19:23.616 --> 00:19:26.660\nRight, that's why they\nlabeled it that way.\n\n382\n00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:28.290\nYou don't have to actually label it.\n\n383\n00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:34.460\nBut now, if I look and\nclose down OneDrive here, I can see\n\n384\n00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:38.490\nin file explorer that I've got the ability\nthat I can work with this drive now.\n\n385\n00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:40.600\nNotice I have Local Disk F.\n\n386\n00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:45.021\nIt looks no different than the default\ninstallation that happens on Local Disk C.\n\n387\n00:19:45.021 --> 00:19:50.822\nI now have the ability, if I want,\nto create and store files.\n\n388\n00:19:50.822 --> 00:19:55.016\nNow I did tell you that there as\na limitation, here, all right?\n\n389\n00:19:55.016 --> 00:19:57.653\nSo lets see what is that limitation.\n\n390\n00:19:57.653 --> 00:20:00.567\nRemember that there's a four-primary\npartition limitation on basic disks,\n\n391\n00:20:00.567 --> 00:20:01.618\nlike we're talking about.\n\n392\n00:20:01.618 --> 00:20:04.879\nLet me show you that,\nin fact we'll do simple volume.\n\n393\n00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.280\nLet's see.\nI'll cut that in half.\n\n394\n00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.645\nWhat is that?\n\n395\n00:20:09.645 --> 00:20:10.760\n5000.\nWhat was that?\n\n396\n00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.850\nDo you know your binary bits?\n\n397\n00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:13.680\nI'll tell you what.\n\n398\n00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.442\n&gt;&gt; 5190.\n\n399\n00:20:14.442 --> 00:20:17.590\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go ahead,\nand I'm as good as math.\n\n400\n00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:19.080\nYou're better at math than me.\n\n401\n00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:19.642\nI'll just go ahead.\n\n402\n00:20:19.642 --> 00:20:22.115\nI'm gonna say it easy,\nmake it we'll go base 10.\n\n403\n00:20:22.115 --> 00:20:24.030\n105,000.\nThat makes it easy for me.\n\n404\n00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:26.490\nAnd we'll call this letter G.\n\n405\n00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.430\nDrive letter G.\nWe'll keep it at the default.\n\n406\n00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:31.332\nWe're not gonna do any volume labelling.\n\n407\n00:20:31.332 --> 00:20:32.690\n.Okay, so now I have two.\n\n408\n00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.850\nAll right, so now, let's keep going.\n\n409\n00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:40.120\nLet's see how far we can go and see if\nthere's any limitations to a basic disk.\n\n410\n00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.080\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n411\n00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.456\nI'm gonna get really small because\nthese are easy for me to count.\n\n412\n00:20:43.456 --> 00:20:43.991\nI'll do 1024.\n\n413\n00:20:43.991 --> 00:20:45.145\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n414\n00:20:45.145 --> 00:20:48.770\nI'm gonna do a whole\nwork in 1 Gig partition.\n\n415\n00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:49.500\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n416\n00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.120\n&gt;&gt; All right what's up there guys.\n\n417\n00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:54.315\nYou can even store a movie in it.\n\n418\n00:20:54.315 --> 00:20:55.505\n[LAUGH] And now we're three.\n\n419\n00:20:55.505 --> 00:20:57.020\nRight?\nLet;s go ahead.\n\n420\n00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:57.760\nLet's try it again.\n\n421\n00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.920\nWe'll do four, all right.\n\n422\n00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:05.240\nWe gonna do one more here with\na 1024 without any commas in it.\n\n423\n00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:08.750\nThis will be drive letter I\nbecause I'm creative, and\n\n424\n00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:11.530\nwe'll take the volume label out.\n\n425\n00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.150\nAll right.\n\n426\n00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:16.190\nWhat's happening here?\n\n427\n00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:17.610\n&gt;&gt; Good old Windows is\ntrying to help you out and\n\n428\n00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:19.090\nprotect you from yourself isn't it?\n\n429\n00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:20.120\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n430\n00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.080\nMike got it right away.\n\n431\n00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.245\nHe's been doing this for a while.\n\n432\n00:21:22.245 --> 00:21:24.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Notice what happened here and\n\n433\n00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.820\nit's good to know your color coding.\n\n434\n00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.950\nAnd I tell anybody that\nit's gonna be in an exam.\n\n435\n00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:31.940\nKnow your color coding cuz you never know\nwhen they're gonna show you the color.\n\n436\n00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.800\nBut they're not gonna tell you\nany of this great information\n\n437\n00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.300\nthat Windows gets right here.\n\n438\n00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.840\nWhat happens is, I told you there\nwere four partition limitations.\n\n439\n00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.370\nThat's technically not accurate.\n\n440\n00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:44.310\nThere are four primary\npartition limitation.\n\n441\n00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:47.395\nBut they made a way that you\ncan kinda get around that.\n\n442\n00:21:47.395 --> 00:21:49.715\nAnd that's where the term logical\nvolumes comes into play, and\n\n443\n00:21:49.715 --> 00:21:51.635\nyou should really know this for the exam.\n\n444\n00:21:51.635 --> 00:21:55.205\nNotice that when I went to make\nthe third partition, all right, or\n\n445\n00:21:55.205 --> 00:21:56.655\nthe fourth partition in this case.\n\n446\n00:21:56.655 --> 00:21:58.095\nThank you there, sir.\n\n447\n00:21:58.095 --> 00:22:01.675\nIt said, well, it didn't tell me anything.\n\n448\n00:22:01.675 --> 00:22:03.135\nMike said, on my behalf, it helped me out.\n\n449\n00:22:03.135 --> 00:22:06.680\nAnd it made what's known\nas a extended partition.\n\n450\n00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:11.710\nSo one of the things that they allow you\nto do is create what the remaining space.\n\n451\n00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:15.860\nThis well it is a partition and\ninside of that partition we could start\n\n452\n00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:19.310\ndividing up logical containers\nthey call them logical volumes but\n\n453\n00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:24.180\nthink about it as no different than (G:)\n(H:) (F:) or even (C:) for that matter.\n\n454\n00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:27.140\nBut it allows me to use that space,\nI think of it this way if I have\n\n455\n00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:30.226\na building that has four\ndifferent offices in it, right?\n\n456\n00:22:30.226 --> 00:22:34.690\nThink of your four primary partitions,\nI decided that 4th office I'm gonna change\n\n457\n00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:37.220\nit around, I'm gonna let a few different\ntenants in there, I'm gonna put little\n\n458\n00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:40.840\ncubicles in there and each one of those\ncubicles is now for those tenants right?\n\n459\n00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:44.020\nI still have the four rooms but\none of these rooms I was a little bit\n\n460\n00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.340\nmore efficient at, and\nI divided it up a little better.\n\n461\n00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:51.220\nSo, it allows me to get around that\npoor primary partition limitation.\n\n462\n00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:55.020\nAll right, so that's kind of a,\nit's not really a data hack.\n\n463\n00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:59.550\nIt's not really a hack if you will, but\nI guess that Windows, Microsoft found\n\n464\n00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:02.410\na creative wy to get around\na limitation that's been around there.\n\n465\n00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:03.435\nFor a very long time.\n\n466\n00:23:03.435 --> 00:23:04.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well Mike,\n\n467\n00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:09.130\nI've got a bunch more to go sir but I know\nthat he's over here looking at me say,\n\n468\n00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:10.690\nhey man, I see what we got to go and\n\n469\n00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:12.671\nI don't think we're gonna\nget it in this episode so.\n\n470\n00:23:12.671 --> 00:23:14.445\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're probably gonna have to go\n\n471\n00:23:14.445 --> 00:23:14.987\ninto part two.\n\n472\n00:23:14.987 --> 00:23:15.924\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a plan Wess.\n\n473\n00:23:15.924 --> 00:23:18.610\nGreat look there,\nintroduction to understanding storage.\n\n474\n00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:22.140\nLooking at the different connection\ntypes that we have or available storage.\n\n475\n00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:25.720\nAnd then we started getting into some of\nthe different partitioning styles that we\n\n476\n00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.230\ncan apply and as Wess said.\n\n477\n00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:29.660\nWe've got a few more to go over so\nyou're gonna have to come back and\n\n478\n00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:30.620\njoin us for a part two.\n\n479\n00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:33.450\nFor now, hope everybody enjoyed\nwatching this one signing off\n\n480\n00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:35.450\nITProTV I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n481\n00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:36.220\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wess Brian.\n\n482\n00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.440\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n483\n00:23:38.440 -->

00:00:08.269\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.501\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.501 --> 00:00:12.344\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\n\n6\n00:00:12.344 --> 00:00:15.127\nWelcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.127 --> 00:00:16.853\nI'm your host, Mike Roderick.\n\n8\n00:00:16.853 --> 00:00:19.797\nAnd today, we're doing our Windows\noperating system fundamentals.\n\n9\n00:00:19.797 --> 00:00:21.711\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n10\n00:00:21.711 --> 00:00:25.370\nwe're gonna be continuing our\nlook at understanding storage.\n\n11\n00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.731\nAnd here to do that for\nus is Mr Wes Bryan, how are you doing Wes?\n\n12\n00:00:27.731 --> 00:00:29.867\n&gt;&gt; Man, I'm doing great,\nit's always good to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:29.867 --> 00:00:32.967\nThat's right, we had a little bit\nmore that we had to take care of.\n\n14\n00:00:32.967 --> 00:00:36.970\nSo we didn't get to take care of it\nin the first part of this episode.\n\n15\n00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.506\nHowever, I do wanna kinda recap.\n\n16\n00:00:38.506 --> 00:00:42.534\nIf you're just joining us now keep in\nmind there was a part 1, you can go back,\n\n17\n00:00:42.534 --> 00:00:45.293\njump back and join that and\nthen come back and join us.\n\n18\n00:00:45.293 --> 00:00:47.156\nBut if you're not going to do that and\n\n19\n00:00:47.156 --> 00:00:49.993\nyou're satisfied being here\nthen let's kinda recap.\n\n20\n00:00:49.993 --> 00:00:52.994\nIn the first part,\nwhat we talked about is just briefly,\n\n21\n00:00:52.994 --> 00:00:55.220\nwe talked a little bit about encryption.\n\n22\n00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.850\nWe talked about some of the storage type.\n\n23\n00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.565\nThe storage interfaces that you can\nsee inside of your systems today.\n\n24\n00:00:59.565 --> 00:01:02.650\nAnd then we rounded up\ntalking about basic disks.\n\n25\n00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.658\nAnd we showed some of the different\nthings that you shouldn't be aware of,\n\n26\n00:01:06.658 --> 00:01:08.380\nthe limitations, right?\n\n27\n00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.336\nTalked a little bit about MBR and\nGPT, the master boot record and\n\n28\n00:01:11.336 --> 00:01:12.788\nGUI partition table.\n\n29\n00:01:12.788 --> 00:01:18.149\nAnd the three primary partition\nlimitation with one extended or\n\n30\n00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:24.117\ntotal of four primary partitions\ndepending on how you like to set it up.\n\n31\n00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:27.276\nKeep in mind that Microsoft or\nWindows does like to help you out,\n\n32\n00:01:27.276 --> 00:01:30.609\nand it'll go ahead, and\nonce you hit that fourth partition, if you\n\n33\n00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:34.549\ntry to create a fifth one, it's gonna say,\nI know what you need to do here.\n\n34\n00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:36.735\nAnd it will create the extended partition,\n\n35\n00:01:36.735 --> 00:01:39.522\nwhich logical volumes will\nthen be applied after that.\n\n36\n00:01:39.522 --> 00:01:44.380\nSo that's a little bit about what we\nwere talking about in the first part.\n\n37\n00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.366\nWe wanna move into a different drive type,\nor disk type.\n\n38\n00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:51.380\nI gotta be careful because I know these\nterms can get blurred really quickly.\n\n39\n00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.325\nWe want to talk about another disk type,\nso\n\n40\n00:01:53.325 --> 00:01:56.082\nwe did talked about some of\nthe limitations to a basic disc and\n\n41\n00:01:56.082 --> 00:01:58.805\nit supports all your traditional\nfunctionality, right?\n\n42\n00:01:58.805 --> 00:02:02.511\nYou're not losing NTFS permissions,\nyou don't lose compression,\n\n43\n00:02:02.511 --> 00:02:06.024\nyou don't lose encryption,\nwe get all of the good stuff that we see\n\n44\n00:02:06.024 --> 00:02:08.849\ninside our Windows but it's,\nthe storage itself and\n\n45\n00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.218\nthe way the partitions are applied\nthat becomes a limitation.\n\n46\n00:02:12.218 --> 00:02:17.115\nNow the other thing is that\nwhen we look at dynamic disks\n\n47\n00:02:17.115 --> 00:02:22.226\nthey kind of help us to do or\ngive us an added set of features\n\n48\n00:02:22.226 --> 00:02:27.270\nthat we typically just don't\nhave with the basic disk.\n\n49\n00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.987\nLet me tell you what I mean,\nif you're using a basic or a dynamic disk,\n\n50\n00:02:30.987 --> 00:02:33.708\nyou can implement what's\nknown as software raid.\n\n51\n00:02:33.708 --> 00:02:38.062\nAnd if you paid attention to some of our\nserver courses, you really don't want to\n\n52\n00:02:38.062 --> 00:02:41.264\ndo this in the server site,\ncertainly not in production but\n\n53\n00:02:41.264 --> 00:02:44.678\nit does give you the ability on\nthe workstations side, right?\n\n54\n00:02:44.678 --> 00:02:49.186\nThe client side if we say, that you\ncould get some level of redundancy,\n\n55\n00:02:49.186 --> 00:02:53.106\nif you will, or you can aggregate\nmultiple drives together.\n\n56\n00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:55.579\nIf I've got a lot of\ndrives in my systems and\n\n57\n00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.892\nI wanna make up a large storage container,\nI can do that.\n\n58\n00:02:58.892 --> 00:03:01.963\nBut I do have to change the disk type,\nright?\n\n59\n00:03:01.963 --> 00:03:03.718\nBasic disk don't support that.\n\n60\n00:03:03.718 --> 00:03:07.489\nSee dynamic disks what they use\nare a series of databases right?\n\n61\n00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.192\nAnd when you configure dynamic\ndisks each dynamic disk stores\n\n62\n00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:14.097\na copy of that database.\n\n63\n00:03:14.097 --> 00:03:17.670\nSo if I have multiple data or\ndynamic disks,\n\n64\n00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.243\nwhat you're going to see\nus do here in a bit,\n\n65\n00:03:21.243 --> 00:03:26.768\nlet's say I put them together as\none storage container if you will.\n\n66\n00:03:26.768 --> 00:03:31.009\nEach one of those disks is maintaining\na copy of that database which\n\n67\n00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:35.322\nis one of the things that gives me a good,\nunderlying, if you will,\n\n68\n00:03:35.322 --> 00:03:39.560\nunder the architecture,\nnot the logical part of it, that if one of\n\n69\n00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.970\nthe database gets corrupted, well,\nwe can just read it from another drive.\n\n70\n00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.070\nSo you can start to see we get\na little bit of resilience here,\n\n71\n00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.795\na little bit of redundancy in\nthe underlying architecture.\n\n72\n00:03:52.795 --> 00:03:54.063\nNow, the disk type,\n\n73\n00:03:54.063 --> 00:03:58.855\nagain, understand it's still supports\nthings like your master boot record and\n\n74\n00:03:58.855 --> 00:04:03.170\nyour GPT, so we still get those\npartitioning styles if we want to use it.\n\n75\n00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.299\nAnd also keep in mind that database to\ntrack the information in case one get's\n\n76\n00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.000\ncorrupted we can always read that\ninformation off of another drive.\n\n77\n00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.519\n&gt;&gt; Yes fantastic it's now all of a sudden\none drive is aware of other drives that\n\n78\n00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.110\nare in your system.\n\n79\n00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:21.410\nAnd with basic disks, a drive has no\nidea what other drives are out there,\n\n80\n00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.250\nwe can start getting the dynamic disks.\n\n81\n00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.250\nWe create those little disk family's or\ngroups I think they call them.\n\n82\n00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.050\nNow all of a sudden we can do some things\nwe couldn't do with basic disk because\n\n83\n00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.183\nthey're aware of each other.\n\n84\n00:04:31.183 --> 00:04:32.664\nThey're no part of a set.\n\n85\n00:04:32.664 --> 00:04:34.125\n&gt;&gt; That's absolutely correct.\n\n86\n00:04:34.125 --> 00:04:36.061\nIn fact let's go ahead and\n\n87\n00:04:36.061 --> 00:04:41.490\nlet's show you inside of our disk\nmanagement, a little bit about this.\n\n88\n00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.960\nSo we've left this configuration pretty\nmuch where we were in part 1 here, so\n\n89\n00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.565\nkeep in mind that in the last one, you'll\nprobably remember that we initialized\n\n90\n00:04:50.565 --> 00:04:52.683\nthe disks, we brought them online.\n\n91\n00:04:52.683 --> 00:04:57.000\nOops, we brought them online and\nthen we did our three primary partitions,\n\n92\n00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.452\nwhen I created that fourth it said,\nyeah, well let me help you out here and\n\n93\n00:05:01.452 --> 00:05:03.623\nI'll create an extended partition.\n\n94\n00:05:03.623 --> 00:05:06.968\nSo in this case you can use those\nlast three little gigabytes there for\n\n95\n00:05:06.968 --> 00:05:08.303\nsome logical containers.\n\n96\n00:05:08.303 --> 00:05:10.825\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I tell you,\nthe first time I did that in Windows and\n\n97\n00:05:10.825 --> 00:05:12.941\nit created that for\nme I was a little irritated.\n\n98\n00:05:12.941 --> 00:05:15.831\nBecause I wanted four primary partitions,\nnot that there's much difference.\n\n99\n00:05:15.831 --> 00:05:19.580\nBut sometimes I get a little I\ndon't know what the term for it is.\n\n100\n00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.530\nI wanted things a certain way and\nit created it automatically for me.\n\n101\n00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.356\nIt was just trying to make sure that\nif I wanted to create another one,\n\n102\n00:05:26.356 --> 00:05:28.452\nI could because now it's\nan extended partition and\n\n103\n00:05:28.452 --> 00:05:30.468\nI can create those logical\ndrives inside there.\n\n104\n00:05:30.468 --> 00:05:32.005\n&gt;&gt; It is\n&gt;&gt; And you know what?\n\n105\n00:05:32.005 --> 00:05:34.530\nI think with this disk here,\nwe're going to start completely over so\n\n106\n00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.325\nI don't have to worry about\nany of that for sure.\n\n107\n00:05:36.325 --> 00:05:37.322\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n[LAUGH]\n\n108\n00:05:37.322 --> 00:05:38.159\n&gt;&gt; So, what we're going to do,\n\n109\n00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:39.570\nis we're going to do this\na little bit different.\n\n110\n00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.020\nI could completely bring this\ndrive offline if I wanted,\n\n111\n00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.710\nI could come in here and\nI could take my time.\n\n112\n00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.735\nI could right click and I could do some\nthings like deleting the volume, but\n\n113\n00:05:48.735 --> 00:05:51.855\nlet me go ahead and what I'd like to do\nis, I'd like to drop down to our command\n\n114\n00:05:51.855 --> 00:05:54.423\nprompt, or in this case I'm gonna\ndrop down to my PowerShell.\n\n115\n00:05:54.423 --> 00:05:55.477\nYou know I say that,\n\n116\n00:05:55.477 --> 00:05:59.135\nI still have not modified the defaults\nwhich is good because you know,\n\n117\n00:05:59.135 --> 00:06:02.920\nwhen you're learning help desk,\na lot of people do not modify default.\n\n118\n00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:07.260\nSo let me go ahead and I'm going to\nlaunch up my PowerShell, administrate\n\n119\n00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.670\nthe PowerShell here and we'll go ahead and\nchange this just a little bit for\n\n120\n00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.443\nyou guys make it easier to see out there,\nI know that's kinda hard with the eyes.\n\n121\n00:06:16.443 --> 00:06:20.188\nChange my screen text cuz if you\nare not looking at the matrix,\n\n122\n00:06:20.188 --> 00:06:22.864\nwell you aren't [INAUDIBLE] With anything.\n\n123\n00:06:22.864 --> 00:06:24.255\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Apparently,\n\n124\n00:06:24.255 --> 00:06:28.150\nI didn't change the background color so\nlet's change that real quick.\n\n125\n00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.534\nAll right guys, there we go,\nmaking a little bit easier for sake.\n\n126\n00:06:30.534 --> 00:06:35.005\nSo we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\ndrop down to DiskPart, all right?\n\n127\n00:06:35.005 --> 00:06:38.210\nDiskPart is the command line equivalent.\n\n128\n00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:39.853\nWhen I say, command-line, as you can see,\n\n129\n00:06:39.853 --> 00:06:41.680\nit doesn't have to\ntraditional command prompt.\n\n130\n00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.480\nIt's an executable.\n\n131\n00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.183\nIt's an application that runs.\n\n132\n00:06:44.183 --> 00:06:46.766\nYou can use command prompt or\nyou can use PowerShell.\n\n133\n00:06:46.766 --> 00:06:48.395\nAs you can see, I'm using PowerShell.\n\n134\n00:06:48.395 --> 00:06:51.053\nAnd there's a couple of\nthings we can do with this.\n\n135\n00:06:51.053 --> 00:06:54.650\nI want to know what the disk\nwere in the systems, right?\n\n136\n00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.406\nI could see inside of my disk management,\nright,\n\n137\n00:06:57.406 --> 00:07:00.177\nthough the GUI,\nI could see that that's Disk 3.\n\n138\n00:07:00.177 --> 00:07:02.317\nWhat if this is a headless system?\n\n139\n00:07:02.317 --> 00:07:03.137\nWhat, right?\n\n140\n00:07:03.137 --> 00:07:05.230\nWhat if I've got a server\ncore installation?\n\n141\n00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.980\nNow, they're not going to test you about\ncore installations on an MTA exam, but\n\n142\n00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.990\nyou got to understand that there are\nsituations where you might have to drop\n\n143\n00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.000\ndown to this part.\n\n144\n00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.060\nIn fact, I can tall you, a lot of\ntimes I'll drop down the disk part to\n\n145\n00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.640\nclean a system before I ever drop the disk\nmanagement just because it's fast right.\n\n146\n00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.100\nBut I can do a list disk right, and\n\n147\n00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.930\nit shows me all of those disks that\nwe see in disk management, alright.\n\n148\n00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:28.700\nI can see whether it's formatted\nas GPT by this column here, right?\n\n149\n00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:32.430\nAsterisk symbol means it is,\nlack of an asterisk symbol means it's not.\n\n150\n00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.126\nI can also see what the free space is,\nI can see if they're dynamic disks,\n\n151\n00:07:35.126 --> 00:07:36.051\nremember it said basic?\n\n152\n00:07:36.051 --> 00:07:38.127\nI don't see an asterisk in here, right?\n\n153\n00:07:38.127 --> 00:07:40.457\nIt isn't a dynamic disk.\n\n154\n00:07:40.457 --> 00:07:41.339\nSo let's go ahead.\n\n155\n00:07:41.339 --> 00:07:44.200\nI need to select Disk 3, right?\n\n156\n00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.661\nIn this case I know what\nthe disk is already.\n\n157\n00:07:46.661 --> 00:07:49.133\nBut if you didn't you can find it here,\nall right?\n\n158\n00:07:49.133 --> 00:07:51.244\nAnd I'm gonna do a select.\n\n159\n00:07:51.244 --> 00:07:54.611\nI could abbreviate this too cuz it takes\nabbreviation which is what I really like\n\n160\n00:07:54.611 --> 00:07:55.477\nabout this part 2.\n\n161\n00:07:55.477 --> 00:08:01.569\nI could do SEL but I will do a select\nDisk and we'll do 3, all right.\n\n162\n00:08:01.569 --> 00:08:05.794\nAnd I am so\nparanoid about erasing the wrong disk,\n\n163\n00:08:05.794 --> 00:08:11.950\nafter I select a disk, I always turn\naround and I check it out again.\n\n164\n00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.350\nI need to see that that disk is selected.\n\n165\n00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:17.090\nSo, make sure you do that, just in case.\n\n166\n00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:18.310\nSo, what am I going to do?\n\n167\n00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.021\nBut I'm gonna go ahead, well,\nlet me clear the screen.\n\n168\n00:08:20.021 --> 00:08:24.010\nI know that's getting a little bit\nharder to see for you guys out there.\n\n169\n00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:29.744\nThere we go, that will make\nit a little bit easier guys,\n\n170\n00:08:29.744 --> 00:08:31.636\nlittle manipulation make it easier for\nyou to see.\n\n171\n00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:38.238\nSo now, let me go ahead and\ndo that scl or select disk 3.\n\n172\n00:08:38.238 --> 00:08:41.510\nAnd again, we're gonna do our list\ndisk again cuz I don't trust it.\n\n173\n00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:44.927\n[LAUGH] Man and\nI'm gonna do a clean, right?\n\n174\n00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:48.790\nThe disk is clean.\n\n175\n00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:50.326\nNotice it didn't warn me,\nare you sure you wanna do this?\n\n176\n00:08:50.326 --> 00:08:52.070\nYou're really, really sure?\n\n177\n00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:54.330\nIf you do this, you could lose data.\n\n178\n00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:55.120\nDidn't tell me that.\n\n179\n00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.247\nThat's one of the things that you gotta\nkeep in mind if you are using disk part\n\n180\n00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:01.570\nbecause if I draw back to disk management,\n\n181\n00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:04.815\nI completely clean this disk\nfrom where we were in part one.\n\n182\n00:09:04.815 --> 00:09:08.394\nAll right, so\nplease understand that, okay.\n\n183\n00:09:08.394 --> 00:09:13.456\nAnd I can also do create partitions\nhere too if I wanted to, so\n\n184\n00:09:13.456 --> 00:09:18.323\nfor instance, since it's selected,\nI could sit here and\n\n185\n00:09:18.323 --> 00:09:22.019\ndo, I could do a create partition primary.\n\n186\n00:09:22.019 --> 00:09:27.244\nAll right, and\nnow if I walk back look here.\n\n187\n00:09:27.244 --> 00:09:32.526\nNow, you have to understand,\nnotice that the disk is basic, right?\n\n188\n00:09:32.526 --> 00:09:35.495\nI have to tell it I want\nit to be a dynamic disk.\n\n189\n00:09:35.495 --> 00:09:37.545\nWell, I could show you\nreal easy in the GUI.\n\n190\n00:09:37.545 --> 00:09:41.165\nWe just right-click on that little square\nand there it is, Convert to Dynamic Disk.\n\n191\n00:09:41.165 --> 00:09:43.193\nAll right, now,\nnotice the color arrangements.\n\n192\n00:09:43.193 --> 00:09:45.953\nThe blue here denotes simple volumes,\nright.\n\n193\n00:09:45.953 --> 00:09:49.863\nYou have one that Windows creates when\nit's installed for the UEFI boot stuff and\n\n194\n00:09:49.863 --> 00:09:52.353\nsome other stuff that's in there as well,\nright.\n\n195\n00:09:52.353 --> 00:09:54.534\nBut notice the blue,\nthat's a simple volume.\n\n196\n00:09:54.534 --> 00:09:58.324\nNotice what happens to the color\nwhen I convert it to GPT.\n\n197\n00:09:58.324 --> 00:10:01.314\nAll right, and it's asking me, which of\nthese disks do you wanna do that to or\n\n198\n00:10:01.314 --> 00:10:03.200\nnot GPT, excuse me, Dynamic.\n\n199\n00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.240\nAll right, well for the purposes of this,\n\n200\n00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:09.430\nI'm gonna hold off because I have\nanother disk in this system.\n\n201\n00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:11.880\nAnd it's down here and\nI want you guys to go ahead and see it.\n\n202\n00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.930\nNotice it's also basic as well.\n\n203\n00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:16.020\nAll right, there's a reason I\nwant two of these drives in this.\n\n204\n00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:16.900\nSo I'm gonna go ahead,\n\n205\n00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.190\nI'm gonna right-click,\nI'm gonna choose Convert to Dynamic Disk.\n\n206\n00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:23.615\nMake sure that's Disk 3 and\n4, we'll choose OK.\n\n207\n00:10:25.852 --> 00:10:29.921\nAnd notice that it tells me, these are the\ndisks that are gonna be shown in the list.\n\n208\n00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:31.730\nThey're gonna be dynamic.\n\n209\n00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.106\nAll right, and it also warns me, right?\n\n210\n00:10:34.106 --> 00:10:36.220\nIf you convert, notice the warning here.\n\n211\n00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.400\nIf you convert the disk to dynamic, you\nwill not be able to start the installed\n\n212\n00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:44.430\noperating system on any volume on the\ndisks, except for the current boot volume.\n\n213\n00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:48.215\nKeep that in mind because if it's\nan empty drive, I just convert it and\n\n214\n00:10:48.215 --> 00:10:49.570\nI don't worry about it.\n\n215\n00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:53.460\nBut if it's a boot drive,\nyou need to take it into consideration.\n\n216\n00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.200\nNotice what happened here,\nnotice that the colors are different.\n\n217\n00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:03.070\nBut they're simple partitions, right,\nthere are simple volumes here, right?\n\n218\n00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:05.427\nI have a simple volume here, it's healthy.\n\n219\n00:11:05.427 --> 00:11:09.014\nAnd I didn't apply a file system to it,\nbut I do have a volume, right?\n\n220\n00:11:09.014 --> 00:11:13.791\nOr what if I decide that, maybe I'm\nrunning out of space on this drive, right?\n\n221\n00:11:13.791 --> 00:11:19.052\nMaybe this drive is completely full,\nbut I got another drive in it.\n\n222\n00:11:19.052 --> 00:11:21.734\nMan, wouldn't it be nice to be\nable to take that container and\n\n223\n00:11:21.734 --> 00:11:23.032\nextend the size a little bit?\n\n224\n00:11:23.032 --> 00:11:25.778\nIf you've got dynamic\ndisks you can do that and\n\n225\n00:11:25.778 --> 00:11:29.730\nyou do that through what's known\nas a spanned volume, all right?\n\n226\n00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:33.260\nSo let's go in, let's right-click.\n\n227\n00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.185\nAnd you know what, I'm gonna go ahead and\njust delete this volume altogether.\n\n228\n00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:41.002\nAnd I'm gonna right-click now cuz we can't\nhave that simple volume on there taking up\n\n229\n00:11:41.002 --> 00:11:42.653\nthe entirety of the drive, all right?\n\n230\n00:11:42.653 --> 00:11:47.586\nSo if I wanna kinda future-proof my\ndrive from a capacity limitation,\n\n231\n00:11:47.586 --> 00:11:53.020\nand what I mean by that is I wanna be\nable to add additional drives later.\n\n232\n00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:57.440\nI format it as a dynamic disk, make sure\nthat there aren't any volumes on it, and\n\n233\n00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.725\nI choose New Spanned Volume, all right.\n\n234\n00:11:59.725 --> 00:12:02.015\nAnd there's some other ones\nin there that you can do.\n\n235\n00:12:02.015 --> 00:12:04.580\nThey're really only called the simple\nvolume that we've showed you and\n\n236\n00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:08.210\nthe spanned volume out on the exam, we'll\nkind of explain the other ones coming up.\n\n237\n00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:09.942\nAnd I'll choose Next, and\n\n238\n00:12:09.942 --> 00:12:14.551\nthen I get the option to select the disks\nthat I want to put in this system.\n\n239\n00:12:14.551 --> 00:12:18.690\nSo right now,\nI can see what's already selected, right?\n\n240\n00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:21.606\nWe started with Disk 3,\nwe're now gonna move into Disk 4, and\n\n241\n00:12:21.606 --> 00:12:23.232\nwe're gonna choose Add all right?\n\n242\n00:12:23.232 --> 00:12:26.691\nNow, one of the things to keep\nin mind is with spanned volumes,\n\n243\n00:12:26.691 --> 00:12:29.433\nyou'll notice that if I decided to,\nI could use,\n\n244\n00:12:29.433 --> 00:12:34.210\nactually that's a horrible number to use,\nlet me use 10, there we go.\n\n245\n00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:36.933\nI could use half of this\ndrive if I wanted, right.\n\n246\n00:12:36.933 --> 00:12:40.410\nI could turn around and if I wanted,\nI could use half of this drive, too.\n\n247\n00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:45.390\nSo the great thing about spanned volumes\nis it does give you the ability to\n\n248\n00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:49.120\npick and choose how much of the space,\nprovided you have free space,\n\n249\n00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.690\nOn a drive that you want to\ninclude in that spanned volume.\n\n250\n00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:56.298\nAnd what it's gonna do, if we go through\nthis, you'll see that the rest of\n\n251\n00:12:56.298 --> 00:12:59.926\nthe process really isn't too much\ndifferent than what we've seen so far.\n\n252\n00:12:59.926 --> 00:13:03.610\nRight now, I can assign an amount point or\na drive letter in this case.\n\n253\n00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:07.083\nI can choose Next, and\nnow we get our volume,\n\n254\n00:13:07.083 --> 00:13:10.549\nwe could format it no different\nthan we do any other hard drive.\n\n255\n00:13:10.549 --> 00:13:11.380\nSo nothing big on this.\n\n256\n00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.427\nI can enable file and\nfolder compression if I want.\n\n257\n00:13:13.427 --> 00:13:17.074\nI'm gonna go ahead, and\nI'm gonna back this one out, and\n\n258\n00:13:17.074 --> 00:13:19.917\nI'm going to call this Spanned, all right.\n\n259\n00:13:19.917 --> 00:13:24.790\nAnd we'll choose Next.\n\n260\n00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:26.708\nI'm gonna go against your\nadvice there Mike, and\n\n261\n00:13:26.708 --> 00:13:28.315\nI'm gonna put a volume label on this one.\n\n262\n00:13:28.315 --> 00:13:28.908\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n263\n00:13:28.908 --> 00:13:33.467\n&gt;&gt; All right, now, here is something\nI want you to notice, all right.\n\n264\n00:13:33.467 --> 00:13:38.176\nNotice that it says the operation you\nselected will convert the selected\n\n265\n00:13:38.176 --> 00:13:40.130\nbasic disk to dynamic disk.\n\n266\n00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:44.170\nI cannot perform this\noperation on a basic disk.\n\n267\n00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:46.930\nAll right, we'll choose, yes,\nand we'll let it convert.\n\n268\n00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:51.850\nAll right, now notice the color\nthat we got here, right?\n\n269\n00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:54.035\nNotice that, was at magenta,\nI guess I would be right, or\n\n270\n00:13:54.035 --> 00:13:55.164\nsomething like that, yeah.\n\n271\n00:13:55.164 --> 00:13:57.145\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna call it purple,\nyou wanna call it magenta.\n\n272\n00:13:57.145 --> 00:13:59.137\n&gt;&gt; Okay perfect, right,\nwe'll agree to disagree on that one.\n\n273\n00:13:59.137 --> 00:14:01.594\nBut now what I have is a spanned volume.\n\n274\n00:14:01.594 --> 00:14:03.525\n&gt;&gt; I had a smaller box of crayons.\n\n275\n00:14:03.525 --> 00:14:06.230\n&gt;&gt; There we go, there we go, well,\nno worries I'll lend you some money,\n\n276\n00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:07.959\nwe'll get you a bigger\nbox of crayons there.\n\n277\n00:14:07.959 --> 00:14:10.225\nIt'd be a Christmas present.\n\n278\n00:14:10.225 --> 00:14:11.695\nSo now what does it look like?\n\n279\n00:14:11.695 --> 00:14:14.510\nWe know that it's spanned,\nI told you that it's spanned,\n\n280\n00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:18.072\nMike's been sitting here watching me\ntry to turn it into a spanned volume.\n\n281\n00:14:18.072 --> 00:14:20.870\nSo what do we actually see?\n\n282\n00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:21.736\nWhat does the end user see, right?\n\n283\n00:14:21.736 --> 00:14:23.926\nUs as is if we're a help desk,\nwe would know this.\n\n284\n00:14:23.926 --> 00:14:26.830\nBut what do they see in, let's say for\ninstance, File Explorer?\n\n285\n00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:33.390\nI don't really see much different\nbetween any of the Local Disk (C:) and\n\n286\n00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:35.450\nthe Spanned volume, all right?\n\n287\n00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:42.990\nNow what this means for\nme is this volume, notice, is 10.00GB.\n\n288\n00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:46.612\nPart of it is 10.00GB on this drive,\npart of it's 10.00GB on this drive,\n\n289\n00:14:46.612 --> 00:14:49.830\nit's spanning it across multiple drives.\n\n290\n00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:50.940\nWe could do other ones too.\n\n291\n00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.957\nIn fact, if i wanted to, you see some\nother ones here, they don't really call\n\n292\n00:14:53.957 --> 00:14:56.354\nthem out on the exam, but\nI'll just kinda mention them here.\n\n293\n00:14:56.354 --> 00:15:01.070\nStriped, Striped is kinda like\na software version of RAID 0 right.\n\n294\n00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:02.774\nWhat we're gonna do is we're\ngonna have two drives, and\n\n295\n00:15:02.774 --> 00:15:04.491\nthe drive controllers will be\nspinning at the same time.\n\n296\n00:15:04.491 --> 00:15:07.170\nThey're not coordinated\nby a RAID controller.\n\n297\n00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:11.140\nKeep in mind, they're coordinated by the\noperating systems so the software, RAID.\n\n298\n00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.690\nThis is not something you\nwould put in production.\n\n299\n00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:15.324\nAnd then also the Mirrored Volume,\n\n300\n00:15:15.324 --> 00:15:18.492\nMirrored Volume is more a kin to\nsomething like your RAID 1, right.\n\n301\n00:15:18.492 --> 00:15:22.757\nWe get fault tolerance, if one drive fails\nwe've got a duplicate copy on another\n\n302\n00:15:22.757 --> 00:15:25.030\ndrive, we still have access to it.\n\n303\n00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:28.110\nThe one that we're creating here, I like\nto compare it to just a bunch of disks.\n\n304\n00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:31.226\nThat's where you just take\nmultiple disks in a system, and\n\n305\n00:15:31.226 --> 00:15:33.670\nyou make them one massive\nstorage container.\n\n306\n00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.950\n&gt;&gt; You know,\nwe should probably point out too,\n\n307\n00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:40.210\nwhere the spanned volumes are nice because\nif you're, like you were saying, if you\n\n308\n00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:44.372\ngot a user that's running out of space,\nthey've gotta store more information.\n\n309\n00:15:44.372 --> 00:15:48.447\nAnd you've got an extra hard drive laying\naround, you can slap it in that system,\n\n310\n00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:51.459\nyou can extend your volume onto\nthe next drive, Basically,\n\n311\n00:15:51.459 --> 00:15:54.909\ncreate that spanned volume and\ngive them more space really quickly.\n\n312\n00:15:54.909 --> 00:15:59.006\nBut what we do have to keep in mind is\nthere is no fault tolerance with a span\n\n313\n00:15:59.006 --> 00:15:59.920\nvolume.\n\n314\n00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:04.320\nNow I've got two drives holding\na single volume, the data is written on\n\n315\n00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:08.430\nboth of them as soon as the first one\nfills up it flows into the next one.\n\n316\n00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:12.210\nThe problem is if either\none of those drives fails,\n\n317\n00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:14.460\nyou lose all the data\non that spanned volume.\n\n318\n00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:18.540\nSo whereas when my data resided on one\ndisk, I had a single point of failure.\n\n319\n00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:19.738\nThe disk fails I lose my data.\n\n320\n00:16:19.738 --> 00:16:24.070\nNow that I've created a span volume,\nI've got two points of failure.\n\n321\n00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:27.930\nEither one of those drives fail and\nyou lose all of your data.\n\n322\n00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:32.380\nSo this is definitely not something you're\ngonna use with any important data or\n\n323\n00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:33.290\ninformation.\n\n324\n00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:36.140\n&gt;&gt; That's a good point cuz I keep\nmentioning it in the context of\n\n325\n00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.580\na production environment where\nmost of that is important.\n\n326\n00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:41.290\nBut if you think of like\na home environment,\n\n327\n00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:42.990\nkind of like Mike said,\nwhat's important to you?\n\n328\n00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:46.610\nWell, pretty much any piece of\nsoftware that I have I can lose and\n\n329\n00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:49.020\nI mean operating system,\nI don't care, I can reinstall it.\n\n330\n00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:52.250\nMight not be the easiest if I don't\nunderstand the operating system but for\n\n331\n00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:55.590\nthe most part I can replace\nsoftware it doesn't matter.\n\n332\n00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:58.750\nWhat I can't replace is pictures of\nmy kids for the last decade, right?\n\n333\n00:16:58.750 --> 00:16:59.730\nThat's very important.\n\n334\n00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:04.230\nSo I would probably take Mike's advice and\nI wouldn't put it on a span volume I\n\n335\n00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:07.980\nwouldn't put them on striped volume,\nin fact for me I wouldn't even keep\n\n336\n00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:12.560\na single copy I'd keep one copy on this\nmachine and then a copy somewhere else.\n\n337\n00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:13.840\nIt's absolutely correct.\n\n338\n00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:17.120\nBe careful, this is not about fault\ntolerance and really this one isn't even\n\n339\n00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:21.320\nabout performance, it's just about being\nable to utilize the drive space that you\n\n340\n00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:23.790\nhave when you have more than\none drive in the system.\n\n341\n00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:26.000\nSo, all great points.\n\n342\n00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.670\nThis one, though, even though we've\nlook at those utilities this next\n\n343\n00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:31.500\nconcept it really isn't on the exam.\n\n344\n00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.650\nBut I do just wanna kinda\ntake a second here and\n\n345\n00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:35.870\nshow you that something\nelse that you can do here.\n\n346\n00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:37.880\nAnd that's something known as VHD files.\n\n347\n00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:42.650\nIf I go to the Action option I have\nthe ability to Create or Attach a VHD.\n\n348\n00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:45.150\nA VHD is a virtual hard disk and\n\n349\n00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:48.390\nit's really a software\nrepresentation of a hard drive.\n\n350\n00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:53.450\nIt allows me to do virtualization,\na lot of times we do virtualization,\n\n351\n00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:56.680\none of the things that Windows\nsupported since I wanna say\n\n352\n00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:00.900\nWindows 7 was the first time routing\nwas called an native VHD booth.\n\n353\n00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:05.030\nWhich is kind of nice because if Mike is\nthe administrator and he wants to be able\n\n354\n00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:09.150\nto control the operating system\nenvironment on my machine, he can actually\n\n355\n00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:13.270\npre make one of these virtual hard disks,\ninstall an operating system,\n\n356\n00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:17.160\nput it on my machine, and do a little bit\nof manipulation to the boot loader and\n\n357\n00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:22.300\nit loads right to that virtual machine\nnatively within my operating system and\n\n358\n00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:25.520\nit's running in operating\nsystems get kinda twisty right.\n\n359\n00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:30.110\nSo we wanna kinda show you just the\ncreation of the VHD and I'm not really in\n\n360\n00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:33.410\nthe create it here but i wanna show\nyou a couple of the options here.\n\n361\n00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:38.877\nWe have the old format VHD and this is\nsupported in Windows 7 I believe and\n\n362\n00:18:38.877 --> 00:18:44.072\nabove, the newer format VHDX might\nhave that wrong I think Vista also\n\n363\n00:18:44.072 --> 00:18:49.294\nsupported the VHD file and\nthen Windows 7 and above is the VHDX file.\n\n364\n00:18:49.294 --> 00:18:55.213\nVHDX file supports large, large drives\nyou could see supported maximum of,\n\n365\n00:18:55.213 --> 00:19:01.410\ngosh 64 terabytes, right which there is\na two Gig limitation tot he VHD file.\n\n366\n00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:04.840\nThe other thing that you have\nis a type of a hard drive.\n\n367\n00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.260\nIf I'm gonna allocate the space in our\nhard drive like we've done you could see\n\n368\n00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.320\nkinda behind the scenes there\nin disk management Well\n\n369\n00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:14.390\nnotice these volumes back here,\nthat's ten gigs right?\n\n370\n00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:19.350\nThat's 10 gigs on this drive that\nis set aside for that partition and\n\n371\n00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:23.974\nI don't have anything in it,\nall right well that's what known kind of\n\n372\n00:19:23.974 --> 00:19:27.100\na comparative to what's known\nas a fixed virtual hard disk.\n\n373\n00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.190\nWhen you say okay this is\ngonna be a fixed disk and\n\n374\n00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:32.940\nI'm gonna make sure that it's ten gigs,\n\n375\n00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:38.390\nit means the moment I create that virtual\nhard disk, ten gigs of the storage space\n\n376\n00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:43.000\non this current drive is now allocated to\nthat hard drive and its taken right away.\n\n377\n00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.410\nAll right, what if I'm not gonna\nuse that virtual hard drive for\n\n378\n00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:49.240\nmaybe just, maybe a couple of files and\nmaybe over time I might add some more.\n\n379\n00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:52.710\nWell I might want a way to\ndynamically expand the drive\n\n380\n00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:56.800\nas I add more data to it and that's\nwhat the dynamically expanding disk is.\n\n381\n00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:01.890\nIn VHD files, the older format\nthey recommend using the fixed, or\n\n382\n00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:06.530\nthe fixed type, you'll notice that\nby default of VHD, selected here,\n\n383\n00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:11.910\nit uses fixed, notice what happens\nwhen I turn the VHDX, it switches it.\n\n384\n00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:16.740\nBecause the VHDX format, it's\nrecommended that you use a dynamic disk.\n\n385\n00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:21.294\nAgain, it will grow to the maximum size,\nbut if I say ten gigs and\n\n386\n00:20:21.294 --> 00:20:26.380\nit's only got maybe five, may not be five,\nmaybe it's got four k in it,\n\n387\n00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:31.210\nthen on the disk it's only taking up four\nk and it will start to grow over time.\n\n388\n00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:33.071\nIt's really about I know some and\n\n389\n00:20:33.071 --> 00:20:37.400\nMike I know you've dealt heavily\nwith virtualization, some operating\n\n390\n00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:42.370\nsystems would say you have to have a fixed\nsystem for more stability, others would\n\n391\n00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:45.490\nsay dynamically expanding because if\nyou're using it in a test environment,\n\n392\n00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:49.180\nit more efficiently utilizes the storage\nthat you have within your system.\n\n393\n00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:53.880\nSo that is up to you, but\nthat's a little bit about the VHD file.\n\n394\n00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.710\nThe other thing that I wanna\nkinda look at that they call out,\n\n395\n00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:59.390\nwhich is kinda interesting and\nMike I'm gonna jump ahead on you.\n\n396\n00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:02.080\nBut we're gonna talk about OneDrive but\n\n397\n00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:05.700\nsince we're talking about physical and\nin this case virtual disks as well,\n\n398\n00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.680\nI wanna kinda mention a little\nbit about drive optimization.\n\n399\n00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:12.899\nBecause we're gonna talk about OneDrive,\nthat OneDrive I'm not really running any\n\n400\n00:21:12.899 --> 00:21:17.016\noptimizer on, they're doing doing that all\nin the back end and in the cloud for us.\n\n401\n00:21:17.016 --> 00:21:21.125\nSo while we are here I think it's\na good place to talk about some of\n\n402\n00:21:21.125 --> 00:21:25.994\nthe optimization techniques we have,\nwe have two really good ones that have\n\n403\n00:21:25.994 --> 00:21:29.520\nbeen in Windows for a while,\none has had a name change.\n\n404\n00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:35.590\nIt used to be called disk defrag or\ndefragmenter and at some point, I wanna\n\n405\n00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:40.060\nsay maybe even Windows 8 they changed\nit they called it the drive optimizer.\n\n406\n00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.800\nThose of you who have known it as\ndisk defragmenter for a long time,\n\n407\n00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.380\nguys it's the same thing, right?\n\n408\n00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:48.050\nIt's just a newer title or\nnewer name over technology and\n\n409\n00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:53.040\nthey probably, they probably made some\nenhancements to it over the years too,\n\n410\n00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.350\ncuz it goes all the way back too.\n\n411\n00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:57.430\nIt's been pretty much the same program\nsince it started way back when.\n\n412\n00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:00.430\nI wanna say going back as far as NT.\n\n413\n00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:01.790\nAll right, so let's go ahead.\n\n414\n00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:03.290\nWhat are we talking\nabout when we say this?\n\n415\n00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:06.130\nWell, let's go ahead and\nwe'll open File Explorer.\n\n416\n00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:09.010\nIt's kinda interesting, people don't\nreally think of File Explorer as being\n\n417\n00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:12.510\na management utility for\nother than just folders and files, but\n\n418\n00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:14.460\nit's actually a storage\nmanagement to utility.\n\n419\n00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.950\nAnd some people don't even know\nsome of the stuff that's here.\n\n420\n00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:21.930\nSo for instance, if I select this PC and\nLocal Disk (C:), I decide that I wanna\n\n421\n00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:26.330\nright click on it, and choose Properties,\nI get the properties of the local drive.\n\n422\n00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:28.920\nBut I want you to notice something, notice\na couple of things that I have here.\n\n423\n00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:32.910\nI have Disk Cleanup that I can run,\ndeleting temporary files.\n\n424\n00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:35.440\nI also have tools.\n\n425\n00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:38.750\nAnd notice that we got a couple of options\nhere, we've got error checking and\n\n426\n00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:42.620\nwe've got Optimize and\ndefragment drive, all right?\n\n427\n00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:43.890\nI'm gonna go ahead and load this up and\n\n428\n00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:46.700\nI want you guys to see a couple\nof things there, okay?\n\n429\n00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:52.480\nNow when we optimize a drive when\nwe do defragmentation right,\n\n430\n00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:56.990\nas we start moving files around within\nthe files in the file cabinet right,\n\n431\n00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:59.900\nhave you ever gone to a file cabinet\nyou pull out the big folder right in\n\n432\n00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.860\nthe middle of the file cabinet and you\nleave all the other ones where they are at\n\n433\n00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:05.130\nleast a big space right,\nright in the middle of the file cabinet.\n\n434\n00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:06.260\nThen what do you have to do?\n\n435\n00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.020\nYou have to pull the files to the front.\n\n436\n00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:10.560\nAnd it's not really that big of a deal for\nus.\n\n437\n00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:14.290\nImagine that times a billion,\ntimes a million bytes or\n\n438\n00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:15.970\nhowever big your drive is.\n\n439\n00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:21.750\nThose little holes and gaps in between\na file and when I write a new file, I want\n\n440\n00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:26.090\nyou to think of it this way, I don't get\nto just write a file in that empty space,\n\n441\n00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:29.350\nI have to pull the file\ncabinet all the way out and\n\n442\n00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:31.690\nthrow that new file all\nthe way in the back.\n\n443\n00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:32.880\nBoy, is that a pain.\n\n444\n00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.920\nWouldn't it be nice to just\nmove those folders together,\n\n445\n00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:39.080\nmake them a little bit more contiguous,\njoin them back together and\n\n446\n00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.160\nbe able to store files more efficiently?\n\n447\n00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.932\nWell, that's what a defragmentation does.\n\n448\n00:23:42.932 --> 00:23:45.795\nIt says, let's take all of those\nfragmented files that are dispersed\n\n449\n00:23:45.795 --> 00:23:49.051\nthroughout the drive, and let's put\nthem back in a contiguous fashion.\n\n450\n00:23:49.051 --> 00:23:50.894\nYou've got fragmented free space?\n\n451\n00:23:50.894 --> 00:23:52.981\nFolders missing in the middle\nof the file cabinet?\n\n452\n00:23:52.981 --> 00:23:54.180\nLet's squish them together.\n\n453\n00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:58.700\nAnd I want you to think of it as\nlike walking across a brick walkway.\n\n454\n00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:03.190\nTake a few of those bricks out,\nkinda breaks your stride a little bit.\n\n455\n00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:04.235\nThe more bricks you state,\n\n456\n00:24:04.235 --> 00:24:07.270\nthe harder time you have to work\nto get across that brick walkway.\n\n457\n00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:08.840\nNow, imagine once those bricks were gone,\n\n458\n00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.700\nI had a magic way to just\nscrunch them all back together.\n\n459\n00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:15.160\nRight, I got a nice walk way\nmakes it nice even stride.\n\n460\n00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:18.320\nWell that's what it makes for\nyour controller on your drive\n\n461\n00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:21.880\nto find the operating system files\nthat it needs and your regular files.\n\n462\n00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.240\nSo that's what we're doing.\n\n463\n00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:26.250\nNow, interesting story here.\n\n464\n00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:30.200\nNotice that solid state drive\nsays optimization not available.\n\n465\n00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.800\nAll right, solid state drives,\nthey suffer from write degradation.\n\n466\n00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:38.260\nWhich means, the more times I write to a\nsolid state drive, I'm reducing its life.\n\n467\n00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:41.500\nRight, what do you think\na defragmenter does?\n\n468\n00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:45.540\nIt pulls information out,\nputs it in cache, erases the cell and\n\n469\n00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:47.320\nthen writes it back.\n\n470\n00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:48.870\nAnd it does that over and over and over.\n\n471\n00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:51.250\nSo, essentially what\nyou're doing is you're,\n\n472\n00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:55.060\nif you could perform this defragmention\non your Windows wont let you do it.\n\n473\n00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:58.030\nIt could really degrade the lifetime\nof your solid state drive,\n\n474\n00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:01.020\nthat's why it says doesn't\nneed optimization.\n\n475\n00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:06.640\nAnd in this case if I was to try to\nAnalyze that, all right, Optimize.\n\n476\n00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.060\nAnd notice it says optimize not available.\n\n477\n00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:11.130\nCan't do it on solid state drives.\n\n478\n00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:13.645\nHowever, I kind of fooled it.\n\n479\n00:25:13.645 --> 00:25:17.170\n[LAUGH] I did a- this is actually\na virtual drive, believe it or not, but\n\n480\n00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:20.010\nit looks to the system like it's\nan actual physical drive, so\n\n481\n00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:22.080\nI could actually analyze this, right?\n\n482\n00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:27.530\nIt's telling me that everything's okay,\nit's 100% space efficiency.\n\n483\n00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:28.850\nThe files are all close together,\n\n484\n00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:31.500\nnice contiguous fashion, so\nI don't need to do anything.\n\n485\n00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.850\nHowever, if I wanted to, so\nquick that you can't even see it.\n\n486\n00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:37.930\n&gt;&gt; I think it's a big whopping 4\nMegs in size at this point, right?\n\n487\n00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:38.600\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n488\n00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.220\nThat's right.\n[LAUGH] We got maybe 4 MB in there.\n\n489\n00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:42.617\nSo it said okay, I'm done.\n\n490\n00:25:42.617 --> 00:25:44.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, but\n\n491\n00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.760\nyou can optimize it that way.\n\n492\n00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:49.652\nThe other thing that I wanna kinda\nmention real quick here is, check disk.\n\n493\n00:25:49.652 --> 00:25:56.830\nNow, with check disk there\nare a couple of options here.\n\n494\n00:25:56.830 --> 00:26:00.400\nI can run check disk right here from\nthe graphical user interface and\n\n495\n00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.980\nit will tell me right away.\n\n496\n00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:04.520\nIt'll say we haven't found\nany errors on this drive but\n\n497\n00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.462\nif you want you can scan it anyways.\n\n498\n00:26:06.462 --> 00:26:09.010\nAll right, I'm not going to scan\nthis drive because it's telling me\n\n499\n00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:10.110\nI don't need to.\n\n500\n00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:13.040\nBut what that does is it has\nthe ability to check the logical\n\n501\n00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.160\nintegrity of the file system.\n\n502\n00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.200\nAnd when it checks the logical integrity\nof the file system it finds out,\n\n503\n00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.260\ndo I have any errors?\n\n504\n00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:21.460\nIf I have errors, can I fix those errors?\n\n505\n00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:22.920\nIf I have bad sectors on the drive,\n\n506\n00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:26.230\nlet's make sure that we don't write back\nto those, so I'll mark those as bad.\n\n507\n00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:29.530\nSo it goes through, and\nit does exactly what the name says.\n\n508\n00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:32.479\nIt checks the disk, all right.\n\n509\n00:26:32.479 --> 00:26:37.410\nNow, you can also do this\nfrom the command line.\n\n510\n00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:40.820\nAll right, if I decided to run chkdsk.\n\n511\n00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:46.730\nAnd I know it's kinda hard to see, and I\nput a /f, that would fix the file system.\n\n512\n00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:50.055\nIf it can repair it or, that would\ncheck the file system excuse me but\n\n513\n00:26:50.055 --> 00:26:54.535\nif I wanna make the repairs to it I\ncould use a /r and I can run this.\n\n514\n00:26:54.535 --> 00:26:57.265\nNow it's gonna tell me\naccess denied you don't have\n\n515\n00:26:57.265 --> 00:26:59.795\nsufficient privileges I\ndon't really wanna run it.\n\n516\n00:26:59.795 --> 00:27:03.835\nAnd then what it's gonna do is it's gonna\nschedule it a little bit difference in\n\n517\n00:27:03.835 --> 00:27:05.845\nscheduling and it reboots.\n\n518\n00:27:05.845 --> 00:27:09.445\nAnd when it reboots it doesn't load the\noperating system it runs check disk and\n\n519\n00:27:09.445 --> 00:27:10.375\nit runs it on the drive and\n\n520\n00:27:10.375 --> 00:27:15.200\nit gives you a little low resolution\nsplash screen on what it's doing.\n\n521\n00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.180\nAll right, and then it tells you what\nit has found or what it hasn't found.\n\n522\n00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:20.466\nIn fact I've changed my mind.\n\n523\n00:27:20.466 --> 00:27:21.238\nI'm going to run it anyway.\n\n524\n00:27:21.238 --> 00:27:22.240\nI'm going to live dangerously.\n\n525\n00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.420\nSo It's going to scan it.\n\n526\n00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:26.425\nIt says, about 7 minutes,\nabout 5 seconds, stop.\n\n527\n00:27:26.425 --> 00:27:28.910\n[LAUGH] Apparently we're\noptimized pretty good here.\n\n528\n00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:31.590\nLet's go ahead and let it run but\nwhat I wanna kinda show you is more so\n\n529\n00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:33.170\nwhat you would see in the splash screen.\n\n530\n00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:39.110\nThe great thing is inside,\nlet me try that one more time, I know\n\n531\n00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:42.635\nit's in the Applications log but the good\nthing is if you say CD tells it will take\n\n532\n00:27:42.635 --> 00:27:46.905\nyou right there since it only took not\neven ten seconds we'll just wait here for\n\n533\n00:27:46.905 --> 00:27:52.845\na second, and once it runs, notice\nthe show details, well what did you find?\n\n534\n00:27:52.845 --> 00:27:55.355\nIf I choose this it's actually gonna\nopen and then view in the background and\n\n535\n00:27:55.355 --> 00:27:58.900\nkinda, but it gets me right to\nthe application that I want.\n\n536\n00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.410\nAll right and this is the details.\n\n537\n00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:02.222\nThese are the details\nthat I'm looking for.\n\n538\n00:28:02.222 --> 00:28:07.550\nNow, you would see these if you were\nrunning it from the command prompt.\n\n539\n00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:12.280\nThis would be all the information\nthat would pass by the screen\n\n540\n00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:16.210\nas check disk was running from\nthe command prompt on a reboot.\n\n541\n00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:19.270\nYou could still see that\ninformation inside of admin viewer.\n\n542\n00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:22.590\nJust a heads up for\nthe exam in case it happens.\n\n543\n00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:26.878\nAll right so we've got the general\ndetails, right, we've got our,\n\n544\n00:28:26.878 --> 00:28:29.290\nlet's see, our Chkdsk here.\n\n545\n00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:31.270\nOne last thing,\nI know we're running short on time.\n\n546\n00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:36.470\nOne of the last things I wanna\nkinda mention here is this little\n\n547\n00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:38.800\nthing called OneDrive.\n\n548\n00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.430\nNow what is OneDrive?\n\n549\n00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:43.260\nWell, OneDrive is\nthe cloud-based solution.\n\n550\n00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:46.260\nGet rid of some of these open stuff here.\n\n551\n00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.040\nOneDrive is a Cloud based\nsolution that you can see and\n\n552\n00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.810\nI don't have it setup here where\nI can enter an email address.\n\n553\n00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:54.400\nI can enter basically a Microsoft account.\n\n554\n00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:58.610\nAnd it allows me anything that I\nstore in the OneDrive location\n\n555\n00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:00.280\ngets synchronized up to the cloud.\n\n556\n00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:05.120\nThe other cool thing is if I have OneDrive\nattached or my Microsoft account attached\n\n557\n00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:10.480\nto multiple devices,\nif I decide to save something in OneDrive,\n\n558\n00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:13.930\nyeah, it syncs to the cloud but it syncs\nto all those other devices as well.\n\n559\n00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:16.310\nSo it's a very, very good thing to have.\n\n560\n00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:18.220\nAnd if I delete something from here,\n\n561\n00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:22.930\nI can go to the recycle bin, logging\nin to again, essentially Office 365.\n\n562\n00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:27.720\nGo to OneDrive, and I can find it in\nOneDrive's recycle bin, which is nice,\n\n563\n00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:31.080\nbecause I know there's many times that\nI put something in the recycle bin, and\n\n564\n00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.870\nI'm like, I'm going to go ahead and\nrestore it, and\n\n565\n00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:37.010\nthen I come in and I'm like, man,\nI haven't done house cleaning, delete.\n\n566\n00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:40.780\nWhere are those financial documents\nthat I thought I'd restore later?\n\n567\n00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:42.380\nIn electrical limbo.\n\n568\n00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:43.790\nNot so with OneDrive.\n\n569\n00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:46.530\nYou can restore them from the cloud, and\nthat's one of the benefits of having\n\n570\n00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:50.360\nthe OneDrive software, but remember it\ndoes require a Microsoft account, and\n\n571\n00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:53.290\nyou have to log in to Windows with it.\n\n572\n00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:54.190\nYou could see that right here.\n\n573\n00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:57.610\nSo, another way that we could manage\nour storage inside of our devices,\n\n574\n00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:00.540\nand we don't even have to really\nset up things like SPAN drives.\n\n575\n00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:02.300\nI mean,\nI start running out of drive space,\n\n576\n00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.720\nI'll just put everything on OneDrive and\n\n577\n00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:07.280\nwe'll store it up in the cloud, provided\nI have enough storage space in OneDrive.\n\n578\n00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:08.610\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\nAnd if you need more,\n\n579\n00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:10.345\nyou can always pay and get more, right?\n\n580\n00:30:10.345 --> 00:30:12.550\n[LAUGH] All right, Wes,\nwe appreciate that.\n\n581\n00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:17.790\nA great look again at storage,\nwe took a look at the different schemes\n\n582\n00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:21.340\nthat we could use when we partitioned,\nwe took a look at converting discs\n\n583\n00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:24.920\ninto dynamic discs which opened up\na new world of possibilities there.\n\n584\n00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:28.900\nAll of a sudden we've got Span volume and\nstriped and mirrored and\n\n585\n00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:33.480\nwe also take a look at VHDs as well\nas taking a look some of the tools\n\n586\n00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.150\nwe can use, utilities we can use\nto keep those drives healthy.\n\n587\n00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:39.420\nAll right, making sure that we\nare aware of that disk has errors it's\n\n588\n00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:43.617\ngonna have any trouble storing our data as\nwell as taking a quick peek at OneDrive,\n\n589\n00:30:43.617 --> 00:30:45.910\nour cloud based solution in\na Windows Operating system.\n\n590\n00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:47.210\nSo we appreciate that.\n\n591\n00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:49.030\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n592\n00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:50.250\nSigning off for ITProTV.\n\n593\n00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:51.510\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n594\n00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:52.410\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes

00:00:12.211\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:14.004\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:16.466\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:18.118\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\n\n7\n00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:21.710\nin today's episode we are coming at\nyour with more of our MTA series.\n\n8\n00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.870\nThis one specifically, the 98 349 exam.\n\n9\n00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.910\nJoining us back in the studio yet\nagain, our good friend, out mentor, Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:29.450\nWes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.420\nWes, welcome back, man.\n\n12\n00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.960\nHow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.040\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n14\n00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.770\nYeah, we're talking about\na lovely topic today.\n\n15\n00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.450\nThat's right, printing devices.\n\n16\n00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.750\nAnd I can tell you we've been talking\nabout a lot of different concepts through\n\n17\n00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.670\nour MTA series.\n\n18\n00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.700\nWe've been talking about troubleshooting\nlike, the machines themselves.\n\n19\n00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.820\nWe talked about networking issues but\nlet me tell you everything the sky\n\n20\n00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.162\nwill fall the day that you cannot print\nto a printer inside of your network.\n\n21\n00:00:54.162 --> 00:00:58.081\nSo while some of you out there maybe\nhave had to deal with this before,\n\n22\n00:00:58.081 --> 00:01:02.068\nmaybe if this is the first time you're\njust entering your way into IT,\n\n23\n00:01:02.068 --> 00:01:03.920\ngetting that MTA first.\n\n24\n00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.822\nMaybe you haven't had the lovely ability\nof learning what happens when the printer\n\n25\n00:01:08.822 --> 00:01:09.390\nis down.\n\n26\n00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.840\nSo, this is gonna be one of the topics,\nthe major topic today.\n\n27\n00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.492\nWe're gonna be looking at\nunderstanding printing devices.\n\n28\n00:01:16.492 --> 00:01:20.381\nSo let's go ahead, and let's just\njump right in, and let's talk about,\n\n29\n00:01:20.381 --> 00:01:24.085\nyou know the operating system,\nthe components you can see when it comes\n\n30\n00:01:24.085 --> 00:01:26.821\nto essentially what are known\nas print devices now.\n\n31\n00:01:26.821 --> 00:01:29.691\nLet's be careful with our terminology,\nbecause what you and I, and\n\n32\n00:01:29.691 --> 00:01:31.980\nI'm sure what Dan would think\nof as a printer, right?\n\n33\n00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.829\nThat little box over in the corner\nthat paper comes out of,\n\n34\n00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.217\nsome kind of media after you print,\nyou would consider the printer.\n\n35\n00:01:38.217 --> 00:01:42.931\nBut you have to be very, very careful\nin Microsoft lingo, because, well,\n\n36\n00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:47.868\nthe obvious thing that we would call\nprinters is not necessarily what Microsoft\n\n37\n00:01:47.868 --> 00:01:49.136\ncalls the printer.\n\n38\n00:01:49.136 --> 00:01:50.980\nAnd let me show you what I mean here.\n\n39\n00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.269\nIf we drop down to my Windows 10 machine.\n\n40\n00:01:53.269 --> 00:01:56.010\nI'll go ahead and\nopen up Computer Management here.\n\n41\n00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.290\nAnd we're gonna look at a service and\nit's kind of interesting.\n\n42\n00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.780\nYou say, well Wes,\nyou're gonna show us printers, right?\n\n43\n00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.976\nAnd I take you right to a service.\n\n44\n00:02:01.976 --> 00:02:03.200\nBut just bear with me here.\n\n45\n00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.987\nAnd you'll see where I'm going with this.\n\n46\n00:02:04.987 --> 00:02:07.819\nIf I expand out services and\napplications, and we'll go ahead.\n\n47\n00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.524\nAnd we'll click on services here,\nand we'll drill in.\n\n48\n00:02:10.524 --> 00:02:12.907\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nsearch these by name.\n\n49\n00:02:12.907 --> 00:02:15.536\nThe first letter of the service\nthat I'm looking for is P.\n\n50\n00:02:15.536 --> 00:02:19.010\nIt's called a print spooler,\nand here is the print spooler.\n\n51\n00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.664\nNow I want you to understand\nwhat this service is doing and\n\n52\n00:02:21.664 --> 00:02:24.815\none of the great things about inside\nof Windows is well we get a little\n\n53\n00:02:24.815 --> 00:02:26.823\ndescription of what the service is doing.\n\n54\n00:02:26.823 --> 00:02:29.542\nBut notice it says,\nthis service spools the print jobs and\n\n55\n00:02:29.542 --> 00:02:32.380\nhandles interaction with the printer.\n\n56\n00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.500\nSo what is the printer?\n\n57\n00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.327\nWell basically the service in\nthe background that Windows uses,\n\n58\n00:02:37.327 --> 00:02:42.142\nthe principle service and all of its\ncomponents essentially, it is the printer.\n\n59\n00:02:42.142 --> 00:02:46.730\nIf you look at the documentation up on for\ninstance if you're doing your studies\n\n60\n00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.822\nyou'll see ultimately what Microsoft\ncalls the printer is the actual logical\n\n61\n00:02:50.822 --> 00:02:53.435\ncomponents with inside\nof the operating system.\n\n62\n00:02:53.435 --> 00:02:56.951\nAnd they call the physical device that\nyou and I see, you and Dan and I,\n\n63\n00:02:56.951 --> 00:03:00.064\nwe would all call the printer,\nthey call it the print device.\n\n64\n00:03:00.064 --> 00:03:02.080\nSo I'm not gonna correct you.\n\n65\n00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.690\nIf you and I were talking\noutside of an exam endeavour or\n\n66\n00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.840\nwe weren't up there on TechNet's\ndocumentation and you said, hey,\n\n67\n00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.550\nthat's the printer I'm not gonna\ncorrect you with that one.\n\n68\n00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.190\nBut if you ever go up on Microsoft's\nTechNet website where they have all their\n\n69\n00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.651\ndocumentations for Windows.\n\n70\n00:03:15.651 --> 00:03:18.390\nAnd you're studying this don't\nlet it confuse you that what\n\n71\n00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.075\nthey call the physical machine\nis really the print device,\n\n72\n00:03:21.075 --> 00:03:24.840\nit's the target where the printer\nactually sends its information.\n\n73\n00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.038\nNow while we're here, let's talk a little\nbit about this principle or service.\n\n74\n00:03:28.038 --> 00:03:32.804\nPrinciple or service is what we really\ndepend upon if we're gonna send\n\n75\n00:03:32.804 --> 00:03:36.517\nany kind of communications\na print job to a printer, so\n\n76\n00:03:36.517 --> 00:03:41.466\nyou have to be careful with this print,\nwith this principle or service.\n\n77\n00:03:41.466 --> 00:03:42.886\nIt can be set manually,\n\n78\n00:03:42.886 --> 00:03:46.799\nsometimes by default its turned\nautomatic it might be disabled.\n\n79\n00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.340\nIf its ever disabled,\nyou won't be able to print.\n\n80\n00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.730\nAnd that'd be one of the first things that\nyou could check if you're doing some kind\n\n81\n00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.000\nof troubleshooting with the printer.\n\n82\n00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.760\nNow the other thing I'll tell you to do,\nthat you could do as well,\n\n83\n00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.590\nI didn't make any modifications here,\n\n84\n00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.690\nsometimes they'll tell you, we'll\nhave you turn the printer on and off.\n\n85\n00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.750\nWell remember, be careful.\n\n86\n00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.210\nIf you read the documentation, they might\nsay power cycle the print device, and\n\n87\n00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.060\nif they say power cycle the print device,\nthat's just fancy white paper talk for\n\n88\n00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.020\nthe fact that you need\nto reboot the printer.\n\n89\n00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.541\nThe physical machine.\n\n90\n00:04:17.541 --> 00:04:21.904\nHowever, inside of Windows you\nmight have the necessity to\n\n91\n00:04:21.904 --> 00:04:24.617\nactually reboot the print service.\n\n92\n00:04:24.617 --> 00:04:29.265\nOr in this case the print spooler service\nthat manages the communications between\n\n93\n00:04:29.265 --> 00:04:32.160\nwhat's known as your print jobs,\nthe print cue and\n\n94\n00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.010\nthe final output on the print device.\n\n95\n00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.624\nNow let's talk a little bit about that\nprint queue, what is a print queue?\n\n96\n00:04:37.624 --> 00:04:42.607\nWell, a print queue is the place\nwhere we send something that we\n\n97\n00:04:42.607 --> 00:04:45.970\nhave to print to that print device.\n\n98\n00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.940\nNow, the print queues could be\nmanaged on an individual printer.\n\n99\n00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.570\nIn fact, if I drop down here to our\ncontrol panel I'll tell you what.\n\n100\n00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.540\nWe're gonna do this\na little bit different.\n\n101\n00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.100\nI'm so\nused to going to the traditional ways.\n\n102\n00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.970\nLet's go the Windows 10 way\nthrough the Action Center.\n\n103\n00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.750\nNow I know my head's kinda\ncovering it up here.\n\n104\n00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.815\nBut we have this little Action\nNotification all the way in the lower\n\n105\n00:05:07.815 --> 00:05:08.560\nright-hand corner.\n\n106\n00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.932\nThat's the Action Center.\n\n107\n00:05:09.932 --> 00:05:13.920\nIn Windows 8.1 and prior it used\nto be inside of Control Panel.\n\n108\n00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.670\nBut we get a nice heads-up menu.\n\n109\n00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.220\nAnd we go up to all settings and\n\n110\n00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.400\nyou'll notice that what used to be\ncalled devices and printers inside\n\n111\n00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.540\nof Windows 8.1 and prior going back\nto Vista, is now just called devices.\n\n112\n00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.390\nDon't let it fool you, but\nif you're coming from the Windows 7 days,\n\n113\n00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.110\nif you're coming from the Windows\n8 days and you're used to these.\n\n114\n00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.462\nIf you take an exam and they say,\nwell where is this located?\n\n115\n00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:42.040\nA lot of times they'll give you a text\nbased answer and you've gotta remember,\n\n116\n00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.796\nwell it could be the traditional\nlocations, like for instance,\n\n117\n00:05:45.796 --> 00:05:46.770\nControl Panel.\n\n118\n00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.470\nAnd you can see here we have Hardware and\nSound.\n\n119\n00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.960\nAnd we have devices and printers.\n\n120\n00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.717\nSo just know that there's really\na couple different ways to get to\n\n121\n00:05:55.717 --> 00:05:57.541\nthe same location here.\n\n122\n00:05:57.541 --> 00:06:01.120\nLet me line these up\njust a little bit better.\n\n123\n00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.780\nI'm gonna test my abilities to zoom here.\n\n124\n00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.560\nBut you can see here right.\n\n125\n00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.790\nSame location it's gonna take you.\n\n126\n00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.314\nTwo different ways to get there.\n\n127\n00:06:09.314 --> 00:06:13.400\nThis happens a lot of times when Microsoft\ndoes updates on their interfaces right.\n\n128\n00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.050\nYou'll have the 70 different ways that you\nknew how to get to it prior to the new\n\n129\n00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.550\ninterface.\n\n130\n00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.910\nBut then you'll have a new\nfresh look a lot of times and\n\n131\n00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.810\nyou'll have a new coat of\npaint over an old technology.\n\n132\n00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.150\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n133\n00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:29.047\nSo once we are in the actions center,\nwe can choose devices.\n\n134\n00:06:29.047 --> 00:06:31.342\nAnd here's where we can add printers.\n\n135\n00:06:31.342 --> 00:06:34.870\nOr you can see the printers that\nare already connected to this machine.\n\n136\n00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.510\nNow remember one of the things\nthat we talked about is for\n\n137\n00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.080\ninstance the print queue.\n\n138\n00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.590\nWell, where do we manage the print queue?\n\n139\n00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.190\nWell, you can actually manage the print\nqueue in another location as well.\n\n140\n00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:49.340\nAnd then we'll come back to setting up\na printer inside of our Windows machine.\n\n141\n00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.620\nInside of Windows, you have what's known.\n\n142\n00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.550\nIf we get down into the Control Panel,\nwe go to System and Security.\n\n143\n00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.170\nAnd then finally,\nwe go to our Administrative Tools.\n\n144\n00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:03.640\nWe have here what is known\nas Print Management.\n\n145\n00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.310\nKind of interesting that you can manage\nthe print queue from a place called\n\n146\n00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.360\nPrint Management, right, makes sense.\n\n147\n00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.920\nBut we'll go ahead and open up this\nmachine, or this application here.\n\n148\n00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.689\nNow here's something to be aware of,\n\n149\n00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:20.848\nWindows by itself the client\ncan act like a print server.\n\n150\n00:07:20.848 --> 00:07:24.200\nIt's fully capable of managing\nyour network printers.\n\n151\n00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.650\nWhat do I mean by network printers?\n\n152\n00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:26.490\nWell there's a difference.\n\n153\n00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.569\nA local printer is one that's gonna be\nplugged right into this machine and\n\n154\n00:07:29.569 --> 00:07:30.673\nI can print to it locally.\n\n155\n00:07:30.673 --> 00:07:35.950\nI can share it out across the network and\nI can have other people connect to it.\n\n156\n00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.508\nA network based printer on\nthe other hand Is, well,\n\n157\n00:07:38.508 --> 00:07:41.136\na couple different types\nof network based printers.\n\n158\n00:07:41.136 --> 00:07:43.664\nOne that's shared out to\nthe rest of the network, right,\n\n159\n00:07:43.664 --> 00:07:45.985\nthat is plugged into another machine.\n\n160\n00:07:45.985 --> 00:07:50.274\nHowever, more common then that we have\nnetwork printers that are their own\n\n161\n00:07:50.274 --> 00:07:53.968\nindependent self sufficient\nsystem within a network, right.\n\n162\n00:07:53.968 --> 00:07:58.288\nSo that means they have their own network\nadapter, sometimes they have this software\n\n163\n00:07:58.288 --> 00:08:00.933\nbuilt right into them,\nthe print server software.\n\n164\n00:08:00.933 --> 00:08:02.448\nSo what is the print server doing?\n\n165\n00:08:02.448 --> 00:08:06.070\nRemember I told you the print server\nis about managing the print queue.\n\n166\n00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.612\nAnd I can actually things like\nprint queue if I go down here and\n\n167\n00:08:09.612 --> 00:08:12.090\nI expand down out our print servers here.\n\n168\n00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:15.410\nIn this case is the local machine\nkeep in mind what I have said\n\n169\n00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:18.180\nthe local machine can be\na print server as well.\n\n170\n00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:19.970\nAll right and\n\n171\n00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:24.970\nwe can go to the printers we can right\nclick notice we have the print queue.\n\n172\n00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:28.970\nAll right, the print queue is\nwhere print jobs that are staying,\n\n173\n00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:34.530\nthat are basically being cached,\nwaiting to be printed out on the machine.\n\n174\n00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:40.090\nYou can have a lot of print jobs that\nare sent simultaneously to one printer so\n\n175\n00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:43.670\nyou can have them start stack up,\nget stacked up in the queue.\n\n176\n00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:46.120\nHere's another real\nquick tidbit about what\n\n177\n00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.100\nmight happen sometimes with a print queue.\n\n178\n00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.230\nPrinters are shared resources, all right?\n\n179\n00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.790\nKinda like we have on our network\nwhen we have shared folders,\n\n180\n00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:00.370\nwe have shared drives out there, right?\n\n181\n00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:01.770\nWe have things like administrative shares.\n\n182\n00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:07.160\nWell, printers can be shared too if you\nare ever troubleshooting the print queue,\n\n183\n00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.520\nand you notice that the print\njobs are in the print queue,\n\n184\n00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:16.280\nI can tell you the one thing that this\nisn't is an issue with permissions.\n\n185\n00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.850\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n186\n00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:26.000\nWe can actually dictate through\nACLs who can print to printers.\n\n187\n00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.580\nSo, for instance, if I share this\nprinter out, we could ahead and\n\n188\n00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:31.900\nchoose apply to this.\n\n189\n00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:36.970\nAnd let me go ahead and\nlook at the properties of this as well.\n\n190\n00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:40.220\nWe'll look at things like\nsecurity settings, all right?\n\n191\n00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.084\nNotice that the permission here says,\nprint all right.\n\n192\n00:09:43.084 --> 00:09:47.690\nIf your print jobs appear\nin the print queue,\n\n193\n00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:49.900\nI can tell you it is not\na permissions issue.\n\n194\n00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:54.800\nYou have to have the print permission even\nbe able to send job to the print queue.\n\n195\n00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.910\nSo that's something to keep in mind.\n\n196\n00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:01.937\nNow, however, if I end up printing\nto a printer and my print jobs don't\n\n197\n00:10:01.937 --> 00:10:05.980\nshow up in the print queue, that might be\nsomething what I have to come back and\n\n198\n00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:09.295\ncheck out things like, well,\nit's down here somewhere.\n\n199\n00:10:09.295 --> 00:10:12.040\n[LAUGH] I have to check out things\nlike the print permissions.\n\n200\n00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:17.130\nYou can see things, like for instance,\njust the administrators, have the ability.\n\n201\n00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:20.265\nMy local administrator has the ability and\nthe administrators group.\n\n202\n00:10:20.265 --> 00:10:23.585\nHowever, if I want other people to\nbe able to print to this printer,\n\n203\n00:10:23.585 --> 00:10:27.085\nthen I am going to have to manage the ACL\nin order for them to have access to it.\n\n204\n00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:30.285\nSo it is very important to keep that\nin mind that permissions are also\n\n205\n00:10:30.285 --> 00:10:30.915\nan issue, too.\n\n206\n00:10:30.915 --> 00:10:34.155\nNow while we are here, let's go ahead and\n\n207\n00:10:34.155 --> 00:10:37.865\ntalk about the other things that we can\nsee inside of our Print Management.\n\n208\n00:10:37.865 --> 00:10:41.835\nWe've taken a look at things\nlike the add devices and\n\n209\n00:10:41.835 --> 00:10:44.250\nprinters where we can add\nour printers as well.\n\n210\n00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:48.470\nLet's talk a little bit more about our\nprint server here, or in this case,\n\n211\n00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.340\nprint management software.\n\n212\n00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:54.910\nOne of the things that I can do for\ninstance is not only manage local\n\n213\n00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:59.385\nprinters, manage our network printers,\nmanage our print queues.\n\n214\n00:10:59.385 --> 00:11:02.045\nI can also manage things like\nour drivers from here too.\n\n215\n00:11:02.045 --> 00:11:04.135\nNow one of the great things\nabout your printers,\n\n216\n00:11:04.135 --> 00:11:08.255\na lot of time today is the that fact\nthat they're plug and play, all right.\n\n217\n00:11:08.255 --> 00:11:11.945\nHowever, that's not always the case\nI want you to keep that in mind.\n\n218\n00:11:11.945 --> 00:11:14.785\nBecause of the fact that you might have\nsome printers that are a little bit\n\n219\n00:11:14.785 --> 00:11:15.845\nolder here.\n\n220\n00:11:15.845 --> 00:11:19.960\nAnd let me show you what\ncould happen potentially,\n\n221\n00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.990\nif you plug a printer into your machine,\nand\n\n222\n00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:25.440\nits drivers are instantly recognized\nthrough things like plug and play.\n\n223\n00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:29.360\nSo for instance,\nif I go back to our Control Panel, and\n\n224\n00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.740\nwe'll get back into print management\ndrivers here in a second.\n\n225\n00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.590\nIf I went to add a printer, oops.\n\n226\n00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:38.050\nIf I get it in the right location here,\nthat would help.\n\n227\n00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:39.280\nHardware and sound.\n\n228\n00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.150\nDevices and printers.\n\n229\n00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:41.980\nSame location that we were before.\n\n230\n00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.320\nBut I decide to add a printer.\n\n231\n00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.120\nAll right we'll go ahead and click that.\n\n232\n00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.160\nAnd now what it's gonna do is\nit's gonna take a second, right?\n\n233\n00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.220\nIt's gonna take a second, and\n\n234\n00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:54.610\nit's trying to discover\nthe printer out over the network.\n\n235\n00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:59.440\nAll right, now that being said, you should\nmake sure that things like file and\n\n236\n00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.260\nprinter sharing are turned on.\n\n237\n00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.650\nBut I just wanna show you here real\nquick about the print drivers and\n\n238\n00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:06.240\nwe'll get back to that.\n\n239\n00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.610\nAll right, so\nnotice that it isn't finding anything.\n\n240\n00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:11.600\nAnd that could happen.\n\n241\n00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.140\nIf your printer is old enough,\nit might be causing a compatibility issue.\n\n242\n00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:18.610\nYou might have to come in here and\nclick this link.\n\n243\n00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:22.700\nNotice that it tells me that no\ndevices were found, that can happen.\n\n244\n00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.390\nSo then you have to go\nthrough manual settings.\n\n245\n00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:26.270\nAll right.\nNotice that it\n\n246\n00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:27.930\nsays my printer is a little older.\n\n247\n00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:28.808\nHelp me find it.\n\n248\n00:12:28.808 --> 00:12:32.941\nNow you have to understand a little bit\nabout the print drivers to understand that\n\n249\n00:12:32.941 --> 00:12:37.012\nthere are times when you could run into\na situation like this where it's just not\n\n250\n00:12:37.012 --> 00:12:38.314\ngoing to be discovered.\n\n251\n00:12:38.314 --> 00:12:41.817\nSo let me talk a little bit about some of\nthe common print drivers that you see out\n\n252\n00:12:41.817 --> 00:12:42.465\nthere today.\n\n253\n00:12:42.465 --> 00:12:45.880\nReally there's two that\nare the primary ones today.\n\n254\n00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:46.690\nThe first one is PCL.\n\n255\n00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.930\nIt's a simpler format that's called\nthe printer control language, and\n\n256\n00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:50.909\njust like any other driver.\n\n257\n00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.310\nWhen we're talking about devices,\nwhat does the driver do?\n\n258\n00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:58.535\nThe driver takes that high-level\nprogramming language that our operating\n\n259\n00:12:58.535 --> 00:13:01.130\nsystem's written in and\nit translates it into the low-level\n\n260\n00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:03.939\nmachine code that the printer needs and\nunderstands to work with.\n\n261\n00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:11.712\nPCL, Printer Control Language drivers,\nare a simple format,\n\n262\n00:13:11.712 --> 00:13:16.860\nat first it was used for\nHewlett-Packard Printers,\n\n263\n00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:20.260\nnow it's pretty much a common standard for\nal laser printers today.\n\n264\n00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:25.070\nThe other one is the post script printer\ndescription language, boy that one's one,\n\n265\n00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:30.060\nsometimes just abbreviated at it's acronym\nPDL, printer description language.\n\n266\n00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.510\nAnd this was actually\ndesigned by Adobe and\n\n267\n00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:35.470\nthis has things like your post\nscript commands and codes.\n\n268\n00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:40.050\nNow with the PCL, be careful,\nbecause there are different versions.\n\n269\n00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:45.140\nAnd like any driver if you don't have the\nright driver for the right printer then,\n\n270\n00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:49.020\nlike you can see in that listing,\nyou might not find it on your network.\n\n271\n00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.900\nIt might not even be aware of it even\nthough it's plugged right in locally to\n\n272\n00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.260\nthe local port.\n\n273\n00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.700\nSo let me go ahead Let me\nshow you one more thing here.\n\n274\n00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.610\nAnd now that we've got that kind\nof in mind with kind of the common\n\n275\n00:13:58.610 --> 00:13:59.620\ndrivers that are there.\n\n276\n00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:03.240\nAgain, keep in mind you also have\nadditional drivers that I mention either.\n\n277\n00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.980\nLike, for instance, in this case where\nwe're in a virtualized environment.\n\n278\n00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.840\nSo you might have the hypervisor in\nthe background that might be running\n\n279\n00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.940\nthings like thin print drivers and\nstuff, that's really up to you.\n\n280\n00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.930\nBut you can also manage it, like I said,\nfrom here inside of Print Management.\n\n281\n00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:19.930\nIf you'll notice that we've\ngot our local machine here.\n\n282\n00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:22.040\nIf we expand this out.\n\n283\n00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.395\nIt doesn't do anything apparently.\n\n284\n00:14:23.395 --> 00:14:25.330\n[LAUGH] And\nwe can see the drivers that are here.\n\n285\n00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:31.940\nAnd now notice the drivers kind of\ntell what it's doing Print To PDF.\n\n286\n00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:35.550\nThis is essentially a print to file.\n\n287\n00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:39.160\nDan and I were kinda joking around\nabout this when off camera.\n\n288\n00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.960\nThis is the fake printer, right?\n\n289\n00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.780\nThis is when you say you\nwant to print something but\n\n290\n00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:45.050\nreally what it's doing is it's\njust taking that text and\n\n291\n00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:48.890\nit's outputting it to a file format,\nin this case Microsoft's PDF.\n\n292\n00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:53.160\nYou could use XPS as well, that's\nsomething that's more native to Microsoft,\n\n293\n00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.720\nhowever it's not nearly as common\nas printing to PDF because PDF,\n\n294\n00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:01.510\neven though it's an Adobe format,\nit's a widely accepted and\n\n295\n00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:04.660\nvery highly compatible type\nformat to use as well.\n\n296\n00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:09.710\nAnd you can also see things like\nyour driver versions here as well.\n\n297\n00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:10.250\nWhat else?\n\n298\n00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:13.300\nDriver isolation and\nsome of the additional information.\n\n299\n00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:15.520\nAnd here's the thin print\ndrivers I was talking about.\n\n300\n00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.100\nSo for instance, let's see here.\n\n301\n00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.910\nYeah, ThinPrint, Output, Gateway.\n\n302\n00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:23.780\nAnd these might have a lot to do with\nthings like your hypervisors and\n\n303\n00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:28.120\nstuff being in here, so\nthey might not always be there.\n\n304\n00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.420\nAnd you can also,\nI wouldn't remove the driver package, but\n\n305\n00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:32.840\nyou could see the properties\nof the driver.\n\n306\n00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.240\nRemember what happens when\nyou remove the drivers.\n\n307\n00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.890\nYou essentially remove your ability\nto communicate with the printer.\n\n308\n00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:38.930\nThat wouldn't be a good thing.\n\n309\n00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:43.090\nSo that would be a lack of\nunderstanding in print devices\n\n310\n00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.990\nrather than understanding and\nthat's what we're trying to do here.\n\n311\n00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:49.180\nAll right, so\nI can look even additional properties too.\n\n312\n00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:52.780\nAnd again guys,\ndo not mess with these files.\n\n313\n00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.518\nJust kinda showing you where you can\nget some information if you ever\n\n314\n00:15:55.518 --> 00:15:58.609\ntroubleshooting, you gotta figure out,\nwhy is this printer not working.\n\n315\n00:15:58.609 --> 00:16:01.251\nIf it happens to be a driver's issue,\n\n316\n00:16:01.251 --> 00:16:06.545\nkeep in mind you have access to this\ninside of your print driver properties.\n\n317\n00:16:06.545 --> 00:16:09.840\nOther things that you could do too,\nfor instance, the ports.\n\n318\n00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:13.973\nSome of the traditional ports that we've\nhad for a very long time inside of our\n\n319\n00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:17.737\noperating systems, your\ncommunications ports, com 1 through 4.\n\n320\n00:16:17.737 --> 00:16:19.861\nLPT, line printer terminals,\n\n321\n00:16:19.861 --> 00:16:24.040\nthe old Unix based ports that\nhave been around for a long time.\n\n322\n00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:29.360\nIR port of infrared, and then print\nto file, that's its own print too.\n\n323\n00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:35.430\nAnd then there's our thinprint VM drivers\nthere, for our virtual machine here.\n\n324\n00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:38.720\nAnd what's interesting here is it's the\nvirtual machine that's actually allowing\n\n325\n00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:44.290\nme to see the physical printer that\nwe have out here on our network and\n\n326\n00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:49.210\nthis actually one of the printers that we\nhave out there in our office space area.\n\n327\n00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.830\nWe can also look at things\nlike deployed printers.\n\n328\n00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:55.890\nI haven't, as you can see,\ndeployed any printers so\n\n329\n00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.869\nwe don't have any of those there.\n\n330\n00:16:57.869 --> 00:17:02.719\nSo let's go ahead and let's take a second\nhere, I know you got a few more minutes.\n\n331\n00:17:02.719 --> 00:17:05.921\nLet me go ahead and show you a little\nbit more about for instance,\n\n332\n00:17:05.921 --> 00:17:07.117\ninstalling a printer.\n\n333\n00:17:07.117 --> 00:17:10.159\nNow, I don't have a printer directly\nconnected to this machine so\n\n334\n00:17:10.159 --> 00:17:13.635\nwhat we are gonna do is just walk you\nthrough the basic steps that you would use\n\n335\n00:17:13.635 --> 00:17:15.095\nin order to install a printer.\n\n336\n00:17:15.095 --> 00:17:18.800\nThe steps are pretty much\ngonna be the same for you.\n\n337\n00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:23.940\nHowever, if you do have the ability to\nhave the device recognized automatically,\n\n338\n00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:26.650\nit's always a better\nway to let that happen.\n\n339\n00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:31.640\nSometimes you'll see that the device\nitself can have a little storage area\n\n340\n00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.310\nthat you're connecting to, and pulling\nthe drivers down to the local machine,\n\n341\n00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:37.140\nif you trust them and\nyou're administrative.\n\n342\n00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.770\nAnd that's probably something\nI should mention too,\n\n343\n00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:41.940\nyou need to be an admin to\ninstall drivers like that.\n\n344\n00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:44.900\nSo if it does require a driver\ninstallation keep in mind\n\n345\n00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:49.810\nthat when the driver's installed, it might\nrequire administrative level privileges.\n\n346\n00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.310\nSo let's go ahead and\nwe are going to add a printer.\n\n347\n00:17:56.350 --> 00:18:00.340\nAnd let's see if it gives me,\nyeah, rather than it wait for\n\n348\n00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.240\na long time here for it do the same thing,\n\n349\n00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.000\nthis is the newer interface that\nwe really should be looking at.\n\n350\n00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.060\nLet's just go ahead and click,\nprinter that I want isn't listed.\n\n351\n00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.570\nAnd we'll talk about\nsome of these options.\n\n352\n00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:16.122\nNow, if you have a printer that has\nalready shared out within your network,\n\n353\n00:18:16.122 --> 00:18:20.546\nyou could always connect to it\nvia its UNC path, backslash,\n\n354\n00:18:20.546 --> 00:18:25.090\nbackslash computer name and\nwhatever your printer would be.\n\n355\n00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:26.860\nJust like the example shows us.\n\n356\n00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:30.230\nAlso supports finding\nthat device over HTTP.\n\n357\n00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:35.810\nIf it's part of the directory you can\nalways browse to it if you have network\n\n358\n00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:40.600\ndiscovery turned on you might be able\nto discover through that feature.\n\n359\n00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:44.067\nLet me go ahead and take a second and show\nyou guys, remind you, I know we've kinda\n\n360\n00:18:44.067 --> 00:18:47.047\ntalked about this in another episode,\nbut let's go ahead and recap.\n\n361\n00:18:47.047 --> 00:18:49.927\nBecause there are some settings\nthat could be turned on or\n\n362\n00:18:49.927 --> 00:18:52.028\noff based on your firewall preferences,\n\n363\n00:18:52.028 --> 00:18:56.242\nbased on the location that you choose when\nyou connect this machine to the network.\n\n364\n00:18:56.242 --> 00:18:59.847\nSo we'll open up our Network and\nSharing Center.\n\n365\n00:18:59.847 --> 00:19:03.485\nWe'll choose Advanced Sharing,\nand you're gonna see that,\n\n366\n00:19:03.485 --> 00:19:06.378\nit doesn't have it in this program,\nthere we go.\n\n367\n00:19:06.378 --> 00:19:09.250\nNotice that we have network\ndiscovery turned on.\n\n368\n00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:11.720\nIf I wanna use that client\nmap there that you seen,\n\n369\n00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.470\nwhere it had the client icon in it,\n\n370\n00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:17.020\nI have to have network discovery turned\non in order to be able to find that.\n\n371\n00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:19.900\nThe other thing to keep in mind\ntoo is that if I decide that I'm\n\n372\n00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:23.070\ngonna take this local printer, I wanna\nmake it, let's say available to Dan,\n\n373\n00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:26.310\nI want it to become a network printer\nthat's shared out to everybody else,\n\n374\n00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:29.050\nI have to have file and printer\nsharing turned on for that to happen.\n\n375\n00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:33.140\nSo, just a couple of settings I wanted\nto mention before we got farther.\n\n376\n00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.310\nAnd we'll bring back this setting here.\n\n377\n00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:39.020\nAnd we'll just start this one more time\nhere, Hardware and Sound &gt; Devices and\n\n378\n00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:41.720\nPrinters &gt; Add a printer.\n\n379\n00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.440\nSo, you're seeing a couple of\ndifferent ways that you can do this.\n\n380\n00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.590\nWe'll choose the printer that I want,\nis it listed?\n\n381\n00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:49.950\nAnd the other options that we have.\n\n382\n00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:51.500\nIf have a network printer and\n\n383\n00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:55.940\nit's got an IP address, I could choose\nthis this option, and I could say Next.\n\n384\n00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:02.322\nIt's still auto detect, and here I could\nput something like if it happen to be,\n\n385\n00:20:02.322 --> 00:20:07.330\nmaybe it's being hosted on print server\n01, I could do something like this.\n\n386\n00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.441\nDot, let's see, demo.\n\n387\n00:20:12.441 --> 00:20:14.067\nOops, I'm gonna put a 1 in there.\n\n388\n00:20:17.534 --> 00:20:20.689\n.Demo.it, oops,\n\n389\n00:20:20.689 --> 00:20:25.630\nif I could spell I-T, pro.tv.\n\n390\n00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:27.170\nI could do something like that.\n\n391\n00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:30.519\nOr I could use an IP address as well.\n\n392\n00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:35.680\nI'm gonna go ahead and cancel that,\nshow you a couple of the other options.\n\n393\n00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.400\nBecause we also have the ability\nthat we could use Bluetooth.\n\n394\n00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:43.360\nIf you have a printer that supports\nwireless printing, Bluetooth, wireless,\n\n395\n00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.720\nyou could also discover that as well.\n\n396\n00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.880\nKeep in mind that network discovery\nwould also affect it's ability to\n\n397\n00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:48.560\nfind the printer.\n\n398\n00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:52.539\nOr not really recommended\nyou do it the last way,\n\n399\n00:20:52.539 --> 00:20:55.090\nwe can add a local printer\nwith manual settings and\n\n400\n00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:59.180\nI'm gonna kind of walk you through that\nprocess here too, so will choose Next.\n\n401\n00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:03.603\nRemember the ports that we talked about,\nyou select your port, in this case I'm\n\n402\n00:21:03.603 --> 00:21:08.290\ngonna do a local null port if you will,\nso it's kinda like a fake port.\n\n403\n00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:09.580\nChoose Next.\n\n404\n00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.400\nAnd then it's up to you\nto pick the drivers.\n\n405\n00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:16.080\nNow keep in mind that if you've got an\ninstallation media, you can choose this,\n\n406\n00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.990\nyou can load in the installation media,\nand\n\n407\n00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:21.410\nthen you could point it\nto that optical drive.\n\n408\n00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:24.520\nNow I know that a lot of our machines\ntoday don't have optical drives, so\n\n409\n00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.390\nyou could also point it\nto a USB thumb drive\n\n410\n00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:30.310\nif maybe you happened to go out\nto the manufacturer's website.\n\n411\n00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:33.940\nYou download it to the USB drive,\nslave that drive in real quick and\n\n412\n00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.630\npoint it down to that driver\nthat's locally there, too.\n\n413\n00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:43.240\nIf it supports Windows Update, understand\nthat this is kind of a roll of the dice.\n\n414\n00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:49.370\nAnd not downing things like,\nfor instance, Windows Update.\n\n415\n00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:54.620\nIt's just keep in mind,\nit's pretty good process quality control\n\n416\n00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:58.060\nto get that into Windows Updates, so\nyou might not have the current driver\n\n417\n00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:01.370\nif you are using that ability,\nor using that as your location.\n\n418\n00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:07.060\nLet's go ahead and\nwe'll look for Microsoft here.\n\n419\n00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:13.420\nI think we'll just use an open class\ndriver here, we'll choose Next.\n\n420\n00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.962\nNow, printer name,\nwe can name the printer, as well.\n\n421\n00:22:16.962 --> 00:22:21.180\nYou'll wanna keep in mind that if you\ndo plan on sharing this printer out,\n\n422\n00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:23.730\nyou wanna make sure that\nthe name's easily recognizable.\n\n423\n00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:26.630\nSo we know whose printer it might be.\n\n424\n00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:32.450\nSo we might do something like this,\nright here.\n\n425\n00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:37.160\nWe might do ShowHostPrinter,\nmaybe it's on our\n\n426\n00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:41.150\nhost floor there and we wanna make\nsure that we can recognize it.\n\n427\n00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:43.790\nWe choose Next, and\nit installs the printer.\n\n428\n00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:47.770\nNow, it asks me do you want me to\nshare this printer on the network so\n\n429\n00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:49.660\nothers can find it and use it?\n\n430\n00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.180\nKeep in mind you have to have file and\nprinter sharing turned on for\n\n431\n00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:52.790\nthat to happen.\n\n432\n00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:58.480\nAnd we'll choose Next, and then if we\nwanted we could choose print a test page.\n\n433\n00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:05.030\nSo that's it really, and then you look\ndown here in your Devices and Printers.\n\n434\n00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:07.270\nYou can see that the printer\nhas been shared out there,\n\n435\n00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:10.940\na little two head icon there\nlets me know that it's shared.\n\n436\n00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:12.940\nIf I wanted to,\nI could see the print queue,\n\n437\n00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:16.060\njust by right-clicking on it,\nchoose See what's printing.\n\n438\n00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:17.600\nSo, keep in mind.\n\n439\n00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.370\nI told you you could manage the printer\nfrom the print management application.\n\n440\n00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:23.270\nYou can also do it in an individual level.\n\n441\n00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:27.050\nKeep in mind the reason I might open print\nmanagement is if I have multiple printers.\n\n442\n00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:29.640\nIt's much easier,\nthe least administrative effort\n\n443\n00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.720\nif I'm managing all the devices\nthrough a single location.\n\n444\n00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.320\nVersus here where I'd have to\nhop from computer to computer to\n\n445\n00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.720\ncomputer to manage them.\n\n446\n00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:40.087\nThat would not be the least\namount of administrative effort.\n\n447\n00:23:40.087 --> 00:23:45.210\nWe can also do things like, for\ninstance, see our printing preferences.\n\n448\n00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:49.260\nNot really too much to see here\nother than what the layout might be.\n\n449\n00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:50.820\nHowever, you can get really,\n\n450\n00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:56.280\nreally granular if you finally go into\nthings like your Print properties.\n\n451\n00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:57.741\nAnd we can see that right here.\n\n452\n00:23:57.741 --> 00:24:02.072\nFor instance, the sharing of the printer,\nports that we were talking about.\n\n453\n00:24:02.072 --> 00:24:04.888\nAdvanced is really cool cuz you\ncan do things like scheduling.\n\n454\n00:24:04.888 --> 00:24:06.605\nWhen is it available?\n\n455\n00:24:06.605 --> 00:24:10.001\nYou might say well no, I don't want\nsomebody you know printing that\n\n456\n00:24:10.001 --> 00:24:13.830\nSteven King novel at 10 o'clock in\nthe morning and now we've gotta wait.\n\n457\n00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:17.770\nOr we've gotta cancel the print\njob because well it's 500 pages,\n\n458\n00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:21.960\n600 pages long and somebody decided\nto print it in the middle of the day.\n\n459\n00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:25.690\nAll right,\ndo we want to optimize the printing?\n\n460\n00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:27.340\nNow be careful with this.\n\n461\n00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:28.820\nThey talk about print spooling.\n\n462\n00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:29.700\nWhat does that mean?\n\n463\n00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.850\nIt means taking the print job, writing\nit to the hard drive so that if I've got\n\n464\n00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:37.680\na power failure, I can recover\nthe print job and then I can print it.\n\n465\n00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:42.150\nIf you don't need that\nfunctionality you can see right,\n\n466\n00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:44.010\nstart printing it immediately.\n\n467\n00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:45.800\nWe're not worried about our power loss.\n\n468\n00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.680\nThat's up to you keep in mind.\n\n469\n00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:54.080\nWe talk about speed versus redundancy,\nbeing able to recover.\n\n470\n00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.290\nThis might be an issue as well.\n\n471\n00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:56.560\nAll right.\n\n472\n00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.950\nAnd then finally some color\nmanagement options and\n\n473\n00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:02.000\nthat just takes you into\nsome more advanced profiles.\n\n474\n00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.070\nI wouldn't worry about that too much for\nthis exam but it is there.\n\n475\n00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:08.370\nAnd then finally your ACL for\ncontrolling access.\n\n476\n00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:11.540\nAll right, so\nwe've talked about print file.\n\n477\n00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:16.740\nIf I ever needed to disconnect this\nprinter, it would be as simple as removing\n\n478\n00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:20.150\nthe device by right clicking on it and\nchoosing remove device.\n\n479\n00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:23.240\nI'll do like that and it is gone.\n\n480\n00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.590\n&gt;&gt; Let me say, if that ever doesn't work\n\n481\n00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:28.340\ndefinitely go into the print\nmanagement system.\n\n482\n00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:31.210\nAnd that will, has a a little more power.\n\n483\n00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:34.020\nWhen you're working a printer\nsometimes you'll have a little options\n\n484\n00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:38.100\njust working inside the devices area but\nsometimes they don't work.\n\n485\n00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:41.095\nBut if you go to print manager,\nit probably work there.\n\n486\n00:25:41.095 --> 00:25:42.135\nIt's a lot more powerful.\n\n487\n00:25:42.135 --> 00:25:45.055\n&gt;&gt; And you know you make a good point\nbecause when you launch Print Management,\n\n488\n00:25:45.055 --> 00:25:47.475\nfirst of all, you have to be\nan administrator to launch it.\n\n489\n00:25:47.475 --> 00:25:52.145\nSo once that page is up it's in\nthe administrative context, so\n\n490\n00:25:52.145 --> 00:25:55.605\nyou know it's not gonna be a privileges\nissue for removing devices.\n\n491\n00:25:55.605 --> 00:25:56.925\nNotice a little shield icon?\n\n492\n00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:02.070\nIf I'm nor administrative user I wouldn't\nbe able to remove that device so\n\n493\n00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:04.710\nthat's one of the good things about\nuser that print management software.\n\n494\n00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:08.280\nI you know you're administrator\njust to able to open it up.\n\n495\n00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:11.380\nThe last thing I wanna talk\nabout is they call out here,\n\n496\n00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:12.660\nthey call out Internet printing.\n\n497\n00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:17.040\nProbably not as common as some of\nthe other technologies like wireless or\n\n498\n00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:20.470\nbluetooth printing today,\njust because wireless is everywhere.\n\n499\n00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:22.530\nBut it is a feature that\nyou have to turn on and\n\n500\n00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:24.580\nlet me show you where you could do that.\n\n501\n00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:28.720\nIf we go ahead and right click on that\nlittle Windows charm which is programs and\n\n502\n00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.780\nfeatures.\n\n503\n00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:32.600\nThis is a feature and\nit does have to be turned on.\n\n504\n00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.420\nwe turn on the Windows features,\nit says, Excuse me,\n\n505\n00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:37.520\nturn Windows features on or off.\n\n506\n00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.850\nAnd if we scroll down,\nI believe it's printing services.\n\n507\n00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:43.920\nYeah, printing and document services, and\n\n508\n00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:48.180\nyou see the ability to use\nthe internet printing client.\n\n509\n00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:52.070\nThat's based off of the internet\nprinting client protocol.\n\n510\n00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:56.880\nHowever, keep in mind in order to use\nthis technology you have to have a print\n\n511\n00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.425\nserver on your network that\nalso supports the IIS role.\n\n512\n00:27:00.425 --> 00:27:05.260\nYeah, on the local network,\nyour computer is gonna use things\n\n513\n00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:10.016\nlike Network Discovery and\nRPC in order to locate computers.\n\n514\n00:27:10.016 --> 00:27:13.208\nHowever if they, this gives you\nthe ability that if they're going\n\n515\n00:27:13.208 --> 00:27:16.640\nacross a WAN Link, they can communicate\nwith the Print Server as well.\n\n516\n00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.710\nHowever, like I said,\nyou can see that it is disabled,\n\n517\n00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:22.220\nwe turn it on, we choose okay.\n\n518\n00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.920\nWindows goes through the process,\napplies the changes.\n\n519\n00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.610\nAnd one of the great things about this\none is it doesn't require a reboot and\n\n520\n00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:31.590\nnow you've got that functionality.\n\n521\n00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:32.870\nSo that's a little bit about printing.\n\n522\n00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:35.670\nOne of the things to keep\nin mind is that you'll\n\n523\n00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:38.380\nfind out how important printers are.\n\n524\n00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:41.050\nOnce your end users can't printed them.\n\n525\n00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:44.190\nSo just make sure that you're\npaying attention to the drivers,\n\n526\n00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:45.630\nthat is an important thing.\n\n527\n00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:49.280\nAnd make sure that you're paying attention\nto the security settings on the printer.\n\n528\n00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:49.800\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nAnd\n\n529\n00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.800\nWest makes a lot of great points\nhere when it comes to printing.\n\n530\n00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.750\nYou think, it's a simple like,\nI've got a little box over here.\n\n531\n00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:56.210\nIt's got a paper inside of it.\n\n532\n00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:58.310\nI hit the print button and\nwe're off to the race,\n\n533\n00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:00.160\nand a paper comes out in my print out.\n\n534\n00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.640\nThat's exactly what we're looking for.\n\n535\n00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.530\nWes has done a fantastic job,\nwe do thank you,\n\n536\n00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:06.180\nof showing us how things\nare supposed to work.\n\n537\n00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:09.510\nShowing us all the areas in which\nwe can look at printing and\n\n538\n00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:11.960\ngo that's where that is.\n\n539\n00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.050\nAnd of course the terminology\nlike he said,\n\n540\n00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:17.450\nextremely important when\nit comes to exam time.\n\n541\n00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:21.240\nNeither of us are gonna go,\nthat's actually a print device, and\n\n542\n00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.810\nput our little pinkies up.\n\n543\n00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:24.000\nThat's not gonna happen.\n\n544\n00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:24.850\nIn the exam, though,\n\n545\n00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:27.910\nyou gotta be that specific because\nthat's how they work on their exams.\n\n546\n00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:30.090\nSo make sure you get\nthat terminology correct.\n\n547\n00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:31.960\nKnow where every little bits and\npieces are.\n\n548\n00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:35.950\nIf things are printing wonky or\ndoing strange things, check those drivers.\n\n549\n00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:38.480\nJust reinstall it,\nyou always can reinstall the drivers.\n\n550\n00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:39.680\nThat's a fantastic thing.\n\n551\n00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:40.770\nThat does happen.\n\n552\n00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:44.450\nAnother little tip I'll throw at\nyou before we close the show is\n\n553\n00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:46.880\nyou can use a driver\nfrom the same company.\n\n554\n00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:50.440\nAnd maybe that will at least get you\nprinting until you get the correct driver.\n\n555\n00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.480\nAnd then you can download\nthem wherever you need to.\n\n556\n00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.320\nSo little tips and tricks out there.\n\n557\n00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:59.020\nYou're gonna find a myriad of interesting\nways to work with your print devices.\n\n558\n00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:01.002\nAnd it can be a lot frustrating fun.\n\n559\n00:29:01.002 --> 00:29:03.460\n[LAUGH] With that being said,\nWes, thanks for joining us today.\n\n560\n00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:06.370\nWe do thank you good folks for\nwatching, but it's for us to sign off.\n\n561\n00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:09.010\nFor ITProTV I've been\nyour host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n562\n00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:09.829\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n563\n00:29:09.829 -->

and welcome back.\n\n4\n00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,880\nTo a shocking episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,619\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n6\n00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:42,900\nBack again with Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,750\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n8\n00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,810\n>> It is going well.\n\n9\n00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,692\nI have not downloaded all of\nmy Taylor Swift albums so\n\n10\n00:00:47,692 --> 00:00:49,521\nSpotify has got me once again.\n\n11\n00:00:49,521 --> 00:00:52,344\n>> Man, now where are you going\nto find your entertainment.\n\n12\n00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:52,925\n>> I know.\n\n13\n00:00:52,925 --> 00:00:55,906\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right well fortunately we've got\n\n14\n00:00:55,906 --> 00:00:58,829\na little bit of technology\nentertainment today as we move into\n\n15\n00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:00,470\nthe final objective of MTA.\n\n16\n00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:06,059\nWe're diving right back into the Microsoft\ntechnical associate, the 98-349 exam.\n\n17\n00:01:06,059 --> 00:01:10,110\nAnd today's objective is,\nwhat are we operating system maintenance?\n\n18\n00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,820\n>> Operating system maintenance.\n\n19\n00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,630\nOperating system maintenance is very\nimportant because as we use the computer\n\n20\n00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,160\nthings are gonna change on our computers.\n\n21\n00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,760\nAnd a lot of times things are gonna become\nless optimal than the way that they were\n\n22\n00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,770\nwhen we first got the computer,\n\n23\n00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,460\nwhen everything was nice and\nfresh and, and fast.\n\n24\n00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,700\nAfter a while,\nthings can get, slowing down.\n\n25\n00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,860\nWe can even begin to\nactually lose some data, and\n\n26\n00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,070\nwe actually have to know\nsome of the techniques.\n\n27\n00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,990\nSo there are different maintenance\ntools that are available to us, so\n\n28\n00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,200\nthat we can actually keep our\nsystem as optimal as possible.\n\n29\n00:01:41,474 --> 00:01:45,550\n>> All right, so, this is a key piece,\na lot of people have experienced this,\n\n30\n00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:48,310\nwhere you buy a brand new computer and\nwhen you get it, you're like, man,\n\n31\n00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:52,430\nthis is the fastest computer I've\never had, this thing is awesome.\n\n32\n00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,480\nAnd then a year later you're\nlike man I hate my computer.\n\n33\n00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,660\nIt's so slow and somebody else just got\na new computer and theirs runs awesome.\n\n34\n00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,956\nAnd then one day you get bored and say all\nright let me just format this thing and\n\n35\n00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,184\nreinstall fresh and clean.\n\n36\n00:02:04,184 --> 00:02:07,740\nAnd you're like oh it runs so\nfast again, I just had to format.\n\n37\n00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,460\nWell, you really didn't have to format.\n\n38\n00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,770\nThere's some basic steps we can\ntake to maintain our systems,\n\n39\n00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,280\nkeep our systems healthy and clean.\n\n40\n00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,130\nAnd they will run nice and,\nwell, I'm not gonna say fast.\n\n41\n00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,760\nCuz, you know, if they're slow to\nstart with it's gonna stay slow.\n\n42\n00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,860\nBut to make it run consistently\nover long periods of time.\n\n43\n00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,490\nThe other thing is,\nsometimes things go wrong.\n\n44\n00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,550\nSometimes things go really wrong.\n\n45\n00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,000\nAnd you, you have a hard drive fail,\nor your system dies, and\n\n46\n00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,780\nyou don't wanna lose your data.\n\n47\n00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,741\nSo another part of maintenance is just\nmaking sure that we've got good backups.\n\n48\n00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,655\nThat we've got secondary\ncopies of our data so\n\n49\n00:02:40,655 --> 00:02:42,970\nwe don't have to run\nthe risk of losing it.\n\n50\n00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,589\nSo there are a few things that\nare available inside of Windows 7 that can\n\n51\n00:02:46,589 --> 00:02:49,923\nhelp us with that and insure that\nour systems stay up and running.\n\n52\n00:02:49,923 --> 00:02:53,406\nAnd when they aren't up and running that\nwe have some method to quickly recover\n\n53\n00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:56,122\nfrom that and get back up and\nrunning as quickly as possible.\n\n54\n00:02:56,122 --> 00:02:57,954\n>> Now as important as the,\n\n55\n00:02:57,954 --> 00:03:03,140\nthe optimal way that our computers\nwork as fast as one can work.\n\n56\n00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,500\nI think Don, even more critical\nis that we don't lose data.\n\n57\n00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,380\nSo where we'd like to begin is to\nmake sure that we don't lose data.\n\n58\n00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,778\nSo let's go and\ntalk about the idea of backups and\n\n59\n00:03:12,778 --> 00:03:16,421\nmaking sure that we actually know how\nto run a backup inside of Windows 7.\n\n60\n00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:20,896\n>> And there's actually more than one\nbackup method inside of Windows 7 and it's\n\n61\n00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:26,080\na matter of maybe, maybe it's a matter of\npicking which one provides what you need.\n\n62\n00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,860\nMore commonly though,\n\n63\n00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,980\nit's doing a mixture of all the different\nones that you cover all of your bases.\n\n64\n00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,270\nThe key thing to remember with backups\nis you are storing a second copy of\n\n65\n00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,810\nyour data.\n\n66\n00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,680\nWhere you store it, though,\nis the big difference.\n\n67\n00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,760\nThe first half of backup is\nwhat's called a local backup.\n\n68\n00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,240\nYou make a secondary copy of data\nright here on your own system, right?\n\n69\n00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,812\nOr to an external drive or tape or\n\n70\n00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:52,386\nsomething like that that's kept in\nthe same facility as your computer.\n\n71\n00:03:52,386 --> 00:03:55,882\nNow if your computer dies you've\ngot your data on this second thing,\n\n72\n00:03:55,882 --> 00:04:00,270\nthis other device, and you're able to\nrecover it and things work great, right?\n\n73\n00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,440\nBut there's one problem with that.\n\n74\n00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,350\nThe data is stored in the same\nfacility as your system.\n\n75\n00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,320\nAnd so,\nwhat happens if your house burns down?\n\n76\n00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,650\nOr a hurricane hits and\nyour computer's destroyed, or whatever.\n\n77\n00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,320\nYou're going to lose your real data,\nand your backup data.\n\n78\n00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,350\nThey're in the same place, so\n\n79\n00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,470\na local backup is not\n>> Perfect.\n\n80\n00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,640\nDoes give us protection from a lot\nof things, but it's not perfect.\n\n81\n00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,540\n>> Another way to do a backup is to\ndo what we call an online backup.\n\n82\n00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,850\nAnd this where we would\ntrust our backup copy\n\n83\n00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:36,110\nof everything that we're backing up to a\nservice provider that are on the internet.\n\n84\n00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,190\nSo what we would be doing instead is of\ncourse is actually copying our information\n\n85\n00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,750\nto somebody else's facility and storage.\n\n86\n00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,810\nAnd that way, regardless if\nsomething happens to my building or\n\n87\n00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,680\nmy own laptop or\nany device that's actually,\n\n88\n00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,170\nyou know anywhere in the vicinity of\nwhat I have I can still access my data.\n\n89\n00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:57,180\nAnd that is a better solution,\nit's not a perfect solution either\n\n90\n00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,840\nbecause you still have to trust\nthat backup provider to be able to,\n\n91\n00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,530\nto allow you to get the backups as\nwell as to keep your data private.\n\n92\n00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,580\n>> All right.\nSo let's say that I want to go ahead and\n\n93\n00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,460\ndo one of these backups.\n\n94\n00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,930\nWell, regardless of which one you choose,\n\n95\n00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,486\nyou're typically going to wanna\nmake the process automated.\n\n96\n00:05:14,486 --> 00:05:18,230\nAnd that means you don't just run a backup\none time and then never run it again.\n\n97\n00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,120\nAs you edit new documents and stuff you\ndon't want to lose that data either.\n\n98\n00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,270\nSo whichever solution we pick we need\nto make sure we're doing it regularly.\n\n99\n00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:29,040\nOnce a night, once a week, once a month,\nwhatever it is that works for you.\n\n100\n00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,870\nAnd remember the amount of\ntime in between backups\n\n101\n00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,970\nis your way of saying that's\nthe amount of data I'm willing to lose.\n\n102\n00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,240\nIf you do a back-up once a month,\nthen you're saying\n\n103\n00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,460\nif I have a failure it's okay if I lose\nup to 30 days of material, all right?\n\n104\n00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,410\nIs that actually okay?\n\n105\n00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,980\nFor a lot of people it isn't.\n\n106\n00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,610\n>> Yeah, most of the time\n>> You'll probably see people that will do\n\n107\n00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,070\ndaily backups and\nsometimes even weekly backups.\n\n108\n00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,580\nIn a business where you're actually\n\n109\n00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,770\ndependent upon that server to give\nyou the most up to date information\n\n110\n00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:01,320\nthey may even back up multiple\ntimes during the day.\n\n111\n00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,240\nMost of the time for someone like me\nI may do a daily or weekly backup.\n\n112\n00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:10,052\nAnd that again, tells me exactly what Don\nsaid I'm willing to lose up to that amount\n\n113\n00:06:10,052 --> 00:06:11,931\nof data and I'm okay with that.\n\n114\n00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:12,435\n>> All right, so\n\n115\n00:06:12,435 --> 00:06:15,550\nlet's take a look at some of the backup\noperations in Windows 7, backup methods.\n\n116\n00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,254\nYou know, and, and we got a chance\nto see which ones are ideal for\n\n117\n00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,942\nus and\nyou may use all of these at the same time.\n\n118\n00:06:21,942 --> 00:06:23,938\nThat would be the,\nthe perfect solution if you,\n\n119\n00:06:23,938 --> 00:06:28,000\nyou know weren't worried about Performance\nand resources and all that good stuff.\n\n120\n00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,680\nSo the first type of backup is just to use\nthe Windows backup system that's available\n\n121\n00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,440\ninside of Windows.\n\n122\n00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,440\nIt's a traditional style backup\nwhat most people think of and\n\n123\n00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,220\nbasically what it does.\n\n124\n00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,990\nIs it lets you pick either individual\nfiles on your computer, or\n\n125\n00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:47,670\njust the whole computer and\nback it up to a secondary disk.\n\n126\n00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:51,245\nNow that secondary disk\ncould be in your computer.\n\n127\n00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:54,735\nIt could be a removable disk attached\nto the computer, that's a better idea.\n\n128\n00:06:54,735 --> 00:06:57,305\nOr it could be a network share\nsomewhere else on your network,\n\n129\n00:06:57,305 --> 00:06:58,445\na completely separate computer.\n\n130\n00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:03,950\nThe further away from your computer it\ngets the safer your data is going to be.\n\n131\n00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,630\nAnd that'll be a decision we'll have\nto make when we do our backups.\n\n132\n00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:11,720\nNow here if I go into my Start Menu and\nI go to All Programs and,\n\n133\n00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,260\nactually it's under Maintenance isn't it?\n\n134\n00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,410\nUnder Maintenance,\nI've got my Backup and Restore.\n\n135\n00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,710\nIt used to be under Accessories and\nthat's where my tendency is to go.\n\n136\n00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,000\nSo we got backup and restore right here.\n\n137\n00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,030\nNow, it's the same utility that you use\nto back up data as well as to restore it,\n\n138\n00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,270\nto recover data if you have a failure.\n\n139\n00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,180\nSo that does make it nice\nit's all kinda in one place.\n\n140\n00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,050\nNow, when we go to back up this is\nthe first time I've launched it and\n\n141\n00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,550\nit's telling me right here\nWindows Backup has not been set up.\n\n142\n00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,220\nI've never turned it on and fired it up.\n\n143\n00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,988\nSo it's gonna give me the chance to walk\nthrough a very simple wizard to set this\n\n144\n00:07:42,988 --> 00:07:46,111\nup, and to set up a scheduled,\nautomated back up.\n\n145\n00:07:46,111 --> 00:07:49,821\nBut before I run this wizard I need\nto figure out what I am going be\n\n146\n00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:50,732\nbacking up to.\n\n147\n00:07:50,732 --> 00:07:52,310\nWhere, where am I going to back up?\n\n148\n00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:56,315\nIf I'm gonna back up to a network location\n>> I need to go an make sure I've gotta\n\n149\n00:07:56,315 --> 00:07:59,650\nshared folder on another system\nsomewhere else that I can back it up.\n\n150\n00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:03,421\nWith Windows backup,\nwhen you back up to a network location,\n\n151\n00:08:03,421 --> 00:08:06,116\nit can only store one backup and\nthat's it.\n\n152\n00:08:06,116 --> 00:08:06,685\nAll right.\n\n153\n00:08:06,685 --> 00:08:12,931\nSo, if I backup today, when I backup\ntomorrow, it'll overwrite today's backup.\n\n154\n00:08:12,931 --> 00:08:16,070\nSo, I get no history with\nthat type of a backup.\n\n155\n00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:19,620\nBut if I backup to an external\ndrive attached to this system,\n\n156\n00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,420\nit can maintain more than one backup.\n\n157\n00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,845\nAnd now, I can restore to yesterday or\nthree days ago or\n\n158\n00:08:24,845 --> 00:08:27,533\nfour days ago, depending on how\nmuch data I have, you know,\n\n159\n00:08:27,533 --> 00:08:29,618\ndepending on how much\nroom I have on the drive.\n\n160\n00:08:29,618 --> 00:08:30,679\nAnd that can be useful,\n\n161\n00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:33,928\nbecause maybe there's a problem that\nyou didn't notice for a few days.\n\n162\n00:08:33,928 --> 00:08:37,023\nMaybe a file got deleted and\nyou noticed it three days later.\n\n163\n00:08:37,023 --> 00:08:40,362\nWell, if you're backing up to a network\nshare and you backup every night,\n\n164\n00:08:40,362 --> 00:08:41,318\nit's already gone.\n\n165\n00:08:41,318 --> 00:08:43,406\nYou know, it's already gone from the\nbackup that's stored on the network share.\n\n166\n00:08:43,406 --> 00:08:46,714\nSo we may want to choose\nto do an external drive,\n\n167\n00:08:46,714 --> 00:08:50,376\ninstead you could back up\nto an internal drive also.\n\n168\n00:08:50,376 --> 00:08:53,737\nMicrosoft just wants to be a separate\ndrive from the main one where\n\n169\n00:08:53,737 --> 00:08:56,438\nyour operating system is and\nyour data gets stored.\n\n170\n00:08:56,438 --> 00:09:01,021\nSo that's exactly what I have on my\ncomputer, I've added an extra drive,\n\n171\n00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:06,061\nI've got my C drive, that's where my\noperating system is and my files, my data.\n\n172\n00:09:06,061 --> 00:09:10,083\nAnd then I've got an extra hard drive,\nwhich is my E drive.\n\n173\n00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:14,999\nAnd in my case, my backup drive here\nis actually bigger than my C drive.\n\n174\n00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:17,649\nSo, I've got plenty of room\nto store backups in there and\n\n175\n00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:19,316\nmaybe even have more than one copy.\n\n176\n00:09:19,316 --> 00:09:22,549\nIf it's smaller, you'll have to pick and\nchoose the different stuff you wanna\n\n177\n00:09:22,549 --> 00:09:24,878\nbackup, cuz you might not have\nenough room on the drive.\n\n178\n00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:27,479\nAll right.\n\n179\n00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:28,291\nSo, I'm gonna run through this wizard.\n\n180\n00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,849\nI'll just hit the Setup Backup and\n\n181\n00:09:29,849 --> 00:09:33,350\nit's gonna start walking us through\nthat process of getting it configured.\n\n182\n00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:36,804\nAnd if we have anything that's not\ncompatible or might cause a problem,\n\n183\n00:09:36,804 --> 00:09:37,833\nit's gonna warn us.\n\n184\n00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:41,543\nIn my case, it spotted that E drive and\nit said, it's recommended.\n\n185\n00:09:41,543 --> 00:09:45,415\nThat's the best place to put it,\non a separate this, but\n\n186\n00:09:45,415 --> 00:09:47,283\nit also sees my DVD burner.\n\n187\n00:09:47,283 --> 00:09:50,329\nI could back up to the DVD burner, but\n\n188\n00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:55,261\nyour normal DVD will store\nabout 4.3 gigabytes of data.\n\n189\n00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,176\nThey have dual-layer DVDs that do\n9 gigs but they're more expensive.\n\n190\n00:09:58,176 --> 00:10:01,084\nSo your normal ones only\nstore 4.3 gigs of data.\n\n191\n00:10:01,084 --> 00:10:05,225\nIf my hard drive is 60 gigs,\nhow many DVDs would it take to backup?\n\n192\n00:10:05,225 --> 00:10:05,736\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n193\n00:10:05,736 --> 00:10:07,360\n15 or 16 at least, yeah.\n\n194\n00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,268\n>> Quite a few and\nduring the whole backup,\n\n195\n00:10:09,268 --> 00:10:12,308\nI have to be sitting there swapping\nout disc when they filled up.\n\n196\n00:10:12,308 --> 00:10:14,405\nThat's not an ideal solution.\n\n197\n00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,008\nAll right.\n\n198\n00:10:15,008 --> 00:10:17,769\nSo that's why it's recommending\nthis other drive and\n\n199\n00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:21,249\nI've got my save on a network button\nright here, so I could do that and\n\n200\n00:10:21,249 --> 00:10:25,412\npick a network location, but I'll only be\nable to store one backup when I do this.\n\n201\n00:10:25,412 --> 00:10:26,926\nI won't have any history.\n\n202\n00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,992\nSo just be aware that that's\nsomething that you give up.\n\n203\n00:10:29,992 --> 00:10:31,793\nAll right.\nI'm going to back up to that drive,\n\n204\n00:10:31,793 --> 00:10:32,903\nthough and I'll hit Next.\n\n205\n00:10:32,903 --> 00:10:36,326\nAnd now,\nit's gonna ask me what I wanna do.\n\n206\n00:10:36,326 --> 00:10:39,128\nThe default option is this\nlet Windows choose and\n\n207\n00:10:39,128 --> 00:10:42,078\nwhat Windows chooses is to\nbackup the whole thing.\n\n208\n00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:46,778\nSo, it's gonna backup the entire system,\nall the applications,\n\n209\n00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:49,675\nall the software, my profile, my data.\n\n210\n00:10:49,675 --> 00:10:51,542\nThe whole shebang, okay?\n\n211\n00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:53,908\nAnd that's the easiest way to restore too.\n\n212\n00:10:53,908 --> 00:10:54,919\nWhen I go to restore,\n\n213\n00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:58,358\nI've got the whole computer backup\nright here and we're taken care of.\n\n214\n00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:02,142\nBut if I know for\na fact that my data is just stored in,\n\n215\n00:11:02,142 --> 00:11:06,445\nin one particular location and\nthat's all I wanna backup,\n\n216\n00:11:06,445 --> 00:11:11,195\nI could do let me choose and\nit'll actually give me some choices.\n\n217\n00:11:11,195 --> 00:11:14,166\nAnd here's the chance to go through and\npick what I'm backing up.\n\n218\n00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:18,291\nMy libraries any new user\nlibraries that get created.\n\n219\n00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,248\nHere's the hard drive.\n\n220\n00:11:19,248 --> 00:11:21,863\nI can browse through and\npick folders on the hard drive.\n\n221\n00:11:21,863 --> 00:11:25,877\nSo maybe I wanna get this\nNotepad Plus Plus and you know,\n\n222\n00:11:25,877 --> 00:11:27,783\nbusiness docs, whatever.\n\n223\n00:11:27,783 --> 00:11:30,079\nWhatever it is that I choose,\nI can go through and\n\n224\n00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,109\ncheck the different things I want,\nI'm being very selective.\n\n225\n00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:38,046\nBut notice this one down here,\ninclude a system image of drive C.\n\n226\n00:11:38,046 --> 00:11:40,973\nEven if I pick individual files and\nfolders up here,\n\n227\n00:11:40,973 --> 00:11:45,108\nit's also gonna backup the whole C drive\nand all of my datas on the C drive.\n\n228\n00:11:45,108 --> 00:11:49,666\nSo, it actually doesn't matter what I\npick up here, as long as this is checked.\n\n229\n00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:54,184\nSo, I might want to uncheck that and\nnow I'm just backing up these files.\n\n230\n00:11:54,184 --> 00:11:55,067\nAll right?\n\n231\n00:11:55,067 --> 00:11:58,677\nIf my computer fails,\nI have to replace the hard drive and\n\n232\n00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:03,266\neverything's gone, I'll have to install\na copy of Windows on my own and\n\n233\n00:12:03,266 --> 00:12:07,329\nthen I can restore these files\nversus if I had done a full backup,\n\n234\n00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:10,366\nif I had gone back and,\nand done the whole disk.\n\n235\n00:12:10,366 --> 00:12:15,262\nIn that scenario, I can boot up a Windows\ndisk and just from that boot disk it could\n\n236\n00:12:15,262 --> 00:12:18,790\nrestore my backup and\nput everything back the way it was and\n\n237\n00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,403\nthat's really ideal,\nyou get complete system recovery.\n\n238\n00:12:22,403 --> 00:12:26,332\n>> And it is also usually the fastest\nway that we can recover our system,\n\n239\n00:12:26,332 --> 00:12:28,228\nif we really need to get backup and\n\n240\n00:12:28,228 --> 00:12:32,246\nrunning as soon as we can in the state\nthat we last remember it, right?\n\n241\n00:12:32,246 --> 00:12:33,464\nBefore the backup.\n\n242\n00:12:33,464 --> 00:12:34,583\nDoing it the other way?\n\n243\n00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:38,236\nDon't get me wrong, you can do it,\nbut it does take more time.\n\n244\n00:12:38,236 --> 00:12:40,662\nSometimes, it actually\nrequires you to go out and\n\n245\n00:12:40,662 --> 00:12:44,185\neven find software that you may have\ninstalled let's say, a year ago and\n\n246\n00:12:44,185 --> 00:12:46,758\nnow you're like where\ndid I put that software?\n\n247\n00:12:46,758 --> 00:12:48,763\nWell, it's now asking for a product key,\n\n248\n00:12:48,763 --> 00:12:51,994\nwhere did I put that product key by\nkeeping the system image on hand and\n\n249\n00:12:51,994 --> 00:12:56,062\nclose by, when something does happen to\nyour computer, you'll wipe the hard drive,\n\n250\n00:12:56,062 --> 00:12:58,485\nrestore the image and\nyou're back and ready to go.\n\n251\n00:12:58,485 --> 00:12:59,042\n>> Yep.\n\n252\n00:12:59,042 --> 00:13:00,938\nNow, I am just gonna backup\na couple of files here,\n\n253\n00:13:00,938 --> 00:13:02,976\nbecause I don't want to sit and\nwatch backups all day.\n\n254\n00:13:02,976 --> 00:13:05,692\n[LAUGH] You know, it takes forever\nto backup the full system.\n\n255\n00:13:05,692 --> 00:13:08,469\nIn real life,\nI would backup the full system.\n\n256\n00:13:08,469 --> 00:13:11,160\nSo, I'll just choose those files\nright there in the library is that\n\n257\n00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,589\nI've unchecked the system image.\n\n258\n00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:16,927\nAnd so now, it's going to backup my\nlibraries and I'm adding in the business\n\n259\n00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:20,372\noption Notepad Plus Plus folders\nthat I made in some other episode.\n\n260\n00:13:20,372 --> 00:13:20,929\nAll right.\n\n261\n00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:23,082\nSo now,\nits got it listed what's it going to do.\n\n262\n00:13:23,082 --> 00:13:27,249\nIt's warning here that If I'm doing\nthe encrypted file system, well,\n\n263\n00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:30,066\nmy EFS certificates are not\npart of this backup.\n\n264\n00:13:30,066 --> 00:13:31,232\nThat's a problem.\n\n265\n00:13:31,232 --> 00:13:31,836\nAll right.\n\n266\n00:13:31,836 --> 00:13:34,726\nBecause it means the files that I'm\nbacking up, if they're encrypted,\n\n267\n00:13:34,726 --> 00:13:36,415\nI'm backing up encrypted copies of them.\n\n268\n00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,279\nAnd when I go to restore,\nthey're still encrypted.\n\n269\n00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:42,086\nIf I lost my EFS key,\nI won't be able to decrypt them.\n\n270\n00:13:42,086 --> 00:13:45,687\nUnfortunately, the only way to backup\nthat EFS certificate is to go back and\n\n271\n00:13:45,687 --> 00:13:47,103\nchoose to do the full system.\n\n272\n00:13:47,103 --> 00:13:51,291\nThe, the one that gets the entire image\nof the C drive, because that's gonna get\n\n273\n00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:54,752\nwhat's called the system state and\nthat would include my EFS key.\n\n274\n00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:59,535\nSo this is just a quick warning here\nthat I need to be careful about that,\n\n275\n00:13:59,535 --> 00:14:01,867\nbut I can also change my schedule.\n\n276\n00:14:01,867 --> 00:14:06,697\nHere's where I can set when I want\nthe backup to run and by default, default,\n\n277\n00:14:06,697 --> 00:14:09,162\nit's running every Sunday at 7 p.m.\n\n278\n00:14:09,162 --> 00:14:11,916\nAll right?\nThat might not be frequently enough for\n\n279\n00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:15,015\nme, so I might want to go daily,\nevery day at 7 p.m.\n\n280\n00:14:15,015 --> 00:14:17,452\nBut I might be using the computer at 7.\n\n281\n00:14:17,452 --> 00:14:20,261\nI'm gonna make mine everyday at 1 a.m.\n\n282\n00:14:20,261 --> 00:14:21,155\nSo, at 1 a.m.\n\n283\n00:14:21,155 --> 00:14:25,318\nIt's gonna run this backup and my files\nwill be backed up and ready for me.\n\n284\n00:14:25,318 --> 00:14:28,724\n>> And this is a great option to actually\nchoose, because normally most of us,\n\n285\n00:14:28,724 --> 00:14:32,308\nI'm not going to say all of us, but most\nof us are normally asleep at our 1 a.m.\n\n286\n00:14:32,308 --> 00:14:33,388\nTime.\n\n287\n00:14:33,388 --> 00:14:36,345\nThat way, the computer can\nactually take all the time and\n\n288\n00:14:36,345 --> 00:14:40,173\nthe process that it needs to backup\neverything without us interrupting.\n\n289\n00:14:40,173 --> 00:14:41,634\nNow, even though Windows 7 says,\n\n290\n00:14:41,634 --> 00:14:44,471\nyou can still continue to use\nthe computer while you're backing up.\n\n291\n00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:47,213\nIt's a lot faster, lot easier if we don't.\n\n292\n00:14:47,213 --> 00:14:50,992\nAnd that way, it has time, we're asleep,\nwe wake up in the morning,\n\n293\n00:14:50,992 --> 00:14:52,544\nour backups are ready to go.\n\n294\n00:14:52,544 --> 00:14:53,688\n>> All right.\nWhen I hit okay,\n\n295\n00:14:53,688 --> 00:14:55,209\nit's now gonna schedule that.\n\n296\n00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:57,509\nI'm gonna hit save,\nsettings and run backup.\n\n297\n00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:01,772\nIt's gonna run a backup right now and\nso it's gonna backup those files.\n\n298\n00:15:01,772 --> 00:15:05,439\nAnd now instead of sitting here\ntelling me windows backup isn't setup,\n\n299\n00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:06,289\nI get my status.\n\n300\n00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:09,485\nIt shows my drive,\nhow much space is available on it,\n\n301\n00:15:09,485 --> 00:15:13,546\nit's doing my backup right now and\nI can just wait until it's done.\n\n302\n00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,186\nNow because my drive is very,\n\n303\n00:15:15,186 --> 00:15:18,531\nvery big compared to the amount\nof data I'm about to backup,\n\n304\n00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:23,013\nI'll be able to run more than one backup\nand they'll all be stored on the E drive.\n\n305\n00:15:23,013 --> 00:15:26,062\nSo, each day, it's backup up at 1 a.m.\n\n306\n00:15:26,062 --> 00:15:29,558\n10 days from now,\nif there's still empty room on that drive,\n\n307\n00:15:29,558 --> 00:15:33,079\nI'll be able to go back and\nlook at all ten days worth of backups.\n\n308\n00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:36,796\nSo, I can see how a file was on Monday and\nhow that file was on Tuesday and\n\n309\n00:15:36,796 --> 00:15:38,499\nhow that file was on Wednesday.\n\n310\n00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:43,416\nBut if I start running out of space,\nit'll delete old backups to make room for\n\n311\n00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:47,519\nnew backups and so it's gonna use\nas much of that drive as it can.\n\n312\n00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,096\nOnce it's done, this little manage space.\n\n313\n00:15:50,096 --> 00:15:51,043\n>> Link will line up and\n\n314\n00:15:51,043 --> 00:15:54,443\nthat's where I can go and view how many\nbackups it has sitting in there and\n\n315\n00:15:54,443 --> 00:15:58,205\nI can manually purge out backups if I want\nto, you can go in and control it there.\n\n316\n00:15:58,205 --> 00:16:01,896\nBut otherwise, it's running and\nnow I got my backup.\n\n317\n00:16:01,896 --> 00:16:02,685\nAll right.\n\n318\n00:16:02,685 --> 00:16:04,289\nIf this is a removable drive,\n\n319\n00:16:04,289 --> 00:16:07,443\nthe backup will run when\nthe removable drive is attached.\n\n320\n00:16:07,443 --> 00:16:09,565\nAnd if I remove it, the backup won't run.\n\n321\n00:16:09,565 --> 00:16:13,062\nSo, all I have to do is make sure\nthere is a removable drive that\n\n322\n00:16:13,062 --> 00:16:17,440\nis lettered drive E, that's attached\nwhen the system runs its backup.\n\n323\n00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,556\nI've setup systems for other people,\nwhere they use two removable drives and\n\n324\n00:16:21,556 --> 00:16:25,690\nthat way they would attach one and they\nwould take the other one home with them.\n\n325\n00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,885\nAnd when they'd come into the office\nthe next day, they'd just swap them.\n\n326\n00:16:28,885 --> 00:16:32,737\nSo, one was attached to the system for\nbackups and the other was off site and so\n\n327\n00:16:32,737 --> 00:16:35,116\nthey did like a rotation and\nyou can do that too.\n\n328\n00:16:35,116 --> 00:16:38,033\nIt, it does support backing\nup to multiple destinations.\n\n329\n00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:40,670\nIt'll just backup to whichever\none is attached at that time.\n\n330\n00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:43,526\nSo, it's a pretty slick system,\nit's built into Windows.\n\n331\n00:16:43,526 --> 00:16:46,454\nI didn't have to install\nany crazy software,\n\n332\n00:16:46,454 --> 00:16:49,838\nit's installed by default and\nyou can make use of it.\n\n333\n00:16:49,838 --> 00:16:53,243\n>> Now, another mechanism that we have\nin place is something that we call\n\n334\n00:16:53,243 --> 00:16:54,119\nSystem Restore.\n\n335\n00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:59,018\nDon, what if I'm not really losing data,\nbut I installed a program onto my computer\n\n336\n00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:03,296\nand now that program has changed\nthe computer so much so, that I can't get\n\n337\n00:17:03,296 --> 00:17:07,781\naccess to certain things that I need to,\nbut I need to be able to get my computer\n\n338\n00:17:07,781 --> 00:17:12,623\nback and functioning the way that I need\nand that's what we use System Restore for.\n\n339\n00:17:12,623 --> 00:17:17,215\n>> Yeah, there are times where, while a\nbackup could work, it'd be much better if\n\n340\n00:17:17,215 --> 00:17:21,008\nthere was some way to fix our\ncomputer without going to the backup.\n\n341\n00:17:21,008 --> 00:17:23,385\nIf you go to the backup,\nyou're gonna lose data.\n\n342\n00:17:23,385 --> 00:17:24,070\nRight?\n\n343\n00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:28,709\nIf I took a backup at midnight and\nI have a failure at 11 a.m.\n\n344\n00:17:28,709 --> 00:17:32,573\nWell, that's 11 hours of data that I'm\ngonna lose when I restore that backup.\n\n345\n00:17:32,573 --> 00:17:35,023\nIf I could just fix whatever\nthe problem is with my computer,\n\n346\n00:17:35,023 --> 00:17:36,423\nthat would make life a lot easier.\n\n347\n00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:39,384\nThe problem is it can be very\ndifficult to fix a computer.\n\n348\n00:17:39,384 --> 00:17:42,100\nIf I got a virus or\nspyware installed on my machine,\n\n349\n00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,473\nhunting down all the little pieces and\ncomponents, that can be a real nightmare.\n\n350\n00:17:46,473 --> 00:17:50,311\nAnd so what Microsoft did is they created\na technology called System Restore.\n\n351\n00:17:50,311 --> 00:17:55,161\nAnd either at set intervals or whenever\na major change occurs on your system,\n\n352\n00:17:55,161 --> 00:17:58,151\nthe system can take\nwhat's called a snapshot.\n\n353\n00:17:58,151 --> 00:18:02,034\nKind of an image of your\ncomputer as it is right now and\n\n354\n00:18:02,034 --> 00:18:07,597\nthen when you have a problem, you can\nquickly roll back to that snapshot and\n\n355\n00:18:07,597 --> 00:18:10,715\nthe snapshot can be triggered by events.\n\n356\n00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:12,868\nYou can set it to run every day at 1 a.m.\n\n357\n00:18:12,868 --> 00:18:15,261\nOr whatever and you'll have it, right?\n\n358\n00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:18,355\nOr it's triggered by\nsoftware installations.\n\n359\n00:18:18,355 --> 00:18:22,450\nAnytime you install software or install\na driver, anytime you install a Windows\n\n360\n00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,771\nupdate for that matter,\nthe system will create a restore point.\n\n361\n00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,950\nAnd that way if the Windows\nupdate breaks something or\n\n362\n00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:32,835\nif the driver breaks something and\nyour locked out of the system,\n\n363\n00:18:32,835 --> 00:18:37,939\nyou can roll back to that previous restore\npoint and then you're taking care of.\n\n364\n00:18:37,939 --> 00:18:38,670\nAll right.\n\n365\n00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:42,587\nSystem Restore is pretty easy to\nconfigure and work with and you'll see,\n\n366\n00:18:42,587 --> 00:18:44,980\nit shows up in a few different places.\n\n367\n00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,560\nYou know, when we're in our Start menu and\nlooking under maintenance,\n\n368\n00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,190\nyou'll see Create a System Repair Disc.\n\n369\n00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:55,280\nThat's the disc that we can use to force\nour system to roll back to a restore point\n\n370\n00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,170\nor to restore a backup, if we don't\nhave an operating system anymore.\n\n371\n00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:04,130\nSo that one actually does kind of both,\neven though it doesn't say restore point.\n\n372\n00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:08,130\nBut the other place where we see this\nis if we right-click on Computer and\n\n373\n00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,120\nchoose Properties.\n\n374\n00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:14,500\nIn the system properties for\nour computer, on the left, left side,\n\n375\n00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,530\nyou have System Protection.\n\n376\n00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:20,460\nAnd under System Protection,\nhere's System Restore.\n\n377\n00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,705\nAll right?\nAnd we can choose that System Restore and\n\n378\n00:19:22,705 --> 00:19:26,005\nit's gonna bring up basically a little\nwizard that lets us walk through\n\n379\n00:19:26,005 --> 00:19:27,389\nthe System Restore process.\n\n380\n00:19:27,389 --> 00:19:30,254\nWe can create a restore\npoint if we want or\n\n381\n00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:33,725\nwe can restore to a restore point,\nif we need to.\n\n382\n00:19:33,725 --> 00:19:34,305\nRight?\n\n383\n00:19:34,305 --> 00:19:35,106\nAnd that's pretty important.\n\n384\n00:19:35,106 --> 00:19:35,710\n>> Yeah.\n\n385\n00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:40,062\nThe nice thing about the System Restore is\nthe way it words this is if you use this,\n\n386\n00:19:40,062 --> 00:19:43,275\nthe good thing is that you can\nrepair your computer system.\n\n387\n00:19:43,275 --> 00:19:48,257\nYou can roll it back to that previous\npoint in time without losing those changes\n\n388\n00:19:48,257 --> 00:19:52,875\nthat we might have made in between\nthe time our backups happened and now.\n\n389\n00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:57,895\nSo, it is a great option for\nus to use when we have a chance to do so.\n\n390\n00:19:57,895 --> 00:20:01,437\n>> Yeah, it it effectively rolls\nback your, your driver updates,\n\n391\n00:20:01,437 --> 00:20:02,708\nyour software updates.\n\n392\n00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:08,076\nIt rolls back the windows registry,\nbut it leaves your user profile.\n\n393\n00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:10,851\nSo your, your my documents folder,\nmy video, my music,\n\n394\n00:20:10,851 --> 00:20:14,663\nall those little folders you have in your\nuser profile, it leaves those alone.\n\n395\n00:20:14,663 --> 00:20:18,212\nAnd that way you're rolling back\nthe problem in stopping your computer from\n\n396\n00:20:18,212 --> 00:20:20,493\nworking, but\nyou're keeping your documents.\n\n397\n00:20:20,493 --> 00:20:24,651\nSo when somebody calls me on the phone and\nI say, hey, Don, I think I have a virus,\n\n398\n00:20:24,651 --> 00:20:25,513\ncan you help me?\n\n399\n00:20:25,513 --> 00:20:29,351\nWell, years ago, I would then spend\nthe next two hours on the phone with them,\n\n400\n00:20:29,351 --> 00:20:30,936\nhating every moment of my life.\n\n401\n00:20:30,936 --> 00:20:32,203\nAnd saying goodness,\n\n402\n00:20:32,203 --> 00:20:35,686\nwe've got to do all this stuff to try\nto clean out this spyware, whatever.\n\n403\n00:20:35,686 --> 00:20:39,868\nAnd now I just say, okay, can you, can you\njust restore to your last restore point?\n\n404\n00:20:39,868 --> 00:20:43,638\nAnd they do that and five minutes later,\nthe malware is gone.\n\n405\n00:20:43,638 --> 00:20:44,598\nThe spyware is gone.\n\n406\n00:20:44,598 --> 00:20:47,343\nThey're back to this kind of safe zone.\n\n407\n00:20:47,343 --> 00:20:50,199\nSo let's walk through this wizard and\nkinda get a chance to,\n\n408\n00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:51,551\nto see how all of this works.\n\n409\n00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:52,120\nAll right?\n\n410\n00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,664\nMaybe I should close the wizard for\na second.\n\n411\n00:20:53,664 --> 00:20:54,384\nAll right.\n\n412\n00:20:54,384 --> 00:20:57,106\nSo we start down here at the bottom half.\n\n413\n00:20:57,106 --> 00:20:59,021\nSee how I've got my Protection Settings?\n\n414\n00:20:59,021 --> 00:21:02,186\nAnd it's turned on for my C drive.\n\n415\n00:21:02,186 --> 00:21:05,688\nWhen you install Windows 7,\nit is turned on by default.\n\n416\n00:21:05,688 --> 00:21:09,581\nSo we don't even have to configure\nit unless we have other drives.\n\n417\n00:21:09,581 --> 00:21:13,068\nIf we have additional hard drives hooked\nup, we may need to turn them on and\n\n418\n00:21:13,068 --> 00:21:15,393\nI see I've got my E drive\nwhere it's turned off.\n\n419\n00:21:15,393 --> 00:21:17,855\nAny additional hard drive\nwill be off by default.\n\n420\n00:21:17,855 --> 00:21:19,885\nNow that's my backup drive.\n\n421\n00:21:19,885 --> 00:21:22,139\nI don't wanna restore plan\non my backup drive, right?\n\n422\n00:21:22,139 --> 00:21:24,001\nThat, that's something that I,\nI wouldn't want.\n\n423\n00:21:24,001 --> 00:21:25,279\nBut if this was a data drive,\n\n424\n00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:27,959\nif I was putting other information\non there I might want it.\n\n425\n00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:28,575\nAll right?\n\n426\n00:21:28,575 --> 00:21:33,345\nThen down at the bottom, I can configure\nhow restore, takes its snapshots and\n\n427\n00:21:33,345 --> 00:21:35,080\nhow it stores them.\n\n428\n00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,920\nSo, if we hit configure,\nit's gonna show us some basic information.\n\n429\n00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,862\nWhat do we wanna do?\n\n430\n00:21:38,862 --> 00:21:43,032\nDo we wanna be able to restore system\nsettings and previous versions of\n\n431\n00:21:43,032 --> 00:21:47,355\nany files that have been modified,\nlike drivers and software updates?\n\n432\n00:21:47,355 --> 00:21:50,815\nOr do we just wanna be able to restore\nprevious versions of files, but\n\n433\n00:21:50,815 --> 00:21:52,136\nnot the system settings?\n\n434\n00:21:52,136 --> 00:21:53,902\nOr do we wanna turn it off altogether?\n\n435\n00:21:53,902 --> 00:21:56,808\nRight?\nWe've got that choice to disable it.\n\n436\n00:21:56,808 --> 00:22:01,327\nOnce it's turned on, every time you make\na change to a file, instead of deleting\n\n437\n00:22:01,327 --> 00:22:05,388\nthe old file, what Windows will do is\nit'll mark the old file as hidden.\n\n438\n00:22:05,388 --> 00:22:07,688\nIt hides it, so you can't see it anymore.\n\n439\n00:22:07,688 --> 00:22:09,951\nYou see the new file,\nyou don't see the old file.\n\n440\n00:22:09,951 --> 00:22:11,292\nThe old file's hidden.\n\n441\n00:22:11,292 --> 00:22:13,498\nAnd when we do a System Restore,\n\n442\n00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:17,605\nall it does is removes the new file and\nunhides the old file.\n\n443\n00:22:17,605 --> 00:22:19,048\nPuts us back to where we were.\n\n444\n00:22:19,048 --> 00:22:24,299\nThat means that files that get deleted and\noverwritten are actually still taking up\n\n445\n00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:29,324\nspace on our hard drive and the more space\nwe allow, the further back our restore\n\n446\n00:22:29,324 --> 00:22:34,148\npoints will go and you'll see mine's\ndefaulting to 3% of the hard drive.\n\n447\n00:22:34,148 --> 00:22:35,702\nMy hard drive is 60 Gigs, so\n\n448\n00:22:35,702 --> 00:22:40,320\nit's defaulting to 1.8 Gigs of storage is\nthe maximum that System Restore will use.\n\n449\n00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,330\nIf I wanna ensure that I can go\nback further in time, you know,\n\n450\n00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,030\nmaybe you don't detect\na problem right a way.\n\n451\n00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,060\nYou might want to increase this number or\n\n452\n00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,180\nyou might want to decrease\nit to free up space.\n\n453\n00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,230\nSo maybe I'll bump mine up to 10%, right?\n\n454\n00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,019\nUp to six gigs of changes and\nI'll just hit apply.\n\n455\n00:22:55,019 --> 00:22:57,608\nNotice that my current usage\nis still just 460 megabytes,\n\n456\n00:22:57,608 --> 00:23:00,761\njust because I've given it an upper limit,\nit doesn't mean I've hit it.\n\n457\n00:23:00,761 --> 00:23:02,833\nRight?\nI've gotta start making changes before\n\n458\n00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:03,452\nthat happens.\n\n459\n00:23:03,452 --> 00:23:04,973\nRight now apparently,\n\n460\n00:23:04,973 --> 00:23:10,155\nI've got 460 megs of changes that have\noccurred since I since I did this.\n\n461\n00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:13,582\n>> When the system protection it\nworks very well and it's so easy,\n\n462\n00:23:13,582 --> 00:23:17,198\nbecause what you can do at this point\nis after you get it configured,\n\n463\n00:23:17,198 --> 00:23:19,111\nyou can create that restore point.\n\n464\n00:23:19,111 --> 00:23:22,771\nAnd then later on when you do run into\nproblems, you run the same wizard and\n\n465\n00:23:22,771 --> 00:23:25,902\nthen you can choose whatever\nrestore point you actually want to\n\n466\n00:23:25,902 --> 00:23:27,398\nrevert the computer back to.\n\n467\n00:23:27,398 --> 00:23:27,978\n>> Yeah.\n\n468\n00:23:27,978 --> 00:23:29,346\nWell, let's see that in action.\n\n469\n00:23:29,346 --> 00:23:32,231\nRight?\nSo so, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n470\n00:23:32,231 --> 00:23:35,063\ncreate a restore point right now and\n\n471\n00:23:35,063 --> 00:23:39,515\nI'll just call this the live\non air restore point.\n\n472\n00:23:39,515 --> 00:23:40,096\nRight?\n\n473\n00:23:40,096 --> 00:23:42,566\nNow, it is gonna create\nrestore points on its own.\n\n474\n00:23:42,566 --> 00:23:45,511\nIt's got it's own little schedule that\nit uses, anytime we change software and\n\n475\n00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:47,558\nstuff, but\nI'm gonna manually create one right here.\n\n476\n00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:48,859\nSo, I'm gonna create this one.\n\n477\n00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:51,784\nLive on air,\nI'm making this restore point.\n\n478\n00:23:51,784 --> 00:23:52,504\nAll right.\n\n479\n00:23:52,504 --> 00:23:55,720\nOnce it's done,\nI'm gonna make a change to my system.\n\n480\n00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,820\nI'm gonna disable my antivirus, right?\n\n481\n00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,520\nWhat what do a lot of viruses and\nmalware do right off the bat?\n\n482\n00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,020\n>> Exactly that.\n\n483\n00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:04,940\n>> They try and disable your antivirus, so\nI'm gonna disable mine on my own, right?\n\n484\n00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:08,220\nSo, maybe I come in in the morning and\nsee my antivirus is disabled and\n\n485\n00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,740\nI know I didn't do it.\n\n486\n00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,780\nWell, I can just turn it back on and\nsay okay, no big deal there, right?\n\n487\n00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,900\nBut I just don't know.\n\n488\n00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,270\nI don't know if there's something\nlingering in the background that I'm not\n\n489\n00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,230\naware of.\n\n490\n00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,670\nSo instead of just going and\n\n491\n00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:24,210\nturning it back on myself, I might\nwant to roll back to a restore point.\n\n492\n00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,050\nSo, my computer's healthy and\nhappy right now.\n\n493\n00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,960\nI set that restore point.\n\n494\n00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,610\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna go disable my antivirus.\n\n495\n00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:36,190\nSo I'm running\nMicrosoft Security Essentials.\n\n496\n00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:36,860\nI'll fire that up.\n\n497\n00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:41,120\nAnd I'm gonna go into my Settings and\n\n498\n00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,070\nI'm gonna take my real-time protection and\nturn it off.\n\n499\n00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,730\nAll right, now that it's off,\nit made a nice big red bar right there,\n\n500\n00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,170\nmy PC is at risk.\n\n501\n00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:54,079\nI'm starting to get pop-ups down here and,\nand again if, if I'm an attacker,\n\n502\n00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:55,010\nwhat am I gonna do?\n\n503\n00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:57,470\nI'm gonna try and\ndisable these warnings too, right?\n\n504\n00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,690\nOop, that's not what I want.\n\n505\n00:24:58,690 --> 00:24:59,630\nI wanted my Action Center.\n\n506\n00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,780\nIt's gonna take me everywhere\nexcept where I want.\n\n507\n00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,170\nHere we go.\nAll right.\n\n508\n00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,500\nSo I'm gonna go in my Action Center,\nI'm gonna say,\n\n509\n00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,720\nturn off messages about spyware,\nturn off messages about virus protection.\n\n510\n00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,210\nI don't wanna see that stuff, all right?\n\n511\n00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,840\nSo now, now my computer looks happy.\n\n512\n00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:19,370\nWhat I don't know is somebody went\nbehind me and turned off my spyware or\n\n513\n00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,440\nput a virus on here.\n\n514\n00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,580\nAnd I'm not even getting\nbubbles letting me know that.\n\n515\n00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,510\nSo I might not be aware of it.\n\n516\n00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,920\nBut I start seeing pop-ups.\n\n517\n00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,390\nI start seeing my home\npage getting changed and\n\n518\n00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,030\nI can't, can't set it back, right?\n\n519\n00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:33,520\nSo instead of instead of\nwhatever my home page is,\n\n520\n00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,664\nGoogle, maybe it got changed to iwon.com.\n\n521\n00:25:36,664 --> 00:25:38,919\nThat's a, oh.\n\n522\n00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:40,367\nHm.\n[CROSSTALK] This used\n\n523\n00:25:40,367 --> 00:25:43,627\nto be the one that spyware would\nalways send you to, you know,\n\n524\n00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:48,162\nwhere you, you'd be tied to like\naskJeeves.com or ask.com, whatever.\n\n525\n00:25:48,162 --> 00:25:52,030\nSo, you know, you get tied to something\nlike this and that's not your home page.\n\n526\n00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:56,800\nBut you go into your settings and\nyou find where it is your home page.\n\n527\n00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,970\nWhere somebody has set it, and\nyou change it, and what happens?\n\n528\n00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,220\nIt just goes back again.\n\n529\n00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:02,750\nRight, you know, you,\n\n530\n00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:06,740\nyou've have been kind of overruled by\nsomething running in the background.\n\n531\n00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:11,810\nWell now instead of fussing with it,\nI can just come in here.\n\n532\n00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:13,210\nWhoops, apparently I can't spell restore.\n\n533\n00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:15,360\nI can go to my System Restore.\n\n534\n00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,690\nSo I just brought up my Start menu and\ntyped in System Restore.\n\n535\n00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:20,448\nIt's a little faster than going\nthrough the system Control Panel.\n\n536\n00:26:20,448 --> 00:26:25,580\nAnd it's gonna launch that wizard and\nI can roll back, all right?\n\n537\n00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:31,250\nNow before I roll back, just to be on the\nsafe side I'm gonna go into my Documents\n\n538\n00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,410\nand I'm gonna create\na new document in here.\n\n539\n00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:41,620\nSo this will be After Restore Points,\nall right?\n\n540\n00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:46,240\nAnd if I go in here and\nI'll say I created this file after\n\n541\n00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,436\nthe restore point was taken.\n\n542\n00:26:50,436 --> 00:26:53,410\nAll right, so there it is.\n\n543\n00:26:53,410 --> 00:27:00,250\nI've created this file, and okay,\ndid I create more than one file?\n\n544\n00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,840\nWhat did I do?\n\n545\n00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,195\nOh great, now I have no idea what I did.\n\n546\n00:27:04,195 --> 00:27:06,660\n[LAUGH] Oh here,\nAfter Restore Point, there it is.\n\n547\n00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,830\nSee it.\nSo I created that one.\n\n548\n00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,860\nI've got it,\ncreated after the restore point.\n\n549\n00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,210\nNow I'm gonna go and hit Next.\n\n550\n00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:16,550\nAnd it shows me the restore\npoints that I've got.\n\n551\n00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,710\nHere's an automatic restore point.\n\n552\n00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,810\nI didn't make that one.\n\n553\n00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:24,070\nThis one was made by the operating\nsystem today at 2 p.m.\n\n554\n00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:27,460\nActually that's not even that long ago,\nthat's like 15 minutes ago.\n\n555\n00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,740\nI didn't make that one.\n\n556\n00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,320\nBut maybe I installed some software,\nor a Windows Update happened, or\n\n557\n00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,090\nthe computer was just bored sitting\nthere idle and said, you know what?\n\n558\n00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:36,400\nLet's make a restore point.\n\n559\n00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,650\nSo it made that, I didn't do it.\n\n560\n00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,380\nI've also got the Live on Air,\nthat's the one I made, it's manual.\n\n561\n00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:45,470\nAnd there's a manual one that I made\nat another point too, all right?\n\n562\n00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,930\nNow it looks like I just\nhave three restore points.\n\n563\n00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:49,640\nBut you will likely have more.\n\n564\n00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,710\nIt's showing you the most recent ones.\n\n565\n00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,240\nIf I hit Show More Restore Points,\nit may light up and\n\n566\n00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,610\nshow a lot more if you've had some\nthat were taken in the past, and\n\n567\n00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,680\nyou may need that if you have\nto go pack a way, a ways.\n\n568\n00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:07,140\nBut I'm gonna restore to this Live\non Air one, and I can choose that.\n\n569\n00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,440\nAnd it's got this scan for\n\n570\n00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,320\naffected programs that kinda lets\nyou get an idea for what has\n\n571\n00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,170\nchanged on your system to determine\nif that's the right one to roll back.\n\n572\n00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:19,090\nYou might need to go back a few\ndifferent ones before you\n\n573\n00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:21,400\nfind the program that you're\nactually trying to fix.\n\n574\n00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,630\nBut I'm just going to go back\nto this most recent one.\n\n575\n00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:28,150\nAnd I'll hit Next, and it's telling\nme that it's going to roll me back.\n\n576\n00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:31,586\nNow when I hit finish, it's gonna tell\nme well, probably need to restart, and\n\n577\n00:28:31,586 --> 00:28:33,200\nwe don't wanna interrupt this.\n\n578\n00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,750\nYou shouldn't use the computer\nwhile it's restoring.\n\n579\n00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:39,380\nSo we'll sit back and we'll let that run\nand it's going to restore my system.\n\n580\n00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:43,980\nNow while we wait on that, I wanna\nhighlight something important here.\n\n581\n00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:48,740\nThe restore points are super\nconvenient to roll back and\n\n582\n00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,970\nrecover data that might have been lost.\n\n583\n00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:53,365\nSo we don't need our backups anymore,\nright Ronnie?\n\n584\n00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:56,540\n>> No, we definitely still\nneed our backups because\n\n585\n00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,740\nonce again with the system restore point,\n\n586\n00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,610\neven though it doesn't actually affect\nany of the original systems overall,\n\n587\n00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:08,430\nwhat will still happen though is that\nyou can still have files get corrupted.\n\n588\n00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:13,252\nSo even with that, your backups are still\nthe safest bet to ensure you're not\n\n589\n00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,440\ngonna lose the original\ndata that you have.\n\n590\n00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,647\n>> Now remember that the way a restore\npoint works is it's just hiding the files\n\n591\n00:29:18,647 --> 00:29:19,510\nthat have changed.\n\n592\n00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,740\nThey're still on the same hard drive.\n\n593\n00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,460\nSo what happens if your hard drive fails?\n\n594\n00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,460\nCan you use that restore point?\n\n595\n00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,038\nNo!\n\n596\n00:29:26,038 --> 00:29:29,080\nIt's stored on the same drive\nas your operating system,\n\n597\n00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,740\nas your regular data,\nwhether it's hidden or not.\n\n598\n00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,800\nSo system restore points\nwill fix software errors.\n\n599\n00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,900\nHuman errors, oh,\nI accidentally deleted that file, crap.\n\n600\n00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,260\nOr, I got a virus.\n\n601\n00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:44,250\nOh man, I don't wanna go to Geek Squad and\npay $100 a minute to get them to fix it.\n\n602\n00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,230\nThat's what restore points fix.\n\n603\n00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:49,400\nBut if your hard drive fails,\nnot only do you lose your data,\n\n604\n00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,890\nyou lose your restore points, also.\n\n605\n00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,860\nAnd that is not gonna be a happy day for\nyou.\n\n606\n00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,420\nSo restore points are designed to be\neasier than backups when it comes to\n\n607\n00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,200\nrecovery, if you've got them.\n\n608\n00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,580\nBut it is not a replacement for backups.\n\n609\n00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,960\nYou're gonna use these in combination.\n\n610\n00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:09,160\nSo my system just rebooted and I can see\nmy system restore completed successfully.\n\n611\n00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:14,340\nThe system has been restored to\nhow it was at 2:16 pm today, and\n\n612\n00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,940\nyour documents have not been affected.\n\n613\n00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,660\nSo, what should I see?\n\n614\n00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,004\nWell hopefully my,\n\n615\n00:30:19,004 --> 00:30:23,597\n[CROSSTALK] my security essentials\nshould be turned back on, right?\n\n616\n00:30:23,597 --> 00:30:27,180\nAnd when I launch it, sure enough,\ngreen bar right there.\n\n617\n00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,570\nSo that's looking good.\n\n618\n00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:32,416\nMy Internet home page, right,\nhopefully it's not what did I put it to?\n\n619\n00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:33,032\nAsk.com or something?\n\n620\n00:30:33,032 --> 00:30:34,340\n>> Askjeeves.com or something.\n\n621\n00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,990\n>> So that should be back to Google.\n\n622\n00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,250\nAnd sure enough, it is, right?\n\n623\n00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:43,456\nSo my settings have been reverted, any\ndrivers I've updated have been reverted,\n\n624\n00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:46,477\nany Windows updates that have\napplied have been reverted.\n\n625\n00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:51,795\nBut If I go into my Documents\nlibrary after restore point,\n\n626\n00:30:51,795 --> 00:30:54,300\nthere's that file I made.\n\n627\n00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,900\nIt left my documents alone.\n\n628\n00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,930\nThat is a lot better\nthan restoring a backup.\n\n629\n00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:02,180\nWhen I restore a backup, if I have\na full back of my system, it's gonna\n\n630\n00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:06,280\nmove my whole machine back in time,\nincluding documents that I've edited.\n\n631\n00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:10,000\nThis is my first go to when\nsomebody comes to me now and\n\n632\n00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,800\nsays, I got a virus or\nI deleted some files or whatever.\n\n633\n00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,160\nI don't go to the backups\nlike I used to do.\n\n634\n00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,620\nI just jump straight in and\nsay, let's do a system restore.\n\n635\n00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,580\nHow long did that take?\n\n636\n00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,233\nNot even five minutes.\n\n637\n00:31:22,233 --> 00:31:23,939\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah,\nI didn't watch the clock so.\n\n638\n00:31:23,939 --> 00:31:26,730\nWant to go back and\nwatch the footage instant replay.\n\n639\n00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:30,580\nSo anyhow, it only took a few minutes,\nand roll this back.\n\n640\n00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:35,510\nIt will save you hours of trying to clean\nout viruses, malware, simple things like\n\n641\n00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:38,450\nthat where you don't have to go and\nget your backups and bring it back.\n\n642\n00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,179\nSo definitely a cool thing to have there.\n\n643\n00:31:42,252 --> 00:31:47,260\nAll right, so that's system restore, and\nwe talked a little bit about backups.\n\n644\n00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,683\nWhat else have we got?\n\n645\n00:31:48,683 --> 00:31:53,615\n>> What's ahead of us also is what we had\nmentioned a little bit earlier too is that\n\n646\n00:31:53,615 --> 00:31:57,742\nthere may be where our computers\nWhat if I can't get back into it?\n\n647\n00:31:57,742 --> 00:32:01,550\nWhat if I've made a change to the point\nwhere when I try and boot up,\n\n648\n00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:06,200\nit just sits there and it spins, and\nit doesn't ever let me get back in?\n\n649\n00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,745\nThere are different options that we\nactually should know how to be able\n\n650\n00:32:09,745 --> 00:32:10,360\nto get to.\n\n651\n00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,550\nSo we can take a look at that,\nthe different options that\n\n652\n00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:16,922\nmay allow me to get in, may allow to be\nable to do some other troubleshooting.\n\n653\n00:32:16,922 --> 00:32:17,910\n>> All right.\n\n654\n00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,980\nSo, let's say that our\nsystem won't boot up.\n\n655\n00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,990\nOr you know, you start to boot, you see\nthe Windows logo, and the machine reboots.\n\n656\n00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,250\nHow, how you restore a restore point?\n\n657\n00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,980\nHow do you get in and\ntry and fix the problem?.\n\n658\n00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,270\nThe system just keeps rebooting.\n\n659\n00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,030\nRight?\n\n660\n00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,840\nWell there's actually a little\nhidden menu in Windows 7.\n\n661\n00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,630\nWhen it boots up, there's a moment\n\n662\n00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:40,560\nwhere you can press your F8 key to\nbe able to access this hidden menu.\n\n663\n00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,335\nAll right?\n\n664\n00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:42,485\nLet's see if I can do it.\n\n665\n00:32:42,485 --> 00:32:44,710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now, on a physical machine it's not so\n\n666\n00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:47,875\nhard to hit, but\nI'm on a virtual machine and.\n\n667\n00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:49,125\n>> It is lightning fast.\n\n668\n00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:50,775\n>> This is one of the times\n[LAUGH] when you're penalized for\n\n669\n00:32:50,775 --> 00:32:53,925\nhaving a fast machine, so,\nlet's see if I can hit it.\n\n670\n00:32:53,925 --> 00:32:56,935\nWhen I restart, what's gonna happen\nis you get your bios screen.\n\n671\n00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:57,695\nRight?\nYour, your,\n\n672\n00:32:57,695 --> 00:33:00,325\nyour physical hardware\nshows a little bios screen.\n\n673\n00:33:00,325 --> 00:33:04,475\nAnd then after that it flips and you\nsee the Windows logo on a black screen,\n\n674\n00:33:04,475 --> 00:33:06,045\nas your system is booting up.\n\n675\n00:33:06,045 --> 00:33:09,885\nWell, in between those two,\nin between the bios screen and\n\n676\n00:33:09,885 --> 00:33:13,618\nthe widows logo it's a very,\nvery small window of time.\n\n677\n00:33:13,618 --> 00:33:18,860\nIt's about two seconds where you can\nhit the F8 key on your keyboard and\n\n678\n00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,800\npull up this special menu.\n\n679\n00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,570\nIf your system ever crashes,\nwhen you reboot,\n\n680\n00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,940\nit will normally bring\nthe menu up automatically.\n\n681\n00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,510\nBut for me, I haven't crashed my system,\nso I've got to try and\n\n682\n00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,030\ndo this the manual way.\n\n683\n00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,510\nSo I'm gonna hit restart here.\n\n684\n00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:34,534\nAnd, and, we're gonna,\nwe're gonna see if I can hit it in.\n\n685\n00:33:34,534 --> 00:33:35,610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And what I,\n\n686\n00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:41,150\nwhat I normally do is I just start,\nlike, rapidly hitting that F8 key.\n\n687\n00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:42,630\n>> There you go.\n\n688\n00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:43,560\n>> Oh, you're good.\n>> I got it.\n\n689\n00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,195\nThere we go.\n\n690\n00:33:44,195 --> 00:33:45,120\n>> Yeah.\n\n691\n00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,520\n>> I just rebooted as soon as I see the\nBios key, I just start tapping F8 over and\n\n692\n00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,200\nover and over again.\n\n693\n00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,940\nI do that on a physical machine too,\nnot just on a virtual.\n\n694\n00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,840\nBut, this is the menu that, that Ronnie\nand I were talking about, right here.\n\n695\n00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,360\n>> Yeah.\n\n696\n00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,050\nOn the physical machine when this happens,\nyou do get a little bit of time.\n\n697\n00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:03,210\nYou see when the computer reboots, shuts\ndown, and then it gives you that nice\n\n698\n00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:06,660\nlittle Bios screen where it tells\nyou you can enter and setup.\n\n699\n00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,440\nUsually, right immediately after that or\nright during that time,\n\n700\n00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,880\nthat's when I start tapping on\nthe F8 when it turns black.\n\n701\n00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,610\nYou need to do it before\nthat Windows logo pops up.\n\n702\n00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:18,560\nYou do it when, when Windows logo pops\nup it's just gonna kick you back in that\n\n703\n00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,430\nreboot loop.\n\n704\n00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,030\n>> Yeah.\n>> So this is the way to go.\n\n705\n00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:25,068\n>> And fortunately, since your computer's\nrebooting anyway, you get a second chance.\n\n706\n00:34:25,068 --> 00:34:26,520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It may take a few tries.\n\n707\n00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,180\n>> Yeah.\n\n708\n00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,860\n>> All right.\nNow, once we're into this menu,\n\n709\n00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,850\nwe've got a few choices.\n\n710\n00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:32,010\nAnd the first one is repair your computer.\n\n711\n00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:34,530\nWell, the Windows 7\ninstallation actually has a few\n\n712\n00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,140\ntricks that it can use to try and\nfix things.\n\n713\n00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:40,990\nIt will try and fix basic boot problems,\nit will try and, well, it will look and\n\n714\n00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:41,901\nsee if there's restore points.\n\n715\n00:34:41,901 --> 00:34:43,200\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And give you the opportunity to run\n\n716\n00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,010\na restore point, and it will give you\nthe opportunity to restore from a backup.\n\n717\n00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:48,250\nSo you've got a few things.\n\n718\n00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:52,270\nNow, not everybody installs\nthe recovery console on their system.\n\n719\n00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,420\nSo, when you buy a computer from HP or\nDell or\n\n720\n00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:57,570\nwhatever, you might not\nactually get that first option.\n\n721\n00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:58,480\nMost of the time you will, but\n\n722\n00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:04,130\nif you don't, you might need to boot off\nof a Windows 7 DVD in order to see it.\n\n723\n00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,500\nThe, the recovery stuff\nis always on the DVD.\n\n724\n00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,665\nYou can always use that to boot on, but\n\n725\n00:35:08,665 --> 00:35:10,920\nwhether it's installed in your\nhard drive is a different story.\n\n726\n00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,160\n>> That's a great point to make, Don.\n\n727\n00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,180\nWhen you have the, the DVD itself to,\nto install the windows system.\n\n728\n00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,840\nLittle bit confusing because it\nbrings you up the install and\n\n729\n00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:22,445\nit looks like you're actually going\nto install on the computer itself.\n\n730\n00:35:22,445 --> 00:35:23,370\nAnd you can say,\n\n731\n00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:27,570\nwell I don't know if I really want\nto reinstall the operating system.\n\n732\n00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:30,661\nWhat you'll have to is you'll [SOUND]\nyou'll have to press that, that,\n\n733\n00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:32,801\nthat first button that\nreally says Install.\n\n734\n00:35:32,801 --> 00:35:34,673\nAnd then in the lower left hand corner,\n\n735\n00:35:34,673 --> 00:35:38,310\nyou'll see a little tiny link that\nwill say Repair Your Computer.\n\n736\n00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,990\nAnd that's the link that we're looking for\n\n737\n00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:42,480\nthat will take us in the same\nmenu that we'd see right here.\n\n738\n00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,670\n>> Yeah.\nAnd you know, we,\n\n739\n00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,630\nwe actually go through that\nprocess in a few other shows.\n\n740\n00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,420\nI, I think we do it in A Plus, don't we?\n\n741\n00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,470\n>> We do it in A plus.\n\n742\n00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,661\n>> I know we do it in the Windows 7 show.\n\n743\n00:35:49,661 --> 00:35:50,680\n>> We do it in Windows 7.\n\n744\n00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,610\n>> So, there's, there's a few of\nour other shows on ITProTV that\n\n745\n00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:55,050\nyou guys can check out where we go\nthrough that whole restore process.\n\n746\n00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:58,610\nBut for the MTA that I want you\nto be familiar with Safe Mode.\n\n747\n00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,910\nSafe Mode is right here\nfrom this same menu.\n\n748\n00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:01,930\nYou'll see it right down here.\n\n749\n00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:04,390\nI've got a few different\nsafe modes I can pick from.\n\n750\n00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:09,605\nWhen your computer is rebooting,\nit's almost always, well, not always but\n\n751\n00:36:09,605 --> 00:36:15,680\nin most of the time it's time to some kind\nof software or driver you've installed.\n\n752\n00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,870\nIf you've installed\na bad video card driver,\n\n753\n00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:21,530\nbad sound card driver or even installed\nsome software program that's just\n\n754\n00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:24,530\ncausing a blue screen\ncrash on your computer.\n\n755\n00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:28,720\nAll you need is the chance to boot\nthe system up and remove that software.\n\n756\n00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,870\nThat's all you need and\nthen you can fix your problem.\n\n757\n00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:34,290\nWell what safe mode does is it\nsays let's boot Windows and\n\n758\n00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:38,190\nnot launch any non Microsoft software.\n\n759\n00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,410\nWe're not going to load\nany non Microsoft drivers.\n\n760\n00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:44,020\nWe're not going to load any non\noperating system based software.\n\n761\n00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,230\nAll of your third party\nstuff is disabled and\n\n762\n00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:49,960\nyou boot up in a very very\nbasic version of Windows 7.\n\n763\n00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,780\nIn fact, in the normal safe mode it\ndoesn't even load network hard drivers.\n\n764\n00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,150\nSo your system boots up with\nno internet connectivity.\n\n765\n00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:02,530\nIf you need internet access you'll\nneed to do safe mode with networking.\n\n766\n00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,808\nAnd then there's Safe Mode\nwith Command Prompt.\n\n767\n00:37:04,808 --> 00:37:06,800\nYeah, yeah,\nI've never really understood this one.\n\n768\n00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,780\nIt, it, it boots into safe mode and\nthen gives you a command prompt.\n\n769\n00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:12,850\nNow you can boot into regular safe\nmode and launch a command prompt too.\n\n770\n00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,610\nSo there's not really much\ndifference here except for\n\n771\n00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,910\nthe fact that it does actually\nlaunch the prompt for you.\n\n772\n00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:18,730\nSo it saves you a click or two.\n\n773\n00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:21,140\nBut, I'm gonna go into regular safe mode.\n\n774\n00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,740\nThere is one other one\nthat you'll see in here.\n\n775\n00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,670\nEnable low resolution video 640 x 480.\n\n776\n00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:30,180\nIf you have a bad video card\nthat's causing the problem.\n\n777\n00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,570\nYou can run into this one and\n\n778\n00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:35,300\nit will boot without loading the advanced\nvideo card drivers, which go\n\n779\n00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:39,590\nreally basic to get you into the system,\nand you can fix your video there too.\n\n780\n00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:44,160\nThe only other one to worry about is\nthis guy right here, Last Known Good.\n\n781\n00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:49,330\n>> Last Known Good configuration\nis really a, a neat kind of next\n\n782\n00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:54,060\nto final option that, that we have if we\nreally can't get into our computer system.\n\n783\n00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:57,110\nEvery time you log into\nthe computer system it says hey,\n\n784\n00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,790\neverything is good up to into this point.\n\n785\n00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:03,990\nThen when you reboot again and\nyou log in again it overwrites that\n\n786\n00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:07,110\nprevious configuration that\nsaid everything is good.\n\n787\n00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:11,090\nSo when you use this, it could be that\nyou can't get into your computer system.\n\n788\n00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:13,220\nYou're trying to log in and\nnothing is happening.\n\n789\n00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:17,260\nYou can always get to this menu and\nthen try and use this option.\n\n790\n00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:20,000\nUse other recommendation as try\nall the other options first\n\n791\n00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,115\nbefore you do this one.\n\n792\n00:38:21,115 --> 00:38:21,720\n>> Yeah.\n\n793\n00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,871\nThis one it comes down to the point of,\nof, of where your system reboots.\n\n794\n00:38:24,871 --> 00:38:25,960\nAll right?\n\n795\n00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,028\nWhen you boot up the system.\n\n796\n00:38:27,028 --> 00:38:28,680\nRonnie you mentioned it gets to a point.\n\n797\n00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,990\nThat point is the log on screen.\n\n798\n00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:34,320\nWhen you get to the log on screen,\nand you pick your user account and\n\n799\n00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,320\nyou type in your password and\nyou successfully log on.\n\n800\n00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,100\nRight?\n\n801\n00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,150\nIf you pass that?\n\n802\n00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,890\nThen this last known good,\nis not going to do you any good.\n\n803\n00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:46,270\nBecause, right there, when you log in\nsuccessfully, it says; hey, right now,\n\n804\n00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:49,870\nWindows is in tact enough,\nto allow you to log in.\n\n805\n00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,600\nAnd it takes a snapshot of the Windows\nregistry right at that point.\n\n806\n00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,720\nAll right?\n\n807\n00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,200\nSo if your computer is\nstuck in a boot loop, and\n\n808\n00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,840\nit's happening before the log on screen,\nyou can choose last known good, and\n\n809\n00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,690\nit'll roll your registry\nback to the point where\n\n810\n00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:08,350\nthe last time you were able to actually\nget to the log on screen and login.\n\n811\n00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:11,200\nThat's what it'll return you to,\nand now you're in business.\n\n812\n00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,430\nBut if your crash is happening\nafter the log on screen,\n\n813\n00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,840\nthen this isn't gonna help one bit.\n\n814\n00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,620\nRight.\nIt's not gonna roll you back there.\n\n815\n00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,230\nBecause the last known good\nactually contains your\n\n816\n00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:23,182\nproblem at that point since\nit's past the login screen.\n\n817\n00:39:23,182 --> 00:39:25,190\nAll right.\nBut let's just go into regular old safe\n\n818\n00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,320\nmode, and we'll boot it up.\n\n819\n00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,670\nSafe mode does output\na ton of information.\n\n820\n00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:31,330\nThese are the drivers that it is loading.\n\n821\n00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:34,490\nIt's not loading third-party drivers,\njust the ones that Microsoft includes with\n\n822\n00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:39,900\nWindows, and even then a smaller set of\nthose drivers than it normally would.\n\n823\n00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:44,432\nAnd if it freezes during that list you can\nsee the last driver it was able to load\n\n824\n00:39:44,432 --> 00:39:46,757\nand start to troubleshoot from there.\n\n825\n00:39:46,757 --> 00:39:48,254\nBut, if it gets past the login and\n\n826\n00:39:48,254 --> 00:39:51,852\nyou'll all ready notice there's some\nthings that are different on my screen.\n\n827\n00:39:51,852 --> 00:39:53,920\nMy colors don't look as vibrant.\n\n828\n00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,497\nAnd that's because the video\ndriver is not the nice one.\n\n829\n00:39:56,497 --> 00:39:57,681\nIt's kind of a crummier one.\n\n830\n00:39:57,681 --> 00:40:02,297\nAnd see how my widescreen is gone,\nI've got these big black bars on the side.\n\n831\n00:40:02,297 --> 00:40:07,680\nSo, the whole theater-wide, or 16 by 9\nresolution, that's been stripped out, too.\n\n832\n00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,700\nThe basic video card driver\ndoesn't support those resolutions.\n\n833\n00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,930\nAnd when I get logged in, I'll notice\nthat I'm in a real low resolution screen,\n\n834\n00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:21,230\nmy wallpaper is disabled, and it, and it\ntakes me into the help screen right off.\n\n835\n00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:25,530\nBut you can see Safe Mode written\nin all four corners of the system.\n\n836\n00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:26,810\nWell, except the corner my head is on.\n\n837\n00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:29,170\nBut but you can see that\nlittle Safe Mode note there.\n\n838\n00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:31,390\nWe know we're in Safe Mode, right?\n\n839\n00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:34,750\nAnd from here you're not expected to work.\n\n840\n00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:37,260\nYou're expected to fix your problem.\n\n841\n00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,890\nIf it was a bad driver that you installed,\nwell,\n\n842\n00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:42,910\nyou can go into your Device Manager and\nremove it.\n\n843\n00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:45,870\nSo maybe it was a bad video card driver,\nright?\n\n844\n00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:50,860\nI can go into my computer management tool,\ngo into the Device Manager,\n\n845\n00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:55,490\nI could find my display adapter, and\nthere's the driver for my display adapter.\n\n846\n00:40:55,490 --> 00:41:00,650\nAnd I can come back and I can\nuninstall it, or if it was an upgrade,\n\n847\n00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:05,900\nI can go to Properties, and under Driver,\nyou'll have this Rollback Driver option.\n\n848\n00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,650\nI can roll it back to the previous\nversion that wasn't crashing.\n\n849\n00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:11,440\nSo you can kind of pick and choose,\nand do a little maintenance there.\n\n850\n00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,740\nYou can uninstall third-party software.\n\n851\n00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:16,750\nIf something was installed that's causing\nthe problem, you can get it removed.\n\n852\n00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:20,180\nYou can do just enough to get\nyour system healthy again.\n\n853\n00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:23,941\nAnd you can even launch\nSystem Restore points, and\n\n854\n00:41:23,941 --> 00:41:27,456\nyou can recover your\nsystem to a restore point.\n\n855\n00:41:27,456 --> 00:41:30,232\nAnd here I can even undo\nthe System Restore that we did earlier, or\n\n856\n00:41:30,232 --> 00:41:32,520\nwe can choose a different one and\nget restored there.\n\n857\n00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,640\nSo, lots of options inside a save point.\n\n858\n00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,590\nOnce you're done, you just reboot, right?\n\n859\n00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:40,650\nSo I can go back here and\nI can go and tell it to restart.\n\n860\n00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:44,920\nAnd it's gonna restart, and, as long\nas I don't press F8 while it boots,\n\n861\n00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,050\nthen it'll just boot up in a regular mode.\n\n862\n00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:50,430\nWindow's will be back like normal,\nand we're ready to rock.\n\n863\n00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,310\nSo, that's kind of the, the restore mode.\n\n864\n00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:55,085\nPretty cool stuff right in there.\n\n865\n00:41:55,085 --> 00:41:55,619\nAll right.\n\n866\n00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:58,370\nWell, we'll let this one boot up, and\nwe'll make sure that it's healthy.\n\n867\n00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:00,065\nBut after that,\nwe'll stop and take a break.\n\n868\n00:42:00,065 --> 00:42:02,495\nWe've got some other tools that\nwe need to talk about,and so\n\n869\n00:42:02,495 --> 00:42:04,915\nwe'll get a chance to see\nthose as we move forward.\n\n870\n00:42:04,915 --> 00:42:06,925\nI know that we still have other.\n\n871\n00:42:06,925 --> 00:42:07,595\n>> Defragmenting?\n\n872\n00:42:07,595 --> 00:42:08,615\n>> Yep.\nMaintenance tools.\n\n873\n00:42:08,615 --> 00:42:10,355\nBasic drive maintenance that we'll see.\n\n874\n00:42:10,355 --> 00:42:15,155\nApparently, I can't remember my password,\nand then we'll talk about system updates.\n\n875\n00:42:15,155 --> 00:42:17,065\nThat's another good one\nthat we need to tackle.\n\n876\n00:42:17,065 --> 00:42:18,170\nSo, yep.\n\n877\n00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:18,970\nLooks like we're healthy.\n\n878\n00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:19,490\nWe're back up.\n\n879\n00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:20,450\n>> Looks great.\n\n880\n00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:21,100\n>> And we're in business.\n\n881\n00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,460\n>> So, all right, ladies and gentlemen,\nlet's stop and take a break here.\n\n882\n00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,220\nStay tuned, though.\n\n883\n00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,157\nWe'll be back with more in just a moment.\n\n884\n00:42:27,157 --> 00:42:31,615\n[MUSIC]\n\n885\n00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:34,552\nAll right.\n\n886\n00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,000\nWelcome back, everybody.\n\n887\n00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,360\nSo, in our first segment,\nwe talked about some backup and\n\n888\n00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,080\nrestore technologies that were available.\n\n889\n00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,380\nAnd that, that's cool.\n\n890\n00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:46,320\nBut it's kinda nice if we can kinda\nprevent problems before they occur, and\n\n891\n00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,780\nWindows does contain a number\nof utilities available for\n\n892\n00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:53,031\nus to use to keep our system running\nsmooth, even when there's not an issue.\n\n893\n00:42:53,031 --> 00:42:57,115\nBut are more like preventive maintenance\nthat we can take, and so, for\n\n894\n00:42:57,115 --> 00:43:00,605\nthis objective, Microsoft actually gives\nus a laundry list of utilities to discuss,\n\n895\n00:43:00,605 --> 00:43:03,215\nand we'll get to see them and\nwhat they do.\n\n896\n00:43:03,215 --> 00:43:06,075\nThe very first one is\nthe Disk Defragmenter.\n\n897\n00:43:07,265 --> 00:43:10,355\n>> The Disk Defragmenter is kind of\nthe neatest tool that I remember\n\n898\n00:43:10,355 --> 00:43:13,710\nfrom my earliest computing\ndays in Windows 95.\n\n899\n00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:18,747\nAnd so I said, oh, you've never run\nthe Disk Defragmenter, and it would pop\n\n900\n00:43:18,747 --> 00:43:23,800\nup this little grid of a window and\nshow the actual computer doing something.\n\n901\n00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,860\nThat's kind of the first neat\nexperience that I had in watching the,\n\n902\n00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:30,110\nthe actual computer move files around.\n\n903\n00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:34,080\nAnd what the Disk Defragmenter is really\ntrying to do is to try to get all those\n\n904\n00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,340\nfiles in the location that they're, that\nthey might be spread out across the hard\n\n905\n00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:42,740\ndrive, to move them all into one\ncontiguous linked file altogether.\n\n906\n00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:45,820\nAnd that way, it makes it easier for the\noperating system to be able to search for\n\n907\n00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:49,920\nit, find it, and bring it up to serve me,\nand it moves all of\n\n908\n00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,630\nthe available free space, essentially,\nto one area of the hard drive, too.\n\n909\n00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:58,710\n>> Yeah, you know, defragmentation\nis something that some systems,\n\n910\n00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:00,380\nit's not that pressing of a thing.\n\n911\n00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:03,010\nWindows kind of defragments\nitself all the time.\n\n912\n00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:07,680\nBut if you're doing a lot of deletions and\ncopying in new files and\n\n913\n00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,440\nstuff, you can end up with\na fragmented drive pretty quick.\n\n914\n00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,280\nWhat happens is when your system goes\nto write a file to the hard drive.\n\n915\n00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,750\nLet's say the file's\nthree megabytes in size.\n\n916\n00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:19,240\nThere might not be a spot\non the hard drive that has\n\n917\n00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,100\nthree empty megabytes all in a row.\n\n918\n00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,410\nSo instead, what it has to do is take\nyour file and break it up into pieces,\n\n919\n00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:28,120\nand place those pieces all over the drive.\n\n920\n00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,500\nWell, then when you go to read the files,\n\n921\n00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,310\nyou've gotta jump all over\nthe place to find it.\n\n922\n00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:35,358\nIf the file was all in a row,\nright, all in one nice place,\n\n923\n00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:37,535\nthen when it went to read your hard drive,\n\n924\n00:44:37,535 --> 00:44:41,476\nit could just read the beginning of the\nfile and then [SOUND] right to the end.\n\n925\n00:44:41,476 --> 00:44:43,380\nAnd you get great performance out of it.\n\n926\n00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:46,135\nSo a heavily fragmented\ndrive is a bad thing, but\n\n927\n00:44:46,135 --> 00:44:50,045\nit happens over time because you're\nadding files, deleting files, and\n\n928\n00:44:50,045 --> 00:44:53,605\nthere's not always the amount of space\nthat we want available at any given time.\n\n929\n00:44:53,605 --> 00:44:57,825\nSo, we need to run\nthe defragmenter to correct that.\n\n930\n00:44:57,825 --> 00:45:01,025\nHow often you run the defragmenter\nis kind of up to you, and\n\n931\n00:45:01,025 --> 00:45:04,585\nI'll be honest with you guys,\nI typically don't run it at all, but\n\n932\n00:45:04,585 --> 00:45:07,240\nit is there because, you know,\nsome people need it.\n\n933\n00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:11,050\nI don't typically add and\ndelete tons of files in frequencies that,\n\n934\n00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:12,290\nthat makes it matter.\n\n935\n00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:18,070\nIf your system is using NTFS, the NT file\nsystem, it actually defragments itself.\n\n936\n00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:21,370\nEvery time you touch a file,\nit defragments that file.\n\n937\n00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:23,920\nAnd so it's an ongoing\noperation inside of there and\n\n938\n00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:29,110\nthat's good enough for me, but, even for\nsomebody like me who doesn't do it,\n\n939\n00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:32,940\nWindows actually has a schedule in\nplace where it's defragmenting.\n\n940\n00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,260\nI believe,\nit's once a week isn't it, Ronnie?\n\n941\n00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,790\n>> I think it's actually daily.\n\n942\n00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:36,800\n>> Daily?\nAll right, so\n\n943\n00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,690\nit is defragmenting on its own.\n\n944\n00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:40,810\nSo again, not something most\nof us have to worry about,\n\n945\n00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:43,540\nbut let's take a look at\nit cuz it is kind of cool.\n\n946\n00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:48,300\nI'm gonna go under my Start menu,\nand under All Programs,\n\n947\n00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:52,240\nAccessories, and System Tools.\n\n948\n00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,740\nThat was All Programs, Accessories, and\n\n949\n00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:59,530\nthen System Tools, you can find\nthe Disk Defragmenter right there.\n\n950\n00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:00,130\nAll right?\n\n951\n00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:03,980\nAnd what it'll do is it'll offer\nto analyze your disk to look and\n\n952\n00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:05,190\nsee if it's fragmented.\n\n953\n00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:05,700\n>> Oh, I was wrong.\n\n954\n00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:09,350\n>> If, if, if it is fragmented,\nthen it will go ahead and clear it and.\n\n955\n00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:10,122\n>> I was wrong, yep.\n\n956\n00:46:10,122 --> 00:46:12,300\n[LAUGH]\n>> Set to run at one AM every Wednesday.\n\n957\n00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:12,960\n>> Yeah, weekly.\n\n958\n00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,770\n>> So it is once a week, so.\n\n959\n00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:17,310\nI, you know,\nI take no joy in being right, Ronnie.\n\n960\n00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:17,910\n>> Sure, yeah.\n\n961\n00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:18,460\n>> But I do take joy in.\n\n962\n00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:19,070\n>> You are enjoying.\n\n963\n00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:20,180\n>> You being wrong.\n>> That's right.\n\n964\n00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,770\nI agree.\n[LAUGH]\n\n965\n00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:22,630\n>> All right.\n\n966\n00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:25,982\nSo, so so it's running once a week, and\nthat, that's probably good enough for\n\n967\n00:46:25,982 --> 00:46:26,550\nmost people.\n\n968\n00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,290\nBut if your system's\nrunning kind of sluggish,\n\n969\n00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:30,630\nyou might wanna go ahead and check it out.\n\n970\n00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:33,940\nNow Microsoft knows that you\ndon't normally need to do this.\n\n971\n00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:38,630\nSo the Analyze button gives you a chance\nto find out whether it's really necessary.\n\n972\n00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:42,580\nI can choose my C drive, and\nI can hit Analyze Disk, and\n\n973\n00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:48,085\nit's gonna check it out and see whether or\nnot I actually, we need to defragment.\n\n974\n00:46:48,085 --> 00:46:50,955\nSo it's just gonna examine it and\nit will let me know.\n\n975\n00:46:50,955 --> 00:46:52,725\nIf you have a SSD,\n\n976\n00:46:52,725 --> 00:46:57,085\na solid state digital drive, then you\nprobably won't need to defragment.\n\n977\n00:46:57,085 --> 00:46:59,275\nThose things are really good about\njumping all over the drive and\n\n978\n00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:00,620\ngetting the data that you need.\n\n979\n00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:04,010\nBut if you have a traditional magnetic\ndisk, which is your normal, old hard\n\n980\n00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:07,895\ndrive, and you've been running for months\non end, you may be pretty fragmented.\n\n981\n00:47:07,895 --> 00:47:12,300\nMine, I can see is only\nsix percent fragmented.\n\n982\n00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:16,800\nThat's not very much, so I probably\ndon't need to do a defragmentation.\n\n983\n00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,240\nBut if I want to, I can go ahead and\nhit Defragment Disk, and it's gonna run.\n\n984\n00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,160\nNow, Ronnie, you described how you\nactually got to see this operation happen,\n\n985\n00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:24,940\nand it was really cool.\n\n986\n00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:27,440\nWell, they don't really do that anymore.\n\n987\n00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,610\nYeah.\nNow we just get these,\n\n988\n00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:30,260\nthese little percentage things.\n\n989\n00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,390\nSo it's running.\n\n990\n00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:31,990\nIt's doing its thing.\n\n991\n00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:35,170\nThey used to actually show the little\nblocks of data on the hard drive and\n\n992\n00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:35,990\nwhere they were moving.\n\n993\n00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:39,660\nIt was really cool, but, as drives got\nbigger and bigger and bigger, it became\n\n994\n00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:43,480\nmore difficult to render that, and so\nnow they don't even do that anymore.\n\n995\n00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,170\nBut it's running.\n\n996\n00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:47,297\nIt's gonna defragment my disk in\nthe background, and it could take,\n\n997\n00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:48,570\nit could take 30 minutes.\n\n998\n00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:49,711\nIt could take three hours.\n\n999\n00:47:49,711 --> 00:47:54,175\nIt can take awhile to defragment a disk,\nespecially if it's been a long time, but\n\n1000\n00:47:54,175 --> 00:47:56,054\nit's rearranging those files And\n\n1001\n00:47:56,054 --> 00:47:59,824\nyou will find that your disk access\nis usually improved afterwards.\n\n1002\n00:47:59,824 --> 00:48:00,530\n>> Yeah.\n\n1003\n00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:03,402\nThis is, like I said,\nthe neatest tool in the beginning, but\n\n1004\n00:48:03,402 --> 00:48:06,715\none of the things I noticed then is that,\nif you went to move your mouse or\n\n1005\n00:48:06,715 --> 00:48:08,833\nsomething, you had to\nstart all over again.\n\n1006\n00:48:08,833 --> 00:48:10,981\nToday it does it a little bit differently,\nbut\n\n1007\n00:48:10,981 --> 00:48:14,889\nit's still doing the same overall basic\nfunction to try and rearrange those files,\n\n1008\n00:48:14,889 --> 00:48:18,800\nand usually that performance benefit\nis what we will experience the best.\n\n1009\n00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,485\nSo the nice thing is,\nsince it does it on a weekly schedule,\n\n1010\n00:48:21,485 --> 00:48:23,840\nwe really don't have to worry\nabout setting it up to much, but\n\n1011\n00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,995\nyou can run it manually if you choose to,\njust like we did.\n\n1012\n00:48:25,995 --> 00:48:27,890\n>> Yeah.\n\n1013\n00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:31,450\nNow, another thing is,\nas we use a computer,\n\n1014\n00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:36,070\nwe start to generate a lot of junk\nfiles on our computer, extra stuff.\n\n1015\n00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:39,480\nYou download software, you install it, and\nthen the installers are still left behind,\n\n1016\n00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,340\nor you uninstall software and\nit leaves things behind.\n\n1017\n00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:43,930\nYou have temporary Internet files.\n\n1018\n00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:47,640\nYou can have a lot of garbage built up on\nyour computer, especially over the years.\n\n1019\n00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:51,160\nSo, we have another neat utility\ncalled the Disk Cleanup Wizard.\n\n1020\n00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:57,040\nIf I go back to my Start Menu, and\nin All Programs and Accessories,\n\n1021\n00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:02,440\nand then System Tools, we'll find\nthe Disk Cleanup Wizard right there.\n\n1022\n00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,690\nAnd I can run the Disk Cleanup Wizard.\n\n1023\n00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,800\nIt's going to ask which disk to analyze.\n\n1024\n00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,562\nNow my system's gonna run a bit slower\nright now because I'm defragmenting in\n\n1025\n00:49:09,562 --> 00:49:10,420\nthe background.\n\n1026\n00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,622\nBut I, I guess I could go and\nstop that here.\n\n1027\n00:49:12,622 --> 00:49:14,600\nI'll just stop that operation.\n\n1028\n00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,660\nAnd there we go.\n\n1029\n00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,850\nSo so that way I won't be so slow.\n\n1030\n00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:20,130\nAnd now I'm gonna go ahead and\nscan my C drive.\n\n1031\n00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:23,520\nAnd now it's doing the disk cleanup for\nthe C drive.\n\n1032\n00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:28,020\nIt's looking for junk files, files that\naren't necessary that the operating system\n\n1033\n00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:31,350\ncreates and other software creates,\nand it's removing them.\n\n1034\n00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:33,820\nSo this can speed things up.\n\n1035\n00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:35,350\nNormally, it doesn't make things faster.\n\n1036\n00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:37,660\nIt just recovers hard drive space.\n\n1037\n00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:40,110\nSo here it's showing things\nthat it can wipe out.\n\n1038\n00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:44,350\nDownloaded program files that I don't\nneed anymore, temporary Internet files,\n\n1039\n00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:49,100\noffline web pages, it can empty\nmy recycle bin, my setup logs.\n\n1040\n00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:52,140\nSo, there's a few different\nthings in here that we could get.\n\n1041\n00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:54,010\nYou know, if I go through and\ncheck all these off,\n\n1042\n00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:57,420\nI'll see that I'm not actually\nrecovering much space on this one.\n\n1043\n00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:01,480\nBut, this is a fairly new system with\nno extra software installed, right?\n\n1044\n00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,790\nIf you've been running your computer for\n\n1045\n00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:07,790\nan entire year, you might recover\nseveral gigs of space, maybe even more.\n\n1046\n00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:11,520\n>> The nice thing with using the Disk\nCleanup is you don't have to guess\n\n1047\n00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,380\nwhether or not that,\n\n1048\n00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:17,020\nthat bigger file that you're trying to\ndelete is gonna be important or not.\n\n1049\n00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:20,800\nThe disk clean up automatically goes and\nonly really looks for those,\n\n1050\n00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,940\nwhat they call, unnecessary files or junk\nfiles like, like we've called it here.\n\n1051\n00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:26,530\nSo that way you're not going,\nwell, is this the file?\n\n1052\n00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:27,460\nShould I leave it alone?\n\n1053\n00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:29,130\nShould I, should I keep it?\n\n1054\n00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:32,788\nDisk Cleanup really just targets those\nfiles that we know that really deleting is\n\n1055\n00:50:32,788 --> 00:50:36,601\nnot gonna harm the computer at all, and\na lot of times if you are moving, you're\n\n1056\n00:50:36,601 --> 00:50:41,110\ninstalling, you're uninstalling, you're\ngonna end up creating more of these files.\n\n1057\n00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:44,020\nSo, it is nice to be able to go through\nand see how much you can reclaim.\n\n1058\n00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:46,660\n>> All right.\n\n1059\n00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:50,980\nSome of the other options that we have\nin addition to that we've got our\n\n1060\n00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,290\ntask scheduler.\n\n1061\n00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:55,020\nNow, I know we've seen\na few things at this point.\n\n1062\n00:50:55,020 --> 00:51:00,270\nWindows backups and the Disk Defragmenter\nthat we can schedule a backup.\n\n1063\n00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:03,610\nHow does the computer know to run\ncertain tasks at certain times?\n\n1064\n00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:07,550\nWell, that's where the task scheduler\ncomes in, and it handles automated and\n\n1065\n00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:11,610\nscheduled routines, and you can make it\ndo whatever you want, but, at a minimum,\n\n1066\n00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,420\nit's gonna do our basic maintenance tasks.\n\n1067\n00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:15,340\n>> With the Task Scheduler,\n\n1068\n00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:18,960\nit's very nice because there are some\ntimes where you want to make sure,\n\n1069\n00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,780\nlet's say, that you want your computer to\nreboot after a certain period of time.\n\n1070\n00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:25,310\nMaybe it's every night or\nmaybe it's just at least once a week, so\n\n1071\n00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:27,350\nthat way it starts up nice and fresh.\n\n1072\n00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:30,960\nWe do that here with a couple of systems\nin our building just so that we know that\n\n1073\n00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,522\nat the beginning of the day, everybody's\nalready been kind of kicked off of it.\n\n1074\n00:51:34,522 --> 00:51:38,410\nThey've, they've logged on, and\nthat way the computers start nice and\n\n1075\n00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:38,940\nfresh every day.\n\n1076\n00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:40,924\nSo it's kind of a neat thing that we do.\n\n1077\n00:51:40,924 --> 00:51:42,025\n>> Something interesting here,\nhappened here Ronnie.\n\n1078\n00:51:42,025 --> 00:51:43,452\nMy disc cleanup is finished.\n\n1079\n00:51:43,452 --> 00:51:43,956\n>> Huh.\n\n1080\n00:51:43,956 --> 00:51:45,880\n>> And now, that it's done,\nit's telling me,\n\n1081\n00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:49,790\nif I run it again, I could gain even\nmore space than I did the first time.\n\n1082\n00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:51,040\nThat's bizarre.\n\n1083\n00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,190\n>> Yeah, that is bizarre.\n\n1084\n00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:55,340\n>> All right, well, I'm not gonna do that,\nbut let me get into my Task Scheduler.\n\n1085\n00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:58,350\nAnd what I'm gonna do, Task Scheduler is,\nby the way, in your Control Panel.\n\n1086\n00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:01,294\nBut it's a heck of a lot faster to just\nbring up your Start Menu and type task,\n\n1087\n00:52:01,294 --> 00:52:02,660\nand it would be that first thing.\n\n1088\n00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:03,810\nTask Scheduler.\n\n1089\n00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:05,880\nSo I'm gonna go in there and\njust check it out.\n\n1090\n00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,690\nAnd the Task Scheduler, it's a pretty\ndaunting screen at first, but\n\n1091\n00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:10,780\nit's really not that bad.\n\n1092\n00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:15,160\nIf we browse into the Task Scheduler and\nclick on this Task Scheduler Library,\n\n1093\n00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,350\nyou'll see some of\nthe automated tasks you have.\n\n1094\n00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:21,460\nBut I said a minute ago it's got things\nlike the defragmenter and stuff,\n\n1095\n00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:22,910\nwhich we know are scheduled.\n\n1096\n00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:24,140\nWhere are they?\n\n1097\n00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:27,680\nWell, what we'll see here\nare the tasks that you created.\n\n1098\n00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,480\nSo if you've made some tasks and\ndefined them, they'll show up right here.\n\n1099\n00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:34,810\nBut the ones that Microsoft makes\ngo into this Microsoft folder.\n\n1100\n00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:39,116\nAnd if I start to take a look in here,\nwe'll find some of the antimalware and\n\n1101\n00:52:39,116 --> 00:52:42,620\nother types of services that\nmight be set up to run.\n\n1102\n00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:47,350\nAnd so you can see defrag right here, and\nthere's the defragmenter schedule set to\n\n1103\n00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:52,430\nrun every Wednesday at 1 AM, and\nI could edit that and change when it\n\n1104\n00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:56,790\nruns if I want, or I can go and change\nit in the defragmenting program itself.\n\n1105\n00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:59,180\nSame thing with Windows Backup and\nthe other guys.\n\n1106\n00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:02,710\nAnything that uses a schedule\nwill be in here somewhere.\n\n1107\n00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:07,170\nSo here's Windows Backup, and you can see\nthe backups that we configured earlier.\n\n1108\n00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:09,000\nWe said 1:00 AM every day.\n\n1109\n00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:09,750\nThere it is.\n\n1110\n00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:12,410\nRight?\nSo it's creating all these tasks right\n\n1111\n00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:17,320\nhere for us, and if we wanna make our own,\nwe can by going way up here to\n\n1112\n00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,900\nthe Task Scheduler Library, and\nyou'll see where you can create a task.\n\n1113\n00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,530\nAnd you can have it do\nall sorts of things.\n\n1114\n00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:27,240\nWhen you do Create Basic Task, you'll see\nthat it's got some neat options in here.\n\n1115\n00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,580\nI'll just call this my test task.\n\n1116\n00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,739\nAnd you can tell it when\nyou want it to run, so\n\n1117\n00:53:33,739 --> 00:53:37,561\nI might say run this one daily or\nwhen I log in or whatever.\n\n1118\n00:53:37,561 --> 00:53:40,665\nIf I choose daily, I get to pick when and\n\n1119\n00:53:40,665 --> 00:53:45,004\nI can say run every day at,\nwe'll do 2:00 AM.\n\n1120\n00:53:45,004 --> 00:53:47,150\nAll right.\n\n1121\n00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:48,520\nAnd recur every one day.\n\n1122\n00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,970\nAnd then what do we want to do?\n\n1123\n00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:54,130\nDo we wanna start a program,\nsend an email, display a message?\n\n1124\n00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:54,990\nRight?\nSo we can do\n\n1125\n00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:58,120\nall sorts of different messages or\nwhatever it is I want.\n\n1126\n00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,150\nI might choose to start a program, and\n\n1127\n00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:01,970\nthen right here I can tell\nit what program to run.\n\n1128\n00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:04,100\nSo, you can have it do all,\nall sorts of crazy things.\n\n1129\n00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:05,480\nAll right.\n\n1130\n00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,870\nSo that's the the Task Scheduler.\n\n1131\n00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:08,140\nIt's a neat utility.\n\n1132\n00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:10,440\nJust automates running\ntasks at certain times.\n\n1133\n00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:16,070\n>> All right, next item that we\nwanna take a look at is something\n\n1134\n00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:20,910\nwe've already mentioned previously in\nanother episode yeah in another episode.\n\n1135\n00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:22,500\nIs the Action Center.\n\n1136\n00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,020\nRemember that the Action Center is a one\n\n1137\n00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:28,750\nsingle icon that we normally see in\nthe lower right-hand corner of the screen.\n\n1138\n00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:33,270\nAnd when there are maintenance and\nsecurity tasks that need to be done,\n\n1139\n00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:37,720\nwe've neglected something, it believes\nwe're behind, something got missed.\n\n1140\n00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,940\nIt will put up that little flag\nwith the little mark on it, and\n\n1141\n00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:44,740\nthen give us the ability with one click\nto be able to change that action or\n\n1142\n00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:49,690\nto start, whatever the operating\nsystem thinks it needs for us to do.\n\n1143\n00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:52,358\n>> And\nwe've seen the Action Center several times\n\n1144\n00:54:52,358 --> 00:54:56,116\nover the course of the MTA series because\nevery time I disabled the virus or\n\n1145\n00:54:56,116 --> 00:54:59,407\nthe firewall, or whatever,\nit would start complaining to us.\n\n1146\n00:54:59,407 --> 00:55:00,842\nAnd I say it's complaining,\n\n1147\n00:55:00,842 --> 00:55:04,701\nbut it's helping you to recognize that\nyour system is not consistent, right?\n\n1148\n00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:08,037\nThere's some action you need to take\nto keep your system safe and so\n\n1149\n00:55:08,037 --> 00:55:09,450\nit's pretty useful.\n\n1150\n00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:11,088\nThat flag icon is how we\nnormally get to it, but\n\n1151\n00:55:11,088 --> 00:55:12,920\nyou can get to it through\nthe Control Panel, too.\n\n1152\n00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:15,764\nIf you go into your Control Panel and\ngo into System and Security,\n\n1153\n00:55:15,764 --> 00:55:17,120\nthen it's right under there.\n\n1154\n00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,290\nThe Action Center.\n\n1155\n00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:22,050\nAnd it just shows you security\nmaintenance tasks, and\n\n1156\n00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:24,090\nif there's something you're not doing,\nit'll light up in here.\n\n1157\n00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:28,563\nSo it's checking the Windows Firewall,\nAll Windows updates, virus protection,\n\n1158\n00:55:28,563 --> 00:55:29,940\nspyware.\n\n1159\n00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,610\nUnder the maintenance eye,\nchecking whether or\n\n1160\n00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:34,740\nnot you've got backups configured and\nwhether you're doing your updates.\n\n1161\n00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:35,930\nSo, just a couple basic things.\n\n1162\n00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:39,310\nAnd see how all these say, like,\nno action needed, no action needed.\n\n1163\n00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:41,680\nWell, that means that I'm,\nI'm safe right now.\n\n1164\n00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:42,180\nRight?\n\n1165\n00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:46,063\nBut, if it said something like, you know,\nyou haven't set up your backups,\n\n1166\n00:55:46,063 --> 00:55:49,569\ntt would warn me about that, and I would\nknow I need to get that configured.\n\n1167\n00:55:49,569 --> 00:55:51,950\nSo, just a nice little way to,\nto keep us honest.\n\n1168\n00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:53,087\n>> Yeah.\n\n1169\n00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:55,833\n>> And, that kinda leads us to\nour last tool for this one,\n\n1170\n00:55:55,833 --> 00:55:57,405\nwhich is System Information.\n\n1171\n00:55:57,405 --> 00:56:01,440\nWith System Information, If we reach the\npoint where we gotta call tech support,\n\n1172\n00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,768\nwe just can't figure out what's going on,\nyou call up old Microsoft, or whoever, and\n\n1173\n00:56:05,768 --> 00:56:08,890\nthey're gonna start asking you\nquestions about your system.\n\n1174\n00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:11,320\nAnd they might ask for a serial number,\nwhat version you're running,\n\n1175\n00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:12,640\nhow much memory you have.\n\n1176\n00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:17,060\nAnd the system information tool is really\nuseful for seeing that, all right.\n\n1177\n00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:20,390\nNow, when I say system information, a lot\nof people think of the system screen.\n\n1178\n00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:21,520\nLet me bring that up.\n\n1179\n00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,950\nIf you right-click on Computer and\n\n1180\n00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:26,690\nchoose Properties, you'll see some\nbasic information about your system.\n\n1181\n00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:28,820\nI see I'm running Windows 7 Enterprise.\n\n1182\n00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:30,400\nI see I've got 2 gigs of RAM.\n\n1183\n00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,020\nI got a Intel i7.\n\n1184\n00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,992\nI, you know,\nI see this basic information, but\n\n1185\n00:56:33,992 --> 00:56:36,760\nthere's a lot that isn't shown right here.\n\n1186\n00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:39,750\nInstead, if you go to your Start menu and\n\n1187\n00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:45,900\ngo to All Programs > Accessories\n> System Tools > and\n\n1188\n00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:50,350\nSystem Information, all right, the\nSystem Information screen is different.\n\n1189\n00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:52,080\nWe get a lot of that same information.\n\n1190\n00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:55,622\nI get I'm running Windows 7,\nI have a Intel i7,\n\n1191\n00:56:55,622 --> 00:56:59,450\nI've got a certain amount of memory,\n2 gigs of memory, right?\n\n1192\n00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:00,770\nBut I see a lot more.\n\n1193\n00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:03,530\nWhat time zone I'm in, my Hal version,\n\n1194\n00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:06,470\nthe version of Windows\ndown to the build number.\n\n1195\n00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:08,410\nI see a lot of additional stuff,\n\n1196\n00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:12,030\nwho made my system, right, I can see\nhere that it's a virtual machine.\n\n1197\n00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:15,230\nBut, if you run it on an actual system\nyou might see that it's Dell or HP and\n\n1198\n00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:18,010\na model number, you might even\nsee the serial number in there,\n\n1199\n00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:19,490\nit can list a lot of that.\n\n1200\n00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:22,980\nAnd then on the left side,\nHardware resources, right?\n\n1201\n00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,260\nWhat hardware do I have?\n\n1202\n00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:25,580\nTell me about my memory.\n\n1203\n00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:28,040\nAnd you can go in there and\nit will lay it out for you.\n\n1204\n00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,350\nYou can see exactly what you've got.\n\n1205\n00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:31,860\nTell me about my display.\n\n1206\n00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:35,600\nWhen I choose Display under Components,\nI see not only what video card I have,\n\n1207\n00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:39,230\nbut what version the driver is,\nwhen the driver was installed,\n\n1208\n00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:41,070\nwhat resolution I'm running at.\n\n1209\n00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:44,130\nYou see a ton of information.\n\n1210\n00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:47,290\nAnd where this is really handy is when\nyou're dealing with tech support,\n\n1211\n00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:49,720\nwe can save or export that.\n\n1212\n00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:54,070\nWe can dump it to a file and email it to\ntech support and now they know everything\n\n1213\n00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:57,470\nabout our system's configuration and\nthey can help with troubleshooting.\n\n1214\n00:57:57,470 --> 00:58:00,492\nMicrosoft will oftentimes request this\nwhen you call them on the phone for\n\n1215\n00:58:00,492 --> 00:58:01,130\ntech support.\n\n1216\n00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:04,340\nAll right, so real handy tool.\n\n1217\n00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:06,920\nA lot of people don't even know\nit's there, don't make use of it.\n\n1218\n00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:10,910\nBut it does have just everything you\ncould want to know about your system,\n\n1219\n00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:12,080\nyour service statuses.\n\n1220\n00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:13,630\nEverything is in here and\n\n1221\n00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:16,290\ndefinitely a great tool when you're\nreaching out to a tech support personnel.\n\n1222\n00:58:18,132 --> 00:58:20,870\nAll right, so those are some of\nthe maintenance tools that are included\n\n1223\n00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:21,670\ninside of Windows.\n\n1224\n00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:22,990\nThere's some good stuff there.\n\n1225\n00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:25,400\nNot things we'll use every single day,\nright?\n\n1226\n00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:29,452\nBut they are good to have and definitely\nthings we need to know for the exam.\n\n1227\n00:58:29,452 --> 00:58:30,717\nAll right.\n\n1228\n00:58:30,717 --> 00:58:32,665\nWe do still need to talk\nabout Windows updates, but\n\n1229\n00:58:32,665 --> 00:58:34,720\nI know we've blown past our\ntime on this segment too.\n\n1230\n00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,850\nSo let's stop here and take a break.\n\n1231\n00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:40,836\nAnd when we get back, we're gonna\ntackle keeping our system up to date.\n\n1232\n00:58:40,836 --> 00:58:43,379\nSo stay tuned,\nwe'll be back in just a moment.\n\n1233\n00:58:43,379 --> 00:58:50,488\n[MUSIC]\n\n1234\n00:58:50,488 --> 00:58:52,410\nAll right, welcome back, everybody.\n\n1235\n00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:57,030\nNow, sometimes, we can have\na problem with our computer and\n\n1236\n00:58:57,030 --> 00:58:58,230\nit's not actually our fault.\n\n1237\n00:58:58,230 --> 00:58:59,820\nRight?\nBelieve it or not, [LAUGH] believe it or\n\n1238\n00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:01,950\nnot, sometimes the problems\naren't your fault.\n\n1239\n00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:05,410\nThere are times where there are bugs or\nissues or\n\n1240\n00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:11,180\nsecurity exploits that are just a part\nof Windows and you're not to blame.\n\n1241\n00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:13,280\nBut you still get affected by it, right?\n\n1242\n00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,700\nAnd so you might be able to get a virus or\nmalware, or\n\n1243\n00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:19,245\nsomething like that on your\nmachine due to a bug in Windows.\n\n1244\n00:59:19,245 --> 00:59:20,060\n>> Yeah.\n\n1245\n00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:21,720\n>> So it's really important for\n\n1246\n00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:25,270\nus that, if that happens,\nwe fix it as soon as we can.\n\n1247\n00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:29,310\n>> Microsoft has been very good at\nactually being able to say, hey,\n\n1248\n00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:31,860\nlook, we know that there are problems\nthat are gonna arise because\n\n1249\n00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,245\nas technology continues to develop,\n\n1250\n00:59:33,245 --> 00:59:36,860\nwe're also gonna get people that\nwant to break our technology too.\n\n1251\n00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:39,740\nSo Microsoft implemented an update system\n\n1252\n00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:44,070\nthat allows us to be able to update\nthe code inside of the operating system\n\n1253\n00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:48,020\nto make sure that we're gonna have the\nmost operating secure system that we can.\n\n1254\n00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:51,890\nKeeping our systems up to date is one\nof the best things that we can do\n\n1255\n00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:55,600\nthat will protect our computer systems and\nkeep them running optimally.\n\n1256\n00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,740\n>> Yeah, and so Microsoft calls\nthat system Windows Update, and\n\n1257\n00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:02,320\nit's an automated system where\nyour computer running Windows\n\n1258\n01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:05,300\ncan reach out to Microsoft and\ncheck to see if any updates were posted.\n\n1259\n01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:09,550\nIf there were, it can download them and\neven automatically install them for you,\n\n1260\n01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:10,860\nso you don't have to worry about it.\n\n1261\n01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:13,030\nYou know your computer\nis always up to date.\n\n1262\n01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:16,650\nMost of the people who have computers that\nget infected by a virus or are hacked into\n\n1263\n01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:20,220\nor whatever could have prevented\nit by doing their Windows updates.\n\n1264\n01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:22,980\nAnd there used to be excuses,\nlike, oh, I don't wanna update.\n\n1265\n01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:24,350\nIt takes so much effort.\n\n1266\n01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:27,220\nBut now you just set it to run\nautomatically in the middle of\n\n1267\n01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:29,300\nthe night and you never,\nnever even have to worry about it.\n\n1268\n01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:29,800\nIt's just done.\nSo\n\n1269\n01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:33,378\nthere really is no excuse\nnot to use Windows Update.\n\n1270\n01:00:33,378 --> 01:00:35,370\nYou really should.\n\n1271\n01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:36,750\nLet me show you how it's set up.\n\n1272\n01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:38,850\nIt's probably already\nset up on your system.\n\n1273\n01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:43,120\nWhen you install Windows 7, during the\ninstaller it asks if you want to use it\n\n1274\n01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:45,780\nand if people say yes, then it's\njust done and it's already set up.\n\n1275\n01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:46,988\nBut if not, it's easy to check.\n\n1276\n01:00:46,988 --> 01:00:51,950\nIn Windows 7, if we just bring up our\nStart menu and go to All Programs,\n\n1277\n01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:53,270\nit's right here under All Programs.\n\n1278\n01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:54,990\nYou'll see Windows Update right there.\n\n1279\n01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:57,820\nYou can get to it through\nyour Control Panel also, but\n\n1280\n01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,560\nthis one's just right\nhere on our Start menu.\n\n1281\n01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:02,590\nAnd when you go in,\nyou're gonna see whether or\n\n1282\n01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:05,200\nnot Windows Update is even turned on.\n\n1283\n01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,160\nIf you have a green shield,\nWindows Updates is good to go.\n\n1284\n01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,090\nYou are checking for updates.\n\n1285\n01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:14,316\nIf it's a red shield, that means you're\nnot and you need to go and configure that.\n\n1286\n01:01:14,316 --> 01:01:18,771\nRight, so if I change my settings and\nI'm gonna tell it never check for updates,\n\n1287\n01:01:18,771 --> 01:01:22,256\nright, so I'm, I'm just telling it,\ndon't do it, right?\n\n1288\n01:01:22,256 --> 01:01:25,794\nWell, when I go back here, I still get my\ngreen shield because of as of right now,\n\n1289\n01:01:25,794 --> 01:01:29,021\nI'm up to date, but you see that bubble\nthat appeared down at the bottom,\n\n1290\n01:01:29,021 --> 01:01:32,015\nthe Action Center is letting me\nknow that I'm doing something bad.\n\n1291\n01:01:32,015 --> 01:01:35,305\nAnd over the next few weeks as more\nupdates come out from Microsoft,\n\n1292\n01:01:35,305 --> 01:01:39,115\nthis green shield will change to a red\nshield to let me know there's new updates\n\n1293\n01:01:39,115 --> 01:01:42,660\nout there and I don't have them,\ncuz I'm not doing automatic updates.\n\n1294\n01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:48,350\nSo if I wanna manually do updates,\nI can hit the Check for Updates link.\n\n1295\n01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:52,620\nIt'll go and look right now and give me\nthe opportunity to install them if I want.\n\n1296\n01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:55,800\nBut an automated schedule is even better.\n\n1297\n01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:58,620\nYou can go to Change Settings\non the left and\n\n1298\n01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:02,710\nyou'll see this drop down box\nright here for important updates.\n\n1299\n01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:04,730\nNow, what, what is an important update?\n\n1300\n01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:07,167\n>> An important update usually\nis a security update or\n\n1301\n01:02:07,167 --> 01:02:10,160\nan essential update that Microsoft says,\nlook.\n\n1302\n01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,460\nThere is something that's wrong.\n\n1303\n01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:16,480\nWe need to make sure we get this patch\npushed out to you as quickly as we can.\n\n1304\n01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,890\nAnd so that's why they're actually\nshowing up as being important,\n\n1305\n01:02:18,890 --> 01:02:21,180\nsomething that you should do.\n\n1306\n01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:23,550\nSo Microsoft does this,\nis it every second Tuesday?\n\n1307\n01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:24,880\nIt's, yeah.\n>> I think it's the second\n\n1308\n01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:25,660\nTuesday of every month.\n\n1309\n01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:26,665\n>> [CROSSTALK] second\nTuesday of every month.\n\n1310\n01:02:26,665 --> 01:02:29,865\nAnd so normally you'll get a regular\nseries of updates that come out\n\n1311\n01:02:29,865 --> 01:02:31,430\nduring a month.\n\n1312\n01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:32,480\nIn, yeah.\n\n1313\n01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,740\n>> And you can choose to go ahead and,\nand check for\n\n1314\n01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:38,360\nthe updates, but let us pick when\nto download and install them.\n\n1315\n01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:41,760\nYou can tell it to download them but\nnot install them yet, and\n\n1316\n01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,740\nthen ask us when we wanna install them.\n\n1317\n01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:48,550\nOr, what's recommended is let it\ndownload and install the updates for us.\n\n1318\n01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:49,940\nYou just choose to do that.\n\n1319\n01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:51,110\nAnd you can pick when.\n\n1320\n01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:52,776\nThe default is every day at 3 AM.\n\n1321\n01:02:52,776 --> 01:02:56,480\nSo at 3 AM, your system will reach\nout to Microsoft, check for updates,\n\n1322\n01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:01,510\ndownload them, install them, and even\nreboot if it's needed to apply the update.\n\n1323\n01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:02,690\nAll right?\n\n1324\n01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:05,430\nSo, pretty cool system there,\nfully automatic.\n\n1325\n01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:09,260\nNow, Microsoft, when they release the\nupdates, there are important updates and\n\n1326\n01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:11,580\nthere's recommended updates.\n\n1327\n01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:14,410\nRecommended updates are ones that, well,\n\n1328\n01:03:14,410 --> 01:03:15,890\nlike the name implies,\nthey recommend, right?\n\n1329\n01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:17,900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But aren't as urgent.\n\n1330\n01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:19,090\nYou don't have to do these.\n\n1331\n01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:21,350\nThese might be driver updates or\n\n1332\n01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:25,780\nnew software from Microsoft like\nSilverlight or what else do they push,\n\n1333\n01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:27,060\nthat stupid Bing bar-\n>> Yeah, Bing.\n\n1334\n01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:28,848\n>> And whatever things like that.\n\n1335\n01:03:28,848 --> 01:03:31,770\nThese are the ones that they're, they're\nmaking available to you if you want them.\n\n1336\n01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:34,140\nBut you don't have to install them.\n\n1337\n01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:36,980\nActually, the, the Bing bar and\nSilverlight fall under the third category-\n\n1338\n01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:37,500\n>> Optional, yeah.\n\n1339\n01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:38,620\n>> Which is optional updates.\n\n1340\n01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:40,220\nAnd optional updates aren't here.\n\n1341\n01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:42,160\nOptional updates are never automatic.\n\n1342\n01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,030\nThey're, they're something you'll\nalways have to choose on your own.\n\n1343\n01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:48,583\nSo I can see right here for recommended\nupdates, it's saying go ahead and do it.\n\n1344\n01:03:48,583 --> 01:03:52,192\nGo ahead and do the recommended updates\nalongside the important ones, but\n\n1345\n01:03:52,192 --> 01:03:54,550\nyou could turn that off\nif you didn't want them.\n\n1346\n01:03:54,550 --> 01:03:58,752\nAnd just a few other options in here,\nthis next one Microsoft update.\n\n1347\n01:03:58,752 --> 01:04:03,910\nBy default Windows Update is just looking\nfor updates for the operating system.\n\n1348\n01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:07,690\nBut if you've installed other\nMicrosoft software like Skype,\n\n1349\n01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:13,060\nSecurity Essentials Microsoft Office, any\nother Microsoft product, you can choose\n\n1350\n01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:18,410\nto do Microsoft updates which includes\nupdates for them also, not just Windows.\n\n1351\n01:04:18,410 --> 01:04:22,420\nIf I turn that off,\nthen I'm just doing Windows updates, and\n\n1352\n01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:25,220\nmy Security Essentials is\ngonna stop updating, right?\n\n1353\n01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:29,790\nBut if I leave it turned on, now I get\nmy Windows updates alongside my virus\n\n1354\n01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:32,850\ndefinitions and stuff for Security\nEssentials, and that, that's what I want.\n\n1355\n01:04:32,850 --> 01:04:34,740\nSo you'll see that term mentioned.\n\n1356\n01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:37,470\nMicrosoft Update versus Windows update.\n\n1357\n01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:41,140\nJust remember that Windows update\nis just the operating system, and\n\n1358\n01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:42,130\nnone of your software.\n\n1359\n01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:43,450\n>> Yeah.\n\n1360\n01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:47,890\nAnother element that we also can see\nduring the regular schedule of updates\n\n1361\n01:04:47,890 --> 01:04:49,580\nis what we call a hotfix.\n\n1362\n01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:51,910\nNow Don, we,\nwe've talked about an important update,\n\n1363\n01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:53,730\nsomething we absolutely should do.\n\n1364\n01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:56,920\nWhen we talk about optional updates,\nthat's up to you.\n\n1365\n01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:01,170\nRecommended updates, Microsoft will say\nyou should do it, it's still up to you.\n\n1366\n01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:03,970\nBut a hotfix, what is that really about?\n\n1367\n01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:07,850\nHotfixes are almost always\npertaining to a security exploit.\n\n1368\n01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:11,740\nThat means that there's some kind of\nsecurity vulnerability in your system, and\n\n1369\n01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:13,910\nMicrosoft has released\na hotfix to patch it.\n\n1370\n01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:17,530\nNow when they do that, it is usually\nthe second Tuesday of every month,\n\n1371\n01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:20,040\nunless it is a critical vulnerability.\n\n1372\n01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:21,550\nOne of these just happened a few days ago.\n\n1373\n01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:22,060\n>> Yeah.\n>> And\n\n1374\n01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:25,990\nMicrosoft will push one that is out of,\nout of sequence, so they'll, they'll say,\n\n1375\n01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:28,940\nwe don't care that it's actually\nthe third Thursday of the month,\n\n1376\n01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:32,830\nwe're gonna push this one out right now\ncuz it's critical and you got to have it.\n\n1377\n01:05:32,830 --> 01:05:34,810\nAnd so, hotfixes are like that.\n\n1378\n01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:37,450\nEven if you don't want the optional\nsoftware and stuff, you\n\n1379\n01:05:37,450 --> 01:05:42,004\nreally do need to do the hotfixes if your\ncomputer is plugged into a network, right?\n\n1380\n01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:43,990\nThat, that's gonna make it important.\n\n1381\n01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:47,190\nNow for me it's telling me I've got\nno important updates available.\n\n1382\n01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:48,650\nBut I do have some optional ones.\n\n1383\n01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:52,120\nAnd if I choose that I'll see\nthe list of optional updates.\n\n1384\n01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,590\nI don't see any recommended, and\n\n1385\n01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:56,500\nI don't see any important\nbecause I had those checked.\n\n1386\n01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:57,460\nIt's already done them.\n\n1387\n01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:59,560\nIt's already applied those updates.\n\n1388\n01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:02,060\nAnd if you ever are just not\nsure of what's been installed,\n\n1389\n01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:06,660\nwe can always go into our Control Panel\nand go to Uninstall a Program and\n\n1390\n01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:09,940\non that screen you can choose to view\nthe updates that were installed.\n\n1391\n01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:12,780\nActually, I think you can do that from\nthis other screen too, can't you?\n\n1392\n01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:13,390\nYeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1393\n01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:14,960\n>> View update history.\n\n1394\n01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,570\nSo I can see all the updates\nthat have been installed.\n\n1395\n01:06:17,570 --> 01:06:21,680\nI've got one update that was installed\ntoday, my antivirus definitions.\n\n1396\n01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,530\nYou should get those every single day.\n\n1397\n01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:26,040\nAnd then I see updates that\nwere installed yesterday.\n\n1398\n01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,790\nQuite a, quite a few,\nand then before that.\n\n1399\n01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:31,010\nSo I can see all these various\nupdates have been applied to my system\n\n1400\n01:06:31,010 --> 01:06:32,320\nsince I brought it up.\n\n1401\n01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:34,330\nMany of these were important.\n\n1402\n01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:36,280\nBut some of them were recommended.\n\n1403\n01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:38,620\nI don't think I've installed\nany optional ones.\n\n1404\n01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:39,790\nI guess I did a couple.\n\n1405\n01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:43,015\nWow.\nSecurity essentials is optional?\n\n1406\n01:06:43,015 --> 01:06:44,050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Seems kinda crazy.\n\n1407\n01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:48,290\nBut anyhow, so we can see those\nupdates and what's been applied.\n\n1408\n01:06:48,290 --> 01:06:50,282\nYou really do need to do Windows updates,\nvery important.\n\n1409\n01:06:50,282 --> 01:06:54,080\nAll right, so\nthose are some things to keep in mind.\n\n1410\n01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:59,088\nThere is an extra layer for those of you\nthat move on to do the MCSA certification,\n\n1411\n01:06:59,088 --> 01:07:03,434\nin a business environment you can\nset up what's called a WSUS server,\n\n1412\n01:07:03,434 --> 01:07:06,180\na Windows Server Update Service.\n\n1413\n01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:12,030\nAnd what it does is it lets you basically\nhave your own Windows update server.\n\n1414\n01:07:12,030 --> 01:07:14,140\nSo right here I'm reaching\nout to Microsoft and\n\n1415\n01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:17,110\nthey're telling me just the updates\nthat are available, but\n\n1416\n01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:20,450\nwith a WSUS server you have\nyour own Windows update server.\n\n1417\n01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:24,141\nIt reaches out to Microsoft and gets the\nupdates, but then you're able to pick and\n\n1418\n01:07:24,141 --> 01:07:25,972\nchoose which ones are allowed to apply.\n\n1419\n01:07:25,972 --> 01:07:30,310\nSometimes an update can break\nyour business software.\n\n1420\n01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:33,600\nFor example, if a new version\nof Internet Explorer comes out\n\n1421\n01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:34,460\nyou might not be ready for that.\n\n1422\n01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:36,520\nYour software might not support it yet.\n\n1423\n01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:40,125\nSo in WSUS you can turn\nturn off certain updates,\n\n1424\n01:07:40,125 --> 01:07:41,965\nlike that new version\nof Internet Explorer.\n\n1425\n01:07:41,965 --> 01:07:44,625\nYou still need to do\nyour security updates.\n\n1426\n01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:48,835\nBut maybe I stay on IE 10 and\nI don't go to IE 11 right away.\n\n1427\n01:07:48,835 --> 01:07:50,425\nIE 10 still gets security updates.\n\n1428\n01:07:50,425 --> 01:07:51,620\nIt's still supported.\n\n1429\n01:07:51,620 --> 01:07:55,850\nSo as long as you stay on supported\nsoftware it'll work out just fine.\n\n1430\n01:07:55,850 --> 01:07:58,590\nNow if you're saying I need to\nstay on Internet Explorer 6,\n\n1431\n01:07:58,590 --> 01:08:03,080\nthat's not supported by Microsoft anymore\nand it's not supported by WSUS either.\n\n1432\n01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:06,910\nIt's not gonna pull any updates for\nit and you're gonna be out of support.\n\n1433\n01:08:06,910 --> 01:08:09,220\nThat's definitely not\na situation you wanna be in.\n\n1434\n01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:12,250\nSo you never wanna stay on old,\nunsupported software.\n\n1435\n01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:15,560\nBut as long as the software is supported\nby Microsoft, they'll continue to release\n\n1436\n01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:18,960\nupdates for it even though new versions\nof the software might have come out.\n\n1437\n01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,880\nSo just be aware of that as you move\ninto like, a business environment,\n\n1438\n01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,010\nthings are a little different.\n\n1439\n01:08:24,010 --> 01:08:27,080\nAnd if you wanna learn more about that,\nwe do cover that in our server shows,\n\n1440\n01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:30,260\nand maybe in the, I don't think we\ndo it in the Window's 7 show, do we?\n\n1441\n01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:32,600\nIt's just in the server shows.\n\n1442\n01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,740\nYeah.\nWe dive into WSUS there, so.\n\n1443\n01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:38,745\nAll right, but as far as our basic\nsystem maintenance, that's it.\n\n1444\n01:08:38,745 --> 01:08:41,127\nThere, there are plenty of\nother third-party tools and\n\n1445\n01:08:41,127 --> 01:08:43,912\ntricks of the trade out there,\nand troubleshooting mechanisms.\n\n1446\n01:08:43,912 --> 01:08:48,002\nBut for the MTA exam, they want you\nto be familiar with what's built into\n\n1447\n01:08:48,002 --> 01:08:51,088\nWindows right there, and\nwe've seen the bulk of the,\n\n1448\n01:08:51,088 --> 01:08:54,800\nthe primary tools with our go to\ntools available on every system.\n\n1449\n01:08:55,990 --> 01:08:58,240\n>> Yeah, when you're supporting\njust the regular end user,\n\n1450\n01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:01,490\nmost of the time you might not actually\ndo this on every single computer.\n\n1451\n01:09:01,490 --> 01:09:04,430\n>> A lot of times in the business\nyou're gonna see it being managed\n\n1452\n01:09:04,430 --> 01:09:05,790\ncentrally sometimes.\n\n1453\n01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:08,660\nBut if you're out there just as\na regular support technician\n\n1454\n01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:11,670\nthese tools will help you to be able to do\n\n1455\n01:09:11,670 --> 01:09:15,010\nthose things that can really help the end\nuser get a better experience right away.\n\n1456\n01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:21,490\n>> All right, and with that, we've\nwrapped up our maintenance objective and\n\n1457\n01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:24,570\nwe've really wrapped up the objectives for\nthe entire show.\n\n1458\n01:09:24,570 --> 01:09:25,990\nSo, now we're done, right?\n\n1459\n01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:29,540\nAnd we get to kick our feet up on the desk\nand we're done, well not quite, right?\n\n1460\n01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:32,520\nWell, now it's time to study,\nhit those books, review the content,\n\n1461\n01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:35,380\nmake sure you know it,\npractice a little bit.\n\n1462\n01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:38,730\nI know I mentioned this in another\nepisode, but if you don't have a Windows 7\n\n1463\n01:09:38,730 --> 01:09:42,600\nmachine handy,\nmake sure you use the ITProTV vLabs.\n\n1464\n01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,990\nIf you go to that little\nMore menu on our web page,\n\n1465\n01:09:44,990 --> 01:09:48,190\nyou'll see V Labs under there and\ngo to the A plus vLab.\n\n1466\n01:09:48,190 --> 01:09:50,251\nWe have a vLab that's made for\nCompT A plus,\n\n1467\n01:09:50,251 --> 01:09:52,441\nactually [CROSSTALK] let\nme bring that up here.\n\n1468\n01:09:52,441 --> 01:09:56,650\nI'm gonna jump over to\nthe ITProTV website.\n\n1469\n01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:59,440\nAnd and check that out here.\n\n1470\n01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:02,580\nSo, I'm on the ITProTV website and\nI'm just gonna go to More up here.\n\n1471\n01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:04,620\nAnd find the vLabs right here.\n\n1472\n01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:06,220\nVirtual labs.\n\n1473\n01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:09,180\nI'll go and pull that up and\nyou'll see a bunch of them up there.\n\n1474\n01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:12,095\nWe've got Windows 8 vLabs and\nserver 2012 vLabs.\n\n1475\n01:10:12,095 --> 01:10:17,545\nIf you go to the CompTIA one though,\nthe CompTIA vLab is actually Windows 7.\n\n1476\n01:10:17,545 --> 01:10:19,805\nAnd so if you wanna practice\nwith a Windows 7 machine,\n\n1477\n01:10:19,805 --> 01:10:21,475\nthis is the one for you.\n\n1478\n01:10:21,475 --> 01:10:23,892\nIt's got a server,\nyou can just ignore that.\n\n1479\n01:10:23,892 --> 01:10:25,182\nBut there's a Windows 7 machine,\n\n1480\n01:10:25,182 --> 01:10:28,142\nyou can do all the stuff that\nwe've done in this show.\n\n1481\n01:10:28,142 --> 01:10:31,550\nYou can mess around with it, and if you\nhose it up, if you break the system and\n\n1482\n01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:32,900\nit won't boot, no big deal.\n\n1483\n01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:36,696\nYou just exit the lab and it puts\nit all back to the way that it was.\n\n1484\n01:10:36,696 --> 01:10:40,287\nSo, great way to experiment,\nand learn, and mess around, and\n\n1485\n01:10:40,287 --> 01:10:42,760\nnot have to mess up your own machine.\n\n1486\n01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:46,700\nSo that's another resource of\nyour ITProTV subscription.\n\n1487\n01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:48,550\nDoesn't cost extra, so\nyou might as well use it.\n\n1488\n01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:49,564\n>> Awesome.\n\n1489\n01:10:49,564 --> 01:10:53,540\nAll right, well let me remind\nyou guys if you have any\n\n1490\n01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:57,420\nquestions while you're studying,\nhitting the books, be sure to let us know.\n\n1491\n01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,800\nAt any time you can go to the Q and\nA forums.\n\n1492\n01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:03,280\nIt's that Q and A link at the top\nof every page on ITProTV.\n\n1493\n01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:03,860\nJump in there.\n\n1494\n01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:06,010\nWe've got a Microsoft forum just for\nthis stuff.\n\n1495\n01:11:06,010 --> 01:11:08,470\nPost your questions and\nwe monitor and answer.\n\n1496\n01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:11,010\nWe wanna make sure you guys\nhave the answers you need so\n\n1497\n01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:13,870\nthat when you go into that testing booth,\nyou're going in with answers,\n\n1498\n01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:15,300\nnot going in with questions, right?\n\n1499\n01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:16,960\nThat's the real important part.\n\n1500\n01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:20,560\nMake sure you grasp the content and\nunderstand everything so\n\n1501\n01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,340\nyou're successful the first\ntime you take that exam.\n\n1502\n01:11:23,390 --> 01:11:25,650\nAll right,\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed the series.\n\n1503\n01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:26,640\nWe had fun filming it.\n\n1504\n01:11:26,640 -->

if you're gonna go and jump into\nthat MTA exam, best of luck to you.\n\n1507\n01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:37,420\nAnd let us know when you pass.\n\n1508\n01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:39,400\nWe always love to hear from\npeople when they come back and\n\n1509\n01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:42,930\nthey say, I got MTA certified and\nboy, it was a blast.\n\n1510\n01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:43,544\n>> Yeah.\n>> And we,\n\n1511\n01:11:43,544 --> 01:11:44,750\nwe love to hear from that stuff.\n\n1512\n01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:47,925\nSo definitely keep us in the loop.\n\n1513\n01:11:47,925 --> 01:11:51,093\nAll

specifically.\n\n8\n00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.640\nAnd joining us in the studio again today,\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryant.\n\n9\n00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.055\nWes, glad to have you back my man,\nhow's it going out there?\n\n10\n00:00:30.055 --> 00:00:33.472\n&gt;&gt; Well man its going great, props to\nyou for remembering those exam codes,\n\n11\n00:00:33.472 --> 00:00:35.632\nboy they're an acronym in and\nof themselves.\n\n12\n00:00:35.632 --> 00:00:40.060\nAnd that's right, we're here to\nactually wrap up our MTA series.\n\n13\n00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.110\nAnd one of the last things that\nwe are gonna discuss are about\n\n14\n00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.870\nmaintaining the availability\nof your machines.\n\n15\n00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.570\nAnd we do that typically through backup\nof our machines, recovery of our machines\n\n16\n00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.470\nas well as just general maintenance\nthrough things like your Windows updates.\n\n17\n00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.490\nSo we're gonna talk about some of\nthose concepts here in this episode.\n\n18\n00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.452\nOne of the very first ones that we're\ngonna dive into is an oldie but goodie,\n\n19\n00:01:04.452 --> 00:01:06.232\none that's been around Windows for awhile.\n\n20\n00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:10.754\nAnd it's one that we use when\nwe have maybe problematic\n\n21\n00:01:10.754 --> 00:01:13.318\nsymptoms within our systems.\n\n22\n00:01:13.318 --> 00:01:17.466\nWe look at, for instance, if we install\napplications and they cause problems or\n\n23\n00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:19.960\nif we install drivers they cause problems.\n\n24\n00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.600\nWouldn't it be nice to be able to restore\nyour computer to a its configuration\n\n25\n00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.140\nstate to an earlier point in time.\n\n26\n00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.127\nAnd that's the piece of software\nknown as system restore.\n\n27\n00:01:29.127 --> 00:01:31.846\nNow again this is not new\ntechnology to windows so\n\n28\n00:01:31.846 --> 00:01:36.507\nif you've have been in Windows 7, if\nyou've been in, actually going back to XP.\n\n29\n00:01:36.507 --> 00:01:39.611\nIf you've been in Windows XP,\nWindows 7, 8, 8.1 and\n\n30\n00:01:39.611 --> 00:01:43.338\nnow the flagship client operating\nsystem for Windows, Windows 10,\n\n31\n00:01:43.338 --> 00:01:46.090\nthen you're probably\nalready familiar with this.\n\n32\n00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.520\nHowever, if this is the first time\nyou've ever heard about system restore,\n\n33\n00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.420\nit's really gonna be\nimportant to understand it.\n\n34\n00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.330\nNot only from an exam perspective, but\nreally to take it for a test drive, kind\n\n35\n00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.310\nof see what it does, so that if you have\nto support end users in your environment,\n\n36\n00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.040\nyou will know one of the utilities\nthat's really baked into Windows,\n\n37\n00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.920\nthat it doesn't require going to a third\nparty to get this functionality.\n\n38\n00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.420\nLet's go and dive right in here.\n\n39\n00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.270\nI've got a Windows 10 machine and what\nwe're gonna do is we're gonna show you how\n\n40\n00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.650\nto ensure that system restore is enabled,\n\n41\n00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.040\nthat it is turned on and\nready to protect our systems.\n\n42\n00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.900\nSo let's go ahead, and\n\n43\n00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.190\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna\ngo to our system properties.\n\n44\n00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.890\nAnd there's a few different ways that\nyou can get to your system properties.\n\n45\n00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.550\nYou can always right-click on your little\nWindows icon down here in the Start menu\n\n46\n00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.630\nor the task bar, excuse me.\n\n47\n00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.060\nAnd from here we can just\nchoose if we want System.\n\n48\n00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.740\nAnother way that you can do this too\nis if you open File Explorer and\n\n49\n00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.760\nthere is,\nover here on the left hand side, This PC.\n\n50\n00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.180\nAnd if I was to right-click,\nI could scroll down and\n\n51\n00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.070\nwe could choose, for instance, if I\ncan get there without it disappearing,\n\n52\n00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.270\nwe can choose Properties here.\n\n53\n00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.280\nSo either way will take you\nto the system control panel.\n\n54\n00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.420\nYou can also go via Control Panel too.\n\n55\n00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.320\nSo if we open up our Control Panel\nwe can go to System and Security and\n\n56\n00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.330\nwe can go to system.\n\n57\n00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.100\nSo you can see few different ways\nto get to the same location.\n\n58\n00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.790\nAnd I can tell you if this first time you\nmaybe are endeavoring in a Microsoft exam,\n\n59\n00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.860\nunderstand that you don't know\nwhich way they're gonna ask you.\n\n60\n00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.280\nSo, really get familiar with\nthe operating system and\n\n61\n00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.560\nknow multiple ways to get\nto different locations.\n\n62\n00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.860\nSo with that being said, let's go ahead.\n\n63\n00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.000\nWe're going to use our task link and\nwe're going to use this option right here.\n\n64\n00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.270\nWe're going to click this little\nsystem protection task link.\n\n65\n00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.230\nIt does bring you into\nthe system properties.\n\n66\n00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.350\nI do want you to keep in mind though, that\npretty much except for Device Manager,\n\n67\n00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.370\nevery one one of these links will take\nyou to the traditional system properties.\n\n68\n00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.190\nSo if I hit advanced system settings,\nyou can see it's still system properties,\n\n69\n00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.070\nit's just what tab is the focus.\n\n70\n00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.710\nIn this case I want the focus\nto be the System Protection tab.\n\n71\n00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.100\nNow one of the things that you're probably\ngonna see right away is the protection\n\n72\n00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.620\nsettings.\n\n73\n00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.740\nAnd I can see Local Disk (C:),\nthis is our root drive.\n\n74\n00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.860\nAnd I can see the protection\nis turned off.\n\n75\n00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.780\nWell, that's a bad thing because one of\nthe things you'll also notice is that that\n\n76\n00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.900\ndisables here our System Restore.\n\n77\n00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.030\nAnd that's certainly not gonna help\nus if we need to use system restore.\n\n78\n00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.860\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n79\n00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:21.030\nstart this by getting it configured\nto use our system restore utility.\n\n80\n00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.740\nWe're gonna go ahead and choose configure.\n\n81\n00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.940\n&gt;&gt; Wes, really quickly, why is it that\nthey disable this by default, why so?\n\n82\n00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.890\nYou would think this is something\nthat would have enabled by default?\n\n83\n00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.920\n&gt;&gt; I'm honestly not sure why,\none of the reasons I would guess, and\n\n84\n00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.130\nagain this speculation here, is they've\ngot a lot of other things today that\n\n85\n00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.708\nwe can use that, the system restore\nhas been around for a while.\n\n86\n00:04:42.708 --> 00:04:45.250\nNow, they have new technologies out,\nlike a system reset and\n\n87\n00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.060\nPC refreshes,\nthat can basically reinstall Window's,\n\n88\n00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.330\nkeep your files in place, or\ncompletely eliminate your files.\n\n89\n00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.370\nHowever, that's a little intrusive,\nright, maybe we just need to restore our\n\n90\n00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.810\nconfiguration files and\nthat's where system restore is.\n\n91\n00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.870\nSo one of the things I would say is it's\nprobably disabled because of the other\n\n92\n00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.580\ntechnologies they have.\n\n93\n00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.211\nHowever, I like to turn it on and\nuse it because it's the least, for\n\n94\n00:05:08.211 --> 00:05:12.805\nme it's one of the least intrusive methods\nto troubleshooting a system and hopefully\n\n95\n00:05:12.805 --> 00:05:17.182\nbringing it back online if you get this\nintermittent activity or problems here.\n\n96\n00:05:17.182 --> 00:05:20.160\nSo once we've gone in here\nto system protection for\n\n97\n00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.089\nthe disk, we're gonna go ahead and we're\ngonna choose turn on system protection.\n\n98\n00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:29.340\nWe also have a certain\namount of disk usage.\n\n99\n00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.849\nKeep in mind that it is very very low\nat first and that's because we can take\n\n100\n00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:37.362\nthis all the way up to 13 gigs and\neven beyond if we want.\n\n101\n00:05:37.362 --> 00:05:39.858\nBut keep in mind that when you do that,\n\n102\n00:05:39.858 --> 00:05:43.374\nyou run the risk of accruing\na lot of Hard Drive space.\n\n103\n00:05:43.374 --> 00:05:48.056\nAnd anytime you start accruing storage and\nthe capacity starts to grow,\n\n104\n00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:53.199\nyou could potentially see problems even\nthough drive sizes today, for the most\n\n105\n00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:58.320\npart, we don't really have to worry\nabout our drives being too small today.\n\n106\n00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.520\nSo let's go ahead and\nwe'll choose OK to the this and\n\n107\n00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.290\nnow you can see there's a little\nbit of difference here.\n\n108\n00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.350\nWe changed that from Off to On.\n\n109\n00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.370\nSo remember that on the exam.\n\n110\n00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.330\nIt might be one of these things\nthat you come in here and\n\n111\n00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.840\nyou see System Restore is turned off but\nthey don't show you anything else.\n\n112\n00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.970\nAnd you have to know just from a shot\nlike this that if that says off, right,\n\n113\n00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.160\nSystem Protection, then that's\nwhy System Restore is grayed out.\n\n114\n00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.580\nAll right, so that means we're\nready to use system restore, right?\n\n115\n00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.020\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's choose system restore and\n\n116\n00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.840\none of the first things that you're\ngonna see is that it gives me a warning.\n\n117\n00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.950\nAll right, it says no restore points have\nbeen created on your computer system.\n\n118\n00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.190\nSo what does that mean for us?\n\n119\n00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.930\nWell, that's where we get to talk\nabout what a restore point is.\n\n120\n00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.990\nA restore point is a point in time\nsnapshot of the system configuration.\n\n121\n00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.940\nAnd if you install an application,\nyou update a driver,\n\n122\n00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.650\nit changes the registry, right?\n\n123\n00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.550\nIt modifies the settings in the registry\nthat is essentially the configuration\n\n124\n00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.250\ndatabase for Windows.\n\n125\n00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.760\nNow, if you want to restore\nto an earlier point in time,\n\n126\n00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.260\nyou have to have a restore point.\n\n127\n00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.856\nSo that's the next process that we\nhave to do in using System Restore.\n\n128\n00:07:09.856 --> 00:07:12.366\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll close that down and\n\n129\n00:07:12.366 --> 00:07:15.956\nyou'll see that there is another\noption here that we wanna look at.\n\n130\n00:07:15.956 --> 00:07:20.136\nAnd you'll see it's down here at the\nbottom under Configure where we turned on\n\n131\n00:07:20.136 --> 00:07:22.140\nour system protection.\n\n132\n00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.710\nNotice it says create\na restore point now for\n\n133\n00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.700\nthe drives that have system\nprotection turned on.\n\n134\n00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.740\nAnd in order to do that,\nwe're gonna use this Create button.\n\n135\n00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:36.065\nAnd when we do that, it gives us the\noption to manually create a restore point.\n\n136\n00:07:36.065 --> 00:07:37.168\nWe're gonna go ahead and do that.\n\n137\n00:07:37.168 --> 00:07:40.986\nI'm gonna type in here app install and\n\n138\n00:07:40.986 --> 00:07:45.531\nI'll go ahead and\ncreate the restore point.\n\n139\n00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:48.089\nNow you can see that it is\ncreating that restore point.\n\n140\n00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:53.036\nAnd what I've done is I've said okay,\nthe way this computer is configured now,\n\n141\n00:07:53.036 --> 00:07:57.692\nthese are the settings, these are the\npristine state if you want that I wanna\n\n142\n00:07:57.692 --> 00:08:00.124\ncapture inside of this restore point.\n\n143\n00:08:00.124 --> 00:08:02.995\nSo we went ahead, and we created one.\n\n144\n00:08:02.995 --> 00:08:05.490\nNow, once this restore\npoint gets finished.\n\n145\n00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:06.963\nWhat we're gonna do,\n\n146\n00:08:06.963 --> 00:08:12.100\nis we're gonna do an application install\nlike the restore point names says.\n\n147\n00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.570\nLet me give you a piece of advice.\n\n148\n00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.630\nNot so much for the exam,\nbut for your own benefit.\n\n149\n00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:21.200\nI don't rely on that little information\n\n150\n00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.920\nbox that says system restore has\nsuccessfully created a restore point.\n\n151\n00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.110\nWhat I usually do is I'll\ngo up to system restore and\n\n152\n00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:33.790\nI'll start that, basically that\nSystem Restore Wizard again.\n\n153\n00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:37.210\nAnd notice that it's not,\nit isn't giving me that warning anymore.\n\n154\n00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.140\nThat lets me know that\nI've got a restore point.\n\n155\n00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:40.940\nBut I'll go even farther than that and\n\n156\n00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:45.860\nI'll make sure that the restore\npoint has been created for me.\n\n157\n00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.000\nAgain, when we talk about backups.\n\n158\n00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.748\nYou run backup operations.\n\n159\n00:08:49.748 --> 00:08:51.930\nYou don't wanna wait until you\nneed your backups to test out and\n\n160\n00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.900\nfind out if your backups are successful or\nnot.\n\n161\n00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:59.090\nThis is one of those ways that even on a\nminute scale that we can do that even for\n\n162\n00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:00.370\nsomething like system restore.\n\n163\n00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:03.520\nSo lets go ahead and\nlet's install an application.\n\n164\n00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.340\nI got notepad ++.\n\n165\n00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.540\nNow please understand guys, so\nthis is just this is just for\n\n166\n00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.500\nthe demonstrations for\nhow when you do a system restore,\n\n167\n00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:14.560\nyou do have the ability to restore your\ncomputer an earlier point in time.\n\n168\n00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.383\nThere is nothing wrong with notepad ++.\n\n169\n00:09:17.383 --> 00:09:20.730\nThis is an excellent application,\nso don't think I'm digging on this.\n\n170\n00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.070\nIt's just using this as an example.\n\n171\n00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:24.240\nSo we'll go ahead.\n\n172\n00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.620\nWe'll walk through the installer here.\n\n173\n00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.170\nWe'll just keep walking through,\nnext, next, next, next.\n\n174\n00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.260\nAnd once this gets installed,\nwe'll go ahead and\n\n175\n00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.480\nyou'll see that it should open up.\n\n176\n00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.440\nOnce we choose, Finish.\n\n177\n00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.940\n&gt;&gt; Great little piece\nof software by the way.\n\n178\n00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.170\n&gt;&gt; It really is, I like it.\n\n179\n00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:42.300\nLike I said, guys,\ndon't think that Notepad++ is causing\n\n180\n00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.445\nabsolutely no problems\non my computer here.\n\n181\n00:09:44.445 --> 00:09:49.250\nSo I'm not gonna update it but one thing\nI do wanna do is I wanna verify for\n\n182\n00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:52.860\nyou guys, no cards up the sleeve,\nno rabbit in the hat.\n\n183\n00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.490\nWe do wanna make sure that\nthis is installed locally.\n\n184\n00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:57.610\nSo let me just verify that for you guys.\n\n185\n00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:00.200\nWe're gonna go to programs and\nfeatures here.\n\n186\n00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.750\nAnd then you can see that yes,\nit is a local installation.\n\n187\n00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.650\nNo virtualized applications here or\nanything.\n\n188\n00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.980\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna run our System Restore.\n\n189\n00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.940\nNow to do that we're gonna\ngo back to the same spot.\n\n190\n00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:15.420\nWe're gonna right click on our desktop or\nour Windows icon.\n\n191\n00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.080\nAnd we're gonna go ahead,\nand we'll choose system.\n\n192\n00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.950\nAnd then we'll go back\nto system protection.\n\n193\n00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:21.790\nAll right.\n\n194\n00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:25.390\nAnd we're gonna go ahead, and\nwe're gonna run the system restore.\n\n195\n00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:26.940\nNow, we'll go ahead and run this.\n\n196\n00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.870\nAnd as we start out, it's gonna\nask us to choose the next button.\n\n197\n00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:36.420\nAnd then we're gonna pick the restore\npoint that we want to choose.\n\n198\n00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.300\nSo we'll go ahead and choose that.\n\n199\n00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.300\nAnd then we'll choose Next.\n\n200\n00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.730\nNow, I kinda did that a little fast.\n\n201\n00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:48.570\nLet me go and choose Back, because when\nwe select the restore point that we want,\n\n202\n00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:50.470\nyou'll see that there's this\nlittle button down here.\n\n203\n00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:53.660\nThat little button says Scan for\naffected programs.\n\n204\n00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:58.610\nYou wanna check that out because\nas you can see, as system restore\n\n205\n00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:02.890\nis trying to figure out what applications\nare really going to be effected by this,\n\n206\n00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:07.650\nyou can already see that Notepad++,\nit lets me know that programs and\n\n207\n00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:12.610\ndrivers that will be deleted if\nwe perform this system restore.\n\n208\n00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.911\nSo we're gonna go ahead.\n&gt;&gt; Sort of a nice capture there, right?\n\n209\n00:11:14.911 --> 00:11:18.568\nTo say hey, if you need to take a step\nback and go maybe this isn't the route I\n\n210\n00:11:18.568 --> 00:11:21.700\nwanna go, kinda gives you\na little bit of a heads up right?\n\n211\n00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:22.200\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n212\n00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.170\nAnd Dan that's a good point\nbecause let me show you guys\n\n213\n00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:26.950\neven more at like how right that is.\n\n214\n00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:31.270\nEven on the summary screen, they show\nyou how important it is to check that.\n\n215\n00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:34.450\nCuz they give you a little task\nlink that says right at the end,\n\n216\n00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:35.800\nare you sure you wanna do this.\n\n217\n00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.510\nAnd now of course I could click this and\n\n218\n00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:41.260\nit does the same thing as\nwe see in the last button.\n\n219\n00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.290\nNow we're gonna go ahead and\nchoose Finish.\n\n220\n00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:46.460\nAnd this is probably an important point.\n\n221\n00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.480\nNotice that it says system restore\ncannot be interrupted guys.\n\n222\n00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.260\nI want you to think of this as kinda\nlike firmware updates all right.\n\n223\n00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.070\nA little bit different\nwith a firmware update.\n\n224\n00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:58.930\nYou can permanently brick like a network\ndevice if you interrupt a firmware update.\n\n225\n00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:00.770\nYou might not break your operating system.\n\n226\n00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:02.090\nYou might not break your computer.\n\n227\n00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:04.860\nBut you might end up have to\nreinstall the operating system.\n\n228\n00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:09.220\nSo even though this is one of the least\nintrusive methods for doing recovery.\n\n229\n00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:13.510\nKeep in mind that if it is interrupted,\nit could be very intrusive.\n\n230\n00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:15.830\nIn the fact that you might\nhave to do a full PC reset.\n\n231\n00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:18.590\n&gt;&gt; Boy we've come a long way since\nI started in the business because I\n\n232\n00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:21.490\nremember, it was like a rite of\npassage having to blow away your\n\n233\n00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:25.530\ncomputer a few times because you made\nmistakes and you weren't prepared for\n\n234\n00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.250\nthe outcome and you lost all your files.\n\n235\n00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:28.740\nAnd you're like, no.\n\n236\n00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:33.395\nNow we have kind of nannies that kind of\nwatch over and go are you sure about that?\n\n237\n00:12:33.395 --> 00:12:35.235\nMake sure that that's\nexactly what you wanna do.\n\n238\n00:12:35.235 --> 00:12:36.755\nAnd then if you do wanna do that,\n\n239\n00:12:36.755 --> 00:12:39.265\nmake sure that these types\nof situations don't occur.\n\n240\n00:12:39.265 --> 00:12:40.025\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n241\n00:12:40.025 --> 00:12:42.525\nSo what do you say, Dan, we go ahead and\nwe're gonna cross our fingers.\n\n242\n00:12:42.525 --> 00:12:43.195\n&gt;&gt; Pull the trigger.\n\n243\n00:12:43.195 --> 00:12:45.465\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and we'll go ahead and\nsay yes to this.\n\n244\n00:12:45.465 --> 00:12:49.465\nAnd you'll see that it says\npreparing to restore your system.\n\n245\n00:12:49.465 --> 00:12:53.145\nAnd that's a good thing, again that's what\nwe want, we want it to restore the system.\n\n246\n00:12:53.145 --> 00:12:56.212\nAnd now what you should see it's gonna do,\nit'll do a couple of things.\n\n247\n00:12:56.212 --> 00:12:59.860\nIt's gonna restart your computer, and then\nSysprep is gonna initialize, and then,\n\n248\n00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.490\none of the last things it does\nis it modifies the registry.\n\n249\n00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:06.490\nWhen I say registry modification, keep in\nmind it's actually undoing the changes\n\n250\n00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:10.420\nthat had the point in time changes that\nhave happened between the last restore\n\n251\n00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:15.820\npoint and the current configuration.\n\n252\n00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.010\nSo we'll give it just a second here and\n\n253\n00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:20.590\nyou'll see there system\nrestore is initializing.\n\n254\n00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:23.950\nIf we were to wait here long enough we'd\nalso see that it would say that it's\n\n255\n00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.540\nsetting up the registry and\nit'll be making those changes.\n\n256\n00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.660\nBut rather than make\nyou guys wait on this,\n\n257\n00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.780\nwhat we'll do is we'll let this go ahead.\n\n258\n00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:34.520\nAnd we'll let this keep running and we'll\nmove into some of the next portions that\n\n259\n00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.810\nwe have to show in some\nof the other topics here.\n\n260\n00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:39.030\nSo we'll let that go ahead and\nrun in the background.\n\n261\n00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:44.380\nAnd the next thing I'd like to talk about\nis something known as a recovery drive.\n\n262\n00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:48.660\nWhen you configure a recovery drive,\nunderstand that this is a way that if your\n\n263\n00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:54.000\ncomputer happens to get into an unbootable\nstate, you get a corruption on the hard\n\n264\n00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.910\ndrive, maybe you need to do some trouble\non it and you can't boot the machine.\n\n265\n00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:03.140\nWell, you can make a recovery drive that\nessentially takes a USB thumb drive,\n\n266\n00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:10.120\na 4 gigs or larger and it converts\nit into a bootable recovery media.\n\n267\n00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.620\nNow when I say 4 gigs or larger, let's be\ncareful with this one because if you're\n\n268\n00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:17.780\nonly using it for the recovery environment\nthen you only need about 500 megs.\n\n269\n00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.410\nHowever, if you capture\nyour system information and\n\n270\n00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:24.780\nall your system state data,\nit could be sizably larger than that.\n\n271\n00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:25.852\nSo I've gone ahead and\n\n272\n00:14:25.852 --> 00:14:28.795\nI've already plugged a USB drive\ninto the machine here guys.\n\n273\n00:14:28.795 --> 00:14:34.421\nAnd let's just show you on this\nWindows machine how we're gonna\n\n274\n00:14:34.421 --> 00:14:41.416\ncreate a recovery drive, and let me just\nmake sure here real quick, of who am I.\n\n275\n00:14:41.416 --> 00:14:44.803\nAll right, so I'm gonna have to make\nsure that I, give me a second here guys.\n\n276\n00:14:44.803 --> 00:14:48.184\nWe're gonna log out of this user.\n\n277\n00:14:48.184 --> 00:14:51.130\nIt has to be an administrative user,\n\n278\n00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:54.670\nthe very first administrative user\nto create the recovery drive.\n\n279\n00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:57.930\nThat is something important, so\nif I was to use Admin01 here,\n\n280\n00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.330\ndon't let the name fool you.\n\n281\n00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.050\nWe wouldn't actually be able\nto create the recovery drive.\n\n282\n00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:07.940\nSo make sure that you're logged\nin as that local administrator,\n\n283\n00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.710\nfirst administrator that essentially\n\n284\n00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:14.880\nis the account you create when you install\nthe operating system for the first time.\n\n285\n00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:15.588\nNow here we go.\n\n286\n00:15:15.588 --> 00:15:18.620\nNow I'm gonna use the search\nfunctionality down here and\n\n287\n00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:22.187\nwhat we're gonna do is we're\njust gonna type in recovery.\n\n288\n00:15:22.187 --> 00:15:27.320\nAll right, and what you'll see is that\nthere is this create a recovery drive,\n\n289\n00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.530\nthat's one way to get to it.\n\n290\n00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:32.110\nUse the search functionality\nit's a great thing to have.\n\n291\n00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:33.700\nHowever, this, like anything else,\n\n292\n00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.230\ndoes have its place inside a control\npanel if you know where to find it.\n\n293\n00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:37.720\nSo we'll help you guys out with that, too.\n\n294\n00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:41.960\nI'm gonna right-click on the Windows\ncharm, or Windows icon, if you will.\n\n295\n00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.000\nI'll choose control panel.\n\n296\n00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:47.040\nNow with this one you're\ngonna have to go back to what\n\n297\n00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.360\nused to be called the classic view.\n\n298\n00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.684\nWe're gonna have to switch to the icons.\n\n299\n00:15:49.684 --> 00:15:53.341\nAnd I've got four eyes here, so I'm gonna\ngo ahead and switch to the large icons so\n\n300\n00:15:53.341 --> 00:15:54.986\nI can actually see what's going on.\n\n301\n00:15:54.986 --> 00:15:58.218\nAnd then what we're looking for\nis this Recovery option.\n\n302\n00:15:58.218 --> 00:15:59.011\nAll right, and\n\n303\n00:15:59.011 --> 00:16:03.051\nwhen we click the Recovery option you'll\nsee that we get this other list here.\n\n304\n00:16:03.051 --> 00:16:06.391\nAnd notice right at the top I've got\nthis option to Create a recovery drive.\n\n305\n00:16:06.391 --> 00:16:09.020\nSo either way you get\nthere what it's gonna do,\n\n306\n00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.540\nis it's gonna start your\nrecovery media creator.\n\n307\n00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.170\nAll right, and\nwe'll go ahead and we'll say,\n\n308\n00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:16.220\nyes to the UAC, the user account control.\n\n309\n00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:18.590\nAnd we'll go ahead and close these down.\n\n310\n00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:21.200\nAnd here's the simplistic wizard.\n\n311\n00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.301\nEven if your PC can't start, you can\nuse a recovery drive to reset it and\n\n312\n00:16:24.301 --> 00:16:25.480\ntroubleshoot problems.\n\n313\n00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:29.446\nI'm gonna go ahead and, for\nthe sake of this demonstration, so\n\n314\n00:16:29.446 --> 00:16:33.634\nit doesn't take a really long time\nto create this recovery drive and\n\n315\n00:16:33.634 --> 00:16:35.919\nwe can kind of see what it looks like.\n\n316\n00:16:35.919 --> 00:16:39.520\nI'm gonna uncheck backup system\nfiles to the recovery drive.\n\n317\n00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.890\nThis is where you need a larger drive.\n\n318\n00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:47.979\nWhen you use without the system files,\nit'll check and it'll find\n\n319\n00:16:47.979 --> 00:16:53.343\na removable media that is capable of\ndoing what a recovery drive needs.\n\n320\n00:16:53.343 --> 00:16:57.650\nAnd you can see that yes it did find one\nthat I've kind of already bookmarked as\n\n321\n00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:00.750\nrecovery, so\nI knew which one I was formatting.\n\n322\n00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:01.795\nAnd that's important.\n\n323\n00:17:01.795 --> 00:17:07.090\nNotice that it says the drive must\nbe able to hold at least 512 MB?\n\n324\n00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:09.430\nThat's just for\nthe recovery environment, all right?\n\n325\n00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:10.130\n&gt;&gt; That's the minimum.\n\n326\n00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:11.980\n&gt;&gt; And that's the minimum, absolutely.\n\n327\n00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:16.780\nBut if you put your system files on there\nit could grow to considerably larger, so\n\n328\n00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.330\njust have that in the back of your mind.\n\n329\n00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:24.033\nAnd we'll choose Next, and it gives us\nthe warning, this was why I labeled that\n\n330\n00:17:24.033 --> 00:17:27.630\ndrive, just to make sure I knew\nwhich one I was formatting.\n\n331\n00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.830\nAll right, and we'll choose Create.\n\n332\n00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:32.170\nAnd this will go through the process\nof preparing a drive, and\n\n333\n00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:33.860\nI know you can't really see it now, but\n\n334\n00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:38.530\nthe little activity light on the USB\ndrive is just going crazy right now.\n\n335\n00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:42.220\nIt'll format the drive and\nnotice it says, Copying the utilities.\n\n336\n00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.570\nAll right, we're gonna let that go ahead\nand we'll let it copy its utilities, and\n\n337\n00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:47.420\nwe'll come back and look at it.\n\n338\n00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:50.690\nBut let's switch back over to our machine\nthat we ran the system restore on,\n\n339\n00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:52.450\nwe'll see how its done.\n\n340\n00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:55.880\nWell, so far I've got a log,\nwell I don't have a log-in screen.\n\n341\n00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.124\nNow, I've got a log-in screen.\n\n342\n00:17:57.124 --> 00:18:00.350\nLooks good so far, let's go ahead and\nlog in and find out.\n\n343\n00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.450\nAll right, so we're getting logged back\ninto the machine that we just performed\n\n344\n00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:07.140\nthe system restore on.\n\n345\n00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.830\nI think I said system recovery,\nsystem restore.\n\n346\n00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:12.920\nAnd notice that it lets me know,\nsystem restore completed successfully.\n\n347\n00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.460\nThe system has been restored.\n\n348\n00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.180\nYour documents have not been affected.\n\n349\n00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:18.202\nWhat does that mean?\n\n350\n00:18:18.202 --> 00:18:22.208\nAll right, it's very important\nto understand that not only for\n\n351\n00:18:22.208 --> 00:18:24.878\nrecovery purposes, but also on the exam,\n\n352\n00:18:24.878 --> 00:18:28.680\nthat system restore only works\non the configuration files.\n\n353\n00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.380\nIt does nothing to the user data, right?\n\n354\n00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:33.580\nWe use things like back ups,\nwe use things like One Drive,\n\n355\n00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:38.370\nwe uses things like file history, in\norder to backup the users personal files.\n\n356\n00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:42.480\nSystem restore is only about\nthe configuration state,\n\n357\n00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.810\nthat's what it reverts to,\nan earlier point in time.\n\n358\n00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:50.203\nSo, does look like our system\nrestore completed successfully.\n\n359\n00:18:50.203 --> 00:18:53.520\nAll right, so\nthe next thing that we're gonna do is,\n\n360\n00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:58.740\nwe're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\nshow you another recovery technology.\n\n361\n00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:02.650\nThat recovery technology is\nsomething known as safe mode.\n\n362\n00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:03.981\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, the safe mode,\nI know this one, right.\n\n363\n00:19:03.981 --> 00:19:05.760\nEverybody's heard of the safe mode.\n\n364\n00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.860\nYou restart the computer, you crank\nout the F8 key as fast as you can.\n\n365\n00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.751\nAnd then you miss it, and you gotta\nrestart again and try again, right.\n\n366\n00:19:11.751 --> 00:19:14.989\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that would be absolutely wrong.\n\n367\n00:19:14.989 --> 00:19:16.216\n&gt;&gt; In Windows 10.\n\n368\n00:19:16.216 --> 00:19:16.823\n&gt;&gt; In Windows 10.\n\n369\n00:19:16.823 --> 00:19:19.120\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say in Windows 10,\nso I caught him.\n\n370\n00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.070\nI threw him a little curve ball there,\nright.\n\n371\n00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:24.203\nF8 is what we've been pressing for\na long time to get into\n\n372\n00:19:24.203 --> 00:19:28.593\nthe advanced startup option, so that we\ncan do things like boot into safe mode.\n\n373\n00:19:28.593 --> 00:19:30.067\nDo things like, for instance,\n\n374\n00:19:30.067 --> 00:19:33.462\nto restore your computer to what's\nknown as the last known good, right?\n\n375\n00:19:33.462 --> 00:19:37.746\nIt was the last successful\nboot that was completed\n\n376\n00:19:37.746 --> 00:19:40.910\nsuccessfully in a Windows machine.\n\n377\n00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:43.700\nAnd it saves that control set,\nthat configuration data.\n\n378\n00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.210\nSo that if you can't boot into\nyour machine, you can press F8.\n\n379\n00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:50.512\nYou boot into the advance start up options\nand you restore it to the last known good.\n\n380\n00:19:50.512 --> 00:19:54.570\nLast known good it isn't there anymore,\nand I'm gonna show you here in a second.\n\n381\n00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:59.060\nSo, safe mode is a way that we can\ntroubleshoot machines by booting into\n\n382\n00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:03.640\na mode that only loads the most\nminimalistic drivers within\n\n383\n00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:08.430\nthe operating system, just enough\nto get the operating system online.\n\n384\n00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:08.971\nAnd you know what?\n\n385\n00:20:08.971 --> 00:20:11.590\nCheck it out,\nour recovery drive is actually finished.\n\n386\n00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:14.840\nI didn't think it was gonna finish that\nfast, so we can kinda check this out.\n\n387\n00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.646\nWe'll check the recovery drive out.\n\n388\n00:20:16.646 --> 00:20:19.050\nAnd then we'll get back\ninto safe mode here.\n\n389\n00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:22.440\nSo once my recovery drive is finished,\n\n390\n00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:27.000\nI'll go ahead and\nI'm gonna inject it safely here.\n\n391\n00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.878\nI say that, if I can find the right one.\n\n392\n00:20:29.878 --> 00:20:30.399\n&gt;&gt; You can.\n\n393\n00:20:30.399 --> 00:20:32.825\n&gt;&gt; There we go, the way that we go,\nhe's on to me, he knows.\n\n394\n00:20:32.825 --> 00:20:35.954\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So once we eject this,\n\n395\n00:20:35.954 --> 00:20:40.419\nI now have a little drive that I can use,\nand\n\n396\n00:20:40.419 --> 00:20:45.520\nI can plug that into a machine,\nand there you go.\n\n397\n00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:49.190\nI've got this little thumb drive that\nnow has the recovery environment and\n\n398\n00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:52.530\nallows me to do what we're talking\nabout in booting in the safe mode.\n\n399\n00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:58.630\nNow, I can't really show you booting into\nthis recovery drive on camera, right?\n\n400\n00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:01.640\nBut one of the things that I can do\nis show you the recovery environment,\n\n401\n00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:05.280\nbecause you can also do this inside\nof the Windows Operating System.\n\n402\n00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.548\nIn fact, if we can go back\nto my Windows machine, and\n\n403\n00:21:07.548 --> 00:21:09.311\nmy heads gonna kind of cover this one up.\n\n404\n00:21:09.311 --> 00:21:12.671\nI know they put the action center\nright down here in the corner, and\n\n405\n00:21:12.671 --> 00:21:14.090\nit's kind of hard to see.\n\n406\n00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:19.240\nIf I open up action center and\nI go to All Settings, and\n\n407\n00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:24.170\nthen from All Settings,\nonce that opens up here, hopefully soon.\n\n408\n00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:28.350\nWe can go in to update and security, and\n\n409\n00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:33.670\nthen we can go down to recovery and you'll\nsee that there's a couple of options.\n\n410\n00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:37.570\nThis is the other recovery features\nthat we have inside Windows today.\n\n411\n00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:40.390\nWe have a full PC reset and\nwhat that does,\n\n412\n00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:41.780\nit gives you a couple of options here.\n\n413\n00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.450\nIt allows you to keep\nyour files if you want,\n\n414\n00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:47.660\nand then reinstall Windows,\nleaving your files safe.\n\n415\n00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:51.790\nOr it could completely format the drive\nwith your files and erase them.\n\n416\n00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:55.000\nAnd then reinstall Windows,\nand you've got a clean slate.\n\n417\n00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.260\nSo that's up to you.\n\n418\n00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:59.580\nRemember, that's what I would\nuse as a last ditch effort.\n\n419\n00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:02.130\nUse some of these processes\nthat are least intrusive.\n\n420\n00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:05.790\nIf it's somebody like Dan and I,\nright, working in the industry,\n\n421\n00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:09.310\nif we can solve it in about five,\nmaybe ten minutes we will.\n\n422\n00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:11.571\nBut for\nus having Enterprise level contracts,\n\n423\n00:22:11.571 --> 00:22:13.616\nwe just throw a new\noperating system on it.\n\n424\n00:22:13.616 --> 00:22:17.846\nAll of our computers are probably saving\ntheir files up on share somewhere.\n\n425\n00:22:17.846 --> 00:22:21.900\nIn a home network though,\nprobably not gonna be the case, right.\n\n426\n00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.902\nI know that Dan you've got kids,\nI've got kids, and\n\n427\n00:22:24.902 --> 00:22:26.988\nI can't afford to lose my pictures.\n\n428\n00:22:26.988 --> 00:22:30.942\nEvery piece of software,\nI don't care how expensive it is,\n\n429\n00:22:30.942 --> 00:22:34.055\nit might hurt a little,\nbut it can be replaced.\n\n430\n00:22:34.055 --> 00:22:36.625\nThose pictures of your family,\nyou can't replace them.\n\n431\n00:22:36.625 --> 00:22:40.705\nSo, we do understand, when we say,\nhey just blow the operating system away.\n\n432\n00:22:40.705 --> 00:22:43.125\nIn an Enterprise environment,\nthat might okay,\n\n433\n00:22:43.125 --> 00:22:45.385\nin your home environment,\nthat might not be an option.\n\n434\n00:22:45.385 --> 00:22:47.935\nSo, this reset your PC option,\n\n435\n00:22:47.935 --> 00:22:51.017\nthat we're showing here It\ncould be a little intrusive.\n\n436\n00:22:51.017 --> 00:22:53.760\nS what we're gonna do is,\nwe're gonna do advanced start up right and\n\n437\n00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.379\nwe'll go ahead and choose restart now.\n\n438\n00:22:55.379 --> 00:22:59.233\nNow while this is restarting,\nlet me let you guys know this would be no\n\n439\n00:22:59.233 --> 00:23:03.287\ndifferent than taking this thumb drive\nplugging in into the computer and\n\n440\n00:23:03.287 --> 00:23:04.961\nbooting from the USB device.\n\n441\n00:23:04.961 --> 00:23:10.290\nIt would boot us to the same console,\nit would look absolutely identical.\n\n442\n00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:14.340\nSo, what we're gonna go ahead and\ndo, is we'll let this\n\n443\n00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:18.280\nboot into the recovery environment and\nthen we'll take a look at that.\n\n444\n00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:21.810\nAll right, and this is the screen that we\nwanted, we wanted the recovery screen.\n\n445\n00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:23.190\nNow like I said,\n\n446\n00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:28.540\nif you're booting into the USB device,\nyou'd see the exact same screen.\n\n447\n00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.540\nWe could continue to Windows, if we want.\n\n448\n00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.720\nObviously, if we're in\na troubleshooting stance,\n\n449\n00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.370\nthat's probably not what we're gonna do.\n\n450\n00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:35.630\nWe could turn off the PC.\n\n451\n00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:40.440\nBut, what I really want is this\ntroubleshooting location here, and And\n\n452\n00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.130\nremember earlier when\nI said Reset this PC?\n\n453\n00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:44.522\nIt will take you to the same location.\n\n454\n00:23:44.522 --> 00:23:48.553\nSo, if we were to click this, it will take\nus through a wizard that allows us to\n\n455\n00:23:48.553 --> 00:23:51.671\nchoose what it is that we wanna keep and\nwhat we don't keep.\n\n456\n00:23:51.671 --> 00:23:54.266\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nchoose the Advance options.\n\n457\n00:23:54.266 --> 00:23:58.494\nAnd notice that we've got, well, we've\ngot a few different advanced options.\n\n458\n00:23:58.494 --> 00:24:00.817\nI could do a System Restore\nfrom this location.\n\n459\n00:24:00.817 --> 00:24:04.237\nCuz what happens if I install that\napplication, I reboot the machine,\n\n460\n00:24:04.237 --> 00:24:05.890\nit blue screens, and it crashes?\n\n461\n00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:09.098\nWell, I can't use the in-house\nsystem restore, right,\n\n462\n00:24:09.098 --> 00:24:11.380\nin the operating system restore.\n\n463\n00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.544\nI have to use it from\nthe recovery environment.\n\n464\n00:24:13.544 --> 00:24:15.670\nWe also have a recovery image.\n\n465\n00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:20.806\nIf I would have included all of the\nrecovery information in the drive itself,\n\n466\n00:24:20.806 --> 00:24:26.178\nit would create a, I believe it's one of\nthe old easy transfer migration files,\n\n467\n00:24:26.178 --> 00:24:27.930\nthat we could point it to.\n\n468\n00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:31.616\nAnd it would reimage the machine in the\nexact state it was at the point that we\n\n469\n00:24:31.616 --> 00:24:33.720\ncreated the system image.\n\n470\n00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:38.310\nStartup Repair, this is a way that we\ncan automate the process if we need to.\n\n471\n00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:41.860\nIf they try to fix things like\nyour boot files, if you will.\n\n472\n00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:44.680\nCommand Prompt gives us\naccess to the command prompt\n\n473\n00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:50.160\nto run some utilities against the hard\ndrive or go back to a previous build.\n\n474\n00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.800\nRemember that we have today,\nWindows as a Service,\n\n475\n00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.510\nnot necessarily an operating system.\n\n476\n00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:57.790\nAnd it's gonna go through several\nbuilds and it will be ongoing.\n\n477\n00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:01.130\nBut what I really want\nare the advanced startup settings.\n\n478\n00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:03.053\nRemember we talked about safe mode?\n\n479\n00:25:03.053 --> 00:25:07.365\nLet's go ahead and let's choose this and\nyou can see that it says,\n\n480\n00:25:07.365 --> 00:25:10.227\nrestart to change Windows options such as.\n\n481\n00:25:10.227 --> 00:25:12.495\nAnd you can see that we\nhave Safe Mode here,\n\n482\n00:25:12.495 --> 00:25:14.990\nDisable driver signature enforcement.\n\n483\n00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:18.419\nIn the earlier days of\nthe recovery environment,\n\n484\n00:25:18.419 --> 00:25:21.447\nyou would have that last\nknown good in here.\n\n485\n00:25:21.447 --> 00:25:25.100\nIt isn't known anymore, currently it's\nthe unknown last good or something.\n\n486\n00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:28.117\nBut they did take it out of here in favor\nof some technologies that they have today.\n\n487\n00:25:28.117 --> 00:25:31.440\n&gt;&gt; Windows 10 now has a degenerative\nbrain disease where it looses memory.\n\n488\n00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.850\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n489\n00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:36.050\nIt's sometimer, sometimes it remembers and\nsometimes it doesn't.\n\n490\n00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:37.577\nLet's go ahead and we'll choose Restart.\n\n491\n00:25:37.577 --> 00:25:42.213\nAnd yes, it's gonna restart the machine\nagain, and what we'll do is we'll\n\n492\n00:25:42.213 --> 00:25:46.150\nshow you how to get into safe mode,\nonce this actually restarts.\n\n493\n00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:47.840\nSo we'll give it a second here and\n\n494\n00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:52.980\nwhat it's gonna do is, as it's restarting,\nit's essentially going to\n\n495\n00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:58.000\nstart inside of a mode that doesn't\nhave all the drivers loaded.\n\n496\n00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.450\nIn fact, here it goes.\n\n497\n00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:03.380\nWe can see that we're on screen here,\nand it's kinda hard for me to show this.\n\n498\n00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:08.240\nAnd I do apologize ahead of time for\nthe matted lines around the outside.\n\n499\n00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:13.228\nSee, if you have only the services\nload that need to load at the time,\n\n500\n00:26:13.228 --> 00:26:17.021\nWindows typically loads\na very generic VGA driver.\n\n501\n00:26:17.021 --> 00:26:21.790\nNot the one that goes to your Radeon or\nyour GTX graphics card, right?\n\n502\n00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.660\nJust enough to get you\nlogged into the machine.\n\n503\n00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.040\nSo we're gonna choose number 4 here.\n\n504\n00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:31.510\nRemember to get into safe mode,\nyou have three options, 4, 5, and 6.\n\n505\n00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:33.210\nWith 4, that's just basic Safe Mode.\n\n506\n00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:37.745\nWith 5, it says, go ahead and\nenable the network adapter.\n\n507\n00:26:37.745 --> 00:26:42.610\n6 says, don't enable the GUI,\ndon't enable the network adapter, but\n\n508\n00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:44.510\ngo ahead and\njust throw me into the command prompt.\n\n509\n00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:46.840\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna choose 4, and\n\n510\n00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.690\nwe'll let that go ahead and boot up.\n\n511\n00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:52.020\nAnd one of the things that\nyou'll see right away is that,\n\n512\n00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:56.420\nwell, I don't get all the nice\nlittle graphics, stretch screen.\n\n513\n00:26:56.420 --> 00:27:01.244\nIt's not gonna look as pretty as it\ndoes when we are not in safe mode.\n\n514\n00:27:01.244 --> 00:27:04.926\nIn fact, you can kinda see\nthat the I've got a very,\n\n515\n00:27:04.926 --> 00:27:08.799\nalmost wanna say that this\nis probably like what is it?\n\n516\n00:27:08.799 --> 00:27:12.440\n640x480, the old VGA resolution.\n\n517\n00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:15.130\nAnd I can also see that\nthe background is different.\n\n518\n00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:18.440\nAnd I can also see that the network\nadaptor isn't turned on either.\n\n519\n00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.780\nSo it's telling me\nthe connection is limited.\n\n520\n00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:24.724\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll get logged into this, all right.\n\n521\n00:27:27.484 --> 00:27:31.329\nAnd once we get logged into this,\nyou'll see that a couple of applications,\n\n522\n00:27:31.329 --> 00:27:34.344\none of the things it says is\nGet Started can't be opened using\n\n523\n00:27:34.344 --> 00:27:36.440\nthe built-in administrative account.\n\n524\n00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.780\nThat's okay, we don't want it to run.\n\n525\n00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:41.920\nBut one of the things that I wanna\nshow you is let's go ahead and\n\n526\n00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.710\nfind out what services are running.\n\n527\n00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:48.315\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll launch Cortana here, and\n\n528\n00:27:48.315 --> 00:27:54.231\nwe'll do our services.msc to launch\nservices and we'll hit Enter.\n\n529\n00:27:54.231 --> 00:27:55.540\nAnd we'll hit Enter.\n\n530\n00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:56.820\nWell, what's going on?\n\n531\n00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.917\nWell, Cortana's asleep right now.\n\n532\n00:27:58.917 --> 00:28:02.608\nShe is not a main service\ninside of the operating system.\n\n533\n00:28:02.608 --> 00:28:04.853\nAnd I'm not saying that\nthis is Cortana's fault but\n\n534\n00:28:04.853 --> 00:28:08.324\nkeep mind when we're troubleshooting\nproblems, we don't need extra services\n\n535\n00:28:08.324 --> 00:28:12.250\nrunning that aren't essential to\nthe functionality of the operating system.\n\n536\n00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:16.030\nAnd poor Cortana, she's not essential to\nthe functionality of the operating system,\n\n537\n00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:17.350\nregardless of what some people think.\n\n538\n00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:20.859\nSo we're gonna have to drop down\nto the traditional run line.\n\n539\n00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:25.200\nAnd we'll type services.msc here.\n\n540\n00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:29.300\nAnd we'll run that and\nthat'll bring up the services console.\n\n541\n00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:33.090\nSo here's one of the reasons I say, Dan,\nsome of these old run line commands,\n\n542\n00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:36.060\na lot of times we forget them cuz we\nhave the search functionality today.\n\n543\n00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:40.017\nBut what do you think would happen if\nsomething like this happens where we don't\n\n544\n00:28:40.017 --> 00:28:41.740\nhave that search functionality?\n\n545\n00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:44.990\nSo that's why I say it's still good to\nremember those old run line options.\n\n546\n00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:47.280\nNow, let's go ahead and\nlet's kind of dig down into here.\n\n547\n00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.620\nLet's make this a little easier.\n\n548\n00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:51.180\nNotice we got the status option here and\n\n549\n00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:55.700\nI'm gonna basically cycle these or\nfilter these by the ones that are running.\n\n550\n00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:59.690\nThere's not a lot here,\nnotice that not much is running here.\n\n551\n00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:03.536\nWe've got things like\nthe Windows Defender Service, of course,\n\n552\n00:29:03.536 --> 00:29:07.040\nit's malware protection,\nwe need that running.\n\n553\n00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:13.992\nLet's see, let's just take a look\nat something in here, any one.\n\n554\n00:29:13.992 --> 00:29:16.960\nOkay, I'll tell you what,\nwe'll do Remote Procedure Call, right?\n\n555\n00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.890\nThis is a very important service.\n\n556\n00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:23.300\nAnd you can see just about half of\nthe entire operating system depends on it.\n\n557\n00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:25.110\nSo it's essential, right?\n\n558\n00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:28.210\nBut let's take something like,\nwe'll do a little filtering here.\n\n559\n00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:32.090\nLet's filter this, and\nlet's look for, Print Spooler, right?\n\n560\n00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:34.510\nNotice the Print Spooler,\nnotice how it stopped.\n\n561\n00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:38.569\nHowever, the startup type is automatic.\n\n562\n00:29:38.569 --> 00:29:41.920\nAnd when the startup type is automatic\nthat means the moment the operating\n\n563\n00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.210\nsystem starts,\nthe Print Spooler should start.\n\n564\n00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:47.030\nWell, remember it's not\nan essential service, so\n\n565\n00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:49.660\nSafe Mode doesn't allow us to start it.\n\n566\n00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:51.680\nNow this is where we can do\nthings like troubleshoot,\n\n567\n00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.950\nwe can uninstall drivers if we need to.\n\n568\n00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:57.749\nWe can also do things like system restores\nfrom here in safe mode to troubleshoot\n\n569\n00:29:57.749 --> 00:29:58.320\nproblems.\n\n570\n00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.300\nSo that's how you get into safe mode.\n\n571\n00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:03.882\nUnderstand that it's a very,\nvery important thing to have.\n\n572\n00:30:03.882 --> 00:30:06.782\nIt's important for the exam,\nit's important for the real life.\n\n573\n00:30:06.782 --> 00:30:10.116\nNow Dan, I know,\nI know we've got some more things to go.\n\n574\n00:30:10.116 --> 00:30:11.510\nBut Dan's letting me know over here,\n\n575\n00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:13.540\nI think I've talked a little\ntoo much on this one.\n\n576\n00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:14.684\n&gt;&gt; He's such a talker,\n\n577\n00:30:14.684 --> 00:30:17.743\nI bet he was separated from\nthe other children at school.\n\n578\n00:30:17.743 --> 00:30:19.075\nHe just loves to run his little mouth.\n\n579\n00:30:19.075 --> 00:30:22.240\nBut there's a good reason for\nthat today, which is why we hired him.\n\n580\n00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:26.068\nBecause we need him to have that gift\nof gab to talk about these awesome\n\n581\n00:30:26.068 --> 00:30:30.231\nfeatures inside of Windows 10 and\nthe Windows operating system for you.\n\n582\n00:30:30.231 --> 00:30:34.580\nSo that you can go pass an exam and\nbecome a technician in IT.\n\n583\n00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:37.120\nThat being said, Wes you are absolutely\ncorrect, we are out of time for\n\n584\n00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:37.740\nthis episode.\n\n585\n00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:40.980\nWe do thank you for joining us, and\nwe thank our viewers for watching.\n\n586\n00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:42.376\nCome back, there's gonna be a part two.\n\n587\n00:30:42.376 --> 00:30:45.168\nWe have yet to even touch updates,\nand things of that nature, so\n\n588\n00:30:45.168 --> 00:30:46.740\ndefinitely check that out.\n\n589\n00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:50.323\nBut we'll be back, as for this episode,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off for\n\n590\n00:30:50.323 --> 00:30:50.823\nITProTV.\n\n591\n00:30:50.823 --> 00:30:52.041\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n592\n00:30:52.041 --> 00:30:53.135\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n593\n00:30:53.135 --> 00:30:54.097\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n594\n00:30:54.097 -->

00:00:25.866\nwith our 98-349 MTA series.\n\n9\n00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.530\nComing back in the studio, of course,\n\n10\n00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.590\nit would be like a day without\nsunshine if we didn't have him here.\n\n11\n00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.551\nCuz he is the master of those MTAs,\nour good friend, Mr Wes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:33.551 --> 00:00:35.950\nAnd Wes, welcome back again my friend.\n\n13\n00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.300\nSo glad to have you yet again.\n\n14\n00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.110\n&gt;&gt; I appreciate being here, that's right,\nwe've got a part 2 because well,\n\n15\n00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.060\nit's Dan fault.\n\n16\n00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.091\nHe's the one that let me talk too\nmuch [LAUGH] in the first part.\n\n17\n00:00:44.091 --> 00:00:48.157\nWe do have a couple other things that we\nwanna kinda wrap up here when it comes to\n\n18\n00:00:48.157 --> 00:00:49.920\nbackup, recovery and updates.\n\n19\n00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.395\nSpecifically, talking about recovery\nof our files, and then, ultimately,\n\n20\n00:00:54.395 --> 00:00:55.550\nour updates.\n\n21\n00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.840\nOne of the things that I\ndo want kinda to jump back.\n\n22\n00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.399\nIn the first part, we talked about\nvarious concepts like system restore,\n\n23\n00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.838\ncreating a recovery drive,\nbooting in safe mode.\n\n24\n00:01:03.838 --> 00:01:06.941\nAnd we showed you some of the most\nadvanced recovery options that you can\n\n25\n00:01:06.941 --> 00:01:10.680\nboot into inside of either the recovery\ndrive or your operating system.\n\n26\n00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.000\nHowever, one of the things\nthat I didn't show you, and\n\n27\n00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.120\nI wanna kinda just recap here real quick,\n\n28\n00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.910\nis what happens to safe mode once\nyou've chosen it and when you restart.\n\n29\n00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.530\nSo if we could take\na look at my screen here.\n\n30\n00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.520\nGuys, I've got this set up the same\nway we did when we left off here,\n\n31\n00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.700\nyou can see we are still in safe mode.\n\n32\n00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.124\nNow one of the great things about being\nin safe mode, if you launch it from\n\n33\n00:01:35.124 --> 00:01:39.055\nthe recovery environment, whether it'll\nbe the recovery drive that you create or\n\n34\n00:01:39.055 --> 00:01:40.645\ninside of the operating system.\n\n35\n00:01:40.645 --> 00:01:45.092\nIf I wanna get out of safe mode,\nall I gotta do is reboot the machine and\n\n36\n00:01:45.092 --> 00:01:47.408\nit will boot the machine normally.\n\n37\n00:01:47.408 --> 00:01:50.383\nUnless I boot back into\nthe recovery options,\n\n38\n00:01:50.383 --> 00:01:53.068\nthen we can always select it again.\n\n39\n00:01:53.068 --> 00:01:58.311\nI also wanna make sure that you\nrealize that if I decided to I can\n\n40\n00:01:58.311 --> 00:02:04.520\nkind of force a safe boot by\ndropping down to our run line and\n\n41\n00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.490\nlaunching up a configuration\nutility called msconfig.\n\n42\n00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.930\nThis is our system configuration\nutility and if I choose to,\n\n43\n00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.370\nI can launch into, let me see how\ngood way that place to put that.\n\n44\n00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.106\nI can launch into what's known as,\nwell a safe boot.\n\n45\n00:02:21.106 --> 00:02:26.200\nAll right, now the terms are a little\nbit different guys, but this essentially\n\n46\n00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.948\nif I check this, I can pick what\nkind of safe mode I wanna boot into.\n\n47\n00:02:30.948 --> 00:02:33.687\nMinimalistic, that's gonna be\njust those minimal drivers and\n\n48\n00:02:33.687 --> 00:02:36.831\nservices that you need to get the\noperating system running just you can say\n\n49\n00:02:36.831 --> 00:02:39.230\nthat's running in the background\nin our safe mode now.\n\n50\n00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.050\nAs well as things like an alternate shell.\n\n51\n00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.850\nAlternate shell would be\nthe command prompt, and\n\n52\n00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.360\nif we were doing Active Directory Repair.\n\n53\n00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.810\nBut then the last one,\ntoo, would be a minimal,\n\n54\n00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.310\nbut also enabling the network adaptor,\ntoo.\n\n55\n00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.780\nSo if we needed to do some troubleshooting\nthat required outbound communications,\n\n56\n00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.140\nwe could perform those as well.\n\n57\n00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.070\nSo I did wanna make mention of that.\n\n58\n00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.150\nI will tell you, though,\n\n59\n00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.505\none of the big differences here,\nis that this is persistent.\n\n60\n00:03:03.505 --> 00:03:09.580\nAnd if I check this box right here and\nrestart the machine, every time\n\n61\n00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.640\nI restart the machine until I change this,\nit's going to keep booting into safe mode.\n\n62\n00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.370\nSo I'll go ahead and just cancel that.\n\n63\n00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.160\nAnd then, just wanted to let you know,\n\n64\n00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.280\nit would be as simple as\nrestarting the machine.\n\n65\n00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.460\nAnd we could log into it normally,\nthe normal boot process,\n\n66\n00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.400\nall the drivers load back up,\nall of the services.\n\n67\n00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.560\nEven the ones that aren't\ncritical to operation, or\n\n68\n00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.040\noperating system functionality.\n\n69\n00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.520\nSuch as, for instance, your principal,\nor we see it in the first part of\n\n70\n00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.010\nthis episode, that print spooler isn't\nenabled because it's not one of these\n\n71\n00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.240\nservices that is important when it\ncomes to critical functionality.\n\n72\n00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.450\nAnd then, it's just a simple\nmatter of logging back in.\n\n73\n00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.030\nWe get logged back in and\n\n74\n00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.310\nwhat you should see is that we have our\nnormal everyday run them on desktop.\n\n75\n00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.052\nSo not too difficult to get out of safe\nmode it's one the things that I didn't\n\n76\n00:04:04.052 --> 00:04:05.936\nmention [LAUGH] and I do wanna mention.\n\n77\n00:04:05.936 --> 00:04:09.449\nIf you use MSConfig, just keep in mind\nthat when you reboot the machine,\n\n78\n00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.630\nyou have to uncheck that safe boot.\n\n79\n00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.907\nBecause if you don't, it's gonna\npersistently reboot into safe mode and\n\n80\n00:04:14.907 --> 00:04:17.352\nI wouldn't want that to happen\nto you guys and say well,\n\n81\n00:04:17.352 --> 00:04:20.212\nhe showed us how to get out of there,\nor showed us how to get there,\n\n82\n00:04:20.212 --> 00:04:22.630\nbut he didn't show us [LAUGH]\nhow to get out of that menu.\n\n83\n00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.166\nCould cause a problem, so-\n&gt;&gt; Important safety tip from Wes Bryan.\n\n84\n00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:26.044\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n85\n00:04:26.044 --> 00:04:28.050\n[LAUGH] So\nwe just wanna remind you of that and\n\n86\n00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.920\nmake sure that that doesn't happen to you.\n\n87\n00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.145\nNow, the other thing that they call\nout is file recovery from OneDrive.\n\n88\n00:04:34.145 --> 00:04:37.060\nOneDrive is actually\na pretty cool utility, but\n\n89\n00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.890\nit does require having\na Microsoft account.\n\n90\n00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.150\nSo how do we use it?\n\n91\n00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.350\nWell, one of the first things you have\nto do is, you have to go to Microsoft,\n\n92\n00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.040\nit used to be the old Windows Live.\n\n93\n00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.450\nJust go up to Microsoft, say that you\nwant one of the Microsoft accounts,\n\n94\n00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.500\nyou'll register,\nyou'll fill out a form and everything.\n\n95\n00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.040\nThey'll give you a password, username and\n\n96\n00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.300\npassword, you can even use Outlook,\nwhich is what I've used here.\n\n97\n00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.160\nOnce you have that account set,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n98\n00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.570\nshow you how you can use it to\nget the benefits of OneDrive.\n\n99\n00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.167\nSo on my Windows 10 machine here if I go\ndown to the Action Center, keep in mind\n\n100\n00:05:09.167 --> 00:05:12.620\nI know my [LAUGH] head's been covering\nit up pretty much this whole episode.\n\n101\n00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.860\nSo little Action Center icon right there.\n\n102\n00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.370\nIf we choose that then all settings.\n\n103\n00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.500\nAnd the one that I'm really looking at\nright now is the Accounts option here.\n\n104\n00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.880\nAnd if we go into Accounts\nyou'll see that it by default,\n\n105\n00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.110\nit starts here with your info.\n\n106\n00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.211\nWhat's important for\nus if we wanna use OneDrive and\n\n107\n00:05:32.211 --> 00:05:36.227\nsome of the other features like\nthe Windows Store, is to go ahead and\n\n108\n00:05:36.227 --> 00:05:38.990\nsign in with your\nMicrosoft account instead.\n\n109\n00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.611\nAnd that's what we want here if\nwe're gonna use OneDrive and\n\n110\n00:05:42.611 --> 00:05:45.310\nintegrate it into our Windows environment.\n\n111\n00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.660\nSo let me go ahead and\nI'll get logged in here.\n\n112\n00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.310\nAnd once we get logged in, we'll go ahead\nand show you some of the benefits that you\n\n113\n00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:01.910\nget when you are using OneDrive,\nwith their Windows 10 machines.\n\n114\n00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.000\nAll right, so\nhopefully I typed the password in right.\n\n115\n00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.130\nOne of the things that it'll let you know\nif you've typed the password incorrectly,\n\n116\n00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.680\nand I do mean type it in correctly.\n\n117\n00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.554\nGotta make sure that we got that.\n\n118\n00:06:15.554 --> 00:06:16.709\n&gt;&gt; Not incorrectly.\n&gt;&gt; Not incorrectly or\n\n119\n00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:18.530\nit'll never give you the security.\n\n120\n00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.380\nSo if you typed it right,\n[LAUGH] essentially,\n\n121\n00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.760\nyou like that a little bit\nof better recollection?\n\n122\n00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.910\nThen, what we'll get is\nit'll prompt you for\n\n123\n00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.900\nyour current local\nadministrative password.\n\n124\n00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.580\nCuz you have to be a local\nadministrator on the machine,\n\n125\n00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.910\nin order to associate your\nMicrosoft to count with it.\n\n126\n00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:35.810\nSo we'll go ahead, and\n\n127\n00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.070\nwe'll type in the local\nadministrative account password here.\n\n128\n00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.840\nAnd it's gonna say please wait.\n\n129\n00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.020\nAnd then,\nit should get us logged into the machine.\n\n130\n00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:51.100\nNow, this is where you can set up your\nWindows Hello if you've got your camera,\n\n131\n00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.030\nbiometrics, if you wanna implement a PIN.\n\n132\n00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.203\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nsay, skip this set,\n\n133\n00:06:55.203 --> 00:06:57.379\nbecause this really isn't\nabout the security.\n\n134\n00:06:57.379 --> 00:07:00.677\nNow, my heads covering it up again,\nand once you get signed in,\n\n135\n00:07:00.677 --> 00:07:03.978\nthe first thing you're gonna notice\nhere down on the lower right\n\n136\n00:07:03.978 --> 00:07:07.360\nhand corner of the screen is that\nyou have this little cloud icon.\n\n137\n00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.275\nAnd if I right-click on it you can see\nthat we have the ability to open your\n\n138\n00:07:12.275 --> 00:07:18.120\nOneDrive folder, view online, upgrade if\nyou want a little bit greater storage.\n\n139\n00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.080\nAnd then, some of the individual settings.\n\n140\n00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.480\nI can also do things like view online and\nit'll open up.\n\n141\n00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:29.630\nOur Microsoft Edge and it'll connect\nto the one drive website interface.\n\n142\n00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.610\nWe'll go ahead and\nwe'll let that launch up.\n\n143\n00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:36.410\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nopen my one drive folder.\n\n144\n00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.800\nNow, when I do this, understand that\nthis is gonna launch file explore.\n\n145\n00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.530\nI can do this the same way guys.\n\n146\n00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.020\nA few different ways, same location.\n\n147\n00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:49.880\nIf I wanted to, down here on the taskbar I\ncan just choose the File Explorer button.\n\n148\n00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.461\nAnd then, over here in the tree,\nthe hierarchy,\n\n149\n00:07:52.461 --> 00:07:55.971\nthe hierarchical pane on the left-hand\nside, I can see OneDrive.\n\n150\n00:07:55.971 --> 00:07:59.811\nAnd I can see that I am connected Cuz I\nhave these green check marks like we've\n\n151\n00:07:59.811 --> 00:08:02.451\nseen in things like establishing\nthe sync center and\n\n152\n00:08:02.451 --> 00:08:05.230\nwhether synchronization has happened.\n\n153\n00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.050\nGives me the ability that if I want,\n\n154\n00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:11.590\nyou'll notice that your right-click\noptions now include a section there for\n\n155\n00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.110\nviewing online and\nsynchronizing with OneDrive.\n\n156\n00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:15.780\nSo it does add that.\n\n157\n00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.802\nYou also have some options over\nhere that you can right-click onto.\n\n158\n00:08:18.802 --> 00:08:24.090\nAnd again, View online, and you can\nsynchronize your folders to OneDrive.\n\n159\n00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:29.040\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nnow we've got OneDrive open.\n\n160\n00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.560\nWe've got it online as well, right?\n\n161\n00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.830\nAnd we've got it locally.\n\n162\n00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.439\nLet me go ahead, and\nwhat I'll do is I'll create a file.\n\n163\n00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:44.690\nAll right, and\nwe'll call this super important file.\n\n164\n00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.942\nAnd Dan I don't know if you\npicked up on that man but\n\n165\n00:08:47.942 --> 00:08:50.194\nby the time I got that thing named.\n\n166\n00:08:50.194 --> 00:08:50.950\n&gt;&gt; It was already syncing.\n\n167\n00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:52.350\n&gt;&gt; It was already there ready to go.\n\n168\n00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:53.482\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So you can see, and\n\n169\n00:08:53.482 --> 00:08:56.319\nit just takes a second,\nthis is updating in real time.\n\n170\n00:08:56.319 --> 00:09:00.161\nAnd I have to say I'm fairly impressed\nwith the infrastructure that Microsoft,\n\n171\n00:09:00.161 --> 00:09:02.317\nwe got a lot of cloud\ntechnologies out there.\n\n172\n00:09:02.317 --> 00:09:04.650\nAnd I'm always impressed by\nthe different vendors that we have.\n\n173\n00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:06.140\nBut we're in Microsoft land here.\n\n174\n00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.690\nIs how fast that updated.\n\n175\n00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:10.830\n&gt;&gt; Not unless you talked\nabout losing pictures and\n\n176\n00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.380\nthings of that nature that\nare stored on our computers.\n\n177\n00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.130\nIs this a more viable solution as\n\n178\n00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:20.670\nnot maybe a backup technically but\nit is being stored in a cloud?\n\n179\n00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:22.469\nMicrosoft is backing that stuff up.\n\n180\n00:09:22.469 --> 00:09:26.912\nThey guarantee that space in your\nfiles will be there to a certain level\n\n181\n00:09:26.912 --> 00:09:27.900\nof agreement.\n\n182\n00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.210\nIs this a good place for\n\n183\n00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.740\nus to be storing all these files\ninstead of our local drive?\n\n184\n00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.010\n&gt;&gt; I would say absolutely.\n\n185\n00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.920\nI have little routine that I follow.\n\n186\n00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.560\nI store it in three different locations.\n\n187\n00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.724\nLike my photos cuz I can't\nafford to lose them.\n\n188\n00:09:40.724 --> 00:09:44.650\nOne in the cloud, one on the local\nmachine, and one on a backup drive.\n\n189\n00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:48.084\nSo absolutely I use this and\nI would consider using this especially for\n\n190\n00:09:48.084 --> 00:09:50.700\nfiles that you just can't afford to lose.\n\n191\n00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.170\nNow, well what do you mean by that?\n\n192\n00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:53.363\nLet me go ahead and\nminimize some of these.\n\n193\n00:09:53.363 --> 00:09:59.753\nWe'll leave Edge minimized there, we'll go\nahead and close down the other interfaces.\n\n194\n00:09:59.753 --> 00:10:04.630\nAnd what I wanna do is I wanna go ahead, I\nwanna simulate losing access to that file.\n\n195\n00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:09.250\nSo let me go ahead and delete this, but\nnotice it's still here in the recycle bin.\n\n196\n00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.260\nThat's not what I want guys.\n\n197\n00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.100\nI wanna go ahead and\nI wanna empty the recycle bin, and\n\n198\n00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.710\nnow I have lost that file.\n\n199\n00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:17.840\nOr have I?\n\n200\n00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.094\nWell let's go ahead, and let's go back\nto our recent files inside of OneDrive.\n\n201\n00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:23.860\nAnd unfortunately it's gone.\n\n202\n00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:26.790\nOkay, so maybe it's in our recent files.\n\n203\n00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:29.390\nWe'd choose this little ellipse button or\nsetting button, right,\n\n204\n00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:30.620\nwe'll go into recent files.\n\n205\n00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.530\nAnd it's gone, all right,\nthat's a problem right?\n\n206\n00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:35.710\n&gt;&gt; It syncs the deletion.\n\n207\n00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:37.660\n&gt;&gt; That's right, very good.\n\n208\n00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:41.570\nDan caught it right, so\nif I go to the Recycle bin,\n\n209\n00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.890\nyou'll notice that I have, well,\na couple super important files.\n\n210\n00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:47.710\nIn fact,\none that I was testing with yesterday.\n\n211\n00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:49.860\nSo if I wanted to,\nI can actually restore this one.\n\n212\n00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.780\nAnd it's great because I can see\ndetails if I right click on it.\n\n213\n00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:56.480\nYou'll see I could do a delete or\nI can do a restoration.\n\n214\n00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.630\nI can even choose the details as\nwell if I wanna find out, well,\n\n215\n00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:02.240\nis this the file that I wanted?\n\n216\n00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.310\nSee what time it's deleted.\n\n217\n00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:05.140\nWhat the name it was.\n\n218\n00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.500\nEven what it's original location is and\n\n219\n00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.340\nI know my head's kind of covering I'm\ngoing to move that a little bit there.\n\n220\n00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:10.960\nWe got OneDrive.\n\n221\n00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.580\nIt tells me where this was deleted from.\n\n222\n00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:17.330\nSo if I choose to,\nI can always right click on this.\n\n223\n00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.250\nIn fact, let me use this one right here.\n\n224\n00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:21.280\nRight click on this one and\nI'll choose restore.\n\n225\n00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:27.417\nAnd we will go back to our OneDrive\nin our local file explorer and\n\n226\n00:11:27.417 --> 00:11:29.479\nnotice that that file is back.\n\n227\n00:11:29.479 --> 00:11:33.660\nThat's one of the benefits of having\nyour Microsoft account logged into your\n\n228\n00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:36.180\nmachine and\nutilizing the power of OneDrive.\n\n229\n00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:40.149\nBecause of the fact that if\nI do lose a file locally,\n\n230\n00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.020\nI should be able to have the ability\nto log in to the web interface,\n\n231\n00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:48.120\nsee the Recycle Bin and\nthat goes for any device.\n\n232\n00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.220\nLet me point out one thing\nin a recovery site here.\n\n233\n00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:56.170\nYou can have more than one PC that's\nassociated with your Microsoft account and\n\n234\n00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:57.960\nI can see I've got quite a few.\n\n235\n00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.500\nSo the interesting thing is,\nit doesn't work on just a single device,\n\n236\n00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.720\nit works on multiple devices.\n\n237\n00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:06.702\n&gt;&gt; We'll ask a quick question that comes\nout of our chatroom, which seems to be\n\n238\n00:12:06.702 --> 00:12:10.933\nkind of the reverse of that, is can I have\none PC or one OneDrive account, I should\n\n239\n00:12:10.933 --> 00:12:15.255\nsay, with multiple accounts, Microsoft\naccounts, accessing that OneDrive?\n\n240\n00:12:15.255 --> 00:12:18.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you should be able to associate.\n\n241\n00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:21.720\nKeep in mind that you have to be\na local administrator to use that.\n\n242\n00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.545\nIn fact, the owner here,\nhe has his children and he's had,\n\n243\n00:12:25.545 --> 00:12:30.345\nI've seen one tablet that he brought in\nthat every single one of the accounts\n\n244\n00:12:30.345 --> 00:12:32.608\nhad an at symbol, the domain edit.\n\n245\n00:12:32.608 --> 00:12:34.590\nSo you can see every single one of them.\n\n246\n00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:39.200\nHe was managing the devices in Office\n365 for his children as well, so\n\n247\n00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.550\nit's a great thing.\n\n248\n00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:44.102\nThen on top of that you can set up\nthings like family restrictions and\n\n249\n00:12:44.102 --> 00:12:45.630\nfamily monitoring.\n\n250\n00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:49.540\nSo you can actually monitor a child's\nactivity from the web interface as well,\n\n251\n00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.520\nsaying what hours daily we're\nlogged into the machine.\n\n252\n00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:56.480\nWhat pages were they viewing and\neven enforce things like\n\n253\n00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.660\ndifferent restrictions that you\ncan push out to your devices.\n\n254\n00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:02.660\nSo it's a great thing to have access to.\n\n255\n00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:05.270\nNow the other thing that you might wanna\ndo is you might wanna do something like,\n\n256\n00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:07.360\nfor instance, managing your updates.\n\n257\n00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:15.080\nAnd keep in mind that in an environment\nwhere you have corporate devices,\n\n258\n00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:20.980\na lot of times what you're gonna have is\nyour gonna have devices that are managed\n\n259\n00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:25.990\ninternally by a patch management system\nlike for instance, something like WSUS.\n\n260\n00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:30.980\nHowever, in a home environment, you might\nneed to manage these yourself locally too.\n\n261\n00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:35.650\nSo, we're gonna show you how you can\ninteract and manage your Windows updates.\n\n262\n00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:39.770\nSo, let's go ahead and we'll go back\nto the same machine that I was just at.\n\n263\n00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:44.480\nAll right, and we're gonna go ahead, and\nI'm go ahead and close all of these tabs.\n\n264\n00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.600\nWe'll close down File Explorer and\nI'm gonna go back to the action center.\n\n265\n00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:51.140\nAnd I'm gonna choose all settings here.\n\n266\n00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:55.260\nAnd what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna look at, well the update and\n\n267\n00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.600\nsecurity option, all right.\n\n268\n00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.870\nWhen I get into Windows update,\nyou can see a couple of things here.\n\n269\n00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.610\nNotice that it tells me that\nmy device is up to date.\n\n270\n00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:06.587\nLast time it checked,\nwell it was a few minutes ago, right?\n\n271\n00:14:06.587 --> 00:14:10.330\nIt's been during this show\nthat it's actually checked.\n\n272\n00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:14.540\nAnd if I wanted to, I could force\nWindows to check its updates, right?\n\n273\n00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.870\nI can also do things like\nviewing the update history.\n\n274\n00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:20.650\nAnd this is really, really good because\nwe can do things like, for instance,\n\n275\n00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:22.120\nwe can uninstall our updates.\n\n276\n00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.960\nRemember one of the things I told you\nthat you might install and update and\n\n277\n00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.450\nit causes problems?\n\n278\n00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:30.210\nWell right here from the Update History, I\ncan launch into that recovery console if I\n\n279\n00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:32.580\nwant and\nI can use my Advanced startup option.\n\n280\n00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:38.810\nSo nice inter,\nmixed in where you can mix and\n\n281\n00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:42.620\nmingle with the recovery options as well\nas part of your patch management solution.\n\n282\n00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:48.150\nNotice that if I wanna see what hass\nalready been installed I can do that, and\n\n283\n00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:49.250\nif I'm not sure.\n\n284\n00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:54.280\nWhat is this cumulative update for\nWindows 10 version 1607?\n\n285\n00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.340\nWell, you can choose\nthis little task link and\n\n286\n00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:59.230\nwhen you do it kinda gives\nyou some information.\n\n287\n00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:00.490\nWhat is this about?\n\n288\n00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:04.630\nWell install this update to\nresolve issues for Windows.\n\n289\n00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:06.600\nYou can see that you can get\nthe information about it.\n\n290\n00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:10.190\nIf you want more detailed information,\nit'll take you up to Microsoft's knowledge\n\n291\n00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:13.990\nbase where this knowledge base has\nbeen documented and recorded and\n\n292\n00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:19.830\nyou can get a lot greater detail,\nall right, if you so choose.\n\n293\n00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:26.620\nAll right, so that is a little\nbit about our Windows updates.\n\n294\n00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:30.529\nCouple of the other cool things that you\ncan do is well, you can do things for\n\n295\n00:15:30.529 --> 00:15:34.082\ninstance you can say, well what\nare the active hours of my machine?\n\n296\n00:15:34.082 --> 00:15:38.087\nAnd if you like us here, you are working\nfrom 8:00 PM to 5:00 PM right,\n\n297\n00:15:38.087 --> 00:15:41.609\nI don't want my machine to automatically\nstart restarting right and\n\n298\n00:15:41.609 --> 00:15:43.446\nthen update my machine so I can say.\n\n299\n00:15:43.446 --> 00:15:48.168\nThese are the active hours, right, and\nthey'll restart outside of this time.\n\n300\n00:15:48.168 --> 00:15:49.621\n&gt;&gt; You don't like to be surprised?\n\n301\n00:15:49.621 --> 00:15:52.610\n&gt;&gt; No, no, that's right,\nno curve balls here.\n\n302\n00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:54.549\nSo I'll go ahead I'll\nchoose cancel to this.\n\n303\n00:15:54.549 --> 00:15:59.030\nThen we also have some of\nthe advanced options, all right.\n\n304\n00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:02.750\nAnd the advanced options we have are what\nif I have other Microsoft products?\n\n305\n00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.860\nMaybe I've got Office 365 or\n\n306\n00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.305\nlocal installation of Office\ninstalled on this machine.\n\n307\n00:16:07.305 --> 00:16:09.205\nAnd I wanna get updates with that as well.\n\n308\n00:16:09.205 --> 00:16:10.685\nWell, we can do that.\n\n309\n00:16:10.685 --> 00:16:11.465\nNotice it says,\n\n310\n00:16:11.465 --> 00:16:14.975\nuse my sign in information automatically\nto finish setting up my device.\n\n311\n00:16:14.975 --> 00:16:18.635\nNow for you that might be\na bit of a privacy concern.\n\n312\n00:16:18.635 --> 00:16:19.395\nWell, that's okay.\n\n313\n00:16:20.425 --> 00:16:22.580\nYou have a privacy statement here too.\n\n314\n00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:27.555\nAnd you can also get granular on\nthe information that Microsoft is\n\n315\n00:16:27.555 --> 00:16:29.260\ngonna use in order to perform the updates.\n\n316\n00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.590\nFor instance, your privacy settings here,\nand you can go through and\n\n317\n00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:34.610\nyou can adjust the privacy\noptions as well.\n\n318\n00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:42.990\nNow, what's interesting is they also\ntalk about on your exam, they talk about\n\n319\n00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:47.750\nservicing things like the Windows Insider\npreview, they talk about current branch,\n\n320\n00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:51.810\ncurrent branch for business, and something\nknown as long term service branching.\n\n321\n00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:56.000\nKeep in mind that today, Windows has a\ndifferent kind of servicing model, right?\n\n322\n00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.410\nWindows today is considered\nWindows as a service, so\n\n323\n00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:03.520\nit's going to constantly be going\nthrough updates and upgrades.\n\n324\n00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.810\nHowever, that's not always good for\nbusiness, right.\n\n325\n00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:10.540\nSome of the other operating systems that\nyou see that are inside of businesses\n\n326\n00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:14.510\nare usually a couple of versions behind\ncertain technology because it's tried and\n\n327\n00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:16.230\ntrue, we know it's stable.\n\n328\n00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:22.140\nWell if that is what you want,\nthen when you get a release to market\n\n329\n00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.780\nversion of Windows you have what's\nknown as the current branch, all right.\n\n330\n00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:29.000\nThe current branch means when\nthe features are released to the public,\n\n331\n00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.730\nthey are gonna be pushed out\nto the operating system.\n\n332\n00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:38.420\nHowever, in a business environment,\nyou might want to delay the inclusion\n\n333\n00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:43.100\nof those features before your company\nhas had a chance to test them.\n\n334\n00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:46.670\nSo you can do what's known as current\nbranch for business or sometimes just\n\n335\n00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:51.140\nabbreviated CB for current branch,\nCBB for current branch for business.\n\n336\n00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:51.980\nWell what's that deferment?\n\n337\n00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.660\nLet me go ahead and show you right here.\n\n338\n00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:58.340\nWhen you turn on Defer feature updates,\nyou've essentially switched from\n\n339\n00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:01.030\ncurrent branch to what's known as\ncurrent branch for business and\n\n340\n00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:05.540\nyou're saying, give me well\nessentially up to about a maximum\n\n341\n00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:09.430\nof 180 days before I have\nto install these features.\n\n342\n00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:14.460\nHowever, you might have specialty\ndevices that you don't want to upgrade\n\n343\n00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:15.160\never, right?\n\n344\n00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.850\nThat's long term service branching,\n\n345\n00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:20.200\nit doesn't include things like the Windows\nstore, it doesn't include Cortana.\n\n346\n00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:25.430\nAnd this is for specialty devices\nthat we need to remain stable,\n\n347\n00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:28.510\nsecure and we don't want any\nupdates hitting them at all.\n\n348\n00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:30.280\nThat'll be the long term\nserver's branching.\n\n349\n00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:36.500\nThe other one that we have is a what\nis known as the insider preview.\n\n350\n00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:39.450\nNow insider preview also\nmeans that you have to\n\n351\n00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:41.550\nsign in with your Microsoft account.\n\n352\n00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:43.800\nAnd let me show you where that is.\n\n353\n00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.430\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and\n\n354\n00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:50.020\nwe'll go back to the main action\ncenter screen or Window settings.\n\n355\n00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.130\nThis is also under Update &amp; security.\n\n356\n00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:55.560\nSome of you guys that are paying attention\nout there probably already seen it.\n\n357\n00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.910\nAll right, and\nthen we have this Windows insider program.\n\n358\n00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:03.060\nThis means if you want the bleeding edge,\nyou can get the bleeding edge and\n\n359\n00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:06.450\nyou can determine how new\nthe features are that you want.\n\n360\n00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:09.500\nDo you want them before they're\neven tested for stability?\n\n361\n00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.140\nDo you want the latest and greatest?\n\n362\n00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:14.560\nWell, that's where\nInsider program comes in.\n\n363\n00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.490\nSo, we'll go ahead and click that.\n\n364\n00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:20.130\nNow, this does require\nyou to be registered, so\n\n365\n00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:24.630\nif you have a Microsoft account and\nyou log in with your Microsoft account.\n\n366\n00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:25.800\nYou still need to register.\n\n367\n00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.520\nAnd what happens is when you\nclick this Get started button\n\n368\n00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.930\nit's gonna give you another screen,\nright here.\n\n369\n00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:36.480\nAnd this screen might be a little bit\ndifferent from yours the first time.\n\n370\n00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.720\nIt might have a register option.\n\n371\n00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.220\nAnd all that does guys, is that just\nsays take that Microsoft account,\n\n372\n00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:45.740\nreach out to Microsoft, so that it\nregisters, and we now know that it needs,\n\n373\n00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:49.450\nthat you wanna be part of\nthe insider preview program.\n\n374\n00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:51.090\nYou're still gonna turn around and\n\n375\n00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:54.150\ncome right back to here after that\nregistration process is done.\n\n376\n00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:56.530\nAnd you'll chose Get started.\n\n377\n00:19:56.530 --> 00:20:00.460\nAnd when you do that,\nnow you'll see this screen here.\n\n378\n00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.080\nBut notice, you have to be careful.\n\n379\n00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:05.500\nIf you know your way around the PC,\nyou wanna try out pre-released,\n\n380\n00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.230\nyou don't mind frequent updates, and\n\n381\n00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:09.580\nyou aren't installing it on\nyour primary computer, right?\n\n382\n00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:13.340\nThis is not to be taken lightly,\ncuz it could cause some issues.\n\n383\n00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.660\nSo we'll go ahead and we'll choose Next.\n\n384\n00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:21.280\nAnd then it says, keep in mind that if you\never wanna stop receiving insider preview\n\n385\n00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:27.180\nbuilds, you may need to remove everything\nfrom your PC and reinstall Windows.\n\n386\n00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:28.170\nDon't take this lightly.\n\n387\n00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:29.130\n&gt;&gt; That's a big commitment.\n\n388\n00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:29.940\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n389\n00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.970\nAnd like they said, it's not something you\nshould be doing on your primary computer.\n\n390\n00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:36.030\nSo we'll go ahead and choose Confirm,\nand we'll let it restart.\n\n391\n00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:36.930\nNow, I wanna go ahead and\n\n392\n00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:41.170\ngive it a chance to restart to\nshow you what the difference is.\n\n393\n00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:43.910\nBecause what's kinda interesting\non this is you might say, man.\n\n394\n00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:45.060\nWe're gonna restart it.\n\n395\n00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:49.255\nWe're gonna get a whole bunch of features\nthat nobody even knows about yet.\n\n396\n00:20:49.255 --> 00:20:52.543\nNow, my computer,\nmy friend's got a computer next to me and\n\n397\n00:20:52.543 --> 00:20:56.996\nwe're gonna see everything that's gonna\nbe in that operating system before that\n\n398\n00:20:56.996 --> 00:20:57.913\nperson sees it.\n\n399\n00:20:57.913 --> 00:21:00.080\nWell maybe, but not always.\n\n400\n00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:05.240\nIn fact, from the surface, when we get\nlogged back in here to this machine,\n\n401\n00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.010\nyou're gonna notice that\nthe Windows time machine,\n\n402\n00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.820\nit really doesn't look much different.\n\n403\n00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:12.347\nAll it did was it did a restart.\n\n404\n00:21:12.347 --> 00:21:16.070\nAnd, we'll go ahead and\nwe'll get logged back in here.\n\n405\n00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:21.664\nAnd when we get logged back in, we're\ngonna navigate back to the same location.\n\n406\n00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:26.450\nAll right, so we'll let it go ahead and\nget logged in here.\n\n407\n00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:29.130\nWe're going back to the action center.\n\n408\n00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:30.155\nAll settings.\n\n409\n00:21:30.155 --> 00:21:31.620\n&gt;&gt; Like a movie back to the action.\n\n410\n00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:33.040\n&gt;&gt; It is that's right, that's right.\n\n411\n00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.380\nThe sequel.\n\n412\n00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:38.180\nAnd now notice that so\nfar nothing looks really any different.\n\n413\n00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:42.380\nAnd however when we go to the Insider\nprogram you'll see that this menu\n\n414\n00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.660\nhas completely changed.\n\n415\n00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:46.180\nAll right.\nNotice that you can choose\n\n416\n00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.425\nyour Insider level.\n\n417\n00:21:47.425 --> 00:21:50.180\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n418\n00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:53.969\nSo what do we want as\nfar as bleeding edge.\n\n419\n00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.260\nDo I want this released?\n\n420\n00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:00.950\nAs soon as it gets,\njust bleeding edge, right?\n\n421\n00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:04.830\nNotice it says best for insiders who\nenjoy being first to identify issues,\n\n422\n00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:08.560\nsuggestions and make ideas, or\nideas to make Windows device great.\n\n423\n00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:13.261\nWhich means, this comes packed with\nall the bugs of untested software.\n\n424\n00:22:13.261 --> 00:22:14.316\nOr you could say, slow.\n\n425\n00:22:14.316 --> 00:22:15.930\nOr you could say, release preview.\n\n426\n00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:19.460\nAnd this is,\nthe release preview is just behind getting\n\n427\n00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:22.520\npushed out to current branch was\nbasically released to the world.\n\n428\n00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:27.120\nSo what happens if you decide that you\ndon't wanna be a part of the insider\n\n429\n00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.300\npreview build anymore?\n\n430\n00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:29.130\nWell that's okay.\n\n431\n00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:30.730\nYou just stop.\n\n432\n00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:32.740\nJust press that button.\n\n433\n00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:35.110\nAnd it asked you,\ndo you wanna take a break?\n\n434\n00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:39.170\nSo we can actually delay some of\nthese updates here if we need to, or\n\n435\n00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:42.840\nwe can go a little bit further and\nwe can remove it completely.\n\n436\n00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:46.990\nNow, keep in mind if you\nremove it completely, again,\n\n437\n00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:50.130\nit's gonna take you out of you\nthe Insider build and that is up to you.\n\n438\n00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:53.600\nSo that's a little bit\nabout your Insider preview.\n\n439\n00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.620\nNow, the next thing that I wanna show and\n\n440\n00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:59.760\nprobably one of the final things is they\nalso talk about managing your drivers.\n\n441\n00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.140\nNow, Driver management,\nkeep in mind what drivers are, right?\n\n442\n00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:07.140\nIt's the supplemental piece of software\nthat allows our operating system\n\n443\n00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.940\nto talk to our hardware, and\ndriver management is important.\n\n444\n00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:14.160\nA lot of times this is gonna be managed\nby an internal patch management solution\n\n445\n00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.690\nif you're in an enterprise environment.\n\n446\n00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:20.290\nHowever, let's show you where\nyou can do this in a manual way.\n\n447\n00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:21.270\nIf you so need to.\n\n448\n00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:26.510\nSo dropping back down to my screen here,\nif I right click on my Windows icon here,\n\n449\n00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:27.840\nI can choose Device Manager.\n\n450\n00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:35.740\nAnd this is where we get the ability if\nwe need to that we can install drivers.\n\n451\n00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:39.360\nHowever I would say rely on plug and\nplay today.\n\n452\n00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:44.830\nKeep in mind that manual driver\ninstallation can happen for\n\n453\n00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:49.440\nvideo cards and stuff like that, before\nthey ever get put into Windows update.\n\n454\n00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.895\nSo you might need to do\nthis manually as well.\n\n455\n00:23:50.895 --> 00:23:52.591\nA lot of times plug and\nplay works for us and\n\n456\n00:23:52.591 --> 00:23:55.320\nwe don't really have to worry\nabout manual driver installation.\n\n457\n00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:58.463\nBut just in case you do,\nYou can always right-click on a device and\n\n458\n00:23:58.463 --> 00:23:59.990\nyou can choose the properties.\n\n459\n00:24:02.478 --> 00:24:05.634\nAnd you can get the general\ndetails of the driver, or\n\n460\n00:24:05.634 --> 00:24:08.090\nthe properties of the hardware itself.\n\n461\n00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:10.579\nYou can get driver details, all right.\n\n462\n00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:17.589\nIf you update a driver software you can\nupdate by going online if you need to.\n\n463\n00:24:17.589 --> 00:24:21.445\nAnd we will go ahead and do this, and\nnotice it is searching online and\n\n464\n00:24:21.445 --> 00:24:25.501\nit reaches out to Windows update and\nit says do we have any new drivers that\n\n465\n00:24:25.501 --> 00:24:28.580\naren't currently for\nthis piece of hardware device?\n\n466\n00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:31.530\nIt should say that we've\ngot the best one here.\n\n467\n00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:32.530\nIf I remember right.\n\n468\n00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:34.160\nWe'll just give it a second to finish.\n\n469\n00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:37.920\nOr you could do the local installation.\n\n470\n00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.700\nAnd when you do the local installation,\nwhat's gonna happen is if you have\n\n471\n00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:43.650\nan optical drive, you have a thumb\ndrive and the driver is on it.\n\n472\n00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:47.570\nYou can load the optical disc in\nthe drive and point it over there.\n\n473\n00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:48.540\nSo it didn't find it.\n\n474\n00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:49.610\nLet's go ahead.\n\n475\n00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:52.840\nAnd do that one more time and\nshow you the manual installation process.\n\n476\n00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.350\nWe can come over here\nto browse My Computer.\n\n477\n00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:58.680\nAnd if I wanted to I could\nthrow it in an optical tray or\n\n478\n00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:02.940\nI could throw it in a USB device and\nI could point over to it if I needed to.\n\n479\n00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:06.910\nThe other thing I can do which is probably\nnot recommended today is to do a manual\n\n480\n00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:10.750\ndriver installation with the one's that\nare already pre-baked into Windows.\n\n481\n00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:16.560\nKeep in mind that you do run the risk\nof having incompatibilities, right?\n\n482\n00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:20.970\nSo, again, with manual driver\ninstallation, I'd be careful.\n\n483\n00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:25.170\nHowever, let's say, and\nwe'll go ahead and close this down.\n\n484\n00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:28.840\nLet's say that you do install a driver and\nit causes problems.\n\n485\n00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:31.460\nWell, there's a couple of\nthings that you can do.\n\n486\n00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.700\nFor one I would boot into safe mode.\n\n487\n00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:38.460\nIf you can't get into the machine under\nnormal boot process, boot into safe mode.\n\n488\n00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:41.500\nLaunch device manager,\nfind the device that's in question and\n\n489\n00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.240\nchoose roll back driver.\n\n490\n00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:46.330\nAnd that will roll you back to\nthe previous driver before it.\n\n491\n00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:48.420\nNow, I haven't updated a driver here and\n\n492\n00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:52.000\nI'm not gonna update the keyboard,\nthere's nothing to roll back to.\n\n493\n00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.650\nNow, if you could still get\ninto the operating system,\n\n494\n00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:56.780\nyou certainly don't have\nto go into safe mode.\n\n495\n00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:00.100\nWhat you can do is you can\njust boot right up normally?\n\n496\n00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:03.390\nCome in here into device manager and\n\n497\n00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:06.340\nyou could do the rollback\ndriver this way as well.\n\n498\n00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:09.600\nSo, fairly easy way that you\ncan manage your drivers.\n\n499\n00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.540\nAnd I'm not going to\nrestart this to change.\n\n500\n00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:13.530\nBy the way,\nany time you make any changes in there.\n\n501\n00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:15.890\nIt is gonna require you\nto restart the machine.\n\n502\n00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:18.980\nSo, it can unload the driver\nthat is currently being used.\n\n503\n00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.820\nAnd it can load the driver\nthat you're replacing it with.\n\n504\n00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:24.920\nHowever, if you need to\ndo driver management.\n\n505\n00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:29.218\nDevice Manager is gonna be where\nyou do it the way that you do it.\n\n506\n00:26:29.218 --> 00:26:30.969\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, backups, updates,\n\n507\n00:26:30.969 --> 00:26:33.190\na lot of cool stuff that\nwe learned in this episode.\n\n508\n00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:36.876\nWes, you did a great job of walking us\ndown that road, showing us each steps so\n\n509\n00:26:36.876 --> 00:26:37.689\nthat we don't.\n\n510\n00:26:37.689 --> 00:26:40.591\nWe have some familiarity with it\nif we've never done it before and\n\n511\n00:26:40.591 --> 00:26:43.640\nmaybe answer a question or\ntwo if we have done it before.\n\n512\n00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.100\nThat being said it looks like we're\nout of time for this episode.\n\n513\n00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:50.160\nWe do thank you, Wes, for joining us,\nand we do thank our studio audience,\n\n514\n00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:54.300\nthose that are watching us live\nas

Lowry.\n\n517\n00:26:58.260 --> 00:26:58.950\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n518\n00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:01.284\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n519\n00:27:01.284 -->
