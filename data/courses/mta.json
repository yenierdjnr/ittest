          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:06,268\n[SOUND]\n\n2\n00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:11,114\nThe Microsoft Technical Associate\ncertification is one\n\n3\n00:00:11,114 --> 00:00:14,150\nof the newer certifications to come from,\nwell, Microsoft.\n\n4\n00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,120\nThat's, that's the whole name.\n\n5\n00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:16,745\n[LAUGH].\n\n6\n00:00:16,745 --> 00:00:19,935\nIt's the MTA, and it's a great\nnew certification designed for\n\n7\n00:00:19,935 --> 00:00:23,485\npeople that are just getting\nstarted in the world of IT.\n\n8\n00:00:23,485 --> 00:00:26,545\nThere's some really big certification\nnames that are out there,\n\n9\n00:00:26,545 --> 00:00:31,917\nlike Cisco's CCNA or Microsoft's MCSE,\nand those names are ubiquitous.\n\n10\n00:00:31,917 --> 00:00:36,370\nEverybody knows about them any kind of\nHR manager or hiring consultant is,\n\n11\n00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,895\nis gonna recognize those\ncertifications and\n\n12\n00:00:38,895 --> 00:00:42,043\nthey bring a lot of value\nto you as an IT worker.\n\n13\n00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:45,123\nBut if you're just getting started,\nthose certifications are pretty hard.\n\n14\n00:00:45,123 --> 00:00:48,853\nThere's a lot of information in there and\nthey really do expect you to have\n\n15\n00:00:48,853 --> 00:00:53,363\nsome real world experience already before\nyou jump into those certifications.\n\n16\n00:00:53,363 --> 00:00:57,517\nSo, if you're just getting started in IT,\nif you've got a resume\n\n17\n00:00:57,517 --> 00:01:02,430\npacked full of other things, not IT jobs,\nhow do you, how do you get in there?\n\n18\n00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,949\nYou can't just jump to those\nhigh level certifications.\n\n19\n00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,490\nAnd so\nthat's where the Microsoft MTA comes in.\n\n20\n00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,398\nIt's designed for people who don't\nnecessarily have even a single moment of\n\n21\n00:01:13,398 --> 00:01:15,524\nfield experience working in IT.\n\n22\n00:01:15,524 --> 00:01:19,655\nBut you can get in there, work with,\nwork with the technology, learn it,\n\n23\n00:01:19,655 --> 00:01:21,820\ntake the test and get certified.\n\n24\n00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,710\nAnd it shows that you have a basic\nlevel of, of skill, not just with,\n\n25\n00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,770\nwith basic computer literacy but\nalso with working and\n\n26\n00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,270\nsupporting Windows desktop\noperating systems.\n\n27\n00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,940\nSo, this is really the first step for\nsomebody entering the IT,\n\n28\n00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,680\njust career field in general,\ncuz you'll jump into things like a help\n\n29\n00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,370\ndesk position, some kind of desktop\nsupport, maybe a field repair technician.\n\n30\n00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,350\nAnd this base level experience is,\nis what you need just to get started.\n\n31\n00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,100\n>> Yeah.\n\n32\n00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,310\nBasic knowledge is what we're hoping to\nconvey with the Microsoft technology.\n\n33\n00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,890\nWithout the field experience, you have to\nhave at least the foundational knowledge.\n\n34\n00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,920\nMicrosoft wants you to get ready for that.\n\n35\n00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,740\nAnd then, as you enter into the job\nmarket, you'll actually begin to\n\n36\n00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:04,120\nbuild more of your field experience and be\nready then for the other certifications,\n\n37\n00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,910\nthat are coming down the pipeline for\nyou as you get started in your IT career.\n\n38\n00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,360\nSo, that's what we're gonna be doing in\nthis series is helping you to build that\n\n39\n00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,860\nfoundational knowledge and\nunderstanding of the operating system.\n\n40\n00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,854\n>> And the other nice thing about\nthe MTA is if you're not certain, if,\n\n41\n00:02:18,854 --> 00:02:21,600\nif you don't know if IT is\nthe right career field for you and\n\n42\n00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,980\nyou just wanna test the waters, right,\nyou just wanna give it a shot, right?\n\n43\n00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,740\nMTA is a real low commitment.\n\n44\n00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,070\nIt's a small set of knowledge, so\n\n45\n00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,020\nit's not like you're having to deal with\nthese giant books of content, right?\n\n46\n00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,790\nSo, it's a pretty manageable\nset of information.\n\n47\n00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:39,110\nIt's one exam, and you pass that exam and\nyou get your certification.\n\n48\n00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,800\nSo, low commitment there too,\non the cost side.\n\n49\n00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,870\nThe exam, do you you remember Ronnie,\nis it 125 or-\n\n50\n00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,863\n>> About a $115.\n\n51\n00:02:44,863 --> 00:02:45,840\n>> 115.\nAll right.\n\n52\n00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,971\nSo, so in, in theory,\nyou study, you pay a $115,\n\n53\n00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:52,340\nyou pass the exam and\nyou get the certification.\n\n54\n00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,480\nAnd if you decide that IT is not right for\nyou, you're out a $115 and not so\n\n55\n00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,440\nbad, right?\n\n56\n00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,536\nSo, it is a great way to get started and,\nand see if IT is right for you.\n\n57\n00:03:01,536 --> 00:03:05,302\nOr if you know IT is right for you, but\nyou just don't have a lot of experience,\n\n58\n00:03:05,302 --> 00:03:07,530\nyou can jump in and knock it out.\n\n59\n00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,252\nNow, Microsoft introduced the MTA\nprogram a little over a year ago,\n\n60\n00:03:11,252 --> 00:03:15,249\nit hasn't been around all that long but\nit's been very very successful.\n\n61\n00:03:15,249 --> 00:03:20,082\nAnd they've expanded it quite a bit\nfrom the original two exams to now where\n\n62\n00:03:20,082 --> 00:03:22,880\nthere's nine different exams.\n\n63\n00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,360\nIt doesn't really matter\nwhich one you take,\n\n64\n00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,170\nall the MTA exams when you pass\none of them, you'd get your MTA.\n\n65\n00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,340\nSo, you need to look at\nthe ones that are available and\n\n66\n00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,500\nselect the one that's right for you.\n\n67\n00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,501\nHere at ITProTV, we've chosen\nthe operating system fundamentals exam.\n\n68\n00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:43,150\nAnd, and let me just pull this up here, I\nwanna show you guys the MTA hierarchy and,\n\n69\n00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,040\nand this is on Microsoft's website here.\n\n70\n00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,980\nI've just pulled up their, their MTA page.\n\n71\n00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,260\nAnd as we look at it,\nthey show the MTA certification tracks and\n\n72\n00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,905\nthey break it up into infrastructure,\ndatabase, developer.\n\n73\n00:03:55,905 --> 00:03:56,828\nAll right?\n\n74\n00:03:56,828 --> 00:04:00,060\nIf you wanna become a programmer\nworking with Visual Studio,\n\n75\n00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,820\nVisual Basic, Visual C Sharp,\nand all of that,\n\n76\n00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,970\nthey've got developer MTAs that you can\njump into and they list all of those.\n\n77\n00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:07,830\nThere's six of them.\n\n78\n00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,710\nThey've actually added\nsome since I've been here.\n\n79\n00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:13,880\nSo, each of these, you would just take\none of these, pass that exam, and\n\n80\n00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,354\nget your MTA.\n\n81\n00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:18,385\nIf you wanna be a database administrator,\nwell, that's a much smaller one,\n\n82\n00:04:18,385 --> 00:04:22,465\nthere's just one that covers\ngeneral database fundamentals.\n\n83\n00:04:22,465 --> 00:04:27,395\nBut for a normal IT worker, there's\ngonna be a sys admin, or help desk,\n\n84\n00:04:27,395 --> 00:04:30,265\nsome kind of support role,\neven a network engineer.\n\n85\n00:04:30,265 --> 00:04:33,825\nIt's IT infrastructure that we shoot for,\nand IT infrastructure's\n\n86\n00:04:33,825 --> 00:04:37,930\nreally what the majority of\nITProTV's content centers around.\n\n87\n00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:38,630\nAnd you'll see,\n\n88\n00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:44,180\nthere's four different tracks here, and\neach one of them is equally important.\n\n89\n00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,760\nIf you've gonna go into the IT field,\nyou really should have experience, or, or\n\n90\n00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,870\nknowledge in all four of these areas.\n\n91\n00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,160\nSo, no one is more\nimportant than the other.\n\n92\n00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,870\nWe have\nWindows Operating System Fundamentals,\n\n93\n00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,690\nwhat we're gonna cover here in this show.\n\n94\n00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,570\nWe've got Windows Server\nAdministration Fundamentals.\n\n95\n00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,400\nNow, what's the difference there?\n\n96\n00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,210\nWell, operating system fundamentals that's\nreally focused on the workstations on your\n\n97\n00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,340\nlaptop, and your desktop versus servers,\n\n98\n00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,440\nthat's where we get to the big\niron that's in the server room.\n\n99\n00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,270\nRight?\nWhat's actually providing our web\n\n100\n00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,290\nservices, email, and, and all of that.\n\n101\n00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:22,010\nIt's a little bit more advanced and I,\nI find generally, it's not appropriate for\n\n102\n00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,510\npeople that are just\ngetting started in IT.\n\n103\n00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,430\nNobody's gonna hire you to work on\ntheir servers if you have absolutely no\n\n104\n00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,105\nexperience, you normally need to\nget started a little bit smaller.\n\n105\n00:05:32,105 --> 00:05:35,840\nCuz if you break a server,\nyou can be affecting thousands of people\n\n106\n00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,400\nversus if you break a desktop,\nyou're just affecting one person, right?\n\n107\n00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,387\nSo, that's kind of why we've leaned\ntowards the operating system fundamentals\n\n108\n00:05:42,387 --> 00:05:44,390\nand not the server administration at,\nat that state.\n\n109\n00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,360\nNow, the remaining two aren't unimportant,\nright?\n\n110\n00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,770\nNetworking fundamentals, almost every\ncomputer these days is network.\n\n111\n00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,970\nYou need to be able to get out there and\ncommunicate with the internet and\n\n112\n00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,000\nother services, and\nnetwork fundamentals covers that.\n\n113\n00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,990\nAnd security fundamentals, right,\na, a, a week barely goes by\n\n114\n00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,170\nthat we don't hear about some major\ncompany having a security compromise.\n\n115\n00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,380\nSo, again, very, very important.\n\n116\n00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,100\nSo, why didn't we choose to cover those?\n\n117\n00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,660\nWell, in my opinion, and, and everybody's\nopinion is, is different and may vary.\n\n118\n00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,310\nBut in, in our opinion here at ITProTV\nthere are other certifications that\n\n119\n00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,990\ncover those areas in much more depth that\nare much more widely known, all right?\n\n120\n00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,940\nIf you pass this one exam,\nyou get your MTA.\n\n121\n00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:34,020\nIf you pass all four of these exams,\nyou still have just one MTA.\n\n122\n00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,740\nSo, on your resume, it doesn't really make\na difference as far as which ones you\n\n123\n00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,370\npass here, you just need to pass one.\n\n124\n00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:43,010\nAnd if you're just starting,\nthe Windows Operating System Fundamentals,\n\n125\n00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,470\nthat's really the best one.\n\n126\n00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,590\nThat's the one that, that gives\nyou the basic skills to get in and\n\n127\n00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,680\nstart to support systems.\n\n128\n00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,880\nIf you wanna go on, well, Windows server\nadministration, you'll learn all about\n\n129\n00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:01,430\nthat in the MCSA track, the Microsoft\nCertified Solutions Associate.\n\n130\n00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,986\nIs that right Ronnie?\n\n131\n00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:03,020\n>> Mm-hm, solutions associate, yep.\n\n132\n00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,010\n>> Okay [LAUGH].\nIt, it changed.\n\n133\n00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,330\nIt used to be the Microsoft\nCertified Systems Administrator and\n\n134\n00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,200\nthey changed the name so\nI get a little tongue-tied there.\n\n135\n00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,050\nBut the MCSA, and that's where\nyou're learning all the nitty-gritty\n\n136\n00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,180\ndetails about how to work on\nthe servers and general administration.\n\n137\n00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,350\nAnd the MCSA is a much\nbetter certification for\n\n138\n00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,390\nthat, and\nwe do cover that here at ITProTV.\n\n139\n00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,460\nOn the networking side, well,\nthere's the CompTIA Network+ and\n\n140\n00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,980\nthe Cisco CC enable, both of which\ncover networking in great detail.\n\n141\n00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,630\nAnd if you're gonna be a network engineer,\n\n142\n00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,710\nthose certifications are much better for\nthat.\n\n143\n00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:36,570\nAnd look a lot better on the resume,\nand so we cover that for networking.\n\n144\n00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:39,935\nAnd on the security side,\nthere's the CompTIA Security+,\n\n145\n00:07:39,935 --> 00:07:43,630\nwhich is internationally known,\nvery largely accepted as that\n\n146\n00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,360\nstarting point for somebody that's\ngonna be a security professional.\n\n147\n00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,920\nBut if you're starting out with no\nexperience, nobody's gonna hire you to be\n\n148\n00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,230\na security professional without some\nkind of resume to back that up.\n\n149\n00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,900\nIt's not a good starting point.\n\n150\n00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,630\nAnd so,\nwe chose to not cover the remaining three\n\n151\n00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:02,560\nbecause other certifications cover it and\n\n152\n00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,130\nare more widely known, and\ncover it in more depth and detail.\n\n153\n00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,440\nYou're certainly welcome to\npursue these certifications,\n\n154\n00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,840\nwe just don't necessarily\nfind a lot of value there.\n\n155\n00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,440\nSo, the Windows operating\nsystem fundamentals,\n\n156\n00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,260\nthat's the one that creates the value.\n\n157\n00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,720\nAnd so, that's what we're gonna\nbe covering here in this show.\n\n158\n00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,960\nOver the next series of episodes,\n\n159\n00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,610\nwe're gonna film all of the content\nthat's covered by that exam.\n\n160\n00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,680\nEverything that you need\nto know to go in there and\n\n161\n00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,550\npass the exam on your first shot and\nthat's, that's really what we hope.\n\n162\n00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,140\nWe want people to make sure\nthey have good comprehension,\n\n163\n00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:36,910\nunderstand the content, go in there and\npass, and kick off that IT career, right?\n\n164\n00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,380\nOnce you have this\ncertification under the belt,\n\n165\n00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,133\nyou're ready to rocket forward and\nmove in to the next one.\n\n166\n00:08:42,142 --> 00:08:45,235\nAll right, so let's, let's take\na look at that certification and\n\n167\n00:08:45,235 --> 00:08:46,384\nwhat to entail, right?\n\n168\n00:08:46,384 --> 00:08:49,808\nSo, here is the 98-349 exam.\n\n169\n00:08:49,808 --> 00:08:51,520\nThat's the examination number.\n\n170\n00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,560\nWhen you're ready to go and\npass this exam, you go to well,\n\n171\n00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,220\nPearson VUE is the company that\nadministers exams for Microsoft.\n\n172\n00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,550\nPearson VUE has centers\nall over the world.\n\n173\n00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:06,501\nYou just go to their website,\nwhich is VUE, VUE.com.\n\n174\n00:09:06,501 --> 00:09:10,264\nAnd when you go to the VUE website,\nthey'll have in here where you can pick\n\n175\n00:09:10,264 --> 00:09:13,864\nwhat vendor you're testing with and\nwe, we'll just say Microsoft.\n\n176\n00:09:13,864 --> 00:09:16,337\nIt'll be buried in here somewhere,\nthere we go.\n\n177\n00:09:16,337 --> 00:09:19,740\nAnd you can go in and\nstart to sign up for a Microsoft exam.\n\n178\n00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:25,900\nAnd you'll see there's the MTA exams, and\nyou'll be able to sign up and take it.\n\n179\n00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,986\nAll right?\nYou'll find a,\n\n180\n00:09:26,986 --> 00:09:28,540\na VUE center that is near you, right?\n\n181\n00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,855\nSo, so, there'll be one usually in your\ncity or a nearby city that you can go and\n\n182\n00:09:31,855 --> 00:09:32,840\ntake the exam at.\n\n183\n00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,410\nI think there's two or\nthree of them here in Gainesville and\n\n184\n00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:39,020\nwe're in a really small city, so\nthey're, they're all over the place.\n\n185\n00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,480\nBut you'll go and you'll take that exam.\n\n186\n00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,830\nNow, what do you need to know,\nright, what, what's covered.\n\n187\n00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,450\nWell, Microsoft publishes all\nthe information right here on\n\n188\n00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:52,397\ntheir 98-349 page, and let you know\nabout where you can take at VUE.\n\n189\n00:09:52,397 --> 00:09:55,383\nThey list Prometric, but\nthat's ending soon, right?\n\n190\n00:09:55,383 --> 00:09:57,008\nDo you remember, Ronnie [CROSSTALK],\nit, it's actually right here.\n\n191\n00:09:57,008 --> 00:09:57,597\n>> Yeah.\n\n192\n00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,310\n>> December 31st, 2014.\n\n193\n00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,340\nDepending on when you watch this video,\nthat may have already passed.\n\n194\n00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,570\nWhen we're shooting it right now,\n\n195\n00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,750\nif you're watching live,\nthat's a month from now.\n\n196\n00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,280\nSo, in about one month that's\nnot gonna be available anymore.\n\n197\n00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,550\nSo, you really need to\ntest with Pearson VUE.\n\n198\n00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,910\nBut they also list what's\ncovered on the exam.\n\n199\n00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,840\nAnd you'll see where they\ndivided it up into six sections.\n\n200\n00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,260\nEach one worth between 15 and\n20% of the exam.\n\n201\n00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,005\nAnd the exam questions are spread\nacross all these areas.\n\n202\n00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:30,000\nAll right, so Ronnie let,\nlet's do a quick review of these areas.\n\n203\n00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000\nKind of what's expected.\n\n204\n00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,010\nBecause for some of you guys sitting out\nthere, you might already know this stuff.\n\n205\n00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,610\nThis might not be the right\ncertification for you.\n\n206\n00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,430\nYou might already be beyond it.\n\n207\n00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,030\nRight?\n\n208\n00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,070\nDoesn't mean you couldn't go take\nthe exam and get the certification,\n\n209\n00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,170\nstill looks good on the resume,\n\n210\n00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,810\nbut you might choose to move\nto a more advanced one.\n\n211\n00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,198\nSo, let's, let's just kinda run down these\nand, and see what else is involved, right?\n\n212\n00:10:47,198 --> 00:10:49,720\n>> The first exam\nobjective that we have is,\n\n213\n00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,420\nunderstanding operating\nsystem configurations.\n\n214\n00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,480\nAnd this is where we get\ninto the operating system.\n\n215\n00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,487\nAnd we show you what you can do to\nmanipulate the operating system to change\n\n216\n00:10:58,487 --> 00:10:59,983\nit better to suit the user.\n\n217\n00:10:59,983 --> 00:11:02,293\nSo, that they can do\neverything that they need to.\n\n218\n00:11:02,293 --> 00:11:04,170\nSo, you'll see things like control panel.\n\n219\n00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:08,133\nAnd we're gonna take a look at some of the\ndesktop settings where we can change that\n\n220\n00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:11,143\nand make it look a little bit better,\nfor the user to be able to do.\n\n221\n00:11:11,143 --> 00:11:14,952\nAnd then, we are going to get underneath\na little bit and take look at the native\n\n222\n00:11:14,952 --> 00:11:18,302\ntools that are built in that allow\nus to configure what start's up and\n\n223\n00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,778\nsome different items there.\n\n224\n00:11:19,778 --> 00:11:20,544\n>> Yeah.\n\n225\n00:11:20,544 --> 00:11:24,354\nAnd you'll see a lot of things in here\nthat our, our regular end used might not\n\n226\n00:11:24,354 --> 00:11:27,355\nneed but as a support personnel,\nyou more than likely will.\n\n227\n00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:31,750\nNow, after that we move on to installing\nand upgrading plan systems, right?\n\n228\n00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,048\nWe might need to reinstall windows.\n\n229\n00:11:34,048 --> 00:11:35,928\nFor your average consumer,\nthey buy a laptop or\n\n230\n00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:38,870\ndesktop and it's already installed\non there and they're fine.\n\n231\n00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:42,390\nBut in a company environment, you'll\noftentimes have to erase a machine and\n\n232\n00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,670\nclean it up, you know,\nget a new install on there.\n\n233\n00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,370\nSo, we'll cover that process, right?\n\n234\n00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,110\nHow we can install it,\n\n235\n00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:50,130\nthe different versions of Windows\nthat we have to worry about,\n\n236\n00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:53,510\nhow to do upgrades if we're actually\nupgrading from one version to another.\n\n237\n00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:57,970\nAnd we'll even touch on virtualization\nwhich is a big hot topic\n\n238\n00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,470\nin the enterprise sector right now.\n\n239\n00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,690\nSo, that's our real neat section.\n\n240\n00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,170\n>> Our third exam objective\nis on managing applications.\n\n241\n00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,480\nWhen the applications programs that\nwe install in the system to help\n\n242\n00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,480\nus do something specific,\n\n243\n00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,810\nwe wanna make sure that you know\nhow to install the applications.\n\n244\n00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,330\nWe also wanna make sure that\nyou understand how to uninstall\n\n245\n00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,425\napplications if you need to.\n\n246\n00:12:16,425 --> 00:12:21,075\nAnd then, when we run into issues,\nwhat do we do when we actually do have\n\n247\n00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:23,795\napplications when, when they're not\nrunning the way that we need to?\n\n248\n00:12:23,795 --> 00:12:24,835\nSo, we'll take a brief look at that.\n\n249\n00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:27,255\n>> All right.\nAnd then, after that,\n\n250\n00:12:27,255 --> 00:12:29,095\nwe're gonna dive into managing files and\n\n251\n00:12:29,095 --> 00:12:32,098\nfolders which might sound like a,\na, a given.\n\n252\n00:12:32,098 --> 00:12:34,520\nMost people know how to copy or\npaste a file or\n\n253\n00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,790\nmove a file around on the hard drive.\n\n254\n00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:39,190\nBut we're gonna look at some other\nthings like permissions that can be set,\n\n255\n00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,810\ndifferent file systems file and\nprint sharing.\n\n256\n00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,290\nSo, sharing our, our data over a network.\n\n257\n00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,190\nAnd even disc encryption,\n\n258\n00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:50,600\nwhich is another important topic we're\nhearing a lot about in the news lately.\n\n259\n00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,415\nSo, we'll get a chance to see how to\nimplement those safely and securely.\n\n260\n00:12:54,415 --> 00:12:55,960\n>> Yeah.\n\n261\n00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,790\nOur fourth one is going\nto be managing devices.\n\n262\n00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,150\nThis is where we add in\nperipheral devices, or\n\n263\n00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:05,140\nthings like hard drives, how we actually\nstore data on those hard drives,\n\n264\n00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,510\nwhat do we need to make sure that\nwe're doing the, the proper storage.\n\n265\n00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,840\nAlso, how do we get data\nout of our computers?\n\n266\n00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,970\nWe'll talk about how we print and\n\n267\n00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:16,460\nwhat we need to do to make sure that\nwe print to the correct location, too.\n\n268\n00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,330\nAnd even other devices that we might\nfind that we have to get the operating\n\n269\n00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,050\nsystem to talk to.\n\n270\n00:13:21,105 --> 00:13:23,035\n>> And then, the very last\nsection is this guy right here,\n\n271\n00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:25,235\nunderstanding operating\nsystem maintenance.\n\n272\n00:13:25,235 --> 00:13:28,032\nAnd that says, just because your\ncomputer's running fine today,\n\n273\n00:13:28,032 --> 00:13:29,515\ndoesn't mean it will be tomorrow.\n\n274\n00:13:29,515 --> 00:13:33,970\nWe need to take some basic steps to keep\nour machines healthy and running smoothly.\n\n275\n00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:37,330\nSo, we'll see how to do backups and\nrecovery, in case we have a failure.\n\n276\n00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,110\nHow to do general maintenance\nto keep things running smooth.\n\n277\n00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,227\nAnd then, lastly,\n\n278\n00:13:41,227 --> 00:13:45,515\nprobably the most important section of\nthe whole certification is updates.\n\n279\n00:13:45,515 --> 00:13:49,182\nKeeping your system up to date and\npatched so that when there's a, a bug or\n\n280\n00:13:49,182 --> 00:13:52,259\na security exploit or\nwhatever that you're taking care of and\n\n281\n00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:55,650\nthat you don't get you're system\ncompromised or loose your data.\n\n282\n00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:02,455\nSo, all said and done, those six\nareas cover quite a bit of stuff.\n\n283\n00:14:02,455 --> 00:14:05,285\nAnd some of it is content\nthat you might already know,\n\n284\n00:14:05,285 --> 00:14:06,885\njust through your basic use of Windows.\n\n285\n00:14:06,885 --> 00:14:08,665\nAnd that's great,\nthat gives you a head start.\n\n286\n00:14:08,665 --> 00:14:11,865\nBut other parts might go beyond that\nto show things that we use in a,\n\n287\n00:14:11,865 --> 00:14:14,825\nin a work environment when\nyou have an IT career.\n\n288\n00:14:14,825 --> 00:14:18,265\nAnd that's the part that we need to study,\nmake sure we understand,\n\n289\n00:14:18,265 --> 00:14:21,095\nget some good comfort,\ncomfort, comfort level with.\n\n290\n00:14:21,095 --> 00:14:23,790\nAnd then, jump in there and\npass that exam.\n\n291\n00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:28,210\nNow, you're ready to go out and start\napplying for jobs that are help desk,\n\n292\n00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:32,440\nbasic support, computer repair,\nthose type of entry level jobs.\n\n293\n00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,010\nAnd I know it's not glorious, some people,\nsome of you guys out there might be saying\n\n294\n00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:39,070\nit right now like, I don't wanna do that,\nI wanna work on the server.\n\n295\n00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,280\nWell, that's great.\n\n296\n00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,150\nBut you gotta work up to that.\n\n297\n00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,670\nRight?\n\n298\n00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,460\nYou don't start at\na company as the president.\n\n299\n00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,320\nYou work your way up to\nbecome the president.\n\n300\n00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,240\nRight?\nAnd that's how it is in IT.\n\n301\n00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,890\nIf you wanna be a network engineer or\na systems engineer,\n\n302\n00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:55,430\nif you wanna be up at that higher level\ndesigning networks and supporting\n\n303\n00:14:55,430 --> 00:15:00,020\nthe overall big picture, you gotta work up\nto that, you've gotta get that experience.\n\n304\n00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,160\nThis is the starting point, right?\n\n305\n00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,250\nThis is where we begin, right?\n\n306\n00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,230\nThere, there is another certification\nthat we offer here on ITProTV\n\n307\n00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:09,320\ncalled the CompTIA IT Fundamentals.\n\n308\n00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,170\nIt is also a great starting point.\n\n309\n00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,330\nSo, kind of compares really\nwell to the MTA, but\n\n310\n00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:20,790\nthe big difference here is with the MTA,\nit is Microsoft only.\n\n311\n00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,377\nRight.\nWe're just looking at Windows, which,\n\n312\n00:15:23,377 --> 00:15:25,703\nover 80% of business computers run.\n\n313\n00:15:25,703 --> 00:15:28,700\nSo, you definitely,\nit's something that you want to learn.\n\n314\n00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,750\nBut if you also wanna learn about other\noperating systems, like Mac OS or\n\n315\n00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,900\nLinux, well the CompTIA IT Fundamentals\nis vendor neutral.\n\n316\n00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:41,270\nSo, it covers some of those\nother OS's too, gives you that,\n\n317\n00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,230\nthat more broad view, right?\n\n318\n00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:47,030\nEven though, even though Linux desktops\nmake up very small percentage of business\n\n319\n00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:51,750\nmachines and Mac desktops are even smaller\nyou know that, that changes over time.\n\n320\n00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,460\nAnd who knows, maybe five years from now,\nLinux will be the number one desktop, or\n\n321\n00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,880\nMac will be the number one desktop.\n\n322\n00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,060\nThings change, right?\n\n323\n00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,650\nSo, it is a good idea to see that one.\n\n324\n00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:03,090\nAnd it's a good idea to do that\ncertification in addition to this one.\n\n325\n00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,570\nYou may do both, but it's,\nit's entirely up to you.\n\n326\n00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:09,800\nSo, if you haven't checked out CompTIA IT\nFundamentals, you might wanna review that.\n\n327\n00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,480\nYou know, we, we did an overview\nvideo just like this for it.\n\n328\n00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,680\nReview that and see which one is right for\nyou to start with,\n\n329\n00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,220\nif you just wanna do one or\ndo both, you know?\n\n330\n00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,819\nBoth of them are fairly small sets of,\nof information,\n\n331\n00:16:20,819 --> 00:16:23,817\neasy to study for and\ngreat way to get started.\n\n332\n00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:27,200\nAll right, well, if all of that sounds\nexciting to you, I hope it does,\n\n333\n00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,260\nwe're excited to jump in and do it.\n\n334\n00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,500\nAnd so, we are in the right place, right?\n\n335\n00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,600\nWe're ready to jump into our episodes and\nwe hope to see you there.\n\n336\n00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,980\nIf this doesn't sound right for\nyou, don't feel bad, right?\n\n337\n00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,240\nNot every certification is for\n\n338\n00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,260\neveryone, and just keep looking for\nthe one that's right for you.\n\n339\n00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:47,096\nIf you have any questions, right, if,\nif any of this isn't certain to you or, or\n\n340\n00:16:47,096 --> 00:16:48,880\nwhatever, feel free to ask us.\n\n341\n00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,770\nIf you're an ITProTV subscriber,\n\n342\n00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:53,090\nyou can always go to the Q&A forums and\npost there.\n\n343\n00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:56,320\nYou'll see the link that says\nQ&A at the top of every page.\n\n344\n00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,470\nYou can click on

00:17:13,260\nSo, instead, if you're just not certain,\nshoot us a support ticket.\n\n349\n00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,920\nThere's a contact us link at\nthe bottom of every page

successful.\n\n354\n00:17:26,063 --> 00:17:29,465\nIt's really important you pick\nthe right certifications to,\n\n355\n00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,736\nto start with cuz if you pick\nthe wrong ones at the beginning,\n\n356\n00:17:32,736 --> 00:17:35,299\nit can really set you up for\na, a tough time, and\n\n357\n00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:37,813\nyou can get kind of disenfranchised or-\n>>

say,\nIT is not right for me.\n\n361\n00:17:42,785 --> 00:17:45,565\nAnd it could have been great, you could\nhave a really wonderful career there.\n\n362\n00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,245\nAnd you just
