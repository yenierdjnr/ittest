00:00:13.648\nthe Microsoft Technology Associate\nexam number 98366.\n\n4\n00:00:13.648 --> 00:00:17.190\nThat's for your Networking Fundamentals\navailable from Microsoft.\n\n5\n00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.170\nNow, we're gonna do a little overview for\nyou so you know what to expect from\n\n6\n00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.780\nthe exam, what to expect from our videos,\ntry to help you get through that, so\n\n7\n00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.620\nthat you're ready for\nthat testing booth when that day comes.\n\n8\n00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.916\nNow Ronnie, you've done some\nlittle research for us here,\n\n9\n00:00:28.916 --> 00:00:32.126\nand you're gonna show us, walk us through\na little bit of what to expect, correct?\n\n10\n00:00:32.126 --> 00:00:32.850\n>> Right.\n\n11\n00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.440\nWe actually take a look here,\n\n12\n00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.500\nthe Microsoft technology associate,\nis really designed for\n\n13\n00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.590\nthe person that is saying, look,\nI think I wanna get into the IT world.\n\n14\n00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.310\nAnd, one of the fields in the IT\nworld that you really need to at\n\n15\n00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.290\nleast have the fundamentals of\nbefore you go on and try and\n\n16\n00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.380\nmaster the other skills,\nis gonna be networking.\n\n17\n00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.450\nAnd in this particular series of shows,\nwe're gonna introduce you to the most\n\n18\n00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.690\ncommon concepts that you need to know,\nand you definitely need to have\n\n19\n00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.160\na basic understanding of as you\ncontinue on towards your IT career.\n\n20\n00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.480\nAnd so, this is one of these types\nof certifications that shows\n\n21\n00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.910\nany employer out there that you are ready\nfor the challenges that are to come.\n\n22\n00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.738\nIt doesn't necessarily mean\nthat you're an expert.\n\n23\n00:01:12.738 --> 00:01:16.014\nBut what it shows them is that you've\nalready made a commitment to do so, and\n\n24\n00:01:16.014 --> 00:01:19.702\nthat you are actually serious about this\ncommitment, because you've taken the time\n\n25\n00:01:19.702 --> 00:01:22.765\nand the energy to be able to go\nthrough and pass these types of exams.\n\n26\n00:01:22.765 --> 00:01:25.835\nSo, let's go ahead and take a look at\nwhat's normally covered in this exam,\n\n27\n00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:28.565\nand also what we've covered\nin our shows as well.\n\n28\n00:01:28.565 --> 00:01:33.506\nSo, on my computer, I went ahead and\nbrought up from Microsoft's site itself,\n\n29\n00:01:33.506 --> 00:01:36.932\nthe official exam objective\ncertification place too.\n\n30\n00:01:36.932 --> 00:01:40.821\nAnd so if you go and you do a search\nin your favorite search engine for\n\n31\n00:01:40.821 --> 00:01:45.753\nthat exam number, the exam 98-366, you\nwill end up in being able to find on one\n\n32\n00:01:45.753 --> 00:01:50.637\nof those top links here, where it says\nthat exam and the Networking Fundamentals.\n\n33\n00:01:50.637 --> 00:01:52.190\nFor about $115 US,\n\n34\n00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.540\nthat will get you a reservation to\nbe able to take this exam too, and\n\n35\n00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.030\nyou of course, will have this ability\nto either use Certiport or Pearson VUE.\n\n36\n00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.160\nMake sure you actually get ready for\nthat, as well.\n\n37\n00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.710\nAnd, you'll just be scheduling your\ntime is what will end up happening here.\n\n38\n00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.160\nNow as I scroll on down, Microsoft\ndoesn't call out exam objectives,\n\n39\n00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.780\nthey like calling them\nskills measured instead.\n\n40\n00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.470\nAnd what they mean by that is\nthat here is the technology.\n\n41\n00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.318\nHere is what you have to understand.\n\n42\n00:02:18.318 --> 00:02:21.443\nAnd so the only way that we can measure\nthis is not by whether or not, yes,\n\n43\n00:02:21.443 --> 00:02:22.931\nyou know what the objectives are,\n\n44\n00:02:22.931 --> 00:02:25.910\nbut if you actually know what\nthe skills are going to be.\n\n45\n00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.898\nSo, the way that they've broken it\ndown is into three separate sections.\n\n46\n00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:33.273\nAnd, you can see where it's really between\n30 to 35% percent in just about every\n\n47\n00:02:33.273 --> 00:02:33.896\narea here.\n\n48\n00:02:33.896 --> 00:02:37.865\nAnd even though we have three areas, there\nis going to be one area that actually has\n\n49\n00:02:37.865 --> 00:02:42.350\na lot more to it, which is gonna be\nthe understanding protocols and services.\n\n50\n00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.810\nSo, this is the one that we\nreally have taken the time and\n\n51\n00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.890\neffort to make sure that we spent\na good portion of our shows on.\n\n52\n00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.310\nTaking a look at the very foundations,\nthe theory and\n\n53\n00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.610\nthe concepts behind networking\nthat we need to understand.\n\n54\n00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.010\nSo, if you haven't been networking\nbefore and you've only used a computer,\n\n55\n00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.222\nperfectly fine, but we needed to\nintroduce you to these concepts.\n\n56\n00:03:03.222 --> 00:03:06.920\nBeginning with the OSI model, which\nis foundational to all of networking,\n\n57\n00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.660\nbecause that's how two computers\ncommunicate with each other.\n\n58\n00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.090\nAnd then we started to take a look,\nof course, at some of the different\n\n59\n00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.900\nprotocols that we use, by far the most\nimportant protocols is our IP addressing.\n\n60\n00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.397\nSo we talk, of course, about the, well,\nthe heart of everything right now,\n\n61\n00:03:22.397 --> 00:03:23.706\nwhich is still IPv4.\n\n62\n00:03:23.706 --> 00:03:27.855\nAnd, what you have to understand\nabout that, as well as what's coming\n\n63\n00:03:27.855 --> 00:03:32.293\nin the immediate pipeline and\nin the future as well, understanding IPv6.\n\n64\n00:03:32.293 --> 00:03:36.353\nNow, these two are foundational to\neverything that we do in networking,\n\n65\n00:03:36.353 --> 00:03:38.510\nas we try and remain connected.\n\n66\n00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.780\nIP addressing is by far one of\nthe most foundational concepts.\n\n67\n00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.770\nFrom that point,\nwe also discuss name resolution.\n\n68\n00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.810\nThe very fact that you and\nI can be able to connect to the Internet,\n\n69\n00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.870\ntype in a name in a browser, and then\nconnect automatically to some machine out\n\n70\n00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.350\nthere in the world, well that's\nactually what we call name resolution.\n\n71\n00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.178\nIt's important that we understand\nthe foundational concepts there as well.\n\n72\n00:04:00.178 --> 00:04:03.920\nAnd then we move on towards\nthe idea of networking services.\n\n73\n00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.630\nNow, this is where we put\nnetworking more in the context\n\n74\n00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.010\nof someone who's gonna be working in the\nIT field when we start actually saying,\n\n75\n00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.500\nhow do computers get their IP addresses?\n\n76\n00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.760\nWhat do we normally find in a network\nthat actually provides this\n\n77\n00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.060\ntype of service for us?\n\n78\n00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.630\nWe talk about the idea of what\na service actually is, and\n\n79\n00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.654\nwhy they're very important to\nus in the networking world, too.\n\n80\n00:04:23.654 --> 00:04:28.356\nAnd then lastly, we do go over\nreally the foundations of well,\n\n81\n00:04:28.356 --> 00:04:32.363\nthe language of the Internet,\nwhat we call TCP/IP.\n\n82\n00:04:32.363 --> 00:04:35.573\nThis is the main protocol that's\nused across the entire Internet.\n\n83\n00:04:35.573 --> 00:04:39.860\nAnd so, we do spend a good deal of time\ntaking a look at not only the protocol\n\n84\n00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.354\nitself, but all the little utilities and\ntools that we also use in networking\n\n85\n00:04:44.354 --> 00:04:48.738\nto help us to troubleshoot configuration\nissues or connectivity issues.\n\n86\n00:04:48.738 --> 00:04:53.380\nWe do take a look at that, and\nwe kind of guide you through that too.\n\n87\n00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.594\nNow from that point,\nI know you're probably saying, Ronnie,\n\n88\n00:04:55.594 --> 00:04:56.667\nwhy did you stop at the bottom?\n\n89\n00:04:56.667 --> 00:04:59.655\nBecause, that's actually where\nthe foundation comes in for us, and\n\n90\n00:04:59.655 --> 00:05:03.000\nthat's why we started there,\ninstead, with our series of shows.\n\n91\n00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.990\nNow we also, of course, talked about\nthe basic hardware that you and\n\n92\n00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.380\nI are gonna find as network\ntechnicians in the field.\n\n93\n00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.060\nIf you end up working for a company,\nyou do need to be able to differentiate\n\n94\n00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.860\nbetween what a router is and\nwhat a switch is, as well, and\n\n95\n00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.578\neven more importantly, the different types\nof media that you'll be dealing with.\n\n96\n00:05:22.578 --> 00:05:24.480\nWhether we've talked about fiber optics or\n\n97\n00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.790\ntwisted pair cable,\nthese are by far some of the most\n\n98\n00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.370\nimportant concepts as far as hardware goes\nthat we need to have an understanding.\n\n99\n00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.950\nBecause if we don't, we will actually use\nwell, hardware that we're not supposed to.\n\n100\n00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.260\nWe will not actually understand the basic\nconcepts, and why they're so important.\n\n101\n00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.130\nBut foundationally,\n\n102\n00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.650\nright, to the building of our networks,\nthese devices are incredibly important.\n\n103\n00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.870\nFrom that point as well,\nwe then covered well,\n\n104\n00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.670\nhow everything fits together in\nthe world that you and I know.\n\n105\n00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.360\nSo we build up from the theory.\n\n106\n00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.660\nWe take a look at the piece of equipment,\nand\n\n107\n00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.960\nnow we talk about well,\nhow do all those things fit together?\n\n108\n00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.510\nAnd the way that they fit together,\nof course, is in what we call LANs or\n\n109\n00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:05.970\nlocal area networks.\n\n110\n00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.550\nA small network, or even a large network,\nthat's actually combined together, so\n\n111\n00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.300\nthat they can actually use\neach other as resources.\n\n112\n00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.650\nAnd, we also talk about\nthe technology that connects multiple\n\n113\n00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.600\nlocal area networks together.\n\n114\n00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.470\nAnd of course, well,\n\n115\n00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.080\none of the foundations today is wireless\nnetworking, the ability to compute\n\n116\n00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:28.160\nwhile on the go without being tethered\nto a single location, as well.\n\n117\n00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.850\nAnd then, some other different terminology\nthat you're likely to encounter,\n\n118\n00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.170\nsuch as Internet, intranet, and extranet.\n\n119\n00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.442\nThese are terminologies that\nyou'll hear all the time.\n\n120\n00:06:37.442 --> 00:06:42.134\nAnd throughout the entire series, we\nemphasize this because as you enter into,\n\n121\n00:06:42.134 --> 00:06:45.308\nmaybe this is a new career for\nyou, you gotta get used to\n\n122\n00:06:45.308 --> 00:06:49.930\njust the basic terminology that\neverybody's gonna be using as well.\n\n123\n00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.267\nSo networking fundamentals is\nreally a key step for you.\n\n124\n00:06:53.267 --> 00:06:56.580\nFor those of you that are actually\ngoing to to pursue something like\n\n125\n00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.957\nyour CompTIA A+ or Network+, that's fine.\n\n126\n00:06:58.957 --> 00:07:01.624\nBut, you're starting right\nhere with the Microsoft MTA,\n\n127\n00:07:01.624 --> 00:07:03.599\nthat Microsoft Technology Associate, and\n\n128\n00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:06.080\nthat shows an incredible\nserious commitment for you.\n\n129\n00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.010\nThat you really wanna get into the IT\nfield if you haven't been in there before,\n\n130\n00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:11.590\nso take the time.\n\n131\n00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.140\nTake a look at this series of shows\nthat we've actually completed here, and\n\n132\n00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.880\nthen go ahead and\ntry your hand at the exam as well.\n\n133\n00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.919\nSo make sure you take a few moments,\nand as you actually do study,\n\n134\n00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:25.404\nyou actually end up seeing that you may\nfind there's certain areas that you\n\n135\n00:07:25.404 --> 00:07:27.082\nactually really are attracted to.\n\n136\n00:07:27.082 --> 00:07:30.140\nAnd that will also help guide\nyour career into the future\n\n137\n00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.574\n>> All right, Ronnie, thank you so\n\n138\n00:07:31.574 --> 00:07:34.907\nmuch for that overview for the MTA,\nthe network fundamentals examination,\n\n139\n00:07:34.907 --> 00:07:37.124\nthe certification that\nthey have prepared for us.\n\n140\n00:07:37.124 --> 00:07:41.086\nAnd hopefully we'll see you\nin the upcoming episodes.\n\n141\n00:07:41.086 --> 00:07:47.069\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
