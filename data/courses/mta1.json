00:00:13.648\nthe Microsoft Technology Associate\nexam number 98366.\n\n4\n00:00:13.648 --> 00:00:17.190\nThat's for your Networking Fundamentals\navailable from Microsoft.\n\n5\n00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.170\nNow, we're gonna do a little overview for\nyou so you know what to expect from\n\n6\n00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.780\nthe exam, what to expect from our videos,\ntry to help you get through that, so\n\n7\n00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.620\nthat you're ready for\nthat testing booth when that day comes.\n\n8\n00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.916\nNow Ronnie, you've done some\nlittle research for us here,\n\n9\n00:00:28.916 --> 00:00:32.126\nand you're gonna show us, walk us through\na little bit of what to expect, correct?\n\n10\n00:00:32.126 --> 00:00:32.850\n>> Right.\n\n11\n00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.440\nWe actually take a look here,\n\n12\n00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.500\nthe Microsoft technology associate,\nis really designed for\n\n13\n00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.590\nthe person that is saying, look,\nI think I wanna get into the IT world.\n\n14\n00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.310\nAnd, one of the fields in the IT\nworld that you really need to at\n\n15\n00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.290\nleast have the fundamentals of\nbefore you go on and try and\n\n16\n00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.380\nmaster the other skills,\nis gonna be networking.\n\n17\n00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.450\nAnd in this particular series of shows,\nwe're gonna introduce you to the most\n\n18\n00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.690\ncommon concepts that you need to know,\nand you definitely need to have\n\n19\n00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.160\na basic understanding of as you\ncontinue on towards your IT career.\n\n20\n00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.480\nAnd so, this is one of these types\nof certifications that shows\n\n21\n00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.910\nany employer out there that you are ready\nfor the challenges that are to come.\n\n22\n00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.738\nIt doesn't necessarily mean\nthat you're an expert.\n\n23\n00:01:12.738 --> 00:01:16.014\nBut what it shows them is that you've\nalready made a commitment to do so, and\n\n24\n00:01:16.014 --> 00:01:19.702\nthat you are actually serious about this\ncommitment, because you've taken the time\n\n25\n00:01:19.702 --> 00:01:22.765\nand the energy to be able to go\nthrough and pass these types of exams.\n\n26\n00:01:22.765 --> 00:01:25.835\nSo, let's go ahead and take a look at\nwhat's normally covered in this exam,\n\n27\n00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:28.565\nand also what we've covered\nin our shows as well.\n\n28\n00:01:28.565 --> 00:01:33.506\nSo, on my computer, I went ahead and\nbrought up from Microsoft's site itself,\n\n29\n00:01:33.506 --> 00:01:36.932\nthe official exam objective\ncertification place too.\n\n30\n00:01:36.932 --> 00:01:40.821\nAnd so if you go and you do a search\nin your favorite search engine for\n\n31\n00:01:40.821 --> 00:01:45.753\nthat exam number, the exam 98-366, you\nwill end up in being able to find on one\n\n32\n00:01:45.753 --> 00:01:50.637\nof those top links here, where it says\nthat exam and the Networking Fundamentals.\n\n33\n00:01:50.637 --> 00:01:52.190\nFor about $115 US,\n\n34\n00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.540\nthat will get you a reservation to\nbe able to take this exam too, and\n\n35\n00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.030\nyou of course, will have this ability\nto either use Certiport or Pearson VUE.\n\n36\n00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.160\nMake sure you actually get ready for\nthat, as well.\n\n37\n00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.710\nAnd, you'll just be scheduling your\ntime is what will end up happening here.\n\n38\n00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.160\nNow as I scroll on down, Microsoft\ndoesn't call out exam objectives,\n\n39\n00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.780\nthey like calling them\nskills measured instead.\n\n40\n00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.470\nAnd what they mean by that is\nthat here is the technology.\n\n41\n00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.318\nHere is what you have to understand.\n\n42\n00:02:18.318 --> 00:02:21.443\nAnd so the only way that we can measure\nthis is not by whether or not, yes,\n\n43\n00:02:21.443 --> 00:02:22.931\nyou know what the objectives are,\n\n44\n00:02:22.931 --> 00:02:25.910\nbut if you actually know what\nthe skills are going to be.\n\n45\n00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.898\nSo, the way that they've broken it\ndown is into three separate sections.\n\n46\n00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:33.273\nAnd, you can see where it's really between\n30 to 35% percent in just about every\n\n47\n00:02:33.273 --> 00:02:33.896\narea here.\n\n48\n00:02:33.896 --> 00:02:37.865\nAnd even though we have three areas, there\nis going to be one area that actually has\n\n49\n00:02:37.865 --> 00:02:42.350\na lot more to it, which is gonna be\nthe understanding protocols and services.\n\n50\n00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.810\nSo, this is the one that we\nreally have taken the time and\n\n51\n00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.890\neffort to make sure that we spent\na good portion of our shows on.\n\n52\n00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.310\nTaking a look at the very foundations,\nthe theory and\n\n53\n00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.610\nthe concepts behind networking\nthat we need to understand.\n\n54\n00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.010\nSo, if you haven't been networking\nbefore and you've only used a computer,\n\n55\n00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.222\nperfectly fine, but we needed to\nintroduce you to these concepts.\n\n56\n00:03:03.222 --> 00:03:06.920\nBeginning with the OSI model, which\nis foundational to all of networking,\n\n57\n00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.660\nbecause that's how two computers\ncommunicate with each other.\n\n58\n00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.090\nAnd then we started to take a look,\nof course, at some of the different\n\n59\n00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.900\nprotocols that we use, by far the most\nimportant protocols is our IP addressing.\n\n60\n00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.397\nSo we talk, of course, about the, well,\nthe heart of everything right now,\n\n61\n00:03:22.397 --> 00:03:23.706\nwhich is still IPv4.\n\n62\n00:03:23.706 --> 00:03:27.855\nAnd, what you have to understand\nabout that, as well as what's coming\n\n63\n00:03:27.855 --> 00:03:32.293\nin the immediate pipeline and\nin the future as well, understanding IPv6.\n\n64\n00:03:32.293 --> 00:03:36.353\nNow, these two are foundational to\neverything that we do in networking,\n\n65\n00:03:36.353 --> 00:03:38.510\nas we try and remain connected.\n\n66\n00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.780\nIP addressing is by far one of\nthe most foundational concepts.\n\n67\n00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.770\nFrom that point,\nwe also discuss name resolution.\n\n68\n00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.810\nThe very fact that you and\nI can be able to connect to the Internet,\n\n69\n00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.870\ntype in a name in a browser, and then\nconnect automatically to some machine out\n\n70\n00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.350\nthere in the world, well that's\nactually what we call name resolution.\n\n71\n00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.178\nIt's important that we understand\nthe foundational concepts there as well.\n\n72\n00:04:00.178 --> 00:04:03.920\nAnd then we move on towards\nthe idea of networking services.\n\n73\n00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.630\nNow, this is where we put\nnetworking more in the context\n\n74\n00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.010\nof someone who's gonna be working in the\nIT field when we start actually saying,\n\n75\n00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.500\nhow do computers get their IP addresses?\n\n76\n00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.760\nWhat do we normally find in a network\nthat actually provides this\n\n77\n00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.060\ntype of service for us?\n\n78\n00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.630\nWe talk about the idea of what\na service actually is, and\n\n79\n00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.654\nwhy they're very important to\nus in the networking world, too.\n\n80\n00:04:23.654 --> 00:04:28.356\nAnd then lastly, we do go over\nreally the foundations of well,\n\n81\n00:04:28.356 --> 00:04:32.363\nthe language of the Internet,\nwhat we call TCP/IP.\n\n82\n00:04:32.363 --> 00:04:35.573\nThis is the main protocol that's\nused across the entire Internet.\n\n83\n00:04:35.573 --> 00:04:39.860\nAnd so, we do spend a good deal of time\ntaking a look at not only the protocol\n\n84\n00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.354\nitself, but all the little utilities and\ntools that we also use in networking\n\n85\n00:04:44.354 --> 00:04:48.738\nto help us to troubleshoot configuration\nissues or connectivity issues.\n\n86\n00:04:48.738 --> 00:04:53.380\nWe do take a look at that, and\nwe kind of guide you through that too.\n\n87\n00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.594\nNow from that point,\nI know you're probably saying, Ronnie,\n\n88\n00:04:55.594 --> 00:04:56.667\nwhy did you stop at the bottom?\n\n89\n00:04:56.667 --> 00:04:59.655\nBecause, that's actually where\nthe foundation comes in for us, and\n\n90\n00:04:59.655 --> 00:05:03.000\nthat's why we started there,\ninstead, with our series of shows.\n\n91\n00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.990\nNow we also, of course, talked about\nthe basic hardware that you and\n\n92\n00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.380\nI are gonna find as network\ntechnicians in the field.\n\n93\n00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.060\nIf you end up working for a company,\nyou do need to be able to differentiate\n\n94\n00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.860\nbetween what a router is and\nwhat a switch is, as well, and\n\n95\n00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.578\neven more importantly, the different types\nof media that you'll be dealing with.\n\n96\n00:05:22.578 --> 00:05:24.480\nWhether we've talked about fiber optics or\n\n97\n00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.790\ntwisted pair cable,\nthese are by far some of the most\n\n98\n00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.370\nimportant concepts as far as hardware goes\nthat we need to have an understanding.\n\n99\n00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.950\nBecause if we don't, we will actually use\nwell, hardware that we're not supposed to.\n\n100\n00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.260\nWe will not actually understand the basic\nconcepts, and why they're so important.\n\n101\n00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.130\nBut foundationally,\n\n102\n00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.650\nright, to the building of our networks,\nthese devices are incredibly important.\n\n103\n00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.870\nFrom that point as well,\nwe then covered well,\n\n104\n00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.670\nhow everything fits together in\nthe world that you and I know.\n\n105\n00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.360\nSo we build up from the theory.\n\n106\n00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.660\nWe take a look at the piece of equipment,\nand\n\n107\n00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.960\nnow we talk about well,\nhow do all those things fit together?\n\n108\n00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.510\nAnd the way that they fit together,\nof course, is in what we call LANs or\n\n109\n00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:05.970\nlocal area networks.\n\n110\n00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.550\nA small network, or even a large network,\nthat's actually combined together, so\n\n111\n00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.300\nthat they can actually use\neach other as resources.\n\n112\n00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.650\nAnd, we also talk about\nthe technology that connects multiple\n\n113\n00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.600\nlocal area networks together.\n\n114\n00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.470\nAnd of course, well,\n\n115\n00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.080\none of the foundations today is wireless\nnetworking, the ability to compute\n\n116\n00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:28.160\nwhile on the go without being tethered\nto a single location, as well.\n\n117\n00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.850\nAnd then, some other different terminology\nthat you're likely to encounter,\n\n118\n00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.170\nsuch as Internet, intranet, and extranet.\n\n119\n00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.442\nThese are terminologies that\nyou'll hear all the time.\n\n120\n00:06:37.442 --> 00:06:42.134\nAnd throughout the entire series, we\nemphasize this because as you enter into,\n\n121\n00:06:42.134 --> 00:06:45.308\nmaybe this is a new career for\nyou, you gotta get used to\n\n122\n00:06:45.308 --> 00:06:49.930\njust the basic terminology that\neverybody's gonna be using as well.\n\n123\n00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.267\nSo networking fundamentals is\nreally a key step for you.\n\n124\n00:06:53.267 --> 00:06:56.580\nFor those of you that are actually\ngoing to to pursue something like\n\n125\n00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.957\nyour CompTIA A+ or Network+, that's fine.\n\n126\n00:06:58.957 --> 00:07:01.624\nBut, you're starting right\nhere with the Microsoft MTA,\n\n127\n00:07:01.624 --> 00:07:03.599\nthat Microsoft Technology Associate, and\n\n128\n00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:06.080\nthat shows an incredible\nserious commitment for you.\n\n129\n00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.010\nThat you really wanna get into the IT\nfield if you haven't been in there before,\n\n130\n00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:11.590\nso take the time.\n\n131\n00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.140\nTake a look at this series of shows\nthat we've actually completed here, and\n\n132\n00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.880\nthen go ahead and\ntry your hand at the exam as well.\n\n133\n00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.919\nSo make sure you take a few moments,\nand as you actually do study,\n\n134\n00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:25.404\nyou actually end up seeing that you may\nfind there's certain areas that you\n\n135\n00:07:25.404 --> 00:07:27.082\nactually really are attracted to.\n\n136\n00:07:27.082 --> 00:07:30.140\nAnd that will also help guide\nyour career into the future\n\n137\n00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.574\n>> All right, Ronnie, thank you so\n\n138\n00:07:31.574 --> 00:07:34.907\nmuch for that overview for the MTA,\nthe network fundamentals examination,\n\n139\n00:07:34.907 --> 00:07:37.124\nthe certification that\nthey have prepared for us.\n\n140\n00:07:37.124 --> 00:07:41.086\nAnd hopefully we'll see you\nin the upcoming episodes.\n\n141\n00:07:41.086 --> 00:07:47.069\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:16.150\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.210\nHere with me in the studio today, well\nit's none other than my good friend, Mr.\n\n5\n00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.790\nRonnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:20.800\nHow's it going today, Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.260\n>> It is going great today.\n\n8\n00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.240\nToday we are taking a look\nat network fundamentals.\n\n9\n00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.760\nSo, Daniel, you and I are putting the fun\nback into networking fundamentals.\n\n10\n00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.050\nI know, it's not really a great pun at\nall, but that's what we're trying to do.\n\n11\n00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.990\nNow, we're preparing for that exam for\n\n12\n00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.130\nour Microsoft Technology Associate,\nthe 98366 exam.\n\n13\n00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.310\nAnd so we're taking a look at just\nmaking sure that we understand\n\n14\n00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.940\nsome of the basic concepts.\n\n15\n00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.540\nNow you need to understand, if you are\ngoing to get into the world of Microsoft\n\n16\n00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.600\nservers and of course, networking, and so\nthat is what we are beginning with today.\n\n17\n00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.360\nAnd Daniel, today, we really talk about\nreally the fundamental itself, right?\n\n18\n00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.970\n>> That's right.\nThis is the building blocks of networking.\n\n19\n00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.940\nWe're gonna start you from the beginning.\n\n20\n00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.320\nHow does all this stuff work?\n\n21\n00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.970\nIs it voodoo?\n\n22\n00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:04.630\nIs it witchcraft?\n\n23\n00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:05.220\nWe don't know.\n\n24\n00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.165\nNo, actually we do know.\n\n25\n00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:09.210\n[LAUGH] We have a pretty good\nunderstanding of how computer\n\n26\n00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.120\nnetworks work.\n\n27\n00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.000\nHopefully by the end of this episode you\nas well will have a better understanding\n\n28\n00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.390\nso that you can figure out, oh, now I see\nhow computers connect to each other, how\n\n29\n00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.150\nthey talk, the language they speak, and\nhow they deliver messages to each other.\n\n30\n00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.350\nAnd that's basically\nthe structure of a network.\n\n31\n00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.970\nNow Ronnie, you're gonna start us off\nwith probably the most fundamental thing\n\n32\n00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.160\nwhen it comes to networking right?\n\n33\n00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.370\n>> Right and we're gonna take a look\nat how in the world two computers\n\n34\n00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.440\nreally begin the process of communication,\nis what we're taking a look at.\n\n35\n00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.000\nAnd you've gotta remember something.\n\n36\n00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000\nUnlike humans, which learn how to\ncommunicate by simply observing and\n\n37\n00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.300\nthen mimicking sound and then begin\nto try and make words out of it.\n\n38\n00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.500\nWell, computers can't do that.\n\n39\n00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.320\nI know that sounds strange.\n\n40\n00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.310\nBut they really cannot take that time and\ncommunication becomes intuitive to them.\n\n41\n00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.120\nSo we need to teach it to\nthem is what we need to do.\n\n42\n00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.150\nNow the problem that we\nhad in early computing,\n\n43\n00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.100\nand when we started talking about\nnetworking, was fairly simple.\n\n44\n00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.180\nEverybody and their mother thought it\nshould actually be done differently.\n\n45\n00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.500\nNow when I say that, everybody and\ntheir mother, who am I talking about?\n\n46\n00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.020\nWell, hardware vendors, right?\n\n47\n00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.010\nPeople that wanted to be able to have\nthe communication process go on between\n\n48\n00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.000\ntwo computers.\n\n49\n00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.990\nWell, if they were hardware vendors,\n\n50\n00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.590\nthey would come up with their\nown model and networking.\n\n51\n00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.060\nAnd that did work.\n\n52\n00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.410\nAs long as your computers were\nactually based in the same hardware,\n\n53\n00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.490\nthey would follow the same rules and\nthe same protocols and\n\n54\n00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.860\nthe same language to be able to\ncommunicate and do what they needed to.\n\n55\n00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.940\nBut then if you needed to add in\nadditional equipment, let's say from\n\n56\n00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.540\nanother vendor instead, well then\nyou started running into problems.\n\n57\n00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.860\nAnd when we talk about running\ninto problems at that point,\n\n58\n00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.340\nnow it's like saying okay, hey, I need my\nnetwork, my stuff, to communicate with\n\n59\n00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.770\nthis other vendor stuff, and now they're\nlike, I don't think that we can do that.\n\n60\n00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.600\nAnd the customer doesn't understand,\nand what he says is, why?\n\n61\n00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.445\nWhy can't you just make this device\ncommunicate with that device?\n\n62\n00:02:56.445 --> 00:02:59.875\nAnd it comes down to the very fact,\nwell, they use a different protocol.\n\n63\n00:02:59.875 --> 00:03:01.145\nNow, what is that about?\n\n64\n00:03:01.145 --> 00:03:03.765\nThat's like a different language,\nis what it's about.\n\n65\n00:03:03.765 --> 00:03:06.455\nSo what started to happen,\nthen, in networking and\n\n66\n00:03:06.455 --> 00:03:09.655\nin the world of hardware\nnetworking was simple.\n\n67\n00:03:09.655 --> 00:03:11.025\nThey started realizing something.\n\n68\n00:03:11.025 --> 00:03:14.685\nAs long as they keep these their own\nproprietary way of doing networking,\n\n69\n00:03:14.685 --> 00:03:16.780\nin other words,\nof establishing communication,\n\n70\n00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.450\nbetween two devices, they could grow\nthe industry as long as they, you know,\n\n71\n00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.280\neverybody needed only their equipment.\n\n72\n00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.090\nBut just like everybody else, just like\nall the other hardware vendors, there\n\n73\n00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.110\nwere certain things they were good at,\ncertain things that they weren't good at.\n\n74\n00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.490\nCertain things that other companies\nwere really good at, but not, you know,\n\n75\n00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.020\ngood at what they were doing, and so\nthen you start having specialization and\n\n76\n00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.630\nthe problem is they couldn't meld together\nand make the communication process happen.\n\n77\n00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.000\nSo, of course, then, we're only in the\nearly 80s and probably even before that,\n\n78\n00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.910\nand they started saying we need\na unified networking model.\n\n79\n00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.300\nIn other words, we need everybody to agree\non how the process of communication is to\n\n80\n00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.110\nhappen between machines that\nare gonna be networked together.\n\n81\n00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.510\nAnd when they started to think about that,\nthey need to actually understand how this\n\n82\n00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.120\nwould work, and then they needed everybody\nto agree on how this would work here.\n\n83\n00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.060\nAnd so it started to happen.\n\n84\n00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.100\nCompanies started following what they\ncalled an open system model, and\n\n85\n00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.130\nthat meant that look, nobody's actually\ngoing to claim responsibility for\n\n86\n00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.690\nthis, but here it is.\n\n87\n00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.670\nWhat's going to happen are people\nare actually going to say, look,\n\n88\n00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:19.970\nhere's what we want to do.\n\n89\n00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.320\nWe want everybody to design\ntheir equipment around this.\n\n90\n00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.410\nAnd when they did it was\nan incredible financial benefit.\n\n91\n00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.980\nIt was an incredible\ncommunication benefit.\n\n92\n00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.275\nBecause now, vendors could actually talk,\nor different vendors, excuse me,\n\n93\n00:04:31.275 --> 00:04:34.424\ncould actually have their equipment\ntalk with other people's equipment and\n\n94\n00:04:34.424 --> 00:04:37.280\nnot sacrifice the capabilities\nthat they were looking for.\n\n95\n00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.290\nSo it is a great beginning\nto that process, right?\n\n96\n00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.310\nEstablishing common ground for\nall the equipment.\n\n97\n00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.080\nAnd the reason why it's actually so\ngreat is that even now,\n\n98\n00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.360\neven 30 years later,\na little bit longer than that and\n\n99\n00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.290\neven longer than that, when they realized\nthat that's what they needed to happen,\n\n100\n00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.990\nis still kind of the foundation of\nall the networking that we do today.\n\n101\n00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.730\nSo it's very important to them if we\nare to understand networking then we\n\n102\n00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.380\nhave to understand that model.\n\n103\n00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.090\nAnd that model is what is\ncalled the OSI model or\n\n104\n00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.440\nthe Open Systems Interconnection model.\n\n105\n00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.670\nLet me show you a diagram of\nwhat I'm talking about here.\n\n106\n00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.510\nSo, I went ahead and made a simple diagram\nand this particular diagram, here it is.\n\n107\n00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.100\nYou generally here about it\ncalled the OSI Model, and\n\n108\n00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.270\nthis is the model, this is the one that\nall those vendors and everybody agreed to,\n\n109\n00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.000\nthat when they build networking equipment,\nit's gonna follow this model.\n\n110\n00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.680\nSo that regardless of who the vendor is,\nthey're going to go ahead and\n\n111\n00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.570\nthis is what they're gonna use.\n\n112\n00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.320\nNow, when we start talking about the basic\ncommunication and what happens, right?\n\n113\n00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.080\nWhen the computers are networked together,\n\n114\n00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.670\nthey have to be able\nto do a lot of things.\n\n115\n00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.310\nOne, the data actually has to be able to\nget ready to be sent on the network and\n\n116\n00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.670\nthen of course, processed and\nsent on the network.\n\n117\n00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.380\nAnd then actually understand where it's\ngoing and then also processed again.\n\n118\n00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.370\nSo, this Open System Interconnection\nmodel then, they broke it\n\n119\n00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.900\ndown into seven layers, so every computer\nthat sends data out on the network.\n\n120\n00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.830\nBut when they do so, the data is\nprocessed through these seven layers.\n\n121\n00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.260\nAnd it actually happens when\nthey're sending outbound.\n\n122\n00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:15.700\nIt processes it from the top down through\nthe bottom, is what ends up going on here.\n\n123\n00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.010\nNow, you actually end up\nmemorizing this in networking.\n\n124\n00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.600\nYou really do.\n\n125\n00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.280\nAfter using and even starting to\nnetwork computers together, when\n\n126\n00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.830\nyou start troubleshooting, when you start\nactually understanding what happens on\n\n127\n00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.790\neach of these layers, it begins to make a\nlittle bit more sense of what's going on.\n\n128\n00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.210\nSo, this is what we want to understand.\n\n129\n00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:38.550\nNow, if I were you as well, in getting\nready for the MTA exam too, I would\n\n130\n00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.500\nmake sure that I memorize these seven\nmodels too and so that we understand it.\n\n131\n00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.150\nNow sometimes, you also hear them called\nby different layer numbers, as well.\n\n132\n00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.750\nSo you may hear the term Layer 1 and Layer\n2, let me see if I can type that in here.\n\n133\n00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.110\nLet's see, Layer 1, and then we can\nactually duplicate that multiple times.\n\n134\n00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.900\nSo you may also hear the term layer.\n\n135\n00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.190\nNow that's actually not Layer 1, that's\nLayer 7, as we process from the top down.\n\n136\n00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.360\nNow I'm just going to repeat\nthis multiple times here.\n\n137\n00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.805\nAnd so this one would be Layer 6.\n\n138\n00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.475\nAnd then,\nwe can actually go down here to Layer 5.\n\n139\n00:07:14.475 --> 00:07:17.240\nOops.\n\n140\n00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:17.840\nWell, maybe.\n\n141\n00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.270\n[LAUGH] I'll get that out of the way here.\n\n142\n00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:21.960\nThat's what I get for\ntrying to do it on the fly.\n\n143\n00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.460\nSo fasten layer five, and Layer 4.\n\n144\n00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.270\nSo you might hear both\nof those terminologies\n\n145\n00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:29.830\nas you actually start work with it.\n\n146\n00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.340\nAnd they really mean the same thing,even\n\n147\n00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.640\nthough people call them\nby different names.\n\n148\n00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.865\nAnd then last one here is Layer 1.\n\n149\n00:07:35.865 --> 00:07:38.660\nI'm gonna copy and\npaste that one down here too,\n\n150\n00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.755\nand that will actually\nget us down this way.\n\n151\n00:07:41.755 --> 00:07:45.741\nSo what in the world is this saying\nwhen we start off with the process of\n\n152\n00:07:45.741 --> 00:07:48.378\ncommunication and\ndoing this in this model?\n\n153\n00:07:48.378 --> 00:07:52.322\nAs computers need to be able to\ncommunicate with a different machine\n\n154\n00:07:52.322 --> 00:07:56.403\nsomewhere on the network, well what\nwe actually have to begin with and\n\n155\n00:07:56.403 --> 00:08:00.225\nunderstand as far as the OSI model Is,\nwhat is a current, right?\n\n156\n00:08:00.225 --> 00:08:05.175\nSo, when I need to send data, let's take\nfor an example that what I need to do is\n\n157\n00:08:05.175 --> 00:08:09.060\nto get an e-mail message to you somehow,\nsome way.\n\n158\n00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.640\nWell, there has to be some\ninteraction between me and\n\n159\n00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.320\nthe software that I'm using and\nthen that software has to say,\n\n160\n00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.890\nlook, I am now ready to take that\ninformation and send it out.\n\n161\n00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:21.850\nIf it just exists in the form that it\nis on my computer it is not ready for\n\n162\n00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:22.860\nthe network at all.\n\n163\n00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:23.460\nRight?\nSo\n\n164\n00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.580\nthe data that you see on the screen\nas you're typing an email\n\n165\n00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.610\ndoesn't mean that it's\nready to be transmitted,\n\n166\n00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:31.120\nit doesn't mean that it's ready for\nthe network at all.\n\n167\n00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:36.062\nSo what the application layer says is that\nafter I'm finished typing out my email,\n\n168\n00:08:36.062 --> 00:08:40.296\nit says hey, now this piece of data\nneeds to be prepared to be put out onto\n\n169\n00:08:40.296 --> 00:08:41.800\nthe network somewhere.\n\n170\n00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:42.508\nOkay?\n\n171\n00:08:42.508 --> 00:08:46.339\nSo when it does that,\nit hits the application layer first.\n\n172\n00:08:46.339 --> 00:08:49.549\nThe application layer says,\nyes here's this data and\n\n173\n00:08:49.549 --> 00:08:52.144\nit's trying actually to get sent out here.\n\n174\n00:08:52.144 --> 00:08:53.645\nAnd what happens is it says,\n\n175\n00:08:53.645 --> 00:08:57.588\nthat application is an email application\nthat is trying to send that out and\n\n176\n00:08:57.588 --> 00:09:02.140\nsaying, I need to prepare whatever it\nis this message is, to get sent out.\n\n177\n00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.890\nNow, when it does that, it also brings\nit down to the presentation layer.\n\n178\n00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.080\nPresentation is about formatting.\n\n179\n00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.820\nWhat is happening now, right?\n\n180\n00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.960\nIs that, if we just put that\npiece of data out there, well,\n\n181\n00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.880\nwe don't know what it's actually\ngonna look like on the other side.\n\n182\n00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.730\nSo the presentation layer\nallows us to be able to say,\n\n183\n00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:22.220\nhere's what this piece of data\nshould look like on the other side.\n\n184\n00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:23.430\nSo it formats it.\n\n185\n00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.637\nIf this was an image, you might here\npeople talking about formatting as\n\n186\n00:09:27.637 --> 00:09:31.982\na .png file or a .jpeg, if it was some\ntype of word processing document,\n\n187\n00:09:31.982 --> 00:09:34.529\nlike a word document, it might be a .doc.\n\n188\n00:09:34.529 --> 00:09:37.883\nIt's all this about the proper formatting\nso that when it gets opened up on\n\n189\n00:09:37.883 --> 00:09:41.777\nthe other side, the computer just goes all\nright, we're associating this file with\n\n190\n00:09:41.777 --> 00:09:45.070\nthis particular application\nis what we start to do.\n\n191\n00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.820\nAnd then you come down\nto the session layer and\n\n192\n00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:53.640\nthe session layer is trying to ensure that\nwe actually establish a communication.\n\n193\n00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.654\nWe can then maintain that communication\nbetween this computer and that computer on\n\n194\n00:09:57.654 --> 00:10:01.574\nthe other side, and also it breaks down\nat the end if we're transferring a file.\n\n195\n00:10:01.574 --> 00:10:02.430\nNow what does that means?\n\n196\n00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:06.840\nIt means when we transfer the file, the\nother side knows where it's coming from.\n\n197\n00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.520\nIt knows whether or not there's actually\nmultiple pieces that need to come in or\n\n198\n00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.980\nnot and then it says,\nhey, at the end of it,\n\n199\n00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:16.200\nI know to close this session out if\nwe don't have any more data to send.\n\n200\n00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:21.370\nAnd then, as we are also,\nsending that data outbound as well,\n\n201\n00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:25.520\nthe transport layer helps us to\nbreak it up into manageable chunks.\n\n202\n00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.980\nWhen we start sending data\nout across our network\n\n203\n00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.150\nthey do limit the size of\nhow big things can be.\n\n204\n00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:32.710\nIt's just like a UPS package.\n\n205\n00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:34.000\nI know that sounds strange, but\n\n206\n00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.220\nthere's a limitation in how big a UPS\npackage can go on those trucks.\n\n207\n00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:41.470\nSo if you have something bigger, they tell\nyou you can't send this in one big size,\n\n208\n00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:43.990\nyou can divide it up\ninto multiple chunks so\n\n209\n00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:45.650\nthat it can be handled\na little bit better.\n\n210\n00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:47.880\nWell, the transport\nlayer does exactly that.\n\n211\n00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:52.200\nIt helps to manage that process and\neven does error correction for\n\n212\n00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.550\nus too, such as labeling those\npackages that are actually gonna\n\n213\n00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.620\nbe combined back together at some point.\n\n214\n00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.189\nAnd then once we have that,\n\n215\n00:10:59.189 --> 00:11:03.156\nthe data is now prepared to be put\nout onto network to a point, right?\n\n216\n00:11:03.156 --> 00:11:06.964\nIn other words, that data is now kind\nof wrapped up in what it needs to be\n\n217\n00:11:06.964 --> 00:11:10.030\nencapsulated is a term\nthat you'll also hear.\n\n218\n00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:14.620\nThat it says look, now this data is\nready except for a few other things.\n\n219\n00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.790\nWhen my computer now says all right,\nhere's data that's ready gone on\n\n220\n00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:22.220\nthe network, we now need to be able\nto say where the data came from and\n\n221\n00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.690\nwhere the data is ultimately going.\n\n222\n00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:27.580\nAnd that's what the network layer does.\n\n223\n00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:31.750\nAnd then from that point, once we actually\nrealize where the source of it is from,\n\n224\n00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:36.300\nand the destination, the data link\nlayer provides the physical pathway.\n\n225\n00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.670\nIn other words the device to\ndevice to device transport.\n\n226\n00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:44.470\nIn other words the actual movement of the\ndata along the path to its destination and\n\n227\n00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.820\nfinally, the physical layer is just that.\n\n228\n00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.760\nIt literally is the wire\nthat it goes across, and\n\n229\n00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.910\nit's actually gonna be read as well.\n\n230\n00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:57.180\nSo when we start talking about that\nbasic communication, every computer\n\n231\n00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:02.300\nhas to be able to do this when it is\ngoing to send it out onto the network.\n\n232\n00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:06.430\nSo this model is by far the most\nimportant model that we have.\n\n233\n00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:10.800\nSo now, regardless of who the equipment\nmanufacturer is on the other end,\n\n234\n00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.170\nif they've built their hardware to do this\nsame model, well that means that they can\n\n235\n00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:19.360\nprocess them at the physical layer,\nthe data link layer, network, transport,\n\n236\n00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.600\nsession, presentation, and\napplication layer as well.\n\n237\n00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.420\nSo it allows them to go, okay,\nI understand this communication process\n\n238\n00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:31.310\nbecause it was sent in that format,\nI can read that format and I can actually\n\n239\n00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:36.160\nhave it come all back in and that's\nanother term that you also hear too.\n\n240\n00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.930\nSo you tend to see this as\nbeing a theoretical approach.\n\n241\n00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:43.930\nSo now when you have not only\nhardware vendors doing it,\n\n242\n00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:47.150\nyou now start having people that\nare building applications and\n\n243\n00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:51.710\nbuilding protocols that are also\ndesigned to follow this model, as well.\n\n244\n00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:55.190\nThe reason why that's also important\nis because, now, it doesn't matter\n\n245\n00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:59.590\nwho you buy the application from, because\nthey built it to support this model.\n\n246\n00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:02.360\nProtocols under use such\nas email protocols,\n\n247\n00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.920\nit doesn't matter what\nemail program that you use.\n\n248\n00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.650\nIt say, look,\nthat protocol's designed to work here.\n\n249\n00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:11.290\nThe benefit behind that as well,\nis if I design something to work,\n\n250\n00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:12.830\nlet's say the presentation layer,\n\n251\n00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:16.090\nthere's a brand new format that\nnobody else on the planet has seen.\n\n252\n00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:17.714\nWell, the presentation layer says,\n\n253\n00:13:17.714 --> 00:13:21.630\nthat's fine as long as the other side\nunderstands what this format actually is.\n\n254\n00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:23.807\nWe're good to go.\nIt doesn't matter if no other machine\n\n255\n00:13:23.807 --> 00:13:26.759\nknows about it,\nthey can just influence this one layer and\n\n256\n00:13:26.759 --> 00:13:29.891\nwe don't have to rebuild the whole\nthing again from scratch,\n\n257\n00:13:29.891 --> 00:13:32.230\njust because you change something.\n\n258\n00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:35.290\nIt's a very layered approach,\nand that's what makes it nice and\n\n259\n00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:38.020\nvery modular, I guess is the proper term,\n\n260\n00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:41.730\nand allows that basic communication\nprocess to begin to happen.\n\n261\n00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.640\n>> Yeah, it's all about standardization.\n\n262\n00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.300\nWhen it comes to the OSI model, right?\n\n263\n00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.930\nThat was the whole purpose behind it.\n\n264\n00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:49.800\nRonnie's been hitting this pretty hard.\n\n265\n00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.850\nIf I create a device and I want it to\ntalk to other people that create the same\n\n266\n00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:57.910\nkind of devices, well, we're gonna need\nto have that same common language, and\n\n267\n00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:01.330\nthat's why when, I remember when I first\nstarted learning about the OSI model.\n\n268\n00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.780\nI looked at it and I said wow,\nthis is a lot of information.\n\n269\n00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:08.070\nIt seems a little like I'm\ndrinking from a firehouse here but\n\n270\n00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:10.560\nI was really making it too complicated.\n\n271\n00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.336\nIf you just understand that\neach layer has a device or\n\n272\n00:14:13.336 --> 00:14:16.490\nsome sort of software something\nthat works on that layer and\n\n273\n00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:19.726\nI just gotta know which ones are which and\nwhen that happens.\n\n274\n00:14:19.726 --> 00:14:21.038\nSome of them use multiple layers,\n\n275\n00:14:21.038 --> 00:14:23.082\nsome of them use only a little\nbit of the layers right?\n\n276\n00:14:23.082 --> 00:14:25.896\nAnd it doesn't use all of them\nmaybe just a few of them, but\n\n277\n00:14:25.896 --> 00:14:29.805\nif I understand what each layer does then\nif I ever have trouble with the network,\n\n278\n00:14:29.805 --> 00:14:32.260\nI can figure out where it's breaking down.\n\n279\n00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.120\nIf it's on the physical layer,\nmaybe that's the wire itself.\n\n280\n00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.557\nOkay, remember it's the physical\nmedia that is transporting the data.\n\n281\n00:14:38.557 --> 00:14:42.570\nIf it's a layer two or layer three,\nor the network layer, or\n\n282\n00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:46.205\nthe data link layer,\nunrespectively, I guess it is.\n\n283\n00:14:46.205 --> 00:14:48.627\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Layer two would be the data link layer,\n\n284\n00:14:48.627 --> 00:14:50.987\nand layer three is the transport,\nor the network layer.\n\n285\n00:14:50.987 --> 00:14:51.706\n>> Network layer.\n\n286\n00:14:51.706 --> 00:14:52.670\n>> I always get that confused.\n\n287\n00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.050\nSee how easy it is?\n\n288\n00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:55.770\nIf you start figuring that out,\nyou start to see.\n\n289\n00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:59.895\nAnd now when we talk about networks,\nthat's why we tend to stay in the bottom\n\n290\n00:14:59.895 --> 00:15:04.100\nlayers is because network devices they\ntend to stay in those bottom layers.\n\n291\n00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.940\nSo we'll be there quite a bit but,\n\n292\n00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:10.190\nyou do need to just get this down\nin your head, figure out okay,\n\n293\n00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:14.260\nlayer one is the application layer,\nsession layer, on down, all the way.\n\n294\n00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.800\nMake sure you get all of those in\nthe right layer cuz they might ask you,\n\n295\n00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.700\nwhat is layer one?\n\n296\n00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.970\nOr they just wanna ask you what\nare the layers of the OSI model,\n\n297\n00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.150\nso, you've gotta be\nable to spit those out.\n\n298\n00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:25.857\nUnfortunately, this is\nsomething you probably have to\n\n299\n00:15:25.857 --> 00:15:26.981\ncommit to memory though, right?.\n\n300\n00:15:26.981 --> 00:15:29.862\n>> It really is.\nIt's something that you want to commit to\n\n301\n00:15:29.862 --> 00:15:32.361\nmemory now and for\nthe sake of the exam, but\n\n302\n00:15:32.361 --> 00:15:36.320\nit is one of the most useful things\nthat you can commit to memory, for\n\n303\n00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.515\nanything that you tend to want\nto do in the IT field, and\n\n304\n00:15:39.515 --> 00:15:44.100\nthat is because networking itself is\nthe heart of where IT actually is now, and\n\n305\n00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.220\nwhere it's going into the future.\n\n306\n00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:51.064\nSo by knowing this, you have a good grasp\non at least how end devices are supposed\n\n307\n00:15:51.064 --> 00:15:52.740\nto be able to communicate.\n\n308\n00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:55.270\nNow Daniel brings up a very\nimportant point as well.\n\n309\n00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:58.558\nIn the very fact that we tend\nto focus in in networking,\n\n310\n00:15:58.558 --> 00:16:01.250\nwhen we start just about networking.\n\n311\n00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:04.240\nWe're really talking about how\nthe data move from this machine\n\n312\n00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:08.030\nover to this machine over here,\ninside of that network.\n\n313\n00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:13.160\nAnd so even though the majority, actually\nall of this happens on one machine, right.\n\n314\n00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.210\nAs we're sending down outbound.\n\n315\n00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:19.930\nIt's really these lower three layers\nhere that we do focus in a lot on,\n\n316\n00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:21.950\nbecause that's actually responsible for\n\n317\n00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:27.040\nthe delivery of the data from\nthe sending machine to the destination.\n\n318\n00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.830\nRemember that the other layers\nthat we have above this\n\n319\n00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:35.060\nare really focusing in on preparing\nthe data to get ready to be transmitted.\n\n320\n00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:38.130\nBut those lower layers\nare actually designed to, well,\n\n321\n00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:41.600\nget the data,\nactually transmit it across that network.\n\n322\n00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:45.330\nSo you also tended to see at\nthe same time another model.\n\n323\n00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.000\nLet me make sure I choose\nthe right tab before I mislead us.\n\n324\n00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:48.861\n>> Get your cheaters on.\n\n325\n00:16:48.861 --> 00:16:49.793\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right, yep, I do.\n\n326\n00:16:49.793 --> 00:16:51.883\nI have to actually make sure I see.\n\n327\n00:16:51.883 --> 00:16:55.850\nYou might also see something that\nwe call the TCP/IP model, as well.\n\n328\n00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:59.710\nAnd here, you can see kind of\na little bit of a difference, right?\n\n329\n00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:03.940\nSo, where as the OSI Model breaks\nthis apart very granularly, right.\n\n330\n00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.740\nThat means in detail where\nyou have seven layers.\n\n331\n00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:10.160\nNotice that the OSI Model is\nnow actually four layer, or\n\n332\n00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:14.430\nthe, not OSI Model,\nthe TCP/IP Model is four layers.\n\n333\n00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:17.030\nNow, even that is changing over time.\n\n334\n00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:20.240\nSo Microsoft still recognizes\nit as being a four layer model.\n\n335\n00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.090\nBut you read in the latest Cisco books,\n\n336\n00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:24.700\nthis has become a five\nlayer model now too.\n\n337\n00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.610\nSo you're starting to see some differences\nbetween vendors, and how they're\n\n338\n00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:32.050\nactually starting to look at it, but\nat this point, this is what you see.\n\n339\n00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:35.550\nNow when we mentioned that, remember\nwhat Daniel has just talked about,\n\n340\n00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:38.710\nthat we tend to stick in those lower four,\nI think I said three layers, but\n\n341\n00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:40.480\nit's the lower four layers, right?\n\n342\n00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:44.080\nThe transport layer of the internet\nwhich is the same as networking and\n\n343\n00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.990\nthen the data link and the physical layer.\n\n344\n00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.320\nWell notice how these\nare actually separated out and\n\n345\n00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:52.420\nin the TCP/IP model they just\ngroup them together up here.\n\n346\n00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:56.180\nIt doesn't mean that those\ndevices that use this model.\n\n347\n00:17:56.180 --> 00:18:00.330\nAren't really concerned about the data\nitself, but it means that they are, what?\n\n348\n00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:01.980\nThey're putting more emphasis on what?\n\n349\n00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.440\nOn the delivery side of this.\n\n350\n00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:09.780\nAnd so when you implement networking, when\nyou use networking devices like routers\n\n351\n00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:13.390\nand different devices, and of course,\nPCs and servers and stuff.\n\n352\n00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:17.580\nWell, really what is important at that\npoint as far as getting the data is gonna\n\n353\n00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:22.530\nbe these lower three layers, so the OSI\nModel, even though it was a competing\n\n354\n00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:28.200\nnetworking model, today this is not\nactually used in any production network.\n\n355\n00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.910\nThe OSI Model, I know, but\nRonnie, you just spent 10 minutes\n\n356\n00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:34.200\ndescribing this OSI Model and\ntelling us how important it is.\n\n357\n00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.960\nAnd that's because it is how we used\nto describe networking, period.\n\n358\n00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.870\nSo it's now called a reference model.\n\n359\n00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:44.790\nAnd the true implementation\nof it is this TCP/IP Model.\n\n360\n00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:47.330\nI know that sounds strange, but\nthat's just the way it goes.\n\n361\n00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.740\nSo you have to get used to\nthat weird terminology.\n\n362\n00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:52.070\nAnd we're talking about\nthe actual implementation,\n\n363\n00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:54.220\nthis is the model that\ngenerally is followed.\n\n364\n00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:57.860\nWhen we talk about describing it and where\nthings break down and where things can\n\n365\n00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:02.210\nactually come back together we're now\ntalking about this OSI Model instead.\n\n366\n00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:05.010\nThey really do accomplish the same things.\n\n367\n00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.500\nAnd the comparison to some of\nthe other models that were out there.\n\n368\n00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.310\nThese are pretty much the two.\n\n369\n00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:11.250\nAnd even though the OSI Model,\nlike we said,\n\n370\n00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:14.140\nis not really implemented,\nit is by far the most described.\n\n371\n00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:17.770\nYou tend to not hear a lot about\nTCP/IP in its description and\n\n372\n00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:20.940\neverything because it really\ndoes tend to do the same things.\n\n373\n00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:25.420\nSo, you do have an unusual\nway that this happened.\n\n374\n00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:30.340\nSo it's just how unusual\nthat this happened here,\n\n375\n00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:33.620\nwhere now in the OSI Model,\nsomebody tried to implement it.\n\n376\n00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:34.910\nIt never really caught on.\n\n377\n00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:38.140\nTCP was implemented,\nit just caught on like wildfire.\n\n378\n00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:39.180\nAnd that's the way it is.\n\n379\n00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:42.000\nBut yet everybody still sticks\nto this model in describing it.\n\n380\n00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.430\nAnd more than likely it's because\nit's part of that open system.\n\n381\n00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:45.120\nRight?\n\n382\n00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.510\nIt's not really proprietary.\n\n383\n00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:48.758\nIt's not really designed\nto be anybody's one model.\n\n384\n00:19:48.758 --> 00:19:49.824\nBut yet,\n\n385\n00:19:49.824 --> 00:19:54.330\nTCP/IP really had its foundation from the\ndepartment of defense at some point, and\n\n386\n00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:57.270\nit just changed its name after awhile,\nbecause it was no longer just there.\n\n387\n00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.200\nJust become more implemented worldwide.\n\n388\n00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.520\nSo two competing models that\none is actually just used for\n\n389\n00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.230\ndescribing, one's actually used for\n\n390\n00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:10.060\nthe implementation on devices, inside\nof applications, inside of everything.\n\n391\n00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.568\nThat's what you also tend to see, the way\nthat it's built is that way instead.\n\n392\n00:20:12.568 --> 00:20:13.333\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n393\n00:20:13.333 --> 00:20:15.660\nI'm sure the DOD tends to get their way.\n\n394\n00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:20.090\nSo their name and\nconventions will probably pass muster.\n\n395\n00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:24.040\nNow Ronnie, we've talked a lot about,\nin a theory basically, how does this work?\n\n396\n00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.510\nLet's give you the good understanding.\n\n397\n00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:27.560\nLet's do some more\npractical understanding.\n\n398\n00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.820\nWhat's some things that we can\nlook at that helps us understand\n\n399\n00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.330\nwhat's the difference between the layers.\n\n400\n00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:34.050\n>> Sure.\nWhen we start taking a look at that,\n\n401\n00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:36.410\nwe want to take a look at\nwhat works on each layer,\n\n402\n00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:37.970\nis what we're really focusing in on.\n\n403\n00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:41.150\nAnd so I went ahead and\nalso tried to do this.\n\n404\n00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:43.700\nLet's see if I can get that\nout of the weeds here.\n\n405\n00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.710\nSo that we can see it a little bit better.\n\n406\n00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:49.180\nSo I want to talk about protocols, devices\nand application and what functions on\n\n407\n00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:53.620\neach of the layers here is fairly\nsomething that we have to understand.\n\n408\n00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.010\nIt depends on what\nthe function of a device is or\n\n409\n00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:00.220\nthe application that's running or\nwhat the protocol does.\n\n410\n00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.560\nSo, when we take a look at it\nfrom let's say the bottom,\n\n411\n00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.330\ncuz this is the easiest to understand.\n\n412\n00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:07.330\nThe physical layer is all\nabout the connectivity.\n\n413\n00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:10.750\nThe actual pathways in which\ndata will travel along network.\n\n414\n00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:15.250\nSo even that is defined in that sense,\nthat there has to be some physical path.\n\n415\n00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:17.870\nAnd this would be true even if\nwe were actually going wireless.\n\n416\n00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:21.750\nSo this is things like the actual\nphysical connectors that we put on wires.\n\n417\n00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:27.050\nIt's the wires themselves that we actually\nuse when we start taking a look at that.\n\n418\n00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:31.460\nIs the hubs that we use for\nbasic connectivity devices.\n\n419\n00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:35.970\nAnd hubs are just little special devices\nthat allow us to connect a single\n\n420\n00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:39.910\nconnection and then have it distributed\namong multiple connections as well.\n\n421\n00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:44.120\nWell all of these devices,\nthey do not make any decisions at all.\n\n422\n00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:47.280\nSo on these,\nthey are just transport devices.\n\n423\n00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.190\nThey are pathways for data to move across.\n\n424\n00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:53.380\nThey don't decide whether or\nnot data can on the device.\n\n425\n00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.300\nThey just say here's a pathway for\ndata to go.\n\n426\n00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.590\nAnd when you have that, well,\nthat's what a hub does.\n\n427\n00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:59.420\nCables just do that.\n\n428\n00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:02.700\nThey don't sit there and go all right,\nyou're not allowed to be on my cable or\n\n429\n00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:04.760\nyou are allowed to be on my cable.\n\n430\n00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.580\nThey can actually do that.\n\n431\n00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:08.810\nAnd then, of course, once you connect it,\nit actually provides that pathway.\n\n432\n00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:12.550\nAnd even lights, or indicator lights\nthat you might have on devices\n\n433\n00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:15.260\nlike the network adapter on\nthe back of your computer.\n\n434\n00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.810\nIf you plug the network cable in,\nyou probably saw that there was a light\n\n435\n00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:20.010\nthat stayed on and\nthen a light that was blinking.\n\n436\n00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:25.350\nWell, those are also indicators that this\nis the physical layer that is working.\n\n437\n00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:28.750\nAnd that is key for\nus when we start talking about\n\n438\n00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:31.490\nsome troubleshooting things that\nwe can do with this OSI Model.\n\n439\n00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:35.000\nOne thing that we have to make sure of\nright Daniel, is that in the very end\n\n440\n00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.510\nhere, if I need to troubleshoot one of the\nbest places I can start is verify what,\n\n441\n00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:43.480\nthat I have connectivity and when we start\ntalking about it's just making sure what,\n\n442\n00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.820\nthat I'm connected network, right.\n\n443\n00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:48.680\n>> Yeah, it can even be one of the easiest\nways to get into troubleshooting,\n\n444\n00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:52.160\njust because if it's just a cable,\nI don't want to start\n\n445\n00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:55.670\nlooking at layer three devices, oh let me\nlook at the configuration of my router.\n\n446\n00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:58.870\nThat switch might be off on a config and\nit's just a dead cable.\n\n447\n00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:00.040\nAnd I did all that work.\n\n448\n00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.788\nI should really start on the easier stuff.\n\n449\n00:23:01.788 --> 00:23:04.320\nLayer one technically\nis that stuff because\n\n450\n00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.500\nyou can actually put your hands on it.\n\n451\n00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.990\nIt's usually, if it's something\nyou can hold in your hands,\n\n452\n00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:11.280\nobviously you can hold a router,\nyou can hold a switch, but\n\n453\n00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.970\nit's designed to do something\ndifferent other then connectivity.\n\n454\n00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:15.930\nWell it is connectivity but\n\n455\n00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:20.080\nit's all kind of logically done\ninstead of physically done.\n\n456\n00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.420\nThat physical cable,\nI've got a cable in my hands.\n\n457\n00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:24.270\nThis connector, I can hold it in my hands.\n\n458\n00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:27.070\nIt actually does something and\nthat's its job.\n\n459\n00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:29.760\nWell, that's typically when you\nthink of layer one devices.\n\n460\n00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:30.550\n>> Right.\n\n461\n00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:33.989\nThen, when we move up to layer two here,\nor the data link layer,\n\n462\n00:23:33.989 --> 00:23:36.678\nthis is where we start making decisions,\nright?\n\n463\n00:23:36.678 --> 00:23:41.696\nSo there's a functionality here which\nlooks at a little bit of the information\n\n464\n00:23:41.696 --> 00:23:46.712\nthat we have in the data that's being\nsent and switches and network adapters,\n\n465\n00:23:46.712 --> 00:23:51.367\nthey do that when data goes into a PC,\nright, that little port in the PC.\n\n466\n00:23:51.367 --> 00:23:56.290\nWell, it has to inspect it to see\nwhether or not that data is destined for\n\n467\n00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:58.110\nthat device at layer two.\n\n468\n00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:00.910\nSo there's what we also call the MAC,\nwhich is a media access control message.\n\n469\n00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:07.530\nMedia access control says whether or\nnot it actually can go out onto the media.\n\n470\n00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:11.140\nAnd one of those protocols, right there at\nlayer two, says if you're gonna put data\n\n471\n00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:15.300\nout onto the wire, if you're gonna take\nit in, every single piece of data that's\n\n472\n00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:19.760\nactually done that way should have\na source and destination address.\n\n473\n00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.780\nAnd at this layer it looks at something\nthat we call that MAC address or\n\n474\n00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:25.050\nphysical address of that device.\n\n475\n00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:27.190\nSo it can actually inspect and go on it.\n\n476\n00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:33.220\nYes, this is the destination according to\nwhat I see in that packet or that frame.\n\n477\n00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:33.880\nAnd if it is,\n\n478\n00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:38.150\nit can then take it in and process\nthat if it's not it will reject it.\n\n479\n00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:41.530\nIt drops the packet right, or\ndrops the frame right there, and\n\n480\n00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:43.500\nswitches will do the same thing.\n\n481\n00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.970\nSwitches will take a look at that\ninformation of the source and destination.\n\n482\n00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:50.940\nAnd make his decision based on whether or\nnot it's actually going to another port or\n\n483\n00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:53.520\nnot, based on that MAC address.\n\n484\n00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:57.470\nSo this is where that data link\nlayer comes in to help as out.\n\n485\n00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:01.310\nBecause this is how data moves,\nit moves from one device to the next.\n\n486\n00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:05.140\nThe reason why that's important is that\nthere is another address also working\n\n487\n00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:08.330\nat the network layer,\nby far the most important protocol.\n\n488\n00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:12.820\nIn what we're gonna talk about is one\nthat we call IP, the internet protocol.\n\n489\n00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:16.010\nIt is the protocol used for addressing.\n\n490\n00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:19.630\nNow this is different whereas the data\nlink layer really helps us to make sure\n\n491\n00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:23.860\nthat we can transmit our data from\none device to the very next device,\n\n492\n00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:27.150\nit is the network address or\nthe IP address.\n\n493\n00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:32.860\nThat tells us whether data has\narrived at its ultimate destination.\n\n494\n00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:36.220\nSo it's right here in that\naddressing layer that we see that.\n\n495\n00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:39.090\nRouters allow us to be able to do that.\n\n496\n00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:42.400\nRouters don't look at just\nthe layer two address.\n\n497\n00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.070\nWhat it also does is that when it\nlooks it actually says all right,\n\n498\n00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:47.420\nis this where this data is\nultimately supposed to go?\n\n499\n00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:50.860\nAnd when it says, nope,\nit's actually supposed to go further on,\n\n500\n00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:55.060\nit knows that because it looks at\nthat layer three address as well.\n\n501\n00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:59.110\nNow there's a few other protocols that\nare actually designed to work between them\n\n502\n00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:01.830\nsuch as one we call\nAddress Resolution Protocol.\n\n503\n00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:05.070\nThat says look,\nif I give you an IP address,\n\n504\n00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:08.470\nI can determine what the next device\nthat's gonna get me there is, too.\n\n505\n00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:12.760\nAnd then there's other messaging protocols\nthat are in here, but by far the most\n\n506\n00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:17.261\nimportant one is that addressing protocol\nthat we have at layer three, which is IP.\n\n507\n00:26:17.261 --> 00:26:22.340\nThe transport layer right here,\nit doesn't depend on the device anymore.\n\n508\n00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:26.130\nNow at this layer, what you have is you\nhave to make a decision of whether or\n\n509\n00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:30.200\nnot that data is set that is actually\ngoing to be transmitted where\n\n510\n00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.660\nthe other device has to answer me first.\n\n511\n00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:34.430\nAnd I will have to synchronize that first.\n\n512\n00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:35.880\nOr can I just send it?\n\n513\n00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.840\nAnd the session layer, it establishes,\nmaintains, breaks down sessions.\n\n514\n00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:43.210\nAnd that means what we can do, of course,\nis make sure that once it gets started to\n\n515\n00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:47.010\nto the other side, it's saying yes,\nI want you to be open for business.\n\n516\n00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:48.700\nAnd I got this many packets to send.\n\n517\n00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:49.680\nAnd in the end,\n\n518\n00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:53.990\nit reads that last little bit that says\nyep we're finished closing the data down.\n\n519\n00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.800\nIt knows how to do that.\n\n520\n00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.330\nAnd then we also have formatting and\n\n521\n00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:00.910\nencryption at the presentation\nlayer which has to be processed.\n\n522\n00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:02.850\nAnd then of course I have\nthe application layer.\n\n523\n00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:06.150\nThese are not applications like\nmy word processing program.\n\n524\n00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:09.490\nBut they are actually the applications\nthat those programs use.\n\n525\n00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:12.220\nIf I am sending something\nbecause of email,\n\n526\n00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:15.760\nI might choose something like smtp, so\nthis application says yep, I'm gonna be\n\n527\n00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:19.580\nsending this I need to make sure it's\npackaged up the way smtp would package it.\n\n528\n00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:22.840\nIf I'm gonna make a connection, or\ndo name resolution, you name it,\n\n529\n00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.800\nthere's a bunch of these protocols.\n\n530\n00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:28.110\nAnd yes, this is something that\nwe just have to know again.\n\n531\n00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:31.815\nI wish that there was a way around\nthis that it would be easy unknown,\n\n532\n00:27:31.815 --> 00:27:35.845\nbut I would make sure that I at least\nknow some of these devices over here and\n\n533\n00:27:35.845 --> 00:27:39.618\nsome of these protocols that are also\nat each of those layers as well.\n\n534\n00:27:39.618 --> 00:27:41.525\nAnd this is where it\nbecomes more practical,\n\n535\n00:27:41.525 --> 00:27:44.637\nbecause if you know what functions and\nwhere something stops happening,\n\n536\n00:27:44.637 --> 00:27:47.990\nwell then you can actually go and\ntroubleshoot the right device.\n\n537\n00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:51.620\nOr you can actually go, oh, what,\nthat didn't stop at a device.\n\n538\n00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:55.550\nThe program is telling me\nthat I'm not getting this.\n\n539\n00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:58.830\nAnd then you know that it actually\nis up here at the application layer.\n\n540\n00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:01.440\nSo there's a lot of different\nways that this model itself and\n\n541\n00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:05.440\nunderstand what function at each layer\ncan really assist us in troubleshooting.\n\n542\n00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:09.680\n>> Yeah, the good news is for this exam,\nyou don't have to be a networking master.\n\n543\n00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:10.890\nRight?\nYou don't have to be like\n\n544\n00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:15.010\noh I know all the IEEE specifications for\nall these different things and\n\n545\n00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:16.680\nI know RFCs and [LAUGH] that.\n\n546\n00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:19.240\nIt's very technical stuff you\ndon't have to be that level.\n\n547\n00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:22.610\nThis is all about you learning\nhow networks work and\n\n548\n00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:24.740\njust having a good basic foundation.\n\n549\n00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:28.410\nSo all you really need to do is say okay,\nI see DNS over there.\n\n550\n00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:29.020\nRight?\n\n551\n00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:30.260\nIt's an application.\n\n552\n00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:33.460\nIt's a network application for\nme and kind of know what it does.\n\n553\n00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:35.230\nYou don't have to be a master at it,\n\n554\n00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:38.610\nyou're just gonna have to understand\nwhat works at each level.\n\n555\n00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:42.140\nGet a few examples under your belt so\nthat you have a good reference for\n\n556\n00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.460\nyourself to get into networking.\n\n557\n00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:48.640\nAnd when someone starts talking about\nit you have a conversation with Ronnie.\n\n558\n00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:52.590\nHe's like yeah, you know, my network\ncard is giving me real problems.\n\n559\n00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:55.710\nI'm seeing double MAC\naddresses on my network,\n\n560\n00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:56.870\nI don't know why that's happening.\n\n561\n00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:58.180\nYou kind of understand\nwhat's going on there.\n\n562\n00:28:58.180 --> 00:28:59.910\nOkay, well we're at layer two,\n\n563\n00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:04.020\nso obviously there's a physical\naddress issue on his network.\n\n564\n00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:06.140\nI wonder why that's happening,\nvery strange?\n\n565\n00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:07.760\nYou've got an idea of what's happening.\n\n566\n00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.000\nIt is not just hey, oh!\n\n567\n00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.815\nThat's nice, Ronnie.\n\n568\n00:29:11.815 --> 00:29:13.060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's where you wanna get,\n\n569\n00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:16.480\nthat's all you need to do, and Ronnie,\nthis is really good stuff, right?\n\n570\n00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.080\n>> It really is.\n\n571\n00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:20.045\nIt's something that is\nincredibly important.\n\n572\n00:29:20.045 --> 00:29:23.480\nAnd it doesn't seem that important at\nthe beginning of your networking career,\n\n573\n00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.611\nbecause it just seems like it's a lot\nof stuff that you just have to know and\n\n574\n00:29:26.611 --> 00:29:27.610\nmemorize.\n\n575\n00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:29.030\nBut the more that you get into networking,\n\n576\n00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:34.030\nthe more that you start thinking this way,\nwhen things do not go right in networking.\n\n577\n00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:36.700\nAnd if you do at least know that model and\ngo all right,\n\n578\n00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:40.980\nI stopped at layer three, you know, then I\nknow I need to troubleshoot at the router\n\n579\n00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:45.020\nat least look at the packets at the router\nand figure out what's going on there.\n\n580\n00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:51.044\nSo, this OSI model, the TCP/IP model, and\neven the basic protocols and devices and\n\n581\n00:29:51.044 --> 00:29:56.834\napplications that work on these layers,\nare really important foundationally.\n\n582\n00:29:56.834 --> 00:29:59.776\nAnd even if you don't understand\neverything like Daniel said,\n\n583\n00:29:59.776 --> 00:30:03.481\nit really does help at least to know that\nwhen somebody says switches that you know\n\n584\n00:30:03.481 --> 00:30:04.830\nthat's layer two.\n\n585\n00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:08.580\nOr when somebody says layer three you know\nit's routers, or layer one it's hubs and\n\n586\n00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:10.090\ncables or connectors.\n\n587\n00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:13.150\nThose are really gonna be foundational\nto help you out with the exam,\n\n588\n00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:14.890\nto the nth degree is\nwhat they're gonna do.\n\n589\n00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:15.780\n>> That's right.\n\n590\n00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:16.440\nWell guess what?\n\n591\n00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.810\nIt's not the end of networking.\n\n592\n00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:22.230\nThere's plenty, plenty more for\nus to discuss, but our time is elapsed,\n\n593\n00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:26.620\nRonnie, great demonstrations, thanks for\nthe great diagrams you also have.\n\n594\n00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:27.820\nAll the good explanations as well.\n\n595\n00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:31.260\nHopefully you guys are following along and\ngetting that understanding.\n\n596\n00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:33.660\nIf you're not, you know what,\njust watch the episode over and\n\n597\n00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:37.850\nover again until it starts beating itself\nin your head and you got it under control.\n\n598\n00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:40.040\nBut Ronnie, we're gonna have to\nmake a part two to this guy,\n\n599\n00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.410\nhopefully we'll see you guys there.\n\n600\n00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:43.220\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n601\n00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.080\nI've been your host

to\nanother exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.720\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n5\n00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.880\nHere with me in the studio yet\n\n6\n00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.710\nagain today is the networking\nguru himself, Ronald Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:22.720\nHow's it going today Ronnie?\n\n8\n00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.250\n>> I am doing well today.\n\n9\n00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.100\nI don't know where I was going,\nbut I am doing well today.\n\n10\n00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.420\nWe are taking a look at\nthe MTAV Microsoft Technology Associate,\n\n11\n00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.650\nthe 98366 exam about\nnetworking fundamentals.\n\n12\n00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.160\nOnce again, Daniel and I are here\nto put fun back into networking.\n\n13\n00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.140\nDaniels looking at me like,\nno way is that actually happening.\n\n14\n00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.690\nBut no, we're having a little bit of fun,\n\n15\n00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.870\nbecause we've been talking a little\nbit About the OSI model and\n\n16\n00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.830\nwe still have to continue on with that and\nactually see where that takes us as well.\n\n17\n00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.290\nAnd so there's a lot more for\nus to take a look at.\n\n18\n00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.220\nUnderstanding just the basics\nis what we're really after.\n\n19\n00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.000\nMaking sure we have those foundational\nideas and concepts down is only going to\n\n20\n00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.290\nhelp you out in networking in the future\nand as things get more complicated, right?\n\n21\n00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.540\n>> Yeah and even though this is a server\nexam, and you're thinking, wow,\n\n22\n00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.190\nwhy are we learning networking\nstuff if it's all about servers?\n\n23\n00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.470\nWell, there are services\nnormally that you're\n\n24\n00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.900\ngoing to be doing as\na server administrator.\n\n25\n00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.580\nBut in this day and age, you just can't\nget away with not knowing networking.\n\n26\n00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.440\nYou have to know how these things connect,\nyou have to know how they talk, how\n\n27\n00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.070\nthey're supposed to react, how they send\nmessages to each other back and forth.\n\n28\n00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.540\nSo having a good fundamental understanding\nof networking, very, very important.\n\n29\n00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.200\nNow Ronnie, we're going to continue\nmoving along this little train\n\n30\n00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.470\nwith my favorite topic when\nit comes to networking.\n\n31\n00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.360\nTCP versus UDP, the bash of protocols.\n\n32\n00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.160\n>> You better believe it.\n\n33\n00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.930\nSo let's take a look at what we had\njust discussed in a previous episode,\n\n34\n00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.980\njust briefly, about the communication\nprocess, and then we'll see\n\n35\n00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.750\nwhere this bash of protocols that\nDaniel's talking about fits in for us.\n\n36\n00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.120\nSo on my screen I went ahead and created\nthis diagram to help us to understand\n\n37\n00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.260\nthe overall communication process\nwhen you start seeing this.\n\n38\n00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.740\nIf the left-hand side\nrepresents a sending computer,\n\n39\n00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.320\nthe right-hand side represents\nthe destination computer, remember that\n\n40\n00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.640\nthis is how the OSI model really does\nhelp us to establish this communication.\n\n41\n00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.390\nAs we're sending data outbound,\nit's going to continue to add more and\n\n42\n00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.410\nmore information to all\nof the data that we have\n\n43\n00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.720\nuntil it's ready to be send across a wire.\n\n44\n00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.300\nSo this is the part that\nwe call encapsulation,\n\n45\n00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.030\nis what we are taking a look at here.\n\n46\n00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.810\nIt gets put out on the wire and\nthen on the other side of that wire\n\n47\n00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.810\nsome device is going to say, hey that\npiece of data belongs to me, and that's\n\n48\n00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.630\nwhere it gets processed at the data link\nlayer and moves up to the network layer,\n\n49\n00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.880\nthen takes a look source and destination,\nor the proper destination IP address.\n\n50\n00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.540\nAnd then the transport layer are all\nthe pieces there that I need?\n\n51\n00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.410\nOr do I need some more information,\nand then the session try and\n\n52\n00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.660\nmake sure it came from\nwho it said it came from.\n\n53\n00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.000\nSee if there is any more data\nthat actually needs to come in.\n\n54\n00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.490\nAnd then the presentation beginning\nlook at formatting, and then of course\n\n55\n00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.020\nthe application that's ultimately going\nto end up opening that piece of data.\n\n56\n00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.560\nNow the reason why this is important and\n\n57\n00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.060\nfundamental to what Daniel talked about\nin TCP/IP is because we do have a couple\n\n58\n00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.150\nof different types of communication\nprocesses that we have to understand.\n\n59\n00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.670\nSome data is perfectly fine\njust sending it out and\n\n60\n00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.330\nputting it out onto the network and\nit doesn't matter who gets the data.\n\n61\n00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.487\nAnd the very end as long as the data\nthat actually gets out there,\n\n62\n00:03:24.487 --> 00:03:28.055\nthe destination says yep, just keep\nsending data and I'll take it, and\n\n63\n00:03:28.055 --> 00:03:29.710\nit doesn't have to do anything.\n\n64\n00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.961\nBut some data wants to ensure that all\nof the data is going to get there, so\n\n65\n00:03:33.961 --> 00:03:38.841\nbefore any data is actually transmitted\nbetween these two, what ends up happening\n\n66\n00:03:38.841 --> 00:03:43.232\nis that they go ahead and they do\na little bit of communication beforehand,\n\n67\n00:03:43.232 --> 00:03:47.730\nwhich they talk and they agree and\nthey synchronize before any data is sent.\n\n68\n00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.360\nAnd this is where we are talking\nabout what Dan was mentioning here,\n\n69\n00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.330\nwhich is the difference between TCP,\ntransmission control protocol,\n\n70\n00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.930\nand UDP, which is user datagram protocol.\n\n71\n00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.640\nSo all the data that you and I put out on\nthe network is going to be one of these\n\n72\n00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.570\ntwo, well different types of data is\nwhat's going to end up happening.\n\n73\n00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.390\nIt's either going to be based on TCP or\non UDP.\n\n74\n00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.530\nTCP is by far about 80,\n\n75\n00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.350\nI would say maybe even higher, than 80%\nof all of the traffic that we send.\n\n76\n00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.630\nNow when we start talking about that,\nwhat does that actually mean?\n\n77\n00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.210\nIt means that if this is going to be\na TCP type of connection that we need\n\n78\n00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.020\nIt means that the sending machine\nover here on the left-hand side and\n\n79\n00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.650\nthe destination machine\nthey must synchronize.\n\n80\n00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.580\nIn other words make sure that\nthey're ready for the data.\n\n81\n00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.570\nSo what happens in between here is\nwhat we call a three-way handshake.\n\n82\n00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.570\nIn TCP communication, the first machine,\n\n83\n00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.530\nthe sending machine sends a sig message or\nit's normally abbreviated as a send.\n\n84\n00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.350\nSo they send that telling the other\ndevice that I am ready to synchronize\n\n85\n00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.960\nwith you because there's data\nthat needs to be transmitted.\n\n86\n00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.400\nWell the receiving machine at that\npoint then acknowledges that hey,\n\n87\n00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.910\nI got your synchronization message, but\n\n88\n00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.760\nif we're going to synchronize,\nI also need to synchronize with you, so\n\n89\n00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.760\nit sends it's same message back\nto that original sending machine.\n\n90\n00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.790\nAnd then the last time here,\non that three way handshake as\n\n91\n00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:23.370\nthe original sending machine acknowledges\nthat it received the same message.\n\n92\n00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.156\nAnd once that's done and\nboth sides are now synched up,\n\n93\n00:05:26.156 --> 00:05:31.350\nwhat is going to happen is now data\ncan be transmitted between them.\n\n94\n00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.770\nSo it's not going to put any data out onto\nthat network to send to some destination\n\n95\n00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.960\nmachine if it can't guarantee that\nthe data is going to be received.\n\n96\n00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.900\nSo that's where you do end up getting\na lot of times what they call\n\n97\n00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.740\nguaranteed delivery.\n\n98\n00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:46.760\nNow, when you start talking about it,\n\n99\n00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.150\nyou might be wondering like how\nin the world does that relate?\n\n100\n00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.170\nHow do I associate that\nwith something that I know?\n\n101\n00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:53.210\nWell, let's take, for\nan example, a telephone call.\n\n102\n00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.890\nThat's probably the easiest way that you\nand I can actually describe TCP, right?\n\n103\n00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.160\nSo at the very beginning,\nI dial your phone number.\n\n104\n00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.160\nWell, what is happening?\n\n105\n00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.130\nWell we are beginning the process\nof synchronization at the very\n\n106\n00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.310\nbeginning, right?\n\n107\n00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.170\nSo when I call and you pick it up, and you\nsay hello, this is, whoever it might be.\n\n108\n00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:13.150\nLet's say it's Daniel.\n\n109\n00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.510\nAnd Daniel says hello, this is Daniel.\n\n110\n00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.230\nAt that point, we are now starting.\n\n111\n00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.400\nSo my initial telephone call is\nnow sending that same message,\n\n112\n00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.120\nDaniel is now acknowledging\nwhen he picks up and\n\n113\n00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.040\nsays hello, he is acknowledging the very\nfact that he received my synchronization.\n\n114\n00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.970\nAnd if Daniel were to saying\nsomething like hello,\n\n115\n00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.030\nthis is Daniel, how may I help you, he's\nessentially saying, well let's sync up and\n\n116\n00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.340\nunderstand that we're on the same\npage in this communication.\n\n117\n00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:41.750\nAnd that process, that's when I can say,\nhey thanks for answering Daniel.\n\n118\n00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:42.890\nHere's is what I need.\n\n119\n00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.500\nWell, it's actually that thank you for\n\n120\n00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.740\nanswering that I'm doing\nin the acknowledgment.\n\n121\n00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.690\nSo, at that point in that telephone\ncall we are now synchronized.\n\n122\n00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:51.830\nWe're on the same page.\n\n123\n00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.160\nAnd hopefully that means Daniel and I are\nactually having the same conversation, and\n\n124\n00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.040\nhe's not there distracted by\nsomebody else in the room, but we're\n\n125\n00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.790\nactually communicating because what I have\nnow is hopefully Daniel's full attention,\n\n126\n00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.050\nis what I'm trying to get.\n\n127\n00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.550\n>> Yeah, the telephone conversation is\nactually a really good illustration\n\n128\n00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.260\nof the TCP protocol itself, or\n\n129\n00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.240\nthe TCP protocol--\n>> Yep.\n\n130\n00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.420\n>> the Transmission Control Protocol\nprotocol\n\n131\n00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.880\n>> I always enjoy those kind of\n\n132\n00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.790\nweird idioms of the English language,\nbut that's exactly what happens, right?\n\n133\n00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.540\nHe dials the phone,\nI pick it up, what do I say?\n\n134\n00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.510\nI say hello, right?\n\n135\n00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:22.110\nWhat does Ronnie do?\n\n136\n00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.490\nDoes he just start going, on the 5th\nof November you're going to start, no,\n\n137\n00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.700\nhe doesn't start hitting\nme with information.\n\n138\n00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.620\nHe replies right back.\n\n139\n00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:29.320\n\"Hey!\n\n140\n00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.020\nHow's it going?\" That lets me know who\nit is on the other end of the line.\n\n141\n00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.020\nI recognize Ronnie's voice.\n\n142\n00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.490\nHe knows that I've picked up.\n\n143\n00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:40.580\nAnd now that we've established the fact\nthat a connection has been made,\n\n144\n00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:41.700\nwe can start to talk.\n\n145\n00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:45.953\nAnd, until that happens, well, he's not\njust going to pick up the phone and\n\n146\n00:07:45.953 --> 00:07:49.960\nblindly start hammering away with\ninformation that he wants to tell me.\n\n147\n00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.966\nA, if I haven't picked up the phone,\n\n148\n00:07:51.966 --> 00:07:54.809\nit makes no sense sending\nit out into nowheresville.\n\n149\n00:07:54.809 --> 00:07:56.563\nAnd that doesn't help him out.\n\n150\n00:07:56.563 --> 00:07:59.988\nBut, if he hears my voice and then he\nstarts sending I might not be prepared.\n\n151\n00:07:59.988 --> 00:08:01.568\nI might not understand that it's him.\n\n152\n00:08:01.568 --> 00:08:04.232\nI might need for\nhim to hold on a second while I get ready,\n\n153\n00:08:04.232 --> 00:08:06.360\neven though I've answered the phone.\n\n154\n00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.810\nMaybe I've got something distracting me,\nthis is a really good illustration of why\n\n155\n00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:15.010\nthe TCP protocol uses this\nacknowledgement, this handshake\n\n156\n00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:20.240\nfeature to make sure that transmission of\ndata is reliable and connection oriented.\n\n157\n00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.190\n>> There's no doubt that\nwe'll see this more often,\n\n158\n00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:27.000\nso just about anytime you go and\nconnect to a website just like ITProTV,\n\n159\n00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.360\nyou're really establishing\nthat TCP connection.\n\n160\n00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.230\nThat's what you're doing.\n\n161\n00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.800\nAnd so you might also hear\nthe term connection oriented, and\n\n162\n00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.600\nthat's because a connection is\nestablished at the beginning,\n\n163\n00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.780\nbefore any datas actually going\nto be transmitted between us.\n\n164\n00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.990\nThe same thing would be true\nwith things like email, but\n\n165\n00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:47.290\nwebpages are essentially those types of\nexamples for us for TCP a lot of times.\n\n166\n00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.340\nAnd remember that a lot of our\ncommunication happens to be TCP\n\n167\n00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.680\noriented too.\n\n168\n00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.840\nNow some older terms that\nyou may also hear, and\n\n169\n00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.110\nI don't know if you'll encounter this\non the exam or not, but a lot of us,\n\n170\n00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:01.530\nas older people, also say reliable,\nthat's what I was trying to get to.\n\n171\n00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:06.540\nSo you hear the term guaranteed delivery,\nyou hear the term reliable traffic.\n\n172\n00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.580\nAnd when you hear stuff like that,\nthat's what they're normally referring to.\n\n173\n00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.540\nThe reason why it's reliable is because I\ndo have your full attention at that point.\n\n174\n00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.590\nAnd that means,\nwhen I say I'm going to send,\n\n175\n00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:18.050\nyou've already acknowledged that\nyou are going to receive that, and\n\n176\n00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:20.830\nyou're going to be ready for\nthat communication process to happen.\n\n177\n00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.090\nBut not all data is sent that way.\n\n178\n00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:26.960\nSome data is actually sent using\nwhat we call the udp instead,\n\n179\n00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.350\nthe user datagram protocol.\n\n180\n00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:34.480\nAnd so instead of connection oriented,\nwe talk about being connection-less and\n\n181\n00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.710\nbeing best effort at that point.\n\n182\n00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:39.160\nSo, what does that really mean?\n\n183\n00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.485\nThat means that I try my best to just\nmake sure that the data is out there and\n\n184\n00:09:43.485 --> 00:09:46.315\navailable for\nwhatever receiver is actually out there.\n\n185\n00:09:46.315 --> 00:09:50.585\nSo in this sense, if you think\nabout the use of a walkie talkie.\n\n186\n00:09:50.585 --> 00:09:54.835\nWell, remember that what happens here is\nthat if I turn on to whatever that channel\n\n187\n00:09:54.835 --> 00:09:58.520\nis, there is no guarantee that there's\nonly one other person listening.\n\n188\n00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.850\nThere's only a guarantee that I'm\ngoing to be using that channel and\n\n189\n00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.240\nhopefully the receiver, is also\ngoing to be using that channel, and\n\n190\n00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.010\nI just begin my communication process.\n\n191\n00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:09.010\nAnd if Daniel's at there\non the other hand?\n\n192\n00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:10.330\nHe may respond, but\n\n193\n00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:13.260\nit could be someone else just goes,\nhey, Daniel's, there's no Dan.\n\n194\n00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.550\nI hear by actually referring to Daniel.\n\n195\n00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:17.600\nSo nobody actually replies back, well,\n\n196\n00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.660\nI just keep going Daniel,\nDaniel are you there?\n\n197\n00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.280\nDaniel, Daniel and\nhopefully he answers and\n\n198\n00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.080\nif he does, I just start sending the data.\n\n199\n00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.430\nSo I know where that data is\nactually going and what it can do.\n\n200\n00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:30.880\nNow you might think like\na lot of times on this thing,\n\n201\n00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.750\nlike well, unlike the telephone\ncall where I have now actually\n\n202\n00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:38.620\nestablished that communication first,\nthis is just me sending data outbound.\n\n203\n00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:42.030\nAnd this is really useful in\ntoday's network for things like,\n\n204\n00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:43.340\nwell, what we're doing right now.\n\n205\n00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.590\nYou're actually looking\nat me on the screen.\n\n206\n00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:48.340\nWe are using UDP traffic, and\n\n207\n00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.790\nso this allows me to continue\nto stream data out to you.\n\n208\n00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:54.760\nVoice telephone calls that\nhappen over network connection,\n\n209\n00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.300\nlike what we're doing,\nthey're also UDP as well.\n\n210\n00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.360\nTCP, remember, has guaranteed delivery,\n\n211\n00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.960\nso every single bit that I send across the\nnetwork, you're guaranteed to get it, and\n\n212\n00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.220\nusually in the order that\nit actually comes in.\n\n213\n00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.060\nWith UDP though, it just sends the data.\n\n214\n00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.020\nIf you drop a few, it's no big deal.\n\n215\n00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.920\nIf you drop some, it's no big deal.\n\n216\n00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.830\nAs long as the entire message makes sense,\nit's perfectly fine.\n\n217\n00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:21.800\nBut if we had to do the TCP,\nwhen it says guaranteed delivery,\n\n218\n00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.110\nif it drops something,\nit will go, whoa, wait a minute.\n\n219\n00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.630\nI need you to resend that packet back.\n\n220\n00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.820\nAnd when something like that happens,\nit could send it back, but\n\n221\n00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.700\nit could send it back five minutes later,\nit could send it back 30 seconds later,\n\n222\n00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.010\nit could send it back\na tenth of a second later.\n\n223\n00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.110\nYou don't know when that\ndata is coming back in, and\n\n224\n00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:39.400\nthen now that's not going to make sense.\n\n225\n00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.710\nSo with the way that UDP works, where it\nsays look, and we're having this type of\n\n226\n00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:47.310\nconversation where it's really me talking\nand you're listening, the better thing is\n\n227\n00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:51.970\nallow some of those little packets we\ndropped off so that the continuity stays.\n\n228\n00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:54.430\nSo we can just continue\nto stream that data.\n\n229\n00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:57.930\nAnd that way even if you drop off\na couple of frames or so, it doesn't hurt\n\n230\n00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:02.970\nthe overall message in the communication\nof this type of connection that goes on.\n\n231\n00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:08.000\nSo UDP is still important in today's day,\nbecause of the communication process\n\n232\n00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.220\nlike VOIP telephones and even streaming\nlike what we're doing right here.\n\n233\n00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:16.350\n>> That's right, so we kind of made a joke\nabout the bash of the protocols here\n\n234\n00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:20.050\nwith the TCP being the big bruiser and\nUDP being the quick,\n\n235\n00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:23.600\nfast pugilist artist out there on there.\n\n236\n00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.690\nBut they both really have their\nstrengths and weaknesses.\n\n237\n00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:30.970\nYou might think, wow, TCP, I guarantee\nconnection there, that's awesome, but\n\n238\n00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:33.570\nwhat if you're streaming audio,\nwhat if you're streaming video.\n\n239\n00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:35.750\nI don't need to guarantee\nevery single packet,\n\n240\n00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:39.382\nI just need to make sure that enough of it\ngets there that the message makes sense.\n\n241\n00:12:39.382 --> 00:12:42.682\nNow, if it breaks down to where\nthe message isn't making sense,\n\n242\n00:12:42.682 --> 00:12:46.525\nyou'll probably stop and reestablish\nconnection on a better connection,\n\n243\n00:12:46.525 --> 00:12:48.578\ntherefore I can send at the speed I need.\n\n244\n00:12:48.578 --> 00:12:53.235\nWhere TCP, I got a file I've got to send\nit to Ronnie, it's mission critical,\n\n245\n00:12:53.235 --> 00:12:56.490\nthere can be no corruption\nto that data whatsoever.\n\n246\n00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:01.270\nIt's our super secret formula for barbecue\nsauce and our company relies on that.\n\n247\n00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:04.050\nI've got to make sure that that\ndata gets there without corruption.\n\n248\n00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.880\nTCP is going to be my go to guy.\n\n249\n00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.430\nSo it's really about trying to figure\nout what is the best protocol for\n\n250\n00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:11.680\nthe application that we're using and\n\n251\n00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.290\nnot necessarily not one versus\nthe other to be honest with you.\n\n252\n00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:14.950\n>> That's true.\n\n253\n00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:16.420\nThe good thing is for you and me,\n\n254\n00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.305\nwe don't have to decide this on\na packet by packet basis, right?\n\n255\n00:13:19.305 --> 00:13:20.540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I honestly go well,\n\n256\n00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:24.500\nam I going to send a UDP today,\nor I'm going to send a TCP today.\n\n257\n00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:27.280\nIt's actually decided for\nus in the protocol itself.\n\n258\n00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:31.610\nIn the how somebody says hey this\nneeds to be sent, it's the machine,\n\n259\n00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:32.510\nit's the application.\n\n260\n00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:35.970\nIt's the way that they've developed the\nnetworking that says whether it's going to\n\n261\n00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:41.270\nuse UDP or TCP, so if I had to decide,\nI don't know what I would end up doing.\n\n262\n00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:44.220\nI'd have to sit down and figure out,\nlike yeah, I better send UDP.\n\n263\n00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:47.860\nToday I just feel like TCP, I don't know.\n\n264\n00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.020\nLet's just pick half of\nthem to do that way.\n\n265\n00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.910\nThat would take such a long time.\n\n266\n00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:54.970\nWell, that's why they go ahead,\nin networking, a lot of it's already\n\n267\n00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:59.660\npredefined for us, so that you and\nI don't have to make those considerations.\n\n268\n00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:04.660\nBut it does help when you are having to\ndeal again with troubleshooting here and\n\n269\n00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:05.610\nthe reason why.\n\n270\n00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:07.110\nDo you know why it failed?\n\n271\n00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:10.360\nWell if the three-way handshake\ndidn't occur then you know it failed.\n\n272\n00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.480\nAnd so you might go back and\nbe able to troubleshoot that.\n\n273\n00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:16.130\nWhy didn't it make the connection\nin the first place?\n\n274\n00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:19.850\nWith UDP, if the other side isn't\nanswering, well then you know,\n\n275\n00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:20.980\nthat is going to fail.\n\n276\n00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:24.440\nBecause the other side isn't even saying,\nyeah, I can receive that at all.\n\n277\n00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:28.575\nIt's just an okay, just keep sending,\ndid you get all of it?\n\n278\n00:14:28.575 --> 00:14:29.115\nI don't care.\n\n279\n00:14:29.115 --> 00:14:31.505\nJust keep sending it, and\nI'll get all of it eventually.\n\n280\n00:14:31.505 --> 00:14:33.755\nYou know, just keep sending.\n\n281\n00:14:33.755 --> 00:14:36.755\nSo there's a lot of information\nthat's out there on the network and\n\n282\n00:14:36.755 --> 00:14:38.105\nthat you don't have to worry about, but\n\n283\n00:14:38.105 --> 00:14:41.035\nyou do need to at least understand\nthe differences between them.\n\n284\n00:14:41.035 --> 00:14:46.355\nSo keep in mind that terminology that\nis associated with each of these.\n\n285\n00:14:46.355 --> 00:14:48.890\nRemember that with TCP,\nthree way handshake.\n\n286\n00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:53.090\nYou want to make sure that you understand\nthat the term guaranteed delivery is\n\n287\n00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:56.280\nalso a key for us as well.\n\n288\n00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.980\nIf you go to UDP,\nremember the term connection-less, and\n\n289\n00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:02.980\nwhereas and I've forgotten\nthe connection oriented on TCP.\n\n290\n00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:07.550\nSo connection-less on UDP vs\nconnection oriented in TCP.\n\n291\n00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:10.270\nAnd then the term, best effort in UDP.\n\n292\n00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:12.040\nBest effort means I tried my best,\n\n293\n00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.140\nexactly like it sounds but\nI can't tell you if the other guy sent it.\n\n294\n00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.970\nI did my best to make sure I put\nall the information out there.\n\n295\n00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:19.130\nAnd so, if they got it they got it.\n\n296\n00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:23.370\nIf they didn't, well, that's their fault\nfor not getting all the information.\n\n297\n00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:26.580\nSo, you will actually\nget stuff like this and\n\n298\n00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.730\nthis is part of understanding\nthat nature of networking.\n\n299\n00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:33.490\nAnd this goes all the way\nback to that OSI model.\n\n300\n00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.080\nLet me see if I can find the right one.\n\n301\n00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.430\nSo, remember that back in the OSI model,\n\n302\n00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:40.230\nwe talked about where this\nactually makes an impact.\n\n303\n00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:44.310\nThis is where we showed you TCP or\nUDP at this point.\n\n304\n00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:47.194\nSo, at the transport layer,\nthat's where it's decided.\n\n305\n00:15:47.194 --> 00:15:51.588\nAs data is now being sent out from one\nmachine going to the next machine,\n\n306\n00:15:51.588 --> 00:15:56.128\nthe transport layer is actually what says,\nall right, this is UDP data or\n\n307\n00:15:56.128 --> 00:16:00.766\nthis is going to be TCP data, and then\nat the other side when he receives it.\n\n308\n00:16:00.766 --> 00:16:02.411\nIt sees that flag.\n\n309\n00:16:02.411 --> 00:16:03.250\nIs it TCP?\n\n310\n00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:06.733\nIf it is that means we have to establish\nthat connection first before we will\n\n311\n00:16:06.733 --> 00:16:08.420\nreceive any of the data.\n\n312\n00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:12.240\nIf it's UDP it can say hey look, here's\nUDP data, it's just going to send it and\n\n313\n00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:16.640\nI should just be receiving everything\nthat's coming in on this UDP port\n\n314\n00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.160\nbecause it's designed\nto go that way as well.\n\n315\n00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.080\nSo there's a lot of stuff behind this.\n\n316\n00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.360\nAnd that's where you do see it.\n\n317\n00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.260\nLike we said make sure you understand.\n\n318\n00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.760\nLet me see if I can find that one again.\n\n319\n00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.450\nThat this happens at that transport layer.\n\n320\n00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:32.770\nSo even though it's called a transport\nlayer, remember it's a transmission\n\n321\n00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:38.650\nprotocol and user datagram protocol,\nall at this fourth layer of the OSI model.\n\n322\n00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:41.335\nSo it does all tie it back\nin to this OSI model.\n\n323\n00:16:41.335 --> 00:16:42.865\n>> [LAUGH] It usually does.\n\n324\n00:16:42.865 --> 00:16:43.650\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n325\n00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:47.165\n>> And that's a good reason for us to\nlearn it, get it squared away in our head\n\n326\n00:16:47.165 --> 00:16:50.170\nthat we make sure that when we're starting\nto talk about different concepts,\n\n327\n00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:54.120\ndifferent networking ideas, that you know\nexactly what we're talking about and\n\n328\n00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.590\nwhy we're talking about that.\n\n329\n00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:58.470\nThat's another good reason for\nthe OSI model to be around.\n\n330\n00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:02.790\nIt gives us that reference for\nus to all talk on the same level,\n\n331\n00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:05.880\nnot just in the computers, but\neven humanly among each other.\n\n332\n00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.170\nIt's very, very helpful.\n\n333\n00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:10.150\nNow, Ronnie, we also need to\ntalk about the idea of ports.\n\n334\n00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:11.820\nIf you've never heard of ports before,\nyes,\n\n335\n00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:14.490\nI'm not talking about\na place where ships go.\n\n336\n00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:16.760\nI'm not even talking about\nthe ports on the back of your PC.\n\n337\n00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.710\nThis is a special kind of port\nthat works in networking so\n\n338\n00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:22.580\nthat we can establish a connection.\n\n339\n00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:25.070\nIt's all about establishing\nconnections here in networking.\n\n340\n00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:28.420\nThat's kind of the definition of the term,\nnetworking.\n\n341\n00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.450\nBut it's all about that and\nfiguring it out.\n\n342\n00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:33.370\nAnd Ronnie, you're gonna help us kind\nof de-mystify this because there's\n\n343\n00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:33.960\na lot of ports, right?\n\n344\n00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.740\n>> Yes, there are a lot of ports, but\n\n345\n00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:39.110\nthe good thing is we really only need\nto know some of the most common ones.\n\n346\n00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:42.070\nBut let's try to make an understanding\nabout why we actually need to\n\n347\n00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:44.560\nunderstand this concept of ports as well.\n\n348\n00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.380\nWell if I connect to a machine,\n\n349\n00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:51.770\nit's not usually only using one\napplication at a single time, okay?\n\n350\n00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:54.850\nSo let me kind of give you an example\nof what I'm talking about, right?\n\n351\n00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:55.660\nSo let me see.\n\n352\n00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.820\nLet's go ahead and take a look at\nmy computer for just a moment and\n\n353\n00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:02.690\nlet me verify that I can actually get\nout to the internet, and I think I can.\n\n354\n00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:03.220\nSo here it is.\n\n355\n00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:07.160\nI am on the sir 2008 machine and\nthis may balk at me.\n\n356\n00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.340\nFor doing that.\nYep, now let me.\n\n357\n00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.250\n>> You know how servers are,\ngetting on the Internet.\n\n358\n00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:11.190\n>> I know, yeah, it tends to do that.\n\n359\n00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:12.755\n>> They don't like the Internet,\nthose servers.\n\n360\n00:18:12.755 --> 00:18:14.620\n[LAUGH]\n>> Let me do something else then.\n\n361\n00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:20.990\nLet me just use this client, cuz that\nsecurity control thing, it always gets me.\n\n362\n00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.650\nOh, no wonder.\n\n363\n00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:24.940\nCuz I'm not actually connected to the\nInternet, so that actually doesn't help.\n\n364\n00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.210\nLet me see here.\n\n365\n00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:29.830\nLet me put this back on the, well,\nI thought it was on the proper connection.\n\n366\n00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:32.480\nSo well, I'm lying to you then.\n\n367\n00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:36.570\nAll right, so\nthis one is not connected at all.\n\n368\n00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:38.940\nI was hoping that I could do it that way,\nbut let's see what it does.\n\n369\n00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.190\nLet me go back to this machine.\n\n370\n00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:44.180\nI was hoping that we could do\nthis without a lot of fuss.\n\n371\n00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.580\nTry to connect to ITProTV.\n\n372\n00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:49.800\nAnd I'm gonna add this into\nmy trusted sites here.\n\n373\n00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:50.930\nAnd hopefully that should do it.\n\n374\n00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:55.520\nWell, of course,\nit wants to add all this stuff.\n\n375\n00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.610\nIt's not going to like that.\n\n376\n00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:58.440\nLet's get to that point.\n\n377\n00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:02.410\nYeah, it doesn't like this browser\nbecause it's too old for our website.\n\n378\n00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:05.160\nBut, I wanted to get to this point here,\nbecause I wanted to show you something.\n\n379\n00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.440\nSo, even though it's actually\ncomplaining that my browser's too old.\n\n380\n00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:12.220\nI still did get to the website\nto a certain point here.\n\n381\n00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:16.160\nNow, when I did that, right,\nI'm using well, more than one protocol.\n\n382\n00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:16.850\nOkay?\n\n383\n00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:21.260\nThe one that I use to connect\nup here is one called, HTTP.\n\n384\n00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.030\nAnd then when I type in the name up here,\n\n385\n00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:27.230\nalso used a name resolution\nprotocol as well.\n\n386\n00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:30.380\nAnd then in the background of\nthat name resolution protocol\n\n387\n00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:33.790\nis taking that name and\nthen pointing it to an IP address,\n\n388\n00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:37.480\nwhich means I am also using\nIP to make a connection too.\n\n389\n00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.590\nNow when I take a look at all that, right.\n\n390\n00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:42.480\nSo there's at least three\nprotocols that are involved.\n\n391\n00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.830\nWell the problem that we\nhave is fairly simple.\n\n392\n00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:47.960\nIn that communication process as\nwe went farther on through and\n\n393\n00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.730\nI selected the browser\nto make the connection.\n\n394\n00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:54.860\nThe application said yes you're going to\nconnect to a web server somewhere, and\n\n395\n00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:58.070\nthat's actually going to\nbe that HTTP at the point.\n\n396\n00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.690\nBut then as we went on down\nthese presentation layers and\n\n397\n00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:04.230\nall that, It also added in\nthe protocols of IP addressing,\n\n398\n00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:08.050\nit also did DNS name resolution, which\nwas up here at the application layer.\n\n399\n00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:11.790\nIt did all that, and\nthen it goes across the wire.\n\n400\n00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:17.770\nWell how does that receiving machine\ndifferentiate between the name resolution,\n\n401\n00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:22.330\nbetween the HTTP that I was using,\nand the IP address and all that?\n\n402\n00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:25.260\nBecause when it goes across the wire,\nif you think about it, it's simple signal.\n\n403\n00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:25.890\nRight?\n\n404\n00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:30.000\nIt's just electricity at that point,\nand that receiving machine, that server\n\n405\n00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.320\nout there says, hey, there is electricity\nthat's coming across this wire.\n\n406\n00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.830\nBut it has to be differentiated.\n\n407\n00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:42.030\nPort numbers and ports are how we\ndifferentiate the different types of data\n\n408\n00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:43.970\ngoing across that wire.\n\n409\n00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:46.590\nIf I were to look at it even\nthrough an asciliscope, Daniel,\n\n410\n00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:49.790\nI couldn't take that asciliscope and\ngo oh look at that there's the dns signal.\n\n411\n00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:54.370\nOh look at that, there's the HTTP signal,\nI couldn't do that, but the machine can.\n\n412\n00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:57.230\nAnd the way that the machine can\ndo it is that they've also encoded\n\n413\n00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:00.370\nin certain numbers along with the traffic.\n\n414\n00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:04.390\nThat when is processed into that computer,\nit says, this is HTTP,\n\n415\n00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:09.190\nhere is the IP address,\nhere's the actual DNS\n\n416\n00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:12.380\nresolution that happens so\nthat we can actually get to this point.\n\n417\n00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.230\nIt knows how to differentiate that.\n\n418\n00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:15.750\nSo between these two computers,\n\n419\n00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:19.240\neven though it's only receiving\nsome type of electrical signal,\n\n420\n00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:24.080\nit knows how to do that, and that is\nbecause we are using what we call ports.\n\n421\n00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:27.620\nPorts are software and\npoint connections is what they are.\n\n422\n00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:31.620\nSo when your software needs to connect\nto another piece of software out there,\n\n423\n00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:35.375\nthat software needs to go, yeah, thatm\nthat belongs to me when it receives it.\n\n424\n00:21:35.375 --> 00:21:36.725\nSo that's going to my web server,\n\n425\n00:21:36.725 --> 00:21:40.365\nyeah it's supposed to connect here\non port 80 on this web server.\n\n426\n00:21:40.365 --> 00:21:43.185\nIf not, then it takes a look at DNS and\ngoes DNS, okay,\n\n427\n00:21:43.185 --> 00:21:46.385\nyeah connect to port 80 and\nthen the DNS signal fails.\n\n428\n00:21:46.385 --> 00:21:48.325\nSo that's what we use port numbers for,\nand\n\n429\n00:21:48.325 --> 00:21:51.335\nwe use ports is to help\nderfrinceate those signals\n\n430\n00:21:51.335 --> 00:21:55.900\nfrom the receiving from the sending all\nthe way through to the sending side.\n\n431\n00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.100\nAnd so when we start taking a look there,\n\n432\n00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:02.080\nI've got a couple of different ones\nthat we want to pay attention to.\n\n433\n00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.260\nLet me slide that back\ndown a little bit more.\n\n434\n00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.100\nSo these are by far some of\nthe most common port numbers and\n\n435\n00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:11.530\nprotocols that we've got to at\nleast be familiar with as well.\n\n436\n00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:15.010\nSo when it comes down to things like\nemail, there's really three of them.\n\n437\n00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:17.780\nRight, there's POP3 which stands for\npost office protocol.\n\n438\n00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:20.150\nAnd that happens on port 110.\n\n439\n00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:23.660\nAnd this is used for receiving email.\n\n440\n00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:25.920\nSo if you are getting email\nfrom an email server and\n\n441\n00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.660\nyou're downloading it your computer,\nyou're gonna use well port 110.\n\n442\n00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.680\nAnd once you download it,\n\n443\n00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.500\nthere's not gonna be a copy of your\nemail left up on a server somewhere.\n\n444\n00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:39.350\nWhen you are sending email outbound,\nfrom whatever client you're using,\n\n445\n00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:42.390\nwhatever software you're using on your\nmachine, and you're sending an outbound.\n\n446\n00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:46.440\nIt's gonna use SMTP,\nthe simple mail transfer protocol for\n\n447\n00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.700\nsending data outbound.\n\n448\n00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:54.020\nSo you will also do that, and then usually\ntoday you usually hear about IMAP,\n\n449\n00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:57.220\nthe internet messaging access protocol.\n\n450\n00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:02.090\nThis is on port 143 and\nyou're opening up a management\n\n451\n00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:05.540\nconsole to the email that's\nactually up there on the server.\n\n452\n00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:09.410\nAnd you're really only downloading copies\nof your email, but everything that you're\n\n453\n00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:13.020\ndoing is really actually sending the\ncommand to the server to handle as well.\n\n454\n00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:17.320\nSo these are by far some of the most\npopular email ports that you do see.\n\n455\n00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.890\nAnd of course,\nthe most popular ports that are out there\n\n456\n00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:22.990\nall have to do with accessing\nwebsites more than anything else.\n\n457\n00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:27.410\nSo on port 443 and port 80,\nthese are the ones that you also see.\n\n458\n00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:31.020\nThe key here for\nus is differentiating between them.\n\n459\n00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:34.820\nIf we only see HTTP up in our address bar,\nwe're using port 80.\n\n460\n00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:38.060\nWe see HTTPS in your address\nbar up on your browser,\n\n461\n00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:42.080\nyou are gonna be using HTTPS, and\nthe S stands for, well, security.\n\n462\n00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.360\nThat's what it stands for.\n\n463\n00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.270\nSo you're having to make\nthe security connection,\n\n464\n00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:48.690\nthat is what you're also gonna\nend up seeing up there too.\n\n465\n00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:51.414\nAnd then we also talk\nabout name resolution.\n\n466\n00:23:51.414 --> 00:23:55.702\nAnd we do have another little section that\nwe're gonna go much more in depth into\n\n467\n00:23:55.702 --> 00:23:56.728\nname resolution.\n\n468\n00:23:56.728 --> 00:24:00.448\nWe're not gonna give you the entire\nexhaustive compendium of what we know\n\n469\n00:24:00.448 --> 00:24:01.108\nabout DNS But\n\n470\n00:24:01.108 --> 00:24:05.319\nit is actually gonna be a little bit more\nexhaustive than just naming it right here.\n\n471\n00:24:05.319 --> 00:24:08.800\nName resolution allows me to\nbe able to network by name.\n\n472\n00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.140\nThat's pretty much what\nit allows us to do, but\n\n473\n00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:13.560\nthere's two protocols that help us out.\n\n474\n00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:17.860\nThe one that we use today by far and\nabove anything else,\n\n475\n00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:23.500\nis what we call DNS, domain name system,\nis the one that we also use here.\n\n476\n00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:27.540\nThere's an older one that Microsoft\ndid develop and come up with.\n\n477\n00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:29.930\nBut even now it's actually fading away.\n\n478\n00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:31.790\nIt's one we call NetBIOS.\n\n479\n00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:35.610\nAnd there's also 137\nusing that one as well.\n\n480\n00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:38.610\nSo you do need to know those\nname resolution protocols and\n\n481\n00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:39.660\nthose port numbers.\n\n482\n00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:41.810\nAnd then there's some\nmiscellaneous ones here.\n\n483\n00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:45.060\nAnd these are, like I said,\nthey're not in the most, you know,\n\n484\n00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.160\nthey're not used every day.\n\n485\n00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.540\nBut they are actually used out there and\n\n486\n00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:50.240\nthey're always mentioned in just\nabout every other place here.\n\n487\n00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:53.510\nMiscellaneous ones, when we talk\nabout connecting to another machine\n\n488\n00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:56.420\nusing some type of terminal connection,\nthis allows me to be\n\n489\n00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:59.500\nable to send commands to another machine\neven though I'm not sitting down at them.\n\n490\n00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.200\nWell things like Telnet\nallows me to do that, but\n\n491\n00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.260\nthis thing does it over plain text.\n\n492\n00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:08.620\nIf somebody can actually add something\nto their device in between my device and\n\n493\n00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:09.580\nwhere I'm trying to connect to,\n\n494\n00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:12.830\nand ber able to read the traffic\ndirectly off the wire.\n\n495\n00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:19.860\nWhere as using SSH secure shell,\nencrypts that type of traffic instead.\n\n496\n00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:24.370\nAnd then if I'm transferring files\nacross a network, I can use well FTP,\n\n497\n00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:25.950\nfile transfer protocol.\n\n498\n00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:29.260\nNotice that they didn't try to\ncome up with creative names like\n\n499\n00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:32.200\nmaster delivery protocol number four.\n\n500\n00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.670\nThey didn't try to do that.\n\n501\n00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:35.720\nFinal transport protocol\nmeans exactly that.\n\n502\n00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.390\nIf I need to transfer one file\nfrom here over to that one,\n\n503\n00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:40.390\nhere's a protocol to actually use.\n\n504\n00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:42.970\nAnd this one operates\non these two ports too.\n\n505\n00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:47.670\nNow this is one of the hard things about\nnetworking certifications and everything,\n\n506\n00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:52.000\nyou just gotta memorize these, and\nmemorization is a big part of what you do.\n\n507\n00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.020\nBut as you continue to work with them\nmore and more, it becomes second nature,\n\n508\n00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:56.630\nyou don't really have to worry about it.\n\n509\n00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:59.080\nBut at the beginning,\nmemorization is the key here.\n\n510\n00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.140\n>> Yeah don't be like me,\nwhere I was always like,\n\n511\n00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:04.520\noh why do we use port\n80 instead of port 82?\n\n512\n00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.640\nWhy not that one?\n\n513\n00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:09.280\nJust at this point in time, what you\ngotta do is just get these facts and\n\n514\n00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.590\nfigures buried in the brain.\n\n515\n00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:14.140\nAnd then as you know that,\nyou know those facts and\n\n516\n00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:16.530\nfigures, as you start\nworking in the field,\n\n517\n00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:20.400\nmaybe you do wanna get into networking\nmore than you do server administration.\n\n518\n00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.110\nThis stuff is gonna start\nmaking a lot more sense,\n\n519\n00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:23.620\ncuz you're gonna start working\nwith it more and more,\n\n520\n00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:28.620\nand as you do, you're gonna see,\noh, okay, well, DNS is port 53.\n\n521\n00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:30.140\nI can take a look at what DNS does.\n\n522\n00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:30.980\nI understand that.\n\n523\n00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:33.530\nI understand that if it\nworks on port 53 and\n\n524\n00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:36.170\nsomething's not going right,\nmaybe somebody has the wrong port.\n\n525\n00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:37.910\nMaybe something's blocking that port.\n\n526\n00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:39.200\nWho knows?\nCould be a variety of things.\n\n527\n00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:44.660\nBut I gotta know that DNS is on port 53\nif I'm gonna troubleshoot that problem.\n\n528\n00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:47.910\nSo just like Ronny said,\nrote memorization in here.\n\n529\n00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:48.840\nIt is a bear.\n\n530\n00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.050\nGet you some flashcards out.\n\n531\n00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:51.750\nIt's the best way to do this kinda stuff.\n\n532\n00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:53.450\nAnd just start memorizing ports.\n\n533\n00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:57.395\nNow you don't have to memorize them all,\nbecause there's 65,535 or something,\n\n534\n00:26:57.395 --> 00:26:59.060\n>> [LAUGH] There's a lot.\n\n535\n00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:00.920\n>> There's a ton.\n\n536\n00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:06.210\nBut well known ports, though, very,\nvery common for us to know a lot of those.\n\n537\n00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:06.910\n>> There really are,\n\n538\n00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:10.810\nand as you get more in your network\nrepair, this is just a small sampling.\n\n539\n00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:14.390\nNormally when you start moving up towards\nyour certification like network plus and\n\n540\n00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:18.090\neven higher, that's when you start\nmemorizing like 20 to 30 of these instead.\n\n541\n00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:20.710\nAnd then as you move further and\nyou start working with more,\n\n542\n00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:22.050\nyou actually see even a lot more,\n\n543\n00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:25.950\nbut at this point the handful that I\nshowed you is actually gonna be important.\n\n544\n00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:29.590\nAnd we do have one more topic that\nwe do need to at least discuss and\n\n545\n00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:31.520\nunderstand, because believe it or not,\n\n546\n00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:35.030\na packet is not always a packet is\na packet as a packet is described.\n\n547\n00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:36.400\nI know that, that sounds strange.\n\n548\n00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.730\nBut it's true, language and\nnetworking, it really is.\n\n549\n00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:41.520\nIt can be confusing.\n\n550\n00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.790\nSo we need to understand some of\nthe confusing terminologies here.\n\n551\n00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:46.660\nAnd that terminology that\nyou're always going to hear,\n\n552\n00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:49.650\ndepending on who describes it and I've\nbeen doing it during our show as well,\n\n553\n00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:53.500\nis the terms frames and\npackets and even other things.\n\n554\n00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.770\nSo let's go ahead and\nshow you what I'm talking about here.\n\n555\n00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:58.110\nSo if we take a look at the OSI model,\n\n556\n00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:02.200\nnow once again you see where it actually\nties all back in here to the OSI model.\n\n557\n00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:05.820\nWell the way that we describe\nthe data along the OSI model\n\n558\n00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:07.660\nnormally comes like this.\n\n559\n00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.760\nUp here in these upper three layers,\n\n560\n00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.880\neverything is really\nconsidered data at this point.\n\n561\n00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.590\nAnd the reason why it's considered\ndata at this point is that\n\n562\n00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:20.250\neven though these upper three layers help\nrepair that data to be put out in network,\n\n563\n00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:24.480\nit really has nothing to do with\nthe overall delivery of that data.\n\n564\n00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.130\nIn other words,\n\n565\n00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:29.420\nthere's none of this information that\nsays here's how the data can be moved.\n\n566\n00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:32.430\nHere's how the data breaks\nup into little pieces.\n\n567\n00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:36.610\nHere's the way that the data actually\nknows it's arrived at its destination.\n\n568\n00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:40.630\nSo, at that point then,\nwhat we have here is just regular data.\n\n569\n00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:45.960\nNow, along that right, as you start\nsending data outbound from your machine,\n\n570\n00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:49.910\nand I don't know why everything keeps\nkinda making me move up or down, but\n\n571\n00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:53.200\nit does,\nas you start sending data along that path.\n\n572\n00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.000\nRight?\n\n573\n00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.040\nWhen you start sending data out,\nI talked about the term encapsulation.\n\n574\n00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:01.940\nAnd that's because each layer adds\nin a little bit of information.\n\n575\n00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:06.820\nSo it keeps stacking it up around the\nactual data that existed on your computer.\n\n576\n00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:09.230\nSo what ends up happening at some point.\n\n577\n00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:11.670\nIf I can go back, oh there it goes.\n\n578\n00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:13.590\nWhere I can go back down here.\n\n579\n00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:16.680\nWhen it gets down to that point\nwhere now we are talking about\n\n580\n00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.470\nwhat is responsible for\ndelivering the data.\n\n581\n00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:21.160\nThis is where you start seeing it.\n\n582\n00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:24.490\nSo, inside of the data\nchunk you have here,\n\n583\n00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:27.050\nyou end up adding in\nwhat we call a header.\n\n584\n00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:30.150\nAnd that header here,\nyou see is called layer four.\n\n585\n00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:33.800\nAnd it's here that they\ncall it a segment of data.\n\n586\n00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:38.460\nAnd then, when it is ready to send out and\nhave addressing put on it, well then,\n\n587\n00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:42.310\nat layer three, notice they don't\nstrip away the layer four header.\n\n588\n00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:44.180\nThey add in more information.\n\n589\n00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:48.930\nAnd then at layer two, this is actually\nthe data that is put out onto the wire.\n\n590\n00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:53.290\nIt becomes signal, it becomes bits,\nones and zeroes, on the wire itself.\n\n591\n00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:56.830\nAnd you see where it also\nadded in a footer as well.\n\n592\n00:29:56.830 --> 00:30:00.640\nAnd notice the three different terms,\nand you do need to memorize this, right?\n\n593\n00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.550\nAt layer two, data is called a frame.\n\n594\n00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:08.010\nAt the layer three, data is called packets\nat that point or the chunk that we\n\n595\n00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:12.580\nsend out, and then at the transport layer\nit's just called a segment of data.\n\n596\n00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:17.790\nSo when we start delivering data from one\ndevice to another, we're sending frames.\n\n597\n00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:21.350\nWhen I need to find out did data\nactually arrive at it's destination,\n\n598\n00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:24.010\nI'm talking about a packet of information.\n\n599\n00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:27.260\nAnd then if I'm talking about\nbreaking the data up to be sent, and\n\n600\n00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:30.320\nwhether or not I received all of\nthe data on the receiving machine.\n\n601\n00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:34.200\nI'm talking about the segments of\ndata that I'm actually receiving.\n\n602\n00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.570\nSo those are technical terms, and\n\n603\n00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:40.210\neven though we tend to use packet\nin everything that we describe,\n\n604\n00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:44.840\nthis is the technicality that you will\nactually face at some point in time.\n\n605\n00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:49.530\nSo when you receive that data, think about\nwhat also happens at the receiving end.\n\n606\n00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:51.960\nIt first takes a look at this frame, and\n\n607\n00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:56.180\nif that destination mac address says,\nhey, that's mine.\n\n608\n00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:57.450\nIt processes to Layer 2,\n\n609\n00:30:57.450 --> 00:31:01.190\nand then it hands it up to Layer\n3 on that receiving machine.\n\n610\n00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:04.360\nAnd the receiving machine says,\nhey, that's my IP address.\n\n611\n00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:05.810\nIt processes that.\n\n612\n00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:09.000\nAnd now the data's not going to\nactually go anywhere else because\n\n613\n00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.110\nthe addressing has now been taken off and\nthen it can process whether or\n\n614\n00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:14.280\nnot we actually have\nall the pieces of data.\n\n615\n00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:16.310\nOr do I need to request data to be resent?\n\n616\n00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:19.000\nOr do I need to request\nthe next bit to be resent?\n\n617\n00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.830\nAnd it actually continues\nto process all the way up,\n\n618\n00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:23.690\nuntil the point where it\nhits the application.\n\n619\n00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:27.520\nAnd then, I'm on that computer\nreceiving it and reading it.\n\n620\n00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:29.600\nBut, yeah,\nyou do have to know those terms.\n\n621\n00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:34.130\nFrames, packets, and\nsegments in the end for the terminology.\n\n622\n00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:38.680\nAnd that's also another kind\nof gotcha on networking,\n\n623\n00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:42.680\nis not only are there port numbers, there\nis a whole bunch of terminologies, and we\n\n624\n00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:45.760\nhaven't even gotten into all the acronyms\nthat we'll be facing in the future.\n\n625\n00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.100\n>> Yeah.\nNow you see why systems administration is\n\n626\n00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.980\na whole lot more easy than\nnetwork administration.\n\n627\n00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:54.980\nThere's so much more, well, there's a lot\nof technical aspects to networking.\n\n628\n00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:59.870\nI do love the whole idea of packets,\nand frames, and segments, because,\n\n629\n00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:04.800\nbasically, what all it's telling you is,\nif I have a segment, right?\n\n630\n00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:09.580\nIt's letting me know that only that layer\nfive type of talking needs to occur.\n\n631\n00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:14.070\nIt's all the other data is just kind of\nlike put inside of the segment, sealed up,\n\n632\n00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:16.660\nand it says all that you need\nto know about this segment\n\n633\n00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:18.650\nis right here on\nthe segment header itself.\n\n634\n00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:21.080\nAnd that can deal with it and\ncan pass it on accordingly.\n\n635\n00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:24.070\nIf it needs to get into layer four,\nnot a problem.\n\n636\n00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:26.040\nIt strips that segment,\nopens the segment up and\n\n637\n00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:27.700\nsays let me see the layer four data.\n\n638\n00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:29.500\nOh, okay, there it is right there.\n\n639\n00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.170\nNow I can pass it on accordingly.\n\n640\n00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:33.490\nSo each one of those\ndifferent types of maps, and\n\n641\n00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:37.070\nthat's why we differentiate\nbetween segments and frames.\n\n642\n00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:38.840\nWhat device needs this, right?\n\n643\n00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:42.840\nIf I have a device that works on layer\ntwo, a switch or a abridge, right?\n\n644\n00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.450\nThose are layer two devices.\n\n645\n00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:46.540\nThey don't care about IP.\n\n646\n00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:52.700\nThey have no idea or care about IP at all,\nand that is a layer three protocol.\n\n647\n00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:57.060\nSo they just deal with that\nlovely little data links that's,\n\n648\n00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:59.055\ncan't think of it now,\nblew out of my head.\n\n649\n00:32:59.055 --> 00:33:00.420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well, what's the.\n\n650\n00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:01.310\n>> Data link layer?\n\n651\n00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:02.230\n>> Yeah.\n>> Networking layer?\n\n652\n00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.760\n>> The frame.\n\n653\n00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:03.290\n>> Frame.\n\n654\n00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:03.900\nOh frame, sorry.\n\n655\n00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:04.885\n>> Yeah, frames, yes.\n\n656\n00:33:04.885 --> 00:33:05.780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> As you can see,\n\n657\n00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.570\nit gets really confusing at this point.\n\n658\n00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:09.120\nAll they care about is that frame.\n\n659\n00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.860\nSo that's all it's gonna look at.\n\n660\n00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:14.720\nIf it needs anything else, it'll dive into\nit, but other than that, it just wants to\n\n661\n00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.040\nwork with those frames and pass them\nalong through its layer 2 network.\n\n662\n00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:20.900\nIf it needs to go somewhere else,\nit'll look at those headers and\n\n663\n00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:24.700\npass it along to the device that utilizes\nthose different types of headers,\n\n664\n00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:26.570\nmaking it very much segmented, right.\n\n665\n00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:29.654\n>> There is no doubt that this\nis an important concept here.\n\n666\n00:33:29.654 --> 00:33:34.440\nSo our beginning foray, right,\nis just understanding that there has to be\n\n667\n00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:38.080\ncommunication that goes on between two\ndevices, and the way that they've arrived\n\n668\n00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.980\nat that today,\nbecause we all have different devices,\n\n669\n00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:42.790\nis that they've come up with\na network communication model.\n\n670\n00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:45.770\nAnd even that breaks down of course\ninto portions of ports and protocols.\n\n671\n00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:48.240\nBreak down into the type of traffic\nthat we're actually doing, so\n\n672\n00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:52.180\nthat we all get the data that we need when\nwe're sending data inside of that network.\n\n673\n00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:56.160\nSo there's a lot more information to go,\nbut that's a good foundational level for\n\n674\n00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:56.710\nus to be at.\n\n675\n00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:58.920\n>> That's right.\nAll right, Ronnie, thanks a lot for that.\n\n676\n00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.310\nYou did a great job explaining this to us,\n\n677\n00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:03.030\neven though it is\na little bit complicated.\n\n678\n00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:06.405\nJust take you a little bit of time, watch\nthese episodes a couple of times, and\n\n679\n00:34:06.405 --> 00:34:07.675\nit'll start to sink in.\n\n680\n00:34:07.675 --> 00:34:09.075\nIt'll start to make sense and\n\n681\n00:34:09.075 --> 00:34:12.560\nyou will one day become networking master,\nmuch like my friend Ronnie here.\n\n682\n00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:13.475\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right Ronnie,\n\n683\n00:34:13.475 --> 00:34:14.895\nwe're gonna go ahead and call it a day.\n\n684\n00:34:14.895 --> 00:34:16.435\nThanks for watching this episode.\n\n685\n00:34:16.435 --> 00:34:18.125\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n686\n00:34:18.125 --> 00:34:19.875\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n687\n00:34:19.875 --> 00:34:20.595\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n688\n00:34:20.595 --> 00:34:22.825\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n689\n00:34:22.825 --> 00:34:28.090\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

to\nanother great episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.230\nI'm your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n5\n00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.120\nHere with me in the studio, yet\nagain today, is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.350\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.580\n>> It is going well today.\n\n8\n00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.398\nIt's another great day that we\nget to be right here in studio.\n\n9\n00:00:23.398 --> 00:00:26.099\nAnd we're taking a look at\nthe Microsoft Technology Associate.\n\n10\n00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.330\nThe 98-366 exam on\nnetworking fundamentals.\n\n11\n00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.230\nYes, I actually remembered that whole\nthing without actually messing up.\n\n12\n00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.335\nPutting the fun back in networking,\nthat's what Daniel and I are doing.\n\n13\n00:00:36.335 --> 00:00:38.850\n[LAUGH] Is we're going to put\nthe fun back in networking.\n\n14\n00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.460\nAnd today, we're taking a look at well,\nIP addressing.\n\n15\n00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.550\nIn previous episodes,\nwe took a look at the OSI model,\n\n16\n00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.530\nwhich truly does help us to understand the\nconcept of communication between devices.\n\n17\n00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.090\nBut when we start to\nactually have to send data\n\n18\n00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.340\nwell the foundational aspect of that is\ngoing to be IP addressing right Daniel.\n\n19\n00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.890\n>> That's right.\n\n20\n00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.300\nWithout an IP address I can't get\ndata to go where I want it to go.\n\n21\n00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.490\nIt's just like a letter\nout in the mail system.\n\n22\n00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.075\nI gotta have an address to send it to or\nit's going nowhere real fast.\n\n23\n00:01:04.075 --> 00:01:06.825\nSame thing with our computers,\nyou've gotta have a way of differentiating\n\n24\n00:01:06.825 --> 00:01:11.805\nhow to send data from one computer or\nanother based off of some sort of address.\n\n25\n00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:16.235\nIP addressing is what the standard is for\ntoday's computer networks and\n\n26\n00:01:16.235 --> 00:01:18.050\nRonnie says we're gonna\nput the fun back into it.\n\n27\n00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.065\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We sure need to because\n\n28\n00:01:20.065 --> 00:01:23.735\nit can definitely be a little daunting\nif you've never seen this stuff before,\n\n29\n00:01:23.735 --> 00:01:25.650\nit can be a little difficult.\n\n30\n00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.522\nBut we're gonna try to\nhelp you through that.\n\n31\n00:01:27.522 --> 00:01:29.230\n[LAUGH] Ronnie is a master at this stuff.\n\n32\n00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.380\nI've seen him at work.\n\n33\n00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.122\nYou're going to be mystified at his\nability to explain this, right, Ronnie?\n\n34\n00:01:34.122 --> 00:01:35.201\n>> I doubt it but [LAUGH]-\n>> And go.\n\n35\n00:01:35.201 --> 00:01:38.140\n[LAUGH]\n>> That ends up working for us but when we\n\n36\n00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.550\nstart taking a look at IP addressing, it\nis a little bit more of the dry material.\n\n37\n00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.370\nThat we have to understand that we're\ngonna be doing networking at all.\n\n38\n00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.480\nAnd it is so foundational.\n\n39\n00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.760\nIf we don't understand this concept,\na lot of everything else that we\n\n40\n00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.810\ntry to build networking off of is\nreally not gonna make sense either.\n\n41\n00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.990\nSo when we start talking about that\nidea of IP addressing, there's really\n\n42\n00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.780\ntwo different versions of it that you and\nI are going to encounter right now.\n\n43\n00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.070\nThere's what we call IP version 4,\nand also IP version 6.\n\n44\n00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.600\nNow you might be wondering like\nI did at some point, well,\n\n45\n00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.030\nwhat happened to version 1 and\nversion 5 and versions 1 through 3 and 5?\n\n46\n00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.850\nWell, who knows?\n\n47\n00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:16.640\n>> Leave those out, Ronnie.\n\n48\n00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.030\n>> Yeah,\nwe don't really wanna get into them.\n\n49\n00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.010\n>> Don't talk about those.\n\n50\n00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.036\n>> But the functional ones that we\nactually are dealing with today,\n\n51\n00:02:22.036 --> 00:02:24.908\nof course are two of them,\nthe IP version 4 and IP version 6.\n\n52\n00:02:24.908 --> 00:02:27.612\nToday we're gonna focus in on IPv4.\n\n53\n00:02:27.612 --> 00:02:31.660\nAnd the reason why need to, it's still\nthe protocol that's being used today.\n\n54\n00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.220\nAnd I just use that word, protocol.\n\n55\n00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.980\nAnd that's actually the key for us.\n\n56\n00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.580\nRemember that when we start talking\nthen about being able to send data\n\n57\n00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.310\nfrom one machine to the other one,\n\n58\n00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.610\nwe end up using what we call\ndifferent protocols to help us out.\n\n59\n00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.310\nNow, in those protocols,\nright, we've heard other ones.\n\n60\n00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.460\nWe talked about TCP as well as UDP,\n\n61\n00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.650\nthe transmission control protocol as\nwell as the user datagram protocol.\n\n62\n00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.710\nAnd if you're going, now, I don't remember\nseeing any of that in this episode.\n\n63\n00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.060\nWell, that's because we did have another\nepisode where we did talk about those.\n\n64\n00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.290\nWell, those are protocols, and protocols\nare essentially rules that we use so\n\n65\n00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.480\nthat we know we're gonna be able\nto send data back and forth.\n\n66\n00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.070\nWell, the most important protocol that\nyou and I end up using to transmit data\n\n67\n00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:18.070\nfrom source to destination is gonna be\nwhat we call an IP version 4 address.\n\n68\n00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.250\nNow that address has been around for\na long, long time.\n\n69\n00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.760\nSo long and that we've actually\nused up all the addresses so\n\n70\n00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.600\nmuch so that we really did have to\ncome up with a new version of that,\n\n71\n00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.350\nwhich is going to be IP version six.\n\n72\n00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.730\nAnd we will have another segment\nin which we'll deal with that one.\n\n73\n00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.720\nBut at this point here, we want to\nunderstand that we're going to actually\n\n74\n00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.360\ntalk about specifically IP version\nfour is what we want to talk about.\n\n75\n00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.730\nSo, when I emphasize a very factor of this\nprotocol, I cannot over emphasize that it\n\n76\n00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.210\nis the most important protocol\nthat you and I will learn about.\n\n77\n00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.010\nIf you're new to networking, this is where\nit gets a little more confusing, because\n\n78\n00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.190\nnow we're starting to deal with numbers\nand addresses that we have to worry about.\n\n79\n00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.360\nAnd we also start dealing with concepts\nthat we may not have actually dealt with\n\n80\n00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.080\nbefore, such as binary numbering as well.\n\n81\n00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.870\nAnd so we do need to talk\na little bit about that.\n\n82\n00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.890\nSo let me go ahead and show some of\nthe bullet points that I made on my screen\n\n83\n00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.080\nto try and help us out to understand\nwhat we're seeing it, right?\n\n84\n00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.240\nSo, remember, it's the most important\nprotocol that we use in networking by far\n\n85\n00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.540\nof all the ones,\n\n86\n00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.340\nif I want to send data from me to you,\nI have to have your IP address.\n\n87\n00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.000\nIt's not because I need\nto know what it is,\n\n88\n00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.320\nit's because my machine\nneeds to know what it is.\n\n89\n00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.240\nSo even if you're sitting out there on\nthe Internet somewhere and I'm here in my\n\n90\n00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.790\noffice, if I want to get data from me to\nyou it has to be out there somewhere.\n\n91\n00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.075\nThen, this actually It represents what\nwe call a pool of addresses here.\n\n92\n00:04:38.075 --> 00:04:41.415\nIn IP version 4 there's\na pool of addresses,\n\n93\n00:04:41.415 --> 00:04:44.965\nit's actually two to\nthe 32nd power in size.\n\n94\n00:04:44.965 --> 00:04:48.415\nNow if you're like me and\nyou don't know a lot about binary,\n\n95\n00:04:48.415 --> 00:04:51.665\nthere are some things that you\ndo need to pay attention to and\n\n96\n00:04:51.665 --> 00:04:55.615\nthat is actually going to be how big\nthis pool of numbers really is which is\n\n97\n00:04:55.615 --> 00:05:01.460\na little bit under 4.3 billion\npossible numbers that we can use.\n\n98\n00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.373\nNow when we start you go,\nman, that's a large number.\n\n99\n00:05:05.373 --> 00:05:08.840\nThat is an incredible number,\nif you're actually gonna use that.\n\n100\n00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:15.500\nBut the very fact is, in today,\nthe time of the recording\n\n101\n00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.710\nof our episode today those numbers have\nnow been depleted on the Internet.\n\n102\n00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.390\nAnd what we mean by that is you\ncan't get any new ones out there.\n\n103\n00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.860\nSo they're not making up new ones.\n\n104\n00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.940\nThey're just saying hey, it's depleted.\n\n105\n00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.560\nYou can't get new addresses that aren't\nalready currently out there, and\n\n106\n00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.820\nthe limitation is up as of this point.\n\n107\n00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.050\nSo that actually means that what we have\nto learn is a little bit more, right?\n\n108\n00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.080\nIt's not that there aren't any available,\nit just means that they're not actually\n\n109\n00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.140\nreleasing any,\nthere's none actually left in reserve.\n\n110\n00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.750\nThose last few have been assigned\nout there and they are ready to go.\n\n111\n00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.450\nSo that's the 4.3 billion,\nand you might be going,\n\n112\n00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.200\nhow in the world did that end up being\nthat particular number and size?\n\n113\n00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.500\nWell, it has to do with binary,\nis what it has to do with.\n\n114\n00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.620\nAnd the very fact is in binaries we're\njust using a string of ones and zeros, and\n\n115\n00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.060\nthey decided 32 bits would be enough,\nabout 4.3 billion.\n\n116\n00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.830\nAnd that's because at the time when this\nstarted coming out, they thought about\n\n117\n00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.170\nthe idea of how many addresses would\nreally need to be used over all.\n\n118\n00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.450\nAnd right about 4 billion people were\non the planet at that point in time,\n\n119\n00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.190\nand they thought, maybe if we\nassigned a single IP address to every\n\n120\n00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.340\nsingle person on the planet.\n\n121\n00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.220\nThat should be enough.\n\n122\n00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.640\nWhy?\nNot everybody's ever going to get\n\n123\n00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.540\nan IP address for\nevery single person on the planet.\n\n124\n00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.670\nBut, then they did\nsomething silly which is,\n\n125\n00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.390\nthey started dividing it up when realized\nthat they weren't going to do that.\n\n126\n00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:35.660\nFor big gigantic companies, medium large\ncompanies, and then small companies,\n\n127\n00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.870\nwell, and all of a sudden, it started\neating up the space or these numbers.\n\n128\n00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.030\nVery quickly too.\n\n129\n00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.480\nNow Daniel also made a more important\npoint for us than just the availability of\n\n130\n00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.790\nthese numbers, which is what each\nof these numbers really do for\n\n131\n00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:55.760\nus on the internet, as well as inside\nof our own local area networks.\n\n132\n00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.280\nOn the Internet, it is important that\nevery single device that we connect to\n\n133\n00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.010\nhas a unique address.\n\n134\n00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.170\nSo just like what Daniel was referring to,\n\n135\n00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:09.690\nthe ability to have an address which only\nthe mail is sent to you is actually clear.\n\n136\n00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.160\nSame thing on the Internet.\n\n137\n00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.980\nIf we need to connect to that device, we\nneed to make sure that we have the right\n\n138\n00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.885\nIP address to connect to that device.\n\n139\n00:07:17.885 --> 00:07:20.305\nSo every sending device and\n\n140\n00:07:20.305 --> 00:07:25.775\nevery receiving device on the Internet\nis gonna have an IP address on it.\n\n141\n00:07:25.775 --> 00:07:28.445\nNow, you might be thinking\nlike I did at one point, well,\n\n142\n00:07:28.445 --> 00:07:32.205\nwhy does it have to be an IP address,\nwhy can't it be some other address?\n\n143\n00:07:32.205 --> 00:07:33.455\nWell, in theory, it could be.\n\n144\n00:07:33.455 --> 00:07:35.710\nThere are other protocols\nthat are out there.\n\n145\n00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:39.500\nBut the IP addressing is the one\nthat won out on the Internet.\n\n146\n00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.080\nSo that's why we use IP addressing.\n\n147\n00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.000\nIt kind of became what we call\na de facto standard, and then it\n\n148\n00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.630\nactually became really standardized\nout there, where it said look.\n\n149\n00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.420\nHere's the addressing scheme that\nwe're going to use on the Internet.\n\n150\n00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.285\nSo at the beginning,\n\n151\n00:07:51.285 --> 00:07:54.073\nyou might have had a few that started\nto be a little bit different, but\n\n152\n00:07:54.073 --> 00:07:57.170\nthen when everybody started saying,\nwell, IP addresses are the way to go.\n\n153\n00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:01.059\nThen the entire Internet pretty much\nconverted over on that as well.\n\n154\n00:08:01.059 --> 00:08:05.117\nNow, because it actually helps\ndefine every device as being unique,\n\n155\n00:08:05.117 --> 00:08:06.140\nit really does.\n\n156\n00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.280\nAnd that means that we do have that\nlimitation of about that 32 bit\n\n157\n00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.040\naddress that we're talking about as well.\n\n158\n00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.270\nNow, when it comes down\nto the addressing itself,\n\n159\n00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:20.350\nwe need to know where in the world\nthese addresses come from.\n\n160\n00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:22.860\nSo where did that actually\nend up coming from?\n\n161\n00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.850\nWell, there's some organizations\nout there that are responsible for\n\n162\n00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:29.940\nassigning addresses is what\nwe have available to us.\n\n163\n00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.018\nAnd so, they are the ones\nin charge of saying, hey,\n\n164\n00:08:32.018 --> 00:08:33.727\nhere's how the addresses are handed out.\n\n165\n00:08:33.727 --> 00:08:35.020\nNow, there are groups out there, and\n\n166\n00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:36.934\nyou can actually do a lot more\nresearch on the Internet.\n\n167\n00:08:36.934 --> 00:08:39.784\nSo that you can figure out what those\ngroups are and what they do, but\n\n168\n00:08:39.784 --> 00:08:41.090\nthat's where they come from.\n\n169\n00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:45.250\nThere's a group out there, The Internet\nCorporation for Assigned Names and\n\n170\n00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.840\nNumbers is out there,\nand there's also IANA.\n\n171\n00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.000\nThere's a few different ones that\nreally are in control of how these\n\n172\n00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.640\naddresses get out there.\n\n173\n00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.380\nSo that's where they get out\nthere on the Internet itself.\n\n174\n00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:59.030\nNow, when we start taking a look at that,\nso let's see.\n\n175\n00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:02.013\nICANN is an organization, and IANA, and\n\n176\n00:09:02.013 --> 00:09:07.450\nthere's several other ones that\nare out there as well, and others.\n\n177\n00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:12.060\nBut, we need to define the way that\nthese addresses come about too.\n\n178\n00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.010\nSo what do they look like?\n\n179\n00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:18.280\nLook like.\n\n180\n00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:18.930\nI can't spell.\n\n181\n00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:26.070\nOkay so, in all reality they\nare a 32 bit binary number.\n\n182\n00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.300\nNow when I say that it\ndoesn't really mean anything.\n\n183\n00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.129\nBut the way that it would end up\nlooking is something like this.\n\n184\n00:09:35.918 --> 00:09:37.430\nSo there's eight bits and\n\n185\n00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:42.400\nif I multiply by that times four,\nhere's a possible well maybe.\n\n186\n00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:48.500\nHere's what an address might look like,\nokay?\n\n187\n00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.940\nSo if we were to take that,\nthat's what you would normally see.\n\n188\n00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:56.550\nIn all reality, this is what\nthe computer ends up seeing, to try and\n\n189\n00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.870\nbe able to send data from\none device to another.\n\n190\n00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.886\nNow the problem is, you and I though,\n\n191\n00:10:01.886 --> 00:10:06.045\nwe don't understand what that address\nactually means cuz we're not actually\n\n192\n00:10:06.045 --> 00:10:08.642\ngoing to be computers\ntrying to figure this out.\n\n193\n00:10:08.642 --> 00:10:12.018\nSo the people got a little bit smarter,\nand they started saying.\n\n194\n00:10:12.018 --> 00:10:15.676\nLook we need to break this up into\nsomething a little more logical, and\n\n195\n00:10:15.676 --> 00:10:19.400\nso logically, and I know you're going\nto probably say are you joking?\n\n196\n00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.240\nNo I'm not.\n\n197\n00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.525\n>> Not all of us are mathematical savants.\n\n198\n00:10:22.525 --> 00:10:24.100\n[LAUGH]\n>> I know, yeah.\n\n199\n00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:24.950\nSo what did they do?\n\n200\n00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:27.710\nThey tried to make it easier, and what\nthey did is they said look let's divide\n\n201\n00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:31.710\nthis up into what four\nsections of eight bits each.\n\n202\n00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:33.750\nAnd that will make it easier.\n\n203\n00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:37.780\nWell it does make it easier\nif you understand binary.\n\n204\n00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:42.560\nBut again, yeah if you don't understand\nbinary it doesn't make it any easier.\n\n205\n00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.904\nSo when they started doing this, they\ndivided it up instead of a single 32 bit\n\n206\n00:10:45.904 --> 00:10:53.810\naddress they started actually\nrepresenting it as, well, four.\n\n207\n00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:56.770\nOctets, in other words, eight bits each.\n\n208\n00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:00.860\nWell, even the four octets are a little\nbit more unusual, cuz you're still like,\n\n209\n00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.060\nokay, that still doesn't mean anything.\n\n210\n00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:07.180\nSo then they made it easier for\nyou and me, by changing it and saying,\n\n211\n00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:11.050\nlook, when we define this,\nit's gonna be like this instead.\n\n212\n00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:14.580\nOops, I just copied\nthe same number over again.\n\n213\n00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.350\nThat's why I'm actually doing it this way.\n\n214\n00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:23.230\nAnd now you have what is called\ndotted decimal notation.\n\n215\n00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:31.400\nAnd when you read a number like this, the\nway that you read it is 192.192.192.192.\n\n216\n00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.880\nAnd you might have actually seen this.\n\n217\n00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.360\nIf this is your first time exposed\nto the idea of network addressing,\n\n218\n00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.310\nif you hear this on TV shows and\n\n219\n00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:40.490\nyou know something about networking,\nyou kinda hear somebody go.\n\n220\n00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:42.976\nAnd then you go oh,\ndid they actually say that.\n\n221\n00:11:42.976 --> 00:11:46.892\nCuz I was watching some TV show one\nnight and I heard the person say it.\n\n222\n00:11:46.892 --> 00:11:51.159\nIt was the IP address is\none nine two period, zero,\n\n223\n00:11:51.159 --> 00:11:56.230\nzero four, and you're like,\nwhat in the world is going on?\n\n224\n00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:58.813\nAnd then you realize\nthe script writer wrote that,\n\n225\n00:11:58.813 --> 00:12:02.309\nthinking that the actress would\nactually know exactly how to say it.\n\n226\n00:12:02.309 --> 00:12:04.352\nAnd they just didn't know\nhow that was actually done.\n\n227\n00:12:04.352 --> 00:12:07.983\n>> Now my favorite is when they say,\noh, yeah,\n\n228\n00:12:07.983 --> 00:12:13.350\nthere's the IP address of 297.322 and\nyou're like.\n\n229\n00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:14.025\nWait a minute.\n\n230\n00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:15.840\n[LAUGHTER] That's not gonna work.\n\n231\n00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.590\n>> And Daniel brings up a good point.\n\n232\n00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:22.549\nBecause of the limitation of\nthe way that binary works,\n\n233\n00:12:22.549 --> 00:12:28.892\nthe highest number that we can get\nin each octet, in each octet, here.\n\n234\n00:12:28.892 --> 00:12:34.184\nOops, octet is going to be, well, 255.\n\n235\n00:12:34.184 --> 00:12:35.601\nAnd you might be wondering, why is that?\n\n236\n00:12:35.601 --> 00:12:40.101\nWell because the lowest number that\nwe can get is gonna be a zero.\n\n237\n00:12:45.017 --> 00:12:50.720\nAnd that is because these are actually\ndecimal representations of the binary.\n\n238\n00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.630\nSo if I take a look at the highest number\nthat I can get with eight bits of binary,\n\n239\n00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.160\nit's gonna be well, eight ones.\n\n240\n00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.710\nI hope that's actually eight ones.\n\n241\n00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:04.093\nAnd then,\nthe lowest number that I can get,\n\n242\n00:13:04.093 --> 00:13:07.490\nwell it be would be eight zeros, here.\n\n243\n00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:10.241\nSo if we were to take that and\nwe were to convert that, and\n\n244\n00:13:10.241 --> 00:13:13.184\nthen you actually understand\nthe binary conversion of it.\n\n245\n00:13:13.184 --> 00:13:17.256\nThe highest number if you add up all\nof those numbers together in binary,\n\n246\n00:13:17.256 --> 00:13:18.476\nyou get this 255.\n\n247\n00:13:18.476 --> 00:13:22.708\nNow if you're saying Ronnie,\nI don't believe you, well let me take this\n\n248\n00:13:22.708 --> 00:13:27.225\ncalculator out here and let's take a look\njust briefly a moment of doing this.\n\n249\n00:13:27.225 --> 00:13:31.142\nLet me put on my glasses\nfirst before I do this, here.\n\n250\n00:13:31.142 --> 00:13:33.579\nLet's see,\nit's not the scientific one I need,\n\n251\n00:13:33.579 --> 00:13:36.141\nit's the programmer one\nthat I believe I need here.\n\n252\n00:13:36.141 --> 00:13:38.850\nYep, so if I take the binary number, so\n\n253\n00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:42.809\nI've turned it into binary,\nand now I add in eight ones.\n\n254\n00:13:45.517 --> 00:13:48.970\nAnd then I convert that to decimal number.\n\n255\n00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:50.480\nI did seven ones there.\n\n256\n00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.580\nSee I was like, well, that's not right.\n\n257\n00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:53.550\nSo I need that again.\n\n258\n00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:54.518\nSee?\n\n259\n00:13:54.518 --> 00:13:58.809\nI tell you,\nmy typing ability is really terrible.\n\n260\n00:13:58.809 --> 00:14:02.020\nAll right, there we go, and\nthen I turn it into decimal.\n\n261\n00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.960\nThere it is, there's 255.\n\n262\n00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:09.280\nSo if I clear that out, and then I do the\nsame thing here in binary with eight, oh.\n\n263\n00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.010\nIt's not gonna let me do\neight zeroes here, but\n\n264\n00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:12.940\nyou can kinda guess what eight\nzeroes is actually gonna be.\n\n265\n00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.240\nWell, zero.\n\n266\n00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.340\nSo if we were doing that\nconversion right now.\n\n267\n00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:17.685\nWe're not gonna take the time to do that.\n\n268\n00:14:17.685 --> 00:14:20.934\nWe just need to be able to identify\nthese addresses what we need to do.\n\n269\n00:14:20.934 --> 00:14:24.044\nSo there's a couple of key\nthings that we actually need and\n\n270\n00:14:24.044 --> 00:14:27.476\nthis is one of them right here\nthat Daniel actually pointed out.\n\n271\n00:14:27.476 --> 00:14:32.418\nYou need to know that in each octat\nwhat the highest number can be and\n\n272\n00:14:32.418 --> 00:14:36.500\nalso what the lowest number\ncan also be here too.\n\n273\n00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.290\nAnd this is important.\n\n274\n00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:44.630\nLike Daniel said, if you hear numbers that\nare actually outside of these ranges in\n\n275\n00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:51.190\nhere, this 327.563.400.10, well that\ncan't actually be a proper IP address.\n\n276\n00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:53.880\nAnd the reason why is because\nit's limited by what we can do in\n\n277\n00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.840\neach octet as far as the binary.\n\n278\n00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.559\nThe range is between 0 and 255.\n\n279\n00:14:58.559 --> 00:15:01.267\nAnd that will help you out\nwhen you do see numbers.\n\n280\n00:15:01.267 --> 00:15:06.276\nSo for example, then an invalid\n\n281\n00:15:06.276 --> 00:15:13.891\nwould be 256.274.305.47 okay?\n\n282\n00:15:13.891 --> 00:15:20.017\nBut, anything that you actually also\nsee then, oops, as a valid, example.\n\n283\n00:15:20.017 --> 00:15:20.642\n>> Vlad.\n\n284\n00:15:20.642 --> 00:15:21.391\n>> Vlad.\n\n285\n00:15:21.391 --> 00:15:22.351\n>> They're edraculated.\n\n286\n00:15:22.351 --> 00:15:28.142\n>> They're edraculated,\nyeah, that's right.\n\n287\n00:15:28.142 --> 00:15:29.267\nOops.\n\n288\n00:15:29.267 --> 00:15:30.392\n245.\n\n289\n00:15:30.392 --> 00:15:32.434\nThat would also be a valid IP address.\n\n290\n00:15:32.434 --> 00:15:34.810\nI probably just stole someone's\nIP address and didn't realize it.\n\n291\n00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:37.346\n>> Well,\nI was gonna say they probably do this for\n\n292\n00:15:37.346 --> 00:15:40.935\nthe same reason they do\ntelephone numbers as 555-2013.\n\n293\n00:15:40.935 --> 00:15:43.476\nOr whatever right,\nthere are no phone numbers of 555.\n\n294\n00:15:43.476 --> 00:15:45.309\nPeople on TV aren't calling anybody.\n\n295\n00:15:45.309 --> 00:15:48.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, there's also nobody with\n\n296\n00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:53.688\nan internet I.P.\naddress of 297.23 dot whatever.\n\n297\n00:15:53.688 --> 00:15:55.684\nIt doesn't actually exist.\n\n298\n00:15:55.684 --> 00:15:58.610\nThey don't want people because These\nnumbers actually mean something.\n\n299\n00:15:58.610 --> 00:15:59.600\n>> Yes they do.\n\n300\n00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.044\nThe numbers actually\nare representative of a couple\n\n301\n00:16:03.044 --> 00:16:07.270\nof different groups of addresses\nthat we have in place.\n\n302\n00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:09.910\nSo, when you take a look at these\naddresses, they are actually\n\n303\n00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:14.200\nrepresentative of the class of IP\naddresses that may be out there.\n\n304\n00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.880\nSo when you start talking about that,\nthey are,let's see right here.\n\n305\n00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:23.960\nSo I'm gonna say that there's actually\nthree classes of, if I can spell it,\n\n306\n00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:30.530\nof IP addresses, and this should make it,\nI hope, a lot easier.\n\n307\n00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:38.360\nThere's a class A, there's a Class B, and\nthere's also a class C of addresses here.\n\n308\n00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.540\nNow, when we break this up,\nlet me see if I can get to the,\n\n309\n00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:45.840\nprobably just going to make\nthat a complete mess here.\n\n310\n00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:50.630\nIn a class A, this represents\neverything between, what is it,\n\n311\n00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:55.360\none, the entire one network,\nall the way through 127,\n\n312\n00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.020\nor actually 126 is the valid\nnumbers that we have.\n\n313\n00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:02.500\nSo, when you take a look at this, that's\nwhat happens is that that represents\n\n314\n00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.820\na range of addresses here\nthat we have available to us.\n\n315\n00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:07.730\nNow in each of these networks,\n\n316\n00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:12.840\nthese 126 networks that are represented,\nwe can have millions, okay?\n\n317\n00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:16.820\nSo as far as networks go there's\nabout 126 that are valid and\n\n318\n00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:23.380\nthen the number of devices,\nor hosts, per network and\n\n319\n00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:31.030\nthat's gonna be about 14,777,214 possible\nnumbers of devices for each network.\n\n320\n00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:33.910\nSo that one network can actually\nhave 14 million devices,\n\n321\n00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:35.760\nall the way through the 126 network.\n\n322\n00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.650\nEach one of them can have those addresses,\nthose numbers.\n\n323\n00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:45.630\nClass B, See if I can do that\na little bit better here.\n\n324\n00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:50.750\nLet me copy this so I don't continue\non to try and type out everything.\n\n325\n00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.220\nMake it a little bit easier here.\n\n326\n00:17:55.430 --> 00:18:03.110\nThis one begins at 128 and\ngoes all the way through the 191 network,\n\n327\n00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:12.430\nand this one is, I think is, 31,000 or\nactually may be 16,000+ networks.\n\n328\n00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:14.610\nI think this is what we have.\n\n329\n00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:18.690\nSo 16,000 plus networks and\neach of these can\n\n330\n00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:25.260\nhave 65,535 possible device, actually 34\npossible devices per network as well.\n\n331\n00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:31.456\nAnd then class C is actually designed for\nsmall networks.\n\n332\n00:18:31.456 --> 00:18:36.215\nAnd this begins at 192 and\ngoes all the way\n\n333\n00:18:36.215 --> 00:18:41.233\nthrough the entirety of the 21D3 network,\n\n334\n00:18:41.233 --> 00:18:47.291\nand there are 2 million plus\npossible networks there.\n\n335\n00:18:47.291 --> 00:18:54.030\nAnd each of those networks can have\nabout 254 hosts per network as well.\n\n336\n00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:57.500\nSo they do represent ranges\nthat we can actually use.\n\n337\n00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.930\nNow, in the early days of networking on\nthe Internet, that's what would happen is\n\n338\n00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:05.960\nyou would go and you would get assigned,\nlet's say, an entire class B network.\n\n339\n00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.173\nWell, if you did that, that'd mean you\nactually had a single network that\n\n340\n00:19:09.173 --> 00:19:11.167\nwould support up to 65,000 addresses.\n\n341\n00:19:11.167 --> 00:19:13.617\nClass A, of course,\nwould be millions of them, but\n\n342\n00:19:13.617 --> 00:19:15.740\nyou can see what started to happen.\n\n343\n00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:19.680\nThere were a lot of companies right away\nthat went for a class A address, and\n\n344\n00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:23.800\nthen all of a sudden what was left\nwas class B addresses and class Cs,\n\n345\n00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.800\nwhich now meant that, hey, we were gonna\nrun out of IP addresses very quickly.\n\n346\n00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:32.190\nSo, the foresight was not exactly\nas grand as they thought it was\n\n347\n00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:35.790\nwhen they divided up the way that this\nnetworking scheme would end up working.\n\n348\n00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:38.490\nSo these addresses started\ndisappearing very quickly.\n\n349\n00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:40.400\nClass A, almost overnight.\n\n350\n00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:45.900\nClass B was soon behind, and then this\nis where the smarter people out there,\n\n351\n00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:50.550\nthose groups, started saying, we need\na new addressing scheme to help us out.\n\n352\n00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:53.700\nSo all of these addresses that you see\nright here are really the ones that you\n\n353\n00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:55.750\nwill see out there on the Internet.\n\n354\n00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:58.200\nNow, it doesn't matter so\nmuch about the classes anymore and\n\n355\n00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.050\nwe'll talk about that in\na little bit of time.\n\n356\n00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:03.394\nBut you do need to at least\nknow these basic classes and\n\n357\n00:20:03.394 --> 00:20:06.749\nthese ranges that you wanna\npay attention to as well.\n\n358\n00:20:06.749 --> 00:20:08.375\nYep, all right.\n\n359\n00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:12.995\nNow when we start taking a look at\nthese addresses you might be wondering\n\n360\n00:20:12.995 --> 00:20:16.845\nhow in the world do we get these\nnumber of hosts per network or\n\n361\n00:20:16.845 --> 00:20:19.542\nnumber of devices per network, as well.\n\n362\n00:20:19.542 --> 00:20:24.332\nAnd that's because, with an IP address,\nthat IP address represents two different\n\n363\n00:20:24.332 --> 00:20:27.041\nportions, is what it represents here,\nokay?\n\n364\n00:20:27.041 --> 00:20:31.360\nSo, an IP address is sorta\nlike a street address, right?\n\n365\n00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:35.780\nIf you live at 123 Main Street,\nright, you have your house number and\n\n366\n00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.940\nyou have the street as well.\n\n367\n00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:39.580\nSo an IP address does the same thing.\n\n368\n00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:44.167\nIt's broken up into a network portion\nas well as into a host portion of\n\n369\n00:20:44.167 --> 00:20:45.124\nthe address.\n\n370\n00:20:45.124 --> 00:20:48.850\nSo if I were to give an address for\nexample,\n\n371\n00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:53.613\nlet's take 192.168.1.0 as the address,\n\n372\n00:20:53.613 --> 00:21:00.667\nnormally there is following what's behind\nit is what we call a subnet mask here.\n\n373\n00:21:00.667 --> 00:21:03.624\nSo let's say that we have an IP\naddress and we have a subnet mask.\n\n374\n00:21:03.624 --> 00:21:08.214\nRarely will you see an IP\naddress without a subnet mask,\n\n375\n00:21:08.214 --> 00:21:12.624\nunless somebody actually\nhas typed it incorrectly.\n\n376\n00:21:12.624 --> 00:21:14.666\nSo you normally have something like this.\n\n377\n00:21:14.666 --> 00:21:21.374\nSo here's the IP address,\nAnd here is the subnet mask.\n\n378\n00:21:21.374 --> 00:21:24.828\nWell what we're focusing in\non now is actually this part\n\n379\n00:21:24.828 --> 00:21:27.410\nwhich is the subnet mask itself.\n\n380\n00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:30.680\nThe reason why the subnet mask is\nimportant is because it helps us to\n\n381\n00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:35.530\nidentify how many devices we can\nactually hold on a single network.\n\n382\n00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:40.890\nAnd so when we do that it actually does\neliminate the possibilities of how big\n\n383\n00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:45.210\nthis network is or how small this network\nis and it really does help us out here.\n\n384\n00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:50.390\nThe process that it actually works\non is what we call binary anding.\n\n385\n00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:54.880\nNow we don't really have to get into that\ntoo much but what it does is it's able to\n\n386\n00:21:54.880 --> 00:22:00.660\ntake the network address itself and\nmask it in this way.\n\n387\n00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:01.916\nLet me see if I can grab that.\n\n388\n00:22:01.916 --> 00:22:04.582\n>> And by mask, Ronnie, you're really\ntalking about filtering, right?\n\n389\n00:22:04.582 --> 00:22:05.207\n>> That's it.\n\n390\n00:22:05.207 --> 00:22:08.744\n>> We're filtering through the mask\nto see what network are we on,\n\n391\n00:22:08.744 --> 00:22:11.690\nhow many devices can\nactually be on that network.\n\n392\n00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:14.890\nKind of getting back up into that class A,\nB, and C idea.\n\n393\n00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:20.200\nWhere am I at in regards to the other\nnetworks that are available and\n\n394\n00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.590\nthe devices on those networks?\n\n395\n00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.620\nSo that's what we're talking about\nwhen we come to subnet mask.\n\n396\n00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:27.130\n>> There it is exactly the way\nthat Daniel is describing it.\n\n397\n00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:28.480\nSo I'm just trying to line these up so\n\n398\n00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.960\nthat we can at least\nsee the basics of this.\n\n399\n00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:36.520\nSo, when it comes down to it and the way\nthat the binary works, when we have\n\n400\n00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:40.750\nthis come out, when you have 255 and then\nthe number, well what ends up happening is\n\n401\n00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:46.475\nthat, that number actually can fall\nthrough that line and the same thing here.\n\n402\n00:22:46.475 --> 00:22:50.490\n168 falls through, and\nthen of course we have 001,\n\n403\n00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:54.820\nand now that last one, the way that\nthe zeros work, is it filters it.\n\n404\n00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:58.720\nIt does not allow anything to\npass through it, is what happens.\n\n405\n00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.840\nSo it's right here that all of a sudden,\nyes,\n\n406\n00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:04.340\nyou end up seeing,\nwell this number will actually change.\n\n407\n00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:08.764\nSo even if I put a one up here, well that\nnumber would actually not come through,\n\n408\n00:23:08.764 --> 00:23:10.624\nit'd actually be a 0 down here.\n\n409\n00:23:10.624 --> 00:23:15.700\nEven if I put a 255 up there,\nthat number would actually still be a 0.\n\n410\n00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:22.380\nSo wherever that doesn't match, that\nis now considered your network portion.\n\n411\n00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:27.550\nSo this is now where you actually do\nhave that division of that number.\n\n412\n00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:33.375\nAnd so on the left-hand side, this is\ngonna be what is called your network.\n\n413\n00:23:33.375 --> 00:23:34.291\nI can't spell it.\n\n414\n00:23:34.291 --> 00:23:35.916\nNetwork ID.\n\n415\n00:23:35.916 --> 00:23:40.791\nAnd then to the right hand side of this,\nyou may hear the term host ID.\n\n416\n00:23:40.791 --> 00:23:44.438\nSo however many bits are left\nout of that 32-bit address,\n\n417\n00:23:44.438 --> 00:23:47.666\nthat is how many devices you\ncan have on your network.\n\n418\n00:23:47.666 --> 00:23:51.791\nSo for example, on this side,\nif I have 8 bits here,\n\n419\n00:23:51.791 --> 00:23:55.571\n8 bits here, 8 bits here, that's 24 bits.\n\n420\n00:23:55.571 --> 00:23:57.570\nOut of a 32 bit address.\n\n421\n00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:01.440\nAnd that means there should be\neight bits represented here.\n\n422\n00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:05.430\nWell, that network ID of two to\n\n423\n00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:10.340\nthe eight power really gives me 254,\n256 combinations, so in theory,\n\n424\n00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:13.860\nI am limited to just those\nnumbers on each network.\n\n425\n00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:16.700\nSo that subnet mask really\ndoes help us to do that.\n\n426\n00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:20.500\nSo, if I take a look at my own machine,\nright here, and\n\n427\n00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:27.330\nI run a simple utility here,\ncalled ipconfig.\n\n428\n00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:29.890\nI can press Enter from\nthat command prompt.\n\n429\n00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:34.400\nAnd when I do so, you can see and\nhere it is, here are the addresses.\n\n430\n00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.910\nOops, let me see if I can mark this.\n\n431\n00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:41.170\nHere's the address and\nthe subnet mask, right here.\n\n432\n00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:46.230\nSo if I were to try and identify what\nnetwork that this device was on,\n\n433\n00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:51.870\nI can then go ahead and\nsee that my network is 172.16.95 here,\n\n434\n00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:56.140\nand notice this 12 and the zero and\nit doesn't come through.\n\n435\n00:24:56.140 --> 00:25:01.350\nSo my network would actually be\nthe 172.16.95 network dot zero and\n\n436\n00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:05.420\nthen my machine would actually just be\none of those devices within that network.\n\n437\n00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.070\nThe same thing with\nyour street address and\n\n438\n00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:09.490\nyour house number,\nwhereas that last number there,\n\n439\n00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:13.620\nthat 12 would represent my house number\nwhereas this other part of this address\n\n440\n00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:17.000\nwould represent the street number as well,\nand that's what networks really do.\n\n441\n00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.870\nAnd the subnet mask is what helps them\nto differentiate that portion from\n\n442\n00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:24.020\nthe actual host portion as well.\n\n443\n00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:26.225\nSo you have network ID,\nyou have host ID here.\n\n444\n00:25:26.225 --> 00:25:29.575\n>> Yeah, to help flesh that out\npractically, Ronnie's IP address,\n\n445\n00:25:29.575 --> 00:25:30.939\nwe have that on the screen.\n\n446\n00:25:30.939 --> 00:25:35.707\nRight it's telling us that it\nis 172.1695.12 right if I'm\n\n447\n00:25:35.707 --> 00:25:37.618\nnot mistaken that's 12.\n\n448\n00:25:37.618 --> 00:25:43.084\nNow my IP address might be 172.16.95.13.\n\n449\n00:25:43.084 --> 00:25:46.198\nNow it lets me know I'm different than\nRonnie, we're all on the same network.\n\n450\n00:25:46.198 --> 00:25:51.160\nThat 172.16.95 network,\nthen we're on the same network, so\n\n451\n00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.230\nthat means that we can talk to each other.\n\n452\n00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:56.150\nI don't have to cross into\na different network to get to Ronnie,\n\n453\n00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:58.250\nwe are locally connected.\n\n454\n00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:02.010\nBut the differentiation between\nhis machine and mine, so\n\n455\n00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:05.540\nI know that I get my traffic, he gets his,\n\n456\n00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:10.190\nI don't worry about seeing his traffic,\nis that last octet that we have.\n\n457\n00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:12.890\nThat host id portion,\nthat is the important one\n\n458\n00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:16.970\nwhen it comes to our computers themselves\nare nodes on the network, anything or\n\n459\n00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:20.150\nhosts that's what we use this\nterms they are on the network,\n\n460\n00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:24.627\nthey are the end device that needs an\naddress so they can say, hey I'm Daniel's\n\n461\n00:26:24.627 --> 00:26:28.010\ncomputer, hey I'm Ronnie's computer, and\nnow we can tell the difference between\n\n462\n00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:31.615\nthe two because we have a different\nhost ID on our IP address.\n\n463\n00:26:31.615 --> 00:26:32.930\nThat is why we use this.\n\n464\n00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:35.075\n>> Yeah, the other thing\nthat this also helps us do,\n\n465\n00:26:35.075 --> 00:26:38.702\nthe way that Daniel's describing it, is it\nactually lets us know what devices are on\n\n466\n00:26:38.702 --> 00:26:41.230\nthe same network and\nwhat devices are what we call remote.\n\n467\n00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:44.010\nIn other words,\ndifferent from our network as well,\n\n468\n00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.320\nsometimes that's what\nwe need to distinguish.\n\n469\n00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.780\nAre these two computers\non the same network or\n\n470\n00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:50.810\nare they going to be\non different networks?\n\n471\n00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:53.770\nAnd the subnet mask is what\nhelps us to determine that.\n\n472\n00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:56.280\nIf you take just a simple way\nthat I just did it right,\n\n473\n00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:00.340\ndescribing when you get that 255\nthose numbers are gonna come through.\n\n474\n00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:02.170\nBut if you actually do\nget another number and\n\n475\n00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:05.880\nyou get a zero there, that number is\nprobably not going to come through.\n\n476\n00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:08.400\nSo wherever that number stops right?\n\n477\n00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.770\nThat falls through here.\n\n478\n00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:12.030\nSo this is actually those\nfirst three octets.\n\n479\n00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:13.510\nThen you know that that's\nyour network portion.\n\n480\n00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:17.360\nAnd wherever the other one stops\nthat's going to be your host ID.\n\n481\n00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.950\nIf you get two devices, right?\n\n482\n00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:21.300\nTwo IP addresses that\nsomebody is asking about.\n\n483\n00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.430\nLike are these two on the same network?\n\n484\n00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:25.460\nJust take an examination like that.\n\n485\n00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:27.398\nIf now you actually compare and\n\n486\n00:27:27.398 --> 00:27:32.060\nit says 172.16.96, well those devices\nare not gonna be on the same network.\n\n487\n00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:35.262\nThey're gonna be treated as if they're\nactually on different networks, which\n\n488\n00:27:35.262 --> 00:27:38.290\nmeans they will not be able to directly\ncommunicate with each other as well.\n\n489\n00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:42.896\nNow if we needed communication\nthough to happen between\n\n490\n00:27:42.896 --> 00:27:48.880\nthe 172.16.95 network and\nthe 172.16.96 network.\n\n491\n00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:54.551\nWell what we also need to have on every\ndevice in our network is gonna be what\n\n492\n00:27:54.551 --> 00:28:01.450\nis called a default gateway, or you might\nhear the term router IP address as well.\n\n493\n00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:05.610\nAnd so this is actually\nthe IP address that tells us\n\n494\n00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:08.990\nhow we get outside of our own network.\n\n495\n00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:11.900\nAnd this is important, it is like\nthe doorway outside of your house,\n\n496\n00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:15.270\noutside of your room, it doesn't mean\nthat you know what the IP address\n\n497\n00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:16.990\nis that you're going to connect to.\n\n498\n00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:19.310\nBut if can actually take\na look at the source and\n\n499\n00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:23.030\ndestination address of any\npacket that we send, and it\n\n500\n00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:26.990\nsays it's on a different network well the\nfirst place that your computer says for\n\n501\n00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:31.560\nme to get it there I'm gonna send\nit to this address right here.\n\n502\n00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:35.166\nIf your computer does not have a default\n\n503\n00:28:35.166 --> 00:28:39.984\ngateway on the same network,\nso notice there it is.\n\n504\n00:28:39.984 --> 00:28:44.996\n172.16.95, 172.16.95,\nif this says 97, 99, something else,\n\n505\n00:28:44.996 --> 00:28:50.021\nI won't be able to communicate with any\nother device outside of this 172.16.95.\n\n506\n00:28:50.021 --> 00:28:54.667\nSo if we are gonna communicate with\ndevices inside of our own network,\n\n507\n00:28:54.667 --> 00:28:57.960\nthey have to have that same network ID.\n\n508\n00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.920\nIf we're gonna be communicating with\ndevices between different networks,\n\n509\n00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:06.880\nwe need a default gateway\nto help us to do that.\n\n510\n00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.550\nAnd the way that we\ndistinguish whether a remote or\n\n511\n00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:14.240\nwhether actually on the same network is\ngoing to be using this subnet mask to\n\n512\n00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:18.720\nhelp us out to identify\nthat same process as well.\n\n513\n00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:23.590\nSo there is a lot of information that\nwe do have to kind of glean in a fairly\n\n514\n00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:26.310\nquick moment of time that we\nhave that we're together.\n\n515\n00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:28.930\nBut this is not the last\ntime you're gonna see this.\n\n516\n00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:31.040\nYou're gonna work with this\nthroughout your networking career.\n\n517\n00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.580\n>> Oh, yeah, yeah,\nget prepared to become very familiar\n\n518\n00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:39.600\nwith the IPv4 addressing scheme, subnet\nmask, gateways, things of that nature.\n\n519\n00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.120\nLike Ronnie said,\n\n520\n00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:43.570\nnot the last time you're gonna go\ndown this rodeo, that is for sure.\n\n521\n00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:46.150\nAll of this will eventually start\nmaking a whole lot more sense.\n\n522\n00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:50.740\nWe understand that it can be a bit\ndaunting at first when you first see this.\n\n523\n00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:54.360\nBut as you continue to look at it and\nyou start to see, okay,\n\n524\n00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.390\nI look at my IP address, and\n\n525\n00:29:56.390 --> 00:30:00.090\nthen you can use some tools to figure\nout what is Google's IP address, right.\n\n526\n00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:01.700\nTake a look at those and\nthey're different.\n\n527\n00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.450\nThey're not even close to the same.\n\n528\n00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:04.470\nSubnet mask different.\n\n529\n00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:06.180\nEverything's different about them.\n\n530\n00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:09.030\nSo how do we get from one\nnetwork to the other and\n\n531\n00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:10.770\nit's all through this addressing scheme.\n\n532\n00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:13.130\nThings like the gateway and\nthe subnet mask help us out.\n\n533\n00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:16.960\nSo that we can differentiate between\nnetworks as well as host and\n\n534\n00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.000\nthat is what it's all about ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n535\n00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.590\nHopefully it's making some sense to you.\n\n536\n00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:23.770\nBut Ronnie we've got more to\ntalk about and little time.\n\n537\n00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:25.730\n>> We really do and so\nthat means we are ready for\n\n538\n00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:30.200\nthen of course part two which means we\ndo have a little bit more to cover.\n\n539\n00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.400\nSo when we start taking a look into part\ntwo, we're gonna see some other things\n\n540\n00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:36.620\nthat there are special addresses that\nwe need to pay attention to as well.\n\n541\n00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:40.182\nAnd not only just about getting\nthe IP addresses on the machines,\n\n542\n00:30:40.182 --> 00:30:43.620\nwhich we still need to talk about,\nbut there is a lot more.\n\n543\n00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:47.110\nAnd even in later episodes, we're going\nto see that newer version as well.\n\n544\n00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.880\n>> That's right.\n\n545\n00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.660\nSo stick with us networking gurus.\n\n546\n00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:51.200\nThanks for watching this episode.\n\n547\n00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.100\nHopefully we'll see you in part two.\n\n548\n00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:56.440\nSigning off for ITProTv,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n549\n00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.484\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n550\n00:30:57.484 --> 00:30:58.079\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n551\n00:30:58.079 --> 00:31:04.470\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.300\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.100\nHere with me is none other than Mr.\nRonnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.930\nHow's it going today, Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.040\n>> It is going great today.\n\n7\n00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.867\nWe are taking a look at the MTA,\nthe Microsoft Technology Associate.\n\n8\n00:00:25.867 --> 00:00:31.229\nAnd we're taking a look, specifically,\nat networking fundamentals, exam 98-366.\n\n9\n00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:33.908\nTrying to make sure that we\nput the fun back into, well,\n\n10\n00:00:33.908 --> 00:00:37.210\nnetworking fun-damentals is\nwhat we're trying to do here.\n\n11\n00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.001\nAnd we are specifically looking at some\nof the other details in IP version 4\n\n12\n00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:44.267\naddressing, making sure we have\na solid understanding there.\n\n13\n00:00:44.267 --> 00:00:47.833\nIn the previous episode that we have,\nin the Part 1, we went and\n\n14\n00:00:47.833 --> 00:00:52.059\ntook a look at the structure of the IP\naddressing, where they came from, and\n\n15\n00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.044\nalso the representation of the addresses,\nclass A class B and class C.\n\n16\n00:00:56.044 --> 00:00:58.525\nAnd just tried to make sure we\nunderstand that that's where those\n\n17\n00:00:58.525 --> 00:00:59.878\naddresses come from.\n\n18\n00:00:59.878 --> 00:01:03.250\nWe also tried to allow us to\nmake sure that, or tried to show\n\n19\n00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.510\nthat we could differentiate between\nwhether devices are on the same network or\n\n20\n00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.370\nwhether they are on a different network,\nand also the idea of the defaunt gateway.\n\n21\n00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.030\nToday we've got a little more to\ncover in IP version 4 addressing and\n\n22\n00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.990\nthat should give us a solid foundation.\n\n23\n00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.620\nBut by no means think\nthat this is the end.\n\n24\n00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.442\nYou will see IP version 4 addressing for\n\n25\n00:01:20.442 --> 00:01:22.990\nthe rest of your networking\ncareer right now.\n\n26\n00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.260\nAnd even after, for a long time, in which\nthe IP version 4 addressing, even though\n\n27\n00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.790\nit's making its roads towards the end of\nits life, you're probably gonna see it's\n\n28\n00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.000\nstill gonna hang on for years and years\nafterwards, at least in some segments.\n\n29\n00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.130\nSo the good thing is you'll\nhave a solid foundation here,\n\n30\n00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.020\nyou'll still be working\nwith in the future.\n\n31\n00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.840\nBut then you actually end up learning a\nnew protocol as well in the future too, so\n\n32\n00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.360\nwe just need to cover up\na few of our final details.\n\n33\n00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.330\n>> That's right, this is by no\nmeans as exhaustive as it could be.\n\n34\n00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.125\nObviously, we'd be on show, like 953.\n\n35\n00:01:53.125 --> 00:01:56.715\nBecause it is quite a lengthy topic,\nbut the basics of it,\n\n36\n00:01:56.715 --> 00:01:57.915\nthat's all you need to know.\n\n37\n00:01:57.915 --> 00:01:59.555\nAnd that's what we're trying\nto get through today.\n\n38\n00:01:59.555 --> 00:02:02.715\nRonnie, we've covered quite a few\nthings now, but we need to move on.\n\n39\n00:02:02.715 --> 00:02:03.775\nWe need to keep going.\n\n40\n00:02:03.775 --> 00:02:07.935\nWe have some reserved IP addresses\nthat you might run into, right?\n\n41\n00:02:07.935 --> 00:02:10.775\n>> There's no doubt that there\nare certain addresses that we've already\n\n42\n00:02:10.775 --> 00:02:11.625\ntalked about, right?\n\n43\n00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:12.985\nThere are public IP addresses,\n\n44\n00:02:12.985 --> 00:02:16.810\nthose that are available on the Internet,\nthat fall into that class A, class B, and\n\n45\n00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.690\nclass C range of addresses, and\nwhich we've taken a look at.\n\n46\n00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.760\nAnd if you're not familiar with that, make\nsure you check out Part 1 of this series.\n\n47\n00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.070\nBut go back and see that, but we also have\ndifferent addresses that are out there,\n\n48\n00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.710\nwhich we use but not out on the Internet.\n\n49\n00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.860\nAnd those are what we call\nthe reserved addresses.\n\n50\n00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.600\nOr a lot of times you hear about\nthe term private IP addresses instead.\n\n51\n00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.500\nThe Microsoft exam really calls\nthem reserved addresses, but\n\n52\n00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.640\nwe're gonna actually see that\nthey're also called private ranges.\n\n53\n00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.210\nSo on my screen, I went ahead and typed\nin these list of addresses to try and\n\n54\n00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.750\nhelp us out to make sure,\nyou don't have to watch me type,\n\n55\n00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.220\nis probably the main reason\nthat you don't wanna do this.\n\n56\n00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.810\nSo what's starting to happen here and\nwhy do we need these addresses?\n\n57\n00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.380\nWell at some point,\nwhen they started running out of IP\n\n58\n00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.740\naddresses out on the Internet, I know this\nsounds, it really is counterintuitive.\n\n59\n00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.560\nWhat they did is they decided, look, what\nwe're gonna do is we're gonna take some of\n\n60\n00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.050\nthose public IP addresses and make them\nwhere they're useless on the Internet.\n\n61\n00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.400\nSo they robbed addresses that were already\ndepleting so that they could make sure\n\n62\n00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.450\nthat they had addresses in the future,\nwhich doesn't make a lot of sense.\n\n63\n00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.180\nBut that's exactly what they did.\n\n64\n00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.660\nAnd the reason why they did that is that\nthey knew that they were gonna end up\n\n65\n00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.680\nbreaking the rules at some point,\nbut before they did, they said this.\n\n66\n00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.010\nThe way that this is going to happen is\nwe are now going to say that when you\n\n67\n00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.980\nare actually on your own network, you're\ngonna use one of these three ranges of\n\n68\n00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.560\naddresses internally,\nis what you're gonna do.\n\n69\n00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.360\nSo behind your router, and your router\nactually has two interfaces on it.\n\n70\n00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.410\nOne, of course, that faces your network,\nanother one that faces the Internet or\n\n71\n00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.690\nsome other network here.\n\n72\n00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.620\nBut on your interface facing\ninternally on your network,\n\n73\n00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.620\nyou're gonna use one of these\nthree ranges of addresses.\n\n74\n00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.240\nAnd you can use them however you want to.\n\n75\n00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.670\nThe way that it used to be was simple.\n\n76\n00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.980\nIf you ended up getting\nassigned a class A address,\n\n77\n00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.710\nyou would use the class A private IP\naddress internally on your network.\n\n78\n00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.250\nIf you were assigned to class C,\n\n79\n00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.580\nyou'd use a class C range of addresses\ninside your network as well.\n\n80\n00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.540\nSame thing then with class B.\n\n81\n00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.230\nBut these are addresses that\nare not valid on the Internet.\n\n82\n00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.010\nThey're valid only inside, and they're\nnot actually allowed on the Internet.\n\n83\n00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.330\nIf your ISP were to allow them on the\nInternet, they would actually be in pretty\n\n84\n00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.520\ngood amount of trouble if they were\nactually not to filter those things out.\n\n85\n00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.324\nSo you do tend to find a lot of\nthese types of addresses internally.\n\n86\n00:04:30.324 --> 00:04:33.200\nSo class A is the entire 10 network.\n\n87\n00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.421\nClass B actually splits a range here,\n172.16 through the 131 network.\n\n88\n00:04:38.421 --> 00:04:44.130\nAnd then class C, 192.168, all the way\nthrough that entire network range as well.\n\n89\n00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.784\nSo this give us the chance then,\nto do what?\n\n90\n00:04:46.784 --> 00:04:50.407\nWell, if we are connecting to\nthe Internet, the majority of times,\n\n91\n00:04:50.407 --> 00:04:53.781\nwith the new technology that they\nimplemented along with this,\n\n92\n00:04:53.781 --> 00:04:56.420\nthat we call NAT,\nnetwork address translation.\n\n93\n00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.860\nAnd we'll get into that\na little bit more in detail.\n\n94\n00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.850\nBut it allows us to have\na single public IP address so\n\n95\n00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.160\nthat we're not running\nout of addresses anymore.\n\n96\n00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.180\nAnd then everybody on my network can\nactually connect out through that single\n\n97\n00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.430\naddress instead.\n\n98\n00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.210\nAnd so that's what these private\naddresses allow us to do.\n\n99\n00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.510\nWe can take as many addresses as we want,\njust about 65,000 addresses, and\n\n100\n00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.570\nactually connect it\nthrough one IP address.\n\n101\n00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:19.578\nNow nobody should do that.\n\n102\n00:05:19.578 --> 00:05:23.700\nNobody should say, I'm gonna challenge\nit and put 65,000 machines and try and\n\n103\n00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.170\nactually use the network\naddress translation to do that.\n\n104\n00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.430\nIn theory, it can handle it.\n\n105\n00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.100\nAnd that actually depends, of course,\non the device itself, whether or\n\n106\n00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.280\nnot it can do that.\n\n107\n00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.480\nBut you do have that capability.\n\n108\n00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.090\nNow there's a couple of other\naddresses that you will\n\n109\n00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.530\nalso not use on the Internet either.\n\n110\n00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.740\nWhich is what we call the loopback\naddress range, as well.\n\n111\n00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.990\nAnything inside of that 127 network\nis also not available to be\n\n112\n00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:52.090\nassigned to an individual device, router,\nPC, server on the Internet as well.\n\n113\n00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.010\nAnd this is actually designed for\nloopback testing.\n\n114\n00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.140\nIt represents your own device when\nyou're trying to communicate, so\n\n115\n00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.410\nthat you can do testing as well.\n\n116\n00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.400\nNow the other one that we have here,\nit does work, it's what we call an APIPA\n\n117\n00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.860\naddress, an Automatic Private IP Address,\nis also a self-assigned address.\n\n118\n00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.500\nMost of the computers that\nyou get access to today,\n\n119\n00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.900\nthey know that they're gonna be\non some network of some kind.\n\n120\n00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.700\nSo they know that if that's true,\nthey're gonna need an IP address.\n\n121\n00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.680\nAnd what they've done is if they don't\nget an IP address from either me\n\n122\n00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.395\nconfiguring it to get an IP address or\ntwo,\n\n123\n00:06:27.395 --> 00:06:31.630\nget talking to another device that can\nassign an IP address, your computer\n\n124\n00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:35.445\ngenerally says, look I'll assign\nmyself an address and I'll use this.\n\n125\n00:06:35.445 --> 00:06:39.220\nWell, this address range and\neverybody that supports APIPA\n\n126\n00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.953\nwould normally be in this entire range\nright here, which begins with the 169.254.\n\n127\n00:06:43.953 --> 00:06:47.180\nNow technically, today,\nwe really only use it for troubleshooting,\n\n128\n00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.510\nwe don't use it for\nany type of connection at all.\n\n129\n00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.756\nBut you can still see that\nthis is available for us too.\n\n130\n00:06:52.756 --> 00:06:58.110\nSo, not only do we have\npublic IP address ranges\n\n131\n00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.580\nthat really did exist in the early days\nof networking on the Internet, but\n\n132\n00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.850\nwe also have these private ones\nthat exist at the same time.\n\n133\n00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:09.564\nAnd we still kind of use a conglomeration\nof both in terms of trying to make sure\n\n134\n00:07:09.564 --> 00:07:12.189\nthat we have enough addresses available.\n\n135\n00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:15.590\nBut that classful address that we're\ntalking about has pretty much gone away.\n\n136\n00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:16.620\nClass A, class B and\n\n137\n00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:21.390\nclass Cs really did kind of go away when\nwe started using these types of addresses\n\n138\n00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.945\ninternally, along with some of those\ntechnologies that we were just describing.\n\n139\n00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:28.110\n>> Yeah, Ronnie, I always found it\ninteresting that they say they're\n\n140\n00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.240\ngonna grab IP addresses out of the valid\nIP address range for the public IPs and\n\n141\n00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:32.960\nmake them private.\n\n142\n00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.260\nAnd they say this is gonna\ngive us more addresses.\n\n143\n00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:37.080\nYou're like, how the heck?\n\n144\n00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.060\nIt seems counterintuitive.\n\n145\n00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.820\nIt's really not, even though it seems\nthat way, because what are they doing?\n\n146\n00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:46.780\nThey're saying, I'm gonna have these\naddresses and I can reuse them over and\n\n147\n00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.251\nover and\nover again inside of a private setting.\n\n148\n00:07:49.251 --> 00:07:52.507\nThat way, I can use 192.168.1.15 and\n\n149\n00:07:52.507 --> 00:07:58.043\nRonnie can use 192.168.1.15,\nas long as we're not on the same network.\n\n150\n00:07:58.043 --> 00:08:01.425\nAs long as his network is private to him,\nmy network is private to me, and\n\n151\n00:08:01.425 --> 00:08:03.543\nnow we get to reuse those over and\nover again.\n\n152\n00:08:03.543 --> 00:08:07.370\nAnd it really did save IPv4 for\nquite some time.\n\n153\n00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:09.300\nIt's still around today because of that.\n\n154\n00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.210\n>> It really is.\n\n155\n00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:14.940\nSo by being able to actually know that we\nwere going to run out of those addresses,\n\n156\n00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:18.730\nand we started using that network address\ntranslation to do what we talked about,\n\n157\n00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:22.930\nusing the private IP addresses the way\nthat Daniel also described, and\n\n158\n00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.380\nthen using something else the third\ntechnology that's involved in this mix of\n\n159\n00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:31.480\nsaving IP addresses is something that\nwe call variable links subnet masking.\n\n160\n00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.120\nNow when we start talking about that,\nwhat are we talking about?\n\n161\n00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:38.590\nWell, in the way that we did the class IP\naddressing before, let me scroll back up\n\n162\n00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:42.290\nhere so that we can see this, and the the\nway we actually talked about it before\n\n163\n00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:46.380\neach one of these different\nclasses has a default subnet mass.\n\n164\n00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.180\nAnd that idea, the default subnet mask,\n\n165\n00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:52.300\nmeans that hey, every single\nnetwork is gonna get these numbers\n\n166\n00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.620\nas far as the number of computers\nthat we can have per network.\n\n167\n00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.240\nWell, the problem is if I assign a single\nnetwork to Daniel that is the class A,\n\n168\n00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.930\nwell that means he has a single\nnetwork that can actually\n\n169\n00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:05.760\nhave 14 million plus computers.\n\n170\n00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.560\nWell, what if he only has\ntwo million computers?\n\n171\n00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.550\nWell, that's the problem.\n\n172\n00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:12.020\nWe waste a lot of addresses,\ncuz he can't go out and\n\n173\n00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.250\nsublease the rest of that network.\n\n174\n00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:14.878\nAnd same thing down here.\n\n175\n00:09:14.878 --> 00:09:19.033\nWhat if Daniel only has 10,000 computers,\nand not 65,000.\n\n176\n00:09:19.033 --> 00:09:22.220\nHe's going to waste those\nother 55,000 addresses.\n\n177\n00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:22.830\nAnd even down here.\n\n178\n00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:28.540\nIf I only had 75 computers, I would still\nwaste a lot of addresses to do that.\n\n179\n00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:32.970\nSo that's when they came up with this\nidea that we can reuse certain addresses\n\n180\n00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:36.300\nprivately so that way we can have the same\nthing that Dan was talking about.\n\n181\n00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.850\nBut then on the Internet we're no\nlonger gonna follow these rules.\n\n182\n00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:43.460\nThey are not gonna be the classful\nIP addressing that we see.\n\n183\n00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:47.210\nInstead we're gonna break\nthe rules on the subnet mask and\n\n184\n00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:51.060\nwhat we're gonna end up doing is what\nwe call variable link subnet masking.\n\n185\n00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:54.980\nAnd this is when we take what\nis normally given to us.\n\n186\n00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:59.490\nSo here's an example of a class C\naddress with a class C subnet mask.\n\n187\n00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:03.940\nAnd what we can do is we can subdivide\nthat network into four equal parts.\n\n188\n00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:08.650\nSo if I were to say into four equal parts\nhere, what I'm saying is I can chop up\n\n189\n00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:14.030\nthat single network that\nbegins with 192.168.0 network\n\n190\n00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:20.230\nthat has 254 hosts I can divide that into,\nwell, four equal parts if I need to.\n\n191\n00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:24.970\nAnd then, what can now happen, instead of\nDaniel getting a whole class C address,\n\n192\n00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.830\nI can now give him, well, one fourth of\nthat class C address, then I can have\n\n193\n00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:32.770\nanother fourth of it, and somebody else\ncan have another fourth of it as well.\n\n194\n00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:35.640\nWhen we end up doing\nsomething like that instead,\n\n195\n00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:42.420\nwhat we get is now it's going to be\na new network with a new subnet mask.\n\n196\n00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:47.120\nThat will end up happening here and that\nwill now become a new subnet mask like\n\n197\n00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:51.780\nthis and then the next network will also\nbe just a little bit different from here.\n\n198\n00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:58.280\nNow we are not actually getting into\nthe techniques of subnetting, but\n\n199\n00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:02.960\nyou can actually end up seeing, if I can\nactually copy and paste this a little bit.\n\n200\n00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:14.309\nOops, let me see if, my keyboard\nkung-fu is not strong today at all.\n\n201\n00:11:14.309 --> 00:11:20.728\nSo now, my new networks would\nactually be 64, and then 128.\n\n202\n00:11:23.774 --> 00:11:25.076\nAnd then 192.\n\n203\n00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:31.570\nSo those will actually now be\nmy new subdivided one network.\n\n204\n00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:34.780\nSo I might have began with\none network here, but\n\n205\n00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:40.060\nnotice by changing the subnet mask\nthat makes for smaller networks.\n\n206\n00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:42.488\nThen, I can divide them\ninto four equal parts.\n\n207\n00:11:42.488 --> 00:11:45.501\nSo now, each network actually supports,\n\n208\n00:11:45.501 --> 00:11:49.862\nlet's say, 62 different actual\nconnections or devices.\n\n209\n00:11:49.862 --> 00:11:51.990\nHosts, I couldn't remember what\nI was trying to say there.\n\n210\n00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:54.500\nAnd we can actually have\nsomething like this.\n\n211\n00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.010\nAnd this is what happens on the Internet,\n\n212\n00:11:56.010 --> 00:12:00.640\nto actually help save more addresses,\nthis is what ends up.\n\n213\n00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.040\nSo Daniel,\nI might assign the 0.64 network.\n\n214\n00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.390\nMyself, I might do the 1.28 here.\n\n215\n00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:08.050\nTitus, I'm going to give the 192, and\n\n216\n00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:11.250\neven the zero,\nmight also assign that to somebody else.\n\n217\n00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:14.270\nAnd so now if I was an ISP and\nI had one single block.\n\n218\n00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:17.700\nI could end up with four separate\ncustomers that really with more customized\n\n219\n00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:21.880\nto what their needs were, and so\nsubnetting is a very important concept.\n\n220\n00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.090\nBut we're not trying to do it here.\n\n221\n00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:28.120\nIf you want to learn more about that,\nmake sure you do check out the network\n\n222\n00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.560\nplus show that we have,\nthe CompTIA network plus show, and\n\n223\n00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.850\nthat will actually get you\nmore involved in subnetting.\n\n224\n00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:35.730\nThen you probably ever thought that you\nwould wanna be, and I guarantee you,\n\n225\n00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:37.280\nthere's a lot that we cover in there.\n\n226\n00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:41.900\n>> Oh man, I remember my first foray\ninto the subnetting field, and\n\n227\n00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:44.625\nit was, oh my goodness,\nthis will drive a man to drink.\n\n228\n00:12:44.625 --> 00:12:46.350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz it's a lot of math,\n\n229\n00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:49.930\nit's a lot of trying to figure\nout how many networks do I need?\n\n230\n00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:52.500\n>> Yep.\n>> How many hosts on each networks is that\n\n231\n00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.490\ngonna be?\n\n232\n00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:58.470\nAnd getting the right mixture of\nnetworks to host for each one.\n\n233\n00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:02.130\nSubnetting's a very, very involved idea.\n\n234\n00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:03.880\nRight?\nIt's not an easy thing.\n\n235\n00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.270\nYou don't need to know that for the MTA.\n\n236\n00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:06.630\nThat's fantastic.\n\n237\n00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:09.110\nAll you need to know is that what it does.\n\n238\n00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:10.240\nWhy we use it?\n\n239\n00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.220\nWhy it's around?\n\n240\n00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.570\nHow we implement it.\n\n241\n00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:16.950\nBut not the specifics of knowing\nthat if I have this subnet mask,\n\n242\n00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:19.440\nI'll have this many networks and\nhosts in that network.\n\n243\n00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.220\nDon't have to get that involved,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n244\n00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:21.720\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n245\n00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.030\nIf you would just think about it as being\n\n246\n00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:25.700\na division, right?\nSo just like you know how to do division\n\n247\n00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:29.580\nof a number, well the problem is that you\nand I would have to do this in binary.\n\n248\n00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.170\nWell, that's the problem is you and\nI don't know how to do division in binary.\n\n249\n00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:33.630\nThe way that we do it for\n\n250\n00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.740\nbinary networking as we call it\nsubnetting is what we call it.\n\n251\n00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:38.070\nSo if you can take that number.\n\n252\n00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:39.060\nThat binary number and\n\n253\n00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:42.690\ndivide it in to four equal parts,\nyou can do the same thing.\n\n254\n00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:45.010\nBut the way that we do it in\nnetworking is right here.\n\n255\n00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:48.970\nWhere we do change that subnet mask\nwhich identifies what that network\n\n256\n00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:50.780\nportion is going to be.\n\n257\n00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:54.560\nAnd that's how you actually are able\nto be doing something like that/\n\n258\n00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.500\nIf you will choose to do it.\n\n259\n00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.530\nSo you will learn more about it as you\nget on into your networking career.\n\n260\n00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:03.220\nAt least at this point understand it's\nabout taking one big network block.\n\n261\n00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.370\nAnd then changing it into\nsmaller network blocks.\n\n262\n00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:07.060\nThat's probably the easiest\nway to think about it.\n\n263\n00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:09.170\n>> Yeah perfect explanation Ronnie.\n\n264\n00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:11.545\nI couldn't have said it better myself.\n\n265\n00:14:11.545 --> 00:14:12.240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right\n\n266\n00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.680\nRonnie what else do we need to talk about?\n\n267\n00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.619\nI guess there's the different\nversions of IP that are out there.\n\n268\n00:14:17.619 --> 00:14:20.990\nAs you said, IPv4,\nkind of out of addresses, now.\n\n269\n00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:24.800\nSo, IPv6 has come out.\n\n270\n00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:25.810\nTell us about that a little bit.\n\n271\n00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:27.960\n>> Yeah, the problem that we're\nhaving here is simple, right?\n\n272\n00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.900\nBecause we don't have any more addresses,\nIPv6, which is\n\n273\n00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:35.170\nthe next generation of the IP addressing,\nwell we're switching over to that.\n\n274\n00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:37.140\nNow it's probably not\ngonna be overnight so\n\n275\n00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.500\nyou're not gonna worry about it too much\nbut you will begin to learn about it.\n\n276\n00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.050\nAnd actually you'll begin to learn about\nit in another episode here in this\n\n277\n00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:43.630\nseries too.\n\n278\n00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:47.890\nWhere you'll at least take a look at\nthe foundations and the formatting of it.\n\n279\n00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:50.820\nBut the problem that we have is\nas we switch on over, right?\n\n280\n00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:54.070\nThere's a bunch of technology that\nwe have to get ready to do so and\n\n281\n00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:57.860\nthe good thing is most of our computers\nare already doing it, and the way they\n\n282\n00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.800\nthey're doing it is by implementing\nwhat we call Transitional Technologies.\n\n283\n00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:05.310\nSo, how do we actually\nmove from my IPv4 to IPv6?\n\n284\n00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:08.380\nWell there's several different techniques\nthat are out there, and I hate to say it.\n\n285\n00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:10.001\nAll of them are pretty much trash.\n\n286\n00:15:10.001 --> 00:15:10.903\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They really are.\n\n287\n00:15:10.903 --> 00:15:11.610\nThey're garbage.\n\n288\n00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:13.053\nThey don't tend to work that well.\n\n289\n00:15:13.053 --> 00:15:13.773\n>> Well don't sugarcoat it Ronnie.\n\n290\n00:15:13.773 --> 00:15:15.762\n[CROSSTALK] Tell us how you really feel.\n\n291\n00:15:15.762 --> 00:15:17.420\n>> Well I mean, you think about it.\n\n292\n00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.670\nIt really is kind of backward here, right?\n\n293\n00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:23.550\nThe very fact that I'm moving to newer\ntechnology is easier to implement on\n\n294\n00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:27.687\nthe land inside of my own network than it\nis across the entirety of the internet.\n\n295\n00:15:27.687 --> 00:15:30.355\nSo there may be pockets of\npeople out on the internet,\n\n296\n00:15:30.355 --> 00:15:32.502\nthe ISPs that say no we're going to IPv6.\n\n297\n00:15:32.502 --> 00:15:36.769\nBut then there's other ones that sit there\nan go maybe we'll switch on over, but\n\n298\n00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:38.538\nwe're not gonna switch on over.\n\n299\n00:15:38.538 --> 00:15:41.754\nSo what happens is you get\nsmaller islands of, you know,\n\n300\n00:15:41.754 --> 00:15:44.571\ndifferent areas which\nare actually using IPv6.\n\n301\n00:15:44.571 --> 00:15:47.050\nAnd then different areas\nwhich are using IPv4.\n\n302\n00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:47.627\nSo what does that mean?\n\n303\n00:15:47.627 --> 00:15:51.959\nThat means we have to actually have\nsome transition that if you are actually\n\n304\n00:15:51.959 --> 00:15:55.604\ncrossing from IPv6 to IPv4 you\nmight have to actually use some\n\n305\n00:15:55.604 --> 00:15:59.543\ntechnology that either masks it or\nactually translates it into it.\n\n306\n00:15:59.543 --> 00:16:00.544\nYou know, no matter what.\n\n307\n00:16:00.544 --> 00:16:02.501\nSo you have a weird thing.\n\n308\n00:16:02.501 --> 00:16:06.966\nSo, let's take for an example,\nwe have internally on a network,\n\n309\n00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:11.400\nIPv6, but my ISP's only running IPv4,\nwell what do I do?\n\n310\n00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:12.280\nI can change it.\n\n311\n00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.510\nThere's transitional technology\nout there that says,\n\n312\n00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:19.640\nwe can kind of convert IPv6 addresses and\nencapsulate it inside of IPv4, and\n\n313\n00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:24.392\nthen when it goes over to an IPv6 address,\nwe'll kind of take it out of the IPv4 box.\n\n314\n00:16:24.392 --> 00:16:26.164\nAnd then put it back on IPv6.\n\n315\n00:16:26.164 --> 00:16:29.970\nWell, that sounds like a lot of overhead,\na lot of, it is.\n\n316\n00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:31.830\nIt's a mess to do that.\n\n317\n00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:34.770\nYou can also of course,,\nuse some different technologies\n\n318\n00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:38.300\nthat help to try and\nmask it across the networks as well.\n\n319\n00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.980\nAll of them are pretty\nmuch not designed or\n\n320\n00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:45.330\nnot really designed for primetime and\nnot even across the Internet.\n\n321\n00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:47.070\nA lot of times if you're\nactually doing that.\n\n322\n00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:50.080\nSo there's different ones depending on\nwhether you're running network address\n\n323\n00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.220\ntranslation on your network or\nwhether you're not.\n\n324\n00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.650\nSo you name it.\n\n325\n00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:56.130\nThere's so many of them,\nit's hard to choose.\n\n326\n00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:59.170\nThe one that is the most stable is\nthe one It's actually running on this\n\n327\n00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:00.230\nmachine right here.\n\n328\n00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:02.310\nAnd let me show you\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n329\n00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:06.710\nSo on this machine, if I bring up\nthat command prompt again, and\n\n330\n00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:11.070\nI do an IP config, and\nthen I'm gonna use an option called /all.\n\n331\n00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:14.680\nLet me scroll down here to\nthis ethernet adaptor, and\n\n332\n00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:18.100\nyou will see something a little\nbit more unusual here.\n\n333\n00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:22.680\nThis machine is already running IPv6,\nas well as IPv4.\n\n334\n00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:27.460\nAnd you can see both of these\naddresses are the ones that,\n\n335\n00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.730\nnotice they're both marked\nas being preferred.\n\n336\n00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:34.650\nSo IPv6 and IPv4 are actually\nrunning right now, simultaneously.\n\n337\n00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:37.980\nAnd that is what is called\na dual stack configuration.\n\n338\n00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.550\nNow you can see it not only right there.\n\n339\n00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:45.510\nBut if I were to get into the control\npanel, so Start, Control Panel.\n\n340\n00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:50.590\nAnd then go inside of Network and Internet\nand then the Network and Sharing Center.\n\n341\n00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.400\nOver on the left-hand side,\nChange adapter settings.\n\n342\n00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:59.820\nAnd then I right-click on Local area\nconnection and go to Properties.\n\n343\n00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:03.350\nNotice that they are both check marked,\nIPv6 and IPv4.\n\n344\n00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:07.570\nThis is the one that says, look,\nlet's run them simultaneously.\n\n345\n00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:10.020\nThey shouldn't interfere with each other,\nso\n\n346\n00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:12.620\nwhat I can do is I can have my\nnetwork up and running on IPv4.\n\n347\n00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:17.830\nAnd then if I wanted to practice IPv6,\nI can go ahead and\n\n348\n00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:21.620\nstart implementing IPv6\naddressing in the background.\n\n349\n00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:25.238\nAnd then, when I believe that\nwe're ready to transition over,\n\n350\n00:18:25.238 --> 00:18:29.057\nI simply uncheck the IPv4 and\nnow I'm running completely IPv6 and\n\n351\n00:18:29.057 --> 00:18:33.144\nhopefully nobody else in my network\nthat cares will actually really know\n\n352\n00:18:33.144 --> 00:18:36.570\nthat its happened and\nwe'll still get networking going on.\n\n353\n00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:40.080\nNow you may think like no way,\nI'm not ever gonna do that, but\n\n354\n00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.980\nmore than likely if you are running\nWindows 8, and actually,\n\n355\n00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:46.380\neven if you're running Windows 7 and all\nthe server products that are out there for\n\n356\n00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:48.470\nwindows, you're probably\nalready doing it and\n\n357\n00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:50.690\nyou don't know about it,\nif you haven't checked.\n\n358\n00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:53.810\nAnd actually, a lot of the network\ncommunications going on in the background,\n\n359\n00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:58.626\neven though we set IPv4 addresses, a lot\nof it's actually being handled over IPv6.\n\n360\n00:18:58.626 --> 00:19:01.000\nIn other words,\nit's already doing that for you.\n\n361\n00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.120\nYou and I just haven't been paying\nattention as they've already switched\n\n362\n00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.350\nthe protocols over, and\n\n363\n00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:09.258\nstarted trying to use that by default\nto make the switch easier for us.\n\n364\n00:19:09.258 --> 00:19:11.980\nSo yeah,\nthere's a lot of technology out there, and\n\n365\n00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.250\nit is coming as something that you and\nI will have to get used to.\n\n366\n00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:17.442\nBut you're gonna see hopefully these\ntransitional technologies will kind of\n\n367\n00:19:17.442 --> 00:19:21.330\nsolidify into one that will work, but\nultimately you're gonna see it's just\n\n368\n00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:25.290\ngonna be one day where somebody's\ngonna say hey are we on IPv6 yet?\n\n369\n00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:28.630\nAnd somebody just finally smiles and\ngoes we've been on it for two years.\n\n370\n00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:32.070\nWe just kept the IPv4 addresses\non there just to see, but\n\n371\n00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:33.810\nwe've been turning it off\nall across the network.\n\n372\n00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:35.080\nThat's what's gonna probably happen.\n\n373\n00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:38.680\n>> Yeah I've always said IPv6 is\ncoming right around the corner.\n\n374\n00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.761\nIt's just a very long, sweeping corner.\n\n375\n00:19:41.761 --> 00:19:42.296\n>> You better believe it.\n\n376\n00:19:42.296 --> 00:19:44.510\n>> That's more like an ellipse.\n\n377\n00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:47.290\n>> It's been about ten years in\nthe making, cuz I just remember,\n\n378\n00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:51.680\nevery time when I started, it was like,\nIPv6 is coming, you better start studying!\n\n379\n00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.650\nAnd five years later, it was like,\nIPv6 is coming, you better start studying!\n\n380\n00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:55.982\nAnd I was like, what in the world?\n\n381\n00:19:55.982 --> 00:19:59.120\nAnd then now,\nwhat we mean is IPv6 is coming.\n\n382\n00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.694\nYou'd better start studying.\n\n383\n00:20:00.694 --> 00:20:03.410\n[LAUGH] So, even now,\nwe're still having the same call.\n\n384\n00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:04.730\nBut now, it's actually more urgent.\n\n385\n00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:05.290\nAnd it really is.\n\n386\n00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:06.116\n>> The end is nigh, Ronnie.\n\n387\n00:20:06.116 --> 00:20:06.976\nThe end is nigh.\n\n388\n00:20:06.976 --> 00:20:07.578\n>> The end is nigh.\n\n389\n00:20:07.578 --> 00:20:09.360\n>> Everybody out there, get ready.\n\n390\n00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.850\nIPv6 is coming.\n\n391\n00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:13.630\nBelieve it or not,\nit's actually kind of already here.\n\n392\n00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:16.980\nAnd, since we have exhausted\nall the IPv4 stuff, well,\n\n393\n00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.560\nthat's gonna push it along\na little bit faster.\n\n394\n00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.610\nSo we gotta see that and\nbe ready for it when it comes.\n\n395\n00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:24.360\nAll right, Ronnie, is there anything\nelse that we need to go over before\n\n396\n00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.140\nwe end the show?\n\n397\n00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:29.060\n>> Not with IPv4, but remember that\nwe are really scratching the surface.\n\n398\n00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:33.370\nGet those foundational concepts in your\nmind, about what the addresses look like.\n\n399\n00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:35.042\nAnd where they come from.\n\n400\n00:20:35.042 --> 00:20:38.260\nThat's gonna be key for you if you're\npreparing for the exam, as well.\n\n401\n00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.370\nMake sure you can identify,\nof course the public and\n\n402\n00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:42.600\nthe reserve ranges of addresses.\n\n403\n00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:43.930\nThose are also key.\n\n404\n00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:47.120\nAnd really a key concept for\nus in networking, right?\n\n405\n00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.410\nIs being able to identify whether or\n\n406\n00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:51.825\nnot devices are on the same network versus\nwhether they're on remote networks.\n\n407\n00:20:51.825 --> 00:20:55.130\nAnd if they are on a remote network,\nremember you need a default gateway.\n\n408\n00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.840\nSo that's a good kind of summary of\nsome of the stuff that we covered\n\n409\n00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.960\nin these particular episodes,\nthat we've been taking a look at.\n\n410\n00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.700\nAnd it's something that's foundational for\n\n411\n00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:07.430\neverything that you will actually do in\nnetworking, so make sure you learn them.\n\n412\n00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:10.000\n>> Awesome stuff,\nhopefully you guys enjoyed this episode.\n\n413\n00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.440\nWe go ahead and thank you for watching,\nwe're gonna sign off for ITProTV,\n\n414\n00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.430\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n415\n00:21:15.430 -->

great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.760\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.000\nJoining me today on the show is\nnone other than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.582\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n&gt;&gt; It is going great today.\n\n7\n00:00:20.582 --> 00:00:22.706\nIt's another great day to be\nright here in the studio.\n\n8\n00:00:22.706 --> 00:00:26.830\nToday we're taking a look at the MTA,\nthe Microsoft Technology Associate,\n\n9\n00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.882\nspecifically on the exam for\nnetworking fundamentals.\n\n10\n00:00:29.882 --> 00:00:34.629\nThe exam number is 98366, so\nif you are preparing for that exam,\n\n11\n00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:36.483\nyou are in the right place.\n\n12\n00:00:36.483 --> 00:00:41.478\nAnd what we're focussing specifically on\ntoday is gonna be understanding IPv6 is\n\n13\n00:00:41.478 --> 00:00:43.845\nactually what we're taking a look at.\n\n14\n00:00:43.845 --> 00:00:47.733\nAnd yes, I just saw a look of\nsurprise on Daniel's face as\n\n15\n00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:51.135\nhis eyebrows went about\nthis high above his head.\n\n16\n00:00:51.135 --> 00:00:53.140\nAnd the reason why is that most of us,\n\n17\n00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.949\nhave we been in networking at any point in\ntime, this is where we start going, man.\n\n18\n00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.556\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then all of a sudden,\n\n19\n00:00:59.556 --> 00:01:01.363\nI can't believe we're focusing in on this.\n\n20\n00:01:01.363 --> 00:01:03.442\nBut it is a great topic for us to cover.\n\n21\n00:01:03.442 --> 00:01:05.486\nAnd it's something that we have to know,\nright, Daniel?\n\n22\n00:01:05.486 --> 00:01:09.174\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, unfortunately, those days\nwhere we could just, yeah, IPv6,\n\n23\n00:01:09.174 --> 00:01:10.569\nI'll get to that, right?\n\n24\n00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:13.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's coming, it's not yet live at five.\n\n25\n00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.880\nYeah, guess what, it's live at five.\n\n26\n00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.539\nI know that IPv4 has been a long-held\nlovely thing that we've just embraced so\n\n27\n00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.175\ngratefully but\nits day is coming quickly to an end.\n\n28\n00:01:25.175 --> 00:01:27.103\nSo IPv6, it's on the horizon.\n\n29\n00:01:27.103 --> 00:01:31.872\nWe have to be ready for it and yeah, it is\na little bit scary because of those huge\n\n30\n00:01:31.872 --> 00:01:36.012\nInternet addresses or the IP\naddresses that they give us for IPv6.\n\n31\n00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:39.576\nBut a little bit of walkthrough\nwith our little mentor here.\n\n32\n00:01:39.576 --> 00:01:44.142\nRonnie's gonna clear the path and make it\neasy for us to understand so it's not so\n\n33\n00:01:44.142 --> 00:01:47.377\nscary and we can tackle that\nguy as it comes down the road.\n\n34\n00:01:47.377 --> 00:01:49.944\nSo Ronnie, IPv6, where do we begin?\n\n35\n00:01:49.944 --> 00:01:55.181\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so with IPv6 we start off with\nthe same concept as we do with IPv4.\n\n36\n00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:59.973\nRemember that what happens is that when\nwe have an IPv4 address and another IPv4,\n\n37\n00:01:59.973 --> 00:02:01.763\nwe can send data between them.\n\n38\n00:02:01.763 --> 00:02:04.026\nWell, with IPv6, it's the same way.\n\n39\n00:02:04.026 --> 00:02:07.067\nWe have to make sure that all the devices\nthat are gonna communicate directly,\n\n40\n00:02:07.067 --> 00:02:08.601\nthey're gonna be on the same network.\n\n41\n00:02:08.601 --> 00:02:12.450\nAnd that each device is also going\nto be able to be identified well,\n\n42\n00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.650\nas unique as well inside\nof that network too.\n\n43\n00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.840\nSo, that's where we fundamentally\ndo some of the same things.\n\n44\n00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.420\nPeople normally get a bit\nnervous about this.\n\n45\n00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.068\nAnd it's because when you change the\naddress, it now looks so foreign and so\n\n46\n00:02:25.068 --> 00:02:29.229\ndifferent that now everybody believes that\nthat means everything else has to change,\n\n47\n00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:32.369\nsuch as the other layers of the OSI\nmodel and everything else too.\n\n48\n00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:36.236\nBut because of the OSI model, which we've\ncovered in different episodes, well,\n\n49\n00:02:36.236 --> 00:02:37.958\nit's actually a layered approach.\n\n50\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.918\nThe only thing we're really changing\nis the layer three approach is all\n\n51\n00:02:40.918 --> 00:02:41.569\nwe're doing.\n\n52\n00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.065\nAnd the rest of the model stays the same.\n\n53\n00:02:44.065 --> 00:02:46.526\nSo that's really what\nwe're focusing in on.\n\n54\n00:02:46.526 --> 00:02:48.473\nAnd when we start taking a look at that,\n\n55\n00:02:48.473 --> 00:02:51.895\nit will allow you to relax a little\nbit more once you go, all right, so\n\n56\n00:02:51.895 --> 00:02:55.880\nI don't have to worry about anything\nexcept that this is gonna look different.\n\n57\n00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.020\nReally that's it.\n\n58\n00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.860\nIt's going to look different and it is\nactually throwing a lot of us that have\n\n59\n00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.280\nbeen in networking a while because it\nlooks so fundamentally different to us.\n\n60\n00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.230\nAnd we've gotten so used to, over the past\n20 to 30 years, of IPv4 addresses.\n\n61\n00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.670\nYou can imagine it really is.\n\n62\n00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.620\nIt's like now this is your favorite\nthing because you work with it and\n\n63\n00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.700\nthere's a technical skill\nthat you understand.\n\n64\n00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.290\nAnd now you're saying, well,\nRonnie, you have to change that.\n\n65\n00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.050\nYou have to kinda put that in the\nbackground cuz new stuff is coming along\n\n66\n00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.820\nand now it becomes just a little bit more\nchallenging because you have to learn\n\n67\n00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:26.570\nsomething new.\n\n68\n00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.160\nBut the good thing is it\nstill works the same way.\n\n69\n00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.630\nNow, it does even add in some improvement,\nthat's where it begins.\n\n70\n00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.590\nSo you might be wondering, all right, so\nwhen are we actually going to use this?\n\n71\n00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.840\nWell, when we start talking about IPv6,\na lot of times you are already using it\n\n72\n00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.630\nin the background on your computer,\nwhether or not you know it.\n\n73\n00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.270\nAnd so\nwhen you actually see something like this,\n\n74\n00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.140\nlet me show you what I'm talking\nabout on my computer here.\n\n75\n00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.560\nSo here it is, I've got a Windows\n8 computer, and I even have as we\n\n76\n00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.390\ntake a look, if I take a look\nat my IP address and maybe.\n\n77\n00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.748\nSee if I can actually\nclick on something here.\n\n78\n00:04:01.748 --> 00:04:02.364\nThere we go.\n\n79\n00:04:02.364 --> 00:04:04.551\nJust took me a moment to get access in.\n\n80\n00:04:04.551 --> 00:04:08.777\nSo if I do this, let's make that a little\nbit larger so that we can see it.\n\n81\n00:04:08.777 --> 00:04:13.595\nI'm gonna run a command called\nIP config just, that's ugly.\n\n82\n00:04:13.595 --> 00:04:15.372\nLet me change that up here.\n\n83\n00:04:15.372 --> 00:04:17.972\nSee, I've got so\nmany different things going on.\n\n84\n00:04:17.972 --> 00:04:20.945\nSo I'm gonna change that so that we can\nsee it a little bit better, there we go.\n\n85\n00:04:20.945 --> 00:04:23.221\nI'm gonna do ipconfig/all, and\n\n86\n00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:28.410\nthat gives me all of the information that\nI need to find out about my IP address.\n\n87\n00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.159\nSo I can see that right\nnow I am running IPv4.\n\n88\n00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:35.225\nWell, when I see that, that's fine.\n\n89\n00:04:35.225 --> 00:04:38.440\nThat's the IPv4 address and\nthat's what we're expecting to see.\n\n90\n00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.980\nAnd most of us don't think anything\nabout it because at the same time,\n\n91\n00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.390\nwhat we're actually seeing is there's two\naddresses that are actually being used\n\n92\n00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.410\nwhen we're working on a Windows network.\n\n93\n00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.288\nAnd even though IPv4 is\nthe preferred one for you and\n\n94\n00:04:51.288 --> 00:04:55.347\nme because we're used to looking at it,\ntoday the networks themselves,\n\n95\n00:04:55.347 --> 00:04:58.489\nthe machines themselves,\nif the network can handle it,\n\n96\n00:04:58.489 --> 00:05:02.364\nthey're actually preferring to use\nthis address in the background.\n\n97\n00:05:02.364 --> 00:05:04.951\nSo even though they're\nnot telling us about it,\n\n98\n00:05:04.951 --> 00:05:08.877\nthey're really using a lot of the IPv6\nstuff in the background already.\n\n99\n00:05:08.877 --> 00:05:12.163\nAnd so they're transitioning over,\nand even if we don't recognize it,\n\n100\n00:05:12.163 --> 00:05:13.440\nthey're already doing it.\n\n101\n00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.890\nSo you're probably already\nusing it in the background for\n\n102\n00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.160\na lot of different things,\neven though you don't think you are.\n\n103\n00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.200\nSo the good thing is it is actually\nalready transitioning over.\n\n104\n00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.394\nThings are starting to happen\ninside of the local area network.\n\n105\n00:05:25.394 --> 00:05:28.412\nWhere it's gonna be a bigger transition\nis gonna be out on the Internet.\n\n106\n00:05:28.412 --> 00:05:32.492\nWhen things get converted over to IPv6,\nthat takes a little bit more manual\n\n107\n00:05:32.492 --> 00:05:35.371\nconfiguration and\nmaybe a little bit more tweaking.\n\n108\n00:05:35.371 --> 00:05:38.673\nBut for you and me, a lot of it's\ngonna be handled by the machine so\n\n109\n00:05:38.673 --> 00:05:40.548\nthat we do not have to worry about it.\n\n110\n00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:44.148\nBut is there a change coming\nfundamentally, networkwide, everywhere?\n\n111\n00:05:44.148 --> 00:05:47.992\nYes, there's gonna come a point\nwhen the majority of the Internet,\n\n112\n00:05:47.992 --> 00:05:51.450\nif not the entirety of the Internet,\nswitches over to IPv6.\n\n113\n00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.104\nIt's not gonna be long before\nbusiness networks say, look,\n\n114\n00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:56.093\nwe need to go ahead and\nswitch on over as well and\n\n115\n00:05:56.093 --> 00:05:58.660\nthen it's gonna start happening\nin the home networks too.\n\n116\n00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.640\nAnd all the sudden,\nwe wont really have to wonder whether or\n\n117\n00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.257\nnot it's actually happening.\n\n118\n00:06:03.257 --> 00:06:04.478\nIt will convert over.\n\n119\n00:06:04.478 --> 00:06:06.695\nMost home users are never gonna\nactually notice the difference.\n\n120\n00:06:06.695 --> 00:06:07.380\nWhy?\n\n121\n00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.007\nBecause most of them may not even know\nat this point that they even have\n\n122\n00:06:11.007 --> 00:06:13.900\nan IP address, better yet an IPv6 address.\n\n123\n00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.560\nSo, it is happening out there and\nyou are starting to see it.\n\n124\n00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.490\nSo, if we're starting to use it and\n\n125\n00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.860\nwe're starting to do this and we've\nstuck with IPv4, why are we changing?\n\n126\n00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.670\nWell, that's a good question, right?\n\n127\n00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:30.010\nThe reason why we are changing\nover is because the IPv4\n\n128\n00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:34.020\naddress space is relatively small for\ntoday's world.\n\n129\n00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.670\nNobody predicted the growth of\nthe Internet as quickly as it did.\n\n130\n00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.852\nTo kind of tell you about the growth\nrate of the Internet, right?\n\n131\n00:06:40.852 --> 00:06:44.776\nSo if you go all the way back,\nlet's say to 1980, okay?\n\n132\n00:06:44.776 --> 00:06:48.616\nIf you do that, let's say that the\nInternet at that point, from what you and\n\n133\n00:06:48.616 --> 00:06:51.970\nI would understand,\nis about 10,000 computers.\n\n134\n00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.710\nSo that's a pretty big number.\n\n135\n00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.731\nBut then in the next five years,\nlike 1985,\n\n136\n00:06:56.731 --> 00:06:59.620\nit jumped to a hundred-thousand computers.\n\n137\n00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.602\nThen by 1990,\nit went to over two million computers.\n\n138\n00:07:04.602 --> 00:07:06.465\nSo about every five years,\n\n139\n00:07:06.465 --> 00:07:11.407\nthe exponential jump in this is where\nwe started realizing the problem.\n\n140\n00:07:11.407 --> 00:07:15.877\nSo even though there are four billion\npossible addresses on the Internet, well,\n\n141\n00:07:15.877 --> 00:07:20.215\nyou can imagine that if they went from\na hundred thousand in '85 to two million\n\n142\n00:07:20.215 --> 00:07:24.620\nfive years later, well, when they\nstarted projecting the growth by 1995,\n\n143\n00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:29.285\nthey really projected by about 2000,\nsomewhere around there by the late 90s,\n\n144\n00:07:29.285 --> 00:07:33.830\nthere would be no IPv4 addresses\nleft available on the Internet.\n\n145\n00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:38.540\nAnd they were predicting\nthis from like 1985,\n\n146\n00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.980\nwhen they realized the growth and\nthe curve that was actually gonna happen.\n\n147\n00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.006\nSo they started working on\na brand new addressing scheme,\n\n148\n00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:47.425\nand that actually is\nwhere IPv6 came in from.\n\n149\n00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:50.852\nSo what they did is they'd say, look,\nwe can't have this happen again.\n\n150\n00:07:50.852 --> 00:07:54.573\nWe don't wanna switch to a system in which\nwe have to stop every 15 years and go,\n\n151\n00:07:54.573 --> 00:07:57.928\nlook, we're gonna run out of addresses\nagain, let's pop to a new one.\n\n152\n00:07:57.928 --> 00:08:02.574\nSo when they did this, right When we\nhad 4.2 billion address in binary,\n\n153\n00:08:02.574 --> 00:08:07.725\nthat's 32 1's and 0's if you were\nto actually write it out in binary.\n\n154\n00:08:07.725 --> 00:08:11.530\nThat said, we've gotta make this\naddress space so much bigger, so\n\n155\n00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.011\nmuch larger, that we should never run out.\n\n156\n00:08:14.011 --> 00:08:19.100\nAnd when they meant never run out, they\nmeant even figuratively never run out.\n\n157\n00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.557\nIn other words, when you try to\ndescribe it, this address pool is so\n\n158\n00:08:22.557 --> 00:08:26.890\ngigantic, that even the analogies\nused to describe it don't make sense.\n\n159\n00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:32.000\nSo they chose a two to the 128th\npower pool of addresses.\n\n160\n00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.494\nSo if you don't know what that looks like,\nstring up a bunch of ones and zeroes,\n\n161\n00:08:35.494 --> 00:08:38.420\nit's 128 of them in a row,\nthat's what it looks like.\n\n162\n00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.440\nAnd when you start looking at it,\nit doesn't look very big.\n\n163\n00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.170\nBut to try and tell you some of\nthe analogies to doing this, and\n\n164\n00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:45.280\nwe've all heard them.\n\n165\n00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.060\nSome of the analogies doing this,\n\n166\n00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:51.150\nwhen I mean that even the analogies\nboggle the mind, it literally is that.\n\n167\n00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:55.010\nSo, one of my favorite one's is when\nyou talk about the volume of the Earth.\n\n168\n00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:59.362\nIf you were to create nanites, okay, these\nare robots the size of human cells and\n\n169\n00:08:59.362 --> 00:09:03.461\nto add any type of volume to them,\nI don't even know how you would weigh one.\n\n170\n00:09:03.461 --> 00:09:07.231\nAnd I said, if you were to create as\nmany as a pool of IPv6 addresses,\n\n171\n00:09:07.231 --> 00:09:09.770\nit would equal 40% of the Earth's volume.\n\n172\n00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:12.545\nHow does that even make sense?\n\n173\n00:09:12.545 --> 00:09:14.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean, that makes no sense.\n\n174\n00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.180\nThe analogy doesn't make any sense.\n\n175\n00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.670\nIf you were to take regular bbs and\nstack them on the surface of the Earth,\n\n176\n00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:23.330\nloop them in a necklace to the nearest\nblack hole and come back around and\n\n177\n00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:28.320\ngive each one an IPv6 address, you'd still\nhave billions of addresses left over.\n\n178\n00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.740\nThat again, still, remember,\neven figuratively,\n\n179\n00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.270\ntrying to run out of these\naddresses is insane.\n\n180\n00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:36.390\nIn other words, they're saying,\nyou can't do that.\n\n181\n00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:37.480\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of addresses running.\n\n182\n00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.990\n&gt;&gt; It's addresses, that, that,\nonce we start doing that, that's why.\n\n183\n00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:41.830\nAnd you might be going,\nwhy in the world would,\n\n184\n00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:43.830\nwould we ever even come close to that?\n\n185\n00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:47.880\nWell, at one time, we normally just had a\nsingle machine, and we would only have one\n\n186\n00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:53.750\nIP address, but the reality is, even right\nnow in today, we can think about it.\n\n187\n00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:58.040\nEven on myself, I have my IP address as\npublic out there on the Internet, and\n\n188\n00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.360\nthat's for my phone.\n\n189\n00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.690\nAnd I have my home address that I have for\nmy IP address there.\n\n190\n00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:04.270\nWe have our address here, so\n\n191\n00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:08.150\nevery person can have three to\nfour to five different addresses.\n\n192\n00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:12.129\nAnd if we were to take up that in IPv4,\nwe would run out a long time ago.\n\n193\n00:10:12.129 --> 00:10:14.865\nAnd so we wanna check out that\nepisode on the IPv4 address and\n\n194\n00:10:14.865 --> 00:10:17.549\nsee why it's actually lasted\nway beyond the 1990s, or\n\n195\n00:10:17.549 --> 00:10:20.890\nbecause we're talking about a few\ntechnologies that helped us.\n\n196\n00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:25.240\nBut the overwhelming idea is to replace\nthat, and that's what IPV6 is all about.\n\n197\n00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:29.310\nIt's about replacing that address pool,\nso that we don't run out.\n\n198\n00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:30.960\nAnd that's what we're trying to get to.\n\n199\n00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.690\nSo, let's go ahead and take a look at\nthe example like what I was telling you.\n\n200\n00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:36.650\nAnd I've got a diagram here, and\n\n201\n00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.260\nI want you to actually see\nhow big this number looks.\n\n202\n00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.573\nI had to kinda shrink this number up, so\n\n203\n00:10:41.573 --> 00:10:45.950\nthat we could actually see what\n128 bits looks like in binary.\n\n204\n00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:48.230\nSo that top line is how you and\n\n205\n00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:51.890\nI would actually have to see this\nwhen we're talking about 128 bits.\n\n206\n00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:55.123\nNow, I just made up a random\nnumber of zeroes and\n\n207\n00:10:55.123 --> 00:10:59.860\nones, so I didn't actually try and make\nany type of pattern recognition to it.\n\n208\n00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:03.980\nBut to make it more humanly\nunderstandable to you and I,\n\n209\n00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.510\nif I try to equate this to IPv4,\nwhere what we actually have are octets,\n\n210\n00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:11.760\nright, were to divide it\nup into eight bit sections.\n\n211\n00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:17.940\nAnd we put a dot in between, that would\nactually leave us what we call 16 octets.\n\n212\n00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.495\nSo in IPv4, we normally have\nfour octets that we deal with,\n\n213\n00:11:21.495 --> 00:11:25.472\nright, four eight bit sections,\n192.168.10.12,\n\n214\n00:11:25.472 --> 00:11:29.468\nwhatever the number might be,\nthat's what we normally deal with.\n\n215\n00:11:29.468 --> 00:11:33.901\nWell, with this one, you do that,\nbut you'd have to go four, 12, or\n\n216\n00:11:33.901 --> 00:11:37.539\n16 times, 192 168, 4..12, 4.13, and\n\n217\n00:11:37.539 --> 00:11:42.730\nyou'd keep going all the way down\nuntil you keep going 16 times that.\n\n218\n00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:45.180\nSo, they realized something,\nthat this address pool,\n\n219\n00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:49.170\nif we're trying to find it that way,\nnobody's gonna be able to keep up with it.\n\n220\n00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:52.710\nSo, they reduced it down a little bit\nmore and said, you wanna know something?\n\n221\n00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.010\nIt's really just moving these\nthings around a little bit.\n\n222\n00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:59.978\nLet's make this a lot easier and\nlet's make instead eight 16 bit sections,\n\n223\n00:11:59.978 --> 00:12:03.830\nwhat we call hextets is what\nwe call them at this point.\n\n224\n00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:06.880\nSo, you actually have\neight 16-bit sections.\n\n225\n00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.600\nWell, that's what that third line\nis about which is right here,\n\n226\n00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:14.620\nwhere they started marking\noff 16 binary bits instead.\n\n227\n00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:15.420\nWell, then they realized,\n\n228\n00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:19.140\npeople are still not going to be\nable to do this if we did that.\n\n229\n00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:23.030\nSo, they changed the representation\ninstead of using binary\n\n230\n00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:25.450\nto a dotted decimal notion,\nwhere something you and\n\n231\n00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:29.130\nI can read that said, we've gotta\nactually report this in hexadecimal.\n\n232\n00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:32.420\nAnd that's where we get to\nthis format right here.\n\n233\n00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:34.820\nIt's what we call\nthe hexadecimal notation.\n\n234\n00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.860\nTechnically, somewhere down the line,\nsomebody actually called it,\n\n235\n00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:42.080\nformally, it's called\nthe hexadecimal double colon format.\n\n236\n00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.410\nNobody remembers that anymore, and\nthat's because the last several years,\n\n237\n00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:50.000\nall the way up to about two years ago, the\nstandard was continually fluctuating and\n\n238\n00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.890\nchanging and doing a bunch of\ndifferent things, names went away.\n\n239\n00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:55.700\nThings went away, and now it's just\ncalled the hexadecimal notation.\n\n240\n00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:59.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Ronnie, I would say that this\nright here is the exact reason that\n\n241\n00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:03.110\npeople see this string of numbers, right?\n\n242\n00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:07.030\nEven the shortest form of this\ncan be a little unnerving.\n\n243\n00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:10.392\nAnd the nerves start to go, and the hand\nstarts to shake, and the lip quivers.\n\n244\n00:13:10.392 --> 00:13:12.329\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And they say [LAUGH], right?\n\n245\n00:13:12.329 --> 00:13:14.866\nAnd I mean, some of them,\nwe're talking hex here, so\n\n246\n00:13:14.866 --> 00:13:17.693\nyou're gonna be working with numbers and\nletters, right?\n\n247\n00:13:17.693 --> 00:13:19.518\nThat kind of tends to set people back, and\n\n248\n00:13:19.518 --> 00:13:22.869\nI think that's one of the reasons a lot\nof people have a hard time with IPv6.\n\n249\n00:13:22.869 --> 00:13:28.446\nIt looks scary, it looks intimidating, and\nwe're so used to IPv4, it's nice, right?\n\n250\n00:13:28.446 --> 00:13:31.919\nIt's 192, I understand 192,\nI understand 168,\n\n251\n00:13:31.919 --> 00:13:35.536\nI can do a little binary math and\nmake that kind of thing happen.\n\n252\n00:13:35.536 --> 00:13:38.420\nYou start getting into hex conversion,\nand that's kind of a pain.\n\n253\n00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:44.290\nAnd it's like, are we gonna have to dive\nas deep into IPv6 as we have with IPv4?\n\n254\n00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:45.082\nMaybe, maybe not.\n\n255\n00:13:45.082 --> 00:13:46.500\nI'm just saying we've got so\nmany addresses,\n\n256\n00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:50.930\nwe probably won't need to do any of the\nsub-netting stuff, but maybe you still do,\n\n257\n00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:53.004\nand I think that's what holds people off.\n\n258\n00:13:53.004 --> 00:13:53.780\n&gt;&gt; There is no doubt.\n\n259\n00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:56.780\nIt is scary looking first\ntime that you deal with it.\n\n260\n00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:59.520\nBut you are gonna end up learning\nsomething as you get your networking\n\n261\n00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.530\ncareer started.\n\n262\n00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:02.590\nOne, of course,\nis your gonna learn binary math.\n\n263\n00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:04.050\nYou're just going to.\n\n264\n00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:08.110\nAnd then secondly,\nbecause you're in this great time period\n\n265\n00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:12.330\nwhere you at least have an understanding\nof the formatting of this address, and\n\n266\n00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:15.580\nthen understand that the background of it\na little bit, you're actually getting in\n\n267\n00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.690\nat a great level when people\nare starting that transition over.\n\n268\n00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:22.930\nSo, getting a head start on is not gonna\ndo anything, but help you in your career,\n\n269\n00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:27.350\nand then you can also learn what hexa\ndecimal numbering a little bit as well.\n\n270\n00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:29.840\nSo, what we're doing today is just\ntrying to show you the background and\n\n271\n00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.150\nthe representation here.\n\n272\n00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:34.590\nAnd so right here, this is what you end\nup seeing as an address that really\n\n273\n00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:39.120\nIs represented this way across\nmost of the devices that you see.\n\n274\n00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.540\nAnd you also end up seeing\nthat whereas also in IPv4\n\n275\n00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:47.750\nwe had subnet masks that would help us to\nidentify what the network portion was,\n\n276\n00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:49.860\nversus what the host portion was, right?\n\n277\n00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.150\nNetworks are a group.\n\n278\n00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:52.200\nThe host ID, or\n\n279\n00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:56.420\nthe host number is how we individually\nidentify our devices on that network.\n\n280\n00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:01.570\nWell, in IPv6, they went ahead and made\nkind of an executive decision in this way.\n\n281\n00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:05.160\nMost addresses are gonna\nend with this /64.\n\n282\n00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.950\nAnd what that means is that all of\nthe networking addresses that you and\n\n283\n00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:12.440\nI will tend to encounter the majority\nof times, the first 64 bits,\n\n284\n00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:17.670\nin other words the first half of 128 bit\naddress is gonna be your network ID,\n\n285\n00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:19.510\nthe group that you're a part of.\n\n286\n00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:22.690\nAnd then the last 64-bits is gonna be\n\n287\n00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.680\none of the devices that\nyou're on on that one miller.\n\n288\n00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.230\nNow, if you think about that, right?\n\n289\n00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:32.196\nIf the entirety of the Internet\nright now is a 32-bit address based,\n\n290\n00:15:32.196 --> 00:15:36.909\nthat means that what I can do if I'm\nan ISP is I can assign Daniel one of\n\n291\n00:15:36.909 --> 00:15:40.086\nthese addresses right here, just a /64.\n\n292\n00:15:40.086 --> 00:15:44.610\nAnd Daniel has more computers\non that single, okay,\n\n293\n00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:46.920\nthan the entirety of\nthe Internet right now.\n\n294\n00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.990\nWithout anything else, we would do that.\n\n295\n00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:49.618\n&gt;&gt; I'll take one, please.\n\n296\n00:15:49.618 --> 00:15:52.246\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's all we would really need,\n\n297\n00:15:52.246 --> 00:15:55.863\nbut this session goes even further and\neven better because according\n\n298\n00:15:55.863 --> 00:16:00.224\nto those organizations that hand out and\nassign these numbers, is that in theory,\n\n299\n00:16:00.224 --> 00:16:03.245\nDaniel would actually get\nwhat we call a /48 network.\n\n300\n00:16:03.245 --> 00:16:07.414\nYou'd get an extra 16 bits in there,\nand what does that mean for Daniel?\n\n301\n00:16:07.414 --> 00:16:09.574\nDaniel, that actually means this,\n\n302\n00:16:09.574 --> 00:16:15.050\nis that if you wanted to you could create\nan extra 65,000 networks, that's it.\n\n303\n00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:19.520\nSo Daniel, if you have more than 65,000\nnetworks, well too bad, you have to go and\n\n304\n00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.790\nget another IPv6 address.\n\n305\n00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.348\nSo that's what it really means\n&gt;&gt; Shucks.\n\n306\n00:16:23.348 --> 00:16:27.978\n&gt;&gt; So it is very interesting about\nhow externally big that they\n\n307\n00:16:27.978 --> 00:16:32.350\nactually made this address\npoll to that size.\n\n308\n00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:36.230\nNow because of this, and you can\nsee why it's a little bit unwieldy,\n\n309\n00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:38.470\nnobody is ever gonna say these addresses.\n\n310\n00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.392\nYeah, right now Daniel and\nI could conjur up,\n\n311\n00:16:40.392 --> 00:16:42.126\nwhat's the IP address of your computer?\n\n312\n00:16:42.126 --> 00:16:45.226\n192.168.10.12, no big deal.\n\n313\n00:16:45.226 --> 00:16:48.428\nWell, I'm not gonna ever come up and\ngo, Daniel,\n\n314\n00:16:48.428 --> 00:16:52.380\nmy IP address is 200.0192,\nwe're not gonna do that.\n\n315\n00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.690\nSo that's not gonna happen.\n\n316\n00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:57.320\nSo what ends up happening\nthough is what's gonna become\n\n317\n00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.110\nmore important are things\nlike name resolution.\n\n318\n00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:04.830\nWhere we're gonna actually really depend\non names now more than ever because DNS,\n\n319\n00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:07.970\nthe domain name system, where we\nactually are able to give a name and\n\n320\n00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:11.910\nit translates to an IP address, is gonna\nbecome so important at that point so\n\n321\n00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:13.850\nthat we don't have to actually\nworry about these names.\n\n322\n00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:16.710\nBut you still need to worry about\nthe formatting a little bit more.\n\n323\n00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:20.960\nSo I broke it down here to show you\nthe way that this breaks down as well.\n\n324\n00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.010\nCuz you will see them\nin both these formats.\n\n325\n00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:25.510\nThis first one, of course,\nis the longer format.\n\n326\n00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:30.000\nBut just like any other numbering system,\nyou start to drop off leading zeros.\n\n327\n00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.665\nSo notice where I have 0.192?\n\n328\n00:17:31.665 --> 00:17:36.826\nWhen you drop off those leading zeros on\nthose spaces that you can, and then when\n\n329\n00:17:36.826 --> 00:17:42.490\nyou have consecutive zeros all together,\nlike this group of three sets here.\n\n330\n00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:46.520\nYou can also drop those off, and\nrepresent them by a double colon.\n\n331\n00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.800\nSo you can see right here where\nthat's represented by a double colon.\n\n332\n00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.320\nAnd even again, you drop off those\nleading zeros there at the end.\n\n333\n00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.730\nAnd that truncates it, or\nsmashes it in a little bit more.\n\n334\n00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:00.320\nTo now, where it actually looks\na little bit more like an IP address.\n\n335\n00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:04.070\nAnd I wrote this number on purpose\nthis way so that we could see,\n\n336\n00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:09.460\nwhere I just took an IPv4 address,\nso that you can see there it is.\n\n337\n00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.660\nOops, I'm moving the whole thing.\n\n338\n00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:17.260\n192.168.10, so that way you can could\nthat we can jam that all up in there and\n\n339\n00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:18.985\nmake it actually look\na little bit shorter and\n\n340\n00:18:18.985 --> 00:18:21.220\na little bit more natural to what you and\nI have.\n\n341\n00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:24.750\nAnd we no longer have to deal\nwith that subnet mask anymore.\n\n342\n00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:26.770\nCan you write it out if you want to, yes.\n\n343\n00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:31.100\nBut more than likely instead, you're gonna\nend up with what we call a prefix number.\n\n344\n00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:35.450\nAnd that is just telling you the first\n64 bits are going to end up being,\n\n345\n00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:40.250\nwell, your network portion, and so from\nthat point on, you have the last 64 bits.\n\n346\n00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:43.735\nAnd you can have that many computers\non your network if you want to,\n\n347\n00:18:43.735 --> 00:18:46.200\nif all that's actually\ngonna change that way.\n\n348\n00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.510\nYou have that ability to do so,\n\n349\n00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:52.230\nwhich is very nice if you're gonna\nactually be dealing with IPv6 addresses.\n\n350\n00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:57.030\nSo as complex as it may look,\nthe good thing is they've also designed\n\n351\n00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:00.620\nit in the background, and this is one\nof the extra benefits that you have.\n\n352\n00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:04.270\nThat you and I don't really have to\nmanage a lot of these addresses.\n\n353\n00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:08.870\nSo unlike the IPv4 address where we might\nhave to decide certain things and what we\n\n354\n00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:15.080\nwant to be our address pool, in IPv6,\nwe really don't have if you don't want to.\n\n355\n00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.760\nIn other words these are actually gonna be\nauto configured for you, the devices can\n\n356\n00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:22.700\ndo it themselves, and then they can talk,\nand they can actually figure this out.\n\n357\n00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.940\nBut if you really want to control it, if\nyou want to have that IPv4 version control\n\n358\n00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:31.118\nand be able to actually assign the numbers\nthe way that you want to after it's been\n\n359\n00:19:31.118 --> 00:19:33.403\nassigned to you, you can absolutely do it.\n\n360\n00:19:33.403 --> 00:19:36.326\nThey actually make the programs\nto be able to say all right,\n\n361\n00:19:36.326 --> 00:19:39.840\nyou want that control, you wanna hand\nout IP addresses, you can do it.\n\n362\n00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.320\nYou wanna hand out that IP address,\n\n363\n00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.870\nof course you can do that if\nyou really want to do it.\n\n364\n00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:48.105\nMost of us though, and I really mean\nme is what I'm saying, is I'm glad for\n\n365\n00:19:48.105 --> 00:19:52.275\nthe fact that I won't really have to\never manage IP addresses in that way if\n\n366\n00:19:52.275 --> 00:19:53.709\nI really don't need to.\n\n367\n00:19:53.709 --> 00:19:57.121\nBut if you do have that network where you\ngo no, I need to make sure I know exactly\n\n368\n00:19:57.121 --> 00:20:00.143\nwhat's assigned to what,\nthey still give you that ability to do so.\n\n369\n00:20:00.143 --> 00:20:04.806\nBut then if you're like me, the lazy\nadmin, you just go and no just assign it,\n\n370\n00:20:04.806 --> 00:20:10.060\ntell me it works and I'll be okay with and\nI'm fine with it when we start doing that.\n\n371\n00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:14.050\nSo there is a lot of benefits\nto just understanding,\n\n372\n00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:15.910\njust those basics there too.\n\n373\n00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:19.670\n&gt;&gt; All right Ronnie, you're making me feel\nmore comfortable with this IPv6 business.\n\n374\n00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:23.685\nI'm not so scared, I feel like I\nhave a warm, comfortable sweater on.\n\n375\n00:20:23.685 --> 00:20:27.235\nContinue comforting me cuz I still need\nthat, I still feel some heart palpitation.\n\n376\n00:20:27.235 --> 00:20:28.642\nWhat else can I expect from IPv6?\n\n377\n00:20:28.642 --> 00:20:32.974\n&gt;&gt; With IPv6, with the ability to do\nthat auto configuration where you and\n\n378\n00:20:32.974 --> 00:20:35.055\nI don't have to manage it.\n\n379\n00:20:35.055 --> 00:20:38.715\nAnd you're actually starting to see now,\nthe configuration's gonna be fairly easy.\n\n380\n00:20:38.715 --> 00:20:42.455\nThe good thing is, another thing about\nit is that we no longer have to be\n\n381\n00:20:42.455 --> 00:20:46.240\ndependent upon a single IP address for\neverything.\n\n382\n00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.440\nNow you may think that's a great thing,\nbecause it uniquely identifies you, but\n\n383\n00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.160\nthere's problems that happen with IPv4,\nand\n\n384\n00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.710\nthat's because of the growth of what we\nstart expecting IPv4 to be able to handle.\n\n385\n00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:59.980\nAnd what they did is they started\nadding in just stuff on top of it.\n\n386\n00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.540\nThe thing about running IPv4,\n\n387\n00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:04.930\nis really meant to identify who\nyou are and who you aren't.\n\n388\n00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.010\nBut then when you started\nconnecting across other networks,\n\n389\n00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:10.170\npeople started realizing that\nwe need security on top of this.\n\n390\n00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:13.440\nWell, IPv4 wasn't designed\nwith security in mind.\n\n391\n00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.270\nSo what did they have to do?\n\n392\n00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:16.570\nThey had to come out with\nanother security protocol.\n\n393\n00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:19.730\nSo they run IPv4 and\nthen they run the security over it.\n\n394\n00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:22.240\nSo there's an extra layer that\nthey have to add in there.\n\n395\n00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.805\nSo if you think about that, it's not\nnatively designed to handle any security.\n\n396\n00:21:25.805 --> 00:21:27.600\nWith IPv6 though, it is.\n\n397\n00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.035\nIt's actually designed and\n\n398\n00:21:29.035 --> 00:21:32.940\nit's built in within mind that you're\ngonna be using secured communication.\n\n399\n00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:37.810\nNow whether you choose to do so or not is\nnot really up to them, they're saying,\n\n400\n00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:41.190\nwe're giving you the choice but instead\nyou having to add in an extra layer to\n\n401\n00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:45.180\ndoing this, what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna build it into the protocol itself.\n\n402\n00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:47.410\nSo if you want it, you can use it, and\n\n403\n00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:50.520\nyou don't have to add in extra\nlayers of security to do so.\n\n404\n00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:54.900\nYou actually just turn it on and it's\ngonna be opened and available for you.\n\n405\n00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:59.000\nThe other thing that you also will\nhave is the ability to have traffic\n\n406\n00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.580\nrun a lot smoother on your networks and\nthat is because different IP addresses\n\n407\n00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:06.600\nare gonna be used for\ndifferent types of traffic too.\n\n408\n00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.570\nSo now your machine doesn't have to\ndecide what's more important and\n\n409\n00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:11.230\nwhat goes to your computer first.\n\n410\n00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:14.710\nIs it gonna be the music that you're\nstreaming or is it gonna be the file\n\n411\n00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:18.180\nyou're actually downloading at that point,\nwhere your machine now has to actually\n\n412\n00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.740\ndecide that and figure out which\nside's actually more important.\n\n413\n00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:24.470\nWell different addresses, that will\nalso be assigned to your computer,\n\n414\n00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:28.280\nwill actually be able to handle that\ntraffic on different IP addresses and\n\n415\n00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.130\nmake it much easier to identify.\n\n416\n00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:33.590\nWhen they make it easier to identify, it\nmeans they can actually put certain labels\n\n417\n00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:37.880\non it to make traffic flow a little bit\nsmoother and little bit faster as well.\n\n418\n00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:42.608\nSo there is a lot of extra benefits to\nhaving IPv6, and they did that on purpose\n\n419\n00:22:42.608 --> 00:22:47.429\nbecause they realized that without it,\nthere is no real reason to change over.\n\n420\n00:22:47.429 --> 00:22:51.569\nBut the biggest reason to changeover is\nbecause the internet is running out of\n\n421\n00:22:51.569 --> 00:22:52.770\naddresses.\n\n422\n00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:56.460\nBut now if you use it inside your LANs\nthere are a bunch of extra benefits\n\n423\n00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.190\nto being able to change over to IPv6.\n\n424\n00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:04.192\n&gt;&gt; Now that being said obviously IPv6,\nit has a lot of benefit.\n\n425\n00:23:04.192 --> 00:23:07.760\nCuz Ronnie's been touting its greatness\nsince the beginning of this show.\n\n426\n00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:11.568\nBut there's gonna be some holdbacks\nRonnie, there's gonna be some people that\n\n427\n00:23:11.568 --> 00:23:14.210\nthey so love that IPv4 and\nthey're so afraid of IPv6.\n\n428\n00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:16.358\nWe've gotta get them into the IPv6 realm.\n\n429\n00:23:16.358 --> 00:23:20.489\nWhat can we do, or what has the IPv\nversion people done, that create\n\n430\n00:23:20.489 --> 00:23:25.420\nthis stuff, what have they done to try\nto help get them into this version?\n\n431\n00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:28.650\n&gt;&gt; What they've actually done is what we\ncall different transitional technologies\n\n432\n00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:30.260\nthat we have on hand.\n\n433\n00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:33.390\nAnd that idea of the transitional\ntechnologies is because\n\n434\n00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:36.520\nyou're gonna find still resistance\nof people changing over.\n\n435\n00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.360\nSo there are going to be things\nlike this where you might\n\n436\n00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:42.943\nchoose inside of your local area network,\nyou're gonna run IPv6,\n\n437\n00:23:42.943 --> 00:23:45.682\nbut it could be that your\nISP isn't gonna run IPv6.\n\n438\n00:23:45.682 --> 00:23:48.061\nNow, hopefully not, but it could be or\n\n439\n00:23:48.061 --> 00:23:52.280\nit might be somebody else's ISP\ndown the road, doesn't run IPv6.\n\n440\n00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:56.708\nSo transitional technologies allow\nus to be able to take IPv4 and\n\n441\n00:23:56.708 --> 00:24:00.581\nIPv6 traffic and use them together for\na period of time.\n\n442\n00:24:00.581 --> 00:24:04.523\nNow, most of the transitional technologies\nthat exist in the form that they're in\n\n443\n00:24:04.523 --> 00:24:06.565\nright now, they really don't work well.\n\n444\n00:24:06.565 --> 00:24:11.321\nNot saying that they can't work,\nnot saying that they don't work,\n\n445\n00:24:11.321 --> 00:24:13.570\nbut they don't work well.\n\n446\n00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:18.180\nThere's a lot of differences depending on\nthe way that your network is configured,\n\n447\n00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:20.240\nwhether it's using certain technology or\nnot.\n\n448\n00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:23.350\nYou have to choose what type of\ntransitional technology that you're\n\n449\n00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:24.570\ngoing to use.\n\n450\n00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:26.250\nBut by far, they really do,\n\n451\n00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:29.850\nthey're a bit clunky in how they actually\ntranslate across different networks.\n\n452\n00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:32.720\nSo the one that Microsoft\nhas chosen to use, and\n\n453\n00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.820\neven Cisco products have chose to use,\nbut Microsoft mainly.\n\n454\n00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:37.390\nThey said look,\nlet's go ahead and do this,\n\n455\n00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:40.390\nlet's implement both\nprotocols at the same time.\n\n456\n00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:44.710\nAnd, that way, IPv6 networks can\nbe deployed at the same time, and,\n\n457\n00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:47.530\neven if nobody in your network knows\nabout it, we can actually go ahead and\n\n458\n00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:50.080\nstart configuring those devices to work.\n\n459\n00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:53.500\nAnd, once they're working on IPv6,\nthe only thing we have to do later on is,\n\n460\n00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:57.090\nwhen everybody is kinda calm,\nand everything's working,\n\n461\n00:24:57.090 --> 00:25:01.330\nlet's turn off IPv4 and see what happens\nand now we'll actually be connected.\n\n462\n00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:02.060\nSo in the background,\n\n463\n00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:06.520\nthey've been working very hard to make\nthis a seamless transition for you and me.\n\n464\n00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.930\nAnd that's another benefit of it,\nis that you and\n\n465\n00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:12.620\nI don't have to worry about a lot of\nthe clunky transitional technologies\n\n466\n00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:17.500\nthat have actually been around since\nIPv6 first started to come on board.\n\n467\n00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.590\nNow we are,\nwe're about a good 15 years later\n\n468\n00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:23.570\nthan when people started really saying\nwe've got to start changing over.\n\n469\n00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:28.140\nWell, now a lot of these technologies are\nstarting to kind of go in the background,\n\n470\n00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:32.841\nbecause of the ability to run them in what\nwe call a dual stack configuration, IPv4,\n\n471\n00:25:32.841 --> 00:25:34.640\nIPv6 at the same time.\n\n472\n00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.220\nIt allows us to be able to do\nthis without really having to\n\n473\n00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:40.070\nuse some of those clunky\ntransitional technologies.\n\n474\n00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:44.230\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, well Ronnie, IPv6,\nobviously it's not that scary.\n\n475\n00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:47.460\nYou basically said it does\nall the things IPv4 does,\n\n476\n00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:49.730\nactually it does it a little\nbetter to be honest with you.\n\n477\n00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:53.540\nYou never get over the fact that those\naddresses are very, very lengthy and\n\n478\n00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:54.970\nwe have to deal with hex.\n\n479\n00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:57.140\nOther than that,\nonce you get past those two things,\n\n480\n00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:59.970\nit sounds like we'll be pretty\ngood to go and set to jet.\n\n481\n00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:03.119\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just about, there are a few\ndifferent formatting issues that we have\n\n482\n00:26:03.119 --> 00:26:05.510\nto actually talk about as well.\n\n483\n00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:09.840\nSo we do need to cover a few of\nthe special addresses too, Daniel,\n\n484\n00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:10.770\nwhen we start dealing with this.\n\n485\n00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:14.831\nBecause identifying those is really gonna\nbe a part of understanding basic IPv6.\n\n486\n00:26:14.831 --> 00:26:16.280\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n487\n00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:19.020\n&gt;&gt; So when we take a look at\nthose special addresses here,\n\n488\n00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:20.340\nlet's just identify a few of them.\n\n489\n00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:24.365\nAnd let's go back to my screen and that\nway we can go ahead and do that as well.\n\n490\n00:26:24.365 --> 00:26:28.201\nSo here, when we start talking about it,\nyou're gonna actually see some different\n\n491\n00:26:28.201 --> 00:26:31.000\nones that are actually going\nto be available to you.\n\n492\n00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.960\nSo one of the easiest ones\nthat you'll end up seeing,\n\n493\n00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:38.070\nis one that actually begins\nwith this right here.\n\n494\n00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:40.580\nLet me make sure I actually\ngive you the right number here.\n\n495\n00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:44.020\nIf you see an address that begins\nwith FE80, now you might say,\n\n496\n00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:49.400\nI think I saw something like that\nearlier in the show, you absolutely did.\n\n497\n00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:52.722\nSo right here on my computer, oops.\n\n498\n00:26:52.722 --> 00:26:57.503\nSee if I can mark that up, there is FE80,\nand you see that :: there.\n\n499\n00:26:57.503 --> 00:27:00.363\nNow, it doesn't always have to be\nthe :: directly underneath, but\n\n500\n00:27:00.363 --> 00:27:01.790\nyou do see this right here.\n\n501\n00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:06.420\nWhen you see an address like that, that is\nwhat is called that link local address.\n\n502\n00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:10.355\nA link local address in IPv6\nis when the IPv6 device and\n\n503\n00:27:10.355 --> 00:27:15.139\nmachine that's running that\nprotocol assigns itself an address.\n\n504\n00:27:15.139 --> 00:27:19.191\nAnd you might have actually remembered\nthis from the days of IPv4, so\n\n505\n00:27:19.191 --> 00:27:22.979\nyou do wanna pay attention to\nan address like that as well, okay?\n\n506\n00:27:22.979 --> 00:27:25.700\nSo make sure you take a look there too.\n\n507\n00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:27.772\nSo you will see stuff like this and\n\n508\n00:27:27.772 --> 00:27:32.286\nthe nice thing about it is that this\nis fairly useful in comparison to that\n\n509\n00:27:32.286 --> 00:27:38.000\n169.254 address that we also talk about\ntoo in the troubleshooting in IPv4.\n\n510\n00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.070\nThat address today is not as useful as\nit once was but this one really is.\n\n511\n00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:46.480\nWhen you are making direct communication\nto another device on your network,\n\n512\n00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:50.040\nthis is probably the one that's\nactually being used in the background.\n\n513\n00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.430\nSo even if you actually have\na lot of other addresses,\n\n514\n00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:54.180\nwhen you talk about\ndirect communications and\n\n515\n00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:58.070\ncommands, this is the one that's gonna\nbe used the majority of the time.\n\n516\n00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:01.050\nNow there are actually several\ndifferent addresses that we\n\n517\n00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:02.908\nstill need to go back and take a look at.\n\n518\n00:28:02.908 --> 00:28:05.110\nBut Daniel, taking a look at the time,\n\n519\n00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:08.130\nI think we're gonna have to do\na part two on this, I really do.\n\n520\n00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:09.574\n&gt;&gt; Do you think it'll\ntake a whole part two?\n\n521\n00:28:09.574 --> 00:28:10.740\n&gt;&gt; I think it may take a whole part two.\n\n522\n00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:11.870\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n523\n00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:14.740\nAll right, Ronnie, well if it takes\na part two, it takes a part two and\n\n524\n00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:15.460\nthat's what we'll have to do.\n\n525\n00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:16.870\nHopefully we'll see you guys there.\n\n526\n00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:19.450\nThank you so much for\nthose demonstrations and explanations.\n\n527\n00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:20.990\nAnd thank you guys for\nwatching, and again,\n\n528\n00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:22.520\nhopefully we'll see you in that part two.\n\n529\n00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.980\nAs for this episode, we're gonna\ngo ahead and sign off for ITProTV,\n\n530\n00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:26.800\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n531\n00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:27.460\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n532\n00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:28.880\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next

exciting episode of\nITProTV, I'm your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n4\n00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.000\nJoining me today is none other than Mr.\nRonnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.770\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.920\n>> It is going great today.\n\n7\n00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.087\nWe're right here in the studio ready\nto begin taking a look at the MTA,\n\n8\n00:00:25.087 --> 00:00:29.483\nthe Microsoft Technology Associate Getting\nready for exam 98366.\n\n9\n00:00:29.483 --> 00:00:31.505\nThat's the networking fundamentals.\n\n10\n00:00:31.505 --> 00:00:35.455\nTrying to put these fun back in networking\nfundamentals is what we're trying to do.\n\n11\n00:00:35.455 --> 00:00:37.765\nIt is our job, we really do enjoy this.\n\n12\n00:00:37.765 --> 00:00:40.125\nAnd what we're taking a look\nat today specifically right,\n\n13\n00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:45.220\nis finishing up some details in IPv6 and\nunderstanding IPv6.\n\n14\n00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.160\nSo, where we took a look\nat in a previous episode,\n\n15\n00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.850\nis talking about\nthe foundation of a foray.\n\n16\n00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.710\nLet me show you what I'm talking\nabout right here on the screen,\n\n17\n00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.300\nis that we kind of took a little bit\nabout where it actually comes from too.\n\n18\n00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.820\nSo it starts off in the same place where\nwe have IP addressing that you and\n\n19\n00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.802\nI know is IPv4 in the binary and\nit quickly transitions in.\n\n20\n00:01:04.802 --> 00:01:08.190\nAnd then today what we're talking about\nin IPv6 is really what we'll call\n\n21\n00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.320\na hexidecimal looking\ntype of notation here.\n\n22\n00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.989\nSo this address base is much bigger\nthan what was previously done.\n\n23\n00:01:15.989 --> 00:01:19.137\nAnd the reason why we want to actually\nunderstand that is because well,\n\n24\n00:01:19.137 --> 00:01:21.348\nwe don't wanna run out of\nthese addresses again.\n\n25\n00:01:21.348 --> 00:01:25.277\nSo IPv6, at least for what we're doing\ntoday, is not only the networking of\n\n26\n00:01:25.277 --> 00:01:28.610\ntoday, it's actually gonna\nbe forever more than likely.\n\n27\n00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.590\nIs how big this address\npool is going to be.\n\n28\n00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.370\nSo when you start seeing these addresses\non the network, remember that that's when\n\n29\n00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.040\nyou're gonna see in the future when\nit comes down to networking, right.\n\n30\n00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.980\nYou and I are gonna see these\non individual machines like PCs\n\n31\n00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:43.720\ninside of our network.\n\n32\n00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.830\nWe're gonna see them\nused across the Internet.\n\n33\n00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.950\nYou're gonna see them\non every single device.\n\n34\n00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.560\nAnd unlike IPv4,\nwe don't have to worry about\n\n35\n00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.560\nmanaging a lot of it unless\nwe just want to control it.\n\n36\n00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.180\nSo what are we left with that\nwe really have to talk on.\n\n37\n00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.970\nWell there's several things here and\n\n38\n00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.620\none of them has to do with what we call\ndifferent types of special addresses.\n\n39\n00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.480\nAnd the reason for that is to remember\nthat what we have is an IPv6.\n\n40\n00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.360\nThere are gonna be different\ntypes of addresses\n\n41\n00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.020\ndepending on the traffic that's\nactually gonna come across you.\n\n42\n00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.160\nSo, gone are gonna be the days where\na single device is gonna have just\n\n43\n00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.290\none IP address.\n\n44\n00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.270\nAnd then regardless of the way\nthat traffic gets to that device\n\n45\n00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.370\nit only uses that one address.\n\n46\n00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.490\nYour machines are gonna be\nassigned special addressed\n\n47\n00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.170\nthat are going to be used in the way\nthat you actually do communicate.\n\n48\n00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.150\nAnd so you do have to get\nused to another system here\n\n49\n00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.670\nin which your single device is actually\ngonna have multiple IP addresses.\n\n50\n00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.350\nAnd it just depends on what's being done.\n\n51\n00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.070\nSo, when we start taking\na look here on my machine.\n\n52\n00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.090\nNow, I went ahead and typed out on\none of them that we had addressed in\n\n53\n00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.690\na previous episode, but\nit's good for us to review.\n\n54\n00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.800\nIs that if you see any address\nthat begins with an FE80, and\n\n55\n00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.730\nthen you actually have colons, and\n\n56\n00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.720\nthen you have a bunch of other numbers,\nwhatever it might, and it has a slash 10.\n\n57\n00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.530\nThat's just telling you that the first\nten bits of this address is significant.\n\n58\n00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.970\nNow, each one of these letters\nrepresents about four bits, so\n\n59\n00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:04.980\nit's actually saying that.\n\n60\n00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.660\nAnd when you start seeing that, that's\nwhat they're saying here, is that hey,\n\n61\n00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.560\nonly those first ten bits\nare really significant\n\n62\n00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.200\nin this address as being\nthe network portion.\n\n63\n00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.422\nWell, that type of address is\nequivalent to what we see in IPv4\n\n64\n00:03:17.422 --> 00:03:19.261\nas being an APIPA address.\n\n65\n00:03:19.261 --> 00:03:21.981\nIf you remember that 169.254 address,\n\n66\n00:03:21.981 --> 00:03:26.605\nin which those computers assign themselves\nthat type of address when they don't\n\n67\n00:03:26.605 --> 00:03:29.808\nactually have communication\nthe way that they need to.\n\n68\n00:03:29.808 --> 00:03:33.250\nWell that address is really used for\ntroubleshooting today.\n\n69\n00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.330\nWell in IPv6 though, that address is\nactually the first one that's designed,\n\n70\n00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.970\nthat's assigned, excuse me, to itself.\n\n71\n00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.040\nAnd that is because it's not\nsomething just for troubleshooting.\n\n72\n00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.370\nIt's because it's the most useful address.\n\n73\n00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.880\nAnd we did take a look at\nwhere we can find that.\n\n74\n00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.010\nIf you do bring up your command prompt in\na machine, regardless of whether you're\n\n75\n00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.970\ntalking about server 2008 or Windows 8 or\nWindows 7, and you do a IP configuration,\n\n76\n00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.520\nit normally shows you an IP\naddress that begins with FE80.\n\n77\n00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.120\nAnd there it is.\nThey call it a link local.\n\n78\n00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.840\nSo the link local address is\nequivalent to what you and I would see\n\n79\n00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.490\nas being that APIPA address, but\nthis one I put in parenthesis is useful.\n\n80\n00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.530\nIt's the first one that's assigned and\nthat's because it's going to be used\n\n81\n00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.780\nmore often than most of the addresses\nthat we also end up seeing.\n\n82\n00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.670\nNow there's other things that\nwe also have to worry about\n\n83\n00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.320\ntoo inside of IPv6 networks.\n\n84\n00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.880\nSee if I can actually get to the point\nwhere I can type back into this\n\n85\n00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:30.940\nmachine here.\n\n86\n00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.200\nAnother one that you might end up\nseeing is one that begins with FC00\n\n87\n00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.450\nhere and then that's also gonna be a ::/8.\n\n88\n00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.980\nAnd this is where we begin\nwith what we call the,\n\n89\n00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.220\nit's what's gonna be the same as\nwe we call private IP addresses.\n\n90\n00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.187\nNow, this is where we talk\nabout the reserved addresses.\n\n91\n00:04:54.187 --> 00:04:57.217\nAgain, if you go back to the IPV 4 show,\nplease do take a look at that.\n\n92\n00:04:57.217 --> 00:05:01.584\nRemember that there are private IP\naddresses that we can use within our own\n\n93\n00:05:01.584 --> 00:05:02.294\nnetworks.\n\n94\n00:05:02.294 --> 00:05:07.350\nAnd in IPv6, they still give you that\nability to also use private addresses\n\n95\n00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.787\nthat you might only use within\na single network, if you choose to.\n\n96\n00:05:11.787 --> 00:05:14.874\nAnd when you start taking that,\nit actually begins with FC00.\n\n97\n00:05:14.874 --> 00:05:19.783\nAnd the way that, that ends up translating\nout is a little bit strange, too.\n\n98\n00:05:19.783 --> 00:05:24.328\nIs that what will end up really happening\nhere, is that when they assign it,\n\n99\n00:05:24.328 --> 00:05:28.743\nbecause it's an address pool,\nit really turns out to be FD00 instead.\n\n100\n00:05:28.743 --> 00:05:31.090\nSo the even though the range begins at FC,\n\n101\n00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.210\nit really translates into FD as\nkind of a strange way to do things.\n\n102\n00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.020\nSo if you're talking about private\nIP addresses, well, in IPv6,\n\n103\n00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.530\nthat's where you see that as either FC or\nFD too.\n\n104\n00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.580\nAnd so, you have different\ntraffic that's only designed for\n\n105\n00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.760\na certain group of computers\ninside of your network.\n\n106\n00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.090\nThat's what you're gonna\nend up using as well,\n\n107\n00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.990\nwhen you want something\nlike that to happen.\n\n108\n00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.640\n>> So Ronnie, we're gonna use\nthese private IP addresses.\n\n109\n00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.530\nEven though it's IPv6 and we've got\na bazillion, gajillion addresses.\n\n110\n00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.190\n>> [LAUGH] We do.\n>> We wouldn't need to.\n\n111\n00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.490\nWe do this more for\norganizational purposes, right?\n\n112\n00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.320\nSo, we can keep an eye on\nwhat we know is ours and\n\n113\n00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.700\nI don't have to worry about going,\nokay, which IPv6 address is this?\n\n114\n00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.475\nCuz like you said,\nthere's so many of them.\n\n115\n00:06:13.475 --> 00:06:14.331\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n116\n00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:17.751\nthere's no doubt that this is gonna be a\nlittle bit confusing at the beginning for\n\n117\n00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:19.927\nnetwork administrators\nto start seeing traffic.\n\n118\n00:06:19.927 --> 00:06:23.000\nBut once you realize that you're only\ngonna receive that type of traffic on\n\n119\n00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.134\nthose types of addresses.\n\n120\n00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:28.266\nIt really helps to eliminate like is this\ntraffic actually designed for everybody or\n\n121\n00:06:28.266 --> 00:06:28.800\nis it not.\n\n122\n00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.260\nIf it's coming in over here,\n\n123\n00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.140\nthat means that somebody specifically\nsent it with that address in mind.\n\n124\n00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.054\nSo that your machine's also gonna\nbe able to partake in that too.\n\n125\n00:06:36.054 --> 00:06:41.616\nNow this comes because\nbroadcast is also dead in IPv6.\n\n126\n00:06:41.616 --> 00:06:44.308\nAnd that means we don't just send\nout data on the network hopefully\n\n127\n00:06:44.308 --> 00:06:46.740\nsomebody will actually hear it and\nunderstand it.\n\n128\n00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.300\nIt's because of the way\nthat multicast is working.\n\n129\n00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.715\nSo not only do you have specific kind of\nsub branches of multi-casting like this,\n\n130\n00:06:52.715 --> 00:06:56.300\nbut if you did need to do, oops, let me\nsee if I can get away from that there.\n\n131\n00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:02.070\nIf you did need to do multi-casting,\nwhich is kind of the equivalent of broad,\n\n132\n00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:05.500\nI'm not allowed to say it that way,\nbut it does seem like that.\n\n133\n00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.810\nWhen you do see something like this,\nand think,\n\n134\n00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:11.030\nthis is also the first eight here,\ntoo, on that one.\n\n135\n00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.440\nI may actually be wrong on that one, but\nthis is what we call multi-casting too.\n\n136\n00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.445\nSo, if you need to send out an address\njust to a multicast group, designed\n\n137\n00:07:20.445 --> 00:07:25.884\nto only hit certain computers, you can do\nthat in a general sense by using this.\n\n138\n00:07:25.884 --> 00:07:26.803\nOn the private one,\n\n139\n00:07:26.803 --> 00:07:30.490\nit's probably because you do have special\nsubsets of data that you need to send.\n\n140\n00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:35.900\nIf it's just regular multi-casting your\ngonna use the FF00 instead, and that will\n\n141\n00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:41.650\nalso help out when you start dealing with\nthat, especially that type of traffic.\n\n142\n00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.740\nNow there are routing information\n\n143\n00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.610\nin these special addresses that we\nalso need to pay attention to as well.\n\n144\n00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:52.570\nSo there's a special one that you\nprobably, hopefully not see too often, and\n\n145\n00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:58.050\nthat's if it's just a double colon, and\nthis is called an unspecified address.\n\n146\n00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:03.670\nIf you do happen to end up seeing\ntraffic that is destined for\n\n147\n00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:05.650\nthis, where it's just a double colon.\n\n148\n00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:07.907\nThat means that hey,\nwe're trying to send it.\n\n149\n00:08:07.907 --> 00:08:11.396\nWe don't really know what that\nend address is going to be.\n\n150\n00:08:11.396 --> 00:08:14.211\nSo instead what they do is\nthat they send it here and\n\n151\n00:08:14.211 --> 00:08:18.436\nwhat normally happens at that point,\nit actually just tries to distribute\n\n152\n00:08:18.436 --> 00:08:21.207\nit as much as possible to\nwhoever it need to go to.\n\n153\n00:08:21.207 --> 00:08:25.996\nSo, the unspecified address is\nactually equivalent in IPV 4 to\n\n154\n00:08:25.996 --> 00:08:30.532\na special address,\nthat you might also see as being 0.0.\n\n155\n00:08:30.532 --> 00:08:31.716\nOops.\n\n156\n00:08:31.716 --> 00:08:33.860\n0.0.0.0 here.\n\n157\n00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.125\nSo hopefully you won't see that too often.\n\n158\n00:08:36.125 --> 00:08:40.881\nWhat that actually means is, just go\nout the default as much as you can,\n\n159\n00:08:40.881 --> 00:08:42.957\nthat default gateway as well.\n\n160\n00:08:42.957 --> 00:08:48.513\nNow there's one more that we need to\npay attention to, and that's when the,\n\n161\n00:08:48.513 --> 00:08:53.398\nanything that ends in this 001\nhere is considered the loop back.\n\n162\n00:08:53.398 --> 00:08:57.993\nAnd so this is equivalent to\n127.0.0.1 network, and so\n\n163\n00:08:57.993 --> 00:09:01.007\nthat's the same as the loop back address.\n\n164\n00:09:01.007 --> 00:09:04.362\nSo it still gives us that\nability to do the testing and\n\n165\n00:09:04.362 --> 00:09:06.280\ndo all the different things.\n\n166\n00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:10.690\nLet me see if I can stretch that out so\nthat we can see it a little bit better.\n\n167\n00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:14.630\nSo there are multiple special\naddresses that we have access to\n\n168\n00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:16.830\nthat we really do need\nto pay attention to.\n\n169\n00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:20.060\nThese are by far the most common,\nare the only ones out there.\n\n170\n00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:20.820\nNo.\n\n171\n00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.917\nBut once you get these in mind\ninside of your own network.\n\n172\n00:09:23.917 --> 00:09:25.897\nYou'll probably see these more often.\n\n173\n00:09:25.897 --> 00:09:29.020\nWhen you actually want to start\ncommunicating across the network, oh,\n\n174\n00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.628\nnot across the network,\nacross the Internet I should say.\n\n175\n00:09:31.628 --> 00:09:34.120\nAnd so at that point,\nyou actually start seeing other addresses\n\n176\n00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.170\ninstead that should begin\nwith something like this.\n\n177\n00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:39.446\nWhere it actually begins with a two\ninstead, and that's because of the way\n\n178\n00:09:39.446 --> 00:09:43.270\nthat the global addressing works versus\nwhat you actually see internally.\n\n179\n00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:46.840\nSo these special addresses,\neven though they are a little more, and\n\n180\n00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.950\nyou might be like oh do I\nreally need to know this?\n\n181\n00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:49.620\nYou really do.\n\n182\n00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.765\nAt least the basics here and\nunderstanding what the equivalent is.\n\n183\n00:09:52.765 --> 00:09:54.982\nIf you're having to do testing against\nyour own computer to see if it works.\n\n184\n00:09:54.982 --> 00:09:58.190\nYou're gonna use this colon,\ncolon one, right?\n\n185\n00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:00.790\nIf you know that hey,\nsomething needs to be sent outbound but\n\n186\n00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:03.340\nyour not sure what the destination or\nwhere it was going.\n\n187\n00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:04.914\nYou might use that double colon.\n\n188\n00:10:04.914 --> 00:10:09.010\nIf you know something is actually going\nto be directly connected on that same\n\n189\n00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:12.342\nsegment, and it needs to go really\nin a unicast or a one to one.\n\n190\n00:10:12.342 --> 00:10:15.369\nMore than likely inside that network,\nit's gonna use this address up here,\n\n191\n00:10:15.369 --> 00:10:16.729\nthat's equivalent to the APIPA.\n\n192\n00:10:16.729 --> 00:10:19.859\nAnd then you have private and\nof course, multi-casting,\n\n193\n00:10:19.859 --> 00:10:22.720\ndesigned for\nvery specialized traffic for us.\n\n194\n00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:27.020\nSo all of this is part of\nthe entire package that we see.\n\n195\n00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.405\nSo just by knowing these addresses,\nit really does help.\n\n196\n00:10:30.405 --> 00:10:34.690\nNow you might be wondering, okay, so on my\nmachine, where in the world would I put\n\n197\n00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:39.020\nan address like what we see even up here,\nif I needed to do that?\n\n198\n00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:44.159\nWell, if I go back to my machine,\nnotice I don't have an IPv6 address,\n\n199\n00:10:44.159 --> 00:10:48.961\nbut what I can do is, I can get out\nof that configuration, and I go and\n\n200\n00:10:48.961 --> 00:10:51.010\nfind my local area adapter.\n\n201\n00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:53.204\nSo I can click on the.\n\n202\n00:10:53.204 --> 00:10:53.889\nOops.\n\n203\n00:10:53.889 --> 00:10:58.000\nYep.\nI can right-click on the Start button, go\n\n204\n00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.959\nto Control Panel > Network and Internet,\nand then Network and Sharing Center.\n\n205\n00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:13.080\nAnd from there I can select this,\nthe ethernet zero and properties here.\n\n206\n00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:17.590\nNow when you're actually in networking\nyou'll do this more often then you think,\n\n207\n00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:18.440\nbut it's right here.\n\n208\n00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.180\nInstead of actually going\nwhere I normally would go,\n\n209\n00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:26.380\nwhich is to IPv4,\nI can select IPv6 and properties.\n\n210\n00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:29.590\nAnd this is where you can also add it in,\ntoo.\n\n211\n00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:33.810\nThe majority of the time, you and\nI are not gonna have to do anything,\n\n212\n00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:37.590\nwhen IPv6 comes along,\nbecause it will be auto configured.\n\n213\n00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:41.850\nBut if you do need to have an assignment,\nall you have to do is be willing to\n\n214\n00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.830\ntype in the actual address that\nyou think you're gonna be using.\n\n215\n00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:53.340\nSo let's just make it a little bit easy on\nus and I'll kind of still doing this here.\n\n216\n00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:58.050\nA ten network, and then we'll actually\nassign it, let's say, a dot one there.\n\n217\n00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:01.890\nAnd I can do the subnet\nprefix here of a 64.\n\n218\n00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:03.820\nOops, maybe not.\n\n219\n00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.410\nNot 664, that would be silly.\n\n220\n00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:10.890\n64 and click OK, and\nthen I click close from there and\n\n221\n00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:14.030\nnow if I go to the details and\ndid it save it?\n\n222\n00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:16.470\nSee there it goes.\n\n223\n00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:20.850\nSo you can now see I can assign\nan ipv6 address there if we need to so\n\n224\n00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:23.690\nif you're having to statically\nassign them for control.\n\n225\n00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:25.918\nYou'd do it in the same location but\n\n226\n00:12:25.918 --> 00:12:28.977\ninstead of picking IPV4\nyou also select IPV6.\n\n227\n00:12:28.977 --> 00:12:30.740\nNow, everything that we're talking about,\nright,\n\n228\n00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:32.478\nif we're having to manually\ndo something like this.\n\n229\n00:12:32.478 --> 00:12:37.109\nIt's all about control of those addresses,\nand one of the controls that we\n\n230\n00:12:37.109 --> 00:12:40.650\nhad inside of IPV4 is the use\nof what we call subnetting.\n\n231\n00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:43.160\nNow, when we start\ntalking about subnetting,\n\n232\n00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.469\nin IPV4 we're taking a large\nchunk of an address space.\n\n233\n00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:50.530\nAnd what we're doing is we're\nsubdividing it into smaller sections.\n\n234\n00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:52.330\nWell, can we do that in IPv6?\n\n235\n00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:53.720\nYes you can.\n\n236\n00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:58.180\nYou can actually subnet, but the only\nreason that you're probably going to be\n\n237\n00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:02.570\ndoing that is if you really do need\nto control the address spacing.\n\n238\n00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:06.650\nThe actual specifications and\ndocumentation, they don't recommend that\n\n239\n00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:10.490\nyou actually have the subnet at\nall if you really don't have to.\n\n240\n00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:13.780\nBut if you really are needing to\ncontrol something for one reason or\n\n241\n00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.560\nanother, dividing it up because\nyou really want to make sure that\n\n242\n00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.030\nthese addresses are actually different\nfrom this particular division's address,\n\n243\n00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:22.110\nperfectly fine.\n\n244\n00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:24.180\nYou can still do subnetting.\n\n245\n00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:28.253\nBut when you do it this time, you're not\nactually doing binary division anymore,\n\n246\n00:13:28.253 --> 00:13:31.527\nyou're actually having to learn\nhexidecimal division instead.\n\n247\n00:13:31.527 --> 00:13:34.569\nAnd so it does require\na little bit more practice and\n\n248\n00:13:34.569 --> 00:13:37.964\nbeing able to do this, but\nthe good thing is there's only\n\n249\n00:13:37.964 --> 00:13:41.740\na limited amount of subnetting\nthat the ISP's are going to do.\n\n250\n00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:46.670\nAnd so, that means that whatever you do\ninternally, that's up to you as well.\n\n251\n00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:50.250\nSo, if you do need that extra control,\nyou still have the ability to subnet.\n\n252\n00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:52.323\nMost of the time we don't really need to.\n\n253\n00:13:52.323 --> 00:13:55.110\nOnce they assign it to us and\nwe have all the addresses that we need.\n\n254\n00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:57.088\nIt really doesn't matter\nany more at that point.\n\n255\n00:13:57.088 --> 00:14:01.053\nSo just kinda realize that subnetting is\nstill a possibility, but it's probably not\n\n256\n00:14:01.053 --> 00:14:04.930\nrecommended for anything that you and\nI are going to do at least at this point.\n\n257\n00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:09.420\n>> Yeah, it's kinda the purpose of IPv6\nis that we no longer need the subnet.\n\n258\n00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:11.000\nThere's plenty of addresses.\n\n259\n00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.910\nGo for broke, give every hair on your\nhead an IP address if you feel like it.\n\n260\n00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:16.018\nGive your toaster an IP address.\n\n261\n00:14:16.018 --> 00:14:17.640\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Give your cat an IP address.\n\n262\n00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.800\nAnd give all the hairs on\nyour cat an IP address.\n\n263\n00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:20.900\nAnd we're still not gonna run out of them.\n\n264\n00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.820\nWe're not gonna have to\nworry about depleting them.\n\n265\n00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.008\nRonnie, you talked about that earlier,\n\n266\n00:14:25.008 --> 00:14:28.830\nhow even the feasibility of running\nout of IP addresses now is just gone.\n\n267\n00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:30.037\nIt's out the window.\n\n268\n00:14:30.037 --> 00:14:32.998\nSo, subnetting it's still there-\n>> Right.\n\n269\n00:14:32.998 --> 00:14:35.111\n>> But it's not really necessary.\n\n270\n00:14:35.111 --> 00:14:38.664\n>> Yeah, so hopefully you will never see\nthat where somebody says let's start\n\n271\n00:14:38.664 --> 00:14:39.950\nsubnetting this.\n\n272\n00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:40.810\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n273\n00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:41.840\nCan it be done, yes.\n\n274\n00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.830\nCan you learn it relatively easily?\n\n275\n00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:45.080\nBelieve it or not, you can.\n\n276\n00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:49.010\nOnce you actually get the hexadecimal\nmath down, it makes sense.\n\n277\n00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:50.570\nBut if you don't know that part.\n\n278\n00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:52.970\nWell then it doesn't make as much sense.\n\n279\n00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:54.990\nBut if you do want to learn more about it,\ngo ahead and\n\n280\n00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.570\ncheck out some of the other\nshows that we have as well.\n\n281\n00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:00.833\nSo IPv6 and\nIPv4 is actually covered in Network+ and\n\n282\n00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:06.020\nCompTIA A+ and, actually, just about every\nother show that we have on networking.\n\n283\n00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:09.180\nSome type of networking and\nIP addressing is covered, but\n\n284\n00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.020\nfor more details, do check that out.\n\n285\n00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.300\nAt least right here,\nthese are the fundamentals.\n\n286\n00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:15.400\nThese are the foundations that\nwill at least get us started and\n\n287\n00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.450\nthat's what we want here at the MTA level.\n\n288\n00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:20.710\n>> Yeah Ronnie, it can't be anymore\ndifficult than IPv4 subnetting it.\n\n289\n00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:23.110\nIt will drive a man to the bottle,\nthat is for sure.\n\n290\n00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:24.944\nBut once you get it down you feel\nlike you've accomplished something.\n\n291\n00:15:24.944 --> 00:15:26.442\nIt's gonna be the same with IPv6.\n\n292\n00:15:26.442 --> 00:15:28.528\nIf you do need to\nunderstand that subnetting,\n\n293\n00:15:28.528 --> 00:15:31.414\nyou're just gonna have to spend\na little time behind the wheel,\n\n294\n00:15:31.414 --> 00:15:35.450\nget used to it, figure out how it works\nand then implement it for your solution.\n\n295\n00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:38.130\nAll right Ronnie, is there anything else\nwe need to cover when it comes to IPv6?\n\n296\n00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:39.180\n>> Not really, right.\n\n297\n00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:41.260\nThe key here is not\nletting it frighten you.\n\n298\n00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:45.050\nSo everybody will, you do,\nyou hear a kind of mystical frightening\n\n299\n00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:48.370\neven when you get into the industry,\nlike man IPv6 is coming.\n\n300\n00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:49.440\nThat's tough.\n\n301\n00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.260\nWell, if you're learning it for\nthe first time, don't look at it that way.\n\n302\n00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:53.700\nYou're learning it for the first time.\n\n303\n00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.244\nLook at it as, okay,\nlet me just get used to this.\n\n304\n00:15:56.244 --> 00:15:58.566\nAnd once you do,\nit's not gonna be tough for you.\n\n305\n00:15:58.566 --> 00:16:00.454\nIt's not gonna be as tough for\nyou as it was for\n\n306\n00:16:00.454 --> 00:16:03.010\nme when I was like I really\ndon't want to learn this.\n\n307\n00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:04.410\nSo, if you're brand new at this,\n\n308\n00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:07.690\nthis is a great time because\nthis will be your foundation.\n\n309\n00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:09.880\nIt's not gonna be learning the old stuff.\n\n310\n00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.666\nThe old stuff may,\nactually after you learn this, you go,\n\n311\n00:16:12.666 --> 00:16:14.576\nwhy would anyone do anything like that?\n\n312\n00:16:14.576 --> 00:16:18.048\nAnd we're gonna say we don't know why\nanyone would do anything like IPv6.\n\n313\n00:16:18.048 --> 00:16:22.276\nSo it is all about perspective, but\nif you're doing this for the first time,\n\n314\n00:16:22.276 --> 00:16:26.568\ntake more time to make sure you understand\nthis even more than the IPv4 because\n\n315\n00:16:26.568 --> 00:16:29.978\nIPv4 will come naturally once\nyou actually get this as well.\n\n316\n00:16:29.978 --> 00:16:32.218\n>> Yeah this is the future.\n\n317\n00:16:32.218 --> 00:16:35.810\nSo if you get a nice IPv6 foundation laid.\n\n318\n00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:39.850\nAs it progresses in becoming the standard,\nyou're going to be set to go.\n\n319\n00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:41.890\nIt's gonna be nothing for you.\n\n320\n00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:44.880\nAll right, Ronnie, well thank you so\nmuch for those demonstrations as well.\n\n321\n00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.800\nAnd thank you, everyone, for watching.\n\n322\n00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.856\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n323\n00:16:48.856 --> 00:16:50.420\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrey.\n\n324\n00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:51.100\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n325\n00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.327\n>> And we'll see you next

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.490\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, here with me\ntoday is none other than Mr Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.570\nHow's it going today Ronnie?\n\n5\n00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.580\n>> It's going great today.\n\n6\n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.330\nToday we're looking at the MTA,\nthe Microsoft Technology Associate.\n\n7\n00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.836\nWe're talking about networking\nfundamentals, the exam 98-366.\n\n8\n00:00:28.836 --> 00:00:33.532\nSo if you are preparing for that exam you\nare in the right place as we continue on\n\n9\n00:00:33.532 --> 00:00:38.030\ntalking about just some of the basic\nfoundational networking concepts.\n\n10\n00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.500\nAnd that's what we want to get into today.\n\n11\n00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.600\nAnd specifically, this is actually one\nof the concepts that you're using and\n\n12\n00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.960\nI'm using even if you don't\nknow you're using it.\n\n13\n00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.788\nSo, you're probably a master at using\nthe concepts of name resolution,\n\n14\n00:00:50.788 --> 00:00:52.212\nthat's what we're talking about.\n\n15\n00:00:52.212 --> 00:00:53.837\n>> That's right, so thank you for\njoining us today, no.\n\n16\n00:00:53.837 --> 00:00:56.629\n[LAUGH] We're gonna give you\na little more than that.\n\n17\n00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.829\nThat's right, DNS,\nthe domain name resolution or\n\n18\n00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.230\nsystems as we like to do,\nis the topic of choice today.\n\n19\n00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.120\nAnd it's basically how we take our\ncomputer, and have it understand what\n\n20\n00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.190\nthe heck we're telling it to do when\nit comes to the Internet specifically.\n\n21\n00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.040\nAnd that's what we want to do,\nand that's why Ronnie said,\n\n22\n00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.030\nyou're probably using this technology.\n\n23\n00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.160\nAnd you don't even realize it because\nevery time you open a web browser and\n\n24\n00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.830\nyou type in www.something something\nsomething.com, well that is using DNS.\n\n25\n00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.950\nAnd you're thinking, well, okay, I get it,\n\n26\n00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.440\nI get to type in a name,\nthat's interesting, I guess.\n\n27\n00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.630\nIt is actually a little more\ninteresting than it sounds just on\n\n28\n00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:35.902\nthe surface of things.\n\n29\n00:01:35.902 --> 00:01:39.231\nBecause it's basically how we can interact\nwith a computer that doesn't really speak\n\n30\n00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:40.090\nour language.\n\n31\n00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.570\nIt's kind of the intermediary between\nthe two languages, English or\n\n32\n00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.100\nwhatever language you speak, and the\ncomputer language of numbers and bits and\n\n33\n00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.650\nbinary and all that other good stuff,\nright Ronnie?\n\n34\n00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.930\n>> There is no doubt.\nThat's a great description to think about.\n\n35\n00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.750\nRemember that when computers need to\nbe able to communicate with each other,\n\n36\n00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.060\nwell really what they need to have on\ntheir systems is fairly something simple\n\n37\n00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.510\nas a IP address.\n\n38\n00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.330\nWell computers can work with\nthe binary numbering, easily,\n\n39\n00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.110\nto them it is second nature to them.\n\n40\n00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.120\nJust like,\nlanguage is second nature to us.\n\n41\n00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.740\nBut the problem that we have is that\nthe computers really don't need to\n\n42\n00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.208\ncommunicate with each other.\n\n43\n00:02:13.208 --> 00:02:15.880\nWe're the ones that are using\nthe computers, the computers\n\n44\n00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.762\nthen need to actually connect to each\nother to get the information that we need,\n\n45\n00:02:18.762 --> 00:02:21.270\nand that's where the key comes in.\n\n46\n00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.610\nWhat we have the ability to\ndo is if we are someone that\n\n47\n00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.310\ncan actually memorize numbers.\n\n48\n00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.640\nIf we're like Daniel and he has that mind,\nthat still trap mind to memorize\n\n49\n00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.663\nevery single number that he\nsees at the drop of a hat,\n\n50\n00:02:33.663 --> 00:02:37.671\nwell, all we have to do is actually\nbe able to communicate like that.\n\n51\n00:02:37.671 --> 00:02:42.254\nDaniel can actually just say,\noh yes I'm connecting to 192.168.10.12.\n\n52\n00:02:42.254 --> 00:02:46.713\nOh no, I'm gonna connect to 172.31.254.73.\n\n53\n00:02:46.713 --> 00:02:48.837\nAnd he might be able to remember all that.\n\n54\n00:02:48.837 --> 00:02:52.978\nBut most of us, most of us mere humans,\nmere humans like me,\n\n55\n00:02:52.978 --> 00:02:56.640\nwe actually need something\neasier to do that.\n\n56\n00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.890\nAnd that is names.\n\n57\n00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.730\nSo, when we actually talk about the idea\nof names, computers don't care.\n\n58\n00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.690\nComputers care nothing about names.\n\n59\n00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.690\nNothing about any human\nreadable format that there is.\n\n60\n00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.710\nComputers can use IP addresses,\ncould care less about names.\n\n61\n00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.800\nHumans, though, we actually use names and\nuse those a lot easier.\n\n62\n00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.860\nNow if you're super human like Daniel,\nyou don't have to worry about that.\n\n63\n00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.970\nBut if you're like me,\n\n64\n00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.270\njust kind of regular old human self,\nnames are actually a lot easier.\n\n65\n00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.580\nAnd somebody actually taught me this cuz\nI was thinking, how do you get across\n\n66\n00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.330\nhow easy it is, and why this is actually\nsomething good for us to remember.\n\n67\n00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.770\nAnd somebody actually said this.\n\n68\n00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.050\nWell, Ronnie, think about it this way.\n\n69\n00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.800\nTell me the name of the very\nfirst girlfriend you had.\n\n70\n00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.610\nThat's fairly simple.\n\n71\n00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:38.360\nAnd I was able to do so.\n\n72\n00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.980\nAnd then they turn around and said, all\nright, tell me what her phone number is.\n\n73\n00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.050\nAnd all of a sudden I'm like,\nI don't have a clue.\n\n74\n00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.560\nI really don't have a clue\nwhat her phone number is now.\n\n75\n00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.940\nI really don't.\n\n76\n00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.830\nAnd so, when we think about that for\nnetworking and for\n\n77\n00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.710\nbeing able to connect computers together\nin a human way that makes it easy,\n\n78\n00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.950\nwell it's a lot easier for\nme to put a name to a device.\n\n79\n00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.250\nAnd even though it has a unique address,\n\n80\n00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.840\nsort of like a phone number I don't have\nto really remember that unique address\n\n81\n00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.600\nanymore if I can simply remember the name\nthat actually is attached to it.\n\n82\n00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.540\nNow of course, the way that this\nhappens is by voodoo magic.\n\n83\n00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.310\nNo it's not how it happens,\nthere is a system out there.\n\n84\n00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.350\nIn other words, there's a group of\ncomputers out there running software\n\n85\n00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.250\nthat says what we can do in the background\nof the way that networking ends up working\n\n86\n00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.030\nis that we can link that up.\n\n87\n00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.180\nWe can take whatever human readable\nname is given to some machine and\n\n88\n00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.410\nwe can make sure it links\nup to that IP address, so\n\n89\n00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:41.330\nthat when I do need to connect to that\nmachine on my network, I type in the name.\n\n90\n00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.380\nI can actually connect to it by the name.\n\n91\n00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.700\nAnd my machine will actually be able to\nlook it up, find the IP addresses and\n\n92\n00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.120\nmake that connection for me even though\nI don't know what the IP address is.\n\n93\n00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.200\nIt really does help.\n\n94\n00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.240\n>> Ronnie I'm disappointed.\n\n95\n00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.090\nI was hoping that you were getting ready\nto tell me you were a card-carrying member\n\n96\n00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.975\nof the IT guild of spell casters and\nconjurers.\n\n97\n00:04:58.975 --> 00:05:00.860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But unfortunately that is not the case.\n\n98\n00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.230\nYou are right.\nIt is not magic.\n\n99\n00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.361\nIt's actually computers.\n\n100\n00:05:03.361 --> 00:05:04.400\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's true.\n\n101\n00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.230\nI only have a 31-sided die\nthat I could have rolled, but-\n\n102\n00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.343\n>> You're no geek.\n\n103\n00:05:08.343 --> 00:05:09.287\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'm no geek at all.\n\n104\n00:05:09.287 --> 00:05:13.430\n[LAUGH] So when we think about that, no,\nthere is actually a system out there and\n\n105\n00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.350\nit's a system that we need to know\nat least a little bit of now.\n\n106\n00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.080\nWe talked about the fundamentals.\n\n107\n00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.760\nAnd what we're actually describing here,\nthere's no other way I can emphasize this.\n\n108\n00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:28.050\nToday we are merely just buffing\nthe surface of how deep.\n\n109\n00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.150\nI don't even wanna say\nscratching the surface.\n\n110\n00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.046\nI'm just gonna say [CROSSTALK]\n>> We're lightly grazing.\n\n111\n00:05:32.046 --> 00:05:33.421\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n112\n00:05:33.421 --> 00:05:36.655\nWe are.\nWe're just, we're buffing the surface of\n\n113\n00:05:36.655 --> 00:05:41.250\nwhat DNS really is about,\nthe Domain Name System really is about.\n\n114\n00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.370\nAnd also an older resolution\nwhich we'll be talking about,\n\n115\n00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.650\nthe one called WINS,\nWindows Internet Name Service, as well.\n\n116\n00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.720\nBut we are really buffing it.\n\n117\n00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.160\nWe're taking off that least little\nlayer just to make sure yes,\n\n118\n00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.560\nit looks nice and shiny.\n\n119\n00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.360\nBut we are getting kind of the gritty\ndetails of it at the same time.\n\n120\n00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.930\nAnd the reason why I say that is,\nthere is by far one of the deepest and\n\n121\n00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.700\none of the most complex\ntopics that you can get into\n\n122\n00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.590\nwhen it comes to networking is\nwhat we're talking about here.\n\n123\n00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.070\nAnd it is so foundational to everything\nthat we do, and it's gonna become so\n\n124\n00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.620\nmuch more important in the near future.\n\n125\n00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.450\nAs we really, as old technology\nstarts slipping into the past and\n\n126\n00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.460\nnew technology is coming in,\nit's going to become even more important.\n\n127\n00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.390\nWhat I'm mentioning there is\nthe sleeping of IPv4 addresses and\n\n128\n00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.670\nas we start moving into IPv6,\nDNS is going to become so\n\n129\n00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.340\nmuch more important because we're gonna\nrely on names because I don't want to\n\n130\n00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.740\nremember those IP addresses\never if I don't have to.\n\n131\n00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.970\nSo, it's a really important system for\nus to actually understand and know.\n\n132\n00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.000\nSo, let's take a look at my\nscreen here for a moment and\n\n133\n00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.132\nthen we'll kind of dive into it as well.\n\n134\n00:06:44.132 --> 00:06:48.970\nSo, just remember that the very basics\nof name resolution is fairly simple.\n\n135\n00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:52.140\nComputers don't need names, right?\n\n136\n00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.600\nThey can work off of IP addresses daily.\n\n137\n00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.727\nWell, you and I though, we're humans and\nnames seem to come a little bit easier\n\n138\n00:06:58.727 --> 00:07:01.947\nthan remembering every single\nIP address taht's out there.\n\n139\n00:07:01.947 --> 00:07:05.657\nSo if we have a way where we can\nactually combine them together so\n\n140\n00:07:05.657 --> 00:07:06.922\nthat I can use a name.\n\n141\n00:07:06.922 --> 00:07:11.337\nMy computer understands what I'm referring\nto and it can use its way of doing things,\n\n142\n00:07:11.337 --> 00:07:14.421\nthen that connection and\nnetworking becomes a lot easier.\n\n143\n00:07:14.421 --> 00:07:17.546\nSo what we're talking about\nreally it boils down to this.\n\n144\n00:07:17.546 --> 00:07:22.755\nThat I as a human really want to make\nsure that I can network by using names.\n\n145\n00:07:22.755 --> 00:07:26.046\nAnd that's really what it boils\ndown to in the very end to do this.\n\n146\n00:07:26.046 --> 00:07:31.463\nBut there is a complicated system out\nthere, that is out there on the Internet.\n\n147\n00:07:31.463 --> 00:07:35.289\nIt's within our own networks, and\neven happens within our own computers,\n\n148\n00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:37.930\nwhich actually accomplish this, too.\n\n149\n00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.110\nSo there's two different\nname resolution processes\n\n150\n00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:46.140\nthat we have really kind of used and\none is now kind of gone away.\n\n151\n00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:49.280\nAnd there's really only one left,\nwhich is the DNS here.\n\n152\n00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.235\nBut we do need to know a little bit about\nit, and we call it legacy learning, right?\n\n153\n00:07:52.235 --> 00:07:55.797\nSo, just like in any industry, there are\nsome things you just have to know about\n\n154\n00:07:55.797 --> 00:07:58.201\njust because, well,\neverybody else knew about it.\n\n155\n00:07:58.201 --> 00:08:01.255\nIt's initiation process\nis what it comes down to.\n\n156\n00:08:01.255 --> 00:08:04.828\nAnd the earlier name resolution\nsystem that we would have used,\n\n157\n00:08:04.828 --> 00:08:07.550\ninside of networking,\nis one that we call WINS.\n\n158\n00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:11.260\nAnd that stands for\nWindows Internet Naming Service.\n\n159\n00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.010\nHere, let me type that out.\n\n160\n00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:19.180\nWindows Internet Naming Service.\n\n161\n00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.890\nNow this type of naming\nservice was only good for\n\n162\n00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:26.110\ncomputers that you are on\nthe same physical network with.\n\n163\n00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.870\nAnd the reason why is that is if you\nuse a special type of messaging called\n\n164\n00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:29.930\nbroadcasting.\n\n165\n00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.150\nWhich meant it yelled it out, anybody\nthat was connected to that same network,\n\n166\n00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.690\nall those devices together.\n\n167\n00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:38.100\nThey would hear this system and\nthey would be able to use it.\n\n168\n00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.940\nBut this also made it limiting\nat the same time too.\n\n169\n00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:47.210\nIf you had two names that were duplicates,\nwell now you are also in trouble.\n\n170\n00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.300\nAnd that's because both devices\ncould respond back and so\n\n171\n00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.570\nyou might be able to send that out and\none device might get that data and\n\n172\n00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:56.730\nthe next bit of data, well the next\ndevice would actually get it.\n\n173\n00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:01.200\nSo this system did work for a long time,\nas long as we could remember that every\n\n174\n00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:06.070\nsingle device on a network had to have a\nvery unique, what we called host name, or\n\n175\n00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:07.200\nan LM host name.\n\n176\n00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.740\nThat's technically what it's\ncalled in the background.\n\n177\n00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:13.240\nSo when we had that, that's the way that\nit worked, and that was perfectly fine.\n\n178\n00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:17.010\nSo the resolution process\nwas fairly easy in that day.\n\n179\n00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:20.490\nAnd then as networks got bigger and bigger\nthey started introducing, of course,\n\n180\n00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:25.000\nthen servers, devices in the background\nthat could handle this name resolution by\n\n181\n00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.320\nhaving a management database to do so.\n\n182\n00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.900\nWell, that system, of course,\ngot superseded, or\n\n183\n00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.340\nsupplanted if you want to,\nby what we call DNS.\n\n184\n00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:37.380\nAnd this is really where\neverything actually happens and\n\n185\n00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.610\nit's what we call Domain Name System,\nokay.\n\n186\n00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:45.942\nThis system is the one that's actually\nnot only used within local area networks,\n\n187\n00:09:45.942 --> 00:09:49.795\nin other words my own network here at\nwork, but also out on the internet.\n\n188\n00:09:49.795 --> 00:09:54.676\nIf you browse to our website,\nto itpro.tv well you actually\n\n189\n00:09:54.676 --> 00:09:58.900\nended up using a DNS function,\nyour resolved name.\n\n190\n00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.620\nYour browser said,\nhere's a name that Ronnie is wanting.\n\n191\n00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:06.350\nAnd it was able at some point along the\nway to figure out that that name matched\n\n192\n00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:11.545\nup to the IP address of our\nserver right here at ITProTV.\n\n193\n00:10:11.545 --> 00:10:13.438\nAnd then it was able to\nreturn that to you and\n\n194\n00:10:13.438 --> 00:10:17.013\nwhat you saw in your address bar is not\nthe IP address but is actually, well what,\n\n195\n00:10:17.013 --> 00:10:19.485\nthe name that is actually\nconnected to you.\n\n196\n00:10:19.485 --> 00:10:20.775\nSo, that is what it uses.\n\n197\n00:10:20.775 --> 00:10:23.385\nNow, here when we talk about those names,\nI said LM host in,\n\n198\n00:10:23.385 --> 00:10:25.795\nit actually stands for NetBIOS name.\n\n199\n00:10:25.795 --> 00:10:27.955\nI don't know why I was thinking,\noh that's because the file.\n\n200\n00:10:27.955 --> 00:10:28.900\nThat's what I was thinking of.\n\n201\n00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:33.170\nSo it's actually NetBIOS is that\nnaming system that it used and\n\n202\n00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.810\nyou had a limitation of,\nI think 16 characters, or\n\n203\n00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:39.620\n15 characters, was the longest\nthat that name could end up being.\n\n204\n00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.930\nBut in DNS, though,\n\n205\n00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:47.040\nwe use a special type of name here instead\nand this is what it's called an FQDN.\n\n206\n00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:49.690\nI know that sounds fancy doesn't it?\n\n207\n00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:50.650\n>> Can I buy a vowel Vanna?\n\n208\n00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.690\n>> You cannot buy a vowel\nat this point no.\n\n209\n00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:59.525\nYou cannot, it stands for\nFully Qualified Domain.\n\n210\n00:10:59.525 --> 00:11:03.915\nThat's what I get for\nnot having my glasses, Domain Name and\n\n211\n00:11:03.915 --> 00:11:07.630\nthat means that there's\na hierarchy to this name.\n\n212\n00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:10.340\nNow you might be going like what in\nthe world are you talking about?\n\n213\n00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:15.260\nSo let's take, for an example, let's say\nthat you've never been to ITProTV before\n\n214\n00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:20.600\nand what you did is you typed in\nthe browser www.itpro.tv and you did that.\n\n215\n00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.300\nWell, a fully qualified domain name,\nthat's what's represented right here.\n\n216\n00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:29.410\nThere's a portion of that name that it\nrepresents the name of that server and\n\n217\n00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:32.060\nthen there's a portion of that\nname that represents my domain.\n\n218\n00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.010\nIn other words,\nthe a name space that I'm in charge of.\n\n219\n00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:40.830\nWell, www represents that name\nof that specific server, okay?\n\n220\n00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:46.340\nItpro.tv represents the namespace\nthat I'm in charge of and when\n\n221\n00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:51.670\nwe combine those two together this is what\nwe call a Fully Qualified Domain Name.\n\n222\n00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:55.590\nThere's systems out there on the Internet\nand inside of my own network\n\n223\n00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:59.230\nthat say what the IP address is\nactually gonna be linked to that name.\n\n224\n00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.575\nAnd so that's how it finds it.\n\n225\n00:12:01.575 --> 00:12:04.430\nThat if I type that in it can\nactually look up this name and\n\n226\n00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:06.960\nthen find the IP address that's connected.\n\n227\n00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.720\nSend that back to my computer and\nnow I can actually connect on through.\n\n228\n00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.620\nSo it's a fairly easy\nprocess in describing it.\n\n229\n00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:18.480\nNow, the problem that we have though,\nis when you take a look at the function,\n\n230\n00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.380\nhere is kind of the basic\nsystem that ends up happening.\n\n231\n00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:25.140\nSo every time you go and\nlook up something like itpro.tv, so\n\n232\n00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:29.600\nyou're at a computer over\nhere on the left hand side.\n\n233\n00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.490\nAnd the very beginning it's checking\nyour own computer system out\n\n234\n00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:36.200\nto see if you've ever connected before.\n\n235\n00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:40.650\nIf you have, there's a special area\ninside of RAM that keeps track of that.\n\n236\n00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:43.650\nAnd when you see something like that,\nor when the computer sees it,\n\n237\n00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:46.250\nit just says hey, I don't have to do\nanything else because I already have that\n\n238\n00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:50.220\nlink to that name, and\nI don't have to go any further than that.\n\n239\n00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:54.350\nBut if it does, if it says I don't see\nany listing on my own computer system\n\n240\n00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:57.700\nthat says you've ever\nconnected to itpro.tv,\n\n241\n00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:02.150\nthat's when it does what we call\nthis DNS query at this point.\n\n242\n00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:07.033\nNow, that essentially is saying, I need\nto find out how to resolve this name.\n\n243\n00:13:07.033 --> 00:13:11.160\nItpro.tv what is gonna\nbe its IP address and\n\n244\n00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.610\nwe then send that to well,\nwhatever our DNS server is.\n\n245\n00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:18.470\nNow, if you're actually saying, well,\nhow do I know what the DNS server is?\n\n246\n00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:19.730\nWell, if we go back to my machine,\n\n247\n00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:22.080\nlet me see if I can find\nthe right machine, there we go.\n\n248\n00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.440\nIf we go back to this\nmachine right here and\n\n249\n00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:32.530\nI do an ipconfig/all, and it scrolls down\na ton of material there, doesn't it?\n\n250\n00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:33.740\nReally fast.\n\n251\n00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.290\nLet me see if I can expand\nthat out a little bit more.\n\n252\n00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:41.410\nWell, I can use this information\nright here to be able to see that\n\n253\n00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:47.640\nmy computer is told what DNS\nserver that IP address to go to.\n\n254\n00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.990\nSo that's how my computer knows\nthat it's suppose to check\n\n255\n00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:53.660\nhere first before it goes anywhere else.\n\n256\n00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.900\nAnd so what happens then when it\nsends that query to this machine?\n\n257\n00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.650\nWell, what happens at that point.\n\n258\n00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:03.730\nIs that it will actually check and see\nif it has it in it's database there and\n\n259\n00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:07.370\nif it has it there then we're\nfine because it returns back and\n\n260\n00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:10.360\nsays here's the IP address,\nbut what if it doesn't?\n\n261\n00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.405\nWhat if it hasn't connected before?\n\n262\n00:14:12.405 --> 00:14:16.005\nIt continues to forward that\nonto another DNS server and\n\n263\n00:14:16.005 --> 00:14:18.805\nultimately it will find it out\nthere on the Internet somewhere.\n\n264\n00:14:18.805 --> 00:14:22.365\nSo there's a whole hierarchical\nsystem out on the Internet.\n\n265\n00:14:22.365 --> 00:14:25.245\nWe're not taking the process\nto break that all down.\n\n266\n00:14:25.245 --> 00:14:28.935\nBut at some point it's going to continue\nasking essentially different DNS servers\n\n267\n00:14:28.935 --> 00:14:30.845\nuntil it goes yeah I know where that is.\n\n268\n00:14:30.845 --> 00:14:32.860\nOkay, that's what ends up happening.\n\n269\n00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.390\nSo, it is gonna break it\ndown at some point and\n\n270\n00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:40.230\nif you think about that, it's not you and\nme having to demand it every single time.\n\n271\n00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:44.670\nI just simply typed it into my browser and\nsomewhere along that system,\n\n272\n00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:48.210\nsomewhere, somebody said I\ncan return that information.\n\n273\n00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:50.380\nSo, it actually knew how\nto get that information and\n\n274\n00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:54.380\nwhen it does, it's that authoritative\nDNS server and that's what they call it.\n\n275\n00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:56.402\nThe one that actually has the record for\nthat name.\n\n276\n00:14:56.402 --> 00:15:00.414\nIt is then going to send back what\nwe call that response and of course,\n\n277\n00:15:00.414 --> 00:15:04.216\nin my own network's DNS server,\nit will now cache a copy of that or\n\n278\n00:15:04.216 --> 00:15:08.321\nmake sure it has a record of that and\nthen forward a response back to me.\n\n279\n00:15:08.321 --> 00:15:10.295\nAnd then I can actually go ahead and\n\n280\n00:15:10.295 --> 00:15:13.984\nmake that connection to whatever\nmachine that we're going to.\n\n281\n00:15:13.984 --> 00:15:18.079\nSo it is an incredibly complex process but\nthe nice thing is for\n\n282\n00:15:18.079 --> 00:15:21.465\nthe end user okay it's as\nsimple as knowing the name\n\n283\n00:15:21.465 --> 00:15:26.300\nof the machine that you want to go to and\nthat's how easy it really can be.\n\n284\n00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.230\nIt's amazing.\n\n285\n00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:29.780\n>> Yeah.\nIt really kind of boils down to the idea\n\n286\n00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:33.300\nof hey, I'm trying to find this guy right,\n\n287\n00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.850\nwell I know a guy that knows that guy and\nif he doesn't know,\n\n288\n00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:40.419\nI know a guy that knows a guy that knows\na guy, that will know that guy, right?\n\n289\n00:15:40.419 --> 00:15:43.170\n[LAUGH] So\nit's kind of me having fun here, but\n\n290\n00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:45.550\nthat's basically what's\nhappening with DNS.\n\n291\n00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:50.225\nThere is a structure of DNS servers and\nif your media DNS server doesn't know it,\n\n292\n00:15:50.225 --> 00:15:52.922\nit goes to the guy that\nhe thinks might know it.\n\n293\n00:15:52.922 --> 00:15:57.262\nIf he doesn't know it, well he passes\nthe buck up the chain until you get to\n\n294\n00:15:57.262 --> 00:15:59.852\nthe main DNS server\nthat controls them all.\n\n295\n00:15:59.852 --> 00:16:04.712\nAnd he will know where that server\nis based off of its domain name\n\n296\n00:16:04.712 --> 00:16:09.590\nto IP address, and\nit'll return that back to the end user.\n\n297\n00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:12.470\nAnd like Ronnie said, me and you,\nwe're none the wiser, right?\n\n298\n00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:15.450\nI type in itpro.tv in my web browser, and\n\n299\n00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:17.890\nall that gobbledygook\nhappens in the background.\n\n300\n00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.700\nI don't have to worry about it,\nI just put that in my browser, and\n\n301\n00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.760\nI go to the page and\nI enjoy the content, and it's great.\n\n302\n00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:27.660\nWe do need to understand that a little\nbit as networking people, right?\n\n303\n00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.560\nWe wanna get into networking,\nnetwork administration.\n\n304\n00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:34.200\nSo we do,\neventually we will get down that road\n\n305\n00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:38.690\nas you progress in your networking\nunderstanding, but just for this exam,\n\n306\n00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:41.390\nspecifically, they just want\nyou to be aware, what is DNS?\n\n307\n00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:41.920\nWhat does it do?\n\n308\n00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:42.510\nHow's it work?\n\n309\n00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:43.920\nAnd if you keep that concept of,\n\n310\n00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:48.170\nI know a guy that knows a guy,\nwell that's fundamentally how\n\n311\n00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:52.920\nDNS works to get you back the right IP to\nthe name you've typed into your browser.\n\n312\n00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.670\nWell, what else do we need\nto know about DNS, Ronnie?\n\n313\n00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:57.420\n>> Well, right now the only\nthing that we really need to\n\n314\n00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.700\nmake sure that we understand right are\nsome of the commands that we need to know.\n\n315\n00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:04.840\nJust brief commands, first of all, of\ncourse to identify what the DNS server is\n\n316\n00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:08.110\nand then actually be able to see\nwhat these records look like.\n\n317\n00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:11.420\nSo there are a couple of commands that\nwe want to at least pay attention to.\n\n318\n00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:15.070\nSo on my machine, I went ahead and\nbrought up my command prompt for us so\n\n319\n00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:18.560\nthat we can see where in the world\nthis stuff ends up happening.\n\n320\n00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.160\nSo if I have never been to\nitpro.tv before on this machine,\n\n321\n00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.838\nwhich I don't know if I have or\nnot, but I can check this out.\n\n322\n00:17:25.838 --> 00:17:32.071\nSo there's a command I just used to bring\nup all that information called ipconfig,\n\n323\n00:17:32.071 --> 00:17:37.502\nbut there's another option in\nthe background that I can also type in IP,\n\n324\n00:17:37.502 --> 00:17:40.546\nmaybe, [LAUGH] ipconfig /displaydns.\n\n325\n00:17:40.546 --> 00:17:44.936\nAnd what that will do, is it will show me\nthe name of all the different devices that\n\n326\n00:17:44.936 --> 00:17:47.430\nI have tried to connect to by name.\n\n327\n00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:50.440\nSo you can see right here where it\nactually shows, like there it is,\n\n328\n00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:53.330\nthat msn, cuz that's the homepage,\nand I can scroll down here and\n\n329\n00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:54.280\nsee some of these other ones.\n\n330\n00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:58.430\nThere's some doubleclick ads, exactly\nwhat I needed on my machine, right?\n\n331\n00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:01.030\nThere's some other stuff that\nwe have available to us.\n\n332\n00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:03.390\nSo you can actually see all\nof that information, and\n\n333\n00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:07.520\nwhat we're looking for is really right,\nI'm trying to get back up to the top so\n\n334\n00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:10.080\nthat we can see kind of,\nsome of the ones that are here.\n\n335\n00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.910\nSo, notice that it says record name and\n\n336\n00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:16.460\nhere is that fully qualified domain name,\nand that's what I wanted us to get to.\n\n337\n00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:19.680\nSo, notice that there is that\nfully qualified domain name for\n\n338\n00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:25.150\nus, and it actually matches up to,\nwell, this IP address right here.\n\n339\n00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:29.160\nSo when we have that in my system,\nthat's when the machine doesn't have to go\n\n340\n00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.850\nany further,\nit can find what device that it's on.\n\n341\n00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:33.490\nNow, if you take a look at that,\n\n342\n00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:36.700\nI'm gonna also do something else here so\nthat we can make this a little bit easier.\n\n343\n00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.130\nI'm gonna do an IP config.\n\n344\n00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:40.979\nI'm gonna tell it to get rid\nof all this information.\n\n345\n00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.350\nOkay, so\nthat way if I do that same command again,\n\n346\n00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:49.380\nI'm just hitting my up arrow a couple of\ntimes, now I don't have anything in there.\n\n347\n00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:53.360\nSo if I go ahead and\nnow we connect now to this site which,\n\n348\n00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:59.670\nit actually brought it up by name,\nI just want to do ITpro maybe, ITpro.tv.\n\n349\n00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:02.510\nSo I add that in there and\nnow when it connects in,\n\n350\n00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:05.230\nremember what's happened is\nthe way that Daniel described it.\n\n351\n00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:07.350\nI haven't connected before,\nyou can see that on the machine,\n\n352\n00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:08.920\nit says I don't know where that is.\n\n353\n00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.810\nWell, what happened is that it went out\nand it found it, right, it either asked\n\n354\n00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:15.200\nmy DNS server, if it didn't know it,\nit went out and asked another one.\n\n355\n00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:19.930\nAnd now from this point on,\nthough, I don't have to ask again,\n\n356\n00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:23.610\nnow I can actually just do\nthe ipconfig displaydns.\n\n357\n00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:28.491\nWow, it actually brought tons of stuff\nback, Facebook and all this, but I should\n\n358\n00:19:28.491 --> 00:19:33.331\nsee an itpro.tv in here somewhere, if I\ncan find it, I may not be able to find it.\n\n359\n00:19:33.331 --> 00:19:40.899\n[CROSSTALK] I though we'd just have\nMNS and IPproTV, but here it is.\n\n360\n00:19:40.899 --> 00:19:42.943\nNotice that I had flushed\neverything out so\n\n361\n00:19:42.943 --> 00:19:47.143\nit actually pretended like it didn't see\nit before, and it didn't take long, right,\n\n362\n00:19:47.143 --> 00:19:50.400\na few milliseconds and\nthere we were, we're connected in.\n\n363\n00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.370\nFrom this point on,\nas long as I don't reboot my system,\n\n364\n00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:56.850\nit's gonna stay right here until it\nends up timing out at some point.\n\n365\n00:19:56.850 --> 00:20:01.640\nBut now you can actually see the actual\nIP addresses that it connects to, and so,\n\n366\n00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.390\neven though the names are actually\nright here, it doesn't,\n\n367\n00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:05.450\nthe computer doesn't need it.\n\n368\n00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:09.590\nThis is so that I can actually do that\nconnection and it actually brought it all\n\n369\n00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:13.690\nright back here in under a second or\nso that we can connect in.\n\n370\n00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:15.340\nSo, it really is an amazing system.\n\n371\n00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:18.130\nI don't know if it actually hit one or\ntwo servers or ten or\n\n372\n00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:22.790\nfifteen servers before it got it, but\nit was able to do it so incredibly.\n\n373\n00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:26.140\nSo here's one of those commands\nthat you'll actually also need\n\n374\n00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.640\nto be able to know.\n\n375\n00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:32.470\nNow the other one is, if you want to\nactually know if DNS is properly working,\n\n376\n00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:37.840\njust as a basic is what we call\nnslookup and if I wanted to find out,\n\n377\n00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:42.100\nI can type in itpro.tv here, and\n\n378\n00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:46.030\nthen it actually tells me,\ndid it actually come from my machine,\n\n379\n00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:48.438\nthis record, or\ndid it come from somewhere else?\n\n380\n00:20:48.438 --> 00:20:52.490\nWell, the non-authoritative\nanswer means hey,\n\n381\n00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:56.100\nthis information came from\none of these servers or\n\n382\n00:20:56.100 --> 00:21:00.720\nall three of these servers instead,\nit didn't really come from my machine.\n\n383\n00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.389\nSo, using just those two,\niponfig, displaydns,\n\n384\n00:21:04.389 --> 00:21:08.610\nipconfig,I did the flush DNS,\nbut DNS look up,\n\n385\n00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:12.470\nwe can actually do something like that\nwhere we can see if it's actually working.\n\n386\n00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:16.110\nSo if you can type in a name and\nit works, that's what's also happening.\n\n387\n00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:19.960\nThe other way that you can do this\nis simply by pinging a device.\n\n388\n00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.460\nSo if I know that there's another machine\non my network, say there's DCL1, and I\n\n389\n00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:29.770\nping it by name, notice what is happening\nhere, is that it is actually working.\n\n390\n00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:34.210\nIt took this name and\nthen it was able to link it all\n\n391\n00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:39.620\nthe way to this IP address here, so you\ncan also use something like ping to verify\n\n392\n00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:43.950\nthat your DNS is actually operational and\nworking perfectly as well.\n\n393\n00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:48.330\nSo there is a lot of good information,\nbut these are really the basics.\n\n394\n00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:52.715\nIf you can at least can tell what the name\nor what the IP address of your DNS server\n\n395\n00:21:52.715 --> 00:21:56.240\nis, and you can actually use those\ncommands to verify you have the proper\n\n396\n00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.810\nrecord there, as well as see it is\nfunctional, you really do have a good,\n\n397\n00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:04.780\nsolid foundation of some of the\ntroubleshooting tools and networking tools\n\n398\n00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:08.730\nthat we use, and then understanding the\nprocess of how that name resolution works.\n\n399\n00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:09.940\nIt's a great foundation.\n\n400\n00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.900\n>> Yeah, I really like the way that,\nyou showed us the ping, right?\n\n401\n00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:17.150\nThe ping utility's just a simple utility\nthat we use as network administrators\n\n402\n00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:21.380\nto check for connectivity, but it really\ndoes illustrate the point of DNS and\n\n403\n00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.740\nhow interwoven it is in our systems.\n\n404\n00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:29.430\nAnd it's only for the sheer reason\nthat we are limited as a species\n\n405\n00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:31.840\nin our ability to work with long numbers.\n\n406\n00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:36.450\nIt's very difficult for us, and\nbasically computers work with nothing but\n\n407\n00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:38.180\nlong numbers, they love long numbers.\n\n408\n00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.140\nIt's their favorite thing\nin the whole wide world, so\n\n409\n00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:41.880\nwe're like, we have this disconnect.\n\n410\n00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.090\nPing, like I said,\nis prime example of that.\n\n411\n00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:45.820\nRonnie said ping DC01, right?\n\n412\n00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:49.910\nIt said, okay, I'm going to run\na utility that is specific for\n\n413\n00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:53.460\na certain protocol, but\nI'm going to involve DNS to do it.\n\n414\n00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:55.280\nRight?\nGo into Microsoft, right?\n\n415\n00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:59.510\nMicrosoft has this large enterprise\nproduct called Active Directory.\n\n416\n00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:02.750\nYou can't even run Active Directory\nwithout DNS enabled,\n\n417\n00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:05.650\ninstalled and running,\nand it works together.\n\n418\n00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:08.340\nEverything works with DNS,\nI say everything,\n\n419\n00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:12.920\nmost things work with DNS because of the\nfact that our human limitation to deal and\n\n420\n00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:16.230\nremember certain numbers,\nespecially long strings of them, and\n\n421\n00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:19.040\nwithout DNS we would really\nbe having a tough time.\n\n422\n00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.339\nThe Internet would not\nbe what you see today,\n\n423\n00:23:21.339 --> 00:23:23.560\nnetworking would not\nbe what you see today.\n\n424\n00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:28.830\nSo it's a very good idea for us to figure\nout how to use DNS, when DNS is used,\n\n425\n00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:33.750\nwhen it's not used, when can we take\nadvantage of it, those kinds of things.\n\n426\n00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:37.780\nIt is a very, very handy system that\nis enabled on our computers, and\n\n427\n00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:38.910\nwe couldn't live without it,\ncould we, Ronnie?\n\n428\n00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:41.880\n>> No, there's no way in today's\nworld are you going to, nor\n\n429\n00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.380\nwould you want to, right?\n\n430\n00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:47.167\nIf you do happen to be able to, and that's\nactually a good thing as well, if you do\n\n431\n00:23:47.167 --> 00:23:51.014\nhappen to notice that you can't ping the\nname that you know that should exist, but\n\n432\n00:23:51.014 --> 00:23:54.801\nyou can ping its IP address, then you\nknow something's wrong with DNS as well.\n\n433\n00:23:54.801 --> 00:23:59.557\nSo it's kind of a neat converse of\nthings when you have that, right?\n\n434\n00:23:59.557 --> 00:24:02.409\nIf the system doesn't work with DNS,\nwell you've got to figure out why,\n\n435\n00:24:02.409 --> 00:24:05.880\nbecause there's somebody that's gonna say,\nhey, I can't connect anymore.\n\n436\n00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.060\nWell, it's probably gonna be because they\ncan't connect by name, but if they can\n\n437\n00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:12.830\nconnect by IP address, everything else\nis working, but name resolution isn't.\n\n438\n00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:15.220\nSo make sure you understand\nthose foundational concepts and\n\n439\n00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:17.015\nname resolutions is what\nwe're taking with this.\n\n440\n00:24:17.015 --> 00:24:18.880\n>> All right, everyone, excellent stuff.\n\n441\n00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.686\nRonnie, is there anything else about\nDNS that we need to share with these\n\n442\n00:24:21.686 --> 00:24:22.247\ngood people?\n\n443\n00:24:22.247 --> 00:24:26.331\n>> Just remember that this doesn't\nmake us a master in DNS by far.\n\n444\n00:24:26.331 --> 00:24:28.757\nThere is so\nmuch more that is actually involved and\n\n445\n00:24:28.757 --> 00:24:32.797\nwe just showed you a little bit of it, but\nif this peaks your interest, make sure you\n\n446\n00:24:32.797 --> 00:24:36.764\ntake advantage of the additional content\nthat we have in networking and the DNS.\n\n447\n00:24:36.764 --> 00:24:41.125\nI guarantee you, we have guys here that\nare masters at DNS, and they explode\n\n448\n00:24:41.125 --> 00:24:45.750\nthe topic to the nth degree, so take\nadvantage of that information as well.\n\n449\n00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:48.941\nBut here, like I said,\nwe're buffing the surface.\n\n450\n00:24:48.941 --> 00:24:52.843\nWe just got you a little bit of the gritty\ndetails, we didn't come close to doing\n\n451\n00:24:52.843 --> 00:24:56.695\nanything that would make us complete\nmasters here, so don't assume that.\n\n452\n00:24:56.695 --> 00:24:59.875\n>> Didn't even scratch the clear coat\neveryone, to be honest with you, but\n\n453\n00:24:59.875 --> 00:25:00.915\nit was great stuff though.\n\n454\n00:25:00.915 --> 00:25:02.835\nHopefully it's a good foundation for\nyou guys.\n\n455\n00:25:02.835 --> 00:25:04.395\nYou start understanding how DNS works,\n\n456\n00:25:04.395 --> 00:25:07.215\nwhy it's important, that's what we\nhope you get out of this episode.\n\n457\n00:25:07.215 --> 00:25:09.205\nThank you so much, Ronnie for\nall those demonstrations,\n\n458\n00:25:09.205 --> 00:25:13.000\nexplanations, always great stuff from Mr.\nRonnie Wong.\n\n459\n00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.730\nThat being said, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n460\n00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:18.280\nThanks for watching,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n461\n00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:18.970\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n462\n00:25:18.970

exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.145 --> 00:00:19.605\nI'm your host Daniel Lowry,\njoining me today here in the studio is Mr.\n\n5\n00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:20.415\nRonnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:20.415 --> 00:00:21.265\nHow's it going today Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:21.265 --> 00:00:25.135\n>> It is going great today, it's another\ngreat day for us to take a look at MTA,\n\n8\n00:00:25.135 --> 00:00:27.258\nthe Microsoft Technology Associate.\n\n9\n00:00:27.258 --> 00:00:31.130\nPreparing for that exam 98-366,\nNetworking Fundamentals.\n\n10\n00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.339\nSo that we actually\nare going to get ready for\n\n11\n00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:38.602\nwhat a lot of different things\non your networking career.\n\n12\n00:00:38.602 --> 00:00:40.890\nThis exam is actually one\nof those preparations.\n\n13\n00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.730\nIf you don't have any real background\nknowledge, we're gonna have to at least\n\n14\n00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.950\ngive you some of the fundamental\nknowledge that you need.\n\n15\n00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.960\nAnd today, we're taking a look\nat what networking services,\n\n16\n00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.160\nis what we're actually gonna dive into,\nand there are plenty of them.\n\n17\n00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.860\nBut we're really gonna focus\nin on a couple of them\n\n18\n00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.940\nthat are really essential stuff that\nwe just have to know at the beginning.\n\n19\n00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.030\nA lot of the other services of course,\nyou're gonna learn in your networking\n\n20\n00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.330\ncareer, but at least at this point\nwe're really just focusing in on two.\n\n21\n00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:05.915\n>> That's right.\n\n22\n00:01:05.915 --> 00:01:10.210\nWe got a couple of them that we need to\nget you schooled up on, ready to go with.\n\n23\n00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.820\nAnd specifically, we're gonna be\ntalking about, let's see here,\n\n24\n00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.250\nDHCP today and Remote Access services.\n\n25\n00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.138\nVery, very fundamental ideas,\nthings that we need to understand,\n\n26\n00:01:19.138 --> 00:01:23.223\ntwo of the probably the most\ncommonly used and important systems.\n\n27\n00:01:23.223 --> 00:01:25.250\nEspecially for you and I,\n\n28\n00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.290\nas there are because we're gonna\nbe network administrators.\n\n29\n00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.400\nThat's what we do as a business.\n\n30\n00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.060\nAnd these two services\nare going to help us immensely,\n\n31\n00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.110\nDHCP will save your life\nlike you never knew before.\n\n32\n00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.495\nAnd then remote access, well obviously\nthat technology speaks for itself.\n\n33\n00:01:40.495 --> 00:01:43.410\nAnd it's abilities for\nus as administrators, to be\n\n34\n00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.070\nas lazy as we possibly can be, and that's\nwhat it's all about in the end [LAUGH].\n\n35\n00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.924\nWe're kidding, we want you to be very\nstudious and good at your job [LAUGH].\n\n36\n00:01:50.924 --> 00:01:54.260\nSo where do we start with when\nit comes to DHCP, Ronnie?\n\n37\n00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.132\n>> Yeah, when we start taking a look at\nDHCP, we have to ask what it does and\n\n38\n00:01:58.132 --> 00:02:00.900\nwhat we're actually talking about, right?\n\n39\n00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.850\nSo we're going to be throwing a lot\nof acronyms at you during this\n\n40\n00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.660\nparticular series of shows\nthat you're gonna be watching.\n\n41\n00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.240\nDHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration\nProtocol, is what it stands for.\n\n42\n00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.340\nNow, if we break that down\nthe actual term, right?\n\n43\n00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.010\nDynamic Host Configuration.\n\n44\n00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.550\nWell, you have to actually think\nwhat that really means, right?\n\n45\n00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.650\nThe dynamic part means well,\nit will handle it.\n\n46\n00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.330\nIt will actually do things for\nus that you and\n\n47\n00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.240\nI don't have to manually set and\nwe don't need to.\n\n48\n00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.040\nAnd it's also about the host, the\nindividual computers within my network.\n\n49\n00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.000\nAnd making sure we get\ninformation on those,\n\n50\n00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.330\nthe configuration information on\nthose machines that we need to have.\n\n51\n00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.370\nSo those services right\nthere are really essential.\n\n52\n00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.720\nAnd the reason why we want\nto use a service like this\n\n53\n00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.380\nis because of the way that it does it,\nright?\n\n54\n00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.590\nSo if we take a step\nback from [INAUDIBLE], so\n\n55\n00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.620\neven though that's one of\nthe primary things that we need.\n\n56\n00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.030\nBecause what it really primarily does at\nleast at the beginning of the network,\n\n57\n00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.160\nis that it gives our\nmachines IP addresses.\n\n58\n00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.770\nAnd we know that we can't actually be on\na network without those IP addresses.\n\n59\n00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.680\nSo we need to have those IP addresses and\n\n60\n00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.340\nall the relevant information for\neach machine on our network.\n\n61\n00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.670\nAnd instead of me actually\nbeing able to do this,\n\n62\n00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.490\nI can turn it over to what\nwe call a network service.\n\n63\n00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.070\nThat will actually handle that for us, so\nthat brings us then to another kind of\n\n64\n00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.800\nsnake and\nwindy way of getting around to it.\n\n65\n00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.520\nYou may be saying, well,\nyou just mentioned DHCP as a service,\n\n66\n00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.690\nbut I don't even know what a service is.\n\n67\n00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.760\nSo what are we really talking about?\n\n68\n00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.780\nWell, this is where in networking\nyou come down to some unusual terms.\n\n69\n00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.090\nThat if you're unfamiliar with networking,\nit doesn't really make sense.\n\n70\n00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.960\nSo you understand what a workstation is or\na PC, right?\n\n71\n00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.515\nThat's an end user computer, so\nif people are working for you, and\n\n72\n00:03:44.515 --> 00:03:46.855\nyou actually have computers\nthat they work on, right?\n\n73\n00:03:46.855 --> 00:03:48.715\nThey may have word processing programs,\n\n74\n00:03:48.715 --> 00:03:51.695\nthey may have a bunch of different\nthings that they interact with daily.\n\n75\n00:03:51.695 --> 00:03:56.590\nUsually email, of course the browser and\nthen some access to some database.\n\n76\n00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:57.640\nWell, when they're doing that, right?\n\n77\n00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.320\nThey're sitting there at their machine and\nthey are interacting with that machine, so\n\n78\n00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.140\nthat they can get the work\ndone that they need to.\n\n79\n00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.770\nWell, then when they connect to another\nserver that's out there, let's take for\n\n80\n00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.972\nan example,\nemail server that's out there, right?\n\n81\n00:04:10.972 --> 00:04:15.220\nThere is not somebody sitting on\nanother computer saying oh look,\n\n82\n00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.880\na piece of email came in.\n\n83\n00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.060\nI'm gonna forward this one to oh,\nDaniel, let me forward that on Daniel.\n\n84\n00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.430\nAnother one comes in,\nI'm gonna forward this one onto oh,\n\n85\n00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.710\nit looks like it goes to Ronnie.\n\n86\n00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.600\nAnd actually distributing them\nlike the idea of the mail room,\n\n87\n00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.280\nit doesn't work like that.\n\n88\n00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.530\nSo I'm trying to get that point, so that\nyou understand that when we talk about\n\n89\n00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.840\nconnecting to a server such as\nan email service or even DHCP.\n\n90\n00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.440\nWhat's actually happening there is that\nsome software on another machine somewhere\n\n91\n00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.040\nhas been configured to\nhandle it dynamically.\n\n92\n00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.290\nIn other words, without you and\nI having to deal with it.\n\n93\n00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.540\nSo the difference then between a server\nand between a regular workstation, right?\n\n94\n00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.850\nIs not just the hardware differences\nwhere as the server's designed to\n\n95\n00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.700\ndo a lot of performance and to be on\n24 hours a day for seven days a week.\n\n96\n00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.500\nBut it's really about the way\nthat we interact with them.\n\n97\n00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.990\nA regular workstation, some human has\nto press buttons to make it work.\n\n98\n00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.180\nWhen we talk about a server,\nDaniel only has to go to that machine,\n\n99\n00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.726\nhe configures it one time.\n\n100\n00:05:14.726 --> 00:05:19.060\nOne time and make sure that it actually\nhands out what he wants to, or\n\n101\n00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.650\nworks the way that he wants to.\n\n102\n00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.090\nHe configures it to work with his network,\nhe does all of that.\n\n103\n00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.630\nBut Daniel, once you actually\nconfigure it, once you get it saying,\n\n104\n00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.750\nall right,\nI think it’s doing what it needs to.\n\n105\n00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.560\nDaniel, when do you have to\ntouch it again normally if\n\n106\n00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.920\neverything’s working perfectly?\n\n107\n00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.960\n>> Only if it breaks.\n\n108\n00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.130\n>> Yep.\n>> If it gets broken after I set something\n\n109\n00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.130\nup, it should be doing exactly\nwhat it is I've set it up to do.\n\n110\n00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.540\nAnd that's the whole purpose of servers,\nright?\n\n111\n00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.640\nI'm letting the server do my job for\n\n112\n00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.490\nme and all I need to do is configure\nthe service that's running on the server.\n\n113\n00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.100\nThat's part of our job, right,\nas a network administrator?\n\n114\n00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.630\nDHCP is going to definitely be under your\nscope of delegation, so you've gotta be\n\n115\n00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:57.870\nunderstanding okay, I've got DHCP,\nDynamic Host Configuration Protocol.\n\n116\n00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.000\nWhat is it doing for me?\n\n117\n00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.740\nOkay, well,\nit is automating some service for me,\n\n118\n00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.310\nwhich is basically\npassing out IP addresses.\n\n119\n00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.838\nSo that I don't have to go to each\ncomputer, sit down behind it and say,\n\n120\n00:06:08.838 --> 00:06:11.413\nyour IP is 192.168.1.12.\n\n121\n00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:15.063\nAnd your subnet mask is this,\nand your gateway is this, and\n\n122\n00:06:15.063 --> 00:06:16.670\nyour DNS is this and so on.\n\n123\n00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.120\nThat's a lot of work.\n\n124\n00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.806\nNow if I have five computers on a network\n[SOUND], it's a lot of work but\n\n125\n00:06:21.806 --> 00:06:22.833\nit's not too bad.\n\n126\n00:06:22.833 --> 00:06:25.359\nI've got 500 computers on my network,\n\n127\n00:06:25.359 --> 00:06:29.490\nwe start to see where I'm ready to\nturn in my resignation and say.\n\n128\n00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.290\nI think I'm gonna go to Truckmasters or\nsomething and do some other type of work.\n\n129\n00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.060\nThis is insanity.\n\n130\n00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.266\nI'm not gonna do this, I wouldn't\nput up with it, DHCP comes in and\n\n131\n00:06:38.266 --> 00:06:39.347\nrescues us from that.\n\n132\n00:06:39.347 --> 00:06:43.258\nAnd automates a part of our job that\nnormally we would spend a lot of time\n\n133\n00:06:43.258 --> 00:06:45.960\ntrying to figure out and keep operating.\n\n134\n00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.420\nIf you had to do it that way,\n\n135\n00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:53.690\nyou would have a dedicated probably\nteam of people just walking around.\n\n136\n00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.130\nTrying to make sure that all\nthe computers are configured correctly\n\n137\n00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.650\nwith their IP address, their subnet mask.\n\n138\n00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:04.110\nEverything that makes a computer talk\non a network is what DHCP does for us.\n\n139\n00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:08.870\nAnd we would be spending googobs amount\nof money and effort without DHCP.\n\n140\n00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.160\n>> There is no doubt that it really\ndoes help us out in that process,\n\n141\n00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.820\nthat all we really have to do is configure\nit and then it handles it for us.\n\n142\n00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:19.080\nAnd the way that it does it is,\nwell, not the manual way, right?\n\n143\n00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.650\nIf I had to do all the things\nthat have to be done so\n\n144\n00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.770\nthat a computer can\nconnect onto the network.\n\n145\n00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.220\nIt means that I have to manually go in and\nassign an IP address at least.\n\n146\n00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.150\nA subnet mask,\nas well as a default gateway.\n\n147\n00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.190\nAnd in today's networks,\nI'm gonna say that right.\n\n148\n00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.420\nIn today's networks also of course,\n\n149\n00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:40.060\na DNS server as well,\nto build a handle name resolution.\n\n150\n00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:44.944\nSo those are the four basic\npieces of information that\n\n151\n00:07:44.944 --> 00:07:47.448\na DHCP server can hand out.\n\n152\n00:07:47.448 --> 00:07:51.426\nNow, the way that it does is also\nimportant because this is where you see\n\n153\n00:07:51.426 --> 00:07:53.761\nthe automation process in what happens.\n\n154\n00:07:53.761 --> 00:07:57.862\nSo I've made a simple diagram to try and\nhelp us to understand What has to go on\n\n155\n00:07:57.862 --> 00:08:01.466\nbetween these different machines and\nthese servers here, okay.\n\n156\n00:08:01.466 --> 00:08:05.033\nSo when you are running some type of\nnetwork service in the background,\n\n157\n00:08:05.033 --> 00:08:07.660\nremember that the key is fairly simple.\n\n158\n00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.060\nSomebody configures it, right?\n\n159\n00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.760\nTo make it do what it's\nessentially designed to do.\n\n160\n00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.360\nAnd then from that point on, you and\nI would just leave it alone, and\n\n161\n00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.970\nwhen we connect to the network...\n\n162\n00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.650\nIt works the way it should.\n\n163\n00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:21.400\nAt least that's what we're\nsaying that it should happen.\n\n164\n00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.560\nSo, unless something goes wrong,\nwe are perfectly fine.\n\n165\n00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.710\nSo, normally when you take something like\nDHCP which is designed to be interactive.\n\n166\n00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:29.360\nRight?\n\n167\n00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.280\nIf you and I were having to do\n\n168\n00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.540\nthis we'd have to actually run between\nthese machines and get the information.\n\n169\n00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:37.730\nBut the way that DHCP works, is that\nonce you plug that one into the network\n\n170\n00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.970\nit begins to do what we\ncall listen on the network.\n\n171\n00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:46.160\nAnd that means it is actually now\nready to respond to some type of call,\n\n172\n00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.000\nsome time of request on the network.\n\n173\n00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.770\nSo when you plug another computer in on\nthat network and you tell it that what\n\n174\n00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:57.830\nit's supposed to do, right, is you want\nit to connect and get that information.\n\n175\n00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:01.770\nWell, it actually is looking now for\nthat DHCP server.\n\n176\n00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:05.760\nSo on each machine you have that\nconfiguration going on to do so.\n\n177\n00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:06.860\nSo what does that look like?\n\n178\n00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:10.110\nLet's go ahead and take a look before\nwe get into this process here.\n\n179\n00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:13.086\nSo over on, let me see if I can actually\nget to the right machine, there we go.\n\n180\n00:09:13.086 --> 00:09:20.510\nOver on, let me click off of this thing\nhere, over on this machine right here.\n\n181\n00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:25.150\nWhat has to happen is that if this is\nmy client a, which it actually is,\n\n182\n00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:30.740\nlet me get into the control panel,\nand then in Network and Internet.\n\n183\n00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.220\nNetwork and Sharing Center.\n\n184\n00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.790\nAnd then Ethernet0.\n\n185\n00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:40.420\nI go to Properties, and\n\n186\n00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:45.480\nthen I select IP Version 4, Internet\nProtocol Version 4, and Properties.\n\n187\n00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.890\nHere is what we are normally\nlooking at for DHCP.\n\n188\n00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:52.430\nOn this side of it,\nyou're looking for this in Windows.\n\n189\n00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:54.850\nObtain an IP address automatically.\n\n190\n00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:59.680\nEssentially this translates into try and\nconnect to a DHCP server.\n\n191\n00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.430\nI know it just says obtain\nan IP address automatically.\n\n192\n00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:04.360\nBut that's what DHCP server does for us.\n\n193\n00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.670\nIt says, I hand out IP addresses and\nnow I have a machine that says what?\n\n194\n00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:11.180\nObtain one automatically.\n\n195\n00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:15.120\nSo this machine is gonna begin\nto communicate on the network.\n\n196\n00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.740\nAnd what it's going to end up connecting\nto is another machine that's out there\n\n197\n00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.680\nthat is ready to respond.\n\n198\n00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.470\nSo on this machine it is\nactually running that service and\n\n199\n00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:28.790\nit is actually ready to respond for\na request.\n\n200\n00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:32.550\nSo when we go back over here\nto this diagram, right?\n\n201\n00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:36.420\nWhat we actually end up seeing is that\nthat obtain an IP address automatically\n\n202\n00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:40.160\nwill begin to send out what we\ncall a DHCP discover message.\n\n203\n00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.100\nThat discover message is saying I\nneed some DHCP server to answer me,\n\n204\n00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.390\nbecause I need an IP address.\n\n205\n00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:49.480\nNormally the very first\nDHCP server it comes to,\n\n206\n00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.970\nremember, the first one that actually\nreplies Is the one that wins.\n\n207\n00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.250\nSo if you have multiple DHCP servers,\n\n208\n00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:58.460\nit's gonna be the first one\nthat replies with an offer.\n\n209\n00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.850\nNow what is that offer about?\n\n210\n00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:04.550\nIt's telling it, hey look, I have the\ninformation that you're looking for and\n\n211\n00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:07.510\nhere's actually what is offered to you.\n\n212\n00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:09.680\nAnd then if the client will\nactually receive it, and\n\n213\n00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:13.090\nit normally does What it will\ndo is actually make a request.\n\n214\n00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:17.090\nThe request is really not requesting\nthat it actually get the information,\n\n215\n00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:19.010\nit's saying, I accept it,\n\n216\n00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:23.320\nI want to request that you don't hand\nthis out to anybody else at this point.\n\n217\n00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.230\nSo please do make sure you mark that down,\ndon't assign this IP address for\n\n218\n00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:28.820\nthis point as well.\n\n219\n00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.100\nAnd then, the DSTP server will\nsend back an acknowledgement, and\n\n220\n00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.180\nthat way everything will be good.\n\n221\n00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:37.570\nAnd the reason why this is important\nis because of what it does, right?\n\n222\n00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:39.200\nIs that it has to do it dynamically, so\n\n223\n00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.760\nit actually exchanges these\npieces of information here.\n\n224\n00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.980\nAnd the easiest way to remember this\nis that it's a DORA process, right?\n\n225\n00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.010\nD-O-R-A.\n\n226\n00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:51.300\nThe Discover, Offer,\nRequest and Acknowledgement.\n\n227\n00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.970\nIs what we're actually\nintending it to do here.\n\n228\n00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:56.740\nSo, in this dynamic interchange,\n\n229\n00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:01.530\nright, this is where my machine\nends up getting an offer from that\n\n230\n00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:05.535\nDHCP server that's running and\nthen we are off and ready to go.\n\n231\n00:12:05.535 --> 00:12:10.065\nWe don't have to send somebody up to\nassign an IP address to that machine,\n\n232\n00:12:10.065 --> 00:12:11.955\nit can actually do it for us.\n\n233\n00:12:11.955 --> 00:12:16.555\nWell, that neat thing is, we can see\nthat process happen a little bit here.\n\n234\n00:12:16.555 --> 00:12:20.625\nIf the DHCP server is working fine,\nwe actually see some information\n\n235\n00:12:20.625 --> 00:12:23.785\nvalidated for us on that machine and\nwe can take a look at.\n\n236\n00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:26.850\nIf it's not working we'll actually\nsee some other things as well.\n\n237\n00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:29.640\nSo let's go ahead and take a look\nat that process just for a moment,\n\n238\n00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.050\nlet me get back over here to this machine,\nand\n\n239\n00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:34.290\nI connect it into another machine just so\nthat we could see that.\n\n240\n00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:38.570\nBut let me do this for right now and\ndisconnect there, try and do that.\n\n241\n00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:43.600\nAll right, so here it is on this\nparticular machine, what am I looking for?\n\n242\n00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.940\nLet's go ahead and use the command prompt.\n\n243\n00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:50.480\nWe can do it right here under the details\non that status that we're looking at.\n\n244\n00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.450\nAnd we could see it, but\nit looks a little bit small, so\n\n245\n00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:56.000\nI'm gonna use the command\nprompt to help us out instead.\n\n246\n00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.218\nAnd I'm gonna run one of\nmy favorite commands again.\n\n247\n00:12:58.218 --> 00:13:05.460\nHere, ipconfig all.\n\n248\n00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.680\nSo with an all option.\n\n249\n00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:12.032\nAnd I'm looking for the one that says of\ncourse, the ethernet adapter zero, and\n\n250\n00:13:12.032 --> 00:13:14.784\nit's all the information\ndirectly listed under,\n\n251\n00:13:14.784 --> 00:13:17.739\nin this section that I'm\nreally paying attention to.\n\n252\n00:13:21.014 --> 00:13:24.901\nNow when I take a look at that section\nof information, a couple of things that\n\n253\n00:13:24.901 --> 00:13:29.440\nreally do point out whether or not my\nmachine is actually running the DHCP.\n\n254\n00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:34.260\nFirst is this option right here,\nwhere it says DHCP Enabled and\n\n255\n00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.040\nyou see the term Yes.\n\n256\n00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:40.220\nSo, that means that this machine is\nready to actually be able to use DHCP.\n\n257\n00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.350\nYeah, if it says no, well,\nthen you kinda know, yeah.\n\n258\n00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:45.240\n>> This is enabled by default,\nright Ronnie?\n\n259\n00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.380\n>> It is enabled by default.\n\n260\n00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:47.320\n>> Thank you, Microsoft.\n\n261\n00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.740\n>> Yes, that is key, right?\n\n262\n00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:53.120\nSo, you might be wondering,\nwhy would we ever use static IP addresses?\n\n263\n00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.330\nIf you need for that machine to\nactually do something like a service,\n\n264\n00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:57.740\nthen keeping it as a static is good.\n\n265\n00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:01.060\nBut machines on my network\nsuch as workstations,\n\n266\n00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:04.140\nit really doesn't matter what their IP\naddress is as long as they have one.\n\n267\n00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.780\nSo, if you're actually doing DHCP and\n\n268\n00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:08.410\nyou don't care what the IP address is,\nthat's really where it comes in.\n\n269\n00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:12.990\nAnd if you do need to worry about it,\nyou also would set it to static as well.\n\n270\n00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:17.100\nNow the other thing that you can\nalso see if DHCP is also working,\n\n271\n00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.830\nis if you get what you call a lease.\n\n272\n00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:24.220\nNow if we would have to manually\nassign these IP addresses,\n\n273\n00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:27.060\ninstead of using that obtain\nan address automatically, we actually\n\n274\n00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:30.695\nselect the other one that says assign\nthe address right down underneath that.\n\n275\n00:14:30.695 --> 00:14:32.580\nWell that means I am typing it all in.\n\n276\n00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:37.280\nAnd when I'm typing it in, that address\nis going to stay on that machine\n\n277\n00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.810\nforever until I go ahead and remove it.\n\n278\n00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:45.080\nBut with DHTP though notice that\nwe can lease this address for\n\n279\n00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.320\na number of days here.\n\n280\n00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:51.170\nFor this one is configured to be eight\ndays, which is the one that's done by\n\n281\n00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:55.320\ndefault inside of Microsoft is normally\nwhat we see as eight days here.\n\n282\n00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.660\nNow the reason why this is important,\n\n283\n00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.840\nis if there's a limited number\nof IP addresses being handed\n\n284\n00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.880\nout on your network, there may be\ntimes that this machine is off.\n\n285\n00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:08.370\nOr is taken out of our building because\nsomebody's actually out on the road for my\n\n286\n00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:12.290\ncompany and they're on the laptop, and now\nthey're actually not on my company again.\n\n287\n00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:15.780\nWell that address is not so important\nto the guy that's left the building,\n\n288\n00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:18.510\nthis is actually important\ninside of my network.\n\n289\n00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:21.475\nSo what we can do instead is\njust lease these addresses.\n\n290\n00:15:21.475 --> 00:15:25.870\nSo now if I remove this machine and\nanother machine comes online inside of\n\n291\n00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:30.020\nthat network and we need an IP address,\nwe can simply reuse that IP address.\n\n292\n00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:34.020\nIf I do it as static, well I take that\naddress, it doesn't mean that somebody\n\n293\n00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:37.690\ncan't come inside of mine, but, you know,\nthat machine comes back on the network.\n\n294\n00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:41.090\nYou now have duplicate addresses and\nthat can cause some havoc\n\n295\n00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:43.920\ninside of a network when you\ndo have duplicate addresses.\n\n296\n00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.165\nSo you don't want to end\nup with anything like that.\n\n297\n00:15:46.165 --> 00:15:47.648\nSo, just by looking at it,\n\n298\n00:15:47.648 --> 00:15:51.717\nthis is stuff you can use to verify\nthat you actually have the information.\n\n299\n00:15:51.717 --> 00:15:56.131\nThe other things that really help\nyou out here too at the same time\n\n300\n00:15:56.131 --> 00:15:58.190\nare the simple things.\n\n301\n00:15:58.190 --> 00:15:59.740\nIf DHCP is configured,\n\n302\n00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:04.440\nmore than likely it's configured to hand\nout an IP address and a subnet mask.\n\n303\n00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.615\nSo if you see those and\n\n304\n00:16:05.615 --> 00:16:09.785\nyou didn't have to type them in, that's\na good indication that DHCP is being used\n\n305\n00:16:09.785 --> 00:16:14.665\nas well as a lot of this other information\nthat you also see right here, too.\n\n306\n00:16:14.665 --> 00:16:16.825\nSo when you take a look\nat this information and\n\n307\n00:16:16.825 --> 00:16:22.805\nyou start seeing the IP addresses for\nthe DHCP server itself, the DNS server and\n\n308\n00:16:22.805 --> 00:16:28.460\nstuff, more than likely that means that\nDHCP is working fine on this side.\n\n309\n00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:31.080\nSo if you do set this up though and\n\n310\n00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.840\nthings are not working, you'll see\nsomething a little bit different.\n\n311\n00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:37.170\nSo what I'm going to do is\nI'm going to actually disable\n\n312\n00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:41.450\nthe DHCP from working here and\nwe'll see what ends up happening to it.\n\n313\n00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:42.370\n>> You're a mad man, Ronnie.\n\n314\n00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:42.920\n>> Oh, I know.\n\n315\n00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it's a little bit confusing.\n\n316\n00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:48.640\nAnd we'll come back and we'll talk\nabout how we do this in just a moment.\n\n317\n00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:53.090\nBut let me just go ahead and get access\nto it and that will actually make us.\n\n318\n00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:54.490\nSo what am I gonna do?\n\n319\n00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:57.420\nI'm gonna break the DHCP server,\nis what I'm gonna do.\n\n320\n00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:01.230\nYou don't have to know how to do this, but\nI just want you to see what happens, and\n\n321\n00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:04.840\nwhat the result of that becomes.\n\n322\n00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:09.518\nSo I'm gonna break this by\ndeactivating the scope fairly easily,\n\n323\n00:17:09.518 --> 00:17:13.955\nI'm gonna minimize that for\na moment, and now DHCP is broken.\n\n324\n00:17:13.955 --> 00:17:18.060\nSo usually, a lot of times, once you\nactually have something like that, if I do\n\n325\n00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:22.503\nan ipconfig /release, telling it to let go\nof my address, which is perfectly fine.\n\n326\n00:17:22.503 --> 00:17:26.087\nAnd now I just do\nan ipconfig a lot of times,\n\n327\n00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:29.190\noh I need to do a /renew, excuse me.\n\n328\n00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:32.400\nIt takes a moment and so, let me see,\n\n329\n00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.190\nno operation can be performed\non Bluetooth connection.\n\n330\n00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:36.420\nThat's perfectly fine.\n\n331\n00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:39.560\nSo we'll just give it a moment here and\nsee if it actually renews.\n\n332\n00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.240\nBut what am I telling it to do?\n\n333\n00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:45.260\nI'm telling it to run through\nthis DORA process right now.\n\n334\n00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.630\nSo instead of it doing it after the lease\nis over, I'm really telling it hey,\n\n335\n00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:51.390\ngo ahead and do this right here.\n\n336\n00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:53.940\nAnd now see what ends up happening.\n\n337\n00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.260\nSo what should happen after a moment,\nif it's not gonna do it here,\n\n338\n00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.430\nthe other thing that I can do is just\ndisconnect this network cable and\n\n339\n00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:01.700\nthen connect it back in a moment.\n\n340\n00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.450\nIt looks like it's locked it up here.\n\n341\n00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:06.470\nWe'll just give it a moment\nin time to do that.\n\n342\n00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.500\nAnd let me check if I can\nsee it through here yet.\n\n343\n00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:10.930\nAnd there we go, okay?\n\n344\n00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:12.730\nSo what you're seeing is right here.\n\n345\n00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:18.110\nAnd this is a little bit small until my\ncommand prompt here finally releases or\n\n346\n00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:18.900\nI can get rid of.\n\n347\n00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.010\nLet's see, I can do that.\n\n348\n00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:22.140\nNow I can do an ipconfig.\n\n349\n00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:23.940\nAnd that's what I'm looking for.\n\n350\n00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:28.448\nIf you do have those same options\nchecked that you are trying to use DHCP.\n\n351\n00:18:28.448 --> 00:18:32.510\nBut the DHCP server may not be functioning\nor my computer is not connecting that\n\n352\n00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:38.420\nnetwork, notice that machine, notice\nthat it will end up with this address,\n\n353\n00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:43.640\nwhich is the 169.254 address,\nwhich isn't APIPA address.\n\n354\n00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:48.460\nAnd this is a self assigned IP\naddress inside of my network adapter.\n\n355\n00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:53.400\nAnd the way that that happens there,\nis if I go back to this status here,\n\n356\n00:18:53.400 --> 00:19:00.748\nit's on the same place where I was,\nI click on Ethernet0 > Properties\n\n357\n00:19:00.748 --> 00:19:07.000\n> IP Version 4 > Properties >\nAlternate Configuration Tab.\n\n358\n00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.350\nIf I have this checked, and normally you\ndo, this is the one that's set by default.\n\n359\n00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:15.900\nThat is when you will end up with\nthat 169.254 address which means\n\n360\n00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.910\nthat it's not working\nthe way that it needs to.\n\n361\n00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:23.939\nSo then, now that we've\nactually got that disconnect,\n\n362\n00:19:23.939 --> 00:19:28.870\nif I go back and re-enable or\nactivate that scope.\n\n363\n00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:30.820\nHopefully, everything\nis now activated here.\n\n364\n00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:36.880\nAnd now, if I do that and\njust take a moment of time here,\n\n365\n00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.130\nwhat I can do is actually manually\ngo ahead and do the same thing.\n\n366\n00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:43.248\nSo I'm telling it, hey,\nI need to reset this thing again.\n\n367\n00:19:43.248 --> 00:19:45.430\nLet's see if it's actually done it for\nme automatically.\n\n368\n00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:46.490\nIt still hasn't.\n\n369\n00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:50.175\nIf I go back in and\ndo my ipconfig /release.\n\n370\n00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:55.920\nAnd then I do an ipconfig /renew,\nit will start the same process again.\n\n371\n00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.960\nManually telling it, hey, go on and\ntry and retrieve a new lease again.\n\n372\n00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.560\nSo, that's what it should end up doing.\n\n373\n00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.310\nOh, actually looks like it run through.\n\n374\n00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.990\nIt did something.\n\n375\n00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:06.020\nOh, there it goes.\n\n376\n00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:08.850\nI was just expecting it to\nkinda hang there for a moment.\n\n377\n00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:14.330\nAnd you can see that now it did get\nthe same information back, and so\n\n378\n00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:18.390\nyou do have that ability to see just some\nof the information come back in from DHCP.\n\n379\n00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:21.020\n>> Yes, thank you so much, DHCP service.\n\n380\n00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:24.750\nThat's exactly why we employ that\nservice because, think about it.\n\n381\n00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:27.440\nIf you had to go in, and\nwe saw the configuration area.\n\n382\n00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.350\nYou have to go in, you need to know the IP\naddress, one that no one else is using\n\n383\n00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:34.780\nbecause conflicts will arise if\nyou try to use the same thing.\n\n384\n00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:36.270\nAnd then you've got to\nknow the subnet mask.\n\n385\n00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:37.790\nYou have to know the gateway.\n\n386\n00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:39.460\nYou have to know DNS servers.\n\n387\n00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:42.430\nYou have to know all that stuff by heart\nor have it written down on some sort of\n\n388\n00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:45.080\ndocumentation and\nthen manually configure it.\n\n389\n00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.760\nRonnie is showing you how easy it is.\n\n390\n00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:50.140\nAll he did was configure a scope and\nyou don't even have to see that part.\n\n391\n00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.940\nBut we saw that it was there and\nonce he enabled it and\n\n392\n00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:58.010\nset this guy to DHCP to obtain\nthe IP address automatically.\n\n393\n00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:01.150\nBada bing, it grabs that information and\nI didn't have to do anything but\n\n394\n00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:04.960\nenable that scope one time and\nthen it was off to the races.\n\n395\n00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.460\nEverything was the way it should be and\n\n396\n00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:10.415\nthis computer is back on his network,\ntalking and communicating like a champion.\n\n397\n00:21:10.415 --> 00:21:13.150\n>> Yeah,\nthis is really why we use services,\n\n398\n00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:17.330\nnetwork services is because it\nmakes it automated first, right?\n\n399\n00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:20.430\nIt makes a lot less work for\nme, at the same time,\n\n400\n00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:23.410\nif we actually only have to configure it\none time, it means, I don't have to worry\n\n401\n00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:28.360\nabout did I actually mistype something\non 50 machines out of 500 out there.\n\n402\n00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:32.520\nWhen it can actually do it\nevery day the same exact way.\n\n403\n00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.730\nAnd if I do need to monitor,\nI can go on that machine and\n\n404\n00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:37.710\nmonitor the logs on those services,\nas well.\n\n405\n00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:41.670\nSo this is only one of a lot of\ndifferent services that you can\n\n406\n00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:43.700\nrun into in your networking career.\n\n407\n00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:47.050\nBut this particular service is\none very the very first ones\n\n408\n00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:48.510\nthat we tend actually look at.\n\n409\n00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:51.730\nBecause it's so essential that\nvery single machine on my network\n\n410\n00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:54.870\nget that IP address so\nit can communicate using the network.\n\n411\n00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:58.297\nIf you can't do that, all the other\nservices really do break down, so\n\n412\n00:21:58.297 --> 00:22:00.752\nthat's why it's very foundational here for\nus.\n\n413\n00:22:00.752 --> 00:22:01.681\n>> Yeah, you know Ronnie,\n\n414\n00:22:01.681 --> 00:22:03.991\nthis computer automated services\nthing just might catch on.\n\n415\n00:22:03.991 --> 00:22:06.757\n[LAUGH]\n>> Hey, maybe, like I said,\n\n416\n00:22:06.757 --> 00:22:07.695\nit's happening.\n\n417\n00:22:07.695 --> 00:22:08.728\n>> Maybe it's a fad.\n\n418\n00:22:08.728 --> 00:22:11.187\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it's possible it's a fad, but\n\n419\n00:22:11.187 --> 00:22:14.222\nit's possible that it's gonna be here\nto stay and I would err on that side,\n\n420\n00:22:14.222 --> 00:22:15.301\nmore than anything else.\n\n421\n00:22:15.301 --> 00:22:17.460\n>> I would, too.\n\n422\n00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:21.720\nAll right now, Ronnie, we also wanna\ntalk about remote access, as well.\n\n423\n00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:25.505\nNow, I would notice that while you\nwere jumping into your server there,\n\n424\n00:22:25.505 --> 00:22:28.002\nyou were actually on\na Windows 8.1 machine.\n\n425\n00:22:28.002 --> 00:22:32.202\n8.1 is [INAUDIBLE], not that you can't run\nservices from a desktop operating system,\n\n426\n00:22:32.202 --> 00:22:34.950\nyou can, but\nthat's not really what it's intended for.\n\n427\n00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:40.750\nRonnie was actually logging into\na Windows Server from his desktop.\n\n428\n00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:43.700\nThat's really what we're talking about\nwhen we come to remote access, right?\n\n429\n00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:44.960\n>> There's no doubt about it.\n\n430\n00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.280\nOne of the neatest things\nthat I ever do in networking\n\n431\n00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:52.570\nis that I don't have to go to every single\nmachine so that I can work with it.\n\n432\n00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:53.950\nIf our network is set up,\n\n433\n00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:58.720\nwhat we can do instead is we can\nenable what we call remote access.\n\n434\n00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.780\nAnd that means from any\ncomputer on my network, and\n\n435\n00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:04.570\nactually even across the world if\nI wanted to, I can go ahead and\n\n436\n00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:09.610\nsay, from that machine I need to\ngain access to that machine instead.\n\n437\n00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:12.700\nAnd I simply use an application to do so.\n\n438\n00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.350\nSo if we actually have\nnetworking turned on and\n\n439\n00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:19.520\nthose networking services are working,\nthat's something that we can do.\n\n440\n00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:23.560\nAnd I guarantee you, just about a year or\ntwo ago, this was something I had to do,\n\n441\n00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:27.620\njust about every single day of my life,\nwas to go in there and\n\n442\n00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:30.670\nconfigure that when I was doing\nsome network administration.\n\n443\n00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:32.880\nWhere as,\nif you were troubleshooting a problem,\n\n444\n00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.720\nI didn't wanna go into that server closet\nthat was so loud and hook up a monitor and\n\n445\n00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.940\na keyboard and have my eardrums burst.\n\n446\n00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.260\nWhen I walk down the hallway and\npeople go, how's it going?\n\n447\n00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:41.981\nWell, I don't know.\n\n448\n00:23:41.981 --> 00:23:44.203\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I didn't wanna yell at them like that.\n\n449\n00:23:44.203 --> 00:23:48.418\nSo it was actually a lot easier instead\nis that I can sit down at my desk And\n\n450\n00:23:48.418 --> 00:23:51.930\nall I need to do is launch\nan application that will allow me to\n\n451\n00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:56.310\nmake those connections and\nthat'll actually make that happen.\n\n452\n00:23:56.310 --> 00:24:00.810\nSo, let me show you how to do that as\nfar as making the connection goes, and\n\n453\n00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:02.850\nthis will actually make it a lot easier.\n\n454\n00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:07.390\nSo one of the first things that we do,\nI'm gonna find my Server 2008 machine and\n\n455\n00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:10.660\nwe'll establish a connection\nusing this machine as well.\n\n456\n00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:14.250\nSo let's say that we do have a server on\nour network and we need to go ahead and\n\n457\n00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:15.530\naccess this.\n\n458\n00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:19.690\nSo I'm using what's called a virtual\nmachine here, so this is in my test lab.\n\n459\n00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:23.580\nBut let's say that this machine right\nover here is my regular desktop.\n\n460\n00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:27.610\nAnd let's say that I'm on\nthe first floor over here and\n\n461\n00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:30.800\nthe other machine, let's say,\nis on the third floor of the building.\n\n462\n00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:34.820\nWell, I could run up every time, up the\nstairs, and get access to that machine if\n\n463\n00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:38.610\nI needed to, but an easier way,\nregardless of where you are,\n\n464\n00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:41.450\nis to set this thing up for\nwhat we call remote access.\n\n465\n00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:47.960\nNow, when you do that, all I need\nto do is go ahead, click on Start.\n\n466\n00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:51.800\nAnd then I'm gonna right-click\non Computer if I can.\n\n467\n00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:52.400\nApparently I don't.\n\n468\n00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:52.914\n>> Right-click.\n\n469\n00:24:52.914 --> 00:24:54.250\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I'm going to right-click\n\n470\n00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:55.240\non the computer.\n\n471\n00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:59.570\nAnd then I'm going to\ngo down to Properties.\n\n472\n00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:00.620\nAnd what I'm looking for\n\n473\n00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:04.240\nis over here on the left hand side\nwhere it says Remote Settings.\n\n474\n00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:08.360\nSo if I select that connection right\nthere, and what I'm looking for\n\n475\n00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:11.190\nis where it says Remote Desktop.\n\n476\n00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:14.940\nRight now it says don't allow\nanybody to make that connection.\n\n477\n00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:19.530\nSo if I'm trying to gain access to some\nof the servers that I am having to work\n\n478\n00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:24.260\nwith or even another machine what I want\nto do instead is actually select the allow\n\n479\n00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:29.200\nconnections from computers running any\nversion or even the more secured version.\n\n480\n00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.560\nIt just depends on what machine\nis around your network.\n\n481\n00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:35.572\nSo if I know that there's a mix of\nmachines like XP machines and Windows 7,\n\n482\n00:25:35.572 --> 00:25:36.783\nWindows 8 and stuff,\n\n483\n00:25:36.783 --> 00:25:40.948\nthen I might just select this one cuz I\ndon't know which machine I might be on.\n\n484\n00:25:40.948 --> 00:25:45.238\nBut if I know that the machines I'm gonna\nbe on are right here, in other words,\n\n485\n00:25:45.238 --> 00:25:48.210\nthey're relatively\nmodern computers by far.\n\n486\n00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:50.020\nThen I might even select this one.\n\n487\n00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.480\nAnd so I'm gonna click OK here.\n\n488\n00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:57.300\nAnd once I do that, now if I can\nactually find my machine again.\n\n489\n00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:02.370\nFrom this one, there is actually going\nto be an application on this computer\n\n490\n00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:04.950\ncalled the remote desktop connection.\n\n491\n00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:10.980\nSo I'm gonna click on the Windows\nbutton here, and then type in remote,\n\n492\n00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:16.700\nand once I do that you see that the search\nfeature finds the application for me.\n\n493\n00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:19.210\nSelects the Remote Desktop Connection.\n\n494\n00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:23.340\nIt's right here that I can now type in,\n\n495\n00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:28.120\nif everything is actually working\nfine here, click Connect.\n\n496\n00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:28.760\nAnd there it is.\n\n497\n00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.440\nIt actually gives me that access\nto be able to access that machine.\n\n498\n00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:35.619\nAnd so here I need to type in\nthe credentials for that one.\n\n499\n00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:39.834\nAnd that's actually not going work.\n\n500\n00:26:39.834 --> 00:26:42.793\nI need the server, SRV01.\n\n501\n00:26:42.793 --> 00:26:45.760\nActually I think I did join\nthis thing to the domain.\n\n502\n00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:48.130\nLet me use my domain credentials,\n\n503\n00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:50.980\nsometimes I may actually\ntype that in incorrectly.\n\n504\n00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:54.000\nSo you need to have the credentials that\nwill actually allow you to get access in\n\n505\n00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.140\nor you cant do it.\n\n506\n00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:57.080\nAnd then I can click OK.\n\n507\n00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.520\nAnd now, there it is.\n\n508\n00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:01.650\nIt's an application that's\nrunning on top of my desktop.\n\n509\n00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:04.020\nIf I do it this way,\nyou can see that, right?\n\n510\n00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:08.280\nSo from any machine on my network,\nas long as I have access to that one,\n\n511\n00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:12.380\nI can now sit here and configure this\nmachine the way that I want to and\n\n512\n00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:14.900\nbe able to work with it perfectly fine.\n\n513\n00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:16.942\nSo you can use this remote access for\n\n514\n00:27:16.942 --> 00:27:20.973\ncontrol of those machines instead of\nhaving to go to every single one.\n\n515\n00:27:20.973 --> 00:27:24.571\nNow it doesn't mean that it's always\ngonna be turned on on every machine,\n\n516\n00:27:24.571 --> 00:27:28.810\nnormally you do want to limit it to\nthe ones that you do need to connect to.\n\n517\n00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:32.430\nAnd what I was doing is, always\nthe servers that I was in charge of,\n\n518\n00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:34.530\nthat I would actually be able to do this.\n\n519\n00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:38.800\nSo, it actually does give you nice control\nbecause it's sitting here just like\n\n520\n00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:44.100\nI was sitting directly at that machine's\nterminal, keyboard and everything.\n\n521\n00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:47.400\nAnd then I can gain access,\nI can configure, I can change things, and\n\n522\n00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.300\nI can manage it directly from\nwherever I am in the world.\n\n523\n00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:53.690\nIt really is one of the neatest\nservices that we end up using,\n\n524\n00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:55.980\nthat makes an impact and the difference.\n\n525\n00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:57.410\nNow somebody can call me up and says,\n\n526\n00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:00.100\nhey look I don't have access\nto what I think I need.\n\n527\n00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:02.570\nI can go ahead and check that\nout even if I'm sitting at home,\n\n528\n00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:05.830\nI can use this remote desktop connection,\nand it works perfectly fine.\n\n529\n00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:07.960\nAnd it's just like I'm\nright there at the server.\n\n530\n00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:08.974\nVery neat technology.\n\n531\n00:28:08.974 --> 00:28:10.530\n>> Oh yeah, it's great technology.\n\n532\n00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:14.230\nAs administrators, once you get into that\nrole of you actually having to support\n\n533\n00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:17.410\nmaybe some services or\na server this is your bread and butter.\n\n534\n00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:20.290\nYou're not gonna be going in and\nout of the server room.\n\n535\n00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:21.550\nI'll give you a primary example.\n\n536\n00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:27.080\nOn my desk and office literally was\nfour feet from the server closet.\n\n537\n00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:31.540\nI could have easily gotten up from my\ndesk, walked into the server room,\n\n538\n00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:34.270\ngrabbed a keyboard, mouse, and monitor,\nand went to town on the server.\n\n539\n00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:35.750\nI never did that.\n\n540\n00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:40.880\nOnly if things went completely haywire\ndid I actually enter the server room\n\n541\n00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:41.800\nto do something?\n\n542\n00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:46.060\nI sat at my desk, I used Remote Desktop\nConnection to access those servers,\n\n543\n00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:48.130\nbecause it's a whole lot more convenient.\n\n544\n00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:51.680\nAnd it's not like I'm limited to one\nserver, I could have five servers open if\n\n545\n00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:55.200\nI want to, all in different tabs,\nall doing different things.\n\n546\n00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.150\nIt makes that administration\nthat much easier.\n\n547\n00:28:57.150 --> 00:29:00.750\nI never leave the comfort of my own\nchair to be able to access those,\n\n548\n00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:04.130\nmake changes, allocate resources,\ndo whatever it is I need to do.\n\n549\n00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:08.400\nAnd Ronnie you made a really good point\nwhen it came to who has access to this.\n\n550\n00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:12.365\nJust because you go in and enable remote\ndesktop doesn't mean you're just going to\n\n551\n00:29:12.365 --> 00:29:16.345\nbe, but okay now I can use my credentials\nhere and jump right on that server.\n\n552\n00:29:16.345 --> 00:29:20.515\nOnly by default I think\nis the administrators and\n\n553\n00:29:20.515 --> 00:29:24.485\nthe remote desktop users,\nhave access to this.\n\n554\n00:29:24.485 --> 00:29:27.325\nSo you either need to be in\nthe administrators group or\n\n555\n00:29:27.325 --> 00:29:31.005\nin a group that is in the remote\ndesktop administrators group.\n\n556\n00:29:31.005 --> 00:29:32.605\nSo it's very controlled.\n\n557\n00:29:32.605 --> 00:29:35.190\nThey don't want just anybody\nhaving access to those things.\n\n558\n00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:40.310\nThere is also the remote assistance as\nwell, which is similar but different.\n\n559\n00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:44.310\nBut like I said, it's very similar in\nany ability that you're able to look at\n\n560\n00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:47.210\na computer and make changes,\nclick on items, and\n\n561\n00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:51.550\nit's from your computer to a computer\nthat is nowhere near you at all.\n\n562\n00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:54.460\nOr even if it is sitting right\nnext to you, you're remote in, so\n\n563\n00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:56.260\nyou don't have to use two\ndifferent keyboards and stuff.\n\n564\n00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.810\n>> Yeah, when you are actually using\nremote assistance, it's because somebody\n\n565\n00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:01.970\nis asking you to connect in,\nto do some type of troubleshooting.\n\n566\n00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:03.200\nBut on most of these things,\n\n567\n00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:07.100\nlike you also saw on the server program\nthere, that option is grayed out.\n\n568\n00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:08.890\nSo you can't find it on\nevery single machine,\n\n569\n00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:12.440\nbecause they don't ever expect\na server to actually be using that.\n\n570\n00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.120\nBut setting up these services,\n\n571\n00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:17.450\nthese are kind of key elements\nthat in networking really do help.\n\n572\n00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:21.300\nBecause you do, you have access to so many\nmore devices by being able to do that on\n\n573\n00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:24.160\nmachines, so\nthat you can manage them a lot easier.\n\n574\n00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:29.940\nAnd networking, the services really\nare all about making networking easier so\n\n575\n00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:33.290\nthat we can control a lot\nmore by using a lot less.\n\n576\n00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:37.180\nAnd so dynamic host configuration\nprotocol remote access are just\n\n577\n00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:41.950\ntwo of the foundational ones that you're\ngonna find yourself in a lot of times.\n\n578\n00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:43.600\nJust verifying that it works and\n\n579\n00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:47.370\nthen of course with remote access you can\nactually do that across multiple machines\n\n580\n00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:50.850\nand it really does make it easy and\nmakes it do what networks should do.\n\n581\n00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:51.560\n>> Yes.\n\n582\n00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.410\nAll right, Ronnie,\nwe've covered a lot of ground today,\n\n583\n00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:55.070\neven though it was just a few topics.\n\n584\n00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:56.860\nObviously very important ones.\n\n585\n00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:59.190\nWe thank you for your demonstrations and\nyour explanations.\n\n586\n00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:02.170\nIs there anything else we need to cover\nbefore we let these good people go?\n\n587\n00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:05.830\n>> No just kind of remember that the\nservices, don't get confused by that term,\n\n588\n00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:10.310\nit really is just software that's running\non that computer that we configure.\n\n589\n00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:13.560\nAnd you and I shouldn't have to touch\nit again unless something breaks.\n\n590\n00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:16.380\nSo when somebody says that,\nwhen somebody tries to sound impressive,\n\n591\n00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:18.650\noh I'm running six or\nseven servers, you're gonna go.\n\n592\n00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:19.910\nOkay, fine.\n\n593\n00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:23.110\nDon't get me wrong, it does take\nsome skill to configure them right,\n\n594\n00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:24.630\nto do whatever they need to.\n\n595\n00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:27.600\nBut when it comes down to it,\nthat's really the goal of the server.\n\n596\n00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.840\nConfigure it once, leave it alone,\nlet it do its job.\n\n597\n00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:33.690\nNo human really needs to interact\nwith it after that unless it breaks.\n\n598\n00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:35.420\n>> That's right.\nLet's automate our entire lives,\n\n599\n00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:36.660\nthat's what I'm talking about.\n\n600\n00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:39.150\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> All right everyone,\nhopefully you've enjoyed this episode,\n\n601\n00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:40.140\nyou got a lot out of it.\n\n602\n00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:41.470\nWe had a great time making it for you.\n\n603\n00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:42.970\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n604\n00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:45.420\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowry.\n\n605\n00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:46.070\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n606\n00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:47.815\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n607\n00:31:47.815 --> 00:31:51.631\n[SOUND]\n\n",

fantastic\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.841 --> 00:00:18.961\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, joining me\ntoday is none other than good old Mr.\n\n5\n00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:19.540\nRonnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.490\nHow's it going today, Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.540\n>> It's going great today.\n\n8\n00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.220\nWe're here to take a look at the MTA,\nthe Microsoft Technology Associate.\n\n9\n00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.730\nGetting ready for exam 98366,\nthat Networking Fundamentals exam.\n\n10\n00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.870\nSo, that's the one you're preparing for,\nyou are in the right place.\n\n11\n00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.490\nWhat we're gonna take a look at today\nis we're gonna talk a little bit about\n\n12\n00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.800\nthe TCP/IP protocols is\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n13\n00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.660\nA lot of times when you hear\n\n14\n00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.890\nthis term you're actually talking\nabout what's called a protocol family.\n\n15\n00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.740\nOr you may hear the term\nprotocol suite and,\n\n16\n00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.420\nwhat the heck does that actually mean for\nus?\n\n17\n00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.263\nWell, when we start taking\na look at the idea of TCP/IP,\n\n18\n00:00:51.263 --> 00:00:53.411\nwhen we start talking about the protocol.\n\n19\n00:00:53.411 --> 00:00:56.508\nUsually, you'll hear it called\nthat language of the internet,\n\n20\n00:00:56.508 --> 00:00:58.210\nwhich is what TCP/IP is.\n\n21\n00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.270\nAnd what that means is that we are gonna\nbe following the rules set fourth\n\n22\n00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.480\nby that picker protocol standard is\nwhat we're gonna actually be able to do.\n\n23\n00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.415\nSo there are many different types of\nprotocol families that are out there.\n\n24\n00:01:10.415 --> 00:01:14.660\nBut on the internet the one that\nwe use is what we call TCP/IP.\n\n25\n00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.070\nSo included in TCP/IP is not only\nthe rules about communication and\n\n26\n00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.790\nthings like addressing the IP\naddressing that we use on the internet.\n\n27\n00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.500\nIt also has to deal with a lot of\nways that we transfer the data, and\n\n28\n00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.030\nit also ends up dealing with the way\nthat the OSI model also works, too.\n\n29\n00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.420\nSo it really does define two\nthings right at the beginning.\n\n30\n00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.710\nTCP, if you remember from the early shows\nwhere we talked about the OSI model,\n\n31\n00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.790\nhappens on layer four.\n\n32\n00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.618\nAnd what that's really describing is\nthe type of connection that needs to\n\n33\n00:01:45.618 --> 00:01:48.778\nbe made between devices before\ndata is actually exchanged.\n\n34\n00:01:48.778 --> 00:01:53.033\nAnd then IP, which happens on\nlayer three of the OSI model,\n\n35\n00:01:53.033 --> 00:01:55.850\ntells you the way that we deliver that.\n\n36\n00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.210\nIn other words the addressing\nscheme that we use.\n\n37\n00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.956\nSo in the beginning of networking across\nthe internet what used to always happen is\n\n38\n00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:05.930\nthat every single piece of\ndata before it was sent.\n\n39\n00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.342\nThose connections had\nto be established and\n\n40\n00:02:08.342 --> 00:02:12.140\nsynchronized before we would\ntransmit data to each other.\n\n41\n00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.720\nAfter a while what started to happen was\nthis, is that they started realizing\n\n42\n00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.270\nnot every single piece of data needs to\nactually have a synchronization first.\n\n43\n00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.420\nThere's some data that we can just send,\nso they even included in that\n\n44\n00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.520\nUser Datagram Protocol stuff after awhile,\nand once they did that they were fine.\n\n45\n00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.790\nSo now we have the addressing\nthat we're using on the internet.\n\n46\n00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.216\nWe understand that we can actually send\ndata whether or not the actual machines\n\n47\n00:02:35.216 --> 00:02:39.340\nhave a direct connection or\nwhether actually they don't have one.\n\n48\n00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.850\nIt's perfectly fine and we can do that.\n\n49\n00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.361\nSo along with that they introduced,\nof course, other protocols and\n\n50\n00:02:46.361 --> 00:02:50.657\nother utilities and tools to help\nus out when we needed to verify.\n\n51\n00:02:50.657 --> 00:02:54.220\nOr when we needed to do a little bit\nof troubleshooting to ensure that\n\n52\n00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.340\nthe entire networking\nwould also end up working.\n\n53\n00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.452\nSo we wanna do a little bit of a reminder.\n\n54\n00:02:59.452 --> 00:03:03.394\nAs well as just show us some of the tools\nthat we're gonna be using when we start\n\n55\n00:03:03.394 --> 00:03:06.427\ntalking about the use of TCP/IP and\nbeing able to verify and\n\n56\n00:03:06.427 --> 00:03:08.993\nbeing able to do a little\nbit of troubleshooting.\n\n57\n00:03:08.993 --> 00:03:13.970\n>> Yeah, TCP/IP has a lot of really\ncool tools actually that are built\n\n58\n00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.250\ninto that suite of protocols.\n\n59\n00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.510\nIt's starts getting a little confusing.\n\n60\n00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.710\nIt's like well, I've got a TCP protocol,\nI've got an IP protocol and\n\n61\n00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.545\nnow they're a TCP/IP protocol.\n\n62\n00:03:24.545 --> 00:03:28.075\nAnd I've got tools that use\nthose protocols that yes,\n\n63\n00:03:28.075 --> 00:03:29.345\nit does get a little layered.\n\n64\n00:03:29.345 --> 00:03:31.830\nReally what it boils down to is this,\n\n65\n00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.410\nis PCP/IP is the suite of protocols\nthat we use to talk on a network.\n\n66\n00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.955\nRight?\n\n67\n00:03:36.955 --> 00:03:41.692\nAnd then there are tools that utilize that\nsuite of protocols for us to verify things\n\n68\n00:03:41.692 --> 00:03:46.000\nlike activity, troubleshoot problems,\nall that other good stuff.\n\n69\n00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.995\nAnd then there are even other protocols\nthat you use that suite of protocols.\n\n70\n00:03:49.995 --> 00:03:51.477\nI know, right?\n\n71\n00:03:51.477 --> 00:03:53.676\nIt's a crazy wrapped up ball of string.\n\n72\n00:03:53.676 --> 00:03:57.380\nAs you start unraveling it,\nit starts to make more sense though.\n\n73\n00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.331\nBut those other protocols\nthat we use to send data and\n\n74\n00:04:00.331 --> 00:04:03.284\ndo specific types of connection for\nour computers,\n\n75\n00:04:03.284 --> 00:04:07.259\nmaking sure that they are connected\ncorrectly and working as needed.\n\n76\n00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.761\nAnd Ronnie,\n\n77\n00:04:07.761 --> 00:04:10.823\nwe're gonna start off with some tools,\nbecause well that's where the fun is.\n\n78\n00:04:10.823 --> 00:04:12.390\nRight?\n>> That really is.\n\n79\n00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.210\nIt's one of those things that we as\ntechnicians really do need to understand.\n\n80\n00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:20.160\nSome of the basic command line utilities\nthat you are gonna have to be able\n\n81\n00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.130\nto not only see but know what they do,\nas well as be able to use.\n\n82\n00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.790\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at a few of them right here.\n\n83\n00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.170\nSo on my screen I went ahead and\nlaunched a command prompt.\n\n84\n00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.910\nI'm running server 2008 r2, and\n\n85\n00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.250\nright here I've just brought up\na command prompt to help us out.\n\n86\n00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.260\nOne of the initial tools that we\nshould be familiar with that's\n\n87\n00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.930\nfound in our TCP/IP protocol suite\nis is gonna be what we call ping.\n\n88\n00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.270\nPing allows us to test for\nbasic connectivity between my machine and\n\n89\n00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.640\nwhatever the end device is.\n\n90\n00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.020\nNow the reason why one\nestablished basic connectivity,\n\n91\n00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.380\nof course, is that if I can't get\na ping through, I can't expect for\n\n92\n00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.740\nany other traffic to get through as well.\n\n93\n00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.430\nSo either the other side is answering or\nthe other side is not.\n\n94\n00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.520\nPing is the best connectivity tool that\nwe have and it really does help us\n\n95\n00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.960\nout in a pinch to verify, hey,\nthe other side is up and ready to respond.\n\n96\n00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.370\nSo normally when we start\noff it's fairly simple.\n\n97\n00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.230\nWe can actually do ping and then we can\npick an address out there on the internet.\n\n98\n00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.130\nSo if I should do something like,\nlet's just do ITPro.tv.\n\n99\n00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.850\nIf I do that, notice that what ends up\nhappening right now is that what we get is\n\n100\n00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:31.950\nthis little bit of information, and ping\ninside of Windows sends out four packets.\n\n101\n00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.958\nAnd what it does is expecting,\nwell, replies to come back as well.\n\n102\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:38.349\nNow if you were to do this, let's say,\nin another type of machine,\n\n103\n00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:41.750\nlike in the Linus world or\nsomething, this goes on forever.\n\n104\n00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.950\nBut here in Microsoft, they said look,\nfour is enough to verify and\n\n105\n00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.500\ntest what we're looking for.\n\n106\n00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.600\nAnd in this line of what we see.\n\n107\n00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.490\nRight?\nI ping the name, and then it also returned\n\n108\n00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.450\nto me the IP address and it told me\nhow much data was also sent too.\n\n109\n00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.730\nAnd notice we have 32 bytes of data and\n\n110\n00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.680\neach one is returned in\na time period that we see.\n\n111\n00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.170\nWhat we're really looking for, right,\n\n112\n00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:08.850\nis that we get all four replies\nthat come back, which means, hey.\n\n113\n00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:13.245\nI'm actually able to send and to able\nto get data perfectly fine from them.\n\n114\n00:06:13.245 --> 00:06:14.765\nAnd the other thing that we're looking for\n\n115\n00:06:14.765 --> 00:06:18.075\nis this time period where you see\nit in milliseconds or microseconds.\n\n116\n00:06:18.075 --> 00:06:19.365\nI think it's milliseconds here.\n\n117\n00:06:19.365 --> 00:06:22.625\nIt's 28 milliseconds is what\nwe're expecting to see.\n\n118\n00:06:22.625 --> 00:06:24.815\nWhen you start getting\ninto the hundreds or\n\n119\n00:06:24.815 --> 00:06:27.415\ntwo hundred millisecond range\nin getting this stuff back.\n\n120\n00:06:27.415 --> 00:06:30.706\nYou're now starting to actually have\nit where you are experiencing lag at\n\n121\n00:06:30.706 --> 00:06:31.298\nthat point.\n\n122\n00:06:31.298 --> 00:06:34.570\nBut, that's not so important for\nwhat we're talking about right here.\n\n123\n00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.060\nThe key is actually about is\nthe other side answering.\n\n124\n00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.600\nIs it actually getting\nback what we expect?\n\n125\n00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.390\nIf we get losses, that may indicate\nthat somewhere along that path\n\n126\n00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:49.250\nis not actually up and\nit's not actually doing what we need to.\n\n127\n00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.970\nAnd so they either rerouted it\nsomewhere or what happened is that\n\n128\n00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:58.650\nparticular interface has actually gone up\nand then went down and came back up again.\n\n129\n00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.450\nWe only get, let's say,\nthree out of the four that comes in.\n\n130\n00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:04.250\nOr it could just be it's a little\nbit of a delayed response.\n\n131\n00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.660\nSo this is one of the initial\nthings that we have to do.\n\n132\n00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.330\nNow when we start talking about it,\n\n133\n00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.210\nthere is an order to the way that\nwe should ping devices as well.\n\n134\n00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.000\nDepending on what we're\ntrying to establish here.\n\n135\n00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.110\nSo internally,\nif I'm actually inside of my network,\n\n136\n00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:22.210\nnormally the way that we do this is that\nwe normally need to ping ourselves first.\n\n137\n00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:23.760\nSo what we do is we ping 127.\n\n138\n00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.626\nOops.\n\n139\n00:07:24.626 --> 00:07:30.160\n172 [LAUGH] 127.0.0.1 and\nthat is my loop back address.\n\n140\n00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.950\nThat indicates to me that\nmy own network adapter\n\n141\n00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:38.985\ncan actually be able to respond to,\nwell a command that's being sent to it.\n\n142\n00:07:38.985 --> 00:07:42.785\nSo I know that my network adapter\ncard can send and receive.\n\n143\n00:07:42.785 --> 00:07:45.252\nAnd that is actually just\nverifying that that is good.\n\n144\n00:07:45.252 --> 00:07:48.517\nThe next thing that we\nmight choose to do is ping\n\n145\n00:07:48.517 --> 00:07:51.709\nanother device inside\nof my network as well.\n\n146\n00:07:51.709 --> 00:07:53.169\nAnd I'm going to ping my default gateway,\n\n147\n00:07:53.169 --> 00:07:55.780\ncuz that's the only other machine that\nI have on this network for right now.\n\n148\n00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.668\nSo I'm going to ping that.\n\n149\n00:07:57.668 --> 00:08:01.473\nBut with that default gateway,\nnow I know that, internally on my network,\n\n150\n00:08:01.473 --> 00:08:04.920\nthings are still good because I can\nactually reach another machine,\n\n151\n00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.016\nthe other machine is reaching back to me.\n\n152\n00:08:07.016 --> 00:08:11.525\nAnd then we can actually ping\noutside of our network as well.\n\n153\n00:08:11.525 --> 00:08:16.065\nSo there's a couple of DNS servers that\nhave been around for a long time as well.\n\n154\n00:08:16.065 --> 00:08:21.815\nAnd so right there 4.2.2.1 is one that we\ncan also use and I'm getting reply back.\n\n155\n00:08:21.815 --> 00:08:24.338\nBy doing this I'm verifying each path or\n\n156\n00:08:24.338 --> 00:08:28.947\neach step along the way that I have\ngood connectivity to be able to do that.\n\n157\n00:08:28.947 --> 00:08:33.072\nAnd that is the order that you do want to\nfollow when you are trying to ping cuz it\n\n158\n00:08:33.072 --> 00:08:34.229\ncould be that you do.\n\n159\n00:08:34.229 --> 00:08:38.760\nYou have a ping perfectly fine between\nyou and another machine on your network.\n\n160\n00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.560\nBut if you can't get past your default\ngateway, well, the last place that you can\n\n161\n00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:46.620\nping, or the last place you can't ping, is\nprobably where your issue is going to be.\n\n162\n00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:52.310\nSo this little tiny tool as you go, what's\nthe big deal about finding out about it?\n\n163\n00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:55.010\nBut notice a lot of\nthe information that we get back\n\n164\n00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:57.570\nis from actually understanding\nwhere the pings stop.\n\n165\n00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.390\nAnd understanding the order that\ncan actually lead us to where it's\n\n166\n00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:01.880\nactually gonna be where we have a problem.\n\n167\n00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:02.680\nPretty cool.\n\n168\n00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.590\n>> Definitely, very, very cool.\n\n169\n00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:06.100\nI'll tell you what.\nI've been doing this job for\n\n170\n00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.420\nquite a while now,\nprobably over ten years.\n\n171\n00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.380\nPing is one of the tools that\nI use almost on a daily basis.\n\n172\n00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.810\nI'm always verifying connectivity\nbecause what happens is,\n\n173\n00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:17.100\na lot of people will say I'm\nhaving network trouble, right?\n\n174\n00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.180\nAnd oh, okay,\nmy computer's running slowly.\n\n175\n00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.920\nMaybe those milliseconds\nare way jacked up and\n\n176\n00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.630\nthey would be experiencing some\nsort of slowdown in web traffic.\n\n177\n00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.730\nSo you wanna check that ping does that for\nus.\n\n178\n00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.770\nPing checks that connectivity.\n\n179\n00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:31.710\nI can't print to the printer.\n\n180\n00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:33.400\nWell do you have connectivity\nwith the printer?\n\n181\n00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.860\nYou go sit down at their computer.\n\n182\n00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.210\nYou ping the printer if it's\na network-based printer.\n\n183\n00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:38.060\nIf you get a reply,\n\n184\n00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:41.510\nwell at least you know that network\nconnectivity is not the problem.\n\n185\n00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:44.410\nAt that point, it's probably some sort\nof issue with the print driver or\n\n186\n00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:45.900\nthe print device itself.\n\n187\n00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.150\nBut not the network.\n\n188\n00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:50.890\nIf I don't get a reply from the printer,\nwell I found my problem.\n\n189\n00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:52.080\nPing does that for us.\n\n190\n00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.500\nAnd even out to letting me know,\nall right, I've pinged myself,\n\n191\n00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.600\nI know I'm working.\n\n192\n00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.710\nI've pinged my gateway like Ronnie's done.\n\n193\n00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:02.238\nI know that every device inside of\nmy network is working properly.\n\n194\n00:10:02.238 --> 00:10:04.408\nBut I'm not able to get to ITProTV.\n\n195\n00:10:04.408 --> 00:10:05.760\nI ping ITProTV.\n\n196\n00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.840\nI get nothing.\n\n197\n00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.910\nAnd now I know, problem's not inside.\n\n198\n00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:12.990\nIt's outside of my network because I\npinged up to the edge of my network.\n\n199\n00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:14.470\nAnd everything's working fine.\n\n200\n00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:17.070\nThe problem must lie somewhere else.\n\n201\n00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.180\nAnd Ronnie that brings us actually\nto another tool, doesn't it?\n\n202\n00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.000\n>> It really does.\n\n203\n00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.220\nOnce we actually understand ping is\nshowing us what it's showing us and\n\n204\n00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.430\nwe can't get past that the way\nthat Daniel was describing.\n\n205\n00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:29.650\nWe actually do have another\nutility that we can use,\n\n206\n00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:33.570\nthat will help us to pinpoint\nwhere the issue will be.\n\n207\n00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:37.215\nAnd that is something that we\ncall a trace RT or trace route.\n\n208\n00:10:37.215 --> 00:10:40.320\nAnd in Microsoft,\nit is actually limited to that.\n\n209\n00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.300\nSo it's trace RT.\n\n210\n00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:45.060\nNow you may see it in other forms as well.\n\n211\n00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.240\nYou might see somebody actually\ntype out the word trace route.\n\n212\n00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.200\nBut here in Microsoft, this is\nthe way you're going to see it here.\n\n213\n00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.030\nSo, if I know that if I actually get\nping failures that come back, and\n\n214\n00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.700\nI need to figure out where\nit's actually failed,\n\n215\n00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:00.390\nthis only works if the failure\nis past my network.\n\n216\n00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.190\nSo if I ping my default gateway,\nand just like Daniel said,\n\n217\n00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:07.830\nI still can't reach ITProTV, this is\na perfect opportunity for me to use this.\n\n218\n00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:10.020\nBut If I do a trace route and\n\n219\n00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:13.360\nit's actually to another device inside\nof my network, then I know this is not\n\n220\n00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.540\nthe one to use because that's not gonna\nactually trace anywhere, because what\n\n221\n00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:19.970\nwe're expecting to find is different\nnetwork changes along the way, right?\n\n222\n00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:23.030\n>> Yah, that's exactly right,\nI'm looking to see what happens\n\n223\n00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:27.750\nonce the packet leaves my network,\nor it goes to another network.\n\n224\n00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:30.390\nIt might be a network I actually own and\noperate.\n\n225\n00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:34.100\nBut once it gets out of this network\nthat it's in, what happens to it?\n\n226\n00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:35.160\nDoes it continue on?\n\n227\n00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.990\nDoes it fail there?\n\n228\n00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:37.872\nI don't know.\n\n229\n00:11:37.872 --> 00:11:41.440\nTracer RT, that helps me figure\nout whether that is happening.\n\n230\n00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.970\nDoes it make it all the way to the end and\nif it stops, where does it stop?\n\n231\n00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:49.750\nKinda showing us exactly where\nthe problem most likely is occurring\n\n232\n00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:53.950\nif that trace route, you type in\nthe command and it goes to town.\n\n233\n00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.150\nYou find it stops and\nit doesn't continue on.\n\n234\n00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:59.690\nWell, it's probably hit somewhere that's\ngot a down link, something like that.\n\n235\n00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:02.240\nNow you know exactly where\nat least it's going down at.\n\n236\n00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:02.820\n>> Right.\n\n237\n00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.370\nSo, we take a look at the output\nof what's happening here.\n\n238\n00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:09.350\nI went ahead and just did a trace\nroute out to ITProTV like we've said.\n\n239\n00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:11.370\nAnd what we're actually\nstarting to see is right here.\n\n240\n00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:13.260\nThis is what we're normally looking for\n\n241\n00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:17.900\nis this indication that nothing is\nactually getting past that point.\n\n242\n00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.590\nAnd the funny thing is,\nthis is my default gateway.\n\n243\n00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:23.800\nSo what we'd normally do is we would\ntroubleshoot right here to see what's\n\n244\n00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.330\nactually causing the issue.\n\n245\n00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.362\nNow on this one,\nit is getting past it, right?\n\n246\n00:12:28.362 --> 00:12:32.070\nSo but this is the last point that you or\nI have any information about.\n\n247\n00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:35.210\nSo that's why we would actually\ntroubleshoot beginning from that point.\n\n248\n00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:37.550\nWhenever you see these\nasterisks that are here,\n\n249\n00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:39.510\nyou're not getting any information back.\n\n250\n00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:44.690\nBut the funny thing is,\nnotice that it's still continuing on.\n\n251\n00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:46.230\nSo that means it's still trying.\n\n252\n00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:49.080\nIt's still actually doing\nsomething in the background.\n\n253\n00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:53.210\nAnd so this has a chance to go up\nto it says maximum of 30 hops.\n\n254\n00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:55.110\nSo if it can’t reach it in 30,\nit’s just saying,\n\n255\n00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:56.800\nlook we don’t know what to tell you.\n\n256\n00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.320\nIt’s not out there,\nit’s not what address your looking for.\n\n257\n00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.120\nSomething else must be wrong.\n\n258\n00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.550\nBut there is a possibility and\n\n259\n00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.810\nthere’s a chance,\nthat this could be hidden on purpose.\n\n260\n00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:10.790\nIn other words, that look, these devices\nin between are not returning something\n\n261\n00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:14.710\nbecause they're choosing not to\nreturn something, but in the end,\n\n262\n00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:18.200\nif you still get the reply, in other\nwords, something that says, look, hey,\n\n263\n00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:22.300\nyou still made it there, but we're just\nnot showing you the path in between.\n\n264\n00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.720\nWell that might be because it\nis secured in some way somehow.\n\n265\n00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.640\nNow in this one, I don't know\nhow long it's going to take, but\n\n266\n00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.580\nI think I'd already previously\npulled this one up here.\n\n267\n00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.430\nSo that we could see it.\n\n268\n00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:36.110\nSo I ran this a little bit earlier,\nright before we started here.\n\n269\n00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:40.860\nAnd you can see that at number 11,\nthis did hit our firewall,\n\n270\n00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:42.260\nis what it ended up hitting.\n\n271\n00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:46.240\nSo in between my machine and\nthat firewall, it didn't show anything.\n\n272\n00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.700\nBut this is what it\nresolved to right here.\n\n273\n00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.120\nAnd so, that actually means, hey,\n\n274\n00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:55.530\nI did get the ITProTV, but I'm not showing\nyou any of the path in between because\n\n275\n00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:59.910\nI don't really want you to know\nhow it actually traced out.\n\n276\n00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:01.890\nAnd you can see right here\nit actually did finish.\n\n277\n00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:05.380\nThis one a couple of hops later than\nmy early one did but you can see that.\n\n278\n00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.820\nSo sometimes it will show\nyou the end result so\n\n279\n00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.670\nit's not that you're disconnected but\n\n280\n00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:12.740\njust all the stuff in there like\nyeah we're not showing that to you.\n\n281\n00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:14.750\n>> Yeah it's interesting\nRonnie shows that.\n\n282\n00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.810\nOn the first time I ran this it\nhad less hops than this one.\n\n283\n00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:18.920\nWell, what does that mean?\n\n284\n00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.820\nIt just means it took a different\npath to get to the end work station.\n\n285\n00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:22.740\nSometimes that happens.\n\n286\n00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:25.950\nAs you route through the Internet,\nyou have no control over that.\n\n287\n00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:28.000\nIt could go this path,\nit could go that path.\n\n288\n00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.410\nThose routers figure out what's\nthe best path for you at that time, and\n\n289\n00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:32.180\nthat's how they send you.\n\n290\n00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:35.910\nSo be just aware that when\nyou do a trace route,\n\n291\n00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:39.990\nit could show you less hops, more hops,\nmore information, less information.\n\n292\n00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:43.160\nIt just depends on the equipment\nthat you actually pass through and\n\n293\n00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.310\nwhat it's designed to give you back.\n\n294\n00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:48.950\n>> Yeah, the next one that we also want\nto talk about is one we call path ping.\n\n295\n00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:50.810\nPath ping does something very interesting.\n\n296\n00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:54.780\nRemember where ping itself really just\nshows whether or not we can get connected.\n\n297\n00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.472\nAnd then trace route\nshows the path along it.\n\n298\n00:14:57.472 --> 00:15:02.190\nPath ping is kind of a combination\nof both of these together as one.\n\n299\n00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:06.650\nAnd when you can run path ping it's just\nnot very successful against ours cuz we\n\n300\n00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:09.170\ndo have good security and\nwe're very proud of that.\n\n301\n00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:12.850\nBut when you see the term path ping,\nnotice it begins tracing the route and\n\n302\n00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:15.380\nit also does ping at the same time.\n\n303\n00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:18.110\nAnd what we get from\nthis is more statistics,\n\n304\n00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:21.460\nis what we're actually looking for\nwhen we take a look at this.\n\n305\n00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:26.470\nNormally, the type of statistics that are\nshown here usually have to do with latency\n\n306\n00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:29.940\nand have to do with the percentages of the\npackets that are dropped along the way.\n\n307\n00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:33.650\nAnd so if you do need that type of\ninformation, path ping is the way to go.\n\n308\n00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:37.960\nNow for this one, you can see what ends up\nhappening at the very beginning when they\n\n309\n00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.530\nstart off with trace route.\n\n310\n00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:42.050\nThey go ahead and they run that,\nand they continue to try and\n\n311\n00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:43.800\nrun it until it gets to the very end.\n\n312\n00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:48.001\nAnd then once they do, notice it says\nit's computing statistic at this point.\n\n313\n00:15:48.001 --> 00:15:52.891\nAnd the reason why that's important\nis because it is trying to generate\n\n314\n00:15:52.891 --> 00:15:55.752\nthe best amount of statistics and value.\n\n315\n00:15:55.752 --> 00:15:58.830\nSo that you can actually determine where\nthings are actually happening, and\n\n316\n00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:00.322\nwhere you're getting the latency.\n\n317\n00:16:00.322 --> 00:16:03.350\nWhere the things are actually\ndropping out a lot of times here.\n\n318\n00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:07.470\nNow because we do see where it's\nultimately gone from my machine, and\n\n319\n00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:09.520\nthen it's actually stopping some place.\n\n320\n00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:14.330\nWell, it's saying, look your particular\npathing is not getting past well\n\n321\n00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:18.570\nanything besides your default\ngateway at this point.\n\n322\n00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:22.910\nSo my firewall, or at least at this\npoint here, my router is saying.\n\n323\n00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:24.610\nYeah, and go ahead and\nPathPing all you want,\n\n324\n00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:26.760\nI'm not showing you diddly squat here.\n\n325\n00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.720\nSo it can compute those statistics and\nhand that back to me.\n\n326\n00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:33.190\nVery good if you're really not sure if\nthings are happening the way that you\n\n327\n00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:34.050\nthink they are.\n\n328\n00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:37.320\nBut if you are getting slow down, PathPing\nis probably the way that you will go\n\n329\n00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.910\ninstead that does show you\nthose statistics that you need.\n\n330\n00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:40.690\n>> That's right.\n\n331\n00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:43.230\nObviously we're showing you some really\ncool tools that give you a lot of\n\n332\n00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:47.860\ninformation to figure out what is going\non via your network connectivity.\n\n333\n00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.100\nAnd that's what it's all about.\n\n334\n00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.560\nAs you get into networking,\n\n335\n00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:54.090\nthese are things that you're gonna\nuse on a very rare regular basis.\n\n336\n00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:56.950\nAnother tool that you're probably\n[LAUGH] gonna use almost daily,\n\n337\n00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:59.590\nalmost guaranteed, is ipconfig.\n\n338\n00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:03.150\nIn a Windows environment,\nthis is the go-to for figuring out\n\n339\n00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:07.200\non my end station that I'm actually\nworking with, what is its configuration?\n\n340\n00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.080\nHow's this thing set up to\nactually talk to the network?\n\n341\n00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.280\nAnd Ronnie, I don't know about you,\n\n342\n00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:15.250\nbut I've probably entered this\ncommand half a million times.\n\n343\n00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:17.030\nI mean a lot, we use it a lot.\n\n344\n00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:19.670\n>> There is no doubt that this is one\nof the main commands that you and\n\n345\n00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:20.950\nI would end up using.\n\n346\n00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:24.200\nWhen somebody does complain\nabout connectivity issues,\n\n347\n00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.640\nwe have to verify, right?\n\n348\n00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.610\nWe have to know that that machine\nis ready to connect on the network.\n\n349\n00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:31.310\nAnd the way that we can\ndo it is we can try and\n\n350\n00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:33.910\npull up all the properties\nthrough the network connections.\n\n351\n00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:39.460\nBut what I can also do is launch a Command\nPrompt, and I can simply type in ipconfig.\n\n352\n00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:41.890\nWhen I end up typing in ipconfig,\n\n353\n00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:46.400\nI need to see do I have a valid\naddress on this network.\n\n354\n00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.150\nSo I am looking for it and\nwhat I'm looking for of course,\n\n355\n00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:51.000\nis this a valid address?\n\n356\n00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.560\nSubnet mask, as well as a default gateway,\nif I'm trying to connect outbound.\n\n357\n00:17:55.560 --> 00:18:01.520\nIf I have that information, I can now use\nthe tool that we were just talking about.\n\n358\n00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:05.710\nWhich is ping to verify that\nI have a connection to well,\n\n359\n00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:08.090\nat least another device here.\n\n360\n00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:11.610\nSo if this is actually not on the same\nnetwork well, then I'm in trouble.\n\n361\n00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:12.879\nI actually have to be able to type it.\n\n362\n00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:15.610\nSo now I can do that.\n\n363\n00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:19.360\nSo normally one of the first commands that\nI run after I verify that the computer is\n\n364\n00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.618\nactually physically\nplugged into the network.\n\n365\n00:18:21.618 --> 00:18:28.070\nIs this ipconfig to verify that I now have\na right IP address on that same network.\n\n366\n00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:30.590\nFrom that point, I can do that and\nthen if I try and\n\n367\n00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:32.730\nping some device outside of my network.\n\n368\n00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:36.520\nAnd I can't get to it,\nthen I can run traceroute as well,\n\n369\n00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:40.660\nso it really does help to at least\nbe able to see if we're doing this.\n\n370\n00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.378\nNow, there's a lot of other\noptions that are also available.\n\n371\n00:18:43.378 --> 00:18:47.270\nEven though ipconfig is by far the one\nthat gives you the most summarized\n\n372\n00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:50.860\ninformation, if you want all the details,\nright?\n\n373\n00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.920\nYou can just do an ipconfig all.\n\n374\n00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:54.720\nAnd when you do that,\n\n375\n00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:58.200\nnotice that it actually list it for\nevery single network adapter.\n\n376\n00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.000\nWhether it's a loopback or\nwhether it's actually a logical interface,\n\n377\n00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.220\nthis gives you every single\nbit of it right here.\n\n378\n00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.820\nSo on this one you can see where\nthere's a couple of ethernet adapters.\n\n379\n00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:13.530\nThere's a tunnel adapter for\nIPv6 and even more when you do that.\n\n380\n00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:18.520\nNow, a lot of this stuff still works even\nif your actually running dual stack.\n\n381\n00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.030\nWe did talk about dual stack\nin another episode, so\n\n382\n00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:24.270\nmake sure you talked about that or\ntake a look at that episode.\n\n383\n00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:28.750\nSo dual stack is when your running\nIPv4 and IPv6, and a lot of\n\n384\n00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:32.620\ncommands that you will run actually\nare the same and they're not the same.\n\n385\n00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:36.770\nIt's usually as simple as actually\nadding in a number six to the end here,\n\n386\n00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.390\nif I remember correctly.\n\n387\n00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:41.810\nLet me make sure I actually tell you\ncorrectly here before I go on, nope.\n\n388\n00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:45.310\nBut it used to be at least, that you'd\nactually just add in a six at the end,\n\n389\n00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:49.250\nso ping6 doesn't seem to be working\nthe way that it used to be.\n\n390\n00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:51.980\nSo, usually today then,\nit's probably gonna\n\n391\n00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:56.170\nbe the same commands that you can run and\nthen it'll also work in IPv6 as well.\n\n392\n00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:59.190\nSo it's kind of very neat\nto be able to do that here.\n\n393\n00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:02.940\nSo just kinda realize, ipconfig really\ndoes it, shows you a lot of information.\n\n394\n00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:06.600\nAnd sometimes, you can even control\nthe information that your computer\n\n395\n00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:10.190\nalso gets by being able to\nflush out the DNS cache.\n\n396\n00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:15.560\nBeing able to register a computer into\nthe DNS records when it needs to.\n\n397\n00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:18.860\nSo, there's a lot of other things that\nit can do, but at the beginning, for\n\n398\n00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.270\nus, just understanding.\n\n399\n00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:23.830\nIt shows us and allows us to verify\nthe IP addressing is correct,\n\n400\n00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:25.270\nit's probably the key thing for us.\n\n401\n00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:25.980\n>> That's right.\n\n402\n00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:27.020\nNow Ronnie mentions DNS.\n\n403\n00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:30.340\nThat's one of the most important\nprotocols in which we're going to\n\n404\n00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:33.820\nwork with in our systems,\nbecause it allows us to do things like.\n\n405\n00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:39.770\nPing itpro.tv instead of having to\nknow what itpro.tv's IP address is.\n\n406\n00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:45.560\nWithout that, we'd be really chucked\nto the fire because there are a ton\n\n407\n00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:49.020\nof Internet addresses out there for us and\nthere's no way we could remember them all.\n\n408\n00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:50.920\nSo DNS helps us out with that.\n\n409\n00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:55.260\nRonnie, what else do we need to know\nwhen it comes to TCP/IP and DNS?\n\n410\n00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:58.590\n>> When it comes down to TCP/IP and\nDNS, right?\n\n411\n00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:02.460\nIs we just need to know that that\nprocess is the main way that we\n\n412\n00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:05.700\nuse name resolution inside\nof a TCP/IP network.\n\n413\n00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:09.440\nAt one time it used to be\nan older protocol called NetBIOS.\n\n414\n00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.900\nAnd so you do wanna make sure\nthat you understand that, but\n\n415\n00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.490\nthat was only done inside\nof local area networks.\n\n416\n00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:20.150\nToday though, we are able to\nnetwork by name across networks,\n\n417\n00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:22.750\nand DNS is the reason why we can do that.\n\n418\n00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:26.160\nThe other thing that actually\nties this all in together, right?\n\n419\n00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.500\nIs what we call port numbers too.\n\n420\n00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:33.250\nSo when we actually do need to configure\nDNS to work, it operates on a port.\n\n421\n00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:36.150\nSo it's a protocol and TCP/IP uses\n\n422\n00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:40.030\nport numbers to make sure that we can\ndifferentiate between those protocols.\n\n423\n00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:44.530\nDNS operates on port 53, and allows\nus to do exactly what Dan was saying.\n\n424\n00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:51.250\nIf I can actually do a ping itpro,\nI still can't spell it, .tv.\n\n425\n00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:53.883\nNotice it already does that,\nit takes the name and\n\n426\n00:21:53.883 --> 00:21:56.060\nit translates it to an IP address.\n\n427\n00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:59.894\nAnd just as quickly,\nI can do something like google.com and\n\n428\n00:21:59.894 --> 00:22:03.790\nalso get the IP address back for\nthe name that I typed in.\n\n429\n00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:07.272\nAnd I can even do microsoft.com and\noh, well, maybe not,\n\n430\n00:22:07.272 --> 00:22:09.938\noh, I have to actually\ntype in the word ping.\n\n431\n00:22:09.938 --> 00:22:11.240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> How's that?\n\n432\n00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:16.700\nAnd you're noticing I didn't have to\ntype in any DNS command to do so.\n\n433\n00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:17.290\nWell, why?\n\n434\n00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:21.230\nIt's because it's a protocol\nthat's running on this machine,\n\n435\n00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:23.500\nit doesn't have to be\na command line utility.\n\n436\n00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:27.360\nWhat it's saying is if you type\nthe name in here, along with a command,\n\n437\n00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.730\nI can go out and\nI can resolve that for you.\n\n438\n00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:32.960\nBy using the system that's actually\nout there on the Internet,\n\n439\n00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.220\nas well as what's on your network as well.\n\n440\n00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:39.107\nSo just kind of remember that,\nport 53 as well as what it does, and\n\n441\n00:22:39.107 --> 00:22:42.672\nthis is the way that TCP/IP\nallows us to browse the Internet.\n\n442\n00:22:42.672 --> 00:22:45.920\n>> Yeah, it kind of supports TCP/IP.\n\n443\n00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:51.250\nIt expands its capabilities, so\nthat we can have an easier time using it.\n\n444\n00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:53.440\nBasically all the different ports and\n\n445\n00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.590\nprotocols we’re gonna talk about\ntoday are gonna do that very thing.\n\n446\n00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:58.910\nIt might do something\nthat DNS does its thing.\n\n447\n00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:02.810\nThe other tools and protocols that we’re\ngonna talk about, they do their own thing.\n\n448\n00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:05.940\nBut it supports that,\nexpands it's capabilities, so\n\n449\n00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:10.110\nthat we have an easier time in\nworking with the TCP/IP stack.\n\n450\n00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:11.720\nRonnie where else do we go today?\n\n451\n00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.610\n>> Well, when we start taking a look there\nare some other utilities that are out\n\n452\n00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:18.080\nthere that really do\nhelp us out tremendously.\n\n453\n00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.950\nWhen we need to send commands\nacross to other systems.\n\n454\n00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:26.560\nAnd one of those is a protocol that\nwe call Telnet, which is on port 23.\n\n455\n00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:29.970\nTelnet allows us to be able to\nsend commands to another system\n\n456\n00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:32.060\neven though I'm not sitting right there.\n\n457\n00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.949\nSo you can actually go out\nthere on the Internet and\n\n458\n00:23:33.949 --> 00:23:36.020\nactually Telnet just about into anything.\n\n459\n00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:38.340\nThat is operating what\nwe call a Telnet server.\n\n460\n00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.692\nSo one of the neat ones that Daniel\nfound right before the show, and\n\n461\n00:23:40.692 --> 00:23:42.043\nwe're gonna Telnet into this thing.\n\n462\n00:23:42.043 --> 00:23:46.134\nIs one that we call Telnet and\n\n463\n00:23:46.134 --> 00:23:50.566\nthis one's gonna be rainmaker\n\n464\n00:23:50.566 --> 00:23:55.686\nRainmaker.wunderground.com.\n\n465\n00:23:55.686 --> 00:24:00.700\nAnd notice I'm using that fully\nqualified domain name, that DNS name.\n\n466\n00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.260\nSo, you might be wondering like,\nwhy is this important?\n\n467\n00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:05.860\nWell, I'm using a TCP/IP protocol.\n\n468\n00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.020\nUsing the DNS protocol in the background.\n\n469\n00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:10.900\nThat's gonna translate\nthat into an IP address,\n\n470\n00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:14.620\nwhich is how we tie it back to TCP/IP\nis what ends up happening here.\n\n471\n00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:18.120\nAnd then when I press Enter,\nnotice there it actually gets me access\n\n472\n00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.790\ninto this system and\nit tells me right now, hey,\n\n473\n00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:24.440\nNational Weather Service information\nprovided by this company over here.\n\n474\n00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:28.600\nUpdated each minute as reports\ncome over our data feed as well.\n\n475\n00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.070\nAnd so press Enter to return.\n\n476\n00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:35.160\nAnd now for my city code, this is\ngonna be GNV I believe, Gainesville.\n\n477\n00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:38.570\nAnd then you can actually\nsee the text reports\n\n478\n00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:41.240\nthat are coming across\nthat network right there.\n\n479\n00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.630\nSo, partly cloudy tonight,\n20% chance of showers.\n\n480\n00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:45.240\nLows in the upper 60's.\n\n481\n00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.260\nEast winds at 5 to 10 mph.\n\n482\n00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:51.170\nNow, could you have gone out and\ndownloaded an app or\n\n483\n00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:55.020\nopened a web page that would've\ngiven you the same information?\n\n484\n00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:55.910\nYes.\n\n485\n00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:58.429\nBut, notice right here\ndon't have to do that.\n\n486\n00:24:58.429 --> 00:25:02.094\nIf I just need to verify that I\ncan get the information, well,\n\n487\n00:25:02.094 --> 00:25:04.010\nthis is something that I can do.\n\n488\n00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:07.880\nI can just use Telnet and verify that\nthat server is actually responsive\n\n489\n00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:11.170\nthe information is able to be retrieved,\nand I can do it right here, so\n\n490\n00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:13.680\nI know that I don't have to worry\nabout the application layer.\n\n491\n00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.020\nIn other words,\nis the application, I should say,\n\n492\n00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:18.190\nthat may actually point me\nto the application instead.\n\n493\n00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:19.940\nIn other words, the data exists, right?\n\n494\n00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:23.450\nI can pull it over text, but is there\nsomething wrong with the application that\n\n495\n00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:25.870\nis not actually pulling into that.\n\n496\n00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:28.660\nWell, then I don't have to worry\nbecause I know it can be retrieved\n\n497\n00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:31.720\njust by using a simple\napplication like Telnet here.\n\n498\n00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.620\nAnd this is one of\nthe fundamental ones that we use.\n\n499\n00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:37.530\nNow, when we talk about that, usually\nthough today it's not recommended that\n\n500\n00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:40.840\nyou use this and the reason why\nis because it's all unencrypted.\n\n501\n00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.650\nEverything is sent in plain text.\n\n502\n00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:45.190\nSo, don't do this with any\ntype of secure data or\n\n503\n00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:47.240\nanything that you think provides security.\n\n504\n00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:51.810\nOn this to weather, tap into my line all\nyou want and get the weather all day every\n\n505\n00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:54.410\nday and you're not going\nto hurt my feelings at all.\n\n506\n00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:58.530\nTry and do this with my personally\nidentifiable information.\n\n507\n00:25:58.530 --> 00:25:59.910\nYeah I will hurt you.\n\n508\n00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:00.435\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n509\n00:26:00.435 --> 00:26:01.025\n>> Angry man.\n\n510\n00:26:01.025 --> 00:26:02.042\n>> Angry man, that's right.\n\n511\n00:26:02.042 --> 00:26:03.302\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n512\n00:26:03.302 --> 00:26:04.815\n>> Well, he's absolutely right.\n\n513\n00:26:04.815 --> 00:26:05.675\nTOMA is a great\n\n514\n00:26:05.675 --> 00:26:09.150\nservice that we can use for\ndata that doesn't really matter.\n\n515\n00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:12.130\nIf I just need to gain access to\na system like this one, right?\n\n516\n00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:16.060\nThis cool rainmaker.wunderground.com,\nthey have a server.\n\n517\n00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:18.310\nIt's sitting somewhere\nout there in the world.\n\n518\n00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:20.790\nThey've made it accessible\nby the internet.\n\n519\n00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:24.650\nAnd all I had to do was use\nTelnet to remotely connect to it.\n\n520\n00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:28.820\nI'm actually logging into the server, it\njust doesn't require any authentication,\n\n521\n00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:29.810\nin this case.\n\n522\n00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:32.480\nA lot of normal Telnet\nuse is basically saying,\n\n523\n00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:36.410\nI need to get access to\nthe command line of a server.\n\n524\n00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:38.330\nSo, I turn on a Telnet server there.\n\n525\n00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:42.240\nUse the Telnet client to save\nTelnet to that server's name and\n\n526\n00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.350\nit opens the connection.\n\n527\n00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:46.940\nOf course it does all this over\nunencrypted plain text, that's why you\n\n528\n00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:51.620\nhave to be careful about sending sensitive\ndata over that line but if you're just\n\n529\n00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:55.340\ndoing random things that don't really\nmatter, tell them it's a great service.\n\n530\n00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:58.050\nThey do have a more\nsecure version of this,\n\n531\n00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:00.820\nbasically does the identical same thing,\nit's just encrypted.\n\n532\n00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:05.240\nIt's called SOSage, but I really there\nis no difference other than encryption.\n\n533\n00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:09.010\nWhen it comes to the fact that\nyou are remotely connecting to\n\n534\n00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:11.740\na machine that you're not\nsitting physically at.\n\n535\n00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:13.240\n>> Yeah.\nThe last utility that we really\n\n536\n00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.860\nwanna take a look at here\nis one we call NETSAT.\n\n537\n00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:19.090\nAnd that is to help you verify\nwhat connections are being made\n\n538\n00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:20.610\non your computer.\n\n539\n00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:21.940\nRight then and there.\n\n540\n00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:26.430\nSo, if I go ahead and type in,\nlike net stat dash A, that will give\n\n541\n00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:30.670\nme every single connection that's\nbeing made to my computer right now.\n\n542\n00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:35.180\nAnd you can see, we have UDP connections\nand nothing is actually happening but\n\n543\n00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:39.230\nall these other ones that we see right\nhere that say listening right now well,\n\n544\n00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:43.290\nthose actually mean that a connection\ncan be made at any point in time.\n\n545\n00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:47.510\nIf I just take this, I'm gonna launch\nthis browser in the background and\n\n546\n00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:51.200\nhopefully it's coming back up here and\nlet's do that and then,\n\n547\n00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:56.359\nI'm gonna go to well ITPro.TV and\n\n548\n00:27:56.359 --> 00:27:59.240\nlet that connect in for a moment.\n\n549\n00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.630\nAnd there's our website.\n\n550\n00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:03.100\nSo, if I go back to that\ncommand prompt here.\n\n551\n00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:05.850\nAnd now I run that same command again.\n\n552\n00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:09.280\nYou will see a difference down here\nwhere it actually is telling you\n\n553\n00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.170\nit's established.\n\n554\n00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:15.790\nAnd that means I have now made\na connection to these different locations,\n\n555\n00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:18.500\nthese places on these\nport numbers as well.\n\n556\n00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.010\nAnd this really is telling, right.\n\n557\n00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:24.790\nIt actually shows us that not am\nI just waiting and listening, but\n\n558\n00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:27.850\nI am actually seeing that I\nam established and connected.\n\n559\n00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:31.470\nAnd that way I know if a machine\nis connected to me or not.\n\n560\n00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:32.960\nWe can easily see it here, and\n\n561\n00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:36.470\nthen of course all the other ones\nthat are actually listed there too.\n\n562\n00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:40.980\nNow, if I go ahead and\nclose out of that browser, and\n\n563\n00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:47.130\nthen I run that same command again, notice\nthat we now have the time_wait state.\n\n564\n00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:50.260\nSo, it does give me live\ntime data to actually show,\n\n565\n00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.700\nis this connection happening,\nis it not happening?\n\n566\n00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.030\nTimed way to say look,\nyou're closing it, but\n\n567\n00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:58.390\nI'm still getting a little bit of\ninformation as everything is closing.\n\n568\n00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:01.660\nAnd just once it actually finishes,\nif I run it again you'll probably see that\n\n569\n00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:05.380\neverything goes back to listening\nbecause everything else is closed out.\n\n570\n00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:08.930\nSo, there's a lot of good information\nthat it can show you right here.\n\n571\n00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:13.270\nNow, don't think that just by viewing\nwhat we've actually shown you here.\n\n572\n00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:15.700\nYou know everything that there\nis about these commands.\n\n573\n00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:19.510\nWe really didn't do a lot, except for\njust kind of the most basic commands\n\n574\n00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:21.700\nthat you'll probably encounter\nout there in the field.\n\n575\n00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:23.650\n>> That's right.\nWe're just trying to deep your toe into\n\n576\n00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:27.590\nthe water, get you acclimated to\nthe systems, and networking in general.\n\n577\n00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:30.410\nThat's really what this\ncourse is all about.\n\n578\n00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:34.290\nSo, hopefully, you've seen some cool\nstuff today, and you can use that,\n\n579\n00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:35.560\napply that in your life.\n\n580\n00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:36.620\nAnd figure out, oh!\n\n581\n00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:39.760\nIf you're having networking\nissues at home, maybe, or\n\n582\n00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.920\nmaybe you're at a job and\nyou're wanting to help out in that realm.\n\n583\n00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.920\nHey, you can take some of these tips and\ntricks that we've shown you,\n\n584\n00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.900\nusing these tools, these protocols,\nand apply them to that.\n\n585\n00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:52.800\nMaybe try to help figure out and resolve\na network issue because I'm not lying to\n\n586\n00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:57.300\nyou, when things like Ping and\nIP config, trace route,\n\n587\n00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:01.200\nthings like that, they are what the big\ndogs use to figure out problems.\n\n588\n00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.400\nThey do have more sophisticated tools but\nI guarantee,\n\n589\n00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.710\nthey're still running these tools as well.\n\n590\n00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:09.230\nSo, you learn how to\nuse them very well and\n\n591\n00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:13.150\nyou will be a networking admin before\nlong in some way, shape or form.\n\n592\n00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:16.030\nAll right, Ronnie, is there anything\nelse we need these good people to know?\n\n593\n00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:18.130\n>> Well,\nwhat we want to know of course is that.\n\n594\n00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:19.270\nDon't be afraid of it, right?\n\n595\n00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:22.850\nEven though it requires a little bit of\nlearning, it requires you to do a little\n\n596\n00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:26.360\nbit of typing, examining the information\nand becoming better at it\n\n597\n00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:30.340\nis only going to make you a more skillful\ntechnician in your networking career.\n\n598\n00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:32.370\nAnd it's something that we all need to do.\n\n599\n00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:34.690\nGetting back to the basics\nis not very difficult.\n\n600\n00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:37.280\nYou saw where we're able to\nrun these easy commands but\n\n601\n00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:40.920\nthey are very powerful commands because\nof how much information they reveal.\n\n602\n00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:44.510\nSo, take the time, take a look at\nthe results cause that's what's also\n\n603\n00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:46.900\ngonna help you out is that way you'll\nactually be able to go oh yeah.\n\n604\n00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:48.610\nI think I know what's happening here.\n\n605\n00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:50.160\nAnd then move on to that next step.\n\n606\n00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:53.800\nIt really is good because a lot times\nin networking it's really about\n\n607\n00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.420\nthe troubleshooting that we have to do.\n\n608\n00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:58.090\nthen get things back online,\nand these tools will help you.\n\n609\n00:30:58.090 --> 00:30:59.130\n>> That's right.\nWell said.\n\n610\n00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:01.770\nWell good way to wrap up\na great show we just had.\n\n611\n00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:03.420\nThanks, Ronnie for joining us today.\n\n612\n00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:04.330\nThank you for watching.\n\n613\n00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:06.589\nWe're going to go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n614\n00:31:06.589 --> 00:31:08.134\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n615\n00:31:08.134 --> 00:31:08.926\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n616\n00:31:08.926 --> 00:31:10.451\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n617\n00:31:10.451 --> 00:31:16.680\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

to\nanother exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.180\nI'm your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n5\n00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.870\nJoining me in the studio today is none\nother than my good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:20.700\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.960\n>> It is going great today.\n\n8\n00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.020\nWe are taking a look at the MTA,\nthe Microsoft Technology Associate.\n\n9\n00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.590\nGetting ready for Exam 98366,\nNetworking Fundamentals.\n\n10\n00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.160\nDaniel and I are here to actually put\nthe fun back into networking fundamentals.\n\n11\n00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.670\nSo, what we're starting with today is\ntaking a look at some networking hardware.\n\n12\n00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.440\nNow in previous episodes, we talked\nabout really kind of the basic concepts.\n\n13\n00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.390\nWe understand that what we need of\ncourse are our network addresses\n\n14\n00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.150\non every device that\nwe need to connect to.\n\n15\n00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.390\nSo we spend a bit of time in taking\na look at network addressing.\n\n16\n00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.440\nWe've also taken a look at different\nnetworking services that are out\n\n17\n00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.490\nthere as well.\n\n18\n00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.120\nNow what we're talking about of\ncourse is the infrastructure,\n\n19\n00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.300\nthe hardware that makes\nthe network really work.\n\n20\n00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.980\nAnd today we are focusing in on,\n\n21\n00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.630\nwell switches is what we're\ntaking a look at, Daniel.\n\n22\n00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.420\nSo there's a lot of technology for\nus to actually take a look at, but\n\n23\n00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.820\nswitches is one of those\nfoundational concepts for us, right?\n\n24\n00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.890\n>> Yeah, switches are great.\n\n25\n00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:14.800\nWe love switches.\n\n26\n00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.260\nThey basically build our networks for us.\n\n27\n00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.070\nWe attach all our end devices to them,\nand they say, hey you know what?\n\n28\n00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.330\nIf this computer needs to communicate\nwith that computer, I got you covered.\n\n29\n00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.960\nI'm gonna figure out where that\ninformation's supposed to go, and\n\n30\n00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.960\nsend it to that device.\n\n31\n00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.940\nOh, I've got another one over here,\nnot a problem.\n\n32\n00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:31.850\nUsually there is many,\n\n33\n00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.660\nmany ports in a switch so\nyou can attach a bunch of devices to them.\n\n34\n00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.340\nAnd get them communicating as you need to.\n\n35\n00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.830\nBut that's not the only\nthing that they do.\n\n36\n00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.390\nThey do actually a lot of\nnetworking function for\n\n37\n00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.020\nus in our environments, so\nthat's why we need to understand them.\n\n38\n00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.960\nWe gotta take a look under the hood,\nas it were.\n\n39\n00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.320\nSee how they work,\nunderstand some of the terms and\n\n40\n00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.820\ndefinitions as we talk\nabout switches as well.\n\n41\n00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.810\nSo that you, who is maybe a little\nbit more green than Ronnie and\n\n42\n00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.900\nI, probably not much though [LAUGH],\nare able to understand what's going on\n\n43\n00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.940\nwhat's being talked about, and\nyou're not left out of the loop.\n\n44\n00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.830\nSo that's what we're\nhoping to get you today.\n\n45\n00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.860\nSwitches, so Ronnie, you've dealt\nwith a switch or two, haven't you?\n\n46\n00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.940\n>> I have played around with just a couple\nin my lifetime when we start talking about\n\n47\n00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.560\nswitches, but the easiest thing to\nthink about if you haven't dealt with\n\n48\n00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.490\nswitches at al,l and trying to\nfigure out what the concept is...\n\n49\n00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.190\nWell, the very beginning models\nof networking when they started\n\n50\n00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.620\ncabling them together...\n\n51\n00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.100\nYou know it used to be just simple cables.\n\n52\n00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.970\nThey would run from one\nmachine to another one.\n\n53\n00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.170\nBut then after a while they said,\nlook why don't we run a central cable and\n\n54\n00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.080\nthen everybody will tap into that\ncable and end up being able to work.\n\n55\n00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.430\nWell that became super inefficient.\n\n56\n00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.490\nSo then they came up with little hardware\ndevices then,say look let's just run well\n\n57\n00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.570\nregular connections from each device into\na centralized connectivity device, and\n\n58\n00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.680\nthat little device will\nact as a cable itself.\n\n59\n00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.860\nSo we don't have to run\nthis one long cable.\n\n60\n00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.200\nWe can just run this device we call a hub,\nand that will get us connected.\n\n61\n00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.510\nNow when we actually had something\nlike that that worked perfectly fine,\n\n62\n00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.760\nuntil you had a lot of devices.\n\n63\n00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.980\nAnd when you have a lot of devices,\nthe problem that we had is that,\n\n64\n00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.840\nwe had what were called\nnetwork congestion.\n\n65\n00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.510\nIn other words,\n\n66\n00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.710\nonly one device can actually use\nthat one device at any one time.\n\n67\n00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.540\nSo even though you might have ten or\n15 devices plugged into that hub,\n\n68\n00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.670\nthe problem is it actually is\na one at a time type of usage.\n\n69\n00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.240\nSo one guy's sending, another guy can't\nactually be talking at the same time.\n\n70\n00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.180\nAnd even though it\nmanages it very quickly,\n\n71\n00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.360\nbecause it does it in electrical signals,\nvery quickly within milliseconds.\n\n72\n00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.000\nWell the problems still happen to be that\nas more and more devices got connected,\n\n73\n00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.550\nthe more it really didn't work\nas well as they wanted it to.\n\n74\n00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.560\nSo then newer devices came along, and\n\n75\n00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.500\nthe next device that came along is\nreally what we call the switch itself.\n\n76\n00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.830\nAnd the switch does something different.\n\n77\n00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.780\nUnlike what the hub does which\nis just give us connectivity.\n\n78\n00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.050\nAnd then we have to kind of just let\nthe devices work themselves out.\n\n79\n00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.270\nA switch is a little bit more proactive\nand what a switch says is this.\n\n80\n00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.110\nWhat we're gonna do is I'm gonna actually\nsay as data comes into this port,\n\n81\n00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.930\nI'm gonna forward it out the port\nthat it's supposed to go out, and\n\n82\n00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.890\nnot really mess around with\nthe other ports as well.\n\n83\n00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.950\nSo, that is really what the main\nfunctionality of this switch does for\n\n84\n00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.930\nus, is it really makes decisions.\n\n85\n00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.820\nAnd so if we tie everything\nback to that unusual OSI.\n\n86\n00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.800\nI said unusual,\nit's actually in everything that we have.\n\n87\n00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.760\nWe tie everything back to the foundation\nof networking communications and patterns,\n\n88\n00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.920\nright, and we go back to the OSI model.\n\n89\n00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.170\nA switch is one of the devices\nthat really does operate on\n\n90\n00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.730\none of those different layers.\n\n91\n00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.240\nA switch operates on layer\ntwo of the OSI model.\n\n92\n00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.650\nThe data link layer of that model.\n\n93\n00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.530\nAnd that is actually a key concept for us.\n\n94\n00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.610\nAnd when we talk about that,\nthat actually gives us that idea,\n\n95\n00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.210\nlike why does it have to\noperate on layer two?\n\n96\n00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.930\nIt's because the switch makes its\nforwarding decisions as data's coming in.\n\n97\n00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.460\nHow does it actually choose\nwhat port to go out of?\n\n98\n00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.540\nIt makes its decision of the MAC address\nof what that frame actually says\n\n99\n00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.030\nwhere it's supposed to go.\n\n100\n00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.260\nSo that's why we actually have to\nunderstand that a little bit more.\n\n101\n00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.120\nLet me show you a picture of the switch\nthat I'll be using here today to try and\n\n102\n00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.580\nmake sure that we understand.\n\n103\n00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.500\nThis is actually Don's switch.\n\n104\n00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.580\n>> This one's Don's.\n\n105\n00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.670\n>> So this is a very nice switch here,\nand you have the model number here,\n\n106\n00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.830\nwhich is not super important, but\n\n107\n00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.780\nnotice that switches can come\nin all many varieties and sizes.\n\n108\n00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.440\nThis one's a very nice one\nthat actually has 48 ports.\n\n109\n00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.660\nYeah, so this is a very nice switch\nthat has 48 different ports on them, and\n\n110\n00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.710\nif you actually add them up, there's\n16 over here, 16 here, 16 here, and\n\n111\n00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.560\nthen you also have these\nfour other ports here.\n\n112\n00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.670\nSo if you add them all up,\nthere's actually 52 different ports.\n\n113\n00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.610\nOn this particular switch if you\ncombine everything together.\n\n114\n00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.580\nSo, that's a pretty massive switch,\n\n115\n00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.830\nbecause that means you can actually\ntake each one of those ports and\n\n116\n00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:53.155\nwe can plug some devices that's gonna be\na sending device, or a receiving device,\n\n117\n00:05:53.155 --> 00:05:57.115\nin other words a destination device\ninto it, and this device can manage it.\n\n118\n00:05:57.115 --> 00:06:00.195\nRemember that what a hub does it allows\nyou to plug all of those in, but\n\n119\n00:06:00.195 --> 00:06:05.225\nwhen something sends in there,\nthe other devices hear all that data and\n\n120\n00:06:05.225 --> 00:06:07.565\nthey just decide whether or\nnot it's actually for them or not.\n\n121\n00:06:07.565 --> 00:06:10.015\nAnd if it's not for them,\nthey simply ignore it.\n\n122\n00:06:10.015 --> 00:06:11.960\nBut it goes out all the other ports.\n\n123\n00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.980\nThe switch itself though,\nhere, decides differently.\n\n124\n00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.760\nIt says, look, I know what the destination\nof that frame's supposed to be,\n\n125\n00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.170\ncuz I look at the destination Mac address.\n\n126\n00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.900\nAnd when it does that,\nit doesn't disturb anybody else.\n\n127\n00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.870\nIt looks in a table inside it,\nso there's again,\n\n128\n00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.850\nmemory inside of that device that will\nallow it to make those types of decisions.\n\n129\n00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.640\nNow the way it makes those decisions,\nlet me see if I can bring up my\n\n130\n00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.980\nsimple diagram instead, that will\nkind of help us out, is right here.\n\n131\n00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.400\nSo this is just a more simplified diagram,\n\n132\n00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.960\nit's something that we can\nactually use to help us out.\n\n133\n00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.360\nSo the key concept in the function\nof how a switch does what it does,\n\n134\n00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.880\nIs you have to remember\na couple of things.\n\n135\n00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.100\nOne, it really does,\nit wants to connect two ports together.\n\n136\n00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.680\nThat's really what it's hoping to do.\n\n137\n00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.480\nTwo, the thing that it does that off of,\n\n138\n00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.720\nis based on what we'll\ncall the MAC address.\n\n139\n00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.380\nNow this actually leads\nus to a good point.\n\n140\n00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.610\nA little bit backward,\nbut a good point here.\n\n141\n00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.310\nWhere in the world does\nit get the MAC address\n\n142\n00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:14.740\nof any machine that's sending\ndata into that device?\n\n143\n00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.770\nWell, the Mac address on my PC,\n\n144\n00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:22.160\non anybody's computer, is normally\nattached to the network adapter.\n\n145\n00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.960\nSo the cable that you normally\nplug your computer into,\n\n146\n00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.300\nusually on that device is what\nwe call that hardware address.\n\n147\n00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.280\nSometimes you hear the term\nphysical address, and\n\n148\n00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.280\nthat's what they normally\nsay in Microsoft.\n\n149\n00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.940\nEverywhere else around the world,\nwe call it MAC address,\n\n150\n00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.200\na media access control address as well.\n\n151\n00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.960\nSo you will hear different terminology for\nthis stuff, but\n\n152\n00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.240\njust kinda realize that that's\nthe address that he's taking a look at.\n\n153\n00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.499\nWhen data sent from a device then,\nit's gonna have a source MAC address,\n\n154\n00:07:48.499 --> 00:07:51.397\nit's gonna have a destination\nMAC address on it.\n\n155\n00:07:51.397 --> 00:07:54.685\nSo it actually knows that it's\nsupposed to come from this machine and\n\n156\n00:07:54.685 --> 00:07:56.448\nit's destined for somewhere else.\n\n157\n00:07:56.448 --> 00:07:57.873\nWell, when we send data, and\n\n158\n00:07:57.873 --> 00:08:00.908\nlet's say that my device is plugged\nin here on port number one.\n\n159\n00:08:00.908 --> 00:08:04.106\nWhen I send data internally\ninto that switch,\n\n160\n00:08:04.106 --> 00:08:09.170\nthis is where the switch makes\na decision based on the MAC address.\n\n161\n00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:12.900\nAnd that's why it's no longer a layer\n1 device, which a hub would be.\n\n162\n00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.100\nA hub just says, look, when you send\ndata in, I'm gonna forward it out.\n\n163\n00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.070\nBut a switch says, hey,\nwhen you send data in,\n\n164\n00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:22.710\nI'm gonna take a look at\nthe destination MAC address as well.\n\n165\n00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:25.510\nAnd then I'm going to look it\nup in the table that I have, and\n\n166\n00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:26.840\nif it's listed in there,\n\n167\n00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.760\nI will forward it out to the port that\nmatches what that MAC address says it is.\n\n168\n00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.440\nSo over here on the left hand side,\n\n169\n00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.660\nthe basic functionality\nthat a switch does for us.\n\n170\n00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:40.580\nIt actually makes three decisions,\nokay, of what to do.\n\n171\n00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.060\nAnd that is pretty much the key.\n\n172\n00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:46.690\nWhen a switch gets data that\ncomes into that device, it says,\n\n173\n00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:48.240\nlook, I can forward it out.\n\n174\n00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.810\nIf I can find the MAC address and\n\n175\n00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:52.920\nwhat port it's actually on,\nlet me forward it out on port number 3.\n\n176\n00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.830\nMakes very good sense.\n\n177\n00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:58.170\nNotice that it can also do it\nwhat we call flooding data.\n\n178\n00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:59.560\nAnd what is that about?\n\n179\n00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:04.580\nIf data comes in to port number 1 and\nit's actually saying, look,\n\n180\n00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:08.440\nI don't know where that MAC address is,\nin other words, the switch says, I look at\n\n181\n00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.570\nthe MAC address on your destination and\nI don't have a clue where it is, well,\n\n182\n00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:17.010\nthe switch assumes that you knew what\nyou were doing when you sent it in.\n\n183\n00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:21.230\nBut it says, maybe the other devices just\nhaven't checked in yet, so let me go ahead\n\n184\n00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:25.160\nand send it out every other port\nexcept for the one it came in on.\n\n185\n00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.480\nAnd it will also do that as well.\n\n186\n00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.200\nAnd then lastly, it can say I'm\nnot sending that data anywhere.\n\n187\n00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.750\nIf the MAC address is found\noff of the very same port,\n\n188\n00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:38.880\nthe destination MAC address is on\nthe same port that it came in on,\n\n189\n00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.910\nthat switch automatically says look,\n\n190\n00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:44.490\nthat destination said it's coming back\nto you, but the way that I'm designed,\n\n191\n00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:49.350\nthe way that I'm built, is I don't send\ndata out the same port it arrived in on.\n\n192\n00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.060\nSo I would just simply drop that data.\n\n193\n00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:56.580\nThat's the three basic functions that\nany switch, regardless of whether you're\n\n194\n00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.090\ntalking about, it doesn't matter\nwhat hardware that you go to.\n\n195\n00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.940\nThat's what you actually end up seeing\nwhen you start talking about the idea of\n\n196\n00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:04.990\nswitches.\n\n197\n00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:08.730\nNow, when you then start\ndescribing switches, though,\n\n198\n00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:13.090\nswitches have come a long way since its\nfirst initial days in networking as well.\n\n199\n00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:16.330\nAnd if we go back to this photo,\nif I can get back to that photo here.\n\n200\n00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:20.300\nThis switch is a relatively\nmodern switch that we have, and\n\n201\n00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:24.800\neach of these ports operates on a couple\nof different speeds as well, right?\n\n202\n00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.320\nSo Daniel, we normally have\nas far as modern networks go,\n\n203\n00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:33.070\nwe normally have what we call fast\nethernet ports and gigabit ports, right?\n\n204\n00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:36.860\n>> Yes, yes, and you gotta kind of\nknow the difference between the two.\n\n205\n00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.630\nIf you have a fast ethernet port,\n\n206\n00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:42.030\nthat's normally gonna be running\nat your 100 megabits per second.\n\n207\n00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.620\nThe gig ethernet ports,\nthey're just a little bit faster,\n\n208\n00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:49.740\nusually about 1000 megabits a second,\nright Ronnie?\n\n209\n00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.140\nThey're smoking fast.\n\n210\n00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:55.010\nSo we tend to send data down\nthe correct port, depending on speed.\n\n211\n00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:58.350\nSo if I need a super fast\nlink between some device and\n\n212\n00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:00.890\nanother device,\nI'm probably gonna go with that gig port.\n\n213\n00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:04.570\nIf I just need some good\nspeed with data connectivity,\n\n214\n00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:07.840\nprobably just use one of those\nnormal 100 megabit ports.\n\n215\n00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.410\nAnd that's why it's loaded down\nwith a bunch of 100 megabit ports.\n\n216\n00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:12.370\nBecause, normally,\nthat's about all you ever need.\n\n217\n00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:15.820\nIf you're just sending a couple of files,\nand Ronnie and I's computer are talking,\n\n218\n00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.580\noh, let me send you that spreadsheet.\n\n219\n00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:21.130\nThat's not a lot of data, so\nwe don't need that much bandwidth.\n\n220\n00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:25.350\nBut when we're pumping a bunch of data,\nwe need super fast connectivity.\n\n221\n00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.790\nThis is in large things like\nstorage area networks, right?\n\n222\n00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:33.525\nThey have tons of data that\nare going in and out of that device.\n\n223\n00:11:33.525 --> 00:11:37.255\nSo we've got to connect it to a much\nfaster port giving it the reliability,\n\n224\n00:11:37.255 --> 00:11:40.305\nit's not waiting for the switch to\nhandle the data and get it moved\n\n225\n00:11:40.305 --> 00:11:45.575\nacross the network and before it can\nrequest or write something else to it.\n\n226\n00:11:45.575 --> 00:11:48.315\nSo you just gotta know\nthe difference between the two and\n\n227\n00:11:48.315 --> 00:11:49.575\nfigure out where those are.\n\n228\n00:11:49.575 --> 00:11:52.330\nNormally the faster ports\nare much fewer in number.\n\n229\n00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:53.495\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right, so\n\n230\n00:11:53.495 --> 00:11:55.780\nwhen you start talking about these speeds,\nright?\n\n231\n00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:59.710\nUsually when you have a switch like\nthe one that I just showed you, normally,\n\n232\n00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:01.820\nthat's what we call an access layer or\n\n233\n00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:06.980\na distribution layer switch, which you\nmay have end users PCs attach to them.\n\n234\n00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:10.240\nAnd when we have a lot of 100 megabit\nports that's what we're expecting is\n\n235\n00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.610\nend user devices like PCs and\nworkstations and stuff like that.\n\n236\n00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:15.320\nThey're gonna be attached in that way.\n\n237\n00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:19.010\nBut what if I do have dedicated\nservers on my network, right?\n\n238\n00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:23.000\nThose servers that we talked about in\nprevious courses, like running DHCP,\n\n239\n00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.080\nrunning a terminal server where we can use\nthat remote desktop connection to actually\n\n240\n00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:31.935\nbe able to distribute some of the load,\nthe DNS server to do name resolution.\n\n241\n00:12:31.935 --> 00:12:35.305\nAnd file servers, so\nthat people can access those files.\n\n242\n00:12:35.305 --> 00:12:38.535\nThose are dedicated machines\nthat are designed to allow for\n\n243\n00:12:38.535 --> 00:12:41.085\nmultiple connections at the same time.\n\n244\n00:12:41.085 --> 00:12:45.405\nIf my own machine can connect to that\ndevice at 100 megabits, that's fine.\n\n245\n00:12:45.405 --> 00:12:46.675\nBut what if we actually have 10 or\n\n246\n00:12:46.675 --> 00:12:51.110\n15 people that need to connect to that\nsame server pretty much simultaneously\n\n247\n00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:55.450\nwhile having that gigabit connection\non that other end, on that server side\n\n248\n00:12:55.450 --> 00:13:00.280\nmakes that a lot more hefty, not hefty,\nmakes that a lot more efficient.\n\n249\n00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:04.680\nBecause if I have a gigabit port,\nI can be able to connect, well,\n\n250\n00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.910\nten 100 megabit connections at\nthe same time without any slowdown.\n\n251\n00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:09.150\nNow, can more than that connect?\n\n252\n00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:12.250\nYes they can, but\nthen that's when they start slowing down.\n\n253\n00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:16.010\nSo, being able to offer servers like\nthat the ability to do so is fine.\n\n254\n00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:18.943\nNow, remember that switches though,\nthis one that I showed you earlier, right?\n\n255\n00:13:18.943 --> 00:13:22.594\n48 ports,\nI'm not saying that that's unusual, but\n\n256\n00:13:22.594 --> 00:13:24.700\nyou will find a variety of them.\n\n257\n00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:28.370\nSome of them actually may have\nlike 12 ports or 8 ports on them.\n\n258\n00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:32.670\nSome of them may have 24 ports in\na regular enterprise level type of switch,\n\n259\n00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:35.190\nwhich is what this is, the ones that\nyou actually buy in businesses.\n\n260\n00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.950\nNow, if you buy one of these for home,\nyou can, you can go out there and\n\n261\n00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:38.920\nbuy one of these for home.\n\n262\n00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.860\nBut Daniel, when we plug that power in,\nwhat tends to happen when you plug\n\n263\n00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:45.471\nthe power into this thing and go, yeah,\nI'm gonna set this up in my living room?\n\n264\n00:13:45.471 --> 00:13:49.354\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, it sounds like a Harrier\njump jet is trying to take off in your\n\n265\n00:13:49.354 --> 00:13:51.847\nliving room so\nyou gotta be prepared for that.\n\n266\n00:13:51.847 --> 00:13:56.135\nThey have some super gigantic cooling fans\nthat are in there that ramp up as soon as\n\n267\n00:13:56.135 --> 00:13:57.210\nyou plug it in.\n\n268\n00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:59.130\nSo you might be like woah,\nis this thing exploding?\n\n269\n00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:00.743\nIs there a bomb, the green wire!\n\n270\n00:14:00.743 --> 00:14:02.014\nNo the red!\n\n271\n00:14:02.014 --> 00:14:03.870\nSo don't get alarmed when that happens.\n\n272\n00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:06.900\nYou gotta remember The type of switch\nthat Ronnie's showing you, that is\n\n273\n00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:11.685\nenterprise solution, that is something\nthat's gonna be a mid to a large business.\n\n274\n00:14:11.685 --> 00:14:16.730\nProbably not in a small business, though,\njust because it's overkill for that.\n\n275\n00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:19.510\nThey do, like he said,\nmake much smaller switches,\n\n276\n00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:25.400\nthat don't have as much horsepower as that\none might have, for small businesses.\n\n277\n00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:30.220\nBasically does the same thing, but\nit's unlikely that you need gigabit speed\n\n278\n00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.970\nwhen you only have five computers\nconnected to each other in a small office.\n\n279\n00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:34.480\n>> No doubt.\n\n280\n00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.770\nSo you'll probably not find one of\nthese in that home environment or\n\n281\n00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:40.510\neven that small office environment as\nwell, cuz this thing will be loud.\n\n282\n00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:41.840\nIt's constantly working, right?\n\n283\n00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.020\nIf my devices are connected,\n\n284\n00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.350\nconnecting to the Internet, it's\nhaving to constantly do the switching.\n\n285\n00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:49.130\nSo even though it will ramp\ndown after a few moments,\n\n286\n00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:53.030\nright, you will actually still hear it\nrunning a lot of times in the background.\n\n287\n00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:57.100\nAnd the more devices you plug into it, the\nmore it's gonna continuously run as well.\n\n288\n00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:00.910\nAnd that means you're gonna ramp those\nfans up and keep it running, too.\n\n289\n00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:03.760\nSo understand that you will\nfind a variety of them.\n\n290\n00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.920\nThere's also other things that you can\ndo as well, with the switchboards.\n\n291\n00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.840\nNow let's go back and\ntake a look at my picture here.\n\n292\n00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:15.229\nAnd I wanna point out those four other\nports on the right hand side over\n\n293\n00:15:15.229 --> 00:15:16.600\nhere too.\n\n294\n00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.870\nSometimes you'll also see these ports, and\n\n295\n00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:22.890\nyou can use them on the other ports, but\nthis is what Daniel was referring to as\n\n296\n00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:27.660\na lot fewer ports when we have these\nhigher speeds like gigabyte ports, right?\n\n297\n00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:31.630\nSo these other 48 ports over here, let's\nsay that they are 100 megabit ports, so\n\n298\n00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:34.980\nI can have up to 48 different connections,\nwhich is perfectly great.\n\n299\n00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:39.690\nNow, over here I have these four\ngigabit connection ports instead.\n\n300\n00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:42.610\nNow, they do separate them\noff because they're not\n\n301\n00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:45.470\nreally expecting you to use them\nto connect to workstations.\n\n302\n00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:46.170\nNow can you?\nYeah,\n\n303\n00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:48.530\nyou can do it every day of\nthe week if you want to.\n\n304\n00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:52.396\nBut what they're expecting is that what\nmay happen in your business, is as your\n\n305\n00:15:52.396 --> 00:15:56.048\nbusiness continues to grow, is you may\nchoose to buy another one of these.\n\n306\n00:15:56.048 --> 00:15:59.740\nAnd then, you can actually put it directly\non top of it inside of that server rack.\n\n307\n00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.387\nYou may buy another one and\nanother one and another one.\n\n308\n00:16:02.387 --> 00:16:07.011\nAnd what they want you to be able to\ndo is to be able to treat all of those\n\n309\n00:16:07.011 --> 00:16:11.740\nswitches as if they actually can be\none big switch if you want them to.\n\n310\n00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:18.030\nAnd so these ports are generally used for\nconnections even between switches.\n\n311\n00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:19.000\nAnd when you actually do that,\n\n312\n00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.570\nthey're also called what we call\nuplink ports, because that allows for\n\n313\n00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:27.230\ndata traffic between the switches to\nhave a very high speed connection.\n\n314\n00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:31.340\nAnd that is what they're really hoping for\non what we call uplink ports too.\n\n315\n00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:35.230\nUplink ports and regular old ports\nlike what we see here on this switch,\n\n316\n00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:37.730\nthey really can be treated\nexactly identical.\n\n317\n00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.440\nIf I didn't want to use those as\nuplink ports, I don't have to.\n\n318\n00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.500\nI can choose a port over here\non the left-hand side and\n\n319\n00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.020\nmake 100 megabit uplink, if I wanted to.\n\n320\n00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:49.420\nBut if I knew that a lot of data\nwas going between those switches,\n\n321\n00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:51.490\nthat's where my bottleneck\nwould actually come in.\n\n322\n00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:54.320\nIf I actually chose 100 megabit\nport versus one that can\n\n323\n00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.930\nhandle ten times the traffic instead.\n\n324\n00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:00.750\nSo on these switches, you do have\nthat ability to make sure you do so.\n\n325\n00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:04.320\nBut just kind of, remember it really does\nreduce the number of connections that you\n\n326\n00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:05.750\nmake if you're doing a lot of uplinks.\n\n327\n00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:09.350\nSo that's why they tend to separate them\noff on these types of enterprise level\n\n328\n00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:12.760\nswitches when we start taking\nadvantage of that too.\n\n329\n00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.160\nSo just kind of realize as we\nkind of do a brief review, right?\n\n330\n00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:20.160\nSo we have fast Ethernet ports and gigabit\nEthernet ports, is that the end of it?\n\n331\n00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.750\nYou better believe not, there are switches\nout there that can cost tens of thousands\n\n332\n00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:29.950\nof dollars, and they can actually have\nwhat we'll call ten gigabit ports.\n\n333\n00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:33.810\nAnd when you think about that,\nright, if a gigabit port can handle\n\n334\n00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:38.890\nwell ten 100 megabit connections,\na ten gig port is ten times that.\n\n335\n00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:44.410\nSo one of those ports can actually support\nup to 100, 100 megabit connections,\n\n336\n00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:48.040\nand that is when you start\ngetting to the nth degree, right?\n\n337\n00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:51.550\nOf course, the faster that those devices\nare, the more ports that you have on that\n\n338\n00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:54.910\ndevice, the more expensive\nthese devices are gonna be.\n\n339\n00:17:54.910 --> 00:18:00.240\nBut regardless of the size, it really\ncan do three basic functions, right?\n\n340\n00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:04.890\nThe affording directly from the source\nto destination port that it needs to.\n\n341\n00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:07.358\nIt can go ahead and\nalso filter that data out, or\n\n342\n00:18:07.358 --> 00:18:10.740\nit can flood it across the entire\nswitch if it needs to.\n\n343\n00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:14.210\nAnd what makes this different is that\nit does it based on the MAC address.\n\n344\n00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:17.240\nSo you've got to remember that,\nand it is also on layer two.\n\n345\n00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:22.370\nSo there's a lot of just basic\nknowledge that when you encounter it as\n\n346\n00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:26.580\na professional in the field, this device,\nit doesn't look like it does much.\n\n347\n00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.430\nYou look and go, yeah, big deal.\n\n348\n00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:29.590\nBut in the background,\n\n349\n00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:33.380\nit is really kind of the heart of what\nwe'll call our local area network.\n\n350\n00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:37.160\nAll of our devices inside of our LAN,\ninside of our network,\n\n351\n00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.990\ntends to be connected\nto something like this.\n\n352\n00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:39.660\n>> That's right.\n\n353\n00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:43.660\nNow, Ronnie, I had mentioned earlier\nabout smaller switches, and of course,\n\n354\n00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:44.400\nwe've got these nice,\n\n355\n00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.550\nlovely Cisco switches like your showing\na picture of Enterprise level stuff.\n\n356\n00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:50.470\nThere's a lot of times,\n\n357\n00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:54.000\nthis really does come down to\na major difference between the two.\n\n358\n00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.510\nObviously, one is going to be price,\nthe small it is and the less it does,\n\n359\n00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:58.840\nit's gonna cost you less money.\n\n360\n00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:02.200\nYou can definitely run down to BestBuy and\ngrab a four port or\n\n361\n00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.370\neight port switch, probably won't\ncost you very much money at all.\n\n362\n00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:07.230\nSomething like that Cisco switch,\n\n363\n00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:10.890\nespecially when they're brand new,\nthey will run quite a bit more money.\n\n364\n00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:13.470\nBut that's not the only real difference.\n\n365\n00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:16.670\nPort density as well, but\nmanaged versus unmanaged,\n\n366\n00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:20.700\nwhat you can do with it,\nhow much control you have over it.\n\n367\n00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.200\nThat's one of the big\ndifferences between smaller and\n\n368\n00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.410\nlarger Enterprise switches, right?\n\n369\n00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:26.000\n>> There is no doubt about that.\n\n370\n00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.250\nThe ones that you tend to buy\nin places like stores, and\n\n371\n00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:32.250\nthey're little 8 port switches or\n12 port switches.\n\n372\n00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:35.680\nMost of those are not going to be where\nyou can go inside and configure it for\n\n373\n00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:36.650\nsecurity.\n\n374\n00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:40.690\nThey're not going to be able so that you\ncan go inside of that device to be able to\n\n375\n00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:45.040\nconfigure it, to lock it down if you\nneed to, or to turn certain ports off.\n\n376\n00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:48.270\nSo when you actually get that,\nwhen you buy one of those, you just simply\n\n377\n00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.770\nplug it in, and the only thing that it\nreally does, right, those simple switches,\n\n378\n00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:56.490\nare those three things, right, the\nforwarding, the idea here of flooding or\n\n379\n00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:59.780\nthe idea of blocking what actually\nis going to go out on that.\n\n380\n00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:02.460\nBut there's a lot more that can be\ndone when you start talking about\n\n381\n00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:06.610\nEnterprise level switches, and it requires\nyou to go inside of that device to\n\n382\n00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:08.740\nmanage it when you start taking a look.\n\n383\n00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.760\nSo let me show you an example\nof what we're talking about.\n\n384\n00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.690\nSo on my screen, I've actually\nmade a connection to a switch.\n\n385\n00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:16.965\nAnd actually this switch is out\nthere on the Internet somewhere.\n\n386\n00:20:16.965 --> 00:20:19.700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I made a connection to this switch.\n\n387\n00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:21.890\nAnd when I make that\nconnection to the switch,\n\n388\n00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:24.030\nI'm actually able to send commands.\n\n389\n00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:26.680\nSo even across the Internet,\nI'm able to send commands to it.\n\n390\n00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.130\nBut why is this important for\nan Enterprise?\n\n391\n00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.540\nBecause what we can do is\nwe can take that switch and\n\n392\n00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.690\nmanage it the way that we need it to work.\n\n393\n00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:36.420\nIn other words, we can configure\nit the way that we need to.\n\n394\n00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:40.270\nWhen we start talking about the\nconfiguration, I can actually go in and\n\n395\n00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:42.830\nI can do a global configuration.\n\n396\n00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:46.090\nThis makes changes to\nthe entire switch itself.\n\n397\n00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:52.280\nOr I can also enter in to\na single port like this and\n\n398\n00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:56.880\nmake a configuration that only makes\na change on one single port if I want to\n\n399\n00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:02.060\nas long as I know what those commands are,\nand I know how to manipulate the switch.\n\n400\n00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.940\nNow if you don't know you're probably\nlike, oh, this is getting way too deep.\n\n401\n00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:07.150\nThat's why we're not really getting so\ndeep into it.\n\n402\n00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:09.470\nBut what we're trying to\nshow you is you can do that.\n\n403\n00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:11.780\nIf I need to turn off a port,\nI definitely can.\n\n404\n00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:13.550\nIf I need to turn one on, I can.\n\n405\n00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:17.190\nIf I need to configure security\non that port, I can do that, and\n\n406\n00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:20.780\njust on that one port and\nnot on the entire switch as well.\n\n407\n00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:25.270\nSo there's a lot that you can do here, and\nthis is why Enterprises love this thing,\n\n408\n00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:28.760\nbecause we really do have all\nthe control that we need.\n\n409\n00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:31.867\nIn most of the small office, home office\nenvironments that you tend to see that\n\n410\n00:21:31.867 --> 00:21:35.163\nhave little eight port switches or even\nless, right, the only thing that they're\n\n411\n00:21:35.163 --> 00:21:38.830\nworried about is they're trying to make\nsure that they have enough connections.\n\n412\n00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:42.750\nSo what you might see in a small office\nenvironment is from the wireless router,\n\n413\n00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:46.295\nyou might see four ports on the back and\nfour plugs actually,\n\n414\n00:21:46.295 --> 00:21:48.590\nfour connections plugged\ndirectly into that.\n\n415\n00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:52.190\nOr what you might see is one port\nplugged into a little eight port switch.\n\n416\n00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:54.950\nThat's because there are just\nnot enough physical ports there.\n\n417\n00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:58.960\nSo if you're only looking for\nmore connections, a simple switch,\n\n418\n00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.150\nan unmanaged switch is enough.\n\n419\n00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:04.670\nIf you know you need to control the\ntraffic, and you need to better manage it,\n\n420\n00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:08.010\nthis is when you actually start\ngoing to these other devices too.\n\n421\n00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:10.660\nNow this is not the only way that you\ncan tend to manage it even though I've\n\n422\n00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:12.070\nconnected it across the Internet.\n\n423\n00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:15.020\nThere's a way that you can\nmanage this device directly and\n\n424\n00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:18.690\nlet me see if I can pull that\npicture up for us as well.\n\n425\n00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:21.520\nThere's a way I do that.\n\n426\n00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:22.440\nLet me see.\nThere we go.\n\n427\n00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.940\nOkay.\nLet me go all the way over here, okay?\n\n428\n00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.140\nAnd this is the picture\nthat I'm looking for.\n\n429\n00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:29.230\nIf we wanna talk about\nmanaging the switch,\n\n430\n00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:30.360\nthere's two things you really need.\n\n431\n00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.500\nFirst is power, okay?\n\n432\n00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:35.856\nOnce you actually get power up, the device\nis gonna boot up, and you're fine, and\n\n433\n00:22:35.856 --> 00:22:38.610\nsecondly, you need what we\ncall is a console cable.\n\n434\n00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:43.250\nAnd I do have an example of\na console cable right here as well.\n\n435\n00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:45.205\nNow, most of the time on the Cisco switch,\n\n436\n00:22:45.205 --> 00:22:48.840\nthey tend to send one of\nthese with the device, okay?\n\n437\n00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.880\nSo usually this is kind of light\nblue in color that you have.\n\n438\n00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:56.470\nAnd then on one end, it really does plug\ninto that port, and it's called a console.\n\n439\n00:22:56.470 --> 00:23:00.540\nAnd this is just a regular\nnetwork jack plug that we have,\n\n440\n00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:03.560\nan RJ45 connector is what\nyou tend to see there.\n\n441\n00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:08.460\nYou plug that device in, and the other\nend, let's see if I can actually unscrew\n\n442\n00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:14.710\nthis thing very quickly here, the other\nend of it is more of a legacy connection.\n\n443\n00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:19.630\nAnd that is this old serial port\nconnection that we would have, and\n\n444\n00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:24.080\non most of the older PCs,\nyou still have these ports around.\n\n445\n00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:28.120\nAnd that allows you to plug a PC\ndirectly into this switch here.\n\n446\n00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:31.370\nAnd now you need a third piece,\nwhich is some type of software\n\n447\n00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:34.970\nthat will allow you to make\na connection into the switch as well.\n\n448\n00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:37.510\nSo when you have that plugged up,\nwell, you can do that.\n\n449\n00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:42.300\nWell, the problem is, like today on my\nlaptop, there are no serial ports, so\n\n450\n00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:48.190\nyou also need another device here, and\nthis is a USB to serial port adapter.\n\n451\n00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:50.416\nAnd then it just kinda fits right in.\n\n452\n00:23:50.416 --> 00:23:53.820\nAnd if you get the right driver\nattached to your computer and\n\n453\n00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:57.223\nyou have the software,\nit allows you to gain access in, and\n\n454\n00:23:57.223 --> 00:24:02.018\nwhat you end up seeing from that point is\nsomething that looks very similar to this.\n\n455\n00:24:02.018 --> 00:24:06.208\nAnd then from that point as long as you\nknow what those commands are to access in\n\n456\n00:24:06.208 --> 00:24:10.250\nto do what you need to,\nyou're more than set up and ready to go.\n\n457\n00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:13.820\nSo that console port is very important\nat the very beginning of the setup\n\n458\n00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:15.980\nthat we have access to.\n\n459\n00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:19.140\nBut after that, once it's set up,\nyou can now configure it and\n\n460\n00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.080\nthen get access to it from the network.\n\n461\n00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.060\nAnd that's what they've\ndone right here is,\n\n462\n00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:26.540\nI don't have to have a super long\ncable to wherever this device is.\n\n463\n00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:28.650\nI now can access it from\nacross the network.\n\n464\n00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:30.900\nAnd like we said, this one's actually\nout there on the Internet somewhere.\n\n465\n00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:33.590\n>> That's right, you gotta remember\nthat they are network devices.\n\n466\n00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:38.090\nThey eventually want you to be able to\naccess it through a network connection.\n\n467\n00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:41.240\nNow the console port is there for a good\nreason because once you get a switch it\n\n468\n00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:46.350\nhas no configuration on it,\nthere is no networked understanding yet.\n\n469\n00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:49.480\nIt doesn't realize,\nall it's saying is, I'm a switch and\n\n470\n00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.720\nI wanna switch packets,\nor frames, should I say.\n\n471\n00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.160\nI wanna switch these frames,\n\n472\n00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.580\njust show me where they're at,\nI'm gonna send them to the right place.\n\n473\n00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:59.300\nI wanna learn what's on my network,\nwhat's connected to me.\n\n474\n00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:03.080\nAnd get that connectivity going on, so\nwe do have to do a little bit of setup, so\n\n475\n00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.490\nthat's what the console port is there.\n\n476\n00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:07.720\nAnd then if we ever lose network\nconnectivity to it, we're not\n\n477\n00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:12.320\nout in the weeds, we don't have no way, or\nwe don't have any way to access the port.\n\n478\n00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.685\nI must speak proper English today.\n\n479\n00:25:13.685 --> 00:25:16.750\n[LAUGH] And I can use that console cable,\n\n480\n00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:20.010\ngo ahead, plug into that sucker,\nand gain access to it that way.\n\n481\n00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:23.380\nMake my configuration changes, get it\nworking the way it's supposed to work.\n\n482\n00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.510\nMaybe I accidentally put\nin a wrong IP address.\n\n483\n00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:28.150\nThat kind of thing happens all\nthe time with a managed switch.\n\n484\n00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:31.370\nYou just tend to fat finger stuff and\nit breaks the entire thing, and\n\n485\n00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:35.370\nyou gotta dig out your console cable and\nmake a connection and get back into there.\n\n486\n00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:39.300\nNow Ronnie, when it comes to managing\nswitches, probably one of the main go to\n\n487\n00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:44.280\nthings that we do with it is setup VLANs,\nvirtual local area connection.\n\n488\n00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:47.200\nNow, I know you were talking\nabout how the switch is\n\n489\n00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:52.070\nthe heart of a local area connection,\nbut what the heck is a VLAN and\n\n490\n00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:53.920\nhow do we use a switch to work with them?\n\n491\n00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:58.015\n>> Sure, when we start taking a look at\nthe idea of VLANs here, just briefly,\n\n492\n00:25:58.015 --> 00:26:00.550\nlet's go ahead and\nreview just a little bit and\n\n493\n00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:02.963\nthen we'll get into VLAN substance again.\n\n494\n00:26:02.963 --> 00:26:06.743\nSo remember that the basic function of\nthe switch, right, so on my screen here,\n\n495\n00:26:06.743 --> 00:26:09.150\nI've got the diagram that\nwe were just looking at.\n\n496\n00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:11.320\nHow it actually functions,\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n497\n00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:15.430\nIf you have a 48 port switch, remember,\nyou can actually connect all 48 ports in,\n\n498\n00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:19.280\nbut when you do so\nthe logical side of that is this, okay?\n\n499\n00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.930\nIs that all of those devices\nconnect to that switch.\n\n500\n00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:25.510\nThey have to be on the same IP network.\n\n501\n00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:29.780\nSo, all 40 of those ports have\nto be on that same IP network.\n\n502\n00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:35.090\nSo when I do that, that's perfectly fine,\nif I only have one IP network.\n\n503\n00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:40.200\nNow, if I had plugged in a second switch\nthough, that means that all the devices\n\n504\n00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:45.848\non that second switch also have to\nbe on a separate IP network as well.\n\n505\n00:26:45.848 --> 00:26:51.070\nThen I plug in a third one,\nthey have to be on another IP network too.\n\n506\n00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:55.360\nNow when we start doing that then,\nwhy is there an uplink between them?\n\n507\n00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.390\nWhy would I ever want to\nactually uplink that way?\n\n508\n00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:03.117\nWell the problem that we have is\nfairly simple, the uplink wouldn't\n\n509\n00:27:03.117 --> 00:27:07.762\nactually matter at all unless there\nwas a way that what you could do,\n\n510\n00:27:07.762 --> 00:27:10.859\nis you could take that\none physical switch and\n\n511\n00:27:10.859 --> 00:27:15.124\nbe able to actually logically\nmanage it with other switches.\n\n512\n00:27:15.124 --> 00:27:17.212\nSo that you can mix\nthose ports together and\n\n513\n00:27:17.212 --> 00:27:19.850\nput them on the same\nnetwork if you need to.\n\n514\n00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:22.170\nSo that's what has to\nhappen at times here.\n\n515\n00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:25.750\nSo the way that we do that is now\nif I link these two together,\n\n516\n00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:29.470\nis there a possibility, let me see if\nI can actually stretch that out, and\n\n517\n00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:30.700\nthen we'll actually kind of do it.\n\n518\n00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:32.550\nYeah, that actually does\na little bit better here.\n\n519\n00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:37.680\nNow let's say that, wow, I went from\ngigantic to gigantic, didn't I?\n\n520\n00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:38.690\nThere we go.\n\n521\n00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:40.750\nSo, let's say that we do this.\n\n522\n00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:46.070\nWe take one of these ports and\nwe now use this as our uplink, right?\n\n523\n00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:48.320\nSo that allows them to connect together.\n\n524\n00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:53.980\nBut what if I wanted to see\nif I can actually treat\n\n525\n00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:59.560\nthese as if they're actually\ntogether on the same switch,\n\n526\n00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:01.850\neven though they're actually\non different switches?\n\n527\n00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:06.280\nCan I do the same thing with this one?\n\n528\n00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.433\nOop, wow,\nI really chose the wrong one there.\n\n529\n00:28:08.433 --> 00:28:09.002\n>> Good job, Ronnie.\n\n530\n00:28:09.002 --> 00:28:12.240\n>> Yeah, I'd have thought I was picking\nthe right one, the same one here.\n\n531\n00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.280\nSo, oh dang.\n\n532\n00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:17.070\nMy pencil drawing ability\nis obviously not good.\n\n533\n00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.300\nSo if I wanted to do,\nlet's say, these two.\n\n534\n00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:24.810\nAnd put them on a separate\nnetwork as well.\n\n535\n00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:29.490\nCan I do that, even though they're\nactually on different physical switches?\n\n536\n00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:34.460\nYou can, because what VLANs\nallow us to do is to logically\n\n537\n00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:39.270\nbreak that switch up, actually break\nmultiple switches up where I can do that.\n\n538\n00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:39.830\nSo I went ahead and\n\n539\n00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:44.890\nmade a quick little diagram right here\nto kind of show us that same concept.\n\n540\n00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:51.780\nSo, in theory, I can take a single\nswitch and I can segment it off.\n\n541\n00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:55.760\nAnd when I do so, it treats it as\nits own little independent switch.\n\n542\n00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:02.609\nSo, I can put this on a single VLAN\nhere and call that one VLAN 1.\n\n543\n00:29:02.609 --> 00:29:05.280\nActually, not VLAN 1 let's do VLAN 10.\n\n544\n00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:09.588\nCuz VLAN 1 can be special, so\nI don't wanna confuse anybody.\n\n545\n00:29:09.588 --> 00:29:14.093\nSo let's, [NOISE] I don't want\nanybody to see what I'm typing either.\n\n546\n00:29:14.093 --> 00:29:17.488\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah I'm a genius.\n\n547\n00:29:17.488 --> 00:29:20.740\nAll right, so VLAN one, so let's do that.\n\n548\n00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:23.990\nNow if I have,\nI just did it again, VLAN 10.\n\n549\n00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:30.890\nWell if I go ahead and I make VLAN 10,\nlet's just give it, assign it a color.\n\n550\n00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:36.140\nWell that works, but I can also if\nthese things are now uplinked together.\n\n551\n00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:41.070\nI can also take that same VLAN and\nconfigure that, but\n\n552\n00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:46.070\nactually make it let's say on,\nwell, these two ports instead, so\n\n553\n00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:47.890\nthat they are now logically grouped.\n\n554\n00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:49.780\nEw, that's not what I wanted to do.\n\n555\n00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:50.690\nWhat was I trying to do there?\n\n556\n00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:56.080\nAll right, so my ability to do anything\nthat I wanted to do on that, there we go.\n\n557\n00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.840\nTo actually make VLAN 10 spread\nacross multiple switches.\n\n558\n00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.880\nSo that way when we are managing these,\n\n559\n00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:06.440\nthese two can actually be on\ndifferent physical switches but\n\n560\n00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:10.690\nthey're treated as if they're on\nthe same local area network instead.\n\n561\n00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:14.560\nNow implementing VLANs like\nthis is fairly simple to do but\n\n562\n00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:17.290\nthat's what VLANs\nactually allow you to do.\n\n563\n00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:20.050\nAnd so now you can actually\ndo that on one switch.\n\n564\n00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:22.640\nIf you had a 48 port switch like\nwhat I was showing you before.\n\n565\n00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.870\nLet's see if I can actually\nget back to the switch.\n\n566\n00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:28.090\nWell maybe, I know I can do this.\n\n567\n00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:30.690\nIt's me working with a Mac\nis actually the program.\n\n568\n00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:31.750\nSo I can do this,\n\n569\n00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:35.880\nwhere I can take let's say six of these\nports over here on the left-hand side and\n\n570\n00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.830\nfour of them over here, and\nput them on their own separate VLAN.\n\n571\n00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:42.820\nAnd then I can do the same thing\nwith other ports that I want to.\n\n572\n00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:46.470\nAnd so, VLANs really allow us\nto do two separate things then.\n\n573\n00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:50.940\nOn a single switch, it allows me to\nlogically chop that switch up so\n\n574\n00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:54.370\nI can treat it as if there are smaller\nmultiple switches in between them.\n\n575\n00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:56.860\nBut then if I actually\nadd in multiple switches,\n\n576\n00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:00.000\nI can spread those VLANs\nacross those switches.\n\n577\n00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.830\nAnd now I can actually take\na single VLAN and make it well,\n\n578\n00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:05.070\nacross multiple switches as well.\n\n579\n00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:08.035\nSo it allows me to be able to\ncreate the networks than I need to,\n\n580\n00:31:08.035 --> 00:31:12.495\neven though I might be limited by one\nswitch, or maybe I have existing switches\n\n581\n00:31:12.495 --> 00:31:15.865\nout there that have separate VLANs, but\nI want to put them all on the same VLAN.\n\n582\n00:31:15.865 --> 00:31:18.545\nYou have to go out and\nbuy a bigger switch,\n\n583\n00:31:18.545 --> 00:31:22.605\none that holds 96 ports or\none that holds 256 ports?\n\n584\n00:31:22.605 --> 00:31:23.450\nNo.\n\n585\n00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:25.560\nI simply uplink them together, and\n\n586\n00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:28.700\nthen I create my VLANs that will\nactually spread across both of them and\n\n587\n00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:32.020\nthen put them on the VLANs I want to,\nand I'm off and I'm ready to go.\n\n588\n00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:34.760\nSo VLAN technology is\none of the main reasons\n\n589\n00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.100\nwhy we do actually want to use switches.\n\n590\n00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:39.150\n>> Yeah, VLANs makes switches awesome.\n\n591\n00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:43.230\nThat's going to be the official\nanswer on the exam.\n\n592\n00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:44.850\nWhat do switches do?\n\n593\n00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:46.985\nWell, they have VLANs and\nit makes them awesome, so\n\n594\n00:31:46.985 --> 00:31:48.560\nthat's the interesting part [LAUGH].\n\n595\n00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:49.220\n>> Yeah, I like that,\n\n596\n00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:51.790\nexcept it may not be-\n>> It's probably\n\n597\n00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:55.140\nnot going to be worded that way,\nbut something similar.\n\n598\n00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:56.020\n>> Yeah, something close.\n\n599\n00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:58.516\n>> Well, you know what's funny though, you\nthink why would I even want to do that?\n\n600\n00:31:58.516 --> 00:32:01.981\nAnd it all boils down to the fact\nthat I might have users on three\n\n601\n00:32:01.981 --> 00:32:03.840\ndifferent floors, right?\n\n602\n00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.800\nI might have some research guys\nthat are up on the third floor,\n\n603\n00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.700\nmaybe I have a couple of them\nthat are down on the first floor.\n\n604\n00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:10.480\nHow do I get them,\n\n605\n00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:14.720\nkeep their traffic separate from all\nthe other departments that I have?\n\n606\n00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:15.990\nThat's what switches do for us.\n\n607\n00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:19.680\nThey separate some traffic\nusing those VLANs so\n\n608\n00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:23.190\nI don't have to worry about competing for\ntraffic or ports or anything.\n\n609\n00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:24.740\nI assign the ports and say, that's for\n\n610\n00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:28.810\nmy research guys, whether it's on\nthe first floor or the third floor switch.\n\n611\n00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:32.540\nThey all can connect into the correct\nport and they're on the correct VLAN and\n\n612\n00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:35.080\nthey talk to each other,\nthat's why we like VLANs so much.\n\n613\n00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:38.290\n>> There's no doubt, Daniel, putting\ncontext to anything that I'm describing,\n\n614\n00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:38.800\nshame on you.\n\n615\n00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.270\n[LAUGH] That's really what we really need,\nright?\n\n616\n00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:43.964\nWe need to understand why we\nwould use them as well and\n\n617\n00:32:43.964 --> 00:32:46.059\nDaniel gives a perfect example of that.\n\n618\n00:32:46.059 --> 00:32:50.300\nThe very fact is we may have multiple\ndivisions inside multiple departments.\n\n619\n00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.070\nBut I only have one physical switch?\n\n620\n00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:53.510\nWell I don't just sit there and go, sorry,\n\n621\n00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:55.610\nwell you're gonna have to deal\nwith the excess of traffic.\n\n622\n00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:58.250\nInstead we can go in there,\nwe can configure different VLANs for\n\n623\n00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:01.240\nthem, and that way their traffic\nis not seen by anybody else,\n\n624\n00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.420\neven though they're on\nthe same physical switch.\n\n625\n00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:07.820\nOr, if we are adding in new departments\nand they already are preconfigured on\n\n626\n00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:11.600\ntheir switch to do whatever they want to,\nwell we simply link them up.\n\n627\n00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:12.850\nAnd then we can actually go ahead and\nsay, hey,\n\n628\n00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:16.670\nlook, your VLAN's now gonna be\nrecognized across my switch as well.\n\n629\n00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:19.250\nAnd that's fine, cuz then we can\nadd in whatever we want to, so\n\n630\n00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:21.070\nit makes management much easier.\n\n631\n00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:24.770\nThe key here though is remember,\nthis can only be done on managed switches.\n\n632\n00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:26.740\nYou're not gonna be able to take\na little eight port switch that\n\n633\n00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:29.840\nyou can't get access to and\ntry and do VLANs on them.\n\n634\n00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:30.930\nThey're not gonna let you do it.\n\n635\n00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:33.500\n>> Yep, all right, Ronnie,\nI'm taking a look at our clock here.\n\n636\n00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.690\nEven though we have a whole lot more to\ntalk about when it comes to switches,\n\n637\n00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:39.010\nwe have no more time left on this episode.\n\n638\n00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:41.170\nLooks like we're gonna have to\ndo a part two but [CROSSTALK]\n\n639\n00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:41.810\n>> Who would have guessed?\n\n640\n00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:43.910\nYeah, I mean, who would have guessed\nthat we would do a part two?\n\n641\n00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:44.860\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's our favorite thing.\n\n642\n00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:46.950\nSo hopefully we'll see you guys there.\n\n643\n00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:50.220\nRonnie, thank you for these demonstrations\nand we will see you in part two as well.\n\n644\n00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:51.570\n>> We will.\n>> Hopefully we'll see you there.\n\n645\n00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:52.349\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n646\n00:33:52.349 --> 00:33:54.940\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n647\n00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:55.600\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n648\n00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:56.806\n>> And we'll see you next

--> 00:00:14.960\nWelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.090\nI'm your host Daniel Lowery,\njoining me yet again is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.620\nHow's it going today Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.156\n>> It is going great today we\nare continuing to take a look at MTA,\n\n8\n00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:27.790\nthe Microsoft Technology Associate,\ngetting ready for that exam 98366.\n\n9\n00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.150\nThe Networking Fundamentals exam.\n\n10\n00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.880\nSo if you are preparing for\nthat exam you are in the right place.\n\n11\n00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.410\nWe are taking a look more\nat the switches again.\n\n12\n00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.788\nWe already had a part one to this\nlittle mini series that we've had.\n\n13\n00:00:41.788 --> 00:00:45.020\nWhere we talked about the basic\nfunctionality of what switches are, and\n\n14\n00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.600\nof course how they work, just briefly.\n\n15\n00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.130\nBut we also need to take a look at some of\nthese other things that we have to know\n\n16\n00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.670\nabout switches,\nif we're going to be working with them.\n\n17\n00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.740\nAnd there is no doubt that as you\nenter into the world of IT and\n\n18\n00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.000\nas you become a network technician.\n\n19\n00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.960\nSwitches are going to be that, the heart\nof a lot of the things that you see.\n\n20\n00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.460\nThe nice thing about it though\nis that the majority of it.\n\n21\n00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.400\nIf somebody else is handling it,\nyou really don't have to worry about it.\n\n22\n00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.490\nIt's usually one of those devices\nthat you just have to set and forget.\n\n23\n00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:14.980\nAnd then it works perfectly.\n\n24\n00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.220\nBut as a technician, though,\nit shouldn't scare you.\n\n25\n00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.410\nIt should be something that you go, okay,\n\n26\n00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.640\nI understand at least\nthe basic functionalities.\n\n27\n00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.970\nAnd that's what we really want to get\ninto when we start taking a look at\n\n28\n00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.180\nunderstanding switches today.\n\n29\n00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.780\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n30\n00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.680\nSwitches are not scary.\n\n31\n00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.550\nActually, I find them quite fun and\nsoothing.\n\n32\n00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.878\nBecause you get to hammer away at them,\n\n33\n00:01:30.878 --> 00:01:33.533\nmake them do stuff that you want them to\ndo and it's really cool cuz it looks like\n\n34\n00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:35.157\nyou know a whole lot of\nstuff about networking.\n\n35\n00:01:35.157 --> 00:01:38.068\nBecause, well if you're messing\nwith a switch you probably\n\n36\n00:01:38.068 --> 00:01:40.930\nat least know a little bit, and\nit makes our networks work.\n\n37\n00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.310\nSo it's something that,\nit's kind of a necessary evil and\n\n38\n00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.162\na necessary fun evil,\nat least in my estimation.\n\n39\n00:01:47.162 --> 00:01:49.866\nI really enjoy switching, so\nRonnie let's just cut to the chase,\n\n40\n00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:51.034\nand move right back into it.\n\n41\n00:01:51.034 --> 00:01:53.781\nWe talked about a lot of different\ntype of switching technologies.\n\n42\n00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:56.330\nWhere we went over speeds,\nand things like that.\n\n43\n00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.630\nAnd, then we got to VLANs,\nwhich is all so very, very awesome.\n\n44\n00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:00.870\nBut, where else can we go with switching?\n\n45\n00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:01.670\nWhat else can we do?\n\n46\n00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.714\n>> Well, there's actually a couple of\ndifferent types of switches you're more\n\n47\n00:02:04.714 --> 00:02:06.340\nthan likely to see in today's networks.\n\n48\n00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.690\nThe earliest switches only really\noperated and functioned at layer two.\n\n49\n00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.107\nRemember, that's actually being able to\nforward data based on the MAC address\n\n50\n00:02:14.107 --> 00:02:15.800\nitself, which is a layer two address.\n\n51\n00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.035\nSo that when data comes in,\n\n52\n00:02:17.035 --> 00:02:20.870\nit forwards it out the port that the MAC\naddress is actually associated with.\n\n53\n00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.300\nThat's perfectly fine, and it works well.\n\n54\n00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.950\nBut, what if you actually do\nhave a couple of different IP\n\n55\n00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.160\nnetworks inside of your own local area\nnetwork as well so, I shouldn't say that.\n\n56\n00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.150\nYou have multiple local area networks\nthat you're actually responsible for.\n\n57\n00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.260\nWell to be able to communicate\nbetween those local area networks\n\n58\n00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.100\nwe also need to be able to route\ndata in between them, and so\n\n59\n00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.100\nwe also need what we\ncall a router to do that.\n\n60\n00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.660\nAnd that was normally a separate device\nthat then you wend send from your\n\n61\n00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.710\nswitch, right?\n\n62\n00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.280\nSo your PC connected to that switch,\n\n63\n00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.222\nthe switch would then be connected\nto the router some place.\n\n64\n00:02:55.222 --> 00:02:58.420\nAnd then that router would be connect\nto another switch on the other side for\n\n65\n00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.760\nyou to send data back and forth on.\n\n66\n00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.080\nWell, when you have something like that,\n\n67\n00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.500\nthat works perfectly fine, but\nit did require an extra device.\n\n68\n00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.800\nSome smaller networks, actually,\nthat were out there said look,\n\n69\n00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.190\nthat's a lot of money to spend.\n\n70\n00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.960\nWe spend two different devices\non a fairly small network,\n\n71\n00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.890\nis there something else that we can do?\n\n72\n00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.650\nWell of course vendors started\ncoming up with what they called\n\n73\n00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.990\nlayer three switches.\n\n74\n00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.010\nNow if you do remember\nthat in the OSI model,\n\n75\n00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.700\nwe have talked about the idea\nof layer two and layer three.\n\n76\n00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.300\nLayer three is where we can have IP\naddressing and also routers too.\n\n77\n00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.062\nWhat they did is they\ntook a single device,\n\n78\n00:03:38.062 --> 00:03:41.070\nand they integrated it\nin to switches as well.\n\n79\n00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.170\nSo sometimes what you'll hear as\nthe term is a layer three switch, or\n\n80\n00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.000\nyou'll also hear the term\nmulti-layer switch.\n\n81\n00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.789\nSo let me show you an example of a layer\ntwo switch right here on my screen, okay.\n\n82\n00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:54.167\nSo, if you were to look at\na layer two switch, and\n\n83\n00:03:54.167 --> 00:03:56.434\nyou have to ignore the label over here,\nokay.\n\n84\n00:03:56.434 --> 00:04:01.080\nIf you were to look at a layer two switch,\nthis is what it would look like, okay?\n\n85\n00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.070\nNow Daniel, let me show you\na picture of a layer three switch.\n\n86\n00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.730\nIf you were to ignore the label\nright here and you were to look for\n\n87\n00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.480\na layer three switch, this is what a layer\nthree switch would look like as well.\n\n88\n00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.590\nSo yeah, I know you're probably like,\noh that wasn't funny, Ronnie!\n\n89\n00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.480\nIt really was.\n\n90\n00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.540\nWhat?\nis it the same?\n\n91\n00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.840\nIt can be, right?\n\n92\n00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.810\nSo you can't judge it on its appearance.\n\n93\n00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.840\nSo what you have to do if you're really\ninterested in trying to distinguish\n\n94\n00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.090\nwhether it's a layer two or\nlayer three switch.\n\n95\n00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.630\nIs you have to take a look\nat the model number itself.\n\n96\n00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.910\nAnd then go and\nfind documentation on that.\n\n97\n00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.610\nYou can't just look at a single switch and\ngo, oh yeah, no,\n\n98\n00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.020\nif I take a look at that port,\nthat proves it's a layer three switch.\n\n99\n00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.125\nMaybe Don could but.\n\n100\n00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:39.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But no, I'm joking.\n\n101\n00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.520\nBut overall though,\nthey look in appearance identical.\n\n102\n00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.530\nThe big difference is what's internal,\ninside, of that switch itself.\n\n103\n00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.520\nSo when we have a layer of switch,\nthree switch.\n\n104\n00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.800\nIt can not only do\nthe layer two switching but\n\n105\n00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.700\nit can also handle the layer\nthree routing as well.\n\n106\n00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.300\nSo that means that we can actually\nrun the configuration for routers and\n\n107\n00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.480\nswitches on that same device and\nit can handle it too.\n\n108\n00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.440\nSo you're actually starting to see,\nwe've seen a movement of,\n\n109\n00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.050\nit says 2,003, I would say.\n\n110\n00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.720\nSo maybe I'm a little bit behind.\n\n111\n00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.495\nMaybe I'm not a really good doctor.\n\n112\n00:05:18.495 --> 00:05:20.150\n[LAUGH]\n>> Now here's a good question, Ronnie.\n\n113\n00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.710\n>> Yeah.\n\n114\n00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.450\n>> Is it a router with a built in switch?\n\n115\n00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.090\nSort of a switch with a built in router.\n\n116\n00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.530\n>> You know,\nthat's actually a good question, Daniel.\n\n117\n00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:29.577\nI don't know.\nIs it the chicken or\n\n118\n00:05:29.577 --> 00:05:31.357\nthe egg that really came in here?\n\n119\n00:05:31.357 --> 00:05:33.651\n>> Exactly.\n>> But more than likely, it was for\n\n120\n00:05:33.651 --> 00:05:37.360\nsmaller or\nsmall to medium businesses, right?\n\n121\n00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.334\nSo don't get me wrong.\n\n122\n00:05:38.334 --> 00:05:42.030\nYou can run these on large businesses,\nbut usually that's the market this was\n\n123\n00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.280\ndesigned for,\nwas that market that said look.\n\n124\n00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.051\nAnd I've already spent a couple of\nthousand dollars on this switch,\n\n125\n00:05:47.051 --> 00:05:51.190\nand now you're telling me I need a router\nfor another couple of thousand dollars?\n\n126\n00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.690\nI really don't want to do that.\n\n127\n00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.742\nSo what did they do?\nThey made a cheaper combined device\n\n128\n00:05:54.742 --> 00:05:59.360\ntogether, which might have been right\nthere in the middle right, $3,000 or so.\n\n129\n00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.672\nSomewhere around there,\n\n130\n00:06:00.672 --> 00:06:03.960\nthat really did kind of combine\nboth of those elements together.\n\n131\n00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.430\nSo that we can actually do\nthat all on one machine.\n\n132\n00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.910\nAnd you think about that,\nsaves on electricity.\n\n133\n00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.860\nAnd also with the configuration here,\nit really actually saves on\n\n134\n00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.000\nthe cost of developing the device when\nthey can cram all of that into one device.\n\n135\n00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.250\nAnd now you keep your customer so\n\n136\n00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:23.140\nsomebody else saying you mean that company\nwas able to do it but yours wasn't?\n\n137\n00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.060\nSo you do have a lot of\nmarket forces driving this.\n\n138\n00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.680\nBut this is more often is what you'll\nsee is layer three switches inside of\n\n139\n00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.280\nnetworks today.\n\n140\n00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.760\nAnd that's because it can do both and\n\n141\n00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.700\nyou don't have to worry about\nactually adding in a separate device.\n\n142\n00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.310\nNow, is a separate device\nstill necessary sometimes?\n\n143\n00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:39.790\nYeah, you better believe it.\n\n144\n00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:44.610\nIf you need dedicated routers because you\nhave a lot of routing network that goes on\n\n145\n00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.610\nwell then yes, go ahead and do that.\n\n146\n00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.140\nWill a layer three switch also\nwork with a router in place?\n\n147\n00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.046\nIt definitely will.\n\n148\n00:06:50.046 --> 00:06:52.229\nSo it really depends on\nthe capabilities and\n\n149\n00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:56.130\nwhat you need that router to do if you\nactually choose to buy a separate router.\n\n150\n00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:00.554\nBut most small businesses to medium\nbusinesses size a layer three switch will\n\n151\n00:07:00.554 --> 00:07:05.480\ndo both functions and will work perfectly\nfine, and it really is kind of a dream.\n\n152\n00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.210\nBecause on one device you really\nhave two devices kind of crammed in.\n\n153\n00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.260\nSo that's why you hear that either\nthe term layer three switch, or\n\n154\n00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.700\nthe term multi-layer switch\nis what you also hear.\n\n155\n00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:15.480\n>> That's right.\n\n156\n00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.150\nNow with a managed switch as well,\nit also gives us some\n\n157\n00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.410\nother great functionality when it\ncomes down to security, right?\n\n158\n00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:23.640\nSecurity is the big topic of the day.\n\n159\n00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.760\nYou gotta make sure that\nyour network is secure.\n\n160\n00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.220\nYou can't just leave\nit out in the wind for\n\n161\n00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:31.380\nany hacker or malfeasance that's out\nthere trying to gain access to your data.\n\n162\n00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.110\nWe have to stop those jokers.\n\n163\n00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:36.620\nWell, switch was actually for\na while one of the ways in which they\n\n164\n00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:41.860\ncould gain access to our network and\neven our data if we allowed them to.\n\n165\n00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.160\nBut mana switches today, they have\na lot of security features built in and\n\n166\n00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.190\nwe could use them to stop many\nof those attacks right Ronnie.\n\n167\n00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.509\n>> There's no doubt about\nthat from the outside.\n\n168\n00:07:50.509 --> 00:07:52.936\nThere's a couple of things that\nwe had to worry about, right.\n\n169\n00:07:52.936 --> 00:07:57.633\nIf somebody was able to physically gain\naccess to that console port, okay.\n\n170\n00:07:57.633 --> 00:08:01.236\nThey could bring a cable in and they\ncould gain access to it, a lot of times,\n\n171\n00:08:01.236 --> 00:08:05.100\nright away, that meant that they\ncould actually control the switch.\n\n172\n00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.770\nSo one of the neat features inside\nof the way that the switch operates\n\n173\n00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:13.040\non it's operating system is that they\ngive you the ability to control access\n\n174\n00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.510\nto the switch itself even\nfrom the console port.\n\n175\n00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:22.060\nAnd that means you can lock down that port\nto make you ask, or to make it ask you for\n\n176\n00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:27.880\na password if you want to actually gain\naccess to it from that, using that cable.\n\n177\n00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.130\nSo, this is some of those prevention\nmethods that you have to have in\n\n178\n00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:32.220\nplace, right.\n\n179\n00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.810\nSo even though the console port,\nby default everything is set up and\n\n180\n00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:35.800\nready to go.\n\n181\n00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.490\nYou know, you just plug it in and you're\nready to configure it and you're fine.\n\n182\n00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:43.040\nWell it's never a recommendation that\nyou take a switch right out of the box,\n\n183\n00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.840\nplug it in and make it work.\n\n184\n00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.580\nNow will it?\n\n185\n00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.310\nYes.\n\n186\n00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:49.820\nSwitches are one of those\nunusually amazing devices.\n\n187\n00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:53.410\nAs much as they can do, and\nas much security as we can add into it.\n\n188\n00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.100\nWhen you buy one, let's say for\nexample from Cisco,\n\n189\n00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:01.240\nall you need to do is take it out of\nits crate, plug power into it and\n\n190\n00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:05.190\nthen once the light settled down,\nyou start plugging computer ports into it.\n\n191\n00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:06.410\nIt'll start doing the switching.\n\n192\n00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.260\nNo questions asked, nothing.\n\n193\n00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.640\nThey work exactly like a regular\nold unmanaged switch will work.\n\n194\n00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.090\nAnd you don't have to worry about it.\n\n195\n00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:14.990\nIt will function perfectly fine.\n\n196\n00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:16.940\nThe problem is if I have\nthat 48-port switch and\n\n197\n00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:20.330\nI'm only using 20 of those ports It\nalso means that there's a chance for\n\n198\n00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:27.210\nsome attacker to just walk by that switch,\ntake his laptop, take a network cable and\n\n199\n00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:32.220\nplug directly into that switch and\nwe are off and ready to go at that point.\n\n200\n00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:35.024\nSo there is something that\nyou have to worry about.\n\n201\n00:09:35.024 --> 00:09:39.315\nSo normally one of the basic\nconfigurations you end up doing on that\n\n202\n00:09:39.315 --> 00:09:44.650\nswitch is just to start implementing\nto call some type of port security.\n\n203\n00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:48.100\nNow, when you start talking about\nport security, well, what can you do?\n\n204\n00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:52.020\nYou can actually make it\nreally stop traffic, right?\n\n205\n00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:56.870\nWe can set up port security to\nwhere if somebody plugs in a device\n\n206\n00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:00.820\nInside any of those ports, and\nwe don't want it to be recognized,\n\n207\n00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:04.200\nwe can actually go ahead and say,\nlook, it won't be recognized.\n\n208\n00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.890\nWe can do something like that.\n\n209\n00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:10.520\nOr what we can do, which is actually\neasier, is to say, look, all those ports\n\n210\n00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:15.500\nI'm not using right now, let me just\nshut them down administratively.\n\n211\n00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.810\nAnd that means I don't care if you plug\na device into it I'm not going to turn on.\n\n212\n00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:22.720\nAnd that is actually\nmuch more secure instead,\n\n213\n00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.350\nis what you also have the ability to do.\n\n214\n00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:27.540\nSo when you start seeing that, right?\n\n215\n00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.510\nThat's where you actually have to,\nagain, provide security for\n\n216\n00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:31.935\nthose managed widgets.\n\n217\n00:10:31.935 --> 00:10:35.950\nOne is to provide secure access not only\nto things like the console table, but\n\n218\n00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:38.120\neven across the network.\n\n219\n00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.230\nThe other one of course is that\nwe can provide it port by port.\n\n220\n00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:44.880\nSometimes by implementing what we're\ncalled port security, where we can\n\n221\n00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.390\nactually say, look, as long as that one\nmachine's plugged into it, we're fine.\n\n222\n00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:52.680\nBut now if Daniel were to unplug my\nmachine and then plug his machine into it,\n\n223\n00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.520\nwell it can actually shut it\ndown automatically as well.\n\n224\n00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.510\nSo there's a bunch of dynamic\nconfiguration that we can do, and then\n\n225\n00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:03.270\nthere's static configurations like setting\nup passwords for the console access.\n\n226\n00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:06.180\nOr for us, when we actually try to\nconnect to it from across the network.\n\n227\n00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:10.790\nSo there is a lot that we can do here to\nprotect hard networks in that way, and\n\n228\n00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:13.230\nprotect the device and it's configuration.\n\n229\n00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:16.080\nAnd we do have to think about that\nwhen we're working on switches.\n\n230\n00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.410\n>> Yeah.\nDon't forget that good old port security.\n\n231\n00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:20.140\nBeing able to say all right,\n\n232\n00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:24.370\nthis port, basically, unlike the switch\nthat Ronnie is showing us, right?\n\n233\n00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:29.220\nHas even the ability to say, only this\ncomputer can connect to this port,\n\n234\n00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.970\ndown to that level of control.\n\n235\n00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:33.160\nAnd that is a very good thing for\n\n236\n00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.790\nus, for all the reasons\nthat Ronnie just described.\n\n237\n00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:38.320\nBecause we have people out\nthere that are crafty and\n\n238\n00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.190\nthey can gain access by finding\nan open port somewhere.\n\n239\n00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:46.290\nLots of times we have ports plugged in and\nrun to outlets in the wall.\n\n240\n00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.800\nYou'll see those little jacks\nin the wall for a network cable.\n\n241\n00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.200\nNothing's plugged into that,\nguess where that goes?\n\n242\n00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:56.360\nThat runs through a ceiling, around the\nbuilding somewhere and into a room where\n\n243\n00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.850\nthere's a switch, and it's terminated\ninto one of those ports on the switch.\n\n244\n00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:04.010\nI can get in there, pretend I'm some\nsort of whatever, plug in to that.\n\n245\n00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:05.360\nAnd now I have access to the switch.\n\n246\n00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.420\nAnd I can start mounting\nattacks from there.\n\n247\n00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:12.000\nSo if I label that off, saying,\nthis is only for laptops in this building.\n\n248\n00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.050\nMaybe even one specific laptop.\n\n249\n00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:16.810\nI can make that happen and\nthat's what we wanna implement and\n\n250\n00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:18.730\nof course keep our switches secure.\n\n251\n00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:22.120\nLock the doors, put them somewhere where\npeople just can't walk in and go oh,\n\n252\n00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.870\nlook at all these lovely\ndevices we have here.\n\n253\n00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:25.870\nI'm gonna pull all the cables out,\nthat'll be fun.\n\n254\n00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.210\nDon't wanna do that either, so\n\n255\n00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:30.980\nphysical security is also important as\nwe talked about with the console port.\n\n256\n00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:35.090\nNow Ronnie another important thing\nphysically when it comes to the switch\n\n257\n00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:36.090\nbecause it's power.\n\n258\n00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.540\nRight?\nThis thing has to get some power and\n\n259\n00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:42.160\nsome of the bigger higher end switches\ngive us some options when it comes\n\n260\n00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:42.670\nto the power, right?\n\n261\n00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:43.320\n>> It really does.\n\n262\n00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:50.580\nIt gives us what we call a redundant\npower supply is what we call it to So\n\n263\n00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.880\nlet me go ahead and show you what\nI'm talking about here on my screen.\n\n264\n00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.390\nI went ahead and took a picture\nof the back of that computer.\n\n265\n00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:00.150\nAnd so what we're taking a look at,\nthere's the front and\n\n266\n00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.040\nhere is the back side of it.\n\n267\n00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.030\nAnd so\nearlier we showed you this console port.\n\n268\n00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:08.600\nAnd normally on the switches that's\nall you have on that back side.\n\n269\n00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.570\nIt really is.\n\n270\n00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:10.490\nYou don't have anything else.\n\n271\n00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:14.170\nYou have a power, and\nyou have this console port, and that's it.\n\n272\n00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:17.300\nWell, remember what happens,\nthen, if power goes out.\n\n273\n00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:18.540\nThat switch goes down, and\n\n274\n00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:22.900\nthat means all these devices plugged\ninto your switch, well they are done.\n\n275\n00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.570\nSome of the higher end switches like\nwhat Daniel is talking about, though.\n\n276\n00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.060\nSo this is the same one.\n\n277\n00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:31.040\nOver here on this side, you see where it\ngives you this nice little connection.\n\n278\n00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:36.270\nAnd this one calls it a remote power\nsupply specified in the manual, and\n\n279\n00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:39.310\nthat means, look,\nthey do have certain devices out there\n\n280\n00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:41.930\nthat can then act as\na redundant power supply.\n\n281\n00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:46.970\nIf this one gets pulled by accident, this\nthing can also kick in if it needs to.\n\n282\n00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:50.810\nSo it gives us that ability to\nhave that nice hardware redundancy\n\n283\n00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:54.140\nto where we are able to\nmaintain those connections.\n\n284\n00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.660\nAnd so\na lot of companies will end up doing this,\n\n285\n00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:59.820\nbecause that switch is so important\nto them that they do go ahead and\n\n286\n00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:04.030\nbuy this redundant power supply\nto kick in and do that as well.\n\n287\n00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:05.860\nSo with that in mind, right?\n\n288\n00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:09.640\nDual power supplies ensure that the switch\nis actually gonna continue to function.\n\n289\n00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:10.870\nNow what about the ports?\n\n290\n00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:12.930\nThere's really nothing you can really\ndo with the front side of this.\n\n291\n00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:16.890\nIt doesn't say, yeah this switch,\nlet me see if I can pull that up,\n\n292\n00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:19.890\nit doesn't allow you to pull out\nthese eight ports over here and\n\n293\n00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:22.360\ngo, yeah Don let me go and\njust swap them out.\n\n294\n00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.400\nBut on the power supply,\nthis is one of the best features.\n\n295\n00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.010\nAnd it is designed for that enterprise\nbecause that's what we're always looking\n\n296\n00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:31.240\nfor is a single point of failure so\nthat they can remove that.\n\n297\n00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.530\nThat switch can function like crazy\nin the way that it does it, too.\n\n298\n00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:41.710\nAnd so that the switch is really just\nan amazing device unto itself because of\n\n299\n00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:46.020\nthings like this as well its ability to do\nrecording based on the MAC address, too.\n\n300\n00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.840\nAnd a couple of things I did mention,\nI just thought of, right.\n\n301\n00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:52.520\nSwitches are just amazing in\nthe way that they end up working\n\n302\n00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.910\nbecause they really don't require much for\nme.\n\n303\n00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:57.590\nI just have to plug devices in,\nit's just I can deal with this, and\n\n304\n00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:59.080\nI don't have to worry about\nconfiguring anything.\n\n305\n00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.770\nIt just does it.\n\n306\n00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:04.200\nIf I configure anything, it's usually\nthe management stuff like the security and\n\n307\n00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.250\nthen VLANs, but that's just about it.\n\n308\n00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:08.190\nLeave it, set it, forget it, ready to go.\n\n309\n00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:09.125\n>> That's right.\n\n310\n00:15:09.125 --> 00:15:11.430\nNow obviously switches\nare very important and\n\n311\n00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:13.970\nwe've covered a myriad\nof different topics.\n\n312\n00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:18.030\nBut Ronnie, they can be, especially\nwhen it comes to the management,\n\n313\n00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.620\nthey're not maybe intuitive\nmight be the word.\n\n314\n00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:24.160\nSo what do we do when we're like okay,\nI know the switches,\n\n315\n00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.690\nI've heard that switches can do this.\n\n316\n00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:30.360\nMy manual says that this switch\ndoes support that feature.\n\n317\n00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.970\nBut I can't figure out\nhow to make it work.\n\n318\n00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:33.200\nWhat do we do?\n\n319\n00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.790\n>> Well, the easiest thing is,\nespecially if you buy a switch like this,\n\n320\n00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:41.530\nis that it normally also comes with some\ntype of support than can come with it.\n\n321\n00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:46.119\nHere on this one, this would be the Cisco\nTAC, with their technical access something\n\n322\n00:15:46.119 --> 00:15:48.748\nsupport center that they\nhave the ability to do.\n\n323\n00:15:48.748 --> 00:15:52.921\nWhich means a phone call for you, and they\ncan be, put you on a specialist with that\n\n324\n00:15:52.921 --> 00:15:57.113\nparticular device, and that way they can\nhelp you figure out what they need to do.\n\n325\n00:15:57.113 --> 00:16:00.253\nSo, support can come in many\ndifferent formats, right?\n\n326\n00:16:00.253 --> 00:16:02.300\nIf you're doing that it's\nreally an enterprise issue.\n\n327\n00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:06.820\nYou're saying, hey, I need help now, and\nyou've got to help me figure this out.\n\n328\n00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:10.880\nPerfectly fine and able to do so, but\nif you do need more help than that,\n\n329\n00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.850\nremember you can always go to\nthe manufacturers website and\n\n330\n00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:17.340\nthere are plenty of documentation\non a lot of this stuff.\n\n331\n00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:21.550\nCisco is really good on documenting\neverything that they have in place.\n\n332\n00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:24.990\nAnd you can find the most minute\ndetail about those devices.\n\n333\n00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:28.440\nThe drawback on that, though,\nis it takes so much time.\n\n334\n00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:33.320\nAnd sometimes the documentation is so\ntechnically right there that you\n\n335\n00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.240\nreally have to kind of read it\na couple of times and go, oh yeah,\n\n336\n00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.250\nI think that this is\nwhat it's talking about.\n\n337\n00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:41.420\nBut you can get on the phone with whoever\nthat's actually supporting that device.\n\n338\n00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:43.310\nYou put a specials on the phone,\nwould you go,\n\n339\n00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:46.190\nI really need this to work like,\nfive minutes ago.\n\n340\n00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:48.520\nMore to likely those guys are the ones\nyou're gonna actually call and\n\n341\n00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.020\nhelp you out.\n\n342\n00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:52.230\n>> Yeah, you spend a good amount of\nmoney on some of those equipment.\n\n343\n00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:57.270\nLike Ronnie said before, it can get in\nto the tens of thousands of dollars, for\n\n344\n00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:01.650\nsome of these larger,\nmassive enterprise ISP level solutions.\n\n345\n00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:06.070\nLet me tell you what, what's coming\nwith that is a support to go with it.\n\n346\n00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:08.040\nIf I can't figure out how\nsomething is supposed to work, and\n\n347\n00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.060\nI've spent that much money on it.\n\n348\n00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:12.820\nYou better believe,\nI have a phone number I can call and\n\n349\n00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:14.980\nCisco Tech is very, very helpful.\n\n350\n00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.110\nI mean, they'll basically,\neven if you didn't know but\n\n351\n00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:21.460\nthe bare minimum of how to\nconnect to the device itself.\n\n352\n00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:24.180\nCisco Tech will walk you\nthrough it step by step\n\n353\n00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.690\non everything that you would want to do.\n\n354\n00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:29.070\nBasically, your network support.\n\n355\n00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:31.190\n>> There's no doubt about it.\n\n356\n00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:35.150\nYeah, so when you start seeing\nsomething like this, don't be hesitant.\n\n357\n00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:39.350\nIf your company's spent the money for\nthat, call them when you need it.\n\n358\n00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:42.720\nThat's kind of the worst thing about\nbuying support a lot of times.\n\n359\n00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.180\nNow I don't wanna disturb them.\n\n360\n00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:47.567\nAnd they're like,\nwe gave you permission cuz you paid us so\n\n361\n00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:49.430\nthat you would disturb us.\n\n362\n00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:52.490\nSo take advantage of that\nwhen you really do need it,\n\n363\n00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:54.960\ncuz that's actually gonna be the day\nthat you keep the thing up and running.\n\n364\n00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.710\nNow, if you have all day to learn\nabout it, that's one thing, but\n\n365\n00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:00.210\nmost of us don't in a production system.\n\n366\n00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:02.100\nWe have to get it back up and running.\n\n367\n00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:07.190\nAnd if we can't figure it out,\ncalling the Cisco technical support,\n\n368\n00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:11.100\nthey're definitely gonna be the one that\nyou wanna call cuz those guys, they just\n\n369\n00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:14.800\nlove everything about their equipment and\nthey know it to the nth degree.\n\n370\n00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.040\nThat's why you wanna call them.\n\n371\n00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:19.190\n>> Yeah, if you knew what to do,\nyou'd be working for Cisco Tech.\n\n372\n00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:22.530\nThat's basically what it boils down to,\nand that's why those guys are there.\n\n373\n00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:23.670\nThey are awesome.\n\n374\n00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:24.400\nAll right, moving on,\n\n375\n00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:28.390\nlet's continue talking about just some of\nthe things we need to know about switches.\n\n376\n00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:30.270\nLet's look at our list here.\n\n377\n00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:35.530\nBackplane speeds and squishing types\nare modes of which they operate right?\n\n378\n00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:38.320\n>> Yeah, there's a couple of\ndifferent things here when\n\n379\n00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.610\nwe take at some of the exam\nejectors here that they call out.\n\n380\n00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:44.030\nThat's really not an incredibly\nhigh level overview,\n\n381\n00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:45.970\nbut stuff that they\nwant you to know about.\n\n382\n00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:47.690\nWhen you hear the term backplane,\n\n383\n00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:51.710\nthat's something you definitely want to\nunderstand in relationship to things,\n\n384\n00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:56.340\nso if you think about a regular PC, all\nthe components are connected to something.\n\n385\n00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:00.010\nAnd that something inside of the PC\nis gonna be your motherboard.\n\n386\n00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:04.140\nWell, remember that, on your motherboard\nright, certain things operate at certain\n\n387\n00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.520\nspeeds that are on your motherboard\nwhen they have to communicate and\n\n388\n00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.850\ntalk to each other.\n\n389\n00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:15.170\nWell a switch is really kind of\na very simplified type of PC right?\n\n390\n00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:19.220\nWhere as a PC, when you work with it,\nyou install an operating system.\n\n391\n00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.890\nBut you install a bunch of\ndifferent applications so\n\n392\n00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:25.380\nyou can browse the internet, so\nthat you can do your productivity work so\n\n393\n00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.530\nyou can play a game,\nso you can do all that.\n\n394\n00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:29.820\nA switch has the same thing.\n\n395\n00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:34.950\nIt has a mother board, it has a CPU, it\nhas RAM, it has an operating system on it,\n\n396\n00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:38.780\nand there's only really one\napplication which is switching.\n\n397\n00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:39.920\nThat's what it does.\n\n398\n00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.850\nSo it's not designed for you to go out and\nadd in like half life three and go,\n\n399\n00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.440\noh yeah I'm gonna play this thing.\n\n400\n00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.270\nIt's designed to do switching.\n\n401\n00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:51.910\nSo it does everything, is optimizes\nefficient as it can to do the switching.\n\n402\n00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:55.120\nAlong with that, it means that\nthe hardware that's inside of the switch\n\n403\n00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.420\nis optimized to really do only one thing.\n\n404\n00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.990\nWhereas you PC's optimized\nto do 6000 things,\n\n405\n00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:04.030\nand says look on the back plane,\non the motherboard itself,\n\n406\n00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:07.790\nwhich is technically the back plane\nthat is the same idea it says,\n\n407\n00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:13.370\nlet's operate it as fast as we can to\ndo the switching that we need to do.\n\n408\n00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:17.030\nSo what happens there is when we talk\nabout the term backplane you're really\n\n409\n00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:19.380\ntalking about the same\nidea as a motherboard.\n\n410\n00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:24.810\nBut when you talk about backplane\nspeed you're saying how fast can\n\n411\n00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:29.460\ndata be sent into that CPU to be\nprocessed and do what it needs to do?\n\n412\n00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:34.380\nNow, this actually used to be\nmore important in the days of\n\n413\n00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:36.780\na lot of switch ports.\n\n414\n00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:42.500\nSo like on the 48 port switch, a backplane\nspeed is very essential to what it does.\n\n415\n00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:45.570\nOn a little 8 port switch,\nnot so essential.\n\n416\n00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:47.510\nOn a 12 port switch, not so essential.\n\n417\n00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:48.570\n48 ports, yes.\n\n418\n00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:50.560\nBecause remember each one of those ports,\n\n419\n00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.670\nif they're a 100 megabit ports,\nthat 40 hundred megabits\n\n420\n00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:57.830\nall together when you start taking\na look at all those ports together.\n\n421\n00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:58.810\nWell, there has to be\n\n422\n00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:05.460\nenough bandwidth inside on the motherboard\nto handle those connections.\n\n423\n00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:08.610\nWell, there's not a single motherboard,\nI don't care what device that you get,\n\n424\n00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:13.920\nthere's not a motherboard that says,\nyes I will support 4,800 megabits\n\n425\n00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.490\nback playing speed,\nespecially on something like this.\n\n426\n00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:20.320\nWhat they do is I say, look,\nhere's how much I can support at one time\n\n427\n00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:24.220\nbefore we're gonna have to start kind of\nsaying, look, slow down a little bit and\n\n428\n00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:25.320\nmake it work.\n\n429\n00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.190\nSo back plane speed is about that,\n\n430\n00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:29.840\nit's how much shared bandwidth\nis really out there.\n\n431\n00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:34.500\nSo on these devices you might end up\nseeing where it's like a 32-gigabit back\n\n432\n00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:38.440\nplane or a 128-gigabit back plane,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n433\n00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.840\nAnd that allows you to know that hey after\na certain amount of ports when you have\n\n434\n00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.890\nall these devices trying\nto connect together.\n\n435\n00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:46.510\nIt's gonna slow down just briefly.\n\n436\n00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:50.660\nNow when I say that it doesn't\nreally anymore because\n\n437\n00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.820\nof the technology that's\nactually involved.\n\n438\n00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:55.950\nIn what we're about to talk about\nabout the switching types as well.\n\n439\n00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:58.910\nSwitches operate insanely fast.\n\n440\n00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:02.290\nWhen I mean that I mean it operates\nat the speed of thought, and\n\n441\n00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:04.740\nI really mean that in the way it does it.\n\n442\n00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.590\nAnd it's because it's based\non something we calls ASICs.\n\n443\n00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:11.790\nASIC stands for\napplication specific integrated circuitry.\n\n444\n00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:16.130\nWhereas a lot of things like on a router,\nwhen it has to make a decision\n\n445\n00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:19.670\nit has to go to the CPU and say,\nwhat's your decision going to be?\n\n446\n00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:23.360\nThe way that every single port\non that 48 port switch works,\n\n447\n00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:27.720\nis that all of it's decision making is\nbased on the hardware on that port and\n\n448\n00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:31.600\nit is an integrated specific\ncircuit is what it's done.\n\n449\n00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.200\nSo it makes that forwarding, flooding and\n\n450\n00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:39.010\nof course the filtering decision\nright there on that port.\n\n451\n00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:43.070\nSo it doesn't have to go to the CPU\nto handle a lot of the other things.\n\n452\n00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:46.970\nThe CPU is designed to handle\nthe control aspect of what happens but\n\n453\n00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:50.520\nall of the data forwarding\ndecisions are based on the ASIC,\n\n454\n00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:55.210\nwhich means the backplane is not so\nessential if it makes a direct connection.\n\n455\n00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:59.840\nSo, backplane speed is all about that,\nwhen you start hearing that terminology.\n\n456\n00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:04.950\nIt's how much the motherboard\nhandle at one time.\n\n457\n00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:07.850\nNow, when we start about\nswitching types though,\n\n458\n00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:10.570\nthis also goes into that backplane speed.\n\n459\n00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:13.710\nBecause it really depends on\nthe type of switch you get.\n\n460\n00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:16.040\nThe more expensive ones of course,\n\n461\n00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:19.320\nare actually the ones that you really\ndo want because of what they do.\n\n462\n00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.610\nThe cheaper ones can work faster, but\n\n463\n00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:25.910\nit might not give you all\nthe functionality that you're expecting.\n\n464\n00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:29.120\nSo there's really three switching\ntypes that we want to actually be\n\n465\n00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.240\nable to talk about, okay?\n\n466\n00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:36.240\nSo if you buy a switch and it says hey,\nthis is a fragment free switch, and\n\n467\n00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:39.520\nyou'll hear that term,\nwhat in the world does that mean?\n\n468\n00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:43.885\nWell, what they found out is that data can\ncorrupt as you send it and you can imagine\n\n469\n00:23:43.885 --> 00:23:47.575\nthe data can corrupt as you send it\nfaster across different devices.\n\n470\n00:23:47.575 --> 00:23:51.480\nSo what they found out is after\nthe scan in millions and millions,\n\n471\n00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:56.237\nmaybe in billions of packets, is that they\nfound out that the data if it corrupts\n\n472\n00:23:56.237 --> 00:24:00.573\ngoing across the switch It corrupts\nduring the first 64 bytes of data.\n\n473\n00:24:00.573 --> 00:24:03.360\nSo after examining that,\nthey started realizing something.\n\n474\n00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:07.240\nIf there's corruption,\nit doesn't tend to happen after that.\n\n475\n00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:12.380\nSo what they do is that they send data\ninto a port and fragment free says,\n\n476\n00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:17.190\nI can examine the first 64 bits of data or\nbytes of data, excuse me.\n\n477\n00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:20.870\nThe first 64 bytes of data, and if there's\nno corruption, I will go ahead and\n\n478\n00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:22.780\nbegin the forwarding process.\n\n479\n00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:25.750\nAnd then that actually\nmakes it work a lot faster.\n\n480\n00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:26.280\nOkay?\n\n481\n00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.940\nSo that's the way it goes.\n\n482\n00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:30.970\nBut then there's also what we call cut and\nthrough.\n\n483\n00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:31.670\nOkay?\n\n484\n00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:35.460\nCut and through sits there and\nsays, look, here's what I'll do.\n\n485\n00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:40.940\nDaniel, if you'll send me this all I need\nto do is see the destination MAC address.\n\n486\n00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:44.290\nIf I get the destination MAC address,\nI'm sending it through.\n\n487\n00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:45.350\nThat's all it takes.\n\n488\n00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:46.980\nIt doesn't examine any more.\n\n489\n00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:49.520\nIt doesn't sit there and\ngo there may be fragmentation.\n\n490\n00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.820\nBut what it says is if I can\nget it over there fast, and\n\n491\n00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.920\nthen if that device\nneeds me to re-send it,\n\n492\n00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:58.300\nI'll send it faster than having to examine\nthe first 64 bytes and then send it on.\n\n493\n00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:02.230\nSo, it's actually taking that bet that\nmore than likely the majority of these\n\n494\n00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:05.310\npackets are not going to\nbe fragmented at all.\n\n495\n00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:08.730\nSo if I get 90% of the packets\nthrough without any fragmentation,\n\n496\n00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:12.070\nthe 10% that I have to\nresend is no real big deal.\n\n497\n00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.790\nOkay?\n\n498\n00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:15.000\nSo, that one, as good as that is,\n\n499\n00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.700\nthe problem that we have there depends on\nthe sensitivity of our data and how we\n\n500\n00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:23.640\ntreat our data as well, if we're actually\nworking inside of a center that says,\n\n501\n00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:28.180\nlook we need for the data to remain,\nto not be corrupted at all, and\n\n502\n00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:30.920\nto not worry about that we're not\ngoing to use anything like that.\n\n503\n00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.780\nIf we're only looking for high speed,\nwe don't mind the idea that\n\n504\n00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:37.140\ndata corruption and then having\nto resend that, then we're fine.\n\n505\n00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:40.620\nThe more expensive of these is\nthe final one we're talking about here,\n\n506\n00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:42.440\nwhich is the store and forward.\n\n507\n00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.350\nThe store and\nforward says look send me the frame.\n\n508\n00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:48.250\nI don't care how big that frame is\nthe maximum size can be about 15\n\n509\n00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:49.150\nhundred bites here.\n\n510\n00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:50.680\nSend me the whole frame.\n\n511\n00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.620\nI will examine that frame and\n\n512\n00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:56.290\nif everything is good,\nthen I will forward it on.\n\n513\n00:25:56.290 --> 00:26:00.100\nSo by doing this, every single port\nhas that ability to do it, and\n\n514\n00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.000\nthis does operate a little bit slower.\n\n515\n00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.390\nWhen I say slower, I mean half a thought\nbehind what these other two can do.\n\n516\n00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:10.090\nWhen it operates that slower, but\nit actually insures that when it receives\n\n517\n00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:14.030\nthat frame on that port, everything\nis good before it forwards it on.\n\n518\n00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:16.850\nSo in other words,\nthere should not be any fragmentation or\n\n519\n00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:20.370\nany corruption in the data when\nit actually goes into the port.\n\n520\n00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:22.770\nAnd when it leaves the port as well.\n\n521\n00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:27.470\nSo, there's a little bit of technicality\ninvolved in this switch here and\n\n522\n00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:29.670\na little bit of overkill.\n\n523\n00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:32.650\nI hate to say it, it's on the exam\nobjective so, you've got know them.\n\n524\n00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:37.950\n>> Yeah, they're definitely upping\nthe game a little bit because the MDA\n\n525\n00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:42.750\nnetworks fundamentals exam is normally\nconsidered an introductory exam.\n\n526\n00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:44.538\nThis is not introductory material.\n\n527\n00:26:44.538 --> 00:26:49.090\nThis is how switches work,\nit's not just the basics of it.\n\n528\n00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:53.330\n>> Yeah, no I learned this when I\nstarted studying from my CCNA, seven,\n\n529\n00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:54.420\nten years ago.\n\n530\n00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:57.150\nSo wasn't that I would like empty it,\nbut when I saw it I was like,\n\n531\n00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:58.610\nwell we got to cover it.\n\n532\n00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:00.010\nSo, we at least need to know the basics.\n\n533\n00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:03.210\nNow, did I really kind of\ngive you the whole run down?\n\n534\n00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:06.750\nNo, by far, but at least the description\nof it so you do have that.\n\n535\n00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:08.020\nRemember those term, right?\n\n536\n00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:11.320\nCut in through, fragment free [LAUGH] and\n\n537\n00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:15.750\nstorm ford, got to remember those and once\nwe do that we're fine and perfect to go.\n\n538\n00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:16.490\n>> That's right.\n\n539\n00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:18.920\nNow, the last thing we\nneed to cover is well,\n\n540\n00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:21.460\none of the biggest topics when\nit comes to switching it.\n\n541\n00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:25.132\nHow does the switch know that when\nit receives data in port one and\n\n542\n00:27:25.132 --> 00:27:28.940\nthat it's destined, and\nthat's from our own computer, right?\n\n543\n00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:33.045\nThat computer might be\nIP address 192.168.2.45,\n\n544\n00:27:33.045 --> 00:27:36.242\nand it wants to send to\nmaybe to Ryan's computer.\n\n545\n00:27:36.242 --> 00:27:40.585\nHe's 192.168.1.55, right?\n\n546\n00:27:40.585 --> 00:27:46.235\nHow does it know that Ronny's plugged into\nport 23 and I'm plugged into port 22,\n\n547\n00:27:46.235 --> 00:27:50.160\nand get that data to go there and\nnot to everybody else.\n\n548\n00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.999\nWell, that's where the Mac\ntable comes in to play,\n\n549\n00:27:52.999 --> 00:27:57.255\nbasically a database of whose connected\nto what and so they can do that on a fly,\n\n550\n00:27:57.255 --> 00:28:00.239\nRon your here to give us\na little more detail than that.\n\n551\n00:28:00.239 --> 00:28:01.380\n>> Right.\nWhen a switch,\n\n552\n00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.967\nwhen you first plug in\ndevices to the switch,\n\n553\n00:28:03.967 --> 00:28:09.250\nthe switch learns Mac addresses based off\nthe source that's actually in the frame.\n\n554\n00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:12.500\nSo when your computer actually\ncommunicates, it's going to have\n\n555\n00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:16.310\na destination address, it's also\ngoing to have a source Mac address.\n\n556\n00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:20.280\nWhat gets entered in to the Mac address\ntable is only the source Mac address.\n\n557\n00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.570\nSo if I'm plugged in to port 22\nlike Daniel's describing, you know,\n\n558\n00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:27.160\ntake a look and, oh look, here's this\nsource here's who's sending it, and\n\n559\n00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:30.460\nthen it attaches it in\nthat table to port 22.\n\n560\n00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:34.830\nAnd then when it actually sends it\nthrough to Daniel's computer which is\n\n561\n00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:37.990\nthe destination, when Daniel's\ncomputer replies back and goes,\n\n562\n00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:41.480\nhey this is from port 23 and\nHere's Daniele's Mac address and\n\n563\n00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:45.380\nwe'll attach it there, and\nnow we have that established in the table.\n\n564\n00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:48.310\nThe reason why that's important\nis it doesn't have to go out and\n\n565\n00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:51.920\nfigure out what that Mac address is now,\nit just simply looks it up in table.\n\n566\n00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.180\nThe first time takes\na little bit of time like,\n\n567\n00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:58.290\nI say again, now your talking about two\nthoughts behind what we're talking about.\n\n568\n00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:00.090\nIt really doesn't take any time at all.\n\n569\n00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:03.290\nBut once it starts learning it, it starts\npopulating that mac address table.\n\n570\n00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:04.660\nLet me show you that here.\n\n571\n00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:08.210\nSo here it is I'm back on this\nswitch that we're seeing here.\n\n572\n00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:11.910\nAnd so if I go into this,\nlet me get back out here.\n\n573\n00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:15.550\nAnd let me do one more that way\nI don't get anybody confused.\n\n574\n00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:22.720\nAll I have to do is type show\nmac address dash table, and you\n\n575\n00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:26.580\ncan see right here that there are actually\nseveral different types of addresses.\n\n576\n00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.560\nAll of these static CPUs that\nyou're seeing right here,\n\n577\n00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:34.600\nthese are the Mac addresses of the port's\nthemselves, is what you're seeing, okay?\n\n578\n00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:38.370\nSo it's actually listed as cpu,\nyou're actually seeing that Mac address.\n\n579\n00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:41.770\nWhen you see the ones that\nare listed as dynamic,\n\n580\n00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:46.150\nthose are the ones when they connect and\nthey start sending packets back and forth.\n\n581\n00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:49.350\nWhen you see dynamic this is\nsaying that the switch learned\n\n582\n00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:54.080\nthis from the source\naddress of what came in.\n\n583\n00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:58.908\nAnd you see this on Gig,\nthis is Gig ethernet port zero/two.\n\n584\n00:29:58.908 --> 00:30:04.224\nAnd you can also see one on\nfast ethernet zero/six and\n\n585\n00:30:04.224 --> 00:30:07.340\ntwo and nine and two again.\n\n586\n00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:10.940\nSo, on this two port,\nright, this Gig two port.\n\n587\n00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:14.760\nNotice that multiple MAC addresses\ncan be assigned to a single port.\n\n588\n00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:18.630\nSo if you keep sending data that way, it\nactually says look, if you're looking for\n\n589\n00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:21.840\none of these other devices, yeah,\nyou can forward it out me, and\n\n590\n00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.350\nit will actually get there.\n\n591\n00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:26.660\nSo it really does help us, because now\nwe're not having to communicate with\n\n592\n00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:28.450\nthe other side to verify it's over there.\n\n593\n00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:31.720\nThe Mac address table says it's over\nthere, and I know exactly what port and\n\n594\n00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:35.390\nsend out of and this is also\npart of what makes it so fast.\n\n595\n00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:39.020\nSo if it doesn't know at the beginning,\nthat's what happens.\n\n596\n00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:43.090\nBy having this right here at the switch,\nit makes the switch work so much faster\n\n597\n00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:46.900\nalong with the A six that we just talked\nabout, this is what gives us the lightning\n\n598\n00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:50.370\nspeeds inside of our network in\ncomparison to using things like routers.\n\n599\n00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:51.010\n>> That's right.\n\n600\n00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:54.010\nAnd this is basically the difference\nbetween it and a hub.\n\n601\n00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:57.790\nIf you've built a small network before,\nmaybe you used a hub, a very small device.\n\n602\n00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:01.101\nThey look very similar to\nthe same size switches itself.\n\n603\n00:31:01.101 --> 00:31:04.744\nAnd the only real difference is\nthat with a hub, you put in data,\n\n604\n00:31:04.744 --> 00:31:06.378\nit pops it out of every port.\n\n605\n00:31:06.378 --> 00:31:09.870\nNo matter how many times you send that\ndata, it just shoves it out of every port\n\n606\n00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:13.410\nand says whoever this is destined for,\nyou might want to snatch that up.\n\n607\n00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:14.910\nEverybody else will just drop it.\n\n608\n00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:19.510\nWhere the switch knows that it goes\nfrom this port to that port, and\n\n609\n00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:22.820\nonly if it doesn't know where\na device is that you've requested\n\n610\n00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:24.180\ndoes it flood it out of every port.\n\n611\n00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:27.986\nOtherwise it just says all right,\nI know that's look at my Mac table here.\n\n612\n00:31:27.986 --> 00:31:30.708\nThat's destined for port 27,\nand out port 27 it goes.\n\n613\n00:31:30.708 --> 00:31:35.587\nHaving that Mac table is\nthe intelligence really that separates\n\n614\n00:31:35.587 --> 00:31:39.937\na switch from a hub,\nmaking them two different devices.\n\n615\n00:31:39.937 --> 00:31:41.098\n>> And that is correct.\n\n616\n00:31:41.098 --> 00:31:42.085\n>> All right, Ronnie.\n\n617\n00:31:42.085 --> 00:31:43.939\nAs switches we have covered today I think.\n\n618\n00:31:43.939 --> 00:31:45.971\n>> We have.\n>> So is there anything else we need to go\n\n619\n00:31:45.971 --> 00:31:47.823\nover before we let these good people go?\n\n620\n00:31:47.823 --> 00:31:49.235\n>> Not with switches anymor, right?\n\n621\n00:31:49.235 --> 00:31:52.455\nJust make sure that you feel comfortable\nwith some of the material that we\n\n622\n00:31:52.455 --> 00:31:53.485\npresented here.\n\n623\n00:31:53.485 --> 00:31:57.515\nThere was a lot more than\nwhat we probably actually go,\n\n624\n00:31:57.515 --> 00:31:58.855\nI wouldn't expect anybody to learn that.\n\n625\n00:31:58.855 --> 00:32:02.880\nBut if you're taking a certification exam,\nthat is part of the challenge right?\n\n626\n00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:08.150\nAs learning some more technicality and\nthis is the light end of it and\n\n627\n00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:11.170\nalso a little bit of the deep\nend just at the end there.\n\n628\n00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:13.360\nBut yes,\nlearning technical specification and\n\n629\n00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:17.310\nunderstanding how these devices work will\nhelp you out in your networking career.\n\n630\n00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:22.330\nSo pay more attention, get access to\nthem if you can and play with them.\n\n631\n00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:24.710\n>> Awesome, thank you so much for\njoining us today, Ronny, and\n\n632\n00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:26.810\nthank you for

--> 00:00:19.720\nMister Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.170\nHow's it going today, Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.350\n>> It is going great today.\n\n8\n00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.490\nToday we're continuing on,\n\n9\n00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.560\ntaking a look at the M T A, the Microsoft\nTechnology Associate, getting ready for\n\n10\n00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.060\nexam 98366, the networking fundamentals.\n\n11\n00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.216\nAnd what we're taking a look at today is\nspecifically talking about what routers.\n\n12\n00:00:36.216 --> 00:00:39.554\nRemember that as we start to\nunderstand networking fundamentals,\n\n13\n00:00:39.554 --> 00:00:43.238\nwe really did take a look in previous\nepisodes of things like the OSI model,\n\n14\n00:00:43.238 --> 00:00:46.670\nIP addressing that those\nare the foundational concepts.\n\n15\n00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.490\nIP addresses, of course, had to be\non every single device if we were\n\n16\n00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.990\ngoing to have network\ncommunication within a network.\n\n17\n00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.040\nBut now what we're moving onto as well,\nIs, of course,\n\n18\n00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.200\ncommunicating between different\nnetwork addresses too.\n\n19\n00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.600\nSo, if you remember back in\nthose IP addressing shows,\n\n20\n00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.660\nas long as your IP network, right?\n\n21\n00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.550\nYour network portion of your\nIP address is the same,\n\n22\n00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.500\nyou actually can directly communicate with\nthose other machines that actually have\n\n23\n00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.550\nthe same network portion of their address.\n\n24\n00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.160\nBut now we're talking about how\ndo we communicate outside of that\n\n25\n00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.700\nif now the network portion is different,\nwell that's where we actually have to use\n\n26\n00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.640\nspecial devices, and\nthose devices are routers.\n\n27\n00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.580\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n28\n00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.000\nYou can't get through networking\nwithout touching a router.\n\n29\n00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.530\nRouters are an integral\npart of networking today.\n\n30\n00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.150\nIt is just a fundamental thing that\nwe're gonna have to deal with.\n\n31\n00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.100\nWe're gonna have to bother with one\nfrom time to time, so it's good for\n\n32\n00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.670\nus to have some,\nsome basic understanding of how they work.\n\n33\n00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.990\nWhy do we use them?\n\n34\n00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.090\nWhat is that little thing sitting\non my desk, blinking lights at me?\n\n35\n00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.840\nWell that might be your router.\n\n36\n00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.200\nAnd basically all you need to,\nwell you don't all you need to know.\n\n37\n00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.670\nBut at least one of the foundational\nthings you know is, what does a router do?\n\n38\n00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.220\nWhy is it there?\n\n39\n00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.830\nAnd Ronnie, that's what you're\ngonna help us with today.\n\n40\n00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.170\nYou're gonna give us that understanding,\ngive us a basic knowledge so\n\n41\n00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.860\nthat when someone references a router,\n\n42\n00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.210\nhey, we have a good idea of what the heck\nthey're even talking about, right.\n\n43\n00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.480\n>> That is what our goal is, is to make\nsure we at least have a fundamental\n\n44\n00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.780\nunderstanding on what a router does and\nhow it really helps us.\n\n45\n00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.640\nWell, the very fact that you\nare connected to the Internet indicates\n\n46\n00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.490\nthat you're using a router\nof some sort out there.\n\n47\n00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.000\nNow, what you might actually not know,\nof course,\n\n48\n00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.980\nis how many routers might be between you\nand me, and what it actually does for us.\n\n49\n00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.520\nBut, we wanna at least give you\nan understanding of what's happening.\n\n50\n00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.120\nSo, let's go onto my machine here and\n\n51\n00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.420\nwe'll take a look at a basic diagram, a\nvery simple diagram that can help us out.\n\n52\n00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.310\nSo let's take for an example that what we\nneed to do, is we need to send traffic\n\n53\n00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.590\nbetween, let's say, our network over here\non the left hand side that we marked as\n\n54\n00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.130\nheadquarters, and then we have a branch\noffice over on the right hand side.\n\n55\n00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.950\nAnd then between is the internet, and on\nthe internet there can be multiple paths\n\n56\n00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.520\nthat take us between our headquarters and\n\n57\n00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.130\nalso the branch one network\nwhen we do something like this.\n\n58\n00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.780\nWell, the way that this works is,\nif I ended up using a switch.\n\n59\n00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.190\nWell, that's where I\nwould have a limitation.\n\n60\n00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.500\nSwitches can only be able to\nsend devices or send data,\n\n61\n00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.150\nexcuse me, on ports that are actually\ndirectly connected to it.\n\n62\n00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.680\nSo I might be able to send data from\nport number one to port number two,\n\n63\n00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.370\nor two port number 48, but\n\n64\n00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.720\nit doesn't allow me send data to devices\nthat are actually on different networks.\n\n65\n00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.370\nSo when I take a look at that, and\nI need to communicate off of that network,\n\n66\n00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.530\nI now need to communicate\nusing the IP address.\n\n67\n00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.720\nAnd on the OSI model, the IP address\nis on layer three of that model, and\n\n68\n00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.150\nnow we can actually send data between\ndifferent networks if we actually need to.\n\n69\n00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.050\nSo, when we take a look at\nthe headquarters router,\n\n70\n00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.330\nremember that the headquarter traffic can\nforward traffic based on the network found\n\n71\n00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.450\nalso in their routing tables.\n\n72\n00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.520\nAnd that means that the router\nalso does something special.\n\n73\n00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.780\nWhereas the switch learned\nabout MAC addresses, so\n\n74\n00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.400\nit could actually send data\nfrom one port to the other.\n\n75\n00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.550\nA router learns the IP addresses and\ncreates a table, and now\n\n76\n00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.260\nwhat can happen is as data moves through\nthat router, it checks that table out.\n\n77\n00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.500\nAnd if it can find a matching\nnetwork portion of that address,\n\n78\n00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.590\nthe destination address,\nit knows what port to send it out of.\n\n79\n00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.830\nAnd then it can put it\nout on the internet and\n\n80\n00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.440\nall the routers in between my office and\nthe branch office.\n\n81\n00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.840\nIt can do the same decision making\n\n82\n00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.080\nbased on the IP address to\nforward that on down to the line.\n\n83\n00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.380\nAnd then of course then each router\nactually has their routing tables\n\n84\n00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.730\nbuilt then, when it actually has to\nlearn how those addresses come about.\n\n85\n00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.260\nAnd we can actually put\naddresses on their statically.\n\n86\n00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.620\nIn other words, I can actually say,\nDaniel, go ahead and\n\n87\n00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.110\nthen configure this device or\nthis router with that static route.\n\n88\n00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.110\nOr, we can actually use routing protocols,\n\n89\n00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.030\nthat tell the routers to learn\nthese routes on their own as well.\n\n90\n00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.280\nSo, that is what we have as\nfar as a basic concept goes,\n\n91\n00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.370\nwhen we start talking about the router.\n\n92\n00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.750\nSo, make sure you make this distinguishing\nfeature, right here, for the exam, right.\n\n93\n00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.950\nMake sure you know the difference between\nwhat's actually the device on layer two,\n\n94\n00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:00.890\nversus layer of three.\n\n95\n00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.050\nRemember the difference\nthen between a switch,\n\n96\n00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.810\nwhich only allows you to forward data\nbetween devices that are directly\n\n97\n00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.030\nconnected to the switch, routers will\nactually just forward data onward.\n\n98\n00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.730\nEven if it's not directly connected to the\nend device, it will still hand that off\n\n99\n00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.890\nto another device that'll ultimately take\na look at that layer three address and\n\n100\n00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.820\ncontinue to forward that along its\npath until it hits this destination.\n\n101\n00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:23.660\nReally good stuff.\n\n102\n00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.150\n>> Yeah, Ronnie's basically talking\nabout how the Internet works,\n\n103\n00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.310\nto be honest with you.\n\n104\n00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.990\nWe have our own network, right?\n\n105\n00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.690\nSay Ronnie and I, we put our computers\ntogether, plug it into a switch, and\n\n106\n00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.240\nthen we plug that into our router.\n\n107\n00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.110\nRight?\nWell, that's our network.\n\n108\n00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.310\nAnything inside there, Ronnie's computer,\nmy computer, our switch, and\n\n109\n00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.900\nthe inside interface of our router,\nthat's our network.\n\n110\n00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.700\nWe can send files, do whatever we want.\n\n111\n00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.220\nBut what if I need to access\nsomebody else's network?\n\n112\n00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.420\nWhat if we have a friend,\nI want to send him a file?\n\n113\n00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.970\nHow do I get that file from my\nnetwork to his network at home?\n\n114\n00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.990\nWell, routers is basically\nhow that action happens.\n\n115\n00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.600\nIt says, you might not know how\nto get to that device, but I've\n\n116\n00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.540\ngot a network of friends, I bet someone\nof those guys knows how to get there.\n\n117\n00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.590\nAnd all I need to do is be connected\nto that network of friends and\n\n118\n00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:09.860\nthat is what our router does.\n\n119\n00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:15.600\nIt connects us to that internetwork, hence\nthe term internet, where that comes from,\n\n120\n00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.200\nand allows you to pass data across\nnetworks that you don't even know about.\n\n121\n00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.440\nThe router learns all that stuff for us\nand does all the magic behind the scenes,\n\n122\n00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.880\nso that we can have connectivity\nacross networks, and\n\n123\n00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.940\nthat's really the basic understanding\nof what does a router do.\n\n124\n00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.510\nConnects dissimilar networks together.\n\n125\n00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.610\n>> There's no doubt that that\nis what the ultimate goal is.\n\n126\n00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.510\nThe problem that we have though\nwhen working with routers is that\n\n127\n00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.760\nwe don't know about every\nsingle router that's out there.\n\n128\n00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.640\nSo, once we connect beyond our router\nwhere our business is, we can't tell you\n\n129\n00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.070\nwhether or not the next router that hits\nis ten years old or is one year old.\n\n130\n00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.990\nWe don't know if it is actually 20\nyears old that's out there and so\n\n131\n00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.620\nyou may end up finding out that along that\npath somewhere, there's gonna be some\n\n132\n00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.460\ndifferent devices which will also\noperate at different speeds.\n\n133\n00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.620\nAnd when stuff like that happens,\n\n134\n00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.590\nthat means that data will eventually\nget to it's ultimate destination, but\n\n135\n00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.640\nit may take a slower path at times, or\nit may take a faster path at times,\n\n136\n00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.640\nit really depends on the routing table and\nhow it ends up working.\n\n137\n00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.030\nSo you may end up seeing where routers\nactually will have different speeds\n\n138\n00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.320\nassociated with them depending on\ntheir interface types as well.\n\n139\n00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.100\nSo when you actually do see a physical\nrouter, you do want to look at\n\n140\n00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.250\nthe physical jacks that are actually\nplugged into that router, too.\n\n141\n00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:28.680\nAll right so,\n\n142\n00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.360\nwhat you see here are the two different\nports that I was referring to when we\n\n143\n00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.840\nstart taking a look at the different types\nof transmission speeds that can happen.\n\n144\n00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.690\nOne's a faster port and\none's actually not.\n\n145\n00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.380\nNow you're probably saying Ronnie,\nI see three separate ports.\n\n146\n00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.250\nSo what is it that you're talking about?\n\n147\n00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:44.060\nOver on the left-hand side,\n\n148\n00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.550\nwe're taking a look at the port types,\nand one says GE0/1 and then GE0/0.\n\n149\n00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:52.571\nWell, when you take a look at that,\nthat's actually gigabit,\n\n150\n00:07:52.571 --> 00:07:55.480\nethernet 0/1, gigabit ethernet 0/0.\n\n151\n00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.300\nThe zero slash zero indicates\nthe first port on the device.\n\n152\n00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:04.940\nZero slash one is the second course,\nsecond port on that device as well.\n\n153\n00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.150\nAnd so that's actually built\ninto the chassis of that router.\n\n154\n00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.850\nAnd I do have to thank Daniel for actually\nletting me use his router to show this.\n\n155\n00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:13.380\nSo we actually do see those.\n\n156\n00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:18.410\nBut over on the right hand side, notice\nthat there is another port over here.\n\n157\n00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:23.320\nAnd this one is labeled as T1DSU/CSU.\n\n158\n00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.530\nThe T1 connection is\na much slower connection.\n\n159\n00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:32.340\nSo, whereas I have gigabit ethernet over\non the left hand side of the screen.\n\n160\n00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:37.840\nThis one operates at 1000 megabits,\neach one of those ports, or one gigabit\n\n161\n00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:42.450\nThe one over on the right hand side\na T1 connection, can be well any speed.\n\n162\n00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:47.020\nAnd the maximum speed is normally\nabout 1.544 megabits, and\n\n163\n00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.750\nit can go all the way down to 56k and\neven slower if we want to.\n\n164\n00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:54.000\nSo that port over here on the right\nhand side is actually a lot slower, and\n\n165\n00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.620\nI might even have it configured\na little bit slower than that.\n\n166\n00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.380\nSo those are the actual\nports that you can see.\n\n167\n00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.050\nNow, you're probably seeing\nall this other area.\n\n168\n00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:03.600\nWell, routers are also,\n\n169\n00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.800\ndepending on who makes them,\nthey're designed to be expandable as well.\n\n170\n00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.630\nSo if Daniel actually was willing to\nput some more money into this device,\n\n171\n00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:15.450\nhe can actually buy these individual\ncards up here and keep expanding and\n\n172\n00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.370\nto add in more ports and\nmore different types of configuration.\n\n173\n00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.930\nOr he could buy what's\ncalled a network module and\n\n174\n00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:24.210\nexpand that end down here on this\nbottom one that you see too.\n\n175\n00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.580\nSo it really does give you a lot of\nconfiguration to be able to do that, but\n\n176\n00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:30.050\nspeeds are kinda one of\nthem important things\n\n177\n00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:33.160\nbecause as data goes into\nlet's say one port right?\n\n178\n00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.750\nLet's say it goes into\nthe gigabit ethernet port.\n\n179\n00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:38.230\nWell, it is having that T1 port.\n\n180\n00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:41.530\nYou've got to imagine that\nthe data coming out of that port\n\n181\n00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:44.720\nis going to be a lot slower, so\nit's going to slow traffic down.\n\n182\n00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.510\nAnd all of this is taken\ninto consideration.\n\n183\n00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:53.410\nIn routing, right, we're not so concerned\nabout how fast data gets to the end.\n\n184\n00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:57.030\nThe only thing we're really concerned\nabout is that it will get to the end.\n\n185\n00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.720\nIt is guaranteed delivery.\n\n186\n00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.310\nIt really cares nothing\nabout time sensitivity\n\n187\n00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.740\nin the majority of the traffic they carry.\n\n188\n00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.290\n>> All right Ronnie, so\nyou've showed us some great stuff here.\n\n189\n00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:10.080\nIt's some connections that we have on\nthis particular router, just basically,\n\n190\n00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.530\nany router you encounter is going to\nhave at least one interface to create\n\n191\n00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.140\na connection, cuz if it doesn't\nhave a connection, what good is it?\n\n192\n00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.390\nSo we have that down, and\nwe have the speeds down.\n\n193\n00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.290\nSome are faster, some are slower.\n\n194\n00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:22.930\nBut now we need to understand,\nhow does it happen?\n\n195\n00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:26.660\nHow does this router know how\nto get to another router,\n\n196\n00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:30.410\nor, if it doesn't know and\nit needs to know, how does that happen?\n\n197\n00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:32.720\nBasically getting into,\nhow do routers route?\n\n198\n00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.440\n>> Right.\n\n199\n00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.390\nSo when we talk about routers and\nwhat they do it,\n\n200\n00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:40.810\nright, really builds routes inside\nwhat we call a routing table.\n\n201\n00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:44.080\nSo even with those connections that we\nknow that we can make multiple connections\n\n202\n00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.800\nto be able to send data through it there\nhas to be some decision that is made.\n\n203\n00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.150\nSo inside of that device,\n\n204\n00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:52.130\nthat router, I always call them a PC but\nit's actually a router.\n\n205\n00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:55.840\nInside of that router, there's gonna\nbe memory that's actually in there,\n\n206\n00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.830\nthere's actually gonna be of course\na routing table that's in there, and\n\n207\n00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:00.460\nthat's really what a router\nis designed to do.\n\n208\n00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:05.080\nIt's designed to build routing tables to\nlearn about the routes that it needs to so\n\n209\n00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.620\nit can forward data to those\nnetworks that it needs to as well.\n\n210\n00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:11.900\nSo let me show you an example of a routing\ntable if I can actually get there.\n\n211\n00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:12.680\nThere we go.\n\n212\n00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.640\nSo on my machine, here it is.\n\n213\n00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.360\nI'm on a Cisco router and I'm consoled\nin or telnetted in is what's actually\n\n214\n00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.540\nhappening here on this router and I went\nahead and pulled up the routing table.\n\n215\n00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.330\nWhen you take a look\nat this routing table,\n\n216\n00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.490\nyou can see several different things.\n\n217\n00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:30.980\nNow, some that I did actually create, and\n\n218\n00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.840\nwe're actually gonna create\nit here in a moment.\n\n219\n00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.246\nBut some of these was actually learned\nby turning on what we call routing\n\n220\n00:11:36.246 --> 00:11:37.222\nprotocols as well.\n\n221\n00:11:37.222 --> 00:11:40.337\nSo when a router is first put on fist,\n\n222\n00:11:40.337 --> 00:11:45.590\nis first put onto a network,\nI know, I can't talk today.\n\n223\n00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:47.820\nIs first put onto a network,\n\n224\n00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:52.400\nthere's a couple of routes that it learns\nautomatically, and those are the routes in\n\n225\n00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.970\nwhich we've already configured the\ninterfaces to connect to those networks.\n\n226\n00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:00.370\nAnd those are what we call\nthe directly connected routes.\n\n227\n00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:03.680\nNow when I see the letter C it\ntells me up here in the codes,\n\n228\n00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.350\nin the legend,\nthat that is a connected route.\n\n229\n00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:10.870\nSo routers will automatically, at the very\nbeginning, learn of those routes that\n\n230\n00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.220\nit's directly connected to or\nthe networks that it's connected to.\n\n231\n00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:17.080\nAnd then you can see where it actually\nreports it off of that interface.\n\n232\n00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.890\nSo you see that there's a couple\nof them for us right here.\n\n233\n00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:25.660\nWhen we start talking about how it learns,\nso it knows how to do that, and\n\n234\n00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:29.860\nwhen it can actually do something like\nthat, we can then turn on routing\n\n235\n00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:35.120\nprotocols and the routing protocols that\nare shared between different routers,\n\n236\n00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:39.240\nwhat they can do is, they can start\nteaching each other routes as well.\n\n237\n00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.160\nSo, when you see\nthe letter O over here and\n\n238\n00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.440\nthe letter D,\nthese are two different routing protocols.\n\n239\n00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:52.430\nOne is for a routing protocol called\nEIGRP and the other one is for OSPF.\n\n240\n00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:57.950\nThese routes were actually on different\nrouters that this router is connected to,\n\n241\n00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:02.170\nand those routers send that information\nto populate this router right here.\n\n242\n00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.812\nAnd so now as data is\nactually being populated for\n\n243\n00:13:04.812 --> 00:13:07.847\nall of these different routes\nthat are available to us.\n\n244\n00:13:07.847 --> 00:13:12.836\nWell that means that any data that comes\ninto this router regardless of any\n\n245\n00:13:12.836 --> 00:13:17.824\nof those three ports, what can happen\nis that if it's coming in let's say\n\n246\n00:13:17.824 --> 00:13:20.890\non port 0/0 which is that T1 connection.\n\n247\n00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:24.559\nIf it comes in there and\nit's actually destined for\n\n248\n00:13:24.559 --> 00:13:28.850\nlet's say the 12 network hit, 192.168.12.\n\n249\n00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.180\nWell it knows that it's\ndirectly connected to it and\n\n250\n00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:35.190\nit will send that data out\na fast ethernet zero slash zero.\n\n251\n00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.720\nBut what about other routes\nthat's not directly connected?\n\n252\n00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.598\nSo let's take for\na example the 22 network down here.\n\n253\n00:13:41.598 --> 00:13:46.550\n22.22.22.22 is connected down here.\n\n254\n00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:50.450\nWell, if I have data that comes\nin from that serial connection,\n\n255\n00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:54.670\nit will come and it will match\nagainst this route at the bottom.\n\n256\n00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:59.390\nAnd we'll take a look and it says look,\nthis is how I learned about that route and\n\n257\n00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:01.530\nthis is where I actually sent it from.\n\n258\n00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:04.650\nSo instead it will forward\ndata out there as well.\n\n259\n00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:08.040\nSo dynamic routing tables\nare really the way to go.\n\n260\n00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.600\nEspecially if networks are constantly\nchanging, because if not,\n\n261\n00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.060\nI have to go in there and\nmanually change that as well.\n\n262\n00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:19.810\nSo when we talk about learning routes,\ndynamic routing protocols will do it,\n\n263\n00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:25.390\nbut we can also statically\nassign a route as well.\n\n264\n00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:26.240\nNow I wanna do that so\n\n265\n00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.690\nthat we can take a look at\nthe difference when we start seeing it.\n\n266\n00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:31.880\nSo, this routing table is fairly typical.\n\n267\n00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.560\nIt tells us the destination of the route.\n\n268\n00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.120\nIt also tells us what interface\nis gonna send it out.\n\n269\n00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:42.100\nBut then you also what we call different\nmetrics that are also involved\n\n270\n00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.200\nin this too.\n\n271\n00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.780\nNow, the metrics are actually based off of\n\n272\n00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:50.210\nhow they calculate what's the best\npossible route in the routing table.\n\n273\n00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:53.180\nOr what's that best possible route\nto that destination, I should say.\n\n274\n00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:56.340\nAnd that actually leads me to something\nI probably should have led with.\n\n275\n00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:59.140\nThe only types of routes that\nget into this routing table\n\n276\n00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:03.950\nare what we call the best route that's\navailable according to the metric.\n\n277\n00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:05.030\nAnd the reason why that's important,\n\n278\n00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:08.210\nremember that there can be multiple\npaths to a single destination.\n\n279\n00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:11.700\nBut not all of them are actually\nwhat we call the best route, so\n\n280\n00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:15.040\nusually the route with the lowest metric\nis the one that gets entered into your\n\n281\n00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.760\nrouting table as well.\n\n282\n00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.100\nSo there are a lot of considerations\nthat have to be done, but\n\n283\n00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:24.710\nhere's a great example of what can be\ndone without me having to do anything.\n\n284\n00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:26.890\nExcept for turn on the routing protocol.\n\n285\n00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:31.229\nSo I had two separate routers that had all\nthese routes available and all I had to\n\n286\n00:15:31.229 --> 00:15:35.723\ndo with this particular router here is\njust say, I want you to learn OSPF routes.\n\n287\n00:15:35.723 --> 00:15:37.889\nI want you to learn EIGRP routes.\n\n288\n00:15:37.889 --> 00:15:42.093\nAnd in just a minute or so of time, maybe\nnot even that long, it went ahead and\n\n289\n00:15:42.093 --> 00:15:44.280\nwas able to retrieve all these routes.\n\n290\n00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.120\nOr was sent all these routes and\nthat means now this router can\n\n291\n00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:51.310\neffectively route all these routes\ntoward its ultimate destination.\n\n292\n00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:53.170\nVery cool,\nwithout me having to do anything.\n\n293\n00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:56.920\n>> Yeah, it's definitely the way to fly,\nthe dynamic routing protocols.\n\n294\n00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.334\nThey are awesome.\nLike Ronnie said They're gonna learn those\n\n295\n00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:02.474\nroutes for you, instead of you\nhaving to try to figure out, okay,\n\n296\n00:16:02.474 --> 00:16:05.910\nwell here's another route that I've\ngot to put into the routing table.\n\n297\n00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:07.644\nAnd then you manually configure those.\n\n298\n00:16:07.644 --> 00:16:12.101\nNot that you don't ever do that,\nthat's the idea of static routing is,\n\n299\n00:16:12.101 --> 00:16:16.790\nsometimes I do want to say, this is\nhow I want you to get to this network.\n\n300\n00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:19.552\nAnd I know that path, and\nthis is how it needs to be.\n\n301\n00:16:19.552 --> 00:16:22.353\nBut for the most part we're going to\nnetworks that we don't really know\n\n302\n00:16:22.353 --> 00:16:23.400\nanything about.\n\n303\n00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.480\nThat's why we allow those dynamic\nprotocols to work for us, and\n\n304\n00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.570\nthey don't learn every route.\n\n305\n00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:31.621\nThey learn the best routes, otherwise\nwe'd have a myriad of routes inside\n\n306\n00:16:31.621 --> 00:16:35.561\nof a router, that would grow to\nexponential size and it would be insane.\n\n307\n00:16:35.561 --> 00:16:39.460\nAnd a little too much for even our routers\nto be to handle, to be honest with you.\n\n308\n00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:42.703\nYou'd need super high-end\nequipment to be able to handle\n\n309\n00:16:42.703 --> 00:16:44.430\nthose size of routing tables.\n\n310\n00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:48.809\nSo we allow the dynamic protocols to say,\nhey, here's the best route for\n\n311\n00:16:48.809 --> 00:16:51.644\nyou to get using this\ntype of routing protocol.\n\n312\n00:16:51.644 --> 00:16:55.460\nSo it does a lot of the work for us,\nmakes our job a whole lot easier.\n\n313\n00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.660\nCuz then all we have to do is say okay,\n\n314\n00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:01.910\nI'm gonna turn on that routing protocol\nand give it the networks that I know of.\n\n315\n00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:06.157\nAllow it to start communicating with\nother routers using the same protocol and\n\n316\n00:17:06.157 --> 00:17:07.323\npopulate its table.\n\n317\n00:17:07.323 --> 00:17:11.440\nI just sit back and relax, maybe watch\na little ITProTV, you know how it is.\n\n318\n00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.419\nAnd enjoy my day instead of having\nto do all that stuff manually.\n\n319\n00:17:14.419 --> 00:17:17.380\nThat can be a configuration nightmare,\nright Ronnie?\n\n320\n00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:20.430\n>> It really can, but it's actually\nsomething you might also see.\n\n321\n00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:22.170\nSo I wanted to show you that as well.\n\n322\n00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:24.951\nI just went in and set up a static\nroute inside of this router, so\n\n323\n00:17:24.951 --> 00:17:28.223\nthat we could take advantage of it and\nsee what it actually looks like too.\n\n324\n00:17:28.223 --> 00:17:32.571\nSo on my router,\nI configured a static route.\n\n325\n00:17:32.571 --> 00:17:35.250\nAnd when you take a look at this,\nI went ahead and copied it.\n\n326\n00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:38.930\nLet me set it so that we can actually\nsee it right here, is this route.\n\n327\n00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:39.910\nAnd they have the letter s,\n\n328\n00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:44.110\nwhich if you take a look at the legend\nup above, it says static route.\n\n329\n00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:47.515\nSo if I want to manually type in routes,\nI can.\n\n330\n00:17:47.515 --> 00:17:49.965\nSo routers can accept whether or\nnot we type them in,\n\n331\n00:17:49.965 --> 00:17:52.650\nor whether we learn them\ndynamically to do so.\n\n332\n00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:56.950\nBut when it comes down to two routes\nthat are identical, if it's a dynamic\n\n333\n00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:02.070\nrouting protocol that sent it in, if it's\na static routing protocol that sent it in.\n\n334\n00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:06.730\nWell, what you would do then, is you\nwould compare these values right here.\n\n335\n00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:09.560\nAnd those values actually\nwill say which one normally\n\n336\n00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.010\ngets entered into the routing table.\n\n337\n00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:12.650\nNow if you're looking like, well Ronnie,\n\n338\n00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:17.510\nyou just showed OSPF and this one\nactually is still in the routing table.\n\n339\n00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:21.850\nWell notice that the numbers here at the\nend, the prefix link, or the subnet mask,\n\n340\n00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:25.641\nis different, which means that it\nsees them as two different networks.\n\n341\n00:18:25.641 --> 00:18:28.700\nIf they were identical networks,\nthat would be different.\n\n342\n00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:32.890\nBut notice that this one is actually\nrouting for the entire 2.2.2 network,\n\n343\n00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:37.850\nwhereas this one's routing for\na single individual device itself.\n\n344\n00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:43.140\nSo we can see static routes appear,\nto be able to get access there.\n\n345\n00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:48.475\nNow the other issue that we have, though,\nis that sometimes, what if a route\n\n346\n00:18:48.475 --> 00:18:53.991\nis not in this routing table and my router\nactually still needs to forward it on.\n\n347\n00:18:53.991 --> 00:18:55.800\nWell, that's a problem at this point.\n\n348\n00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:00.800\nBecause if it doesn't actually appear in\nthe routing table, it has no place to\n\n349\n00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.753\nforward it on to, and so that packet\nwill die right there at that connection.\n\n350\n00:19:05.753 --> 00:19:07.048\nSo that can be a problem,\n\n351\n00:19:07.048 --> 00:19:11.270\nespecially when you want to make sure that\ndata actually gets off of the network.\n\n352\n00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:15.561\nNow I have another router, though, if I\ncan actually bring that one up here for\n\n353\n00:19:15.561 --> 00:19:16.480\na brief second.\n\n354\n00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.553\nWell, if I can find it.\n\n355\n00:19:17.553 --> 00:19:19.320\nLet's see if I can find that other router.\n\n356\n00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.290\nRouter two, there we go.\n\n357\n00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:27.733\nAnd on this particular router,\ndo show ip route.\n\n358\n00:19:31.025 --> 00:19:35.241\nThis one is a little bit different,\nbut what you see here,\n\n359\n00:19:35.241 --> 00:19:40.839\nis where it says Gateway of last\nresort is set to 192.168.12.1,\n\n360\n00:19:40.839 --> 00:19:44.303\nwhich is pointing to\nrouter one's IP address.\n\n361\n00:19:44.303 --> 00:19:49.153\nAnd this is for any network that\nactually begins with 0.0.0.0.\n\n362\n00:19:49.153 --> 00:19:53.774\nWell, that 0.0.0.0 is what\nwe call a default route.\n\n363\n00:19:53.774 --> 00:19:57.848\nAnd that's saying if it doesn't match\nanything in this routing table,\n\n364\n00:19:57.848 --> 00:20:01.813\ngo ahead and forward it to, well,\nrouter one, is what it's saying.\n\n365\n00:20:01.813 --> 00:20:05.794\nAnd down here at the bottom, you can\nsee that I manually configured that.\n\n366\n00:20:05.794 --> 00:20:08.970\nCuz it has not only the static, which\nmeans somebody manually configured it.\n\n367\n00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:13.075\nIt has the asterisk, which means\nthis is set as a default route.\n\n368\n00:20:13.075 --> 00:20:17.539\nIf it doesn't match anything else on the\nrouting table, then we're gonna forward it\n\n369\n00:20:17.539 --> 00:20:20.773\non to router one, and\nthat way it will also take care of it too.\n\n370\n00:20:20.773 --> 00:20:23.854\nSo, routers are really\nsmart devices that can\n\n371\n00:20:23.854 --> 00:20:28.320\nhelp us to be able to forward\na tremendous amount of data.\n\n372\n00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.710\nEven to networks that we are not directly\nconnected to, by issuing things like that,\n\n373\n00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:35.860\nand allowing the routers to take care\nof it on the rest of its pathway.\n\n374\n00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:36.730\nVery neat stuff.\n\n375\n00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:37.950\n>> Yeah, routers are no joke.\n\n376\n00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:39.833\nThey definitely have a lot\nof smarts behind them.\n\n377\n00:20:39.833 --> 00:20:40.847\nAs you can see,\n\n378\n00:20:40.847 --> 00:20:45.763\nbeing able to even determine what is\nthe best path to take is something that I\n\n379\n00:20:45.763 --> 00:20:47.560\nwould hate to have that job\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n380\n00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:48.420\n>> That is for sure.\n\n381\n00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.810\nI'm glad that routers do that for us.\n\n382\n00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:52.390\nNow running,\nI'm taking a look at our time,\n\n383\n00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:55.090\nwe do have a few more topics\nthat we need to go over.\n\n384\n00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:57.380\nProbably take up at least another episode.\n\n385\n00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:00.779\nSo I think this is probably a good spot\nfor us to go ahead and take a part two.\n\n386\n00:21:00.779 --> 00:21:03.880\nIs there anything you'd like to\nadd before we close this down?\n\n387\n00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.930\n>> Well,\njust don't get overwhelmed by this.\n\n388\n00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:08.100\nWe are showing you a lot of information.\n\n389\n00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.910\nBut remember the basics here, right?\n\n390\n00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:12.040\nThat routers will build a routing table.\n\n391\n00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.460\nThey'll build it either if\nI type in the routes or\n\n392\n00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.930\nI turn on routing\nprotocol to make it work.\n\n393\n00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:19.020\nIt will end up working for you.\n\n394\n00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:20.850\nThe good thing is,\nall we have to do is plug it in.\n\n395\n00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:23.540\nSo, we might be going\na little bit overboard.\n\n396\n00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:24.710\nThese are actually called out.\n\n397\n00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:26.750\nSo, you do wanna take a look again.\n\n398\n00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:28.820\nWatch this episode a couple of times.\n\n399\n00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:30.520\nTake a look at the routes\nthat we're showing.\n\n400\n00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.560\nAnd then, just try to let it soak in.\n\n401\n00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.480\nSo, make sure you do.\n\n402\n00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.220\nJust take a little bit of a breather.\n\n403\n00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:39.734\nWe're getting a little bit deeper\nthan what we would normally think.\n\n404\n00:21:39.734 --> 00:21:41.157\nBut that's what we have to do.\n\n405\n00:21:41.157 --> 00:21:44.770\n>> Yeah, they don't want you to\nbe able to configure a router.\n\n406\n00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:47.610\nBut they do want you to understand what\nis going on inside of the routers.\n\n407\n00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:50.330\nAnd that's what, hopefully,\nwe're helping you guys out with.\n\n408\n00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:52.135\nAnd hopefully we will\nsee in that part two.\n\n409\n00:21:52.135 --> 00:21:54.053\nIts gotta lot a good\ninformation in there as well.\n\n410\n00:21:54.053 --> 00:21:56.120\nWe'll be making that for\nyou very, very soon.\n\n411\n00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.390\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n412\n00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:59.644\nThanks for watching,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n413\n00:21:59.644 --> 00:22:00.395\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n414\n00:22:00.395 --> 00:22:01.938\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n415\n00:22:01.938 --> 00:22:07.830\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

everyone.\n\n4\n00:00:11.891 --> 00:00:14.750\nWelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.040\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n6\n00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.760\nJoining me today is none other than Mr.\nRonnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.660\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n8\n00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.634\n>> It's going great today.\n\n9\n00:00:20.634 --> 00:00:25.235\nIt's another great day to be right\nhere as we prepare to take at the MTA,\n\n10\n00:00:25.235 --> 00:00:28.853\nthe Microsoft Technology Associate\nexam 98366.\n\n11\n00:00:28.853 --> 00:00:33.718\nIf you're there to get your networking\nfundamentals down with that MTA,\n\n12\n00:00:33.718 --> 00:00:35.610\nwell this is the place to be.\n\n13\n00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.974\nWe've already been taking a look at\nunderstanding routers, trying to make sure\n\n14\n00:00:39.974 --> 00:00:43.580\nthat we have a solid grasp on what\na router does and the basics here.\n\n15\n00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.840\nRemember that it actually really does\nhelp us to build a routing table\n\n16\n00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.330\nwhich allows data to be\nable to be forwarded to,\n\n17\n00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.460\nwell, even devices that it's\nnot directly connected to.\n\n18\n00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.680\nWe've also already taken a look at\nswitches in previous episodes too.\n\n19\n00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.520\nSo make sure you do check\nthose episodes out as well.\n\n20\n00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.900\nBut we still have a little bit of, well,\nrouting technology that we need to at\n\n21\n00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.940\nleast understand so that we can\nactually get a grasp of that routers\n\n22\n00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.070\ndon't just do that, they can actually\ndo just a little bit more as well.\n\n23\n00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.590\n>> Yeah we got just like Ronnie said,\na little bit more to cover.\n\n24\n00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.130\nUn poquito as they say.\n\n25\n00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.500\nWell, what Ronnie's talking about,\nwhat we have left really.\n\n26\n00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.870\nIt's actually a really cool feature.\n\n27\n00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.180\nNow, this is something that may be\nhappening actually on your home systems.\n\n28\n00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.890\nYou probably don't realize it if it is,\nand\n\n29\n00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.740\nthat's cool because it's doing\nsomething for you that is awesome.\n\n30\n00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.400\nAnd the fact is that, you have an Internet\nconnection at home, I'm sure if you're\n\n31\n00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.300\nwatching this, then it's probably very\nhelpful for you to be able to do that.\n\n32\n00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.170\nBut you probably have more than one device\nconnected to that Internet connection.\n\n33\n00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.970\nWell, how does the when\nyou go to ITPro.TV,\n\n34\n00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.270\nhow do they know to send it back to\nthe laptop you're sitting on and\n\n35\n00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.710\nnot your the-\n>> Desktop.\n\n36\n00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.890\n>> Yeah,\nthe desktop sitting in the other office,\n\n37\n00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.120\nhow's it know not to send it to there?\n\n38\n00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.659\nHow does it know which\ndevice to send it to?\n\n39\n00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.308\nAnd that's what we're going to do here.\n\n40\n00:01:58.308 --> 00:01:59.690\nThat's what we're going\nto kind of explain.\n\n41\n00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.790\nHow we can use one connection for\nmultiple devices.\n\n42\n00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.270\nIt's really, really cool and\nit actually helped keep IPv4\n\n43\n00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.460\nkeep its nose above water for\na little while longer than it should have.\n\n44\n00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.350\nBut we really like it.\n\n45\n00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.060\nIt's an enjoyable thing.\n\n46\n00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.450\nIt's something we need to know about.\n\n47\n00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.380\nAnd it's called NAT, right Ronnie?\n\n48\n00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.630\n>> Yep.\nWhen we start taking a look at NAT,\n\n49\n00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.280\nwe talk about network address translation.\n\n50\n00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.520\nSo there's another one of those acronyms.\n\n51\n00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.900\nSo remember, if you're getting\ninto this field, get used to them.\n\n52\n00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.720\nThey are not going anywhere.\n\n53\n00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.150\nSo acronyms are the language\nthat we speak in IT.\n\n54\n00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.917\nNetwork address translation primarily\nwas designed to do exactly what\n\n55\n00:02:33.917 --> 00:02:37.333\nDaniel described here,\nwhich was really to try and\n\n56\n00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:42.434\nslow down the depletion of the IP version\nfor addresses out on the Internet.\n\n57\n00:02:42.434 --> 00:02:45.138\nNow, how does it do\nsomething that like that?\n\n58\n00:02:45.138 --> 00:02:49.626\nWell, what it actually began to do, along\nwith some the other technologies that\n\n59\n00:02:49.626 --> 00:02:52.596\nwe've talked about before,\nit actually allows us,\n\n60\n00:02:52.596 --> 00:02:57.610\ninstead of the signing let's say an entire\nClass C addressed to let's say Daniel.\n\n61\n00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.950\nThat gives him about 254 IP addresses\nthat are valid on the Internet.\n\n62\n00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.250\nWell instead ISPs can\ngive him one address.\n\n63\n00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.260\nWell what if Daniel has 1,000 users or\n1,000 devices on his network and\n\n64\n00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.480\nhe's only got one IP address\nthat's valid on the Internet.\n\n65\n00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.960\nWell that becomes much more challenging.\n\n66\n00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.010\nWell, internally though,\nDaniel can use those private IP addresses,\n\n67\n00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.550\nthe ones that are not\nallowed on the Internet, and\n\n68\n00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.010\nhe can actually do all the networking\ninternally the way that he chooses to do.\n\n69\n00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.390\nBut now when he trys to connect outside of\nthe Internet though well, what happens is,\n\n70\n00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.900\nthat we need the technology that\nallows all those internal addresses,\n\n71\n00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.690\nto get translated in to one or\na few addresses instead.\n\n72\n00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:49.110\nAnd that will then allow 1,000 devices to\nuse one or just a few different addresses,\n\n73\n00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.170\ndepending on the way that you\nactually have it set up to do that.\n\n74\n00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.510\nAnd so when that actually gets out to the\nInternet, if you only have one address,\n\n75\n00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.350\nwhat your network actually looks\nlike is an incredibly busy,\n\n76\n00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.710\nbusy computer that is\nconstantly sending data.\n\n77\n00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.515\nSo, let me show you just a brief diagram.\n\n78\n00:04:04.515 --> 00:04:07.575\nAnd then we'll take a look at it\nfrom the router perspective as well,\n\n79\n00:04:07.575 --> 00:04:10.105\nin how that might end up looking out here.\n\n80\n00:04:10.105 --> 00:04:12.726\nSo let's say that over here\non the left hand side.\n\n81\n00:04:12.726 --> 00:04:16.986\nThis is my network,\nthe 192.168.12.0 network.\n\n82\n00:04:16.986 --> 00:04:23.535\nWell if that is my network, there's a\npossibility of 254 hosts on that network.\n\n83\n00:04:23.535 --> 00:04:26.070\nAnd then, I have my router, and\n\n84\n00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.690\nI'm connected out here to\nthe Internet at some point.\n\n85\n00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.500\nThe cloud is actually representation\nof that Internet connection.\n\n86\n00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.440\nNow that's true and\nI have a connection like that.\n\n87\n00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.980\nNow that's perfectly fine but\n\n88\n00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.850\nwhat if I am only given one IP address\nwhen I actually go out and do that?\n\n89\n00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.730\nSo let's say that I only have one.\n\n90\n00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.543\nWell those 254 computers need to be able\nto use that one IP address to connect and\n\n91\n00:04:48.543 --> 00:04:51.494\ncommunicate wherever\nthey're actually going.\n\n92\n00:04:51.494 --> 00:04:54.477\nNow at this end I just have 3.3.3.3.\n\n93\n00:04:54.477 --> 00:04:57.210\nI just made up these addresses\nto kind of help us out.\n\n94\n00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.250\nSo as it goes across the Internet,\n\n95\n00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.780\nall of the data coming from\nthis network over here,\n\n96\n00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.780\nit really looks like it's actually going\nto come from this IP address right here.\n\n97\n00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.680\nSo regardless of what device is actually\ninside that network, it actually looks\n\n98\n00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.830\nlike it's coming from this one\ninterface and that's what happens.\n\n99\n00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.570\nBut it also works backward then,\n\n100\n00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.810\nall the traffic externally is doing\nwhat Daniel was also describing earlier.\n\n101\n00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.760\nIf there's only one out of those 254\ncomputers and it's returning it back to\n\n102\n00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.360\nthis IP address, well how does it know\nwhich computer made that request?\n\n103\n00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.710\nAnd that is because inside of the router,\nit keeps a track of those links and\n\n104\n00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.850\nthen it says, all right,\nthis is actually coming back from here.\n\n105\n00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.910\nAnd this actually belongs to\nthis one IP address inside.\n\n106\n00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.700\nSo this has to be set up on the router.\n\n107\n00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.230\nAnd it's actually not a super\ndifficult configuration.\n\n108\n00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.890\nBut it is beyond the scope of\nwhat we're talking about now.\n\n109\n00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.438\nIt's just so that we understand\nthat this is what happens.\n\n110\n00:05:56.438 --> 00:05:59.620\nThis is why we do have that\nability to do something like that.\n\n111\n00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.710\nThat's what we call overloading\na single address, right?\n\n112\n00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.580\nSo, when you do have multiple\naddresses internally, and\n\n113\n00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.380\nthen using one external address.\n\n114\n00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.960\nThat is something you may hear\nthe term NAT overload a lot of times.\n\n115\n00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.780\nOr we just call it port\naddress translation.\n\n116\n00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.820\nThat's, by far, the most typical one.\n\n117\n00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:21.270\nThere is the ability to also do what\nwe call a Static NAT address, instead.\n\n118\n00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.250\nSo what I might have for my company is\nthat I might have gotten from my ISP,\n\n119\n00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.760\nlet's say 8 or 16 or\n\n120\n00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.020\n32 different IP addresses that\nI can use out on the Internet.\n\n121\n00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.080\nWell, what I might have internally\nis let's say a web server.\n\n122\n00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.240\nAnd I need the public to get\naccess to the web server but\n\n123\n00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.820\nI have it internally on my own network.\n\n124\n00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:47.240\nWell what I can do instead of assigning\nthat one PC a public IP address.\n\n125\n00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.580\nI can just map it instead.\n\n126\n00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.660\nAnd that way only that one machine\ngets to use that one IP address so\n\n127\n00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.010\nthat when you connect you connect\nthrough that IP address and\n\n128\n00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.440\nit all goes to that one machine as well.\n\n129\n00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.860\nThere's also a way that\nyou can do just a few.\n\n130\n00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.700\nIf you wanted to take those 8 or\n16 of them and divvy them up and\n\n131\n00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.950\ndo that you can do that, as well.\n\n132\n00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:08.000\nNow when you do something like that,\n\n133\n00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.560\nit actually limits you to about\neight connections if you had eight.\n\n134\n00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.995\nSo eight connections at a time and\nthat meant that if you had a ninth,\n\n135\n00:07:14.995 --> 00:07:18.395\nthen one of those eight would have to drop\noff before they could make a connection.\n\n136\n00:07:18.395 --> 00:07:21.995\nBut, by far, the one that you and\nI are going to end up seeing though\n\n137\n00:07:21.995 --> 00:07:26.365\nis going to be that port address\ntranslation or what we call NAT Overload.\n\n138\n00:07:26.365 --> 00:07:29.550\nAll of the addresses\nare translated into one address.\n\n139\n00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.900\nSo I do have an example to\nkind of show you right here.\n\n140\n00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:37.370\nOkay, let me see if I can bring up that\nrouter that I want to bring up here.\n\n141\n00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:40.248\nLet me see if I can actually\nfind the right one.\n\n142\n00:07:42.847 --> 00:07:44.910\nOh there we go, router one,\nthat's the one that I was looking for.\n\n143\n00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:46.900\nI don't see all the ones that we have.\n\n144\n00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.810\nNow this router is set up to be that way.\n\n145\n00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:51.986\nThat on the one side of the router right,\n\n146\n00:07:51.986 --> 00:07:56.220\nis my internal network on the other side\nis set up to connect to someplace else.\n\n147\n00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:59.440\nSo this is the router\nthat is set up to handle.\n\n148\n00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.650\nNow, when we do something like this,\nright?\n\n149\n00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:03.457\nI don't really have to\nconfigure much more here but\n\n150\n00:08:03.457 --> 00:08:07.000\nI do need to generate traffic\nto make nat end up working.\n\n151\n00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.170\nSo what I'm going to do is,\nif I can find that connection again,\n\n152\n00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:11.780\nlet me go back over here.\n\n153\n00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.793\nAnd then I need to actually\nbring up router two.\n\n154\n00:08:15.793 --> 00:08:19.195\nAnd so router two,\nif it's going to connect outside.\n\n155\n00:08:19.195 --> 00:08:21.238\nLet's say to that 3.3.3.3.\n\n156\n00:08:21.238 --> 00:08:25.898\nWell I can just go ahead and ping that,\nand that way, we generate some traffic,\n\n157\n00:08:25.898 --> 00:08:31.396\nand I know that there's actually another\ndevice over there that's 33.33.33.3,\n\n158\n00:08:31.396 --> 00:08:34.800\nand I can also do that,\nand send that outbound.\n\n159\n00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:40.005\nNow if I do that, and\nthen I switch back over to router one,\n\n160\n00:08:40.005 --> 00:08:46.390\nif I haven't waited too long,\nI can do a show IP nat translations.\n\n161\n00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:51.660\nAnd then you can see where both of\nthose links it right, by sending\n\n162\n00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:57.320\nout just a ping from that one IP address,\nit got translated into 13.1 even though\n\n163\n00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:02.000\nI was on router two, which had a 12.2\naddress and that's where you see this.\n\n164\n00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.810\nAnd then it actually got out to\nthe other machines that I sent it to.\n\n165\n00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:09.730\nThese other machines, when they send it\nback, they're sending it to this global\n\n166\n00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:13.750\naddress, which will then\ntranslate it back inside as well.\n\n167\n00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:18.130\nSo this happens all the time with just\nabout every network that's out there.\n\n168\n00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:21.260\nNow, this is a small little,\ntiny example but\n\n169\n00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.390\nif you were actually to see this live\nit would be constantly filling up.\n\n170\n00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:27.560\nThe screen would be rolling is what\nyou would normally have inside of\n\n171\n00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.690\na regular network.\n\n172\n00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:31.340\nSo, these devices can be\nset up to handle that and\n\n173\n00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.810\nthat's normally where you\ndo see it set up to do so.\n\n174\n00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:36.800\nWhy?\nBecause we don't really need to see\n\n175\n00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.900\nevery single one.\n\n176\n00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.160\nWe just need to know it's\nactually working and happening.\n\n177\n00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.150\nAnd so, a router is a great place for it\nbecause normally what happens on routers\n\n178\n00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.880\nis kind of the same thing as switches.\n\n179\n00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:50.210\nYou normally set it and forget it unless\nyou actually have to add in a new route or\n\n180\n00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:52.110\nthere's something wrong with the machine.\n\n181\n00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.800\nSo this is a perfect place for it.\n\n182\n00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.840\n>> Yeah, let the router do the job, right?\n\n183\n00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.668\nThat's what it's there for.\n\n184\n00:09:56.668 --> 00:10:00.604\nTo take that load off of us not to have\nto do a bunch administrative things.\n\n185\n00:10:00.604 --> 00:10:03.226\nNow Ronnie I'm looking at\nyour configuration there,\n\n186\n00:10:03.226 --> 00:10:06.310\nit's got the addresses and\nit has a colon and a number.\n\n187\n00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:10.090\nI understand the IP address,\nwe covered that, but what's that colon and\n\n188\n00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:10.720\nnumber all about?\n\n189\n00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.720\n>> All right, So\n\n190\n00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.600\nyeah let's just bring that up again\nI just kind of took it away, but\n\n191\n00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.220\nif we bring that up we can actually see\nwhat Daniel's actually talking about too.\n\n192\n00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:22.030\nWhen we do this port address translation,\n\n193\n00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:25.940\nthere's a number that's actually assigned\nto keep that traffic separated out.\n\n194\n00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.450\nAnd this number is generated\nat the router itself so\n\n195\n00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:33.390\nthat when we do have even let's say the\nsame machine goes out to try and connect.\n\n196\n00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:36.930\nNot only using,\nlet's say a web traffic, right?\n\n197\n00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.530\nIf I'm also connecting\nout there to use email.\n\n198\n00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:41.120\nIf I'm doing something else.\n\n199\n00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.640\nAll of that traffic has to be kept\nseparated as it comes back in.\n\n200\n00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.720\nSo I may have one IP address internally,\nbut then I'm actually connecting five,\n\n201\n00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.450\nsix, seven different times.\n\n202\n00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:54.650\nAnd then also, I may actually open up\ntwo web browsers, two web traffics.\n\n203\n00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.300\nSo what it does is it actually\nhelps to distinguish that.\n\n204\n00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.010\nAnd when they add in that\nlittle number after the colon,\n\n205\n00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:04.680\nthat is actually the nat address\ntranslation port number.\n\n206\n00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:11.190\nAnd it can generate up to 65,535\nof them when it actually needs to.\n\n207\n00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:14.730\nSo, normally you do see it actually\nstart to generate and pop up there.\n\n208\n00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.950\nAnd then after awhile when nobody\nactually is using it again,\n\n209\n00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.920\nthe entire table will clear out and\nthen it will start all over.\n\n210\n00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.740\nBut it's always filling up in\na regular network translation.\n\n211\n00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.480\nHere with two things it's not gonna do it.\n\n212\n00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.080\nAnd I'm gonna try and run that again.\n\n213\n00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.090\nYou notice it's actually gone now,\nbecause it doesn't need it so\n\n214\n00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:31.810\nwhy keep it in the table here?\n\n215\n00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:33.320\nBut that's what that colon's about.\n\n216\n00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.790\n>> Awesome, so that's really cool.\n\n217\n00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:37.090\nSo I've got a bunch of machines\non my internal network,\n\n218\n00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:42.700\nI only have one actual routable IP address\nto use to get out to the Internet.\n\n219\n00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:43.730\nAll it does is says, all right,\n\n220\n00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:47.780\nwell you've got this inside address\nI'm gonna add this port number to it.\n\n221\n00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:52.330\nI'm gonna close all that up inside\nof my actual, routable address.\n\n222\n00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:53.490\nI'm gonna send that to\nwhere it needs to go.\n\n223\n00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:57.660\nWhen it comes back, that little number\nlets me know which one of the devices\n\n224\n00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:01.110\non my network it's destined for,\nand then it easily sends that back.\n\n225\n00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:02.500\nIt's a very cool process, Ronnie.\n\n226\n00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:06.148\n>> It really is, because it happens\nwithout you and me having to try and\n\n227\n00:12:06.148 --> 00:12:08.974\nfigure out is it actually\nworking correctly or not?\n\n228\n00:12:08.974 --> 00:12:09.842\nThe configurations and\n\n229\n00:12:09.842 --> 00:12:12.538\nthe way that they normally design these\nthings to work in the background.\n\n230\n00:12:12.538 --> 00:12:14.990\nIn other words,\nsmarter people than you and me, and\n\n231\n00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:16.786\nI'm not saying you're not a genius.\n\n232\n00:12:16.786 --> 00:12:19.379\nBut in other words, people that actually\nhave figured out how this works and\n\n233\n00:12:19.379 --> 00:12:20.363\nhow it's supposed to work.\n\n234\n00:12:20.363 --> 00:12:24.465\nThey make it work thousands, if not\nhundreds of thousands of times, maybe even\n\n235\n00:12:24.465 --> 00:12:29.190\nper minute depending on the organization,\nor maybe even per second, for all I know.\n\n236\n00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:30.394\nSo I couldn't do that.\n\n237\n00:12:30.394 --> 00:12:32.144\nI can barely add four digit numbers\n\n238\n00:12:32.144 --> 00:12:33.132\ntogether-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n239\n00:12:33.132 --> 00:12:34.446\n>> two of them in a minute.\n\n240\n00:12:34.446 --> 00:12:37.600\nBetter yet thousands and\nthousands of times per second.\n\n241\n00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.402\n>> Oh yeah.\nYou don't wanna see my math skills.\n\n242\n00:12:39.402 --> 00:12:40.645\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They are.\n\n243\n00:12:40.645 --> 00:12:41.965\nThey're not pretty.\n\n244\n00:12:41.965 --> 00:12:43.518\nThank you Mrs. Jenkins.\n\n245\n00:12:43.518 --> 00:12:45.775\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I have horribly ruined you.\n\n246\n00:12:45.775 --> 00:12:46.999\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> All right Ronnie,\n\n247\n00:12:46.999 --> 00:12:49.140\nso anything else about\nnat before we move on?\n\n248\n00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.230\n>> Not so much about nat, but\ndo remember that is a process, and\n\n249\n00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.480\nyou're gonna see it.\n\n250\n00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:58.210\nMore than likely this idea\nof nat is not an off shoot,\n\n251\n00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:00.850\nit's not a side road, it's not a tangent.\n\n252\n00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:02.510\nIt really is a part of networking.\n\n253\n00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:06.770\nNow, the funny thing about nat right,\nit was never designed to be permanent.\n\n254\n00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:08.620\nThat was 20, 30 years ago.\n\n255\n00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:09.672\nIt wasn't designed to be permanent.\n\n256\n00:13:09.672 --> 00:13:14.125\nThey just said no, nat is one of\nthose transitional technologies that\n\n257\n00:13:14.125 --> 00:13:18.205\nwas really supposed to hold us\nover until IPv6 got ready for us.\n\n258\n00:13:18.205 --> 00:13:20.010\nSo that we could use that instead.\n\n259\n00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:20.815\n>> Heck of a transition.\n\n260\n00:13:20.815 --> 00:13:23.307\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it's a slow boat turn.\n\n261\n00:13:23.307 --> 00:13:25.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is like turning the Titanic\n\n262\n00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.130\naround, it takes hours and hours.\n\n263\n00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:32.950\nWell this particular turn took 20,\n30 years, is what the turn's taking.\n\n264\n00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:36.780\nBut once we move to IPv6 in theory,\nin theory yet,\n\n265\n00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:40.730\nthat's the only thing I can say,\nis that we don't need nat anymore.\n\n266\n00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:44.670\nNat itself works, but\nit does cause other networking issues\n\n267\n00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:48.400\nthat what we've had to do was actually\nis go, okay, so nat caused this issue.\n\n268\n00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.396\nSo how do we work around it?\n\n269\n00:13:50.396 --> 00:13:52.770\nAnd then you actually go okay,\nthat's one way of working on it, oh and\n\n270\n00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:53.950\nthat caused this issue too.\n\n271\n00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:57.517\nAnd there's always been a workaround,\nand the strange thing is,\n\n272\n00:13:57.517 --> 00:13:59.119\nnat itself was a workaround.\n\n273\n00:13:59.119 --> 00:14:01.902\nBecause we were depleting\nout of IP addresses, and\n\n274\n00:14:01.902 --> 00:14:05.398\nI'm like look this is what we'll do,\nwe'll break the rules and\n\n275\n00:14:05.398 --> 00:14:10.019\nwe'll use this technology to make it work\nbecause IPv6 is right around the corner.\n\n276\n00:14:10.019 --> 00:14:10.601\nFor 30 years.\n\n277\n00:14:10.601 --> 00:14:11.126\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n278\n00:14:11.126 --> 00:14:12.410\n>> It's right around the corner.\n\n279\n00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:13.481\n>> It's coming, Ronnie.\n\n280\n00:14:13.481 --> 00:14:14.201\nIt's gonna be here soon.\n\n281\n00:14:14.201 --> 00:14:17.568\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, it's amazing but\n\n282\n00:14:17.568 --> 00:14:21.780\nthat's kind of the neat\nhistory about networking.\n\n283\n00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:22.430\nIt really is.\n\n284\n00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:25.960\n>> Networking is an interesting,\nnot only technical topic, but\n\n285\n00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.460\nhistorical topic as well.\n\n286\n00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.500\nIt really has shaped our country,\nour culture, our world.\n\n287\n00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:33.790\nEven with the advent of\nnetworking technologies.\n\n288\n00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:34.399\nVery, very cool stuff.\n\n289\n00:14:34.399 --> 00:14:39.001\nNow speaking of networking technologies,\nwe're in the vein of routers.\n\n290\n00:14:39.001 --> 00:14:41.470\nWe wanna route things and wanna set up.\n\n291\n00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:43.590\nBut routers cost a little bit of money.\n\n292\n00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:45.880\nEspecially the ones that you\ncan configure and manage.\n\n293\n00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.529\nAnd sometimes I just need to set\nup a router quick and dirty like.\n\n294\n00:14:49.529 --> 00:14:54.219\nOr maybe for a specific reason and I don't\nwanna have to buy a bunch of hardware.\n\n295\n00:14:54.219 --> 00:14:56.297\nSometimes I can use actually\nwhat I already have.\n\n296\n00:14:56.297 --> 00:14:59.095\nNow, we're studying for a Microsoft exam.\n\n297\n00:14:59.095 --> 00:15:03.109\nWe're going, we're probably using\nMicrosoft operating systems,\n\n298\n00:15:03.109 --> 00:15:04.340\ndesktop and server.\n\n299\n00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:08.740\nAnd the cool thing is, if you do\nhave that server software installed,\n\n300\n00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:12.300\nyou actually have some capabilities for\nrouting built into it.\n\n301\n00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.600\nAnd Ronnie, this is something that\nthey have that's been around for\n\n302\n00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.920\na little while.\n\n303\n00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.910\nAnd it has saved a lot of peoples' bacon.\n\n304\n00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:21.520\nI know that I've used it\nin emergency situations.\n\n305\n00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:26.350\nNot as my main routing solution, but for\nspecific instances this has been very,\n\n306\n00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:27.210\nvery helpful.\n\n307\n00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:29.370\nAnd you're gonna help us out with this,\nright?\n\n308\n00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:30.990\n>> Right.\nThere's a lot of times where if\n\n309\n00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:33.670\nyou can actually get access\nto a server 2008 machine,\n\n310\n00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:36.880\neven though it's not a dedicated router.\n\n311\n00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:41.646\nThere is software on it that allows you to\nconvert it to actually be used as a router\n\n312\n00:15:41.646 --> 00:15:42.216\nas well.\n\n313\n00:15:42.216 --> 00:15:45.750\nNow, back in the early days of\nthese server products right,\n\n314\n00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:49.298\nit was actually a lot more robust\nin its routing technology.\n\n315\n00:15:49.298 --> 00:15:51.830\nBecause they included it in\nmultiple routing protocols.\n\n316\n00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:56.298\nToday, because they realized something\nthat what you're having to do then is\n\n317\n00:15:56.298 --> 00:16:00.426\nactually use a server As a router,\nwell they’ve kind of reduced that and\n\n318\n00:16:00.426 --> 00:16:03.660\nlimit it to certain\nrouting protocols instead.\n\n319\n00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.050\nAnd static routing.\n\n320\n00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:07.060\nSo let’s remember the difference here,\nright?\n\n321\n00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:08.393\nRemember that with static routing,\n\n322\n00:16:08.393 --> 00:16:11.366\nit means I manually configure the routes\nto get entered into to the routing table.\n\n323\n00:16:11.366 --> 00:16:16.300\nWith dynamic routing, it means we\nactually turn on some routing protocol.\n\n324\n00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.870\nAnd there are several of them.\n\n325\n00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:22.990\nThere's OSPF, there's EIGRP, there's RIP.\n\n326\n00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:26.730\nThere's a few other ones that are out\nthere, but those are kinda the big three.\n\n327\n00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:29.810\nAnd, actually, one of them is kinda going\naway, which is the one that's called RIP,\n\n328\n00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:32.800\nis really kinda making it's\nway into the background.\n\n329\n00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.060\nBut now, with Server 2008,\n\n330\n00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:39.020\ninstead of the earlier editions here,\nthey said look, let's be realistic here.\n\n331\n00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.828\nIs that,\nif we need to use a server as a router,\n\n332\n00:16:41.828 --> 00:16:45.652\nthat's probably the only option\nthat's really left for you.\n\n333\n00:16:45.652 --> 00:16:51.421\nSo they did not make the most robust\nin their features on this router,\n\n334\n00:16:51.421 --> 00:16:53.120\nbut you can do that.\n\n335\n00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.295\nNow what are the minimum\nrequirements if you were to do that?\n\n336\n00:16:55.295 --> 00:17:00.960\nWell, one usually is gonna be that\nyour server that you're gonna use for\n\n337\n00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:05.650\nthis, that you're running Server 2008 on,\nit needs to have two network interfaces.\n\n338\n00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:08.160\nSo, you can try and do it with one, but\n\n339\n00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.680\nit's probably not gonna do the way that\nyou think it's gonna do very well.\n\n340\n00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.440\nSo you normally need two,\nand the reason why,\n\n341\n00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.090\nis because we're routing between\nseparate networks, right?\n\n342\n00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:19.010\nSo I need one interface to represent\none network, I need another interface\n\n343\n00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:22.610\nto represent the other network, and\nthen we can route between them.\n\n344\n00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:25.708\nTwo, if you were wanting to use\na dynamic routing protocol,\n\n345\n00:17:25.708 --> 00:17:29.850\nthat means you're actually gonna choose to\nrun something that we call RIP, which is,\n\n346\n00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:32.700\nof course,\nthe Routing Information Protocol, itself.\n\n347\n00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:36.230\nAnd so those are kind of\nthe limitations that we have.\n\n348\n00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:39.459\nNow, regular hardware based routers,\nright, they can do a lot more.\n\n349\n00:17:39.459 --> 00:17:42.310\nBut they do, they have to have\na minimum of two routers,\n\n350\n00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:44.850\nis what we have to actually be able to do.\n\n351\n00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:48.600\nSo what I wanna do is I wanna kind of show\nyou what we're talking about here, and\n\n352\n00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.170\nshow you it can actually work as a router.\n\n353\n00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.460\nSo let's go ahead and go to our computer.\n\n354\n00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.220\nI went ahead and\nbrought up the Server Manager.\n\n355\n00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:57.042\nI'm running Server 2008R2, and\n\n356\n00:17:57.042 --> 00:18:00.695\nwhat we'd normally do is we would install\nthe role for routing remote access.\n\n357\n00:18:00.695 --> 00:18:02.920\nNow, I've previously done that.\n\n358\n00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.060\nIf you want to learn more about that,\n\n359\n00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:06.910\nmake sure you do check out\nthe server shows that you have.\n\n360\n00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:10.170\nBut if you install it, it's actually\none we call Network Policy and\n\n361\n00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:11.720\nAccess Services.\n\n362\n00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.510\nAnd from there you have to make sure\nyou turn on Routing and Remote Access.\n\n363\n00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:17.930\nAnd those are the keys that\nyou walk through, right?\n\n364\n00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:21.220\nIt's usually a menu system after\nyou hit this Add Roles button, and\n\n365\n00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.380\nyou just select that,\nthat you want to do routing and\n\n366\n00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.870\nthen you actually have to\nconfigure it after that.\n\n367\n00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:28.100\nNow this one is actually\nalready configured.\n\n368\n00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.993\nSo when you take a look at it here,\nunder Routing Remote Access,\n\n369\n00:18:30.993 --> 00:18:32.722\nyou'll see several things, right?\n\n370\n00:18:32.722 --> 00:18:34.445\nHere are my network interfaces, and\n\n371\n00:18:34.445 --> 00:18:37.789\nyou see I have two of these network\ninterfaces that are connected here.\n\n372\n00:18:37.789 --> 00:18:41.600\nAnd they both say that they're\ndedicated and they are connected.\n\n373\n00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.680\nAnd then there's other things that\nare going on in the background.\n\n374\n00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:48.082\nBecause I selected that I wanna do\nsome other things, here's some ports.\n\n375\n00:18:48.082 --> 00:18:51.570\nSo, we can use what we call the virtual\nprivate network connections.\n\n376\n00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:55.840\nAnd then it's down here,\nI have IPv4 and IPv6.\n\n377\n00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.950\nIf I am routing right now,\n\n378\n00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:03.470\neven though IPv6 is viable,\nit's not viable across everything.\n\n379\n00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:07.080\nSo normally what we're gonna\nfocus in on is going to be IPv4.\n\n380\n00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.960\nAnd you can see that under\nIPv4 on routing mode access,\n\n381\n00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:14.560\nthere's a general tab that again\nshows these two network connections.\n\n382\n00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.520\nAnd then there's static routing.\n\n383\n00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:21.200\nIf I want to enter a static route, I can\nright click and go new static route and\n\n384\n00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.100\nthen type it in here.\n\n385\n00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:25.150\nTell it what interface is\nactually going to where.\n\n386\n00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:29.250\nAnd that's from here, I might actually\nbe able to type in let's say 3.3.3 and\n\n387\n00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:34.410\nthen whatever the subnet mask was for\nthat network, I would type that in here.\n\n388\n00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:39.952\nAnd then to tell it where in the world\nthis is gonna be sent out of 2168.\n\n389\n00:19:39.952 --> 00:19:42.270\nlet's say 13.3.\n\n390\n00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:44.940\nAnd then we would set a metric,\nif we were to do this.\n\n391\n00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:49.280\nNow normally a static round metric\nis gonna be a metric of one.\n\n392\n00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.780\nAnd then you would select that in there.\n\n393\n00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:52.800\nIt doesn't like my, what didn't it like?\n\n394\n00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.750\nOh, it didn't like my\ndestination like that.\n\n395\n00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:58.650\nNow it actually needs a network,\nso that's actually fine.\n\n396\n00:19:58.650 --> 00:19:59.620\nSo we can go in there and\n\n397\n00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:03.720\nmanually configure it just like we\ndid on the router if we choose to.\n\n398\n00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.154\nAnd if we do that, right,\nwe're just telling it that look, hey,\n\n399\n00:20:06.154 --> 00:20:08.337\nwe know better than what\nthe routing protocol's gonna do.\n\n400\n00:20:08.337 --> 00:20:10.900\nAnd we can set that up.\n\n401\n00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:16.000\nBut, if we want to actually go ahead and\nalso be able to configure\n\n402\n00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.690\nrouting using a routing protocol,\nwell, I simply right-click on general.\n\n403\n00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:23.080\nAnd from there I select\nnew routing protocol.\n\n404\n00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.780\nAnd notice it allows me to do NAT.\n\n405\n00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:27.566\nSo we can do that network address\ntranslation right here if we want to.\n\n406\n00:20:27.566 --> 00:20:30.280\nOr I can select RIP Version 2.\n\n407\n00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:34.520\nNow you're probably saying, when in\nthe world would I do NAT on this router?\n\n408\n00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:39.380\nIf this is gonna be your final exit\nbefore you go out onto the Internet,\n\n409\n00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.160\nthis is what you're gonna use, is NAT.\n\n410\n00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:46.100\nNow, does Microsoft recommend\nthat you use Server 2008 as\n\n411\n00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.110\nthe main gateway to go outside?\n\n412\n00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:49.800\nNo, but can you?\n\n413\n00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.366\nYes, okay.\n\n414\n00:20:50.366 --> 00:20:54.330\nSo if you say, in a pinch,\nthis is the only one in my branch office.\n\n415\n00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:56.140\nI need a router, but\nI really can't go out and\n\n416\n00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.550\nbuy one of those other\nhardware based routers.\n\n417\n00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:00.680\nYou just simply turn on NAT from there,\nand\n\n418\n00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.890\nthen everything inside's gonna get\nNATed out, whatever your public IP\n\n419\n00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:08.020\naddress is gonna be, and you'll be fine,\nand it'll work just fine as well.\n\n420\n00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:09.636\nNow, remember that right here though,\n\n421\n00:21:09.636 --> 00:21:12.499\nthis is what they are probably\nthinking you're gonna choose instead.\n\n422\n00:21:12.499 --> 00:21:15.199\nIf you're only gonna be routing for\nyour own network, so\n\n423\n00:21:15.199 --> 00:21:18.536\nyou have multiple branch offices,\nbut actually still need a router.\n\n424\n00:21:18.536 --> 00:21:22.015\nAnd this is one of those branch\noffices and you can run RIP,\n\n425\n00:21:22.015 --> 00:21:24.870\nrouting information protocol, here.\n\n426\n00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:26.970\nWell, this will allow you to do that.\n\n427\n00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:31.070\nSo all you have to do is select that\nRIP Version 2, and then you click OK, and\n\n428\n00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:34.770\nin a moment here you'll see\nthat another node popped up.\n\n429\n00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:36.760\nAnd there it is for RIP.\n\n430\n00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:40.133\nOnce we select that, I just tell it\nthe interfaces I want it to route for.\n\n431\n00:21:40.133 --> 00:21:41.626\nSo I'm just gonna select, let me see,\n\n432\n00:21:41.626 --> 00:21:43.770\nI don't know if it will let me\nselect both of them or not.\n\n433\n00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:45.270\nNope, one at a time.\n\n434\n00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:48.570\nSo I select one, and\nthen there's a lot of details there, and\n\n435\n00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:50.350\nnow that adds it in there.\n\n436\n00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:53.309\nAnd then if I select it again and\ngo to New Interface,\n\n437\n00:21:53.309 --> 00:21:56.485\nI'm gonna add in the other one here,\nand then click OK.\n\n438\n00:21:56.485 --> 00:21:59.340\nNow, you're not gonna see\nanything appear immediately.\n\n439\n00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:04.068\nAnd the reason why is because the way\nthat RIP works is it only accepts what we\n\n440\n00:22:04.068 --> 00:22:05.580\ncall periodic update.\n\n441\n00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:06.780\nIn other words, it's saying.\n\n442\n00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:08.530\nyou're not going to rush me.\n\n443\n00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:11.550\nI will send out updates when I'm ready.\n\n444\n00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:15.640\nAnd I will receive updates from routers\nwhen they are ready to send it out to me.\n\n445\n00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.490\nBut you are not gonna force me,\nat any point,\n\n446\n00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:21.490\nto actually make an update any\nquicker than I want to be.\n\n447\n00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:23.640\nSo it could be that it\nactually may take a minute.\n\n448\n00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:28.181\nUsually it takes about 30 seconds before\nyou actually start seeing a response\n\n449\n00:22:28.181 --> 00:22:29.110\nis sent.\n\n450\n00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:32.130\nAnd then on the other side it\ncan be up to five or six minutes\n\n451\n00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:36.930\nbefore a response comes back, depending\non how those timers end up working out.\n\n452\n00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:40.551\nSo this is what ends up happening here,\nis that these things are turned on and\n\n453\n00:22:40.551 --> 00:22:42.654\nthen they are just\nlistening to each other.\n\n454\n00:22:42.654 --> 00:22:47.810\nSo if you are gonna use Server\n2008 just kind of remember, right?\n\n455\n00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:50.305\nThat you're probably gonna actually\nonly use this one routing protocol.\n\n456\n00:22:50.305 --> 00:22:53.619\nIf you're gonna do that more than\nlikely if you use anything like this,\n\n457\n00:22:53.619 --> 00:22:57.910\nit's probably gonna be static routes\nespecially for a fairly small network.\n\n458\n00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:02.070\nTurning on RIP on this is very possible,\nbut most of the time what they recommend,\n\n459\n00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:03.950\nof course,\nis that you go to a hardware device.\n\n460\n00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:05.088\nThat's because it's dedicated to do that.\n\n461\n00:23:05.088 --> 00:23:08.753\nSo, normally, if this is my\nonly server and I'm doing this,\n\n462\n00:23:08.753 --> 00:23:11.929\nI'm probably also running\nthings like DNS and DHTP.\n\n463\n00:23:11.929 --> 00:23:14.705\nIt's still doing some other\nstuff in the background.\n\n464\n00:23:14.705 --> 00:23:18.027\nWhich makes it not the best option\nif this is my main connection out to\n\n465\n00:23:18.027 --> 00:23:21.292\nthe internet and it's having to do\nthat NAT and all that stuff, and\n\n466\n00:23:21.292 --> 00:23:24.052\nstill having to do all the other\nthings that it has to do.\n\n467\n00:23:24.052 --> 00:23:26.142\nSo, can it work in a pinch?\n\n468\n00:23:26.142 --> 00:23:28.560\nYes, should it be your full-time router?\n\n469\n00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:31.010\nProbably not.\nSo, just kinda be aware.\n\n470\n00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:35.031\n>> Yeah, this is gonna be the, you're up\nat midnight trying to get things working,\n\n471\n00:23:35.031 --> 00:23:37.322\nyou're still at work and\nyour router is dead.\n\n472\n00:23:37.322 --> 00:23:39.530\nAnd you're like oh no, what am I gonna do?\n\n473\n00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.224\nThere's no stores open, I can't\nAmazon Prime it at this point in time.\n\n474\n00:23:42.224 --> 00:23:44.190\nI need something now.\n\n475\n00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:46.140\nI can't wait till tomorrow,\nI gotta have it now.\n\n476\n00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:48.910\nWell then, you can use your server,\nmaybe you've got a NIC laying around.\n\n477\n00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:51.810\nYou grab that guy, slap it in there,\nget everything running.\n\n478\n00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:54.179\nTurn on that routing and remote access,\nand you should be good to go.\n\n479\n00:23:54.179 --> 00:23:58.460\nYou put kind of a band-aid on a chest\nwound kind of thing going on there.\n\n480\n00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.300\nRonnie, is there anything else we\nneed to know about this cool service?\n\n481\n00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:03.621\n>> Yeah, I just wanted to show that right\nnow you're actually starting to see\n\n482\n00:24:03.621 --> 00:24:06.430\nsomething happen and\nit just took a moment before it happened.\n\n483\n00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:07.810\nI just had to refresh it, and\n\n484\n00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:11.150\nnow you're starting to see where it\nactually is sending out three responses.\n\n485\n00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:13.030\nAnd this is where it can take,\nlike I said, five or\n\n486\n00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:15.070\nsix minutes before it comes back in.\n\n487\n00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:17.703\nIt'd be nice if it actually just said,\nokay, as soon as I get a response,\n\n488\n00:24:17.703 --> 00:24:18.901\nI'm gonna send something back.\n\n489\n00:24:18.901 --> 00:24:20.897\nBut that's the nature of RIP.\n\n490\n00:24:20.897 --> 00:24:22.800\nIt's not very fast.\n\n491\n00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.418\nIt can take as long as it wants to, and\n\n492\n00:24:24.418 --> 00:24:27.150\nthere's nothing you're gonna\ndo to say speed up, speed up.\n\n493\n00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:28.540\nIt's not gonna work.\n\n494\n00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:29.949\nIt's just going to do this thing.\n\n495\n00:24:29.949 --> 00:24:34.038\nBut in probably about 10 or 15 minutes it\nactually will have exchanged routes with\n\n496\n00:24:34.038 --> 00:24:37.010\nthe other routers turned on on\nthe other side of this thing.\n\n497\n00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:40.120\n>> Yeah, it sounds like they should\ncall it the really independent protocol,\n\n498\n00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.541\ncuz I don't listen to you,\nI do what I want, right?\n\n499\n00:24:42.541 --> 00:24:43.239\n[LAUGH]\n>> That is true,\n\n500\n00:24:43.239 --> 00:24:45.359\nit does route by rumor that way,\nsure enough.\n\n501\n00:24:45.359 --> 00:24:47.960\n>> All right, well, Ronnie,\nthanks for those cool demonstrations.\n\n502\n00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:52.280\nObviously, things that we need to know\nabout routers, why, how they work.\n\n503\n00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:56.110\nAnd then that Microsoft actually has\na solution in case you need it and\n\n504\n00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:58.510\nyou don't have a hardware\ndevice sitting around.\n\n505\n00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:00.960\nIf somethings goes down,\nyou can implement that solution.\n\n506\n00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:01.750\nVery, very cool.\n\n507\n00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:02.730\nThank you for that.\n\n508\n00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:03.900\nThank you guys for watching.\n\n509\n00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:06.210\nWe're gonna to go ahead and\ncall it a day for this episode.\n\n510\n00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:09.155\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrey.\n\n511\n00:25:09.155 --> 00:25:09.934\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n512\n00:25:09.934 --> 00:25:10.840\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n513\n00:25:10.840 -->

great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:13.902 --> 00:00:14.639\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n5\n00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.079\nJoining me in the studio today is\nmy good friend and colleague, and\n\n6\n00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:22.030\nthe man that knows just about\neverything about this Microsoft exam.\n\n7\n00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.080\nMr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.690\nHow's it going today Ronnie?\n\n9\n00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:25.500\n>> It's going great.\n\n10\n00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.120\nIt's another great day to be right\nhere as we continue to take a look\n\n11\n00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.200\nat the MTA\nthe Microsoft Technology Associate.\n\n12\n00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.650\nGetting ready for that exam 9836.\n\n13\n00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.380\nThe networking fundamentals exam\nis what we're talking about.\n\n14\n00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.300\nAnd so today we are moving\nbeyond switches and routers.\n\n15\n00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.190\nThese are kind of\nthe mainstays that you and\n\n16\n00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.560\nI are gonna end up seeing if\nwe're dealing with networking.\n\n17\n00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.750\nThose two components are probably the big\nones that we've actually had to address.\n\n18\n00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.870\nBut as important as those are,\nas important as that is,\n\n19\n00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.090\nI should say, we actually also have to\ndiscuss how we connect to those devices,\n\n20\n00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.760\nwhich normally has to deal with some type\nof media when we start dealing with that.\n\n21\n00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.210\nAnd that's when we start\ntalking about cabling,\n\n22\n00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.080\nand we actually have to start talking\nabout even just more than that.\n\n23\n00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.800\nCuz it seems like well,\n\n24\n00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.990\nI'll just take a piece of wire and plug it\nin and I should be ready to go, Daniel.\n\n25\n00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.800\nBut the problem is there's\na lot more to that, isn't it?\n\n26\n00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.760\n>> Yeah, there is a lot more.\n\n27\n00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.488\nAt first I thought he meant\nnews media outlets, the media.\n\n28\n00:01:18.488 --> 00:01:19.210\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n29\n00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.200\n>> But it's not that kind of media.\n\n30\n00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.180\nNo, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n31\n00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.690\nIt is the physical media that\nconnects the devices together.\n\n32\n00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.980\nNow, like Ronnie said,\nit can be as simple as oh, it's the wire.\n\n33\n00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.190\nThat's what we're talking about.\n\n34\n00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.960\nYes, that is exactly\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n35\n00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.450\nBut what about the wire makes it special?\n\n36\n00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.620\nWhy do we use this wire versus that wire,\nthis connector versus that connector.\n\n37\n00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.810\nWhy is all this different, and\nhow does it work together?\n\n38\n00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.590\nThat's what we wanna know, and\neven into the wireless technology,\n\n39\n00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.670\nwell there is no wire,\nthey just connect magically.\n\n40\n00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.150\nThat's at least, that's what I was told.\n\n41\n00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.060\nApparently there is some\ntechnology behind it.\n\n42\n00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.500\nWhich Ronnie is so gracefully decided\nto show today and teach us all about.\n\n43\n00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.160\nRonnie, let's start with\nthe wired specifications and\n\n44\n00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.020\nwork our way through that.\n\n45\n00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.660\n>> Yeah, so when we start\ntaking a look at the idea what,\n\n46\n00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.550\nsometimes you hear the term bounded media\n>> We usually just say cabling.\n\n47\n00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's what we normally call it,\n\n48\n00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.550\nsome type of cabling.\n\n49\n00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.640\nNow, when we start dealing with cabling,\nin networking the most prolific\n\n50\n00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.270\ncabling that you're going to see\nis some type of copper cabling.\n\n51\n00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.890\nAnd usually the wire's going\nto look something like this.\n\n52\n00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.310\nIt's going to have two connectors,\none on each end.\n\n53\n00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.970\nI don't want to unravel the whole thing.\n\n54\n00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.710\nBut you tend to have these two connectors,\nand inside,\n\n55\n00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.070\nof course,\nyou have a certain length of cable.\n\n56\n00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.360\nNow, these specific connectors\nthat we're talking about here,\n\n57\n00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.650\nthese are also the most prolific\ntype of connectors that you'll see.\n\n58\n00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.850\nOn the back of every computer and\njust about every device, router, switch,\n\n59\n00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.390\nwhatever, it's gonna have a very\nstandardized type of jack in them\n\n60\n00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.570\nthat will accept this connector.\n\n61\n00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.060\nAnd this is what we call an RJ45\nconnector, is what we call it.\n\n62\n00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.460\nSo, with this RJ45,\n\n63\n00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.310\nit allows you to have eight little\nseparate wires inside of them.\n\n64\n00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.460\nSo what it can do is actually\nallow you to transmit data and\n\n65\n00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.380\nalso receive data as well,\nand usually at the same time.\n\n66\n00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.510\nSo these cables are by far the most\nprolific ones that you'll end up seeing.\n\n67\n00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.240\nNow, the other one that I also have right\nhere, I'm trying to make sure I grab\n\n68\n00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.730\nthe right one, is also one that\nwill look more like this one here.\n\n69\n00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.350\nNow, this is a different type of cabling.\n\n70\n00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.580\nWhereas the other one that\nwe talked about here,\n\n71\n00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.480\nthis allows us to connect to\njust about every single machine.\n\n72\n00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.450\nThis one could if they have\nthe right network adaptor.\n\n73\n00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.650\nThe big difference between both of\nthese is that this one uses copper and\n\n74\n00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.080\nthe reason why is that we're gonna\ntransmit some type of electrical signal\n\n75\n00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.700\ndown this one.\n\n76\n00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.810\nThis one right here though is\nwhat we call a fiber optic cable.\n\n77\n00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.520\nSo, each of these ends,\nthese are a little bit different, and\n\n78\n00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.510\nthey can be the exact same, but these\nends are actually designed to when you\n\n79\n00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.460\nplug into that device to be able to\ntransmit light impulses down one wire and\n\n80\n00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.370\nalso to receive light\nimpulses on the other wire.\n\n81\n00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.180\nAnd so these cables,\n\n82\n00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.320\neven though they really help us to do the\nsame things, they are actually different.\n\n83\n00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.000\nThey do provide a little\nbit of differences\n\n84\n00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.960\nin terms of distance that\nwe can run these cables.\n\n85\n00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.770\nAlso, the speed that we can actually\nsend data down those cables as well and,\n\n86\n00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.930\nof course,\nthey do different things, you know,\n\n87\n00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.300\nin the way that we transmit\nthe data signals down them as well.\n\n88\n00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.390\nSo, when we start taking a look though,\n\n89\n00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.580\none of the easiest things to forget\nabout something like this is\n\n90\n00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.530\nwhere in the world do all these\nthings belong on the OSI model?\n\n91\n00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.410\nNow you might think, oh no,\nnot that OSI model again,\n\n92\n00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.390\nhe mentioned that in like six or\nseven shows now, at least.\n\n93\n00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.720\nIf you think about it, probably\nevery show that we've actually done,\n\n94\n00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.810\nwe've mentioned that but this is one of\nthe most important concepts that we have.\n\n95\n00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.390\nSo Daniel, if you were to think about\nboth of these here, and you were to take\n\n96\n00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.650\na guess, do you think that they\nare actually on the same OSI layer?\n\n97\n00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:46.930\n>> That would be my guess.\n\n98\n00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.360\nI would say that they are both layer\none devices because they are physical.\n\n99\n00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.250\nI can hold them.\n\n100\n00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.040\nThat's about it.\n\n101\n00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.825\nThey don't do anything\nother than carry a signal.\n\n102\n00:04:55.825 --> 00:04:58.640\n>> And that's exactly\nthe way to think about this.\n\n103\n00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.640\nSo even though fiber optic\nsounds much more exotic.\n\n104\n00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.851\nOoh, very European!\n\n105\n00:05:02.851 --> 00:05:10.333\n[LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] When you hear\nthe term fiber optic, it's neat, right?\n\n106\n00:05:10.333 --> 00:05:13.030\nYou go, man, fiber optic,\nthat sounds cool.\n\n107\n00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.630\nAnd you hear the term wire, [LAUGH]\nyou kind of don't get the same feel.\n\n108\n00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.840\nBut they both do exactly what Daniel said.\n\n109\n00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.680\nThey're not there to inspect the traffic.\n\n110\n00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.480\nThey're not there to look and see,\nis this traffic worthy of fibre optic?\n\n111\n00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.620\nOr is it only worthy of\na copper cable here.\n\n112\n00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.000\nThe only thing that they're designed\nto do is actually carry that data.\n\n113\n00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.360\nAnd so when we start talking\non that OSI model, right?\n\n114\n00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.800\nThat seven layer model.\n\n115\n00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.120\nWe are now talking about that layer one,\nwhich is the physical layer.\n\n116\n00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.400\nNow, the big difference, though,\nbetween both of these is fairly simple.\n\n117\n00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.590\nThis one uses electrical signal, and\n\n118\n00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.960\nthis one uses some sort of light\nimpulse to carry that data along.\n\n119\n00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.440\nSo if we were to compare them and\nit's actually fairly easy.\n\n120\n00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.120\nI'm gonna make it easy on you Daniel,\nlight and electricity.\n\n121\n00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.782\nWhich one do you think\ntravels faster in data terms?\n\n122\n00:06:02.782 --> 00:06:04.960\n>> You know,\nI only made it through the third grade but\n\n123\n00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.051\none of the last things I remember is\nlight is a pretty quick substance.\n\n124\n00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:10.480\n>> [LAUGH] It is.\n\n125\n00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.590\n>> I mean maybe even the quickest\nsubstance as I recall.\n\n126\n00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.030\n>> Yeah it's one of the fastest\nthings that we can deal with.\n\n127\n00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.560\n>> So when we start talking about just\ngenerally delivering data from one\n\n128\n00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.090\npoint to the other, it is generally\naccepted that light is going to be faster.\n\n129\n00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.530\nSo usually this is what everybody\nwould love to run in their homes.\n\n130\n00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.870\nThink about it, If I actually had\na connection going to my home for\n\n131\n00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.580\nmy ISP to come in where I\ncan get Internet access.\n\n132\n00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.627\nDo I want fiber or\ndo I want a regular cable signal?\n\n133\n00:06:36.627 --> 00:06:40.560\nEverybody on the planet will tell you no,\nfiber optic is the way to go.\n\n134\n00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.890\nYou can transmit a lot more\non this type of cable and\n\n135\n00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:49.350\nit also gives you a lot more speed\nif everything is actually right.\n\n136\n00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:54.110\nSo the comparison of both of these, these\nare by far the two that you're gonna see\n\n137\n00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.760\nthe most often when you start\ndealing with networking.\n\n138\n00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.030\nNow when you're working with\nregular computer workstations,\n\n139\n00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.750\nthis is probably the one\nthat you'll see more often.\n\n140\n00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.760\nThe reason why, it's more durable.\n\n141\n00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.360\nRight?\n\n142\n00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.520\nSo, this is much more flexible.\n\n143\n00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.830\nYou can pull on it,\nI'm not saying just yank it apart here.\n\n144\n00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.990\nYou can pull on it a little bit,\nit actually moves around,\n\n145\n00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.260\nit's fairly flexible.\n\n146\n00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.540\nIt allows us to actually be able to move\nworkstations around when we need to.\n\n147\n00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.820\nWithout really worrying about\nthe integrity of the wire too much.\n\n148\n00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:20.680\nNow don't get me wrong,\n\n149\n00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:25.110\nif you keep stomping the heel of your\ncowboy boots on it, yes, it's gonna break.\n\n150\n00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:27.570\nBut even rolling a chair over it or\n\n151\n00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:32.560\nso, it might kind of compromise a little\nbit but not exactly the worst thing.\n\n152\n00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.510\nDaniel, you roll a rolling chair\nover this thing, it's gonna break.\n\n153\n00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:38.540\n>> Yeah,\nyou're gonna buy a new one real quick.\n\n154\n00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.160\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's a delicate,\n\n155\n00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.860\ndelicate piece of equipment right there.\n\n156\n00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.650\n>> And that's what we have to realize too.\n\n157\n00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:47.230\nSo a lot of these cables, and you probably\nsee I'm holding this one loosely.\n\n158\n00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.330\nI didn't wrap it around like this guy,\nright?\n\n159\n00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:50.830\nWhere you see it wrapped around like this.\n\n160\n00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.770\nYou notice I'm not doing\nthat with this thing here.\n\n161\n00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:58.336\nAnd that's because this fiber inside,\nthe one that really does carry the data\n\n162\n00:07:58.336 --> 00:08:03.920\nsignal along it, It is thinner than\na human hair is what we're talking about.\n\n163\n00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.440\nSo, it's very easy to break, and so even\nthough you can wrap it around and they do\n\n164\n00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.420\nput strengthening fibers around it, you\ndon't wanna be tying a knot in this thing.\n\n165\n00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:13.290\nGo, okay, no big deal.\n\n166\n00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:16.190\nYou don't wanna crunch it and put into\nyour pocket or your back pocket and\n\n167\n00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.170\nwalk around with it.\n\n168\n00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:19.270\nYou do want to make\nsure it's fairly loose.\n\n169\n00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.790\nThat it can actually hold\nwhatever shape it needs to.\n\n170\n00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.980\nAnd this one is not really good and\ndesigned for things like workstations and\n\n171\n00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:29.990\nPCs and laptops, and the reason why is\nbecause as you continue to move it around\n\n172\n00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.570\nthat's where you're going to start\ndamaging it, so normally where you see\n\n173\n00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:36.470\nsomething like this is going to be\ninside of a server closet somewhere.\n\n174\n00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.840\nSo you are working in a big organization\nand they have that room locked up, and\n\n175\n00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:43.490\nyou go, man, what are all those little\ntiny cables going between those devices?\n\n176\n00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:44.860\nLot of times it's gonna be right here,\n\n177\n00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:48.950\nas a cable that looks like this\nis what we're talking about.\n\n178\n00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:54.410\nSo just trying to distinguish them is\nsomething that we really need to do too.\n\n179\n00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:58.880\nNow, we can talk about other things as\nwell when we start dealing with this\n\n180\n00:08:58.880 --> 00:08:59.720\ntoo, okay?\n\n181\n00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.380\nSo let's spend a little bit of time on\nfiber optics as I'm still holding in my\n\n182\n00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.830\nhand that's probably the easiest\none to think about here.\n\n183\n00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:09.710\nSo with the fiber optic cable, well even\nthough this cable is relatively short,\n\n184\n00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:14.950\nI can send a fiber optic signal down these\ncables, depending on their specifications,\n\n185\n00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:16.170\na good distance.\n\n186\n00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:17.370\nNow when I say that,\n\n187\n00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:21.490\nsome of them are rated to carry\nthem up to hundreds of meters.\n\n188\n00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:23.680\nNow, that's pretty good, right?\n\n189\n00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.450\nThat's 300 feet, maybe longer and stuff.\n\n190\n00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:27.400\nSo yeah, that's a pretty good distance.\n\n191\n00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:32.260\nBut some of them can actually be run to\nmiles, and even the longest specification\n\n192\n00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:39.000\nfor this thing can be run up to like 27,\n28 miles long on a single run.\n\n193\n00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:39.590\nNow, when you do that,\n\n194\n00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:42.390\nthat means that the light source\nthat we got is super powerful.\n\n195\n00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:46.130\nSo you heed that warning very well,\ndo not look directly at the laser.\n\n196\n00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.180\nThat one you don't even\nwanna come close to look,\n\n197\n00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.740\nit might burn a hole right to\nyour head if you did that.\n\n198\n00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.120\nBut that's what you're looking at,\nthe ones that are usually inside\n\n199\n00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:58.080\nof our server closets,\nthey may not be as powerful as that, but\n\n200\n00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.610\nthey do tend to actually send\na lot of signal out of them.\n\n201\n00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:02.870\nSo you do want to be careful inside.\n\n202\n00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:06.520\nSo just kind of realize that this\none gives you more distance and\n\n203\n00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:11.160\nit also has the potential to give give\nyou more data as far as the band width,\n\n204\n00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.600\nin other words,\nhow much it can send you at one time, too.\n\n205\n00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.720\nThis is the one that you'll see.\n\n206\n00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.410\nNow, there are a lot more specifications\non something like this, though.\n\n207\n00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:23.510\nOn this particular type\nof cable right here,\n\n208\n00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:28.570\nthere's always a lot of printing on the\njacketing of this cable that you have, and\n\n209\n00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:31.550\nthat's actually trying to describe\nthe specifications of it.\n\n210\n00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:38.200\nSo usually, with this, you hear the term\nUTP, or unshielded twisted pair of cable.\n\n211\n00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.810\nUnshielded twisted pair of cable tells you\nthat if you're actually describing that,\n\n212\n00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:45.090\nnormally you're describing\neight conductors inside,\n\n213\n00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:50.150\nand they're going to be color coded, and\nthey're also twisted into four pairs.\n\n214\n00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:53.710\nAnd those pairs are actually designed\nto allow you to send data down\n\n215\n00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:55.950\none pair if you're actually\ntransmitting data and\n\n216\n00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:01.520\nto receive data down another pair if\nyou also need to do that as well.\n\n217\n00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.820\nSo that's normally the one that\nwe see just about everywhere.\n\n218\n00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.150\nThere are special cables that\nalso provide a shielding and\n\n219\n00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:12.850\nthat one is what we call shielded\ntwisted paracable as well.\n\n220\n00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:16.420\nNow the neat thing about this,\nI say neat but it's just a specification.\n\n221\n00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.620\nIn other words somebody\ndecided at some point in time,\n\n222\n00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:24.170\nthat the maximum distance that we can\nrun a single cable between devices,\n\n223\n00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:28.350\nis going to be 100 meters or\nabout 328 feet.\n\n224\n00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:31.270\nSo about the single length\nof a football field.\n\n225\n00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:34.460\nNow does that mean you should\njust do that if you want to?\n\n226\n00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.030\nNo, you shouldn't just do that\njust because you want to.\n\n227\n00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.010\nIn theory, it can handle it.\n\n228\n00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:42.350\nBut the problem is, the longer that you\nrun copper, think about this, Daniel,\n\n229\n00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:45.760\nthe longer we run copper the more that,\nfor one reason or another,\n\n230\n00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.160\nwhen you plug that thing into a radio,\nwhat happens?\n\n231\n00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.410\n>> It loses signal.\n\n232\n00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:51.070\nIt just degrades.\n\n233\n00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:52.470\nThe farther it has to stretch and\n\n234\n00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:55.760\npush that signal, its just going to\nstart to degrade and break down.\n\n235\n00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:00.240\nWe'd have to have like a super,\nsuper large, the transmitter,\n\n236\n00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.340\nthat's what I'm looking for.\n\n237\n00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.605\nNow the transmitter would have to be super\npowerful to get it to go any farther,\n\n238\n00:12:04.605 --> 00:12:06.595\nso it starts becoming\nimpractical after that.\n\n239\n00:12:06.595 --> 00:12:08.652\n>> Yeah, we talked about it\nfrom the standpoint of data,\n\n240\n00:12:08.652 --> 00:12:10.361\nlike what Daniel's talking about, right?\n\n241\n00:12:10.361 --> 00:12:14.613\nIf I try and send an electrical signal\ndown this thing 300 meters, it's going to\n\n242\n00:12:14.613 --> 00:12:18.080\ncome down to that very end and\nyou may get the signal and you may not.\n\n243\n00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.970\nNow in theory they're saying look\n100 meters is the maximum distance.\n\n244\n00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:23.680\nSo they're saying this is where we\nbelieve data signal is going to\n\n245\n00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.970\ndegrade to a point where you're not going\nto actually want it any more than that.\n\n246\n00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:29.200\nSo normally most people\ndon't tend to run this.\n\n247\n00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.090\nThe other problem that we have\nwith running something that long\n\n248\n00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:32.510\nis it becomes an antenna.\n\n249\n00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:35.120\nSo that means that if you keep running it,\nand you actually kind of\n\n250\n00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:39.900\nbundle this together with like five or six\nwires, it becomes a really strong antenna.\n\n251\n00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:43.380\nAnd now, all of the sudden,\nyou're running 100 meters of that wire.\n\n252\n00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.950\nAnd you've now got a good antenna,\n\n253\n00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:50.328\nto the point where it can actually\nabsorb a lot more voltage.\n\n254\n00:12:50.328 --> 00:12:54.263\nSo this thing is actually susceptible,\nif I said that word right,\n\n255\n00:12:54.263 --> 00:12:57.091\nsusceptible too while interference, right?\n\n256\n00:12:57.091 --> 00:13:02.220\nThis one is incredibly susceptible\nto electromagnetic interference.\n\n257\n00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:05.300\nThis fiber optic cable, though, isn't.\n\n258\n00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.160\nSo we don't have to\nworry about this thing.\n\n259\n00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.600\nIf we run it 20 miles or\n\n260\n00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:13.160\nnot, electromagnetic interference is not\ngonna actually be the downfall of this.\n\n261\n00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.580\nUsually the downfall of this is\nwhen somebody says you know we got\n\n262\n00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.550\nthat water main over there.\n\n263\n00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:22.650\nHey, don't break the fiber optic,\nyou broke the fiber optic.\n\n264\n00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:23.690\n>> Call before you dig, Ronnie.\n\n265\n00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:24.770\n>> Call before you dig.\n\n266\n00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:25.920\nThat's exactly right.\n\n267\n00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.450\nSo that's normally what this\nthing is susceptible to, right.\n\n268\n00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:33.880\nSo it's not susceptible to a lot of\nother things, but breakage it is.\n\n269\n00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.900\nThis though, you do have to account for\n\n270\n00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.900\nelectricity that you may\nactually end up running.\n\n271\n00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:39.710\nIt can do that.\n\n272\n00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:44.180\nNow by itself, most of these things,\nthey do have twists in them.\n\n273\n00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:48.140\nThey're suppose to help to shield\nthem from what we call EMI, right,\n\n274\n00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:49.915\nelectromagnetic interference.\n\n275\n00:13:49.915 --> 00:13:50.730\nBut the problem is,\n\n276\n00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:55.730\nthe longer it actually is, the more\nthat becomes overcome by just physics.\n\n277\n00:13:55.730 --> 00:14:01.210\nThat's the real nature of a lot of these\ncables that we do have to worry about.\n\n278\n00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:04.270\nSo, this one, though, is also limited\n\n279\n00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:09.300\nby the very fact that if you send too much\ndata at the same time, it will heat up.\n\n280\n00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:09.830\nWhy?\n\n281\n00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:11.160\nIt's copper, right?\n\n282\n00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:16.130\nSo there comes a point when you can't send\ndata any faster along it or things will\n\n283\n00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:20.400\nstart melting internally, and that's\nsomething that we do have to worry about.\n\n284\n00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.160\nNow, in theory though, right?\n\n285\n00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.760\nThese connector ends are plastic.\n\n286\n00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:27.380\nIf you're sending that much data\nthose things should melt first, but\n\n287\n00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:32.040\nthey can melt anywhere along the inside\nof this stuff, and that's the problem.\n\n288\n00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.900\nRight?\nEven if you have some damage,\n\n289\n00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.100\nthis wire gets overheated,\nyou don't know anywhere along this cord.\n\n290\n00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:42.420\nYou can't pinpoint exactly where\nthat particular damage took place.\n\n291\n00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:47.010\nSo as far as a media types go and\n\n292\n00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:52.530\na bounded media goes, right,\nwe have actual cables,\n\n293\n00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:55.920\neither one, those are are kind of\nthe big specifications that we do\n\n294\n00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.962\nhave to worry about when we start to think\nabout trying to connect devices together.\n\n295\n00:14:59.962 --> 00:15:03.560\n>> Now Ronnie, when it comes to speed\nhow fast is something like that versus\n\n296\n00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:04.440\nfiber optic cable?\n\n297\n00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.390\n>> That's a great question when\nwe start thinking about it.\n\n298\n00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:07.600\nOnce again, this one,\n\n299\n00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.680\nthough, it really depends on what\nwe call the category of the cable.\n\n300\n00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:15.958\nSo you'll hear people refer to it as\ncat five cabling or cat five cabling,\n\n301\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.137\nCat-5E cabling.\n\n302\n00:15:17.137 --> 00:15:19.670\nWell it really depends on the category.\n\n303\n00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.510\nThat's what they describe here, and\n\n304\n00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:26.270\nthat category is about the frequency\nthat we can send along this wire.\n\n305\n00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:29.850\nThe higher the frequency,\nthe more data that we can send along it.\n\n306\n00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:34.460\nSo usually when you start off for the\nbasics, and most buildings and anything\n\n307\n00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:38.670\nprobably lasts ten or fifteen years right,\nit's going to be at least a cat five.\n\n308\n00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:41.920\nAnd you also hear it described\nas fast ethernet cable.\n\n309\n00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.833\nWhen you hear that term,\nthat's gonna be 100 megabits.\n\n310\n00:15:45.833 --> 00:15:47.819\nI was trying to make sure\nI described that right.\n\n311\n00:15:47.819 --> 00:15:49.910\n100 megabits per second.\n\n312\n00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:51.590\nSo that's pretty fast.\n\n313\n00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:55.532\nJust about on most switches that\nwe plug into in networks today,\n\n314\n00:15:55.532 --> 00:15:59.110\n100 megabits is fast enough\nto do just about anything.\n\n315\n00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:03.010\nI would love to have an Internet\nconnection that would be 100 megabit\n\n316\n00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:04.130\nconnection.\n\n317\n00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:07.420\nAnd you end up people going oh, you need\ngigabit internally in your networks.\n\n318\n00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:10.840\nWell, your high end machines do,\nyour servers do, but\n\n319\n00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:14.650\nmost end user workstations, 100 megabit\nconnection would be lightning fast,\n\n320\n00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:16.510\nno matter where you are in the world.\n\n321\n00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:19.455\nSo CAT5 is normally what you see.\n\n322\n00:16:19.455 --> 00:16:22.380\nCAT5e gives you even more than that.\n\n323\n00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:26.790\nSo you think about 100 megabits,\nthat's 100 million bits per second.\n\n324\n00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:33.140\nA gigabit is a billion bits per second\nwhen you start transmitting data,\n\n325\n00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.480\nto be able to do stuff\nthat we're talking about.\n\n326\n00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.810\nWell, CAT5e can give you up to\na billion bits per second, but\n\n327\n00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:42.490\nwhen they do so, that one operates\nat the same frequency as CAT5.\n\n328\n00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:45.960\nAnd then you have CAT6 that still says,\nhey,\n\n329\n00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:49.990\na billion, but it actually transmits\nit with a higher frequency,\n\n330\n00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:53.040\nwhich allows it to be able to do\nwhat we call bursting as well.\n\n331\n00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:57.690\nSo it can actually go beyond that without\nactually causing a lot of problems too.\n\n332\n00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:00.810\nSo you do have these different categories,\nand so\n\n333\n00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:02.850\nwhat do most buildings\ndo if you're brand new?\n\n334\n00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:04.380\nThey try to futureproof, right?\n\n335\n00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:08.380\nSo they tend to install CAT6\ncable inside of the wall so\n\n336\n00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:10.972\nwhen you plug in network jack,\nthe interior is ready for\n\n337\n00:17:10.972 --> 00:17:14.480\nwhenever your network upgrades, even if\neverybody else on your network is actually\n\n338\n00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:18.740\nrunning CAT5 cables for things like\nconnecting to workstations and stuff.\n\n339\n00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.930\nIt's right here that you have to worry.\n\n340\n00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:24.450\nNow, or not worry,\nknow those specifications I should say.\n\n341\n00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:26.680\nAll right, so what about this one?\n\n342\n00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.930\nThis one has the potential, and\nthat's what we have to say.\n\n343\n00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:32.140\nIt has the potential to be unlimited.\n\n344\n00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:37.170\nRight now they have not found\na limitation to the amount of data and\n\n345\n00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:40.450\nthe speed we can actually\nlimit to this thing, okay?\n\n346\n00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:44.170\nNow, just when I say that, you're saying,\nwell, there are specifications to it.\n\n347\n00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:46.300\nThere's tons of specifications to this.\n\n348\n00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:50.930\nBut unlike the copper cabling that has\nan upper limit specification because\n\n349\n00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:55.850\nof the way that copper works, after a\nwhile, too much heat, it melts, this one,\n\n350\n00:17:55.850 --> 00:18:00.230\neven though you actually see that there\nis actually an upper limit to it,\n\n351\n00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:03.100\nat some point,\nit's an open ended specification.\n\n352\n00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.650\nThey're saying right now this\nis the fastest we've actually\n\n353\n00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:06.620\nbeen able to run it.\n\n354\n00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:10.590\nAnd every time we think that we can't run\nit any faster, this thing holds out and\n\n355\n00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:11.760\nactually gives you a lot more.\n\n356\n00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.200\nAnd so they actually made an open ended\nspecification where they're saying\n\n357\n00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.200\nit's potentially unlimited.\n\n358\n00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.790\nThe limitation right now of course is\nactually where you tend to use it and\n\n359\n00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:22.300\nthe speed of your devices.\n\n360\n00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:24.300\nAnd that's the only real limitation here.\n\n361\n00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:28.300\nSo this one can actually transmit anywhere\nbetween gigabits to 10 gigabits and\n\n362\n00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:32.220\nusually the 10 gigabit limit is\nwhen we start running it inside of\n\n363\n00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:36.960\ndata centers and between super\nspeed devices inside of there.\n\n364\n00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.660\nSo we don't normally hit\nthe upper end of this one at all.\n\n365\n00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.410\n>> Yeah, that's pretty impressive stuff.\n\n366\n00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:43.600\nThat fiber optic business is no joke.\n\n367\n00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.540\nThey've got it laid everywhere.\n\n368\n00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:48.220\nAnd like we said, call before you dig\nbecause that's when you see those signs.\n\n369\n00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:50.510\nBecause there's fiber optic cable running\nunderneath the ground right there.\n\n370\n00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:51.690\nThey don't want you to bust through it.\n\n371\n00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:55.380\nIt's usually some Internet backbone or\nsomething, and when your cable goes out or\n\n372\n00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:58.790\nyour Internet goes out, somebody's\nprobably done something like that.\n\n373\n00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:02.000\nIt happens actually a little more\nfrequently than guys like Ronnie and\n\n374\n00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.650\nI would like, that's for sure.\n\n375\n00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:05.610\nAll right, moving on to wireless.\n\n376\n00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:07.240\nWe talk about wire,\nwe need to get into wireless.\n\n377\n00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.970\nIt's really the big hot topic nowadays,\n\n378\n00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:12.560\nthat's how I like to\nconnect my devices at home.\n\n379\n00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.180\nI use a wireless router,\n\n380\n00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:18.420\nI use wireless cards inside of my\ncomputers to connect to that network.\n\n381\n00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:24.330\nIt is the wave of the future, and while\nit's had a little trouble keeping up with\n\n382\n00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:29.350\nthe wired specifications as far as speed\ngoes, it is starting to make some headway.\n\n383\n00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:32.300\nAnd Ronnie, you're gonna help us out a\nlittle bit with some of the differences in\n\n384\n00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.320\nthe wireless devices that we\nmight see in a network today.\n\n385\n00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.230\n>> We really are gonna take\na look at the wireless,\n\n386\n00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:41.340\nbecause we are actually starting to\nsee people depend on it more and more.\n\n387\n00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:45.420\nThere is no doubt that the wired gives us\nfaster speed, and if we can connect them,\n\n388\n00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:46.470\nwe want to.\n\n389\n00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:50.130\nThe limitation then, behind the wired\nconnections, is fairly simple.\n\n390\n00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:53.730\nYou're tethered to whatever device that\nyou actually are connected to, right?\n\n391\n00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:55.010\nSo if you're running a workstation,\n\n392\n00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:57.820\nyou have to actually be tethered\nto the network, you have a cable.\n\n393\n00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:01.090\nAnd there's no way that you\ncan actually leave that cable.\n\n394\n00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:03.440\nIf you disconnect it, you're disconnected.\n\n395\n00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.870\nSo the problem that you have then is,\nhow do you get beyond that?\n\n396\n00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:13.030\nWell, wireless technology gives us\nthe ability to compute while being mobile.\n\n397\n00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:16.950\nSo it actually allows us to compute on\nthe go, and this is something that is very\n\n398\n00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:21.840\nimportant to us, because it means I no\nlonger am tethered to a single location.\n\n399\n00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.880\nAnd not only that, though,\nwith that type of connection,\n\n400\n00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:28.700\nI can have multiple devices\nconnect at one time as well.\n\n401\n00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.780\nSo when we start taking a look\nat wireless networking,\n\n402\n00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:34.460\nusually there's a couple of standards\nthat we must pay attention to.\n\n403\n00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:39.240\nAnd this is what is called the IEEE,\nIEEE, 802.11 standards.\n\n404\n00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.790\nAnd there's actually a few standards.\n\n405\n00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:46.340\nLet me go ahead and show you on my\ncomputer here, on the standards as well.\n\n406\n00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:49.610\nAll right, so here are some of the\nstandards that you are actually going to\n\n407\n00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:52.000\nencounter with the 802.11 standards.\n\n408\n00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.130\nNow, over here on the left-hand side,\nthat's the biggest I can make it for\n\n409\n00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:56.910\nright now, I can continue to zoom in.\n\n410\n00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:59.950\nBut what we're taking a look at here,\nright, are these standards and\n\n411\n00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:01.140\nthese speeds.\n\n412\n00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:05.210\nSo most of the wireless access\npoints that we have available to us\n\n413\n00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:07.682\nare gonna run in 802.11g,\nand today, 802.11n.\n\n414\n00:21:07.682 --> 00:21:13.030\nNow, most people say, 11 technically\nis 11, but 11 will actually be fine.\n\n415\n00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:17.956\nSo if we hear somebody say 802.11,\nthey'll go, oh, no, no, no,\n\n416\n00:21:17.956 --> 00:21:23.110\nno, Ronnie said 802.11 and\nthat's the way you're supposed to.\n\n417\n00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:24.978\nLet them say whatever they want to,\n\n418\n00:21:24.978 --> 00:21:29.103\nbut just kind of realize that's the kind\nof standards that we're looking at.\n\n419\n00:21:29.103 --> 00:21:30.871\nWhat about a and b, and when you see that?\n\n420\n00:21:30.871 --> 00:21:34.190\nYes, those are still out there,\nbut most people don't use them.\n\n421\n00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:37.920\nToday where you'll see it is at g and\nn, and that's what we want to focus on.\n\n422\n00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:38.810\nNow the ac standard,\n\n423\n00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:41.730\nthat's actually the ones that we're\nstarting to see come out now.\n\n424\n00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:44.980\nSo you don't see it as being\nvery popularized right now.\n\n425\n00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:49.780\nSo notice the speed here, we can have\na 54 megabit connection over wireless, or\n\n426\n00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:52.190\neven up to 600 megabit now.\n\n427\n00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:55.900\nThat's actually quite a jump in the\nstandardization when you start seeing it.\n\n428\n00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:59.080\nAnd the reason why is actually\na little bit different here, okay?\n\n429\n00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:04.110\nWhen you take a look at the 802.11g,\nyou're using one single antenna.\n\n430\n00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:05.800\nNow, why does that make a difference?\n\n431\n00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.960\nBecause in wireless connections,\n\n432\n00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:11.020\nthis is something that really\ndoes trip us up a lot of times.\n\n433\n00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:15.440\nWhen we actually run some wireless access\npoint, only one person is using it at\n\n434\n00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:20.270\nany one time, and when I say that, they're\neither sending, or they're receiving.\n\n435\n00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:22.530\nSo they're not actually sending back and\nforth,\n\n436\n00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:26.650\nthat one person, either that device\nis sending, or it's receiving.\n\n437\n00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:30.040\nAnd so, if a second person comes on,\nwell, they either are sending or\n\n438\n00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:33.420\nreceiving, but two people are not\nactually connected simultaneously.\n\n439\n00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:36.860\nNow, you might go, oh no, I know, cuz\nthere's somebody sitting right next to me,\n\n440\n00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:39.850\nand we're connected wirelessly,\nright now, simultaneously.\n\n441\n00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:43.220\nWell, it feels like you are because\nyou're actually changing up.\n\n442\n00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:45.810\nYou're actually kind of getting\nin line behind each other\n\n443\n00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:48.810\nas data is actually coming through and\ncoming back to you.\n\n444\n00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:52.540\nBut you really are accessing\nthat one antenna at one time.\n\n445\n00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:56.800\nSo when you're limited that, that's\nin theory what you have right there.\n\n446\n00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:01.350\nIf you get ten people on this, you're\ndividing that bandwidth up again, and\n\n447\n00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:05.010\neach person's only getting a little\nbit of a portion of that as well.\n\n448\n00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:06.445\nSo if you're the only one using wireless,\n\n449\n00:23:06.445 --> 00:23:10.717\nyeah, you will get 54 megabits in that\nsingle connection, sending or receiving.\n\n450\n00:23:10.717 --> 00:23:14.790\nGet two, well, you divide it in half\nyou get three, you divide by three,\n\n451\n00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:18.530\nyou keep going down, and all of\na sudden once you get to ten people,\n\n452\n00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:21.860\nthat becomes a lot slower on\nthat wireless connection.\n\n453\n00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:24.790\nNow, you might be taking a look at\nhow in the world can they get as\n\n454\n00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:25.960\nfast as they're getting?\n\n455\n00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:29.240\nIt's because they're playing\na kind of unusual trick here.\n\n456\n00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:33.140\nAnd the unusual trick is that you're\nnot really getting 600 sending and\n\n457\n00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.210\n600 receiving coming back.\n\n458\n00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:38.064\nThere's actually four different\nantennas in there, and\n\n459\n00:23:38.064 --> 00:23:40.987\neach of them will actually\nsend about 150 each, right?\n\n460\n00:23:40.987 --> 00:23:45.764\nSo you have two antennas\nthat are gonna be sending\n\n461\n00:23:45.764 --> 00:23:49.630\nat the a level at that 5 GHz frequency.\n\n462\n00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:53.486\nYou have another two that are also\nsending at the 2.4 GHz frequency.\n\n463\n00:23:53.486 --> 00:23:58.598\nAnd all four of those are actually\nsending at 150, or receiving at 150,\n\n464\n00:23:58.598 --> 00:24:04.030\ngiving you a combined total bandwidth\nof 600 megabits is what you see.\n\n465\n00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:05.670\nNow, notice the ranges as well.\n\n466\n00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:09.490\nThe ranges can change depending on whether\nyou're talking about indoor or outdoor,\n\n467\n00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:13.270\nand so that's why you actually see\nthe idea of indoor and outdoor here.\n\n468\n00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:17.900\nOn these last, on G and N,\nyou see that the difference is really\n\n469\n00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:22.710\nnegligible depending on where you are and\nstanding as well.\n\n470\n00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:26.660\nAnd really, what we want to also\nfocus in on is the frequency.\n\n471\n00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:30.230\nThe G operates at the five\ngigahertz frequency and\n\n472\n00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:32.960\nnotice that on the end it\nactually operates at both,\n\n473\n00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:37.000\nbecause we are actually getting two and\nactually four different antennas right?\n\n474\n00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.780\nSo that's what makes N a lot\nfaster when you start to use this.\n\n475\n00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:44.950\nSo those are some of\nthe technologies when you see it.\n\n476\n00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:49.140\nSo if you go out and\nyou purchase a wireless access point so\n\n477\n00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:51.460\nthat people can gain access in right?\n\n478\n00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:53.670\nUsually that's what you do,\nis you buy one of those,\n\n479\n00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:57.110\nyou connect it to your internet connection\nand then everybody on your network,\n\n480\n00:24:57.110 --> 00:25:01.450\nof course, now can actually connect\nwirelessly and you are ready to go.\n\n481\n00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:04.690\nThere are other types of wireless\nconnections that are out there like wi-fi\n\n482\n00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:08.650\nhot spots that you might get from your\ncellular company that allow you to connect\n\n483\n00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:12.320\nwireless devices wirelessly so that they\ncan get out to the Internet as well.\n\n484\n00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:16.880\nSo those are different options that you\nhave when you start dealing with wireless\n\n485\n00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.178\nnetworks to be able to get connected.\n\n486\n00:25:19.178 --> 00:25:21.430\nThe problem that we also\nhave with wireless though,\n\n487\n00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:26.270\nis copper has susceptibility to\nelectromagnetic interference.\n\n488\n00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:29.370\nWell guess what,\nif we don't have any cables at all and\n\n489\n00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:33.510\nwe've got electricity now trying to pump\na signal out there, well that also means\n\n490\n00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:37.680\nthat other signals operating at these\nfrequencies have a chance, also,\n\n491\n00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.510\nof interfering with our\nwireless connections too.\n\n492\n00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:45.850\nAnd this is one of the most disappointing\naspects of using a wireless technology.\n\n493\n00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:49.980\nThey work fine, but the more wireless\nsignals that are interfering with\n\n494\n00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:53.710\nyour signal,\nthe worse your connection is going to get.\n\n495\n00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:56.800\nAnd so even though you might go,\noh no I love my wireless, and we all do,\n\n496\n00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:00.740\nwe love it around here cuz we don't have\nto stay tethered to one location, but\n\n497\n00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.680\nas more and more people get connected\nwe'll get drops a little more,\n\n498\n00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.280\nor our connection will slow down to the\npoint where we're going, I just need to\n\n499\n00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:12.200\nplug in and I'll be fine is what ends up\nhappening when you start taking a look.\n\n500\n00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.650\nSo what are some of the other things\nthat you have to worry about, then?\n\n501\n00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:15.990\nWell, with the cable,\n\n502\n00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:21.130\nright, the cable I know that data will\ntravel from this end to this end.\n\n503\n00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:24.760\nSo as long as nobody is\nin between that end and\n\n504\n00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:28.280\nthis end on this cable,\nregardless of how long it is,\n\n505\n00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:33.230\nI don't have to worry about anybody being\nable to pull the data off of this wire.\n\n506\n00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:38.190\nBut, Daniel, my wireless signal,\nI can't direct it like a arrow, right?\n\n507\n00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:39.300\nIt just goes where it wants to.\n\n508\n00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:40.560\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n509\n00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:43.880\nLike Ronnie said about the wire,\nwe tend to call it bounded media.\n\n510\n00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:46.480\nWell it's also like\na bounded signal as well.\n\n511\n00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.110\nThe signal is on that pipe.\n\n512\n00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:51.830\nI would have to actually go in there and\ncut around the shielding,\n\n513\n00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:55.400\ncut into the wires itself,\nthen clip into it and\n\n514\n00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.900\nrun a dongle out to my computer\nto intercept that, or,\n\n515\n00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:03.100\nwhich is very obviously a long\nprocess to do, or I'd have to\n\n516\n00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:07.400\nsomehow get access to the network that\nit's on and try to intercept it that way.\n\n517\n00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:12.070\nWhereas a wireless network,\nwhat's happening with that signal?\n\n518\n00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:14.500\nIt's going out through the airwaves,\nright.\n\n519\n00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.100\nIt's radio frequencies hitting the air.\n\n520\n00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:20.090\nIf I have the right equipment and\nI have the right know-how,\n\n521\n00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:24.740\nI can intercept that traffic and\nsee it on my computer, see what it is.\n\n522\n00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:29.300\nIf it's Ronnie's bank statement and\nall his accounts well, goody for me.\n\n523\n00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:30.750\nEspecially if I'm a bad guy.\n\n524\n00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:33.880\nSo we need to employ some\nsecurity to these things so\n\n525\n00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:38.330\nthat they are hopefully as safe\nas our wire bounded media is.\n\n526\n00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:40.490\n>> Right, so when you take a look\nat a wireless access point,\n\n527\n00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:44.150\nremember that this is kind of something\nthat it would normally look like, right?\n\n528\n00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:47.210\nAll the connections are really going\nthrough these two antennas, and\n\n529\n00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:48.200\nwe are ready to go.\n\n530\n00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:51.680\nAnd the problem that we have is that we\ncan't control the nature of where that\n\n531\n00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.580\nsignal goes.\n\n532\n00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:54.300\nIt will spread where it wants to.\n\n533\n00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:58.340\nSo the way that we control that, instead,\nis by using things like encryption.\n\n534\n00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:01.530\nSo when we start talking about that,\nwe can actually go onto the devices and\n\n535\n00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:05.010\nbe able to actually make some\nencryption happen on them as well.\n\n536\n00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:07.380\nSo let me show you my\nscreen again briefly,\n\n537\n00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:09.110\nif I can get to what I want to do.\n\n538\n00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:12.980\nThere we go, let me get that off\nthe screen just for a moment.\n\n539\n00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:15.530\nHere it is.\nI've got a simulator of the actual\n\n540\n00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:17.910\nweb interface for that access point.\n\n541\n00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:22.390\nNow, on this simulator we can take a look,\nif you actually get access in that\n\n542\n00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:25.860\nwireless access point,\nall you have to do is go to wireless, and\n\n543\n00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:30.570\nthen select wireless security, and\ninside of here it's actually disabled, but\n\n544\n00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:34.090\nnotice I have the ability to choose\nfrom different security modes.\n\n545\n00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:37.560\nSo what we want to actually do is\nunderstand that there are multiple layers\n\n546\n00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:38.680\nof security.\n\n547\n00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:42.240\nWEP is the weakest security that you\ncan choose, so if you want to do this,\n\n548\n00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:46.600\nyou're actually saying hey, I secured it\nbecause I chose some security mechanism,\n\n549\n00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.410\nbut this is the one that's broken a lot.\n\n550\n00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:51.340\nSo they don't recommend that you use\nthis if you know that you have any\n\n551\n00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:53.200\ndata that's gonna be sensitive.\n\n552\n00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:58.510\nYou also have access to what we call\nWPA and WPA2 Enterprise and Personal.\n\n553\n00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:02.810\nWPA was designed to really replace WEP.\n\n554\n00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:06.170\nWhereas that first one, it used what\nwe call a static encryption key.\n\n555\n00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:09.850\nIn other words, you can send one packet,\nyou can send ten million packets.\n\n556\n00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:11.620\nThe encryption would be the same so\n\n557\n00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:14.450\na smart hacker like Daniel would\nactually be able to pull, let's say,\n\n558\n00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:17.910\ntwo to three hundred thousand packets, be\nable to figure out what my encryption key\n\n559\n00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:21.810\nis, and continue to get the rest\nof my data all day long.\n\n560\n00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:23.480\nBut if you use WPA, it says, look,\n\n561\n00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.840\nwe're gonna change the encryption\nkey every so often.\n\n562\n00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:29.310\nSo, Daniel, good luck on actually\nbeing able to break my encryption key\n\n563\n00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:30.560\nbefore I change it.\n\n564\n00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.700\nSo now all of a sudden, I've changed\nmy encryption key, Daniel goes, eureka!\n\n565\n00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:35.120\nI broke that encryption key.\n\n566\n00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.520\nOh, he's no longer using it.\n\n567\n00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.300\nSo it really did help to a point.\n\n568\n00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:43.480\nBut in the background, the encryption\nwas still using a form of WEP,\n\n569\n00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:49.000\nso it was still a little bit less than\nwhat is was supposed to be, stellar wise.\n\n570\n00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.510\nNow the other one of course is WPA2.\n\n571\n00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:57.290\nWPA2 offers for us, right now, the\nstrongest level of encryption that we can\n\n572\n00:29:57.290 --> 00:30:02.510\nactually use, one called AES, the advanced\nencryption standard, and this is\n\n573\n00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:06.290\nthe one that the federal government uses\nas the basis of everything that they do.\n\n574\n00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:10.570\nAnd so its a very strong,\nactual foundational level encryption, so\n\n575\n00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:12.410\nit's not one that's kind\nof pieced together and\n\n576\n00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:15.410\nalmost one that,\nthat's better than nothing.\n\n577\n00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:16.650\nIt's not one of those.\n\n578\n00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:20.470\nSo this is what we have and\nthat's what you want to use.\n\n579\n00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:23.210\nNow if you get confused by anything,\nit's like me the first time I look at it,\n\n580\n00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:26.140\nwhat the heck is Personal and Enterprise.\n\n581\n00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:28.240\nWell personal means you're\ngonna use a pre-shared key.\n\n582\n00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:31.250\nNow if you're not sure what that means,\nit means if I set that up and\n\n583\n00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:33.580\nthat's going to be my\nencryption key on personal.\n\n584\n00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:36.280\nWhat that means is I am actually\ngoing to share this key.\n\n585\n00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:40.810\nSo if I type in whatever the encryption\nkey is here, ITPro TV, and then I go,\n\n586\n00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:43.000\nDaniel, you need to connect me,\nI need to connect to wireless.\n\n587\n00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.560\nI have to tell him what that key is.\n\n588\n00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:48.670\nThat's what that personal means,\nregardless of which level you choose.\n\n589\n00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:53.160\nIf you choose the Enterprise though,\nnotice it doesn't actually give, actually,\n\n590\n00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.130\nthis one does.\n\n591\n00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:55.850\nLet me choose WPA2 Enterprise.\n\n592\n00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:57.950\nOh, actually that does\nhave a shared key as well.\n\n593\n00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:01.540\nSo, normally you don't actually have\na shared key with the WPA2 Enterprise.\n\n594\n00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:03.990\nYou normally have to use\nan authentication somewhere else.\n\n595\n00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:07.790\nSo you can have an encryption key\nwhere you do have the key, but\n\n596\n00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:12.080\nthen there's also that second layer\nof authentication as well., and\n\n597\n00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:15.850\nWPA offers both of those,\nwhether your WPA or WPA2.\n\n598\n00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:20.090\nSo you not only have encryption, you also\nhave authentication which requires you to\n\n599\n00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:23.790\nverify who you are, and\nthat's what makes these things stronger.\n\n600\n00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:27.422\nSo we don't wanna just allow us to\nconnect to a wireless network without any\n\n601\n00:31:27.422 --> 00:31:28.808\nencryption at all.\n\n602\n00:31:28.808 --> 00:31:31.200\nYou want to at least have something there,\nand so,\n\n603\n00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:34.030\nyou can choose what level that you want,\nnormally the stronger,\n\n604\n00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:36.020\nthe better is really what\nreally the key comes out to be.\n\n605\n00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:40.210\n>> Yeah, that's just a good adage for\nany aspects of your life.\n\n606\n00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:41.070\nThe stronger, the better.\n\n607\n00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:43.000\nIf you can afford\nthe more expensive thing,\n\n608\n00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.210\nbuy that,\ncuz it's usually the better item.\n\n609\n00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:48.080\nWhen it comes to encryption,\nsame concept applies.\n\n610\n00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:51.560\nThe better, stronger, faster thing that\nyou got, if you have that ability to\n\n611\n00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:55.180\nrun that, that's what you should\nbe running in your network.\n\n612\n00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:55.790\nAll right, Ronnie.\n\n613\n00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:57.920\nWe've covered quite a bit of topics today.\n\n614\n00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:02.032\nWe've covered, let's see here,\nwired, we've covered fiber optic,\n\n615\n00:32:02.032 --> 00:32:05.760\ncopper cabling, jacks, you name it,\nwireless and encryption.\n\n616\n00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.660\nIs there anything else we need these good\npeople to know before we let them go?\n\n617\n00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:09.430\n>> Absolutely.\n\n618\n00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:10.380\nThis is not the end.\n\n619\n00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:11.338\nThat's the problem, right?\n\n620\n00:32:11.338 --> 00:32:16.200\nSo you are just scratching the surface,\nonce again, of some of the in-depth\n\n621\n00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:20.400\nknowledge that has to be done, because\nit's all about the context that you're in.\n\n622\n00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.040\nWhich one would you choose\nto use at one time?\n\n623\n00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.380\nYou can run fiber optics all\nday long if you want to,\n\n624\n00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:29.160\nif you're willing to pay the price for\nit, but you might find out it's so\n\n625\n00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.160\nfragile you don't wanna run\nit in your environment.\n\n626\n00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.400\nSo now you have all this\nexpensive equipment and\n\n627\n00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.980\nyou're now running something that\nyou really can't afford to run.\n\n628\n00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:38.250\nSo you wanna actually\nknow more about this, and\n\n629\n00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:43.400\nthis is where we do have other shows\nin the ITProTV's course library\n\n630\n00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.950\nthat you wanna make sure\nthat you do follow up on.\n\n631\n00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:49.510\nCuz you'll find out that we really\ndidn't touch a lot of it and\n\n632\n00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:50.810\nit's just a good start.\n\n633\n00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:51.570\n>> That's right.\n\n634\n00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:54.100\nAll right everyone,\nhopefully it is a good start for you.\n\n635\n00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:56.840\nIf you've never seen anything like this\nbefore, heard of any of any of these\n\n636\n00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:00.890\ncabling specifications, it's all kind of a\nmyth to you, hopefully now you're kind of\n\n637\n00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:05.840\nlike okay, I understand a little bit more\non how cables work in a wired network,\n\n638\n00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:09.378\nhow wireless works, that's always helpful,\nand you're off to the races there.\n\n639\n00:33:09.378 --> 00:33:12.960\nStart studying, figure this stuff out,\npass that exam, that's our hope for you.\n\n640\n00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.850\nThanks, Ronnie, for joining us today and\nall those great demonstrations.\n\n641\n00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:17.770\nThey are well appreciated.\n\n642\n00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:20.530\nAs far as this show goes, I think\nwe're going to go ahead and sign off.\n\n643\n00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:22.900\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n644\n00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:23.570\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n645\n00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:24.863\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n646\n00:33:24.863 -->

great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.235\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrey, joining me in\nthe studio today is none other than Mr.\n\n5\n00:00:19.235 --> 00:00:19.870\nDon Pezet.\n\n6\n00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.090\nHow's it going today Don?\n\n7\n00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.038\n>> It is going great Daniel,\nthanks for having me on the show.\n\n8\n00:00:23.038 --> 00:00:26.411\nAnd I'm kind of excited to jump in here,\nbecause this is the MTA for\n\n9\n00:00:26.411 --> 00:00:27.979\nNetwork Infrastructure, and\n\n10\n00:00:27.979 --> 00:00:31.730\nyou guys know networking is one of my\nkind of favorite topics to jump into.\n\n11\n00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.250\nAnd it's always neat to get in here and\ntalk about some of the basics and\n\n12\n00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.070\nfundamentals that are so\nimportant to understand.\n\n13\n00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.560\nBecause everything else we learn\nkind of builds on top of these.\n\n14\n00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.030\nWe got a good show lined up covering\nlots of networking stuff, it's exciting.\n\n15\n00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.150\n>> Yeah without these networking\nfundamentals you're not gonna get very far\n\n16\n00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.410\nin your networking career.\n\n17\n00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.120\nSo you're gonna see these a lot,\n\n18\n00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.280\neven as you become ingrained\nas a network administrator.\n\n19\n00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.710\nThese are foundational knowledge\nthat you're gonna rely upon over and\n\n20\n00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.300\nover and over again.\n\n21\n00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.290\nSo it's great that Microsoft\ncalls these out on their exam.\n\n22\n00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.390\nThey wanna make sure that you\nknow that kind of stuff and\n\n23\n00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.530\nDon you're gonna help us out today.\n\n24\n00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.780\nYou're gonna kind of take us through some\nof the infrastructure that is built in\n\n25\n00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.390\nto networks.\n\n26\n00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.810\nCorrect?\n>> Absolutely.\n\n27\n00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.280\nNow, when we're dealing with networks,\n\n28\n00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.470\nthere's several different\ntypes of networks out there.\n\n29\n00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.450\nThere's a lot of terminology and\nthings that we need to be aware of.\n\n30\n00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.190\nSo lets start really high level.\n\n31\n00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.970\nWhen I say a network,\nwhat the heck am I talking about?\n\n32\n00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.620\nWell, there's actually,\nI'm gonna say four.\n\n33\n00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.510\nThere's four different types of networks.\n\n34\n00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.700\nThere's actually any number of\nnetworks that are out there, but\n\n35\n00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.100\naccording to Microsoft, there\nare four that we need to be aware of.\n\n36\n00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.930\nI guess that's a better way to look at it.\n\n37\n00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.970\nThe first network type that\nthey're talking about is\n\n38\n00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.260\nwhat's called the Internet.\n\n39\n00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.830\nThe Internet is really important, and you\nguys know that because if you're watching\n\n40\n00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.420\nthis video right now, the odds are that\nyou're watching it via the Internet.\n\n41\n00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.395\n>> We like the internet here.\n\n42\n00:01:46.395 --> 00:01:49.290\n[LAUGH]\n>> If the Internet didn't exist, we would,\n\n43\n00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.290\nwell, we'd either be out of business or\nwe'd be mailing DVDs to people, I guess.\n\n44\n00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.420\nI don't know, something.\n\n45\n00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.870\nBut the Internet is the world's\nlargest network, right?\n\n46\n00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.290\nIt connects computers and\nservers all over the planet to each other.\n\n47\n00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.961\nThere is no network\nlarger than the Internet.\n\n48\n00:02:05.961 --> 00:02:08.911\nSo when a lot of people say,\nhey the network is down,\n\n49\n00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:11.730\nthey might be talking about\ntheir own network, or\n\n50\n00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.041\nthey might be talking about this world\nwide network, which is rarely down.\n\n51\n00:02:16.041 --> 00:02:19.382\nSo that is one example of a network,\nInternet.\n\n52\n00:02:19.382 --> 00:02:24.430\nBut there's some similar terms that go\nalong with that, right, like an intranet.\n\n53\n00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.900\nWell, what's an intranet?\n\n54\n00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.025\nWe've got Internet.\n\n55\n00:02:28.025 --> 00:02:32.560\nWell, internet, if you break that term\napart right, inter, which comes from,\n\n56\n00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.290\nI'll pretend to be smarter, the latin root\nof, it'd be like the ESPN spelling bee,\n\n57\n00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.968\nand [LAUGH].\n\n58\n00:02:37.968 --> 00:02:41.775\nSo it means to go in between things,\nright, but\n\n59\n00:02:41.775 --> 00:02:44.930\nintra means to stay within something.\n\n60\n00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.590\nSo an intranet is a network\nwithin your own organization.\n\n61\n00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.820\nAnd so there's many companies that\nmaintain their own network and\n\n62\n00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.810\nhave their own web servers that\nare just for their own employees.\n\n63\n00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.645\nWell Daniel you know, you and\nI, we used to work for\n\n64\n00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:00.210\nan insurance company years ago.\n\n65\n00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.960\nAnd we had an intranet\nthere that employees,\n\n66\n00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.590\nwhen you came into work in the morning,\nthat was the first place you went,\n\n67\n00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.220\ncuz company news, information,\nit was all there.\n\n68\n00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.569\nYou could not access\nthat from the Internet.\n\n69\n00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.996\n>> Now there were great forums and\napplications that people with inside of\n\n70\n00:03:14.996 --> 00:03:18.782\nour business needed to access, and\nwe didn't want that to be public, right.\n\n71\n00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:23.074\nThat's not something that Joe on the\nstreet needs to be diving into some sort\n\n72\n00:03:23.074 --> 00:03:25.100\nof accounting information.\n\n73\n00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.200\nWe keep that internal, but they can\naccess it through their browser, and\n\n74\n00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.570\na lot of cool stuff like that.\n\n75\n00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.160\nThat was our intranet.\n\n76\n00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.975\nIt was internal to only our business,\nand it works really well.\n\n77\n00:03:34.975 --> 00:03:35.860\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, and\n\n78\n00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.600\nyou'll hear another name used for\nthat from time to time or\n\n79\n00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.580\neven more often now, which is just a LAN,\na local area network.\n\n80\n00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.340\nA local area network is a network\nthat's well, local to you.\n\n81\n00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.540\n>> In your area.\n\n82\n00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.350\n>> Yeah,\nyou have the word in its own definition.\n\n83\n00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.940\nBasically another way to look at\nit is the network that you own.\n\n84\n00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.450\nIf you have more than one computer in\nyour network, like Daniel has a laptop.\n\n85\n00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.330\nI've got a laptop and\nwe need them to talk.\n\n86\n00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.570\nWell, we have wireless access points,\nand switches,\n\n87\n00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.970\nand network cables that we bought, that\nour company owns that's private to us.\n\n88\n00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.930\nThat's our local area network.\n\n89\n00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.380\nYou could also call that our intranet,\nbecause it's services and\n\n90\n00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.340\nresources that are, again,\non our network that we control,\n\n91\n00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.150\nthat are private,\nif we choose for them to be.\n\n92\n00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.960\nBut we access the Internet, which is\nthat public network that's out there.\n\n93\n00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.520\nSo, a intranet is often gonna be on\nyour LAN, your local area network.\n\n94\n00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.710\nThe Internet is considered a WAN or\nwide area network.\n\n95\n00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.250\nSo this is where things\nstart to get confusing,\n\n96\n00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.380\ncuz you have these kind of\ninterchangeable terms, right.\n\n97\n00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.420\nBut if you're gonna bring\nup a web server and\n\n98\n00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.000\nmake it available to\nthe world on the Internet.\n\n99\n00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.640\nWell, that's an Internet server, right?\n\n100\n00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.361\nIt's public.\n\n101\n00:04:44.361 --> 00:04:46.296\nBut if you want it to be just private for\n\n102\n00:04:46.296 --> 00:04:50.239\nyour own people it's gonna be on your\nLAN and that's your intranet, right?\n\n103\n00:04:50.239 --> 00:04:52.030\nIt's within your network.\n\n104\n00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.350\nSo those are a couple different terms.\n\n105\n00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.820\nAnd then there's one more that\nMicrosoft calls out, which is extranet.\n\n106\n00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.350\nAn extranet is one of those slightly\nannoying terms because it's a hybrid.\n\n107\n00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.150\nIt's kind of in between Internet and\nintranet, right?\n\n108\n00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.440\nAnd you see these a lot.\n\n109\n00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.550\nLet me give you an example.\n\n110\n00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.830\nYou know, really, your bank.\n\n111\n00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.190\nWhen you do online banking you\ngo to your bank's website and\n\n112\n00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.290\nask you for your username and password, or\ndual factor, multi-factor authentication,\n\n113\n00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.520\nwhatever it is to get into their website.\n\n114\n00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.590\nAnd once you're in,\nyou're accessing resources.\n\n115\n00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.141\nNow these are resources that you access\nvia the Internet, but they're private.\n\n116\n00:05:31.141 --> 00:05:32.047\nNot just anybody can go,\nI can't go to the website and\n\n117\n00:05:32.047 --> 00:05:32.686\nview your account balance, right.\n\n118\n00:05:32.686 --> 00:05:36.493\nMaybe you can.\n\n119\n00:05:36.493 --> 00:05:39.720\n[LAUGH]\n>> There are some people who [CROSSTALK]\n\n120\n00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.313\non that.\n\n121\n00:05:40.313 --> 00:05:44.820\nThe average person, the non law\nbreaker cannot access that resource.\n\n122\n00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:50.425\nSo it's public, and yet it's private at\nthe same, and businesses do this a lot.\n\n123\n00:05:50.425 --> 00:05:54.045\nThey make resources available to other\nbusiness partners all right, and\n\n124\n00:05:54.045 --> 00:05:56.365\nthat's called an extranet.\n\n125\n00:05:56.365 --> 00:06:01.265\nSo an extranet kind of bridges the gap\nin between an Internet and an intranet.\n\n126\n00:06:01.265 --> 00:06:03.245\nNot every company has an extranet,\n\n127\n00:06:03.245 --> 00:06:07.185\nnot everybody needs one, but\nplenty of places do and make use of it.\n\n128\n00:06:07.185 --> 00:06:11.690\nSo if it's a private site,\nor private resource\n\n129\n00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.340\nthat just happens to be available via\nthe Internet, that becomes an extranet.\n\n130\n00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.020\nRight, bridging that gap.\n\n131\n00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.600\nSo, Internet is public.\n\n132\n00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.180\nIntranet is private.\n\n133\n00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.912\nExtranet is kind of in between.\n\n134\n00:06:25.912 --> 00:06:27.375\nAnd then, you've got your WAN and\nyour LAN.\n\n135\n00:06:27.375 --> 00:06:31.508\nYour wide area network, which is usually\nInternet and your local area network,\n\n136\n00:06:31.508 --> 00:06:34.070\nwhich is your internal,\nyour private network.\n\n137\n00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.620\nNow, I say the WAN, the wide area network,\nis usually private.\n\n138\n00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.970\nIt doesn't have to be.\n\n139\n00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.220\nReally large organizations,\n\n140\n00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.810\nthey might choose to purchase\nconnections between their locations.\n\n141\n00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:48.400\nSo, for example, if you're a bank,\nand you've got bank branches all over,\n\n142\n00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.940\nyou could use the Internet to\nconnect your branches together, but\n\n143\n00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.260\nthe internet's not really trustworthy,\nis it?\n\n144\n00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.020\nSo you might call up an internet\nservice provider, or AT&T, or\n\n145\n00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:02.640\nsomebody like that, and get private\nlines run between your branches.\n\n146\n00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.500\nAnd when you do that\nthey're not your lines.\n\n147\n00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.440\nYou don't own them.\n\n148\n00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.000\nSo it's not technically a LAN anymore,\nright?\n\n149\n00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.910\nIt's a WAN, it's a world wide, a network\nthat spans between your locations.\n\n150\n00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.230\nYou rent that, or\nyou lease it from the phone company, and\n\n151\n00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:19.650\nin those scenarios, what you're doing is,\nyou're creating a private WAN,\n\n152\n00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.710\na wide area network that's just for\nyour business.\n\n153\n00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.830\nIt kinda starts to blur the lines there,\n\n154\n00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.910\nso that's why it's important\nthat we talk about it here.\n\n155\n00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:31.450\nThat's why Microsoft wants us to hit on\nthat, to make sure that everybody's got\n\n156\n00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:35.459\na good understanding of the difference\nbetween Internet, intranet,\n\n157\n00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:36.884\nextranet, WAN and LAN.\n\n158\n00:07:36.884 --> 00:07:39.079\nThose five terms right there,\npretty important.\n\n159\n00:07:39.079 --> 00:07:41.291\n>> Now, Don, that WAN business, you know,\n\n160\n00:07:41.291 --> 00:07:45.117\nhaving those leased lines that\nare private dedicated to me sounds great.\n\n161\n00:07:45.117 --> 00:07:48.096\nIt also sounds like it\nmight be very expensive.\n\n162\n00:07:48.096 --> 00:07:49.257\n>> It certainly is right?\n\n163\n00:07:49.257 --> 00:07:52.218\nSo, when it comes to getting connectivity.\n\n164\n00:07:52.218 --> 00:07:54.542\nAnd we're gonna talk about these in\nanother episode a little bit later.\n\n165\n00:07:54.542 --> 00:07:58.279\nIf you're at home and you wanna\nget Internet access for your home,\n\n166\n00:07:58.279 --> 00:08:03.650\nyou can get things like cable, and DSL,\nhigh speed, broadband, you can get those.\n\n167\n00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.584\nAnd it's 50, 60 bucks a month.\n\n168\n00:08:05.584 --> 00:08:06.668\nIt's not terribly expensive.\n\n169\n00:08:06.668 --> 00:08:09.580\nFor those of you that are in Europe,\nyou have it even better than us.\n\n170\n00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.410\nIt'll be 20 euros a month.\n\n171\n00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:12.840\nIt's a lot less expensive.\n\n172\n00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.580\nBut even in either continent,\n\n173\n00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:20.740\nif you wanna step up to one of these\ndedicated lines, these lease lines,\n\n174\n00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:24.840\nthey're usually hundreds,\neven thousands of dollars per month.\n\n175\n00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.510\nThey're not inexpensive.\n\n176\n00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.240\n>> That's a little out of my price range,\nDon.\n\n177\n00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.560\n>> But then they're very reliable,\nvery stable,\n\n178\n00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.840\nyou can get a lot of bandwidth on them,\nthere's a lot of benefits.\n\n179\n00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.460\nAnd they're really designed for\nbusinesses, not designed for home users,\n\n180\n00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:39.130\nbecause you don't need that\nlevel of connectivity at home.\n\n181\n00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:42.000\nSo, those are some of the different\ntypes of networks that are out there.\n\n182\n00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.340\nNow, one of the things I mentioned\nwas that we could use the Internet\n\n183\n00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.930\nto connect our offices instead\nof doing a lease line, right?\n\n184\n00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:54.060\nDaniel said lease lines are super mega\nexpensive, so I'm not gonna use that for\n\n185\n00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:54.740\nmy home.\n\n186\n00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.420\nBut for a business I might.\n\n187\n00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.240\nBut, what if I have a small business?\n\n188\n00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.880\nAnd I'm not sitting on a ton of cash.\n\n189\n00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.130\nAnd so, I wanna use the Internet,\nbut I want to use it safely.\n\n190\n00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:06.272\nThat's where we have\nthings like VPNs come in.\n\n191\n00:09:06.272 --> 00:09:09.437\nA VPN is a virtual private network.\n\n192\n00:09:09.437 --> 00:09:14.295\nAnd what a virtual private network does,\nis instead of just taking your data and\n\n193\n00:09:14.295 --> 00:09:19.009\nsending it out there to the Internet,\nit takes your data and it encrypts it and\n\n194\n00:09:19.009 --> 00:09:21.560\nit sends it across the Internet.\n\n195\n00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.790\nAnd that way, if somebody were\nto intercept it in transit,\n\n196\n00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:24.510\nwhat are they gonna see?\n\n197\n00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:28.870\nThey're gonna see encrypted data,\nit's just garbled mess and that's it.\n\n198\n00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:34.200\nBut, when it reaches the other end\nof that tunnel, wherever it's going,\n\n199\n00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.070\nthe data gets decrypted and\nyou access that resource just fine.\n\n200\n00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:42.310\nVirtual private networks are something\nthat we can lay on top of the Internet\n\n201\n00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:46.310\nto turn it into an intranet or\na private LAN.\n\n202\n00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:49.360\nWe can start to get those advantages\nwithout having to go out and\n\n203\n00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.330\nlease a line from the phone company.\n\n204\n00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.660\nSo, you're starting to see less and\nless of that.\n\n205\n00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.510\nLess and less of people going and\nleasing lines, and\n\n206\n00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:01.430\ninstead they're just using broadband,\nDSL, internet connections that\n\n207\n00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:05.680\ndump them right into the public Internet,\nbecause they can use VPNs to secure it.\n\n208\n00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:10.440\nNow, if you've never used a VPN before,\nlet me give you a quick demonstration so\n\n209\n00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.800\nyou kinda see what that's like, all right?\n\n210\n00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.490\nSo, I've got a machine set up here and\nif I just fire up a web browser,\n\n211\n00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:22.380\nI have a little webpage that is just\na quick kinda test page that I can use.\n\n212\n00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:23.303\nAll right.\nAnd so\n\n213\n00:10:23.303 --> 00:10:28.437\nI'm browsing here to\nitpro.tv/test/index.html.\n\n214\n00:10:28.437 --> 00:10:31.450\nAnd when I go to that website,\nI'm just getting a test page, right?\n\n215\n00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:34.710\nSo it says test page,\nthis is a test page created by Don Pezet.\n\n216\n00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:37.200\nWell when I did that,\nI browsed out to the Internet, right?\n\n217\n00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.997\nThis server is out there on the Internet,\nand\n\n218\n00:10:39.997 --> 00:10:43.979\nI browsed to it and my data was\nsent unencrypted on the Internet.\n\n219\n00:10:43.979 --> 00:10:48.175\nIf there's an attacker out there on\nthe Internet, they can intercept this, and\n\n220\n00:10:48.175 --> 00:10:51.520\nthey'll be able to read it because\nit's in plain text, right?\n\n221\n00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.062\nThere's no protection on this.\n\n222\n00:10:54.062 --> 00:10:58.100\nIf I had a leased line, that went from my\nbuilding directly to wherever this web\n\n223\n00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.852\nserver is,\nthen I'd be the only person on that line,\n\n224\n00:11:00.852 --> 00:11:05.030\nnobody would be able to intercept\nthat traffic, it would be safe.\n\n225\n00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:08.320\nAnd so if you want the best security,\na leased line will give it to you.\n\n226\n00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:12.320\nBut, I can use a VPN to secure this data,\nall right?\n\n227\n00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.940\nThere's other ways we could secure it too,\nright?\n\n228\n00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.150\nI can use SSL.\n\n229\n00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.634\nIf I browse to it with HTTPS,\n\n230\n00:11:17.634 --> 00:11:21.610\nthen SSL the secure socket layer will\nencrypt the data that will secure it.\n\n231\n00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:25.350\nIf you go to your banks website and\ngo to log in, it's gonna use SSL.\n\n232\n00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:29.080\nIf you go to Amazon to buy something,\nor most websites these days.\n\n233\n00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:33.410\nWhen you get to that login page,\nit's gonna be ssl to encrypt your data.\n\n234\n00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:37.104\nThe cool part about a VPN is that it can\nencrypt everything, not just your webpage.\n\n235\n00:11:37.104 --> 00:11:42.397\nSo, my email, my file transfers,\nany other stuff that I do on the network,\n\n236\n00:11:42.397 --> 00:11:45.479\nall being encrypted and\nsent over that VPN.\n\n237\n00:11:45.479 --> 00:11:51.235\nVPNs can also be useful if you want to\nchange where you appear to be from.\n\n238\n00:11:51.235 --> 00:11:53.120\nRight now, what do I mean by that?\n\n239\n00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.301\nWell, when I browse to the internet,\n\n240\n00:11:55.301 --> 00:11:58.313\nI'm browsing out to\nthe internet via an IP address.\n\n241\n00:11:58.313 --> 00:12:04.437\nAnd if I go to a website like here,\nI'll go to whatismyip.com, all right.\n\n242\n00:12:04.437 --> 00:12:08.378\nIf I go to that website,\nit's gonna basically see my connection and\n\n243\n00:12:08.378 --> 00:12:10.187\ntell me what IP address I have.\n\n244\n00:12:10.187 --> 00:12:10.729\nRight?\n\n245\n00:12:10.729 --> 00:12:14.937\nAnd so here I can see my IP,\n209.251.159.179.\n\n246\n00:12:14.937 --> 00:12:15.437\nAll right?\n\n247\n00:12:15.437 --> 00:12:17.385\nThat's actually the IP for\nour building here so\n\n248\n00:12:17.385 --> 00:12:20.090\nmost of our computers go\nout with that one address.\n\n249\n00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:22.130\nWell, what does that mean for me?\n\n250\n00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:23.400\nWell, it doesn't mean much, right?\n\n251\n00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.100\nWhat do I care what IP I have?\n\n252\n00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:30.910\nBut, someone else can look at this,\nand they can geolocate that IP.\n\n253\n00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:34.300\nIf I click on my IP information here,\nit's gonna tell me that\n\n254\n00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:39.720\nthis IP is tied to Gainesville,\nFL, ZIP code 32601, all right?\n\n255\n00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.680\nAnd that's pretty close, right?\n\n256\n00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:43.522\nWe are in Gainesville, Florida.\n\n257\n00:12:43.522 --> 00:12:45.312\nWe're in 32607.\n\n258\n00:12:45.312 --> 00:12:47.300\nA little bit off, but\nI mean that's close enough.\n\n259\n00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:48.470\nSo, they know where I'm coming from.\n\n260\n00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:50.220\nThey know I'm in the U.S.\n\n261\n00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:52.990\nMy internet service provider's listed\nas Ignition Entertainment which is not\n\n262\n00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:55.900\ncorrect, but\neverything else on here is pretty correct.\n\n263\n00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:59.090\nSo, now, this is information\npeople can learn from our IP.\n\n264\n00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:03.650\nWell, if we use a VPN tunnel,\nwe can mask our location by re-pinging\n\n265\n00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:07.450\nit somewhere else and so\nyou can see yourself as somewhere else.\n\n266\n00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.760\nI use this all the time\nbecause as a network admin,\n\n267\n00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.650\nthere's times you might need\nto troubleshoot your network.\n\n268\n00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:16.440\nAnd so lets say you've got some web\nservers and they're working fine for you.\n\n269\n00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.920\nAnd maybe you're here in the US, and then\nyou get a support ticket from somebody in\n\n270\n00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.890\nEngland or somebody in Singapore.\n\n271\n00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:24.920\nAnd they're saying, hey, I'm going to\nyour website and it's not working.\n\n272\n00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.390\nAnd you say well it works for me.\n\n273\n00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:28.240\nAnd that's that, right?\n\n274\n00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.370\nHow does that help?\n\n275\n00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:34.010\nWell, you could use a VPN\ntunnel to connect to a system\n\n276\n00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:38.300\nin Singapore and now you're browsing the\nInternet as if you were from Singapore.\n\n277\n00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.660\nAnd now you can test the website.\n\n278\n00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.560\nSo VPNs can be great for testing.\n\n279\n00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.530\nAnd I use that very, very frequently.\n\n280\n00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:44.130\nAll right.\n\n281\n00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:46.660\nSo, let me just give you some\nquick examples of how VPNs work.\n\n282\n00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.550\nLet's start with the encryption piece,\nright.\n\n283\n00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:51.310\nI said when I browse to this webpage,\nit's unencrypted.\n\n284\n00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:52.200\nHow do I know that.\n\n285\n00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:52.830\nAll right.\n\n286\n00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.840\nSo I'm gonna use a little\nprogram called Wireshark and\n\n287\n00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:58.050\nwhat Wireshark is is a packet sniffer and\nprotocol analyzer.\n\n288\n00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:00.120\nIt let's me record network traffic.\n\n289\n00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.900\nAnd when I launch this program, what it's\ngoing to let me do is record all this\n\n290\n00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.240\nstuff that's going on on\nmy network interface.\n\n291\n00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.170\nSo I'll be able to see that traffic\nas it passes over my nick and\n\n292\n00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:12.110\nwhether it's encrypted or\nunencrypted and all that.\n\n293\n00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:15.090\nSo, I'm just going to launch it and I'm\ngoing to attach it to my network adapter.\n\n294\n00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:16.680\nAnd I've got a couple of\nnetwork adapters here.\n\n295\n00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.400\nSo I wanna pick my ethernet adapter.\n\n296\n00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.700\nAnd I'll start that one recording.\n\n297\n00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.590\nAnd so it's gonna start\ncapturing that information.\n\n298\n00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:27.360\nNow, your computer actually generates\na lot of network messages on its own.\n\n299\n00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.050\nIt just kind of as it functions.\n\n300\n00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:31.560\nAnd so I'll apply a filter to\nthis one here in just a moment.\n\n301\n00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:32.730\nIt actually hasn't started just yet.\n\n302\n00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:33.960\nSo I have to wait a second.\n\n303\n00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:34.780\nThere it goes.\n\n304\n00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.550\nAnd so now it's starting kinda\ncapture that information,\n\n305\n00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.480\nyou'll see I've got\nDropbox Sync Discovery running, and\n\n306\n00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.970\nyou'll see other things start to appear\nin here as the network communicates.\n\n307\n00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:47.085\nSo, I'm gonna filter that down,\nand I'll just apply an filter.\n\n308\n00:14:47.085 --> 00:14:49.685\nI just want to see web traffic and\nthat's it.\n\n309\n00:14:49.685 --> 00:14:51.445\nI don't want to see anything else.\n\n310\n00:14:51.445 --> 00:14:53.675\nAnd I'm going to fire up\nmy web browser again and\n\n311\n00:14:53.675 --> 00:14:55.725\nI'm going to browse to that test site.\n\n312\n00:14:55.725 --> 00:14:56.895\nNow, when I go to the test site,\n\n313\n00:14:56.895 --> 00:15:01.085\nit's going to reach out to the server\nusing http which is unencrypted.\n\n314\n00:15:01.085 --> 00:15:05.360\nAnd, when it gets to that server,\nnow it's gonna connect to it,\n\n315\n00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.930\npull that data down, and\nmy recording should have a copy of that.\n\n316\n00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:12.450\nSo there's the test page that just came\nup, and if I jump back to wire shark,\n\n317\n00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:15.210\nthere I can see that I've got that\nconnection to it right there.\n\n318\n00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:19.450\nI did a GET request for /test/index.html.\n\n319\n00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:22.570\nAnd I can see that I got this\n304 not modified message, and\n\n320\n00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:25.040\nwhat that means is that I've\nviewed the page before, and\n\n321\n00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.000\nit hasn't actually changed\nsince the last time.\n\n322\n00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.550\nSo Internet Explorer could render a,\njust a copy of it as it was.\n\n323\n00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:36.030\nBut, if I'm an attacker and I'm looking at\nthis, I can see right there in the info,\n\n324\n00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:39.190\nor I can break open these packets and\nsee what happened, and\n\n325\n00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:41.920\nI can see right here that\nthey requested this webpage.\n\n326\n00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.580\nThat's where I was trying to get to.\n\n327\n00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:47.241\nAnd I can see the web browser I was using,\nthe operating system I was using,\n\n328\n00:15:47.241 --> 00:15:49.218\nall of that is embedded in this data, and\n\n329\n00:15:49.218 --> 00:15:53.084\nthat's why the internet is a somewhat\ndangerous place for unencrypted data.\n\n330\n00:15:53.084 --> 00:15:57.960\nIf we use a VPN tunnel the data is sent\nover the network encrypted, right?\n\n331\n00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.300\nAnd I've got a little VPN\nservice in the background here.\n\n332\n00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.669\nI'm just gonna turn it on real quick.\n\n333\n00:16:02.669 --> 00:16:06.384\nAnd when I connect to it, you'll see I've\ngot all of these different options where I\n\n334\n00:16:06.384 --> 00:16:07.860\ncan pick who I want to connect to.\n\n335\n00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:12.152\nNormally with a VPN service you just\nhave one destination that you pick, and\n\n336\n00:16:12.152 --> 00:16:13.370\nthat's it, right?\n\n337\n00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:16.050\nSo it's usually your office, or your home.\n\n338\n00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:17.470\nBut I use this for troubleshooting, so\n\n339\n00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:21.230\nI like to be able to connect to people\nall over the world to troubleshoot.\n\n340\n00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:24.620\nAnd so you'll see I've got ones here in\nthe U.S., like Miami and Chicago, but\n\n341\n00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:28.500\nI've also got Canada,\nI've got Prague, Stockholm, Sydney.\n\n342\n00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:32.210\nAnd these are just other countries that I\nmight wanna troubleshoot from the change\n\n343\n00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:34.440\nwhere I show up as.\n\n344\n00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.540\nSo, I'm gonna choose.\n\n345\n00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.800\nLet's go with, we'll do good old New York.\n\n346\n00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.280\nSo, I'm gonna reach out to New York here.\n\n347\n00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.840\nAnd that's gonna build up a connection and\nI have to give it a moment for\n\n348\n00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:43.960\nit to kick in.\n\n349\n00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.320\nBut as soon as that happens,\n\n350\n00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.520\nany data I send to the Internet\ndoesn't go directly to the Internet.\n\n351\n00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:52.790\nIt gets encrypted and sent over this\ntunnel to a server in New York.\n\n352\n00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:55.430\nAnd then I get thrown out on the Internet.\n\n353\n00:16:55.430 --> 00:17:00.280\nNow, if somebody is connected to\nthe network and intercepting my traffic,\n\n354\n00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.500\nwhat are they gonna see?\n\n355\n00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.250\nThey're gonna see the encrypted\ndata between me and New York.\n\n356\n00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:05.930\nNow past New York,\nI'm going out to the Internet.\n\n357\n00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:07.200\nIt's not safe anymore.\n\n358\n00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:11.800\nIf I was VPNing into my office, my access\nto the office would be encrypted and safe.\n\n359\n00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.870\nIf you're browsing out to the Internet,\nat some point,\n\n360\n00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:17.060\nyou have to get exposed to the Internet,\nand your data's not safe anymore.\n\n361\n00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:20.620\nBut now, you'll see my little packet\ncapture stopped because the VPN\n\n362\n00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:21.590\ntonal came up.\n\n363\n00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:24.290\nBut if I come in and\nI start that back up again, and\n\n364\n00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:27.010\nI connect to my ethernet adaptor and\nstart that one up.\n\n365\n00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:29.290\nSo we'll start another recording, right.\n\n366\n00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:32.340\nSo now it's recording,\nI've got that HGP filter on.\n\n367\n00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:35.370\nIf I fire up my web browser and I try and\n\n368\n00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:39.080\nbrowse to this page again,\nokay there it goes reaching out to it.\n\n369\n00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.460\nAnd when I get the page, there it is.\n\n370\n00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:42.630\nIt rendered the page.\n\n371\n00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:46.730\nAnd if I look at Wire Shark,\nit doesn't show up in there at all.\n\n372\n00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:50.050\nAnd the reason is I don't even\nsee the HDP traffic anymore.\n\n373\n00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:51.410\nNow, it's encrypted.\n\n374\n00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:54.150\nNow, I would need to look for VPN traffic.\n\n375\n00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:58.000\nAnd VPN traffic can use one of\nseveral different protocols.\n\n376\n00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.880\nThere's PPTP, which is\nthe Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol.\n\n377\n00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.870\nThere's L2TP,\nthe Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol.\n\n378\n00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:08.050\nThere's IPsec,\nwhich is Internet Protocol Security.\n\n379\n00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:11.980\nThere is SSTP,\nthe Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol.\n\n380\n00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.060\nThere's TLS, the Transport Layer Security.\n\n381\n00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:18.770\nAnd actually my VPN I think is actually\nusing TLS which it's not gonna let me\n\n382\n00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:19.760\nfilter by.\n\n383\n00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.670\nSo it could be using any\nof those other protocols.\n\n384\n00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:28.520\nAnd so if I clear out my filter there and\nstart looking, notice how I've got\n\n385\n00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:32.310\na bunch of entries here for communications\nand if I scroll through them,\n\n386\n00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:36.540\nI'm not gonna see web traffic in\nhere at all, it's all other stuff.\n\n387\n00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:40.470\nWe've got QUIC and mdns and\nother things that are happening here.\n\n388\n00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:43.170\nAnd these are my communications.\n\n389\n00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:45.180\nIn my case I'm using the QUIC protocol.\n\n390\n00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.540\nAnd so, we can see that right here,\n\n391\n00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:49.180\nmy encrypted data kind\nof being thrown around.\n\n392\n00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:53.760\nAnd an attacker who intercepts this has\nnothing meaningful to get out of it.\n\n393\n00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.880\nIt's just garbled mess, right?\n\n394\n00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.360\nAnd that's the advantage of encryption.\n\n395\n00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.530\nSo, VPNs are a special kind of network.\n\n396\n00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:05.880\nThey give it the privacy that you need,\neven though you're on a public network.\n\n397\n00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.060\nAnd they're very useful.\n\n398\n00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:09.310\nNow, I'm connected through New York,\nright.\n\n399\n00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:12.714\nAnd remember the beginning of the show,\nI went to what is my IP and\n\n400\n00:19:12.714 --> 00:19:15.501\nyou guys saw the public IP\nthat I was going out under.\n\n401\n00:19:15.501 --> 00:19:19.218\nWell now if I go to that website\nit's gonna show my IP address and\n\n402\n00:19:19.218 --> 00:19:23.777\nit's not gonna be that 209.251\naddress that we saw a few moments ago,\n\n403\n00:19:23.777 --> 00:19:26.465\nbecause now I'm bouncing through New York.\n\n404\n00:19:26.465 --> 00:19:31.519\nAnd see my address, 72.251.200.67 and\nif I do my IP information and\n\n405\n00:19:31.519 --> 00:19:35.033\ntake a look at it, well,\nI shouldn't see Gainesville,\n\n406\n00:19:35.033 --> 00:19:39.200\nFlorida anymore cuz now I'm\nbouncing through another city.\n\n407\n00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.540\nSo, I'm seeing the network\nas if I was in New York, and\n\n408\n00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:46.120\nnotice how slow this is going and that's\nbecause I'm being bounced through these\n\n409\n00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:50.320\nother locations and, oh actually it got\nmy location completely wrong didn't it.\n\n410\n00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.760\nIt's showing me as being\nin North Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\n411\n00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.520\nI thought I chose New, did I choose?\n\n412\n00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:55.140\n>> You did, yeah.\n\n413\n00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.230\n>> I chose New York, all right so\nI chose the right one.\n\n414\n00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:01.040\nSo, sometimes these geolocation things are\nwrong and in this case it happens to be.\n\n415\n00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.000\nBut you'll see it's viewing as\nan entirely different person.\n\n416\n00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.530\nVPNs are really useful for\nthat type of communication.\n\n417\n00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:09.000\n>> Yeah, Don,\nI remember we used to use those for\n\n418\n00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.620\nwhen I did remote work from home.\n\n419\n00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:14.040\nI would use a VPN to connect\nto our work network.\n\n420\n00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.150\nSo that all that traffic I was doing,\nI'm working on servers,\n\n421\n00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:17.590\nthings that have sensitive data.\n\n422\n00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:19.320\nWell, sometimes I'd do\nthis stuff after hours.\n\n423\n00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.060\nVPN was a great solution.\n\n424\n00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:24.550\nSo I could just create that, encrypt it,\ntunnel through the Internet,\n\n425\n00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:27.680\nuse that connection to connect\nto my work and I was good to go.\n\n426\n00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:32.000\nNow, another thing we use a lot in\nnetworks, Don, to protect ourselves.\n\n427\n00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.740\nTalking about protection, is firewalls.\n\n428\n00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:38.370\nWhat is it that we can use to stop\npeople from trying to get into\n\n429\n00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.030\nplaces that they shouldn't?\n\n430\n00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:43.720\nAnd firewalls tends to be the rescue\nof the when it comes to that.\n\n431\n00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.630\n>> Yeah,\ntoday it's rare to have a computer that\n\n432\n00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:46.810\nisn't connected to the Internet.\n\n433\n00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:49.750\nAnd the Internet is a global\nnetwork that's full of people,\n\n434\n00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.170\nsome of which are trustworthy,\nsome of which aren't.\n\n435\n00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:56.780\nAnd so firewalls filter the traffic that's\npassed as between you and the Internet.\n\n436\n00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:59.640\nNow you can have a hardware firewall,\nplenty of places do.\n\n437\n00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.760\nI use a hardware firewall at home.\n\n438\n00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.485\nBut even if you don't have a hardware\nfirewall, software firewalls are very\n\n439\n00:21:05.485 --> 00:21:09.339\neffective also, and the Window operating\nsystem has a firewall built in to it.\n\n440\n00:21:09.339 --> 00:21:13.101\nIt has since Windows XP,\nwhat was it, like service pack two?\n\n441\n00:21:13.101 --> 00:21:13.786\n>> Service pack two, yeah.\n\n442\n00:21:13.786 --> 00:21:14.330\n>> So that's when they rolled it out.\n\n443\n00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:17.380\nSo if you're running Windows Vista,\nWindows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10,\n\n444\n00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:21.070\nthey've all got a software\nfirewall built into them.\n\n445\n00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:22.550\nAnd it's turned on by default.\n\n446\n00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:24.520\nLet me show you here on\nthis Windows 8 machine.\n\n447\n00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.780\nI haven't tweaked its configuration, but\n\n448\n00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:31.800\nif I fire up my start screen here,\njust type in firewall,\n\n449\n00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.720\nI could've gone to my Control Panel,\nit's under network and security.\n\n450\n00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:39.080\nBut you'll see the Windows firewall right\nthere and you can take a look at it.\n\n451\n00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.960\nIt's turned on or\nat least hopefully it's turned on.\n\n452\n00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.550\nThere we go.\n\n453\n00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:43.960\nTurn on for private and\nguest or public networks.\n\n454\n00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.860\nAnd so it's filtering my traffic,\nall right?\n\n455\n00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.920\nNow, what is it doing?\n\n456\n00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:53.060\nWell, if I go back to my start screen,\nwhen I typed in firewall.\n\n457\n00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:53.945\nI guess I have to spell it right.\n\n458\n00:21:53.945 --> 00:21:54.445\nThere we go.\n\n459\n00:21:54.445 --> 00:21:57.110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That the second thing was allow an app\n\n460\n00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:59.240\nthrough the firewall,\ncheck firewall status.\n\n461\n00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.940\nBut there's also,\nif I search a little bit differently,\n\n462\n00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:06.170\nif I search for Windows firewall with.\n\n463\n00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:09.250\nYou'll find the Windows firewall\nwith advanced security.\n\n464\n00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:11.350\nIt will turn up eventually.\n\n465\n00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:14.290\nWell, actually we can get to\nit from the other screen.\n\n466\n00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:16.380\nIt will turn up, I guess,\nif I wait patiently and long enough.\n\n467\n00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:18.070\nDid I spell it?\nI must have spelled something wrong.\n\n468\n00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:20.860\nAll right, well, if I go back here,\nright from this screen,\n\n469\n00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:23.450\nyou can just go to Advanced Settings,\nand it'll take you to the same place.\n\n470\n00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:26.130\nAnd, in your firewall\nare basically a list of rules.\n\n471\n00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:28.930\nTraffic that it will allow to\ncome into your computer, and\n\n472\n00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:30.780\ntraffic that it allows to\ngo out of your computer.\n\n473\n00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:33.600\nSo you have inbound and outbound rules.\n\n474\n00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.840\nAnd these can get really specific,\n\n475\n00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:39.240\ndown to the individual port number,\nwhat's allowed to pass.\n\n476\n00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:44.680\nAnd Microsoft has set a lot of defaults up\nin here that hopefully meet your needs but\n\n477\n00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.960\nyou might need to tweak to adjust to\nallow some software to pass through or\n\n478\n00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.540\nsome software to be stopped.\n\n479\n00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.330\nBased on what it is that you need.\n\n480\n00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:52.760\nSo there's a ton of rules in it.\n\n481\n00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.440\nThere's hundreds of rules in here,\n\n482\n00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:58.130\nall dictating what's allowed to be\ncommunicated through your systems.\n\n483\n00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:01.640\nI definitely have to have Bing,\nfood, and drink communicating, so\n\n484\n00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.700\nthey've got that turned on for\nme which is nice.\n\n485\n00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:07.090\nBut you'll see there's other things\nthat might be blocked or whatever.\n\n486\n00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:09.410\nThese are the default\nthat they've created.\n\n487\n00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:10.480\n>> So in here we go in.\n\n488\n00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.820\nIf I need to open up a rule,\n\n489\n00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:15.300\nI have a program that specifically\ntries to access my computer.\n\n490\n00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:19.120\nI'm getting some kind of denied message\nusually or it's just not working.\n\n491\n00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.820\nA lot of times the firewall\ncan be blocking it.\n\n492\n00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:22.920\nThat's a good thing that\nmeans it's working.\n\n493\n00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.440\nWe need to go into those\nadvanced settings.\n\n494\n00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:27.500\nFind out where we need to open or\nclose something out so\n\n495\n00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:29.242\nthat we can allow that\nprogram to work correctly.\n\n496\n00:23:29.242 --> 00:23:33.220\n>> Yep, and while I was on that firewall\nscreen, let me go back to that,\n\n497\n00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:36.300\nyou guys might have noticed this where\nit says private networks and guest or\n\n498\n00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:37.380\npublic networks, all right?\n\n499\n00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:38.470\nWhat's that all about?\n\n500\n00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:41.670\nWell, in your firewall you have\nwhat are called security zones.\n\n501\n00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:46.320\nA zone is basically a network that\nyou either trust or you don't trust.\n\n502\n00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:50.510\nIf you trust the network you might\nallow a lot of communications over it.\n\n503\n00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:53.880\nBut if you don't trust the network,\nyou wanna lock things down, so\n\n504\n00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:57.940\nmaybe on my laptop when I go home,\nI wanna share folders and printers and\n\n505\n00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:01.120\nlet other people access them, but\nwhen I go to the coffee shop and\n\n506\n00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:04.160\nsit down and used their shared internet,\nI don't wanna share my files and\n\n507\n00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.870\nfolders with anybody on that network.\n\n508\n00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:10.920\nSo I trust my home network, I don't\ntrust my coffee shop network, right?\n\n509\n00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.370\nSo these are security zones.\n\n510\n00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:17.360\nEvery time you plug into a new network,\nit's going to ask us,\n\n511\n00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:20.680\nis this a private network or\nis this a public network?\n\n512\n00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:24.690\nIs it your home or your work or\nan untrusted network?\n\n513\n00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:28.070\nIt's asking us so\nit knows what rules to apply.\n\n514\n00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:31.470\nWhen I went into the advance settings and\npulled up that list of rules,\n\n515\n00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:34.570\nyou might have noticed how some\nwere grayed out, some were green.\n\n516\n00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:41.500\nIn the rules, you have a little section\nwhere it tells you the profile.\n\n517\n00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:46.250\nAnd some of the rules apply to all\nprofiles, some of the rules apply to\n\n518\n00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:51.400\nprivate or public or domain, or all three,\nand so you'll see mixtures there.\n\n519\n00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:54.630\nAnd when you're on a private network,\none that's trusted, you'll allow\n\n520\n00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:58.480\na lot more access, than when you're on\na public network, which is not trusted.\n\n521\n00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:01.400\nSo you'll see those kind of\nvariations as you go through here.\n\n522\n00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.550\nAnd there's just certain things that are\nallowed and certain things that aren't,\n\n523\n00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:04.670\ndepending on that network.\n\n524\n00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:08.260\nWell, Don, that's pretty cool\nstuff to be able to say, hey,\n\n525\n00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:09.890\nyou know what,\nI'm on a network I can trust.\n\n526\n00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:12.252\nI know Don is not gonna\ntry to attack my computer.\n\n527\n00:25:12.252 --> 00:25:14.089\nYou're not gonna try to\nattack my computer, right?\n\n528\n00:25:14.089 --> 00:25:16.445\n>> Okay, yeah, there's Don Pezet for you.\n\n529\n00:25:16.445 --> 00:25:18.014\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But no, in reality,\n\n530\n00:25:18.014 --> 00:25:20.874\nif we're on the same network,\nwe're in a work environment,\n\n531\n00:25:20.874 --> 00:25:24.229\nhe needs to be able to trust my computer,\nI need to be able to trust his, so\n\n532\n00:25:24.229 --> 00:25:25.830\nwe put it on that private network.\n\n533\n00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:28.910\nIt says, hey look, we know each other,\neverything's fine.\n\n534\n00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:30.900\nGo ahead and allow that more access.\n\n535\n00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:32.150\nYou're out in the public there.\n\n536\n00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:34.670\nLike we said,\nthat Internet's the wild, wild west.\n\n537\n00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:36.570\nYou start getting out to\nplaces you don't know,\n\n538\n00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:39.430\npeople you don't know and\nthey're all connecting together.\n\n539\n00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:42.580\nYou want to throw up a little bit more\nshielding than you normally would\n\n540\n00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:45.650\ninside of a nice trusted private network.\n\n541\n00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:48.420\nSo use your Windows firewall to do that.\n\n542\n00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:51.250\n>> Absolutely, yeah, and it doesn't\nhurt to have a hardware firewall also.\n\n543\n00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:52.340\nYou can use them in combination.\n\n544\n00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:53.280\nIt's a great solution.\n\n545\n00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:53.960\n>> That's right.\n\n546\n00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.960\nAll right, Don, well we've covered a lot\nof topics, I know we got some more stuff\n\n547\n00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.730\nto do, but as for this episode,\ndo we need to cover anything else?\n\n548\n00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:03.220\nNo, we definitely have some other networks\ntopics we need to get to, but for\n\n549\n00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:04.790\nthis one, it's a good spot for\nus to wrap this one up.\n\n550\n00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:05.700\n>> All right.\nWell everyone,\n\n551\n00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:07.010\nthanks for watching the show today.\n\n552\n00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:08.170\nWe really appreciate that.\n\n553\n00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:11.490\nDon, thanks for those demonstrations\nalways awesome, as usual.\n\n554\n00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:13.710\nWe're going go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n555\n00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:15.730\nI've been you host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n556\n00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:16.590\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n557\n00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:23.620\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:15.840\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.550\nJoining me today is none other than my\ngood friend, colleague Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n6\n00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.810\nHow's it going today, Don?\n\n7\n00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:21.592\n>> It is going great, Daniel.\n\n8\n00:00:21.592 --> 00:00:22.829\nGlad to be back on the show and\n\n9\n00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:25.805\nready to continue talking about\nsome of our network fundamentals.\n\n10\n00:00:25.805 --> 00:00:26.400\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Today,\n\n11\n00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.020\nwe're gonna be looking at a pretty\nimportant topic which is really just\n\n12\n00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.680\nkind of comparing some of\nthe different elements inside of a LAN\n\n13\n00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.860\nversus a WAN, right?\n\n14\n00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.970\nA local area network versus\na wide area network.\n\n15\n00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.450\nAnd let's just start with LANs,\nlocal area network.\n\n16\n00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.600\nAnd I know in the last episode,\n\n17\n00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.600\nI mentioned how a LAN is\nreally a network that you own.\n\n18\n00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.960\nThat you own all the different pieces\nof it, and it's all under your control.\n\n19\n00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.730\nVersus a WAN, which is a network\nthat you typically rent,\n\n20\n00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.950\nthat somebody else controls and\nyou gain access to it through them.\n\n21\n00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.730\nThat's kind of our different there.\n\n22\n00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.520\nBut, there's obviously a lot more to\nit than just who's paying the bill.\n\n23\n00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.280\nSo when we talk about a LAN, there's a lot\nof different pieces that kind of fall into\n\n24\n00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.650\nthat, and it's most basic.\n\n25\n00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.440\nWe usually think it's just\na couple of devices cuz\n\n26\n00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.790\nmodern day networks are so simple.\n\n27\n00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.330\nAt my home, my LAN is a wireless\ninternet router and my laptop.\n\n28\n00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.890\nThat’s my local area network, right?\n\n29\n00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.180\nIf you have other devices on the network\nthey may fall into that, right?\n\n30\n00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.900\nWhat are some of the other things\nwe have at home, do you know?\n\n31\n00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.515\n>> Oh, we’ve got tablets,\nwe’re got wired or\n\n32\n00:01:26.515 --> 00:01:31.575\nwireless printers, things of that nature,\nrouter or cable modem those as well.\n\n33\n00:01:31.575 --> 00:01:36.955\nAnything that is basically attached to\neach other inside of what we own right?\n\n34\n00:01:36.955 --> 00:01:41.630\nAgain, it boils to the actual devices\nthat we own that are connected together.\n\n35\n00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.520\n>> Yeah, and more and more, we need\nthose devices to be connected, right?\n\n36\n00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.300\nSo if you were to walk\ninto my house right now,\n\n37\n00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.730\nI'm sure one of my kids is\nwatching Netflix on a Roku.\n\n38\n00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.190\nAnd that little box is\nconnected out to the Internet.\n\n39\n00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.610\nOr my wife is using her laptop, or\nour network printer is doing an update.\n\n40\n00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.150\nThey all reach out to the Internet,\n\n41\n00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.170\nwhich starts to blur that\nline between WAN and LAN.\n\n42\n00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.720\nBut on the LAN side,\nthe devices you have control over.\n\n43\n00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.040\nYou can do what you need to.\n\n44\n00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.660\nNow, you might have devices that are kind\nof in between that local network and\n\n45\n00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.810\nthe remote side, right?\n\n46\n00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.490\nFor example if you're a business,\nyou might have a web server.\n\n47\n00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.770\nAnd the web server is on your network.\n\n48\n00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.400\nSo it's considered a land device, but\nyou're allowing people on the internet to\n\n49\n00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.240\nget to that server, and\nthat's dangerous, right?\n\n50\n00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.220\nBecause people on the internet can\ndo all sorts of bad things, so\n\n51\n00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.210\nyou don't want them coming\ninside of your network.\n\n52\n00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.190\nSo oftentimes on our LAN, you might\nhave a special little area called a DMZ,\n\n53\n00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.270\nwhich is short of demilitarized zone.\n\n54\n00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.710\nIt's basically like a quarantine zone,\nwhere you put servers and\n\n55\n00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.460\nother resources that you want\nto expose to the Internet.\n\n56\n00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.290\nAnd that way if somebody breaks into those\nservers, and they compromise your DMZ.\n\n57\n00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.270\nThey're stuck in that little area, and\n\n58\n00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.860\nthey can't get into the rest\nof your local area network.\n\n59\n00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.610\nSo your local area network may have that.\n\n60\n00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.640\nNow at a home,\nyou're not going to have that.\n\n61\n00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.970\nI don't have that on my home.\n\n62\n00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.472\nDaniel, do you use DMZ at your place?\n\n63\n00:02:58.472 --> 00:03:00.408\n>> No, no DMZ's at my house.\n\n64\n00:03:00.408 --> 00:03:02.260\nI'm standard network.\n\n65\n00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.150\n>> But if your a small business or\na large business, you may.\n\n66\n00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.810\nAnd more and more people are going to\nthe Cloud for these type of things.\n\n67\n00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.990\nSo you put your webserver on a Cloud\nsystem, and it's not on your LAN anymore.\n\n68\n00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.120\nSo you may or\nmay not have that DMZ type of environment.\n\n69\n00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.490\nBut, that is a kind of\nspecial element that we find.\n\n70\n00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.910\nNow, one of the easiest ways to spot\nwhether you're on a local area network or\n\n71\n00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.620\non the internet is your IP address.\n\n72\n00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.580\nNow, I know we already had\nthe episode on IP addressing.\n\n73\n00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.760\nMost of you guys have already seen that so\nwe don't need to rehash those too much.\n\n74\n00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.080\nBut remember that on a local area network,\nyou're going to be using private IPs.\n\n75\n00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.635\nNow, IP addresses are controlled\nby the IANA which is\n\n76\n00:03:37.635 --> 00:03:40.566\nthe Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.\n\n77\n00:03:40.566 --> 00:03:42.660\nI had to cheat,\nI've got their webpage pulled up here.\n\n78\n00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.540\nIf you have a board and\nwanna learn it, it's IANA.org.\n\n79\n00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.570\nThese are the guys who control\naddressing across the world.\n\n80\n00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.850\nAnd most IP addresses are public addresses\nthat have to be registered with the IANA.\n\n81\n00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.370\nNow, each continent is\ncontrolled by different entity,\n\n82\n00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.080\nand the IANA is the worldwide\nbody that governs all of them.\n\n83\n00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.770\nSo if I need addresses and I called\nthe IANA, they're not gonna help me.\n\n84\n00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.270\nThey're gonna refer me to the one for\nNorth America.\n\n85\n00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.060\nAnd here in North America,\nwe have the ARIN,\n\n86\n00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.760\nthe American Registry for\nInternet Numbers.\n\n87\n00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.950\nAnd I can go to them and\nget addresses for public networks,\n\n88\n00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.900\nnetworks that are on the Internet.\n\n89\n00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.540\nBut if I'm on my local network,\nthere's private IPs that are available for\n\n90\n00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.440\nus to use.\n\n91\n00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.540\nThere is an IEEE standard,\nor it's an RFC actually.\n\n92\n00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.420\nSo there's RFC,\n\n93\n00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.460\nRFC 1918 that defines certain IP\naddresses to use on a local area network.\n\n94\n00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:39.010\nAnd you are more than likely using these\non your own network at home or at work.\n\n95\n00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.620\nThese are very common.\n\n96\n00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.010\nAnd it's because we don't have\nto go out and register them, and\n\n97\n00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.830\nthey're not out there on the Internet and\nall that.\n\n98\n00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.010\nSo you can recognize RFC\n1919 addresses because\n\n99\n00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.480\nthey always start with the same numbers.\n\n100\n00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.670\nSo there's addresses that start with\n10.something.something.something, right?\n\n101\n00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.000\nSo if I do an IP configure here and I see\nmy address, well it doesn't start with 10.\n\n102\n00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.920\nBut if you see 10.\n\n103\n00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.260\nthat's a private IP.\n\n104\n00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.400\nYou're more than likely on\na local area network or\n\n105\n00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.330\na misconfigured WAN, normally a LAN.\n\n106\n00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.710\nThere's also 172.16,\nall the way through 172.31.\n\n107\n00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.340\nThose are also private IPs, right?\n\n108\n00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.598\nSo if you see 172.16, 172.17,\n172.18 all the way to 172.31.\n\n109\n00:05:24.598 --> 00:05:26.358\nAll right.\n\n110\n00:05:26.358 --> 00:05:30.190\nAnd then, there's 192.168.\n\n111\n00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.630\nIf your address starts with 192.168,\nthat's the last of the private ranges and\n\n112\n00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.640\nthat means you're on a LAN.\n\n113\n00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.830\nThose private ranges are not\nallowed to talk on the Internet.\n\n114\n00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.260\nIf you go to the Internet with one of\nthese IPs, your data just gets dropped.\n\n115\n00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.140\nYour Internet service\nprovider won't allow it.\n\n116\n00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.870\nSo when we go to the Internet,\nwe typically change our IP in transit.\n\n117\n00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.810\nWe use what's called\nNetwork Address Translation, or NAT.\n\n118\n00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.744\nAnd it changes us, so\nif I were to go out to a site like.\n\n119\n00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.551\nWe'll use good old IPmonkey.\n\n120\n00:06:00.551 --> 00:06:03.570\nAnd if I go to IPmonkey,\nit'll tell me what my IP address is.\n\n121\n00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:08.876\nAnd I'll see that my IP address,\nI just saw it, it was 192.168.something,\n\n122\n00:06:08.876 --> 00:06:12.970\nbut when I come here,\nit's 209.251.159.179.\n\n123\n00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.850\nMy router is sitting between my LAN and\nthe WAN, and it's changing my IP\n\n124\n00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.200\naddress in transit so that I'm allowed\nto function out there on the internet.\n\n125\n00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.700\nAnd that's important, right?\n\n126\n00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.090\nWe need to be able to change those\naddresses as we move through.\n\n127\n00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.900\nOkay, so that's kinda the easy way\nto identify if you're on a LAN.\n\n128\n00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.620\nThere's a lot of different things there,\nbut LANs can be a lot more complex.\n\n129\n00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:41.630\nOn a lot of networks, like on mine here,\nI'm on the 192.168.41 network.\n\n130\n00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.380\nAnybody else here in the building that's\non the 192.168.41 network can see me.\n\n131\n00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.860\nAnd I can see them.\n\n132\n00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.890\nBut what if I need more than one network?\n\n133\n00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:52.780\nWell, you can deploy separate switches,\nand separate routers and\n\n134\n00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.720\nhave truly separate networks.\n\n135\n00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.321\nOr, we could take one network and divide\nit up into a what a lot of businesses and\n\n136\n00:06:59.321 --> 00:07:02.350\nemployers call VLANs or\nvirtual local area networks.\n\n137\n00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:06.880\nWhere you take one LAN, and you divide\nit into multiple virtual networks.\n\n138\n00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.750\nA lot of business switches support this.\n\n139\n00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.360\nYou might have a 48 port switch that\nall your computers plug in to, and\n\n140\n00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.049\nyou take the first 12 ports and\nmake it one network.\n\n141\n00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.080\nAnd the next twelve ports make\nthem another network, and\n\n142\n00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.710\nthe, the third set of twelve ports,\nyou're a third network.\n\n143\n00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.640\nAnd now, you divide up into\nthree separate networks.\n\n144\n00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.190\nNow, why would I do that?\n\n145\n00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.220\nWhy would I want to separate those out?\n\n146\n00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.780\nWell, I might have employees\nwith different levels of access.\n\n147\n00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.700\nI might have executives who are moving\npayroll data or something, and\n\n148\n00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.200\nI don't other employees to have access to\nthat, so I start splitting my network up.\n\n149\n00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.950\nSo LANs can actually get a little\ncomplexed if you want them to be.\n\n150\n00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.620\nMost people, though, your local area\nnetwork is going to be fairly simple.\n\n151\n00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.390\n>> Yeah, and then that's where\nthe subnet mask comes into play,\n\n152\n00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.730\nto let you know what\nnetwork you're actually on.\n\n153\n00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:53.320\nThat way I know if Don is one VLAN,\nI'm on a different one.\n\n154\n00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.892\nHow do I know if I'm on a different VLAN?\n\n155\n00:07:54.892 --> 00:07:58.224\nWell, I look at his or\nmy IP address and see a sub-net mask.\n\n156\n00:07:58.224 --> 00:08:00.139\nIt tells me what network I'm on.\n\n157\n00:08:00.139 --> 00:08:02.043\nWe see Don's does the same thing.\n\n158\n00:08:02.043 --> 00:08:05.957\nIf you take a look at it, you'll see there\nmay a difference between the two, and\n\n159\n00:08:05.957 --> 00:08:10.107\nthose networks fall in certain ranges, so\nthat's how we can segregate that data and\n\n160\n00:08:10.107 --> 00:08:11.970\neven optimize traffic as well.\n\n161\n00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.318\n>> Yeah, and you know,\nwhen I ran ipconfig,\n\n162\n00:08:14.318 --> 00:08:19.149\nyou can see it right there where my\naddress showed us 192.168.41.143 and\n\n163\n00:08:19.149 --> 00:08:24.568\nthat Subnet Mask is 255.255.255.0, that's\ntelling me any number that has a 255\n\n164\n00:08:24.568 --> 00:08:28.444\nis part of the network and any number\nthat has a zero is part of the host.\n\n165\n00:08:28.444 --> 00:08:34.600\nSo I'm 192.168.41, that's my network,\nand.143, that's me.\n\n166\n00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.340\nIf somebody else has .144,\nI can talk to them, right.\n\n167\n00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:38.703\nThey're on the same network as me.\n\n168\n00:08:38.703 --> 00:08:41.123\nBut if their first three\nnumbers here are different,\n\n169\n00:08:41.123 --> 00:08:43.190\nthey're not on the same network as me.\n\n170\n00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.430\nAnd I'm gonna go through\na router to get to them.\n\n171\n00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:46.050\nAll right?\n\n172\n00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:48.670\nNow the other thing to remember\nabout your Local Area Network\n\n173\n00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:52.370\nis that there's different types of\nphysical networks you might be using.\n\n174\n00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:56.300\nYou might have a wired network or\na wireless network.\n\n175\n00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.950\nI'm on a wired network right here.\n\n176\n00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:00.150\nIt's telling me I'm on\nan ethernet adapter,\n\n177\n00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:03.770\nwhich is a physical adapter and\nyou can't really see it on camera I guess,\n\n178\n00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:06.820\nbut I've got a little cable\nsticking out of my laptop here.\n\n179\n00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:10.480\nSo I've actually plugged a wire\ninto my system to get access.\n\n180\n00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.430\nAll right?\n\n181\n00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.670\nI could also use wireless.\n\n182\n00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:17.620\nAnd if I jump down to my system tray, down\nhere at the bottom, and click my little\n\n183\n00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:21.420\nnetwork icon, my head's kind of covering\nit up, but if I jump down here and\n\n184\n00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:25.310\nclick this little network icon you'll\nsee where I can pick my networks.\n\n185\n00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:27.980\nAnd right now I've got a connection\non an ethernet adapter,\n\n186\n00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:29.790\nwhich is that physical plug.\n\n187\n00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:33.400\nBut I've also got Wi-Fi too,\nand I can flip that on, and\n\n188\n00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.610\nnow I start to see wireless\nnetworks that I can connect to.\n\n189\n00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:40.970\nSo for example, I might wanna\nconnect to my ITProTV network.\n\n190\n00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:44.840\nAnd if I choose that, now I'm gonna reach\nout and connect to this via wireless.\n\n191\n00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.170\nNow, here I am on the show, and\n\n192\n00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:51.170\nI'm using the wired one when\nI've got wireless right here.\n\n193\n00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:55.825\nNow, why wouldn't I want to use\nthe wireless one, if it's so\n\n194\n00:09:55.825 --> 00:09:57.735\nmuch more convenient, right?\n\n195\n00:09:57.735 --> 00:09:58.905\n>> That's a good question, Don.\n\n196\n00:09:58.905 --> 00:10:03.085\nIt usually comes down to speed,\ngreasy fast speed, right?\n\n197\n00:10:03.085 --> 00:10:04.175\n>> Speed and reliability.\n\n198\n00:10:04.175 --> 00:10:08.410\nA wireless network is nice but\nit's wireless.\n\n199\n00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:10.690\nThe more walls in-between you and\nthe transmitter,\n\n200\n00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:11.890\nthe weaker your signal's gonna be.\n\n201\n00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:15.090\nAnd so your signal can come and go,\nit might be great one moment and\n\n202\n00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:15.760\nweak in the next.\n\n203\n00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.340\nYou might lose connectivity and during the\nshow I don't want to lose my connectivity\n\n204\n00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.090\nso I plug in the good old wire.\n\n205\n00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:23.430\nBut then there's speed.\n\n206\n00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:27.210\nMost wireless networks today\nat least are 54 megabit.\n\n207\n00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:30.390\nWhen you plug in a cable connection\nmost of those are at least 100 megabit,\n\n208\n00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:31.180\nmaybe more.\n\n209\n00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.600\nSo you can get more bandwidth on that\ndirect connection and it's more reliable.\n\n210\n00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.740\nBut at home, if I'm watching TV,\nsure is nice to fire up that laptop and\n\n211\n00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:42.800\nnot have to plug in anything to access the\nnetwork, so there's different times for\n\n212\n00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.960\neach type of network.\n\n213\n00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.790\nBut a local area network could be wired,\ncould be wireless,\n\n214\n00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:48.020\nit just depends on that preference.\n\n215\n00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.860\nAll right, now that's the local side.\n\n216\n00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.690\nWhat about the wide area network?\n\n217\n00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:55.190\nI'm connected to the Internet.\n\n218\n00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.830\nWell, how am I connected to the Internet?\n\n219\n00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:00.230\nYour laptop or\nyour desktop doesn't really know, right?\n\n220\n00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:01.050\nIt sees a router.\n\n221\n00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:02.880\nIf I wanna go out to the Internet,\nI'm gonna go through a router.\n\n222\n00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:08.090\nI shouldn't have closed that, cause it's\nin your, in the IP config output there,\n\n223\n00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:10.270\nit listed my default gateway.\n\n224\n00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:11.504\nAnd my default gateway,\n\n225\n00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:15.263\nthat's the router that I'm gonna go\nthrough on my way out of the network, so\n\n226\n00:11:15.263 --> 00:11:18.929\nif I were to take a look at that here,\nI'll just bring my IP config back up.\n\n227\n00:11:18.929 --> 00:11:24.434\nI see my IP address, and\nI see a default gateway of 192.1.168.4.2.\n\n228\n00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:27.500\nThat's the router I'm gonna go through\nif I want to go to the Internet.\n\n229\n00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:31.910\nThat router has to be connected\nto the wide area network, and\n\n230\n00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:35.010\non the wide area network,\nnetworks are different, all right?\n\n231\n00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.710\nWe don't usually connect\nwireless to those.\n\n232\n00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:40.860\nAnd while we do normally connect wired,\nit's usually a different\n\n233\n00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:44.430\ntype of wire based on the wide\narea network that it is, right?\n\n234\n00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.160\nSo, let's take a minute and\ntalk about some of the different types\n\n235\n00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.090\nof wide area network connections that\nare out there, cuz they're quite a few.\n\n236\n00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:51.350\nAll right?\n\n237\n00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:52.310\nWhen you connect, for\n\n238\n00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:56.750\na home user the most common one\nthat we're gonna see is broadband.\n\n239\n00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:01.050\nAnd broadband comes in two main forms\nright now, we've got DSL and cable.\n\n240\n00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:02.910\nNow, Daniel,\nwhat do you have at your house?\n\n241\n00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:05.260\n>> Yeah, I'm running cable and\nI love every minute of it.\n\n242\n00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.718\n>> Yeah, broadband connections\nare nice and fast, right?\n\n243\n00:12:08.718 --> 00:12:12.010\nCable, DSL, you can usually get,\ndo you know what speed you have?\n\n244\n00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:13.936\n>> Yeah,\nI think I'm getting 50 megabits a second?\n\n245\n00:12:13.936 --> 00:12:15.880\n>> Yeah, you're paying for\nthe big package.\n\n246\n00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.060\nI have cable at my house too,\nI think I only get 20 megs.\n\n247\n00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.976\nNate, our producer over there,\nis laughing at me cuz he pays for\n\n248\n00:12:21.976 --> 00:12:23.119\nthe really big package.\n\n249\n00:12:23.119 --> 00:12:24.341\nSo apparently I'm a tightwad.\n\n250\n00:12:24.341 --> 00:12:24.950\n>> Yeah.\n\n251\n00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:26.189\n[LAUGH] Come off the wallet, Pezet.\n\n252\n00:12:26.189 --> 00:12:27.145\n>> I know.\n\n253\n00:12:27.145 --> 00:12:31.631\nBut DSL runs over your phone line,\nand you usually get like a minimum of\n\n254\n00:12:31.631 --> 00:12:35.370\na couple of megabits, but\nas much as 14 megabit or so on.\n\n255\n00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.560\nAnd you can get a pretty decent\nconnection out of those.\n\n256\n00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.020\nAnd it doesn't break the bank.\n\n257\n00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:42.142\nAlthough apparently I'm\nnot a good judge of that.\n\n258\n00:12:42.142 --> 00:12:45.629\n$50, $60 a month, something like that, and\nyou get some pretty good speed out of it.\n\n259\n00:12:45.629 --> 00:12:47.477\nBut we didn't always have that, right?\n\n260\n00:12:47.477 --> 00:12:52.339\nIn the 1980s, and most of the 1990s,\nif you wanted to connect to the Internet,\n\n261\n00:12:52.339 --> 00:12:53.800\nyou used dial up, right?\n\n262\n00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.290\nAnd I've got a little diagram here.\n\n263\n00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:59.280\nWith dial up, you basically had your\ncomputer and you plugged into a modem.\n\n264\n00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.950\nAnd a modem would take your data\nthat you were sending to it, and\n\n265\n00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:06.010\nturn it into an analog data\nto send across phone lines.\n\n266\n00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:09.060\nAnd it would basically reach out to\nsome system on the other side, and\n\n267\n00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.480\nyou'd be able to communicate.\n\n268\n00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:15.850\nThe problem is, your computer communicates\ndigitally, and dial-up access was analog.\n\n269\n00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:19.260\nSo it was having to convert your data,\nAnd your communications were slow.\n\n270\n00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.603\nYou were lucky, like the best\nyou could get out of it here in\n\n271\n00:13:22.603 --> 00:13:25.414\nthe United States was\n53 kilobits per second.\n\n272\n00:13:25.414 --> 00:13:26.451\n53 k.\n\n273\n00:13:26.451 --> 00:13:27.180\nRight?\n\n274\n00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:30.940\nNow, remember earlier I said wireless\nnetworks are usually 54 megabit.\n\n275\n00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.632\nRight?\nSo we're talking ten times,\n\n276\n00:13:32.632 --> 00:13:33.638\nthat's not ten times.\n\n277\n00:13:33.638 --> 00:13:35.510\nThat's like a hundred times-\n>> Yeah, way more than that-\n\n278\n00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:36.890\n>> A hundred times faster,\n\n279\n00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:37.420\nwhatever, right?\n\n280\n00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.150\nApparently math is not my forte either.\n\n281\n00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:40.913\nMath and finances.\n\n282\n00:13:40.913 --> 00:13:41.805\nDon't count on me there.\n\n283\n00:13:41.805 --> 00:13:43.188\n>> They're correlated.\n\n284\n00:13:43.188 --> 00:13:47.180\n>> [LAUGH] So it's just so\nmuch faster today.\n\n285\n00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:48.665\nWell, I used to use dial-up.\n\n286\n00:13:48.665 --> 00:13:52.119\nI paid $20 a month for\ndial-up Internet access for years.\n\n287\n00:13:52.119 --> 00:13:56.223\nFrom 1992 all the way to probably 2000.\n\n288\n00:13:56.223 --> 00:13:58.520\nAnd that was kinda how it was.\n\n289\n00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:02.910\nAnd now we pay not much more and\nyou just get tons more bandwidth.\n\n290\n00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:06.520\nAnd we need that, because we're doing\nstreaming video, and downloading files.\n\n291\n00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.440\nAnd it's just a lot of data.\n\n292\n00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.400\nYou need more bandwidth.\n\n293\n00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:13.900\n>> I'm gonna watch ITPro TV on a dial-up\nsession just to see what that looks like.\n\n294\n00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.380\nThe days of the pixelation.\n\n295\n00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:17.840\n>> Yeah, the pain.\n\n296\n00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.536\nI mean imagine Facebook,\ncuz you'd go to view a photo and\n\n297\n00:14:20.536 --> 00:14:23.230\nit was just kinda load like\npixel line by pixel line.\n\n298\n00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:24.380\nIt'd be a nightmare.\n\n299\n00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.026\nSo that's obviously one option.\n\n300\n00:14:26.026 --> 00:14:28.364\nDSL is a better option, right?\n\n301\n00:14:28.364 --> 00:14:31.130\nSo I have a little diagram here\nthat shows kinda how DSL works.\n\n302\n00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:32.930\nWith DSL,\nyour computer's plugging into a modem.\n\n303\n00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:38.080\nNot much different, but\nDSL, it stands for digital\n\n304\n00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:43.500\nsubscriber line, and what it is is digital\ncommunications over your phone line.\n\n305\n00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.880\nAnd because it's digital,\nthat means one's and zero's,\n\n306\n00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.040\nthat it's sending over the lines,\nit can push a heck of a lot more.\n\n307\n00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.940\nSo it still uses your phone line.\n\n308\n00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.760\nBut it crosses the phone network, and\n\n309\n00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.360\nthe phone company uses\na device called a DSLAM.\n\n310\n00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:00.210\nAnd what a DSLAM does is it grabs your\ndigital data off of that analog line, and\n\n311\n00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:02.700\nthrows it over into their network and\nsends you out to the Internet, right?\n\n312\n00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.100\nIt's pretty impressive stuff.\n\n313\n00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:09.270\nAnd they can give you considerable\nhigh amounts of data.\n\n314\n00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:12.670\nThe low end plans are usually a megabit,\nbut you can get 14 megabit,\n\n315\n00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.530\nI've even heard of 20 megabit on DSL.\n\n316\n00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:16.800\nYou can get some pretty\ngood speeds out of it and\n\n317\n00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.730\nit's all over the regular phone line so\nit's like the replacement and\n\n318\n00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:23.590\nas soon as this technology became\npopularized, dial up access died.\n\n319\n00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.900\nAnd so you really don't see\ndial up access anymore, right.\n\n320\n00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:31.400\nNow for businesses though,\nbroadband has a big limitation, right.\n\n321\n00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.680\nAnd cable works the same way\nexcept not over your phone line,\n\n322\n00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.580\ninstead it works over the cable\ntelevision connection,\n\n323\n00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:39.710\nright, the coax cable\nthat's run into your house.\n\n324\n00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.460\nWell, the problem with those guys is\nthey're typically what are called\n\n325\n00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:44.050\nasynchronous connections.\n\n326\n00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:46.590\nYou have one speed upload and\none speed download.\n\n327\n00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:50.562\nWell, I keep saying at home I have\na 20 megabit cable connection.\n\n328\n00:15:50.562 --> 00:15:52.594\nDaniel, you said 40 megabit,\nor 50 megabit.\n\n329\n00:15:52.594 --> 00:15:53.094\n>> 50, yeah.\n>> Right.\n\n330\n00:15:53.094 --> 00:15:54.634\nSo, what we really mean is,\n\n331\n00:15:54.634 --> 00:15:59.604\nI've got a 20 megabit download speed, and\nDaniel's got a 50 megabit download speed.\n\n332\n00:15:59.604 --> 00:16:01.278\nWhen you download from the Internet,\n\n333\n00:16:01.278 --> 00:16:04.169\nthat's where you're downloading at,\nBut what about uploads?\n\n334\n00:16:04.169 --> 00:16:06.406\nWell, on an asynchronous connection,\n\n335\n00:16:06.406 --> 00:16:09.420\nyour upload speed is lower\nthan your download speed.\n\n336\n00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:12.710\nThey take away upload speed to make\nmore room for the download speed so\n\n337\n00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:14.030\nyou get better access.\n\n338\n00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.910\nAnd think about what you upload.\n\n339\n00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:20.470\nWhen I go to Netflix to watch a movie, I'm\njust uploading mouse clicks as I click on\n\n340\n00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:24.380\nmovies to show, and then they're\nsending me an entire HD movie.\n\n341\n00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:28.060\nSo obviously I'm downloading a lot\nmore than I'm uploading, for a person.\n\n342\n00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.040\nBut for a business it's a different story.\n\n343\n00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:34.370\nHere at the studio we're streaming\nthis video to you guys, and\n\n344\n00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:37.260\nthat means that we have to\nhave the bandwidth to upload.\n\n345\n00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:41.500\nAnd so for a business, DSL and\ncable are not normally suitable.\n\n346\n00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:45.690\nNow you can buy business-class DSL and\nbusiness-class cable, and\n\n347\n00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:48.040\nthose have a higher upload speed on them.\n\n348\n00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:51.597\nBut normally a business is gonna\ntransition to a leased line.\n\n349\n00:16:51.597 --> 00:16:54.390\nAnd we talked about leased\nlines in the first episode.\n\n350\n00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:57.130\nLet's take a look at those a little more.\n\n351\n00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:00.350\nThere's a number of different\ntypes of leased lines, but\n\n352\n00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:04.000\nthe one that Microsoft\ncalls out are the DSOs.\n\n353\n00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.280\nAnd they don't actually call them\nDSOs in the exam objectives.\n\n354\n00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.820\nIn the exam objectives they call it T1,\nE1, T3, E3.\n\n355\n00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:13.770\nSo let's talk a little bit about these.\n\n356\n00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:17.570\nBefore DSL and cable,\nback in the dial-up days,\n\n357\n00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:21.350\nI used to drool over the idea\nof having one of these lines.\n\n358\n00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:25.392\nThese were amazing bandwidth at\na time when you couldn't get that.\n\n359\n00:17:25.392 --> 00:17:30.275\nWhen 53K was your maximum, you could get\nthese leased lines that could do hundreds\n\n360\n00:17:30.275 --> 00:17:35.110\nof megabits of data, and it was just\na dream to even think that was possible.\n\n361\n00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:37.610\nIn today's networks, it's a lot different.\n\n362\n00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:42.150\nBut for businesses, they still use these\nbecause they have an equal upload and\n\n363\n00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:44.809\ndownload speed, so\nyou get reliable bandwidth.\n\n364\n00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:52.550\nNow the term T1 and E1, T3, E3, they're\nreferring to a couple of different things.\n\n365\n00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:58.080\nFirst off, a leased line is typically\nmade up of 64 kilobit channels.\n\n366\n00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:02.620\nSo you'll have a channel which is\nreferred to as a DSL or DS0, and\n\n367\n00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:05.640\na DS0 is 64 kilobits.\n\n368\n00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.780\nAnd when I buy a leased line,\nyou don't actually buy it outright,\n\n369\n00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:11.630\nyou lease it,\nyou rent it from a service provider.\n\n370\n00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:14.140\nYou're basically getting\na certain amount of channels.\n\n371\n00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:19.450\nIf you get a T1,\nyou're getting 24 of those DS0s.\n\n372\n00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:25.050\nAnd if you get a T3,\nyou're getting 672 of those DS0s.\n\n373\n00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:29.553\nAnd they're all bonded together,\nso that T1 basically gives you 1.5\n\n374\n00:18:29.553 --> 00:18:34.130\nmegabit of data, and\nthat T3 gives you 44.77 megabit of data.\n\n375\n00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:37.520\nSo at 44 megabit, that's more than\nmy cable connection right now.\n\n376\n00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:41.736\nBut this is 44 megabit down and\n44 megabit up.\n\n377\n00:18:41.736 --> 00:18:45.590\nYou get equal bandwidth and\nit's dedicated to you.\n\n378\n00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:48.440\nMy cable connection,\nI go to a cable company,\n\n379\n00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:52.570\nthe same one Daniel does, most likely,\nand we're in a community.\n\n380\n00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:55.260\nWe share that bandwidth.\n\n381\n00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.814\nSo if my neighbor is running\nbit torrents like crazy,\n\n382\n00:18:57.814 --> 00:19:00.770\nthat hurts my Internet\nconnection cuz it's shared.\n\n383\n00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:05.486\nBut on a leased line, that's dedicated\nbandwidth, so businesses use these a lot.\n\n384\n00:19:05.486 --> 00:19:08.660\nNow when they were created,\nthere was a little bit of a divide.\n\n385\n00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:12.124\nHere in the United States we have an\norganization that define this stuff, and\n\n386\n00:19:12.124 --> 00:19:14.112\nthey define T1s and T3s and how they work.\n\n387\n00:19:14.112 --> 00:19:16.640\nThey really define the DSOs too.\n\n388\n00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.556\nIn Europe they have a different\norganization that manages that, and\n\n389\n00:19:20.556 --> 00:19:23.729\nso they created a different\nset of nomenclature, and so\n\n390\n00:19:23.729 --> 00:19:25.566\nthey created the E1s and E3s.\n\n391\n00:19:25.566 --> 00:19:28.443\nThe Ts, those are used here in\nNorth America and in Japan,\n\n392\n00:19:28.443 --> 00:19:32.783\nbecause the US actually set up most\nof the phone infrastructure in Japan.\n\n393\n00:19:32.783 --> 00:19:37.315\nBut the Es, those are used in Europe and\nin a lot of other Asian,\n\n394\n00:19:37.315 --> 00:19:41.061\neven Australia, where European nations\nhelped to build those networks.\n\n395\n00:19:41.061 --> 00:19:45.760\nSo E1s and E3s, they're still using\nthose 64K DSOs under the hood.\n\n396\n00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:49.710\nBut an E1 is 2 megabit and E3 is 34\nmegabit because they have a different\n\n397\n00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:52.010\namount of channels inside of them.\n\n398\n00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:56.004\nThese lines are super reliable,\nthey're dedicated to you, and\n\n399\n00:19:56.004 --> 00:19:57.825\nthey're pretty expensive.\n\n400\n00:19:57.825 --> 00:19:59.090\nThey're pretty expensive.\n\n401\n00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:04.890\nThe price has come down on these things\na lot, but a T1 here in the United States,\n\n402\n00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:09.864\nin my area at least, will usually run\nyou between $200 and $300 a month for\n\n403\n00:20:09.864 --> 00:20:11.060\n1.5 megabit.\n\n404\n00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:13.549\nVersus Daniel, do you know what\nyou're paying for 50 megabits?\n\n405\n00:20:13.549 --> 00:20:15.849\n>> Yeah, I'm paying $67 a month.\n\n406\n00:20:15.849 --> 00:20:18.852\n>> $67, so significantly less than the T1,\n\n407\n00:20:18.852 --> 00:20:22.090\nbut your upload speed is\nmaybe 1 megabit on that.\n\n408\n00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:23.100\n>> [CROSSTALK] Yeah.\n\n409\n00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.024\n>> So it doesn't necessarily equal\nout what we can get with some\n\n410\n00:20:25.024 --> 00:20:25.713\nof these other ones.\n\n411\n00:20:25.713 --> 00:20:28.305\nA T3, on the other hand,\nit can be several hundred,\n\n412\n00:20:28.305 --> 00:20:31.550\neven several thousand dollars\na month to get that access.\n\n413\n00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:34.230\nBut if you're running a business,\nthat's what you need.\n\n414\n00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:36.403\nNow this is slowly being replaced, too,\n\n415\n00:20:36.403 --> 00:20:39.269\nbecause now we have something\ncalled Metro Ethernet.\n\n416\n00:20:39.269 --> 00:20:43.119\nAnd with Metro Ethernet what they do is\ninstead of running all of these DSOs,\n\n417\n00:20:43.119 --> 00:20:46.427\nall of these different channels\nto you through the phone system,\n\n418\n00:20:46.427 --> 00:20:50.460\ninstead they can just bury fiber optics\nand run it right to your building.\n\n419\n00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:53.730\nAnd they can give you a gig\nof data on one fiber link.\n\n420\n00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:57.750\nAnd if they do that,\nit's not having to run a ton of DSOs,\n\n421\n00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.960\nit's not using the phone system,\nit's a separate network.\n\n422\n00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.340\nAnd so Metro E is killing this off.\n\n423\n00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:04.289\nSo that's what we have here at the studio.\n\n424\n00:21:04.289 --> 00:21:05.915\nI think we're at 80 megabit now.\n\n425\n00:21:05.915 --> 00:21:09.810\nWe have an 80 megabit\nconnection that's fiber optic.\n\n426\n00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:12.260\nAnd I wanna say our bill is, oh, gee,\n\n427\n00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:16.620\nI don't know, it's something\nlike $1,100 or $1,200 a month.\n\n428\n00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:18.740\nWhich I know that sounds a like a lot for\na home user, but\n\n429\n00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:22.050\nfor a business considering how we use it,\n80 megabit.\n\n430\n00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:26.310\nI couldn't get a T3 for $1,200 a month,\nnot here in Gainesville.\n\n431\n00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:28.710\nMaybe in other cities I might be\nable to get one, but not here.\n\n432\n00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:33.180\nSo we get this fiber optic connection, and\nif I wanna bump up the bandwidth on that\n\n433\n00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.550\nfiber optic connection,\nI can just call our service provider and\n\n434\n00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:37.970\nthey can dial it up right there,\nthey don't have to run new cable.\n\n435\n00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:40.448\nBut if I get a T3 and\nI wanna move its bandwidth up,\n\n436\n00:21:40.448 --> 00:21:43.171\nI've gotta order another T3 and\nbond them together.\n\n437\n00:21:43.171 --> 00:21:46.510\nAnd then I gotta keep\nadding more DSOs to it.\n\n438\n00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:50.370\nThat's actual cable that has to be run,\nand that gets expensive too.\n\n439\n00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:53.290\nSo these lines are becoming less and\nless common.\n\n440\n00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.540\nThere's other types of\nconnectivity out there.\n\n441\n00:21:56.540 --> 00:22:01.020\nMicrosoft just hit on those, but\nthere's things like Frame Relay, MPLS,\n\n442\n00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:03.640\nATM, satellite Internet.\n\n443\n00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:06.160\nThere's a lot of other\ntechnologies that are out there.\n\n444\n00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.120\nIt just depends on your area.\n\n445\n00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:10.320\nYou might find that in your area,\n\n446\n00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.840\na certain type of connection\nis not available.\n\n447\n00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:14.170\nSo for example, the fiber optic stuff.\n\n448\n00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:17.780\nFiber optic connectivity is available here\nat our office, but if I go home, I live,\n\n449\n00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:18.810\nI don't know,\n\n450\n00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:23.775\nseven miles from here, and if I go to my\nhome, I can't get fiber Internet service.\n\n451\n00:22:23.775 --> 00:22:25.095\nIt's not available.\n\n452\n00:22:25.095 --> 00:22:28.105\nSo it's not always available in your\narea and you've got to call around and\n\n453\n00:22:28.105 --> 00:22:29.585\nsee what your options are.\n\n454\n00:22:29.585 --> 00:22:32.005\nThe same thing goes with cable and DSL.\n\n455\n00:22:32.005 --> 00:22:35.457\nWe have another host,\nyou guys have met him, Ronnie Wong.\n\n456\n00:22:35.457 --> 00:22:36.707\nHe lives in the boonies,\n\n457\n00:22:36.707 --> 00:22:39.797\nhe lives out there in the woods and\nhe can't get anything.\n\n458\n00:22:39.797 --> 00:22:41.840\nHe has to use satellite to\nget Internet at his house.\n\n459\n00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.767\nThat's the only thing\nthat'll get out there.\n\n460\n00:22:43.767 --> 00:22:47.108\nSo remember that availability\nis a big deal there.\n\n461\n00:22:47.108 --> 00:22:49.988\nYou're not always gonna have\nall of these options available.\n\n462\n00:22:49.988 --> 00:22:51.708\n>> It is kinda funny\nhow in today's day and\n\n463\n00:22:51.708 --> 00:22:56.568\nage, a lot of our moving decisions\nare based on what type of Internet\n\n464\n00:22:56.568 --> 00:22:59.980\nconnection is available in the area in\nwhich we're thinking about moving to.\n\n465\n00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:00.610\nCuz I'll tell you what,\n\n466\n00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:04.050\nit's a deal breaker if I can't\nhave some high speed cable.\n\n467\n00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:07.510\nHopefully one day that lovely FiOS,\nthat fiber optic coming in.\n\n468\n00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:08.222\nThat'll be nice [LAUGH].\n\n469\n00:23:08.222 --> 00:23:11.350\n>> Yeah, I got spoiled when I lived in\nSeattle, you had everything available.\n\n470\n00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:14.593\nBut different regions,\ndifferent availability, so\n\n471\n00:23:14.593 --> 00:23:16.501\nit definitely impacts things.\n\n472\n00:23:16.501 --> 00:23:17.006\nAll right,\n\n473\n00:23:17.006 --> 00:23:20.260\nnow there are some places that will\ngive you Internet access via wireless.\n\n474\n00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:23.290\nThink about your cell phones,\nwhere you might have LTE or\n\n475\n00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:28.540\n3G type communications on it, and\nyou can gain Internet access that way.\n\n476\n00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:29.940\nAgain, availability is a problem.\n\n477\n00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.670\nYou don't have cell\nphone towers everywhere,\n\n478\n00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:34.610\nand those usually have a data cap on them.\n\n479\n00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:36.340\nSo you want to be careful there.\n\n480\n00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:40.200\nSome connections have a data cap, and\nfor a home user that might be fine.\n\n481\n00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.700\nFor a business, though,\nit oftentimes isn't.\n\n482\n00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.550\nThat's another advantage\nwith a leased line.\n\n483\n00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:47.840\nThe leased lines are more expensive,\nbut there's no bandwidth cap.\n\n484\n00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.070\nIt's your line,\nthat bandwidth is dedicated to you.\n\n485\n00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:52.817\nYou can use all of it 24 hours a day,\n365 days a year.\n\n486\n00:23:52.817 --> 00:23:56.090\nYou can move terabytes of data,\nand it's no big deal.\n\n487\n00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:57.255\nIt's your line and you use it.\n\n488\n00:23:57.255 --> 00:24:00.217\nSo there's pros and\ncons with each of these connections.\n\n489\n00:24:00.217 --> 00:24:02.589\nJust be aware there's\na lot of choice out there.\n\n490\n00:24:02.589 --> 00:24:05.733\n>> Yeah, I remember when\nthe Company Don and I use to work for.\n\n491\n00:24:05.733 --> 00:24:11.520\nWe send a lot of data across states,\nstate lines, and not just one.\n\n492\n00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.210\nA few states over, and\n\n493\n00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:16.910\nit was basically all of our companies\ninformation replicating from\n\n494\n00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:21.050\nour state here in Florida to the home\noffice over in I guess it was Mississippi.\n\n495\n00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:22.700\nThat's tons and tons of data, so\n\n496\n00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:27.320\nwe had to have those dedicated lease\nlines cuz we were using up some data.\n\n497\n00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.220\nThat's for sure.\n\n498\n00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:28.820\n>> Yeah.\n\n499\n00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:30.310\nAnd it can stack up.\n\n500\n00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:35.450\nIf you think about it,\nwatching a movie on Netflix, watching one\n\n501\n00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:40.930\nof our ITProTV episodes, you'll move a gig\nof data just watching an hour of video.\n\n502\n00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:44.500\nAnd sometimes more if you're\ndoing the new 4K stuff,\n\n503\n00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:49.180\nthe Blu-ray type quality, those things,\nthat's a lot of information.\n\n504\n00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:52.410\nOne Blu-ray disk is 40 gigabytes?\n\n505\n00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:53.160\n>> Something like that.\n\n506\n00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.560\n>> So, at 40 gigabytes, that's a lot.\n\n507\n00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:59.390\nAnd remember, they measure your bandwidth\ninternet connections in bits, megabits,\n\n508\n00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:02.210\ngigabits, and it's eight bits to a byte.\n\n509\n00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:05.550\nAnd when I say that\nsomething is 40 gigabytes,\n\n510\n00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:09.110\nyou gotta multiply that by eight\nto find out how many bits it is.\n\n511\n00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:10.570\nSo it's a 120, no.\n\n512\n00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:11.231\nThat's not right.\n\n513\n00:25:11.231 --> 00:25:11.754\nWhat is it again?\n\n514\n00:25:11.754 --> 00:25:12.932\n>> [LAUGH] It's math again.\n\n515\n00:25:12.932 --> 00:25:13.481\nYour Kryptonite.\n>> Yeah, I know.\n\n516\n00:25:13.481 --> 00:25:14.299\n320.\n\n517\n00:25:14.299 --> 00:25:16.220\n[LAUGH]\n>> 320 gigabits.\n\n518\n00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:17.640\nI will figure this out.\n\n519\n00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.500\n320 gigabits, that's a lot.\n\n520\n00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:23.600\nAnd I know on some people,\nare you using Cox communications?\n\n521\n00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:24.676\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right.\n\n522\n00:25:24.676 --> 00:25:25.607\nNot to name any names, but [LAUGH].\n\n523\n00:25:25.607 --> 00:25:26.803\n>> Not to name drop.\n\n524\n00:25:26.803 --> 00:25:32.378\nYeah. [LAUGH] >> So,\nthey actually have this 300 gigabit limit.\n\n525\n00:25:32.378 --> 00:25:33.526\nAnd it doesn't actually limit,\n\n526\n00:25:33.526 --> 00:25:35.577\nthey just send you like a warning\nnotice if you use too much.\n\n527\n00:25:35.577 --> 00:25:37.210\nAnd so\nthat's something you gotta be aware of.\n\n528\n00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:39.960\nIt is easy to kind of push it too far.\n\n529\n00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.925\n>> Oh, I've gotten the emails before, Don.\n\n530\n00:25:41.925 --> 00:25:43.060\n[LAUGH] It does happen.\n\n531\n00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:43.970\n>> Right.\n>> All right Don,\n\n532\n00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:46.130\nis there anything else we\nneed to talk about before.\n\n533\n00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:49.150\nI know we got plenty of more\nnetworking stuff to go over but-\n\n534\n00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:51.060\n>> You know we got just a few minutes.\n\n535\n00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:51.800\nWhy don't we do this?\n\n536\n00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.540\nLet's talk about a little\nbit about wireless.\n\n537\n00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:54.570\n>> Okay.\n>> I mentioned wireless.\n\n538\n00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:58.580\nNow, I said how we're not typically\ngonna use wireless on the WAN, but\n\n539\n00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:01.650\non the LAN side, the Local Area Network\n>> We eat it up.\n\n540\n00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:02.480\n>> We do, right?\n\n541\n00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.400\nMost people do that.\n\n542\n00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.900\nIf you're setting up a network for\nyour home or\n\n543\n00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:09.350\nsmall office, usually you get an internet\nconnection in, that cable or DSL, and\n\n544\n00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:12.890\nyou plug it right into a wireless router\nand that's the last cable you run, right?\n\n545\n00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:17.270\nThe biggest convenience for\na wireless network is not having cables.\n\n546\n00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:21.120\nSo, if you take a house like my house,\nmy house has a little bit of an A-frame\n\n547\n00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.350\nin the middle and I can't run\ncable from one side to the other.\n\n548\n00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:26.060\nI can run cable on one side of the house.\n\n549\n00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:28.850\nOr I can run cable on the other side,\nbut I can't get it to cross in between.\n\n550\n00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:32.370\nSo running a wireless network saves\nme from having to run those cables.\n\n551\n00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:35.920\nThat's a really big kind of shining\npoint for wireless networks.\n\n552\n00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.970\nBut it's not all sunshine and rainbows.\n\n553\n00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:39.750\nWhen we run a wireless network,\n\n554\n00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:43.710\nthere's certain negatives that jump\nin that can kind of offset that.\n\n555\n00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:46.390\nThe biggest network I mentioned\nearlier was reliability, right?\n\n556\n00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:50.590\nIf you have a lot of walls or things or\nreflective surfaces, those can all impact\n\n557\n00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:54.610\nyour wireless communications, and that's\nsomething we've gotta keep an eye out for.\n\n558\n00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:56.920\nBut the other part is security, right?\n\n559\n00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.630\nWhen you're on a wired network, for\nsomebody to intercept your data,\n\n560\n00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:01.950\nthey'd have to plug into\nyour wired network.\n\n561\n00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:05.470\nBut on a wireless network, they can sit\noutside your house, in your driveway, in\n\n562\n00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:09.920\nthe parking lot out of your building, and\nintercept those wireless communications.\n\n563\n00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:13.967\nSo if we decide to deploy a wireless\nnetwork, there's a few decisions that we\n\n564\n00:27:13.967 --> 00:27:17.951\nhave to make and one of the big ones is\ngoing to be what type of wireless network\n\n565\n00:27:17.951 --> 00:27:22.155\nstandard we want to use, and what type of\nsecurity we want to use on the network.\n\n566\n00:27:22.155 --> 00:27:23.605\nNow, Daniel,\ndo you have wireless in your house?\n\n567\n00:27:23.605 --> 00:27:29.205\n>> Yes I do, I have I lovely G-network\nstill, but I'm ready to update to the AC.\n\n568\n00:27:29.205 --> 00:27:30.325\n>> Oh, I remember G.\n\n569\n00:27:30.325 --> 00:27:32.575\n>> Yeah, it's special.\n\n570\n00:27:32.575 --> 00:27:34.205\nNo, I still run G myself.\n\n571\n00:27:34.205 --> 00:27:37.450\nSo, I haven't move up to that one yet,\nor beyond it yet.\n\n572\n00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:41.320\nBut you've got a lot of different options\nas far as which one that you wanna use.\n\n573\n00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:45.740\nAnd, when you choose one,\nthe first thing is that network standard.\n\n574\n00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:48.830\nAnd Microsoft wants you to be\nfamiliar with a handful of these.\n\n575\n00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:51.480\nAnd so, let me pull up a little\nchart that I made before the show.\n\n576\n00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.720\nSo, I've got it right here.\n\n577\n00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:55.540\nIf you go to the store to buy\na wireless router right now,\n\n578\n00:27:55.540 --> 00:28:00.860\nyou're going to see 802.11a,\nb, g, n and ac.\n\n579\n00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:04.406\nAC is not on the exam but\njust so you're aware.\n\n580\n00:28:04.406 --> 00:28:09.150\n802.11g is probably the most affordable\nright now, 802.11n is probably\n\n581\n00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:13.620\nthe fastest that easily affordable,\nAC is still pretty expensive.\n\n582\n00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:16.620\nBut each one is viable,\nyou can still run all of them.\n\n583\n00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:18.290\nBut each one has different pros and cons.\n\n584\n00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:18.900\nAll right?\n\n585\n00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:22.250\nThe first thing they pay attention\nto are the frequencies, right?\n\n586\n00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:27.908\nFive gigahertz standards have\na higher speed but a shorter range.\n\n587\n00:28:27.908 --> 00:28:33.840\nAnd then 2.4 gigahertz frequencies\nhave a lower speed but a larger range.\n\n588\n00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.330\nSo if you wanna get a further distance,\n\n589\n00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:41.090\nif you wanna have better penetration\nthrough walls, 2.4 gigahertz is your guy.\n\n590\n00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:44.480\nBut if you want higher speed,\nfive gigahertz is your guy.\n\n591\n00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:48.160\nBut the further you get from that access\npoint, the weaker your signal gets and\n\n592\n00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.750\nit doesn't go as far.\n\n593\n00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:55.000\nSo notice how like 802.11a is 54 megabit\nand it can go up to 75 feet indoors.\n\n594\n00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.140\nAnd 802.11b is 11 megabit, but\nit can go up to 150 ft indoors.\n\n595\n00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:02.320\nIt goes further because of\nthe lower frequency signal.\n\n596\n00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.110\nThat's a choice we have to make.\n\n597\n00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:07.909\nNow when you start to get into the higher\nstandards like 802.11g, which is what\n\n598\n00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:12.025\nDaniel's running, it's what I'm running at\nhome, notice that it does 54 megabit, and\n\n599\n00:29:12.025 --> 00:29:14.636\nit's five gigahertz, but\nit gets that longer distance.\n\n600\n00:29:14.636 --> 00:29:16.587\nOkay now how does it do that?\n\n601\n00:29:16.587 --> 00:29:22.020\nWell 802.11g actually runs at both 2.4 and\n5 gigahertz.\n\n602\n00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:26.110\nSo, it's backwards compatible with\n802.11b and you can get further and\n\n603\n00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:29.840\nyou can flip between the signals\nto get that greater distance.\n\n604\n00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:33.250\nBut to get the true 54 megabit,\nyou still have to be close.\n\n605\n00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:36.400\nAnd so, you don't really find 802.11a and\nb on sale any more.\n\n606\n00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.800\nRight, they've really kinda\nmoved away from those and\n\n607\n00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.460\nG has kind of become the standard.\n\n608\n00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:42.038\nIt's what you see in the most locations.\n\n609\n00:29:42.038 --> 00:29:48.790\nBut 802.11n, that one's newer,\nand boy is it a jump, right?\n\n610\n00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:50.250\nFrom 54 megabit up to 600 megabit.\n\n611\n00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:53.300\nNow in real life, you're probably\ngonna get closer to 200 megabit.\n\n612\n00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:55.230\nYou're not usually gonna\nget all the way to 600.\n\n613\n00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:57.080\nBut under perfect conditions,\n\n614\n00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.720\nyou can get 600 megabit out of it,\nand really good distance.\n\n615\n00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:04.370\nAnd it is also combining 2.4 and\n5 gigahertz to do that.\n\n616\n00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:08.110\nSo, when we go to look at a standard,\nwhich one of these we wanna pick,\n\n617\n00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:10.330\nusually it's just the fasted\none we can afford, right?\n\n618\n00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:12.720\nYou look at your price point,\nyou get the fastest one you can do,\n\n619\n00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.740\nbut there's other things.\n\n620\n00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:17.983\nFor example, I used to have\na microwave oven that really\n\n621\n00:30:17.983 --> 00:30:22.250\ninterfered with the 2.4 gigahertz network,\nthat spectrum.\n\n622\n00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:23.870\nAnd so I had a choice.\n\n623\n00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:26.510\nEither get a new microwave, or\nwhen I bought wireless equipment,\n\n624\n00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:28.270\nget wireless equipment that\ncould run on five gigahertz.\n\n625\n00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:29.590\nThat's exactly what I did.\n\n626\n00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:33.140\nOr you might have cordless phones,\nor a baby monitor, or\n\n627\n00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:35.690\nsomething like that that interferes,\nso you wanna make sure that you choose\n\n628\n00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:39.880\nthe wireless technology that's right for\nthe equipment that you've got.\n\n629\n00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:42.230\nAnd then you might have\nspeed requirements and so\n\n630\n00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:44.650\nyou need to choose the one\nthat's right for speed.\n\n631\n00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:47.110\nBut after that once you've got it,\n\n632\n00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:49.430\nthere's really not any\ndifference other than the speed.\n\n633\n00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:53.640\nYou just connect and it's all the same\nto you once your connected and working.\n\n634\n00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.110\nSo, pay attention to the speed,\n\n635\n00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:57.840\npay attention to the distance,\nchoose appropriately.\n\n636\n00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:02.660\n>> Now when it comes to wireless, Don,\nthe big topic is the security, right?\n\n637\n00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:07.660\nWe've all heard the horror stories of\nall this encryption's been cracked or\n\n638\n00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:11.860\nsome big entity had a wireless\naccess point open and\n\n639\n00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:15.505\nsomeone got into it, and credit cards\nwere stolen and all sorts of stuff.\n\n640\n00:31:15.505 --> 00:31:17.025\nSo we have to implement the security.\n\n641\n00:31:17.025 --> 00:31:19.325\nThere's a few types of\nsecurity we have available.\n\n642\n00:31:19.325 --> 00:31:20.825\nWhy don't you help us out?\n\n643\n00:31:20.825 --> 00:31:22.245\nRun us through what we have.\n\n644\n00:31:22.245 --> 00:31:24.005\n>> All right, so\nthere's three main types of security.\n\n645\n00:31:24.005 --> 00:31:29.195\nThere's WEP, WPA, and WPA-2, and\nmost wireless networks should be secured.\n\n646\n00:31:29.195 --> 00:31:30.925\nIn fact,\nlet me show you here in Windows 8.\n\n647\n00:31:30.925 --> 00:31:32.305\nSo on my Windows 8 machine,\n\n648\n00:31:32.305 --> 00:31:36.430\nif I wanna connect to a wireless network,\nwhen I pull up my network screen,\n\n649\n00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:39.320\nit's gonna show me my physical\nnetworks and then my Wi-Fi networks.\n\n650\n00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:40.990\nAnd so, I got a couple of\nnetworks listed right here.\n\n651\n00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:43.020\nAnd if I scroll down,\nI got a few at the bottom.\n\n652\n00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:46.050\nAnd see how they have that shield\non them with the exclamation point?\n\n653\n00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:48.504\nThat's telling me these\nare un-encrypted networks.\n\n654\n00:31:48.504 --> 00:31:49.770\nThey're non-secure.\n\n655\n00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:51.290\nIf I connect on that,\n\n656\n00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:56.170\nanybody with a wireless antenna within\n100 feet will be able to intercept that.\n\n657\n00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:58.657\nWell, I've got an exterior\nwall 10 feet behind me.\n\n658\n00:31:58.657 --> 00:32:00.974\nAnd that means somebody could be\nin a car in the parking lot and\n\n659\n00:32:00.974 --> 00:32:02.624\nthey could intercept my communications.\n\n660\n00:32:02.624 --> 00:32:03.425\nThat's bad.\n\n661\n00:32:03.425 --> 00:32:07.638\nSo Windows is warning me not to use\nthese networks because they're not safe.\n\n662\n00:32:07.638 --> 00:32:09.661\nBut if you go to a coffee shop or\nan airport and\n\n663\n00:32:09.661 --> 00:32:13.719\nthey're making public Wi-Fi available,\nthey're going to use unencrypted networks\n\n664\n00:32:13.719 --> 00:32:18.220\nlike that because it's the only way they\ncan allow strangers to connect and use it.\n\n665\n00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:21.460\nBut on your private network, like my\nITProTV network, there's no shield.\n\n666\n00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:24.660\nAnd that actually means that\nI am encrypted, all right.\n\n667\n00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:27.480\nNow the three encryption standards,\nWEP was the original one.\n\n668\n00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:30.130\nIt stands for Wired Equivalent Protocol.\n\n669\n00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:32.610\nIt was supposed to give,\nor, no that's right.\n\n670\n00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:36.310\nIt's supposed to give you the same\nlevel of security as if you were wired.\n\n671\n00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:39.500\nUnfortunately, the encryption was\nbroken within a year of its release.\n\n672\n00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:43.450\nSo this was back in 1999, so\nit's considered completely insecure now.\n\n673\n00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:47.830\nIt takes a hacker about two minutes\nto break in and decrypt your data and\n\n674\n00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:49.030\nit's not safe anymore..\n\n675\n00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:53.330\nSo you shouldn't see WEP on your\nnetwork anymore, all right.\n\n676\n00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:58.218\nWPA, which is WiFi Protected Access\nwas released later on, okay,\n\n677\n00:32:58.218 --> 00:33:02.696\nor wireless protected access and\nWPA has improved security.\n\n678\n00:33:02.696 --> 00:33:07.468\nIt's switched to using a security\nencryption protocol called TKIP that\n\n679\n00:33:07.468 --> 00:33:10.220\ngave you a stronger level of encryption.\n\n680\n00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:14.360\nAnd that was good for a little while,\nbut there was a theoretical paper that\n\n681\n00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:18.900\nwas put out, again within a year, that\nshowed how it was possible to break it.\n\n682\n00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:22.760\nAnd so before it was broken,\nthey released WPA2.\n\n683\n00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:26.564\nAnd so on every modern system that's\nout there, if you're running wireless,\n\n684\n00:33:26.564 --> 00:33:27.995\nyou should be running WPA2.\n\n685\n00:33:27.995 --> 00:33:34.480\nAll right, WPA2 switched to another\nencryption algorithm called AESCCMP.\n\n686\n00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:38.070\nAnd it is a strong encryption\nthat has not yet been broken.\n\n687\n00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:40.260\nAll right?\nThere's some working theories out there,\n\n688\n00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:42.760\nbut nobody's been able to\npractically exploit it yet.\n\n689\n00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:47.680\nSo, WPA-2 is safe, it's secure and\nwhen you configure your wireless access\n\n690\n00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.900\ndevices, you need to make sure\nthat's what they're using.\n\n691\n00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:52.930\nNow, it's not done on the client,\nit's done on the router.\n\n692\n00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:54.620\nRight?\nOr the access point.\n\n693\n00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:58.341\nYou go to the wireless access point or\nwireless router if that's what you have\n\n694\n00:33:58.341 --> 00:34:01.160\nand when it asks you to pick\nyour security, choose WPA2.\n\n695\n00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.540\nThat's the one that's the most secure.\n\n696\n00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:04.040\nThat's the one you want to use.\n\n697\n00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:06.890\n>> You can also connect\ntwo computers together.\n\n698\n00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:10.740\nAnd I think they call it ad hoc, but\nit's really like a peer to peer network.\n\n699\n00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:13.885\n>> Yeah, normally you have an access\npoint, a router that's running wireless or\n\n700\n00:34:13.885 --> 00:34:15.215\na dedicated access point.\n\n701\n00:34:15.215 --> 00:34:17.295\nAnd that's what's called\ninfrastructure mode, right.\n\n702\n00:34:17.295 --> 00:34:19.755\nYour connecting to hardware,\ninfrastructure.\n\n703\n00:34:19.755 --> 00:34:21.785\nBut if I just wanted to share\na file with your laptop,\n\n704\n00:34:21.785 --> 00:34:25.386\nDaniel I could build what's called an ad\nhoc network, just wireless in-between us.\n\n705\n00:34:25.386 --> 00:34:26.260\nand communicate it.\n\n706\n00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:28.830\nAnd when you do an ad\nhoc network like that,\n\n707\n00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:30.930\nit is up to you to choose that standard.\n\n708\n00:34:30.930 --> 00:34:33.650\nAnd so, in Windows, it's got a little\nwizard you can run through for\n\n709\n00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:36.590\nexchanging those files and it will make\nsure that it sets that up for you and\n\n710\n00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:37.340\nyou use the right standard.\n\n711\n00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:41.910\nBut just be aware, when you use wireless,\nyour data is at risk, right?\n\n712\n00:34:41.910 --> 00:34:45.290\nAnd there's other devices out there,\nlike Wi-Fi Bridges.\n\n713\n00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:48.570\nIf you have a device that doesn't support\nwireless, like I might have a printer\n\n714\n00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:50.930\nthat has a physical network jack on it,\nbut no wireless.\n\n715\n00:34:50.930 --> 00:34:53.070\nYou can get a wireless bridge and\nstick it on the back of it,\n\n716\n00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:57.140\nand it'll take its physical network card\nand translate it over to the wireless.\n\n717\n00:34:57.140 --> 00:35:00.270\nSo you can make any device\nwireless if you want.\n\n718\n00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:04.940\nJust be aware of the security risks,\nand make sure you handle that securely.\n\n719\n00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:09.060\nAnd we typically only see those\nwireless networks used on LANs,\n\n720\n00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:12.440\nnot on WANs, because on wide area\nnetworks, it just doesn't have the range.\n\n721\n00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:16.897\nYou can't make a wide are network with an\nantenna that's only going 300 feet, right?\n\n722\n00:35:16.897 --> 00:35:20.240\nThey need the stuff that goes miles,\nlike the cell phone antennas.\n\n723\n00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:23.780\nAnd they do, the LTE networks, the 3G and\n\n724\n00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:28.640\n4G communications, those guys,\nthey can go miles at very high speeds, but\n\n725\n00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:30.700\nthat's not a service that we\ncan set up ourselves right?\n\n726\n00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:34.300\nWe buy that from the cell phone provider\nor whoever and we use that for our access.\n\n727\n00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:37.730\n>> All right, well good stuff on wireless\nhere, obviously if you're gonna implement,\n\n728\n00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:41.880\nthat which you most likely are, make sure\nyou follow the best security practices,\n\n729\n00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:42.830\nuse that WPA2.\n\n730\n00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:46.280\nI know it sounds scary,\noh I don't know which one to use.\n\n731\n00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:49.310\nNow hopefully you should know\nexactly which one to use.\n\n732\n00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:50.700\nIt's not very difficult to set up.\n\n733\n00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:53.760\nYou get into your wireless router and\nyou walk through a wizard.\n\n734\n00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.230\nIt's very, very simple.\n\n735\n00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:58.010\nAll right, Don, is there anything\nelse we need to talk about before we\n\n736\n00:35:58.010 --> 00:35:59.010\nclose the show?\n\n737\n00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:00.910\n>> I think it's a pretty good\nspot to wrap this one up.\n\n738\n00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:03.540\nI do have a little bit more I wanna\ntalk about on network topologies,\n\n739\n00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:05.300\nbut we can hold that for Part 3.\n\n740\n00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:07.090\n>> All right, well part three it is.\n\n741\n00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:08.020\nHopefully we'll see you there.\n\n742\n00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:10.150\nAs for this show,\nwe're gonna go and close it down.\n\n743\n00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:13.260\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n744\n00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:13.870\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n745\n00:36:13.870 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.341 --> 00:00:16.601\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n4\n00:00:16.601 --> 00:00:19.893\nJoining me yet again today is\nmy good friend, Mr. Don Pizet.\n\n5\n00:00:19.893 --> 00:00:20.849\nHow's it going Don?\n\n6\n00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:21.782\n>> It is going great, Daniel.\n\n7\n00:00:21.782 --> 00:00:26.901\nGlad to be back on the show and here to\nwrap up our network infrastructure series.\n\n8\n00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:29.179\nWe've got a little bit to\ntalk about on this one.\n\n9\n00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.870\nWe're gonna start off by talking\nabout network topologies, okay.\n\n10\n00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.350\nAnd when I say network topology what I'm\ntalking about is how your network is\n\n11\n00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.610\nactually laid out.\n\n12\n00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.670\nThink of it as like a roadmap.\n\n13\n00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.055\nWhen you look at a road map,\nyou see all these roads and\n\n14\n00:00:44.055 --> 00:00:45.971\nhow they can get you\nfrom point a to point b.\n\n15\n00:00:45.971 --> 00:00:48.246\nYour network topology is the same thing.\n\n16\n00:00:48.246 --> 00:00:51.960\nNow a lot of us connect to the Internet,\nand when you're plugged in the Internet\n\n17\n00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.080\nthe network topology is insanely complex,\nbut fortunately we don't have to run that.\n\n18\n00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.980\nThat's what Internet service providers do.\n\n19\n00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.800\nSo we just have to worry\nabout our local area network.\n\n20\n00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.180\nNow if you have two or three computers\nit's probably no big deal but\n\n21\n00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.610\nif you've got two or three thousand\ncomputers, your network starts to get\n\n22\n00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.580\nreally complex and understanding\nthat topology is pretty important.\n\n23\n00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.390\nNow over the years network\ntopologies have changed a lot.\n\n24\n00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.300\nSo, if you looked at some of\nthe original networks from the 1970s and\n\n25\n00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.810\n1980s, they are a far cry different\nfrom the networks of today,\n\n26\n00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.440\nand the biggest difference is simply\nhow many computers they can support.\n\n27\n00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.280\nBecause in the 1970s,\nhaving one computer was pretty special.\n\n28\n00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.150\nHaving two computers was unheard of,\nright?\n\n29\n00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.140\nVersus today where you have\na computer in your pocket and\n\n30\n00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.810\na computer on your wrist and a computer\nin your refrigerator and all that.\n\n31\n00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.600\nAnd so people have tons of computers and\n\n32\n00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.290\nthe network has to be designed\nto handle that, right?\n\n33\n00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.770\nSo let's take a look at some of the\ndifferent topologies that we've seen out\n\n34\n00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.850\nthere over the years.\n\n35\n00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.420\nNow, let's go all the way back,\nto like the 1970s.\n\n36\n00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.740\nThe original networks were what\nwere called Bus networks, and\n\n37\n00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.420\nBus networks worked like this.\n\n38\n00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.250\nYou basically had a single cable, and\non that cable it had two little caps on\n\n39\n00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.450\ncalled a terminator, and you would plug\neach of your computers in to that cable.\n\n40\n00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.220\nAnd when computer one sent out a message,\nit would just go down to this cable and\n\n41\n00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.570\ngo across the line.\n\n42\n00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.630\nAs it crossed the line,\neverybody else will hear it.\n\n43\n00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.330\nComputer One might be\ntalking to Computer Four, but\n\n44\n00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.370\nit's actually talking to everybody.\n\n45\n00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.240\nComputer Four just happens to hear it and\ncan then respond.\n\n46\n00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.280\nWhen Computer Four responds,\neverybody hears it, but\n\n47\n00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.750\nit's only destined for Computer One.\n\n48\n00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.480\nYou can start to see the problem here as\nthis network grows and grows and grows.\n\n49\n00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.280\nThe more computers you add,\nthe more people that want to talk and\n\n50\n00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.600\nhere's the problem.\n\n51\n00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.830\nOn a line like this, on a copper line,\nonly one person can talk at a time.\n\n52\n00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.450\nIf two people talk,\nyou get what's called a collision and\n\n53\n00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.070\nthe data just gets damaged and\nthat's that, right?\n\n54\n00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.400\nSo, on a bus based network, you can\nreally only have a handful of computers.\n\n55\n00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.590\nAnd back then, in the 1970s,\nthat was fine, right?\n\n56\n00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.970\nWho was gonna have more than 10 computers\nwas unheard of, and in the 1980s people\n\n57\n00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.760\nstarting to getting more computers and\nit starting to becoming a bigger problem.\n\n58\n00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.850\nAnd so now they starting to\nswitching to other topologies, for\n\n59\n00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.010\nexample ring networks.\n\n60\n00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.440\nIn the 1980s rings were the more common\ntopology, and they look kind of like this.\n\n61\n00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.140\nAnd what you had,\nyou actually had two rings.\n\n62\n00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.758\nYou would run your cables\nbetween your computers and\n\n63\n00:03:22.758 --> 00:03:24.969\nyou would basically form a circle, right?\n\n64\n00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:28.785\nIt didn't actually have to be a circle,\nit could have all been in a line,\n\n65\n00:03:28.785 --> 00:03:32.917\nbut the cable formed a circle, and one\ncomputer would talk and it would send its\n\n66\n00:03:32.917 --> 00:03:36.672\ndata out on the wire and it would go\naround like this until it hit the right\n\n67\n00:03:36.672 --> 00:03:40.968\ncomputer, and the right computer could\ntake that information off the network.\n\n68\n00:03:40.968 --> 00:03:43.869\nAnd you didn't have collisions\nhere because on a ring network\n\n69\n00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:46.992\nyou have this token that was handed\nfrom computer to computer, and\n\n70\n00:03:46.992 --> 00:03:50.537\nit's kinda like this therapy sessions\nwhere they have the talking stick.\n\n71\n00:03:50.537 --> 00:03:54.474\nNot that I would do it, and they say that\nyou can't talk unless you have the talking\n\n72\n00:03:54.474 --> 00:03:57.060\nstick, so here Daniel,\nyou have the talking stick.\n\n73\n00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.156\nTell us your emotions.\n\n74\n00:03:58.156 --> 00:04:03.880\n>> I feel sad inside today because\nI couldn't talk to Don's computer.\n\n75\n00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.711\n[LAUGH]\n>> Because you\n\n76\n00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:05.222\ndidn't have the talking stick.\n\n77\n00:04:05.222 --> 00:04:06.683\n>> Because I didn't\nhave the talking stick.\n\n78\n00:04:06.683 --> 00:04:07.796\nSo, that's how token ring worked.\n\n79\n00:04:07.796 --> 00:04:09.990\nAnd it was good and bad, right?\n\n80\n00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.900\nOn a positive side,\nyou didn't have collisions,\n\n81\n00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.630\non a negative side you had to wait for\nthat stupid token to come around.\n\n82\n00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.460\nAnd it just wasn't terribly fast.\n\n83\n00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.580\nBut it let us have a lot more computers.\n\n84\n00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.100\nSo now, you can have 30,\n40 computers on that ring.\n\n85\n00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.320\nThe only problem is it gets kinda hard to\nrun that cable the form of circle when you\n\n86\n00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.370\nhave 30 computers, and\nif even one computer gets unplugged,\n\n87\n00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.460\nthat ring is now broken and\nit doesn't work out so well.\n\n88\n00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.448\nSo that's kind of a big challenges\nwith the ring based network.\n\n89\n00:04:37.448 --> 00:04:43.008\nSo in our modern networks what we\ntypically have is what's called a star,\n\n90\n00:04:43.008 --> 00:04:45.360\nand a star works like this.\n\n91\n00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.720\nYou have a central device and\nthings plug into it, right?\n\n92\n00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.400\nComputer 1, 2, 3, 4, they're all plugged\ninto this switch in this example.\n\n93\n00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.230\nThe cool part here is,\nif one device loses its connection,\n\n94\n00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.030\nthe others are still connected,\nthey're happy, right?\n\n95\n00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.890\nThey don't care.\n\n96\n00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.790\nSo we don't need a ring anymore.\n\n97\n00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.710\nPeople can be wherever they need to be,\nand we just connect to it, all right?\n\n98\n00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.840\nNow the cool part about this\nis I might have one switch and\n\n99\n00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.750\nthen plug it into another switch, and\nanother switch, and another switch.\n\n100\n00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.160\nAnd the network starts getting bigger and\nbigger and bigger and I have more and\n\n101\n00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.140\nmore hosts.\n\n102\n00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.920\nAnd so\nthis is what most of our networks do.\n\n103\n00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.990\nAnd when we start branching out like that,\nwe end up in what's kind of called\n\n104\n00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.640\na hybrid technology,\nwhere you may have many switches involved.\n\n105\n00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.660\nAnd several computers plugged in each,\nyou might have hundreds or\n\n106\n00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.760\neven thousands of computers,\nand it's now possible.\n\n107\n00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.490\nWhereas bus and ring networks,\n\n108\n00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.460\nthey just really couldn't handle that\nscalability and size, all right.\n\n109\n00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.320\nSo this is all what's\ncalled a physical topology.\n\n110\n00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.180\nThese are how the cables\nare physically run.\n\n111\n00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.450\nNow, if I've got 5 switches and\n\n112\n00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.480\ncomputers are plugged into it,\nhow many switches do our computers see?\n\n113\n00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:51.480\nNone.\n\n114\n00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.320\nYour computers don't even\nknow the switch is there.\n\n115\n00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.270\nIt's basically invisible to the computer.\n\n116\n00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.470\nAnd so when your computer talks,\nthey don't see that physical topology.\n\n117\n00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.710\nThey have what's called\na logical topology.\n\n118\n00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.440\nThe logical topology is that this\ncomputer, and this computer, and\n\n119\n00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.710\nthis computer, this computer, they all\nthink they're on the same network.\n\n120\n00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.600\nAnd if there's a router, and\nthey want to get out to the internet,\n\n121\n00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.730\nthey know they can go through that\nrouter to get out to the internet.\n\n122\n00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.732\nSo they just see one big container.\n\n123\n00:06:16.732 --> 00:06:20.560\nThey don't see all these individual\ncables not this individual pieces.\n\n124\n00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.250\nSo on the logical side,\nthey usually see this as an IP subnet.\n\n125\n00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.430\nRemember one of the earlier shows,\nI had my Windows 8 machine and\n\n126\n00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.800\nI've said I had my 192.168.141 network.\n\n127\n00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.300\nThat's what my computers are.\n\n128\n00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.610\nRight, my computers are on that network.\n\n129\n00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.050\nAnybody not on that network must\nbe on some other network, so\n\n130\n00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.080\nother logical topology than mine, right?\n\n131\n00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.680\nAnd I get there through a router.\n\n132\n00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.760\nBut on the physical side,\nI might be on 192.168.41.\n\n133\n00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.260\nThis guy might be on 192.168.42.\n\n134\n00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.020\nAnd this one might be 192.168.43.\n\n135\n00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.110\nAnd we can't talk to each other.\n\n136\n00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.160\nWe don't see each other logically.\n\n137\n00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.760\nBut physically,\nwe're plugged into the same equipment.\n\n138\n00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.400\nSo remember that you've got a physical\nnetwork and a logical network.\n\n139\n00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.030\nThe logical is what your\ncomputers are actually seeing,\n\n140\n00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.600\nthe physical side can be very different.\n\n141\n00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.610\nSo interesting thing that we need\nto kind of keep in mind there,\n\n142\n00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.590\nthat we do have the physical and\nlogical side.\n\n143\n00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.160\nNetworks today have grown quite a bit,\nthey get really large.\n\n144\n00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.890\nAnd again, they can scale to handle\ntens of thousands of computers even.\n\n145\n00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:22.590\nAnd there's some concerns that we have.\n\n146\n00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.340\nOne of the big concerns we have\nis that on older networks,\n\n147\n00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.280\nyou have a lot of collisions, right?\n\n148\n00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.360\nThese collisions were kind\nof an issue that we had.\n\n149\n00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.790\nIf one computer went\nto send out a message,\n\n150\n00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.370\nremember how I said on a copper line\non one of these network cables only\n\n151\n00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:41.660\none person can talk at a time and if two\npeople talk at once we get a collision.\n\n152\n00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.190\nWell, on a small network when\nyou have four computers or\n\n153\n00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:49.230\nwhatever, if you get a collision,\nwhat happens?\n\n154\n00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:53.640\nWell your data gets corrupted, sure that\nstinks, but then you just resend the data,\n\n155\n00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.610\nit's not that big of a deal, right?\n\n156\n00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.860\nOr what your computer does is it just.\n\n157\n00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.140\nWaits and listens for\nnobody else to talk and then it talks.\n\n158\n00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.980\nWell, if you've only got four people,\nthat's not so hard.\n\n159\n00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.580\nRemember the talking sticks.\n\n160\n00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:05.580\nPass the talking stick around.\n\n161\n00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.610\nThere's only four people.\n\n162\n00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.290\nHow long can it take?\n\n163\n00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:11.020\nBut if there's 400 people,\nit's gonna take a while.\n\n164\n00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.540\nThat talking stick to get\nback around to me, right?\n\n165\n00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:17.810\nAnd I might start to talk at the same\ntime as somebody else starts to talk, and\n\n166\n00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:19.930\nthen we get a collision.\n\n167\n00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:25.130\nSo in modern networks, we have to\nhave something to help us with that.\n\n168\n00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:28.481\nAnd there's two main forms\nof what we have, all right.\n\n169\n00:08:28.481 --> 00:08:32.525\nThe first one is what's called CSMA/CD,\nall right.\n\n170\n00:08:32.525 --> 00:08:33.663\nCSMA.\n\n171\n00:08:33.663 --> 00:08:37.600\nThat's carrier sense multiple access.\n\n172\n00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:42.590\nWhen you plug in to a physical switch,\nyour computer starts doing CSMA,\n\n173\n00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.050\nall right.\n\n174\n00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:47.270\nWhenever it goes to talk, it doesn't.\n\n175\n00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.830\nIt listens first.\n\n176\n00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:52.480\nIt says let me listen on the line and\nsee if somebody else is talking.\n\n177\n00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.660\nSo carrier sense,\nI'm gonna listen to the line.\n\n178\n00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.170\nMultiple access.\n\n179\n00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:00.040\nI'm looking for\nsomebody else accessing the line.\n\n180\n00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.492\nDo I hear somebody talking?\n\n181\n00:09:01.492 --> 00:09:03.258\nIf I do, I wait.\n\n182\n00:09:03.258 --> 00:09:05.200\nAll right,\nyou have what is called standoff.\n\n183\n00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.910\nIt's a random number that's generated that\nsays, I'm gonna wait this amount of time.\n\n184\n00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:12.060\nAnd it's always random because if\npeople waited the same amount of time.\n\n185\n00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.120\nThen you might be waiting in\nline with somebody else, and\n\n186\n00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.050\nyou're kinda synced in time and\nyou'll never talk.\n\n187\n00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:17.450\nSo it's a bit random.\n\n188\n00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:19.570\nBut it just listens and it waits.\n\n189\n00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:22.220\nAnd as soon as it hears the line is empty,\nit says,\n\n190\n00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.840\nwhoa, nobody's talking, then it talks.\n\n191\n00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.180\nAll right, that's CSMA.\n\n192\n00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.910\nOnce you talk though it's not over.\n\n193\n00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:35.040\nWhat if my laptop and Daniel's laptop\nis listening at the same time?\n\n194\n00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.220\nWe both listen and\nwe hear the network is quiet.\n\n195\n00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.710\nSo we both talk at the same time right.\n\n196\n00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.140\nWe send out the communication and\na collision happens.\n\n197\n00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.560\nNow, what is a collision?\n\n198\n00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.250\nWell, I've got ones and zeroes coming\nout of my computer and ones and\n\n199\n00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.100\nzeroes coming out of Daniel's computer.\n\n200\n00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.430\nAnd when the ones and zeroes which are\nreally like positive and negative charges\n\n201\n00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:56.790\non the line when those impact,\nthe charges get all screwed up, right?\n\n202\n00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:00.990\nIt gets all messed and\nthen it comes back to us.\n\n203\n00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:04.240\nAnd so I'm gonna see that mass on\nthe network coming back to me and\n\n204\n00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.620\nI know a collision happen.\n\n205\n00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:08.500\nSo your system can do collision detection.\n\n206\n00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.670\nIt sends and then it listens for\nthe collision.\n\n207\n00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.510\nAnd when it sees it Daniels\nlaptop will see it.\n\n208\n00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:15.980\nMy laptop will see it.\n\n209\n00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:21.910\nWe both generate a random number and I say\nI'm gonna wait nine tenths of a second.\n\n210\n00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:25.432\nAnd his laptop says it's gonna wait\nseven tenths of a second and then retry.\n\n211\n00:10:25.432 --> 00:10:29.485\nAnd because we pick different numbers,\nwhen he retries he doesn't hit me,\n\n212\n00:10:29.485 --> 00:10:31.955\nwhen I retry I don't hit him and\nnow we talk, right.\n\n213\n00:10:31.955 --> 00:10:34.455\nSo that's why we have that random\nstand off that's generated.\n\n214\n00:10:34.455 --> 00:10:38.815\n>> Now Don, when this happens, well\nobviously this is a awesome technology.\n\n215\n00:10:38.815 --> 00:10:40.895\nDetect the collision,\nlets our computers know, and\n\n216\n00:10:40.895 --> 00:10:44.825\nthen they do their little random business,\nthen they're off to the races.\n\n217\n00:10:44.825 --> 00:10:46.175\nBut what happened before that?\n\n218\n00:10:46.175 --> 00:10:48.375\nDid the information just get garbled up,\n\n219\n00:10:48.375 --> 00:10:51.550\nand there was just crazy\nrandom network chatter?\n\n220\n00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:54.090\n>> Yeah, [LAUGH] basically.\n\n221\n00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.900\nSo modern networks run what's\ncalled ethernet, right?\n\n222\n00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.910\nAnd ethernet defines exactly how\na lot of this stuff works and\n\n223\n00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:02.630\nit defines how to use CSMA/CD, right?\n\n224\n00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:06.050\nOn the ring based networks, you didn't\nhave collisions, cause you had to wait for\n\n225\n00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:08.790\nthe token to come around, so you didn't\nneed to listen for the collision.\n\n226\n00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:11.090\nIf you had the token,\nyou were allowed to talk, and\n\n227\n00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:14.346\nif a collision happened that date was\njust lost and that was that, right?\n\n228\n00:11:14.346 --> 00:11:18.040\nOn a bus-bassed network, they were small.\n\n229\n00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.160\nAnd so you would just listen and\ntalk when you had a chance.\n\n230\n00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.890\nAnd, again, you didn't listen for\nthe collisions.\n\n231\n00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.040\nThey can happen.\n\n232\n00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.770\nAnd then the data was just lost, right?\n\n233\n00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:30.710\nSo ethernet introduced this CSMACD, this\nrecovery method, and that's what we had.\n\n234\n00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.500\nThere is some problems with this though,\nright?\n\n235\n00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.480\nThis works great on cabled connections.\n\n236\n00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.220\nIf you have a physical cable plugged\ninto a network, it works wonderfully.\n\n237\n00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.200\nRight?\n\n238\n00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.740\nBut what about a wireless network?\n\n239\n00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.344\nOkay, wireless networks have a little\nbit of a problem, all right.\n\n240\n00:11:43.344 --> 00:11:44.130\nIf you have just one antenna.\n\n241\n00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:48.300\nIf you have one wireless antenna.\n\n242\n00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.770\nA wireless antenna can only send or\nreceive.\n\n243\n00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.400\nIt can't do both at the same time,\nall right.\n\n244\n00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.810\nSo I might send for a second,\nreceive for a second.\n\n245\n00:11:57.810 --> 00:11:59.610\nSend for a second, receive for a second.\n\n246\n00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:02.210\nWell I might just be sending for\nfive seconds, but\n\n247\n00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:04.020\nI can't do both on that one antenna.\n\n248\n00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.280\nSo, in your laptop, in your desktop,\n\n249\n00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.700\nwhatever device it is that you have that's\nwireless, they typically put two antennas,\n\n250\n00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:13.450\ntwo antennas so you can send and\nreceive at the same time, all right.\n\n251\n00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:19.340\nBut, when you're sending, you're\nreceiving antenna actually gets weaker.\n\n252\n00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.910\nThe signal from the send and\nthe receive, it's on the same frequency,\n\n253\n00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:24.030\nthey actually interfere with each other.\n\n254\n00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:28.640\nAnd so your send gets a little\nmore precedence over the receive.\n\n255\n00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:32.220\nAnd as a result, if you're sending on\nthe wireless network at the same time as\n\n256\n00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:36.990\nsomebody else, you can have a collision\nand your receive is not gonna see it.\n\n257\n00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:40.010\nOr if it sees it, it's really faint and\nit might not pick it up, right?\n\n258\n00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:43.090\nSo wireless networks can't\nplay well with CSMACD, so\n\n259\n00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:45.010\ninstead they used something different.\n\n260\n00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:48.610\nThey used what's called CSMA/CA,\nall right?\n\n261\n00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:50.700\nCarrier sense multiple access.\n\n262\n00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.510\nIf they're gonna talk, they listen to\nsee if somebody else is talking, and\n\n263\n00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:54.616\nif nobody's talking, then they send.\n\n264\n00:12:54.616 --> 00:12:58.560\nAnd then collision avoidance.\n\n265\n00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.910\nHow does collision avoidance work?\n\n266\n00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:04.100\nWell, the way it works is,\nbefore you send,\n\n267\n00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:09.370\nyou actually send out a message saying,\nhey everybody, I'm about to talk, right?\n\n268\n00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:13.710\nAnd that way, everybody else knows,\nhey, this guy's about to talk, and so\n\n269\n00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.510\nthey all shut up for\na minute and they let you talk.\n\n270\n00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:19.740\nWe avoid the collision by\ngiving everybody a head's up.\n\n271\n00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:23.360\nNow if we give everybody a heads up and\n\n272\n00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:28.130\nthe heads up, that request to communicate,\nif that's blocked,\n\n273\n00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:32.610\nif that gets a collision, I don't hear\nanything back from the other people.\n\n274\n00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:33.990\nBut if it's successful and\n\n275\n00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:38.720\nit gets through, the other people send me\nwhat's called a clear to send, or CTS.\n\n276\n00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.850\nAnd that clear to send says,\nall right I'm gonna stop talking for\n\n277\n00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:42.670\na minute while you talk.\n\n278\n00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:47.360\nNow this is happening in nanoseconds, this\nis happening super fast on the network, so\n\n279\n00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.300\nI know it sounds slow, but\nit's actually a pretty good system.\n\n280\n00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.280\nAnd that way I don't have to listen for\ncollisions, on a wireless network you\n\n281\n00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.840\ndon't listen for collision because it's\njust RF waves going through the air.\n\n282\n00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:00.200\nYou don't see that screwed up\nelectric signal on a wire,\n\n283\n00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.080\nyou don't see that on the wireless side.\n\n284\n00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.570\nSo CSNACA,\n\n285\n00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:07.490\ncollision avoidance, helps us to just\ndodge the collisions before it happens.\n\n286\n00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:10.550\n>> Kind of reminds me of the token\nsystem to be honest with you.\n\n287\n00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:11.710\nInstead of having the token, and\n\n288\n00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:16.030\nsay I'm the only one that can talk, I\njust say, I'm the only one that can talk.\n\n289\n00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:17.830\nAnd everybody else just goes, yes.\n\n290\n00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:19.360\nApparently you are the only\none who can talk.\n\n291\n00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.489\nI will settle down.\n\n292\n00:14:20.489 --> 00:14:23.530\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's a little more like requesting it.\n\n293\n00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.820\nCan I please have the talking stick?\n\n294\n00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.890\nBut you had to talk to say that, right.\n\n295\n00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:30.590\nGotta be nice,\ncan I please have the talking stick?\n\n296\n00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:34.610\nThey can say no, I'm busy talking,\nshut up about your talking stick.\n\n297\n00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:35.610\nThey can say that, right.\n\n298\n00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:38.260\nBut if you don't have it, you're not\ngonna talk, you kind of request it.\n\n299\n00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.300\nThe cool part here over a ring\nis you can go out of order.\n\n300\n00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.880\nIn a ring, you have to go in order.\n\n301\n00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.830\nIf you're computer five, and\nyou just handed off the toke.\n\n302\n00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:50.200\nIt's gotta go to computers one two three\nand four before it comes back to you.\n\n303\n00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:54.840\nBut with CSNCA, you can be computer five,\ncomputer four could be talking,\n\n304\n00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.020\nor computer one could be talking,\n\n305\n00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.600\nand you could just immediately\nrequest from there and it would jump.\n\n306\n00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.590\nSo it can go out of order, and\nthat makes it pretty efficient.\n\n307\n00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:02.990\nNow you might ask yourself if that's so\nefficient,\n\n308\n00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:04.980\nwhy don't we use that on\nthe wired networks now?\n\n309\n00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:09.000\nAnd the reason is that most wired\nnetworks use switches instead of hubs.\n\n310\n00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.340\nIn the old days, when you used hubs,\ncollisions were a big deal.\n\n311\n00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:13.640\nYou could collide all the time.\n\n312\n00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.390\nWhen you talked on a port,\neverybody else saw it.\n\n313\n00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:18.030\nBut on a switch, when you go to talk,\n\n314\n00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.700\nyou actually don't talk to\nthe whole network any more.\n\n315\n00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.280\nYou talk to the switch.\n\n316\n00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.030\nAnd the switch has a little bit of\nmemory available for each port and\n\n317\n00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:27.130\nit's receiving your communication and\nstoring it there.\n\n318\n00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:29.390\nAnd the switch thing goes to transmit it.\n\n319\n00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:32.430\nSo the switch can have collisions but\nyou can't.\n\n320\n00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.200\nSo, if your laptop or\nyour desktop is plugged into a switch,\n\n321\n00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:39.710\nunless something goes horribly wrong,\nhardware failure, then you're not gonna\n\n322\n00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.480\nhave collisions plugged into a switch,\nbut the switch itself might.\n\n323\n00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.730\nAnd so the switch is dealing\nwith all that forest.\n\n324\n00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:48.660\nAnd so that's why we don't switch\nto CMSACA on a wired network and\n\n325\n00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.340\nwe stay with CMSACD.\n\n326\n00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:53.200\nBecause the collisions just\ndon't happen anymore, right.\n\n327\n00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.530\nBut on a wireless network they do.\n\n328\n00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:56.711\nAnd so they have to have\na different technology for that.\n\n329\n00:15:56.711 --> 00:15:57.789\n>> Very, very cool stuff.\n\n330\n00:15:57.789 --> 00:16:00.840\nNow, I love switch networks,\nI love wired networks.\n\n331\n00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:04.870\nAnd I'm glad we get to take advantage of\nall the technologies that they give us.\n\n332\n00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:06.900\nTo make sure that those\nthings run efficiently.\n\n333\n00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.580\nNow, Don, is there anything\nelse that we need to go over?\n\n334\n00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:09.940\n>> I think that's really it.\n\n335\n00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:13.950\nNow all of these topics we've covered kind\nof in brief, right, because we're doing\n\n336\n00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:18.380\nthe MTA, the introductory level, but\nthere's a lot more on all of these.\n\n337\n00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:22.270\nAnd for those of you that are moving\non to the MCSA certification or\n\n338\n00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:25.100\nthe CompTIA Network Plus certification,\nthose guys.\n\n339\n00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.965\nWe dive way more in\ndepth into all of these.\n\n340\n00:16:27.965 --> 00:16:30.620\nB/ut for the MTA they want to make\nsure that you've got that foundational\n\n341\n00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.400\nknowledge, that base information.\n\n342\n00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.960\nThat's what we've seen here right?\n\n343\n00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:37.280\nThe kind of quick and\ndirty view of this information and\n\n344\n00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.730\nhow these technologies work and\nhow they impact you in the workplace.\n\n345\n00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:42.104\n>> Awesome.\nWell, thank you so much, Don, for\n\n346\n00:16:42.104 --> 00:16:43.127\nshowing us how all that works.\n\n347\n00:16:43.127 --> 00:16:46.128\nIt's always interesting to hear it,\neven though we kinda know it,\n\n348\n00:16:46.128 --> 00:16:47.718\nget someone else's perspective.\n\n349\n00:16:47.718 --> 00:16:50.315\nAnd you guys, who may have\nnever heard this stuff before,\n\n350\n00:16:50.315 --> 00:16:52.120\nwatch this episode over and over again.\n\n351\n00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:56.640\nLearning those topologies, learning how\nyou can use the different collision\n\n352\n00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.460\ndetection and avoidance, and where that is\nimplemented, that will actually help you\n\n353\n00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:05.750\nout in your practical life as an admin or\nsomebody that's
