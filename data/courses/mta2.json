great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.770\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.380\nJoining me in the studio today\nis none other than Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.380\nHow's it going today, Mike?\n\n7\n00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.770\n>> Oh, it's going great,\nDaniel, I'm excited to be here.\n\n8\n00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.450\nWe got more of our MTA\ncontent coming your way.\n\n9\n00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.440\nAnd this one, our security fundamentals.\n\n10\n00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.470\nSo we're gonna be focusing on Security.\n\n11\n00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.200\nA great field to get into.\n\n12\n00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.370\nHopefully, a lot of you are intrigued and\n\n13\n00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.940\nmaybe want to get into\nthe world of security.\n\n14\n00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.530\nThis is a great place to start.\n\n15\n00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.460\nIn this episode,\n\n16\n00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.260\nDaniel, we're gonna be focusing in\non those core security principles.\n\n17\n00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.390\nSome fundamental knowledge and terminology\nwe really need to be familiar with.\n\n18\n00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.670\n>> That's right, and whether you're\ngonna be in security as a career or not,\n\n19\n00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.910\nyou do need to understand a nice\nfoundational knowledge of security itself,\n\n20\n00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.320\nbecause it impacts everyone.\n\n21\n00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.770\nYou go to any company anywhere, and you'll\nrealize that even down to the secretaries\n\n22\n00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.370\nor the people in HR, the people in\nresearch, it doesn't matter where you sit.\n\n23\n00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.920\nYou gotta know a little something\nabout security cuz we're all kind of\n\n24\n00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.660\ninvolved in that.\n\n25\n00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.520\nIf I'm giving out my password to\neverybody and their brother, well,\n\n26\n00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.360\nI'm not being very secure and\nthat's not a good practice.\n\n27\n00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.690\nSo today, Mike, you're gonna help us out,\nsort of help fill in that gap,\n\n28\n00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.500\ngive us that foundational knowledge so\nthat we understand security,\n\n29\n00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.090\nwhat we need to know, and especially\nif you do want to get in security\n\n30\n00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.260\nthis is definitely the stuff\nyou gotta know, right?\n\n31\n00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.240\n>> It is, it is.\n\n32\n00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.180\nAnd it's exciting stuff, so\nwhy wouldn't you wanna get into this?\n\n33\n00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.900\nAll right, so let's start with\nsome basic terminology and\n\n34\n00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.930\na very core concept when it comes to\nsecurity, and that is the CIA triad.\n\n35\n00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.470\nIt doesn't matter where you go,\nwhat webpage you visit,\n\n36\n00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.090\nwhat book you read, you're gonna\nsee this term, CIA or CIA triad,\n\n37\n00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.760\nand we're not talking about the Central\nIntelligence Agency here in the US.\n\n38\n00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.122\n>> Which is Triads.\n\n39\n00:01:55.122 --> 00:01:57.109\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Or more than Triads.\n\n40\n00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.929\n>> That's right.\n\n41\n00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:59.560\n[LAUGH]\n>> We're going to some sort of\n\n42\n00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.902\nsecret court, aren't we, Mike?\n\n43\n00:02:00.902 --> 00:02:02.956\n>> [LAUGH] We are in trouble, aren't we?\n\n44\n00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:08.940\nAll right, but CIA means confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability.\n\n45\n00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.680\nThese are the three core security\nprinciples that we have to follow.\n\n46\n00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.560\nThey really make the foundation\nof our security,\n\n47\n00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.450\nyou can think of them as legs on a tripod.\n\n48\n00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.830\nWithout one of them the whole\nthing is gonna fall over.\n\n49\n00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.470\nSo confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability.\n\n50\n00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.960\nWhen we're trying to secure a system,\n\n51\n00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.250\nwhen we're trying to secure a network,\nwhatever it is.\n\n52\n00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.870\nThese are what we have to keep in mind.\n\n53\n00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.087\nThis is what we're trying to provide for\nmy systems and my network.\n\n54\n00:02:36.087 --> 00:02:39.140\nConfidentiality, integrity,\nand availability.\n\n55\n00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.780\nAnd let's start with the first one,\nconfidentiality, right?\n\n56\n00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.550\nConfidentiality simply means\n\n57\n00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.790\nonly authorized people should\nhave access to that information.\n\n58\n00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:50.340\nRight?\n\n59\n00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.030\nIf it's something confidential between\nyou and your doctor then only you and\n\n60\n00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.160\nyour doctor should have access\nto the information, right?\n\n61\n00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.070\nThe janitor that comes and\n\n62\n00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.160\ncleans the place shouldn't have\naccess to the information.\n\n63\n00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.051\nThe guy that's coming\nin to fix the phones or\n\n64\n00:03:04.051 --> 00:03:07.186\ncoming in to fix the network shouldn't\nhave access to the information.\n\n65\n00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:08.600\nIt's confidential.\n\n66\n00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.200\nYou might have information\nat a workplace where\n\n67\n00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.360\nall of the employees have access to it,\nit's our employee handbook.\n\n68\n00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.870\nRight?\n\n69\n00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.640\nBut nobody outside the organization\nshould have access to that information.\n\n70\n00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.600\nSo it's confidential.\n\n71\n00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.560\nSo when you think of confidential,\ndon't think super secret.\n\n72\n00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.390\nThat's not necessarily the case.\n\n73\n00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.940\nBut there is some level of\ncontrol that I wanna provide.\n\n74\n00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.350\nNot everybody should have access to it.\n\n75\n00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.810\nThere is information that's available to\nthe public and that anybody can have,\n\n76\n00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.210\nright, like my website information\nthat the public can come to.\n\n77\n00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.560\nWell, that's not confidential.\n\n78\n00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.040\nThere's no level of confidentiality there.\n\n79\n00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.050\nBut on most of our documents we're gonna\nprovide some level of confidentiality.\n\n80\n00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.670\nNow how do we do that?\n\n81\n00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.550\nWell, we got several different methods\nwe can use to provide confidentiality.\n\n82\n00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.020\nThe one we always think of I think that\npops in everybodys mind is gonna be\n\n83\n00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.230\nEncryption, because encryption\nis a good way to make sure\n\n84\n00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.880\nthat only authorized users or\npeople have access to that information.\n\n85\n00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.710\nNow Windows gives us a method\nwe can use to encrypt it.\n\n86\n00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.300\nPart of the NTFS file system is EFS, or\n\n87\n00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.920\nmy encrypting file system and\nlet's take a look at how that works.\n\n88\n00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.520\nI've got a Windows 7 box pulled up here,\nI'm gonna open up file explorer, and\n\n89\n00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.920\nI'm gonna navigate my way into the hard\ndrive and in this docs folder and\n\n90\n00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.555\nhere a file called Mike's stuff.\n\n91\n00:04:24.555 --> 00:04:25.935\nRight?\nThis is my stuff,\n\n92\n00:04:25.935 --> 00:04:30.615\nI don't want anybody else to be\nable to access this information.\n\n93\n00:04:30.615 --> 00:04:31.315\nSo, what do I do?\n\n94\n00:04:31.315 --> 00:04:35.755\nWell, I can right click on it,\nand I can pull up the properties.\n\n95\n00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.561\nI can go over to the Advanced Attributes,\nand\n\n96\n00:04:40.561 --> 00:04:44.510\nI can choose to encrypt\ncontents to secure data.\n\n97\n00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.728\nI'll click OK, and I'll click OK.\n\n98\n00:04:47.728 --> 00:04:53.200\nAnd I'm gonna do the file only, click OK,\nand notice the file name turned green.\n\n99\n00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.390\nThis is Windows's visual cue that\nthis file has been encrypted.\n\n100\n00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.850\nNow, to me, because I'm the one that\nencrypted it, I'm an authorized user.\n\n101\n00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.380\nSo I can double-click on it,\nI can open it, I can type in there.\n\n102\n00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:13.000\nAnd I can make changes to it,\nI can save it, I can close it.\n\n103\n00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.270\nI don't have to do anything.\n\n104\n00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.120\nTo me, the document didn't seem encrypted,\nright?\n\n105\n00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.380\nI double click on it like normal,\nit just opens right up.\n\n106\n00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.420\nWell let's see what happens if\nwe try that with somebody else.\n\n107\n00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.520\nAnd we'll log off.\n\n108\n00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.430\nAnd I'm gonna log back on as a different\nuser, a little switch user, other user.\n\n109\n00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.440\nAnd, Daniel, if you can just give\nme your password real quick?\n\n110\n00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.180\n>> Oh yeah, it's not gonna happen.\n\n111\n00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.380\n>> Not.\n\n112\n00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.395\n>> Yeah, oh crap.\n\n113\n00:05:43.395 --> 00:05:44.640\n[LAUGH]\n>> Gonna, happen.\n\n114\n00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.625\nLet's see if that worked.\n\n115\n00:05:45.625 --> 00:05:47.836\n>> [LAUGH] Outlook did not work.\n\n116\n00:05:47.836 --> 00:05:49.870\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n117\n00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.580\nnow I'm logged on as Daniel.\n\n118\n00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:58.280\nI open up File Explorer, I navigate into\nthat same location, and there's my stuff.\n\n119\n00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.120\nI can see it's green,\n\n120\n00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.390\nI can see the file, I double click on it,\nI get the old, access is denied.\n\n121\n00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.900\nSo there's an example of how\nencryption can provide us\n\n122\n00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.650\nwith a level of confidentiality.\n\n123\n00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.970\nIf you're not authorized to get in that\ndocument, you're not gonna get it.\n\n124\n00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.512\n>> And Mike, even if somehow I\ndid grab a copy of this document,\n\n125\n00:06:16.512 --> 00:06:19.228\nits not gonna show me\nthe information inside.\n\n126\n00:06:19.228 --> 00:06:21.860\nIts just gonna be a bunch of\ngarbage as far I'm concerned.\n\n127\n00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.410\n>> Absolutely.\n\n128\n00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.360\nIn fact, you're gonna have a hard time\ngetting it because this particular\n\n129\n00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.750\nencryption is a part of the file system.\n\n130\n00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.280\nSo let's say Daniel wanted to copy\nthat over to a thumb drive and\n\n131\n00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.480\ntake it with him and try to break into it.\n\n132\n00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.950\nWell that thumb drive unless it's formated\nin DFS,and even if it is, he didn't have\n\n133\n00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.220\npermission to decrypt it, it's got to be\ndecrypted, sent across the network, and\n\n134\n00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.430\nthen encrypted again on the file system,\nhe won't even be able to copy that\n\n135\n00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.390\nfile over to another volume or\na thumb drive or anything like that.\n\n136\n00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.950\nSo it really does give us that\nlevel of confidentiality,\n\n137\n00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.190\nwhich is a big part in security.\n\n138\n00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.860\nYou're gonna see encryption in just about\n\n139\n00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.940\nevery place you go to because it is a easy\nway to provide that confidentiality.\n\n140\n00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.520\nNow, we get into advanced security classes\nwe're gonna learn that we've got to be\n\n141\n00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.390\ncareful with that because\nthe way encryption works,\n\n142\n00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:12.740\nit uses keys along with mathematical\nformulas to encrypt that information.\n\n143\n00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.950\nThe problem is,\n\n144\n00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.310\nif I ever lose those keys not even I would\nbe able to get back in to that document.\n\n145\n00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.470\nSo there are methods that we've got\nto take place to ensure that we don't\n\n146\n00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.060\npermanently lose access\nto that information, but\n\n147\n00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.600\nthat's in a next level\nof security classes.\n\n148\n00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.640\nSo we've got encryption.\n\n149\n00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.230\nThat's a very common way to\nprovide that confidentiality.\n\n150\n00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.870\nLike I said, it's the one that I\nthink everybody thinks of when they\n\n151\n00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.290\nfirst think of confidentiality,\nbut it's not the only method.\n\n152\n00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.107\nOther methods would\ninclude authentication.\n\n153\n00:07:40.107 --> 00:07:40.790\nRight?\n\n154\n00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.770\nIf you can't log onto the system,\n\n155\n00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.993\nthen you're not gonna get\naccess to that information.\n\n156\n00:07:45.993 --> 00:07:51.459\nSo using a good strong authentication\nmethod is a big part in confidentiality.\n\n157\n00:07:51.459 --> 00:07:52.018\nRight.\n\n158\n00:07:52.018 --> 00:07:57.319\nIn Windows for example, we have password\npolicies that make sure I can enforce\n\n159\n00:07:57.319 --> 00:08:02.321\nthe types of passwords, how often I\nhave to change it, things like that.\n\n160\n00:08:02.321 --> 00:08:04.950\nIn fact, let's take a peek at it.\n\n161\n00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.697\nIf I come over here to\nmy domain controller,\n\n162\n00:08:07.697 --> 00:08:10.830\nI can open up my group\npolicy management console.\n\n163\n00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:17.780\nPull up my Default Domain Policy,\nexpand out Policies, Windows Settings,\n\n164\n00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:23.930\nSecurity Settings, Account Policies,\nand there is my Password Policy.\n\n165\n00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.480\nAnd in a domain environment by default\n\n166\n00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.280\nthey're doing things like you have to\nchange your password every 42 days.\n\n167\n00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.580\nI'll remember the last 24\npasswords that you've used, so\n\n168\n00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.450\nyou can't reuse the same password over and\nover again.\n\n169\n00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:39.020\nIt has to be at least\nseven characters long.\n\n170\n00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.220\nHas to meet complexity requirements,\nmeaning it has to be\n\n171\n00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:46.670\nmade up of a combination of characters,\nnot just letters, not just numbers.\n\n172\n00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:50.540\nSo these are things that I can do\nto make sure we're using a good,\n\n173\n00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.350\nstrong authentication method.\n\n174\n00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:53.580\nNot the only place.\n\n175\n00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.120\nIf you have a website, right?\n\n176\n00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.710\nA lot of websites if you want\nsomebody log into that website,\n\n177\n00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:00.230\nhow are you going to authenticate that?\n\n178\n00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:04.200\nYou could do very simple forms based\nauthentication, or we could go much\n\n179\n00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.760\nmore complex with like active directive\nfederation services, and things like that.\n\n180\n00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:13.870\nBut we want to make sure that we are using\nsome good strong authentication method.\n\n181\n00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.540\nOtherwise, somebody could\nattempt at guess passwords,\n\n182\n00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:19.190\nor try to break that authentication, and\n\n183\n00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.990\nget access to information that\nthey should not have access to.\n\n184\n00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:28.150\nAnother method we can use to provide\nconfidentiality is going to be\n\n185\n00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:32.920\naccess control, and\naccess control is using, in Windows,\n\n186\n00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.200\nthat's going be access control list,\npart of my NTFS file system.\n\n187\n00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.270\nNow let me go back over here, for\nexample, and take a look at a document.\n\n188\n00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.760\nI'm still logged in as Daniel.\n\n189\n00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.540\nSo let's see if Daniel's\ngoing to have permissions.\n\n190\n00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:46.340\nHe's not.\n\n191\n00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:47.910\nI just know he's not.\n\n192\n00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.170\nI didn't give Daniel any permissions.\n\n193\n00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:51.070\nI don't trust the guy.\n\n194\n00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:52.425\n>> He's a shady character that Daniel.\n\n195\n00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:55.288\n[LAUGH]\n>> He is a little bit shady.\n\n196\n00:09:55.288 --> 00:09:58.847\nSo I'm going to do a little switch user,\nother user, and\n\n197\n00:09:58.847 --> 00:10:01.006\nlog back on as the administrator.\n\n198\n00:10:04.356 --> 00:10:06.410\nSo I will have permissions\nto show you this.\n\n199\n00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.760\nAnd once you get logged in,\nI'm going to open up File Explorer.\n\n200\n00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:12.340\nAnd again, access control,\nas far as the confidentiality goes,\n\n201\n00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.630\nis preventing people to be\nable to access the resource.\n\n202\n00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.980\nIf you can't access the resource, then\nyou can't see the information inside it.\n\n203\n00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:23.220\nSo I am providing a level\nof confidentiality.\n\n204\n00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:28.930\nIf I go take a look back over here,\nat that folder.\n\n205\n00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:30.150\nHere's my handbook.\n\n206\n00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.650\nOops.\n\n207\n00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:38.200\nAnd if I pull up the properties for\nthis handbook, I go to that Security tab,\n\n208\n00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:45.620\nI'll see that the hosts have read\nusers have read and execute.\n\n209\n00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:48.390\nLet's say this was just for\nhosts all right, and\n\n210\n00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:51.100\nthey didn't want anybody\nelse being able to see it.\n\n211\n00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.590\nWell, I could remove users.\n\n212\n00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:55.560\nI'll click edit,\nI'll grab those users, and\n\n213\n00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.160\nI'll remove their permissions and\nI'll apply that change.\n\n214\n00:10:59.160 --> 00:10:59.820\nRight.\n\n215\n00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:05.900\nSo, by using that access control list,\nI am in control of who has access in\n\n216\n00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:10.780\nthe first place and what level of access\nthey have, whether they can just read, or\n\n217\n00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:16.380\nread and write, or modify, or\nfull control or whatever the case may be.\n\n218\n00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:20.150\nSo three different ways I can really\nprovide for that confidentiality,\n\n219\n00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:25.690\nencryption, I can use access control\nlists, and I can do authentication.\n\n220\n00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:27.350\nAll three provide that confidentiality.\n\n221\n00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:32.520\nAll right, next thing on our CA triad,\nthat is integrity.\n\n222\n00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.530\nAnd integrity means when it\ncomes to your computers and\n\n223\n00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:39.000\nkeeping our information secure,\nwe talked about integrity,\n\n224\n00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.663\nwe're talking about the ability to prevent\nunauthorized changes to information.\n\n225\n00:11:43.663 --> 00:11:50.150\nI need to make sure that this document\ndoes not get modified unintentionally.\n\n226\n00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:54.400\nIntentional changes, if you're supposed\nto be able to make changes, that's okay.\n\n227\n00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.160\nWhat I don't want is somebody accidentally\nmaking a change to that document,\n\n228\n00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.570\nthey didn't realize it,\nthey backed up over a paragraph or two and\n\n229\n00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:05.220\nthen closed it and said save or\ndon't, and they just hit save.\n\n230\n00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:08.620\nOops, I just wiped out half\nmy employee handbook, right?\n\n231\n00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.300\nOr malicious changes.\n\n232\n00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.700\nBad guys trying to get\ninto your system and\n\n233\n00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.390\nmake changes to some of your documents or\nyour information there.\n\n234\n00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:21.360\nSo integrity, the ability to\nmake sure that we can tell or\n\n235\n00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.180\nprevent unauthorized\nchanges to our resources.\n\n236\n00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:29.470\n>> Now Mike, our access control list\nkind of does that for us as well, right?\n\n237\n00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:31.200\nSo it kind of works on two levels.\n\n238\n00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.210\n>> It really does, right?\n\n239\n00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:36.230\nIf you can't get access to the resource\nthen you can't make changes to it.\n\n240\n00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.640\nSo you see how it's\nproviding confidentiality,\n\n241\n00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.230\nyou can't get access to it.\n\n242\n00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:43.450\nIt's also providing integrity,\nyou can't get access to it so\n\n243\n00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.980\nyou can't make changes to the information.\n\n244\n00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:48.110\nSo you're absolutely right Daniel.\n\n245\n00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:51.080\nThe access control Is our first step in\n\n246\n00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.800\ncontrolling that integrity of those\ndocuments or those resources.\n\n247\n00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:58.640\nAnother method we're going to\nuse to provide that integrity\n\n248\n00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.850\nis something known as hashing,\nor hashing algorithms.\n\n249\n00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:03.780\nAnd let's take a look.\n\n250\n00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.140\nI've got a little drawing here.\n\n251\n00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:10.951\nA hashing algorithm is simply\na mathematical formula that I'm\n\n252\n00:13:10.951 --> 00:13:15.110\ngoing to kind of feed\nthe information through.\n\n253\n00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:17.860\nThat mathematical formula is\ngoing to do it's calculation,\n\n254\n00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:23.040\nand it's going to spit out\nwhat's known as a hash value, or\n\n255\n00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:27.990\na check sum, several different names\nthey might apply to that output.\n\n256\n00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:29.960\nI'm going to call it a hash value.\n\n257\n00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:34.930\nWhat's really cool, here's an example,\nMD5 is one example of a hashing algorithm.\n\n258\n00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:35.730\nThere's several.\n\n259\n00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:41.800\nThere's SHA, ripe MD, there's\nseveral other algorithms we can use.\n\n260\n00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.045\nMessage digest is another one\nI should probably mention,\n\n261\n00:13:44.045 --> 00:13:46.510\nbecause you'll see that in\na lot of books you read.\n\n262\n00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:50.180\nMD or message digest is\nthe same thing as a hash value.\n\n263\n00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:55.930\nThe output of this hashing algorithm,\nright, MD5 being one example.\n\n264\n00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:59.980\nAnd there's an example of the output that\nyou might get, so you might take this\n\n265\n00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:05.090\nreport that you generated, and you want\nto make sure that no changes occur to it.\n\n266\n00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:07.740\nWell, you feed it through\nthe MD5 algorithm.\n\n267\n00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.990\nIt spits out this value.\n\n268\n00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:12.520\nNow this won't prevent changes to it.\n\n269\n00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.080\nSomebody could change it.\n\n270\n00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.870\nBut if they do, and you take that document\nand you feed it back through that exact\n\n271\n00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:21.270\nsame algorithm, you're going to\nget a completely different result.\n\n272\n00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:26.410\nIf no changes have been made, that output\nwill be the same every single time.\n\n273\n00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:30.310\n>> So this is a good way for us to\nverify that the integrity of the file\n\n274\n00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:33.230\nis what we expect it to be and\nit has not been changed.\n\n275\n00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:34.210\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n276\n00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:36.500\nSo it's not going to keep\nthem from making changes, but\n\n277\n00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:40.850\nit is going to allow us to detect changes,\nand sometimes that's just as important.\n\n278\n00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:44.920\nI need to know if there's been any\nmodifications to those resources, or\n\n279\n00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:45.930\nthose files.\n\n280\n00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:49.540\nLet me give an example here,\nI've got an online hash calculator,\n\n281\n00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.540\nTools4noobs out here gives us this.\n\n282\n00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:55.980\nAnd I've simply typed in some text, I'm\ngoing to choose my algorithm, I'll do md5.\n\n283\n00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:02.600\nAnd I'll click hash this, and\nit spits out this hash value, alright?\n\n284\n00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.620\nNow, if I do this again,\n\n285\n00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:09.945\nI'll click hash notice this starts\nwith nine echo 107 delta, hash this.\n\n286\n00:15:09.945 --> 00:15:13.510\nNine echo 107 delta, right?\n\n287\n00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:14.970\nSo nothing's change.\n\n288\n00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:17.520\nI could hash it over and over again, and\n\n289\n00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.710\nit's going to be the same\nthing every time.\n\n290\n00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:23.970\nIf I make one change to this, I'm simply\ngoing to put a period in there and\n\n291\n00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:24.640\nclick hash this.\n\n292\n00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:30.140\nNo more nine or whatever\n>> Echo 107 delta.\n\n293\n00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.130\n>> Thank you, 107 delta, right?\n\n294\n00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:33.670\nCompletely different value.\n\n295\n00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:34.780\nOne period.\n\n296\n00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.310\nI got a value that\ndoesn't even look close.\n\n297\n00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:39.720\nAll we did was look at\nthe first five characters.\n\n298\n00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.257\nAnd those have changed, right?\n\n299\n00:15:41.257 --> 00:15:44.237\nSo this is the power\nof hashing algorithms,\n\n300\n00:15:44.237 --> 00:15:46.739\nis being able to detect that change.\n\n301\n00:15:46.739 --> 00:15:50.957\nAnd I don't care if you take\nthe entire Encyclopedia Britannica And\n\n302\n00:15:50.957 --> 00:15:53.548\nfeed it through that hashing algorithm.\n\n303\n00:15:53.548 --> 00:15:55.027\nGonna take you a little while, but\n\n304\n00:15:55.027 --> 00:15:58.050\nin the end you're gonna get a value\nthat looks just like this, right?\n\n305\n00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:00.480\nIt's gonna be the same length value.\n\n306\n00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.540\nYou could put one little comma,\n\n307\n00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:07.260\nor change one letter,\nanywhere in that entire encyclopedia.\n\n308\n00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.480\nFeed it through this\nhashing algorithm again,\n\n309\n00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.895\nit's gonna come up with a different value.\n\n310\n00:16:10.895 --> 00:16:13.980\nYes, it's gonna take it a long\ntime to run through there, but\n\n311\n00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.820\nyou'll be able to detect that change.\n\n312\n00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.910\nOur operating system uses this\nto keep our computer safe.\n\n313\n00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:23.240\nAll of our system files get run\nthrough a hash algorithm, and\n\n314\n00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.450\nit keeps a little table of all the values,\nthe outputs.\n\n315\n00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:30.160\nSo every time it starts up,\nit runs all those files through there,\n\n316\n00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.800\ncompares those values.\n\n317\n00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.280\nIf they haven't changed, everything is\ngood, and we go right back on there.\n\n318\n00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.460\nWe log into our system and\neverything is fine.\n\n319\n00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:40.004\nIf one of those systems\nfiles has been modified,\n\n320\n00:16:40.004 --> 00:16:42.486\nif one of those values\ndoesn't match anymore,\n\n321\n00:16:42.486 --> 00:16:46.660\nthe system now knows that somebody\npossibly made some unintentional changes.\n\n322\n00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.546\nSomething's definitely changed, but\n\n323\n00:16:48.546 --> 00:16:51.099\nit could have been possibly\nan unintentional change,\n\n324\n00:16:51.099 --> 00:16:54.880\nlike somebody trying to replace a system\nfoul so they can get access to my system.\n\n325\n00:16:55.930 --> 00:17:02.227\nSo hashing, probably the most common way\nto validate, or to provide that integrity.\n\n326\n00:17:02.227 --> 00:17:03.805\nTCP/IP packets, right?\n\n327\n00:17:03.805 --> 00:17:06.353\nEvery time they get to the other end,\nbefore they leave,\n\n328\n00:17:06.353 --> 00:17:09.410\nthey get run through a check zone,\nwhich is the same thing.\n\n329\n00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:13.150\nIt gets to the other end, the other system\nruns it through that same algorithm,\n\n330\n00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:16.710\ncompares what the first system\nsent over with its output, and\n\n331\n00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:20.990\nif they're the same, it knows the packet\nmade it over without being modified.\n\n332\n00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:24.560\nIf they don't match, it says, hey, I don't\nlike this packet, I'm gonna drop it.\n\n333\n00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.150\nSend it again.\n\n334\n00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:28.720\nI don't know if it was intentional or\naccidental, but\n\n335\n00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.670\nsomething changed in that packet.\n\n336\n00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:33.970\nI'm gonna ignore it and\nI want you to send it again, all right.\n\n337\n00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:39.110\nSo hashing is used everywhere to\nprovide this level of integrity.\n\n338\n00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:42.880\nAnother thing we can use for\nintegrity is simply auditing.\n\n339\n00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:47.670\nAuditing is a way that I can track\nwhat's going on with these resources.\n\n340\n00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:50.230\nNow, auditing won't prevent changes.\n\n341\n00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.060\nIt's recording what is happening.\n\n342\n00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.790\nSo, if Daniel goes in and\nmakes a change to a document\n\n343\n00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:58.860\nthat he shouldn't be able to change,\nI can audit it.\n\n344\n00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:01.660\nI can have a record of the fact\nthat Daniel made that change\n\n345\n00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.530\nat 11:30 at night when nobody\nshould have been on the system.\n\n346\n00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:07.040\nBut it didn't stop him\nfrom making the change.\n\n347\n00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.000\nIt just gives me the ability to say, oh,\n\n348\n00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.400\nI need to have a talk with\nDaniel in the morning, right.\n\n349\n00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.803\nThat's what auditing is all about.\n\n350\n00:18:13.803 --> 00:18:16.427\nAnd I can show you an example of that,\nas well.\n\n351\n00:18:16.427 --> 00:18:19.880\nI've got, let me see what's going on here.\n\n352\n00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.826\nHow about I go to,\nI'm logged on as administrator right now.\n\n353\n00:18:23.826 --> 00:18:26.605\nI'm gonna navigate back in here.\n\n354\n00:18:26.605 --> 00:18:28.438\nI'm gonna go to this share on my server.\n\n355\n00:18:28.438 --> 00:18:33.416\nSVR01/reports.\n\n356\n00:18:33.416 --> 00:18:36.260\nAnd I'm gonna make\na change to this document.\n\n357\n00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:43.305\nWe'll change that to we\ndid well this quarter.\n\n358\n00:18:43.305 --> 00:18:44.345\nNot much of a report, right?\n\n359\n00:18:44.345 --> 00:18:46.145\nBut it's just for fun.\n\n360\n00:18:46.145 --> 00:18:47.015\nI'll save and close it.\n\n361\n00:18:49.595 --> 00:18:51.870\nAnd now I'm gonna go over to the server.\n\n362\n00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:53.340\nAnd I'm gonna open up its event log.\n\n363\n00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.410\nAnd I'm gonna take a look\nat my security log.\n\n364\n00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:02.710\nAnd there we go.\n\n365\n00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:03.730\nI got an operation.\n\n366\n00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:05.920\nI've got a failure there\nfrom administrator.\n\n367\n00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:06.420\nLet's see here.\n\n368\n00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.970\nOh, I've got the failure,\nthat's kind of interesting.\n\n369\n00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:13.840\nBecause I definitely got access to\nthat document, but it's showing me\n\n370\n00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:17.110\nthings like the administrator was\nthe one that tried to access it.\n\n371\n00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:23.410\nShow me here, write data was not granted.\n\n372\n00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:25.910\nWell, actually it was, so\nthat might be an old event.\n\n373\n00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:29.660\nBut the point is, is it's gonna\nrecord that information in here.\n\n374\n00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:35.060\nI'm gonna have a record of every time\nsomebody goes and accesses that document,\n\n375\n00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:40.310\nevery time somebody goes and makes\na change to one of those documents, right?\n\n376\n00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:43.520\nSo again, not preventing it, but\ngiving me the ability to go back and\n\n377\n00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:47.020\nmaybe one of my other\nintegrity checks failed.\n\n378\n00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:50.610\nIt no longer meets that,\nthe signature no longer matches.\n\n379\n00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:54.640\nNow, I want to go and do more research and\nfind out when that document was changed,\n\n380\n00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:58.060\nwho made that change,\nwhy they were able to make that change.\n\n381\n00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.640\nThose are the kind of things\nI can do with auditing.\n\n382\n00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:05.660\nSo for integrity, we've got access\ncontrol, we've got our hashing and\n\n383\n00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:06.510\nwe've got our auditing.\n\n384\n00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:10.980\nThe last leg of it, Daniel,\nis gonna be availability.\n\n385\n00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.700\nAnd this is one that\nsometimes gets overlooked.\n\n386\n00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:19.470\nIt sometimes doesn't seem to\nfit with the rest, right.\n\n387\n00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:20.780\nWe're talking about confidentiality,\n\n388\n00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:24.390\nintegrity, how is availability\na security method?\n\n389\n00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:29.040\nWell, if my users can't get to\nthat information to do their job,\n\n390\n00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.470\nthen my company isn't going work too well,\nright?\n\n391\n00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:35.490\nAnd we can very easily\ntake security way too far.\n\n392\n00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:41.160\nWe can throw in encryption and\nauthentication methods and access control.\n\n393\n00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:44.900\nWe take it too far,\nthe data's no longer available.\n\n394\n00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.000\nThey can't do their job.\n\n395\n00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.480\nOur company can't function\nwithout that information.\n\n396\n00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.610\nSo availability is a big part of security.\n\n397\n00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:54.470\nIt has to be available.\n\n398\n00:20:54.470 --> 00:21:00.730\nYou know, the old joke is, if you want to\nmake a server bulletproof secure, take it,\n\n399\n00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:04.710\nput it in a mold, fill it with concrete,\nthrow it in the bottom of the ocean.\n\n400\n00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:07.690\nRight, nobody's gonna\nget access to that data.\n\n401\n00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:09.150\nBut it doesn't do anybody any good.\n\n402\n00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:12.090\nRight, how's my company gonna function\nif the file server's in concrete\n\n403\n00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:13.140\non the bottom of the ocean?\n\n404\n00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:14.740\n>> Yeah, we used to make the joke,\nwe'll make it so\n\n405\n00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:17.900\nsecure even we can't access it,\nand that's not what you want.\n\n406\n00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.630\nObviously you need to be\nable to access your data.\n\n407\n00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:23.990\nAnd this is really why that's\na very common venue of attack.\n\n408\n00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:26.305\nThey call this denial of service attacks,\nright.\n\n409\n00:21:26.305 --> 00:21:29.455\nWhere, if you run a website and\nyour website generates money,\n\n410\n00:21:29.455 --> 00:21:32.855\nthat's your business, and\nI now bring your website down.\n\n411\n00:21:32.855 --> 00:21:35.345\nI'm a malicious guy,\nI hacked your website.\n\n412\n00:21:35.345 --> 00:21:36.035\nI bring it down.\n\n413\n00:21:36.035 --> 00:21:37.245\nNo one can access it.\n\n414\n00:21:37.245 --> 00:21:38.335\nHow much money are you making?\n\n415\n00:21:38.335 --> 00:21:39.255\nYou're making none.\n\n416\n00:21:39.255 --> 00:21:40.545\nYou're dead in the water.\n\n417\n00:21:40.545 --> 00:21:44.670\nSo having the ability\nto have data available,\n\n418\n00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:49.050\nlet's not even say it's a website,\nlet's say it's just confidential files.\n\n419\n00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:53.510\nHow to make this product that we make,\nthe formula for it is in this file, and\n\n420\n00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:54.790\nnow I can't get to it.\n\n421\n00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:56.230\nHow good is that file to me?\n\n422\n00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:57.170\nIt's no good.\n\n423\n00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:01.190\nI need access to that data, and that's why\nI can see where this might be overlooked,\n\n424\n00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:03.080\nbut it's probably one of\nthe most important of the three.\n\n425\n00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.090\n>> It really is.\n\n426\n00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:04.610\nRight?\n\n427\n00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:08.340\nOther things that we've gotta think about,\nwhat if a bad guy breaks into our server\n\n428\n00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:11.530\nand starts formatting drives or\nstarts deleting files.\n\n429\n00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:12.870\nWell, as a security person,\n\n430\n00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:15.890\nI need to be able to make sure\nthat that data is available.\n\n431\n00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:21.740\nWhich means I better have taken a backup\nof that server before that happened.\n\n432\n00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:23.530\nSo doing things like backups.\n\n433\n00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:27.830\nDoing things like having redundant copies.\n\n434\n00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:32.210\nUsing hardware to give us fault\ntolerance like a RAID system,\n\n435\n00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:36.270\nwhere if a hard drive fails,\nI don't lose all of my data.\n\n436\n00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:40.550\nThese are all things that I can\ndo to provide that availability.\n\n437\n00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:44.260\nIn Windows, we use clusters on\nour server operating systems so\n\n438\n00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:48.430\nthat if one of those nodes fails, well\nthe server to the network is still up,\n\n439\n00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:52.443\ncuz another node just takes over using\n\n440\n00:22:52.443 --> 00:22:57.620\nHyper-V and\nmoving machines from one node to another.\n\n441\n00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:02.440\nIf one of them fails, all of these\nare ways that I can provide for\n\n442\n00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:07.480\nthat availability,\nhaving those backups, yeah.\n\n443\n00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.250\nAnd when we talk about availability,\n\n444\n00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:13.550\nit's not just deliver, that is one of\nthe first things we all think about is oh,\n\n445\n00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:18.800\nthe bad guys got in, and he's trying\nto wipe out my data or delete my data.\n\n446\n00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.940\nThat's definitely one of the things\nthat we gotta protect against.\n\n447\n00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:25.650\nYou've got an employee that just found\nout they're gonna get terminated, so they\n\n448\n00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:30.510\nstart going in and deleting everything\nthey can before they get escorted out.\n\n449\n00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:33.510\nOr something like that,\nso it can be deliberate.\n\n450\n00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:35.120\nBut it can also be accidental.\n\n451\n00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.040\nIt could be natural, right.\n\n452\n00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:40.674\nPower failures, maybe the people next\nto us are getting some work done,\n\n453\n00:23:40.674 --> 00:23:42.880\nthey're laying down a sprinkler system and\n\n454\n00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.455\nthat backhoe just cut one\nof my fiber optic cables.\n\n455\n00:23:45.455 --> 00:23:47.980\nWell now my information\nis no longer available.\n\n456\n00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.876\nMy customers can't get to\nmy website anymore, right.\n\n457\n00:23:51.876 --> 00:23:53.750\nIt's not available.\n\n458\n00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:57.564\nHere in Florida we have hurricanes\nthat can do some major wind damage and\n\n459\n00:23:57.564 --> 00:24:01.252\nFlood damage, I've got to think\nabout things like that because if it\n\n460\n00:24:01.252 --> 00:24:03.415\ncomes through and floods my building and\n\n461\n00:24:03.415 --> 00:24:06.869\nmy server closet's under water\nmy data is no longer available.\n\n462\n00:24:06.869 --> 00:24:10.552\nSo there can be different natural\ndisasters obviously in different areas of\n\n463\n00:24:10.552 --> 00:24:14.533\nthe world that we have to deal with, but\nsomething that we've got to think about.\n\n464\n00:24:14.533 --> 00:24:15.745\n>> Right.\n>> I've gotta make sure that\n\n465\n00:24:15.745 --> 00:24:16.520\ndata's available.\n\n466\n00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:19.660\nWhether that means maybe\nhaving a cold site or\n\n467\n00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:24.920\na hot site somewhere else that's outside\nof that natural disaster occurrence area.\n\n468\n00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.870\nSo that if something happens I can move.\n\n469\n00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:30.380\nHaving offsite backups,\nputting stuff up in the Cloud.\n\n470\n00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:34.530\nAll of these can help me\nprovide that availability.\n\n471\n00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:37.270\nBut they can be deliberate.\n\n472\n00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:38.510\nI say they can be accidental.\n\n473\n00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:41.870\nIt could be, like I said,\nsomebody runs into a light post and\n\n474\n00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:45.010\ntakes out the power from my building or\nwhat have you.\n\n475\n00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:46.400\nBut it can also be deliberate.\n\n476\n00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.630\nCould be bad guys doing as\nDaniel was saying earlier,\n\n477\n00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:51.500\na denial of service on our web server.\n\n478\n00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:55.415\nWhether if they can send so much data to\nmy web server that my web server can no\n\n479\n00:24:55.415 --> 00:24:58.950\nlonger respond to requests,\nwell now I can't sell my product.\n\n480\n00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:01.330\nMy customers can't get to my website.\n\n481\n00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:03.470\nThat's an availability issue.\n\n482\n00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:03.970\nRight?\n\n483\n00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.910\nThere's several different attacks\nthat they can do to try to do what\n\n484\n00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:13.000\nare called denial of service attacks,\nall important.\n\n485\n00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.770\nSo, it is one of those things\nthat sometimes gets overlooked\n\n486\n00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:21.300\nwhen it comes to security, but\navailability again, a big part of it.\n\n487\n00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:22.720\nWe've gotta have em all.\n\n488\n00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.642\nAs I said at the very beginning,\nthe CIA triad.\n\n489\n00:25:25.642 --> 00:25:27.450\nCIA triad.\n\n490\n00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:29.110\nIt's like a tripod.\n\n491\n00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:33.840\nOne of those legs is out or missing,\nthe whole thing's gonna fall over.\n\n492\n00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.830\nAnd you gotta put equal\nimportance on each one.\n\n493\n00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:39.660\nI like to think of the guy that's got\na tripod where one of the legs is shorter\n\n494\n00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:40.232\nthan the other.\n\n495\n00:25:40.232 --> 00:25:40.744\n>> Tilty.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n496\n00:25:40.744 --> 00:25:42.550\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n497\n00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:44.280\nIt's gonna work.\n\n498\n00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.839\nWe can make it work, but not-\n>> It ain't gonna be pretty.\n\n499\n00:25:46.839 --> 00:25:49.182\n>> [LAUGH] Or comfortable.\n\n500\n00:25:49.182 --> 00:25:51.590\n[LAUGH]\n>> So you've got to provide.\n\n501\n00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:56.440\nYou've got to make sure you're spending\ndue diligence or taking focus on all three\n\n502\n00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:00.570\nof those areas there, confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability.\n\n503\n00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:03.700\nAnd these are really\nthe cornerstones of security.\n\n504\n00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:08.560\nWhen you get into the security field and\nwhen you go to secure a server, when\n\n505\n00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:12.760\nyou go to secure and individual machine,\nwhen you go to secure the entire network,\n\n506\n00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:16.258\nwhen you go to secure the enterprise,\nthese are the things you're looking at.\n\n507\n00:26:16.258 --> 00:26:17.130\nAnd you wanna sit there and\n\n508\n00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:20.600\nyou want to think about how we're\ngonna provide confidentiality?\n\n509\n00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.970\nWhat is the best method?\n\n510\n00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:25.240\nAnd not everything get's\nthe same level of protection.\n\n511\n00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.150\nRight?\nWhen it comes to confidentiality,\n\n512\n00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:29.190\nyou can categorize things.\n\n513\n00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:30.510\nYou might have some documents and\n\n514\n00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:33.180\nsome resources that the public\ncan get access to, right?\n\n515\n00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:34.100\nStuff on my website.\n\n516\n00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:36.340\nI want them to see product descriptions.\n\n517\n00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:39.410\nPictures of the product that\nthey're thinking about ordering.\n\n518\n00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:43.030\nOther information,\nI need to keep a little more confidential.\n\n519\n00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:46.140\nThat's the employee handbook or\nthe employee phone list.\n\n520\n00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:47.270\nAnd things like that, right?\n\n521\n00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:50.690\nEverybody in the company, but\nnobody outside of the company.\n\n522\n00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:54.580\nOther things still might have a higher\nlevel of security or confidentiality\n\n523\n00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:58.660\nassociated, those quarterly\nreports on our profits and losses.\n\n524\n00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:02.740\nAs an employee I might have access to\nthem, but those c level employees do.\n\n525\n00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.064\nAll right?\nMy HR people might or\n\n526\n00:27:04.064 --> 00:27:08.110\nmy budgeting people or whomever,\nthey might have access to it.\n\n527\n00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:11.660\nSo different levels of confidentiality\nthat we've gotta be able to provide.\n\n528\n00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:13.180\nHow are we gonna implement that?\n\n529\n00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:16.730\nWhat are we gonna use that'll\ngive me that level of control?\n\n530\n00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:18.650\nSo you'll go through and\nyou'll classify things.\n\n531\n00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:23.600\nAnd you might make up your own system like\nvery confidential, somewhat confidential,\n\n532\n00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.460\nand not confidential.\n\n533\n00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:30.248\nOr you might go more of a military\nthing and go top secret, confidential,\n\n534\n00:27:30.248 --> 00:27:34.840\nin public, in private or what have you but\ncome up with some system for\n\n535\n00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.170\nconfidentiality.\n\n536\n00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:40.760\nAvailability again making sure that\nthat information is available.\n\n537\n00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:45.620\nThat means doing things like backups and\nclustering, providing full\n\n538\n00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:50.570\ntolerance and making sure that our other\nsecurity methods haven't gone too far.\n\n539\n00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:52.640\nAnd then integrity and\nI kind of went out of order there.\n\n540\n00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:56.410\nBut integrity, making sure that\nthose files aren't modified or\n\n541\n00:27:56.410 --> 00:28:02.160\nthat the resources are not modified or\nat least giving me the ability to detect\n\n542\n00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:05.830\nthat there has been a change, whether\nit was intentional or unintentional.\n\n543\n00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:07.720\nSo CIA triad.\n\n544\n00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:10.700\nConfidentiality and\nintegrity and availability.\n\n545\n00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:11.580\n>> I'll tell you Mike.\n\n546\n00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:15.130\nYou were talking about auditing earlier\nwhen it came to integrity, and it really\n\n547\n00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:20.940\nhit home to me, exactly how important it\nis to not share your information, right?\n\n548\n00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:24.380\nBecause if he had my password,\nmy user name, what could he do?\n\n549\n00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:24.880\nHe could log in.\n\n550\n00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.660\nHe could make changes.\n\n551\n00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:30.550\nNow when the system's administrators,\nwe go to see who made that change.\n\n552\n00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:34.160\nWell if he logged in as me guess who's\ngonna get the finger pointed at them.\n\n553\n00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.480\nI am.\nI used to yell at users all the time for\n\n554\n00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.650\nsharing their data.\n\n555\n00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:42.790\nDo not share your username and\npassword with anyone, keep those things on\n\n556\n00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:46.820\nthe QT as yours, because if anybody\ngoes in and they make a change or\n\n557\n00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:51.280\nthey delete something, and it's done under\nyour name, guess who we're gonna point to?\n\n558\n00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:55.090\nAnd you would really have to come up\nwith some strong evidence to show\n\n559\n00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:56.030\nthat it wasn't you,\n\n560\n00:28:56.030 --> 00:29:00.380\nbecause the computer is telling us that\nit was you through that audit trail.\n\n561\n00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:03.150\n>> Absolutely, you're gonna need a time\nstamp picture from somewhere saying,\n\n562\n00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:05.110\nI was not at that computer.\n\n563\n00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:08.030\nAnd then you're still gonna get in\ntrouble because you gave your password\n\n564\n00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:09.800\nto somebody and\nnow they're logged on as you.\n\n565\n00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:10.590\nSo, yeah.\n\n566\n00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:12.430\nDon't do that.\n\n567\n00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:15.250\n>> Well, Mike it looks like we're\nrunning a little bit out of time and\n\n568\n00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:19.470\nI know we have a lot more stuff to cover,\na lot of really good information, but\n\n569\n00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:21.730\nthat means we're gonna\nhave to do a part two.\n\n570\n00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:23.280\nHopefully we'll see you good people there.\n\n571\n00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.190\nMike, thanks for those demonstrations,\nexplanations that you gave us.\n\n572\n00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:27.410\nReally, really helpful.\n\n573\n00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:30.730\nWe're gonna go on to that part two, as for\nthis episode, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n574\n00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:31.380\nsign off.\n\n575\n00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:34.110\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n576\n00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:34.960\n>> And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n577\n00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.979\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n578\n00:29:36.979 --> 00:29:42.550\n[SOUND]\n\n",
