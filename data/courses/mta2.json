great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.770\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.380\nJoining me in the studio today\nis none other than Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.380\nHow's it going today, Mike?\n\n7\n00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.770\n>> Oh, it's going great,\nDaniel, I'm excited to be here.\n\n8\n00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.450\nWe got more of our MTA\ncontent coming your way.\n\n9\n00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.440\nAnd this one, our security fundamentals.\n\n10\n00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.470\nSo we're gonna be focusing on Security.\n\n11\n00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.200\nA great field to get into.\n\n12\n00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.370\nHopefully, a lot of you are intrigued and\n\n13\n00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.940\nmaybe want to get into\nthe world of security.\n\n14\n00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.530\nThis is a great place to start.\n\n15\n00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.460\nIn this episode,\n\n16\n00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.260\nDaniel, we're gonna be focusing in\non those core security principles.\n\n17\n00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.390\nSome fundamental knowledge and terminology\nwe really need to be familiar with.\n\n18\n00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.670\n>> That's right, and whether you're\ngonna be in security as a career or not,\n\n19\n00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.910\nyou do need to understand a nice\nfoundational knowledge of security itself,\n\n20\n00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.320\nbecause it impacts everyone.\n\n21\n00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.770\nYou go to any company anywhere, and you'll\nrealize that even down to the secretaries\n\n22\n00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.370\nor the people in HR, the people in\nresearch, it doesn't matter where you sit.\n\n23\n00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.920\nYou gotta know a little something\nabout security cuz we're all kind of\n\n24\n00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.660\ninvolved in that.\n\n25\n00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.520\nIf I'm giving out my password to\neverybody and their brother, well,\n\n26\n00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.360\nI'm not being very secure and\nthat's not a good practice.\n\n27\n00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.690\nSo today, Mike, you're gonna help us out,\nsort of help fill in that gap,\n\n28\n00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.500\ngive us that foundational knowledge so\nthat we understand security,\n\n29\n00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.090\nwhat we need to know, and especially\nif you do want to get in security\n\n30\n00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.260\nthis is definitely the stuff\nyou gotta know, right?\n\n31\n00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.240\n>> It is, it is.\n\n32\n00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.180\nAnd it's exciting stuff, so\nwhy wouldn't you wanna get into this?\n\n33\n00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.900\nAll right, so let's start with\nsome basic terminology and\n\n34\n00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.930\na very core concept when it comes to\nsecurity, and that is the CIA triad.\n\n35\n00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.470\nIt doesn't matter where you go,\nwhat webpage you visit,\n\n36\n00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.090\nwhat book you read, you're gonna\nsee this term, CIA or CIA triad,\n\n37\n00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.760\nand we're not talking about the Central\nIntelligence Agency here in the US.\n\n38\n00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.122\n>> Which is Triads.\n\n39\n00:01:55.122 --> 00:01:57.109\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Or more than Triads.\n\n40\n00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.929\n>> That's right.\n\n41\n00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:59.560\n[LAUGH]\n>> We're going to some sort of\n\n42\n00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.902\nsecret court, aren't we, Mike?\n\n43\n00:02:00.902 --> 00:02:02.956\n>> [LAUGH] We are in trouble, aren't we?\n\n44\n00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:08.940\nAll right, but CIA means confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability.\n\n45\n00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.680\nThese are the three core security\nprinciples that we have to follow.\n\n46\n00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.560\nThey really make the foundation\nof our security,\n\n47\n00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.450\nyou can think of them as legs on a tripod.\n\n48\n00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.830\nWithout one of them the whole\nthing is gonna fall over.\n\n49\n00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.470\nSo confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability.\n\n50\n00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.960\nWhen we're trying to secure a system,\n\n51\n00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.250\nwhen we're trying to secure a network,\nwhatever it is.\n\n52\n00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.870\nThese are what we have to keep in mind.\n\n53\n00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.087\nThis is what we're trying to provide for\nmy systems and my network.\n\n54\n00:02:36.087 --> 00:02:39.140\nConfidentiality, integrity,\nand availability.\n\n55\n00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.780\nAnd let's start with the first one,\nconfidentiality, right?\n\n56\n00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.550\nConfidentiality simply means\n\n57\n00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.790\nonly authorized people should\nhave access to that information.\n\n58\n00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:50.340\nRight?\n\n59\n00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.030\nIf it's something confidential between\nyou and your doctor then only you and\n\n60\n00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.160\nyour doctor should have access\nto the information, right?\n\n61\n00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.070\nThe janitor that comes and\n\n62\n00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.160\ncleans the place shouldn't have\naccess to the information.\n\n63\n00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.051\nThe guy that's coming\nin to fix the phones or\n\n64\n00:03:04.051 --> 00:03:07.186\ncoming in to fix the network shouldn't\nhave access to the information.\n\n65\n00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:08.600\nIt's confidential.\n\n66\n00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.200\nYou might have information\nat a workplace where\n\n67\n00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.360\nall of the employees have access to it,\nit's our employee handbook.\n\n68\n00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.870\nRight?\n\n69\n00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.640\nBut nobody outside the organization\nshould have access to that information.\n\n70\n00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.600\nSo it's confidential.\n\n71\n00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.560\nSo when you think of confidential,\ndon't think super secret.\n\n72\n00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.390\nThat's not necessarily the case.\n\n73\n00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.940\nBut there is some level of\ncontrol that I wanna provide.\n\n74\n00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.350\nNot everybody should have access to it.\n\n75\n00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.810\nThere is information that's available to\nthe public and that anybody can have,\n\n76\n00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.210\nright, like my website information\nthat the public can come to.\n\n77\n00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.560\nWell, that's not confidential.\n\n78\n00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.040\nThere's no level of confidentiality there.\n\n79\n00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.050\nBut on most of our documents we're gonna\nprovide some level of confidentiality.\n\n80\n00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.670\nNow how do we do that?\n\n81\n00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.550\nWell, we got several different methods\nwe can use to provide confidentiality.\n\n82\n00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.020\nThe one we always think of I think that\npops in everybodys mind is gonna be\n\n83\n00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.230\nEncryption, because encryption\nis a good way to make sure\n\n84\n00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.880\nthat only authorized users or\npeople have access to that information.\n\n85\n00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.710\nNow Windows gives us a method\nwe can use to encrypt it.\n\n86\n00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.300\nPart of the NTFS file system is EFS, or\n\n87\n00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.920\nmy encrypting file system and\nlet's take a look at how that works.\n\n88\n00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.520\nI've got a Windows 7 box pulled up here,\nI'm gonna open up file explorer, and\n\n89\n00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.920\nI'm gonna navigate my way into the hard\ndrive and in this docs folder and\n\n90\n00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.555\nhere a file called Mike's stuff.\n\n91\n00:04:24.555 --> 00:04:25.935\nRight?\nThis is my stuff,\n\n92\n00:04:25.935 --> 00:04:30.615\nI don't want anybody else to be\nable to access this information.\n\n93\n00:04:30.615 --> 00:04:31.315\nSo, what do I do?\n\n94\n00:04:31.315 --> 00:04:35.755\nWell, I can right click on it,\nand I can pull up the properties.\n\n95\n00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.561\nI can go over to the Advanced Attributes,\nand\n\n96\n00:04:40.561 --> 00:04:44.510\nI can choose to encrypt\ncontents to secure data.\n\n97\n00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.728\nI'll click OK, and I'll click OK.\n\n98\n00:04:47.728 --> 00:04:53.200\nAnd I'm gonna do the file only, click OK,\nand notice the file name turned green.\n\n99\n00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.390\nThis is Windows's visual cue that\nthis file has been encrypted.\n\n100\n00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.850\nNow, to me, because I'm the one that\nencrypted it, I'm an authorized user.\n\n101\n00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.380\nSo I can double-click on it,\nI can open it, I can type in there.\n\n102\n00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:13.000\nAnd I can make changes to it,\nI can save it, I can close it.\n\n103\n00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.270\nI don't have to do anything.\n\n104\n00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.120\nTo me, the document didn't seem encrypted,\nright?\n\n105\n00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.380\nI double click on it like normal,\nit just opens right up.\n\n106\n00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.420\nWell let's see what happens if\nwe try that with somebody else.\n\n107\n00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.520\nAnd we'll log off.\n\n108\n00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.430\nAnd I'm gonna log back on as a different\nuser, a little switch user, other user.\n\n109\n00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.440\nAnd, Daniel, if you can just give\nme your password real quick?\n\n110\n00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.180\n>> Oh yeah, it's not gonna happen.\n\n111\n00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.380\n>> Not.\n\n112\n00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.395\n>> Yeah, oh crap.\n\n113\n00:05:43.395 --> 00:05:44.640\n[LAUGH]\n>> Gonna, happen.\n\n114\n00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.625\nLet's see if that worked.\n\n115\n00:05:45.625 --> 00:05:47.836\n>> [LAUGH] Outlook did not work.\n\n116\n00:05:47.836 --> 00:05:49.870\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n117\n00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.580\nnow I'm logged on as Daniel.\n\n118\n00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:58.280\nI open up File Explorer, I navigate into\nthat same location, and there's my stuff.\n\n119\n00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.120\nI can see it's green,\n\n120\n00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.390\nI can see the file, I double click on it,\nI get the old, access is denied.\n\n121\n00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.900\nSo there's an example of how\nencryption can provide us\n\n122\n00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.650\nwith a level of confidentiality.\n\n123\n00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.970\nIf you're not authorized to get in that\ndocument, you're not gonna get it.\n\n124\n00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.512\n>> And Mike, even if somehow I\ndid grab a copy of this document,\n\n125\n00:06:16.512 --> 00:06:19.228\nits not gonna show me\nthe information inside.\n\n126\n00:06:19.228 --> 00:06:21.860\nIts just gonna be a bunch of\ngarbage as far I'm concerned.\n\n127\n00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.410\n>> Absolutely.\n\n128\n00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.360\nIn fact, you're gonna have a hard time\ngetting it because this particular\n\n129\n00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.750\nencryption is a part of the file system.\n\n130\n00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.280\nSo let's say Daniel wanted to copy\nthat over to a thumb drive and\n\n131\n00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.480\ntake it with him and try to break into it.\n\n132\n00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.950\nWell that thumb drive unless it's formated\nin DFS,and even if it is, he didn't have\n\n133\n00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.220\npermission to decrypt it, it's got to be\ndecrypted, sent across the network, and\n\n134\n00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.430\nthen encrypted again on the file system,\nhe won't even be able to copy that\n\n135\n00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.390\nfile over to another volume or\na thumb drive or anything like that.\n\n136\n00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.950\nSo it really does give us that\nlevel of confidentiality,\n\n137\n00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.190\nwhich is a big part in security.\n\n138\n00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.860\nYou're gonna see encryption in just about\n\n139\n00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.940\nevery place you go to because it is a easy\nway to provide that confidentiality.\n\n140\n00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.520\nNow, we get into advanced security classes\nwe're gonna learn that we've got to be\n\n141\n00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.390\ncareful with that because\nthe way encryption works,\n\n142\n00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:12.740\nit uses keys along with mathematical\nformulas to encrypt that information.\n\n143\n00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.950\nThe problem is,\n\n144\n00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.310\nif I ever lose those keys not even I would\nbe able to get back in to that document.\n\n145\n00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.470\nSo there are methods that we've got\nto take place to ensure that we don't\n\n146\n00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.060\npermanently lose access\nto that information, but\n\n147\n00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.600\nthat's in a next level\nof security classes.\n\n148\n00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.640\nSo we've got encryption.\n\n149\n00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.230\nThat's a very common way to\nprovide that confidentiality.\n\n150\n00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.870\nLike I said, it's the one that I\nthink everybody thinks of when they\n\n151\n00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.290\nfirst think of confidentiality,\nbut it's not the only method.\n\n152\n00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.107\nOther methods would\ninclude authentication.\n\n153\n00:07:40.107 --> 00:07:40.790\nRight?\n\n154\n00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.770\nIf you can't log onto the system,\n\n155\n00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.993\nthen you're not gonna get\naccess to that information.\n\n156\n00:07:45.993 --> 00:07:51.459\nSo using a good strong authentication\nmethod is a big part in confidentiality.\n\n157\n00:07:51.459 --> 00:07:52.018\nRight.\n\n158\n00:07:52.018 --> 00:07:57.319\nIn Windows for example, we have password\npolicies that make sure I can enforce\n\n159\n00:07:57.319 --> 00:08:02.321\nthe types of passwords, how often I\nhave to change it, things like that.\n\n160\n00:08:02.321 --> 00:08:04.950\nIn fact, let's take a peek at it.\n\n161\n00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.697\nIf I come over here to\nmy domain controller,\n\n162\n00:08:07.697 --> 00:08:10.830\nI can open up my group\npolicy management console.\n\n163\n00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:17.780\nPull up my Default Domain Policy,\nexpand out Policies, Windows Settings,\n\n164\n00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:23.930\nSecurity Settings, Account Policies,\nand there is my Password Policy.\n\n165\n00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.480\nAnd in a domain environment by default\n\n166\n00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.280\nthey're doing things like you have to\nchange your password every 42 days.\n\n167\n00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.580\nI'll remember the last 24\npasswords that you've used, so\n\n168\n00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.450\nyou can't reuse the same password over and\nover again.\n\n169\n00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:39.020\nIt has to be at least\nseven characters long.\n\n170\n00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.220\nHas to meet complexity requirements,\nmeaning it has to be\n\n171\n00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:46.670\nmade up of a combination of characters,\nnot just letters, not just numbers.\n\n172\n00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:50.540\nSo these are things that I can do\nto make sure we're using a good,\n\n173\n00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.350\nstrong authentication method.\n\n174\n00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:53.580\nNot the only place.\n\n175\n00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.120\nIf you have a website, right?\n\n176\n00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.710\nA lot of websites if you want\nsomebody log into that website,\n\n177\n00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:00.230\nhow are you going to authenticate that?\n\n178\n00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:04.200\nYou could do very simple forms based\nauthentication, or we could go much\n\n179\n00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.760\nmore complex with like active directive\nfederation services, and things like that.\n\n180\n00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:13.870\nBut we want to make sure that we are using\nsome good strong authentication method.\n\n181\n00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.540\nOtherwise, somebody could\nattempt at guess passwords,\n\n182\n00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:19.190\nor try to break that authentication, and\n\n183\n00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.990\nget access to information that\nthey should not have access to.\n\n184\n00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:28.150\nAnother method we can use to provide\nconfidentiality is going to be\n\n185\n00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:32.920\naccess control, and\naccess control is using, in Windows,\n\n186\n00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.200\nthat's going be access control list,\npart of my NTFS file system.\n\n187\n00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.270\nNow let me go back over here, for\nexample, and take a look at a document.\n\n188\n00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.760\nI'm still logged in as Daniel.\n\n189\n00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.540\nSo let's see if Daniel's\ngoing to have permissions.\n\n190\n00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:46.340\nHe's not.\n\n191\n00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:47.910\nI just know he's not.\n\n192\n00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.170\nI didn't give Daniel any permissions.\n\n193\n00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:51.070\nI don't trust the guy.\n\n194\n00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:52.425\n>> He's a shady character that Daniel.\n\n195\n00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:55.288\n[LAUGH]\n>> He is a little bit shady.\n\n196\n00:09:55.288 --> 00:09:58.847\nSo I'm going to do a little switch user,\nother user, and\n\n197\n00:09:58.847 --> 00:10:01.006\nlog back on as the administrator.\n\n198\n00:10:04.356 --> 00:10:06.410\nSo I will have permissions\nto show you this.\n\n199\n00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.760\nAnd once you get logged in,\nI'm going to open up File Explorer.\n\n200\n00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:12.340\nAnd again, access control,\nas far as the confidentiality goes,\n\n201\n00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.630\nis preventing people to be\nable to access the resource.\n\n202\n00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.980\nIf you can't access the resource, then\nyou can't see the information inside it.\n\n203\n00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:23.220\nSo I am providing a level\nof confidentiality.\n\n204\n00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:28.930\nIf I go take a look back over here,\nat that folder.\n\n205\n00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:30.150\nHere's my handbook.\n\n206\n00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.650\nOops.\n\n207\n00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:38.200\nAnd if I pull up the properties for\nthis handbook, I go to that Security tab,\n\n208\n00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:45.620\nI'll see that the hosts have read\nusers have read and execute.\n\n209\n00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:48.390\nLet's say this was just for\nhosts all right, and\n\n210\n00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:51.100\nthey didn't want anybody\nelse being able to see it.\n\n211\n00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.590\nWell, I could remove users.\n\n212\n00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:55.560\nI'll click edit,\nI'll grab those users, and\n\n213\n00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.160\nI'll remove their permissions and\nI'll apply that change.\n\n214\n00:10:59.160 --> 00:10:59.820\nRight.\n\n215\n00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:05.900\nSo, by using that access control list,\nI am in control of who has access in\n\n216\n00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:10.780\nthe first place and what level of access\nthey have, whether they can just read, or\n\n217\n00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:16.380\nread and write, or modify, or\nfull control or whatever the case may be.\n\n218\n00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:20.150\nSo three different ways I can really\nprovide for that confidentiality,\n\n219\n00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:25.690\nencryption, I can use access control\nlists, and I can do authentication.\n\n220\n00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:27.350\nAll three provide that confidentiality.\n\n221\n00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:32.520\nAll right, next thing on our CA triad,\nthat is integrity.\n\n222\n00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.530\nAnd integrity means when it\ncomes to your computers and\n\n223\n00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:39.000\nkeeping our information secure,\nwe talked about integrity,\n\n224\n00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.663\nwe're talking about the ability to prevent\nunauthorized changes to information.\n\n225\n00:11:43.663 --> 00:11:50.150\nI need to make sure that this document\ndoes not get modified unintentionally.\n\n226\n00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:54.400\nIntentional changes, if you're supposed\nto be able to make changes, that's okay.\n\n227\n00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.160\nWhat I don't want is somebody accidentally\nmaking a change to that document,\n\n228\n00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.570\nthey didn't realize it,\nthey backed up over a paragraph or two and\n\n229\n00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:05.220\nthen closed it and said save or\ndon't, and they just hit save.\n\n230\n00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:08.620\nOops, I just wiped out half\nmy employee handbook, right?\n\n231\n00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.300\nOr malicious changes.\n\n232\n00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.700\nBad guys trying to get\ninto your system and\n\n233\n00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.390\nmake changes to some of your documents or\nyour information there.\n\n234\n00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:21.360\nSo integrity, the ability to\nmake sure that we can tell or\n\n235\n00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.180\nprevent unauthorized\nchanges to our resources.\n\n236\n00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:29.470\n>> Now Mike, our access control list\nkind of does that for us as well, right?\n\n237\n00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:31.200\nSo it kind of works on two levels.\n\n238\n00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.210\n>> It really does, right?\n\n239\n00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:36.230\nIf you can't get access to the resource\nthen you can't make changes to it.\n\n240\n00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.640\nSo you see how it's\nproviding confidentiality,\n\n241\n00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.230\nyou can't get access to it.\n\n242\n00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:43.450\nIt's also providing integrity,\nyou can't get access to it so\n\n243\n00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.980\nyou can't make changes to the information.\n\n244\n00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:48.110\nSo you're absolutely right Daniel.\n\n245\n00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:51.080\nThe access control Is our first step in\n\n246\n00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.800\ncontrolling that integrity of those\ndocuments or those resources.\n\n247\n00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:58.640\nAnother method we're going to\nuse to provide that integrity\n\n248\n00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.850\nis something known as hashing,\nor hashing algorithms.\n\n249\n00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:03.780\nAnd let's take a look.\n\n250\n00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.140\nI've got a little drawing here.\n\n251\n00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:10.951\nA hashing algorithm is simply\na mathematical formula that I'm\n\n252\n00:13:10.951 --> 00:13:15.110\ngoing to kind of feed\nthe information through.\n\n253\n00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:17.860\nThat mathematical formula is\ngoing to do it's calculation,\n\n254\n00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:23.040\nand it's going to spit out\nwhat's known as a hash value, or\n\n255\n00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:27.990\na check sum, several different names\nthey might apply to that output.\n\n256\n00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:29.960\nI'm going to call it a hash value.\n\n257\n00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:34.930\nWhat's really cool, here's an example,\nMD5 is one example of a hashing algorithm.\n\n258\n00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:35.730\nThere's several.\n\n259\n00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:41.800\nThere's SHA, ripe MD, there's\nseveral other algorithms we can use.\n\n260\n00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.045\nMessage digest is another one\nI should probably mention,\n\n261\n00:13:44.045 --> 00:13:46.510\nbecause you'll see that in\na lot of books you read.\n\n262\n00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:50.180\nMD or message digest is\nthe same thing as a hash value.\n\n263\n00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:55.930\nThe output of this hashing algorithm,\nright, MD5 being one example.\n\n264\n00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:59.980\nAnd there's an example of the output that\nyou might get, so you might take this\n\n265\n00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:05.090\nreport that you generated, and you want\nto make sure that no changes occur to it.\n\n266\n00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:07.740\nWell, you feed it through\nthe MD5 algorithm.\n\n267\n00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.990\nIt spits out this value.\n\n268\n00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:12.520\nNow this won't prevent changes to it.\n\n269\n00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.080\nSomebody could change it.\n\n270\n00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.870\nBut if they do, and you take that document\nand you feed it back through that exact\n\n271\n00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:21.270\nsame algorithm, you're going to\nget a completely different result.\n\n272\n00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:26.410\nIf no changes have been made, that output\nwill be the same every single time.\n\n273\n00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:30.310\n>> So this is a good way for us to\nverify that the integrity of the file\n\n274\n00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:33.230\nis what we expect it to be and\nit has not been changed.\n\n275\n00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:34.210\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n276\n00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:36.500\nSo it's not going to keep\nthem from making changes, but\n\n277\n00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:40.850\nit is going to allow us to detect changes,\nand sometimes that's just as important.\n\n278\n00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:44.920\nI need to know if there's been any\nmodifications to those resources, or\n\n279\n00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:45.930\nthose files.\n\n280\n00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:49.540\nLet me give an example here,\nI've got an online hash calculator,\n\n281\n00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.540\nTools4noobs out here gives us this.\n\n282\n00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:55.980\nAnd I've simply typed in some text, I'm\ngoing to choose my algorithm, I'll do md5.\n\n283\n00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:02.600\nAnd I'll click hash this, and\nit spits out this hash value, alright?\n\n284\n00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.620\nNow, if I do this again,\n\n285\n00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:09.945\nI'll click hash notice this starts\nwith nine echo 107 delta, hash this.\n\n286\n00:15:09.945 --> 00:15:13.510\nNine echo 107 delta, right?\n\n287\n00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:14.970\nSo nothing's change.\n\n288\n00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:17.520\nI could hash it over and over again, and\n\n289\n00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.710\nit's going to be the same\nthing every time.\n\n290\n00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:23.970\nIf I make one change to this, I'm simply\ngoing to put a period in there and\n\n291\n00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:24.640\nclick hash this.\n\n292\n00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:30.140\nNo more nine or whatever\n>> Echo 107 delta.\n\n293\n00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.130\n>> Thank you, 107 delta, right?\n\n294\n00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:33.670\nCompletely different value.\n\n295\n00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:34.780\nOne period.\n\n296\n00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.310\nI got a value that\ndoesn't even look close.\n\n297\n00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:39.720\nAll we did was look at\nthe first five characters.\n\n298\n00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.257\nAnd those have changed, right?\n\n299\n00:15:41.257 --> 00:15:44.237\nSo this is the power\nof hashing algorithms,\n\n300\n00:15:44.237 --> 00:15:46.739\nis being able to detect that change.\n\n301\n00:15:46.739 --> 00:15:50.957\nAnd I don't care if you take\nthe entire Encyclopedia Britannica And\n\n302\n00:15:50.957 --> 00:15:53.548\nfeed it through that hashing algorithm.\n\n303\n00:15:53.548 --> 00:15:55.027\nGonna take you a little while, but\n\n304\n00:15:55.027 --> 00:15:58.050\nin the end you're gonna get a value\nthat looks just like this, right?\n\n305\n00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:00.480\nIt's gonna be the same length value.\n\n306\n00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.540\nYou could put one little comma,\n\n307\n00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:07.260\nor change one letter,\nanywhere in that entire encyclopedia.\n\n308\n00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.480\nFeed it through this\nhashing algorithm again,\n\n309\n00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.895\nit's gonna come up with a different value.\n\n310\n00:16:10.895 --> 00:16:13.980\nYes, it's gonna take it a long\ntime to run through there, but\n\n311\n00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.820\nyou'll be able to detect that change.\n\n312\n00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.910\nOur operating system uses this\nto keep our computer safe.\n\n313\n00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:23.240\nAll of our system files get run\nthrough a hash algorithm, and\n\n314\n00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.450\nit keeps a little table of all the values,\nthe outputs.\n\n315\n00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:30.160\nSo every time it starts up,\nit runs all those files through there,\n\n316\n00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.800\ncompares those values.\n\n317\n00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.280\nIf they haven't changed, everything is\ngood, and we go right back on there.\n\n318\n00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.460\nWe log into our system and\neverything is fine.\n\n319\n00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:40.004\nIf one of those systems\nfiles has been modified,\n\n320\n00:16:40.004 --> 00:16:42.486\nif one of those values\ndoesn't match anymore,\n\n321\n00:16:42.486 --> 00:16:46.660\nthe system now knows that somebody\npossibly made some unintentional changes.\n\n322\n00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.546\nSomething's definitely changed, but\n\n323\n00:16:48.546 --> 00:16:51.099\nit could have been possibly\nan unintentional change,\n\n324\n00:16:51.099 --> 00:16:54.880\nlike somebody trying to replace a system\nfoul so they can get access to my system.\n\n325\n00:16:55.930 --> 00:17:02.227\nSo hashing, probably the most common way\nto validate, or to provide that integrity.\n\n326\n00:17:02.227 --> 00:17:03.805\nTCP/IP packets, right?\n\n327\n00:17:03.805 --> 00:17:06.353\nEvery time they get to the other end,\nbefore they leave,\n\n328\n00:17:06.353 --> 00:17:09.410\nthey get run through a check zone,\nwhich is the same thing.\n\n329\n00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:13.150\nIt gets to the other end, the other system\nruns it through that same algorithm,\n\n330\n00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:16.710\ncompares what the first system\nsent over with its output, and\n\n331\n00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:20.990\nif they're the same, it knows the packet\nmade it over without being modified.\n\n332\n00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:24.560\nIf they don't match, it says, hey, I don't\nlike this packet, I'm gonna drop it.\n\n333\n00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.150\nSend it again.\n\n334\n00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:28.720\nI don't know if it was intentional or\naccidental, but\n\n335\n00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.670\nsomething changed in that packet.\n\n336\n00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:33.970\nI'm gonna ignore it and\nI want you to send it again, all right.\n\n337\n00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:39.110\nSo hashing is used everywhere to\nprovide this level of integrity.\n\n338\n00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:42.880\nAnother thing we can use for\nintegrity is simply auditing.\n\n339\n00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:47.670\nAuditing is a way that I can track\nwhat's going on with these resources.\n\n340\n00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:50.230\nNow, auditing won't prevent changes.\n\n341\n00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.060\nIt's recording what is happening.\n\n342\n00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.790\nSo, if Daniel goes in and\nmakes a change to a document\n\n343\n00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:58.860\nthat he shouldn't be able to change,\nI can audit it.\n\n344\n00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:01.660\nI can have a record of the fact\nthat Daniel made that change\n\n345\n00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.530\nat 11:30 at night when nobody\nshould have been on the system.\n\n346\n00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:07.040\nBut it didn't stop him\nfrom making the change.\n\n347\n00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.000\nIt just gives me the ability to say, oh,\n\n348\n00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.400\nI need to have a talk with\nDaniel in the morning, right.\n\n349\n00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.803\nThat's what auditing is all about.\n\n350\n00:18:13.803 --> 00:18:16.427\nAnd I can show you an example of that,\nas well.\n\n351\n00:18:16.427 --> 00:18:19.880\nI've got, let me see what's going on here.\n\n352\n00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.826\nHow about I go to,\nI'm logged on as administrator right now.\n\n353\n00:18:23.826 --> 00:18:26.605\nI'm gonna navigate back in here.\n\n354\n00:18:26.605 --> 00:18:28.438\nI'm gonna go to this share on my server.\n\n355\n00:18:28.438 --> 00:18:33.416\nSVR01/reports.\n\n356\n00:18:33.416 --> 00:18:36.260\nAnd I'm gonna make\na change to this document.\n\n357\n00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:43.305\nWe'll change that to we\ndid well this quarter.\n\n358\n00:18:43.305 --> 00:18:44.345\nNot much of a report, right?\n\n359\n00:18:44.345 --> 00:18:46.145\nBut it's just for fun.\n\n360\n00:18:46.145 --> 00:18:47.015\nI'll save and close it.\n\n361\n00:18:49.595 --> 00:18:51.870\nAnd now I'm gonna go over to the server.\n\n362\n00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:53.340\nAnd I'm gonna open up its event log.\n\n363\n00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.410\nAnd I'm gonna take a look\nat my security log.\n\n364\n00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:02.710\nAnd there we go.\n\n365\n00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:03.730\nI got an operation.\n\n366\n00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:05.920\nI've got a failure there\nfrom administrator.\n\n367\n00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:06.420\nLet's see here.\n\n368\n00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.970\nOh, I've got the failure,\nthat's kind of interesting.\n\n369\n00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:13.840\nBecause I definitely got access to\nthat document, but it's showing me\n\n370\n00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:17.110\nthings like the administrator was\nthe one that tried to access it.\n\n371\n00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:23.410\nShow me here, write data was not granted.\n\n372\n00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:25.910\nWell, actually it was, so\nthat might be an old event.\n\n373\n00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:29.660\nBut the point is, is it's gonna\nrecord that information in here.\n\n374\n00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:35.060\nI'm gonna have a record of every time\nsomebody goes and accesses that document,\n\n375\n00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:40.310\nevery time somebody goes and makes\na change to one of those documents, right?\n\n376\n00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:43.520\nSo again, not preventing it, but\ngiving me the ability to go back and\n\n377\n00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:47.020\nmaybe one of my other\nintegrity checks failed.\n\n378\n00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:50.610\nIt no longer meets that,\nthe signature no longer matches.\n\n379\n00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:54.640\nNow, I want to go and do more research and\nfind out when that document was changed,\n\n380\n00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:58.060\nwho made that change,\nwhy they were able to make that change.\n\n381\n00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.640\nThose are the kind of things\nI can do with auditing.\n\n382\n00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:05.660\nSo for integrity, we've got access\ncontrol, we've got our hashing and\n\n383\n00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:06.510\nwe've got our auditing.\n\n384\n00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:10.980\nThe last leg of it, Daniel,\nis gonna be availability.\n\n385\n00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.700\nAnd this is one that\nsometimes gets overlooked.\n\n386\n00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:19.470\nIt sometimes doesn't seem to\nfit with the rest, right.\n\n387\n00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:20.780\nWe're talking about confidentiality,\n\n388\n00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:24.390\nintegrity, how is availability\na security method?\n\n389\n00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:29.040\nWell, if my users can't get to\nthat information to do their job,\n\n390\n00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.470\nthen my company isn't going work too well,\nright?\n\n391\n00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:35.490\nAnd we can very easily\ntake security way too far.\n\n392\n00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:41.160\nWe can throw in encryption and\nauthentication methods and access control.\n\n393\n00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:44.900\nWe take it too far,\nthe data's no longer available.\n\n394\n00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.000\nThey can't do their job.\n\n395\n00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.480\nOur company can't function\nwithout that information.\n\n396\n00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.610\nSo availability is a big part of security.\n\n397\n00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:54.470\nIt has to be available.\n\n398\n00:20:54.470 --> 00:21:00.730\nYou know, the old joke is, if you want to\nmake a server bulletproof secure, take it,\n\n399\n00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:04.710\nput it in a mold, fill it with concrete,\nthrow it in the bottom of the ocean.\n\n400\n00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:07.690\nRight, nobody's gonna\nget access to that data.\n\n401\n00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:09.150\nBut it doesn't do anybody any good.\n\n402\n00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:12.090\nRight, how's my company gonna function\nif the file server's in concrete\n\n403\n00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:13.140\non the bottom of the ocean?\n\n404\n00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:14.740\n>> Yeah, we used to make the joke,\nwe'll make it so\n\n405\n00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:17.900\nsecure even we can't access it,\nand that's not what you want.\n\n406\n00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.630\nObviously you need to be\nable to access your data.\n\n407\n00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:23.990\nAnd this is really why that's\na very common venue of attack.\n\n408\n00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:26.305\nThey call this denial of service attacks,\nright.\n\n409\n00:21:26.305 --> 00:21:29.455\nWhere, if you run a website and\nyour website generates money,\n\n410\n00:21:29.455 --> 00:21:32.855\nthat's your business, and\nI now bring your website down.\n\n411\n00:21:32.855 --> 00:21:35.345\nI'm a malicious guy,\nI hacked your website.\n\n412\n00:21:35.345 --> 00:21:36.035\nI bring it down.\n\n413\n00:21:36.035 --> 00:21:37.245\nNo one can access it.\n\n414\n00:21:37.245 --> 00:21:38.335\nHow much money are you making?\n\n415\n00:21:38.335 --> 00:21:39.255\nYou're making none.\n\n416\n00:21:39.255 --> 00:21:40.545\nYou're dead in the water.\n\n417\n00:21:40.545 --> 00:21:44.670\nSo having the ability\nto have data available,\n\n418\n00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:49.050\nlet's not even say it's a website,\nlet's say it's just confidential files.\n\n419\n00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:53.510\nHow to make this product that we make,\nthe formula for it is in this file, and\n\n420\n00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:54.790\nnow I can't get to it.\n\n421\n00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:56.230\nHow good is that file to me?\n\n422\n00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:57.170\nIt's no good.\n\n423\n00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:01.190\nI need access to that data, and that's why\nI can see where this might be overlooked,\n\n424\n00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:03.080\nbut it's probably one of\nthe most important of the three.\n\n425\n00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.090\n>> It really is.\n\n426\n00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:04.610\nRight?\n\n427\n00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:08.340\nOther things that we've gotta think about,\nwhat if a bad guy breaks into our server\n\n428\n00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:11.530\nand starts formatting drives or\nstarts deleting files.\n\n429\n00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:12.870\nWell, as a security person,\n\n430\n00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:15.890\nI need to be able to make sure\nthat that data is available.\n\n431\n00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:21.740\nWhich means I better have taken a backup\nof that server before that happened.\n\n432\n00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:23.530\nSo doing things like backups.\n\n433\n00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:27.830\nDoing things like having redundant copies.\n\n434\n00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:32.210\nUsing hardware to give us fault\ntolerance like a RAID system,\n\n435\n00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:36.270\nwhere if a hard drive fails,\nI don't lose all of my data.\n\n436\n00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:40.550\nThese are all things that I can\ndo to provide that availability.\n\n437\n00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:44.260\nIn Windows, we use clusters on\nour server operating systems so\n\n438\n00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:48.430\nthat if one of those nodes fails, well\nthe server to the network is still up,\n\n439\n00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:52.443\ncuz another node just takes over using\n\n440\n00:22:52.443 --> 00:22:57.620\nHyper-V and\nmoving machines from one node to another.\n\n441\n00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:02.440\nIf one of them fails, all of these\nare ways that I can provide for\n\n442\n00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:07.480\nthat availability,\nhaving those backups, yeah.\n\n443\n00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.250\nAnd when we talk about availability,\n\n444\n00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:13.550\nit's not just deliver, that is one of\nthe first things we all think about is oh,\n\n445\n00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:18.800\nthe bad guys got in, and he's trying\nto wipe out my data or delete my data.\n\n446\n00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.940\nThat's definitely one of the things\nthat we gotta protect against.\n\n447\n00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:25.650\nYou've got an employee that just found\nout they're gonna get terminated, so they\n\n448\n00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:30.510\nstart going in and deleting everything\nthey can before they get escorted out.\n\n449\n00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:33.510\nOr something like that,\nso it can be deliberate.\n\n450\n00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:35.120\nBut it can also be accidental.\n\n451\n00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.040\nIt could be natural, right.\n\n452\n00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:40.674\nPower failures, maybe the people next\nto us are getting some work done,\n\n453\n00:23:40.674 --> 00:23:42.880\nthey're laying down a sprinkler system and\n\n454\n00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.455\nthat backhoe just cut one\nof my fiber optic cables.\n\n455\n00:23:45.455 --> 00:23:47.980\nWell now my information\nis no longer available.\n\n456\n00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.876\nMy customers can't get to\nmy website anymore, right.\n\n457\n00:23:51.876 --> 00:23:53.750\nIt's not available.\n\n458\n00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:57.564\nHere in Florida we have hurricanes\nthat can do some major wind damage and\n\n459\n00:23:57.564 --> 00:24:01.252\nFlood damage, I've got to think\nabout things like that because if it\n\n460\n00:24:01.252 --> 00:24:03.415\ncomes through and floods my building and\n\n461\n00:24:03.415 --> 00:24:06.869\nmy server closet's under water\nmy data is no longer available.\n\n462\n00:24:06.869 --> 00:24:10.552\nSo there can be different natural\ndisasters obviously in different areas of\n\n463\n00:24:10.552 --> 00:24:14.533\nthe world that we have to deal with, but\nsomething that we've got to think about.\n\n464\n00:24:14.533 --> 00:24:15.745\n>> Right.\n>> I've gotta make sure that\n\n465\n00:24:15.745 --> 00:24:16.520\ndata's available.\n\n466\n00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:19.660\nWhether that means maybe\nhaving a cold site or\n\n467\n00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:24.920\na hot site somewhere else that's outside\nof that natural disaster occurrence area.\n\n468\n00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.870\nSo that if something happens I can move.\n\n469\n00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:30.380\nHaving offsite backups,\nputting stuff up in the Cloud.\n\n470\n00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:34.530\nAll of these can help me\nprovide that availability.\n\n471\n00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:37.270\nBut they can be deliberate.\n\n472\n00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:38.510\nI say they can be accidental.\n\n473\n00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:41.870\nIt could be, like I said,\nsomebody runs into a light post and\n\n474\n00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:45.010\ntakes out the power from my building or\nwhat have you.\n\n475\n00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:46.400\nBut it can also be deliberate.\n\n476\n00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.630\nCould be bad guys doing as\nDaniel was saying earlier,\n\n477\n00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:51.500\na denial of service on our web server.\n\n478\n00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:55.415\nWhether if they can send so much data to\nmy web server that my web server can no\n\n479\n00:24:55.415 --> 00:24:58.950\nlonger respond to requests,\nwell now I can't sell my product.\n\n480\n00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:01.330\nMy customers can't get to my website.\n\n481\n00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:03.470\nThat's an availability issue.\n\n482\n00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:03.970\nRight?\n\n483\n00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.910\nThere's several different attacks\nthat they can do to try to do what\n\n484\n00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:13.000\nare called denial of service attacks,\nall important.\n\n485\n00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.770\nSo, it is one of those things\nthat sometimes gets overlooked\n\n486\n00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:21.300\nwhen it comes to security, but\navailability again, a big part of it.\n\n487\n00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:22.720\nWe've gotta have em all.\n\n488\n00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.642\nAs I said at the very beginning,\nthe CIA triad.\n\n489\n00:25:25.642 --> 00:25:27.450\nCIA triad.\n\n490\n00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:29.110\nIt's like a tripod.\n\n491\n00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:33.840\nOne of those legs is out or missing,\nthe whole thing's gonna fall over.\n\n492\n00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.830\nAnd you gotta put equal\nimportance on each one.\n\n493\n00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:39.660\nI like to think of the guy that's got\na tripod where one of the legs is shorter\n\n494\n00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:40.232\nthan the other.\n\n495\n00:25:40.232 --> 00:25:40.744\n>> Tilty.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n496\n00:25:40.744 --> 00:25:42.550\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n497\n00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:44.280\nIt's gonna work.\n\n498\n00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.839\nWe can make it work, but not-\n>> It ain't gonna be pretty.\n\n499\n00:25:46.839 --> 00:25:49.182\n>> [LAUGH] Or comfortable.\n\n500\n00:25:49.182 --> 00:25:51.590\n[LAUGH]\n>> So you've got to provide.\n\n501\n00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:56.440\nYou've got to make sure you're spending\ndue diligence or taking focus on all three\n\n502\n00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:00.570\nof those areas there, confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability.\n\n503\n00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:03.700\nAnd these are really\nthe cornerstones of security.\n\n504\n00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:08.560\nWhen you get into the security field and\nwhen you go to secure a server, when\n\n505\n00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:12.760\nyou go to secure and individual machine,\nwhen you go to secure the entire network,\n\n506\n00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:16.258\nwhen you go to secure the enterprise,\nthese are the things you're looking at.\n\n507\n00:26:16.258 --> 00:26:17.130\nAnd you wanna sit there and\n\n508\n00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:20.600\nyou want to think about how we're\ngonna provide confidentiality?\n\n509\n00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.970\nWhat is the best method?\n\n510\n00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:25.240\nAnd not everything get's\nthe same level of protection.\n\n511\n00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.150\nRight?\nWhen it comes to confidentiality,\n\n512\n00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:29.190\nyou can categorize things.\n\n513\n00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:30.510\nYou might have some documents and\n\n514\n00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:33.180\nsome resources that the public\ncan get access to, right?\n\n515\n00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:34.100\nStuff on my website.\n\n516\n00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:36.340\nI want them to see product descriptions.\n\n517\n00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:39.410\nPictures of the product that\nthey're thinking about ordering.\n\n518\n00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:43.030\nOther information,\nI need to keep a little more confidential.\n\n519\n00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:46.140\nThat's the employee handbook or\nthe employee phone list.\n\n520\n00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:47.270\nAnd things like that, right?\n\n521\n00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:50.690\nEverybody in the company, but\nnobody outside of the company.\n\n522\n00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:54.580\nOther things still might have a higher\nlevel of security or confidentiality\n\n523\n00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:58.660\nassociated, those quarterly\nreports on our profits and losses.\n\n524\n00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:02.740\nAs an employee I might have access to\nthem, but those c level employees do.\n\n525\n00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.064\nAll right?\nMy HR people might or\n\n526\n00:27:04.064 --> 00:27:08.110\nmy budgeting people or whomever,\nthey might have access to it.\n\n527\n00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:11.660\nSo different levels of confidentiality\nthat we've gotta be able to provide.\n\n528\n00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:13.180\nHow are we gonna implement that?\n\n529\n00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:16.730\nWhat are we gonna use that'll\ngive me that level of control?\n\n530\n00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:18.650\nSo you'll go through and\nyou'll classify things.\n\n531\n00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:23.600\nAnd you might make up your own system like\nvery confidential, somewhat confidential,\n\n532\n00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.460\nand not confidential.\n\n533\n00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:30.248\nOr you might go more of a military\nthing and go top secret, confidential,\n\n534\n00:27:30.248 --> 00:27:34.840\nin public, in private or what have you but\ncome up with some system for\n\n535\n00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.170\nconfidentiality.\n\n536\n00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:40.760\nAvailability again making sure that\nthat information is available.\n\n537\n00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:45.620\nThat means doing things like backups and\nclustering, providing full\n\n538\n00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:50.570\ntolerance and making sure that our other\nsecurity methods haven't gone too far.\n\n539\n00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:52.640\nAnd then integrity and\nI kind of went out of order there.\n\n540\n00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:56.410\nBut integrity, making sure that\nthose files aren't modified or\n\n541\n00:27:56.410 --> 00:28:02.160\nthat the resources are not modified or\nat least giving me the ability to detect\n\n542\n00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:05.830\nthat there has been a change, whether\nit was intentional or unintentional.\n\n543\n00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:07.720\nSo CIA triad.\n\n544\n00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:10.700\nConfidentiality and\nintegrity and availability.\n\n545\n00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:11.580\n>> I'll tell you Mike.\n\n546\n00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:15.130\nYou were talking about auditing earlier\nwhen it came to integrity, and it really\n\n547\n00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:20.940\nhit home to me, exactly how important it\nis to not share your information, right?\n\n548\n00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:24.380\nBecause if he had my password,\nmy user name, what could he do?\n\n549\n00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:24.880\nHe could log in.\n\n550\n00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.660\nHe could make changes.\n\n551\n00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:30.550\nNow when the system's administrators,\nwe go to see who made that change.\n\n552\n00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:34.160\nWell if he logged in as me guess who's\ngonna get the finger pointed at them.\n\n553\n00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.480\nI am.\nI used to yell at users all the time for\n\n554\n00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.650\nsharing their data.\n\n555\n00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:42.790\nDo not share your username and\npassword with anyone, keep those things on\n\n556\n00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:46.820\nthe QT as yours, because if anybody\ngoes in and they make a change or\n\n557\n00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:51.280\nthey delete something, and it's done under\nyour name, guess who we're gonna point to?\n\n558\n00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:55.090\nAnd you would really have to come up\nwith some strong evidence to show\n\n559\n00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:56.030\nthat it wasn't you,\n\n560\n00:28:56.030 --> 00:29:00.380\nbecause the computer is telling us that\nit was you through that audit trail.\n\n561\n00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:03.150\n>> Absolutely, you're gonna need a time\nstamp picture from somewhere saying,\n\n562\n00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:05.110\nI was not at that computer.\n\n563\n00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:08.030\nAnd then you're still gonna get in\ntrouble because you gave your password\n\n564\n00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:09.800\nto somebody and\nnow they're logged on as you.\n\n565\n00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:10.590\nSo, yeah.\n\n566\n00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:12.430\nDon't do that.\n\n567\n00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:15.250\n>> Well, Mike it looks like we're\nrunning a little bit out of time and\n\n568\n00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:19.470\nI know we have a lot more stuff to cover,\na lot of really good information, but\n\n569\n00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:21.730\nthat means we're gonna\nhave to do a part two.\n\n570\n00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:23.280\nHopefully we'll see you good people there.\n\n571\n00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.190\nMike, thanks for those demonstrations,\nexplanations that you gave us.\n\n572\n00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:27.410\nReally, really helpful.\n\n573\n00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:30.730\nWe're gonna go on to that part two, as for\nthis episode, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n574\n00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:31.380\nsign off.\n\n575\n00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:34.110\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n576\n00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:34.960\n>> And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n577\n00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.979\n>> We'll see you next

exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.980\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.960\nJoining me again in the studio\nis none other than Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.990\nHow's it going today, Mike?\n\n7\n00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.210\n>> Oh, it's going great Daniel.\n\n8\n00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.810\nI'm excited as always to be here.\n\n9\n00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.410\nWe've got our MTA content\ncoming your way and\n\n10\n00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.310\nin this one we're going to be focusing\nstill on those core security principles.\n\n11\n00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.360\nSo if you missed the last episode,\nmake sure you go back and watch it.\n\n12\n00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.360\nWe're continuing on here.\n\n13\n00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.540\nIn the previous one we really went\nover the basics of the CIA triad,\n\n14\n00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.620\nconfidentiality, integrity and\navailability.\n\n15\n00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.400\nWe're gonna continue that thought process\nwith these core security principles.\n\n16\n00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.970\nAnd now we're gonna start\ntalking about risk matrix,\n\n17\n00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.380\nis the next thing on our list.\n\n18\n00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.510\nAnd we talk about risk matrixes, or\nrisk in general, let's start there.\n\n19\n00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.650\nA risk is the potential for\nsomething to go wrong.\n\n20\n00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.130\nThat's a very layman's term of it, right?\n\n21\n00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.850\nBut when we look at our systems,\n\n22\n00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.660\nwe've gotta think about all of the things\nthat threaten those systems, right?\n\n23\n00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.400\nThose are known as risks.\n\n24\n00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.390\nAnd we have to list them all out.\n\n25\n00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.220\nAnd then we start looking at,\nwhat is the likelihood\n\n26\n00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.430\nof each of these risks coming to fruition,\nand we also have to think about\n\n27\n00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.220\nwhat the impact of that risk would be,\nif it did happen.\n\n28\n00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.910\nSo like for example here in Florida,\n\n29\n00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.760\nwe might think of things like well there's\nthe risk of a hurricane coming through.\n\n30\n00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.370\nWell the likelihood of a hurricane\nhitting our building where we are,\n\n31\n00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.790\nmaybe is not so great.\n\n32\n00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.390\nI mean we're in Florida, so\nit's going to be greater than say,\n\n33\n00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.050\nsomebody that was living\nup in North Dakota, and\n\n34\n00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.650\nthey have a data center there and\nthey're doing their risk assessment.\n\n35\n00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.110\nAll right, so it is gonna be greater for\nus here in Florida, but still might be not\n\n36\n00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.780\nextremely likely, it's not like it\nhappens every year or every month.\n\n37\n00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.820\nSo we would put that in\nits place on our list.\n\n38\n00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.515\nAnd we have to think about\nthe impact that it might have.\n\n39\n00:02:06.515 --> 00:02:09.980\nWell, if a hurricane does hit us and\ncomes right through Gainesville,\n\n40\n00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:14.730\nFlorida, we know we're gonna be without\npower, we're gonna have flood damage.\n\n41\n00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.920\nSo, we're gonna have some\nserious damage to contend with.\n\n42\n00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.510\nThose are the kind of things that we\ndo when we look at risk assessment.\n\n43\n00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.858\nAnd not just natural, I mean we have\nto think about power failures, or\n\n44\n00:02:25.858 --> 00:02:28.744\na bad guy doing a data\nbreach on our web server.\n\n45\n00:02:28.744 --> 00:02:30.940\nThese are all risks that we have to face.\n\n46\n00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.190\nYou look at your file server.\n\n47\n00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.750\nWhat are risks that we\nhave with our file server?\n\n48\n00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.124\nWell, power.\n\n49\n00:02:36.124 --> 00:02:39.700\nI could have a power failure, that file\nserver is not gonna do me any good.\n\n50\n00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.110\nHardware failures,\nthose are going to occur.\n\n51\n00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.580\nWhat is the likelihood of\nthat hard drive failing?\n\n52\n00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.424\nIt's going to happen at some point, right.\n\n53\n00:02:47.424 --> 00:02:50.303\nData corruption could occur.\n\n54\n00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:53.340\nAny of these things, so those are the\nkinds of things we're talking about.\n\n55\n00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.870\nAnd so,\nrisk assessment is really sitting down and\n\n56\n00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.500\ngoing through all the different\nthings that put our data at risk.\n\n57\n00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.860\nAnd it really depends\non what you're doing.\n\n58\n00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.130\nYou could be doing\na hardware risk assessment.\n\n59\n00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.520\nSoftware risk assessment,\n\n60\n00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.180\nyour building, all of it has\nto go through risk assessment.\n\n61\n00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.369\nAnd we list all that out, and\nthen we start putting it together in some\n\n62\n00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:20.330\nmeaningful fashion, and that's where\nthe risk matrix comes into play.\n\n63\n00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.630\nSo your risk assessment\nis your evaluation.\n\n64\n00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.950\nI mean, there's the risk that I\ncould get hit by a bus tomorrow and\n\n65\n00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.660\nI might not make it into work.\n\n66\n00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.210\nAnd so\nthe impact of that would be Daniel's\n\n67\n00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.200\ngonna be standing here all alone going,\nso Michael, what do we got for today?\n\n68\n00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.780\nAnd he's not gonna get much of a response.\n\n69\n00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:38.823\n>> That's about normal, right?\n\n70\n00:03:38.823 --> 00:03:43.770\n>> [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n>> I kid the Mike, it's fun to do.\n\n71\n00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.110\nBut he's exactly right.\n\n72\n00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.024\nWe gotta kind of go through what we think\nare very probable to least probable\n\n73\n00:03:50.024 --> 00:03:53.480\nthreats to our business and\nour continuity.\n\n74\n00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.490\nAnd figure out, what do we do in\ncase that kind of thing happens?\n\n75\n00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:57.590\nAre we safe?\n\n76\n00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.720\nCan we survive a complete data\nloss on our main systems?\n\n77\n00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.000\nIs that a possibility?\n\n78\n00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.040\nWhen Mike's talking about risk assessment,\nthat spectrum varies very, very widely.\n\n79\n00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.660\nYou could really be a full time job just\nsitting around, trying to figure out,\n\n80\n00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.590\nokay, well here's what this\ncompany has as far as assets go.\n\n81\n00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.470\nHere are the threats to those assets and\nhere's how we can mitigate those assets,\n\n82\n00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.098\nand that's basically what we're doing when\nyou're talking the risk major, correct?\n\n83\n00:04:23.098 --> 00:04:24.910\n>> Yeah, absolutely, and Daniel puts it so\n\n84\n00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.100\nwell that it's going to vary\nin situation to situation.\n\n85\n00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.470\nIf I'm a business and I've got a website\nthat's just informational, tells you about\n\n86\n00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.820\nmy company, it tells you where we're\nphysically located, and it's got some\n\n87\n00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:40.340\nphone numbers on there that you could use\nto contact us or whatever, and that's it.\n\n88\n00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.050\nWell, if that web server goes down,\nmy business is still functioning, right.\n\n89\n00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.440\nMaybe we're a brick and mortar store and\nthat's more about advertising and\n\n90\n00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.400\ngetting some kind of online presence.\n\n91\n00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.190\nIf I'm Amazon, however, and\n\n92\n00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.350\nmy web servers are unavailable,\nit's gonna cost me big bucks, right.\n\n93\n00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.090\nSo they're gonna put more effort into\nprotecting those web servers than\n\n94\n00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.520\nthat first business I used.\n\n95\n00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.210\nAnd we're not gonna spend a lot of money\nprotecting those resources because\n\n96\n00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.350\nthe impact is not that great.\n\n97\n00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.460\nSo being able to sit down and\ngo over all those risks, and\n\n98\n00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.450\nthe threats that face those risks, and\n\n99\n00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.370\nthe likelihood and the impact,\nthat's what risk assessment is all about.\n\n100\n00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.906\nWhen we start dumping it into a matrix,\nand\n\n101\n00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:26.159\nmatrix is just a fancy word for a chart.\n\n102\n00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.682\nWhen we start doing it,\nwhen we're putting it in our charts,\n\n103\n00:05:28.682 --> 00:05:30.779\nwe can do it a couple of different ways,\nall right.\n\n104\n00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:33.876\nWe can do what we call\nqualitative analysis or\n\n105\n00:05:33.876 --> 00:05:36.570\nwe can do quantitative risk analysis.\n\n106\n00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:38.870\nAnd both of them have their place.\n\n107\n00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.460\nAnd sometimes we combine them or\nsometimes we do both.\n\n108\n00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.630\nBut we do a qualitative,\nwe're really using very general terms.\n\n109\n00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:52.230\nLike when I say that the likelihood,\nwe might have a scale of rare,\n\n110\n00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:56.050\nunlikely, possible, likely, certain.\n\n111\n00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.920\nRight, and for our consequence\nit could be very low, to low,\n\n112\n00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.120\nto medium, to high, to very high, right?\n\n113\n00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.040\nSo we're not really using kind of dollar\nvalues or percentages or numbers.\n\n114\n00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.910\nThat's what we mean by qualitative.\n\n115\n00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.870\nWe're gonna qualify what it means to us,\nand that can vary, right?\n\n116\n00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.790\nThere's no set thing.\n\n117\n00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:24.800\nWhat's high severity to you might\nnot be high severity to me.\n\n118\n00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.780\nAnd what means high severity, right?\n\n119\n00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.390\nNot only,\n\n120\n00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:32.650\nlike we take that web server thing to\none business, the severity was very low.\n\n121\n00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.764\nIf we lose that page, oh well.\n\n122\n00:06:34.764 --> 00:06:36.830\nI mean people can still come in and\nbuy product.\n\n123\n00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.720\nSo I had a very low severity.\n\n124\n00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.450\nAmazon, however, same thing.\n\n125\n00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.880\nWeb server risk of denial of service\nattacks is going to be very high severity,\n\n126\n00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.230\nbecause they rely on that web\nserver to do all of their business.\n\n127\n00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:53.040\nSo, that same threat is\ngonna mean different things\n\n128\n00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.620\nto different organizations.\n\n129\n00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.900\nSo that's why we have to do this.\n\n130\n00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.860\nThere is no chart I can go out and\nget and say this is the way it is.\n\n131\n00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.340\nIt's not set in stone.\n\n132\n00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.630\nIt depends on your situation and\nyour environment.\n\n133\n00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.710\nAnd that's why we have to go through and\ndo this risk.\n\n134\n00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:13.210\nAnd then the outcome of this is deciding,\nas Daniel said, what we're gonna do about.\n\n135\n00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:17.500\nHow do we mitigate those risks,\nlessen the likelihood, or\n\n136\n00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.560\nlessen the impact of those risks?\n\n137\n00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.063\nSo back to the qualitative analysis,\nI got a little chart here and\n\n138\n00:07:24.063 --> 00:07:27.134\nthis is a very typical risk\nmatrix that you might make up.\n\n139\n00:07:27.134 --> 00:07:31.674\nAcross the top I've got likelihood,\nI've got my qualitative descriptors, Rare,\n\n140\n00:07:31.674 --> 00:07:34.700\nUnlikely, Possible, Likely, Certain.\n\n141\n00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.770\nAnd then down the side here,\n\n142\n00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:41.910\nI've got the consequence from very low\nall the way up to very high severity.\n\n143\n00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:46.958\nAnd so when we're plotting these things,\nwe try to find where they would intersect.\n\n144\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:51.330\nLike the web server might have a very\nlow severity for business one, right,\n\n145\n00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:56.044\nwhere it's just an information page, but\nthe likelihood maybe comes over here to\n\n146\n00:07:56.044 --> 00:08:00.714\npossible or likely, because we know\nwebsites are a favorite target of attacks.\n\n147\n00:08:00.714 --> 00:08:04.233\nSo maybe we plot it Somewhere around here.\n\n148\n00:08:04.233 --> 00:08:09.600\nA hurricane in Florida,\nthe likelihood is a possible,\n\n149\n00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.950\nand the severity could be very high,\nright?\n\n150\n00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:16.445\nSo it might put it up in this box up here.\n\n151\n00:08:16.445 --> 00:08:19.521\nAnd again, you might be thinking, well,,\nMichael you should put that in very high.\n\n152\n00:08:19.521 --> 00:08:20.810\nThat's fine, you can do that, right?\n\n153\n00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:24.426\nThis is a very subjective process\nthat we're going through,\n\n154\n00:08:24.426 --> 00:08:27.148\nwhich is why most likely\nit won't be just you.\n\n155\n00:08:27.148 --> 00:08:30.106\nYou're going to have many people\nfrom the business coming in and\n\n156\n00:08:30.106 --> 00:08:33.833\ngetting together and thinking about this,\nbecause they're going to have input\n\n157\n00:08:33.833 --> 00:08:36.965\nthat maybe you didn't realize,\nand things like that.\n\n158\n00:08:36.965 --> 00:08:43.005\nSo, the qualitative, again, we're just\nusing terms like, unlikely or likely.\n\n159\n00:08:43.005 --> 00:08:48.500\nHigh severity or low severity to figure\nout where we can place it in this matrix.\n\n160\n00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.670\nAnd then, what we do is we focus\non the ones that were up here.\n\n161\n00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:55.710\nThis is where I wanna spend my time on.\n\n162\n00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.479\nBecause they've got a high severity.\n\n163\n00:08:57.479 --> 00:09:00.078\nIf they do happen, it's gonna cost us.\n\n164\n00:09:00.078 --> 00:09:02.929\nThis can have a big impact,\nmaybe not just monetarily, but\n\n165\n00:09:02.929 --> 00:09:04.362\na big impact on our business.\n\n166\n00:09:04.362 --> 00:09:08.113\nAnd the likelihood of it\noccurring is very good.\n\n167\n00:09:08.113 --> 00:09:10.780\nSo, this is where I wanna\nspend my effort and my money.\n\n168\n00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:14.540\nDown here, I'm not so\nworried about these, because sure,\n\n169\n00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:19.790\nit's a risk you might put down here, let's\nsay a meteorite crashes into the building.\n\n170\n00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:22.448\nWell, the likelihood of\nthat happening is rare.\n\n171\n00:09:22.448 --> 00:09:24.446\nI guess the impact on that might be high.\n\n172\n00:09:24.446 --> 00:09:25.055\nI don't know.\nSo\n\n173\n00:09:25.055 --> 00:09:28.980\nmaybe we shouldn't put that one up there,\nbut the likelihood would be rare.\n\n174\n00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.948\nSo even though it's got a very high\nseverity I still might not spend a lot of\n\n175\n00:09:32.948 --> 00:09:34.171\ntime on that, right?\n\n176\n00:09:34.171 --> 00:09:37.250\nBecause of the fact that\nit's never gonna occur.\n\n177\n00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:40.420\nNow, that's not the only type\nof risk analysis we can do.\n\n178\n00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.810\nWe can also do a quantitative\nrisk analysis.\n\n179\n00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:46.233\nAnd this is where you start\nbreaking out numbers.\n\n180\n00:09:46.233 --> 00:09:51.141\nAll right, where we start figuring out,\nreally, in dollar values or whatever\n\n181\n00:09:51.141 --> 00:09:55.628\nour scale is what that consequence\nmight be and what that likelihood is.\n\n182\n00:09:55.628 --> 00:10:01.151\nAnd you can see here on this one I've\nmade, and again, this can vary between\n\n183\n00:10:01.151 --> 00:10:06.610\ndifferent businesses from less than\n5000 to 50 million and higher.\n\n184\n00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:13.378\nFor my likelihood,\nless than one thousandth of a percent,\n\n185\n00:10:13.378 --> 00:10:15.316\nall the way up to 1.\n\n186\n00:10:15.316 --> 00:10:20.420\nAnd really, this is more of a scale of 0\nto 1 is what they're doing with this here.\n\n187\n00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:25.093\nAll right, so this might be a percentage,\nbut same thing.\n\n188\n00:10:25.093 --> 00:10:27.147\nWe're gonna classify that.\n\n189\n00:10:27.147 --> 00:10:29.352\nWhere does it fit on this scale?\n\n190\n00:10:29.352 --> 00:10:31.043\nWell, if that meteor hits us,\n\n191\n00:10:31.043 --> 00:10:34.309\nthe likelihood is probably\nsomewhere in this column here.\n\n192\n00:10:34.309 --> 00:10:38.252\nBut the impact, if we lose everything,\nwe've got $2 million billing,\n\n193\n00:10:38.252 --> 00:10:41.705\nI've got another $1 million in\nequipment and stuff like that.\n\n194\n00:10:41.705 --> 00:10:43.527\nSo, maybe it's somewhere around here.\n\n195\n00:10:43.527 --> 00:10:46.701\nThat hurricane,\nthe likelihood is much greater, and\n\n196\n00:10:46.701 --> 00:10:50.226\nthe damage might be about the same,\nwe'd lose everything.\n\n197\n00:10:50.226 --> 00:10:55.040\nSo maybe somewhere around here,\nsame concept.\n\n198\n00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.725\nNow I know where to spend my money,\nwhere to spend my time and\n\n199\n00:10:59.725 --> 00:11:02.371\neffort focusing on these risks.\n\n200\n00:11:02.371 --> 00:11:06.720\nI'm not gonna spend millions of dollars\nputting up an asteroid shield or\n\n201\n00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.513\na meteorite shield, right?\n\n202\n00:11:08.513 --> 00:11:11.190\nBecause it was way over\nhere in no likelihood.\n\n203\n00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.576\nSo those are the kind of\nthings we can think about.\n\n204\n00:11:14.576 --> 00:11:16.614\nYou can also start combining them, but\n\n205\n00:11:16.614 --> 00:11:21.121\nthis gets a little less effective when you\ntry to use both, because it just, usually,\n\n206\n00:11:21.121 --> 00:11:25.290\nyou want to sick with one or the other,\neither quantitative, or qualitative.\n\n207\n00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.066\nAnd you can do both, typically,\nwe don't see them in the same chart.\n\n208\n00:11:28.066 --> 00:11:29.900\nBut, I thought I throw it up there for\nyou guys anyways.\n\n209\n00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.914\nSo those are the risk matrices.\n\n210\n00:11:32.914 --> 00:11:36.617\nNow, as Daniel pointed out,\nwhat do we do with this information?\n\n211\n00:11:36.617 --> 00:11:40.129\nWhat do we do once we've\nplotted everything out, and\n\n212\n00:11:40.129 --> 00:11:44.198\ngiven it some kind of scale, or\nsome kind of risk factor here?\n\n213\n00:11:44.198 --> 00:11:45.830\nAnd that's mitigation.\n\n214\n00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.910\nMitigation is dealing with it, right?\n\n215\n00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.521\nThe ones that were up here\nin this top right corner,\n\n216\n00:11:50.521 --> 00:11:53.033\nthose are the ones that I\nwant to deal with first.\n\n217\n00:11:53.033 --> 00:11:55.100\nWe've got our priority list now.\n\n218\n00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.075\nThese are the ones that I'm\ngonna spend more time on and\n\n219\n00:11:58.075 --> 00:12:02.343\nmore money on to protect against,\nbecause they're very likely to happen, or\n\n220\n00:12:02.343 --> 00:12:06.770\ncertain that they're gonna happen and\nthe impact is gonna be huge.\n\n221\n00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:07.716\nThat's where I spend my money.\n\n222\n00:12:07.716 --> 00:12:10.183\nAnd that's really what the big\nadvantage of doing it,\n\n223\n00:12:10.183 --> 00:12:12.498\nthis is that it gives me\nthe ability to prioritize.\n\n224\n00:12:12.498 --> 00:12:15.080\nNow, as far as how what we do about them?\n\n225\n00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.991\nWell, when we look at risk analysis,\n\n226\n00:12:16.991 --> 00:12:20.238\nthere's really four main things\nyou can do with risk analysis.\n\n227\n00:12:20.238 --> 00:12:22.960\nYou can avoid it altogether.\n\n228\n00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.870\nIf it's hurricanes, for example,\nwell, I can move to North Dakota.\n\n229\n00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:30.362\nI don't know when the last\ntime they had a hurricane was.\n\n230\n00:12:30.362 --> 00:12:33.890\n>> Probably a rare occurrence up in\nthe Dakotas there with the hurricanes.\n\n231\n00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:36.277\n>> So\nwe can just avoid the risk altogether.\n\n232\n00:12:36.277 --> 00:12:38.710\nThat way,\nwe don't have to do anything about it.\n\n233\n00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:41.323\nThat's always one possibility.\n\n234\n00:12:41.323 --> 00:12:44.168\nNot always a possibility,\nlike if you're doing computer networks.\n\n235\n00:12:44.168 --> 00:12:46.466\nWell, there's a risk of power failure.\n\n236\n00:12:46.466 --> 00:12:49.252\nOkay, we're gonna stop using power,\nthat way, we won't have to deal.\n\n237\n00:12:49.252 --> 00:12:51.725\nYou're not gonna have much of\na network left, right, if you do that.\n\n238\n00:12:51.725 --> 00:12:54.627\nSo, some things you're not\ngonna be able to avoid.\n\n239\n00:12:54.627 --> 00:12:59.491\nBut avoidance is one option\nwhen it comes to risk response.\n\n240\n00:12:59.491 --> 00:13:02.820\nAnother one is going to be acceptance,\nright?\n\n241\n00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:06.654\nWhat would be a good\nexample of acceptance?\n\n242\n00:13:06.654 --> 00:13:08.478\nWell, we've got an office here in Florida.\n\n243\n00:13:08.478 --> 00:13:10.542\nWe know there's hurricanes, right?\n\n244\n00:13:10.542 --> 00:13:13.970\nThere's a likelihood that a hurricane\ncomes through and hits us.\n\n245\n00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:18.867\nWe don't have sandbags up around\nthe building 24 hours a day,\n\n246\n00:13:18.867 --> 00:13:21.217\n7 days a week, right,\nor anything like that.\n\n247\n00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:22.853\nWe're just accepting the risk.\n\n248\n00:13:22.853 --> 00:13:26.281\nWe know by putting our data center and\nour building here in Florida,\n\n249\n00:13:26.281 --> 00:13:28.930\nthat we face the risk of hurricane,\nall right?\n\n250\n00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:30.661\nBut we're choosing to do nothing about it.\n\n251\n00:13:30.661 --> 00:13:32.578\nOr maybe I do choose to\ndo something about it.\n\n252\n00:13:32.578 --> 00:13:36.118\nMaybe we make backup generators,\nand alternate power supplies, and\n\n253\n00:13:36.118 --> 00:13:37.499\nthings like that, right?\n\n254\n00:13:37.499 --> 00:13:41.281\nOr they would make the building out\nof concrete and block and mortar, and\n\n255\n00:13:41.281 --> 00:13:43.639\nthings like that to help\nmitigate that risk.\n\n256\n00:13:43.639 --> 00:13:48.377\nSo acceptance is just the fact that,\nhey, I'm gonna deal with it.\n\n257\n00:13:48.377 --> 00:13:50.780\nI know there's that risk out there, and\n\n258\n00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:53.613\nI'm just choosing not to\ndo anything about it.\n\n259\n00:13:53.613 --> 00:13:58.062\nMitigation, I don't like the way\nthey use mitigating here as far as\n\n260\n00:13:58.062 --> 00:13:59.476\na possible outcome.\n\n261\n00:13:59.476 --> 00:14:01.297\nBecause to me,\nthe whole thing is mitigating.\n\n262\n00:14:01.297 --> 00:14:03.770\nMitigating is doing something about it.\n\n263\n00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:06.900\nSo, I don't know why that's\nlisted as a response there.\n\n264\n00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:11.241\n>> The fact that you built a concrete\nbuilding and put stuff around it,\n\n265\n00:14:11.241 --> 00:14:13.311\nmaybe hurricane-safe glass.\n\n266\n00:14:13.311 --> 00:14:15.191\nThese are mitigating factors.\n\n267\n00:14:15.191 --> 00:14:18.022\nYou're saying, okay, I accept\nthe fact that I live in Florida and\n\n268\n00:14:18.022 --> 00:14:19.980\nthat hurricanes are a possibility.\n\n269\n00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.900\nNow, mitigation is gonna be my next step.\n\n270\n00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.863\nI've decided to build my business here.\n\n271\n00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:26.962\nI'm gonna take those steps that\nMike just talked about, and\n\n272\n00:14:26.962 --> 00:14:28.681\nthat's basically mitigation.\n\n273\n00:14:28.681 --> 00:14:29.550\nBut, he's right.\n\n274\n00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:32.030\nEverything we're doing is mitigation.\n\n275\n00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:34.270\nIt's just part of the overall process.\n\n276\n00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:36.162\n>> I guess we got to\nreally look at mitigation.\n\n277\n00:14:36.162 --> 00:14:37.985\nWe have to define it in\ntwo different ways, right?\n\n278\n00:14:37.985 --> 00:14:42.082\nOne, the whole concept of risk\nanalysis and making these matrices and\n\n279\n00:14:42.082 --> 00:14:44.234\ndoing some thing about those risks,\n\n280\n00:14:44.234 --> 00:14:49.010\nchoosing what we want to do in\na response to those risks is mitigation.\n\n281\n00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:52.343\nOne of the optional\nresponses is mitigation.\n\n282\n00:14:52.343 --> 00:14:54.060\nAvoidance is one.\n\n283\n00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.455\nTo me,\nthat is a type of mitigation though.\n\n284\n00:14:56.455 --> 00:15:00.018\nI'm choosing to move to North Dakota\nwhere I don't have to deal with\n\n285\n00:15:00.018 --> 00:15:01.214\nhurricanes, right?\n\n286\n00:15:01.214 --> 00:15:04.750\nBut it ends when we talk about the actual\nresponses, acceptance, avoidance,\n\n287\n00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:05.740\nmitigation.\n\n288\n00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.449\nMitigation means we're actually\ndoing something about it, all right?\n\n289\n00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:12.052\nFor example, there is a risk that\nsomebody breaks into my building and\n\n290\n00:15:12.052 --> 00:15:14.330\ntries to steal my hard drives.\n\n291\n00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:18.618\nWell, we've mitigated that risk by\ninstalling alarms, installing cameras,\n\n292\n00:15:18.618 --> 00:15:21.655\ninstalling locks on the doors right,\nthings like that.\n\n293\n00:15:21.655 --> 00:15:25.350\nUsing BitLocker to protect that data\nif the event that they are stolen,\n\n294\n00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:27.575\nthey make it through all these processes.\n\n295\n00:15:27.575 --> 00:15:31.732\nSo mitigation is the one where we\nreally try to do something about it.\n\n296\n00:15:31.732 --> 00:15:36.398\nWe put some type of control in place\nto protect ourselves against that risk.\n\n297\n00:15:36.398 --> 00:15:39.440\nBecause we've determined that there's\na good chance it's gonna happen.\n\n298\n00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.399\nThe impact is high enough to where\nI wanna do something about it.\n\n299\n00:15:42.399 --> 00:15:47.303\nSo now, I'm willing to spend\nmoney on trying to prevent it, or\n\n300\n00:15:47.303 --> 00:15:51.014\nreduce the likelihood,\nor reduce the impact.\n\n301\n00:15:51.014 --> 00:15:54.630\nPutting those locks on the door\nreduces the likelihood\n\n302\n00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:57.310\nof somebody breaking into my building.\n\n303\n00:15:57.310 --> 00:16:01.361\nBitLocker in protecting my drives\nreduces the likelihood of somebody\n\n304\n00:16:01.361 --> 00:16:02.464\ngetting the data.\n\n305\n00:16:02.464 --> 00:16:05.540\nDoesn't reduce the likelihood of\nsomebody stealing the data in the first\n\n306\n00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:06.289\nplace, though.\n\n307\n00:16:06.289 --> 00:16:07.025\nDidn't do anything for that.\n\n308\n00:16:07.025 --> 00:16:08.378\nThey're still gonna take the drives.\n\n309\n00:16:08.378 --> 00:16:09.666\nThey're just gonna get home and\n\n310\n00:16:09.666 --> 00:16:11.961\nbe very disappointed that\nthey can't access that data.\n\n311\n00:16:11.961 --> 00:16:15.114\n>> So being kind of proactive instead\nof reactive to the situation,\n\n312\n00:16:15.114 --> 00:16:19.242\nyou're saying okay, I know that these are\npossibilities of things that could happen\n\n313\n00:16:19.242 --> 00:16:21.970\nthat could damage my company,\ndamage my data.\n\n314\n00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:24.550\nI'm gonna take measures before they occur\n\n315\n00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:27.560\nto try to keep that from being\nas bad as it possibly could be.\n\n316\n00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.610\n>> Exactly right.\n\n317\n00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:32.070\nAnd we can't protect against all risks,\nthat's the problem that we face.\n\n318\n00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:34.950\nWe cannot do away with all risk, right?\n\n319\n00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:38.540\nI can't stop hurricanes,\nI can't stop bad guys from trying to\n\n320\n00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:42.010\nbreak into my web server and\nsteal my customers' information.\n\n321\n00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:46.770\nI can't stop it, so that's why we do this,\nis we figure out what the likelihood,\n\n322\n00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:48.950\nwhat the impact is, and\nthen we can budget.\n\n323\n00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:54.250\nWe can decide, is it worth building\nthat meteorite shield, right?\n\n324\n00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:55.936\nDo we wanna put our money there?\n\n325\n00:16:55.936 --> 00:16:58.415\n>> [LAUGH] I think so,\nI'm all for that plan.\n\n326\n00:16:58.415 --> 00:17:00.303\n>> [LAUGH] Where'd you\nput your tinfoil hat?\n\n327\n00:17:00.303 --> 00:17:03.136\nI know you got one around here somewhere.\n\n328\n00:17:03.136 --> 00:17:04.087\n>> [LAUGH] The government.\n\n329\n00:17:04.087 --> 00:17:08.080\n>> [LAUGH] Right, and\nthen the last one that we have for\n\n330\n00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:11.210\noptions of ways to deal\nwith the risk is transfer.\n\n331\n00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:13.090\nI can simply put it off\nonto somebody else.\n\n332\n00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:13.810\n>> Pass the buck.\n\n333\n00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:15.860\n>> Pass the buck, exactly.\n\n334\n00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:19.760\nInsurance is the most common\nform of transference.\n\n335\n00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.570\nIs I can buy insurance,\nI could buy life insurance.\n\n336\n00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:28.390\nDaniel is a key component to these\nshows that we produce here at ITProTV.\n\n337\n00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:32.700\nIf he disappears, that's gonna\nhave a big impact on our business.\n\n338\n00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.575\nWell, I could buy life insurance for\nDaniel.\n\n339\n00:17:35.575 --> 00:17:40.575\nAnd now if, God forbid, something happens\nto Daniel, we've got money [LAUGH].\n\n340\n00:17:40.575 --> 00:17:42.745\nHow does that work out anyway?\n\n341\n00:17:42.745 --> 00:17:45.060\nI don't know, doesn't sound too\nbeneficial for any of us, right.\n\n342\n00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.195\n>> [LAUGH] Plotting my death already,\nsounds great.\n\n343\n00:17:47.195 --> 00:17:49.370\n[LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n344\n00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:51.800\ninsurance is one of\nthose things we can do.\n\n345\n00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:56.040\nTheft of all of our equipment\nis a risk that we face, right?\n\n346\n00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:59.350\nWe've already mitigated it to some\nextent by putting alarms and cameras and\n\n347\n00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:02.760\ndoors on there, but\nthat still doesn't remove the risk, right.\n\n348\n00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:08.370\nIt's still there, but\nnow maybe the likelihood is a little less.\n\n349\n00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:10.750\nBut the impact is still very high.\n\n350\n00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:14.890\nSo maybe we choose to take another step,\nand we buy insurance.\n\n351\n00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:17.230\nAnd now we've transferred\nthe risk to somebody else.\n\n352\n00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:20.296\nIf somebody steals it, well,\nI'm paying my insurance bill, so\n\n353\n00:18:20.296 --> 00:18:22.800\nit's not like it's not\ncosting me anything.\n\n354\n00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.015\nBut they're gonna be the ones that have\nto go out and buy new equipment and\n\n355\n00:18:26.015 --> 00:18:28.597\nreplace all of their equipment,\nand things like that, so\n\n356\n00:18:28.597 --> 00:18:31.690\ninsurance is a very common\nform of transference.\n\n357\n00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:34.640\nYou could outsource something, right?\n\n358\n00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:39.470\nBackups are a way to protect\nagainst the risk of data loss.\n\n359\n00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:41.610\nI could transfer that\nrisk to somebody else.\n\n360\n00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:43.890\nI could store all my data up in the cloud.\n\n361\n00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:44.950\nI'm not backing that stuff up,\n\n362\n00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:47.630\nthat cloud service provider\nis backing that up, right?\n\n363\n00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:51.200\nI've now transferred my risk up to them.\n\n364\n00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.620\nThat up time on my web server is a risk.\n\n365\n00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:57.090\nIf it goes down,\nI don't get to sell any product.\n\n366\n00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:00.070\nIf I move out to the cloud,\nI've now transferred the risk of\n\n367\n00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:03.150\ndowntime on my server to those\ncloud service providers.\n\n368\n00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:04.310\nI'm paying them.\n\n369\n00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:09.420\nI've got an SLA with them that they say\nthey're gonna guarantee me 99.99% up time.\n\n370\n00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.200\nI'm transferring that risk to them.\n\n371\n00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.850\nThey have to worry about how they're going\nto provide that four level of nines.\n\n372\n00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:17.770\nSo you've got four responses when\nit comes to dealing with your\n\n373\n00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:20.580\nrisks after you've gone and\nmade your matrix.\n\n374\n00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:26.290\nYou've got your acceptance,\navoidance, mitigation and transfer.\n\n375\n00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:30.275\nAll right now, next thing, Daniel, that\nwas a whole lot of talk about risk, there.\n\n376\n00:19:30.275 --> 00:19:35.950\nPrinciple of least privilege,\nanother core tenant of security.\n\n377\n00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:40.780\nAnd this just means I 'm only gonna\ngive you what you need to do your job\n\n378\n00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:41.310\nand nothing more.\n\n379\n00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.750\nWay back in the day we didn't\nfollow this all that much and\n\n380\n00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:48.710\nyou would walk into a network and\nyou would find that all of the employees\n\n381\n00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:51.230\nwere administrators on\ntheir local machine.\n\n382\n00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:54.880\nBecause as IT people, we got tired of\nhaving to try to install software for\n\n383\n00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.520\nthem and drivers and things like that,\n\n384\n00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:00.340\njust make them an administrator,\nthat way they can do whatever they want.\n\n385\n00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:03.890\nWell, that's also the downside of\ndoing a strategy like that, right?\n\n386\n00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:04.940\nThey can do whatever they want.\n\n387\n00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:06.512\nThey can install the wrong driver and\n\n388\n00:20:06.512 --> 00:20:09.820\nblue screen their computer,\nnow we gotta fix that, right?\n\n389\n00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.085\n>> They love to download viruses,\nthose are fun.\n\n390\n00:20:12.085 --> 00:20:13.470\n[LAUGH]\n>> They do love it.\n\n391\n00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:14.770\nIf they're an admin,\n\n392\n00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:17.980\nthat virus is now running with\nadministrative credential, right?\n\n393\n00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:20.990\nSo we only want to give them\nwhat they need to do their job.\n\n394\n00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:24.160\nWe're not trying to lock them down and\nmake it hard for them to work.\n\n395\n00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:24.950\nI want them to work,\n\n396\n00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:28.770\nI want them to make our company money,\nI wanna get paid, right?\n\n397\n00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:32.420\nBut I don't want them being able to do\nthings that they have no business doing\n\n398\n00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:37.520\nbecause they're gonna either deliberately\ntake advantage of those extra credentials\n\n399\n00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.650\nthat you've given them, or permissions,\nor rights or what have you and\n\n400\n00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:44.710\ndo something malicious, or\naccidentally they're gonna do something.\n\n401\n00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:47.510\nAnd, again,\nit's still gonna cause the same problem.\n\n402\n00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:52.600\nSo by controlling what level of access\nthey have, by giving them just what they\n\n403\n00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:58.710\nneed to do their job,\nwe can help secure our systems.\n\n404\n00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:05.538\nNow, in a Windows environment how do we\nimplement principle of least privilege?\n\n405\n00:21:05.538 --> 00:21:11.070\nIt sounds great, but if you've got 1,000,\n10,000, 100,000 employees,\n\n406\n00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:16.560\ntrying to figure out what each person\nneeds is gonna be a logistical nightmare.\n\n407\n00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.470\nAnd trying to keep track of it.\n\n408\n00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:22.420\nAnd as you hire new people, trying to\nfigure that out, things like that.\n\n409\n00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:26.716\nIt's just not gonna work, so\nwe use what we call security groups.\n\n410\n00:21:26.716 --> 00:21:34.030\nGroups are membership lists, and I can\nassign rights and permissions to groups.\n\n411\n00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:38.310\nSo if I have 1,000 sales people,\nwell rather than trying to give\n\n412\n00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:40.500\neach one of those people\nindividually all the rights and\n\n413\n00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:44.500\npermissions that they need,\nI'm gonna put all those people in a group.\n\n414\n00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:48.390\nAnd then I'm gonna give that group\nthe rights and permissions that it needs.\n\n415\n00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:50.220\nAnd now I've simplified the process.\n\n416\n00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:53.980\nI've made it to where I can now do\nprinciple of least privilege and\n\n417\n00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.570\nnot pull all my hair out, right.\n\n418\n00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:59.300\nIf we hire ten new people next week that\nare working in the sales department,\n\n419\n00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:00.710\nI just add them into the group.\n\n420\n00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:04.770\nI've already taken care of what that group\nneeds, and what a salesperson needs and\n\n421\n00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:07.810\ndoesn't need access to, and\nI've assigned that to the group.\n\n422\n00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:12.060\nSo as we hire new people, I just dump\nthem in there, and I'm good to go.\n\n423\n00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:16.640\nSo it's a very common way of implementing\nprinciple of least privilege.\n\n424\n00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.370\nAnother thing we can do is\nuse multiple user accounts.\n\n425\n00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:22.320\nA common method, it was a Microsoft\nbest practice, well it still is\n\n426\n00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:26.760\na Microsoft best practice, the UAC\nhas kind of forced our hand in this.\n\n427\n00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:32.050\nBut the idea behind multiple\naccounts just means sometimes\n\n428\n00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:34.320\nI need administrative access,\nbut not normally.\n\n429\n00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.444\nTo do most of my job, checking email,\nsurfing the Internet,\n\n430\n00:22:37.444 --> 00:22:42.137\nbrowsing amazon.com and\nbuying stuff, no that's not my job.\n\n431\n00:22:42.137 --> 00:22:44.900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But for most of my job, for creating\n\n432\n00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:49.790\nemails, for writing reports or what have\nyou, I don't need administrative access.\n\n433\n00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:52.800\nSometimes I do though need\nthat administrative access.\n\n434\n00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.870\nWell, instead of giving my account\nthat administrative access so\n\n435\n00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:59.990\nthat I've always got it whether I need\nit or not, I'm gonna make two accounts.\n\n436\n00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:02.860\nOne of them's gonna be a standard\nuser that can do everything I\n\n437\n00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:04.820\nneed to do in my normal duties.\n\n438\n00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:08.310\nThe other one might have more rights and\nnot necessarily administrative,\n\n439\n00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:11.870\nbut more rights, and\nmost commonly an administrator account.\n\n440\n00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:15.450\nSo if I need to do something that\nrequires those escalated credentials,\n\n441\n00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:20.590\nI simply log on with that account, do\nwhat I need to do, and then log back off.\n\n442\n00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:24.150\nLog back on with my standard\naccount once I'm done with that\n\n443\n00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:26.170\nstuff that required\nadministrative credentials.\n\n444\n00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:28.570\nThat way I'm not doing\neverything as an administrator.\n\n445\n00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:33.150\nI'm not checking my email and clicking on\npotential malware in a link in an email,\n\n446\n00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:35.020\nI'm not doing that with\nadministrative access.\n\n447\n00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.272\nI'm doing that as a standard user,\n\n448\n00:23:37.272 --> 00:23:42.393\nwhich is gonna help reduce the impact that\nit could have if I did click on malware.\n\n449\n00:23:42.393 --> 00:23:44.998\nSo having more than one user account for\nthose, but\n\n450\n00:23:44.998 --> 00:23:47.614\nnot everybody needs that\nadministrative access.\n\n451\n00:23:47.614 --> 00:23:51.269\nSo it's not like you have to make every\nsingle person in the company two different\n\n452\n00:23:51.269 --> 00:23:51.816\naccounts.\n\n453\n00:23:51.816 --> 00:23:55.151\nIf you follow your principle of\nleast privilege and use your groups,\n\n454\n00:23:55.151 --> 00:23:56.657\nyou should be good to go there.\n\n455\n00:23:56.657 --> 00:24:00.486\nBut you don know that you've got some\npeople that need administrative access but\n\n456\n00:24:00.486 --> 00:24:02.070\nthey don't need it all the time.\n\n457\n00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:05.763\nSo those are the ones that you take\nthe time to make a second account for\n\n458\n00:24:05.763 --> 00:24:10.156\nthat way they can chose which one they're\nusing and reduce the likelihood of their\n\n459\n00:24:10.156 --> 00:24:13.298\naccount being used to compromise\nthe rest of our network.\n\n460\n00:24:13.298 --> 00:24:15.420\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n461\n00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:19.520\nSo principle of least privileged only\nassign what it is they need to do\n\n462\n00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.750\ntheir job and nothing more.\n\n463\n00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:24.700\nNext thing we need to talk\nabout is social engineering.\n\n464\n00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:30.170\nSocial engineering is a huge topic,\nwe could spend all day on it,\n\n465\n00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:34.740\nbut, basically it's a type of attack\nthat takes advantage of human nature.\n\n466\n00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:42.340\nThey're going to pull information out\nof users that they shouldn't be giving.\n\n467\n00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:45.040\nThey're going to do dumpster diving.\n\n468\n00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.790\nNow, there's several different\ntypes of social engineering.\n\n469\n00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:52.660\nMost common ones are things like calling\nup on the phone and doing name dropping.\n\n470\n00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:57.620\nHey Daniel, this is Mike down at IT and\nwe're resetting our database and I need\n\n471\n00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:00.880\nto make sure I have your password so\nthat you'll have access on Monday morning.\n\n472\n00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.060\nSo if you could just\ngive me your password.\n\n473\n00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.425\nMike in IT, that sounds right.\n\n474\n00:25:04.425 --> 00:25:05.810\nDaniel, are you gonna give\nme your password, right?\n\n475\n00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:07.651\n>> Oh,\nthat's exactly what I'm not gonna do.\n\n476\n00:25:07.651 --> 00:25:09.663\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because [LAUGH] anybody that's ever\n\n477\n00:25:09.663 --> 00:25:13.647\nspent any time in IT should understand\nthat nobody needs your password,\n\n478\n00:25:13.647 --> 00:25:16.610\nthe only person that knows\nyour password is you.\n\n479\n00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:18.940\nThat's the only person ever\nneeds to know your password.\n\n480\n00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.560\nYou call a help desk,\nthey ask for your password,\n\n481\n00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:25.360\nsay, that's not a very secure practice,\nI'll log in for you, or I'll do this or\n\n482\n00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.430\nI'll do that, but\nI'm not giving you my password.\n\n483\n00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:30.020\nThey shouldn't be asking for it,\nno administrator is gonna call and\n\n484\n00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:31.680\nsay, I need your password.\n\n485\n00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:35.420\nIf I need Mike's credentials to log in\nto something, as the administrator,\n\n486\n00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:39.098\nI can just change his password and log in\nand do whatever I need to do as Mike for\n\n487\n00:25:39.098 --> 00:25:40.320\nwhatever reason-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n488\n00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.193\n>> I've come up with the,\n\n489\n00:25:41.193 --> 00:25:44.770\nI'm gonna have to justify that to\nthe higher ups, but I would do that.\n\n490\n00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:48.890\nAnd then tell Mike, hey, I logged\nin as you, I changed your password.\n\n491\n00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:52.250\nI set it to where you're gonna have to\nreset your password the next time you log\n\n492\n00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:54.000\nin, and that would be that.\n\n493\n00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.510\nYou're never giving out your password.\n\n494\n00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:56.900\nI don't care what the email says.\n\n495\n00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.920\nI don't care what the guy on\nthe end of the phone says.\n\n496\n00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.350\nDo not listen to them.\n\n497\n00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:02.030\nDo not give up your password.\n\n498\n00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:05.600\n>> Absolutely not, and that's not\nthe only form of social engineering.\n\n499\n00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:09.018\nThose emails that you get that say, hey,\nyou've got a long lost relative in some\n\n500\n00:26:09.018 --> 00:26:11.880\nother country that really wants to\nleave you a whole bunch of money,\n\n501\n00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.073\nif you could just send them a little\nmoney first to get the process started.\n\n502\n00:26:15.073 --> 00:26:17.320\nThat's social engineering.\n\n503\n00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:22.446\nSo we've gotta protect against that,\nand unfortunately,\n\n504\n00:26:22.446 --> 00:26:25.400\nthere isn't any way to do it\nthrough the system itself.\n\n505\n00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.370\nI shouldn't say there's no way,\nbut it's very, very difficult.\n\n506\n00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:31.510\nIt really comes down to user education.\n\n507\n00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:35.610\nTeaching your users about these methods\nthat the bad guys are using, so\n\n508\n00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:38.740\nthat they can be better\nprepared against it.\n\n509\n00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:42.648\nBecause a lot of those users out there, if\nyou say, hey, this is so and so with IT.\n\n510\n00:26:42.648 --> 00:26:44.000\nAnd that's easy to find out.\n\n511\n00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.400\nI can probably search your web site and\nget the name of one of your IT guys or\n\n512\n00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:52.010\nsomething like that, and if I start\ndoing some name dropping, or your CEO or\n\n513\n00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:52.930\nsomething like that.\n\n514\n00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:54.330\nHey, I need your password.\n\n515\n00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:59.233\nWell, if you're just a brand new employee,\nor somebody pretty low on the totem pole,\n\n516\n00:26:59.233 --> 00:27:00.992\nwho are you to say no to the CIO?\n\n517\n00:27:00.992 --> 00:27:03.498\nYou're gonna give him your password,\nmost likely.\n\n518\n00:27:03.498 --> 00:27:05.170\nYou shouldn't.\n\n519\n00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:05.760\nYou don't want to.\n\n520\n00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.210\nAnd that's what we've\ngot to teach our users.\n\n521\n00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:09.880\nI don't care who it is,\ndon't give them your password.\n\n522\n00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.580\nBut until we teach them,\nthey're not gonna know that.\n\n523\n00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:17.940\nSo user education is a big part of\nsecurity because when it comes down to it,\n\n524\n00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:22.640\neverybody's a part of security,\nnot just IT, not just the IT security.\n\n525\n00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:26.920\nEverybody that touches that\nsystem is a part of security\n\n526\n00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.559\ncuz you can do whatever you want to\nsecure that system and that network.\n\n527\n00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:34.430\nAll it takes is one person to\nopen up a huge gaping hole in all\n\n528\n00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:35.910\nthe things you've done.\n\n529\n00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:40.071\nI can have this nice bulletproof network,\none user clicks on a link in an email, and\n\n530\n00:27:40.071 --> 00:27:42.388\nall of a sudden he's got\na listener running and\n\n531\n00:27:42.388 --> 00:27:46.090\nsomebody from the outside is connect\nin and compromising all of our data.\n\n532\n00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:49.770\nI've got cameras and doors and\nkey fobs, and blah, blah, blah.\n\n533\n00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:53.450\nIt takes one user to prop that\nbackdoor open with their briefcase\n\n534\n00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:56.560\nwhile they run back out to the car and\ngrab that coffee they forgot.\n\n535\n00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:00.330\nIn the meantime, who knows who is\nslipping through the backdoor.\n\n536\n00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:05.610\nSo user education has to be a big\npart of our security solution.\n\n537\n00:28:06.762 --> 00:28:10.650\nNow, kinda along those same lines,\nI wanna mention the term attack surface.\n\n538\n00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:12.050\nWhen we look at attack surfaces,\n\n539\n00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:17.980\nattack surfaces all different ways\nthat people can get into our systems..\n\n540\n00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:20.830\nAnd we're always trying to\nreduce our attack surface.\n\n541\n00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:25.879\nThe smaller that surface is, the less ways\nthe bad guys have to get into our system.\n\n542\n00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.230\nAnd when we talk about a tax service,\n\n543\n00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:30.550\nwe really need to look at\nit three different levels.\n\n544\n00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:33.730\nApplication, network and employees.\n\n545\n00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:38.910\nFar as the applications go, well,\napplications have vulnerabilities.\n\n546\n00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:43.190\nThe more applications we've run,\nthe bigger our attack surfaces.\n\n547\n00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:45.930\nSo we wanna limit how many\napplications we're having to use.\n\n548\n00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:49.520\nWe wanna make sure that we're patching\nthose applications, hardening those\n\n549\n00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:53.965\napplications, applying any and\nall security updates against those guys.\n\n550\n00:28:53.965 --> 00:28:56.790\nLike, back in the day,\nway back in Server 2000,\n\n551\n00:28:56.790 --> 00:29:01.890\nwhen you went to install IIS, cuz you\nwanted a web server, it would install IIS.\n\n552\n00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:06.570\nBut it also installed FTP and\nNNTP and a couple of other things\n\n553\n00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:09.830\nthat you probably never used, probably\ndidn't even realize you were running.\n\n554\n00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:13.000\nThose are applications that are sitting\nthere in their default configuration\n\n555\n00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.475\nwaiting for a bad guy to come and\ntake advantage of them.\n\n556\n00:29:16.475 --> 00:29:20.600\nNetwork, well, we gotta think about what\nare the different ways into my network?\n\n557\n00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:25.780\nEvery server that I expose to\nthe Internet, that is a way in.\n\n558\n00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:29.450\nWireless Access Points that employees\nhave decided to bring in on their own?\n\n559\n00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:31.635\nThat's a way into my network.\n\n560\n00:29:31.635 --> 00:29:35.820\nSo limiting the number of servers that\nare exposed out there to the Internet.\n\n561\n00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:40.260\nThat's why we use private IP addresses\nwhen it comes to IPv4, is so\n\n562\n00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:44.990\nthat my machines aren't directly\nexposed to the Internet.\n\n563\n00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:49.550\nWith doing wireless surveys, looking for\nthose rogue access points and\n\n564\n00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:50.670\neliminating them.\n\n565\n00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:54.582\nThat's closing holes,\nthat's filling up our attack surface,\n\n566\n00:29:54.582 --> 00:29:57.652\nit's reducing I should say,\nour attack surface.\n\n567\n00:29:57.652 --> 00:29:58.900\nAnd then, our users.\n\n568\n00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:02.310\nThis goes right back to what we just said.\n\n569\n00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:07.830\nUser education because employees\nare a big part of our tax surface.\n\n570\n00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:09.990\nHuman error is a very common one.\n\n571\n00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:12.580\nAnd not just lower level employees,\n\n572\n00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:17.700\nI'm talking about the C-level people,\nI'm talking about our IT people.\n\n573\n00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:21.040\nHey, we got that server in, it's Friday\nafternoon, I can't wait to unpack it,\n\n574\n00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.830\nthrow it in the closet, I'm gonna stick\nit in there on the rack, plug it on,\n\n575\n00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:27.350\nget an IP address,\nwe got our new server up and running.\n\n576\n00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:29.454\nOh, 5 o'clock, time to go.\n\n577\n00:30:29.454 --> 00:30:30.567\nNo, right?\n\n578\n00:30:30.567 --> 00:30:32.445\nI mean,\nnow you've got this server that's exposed.\n\n579\n00:30:32.445 --> 00:30:36.085\nYou haven't done any hardening to it or\nanything like that.\n\n580\n00:30:36.085 --> 00:30:41.155\nEasy for us to just like it is my\nnon-technical employees, if you will.\n\n581\n00:30:41.155 --> 00:30:44.005\nSo human error, easy one.\n\n582\n00:30:44.005 --> 00:30:46.495\nMisconfigure a firewall rule.\n\n583\n00:30:46.495 --> 00:30:51.655\nAnd instead of an implicit deny, we end\nup putting in implicit allow that says,\n\n584\n00:30:51.655 --> 00:30:53.400\nhey, if it's not on the list, allow it.\n\n585\n00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:56.820\nEasy to do, simple mistake.\n\n586\n00:30:56.820 --> 00:31:00.380\nAnd you just blew a big hole in\nthe security on your network.\n\n587\n00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:03.790\nSo human error, a very real thing that we\nhave to deal with and then, of course,\n\n588\n00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:06.570\nsocial engineering which I\nthink we've hashed enough.\n\n589\n00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:09.270\nIt comes back to user education.\n\n590\n00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:13.250\nWe always want to strive to\nreduce our attack service.\n\n591\n00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:16.870\nAnything that we add to our network that's\ngonna increase that attack service,\n\n592\n00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:20.460\nthat's gonna be another avenue in, we\nreally gotta stop and take a look at, and\n\n593\n00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:24.440\nmake sure, one, we need it and two,\nwe know how to secure it properly.\n\n594\n00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:25.230\n>> Awesome stuff, Mike.\n\n595\n00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:28.210\nObviously, security is a large,\nlengthy topic.\n\n596\n00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:31.180\nIt's a little involved, but\njust understanding those basics.\n\n597\n00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:31.720\nIn my opinion,\n\n598\n00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:35.350\nyou did a great job of showing us those\nbasic fundamental understandings.\n\n599\n00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:38.690\nHe's right, one of the major ways that\npeople get into systems is through\n\n600\n00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:41.715\njust exploiting us and\nour human fallibility.\n\n601\n00:31:41.715 --> 00:31:44.195\nOur ignorance of a topic or\nanything like that.\n\n602\n00:31:44.195 --> 00:31:45.715\nThey'll use that to their advantage,\n\n603\n00:31:45.715 --> 00:31:51.005\nso that's why we try to really\nhammer home user on education.\n\n604\n00:31:51.005 --> 00:31:55.798\nUnderstanding even the basics of this\nstuff will help you keep yourself out\n\n605\n00:31:55.798 --> 00:31:58.170\nof the weeds and secure your system.\n\n606\n00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:01.430\nMike, is there anything else we need to\ngo over today when it comes to security?\n\n607\n00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:04.980\n>> No, I think we've hit most of the core\nprinciples that we need to be familiar\n\n608\n00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:07.010\nwith at least for this exam.\n\n609\n00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:10.210\nAnd hopefully it got you curious and\nyou got out, you take this exam,\n\n610\n00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:14.110\nyou pass it, and then you dive a little\nfurther in to the world of security.\n\n611\n00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:14.710\n>> Awesome stuff.\n\n612\n00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:15.530\nWell, thank you so much for\n\n613\n00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:19.040\nthose demonstrations and\nthose explanations of security.\n\n614\n00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:21.960\nHopefully, you guys out there\nare now a little more hardened\n\n615\n00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.690\nwhen it comes to your security measures,\nor at least you know what to do.\n\n616\n00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:27.490\nAs for this episode though,\nwe need to go ahead and close it down.\n\n617\n00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:30.920\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n618\n00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:31.590\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n619\n00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:33.339\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n620\n00:32:33.339 --> 00:32:39.900\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.250\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n4\n00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.010\nJoining me in the studio today\nis none other than Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.870\nHow's it going today, Mike?\n\n6\n00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.500\n>> Oh, it's going great Daniel.\n\n7\n00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.640\nI'm excited to be here.\n\n8\n00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.800\nWe've got our MTA content coming your way.\n\n9\n00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.680\nThis one, we're going to be\nlooking at physical security.\n\n10\n00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.450\nIt's a part of security that in the IT\nworld sometimes gets overlooked.\n\n11\n00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.176\n>> That's right, we've got to hit the gym,\nget strong be powerful for\n\n12\n00:00:38.176 --> 00:00:40.180\nthem people try to steal our stuff.\n\n13\n00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.780\nWell, that would be funny and it is,\n\n14\n00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.230\nMike's laughing hysterically\nlike a hyena right now.\n\n15\n00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.990\n[LAUGH] But that's not the kind of\nphysical security which we're talking\n\n16\n00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.150\nabout, we're talking about how\ndo we secure physical items?\n\n17\n00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.090\nHow do I secure my server\nfrom something coming in and\n\n18\n00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.840\nactually gaining physical access?\n\n19\n00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.650\nPlugging in a disk or a keyboard or\na monitor and doing something to it.\n\n20\n00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.590\nHow do I physically secure\nmy laptop from being stolen?\n\n21\n00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.990\nThat's the kind of physical\nsecurity that we're talking about.\n\n22\n00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:09.110\nAnd it does involve a little\nbit of building up, but\n\n23\n00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.190\nMike's going to be the one to\nshow us all that stuff today.\n\n24\n00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.130\n>> I am and thank God it's not actually\nphysical strength, because if you look at\n\n25\n00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.550\nhim and you look at me, it'd be like,\nokay just take my server, it's okay.\n\n26\n00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:18.910\n>> All your base are belong to us.\n\n27\n00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:19.655\n>> That's right.\n\n28\n00:01:19.655 --> 00:01:24.100\n[LAUGH] Now, physical security is\na very important part of security.\n\n29\n00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.890\nIt does tend to get overlooked sometimes,\n\n30\n00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.960\nbecause we like to focus on\nthe electronic side of things.\n\n31\n00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:29.560\nRight?\n\n32\n00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.430\nLove to get in here and configure servers,\nand configure firewalls, and\n\n33\n00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.180\nconfigure access points, and\nlock my network down, and\n\n34\n00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.460\nharden my servers, and harden my clients,\nand all that good stuff.\n\n35\n00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.510\nRight?\nThose are the things that we're\n\n36\n00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.580\ntrained to do.\n\n37\n00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.130\nAs IT people that's what we love to\ntry to do, keep those bad guys out.\n\n38\n00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.400\nThere's a problem.\n\n39\n00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.930\nPhysical security will trump all of that.\n\n40\n00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.660\nAnd if you ever go out and\ndo a Google search for\n\n41\n00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.540\nMicrosoft ten immutable laws of security,\none of my favorite ones in there is,\n\n42\n00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.720\nif I can touch your computer,\nits no longer your computer.\n\n43\n00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.600\nAnd its that simple, because if I\nhave physical access to the machine,\n\n44\n00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.890\nthere's too many things that I can try to\ndo to get access to that data on there.\n\n45\n00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.360\nI can simply steal the hard drive and\ntry to take it with me.\n\n46\n00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.650\nI can run some alternate OS.\n\n47\n00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.650\nI can boot that server\nup to something else.\n\n48\n00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.260\nI could try to do that and\ngain access to that system.\n\n49\n00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.100\nThere's just too many things I can do,\nand it's almost impossible to\n\n50\n00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.150\nkeep somebody out if they have\nphysical access to that machine.\n\n51\n00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.520\nWhich is why physical security is so\nimportant.\n\n52\n00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.310\nAnd it's not just on our servers,\nit's everything.\n\n53\n00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.710\nSo we're going to start at the very\nbeginning and kind of work our way in.\n\n54\n00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.700\nA couple of key concepts that we need\nto be familiar with when we talk about\n\n55\n00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.498\nphysical security, and these concepts\naren't limited to just physical security.\n\n56\n00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:48.400\nYou're going to see that we\nwill reuse these same terms\n\n57\n00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.060\nlater on when we do look at the side of\nprotecting our network where we get in and\n\n58\n00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.560\nwe harden things and\nconfigure settings and things like that.\n\n59\n00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.640\n[COUGH] Excuse me, but\nIt applies to the physical part as well.\n\n60\n00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.780\nAnd the first one that I want to\nmention is called defense in depth.\n\n61\n00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.870\nAll that means, is we're going to\nhave multiple layers of security.\n\n62\n00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.140\nWe never want to put,\n\n63\n00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.530\nI use my mother's old saying you know,\nput all your eggs in one basket.\n\n64\n00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.610\nYou don't want to do that,\n\n65\n00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.540\nbecause if the bad guy can break through\nthat one layer of security, that's it.\n\n66\n00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.320\nHe's like the fox in the hen house now and\nhe's got the run of the place, right.\n\n67\n00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.330\nAll you had was that one gate trying to\nkeep him out, that's not going to cut it,\n\n68\n00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.230\nso we want multiple layer, after layer,\nafter layer, after layer of security, so\n\n69\n00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.310\nwhen that bad guy comes and tries to get\naccess to our networks, to our data,\n\n70\n00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.220\nto our hardware, whatever the case may be,\nhe doesn't have an easy time,\n\n71\n00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.600\nright you get two big advantages\nfrom doing defense in depth.\n\n72\n00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.690\nOne is the fact that it\nrequires more skill.\n\n73\n00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.430\nIf I have many layers of security,\nthey might be able to get through\n\n74\n00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.100\nthat first layer,\nbecause maybe they're really good at.\n\n75\n00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.410\nLet's say we've got guards outside, right?\n\n76\n00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.530\nAnd they're able to come in.\n\n77\n00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.560\nThey've got uniforms.\n\n78\n00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.700\nThey've got all the right paperwork\nmaybe they get past the guards.\n\n79\n00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.760\nWell if that was my only layer, that's it.\n\n80\n00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.060\nThey're done.\nThey can do whatever they want right?\n\n81\n00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.645\nBut we got more guards inside, or\nwe got cameras, or we got locked doors.\n\n82\n00:04:12.645 --> 00:04:15.775\nSo now, not only do they have to\nbe good at faking out the guards,\n\n83\n00:04:15.775 --> 00:04:17.935\nbut they've got to be able to pick locks.\n\n84\n00:04:17.935 --> 00:04:20.035\nSo the more layers you have,\n\n85\n00:04:20.035 --> 00:04:23.600\nthe more skill its going to require\nfrom the bad guy to get through.\n\n86\n00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.020\nSo that's a good thing, right.\n\n87\n00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.060\nMaybe he doesn't have all the skills to\nget through all of your layers of defense.\n\n88\n00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.990\nThe second big advantage of defense in\ndepth is the fact that we might detect it.\n\n89\n00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.580\nAt one of those layers, hopefully they\nwill trigger some alarm, or somebody will\n\n90\n00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.140\nwise up and go, wait a second,\nsomething's a little bit fishy here.\n\n91\n00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.220\nLet's stop and take a closer look at this.\n\n92\n00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.910\nEvery layer that we have to go through is\na chance for us to stop and examine, and\n\n93\n00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.270\nsee what's going on and\n\n94\n00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.890\nmake sure that this is something\nthat should be happening.\n\n95\n00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.310\nSo you get some real big advantages\nof doing that defence In depth.\n\n96\n00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.520\nNow, it also depends on your level\nof security that you require.\n\n97\n00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.790\nI'm not saying that the SOHO or the\nmom-and-pop shop is going to have guards\n\n98\n00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.970\nwith 50 cal machine guns mounted up\non top of the building waiting for\n\n99\n00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.780\npeople to come up and say,\nwho the heck are you?\n\n100\n00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.360\nStop or I'll fire, or\nanything like that, right.\n\n101\n00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.960\nIt's going to depend on your\nrequirements for security.\n\n102\n00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.230\nBut we can still implement layers of\ndefenses in any type of environment.\n\n103\n00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.228\n>> Can't wait to frequent\nthat establishment.\n\n104\n00:05:26.228 --> 00:05:26.810\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH] You're\n\n105\n00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.780\ngreeted by a Ma deuce .50 cal.\n\n106\n00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.493\nThat will deter just about anyone,\n\n107\n00:05:31.493 --> 00:05:34.130\neven the people that\nlegitimately want to shop there.\n\n108\n00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.490\n>> Right, I lived in DC for a while, and\nit was right after some of those things\n\n109\n00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.180\nwere happening up there, and I remember\nthe Pentagon all of a sudden had\n\n110\n00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.280\nHumvees out there with 50 cals mounted on\ntop of them and soldiers sitting there.\n\n111\n00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.900\nYou could see that that level\nof security had gone up,\n\n112\n00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.510\nbut again that was defense in depth.\n\n113\n00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.290\nThese were at the edge of the parking lot.\n\n114\n00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:59.370\nYou weren't even getting into the parking\nlot without being stopped and\n\n115\n00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.070\nchecked, right?\n\n116\n00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.870\n[COUGH] So defense in depth,\na very important process.\n\n117\n00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.770\nLet's take a look at my screen here.\n\n118\n00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.590\nAnd, I've got just a simple diagram that\nwilll kind of explain a little bit, or\n\n119\n00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.110\nhelp us picture what I mean\nby layers of security.\n\n120\n00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.330\nYou know, you've got your outer perimeter,\nthis is going to be your grounds.\n\n121\n00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.430\nIt's wherever your facilities are.\n\n122\n00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.560\nNow if you're in a stand alone facility\nand this would be your public grounds,\n\n123\n00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.690\nyour parking lot, things like that.\n\n124\n00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.150\nIf you're in a strip mall type shop or\n\n125\n00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.790\nyour shared space, you might not\nhave that same outer perimeter.\n\n126\n00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.160\nIf you were in a mall, for example.\n\n127\n00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.730\nAnd your outer perimeter might\nbe the actual doors to the mall.\n\n128\n00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.470\nAnd it might not be completely\nunder your control, but\n\n129\n00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.770\nyou still have your store\nfront that you have.\n\n130\n00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:48.390\nBut that outer perimeter, this is where we\nput things like security cameras, right.\n\n131\n00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.840\nSo we've got visual surveillance\nof what's going on.\n\n132\n00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.070\nWe've got fences.\n\n133\n00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.850\nAnd again depending on the level\nof security, it might be a simple,\n\n134\n00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:02.480\nsmall fence that just kind of funnels\neverybody through one entry point, or\n\n135\n00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.140\nit could be an eight foot chain link\nwith razor wire up at the top of it.\n\n136\n00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:11.890\nBut we've got that perimeter that defines\nour area and where our security begins.\n\n137\n00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:16.260\nWe might have guards that walk around\nthe perimeter occasionally, looking for\n\n138\n00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.480\nplaces where people have tried to\nbreak through our security and maybe,\n\n139\n00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.730\nkind of holes in that chain link fence.\n\n140\n00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:22.320\nLights.\n\n141\n00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.450\nPeople forget about this,\nlight is a huge deterrent right,\n\n142\n00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.360\nbecause the bad guys,\nthey don't want to be seen.\n\n143\n00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.390\nAnd if you've got good lighting\nout there in the parking lot,\n\n144\n00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.260\nyou can help keep that area safe and\nsecure.\n\n145\n00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:35.740\nAnd remember,\n\n146\n00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.990\nwe're protecting our data and\nour equipment, as well as our personnel.\n\n147\n00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.490\nOur personnel is a very valuable\nasset in our organization.\n\n148\n00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.050\nWithout them,\nour organization doesn't do much.\n\n149\n00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:49.050\nSo, things like lights and guards\nnot only protect our facilities, but\n\n150\n00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:50.530\nthey're protecting our personnel, as well.\n\n151\n00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:54.100\nAs they're walking out to the car,\nI don't need somebody jumping out from\n\n152\n00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.990\nbehind a bush in a dark corner of the\nparking lot, and snagging their laptop.\n\n153\n00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.498\nRight?\nOr\n\n154\n00:07:58.498 --> 00:08:01.959\nsomething like that, so\nwe've got that outer perimeter.\n\n155\n00:08:01.959 --> 00:08:03.861\nNow, behind that, we don't stop there.\n\n156\n00:08:03.861 --> 00:08:05.116\nRight?\n\n157\n00:08:05.116 --> 00:08:07.357\nBehind that we've got\nour internal perimeter.\n\n158\n00:08:07.357 --> 00:08:09.636\nThis is, well when you talk\nabout the internal perimeter,\n\n159\n00:08:09.636 --> 00:08:11.651\nwe're usually talking\nabout the building itself.\n\n160\n00:08:11.651 --> 00:08:15.816\nSo that front door, and\nthen even inside that front door,\n\n161\n00:08:15.816 --> 00:08:20.746\nthe elevators, the doors to the offices,\ncameras in the hallways,\n\n162\n00:08:20.746 --> 00:08:25.862\nbadge readers or RFIDs to get through\ndoorways, and things like that.\n\n163\n00:08:25.862 --> 00:08:28.382\nSo we've got that\ninternal perimeter there.\n\n164\n00:08:28.382 --> 00:08:30.700\nYou might have somebody sitting\nat a front desk, right?\n\n165\n00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:31.620\nYou've got guards.\n\n166\n00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.460\nYou might have guards on the outer\nperimeter doing that patrol,\n\n167\n00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.835\nbut you've got guards sitting at a desk,\nthat everybody has to check in at, right?\n\n168\n00:08:38.835 --> 00:08:40.090\nThey're right there in the front lobby.\n\n169\n00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.770\nSmoke detectors might be another\nthing that you would see in this\n\n170\n00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:46.280\ninternal perimeter.\n\n171\n00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.810\nWe're not protecting just against those\nbad guys,right, physical security include\n\n172\n00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:53.770\nnatural type intrusions like floods,\nfires and things like that.\n\n173\n00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.330\nMan traps might be used, and\n\n174\n00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:01.560\nthis something I've seen more often now in\nmy banks around here, even in Gainesville.\n\n175\n00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.360\nWe're not a huge town, but\nthere was a rush of bank robberies.\n\n176\n00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:11.090\nAnd so now all of my both credit unions\nthat I use have man traps in them,\n\n177\n00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:11.700\nand a man trap,\n\n178\n00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.750\nif you've never seen one is a just two\nsets of doors where the first door opens.\n\n179\n00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.440\nThat inner door cannot be opened\nuntil the outer door closes, so\n\n180\n00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.980\nyou open the first door, you walk in,\nthe door closes behind you.\n\n181\n00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:27.830\nAnd then it might be that that inner door\nopens automatically once that back door\n\n182\n00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:28.400\ncloses.\n\n183\n00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.570\nOr in a higher security environment,\nsomebody might have to hit a button under\n\n184\n00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:35.960\ntheir desk after they've made\na visual check to decide whether or\n\n185\n00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.300\nnot you should be allowed in there.\n\n186\n00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.710\nBut in the meantime,\nyou're stuck between those two doors.\n\n187\n00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:43.723\nWe can put metal detectors in there.\n\n188\n00:09:43.723 --> 00:09:44.645\n>> Sharks with lasers.\n\n189\n00:09:44.645 --> 00:09:48.321\n[LAUGH]\n>> Sharks with lasers if you need them.\n\n190\n00:09:48.321 --> 00:09:51.594\nI have seen places that are so\nsecure where they actually have scales in\n\n191\n00:09:51.594 --> 00:09:55.660\nthe floor and they will weigh you on the\nway in and it'll weigh you on the way out.\n\n192\n00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.210\nAnd if there's a big difference there,\nthey know maybe\n\n193\n00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:01.330\nyou've tried to slip something up under\nyour coat or something like that.\n\n194\n00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:05.350\nSo mantraps again, that's usually\na high security type environment.\n\n195\n00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.250\nThen you have within that internal\nperimeter, we have another area.\n\n196\n00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:11.940\nWe have our secure area.\n\n197\n00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.620\nThis is typically where we\nkeep our server, right?\n\n198\n00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:16.540\nAnother layer of security in there.\n\n199\n00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:19.540\nThose servers are in a server closet.\n\n200\n00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:24.190\nAnd that server closet has a lock\nthat not many people have access to.\n\n201\n00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:26.730\nTo give them that physical protection.\n\n202\n00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.660\nBecause not all of my employees are IT.\n\n203\n00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:34.410\nAnd not even all of my IT needs to be\nable to physically touch those servers.\n\n204\n00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.170\nSo it's another layer of security.\n\n205\n00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.000\nYou might have a key to the front door.\n\n206\n00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.490\nYou don't have a key to get\ninto that server closet, right.\n\n207\n00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:42.340\nSo it's that additional\nlayer of security there.\n\n208\n00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:46.530\n>> That was, actually, exactly the model\nthat we used at a company I worked for.\n\n209\n00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:48.070\nWhere anybody could come\ninto the front door,\n\n210\n00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:50.220\nthere were armed guards there, as well.\n\n211\n00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.520\nBut you could just sign in as a visitor\nand gain access to the building.\n\n212\n00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.400\nIf you wanted to get\ninto the IT department,\n\n213\n00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.060\nyou had to have a badge\nthat would open the door.\n\n214\n00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.630\nA little magnetic stripe there,\nyou'd swipe it.\n\n215\n00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:03.740\nIf you had the right credentials,\nit would allow you into that facility.\n\n216\n00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.777\nBut then the server room,\nwhich was inside the IT department,\n\n217\n00:11:06.777 --> 00:11:10.097\nonly a select few were allowed to\ngain access to that because, well,\n\n218\n00:11:10.097 --> 00:11:13.594\nagain the whole practice of least\nprivileged kind of thing that we talked\n\n219\n00:11:13.594 --> 00:11:16.390\nabout in a previous episode\nwas applying there.\n\n220\n00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:19.300\nOnly the select few or people like myself,\nI needed access to the server\n\n221\n00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:22.720\nbecause I did repairs, I did\ninstallations, I did things like that.\n\n222\n00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.080\nSo I needed an access to help this.\n\n223\n00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:29.710\nI did need access to the server so\nthat was where their access would end, and\n\n224\n00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:30.770\nmine would continue on.\n\n225\n00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:35.670\nAnd so only that whole layered approach\nas we're seeing worked very, very well.\n\n226\n00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:38.410\nBecause we don't want people just\nwalking into the server area and\n\n227\n00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:41.220\nmaybe snatching some equipment and\nwalk out the door with it.\n\n228\n00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:42.510\nWe don't know who they are or\n\n229\n00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:44.950\nwhy they even took thing or\nare they supposed to take that?\n\n230\n00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:45.615\nProbably not.\n\n231\n00:11:45.615 --> 00:11:46.790\n[LAUGH]\n>> You know,\n\n232\n00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.770\nI mean they could slip a virus.\n\n233\n00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:52.620\nA USB key, plug it into one of your\nservers, wait for you to reboot it.\n\n234\n00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:53.850\nAny number of things.\n\n235\n00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:56.243\nWe're going to talk about key\nstroke loggers in a little bit.\n\n236\n00:11:56.243 --> 00:11:59.530\nThis is why physical security is so\nimportant.\n\n237\n00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:02.160\nSo, we talk about defense in depth and\n\n238\n00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:07.425\naccess control as well we're really\njust talking about making sure we are,\n\n239\n00:12:07.425 --> 00:12:11.799\nwe have the ability to control\nwho has access and who doesn't.\n\n240\n00:12:11.799 --> 00:12:15.713\nNow, access control is one of those terms\nthat we'll hear in a couple of different\n\n241\n00:12:15.713 --> 00:12:16.573\nplaces, right.\n\n242\n00:12:16.573 --> 00:12:19.840\nSo it really depends on the context\nwhen you're studying for this.\n\n243\n00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.090\nAccess control in\nthe physical security area.\n\n244\n00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:27.860\nWe're talking about things like guards,\nmantrap, locks, RFIDs,\n\n245\n00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:32.760\nanything that can prevent me from\njust obtaining that physical access.\n\n246\n00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.750\nThey also mention a term AAA,\nand these guys are great.\n\n247\n00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:40.620\nThey will come to you if your car breaks\ndown, they bring you battery, gas, no.\n\n248\n00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.160\nNot what we're talking about here.\n\n249\n00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.380\nAuthentication, authorization and\nauditing.\n\n250\n00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:45.880\nAll right?\n\n251\n00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.580\nSo, just be familiar with that term.\n\n252\n00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:50.850\nTriple A, authentication,\nauthorization, auditing.\n\n253\n00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:54.180\nIt is important that we understand\nthe difference there between\n\n254\n00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.650\nauthentication and authorization.\n\n255\n00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:01.390\nAnd this goes to the, again it'll come up\nlater when we talk about electronic or\n\n256\n00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:03.080\ndigital security as well.\n\n257\n00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.360\nBut, the same applies here, right?\n\n258\n00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:09.190\nAuthentication is verifying your identity,\nor proving who you are,\n\n259\n00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:12.320\nor validating the identity of someone or\nsome thing.\n\n260\n00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:17.140\nSo when you come up to that gate, when\nyou've got to show that guard your ID.\n\n261\n00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:18.770\nHe's authenticating it, right?\n\n262\n00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:23.090\nHe's verifying that hey, this is the\nperson that's in this picture and his ID.\n\n263\n00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:24.090\nSo now I know who they are.\n\n264\n00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.800\nThen, you have to be authorized.\n\n265\n00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:31.510\nNow that I know who you are, should\nyou be allowed to pass through or not?\n\n266\n00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:35.060\nRight, are you on the list for example,\nif you're at the guard station.\n\n267\n00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:36.270\nThat's authorization.\n\n268\n00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:39.450\nTwo separate things there,\nauthentication and authorization.\n\n269\n00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:42.830\nI cannot authorize you\nuntil I know who you are,\n\n270\n00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:45.120\nuntil I have successful authentication.\n\n271\n00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.060\nHow can I say, yes you're allowed,\nor, no you're not allowed,\n\n272\n00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.050\nto go through here if I\ndon't know who you are.\n\n273\n00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:54.455\nSo separate steps there, authentication,\nvalidating the identity of someone or\n\n274\n00:13:54.455 --> 00:13:57.930\nsomething, authorization,\ndetermining what rights or\n\n275\n00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:02.100\nprivileges this person has based\non the successful authentication.\n\n276\n00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:04.930\nAnd then auditing is keeping track, right.\n\n277\n00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:06.780\nThat guard is gonna write\ndown my license plate.\n\n278\n00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:11.670\nHe's gonna say, hey, I let Mike Rodrick\npass through here at 9:06 AM on Tuesday\n\n279\n00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:14.810\nmorning, or whatever the case may be.\n\n280\n00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:17.440\nKeeping track or logging what's going on.\n\n281\n00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.760\nWhen we use those RFID tags,\nthat all gets processed and\n\n282\n00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.630\nit gets stored in a log\nfile in a spreadsheet.\n\n283\n00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:27.840\nSo, my boss can go back at any time and\nsee who opened this door at 10:05\n\n284\n00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:33.140\nin the morning or at 1:30 in the am when\nnobody is supposed to be in the building.\n\n285\n00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:37.270\nThat's the auditing part of that,\nkeeping track of what's going on.\n\n286\n00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:40.490\nWith cameras, and recording that,\nthat would be considered auditing.\n\n287\n00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:44.990\nSite security,\nwe really already talked about.\n\n288\n00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:48.800\nWe've got the internal, we've got\nthe external, we've got the secure area.\n\n289\n00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.200\nWe do have to have processes though.\n\n290\n00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.420\nThere should be a defined\nset of processes.\n\n291\n00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:57.460\nThat guard out there at the shack,\nout there at the gate, he's got a process.\n\n292\n00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:01.290\nHe knows what he's supposed to\ndo when somebody comes up and\n\n293\n00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:04.490\nattempts to pass through the gate,\nthere's a process there.\n\n294\n00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:08.070\nThat person at the front desk has\na process that they go through when\n\n295\n00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:11.210\nsomebody walks in and\nsays hey I need to see so and so.\n\n296\n00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.210\nThere's a process I have to go through,\n\n297\n00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:15.690\nto get access to the server closet,\nthings like that.\n\n298\n00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:20.030\nI might have to go get somebody from\nIT and have them escort me in and\n\n299\n00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:23.250\nremain there the whole time I'm\npatching that new server down if I'm\n\n300\n00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.990\nnot authorized to be in that\nserver closet on my own.\n\n301\n00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:30.150\nWe got processes in place to make\nsure that the authentication,\n\n302\n00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:33.935\nauthorization and\nauditing is taking place as it should.\n\n303\n00:15:33.935 --> 00:15:39.408\nNow when it comes to computer security,\nwe really, we want to classify them.\n\n304\n00:15:39.408 --> 00:15:42.981\nYou can look at servers, desktops,\nand mobile devices right.\n\n305\n00:15:42.981 --> 00:15:46.583\nAnd really,\ntrying to think of a good way to say that,\n\n306\n00:15:46.583 --> 00:15:50.107\nit's different levels of\nsecurity that required,\n\n307\n00:15:50.107 --> 00:15:55.090\ndifferent threats and risks that\nthe different types of equipment face.\n\n308\n00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:58.671\nRight?\nMy servers, they are providing services to\n\n309\n00:15:58.671 --> 00:16:03.506\nmy company, possibly to the outside\nworld if it's my web server.\n\n310\n00:16:03.506 --> 00:16:08.480\nSo the threats that they face, the risks\nthat my web server faces that's providing\n\n311\n00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:14.350\nmy public webpage, is different from that\ndesktop that I sit at when I'm at work.\n\n312\n00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:16.570\nWe have to have different levels\nof security on these guys.\n\n313\n00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:17.730\nAnd we just have to think about it.\n\n314\n00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:21.310\nWe have to go back to what we talked\nabout in another episode and do our\n\n315\n00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:25.510\nrisk assessment and look at these guys and\nsee what threats they face and what we\n\n316\n00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:30.180\nchoose to do, how we plan on mitigating\nif any choose to mitigate those risks.\n\n317\n00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.240\nServers are typically exposed, yeah,\nthey could be internal servers so\n\n318\n00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:39.860\nproviding services to the network\nlike DHCP and DNS, Active directory.\n\n319\n00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.410\nThey could be providing services to\nthe outside, like my web server,\n\n320\n00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:46.440\nor the front-end of my mail server,\nor something like that.\n\n321\n00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:51.404\nSo we've got to look at those and figure\nout how we need to go about securing them.\n\n322\n00:16:51.404 --> 00:16:55.979\nBut here, again, we're really focused\non the physical side of things and\n\n323\n00:16:55.979 --> 00:17:00.698\nservers, as I said, usually go in\na server closet, which is another layer,\n\n324\n00:17:00.698 --> 00:17:03.670\nthat secure area within my building.\n\n325\n00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:07.340\nNow, if you're a small shop and\nyou don't have a server closet, well,\n\n326\n00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:11.780\nyou can get racks, rolling racks that you\nput these servers that have a locked door\n\n327\n00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:14.970\non the front of them, and most likely on\nthe back of them too, because I don't want\n\n328\n00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:19.170\nanyone plugging in keystroke loggers or\nkeyboards or anything like that to them.\n\n329\n00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:24.150\nIt might not be as secure as an entire\nserver room, but its better than putting\n\n330\n00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:27.810\nthat server underneath Sue's desk or\nunderneath John's desk.\n\n331\n00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:33.010\nWhere anybody can potentially\nget access to it.\n\n332\n00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:34.935\nDesktops, same thing,\n\n333\n00:17:34.935 --> 00:17:39.711\nwe wanna make sure that they have\na level of security in there.\n\n334\n00:17:39.711 --> 00:17:42.370\nThese are used by my end users come and\nsit at them.\n\n335\n00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:45.218\nThey're typically not\nexposed to the outside but\n\n336\n00:17:45.218 --> 00:17:48.413\nthat doesn't mean that we\ndon't have to protect them.\n\n337\n00:17:48.413 --> 00:17:51.828\nAnd then, mobile devices,\nthey bring a whole new fear,\n\n338\n00:17:51.828 --> 00:17:53.829\n[LAUGH] I don't know how to say it.\n\n339\n00:17:53.829 --> 00:17:56.420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There's a lot to securing mobile\n\n340\n00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:56.960\ndevices.\n\n341\n00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.890\nThe problem is, mobile devices are mobile.\n\n342\n00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:00.860\nMeaning, I can take them with me.\n\n343\n00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:06.680\nThey leave my secure area and my internal\nperimeter and my external perimeter.\n\n344\n00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.800\nNow, they're out there in the scary world\nand they can be left in the back of a cab\n\n345\n00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:13.750\nor on the table in a restaurant,\nstolen very easily.\n\n346\n00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:18.080\nSo these bring a whole another set of\nissues that we have to deal with when\n\n347\n00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.760\nwe talk about physical security.\n\n348\n00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:26.204\nRemovable devices and drives,\nthis is another thing that kinda goes\n\n349\n00:18:26.204 --> 00:18:29.593\nright along with mobile devices,\nvery easy for\n\n350\n00:18:29.593 --> 00:18:35.371\npeople to slip a thumb drive into work,\ncopy some data on there, and slip it out.\n\n351\n00:18:35.371 --> 00:18:38.323\nThey're easy to leave\nin the back of a cab,\n\n352\n00:18:38.323 --> 00:18:41.550\nleave at the restaurant,\nleave at the hotel.\n\n353\n00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:43.210\nEasy for people to steal.\n\n354\n00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:47.470\nJust walk through the office and, hey,\nI see a thumb drive laying on that desk,\n\n355\n00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:50.690\nI'm just gonna grab it and put it in my\npocket and nobody's gonna be the wiser.\n\n356\n00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:53.358\nI'll walk right out with it,\nand in today's world,\n\n357\n00:18:53.358 --> 00:18:56.872\nwe love to put stuff on these mobile,\nthese little removable drives.\n\n358\n00:18:56.872 --> 00:19:01.796\nEverybody's got their thumb drives, and if\nyou're one of the CIOs, or you're in RND,\n\n359\n00:19:01.796 --> 00:19:04.882\nyou got a thumb drive that has\nall our latest research and\n\n360\n00:19:04.882 --> 00:19:07.280\ndevelopment projects on there.\n\n361\n00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.050\nYou take that out of my secure area and\n\n362\n00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:13.200\nleave it at a restaurant,\nthat could be big damage to our company.\n\n363\n00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:17.234\nSo we've gotta make sure\nthat we're protecting these.\n\n364\n00:19:17.234 --> 00:19:21.870\nIt could be lost, easy to lose them,\neasy to steal them.\n\n365\n00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:25.652\nAnd then, data leakage is the other\nterm we should be familiar with, and\n\n366\n00:19:25.652 --> 00:19:28.198\nthat just means I'm gonna\ntake data out of work.\n\n367\n00:19:28.198 --> 00:19:30.870\nI'm gonna use one of these little\nthumb drives, put data on there.\n\n368\n00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:34.130\nTake it over to the competition and\nsell it to them.\n\n369\n00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:35.520\nOr publicizing.\n\n370\n00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.950\nWe've heard a few of these things\ngoing on lately here in the US.\n\n371\n00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:40.680\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n372\n00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:44.990\n>> Data leakage has been quite the splash\n\n373\n00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:48.230\nhere in the US lately and\naffects a lot of people.\n\n374\n00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:51.720\nSo letting data escape your company, and\n\n375\n00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.340\nits really easy,\nespecially with these removable drives.\n\n376\n00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.326\nThink about how easily\nconcealable they are.\n\n377\n00:19:56.326 --> 00:19:58.610\nIf I wanted to take one,\nand it was on your desk,\n\n378\n00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:01.641\nI could probably even come in and\nhave a conversation with you,\n\n379\n00:20:01.641 --> 00:20:06.120\nand it would leave the room, and you would\nhave no idea when that actually occurred.\n\n380\n00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.620\nUnless you had some sort of visual\nrecord of it, or you saw me do it.\n\n381\n00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:11.770\nIt would be very, very difficult,\ncuz we're sitting on the desk,\n\n382\n00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:14.000\nI put my hand right over it and\nyou wouldn't even realize it.\n\n383\n00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.030\nAnd just slide it away, and its gone.\n\n384\n00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:19.190\nI could come back later after I've\ncopied the information, and go, oh,\n\n385\n00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:22.200\nI heard you were looking for, oh there\nit is underneath your plant there,\n\n386\n00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.550\nit must have fallen of your desk,\nhere you go, and give it back.\n\n387\n00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:26.325\nI've already copied the data.\n\n388\n00:20:26.325 --> 00:20:28.310\nThe data has already been taken.\n\n389\n00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:31.862\nSo we have to be, Mike was right,\nthose mobile devices,\n\n390\n00:20:31.862 --> 00:20:34.139\nthey're kind of a necessary evil-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n391\n00:20:34.139 --> 00:20:35.937\n>> If you will.\n\n392\n00:20:35.937 --> 00:20:40.172\nWe have to be mobile because it\nallows us flexibility in our company,\n\n393\n00:20:40.172 --> 00:20:43.310\nin our business, and in our environment.\n\n394\n00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:46.760\nBut they are so easy,\nI've had a phone stolen.\n\n395\n00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:50.852\nI was in Guitar Center and I set it down\non an amp, because it was sitting right,\n\n396\n00:20:50.852 --> 00:20:53.532\nhold the guitar, so\nI moved it and then it was gone.\n\n397\n00:20:53.532 --> 00:20:54.386\nThat was the end of it.\n\n398\n00:20:54.386 --> 00:20:56.440\nHad to call all the security guys and\nsay, hey,\n\n399\n00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.210\nI need you to remote wipe my phone,\nlock it out and all that.\n\n400\n00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:00.002\nIt's gone.\n\n401\n00:21:00.002 --> 00:21:01.500\nAnd then, I had to get issued a new one.\n\n402\n00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:02.200\nI was without a phone for\n\n403\n00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.750\nlike a week because provider dragged\ntheir feet on all sorts of stuff.\n\n404\n00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:10.820\nSo it can cause a lot of disorder and\ndisruption in your every day-to-day\n\n405\n00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:16.400\nbusiness and even it that small level, can\nbe very, what's the word I'm looking for?\n\n406\n00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.880\nIt's just disruption.\n\n407\n00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.250\n>> Absolutely.\n\n408\n00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:22.360\nIt's amazing, you guys know, all of\nyou out there have smart phones, and\n\n409\n00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:23.520\nI'm sure you got thumb drives.\n\n410\n00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:27.070\nAnd we're not talking about 80 megs or\nanything like that.\n\n411\n00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:28.775\nI mean, these thumb drives are huge,\n\n412\n00:21:28.775 --> 00:21:32.440\nthey can store half of my company's\ndata on there if you really wanted to.\n\n413\n00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.315\nSame thing with phones.\n\n414\n00:21:34.315 --> 00:21:37.015\nTake my phone,\nI can remote desktop back into work and\n\n415\n00:21:37.015 --> 00:21:39.400\nI can fix a server if I need to,\nfrom my phone.\n\n416\n00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:44.260\nThat's fantastic for me, it's also great\nfor that bad guy that picks up my phone.\n\n417\n00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.775\nAnd I'm watching you, Daniel.\n\n418\n00:21:45.775 --> 00:21:47.712\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> With the whole slide it off the table,\n\n419\n00:21:47.712 --> 00:21:49.240\noh, you must have dropped it.\n\n420\n00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He's already thought about this\n\n421\n00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.110\none I think.\n\n422\n00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:52.304\n>> Let me grab that [LAUGH].\n\n423\n00:21:52.304 --> 00:21:53.515\n>> [LAUGH] There you go.\n>> Hey, Mike, it's Elvis.\n\n424\n00:21:53.515 --> 00:21:55.477\n>> [LAUGH] You're no longer\nallowed near my desk.\n\n425\n00:21:55.477 --> 00:21:59.456\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And again,\n\n426\n00:21:59.456 --> 00:22:03.770\nwhen we're focusing on physical security,\nmobile devices become a problem.\n\n427\n00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:05.410\nSome environments don't allow them.\n\n428\n00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:09.192\nYou just make sure that nobody's allowed\nto come in with a mobile device.\n\n429\n00:22:09.192 --> 00:22:14.224\nAnd hard to prevent them from carrying one\nin, unless you're doing physical searches,\n\n430\n00:22:14.224 --> 00:22:18.900\nbut in a high security environment,\nthat's not out of the question.\n\n431\n00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:19.910\nOther environments that aren't so\n\n432\n00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:24.060\nsecure might just prevent them\nthrough policies on the network.\n\n433\n00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:27.580\nSo you could plug it in, but the operating\nsystem won't recognize it, or\n\n434\n00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:28.400\nsomething like that.\n\n435\n00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.660\nBut user education,\n\n436\n00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:35.820\nteaching them the importance of\nkeeping these removable devices safe.\n\n437\n00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:39.778\nMaking sure that we've got remote wipe,\nlike Daniel was saying, set up on phones,\n\n438\n00:22:39.778 --> 00:22:43.141\nespecially if it's a company phone and\nthey put company data on there.\n\n439\n00:22:43.141 --> 00:22:45.660\nIt can help us protect that information.\n\n440\n00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:50.464\nNow, a couple other terms and some things\nthat you're probably familiar with,\n\n441\n00:22:50.464 --> 00:22:52.086\nI'm gonna get JSON to pull this up.\n\n442\n00:22:52.086 --> 00:22:56.300\nMobile devices, again, big problem\nbecause they leave our environment.\n\n443\n00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:00.232\nMy desktop, it's gonna be hard for\nsomebody to walk out with it because\n\n444\n00:23:00.232 --> 00:23:04.505\nthey've gotta get through my exterior\nperimeter, my interior perimeter.\n\n445\n00:23:04.505 --> 00:23:07.755\nAnd they've gotta get that physical thing,\nand then put it under their arm,\n\n446\n00:23:07.755 --> 00:23:08.360\nand walk out.\n\n447\n00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.990\nNow, granted, they're typically\nnot stealing the entire case,\n\n448\n00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:13.670\nthey're just stealing\nthe hard drive out of there.\n\n449\n00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:16.100\nBut they gotta get that physical access.\n\n450\n00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:18.930\nMobile devices, unfortunately,\nwe take them to them.\n\n451\n00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:19.975\nWe bring them to the bad guys.\n\n452\n00:23:19.975 --> 00:23:23.820\nWe will, we take them to the places\nwhere they're much more vulnerable.\n\n453\n00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:27.300\nNow, with laptops, I know I travel.\n\n454\n00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:30.650\nYeah, I travel, go to hotels,\npresent presentations, what have you.\n\n455\n00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:32.170\nI've got my laptop with me.\n\n456\n00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:34.320\nI wanna run down and\ngrab something to eat.\n\n457\n00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.310\nWhat do I do with my laptop?\n\n458\n00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:36.450\nIt won't fit in that safe.\n\n459\n00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:39.200\nThese hotels, they give you a little\nsafe that's about, yeah, big so\n\n460\n00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.020\nyou can put your wallet in there maybe or\nsomething like that.\n\n461\n00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.630\nI can't fold my laptop up and\nget it in there.\n\n462\n00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:47.760\nWell, there's a set of locks and\nthey're known as Kensington locks,\n\n463\n00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:51.310\nI think they started this, and not so\nimportant that we understand the name,\n\n464\n00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:52.980\nit's more about the concept.\n\n465\n00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:56.830\nBut this is an example, on the side of\nthis laptop, you can see this strange\n\n466\n00:23:56.830 --> 00:24:00.480\nlooking little hole here, and it doesn't\nhave a symbol like these other guys.\n\n467\n00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.706\nIt's just a slot.\n\n468\n00:24:01.706 --> 00:24:05.844\nWell, what that is, is for\nwhat's called a Kensington lock,\n\n469\n00:24:05.844 --> 00:24:08.707\nif I can say that, Kensington-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n470\n00:24:08.707 --> 00:24:09.543\n>> Lock.\n\n471\n00:24:09.543 --> 00:24:12.728\nAnd you can see here,\nthis device goes into that slot, and\n\n472\n00:24:12.728 --> 00:24:17.343\nthen there's a key that reminds me of the\nold school, if anybody goes back this far,\n\n473\n00:24:17.343 --> 00:24:21.633\nthe old school hard drive keys on those\nremovable trays or even a deep freezer or\n\n474\n00:24:21.633 --> 00:24:22.871\nsomething like that.\n\n475\n00:24:22.871 --> 00:24:24.239\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n476\n00:24:24.239 --> 00:24:26.595\n>> But it's one of those kind of keys, and\n\n477\n00:24:26.595 --> 00:24:27.531\nthat is locked.\n\n478\n00:24:27.531 --> 00:24:31.440\nSo now that is attached to a pole or\na pillar inside the case.\n\n479\n00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.130\nNow, it's not bulletproof.\n\n480\n00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:37.220\nCould I yank on this hard enough and\nrip that case apart and get that out?\n\n481\n00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.010\nAbsolutely.\nBut if somebody wants my laptop that bad,\n\n482\n00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:43.240\nthey probably got cable\ncutters with them anyway.\n\n483\n00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:46.175\nBut this is a way that I\ncan help keep it secured.\n\n484\n00:24:46.175 --> 00:24:49.395\nNow you take the other end of this cable\nand you loop it around something in\n\n485\n00:24:49.395 --> 00:24:54.195\nthat hotel room, or I've seen these\nused internally in an office.\n\n486\n00:24:54.195 --> 00:24:58.460\nSome places everybody doesn't have\ndesktops, everybody has a laptop.\n\n487\n00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:01.040\nAnd that's what they use when they're\nsitting in their cubicle, and\n\n488\n00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.970\nwhen they go home, they take it with them.\n\n489\n00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:05.190\nBut during the day, when they go\nto breaks, when they go to lunch,\n\n490\n00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:08.930\nthat laptop's vulnerable, because it\ncould be just picked up and carried out.\n\n491\n00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:11.270\nSo they might even lock\nthem to their cubicle.\n\n492\n00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:15.440\nThe key here, remember Is don't\nlock it to the chair leg, right.\n\n493\n00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.690\nBecause I can pick up the chair and\nI can pull the cable off.\n\n494\n00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:21.450\nSo make sure you pick something\na little more permanent than that.\n\n495\n00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.080\nI remember a story that\nthis guy was telling me\n\n496\n00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:28.700\nabout a company where they had\na bunch of laptops stolen.\n\n497\n00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:32.540\nAll this person did was get themselves\na little rolling cart and a jumpsuit.\n\n498\n00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:35.730\nAnd they started going through\nthe building at lunchtime, [COUGH] and\n\n499\n00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:39.600\nany desk that didn't have somebody sitting\nat it, they would just grab the laptop,\n\n500\n00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.600\nfold it up, put it on the cart,\nand keep rolling down the aisle.\n\n501\n00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.610\nSomebody asked him,\nsaid hey what are you doing?\n\n502\n00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:47.730\nAnd he's like, oh these laptops are going\nback for repair, or something like that.\n\n503\n00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:52.450\nGave us some song and dance, and was able\nto walk out with a half dozen laptops.\n\n504\n00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:56.145\nSo, keeping them secure with a cable lock\nlike this could have prevented something\n\n505\n00:25:56.145 --> 00:25:56.683\nlike that.\n\n506\n00:25:56.683 --> 00:26:00.256\nThere's other things you can get,\nthere's tracking software,\n\n507\n00:26:00.256 --> 00:26:04.488\nmost of you are probably familiar it from\nyour own IOS or Android on your phone.\n\n508\n00:26:04.488 --> 00:26:06.790\nWe can do the same thing with our laptops.\n\n509\n00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:10.460\nThere's stuff built in to some of the OSs.\n\n510\n00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:13.530\nThere's also third party\nsoftware like LoJack,\n\n511\n00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:15.720\nwhat's that other one I was looking at?\n\n512\n00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.200\nThat Prey Project,\nwhich is actually a free one, or\n\n513\n00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.670\nthey have a free version, where you\ninstall software on your computer.\n\n514\n00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:24.580\nAnd then if it ever gets stolen,\nyou can connect to that software and\n\n515\n00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:27.610\nit can give you some GPS\ncoordinates about where that is.\n\n516\n00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:28.840\nMaybe take screenshots.\n\n517\n00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.840\nMaybe even fire up your camera and\n\n518\n00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.710\ntry to get a picture of the bad\nguy that stole your computer.\n\n519\n00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:38.080\nSo there's options like that that we can\nuse to protect these mobile devices.\n\n520\n00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.720\nAnother thing we need to\ntalk about is key loggers.\n\n521\n00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.720\nThese are dangerous.\n\n522\n00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:48.020\nKeystroke logger, let's see if I\ncan zoom in just a wee bit here.\n\n523\n00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:50.870\nA keystroke logger is simply\ncan be a hardware device or\n\n524\n00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:52.320\nit can be software based.\n\n525\n00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:56.600\nBut it's capturing key stroked and it's\nrecording those and then we can go back\n\n526\n00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:01.510\nand retrieve those files and\nsee every keystroke that was pressed.\n\n527\n00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:02.190\nI mean everything.\n\n528\n00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:06.100\nIf you typed Mike M i k k e\n\n529\n00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:10.810\nbackspace backspace e, right to fix that\nerror, I would see that in that file.\n\n530\n00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:13.710\nI would see where you backed up and\ntyped two more letters.\n\n531\n00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:14.840\nIt records everything and\n\n532\n00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:18.860\nthey are so unobtrusive I guess\nwould be a good word for it.\n\n533\n00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:19.780\nI mean, look at the back of this.\n\n534\n00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:23.260\nThis is an old school on here, back when\nwe used to use something called PS2.\n\n535\n00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.390\nYou children won't know about this,\n\n536\n00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:30.490\nbut [LAUGH] you can see how easy\nit would be to slip that in.\n\n537\n00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:33.550\nIf you go to work, when's the last time\nyou looked at the back of your computer?\n\n538\n00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:35.980\nYou wouldn't even know this\nthing was sitting in there, and\n\n539\n00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:40.860\nbecause it's external to that computer the\nOS is completely unaware of it as well.\n\n540\n00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:45.010\nThe keystrokes are coming in from the\nkeyboard and they're passing through that\n\n541\n00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:48.550\ndevice, it's capturing it, and then\nthey're being fed on to the computer so\n\n542\n00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:51.540\nthere is nothing the operating\nsystem can even do about it.\n\n543\n00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:56.930\nThere are, of course,\nUSB ones as well that we can use,\n\n544\n00:27:56.930 --> 00:28:00.120\nbecause most of our\nkeyboards are now USB-based.\n\n545\n00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.390\nSo, same thing here, and\nthese guys can hold a ton of data.\n\n546\n00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:08.390\nThey can even be set up with little FTP\nclients that might FTP the results back to\n\n547\n00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:11.300\nyou, a lot of them though,\nyou just have to retrieve it.\n\n548\n00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:13.850\nSo at lunchtime, I wait until\neverybody's not looking there,\n\n549\n00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:17.450\nI go over to the CEO's desk, I pop\nthis in thing, I unplug his keyboard,\n\n550\n00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:20.830\nput this in place, plug the keyboard\nback into it, then I leave.\n\n551\n00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:23.450\nAnd then, later that day when\nnobody's looking, I just go and\n\n552\n00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:26.150\npull it back out and\nI've got a record of everything he types.\n\n553\n00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:30.180\nThat means all the passwords that he\nused to login to different places, and\n\n554\n00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:31.480\nthings like that.\n\n555\n00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.200\nThese guys are extremely dangerous.\n\n556\n00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.340\nThey can also be wi-fi.\n\n557\n00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:37.950\nThey now have wi-fi\nbased keystroke loggers\n\n558\n00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:40.390\nbecause a lot of our keyboards\nare now wireless, and so\n\n559\n00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:43.820\nthey can pull that wireless signal\nthat those keyboards are sending.\n\n560\n00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:47.220\nSo again, physical security.\n\n561\n00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:50.070\nIf I didn't have access to\nthe back of that server, or\n\n562\n00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:55.080\nto the back of that desktop, I wouldn't be\nable to put something like this in place,\n\n563\n00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.600\nand that's why these are under\nthe key stroke logger or\n\n564\n00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:02.630\nunder physical security, because\nphysical security would prevent this.\n\n565\n00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:06.650\nThey can also be software based, so\nthey can be delivered via email, or\n\n566\n00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:09.700\nsome other way that'll want to get\nthat malware on your system, and\n\n567\n00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:12.060\nthey run in the background and\ndo the same thing.\n\n568\n00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:16.740\nThose are a little bit easier to detect,\nusually, have to be pretty good to hide it\n\n569\n00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:20.790\ncompletely from the system, but definitely\nnot out of the realm of possibilities.\n\n570\n00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:25.950\nAnd those guys start taking screen\nshots every time you click the mouse,\n\n571\n00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:29.120\nevery web page you go to,\nall of that stuff.\n\n572\n00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.450\nThey can be really, really scary.\n\n573\n00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:33.700\nSo keyloggers another thing\nthat we have to worry about.\n\n574\n00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:37.830\nDoing a physical examination once in\nawhile of the backs of the computers,\n\n575\n00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:38.910\nof the backs of those servers.\n\n576\n00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:41.380\nYou go in that server closet, we're\nalways looking up there to the front,\n\n577\n00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:44.230\nwe pull that KVM out,\nwe do what we need, we leave.\n\n578\n00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:45.920\nNeed to walk around the back\nside every once in a while,\n\n579\n00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.865\nmake sure there's nothing\nfunky going on back there.\n\n580\n00:29:48.865 --> 00:29:55.070\n[COUGH] Now, last thing I want to talk\nabout is, disabling logon locally,\n\n581\n00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:59.190\nbecause this is another thing we can\ndo to help with physical security.\n\n582\n00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:01.460\nEven though I'm actually\ngoing into the software now,\n\n583\n00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:04.080\nthis would still fall under\nthe realm of physical security,\n\n584\n00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:07.530\nbecause we're talking about\nthe ability to log on to the system.\n\n585\n00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:10.260\nMost of my servers reside\nin a server closet.\n\n586\n00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:12.210\nI do all my administration remotely.\n\n587\n00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:15.150\nI either remote desktop into the server,\nor I'm using my\n\n588\n00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:19.790\nremote server admin tools from my client\nOS to remotely manage the servers.\n\n589\n00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:24.530\nI don't need, very often, to go in and\nactually log onto the servers.\n\n590\n00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:29.430\nI've got admins that work for me that\nare responsible for just DNS or just DHCP.\n\n591\n00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:30.740\nSo they can do all of that remotely.\n\n592\n00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:32.610\nI can build them a custom console.\n\n593\n00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:35.450\nThey can do all that administration\nfrom their own desktop.\n\n594\n00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:38.330\nThey do not need to be able\nto remote desktop in and\n\n595\n00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:40.420\nget access to the entire desktop.\n\n596\n00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:43.540\nThey just need DNS access so\nthey can manage that.\n\n597\n00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:47.410\nThey don't need to be able to walk into\nthe server closet and pull out the KBM and\n\n598\n00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:49.630\nlog on and\nget access to the entire desktop.\n\n599\n00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:52.250\nAll they need is that one console.\n\n600\n00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:54.620\nSo what we can do is we can\ndisable log on locally.\n\n601\n00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:58.550\nThere is a policy, now I'm using my\nlocal policy on this one in a domain\n\n602\n00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:02.980\nenvironment, we'd most likely do\nthis with domain-based group policy.\n\n603\n00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:07.500\nBut underneath computer configuration,\nwindows settings, security settings,\n\n604\n00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:12.490\nlocal policy, and then user rights\nassignment there's two settings.\n\n605\n00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:13.970\nOne is allow logon locally.\n\n606\n00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:17.160\nAnd you'll see, by default,\nanybody in the local admins group,\n\n607\n00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:21.300\nthe backup operators group,\nand the users group.\n\n608\n00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:23.000\nWell that's everybody, right?\n\n609\n00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.220\nSo that means any one of my\nauthenticated users can now come in and\n\n610\n00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:28.220\nlogon to this server.\n\n611\n00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:33.430\nAll right, so I might want to modify that,\nI might want to remove that.\n\n612\n00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:36.930\nOther policy I can use\nis deny logon locally.\n\n613\n00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:38.370\nNobody set here by default, but\n\n614\n00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:42.760\nI can add people to this to make sure\nthat they can never logon, right?\n\n615\n00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:48.310\nIf I, you can do the,\nwhat's the word I'm looking for here?\n\n616\n00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:49.850\nThe implicit deny, right,\n\n617\n00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:54.180\nif I don't put you in this list then you\ndon't have the right to log on locally.\n\n618\n00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:57.110\nBut what if you're added later\nto the backup operators group?\n\n619\n00:31:57.110 --> 00:32:00.350\nWell since they're in the list, now all\nof a sudden you will be able to log on.\n\n620\n00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:02.650\nTypically, the way we want to do it.\n\n621\n00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:07.430\nDenying things, it becomes a little\nbit more difficult to administer.\n\n622\n00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:11.090\nBut if you want to make sure that somebody\ncan't log on locally at the machine,\n\n623\n00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:14.750\nyou can create a group, and put them in\nthat group, and then add that group here,\n\n624\n00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:16.370\nand they won't be able to log on.\n\n625\n00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:19.340\nNo matter even if they get added to\nthe administrator's group later on.\n\n626\n00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:22.030\nThis will take precedence\nover the allow logon.\n\n627\n00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:25.310\nSo if you're on both lists, or\ngroups you belong to are in both lists,\n\n628\n00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:27.750\nthe deny will override the allow and\nyou won't be able to log on.\n\n629\n00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:30.320\nAnd again, that's just another\nlevel of physical security,\n\n630\n00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.640\nit keeps that employee from going, hey\nlook, somebody left the server door open.\n\n631\n00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.240\nLet's go see what kind of\nfun we can have in there.\n\n632\n00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:36.850\nThey won't be able to log on.\n\n633\n00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:37.350\nRight?\n\n634\n00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:40.570\nSo, another important part\nof physical security.\n\n635\n00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:44.240\nAnd it's just one of those things,\nthat again, gets overlooked, but\n\n636\n00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.910\nit's a very important part of security, so\n\n637\n00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:50.250\nwe've got to make sure that we're paying\nattention to that physical security.\n\n638\n00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:53.640\n>> Yes, yes, you don't want to just\ngive away the keys to the kingdom.\n\n639\n00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:58.420\nYou've spent all that time hardening up a\nnetwork and implementing things like IDSs\n\n640\n00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:03.690\nand IPSs and firewall rules and\nantivirus systems, just so say, oh,\n\n641\n00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:08.880\nwell I know I've done all that, but walk\non in and enjoy the buffet of my data.\n\n642\n00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.650\nNo, no, no.\nWe have to look at it,\n\n643\n00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:14.320\nalmost kind of think of yourself\nthrough the bad guy's eyes, right.\n\n644\n00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:19.270\nThis is spy craft 101 right, I want\nsee how if I wanted to grab this data\n\n645\n00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:22.060\nphysically, how would I go about this?\n\n646\n00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:26.260\nAnd physical security really\nyou can not over look that.\n\n647\n00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:28.950\nMike, I think you've done\na great job of showing us of how\n\n648\n00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:33.420\nreally important that is,\nto harden that area of our network up.\n\n649\n00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:34.120\n>> Good deal, good deal.\n\n650\n00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:35.860\nYeah, it can't be stressed enough.\n\n651\n00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:39.550\nJust one last example I'll also give you,\na high security example.\n\n652\n00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:42.430\nI went down and did some work for\na local energy company.\n\n653\n00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:45.400\nAnd this energy company\nmanaged nuclear power plants,\n\n654\n00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.660\nI wasn't at the nuclear power plant,\nbut their systems were tied in.\n\n655\n00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:52.730\nWhen I walked into that building, I had to\ngo up to the front desk and I had to get\n\n656\n00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:57.320\na badge and I told the gentleman that\nwas working there who I was here to see.\n\n657\n00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:59.150\nHe said there's the elevator\nbank over there,\n\n658\n00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:01.380\nyou're going to get on\nelevator number two.\n\n659\n00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:02.130\nIt was kind of odd.\n\n660\n00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:05.750\nI walk over there and there's three\nelevators, no buttons, right.\n\n661\n00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:09.920\nHe called the elevator and number two\ncomes down and the doors open up.\n\n662\n00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:13.770\nI get on there and the doors close and\nagain, there's no buttons.\n\n663\n00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:17.330\nAnd he sends it up to the floor\nthat I'm supposed to get off at.\n\n664\n00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:20.340\nI get off the elevator,\nthere's another set of glass doors.\n\n665\n00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:21.650\nThe elevator's closing behind me,\n\n666\n00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:24.240\nand there's the set of\nglass doors in front of me.\n\n667\n00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.440\nI can't get through there.\n\n668\n00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:29.730\nI can't get back down the elevator\nuntil somebody comes, and lets me in.\n\n669\n00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:31.060\nThese are the kind of things that,\n\n670\n00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:34.660\nwhen you talk about physical security,\nthis is what we're referring to.\n\n671\n00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:35.570\n>> That's right.\n\n672\n00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:37.430\nAll right, everyone,\nlooks like we've come to the end of yet\n\n673\n00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:39.820\nanother great episode here at ITProTV.\n\n674\n00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:40.770\nThanks for watching.\n\n675\n00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:43.050\nSigning off,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n676\n00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:44.388\n>> I'm Mike Rodrick.\n>> And we'll see you next

another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.810\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and joining\nme yet again today in the studios, Mr.\n\n5\n00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.020\nMike Roderick.\n\n6\n00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.960\nHow's it going, Mikey?\n\n7\n00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.570\n>> Oh, it's going great.\n\n8\n00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.720\nI'd rather join you outside, It's\na beautiful fall day here in Florida, but\n\n9\n00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.795\nthe studio is just as good, I suppose.\n\n10\n00:00:29.795 --> 00:00:34.396\n[LAUGH] All right, well, we've got more\nof our MTA content coming your way,\n\n11\n00:00:34.396 --> 00:00:40.970\nwe are going to be doing our internet\nsecurity today, if there is such a thing.\n\n12\n00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.710\nIt's like an oxymoron I believe,\nI'm not sure [LAUGH].\n\n13\n00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.150\n>> Yeah I think it goes back to your whole\nidea of encasing your computer in a thing\n\n14\n00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.940\nof concrete Chucking it into the ocean and\nthen yes, as long as\n\n15\n00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.872\nit's not plugged into the internet,\nyou're probably pretty secure, right?\n\n16\n00:00:54.872 --> 00:00:56.990\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly, exactly.\n\n17\n00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.990\nNow it is important that we understand the\ndifferent security options are available,\n\n18\n00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.600\nbecause we know the internet can be\na scary place, there's lots of bad people\n\n19\n00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.780\nout there that want to get access to our\nmachines, get access to our data, and so\n\n20\n00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.080\nwe've got to make sure we're doing\nthe best we can to keep them out, right?\n\n21\n00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.520\nAnd so, making them unsuccessful.\n\n22\n00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.000\nAnd that starts with our browser,\n\n23\n00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.160\nbecause our browser is typically our end\nusers way to get access to the internet.\n\n24\n00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.886\nWell, it is their way to\nget access to the internet.\n\n25\n00:01:22.886 --> 00:01:25.730\nSo we've got to make sure that we\nunderstand all the different settings and\n\n26\n00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.040\noptions that are available to help\nkeep that as secure as possible.\n\n27\n00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.110\nIt's still going to come down to the end\nto user education, all right but\n\n28\n00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.180\nwe definitely have some settings\nwe can configure to try to\n\n29\n00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.970\nmake it a little bit easier for them.\n\n30\n00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.440\nSo let's start by taking a look at my\nscreen here, I've got a typical browser\n\n31\n00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.890\nopen to everybody's favorite,\nInternet Explorer, right?\n\n32\n00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.610\nI know that's what everybody uses.\n\n33\n00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.510\nBut it will be on the exam,\nsince this is a Microsoft exam.\n\n34\n00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.200\nAll right, so the first thing I want to\ndo is just pull up our settings here.\n\n35\n00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.755\nSo I'm going to go up to my little gear\nicon, and click on internet options.\n\n36\n00:01:59.755 --> 00:02:03.985\nThis is where I will find most of my\nsettings that I can deal with for\n\n37\n00:02:03.985 --> 00:02:05.345\nInternet Explorer.\n\n38\n00:02:05.345 --> 00:02:09.585\nAnd a couple things that we want to talk\nabout and take a look at, the first one\n\n39\n00:02:09.585 --> 00:02:15.260\nthat they talk about Is cookies, and\nI know everybody loves a good cookie.\n\n40\n00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.230\nBut unlike our chocolate chip friends and\nour peanut butter friends and\n\n41\n00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.750\nthings like that, when we talk about\ncookies on the Internet, they can,\n\n42\n00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.100\nhow should I say this, they can be\nhelpful, but they can also be malicious,\n\n43\n00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.370\ndepending on how they are used, and\nif we allow people access to them.\n\n44\n00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.660\nThose first define what the heck\na cookie is, just in case we're unaware.\n\n45\n00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.810\nA cookie's just a small file that is going\nto be stored on your computer, locally.\n\n46\n00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.080\nAnd depending on how they've written\nthe web page and how they've designed it,\n\n47\n00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.790\nit could store anything from simply your\nlogon name to credit card information,\n\n48\n00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.550\nand all kinds of stuff.\n\n49\n00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.190\nAnd a good aspect, right,\n\n50\n00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.260\na cookie is beneficial because when I\ngo back to a site, it knows who I am.\n\n51\n00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.580\nIt remembers things about me and\nwhen I go to Amazon,\n\n52\n00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.710\nit says hey Mike, there's a new\nbook in your favorites section.\n\n53\n00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.210\nYou might want to go check it out,\nwell how does it know that?\n\n54\n00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.760\nBecause it stored information about me\non my computer in little cookie when I\n\n55\n00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.860\nconnect to that website it can retrieve\nthat cookie, it can figure out who I am\n\n56\n00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.330\nAnd it can then change the webpage\ndynamically to suit me, all right?\n\n57\n00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.090\nThat's what makes it individual to me\nversus if Daniel goes to the same site,\n\n58\n00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.870\nhe sees different things, all right?\n\n59\n00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.690\nAlso make it convenient for us because we\ncan do things like one click shopping, and\n\n60\n00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.100\nhopefully they're not storing that\non our computer, but they could.\n\n61\n00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.530\nThey can store credit\ncard number information.\n\n62\n00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.430\nBut a lot of personally\nidentifiable information can be\n\n63\n00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.980\nlocated in those cookies.\n\n64\n00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.520\nAnd like I said,\nthey can be beneficial, but\n\n65\n00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.450\nif the wrong person gets them,\nnow we're in trouble.\n\n66\n00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.080\nRight?\n\n67\n00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.660\nBecause they could take that put it on\ntheir machine and they could attempt to go\n\n68\n00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.770\nto that website as us, potentially\nhave access to our information,\n\n69\n00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.750\nour credit cards things like that.\n\n70\n00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.610\nSo we've got to make sure that\nwe're being safe with these, and\n\n71\n00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.100\ninternet explorer gives us a way to\ndeal with these cookies settings.\n\n72\n00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.180\nOn the privacy tab, there's this\n\n73\n00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.940\nslider here that I can use, and\nthis controls basically cookies.\n\n74\n00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.290\nAnd you'll see the different\noptions as I slide through here.\n\n75\n00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.760\nIf I go all the way up to the top\nit says block all cookies.\n\n76\n00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.340\nThat means any website that I visit that\ntries to put a cookie on my computer,\n\n77\n00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.250\nas well as any website that tries to\nextract information from a cooking that\n\n78\n00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.900\nalready exists on my computer,\nit's not going to be allowed.\n\n79\n00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.380\nWe're saying no.\n\n80\n00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.190\nNo cookies for you.\n\n81\n00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.890\nAlright?\n\n82\n00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.342\nI can slide that down a little bit and\n\n83\n00:04:39.342 --> 00:04:43.610\nthis will block cookies from websites that\ndo not have a compact privacy policy.\n\n84\n00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.750\nThis is something that the computers\nare going to negotiate\n\n85\n00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.630\nwhen you first connect to that website.\n\n86\n00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.740\nIt has a little privacy policy\nthat get's sent over your machine,\n\n87\n00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.810\nif they've got one of those, it will allow\nthem to store a cookie on your computer,\n\n88\n00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.090\nand if it doesn't, then it won't allow it.\n\n89\n00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.000\nIt also says that it's going\nto block cookies that save\n\n90\n00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.670\ninformation that can be used to\ncontact you without explicit consent.\n\n91\n00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.429\nSo you're going to have\nto click on something and\n\n92\n00:05:08.429 --> 00:05:11.780\nsay yes it's okay to use that information.\n\n93\n00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.380\nAs we go down a little bit further, I got\nmedium which blocks third party cookies.\n\n94\n00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.920\nNotice the difference here, block all\ncookies that do not have a compact privacy\n\n95\n00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:26.090\npolicy, block third party cookies that\ndo not have a compact privacy policy.\n\n96\n00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.660\nThe heck is a third party?\n\n97\n00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.950\nWell if I go to chevrolet.com and\nthere's a banner ad from Firestone, and\n\n98\n00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.020\nFirestone wants to put a cookie on my\ncomputer, that's a third party, right?\n\n99\n00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.160\nI'm choosing to deal with Chevrolet,\nI don't have any decision\n\n100\n00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.100\non what ads they have, what companies\nthey have on their advertisements.\n\n101\n00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.650\nMaybe I have something against\nFirestone or what, you know.\n\n102\n00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:50.930\nSo that would be a third party.\n\n103\n00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.520\nSomebody that I didn't\nexplicitly deal with,\n\n104\n00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.960\ntrying to put a cookie on my computer.\n\n105\n00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.320\nGo down a little but further, kind of same\nthing here, block third-party cookies that\n\n106\n00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.550\ndon't have a compact privacy policy,\nas well as third-party cookies that\n\n107\n00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.498\ncan use our information to contact\nus without explicit consent.\n\n108\n00:06:08.498 --> 00:06:11.610\nAnd restrict first-party cookies that save\ninformation that can be used to contact\n\n109\n00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.390\nyou without your implicit consent, so that\nwas saying even if you didn't click it,\n\n110\n00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:21.470\nif they're going to use that information\nto contact you hey you visited our site,\n\n111\n00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.460\nthat must mean you want us to contact you.\n\n112\n00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.270\nRight?\nThat would be an implicit agreement,\n\n113\n00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.720\nit would block those.\n\n114\n00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.930\nI go down a little bit further and\nnow all of a sudden all we're blocking\n\n115\n00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.495\nare third-party cookies that\ndon't have a privacy policy, and\n\n116\n00:06:34.495 --> 00:06:39.540\nthird-party cookies that are going to\nuse my info without implicit consent.\n\n117\n00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.330\nAnd then all the way at the bottom,\naccept all cookies.\n\n118\n00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.390\nThat's a pretty self-explanatory one.\n\n119\n00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.860\nSo what we have to do is find\nthe one that works best for us.\n\n120\n00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.320\nAnd you might be tempted, well, shoot,\nMike, the way you make it sound,\n\n121\n00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.010\nI'm just going to put it up here.\n\n122\n00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.650\nThe problem with that is, some websites\nrely on cookies for functionality.\n\n123\n00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:02.100\nIf they can't store a little bit of\ninformation about you on your computer,\n\n124\n00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.000\nthe site itself won't work.\n\n125\n00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.010\nThey don't store all this from their\nmillions of customers on their web server.\n\n126\n00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.980\nThey depend on being able to\nstore information on your end.\n\n127\n00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.950\nSo when you visit the website,\nit can retrieve the information.\n\n128\n00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:17.460\nSo hey, yeah, you've still got items in\nyour cart from the last time you visited.\n\n129\n00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.380\nSo they rely on that and\nwithout it, they won't work.\n\n130\n00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.872\n>> And then they blame you for\nthe data breach.\n\n131\n00:07:21.872 --> 00:07:22.704\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n132\n00:07:22.704 --> 00:07:23.634\n>> Hey, you should have been\n\n133\n00:07:23.634 --> 00:07:24.424\na little more secure.\n\n134\n00:07:24.424 --> 00:07:25.970\n[LAUGH]\n>> See how that works?\n\n135\n00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:30.930\n>> [LAUGH] So what you have to do\nas a company or as an individual\n\n136\n00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:34.510\nif this is your machine, we have to\nfigure out what works best for us.\n\n137\n00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:39.400\nFind where you can put this slider that\nwill allow those websites that you go to,\n\n138\n00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:44.870\nto still be functional, yet\nblock as much other stuff as possible.\n\n139\n00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.380\nI like to go this route.\n\n140\n00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.630\nI like to start up here,\nand then work my way down.\n\n141\n00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.853\nAnd if I find sites that don't work,\nI can come in here and\n\n142\n00:07:52.853 --> 00:07:55.010\nslide this down a little bit further.\n\n143\n00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:56.496\nBut I won't go too far.\n\n144\n00:07:56.496 --> 00:08:01.315\nThe cool thing about this slider,\nthis is precise in the internet zone.\n\n145\n00:08:01.315 --> 00:08:04.670\nWhich means sites that\nI've never been to before.\n\n146\n00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:09.278\nSites that haven't been classified as\nany other category appear here, right.\n\n147\n00:08:09.278 --> 00:08:12.215\nNow let's say I wanna block cookies.\n\n148\n00:08:12.215 --> 00:08:14.170\nI like to keep this up here,\n\n149\n00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:18.855\nbut I've got a particular site I\nknow won't work with this here.\n\n150\n00:08:18.855 --> 00:08:22.570\nWell I can come into my sites and\nI can add a site.\n\n151\n00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:26.846\nI could come in here and say all right,\n\n152\n00:08:26.846 --> 00:08:30.731\nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n153\n00:08:30.731 --> 00:08:34.115\nI can go ahead and say hey,\nI'm gonna allow those, always.\n\n154\n00:08:34.115 --> 00:08:36.060\nNo matter what my slider is set to,\n\n155\n00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:39.345\nHotmail's allowed to use\ncookies because I trust them.\n\n156\n00:08:39.345 --> 00:08:40.805\nI can also do just the opposite.\n\n157\n00:08:40.805 --> 00:08:43.045\nI could choose to block a particular site.\n\n158\n00:08:43.045 --> 00:08:45.025\nI need to move that slider down, but\n\n159\n00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:47.741\nI know there's this one\nsite that I have to go to.\n\n160\n00:08:47.741 --> 00:08:50.635\nBut I'm not real sure about what\nthey're doing with their cookies, or\n\n161\n00:08:50.635 --> 00:08:52.141\nI have some reason not to trust them.\n\n162\n00:08:52.141 --> 00:08:56.117\nI could block them from ever being\nallowed to put a cookie on here,\n\n163\n00:08:56.117 --> 00:08:58.780\neven no matter what my slider is set to.\n\n164\n00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.950\n>> So you're kinda whitelisting or\nblacklisting things on a one-by-one basis\n\n165\n00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.390\n>> Instead of using the overarching\n\n166\n00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:07.130\nof the slider mechanism.\n\n167\n00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:10.570\n>> Exactly right Daniel, and that way\nyou've got the best of both worlds.\n\n168\n00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:15.540\nYou can find a point in here that works\nbest for most sites, and keeps you safe.\n\n169\n00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.920\nBut then if you have a site\nthat just won't work,\n\n170\n00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.590\ninstead of reducing\nsecurity on everything,\n\n171\n00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:25.210\nyou can reduce security on just that one\nsite, or you can just block that one site.\n\n172\n00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:29.403\nSo they give us plenty of control over the\nway our computer deals with these cookies\n\n173\n00:09:29.403 --> 00:09:30.575\nfrom these web sites.\n\n174\n00:09:30.575 --> 00:09:32.716\nSome other things that we\nhave in here in Privacy.\n\n175\n00:09:32.716 --> 00:09:35.956\nNever allow web sites to\nrequest your physical location.\n\n176\n00:09:35.956 --> 00:09:38.816\nIt's one of those things that\nlately has changed right?\n\n177\n00:09:38.816 --> 00:09:40.622\nWe've seen it a lot with our smart phones.\n\n178\n00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:43.972\nAnd as we've progressed through\nthese operating systems,\n\n179\n00:09:43.972 --> 00:09:46.280\nnow they can do location based services.\n\n180\n00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:48.480\nSo I might say, you know what?\n\n181\n00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.060\nI don't want them to know where I am.\n\n182\n00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.420\nYou can also clear sites.\n\n183\n00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:56.930\nIf a site has already been given\npermission to use your location and\n\n184\n00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.090\nyou don't want them anymore.\n\n185\n00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:02.360\nI can go in and clear the list of sites\nthat's allowed to request my location.\n\n186\n00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.277\nDown below that,\nI've got my pop-up blocker.\n\n187\n00:10:06.277 --> 00:10:08.193\nAnd we all know what a pop-up is.\n\n188\n00:10:08.193 --> 00:10:12.273\nThose annoying things that get in my way\nwhen I'm trying to do something on my\n\n189\n00:10:12.273 --> 00:10:14.100\nscreen here, I can turn that on.\n\n190\n00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:19.740\nMost browsers, including IE, have some\ntype of pop-up blocker built into them.\n\n191\n00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.560\nWe can turn it on, that's our first step.\n\n192\n00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.850\nThen we can click on Settings and\nwe can go a little further.\n\n193\n00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:27.860\nSimilar to what we just talked\nabout with the cookies.\n\n194\n00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:33.300\nI can come in here and I can add sites\nthat I allow to use pop-up, right?\n\n195\n00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.632\nLike some sites,\nwhen you click on an item.\n\n196\n00:10:36.632 --> 00:10:41.281\nThe preview for the item; the description,\nmaybe you're trying to buy something and\n\n197\n00:10:41.281 --> 00:10:42.819\nyou click on the image of it.\n\n198\n00:10:42.819 --> 00:10:45.619\nAnd it has a little pop-up window\nthat gives you more details about\n\n199\n00:10:45.619 --> 00:10:47.170\nthat particular item.\n\n200\n00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:50.070\nWell, if you're blocking pop-ups,\nthat might not work, right?\n\n201\n00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:51.751\nYou keep clicking and nothing happens.\n\n202\n00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:53.458\nWell, come in here and add that site.\n\n203\n00:10:53.458 --> 00:10:57.200\nSay, you know what, I'm gonna allow www,\n\n204\n00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:02.071\nand let's do it the right way here,\nwww.newegg.com.\n\n205\n00:11:02.071 --> 00:11:04.474\nI'm gonna go ahead,\nallow pop-ups from them.\n\n206\n00:11:04.474 --> 00:11:08.595\nBecause I know after visiting their site,\nthat they rely on pop-ups.\n\n207\n00:11:08.595 --> 00:11:10.395\nThey use pop-ups to give me information.\n\n208\n00:11:10.395 --> 00:11:12.055\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and allow them.\n\n209\n00:11:12.055 --> 00:11:17.446\nDown below I can have a notification\npop up if any time they block a pop-up.\n\n210\n00:11:17.446 --> 00:11:20.245\nOkay, so we'll block at one pop or\nplacing it with another pop up, right?\n\n211\n00:11:20.245 --> 00:11:21.662\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know,\n\n212\n00:11:21.662 --> 00:11:23.559\nat least it's a trusted pop up, right?\n\n213\n00:11:23.559 --> 00:11:27.355\n[LAUGH] You call it a notification and\nit's okay.\n\n214\n00:11:27.355 --> 00:11:28.799\nYou call it a pop-up and it's a bad thing.\n\n215\n00:11:28.799 --> 00:11:30.764\n>> Yeah, all of a sudden\neverybody's hair catches on fire.\n\n216\n00:11:30.764 --> 00:11:33.907\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now, Mike I've actually seen this and\n\n217\n00:11:33.907 --> 00:11:36.908\nhad to use this quite\na lot in a work setting,\n\n218\n00:11:36.908 --> 00:11:40.981\nbecause a lot of companies now\nbase their products online.\n\n219\n00:11:40.981 --> 00:11:43.663\nNow, if you needed to access their portal.\n\n220\n00:11:43.663 --> 00:11:46.901\nBanks do this a lot,\ninsurance companies do this a lot.\n\n221\n00:11:46.901 --> 00:11:51.248\nThey'll have a web based portal for which\nyou'd be able to log into their system,\n\n222\n00:11:51.248 --> 00:11:54.500\nand work with things through\nthat nice web interface.\n\n223\n00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:58.250\nBut a lot of times they program\nthose things to work with pop-ups.\n\n224\n00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:01.430\nSo I'll get users calling and saying\nall right okay, nothings working here.\n\n225\n00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.747\nI'm clicking on the item and\nnothings happening.\n\n226\n00:12:03.747 --> 00:12:06.464\nSo I'm having to go in here and\nadd those as exceptions.\n\n227\n00:12:06.464 --> 00:12:10.584\nSo that they continue to\nget nice block-up pop.\n\n228\n00:12:10.584 --> 00:12:12.487\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I can not say that word.\n\n229\n00:12:12.487 --> 00:12:14.293\nBlock [LAUGH] the pop-ups.\n\n230\n00:12:14.293 --> 00:12:14.846\n>> Yeah, there you go.\n[LAUGH]\n\n231\n00:12:14.846 --> 00:12:16.573\n>> That they don't want on sites that\n\n232\n00:12:16.573 --> 00:12:18.190\nthey go to that are just random.\n\n233\n00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:21.499\nAnd do allow the ones from the sites\nthat they do want them from.\n\n234\n00:12:21.499 --> 00:12:24.052\nSo it's very helpful to have that option.\n\n235\n00:12:24.052 --> 00:12:25.171\n>> It definitely is, yeah.\n\n236\n00:12:25.171 --> 00:12:29.439\nBecause as you say,\nsome sites just require those pop-ups.\n\n237\n00:12:29.439 --> 00:12:33.840\nSo we can't just block them blanket or\nwe're gonna lose functionality.\n\n238\n00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:37.645\nThey've also got a little drop down list\nhere that you can use for the overall\n\n239\n00:12:37.645 --> 00:12:43.590\npop-up settings by default on IE,\nmedium, block most automatic pop ups.\n\n240\n00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:44.490\nI can put it on high,\n\n241\n00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:49.050\nblock all pop-ups, I can put it on low,\nallow pop-ups from secure sites.\n\n242\n00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:52.930\nSo if it's an HTTPS site,\nI can allow pop-ups there.\n\n243\n00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:56.670\nSo like the cookies,\nI can do an overarching Setting, but\n\n244\n00:12:56.670 --> 00:13:00.860\nthen I can also fine tune it with this\nlist of sites that I want to allow.\n\n245\n00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.673\nSo pop-ups, annoying, but\nhey we can do something about it.\n\n246\n00:13:05.673 --> 00:13:10.095\nDown below disable toolbar and extensions\nwhen in private browsing starts.\n\n247\n00:13:10.095 --> 00:13:15.044\nNow an in private browsing session is\none of those sessions where we disable\n\n248\n00:13:15.044 --> 00:13:17.329\nalmost all of our functionality.\n\n249\n00:13:17.329 --> 00:13:22.553\nWe don't allow, we're temporarily\nstarting a session that's not\n\n250\n00:13:22.553 --> 00:13:28.868\ngoing to allow any tracking, any location\nrequests, any should be any pop-ups.\n\n251\n00:13:28.868 --> 00:13:31.692\nMost of your, and\nin this case, your toolbars and\n\n252\n00:13:31.692 --> 00:13:34.129\nextensions are also going to be disabled.\n\n253\n00:13:34.129 --> 00:13:37.370\nSo all those handy toolbars you've added,\nthey would be disabled there.\n\n254\n00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:41.740\nIf you didn't want that, if you still\nwanted to use your toolbars and extensions\n\n255\n00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:47.510\neven when you do it in private browsing,\nyou could uncheck this check mark.\n\n256\n00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:50.755\nAnd just to show you an in\nprivate browsing session.\n\n257\n00:13:50.755 --> 00:13:54.500\nIf I right-click down here,\nI can do start InPrivate browsing session.\n\n258\n00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:59.156\nAnd you can see when my InPrivate is\nturned on, you'll see this indicator,\n\n259\n00:13:59.156 --> 00:14:03.697\nit says InPrivate right up there, and\nit's not gonna allow any cookies.\n\n260\n00:14:03.697 --> 00:14:06.468\nIt's not gonna track my history either.\n\n261\n00:14:06.468 --> 00:14:10.300\nI've heard this jokingly referred to\nseveral things that I probably shouldn't\n\n262\n00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.494\nmention here on screen.\n\n263\n00:14:11.494 --> 00:14:14.919\nWhy do we have this other\nthan those bad reasons?\n\n264\n00:14:14.919 --> 00:14:19.616\nHonestly this is really handy when I'm\nvisiting a customer and I need to,\n\n265\n00:14:19.616 --> 00:14:22.059\nhey can I borrow one of your machines?\n\n266\n00:14:22.059 --> 00:14:26.595\nI need to log back into work and check\non inventory before say we can do this,\n\n267\n00:14:26.595 --> 00:14:28.111\nor something like that.\n\n268\n00:14:28.111 --> 00:14:31.544\nWell I don't want to leave that\ncomputer with that history on there,\n\n269\n00:14:31.544 --> 00:14:35.331\nbecause then their employee when I leave\ncould attempt to retrace my steps or\n\n270\n00:14:35.331 --> 00:14:36.880\nsomething like that, right?\n\n271\n00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:40.720\nIt's just the potential there for\nsome misuse.\n\n272\n00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.488\nSo by launching up an in private session\nno history, no cookies, no nothing is\n\n273\n00:14:44.488 --> 00:14:47.583\ngonna be left on that machine and\nI don't have to worry about it.\n\n274\n00:14:47.583 --> 00:14:51.121\nPublic computers, another great\nplace to use in private sessions,\n\n275\n00:14:51.121 --> 00:14:54.476\nbecause I don't want the person\ncoming in behind me going back and\n\n276\n00:14:54.476 --> 00:14:58.203\nlooking at everything I did and\npotentially trying to retrace my steps.\n\n277\n00:14:58.203 --> 00:15:01.899\nAnd figure out how to get to my\norder page on my Amazon account,\n\n278\n00:15:01.899 --> 00:15:04.827\nbecause I always do that\nfrom a public computer.\n\n279\n00:15:04.827 --> 00:15:07.114\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you get the idea right.\n\n280\n00:15:07.114 --> 00:15:09.791\nAnytime you don't want any\nhistory left on there,\n\n281\n00:15:09.791 --> 00:15:12.210\nin private sessions are the way to go.\n\n282\n00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:14.190\nBut again,\nit'll be limited functionality, right?\n\n283\n00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:18.540\nMost of your extensions and toolbars will\nbe disabled along with the cookies and\n\n284\n00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.260\nthe pop-ups and the history.\n\n285\n00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:26.497\nAll right, so lot of settings that\nwe can use to control our privacy.\n\n286\n00:15:26.497 --> 00:15:28.934\nOther things we need to take a look at,\n\n287\n00:15:28.934 --> 00:15:34.051\nare the way Internet Explorer handles\nsecurity, and it does it on a zone basis.\n\n288\n00:15:34.051 --> 00:15:38.800\nIf I head over here to the security tab,\nyou're gonna see four zones listed here.\n\n289\n00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:43.360\nI've got my Internet,\nmy local intranet, my trusted sites and\n\n290\n00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.000\nmy restricted sites, right?\n\n291\n00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.690\nAnd the way this works,\nthe Internet is the catch-all, right?\n\n292\n00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:51.861\nAnything that doesn't fall into one of\nthese other three categories gets dumped\n\n293\n00:15:51.861 --> 00:15:53.529\ninto the Internet, all right.\n\n294\n00:15:53.529 --> 00:15:57.841\nLocal intranet,\nthese are sites that are on my company's\n\n295\n00:15:57.841 --> 00:16:02.681\nnetwork like our Calendar or\nsome internal website that we use for\n\n296\n00:16:02.681 --> 00:16:07.780\ndevelopment or messages or\nwhatever the case maybe, right?\n\n297\n00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:12.902\nThat the local intranet,\nnotice the default is actually\n\n298\n00:16:12.902 --> 00:16:17.612\nset to medium low and\nit allows most functionality.\n\n299\n00:16:17.612 --> 00:16:19.837\nIt's my company,\nI should be able to trust it, right?\n\n300\n00:16:19.837 --> 00:16:23.025\nSo most content will be\nrun without prompting you,\n\n301\n00:16:23.025 --> 00:16:26.299\nunsigned ActiveX controls\nwill not be downloaded.\n\n302\n00:16:26.299 --> 00:16:28.214\nSo it's still gonna keep\nme safe from those.\n\n303\n00:16:28.214 --> 00:16:31.836\nSame as medium level,\nbut without the prompts.\n\n304\n00:16:31.836 --> 00:16:35.490\nAll right, and you can adjust this slider.\n\n305\n00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:38.320\nI'll come back and talk about that,\nthat's just the default setting for\n\n306\n00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.120\nthe local intranet.\n\n307\n00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.768\nThese sites are typically\ndetected automatically.\n\n308\n00:16:41.768 --> 00:16:44.913\nIf it sees your computer's\npart of a lab.net and\n\n309\n00:16:44.913 --> 00:16:47.914\nthe website you're visiting to is lab.net.\n\n310\n00:16:47.914 --> 00:16:50.536\nThen it says hey,\nthis is probably an internal site.\n\n311\n00:16:50.536 --> 00:16:52.910\nI'll go ahead and\nadd it to the local intranet.\n\n312\n00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:57.650\nSo typically we don't have to decide what\ngoes into this zone, although we can.\n\n313\n00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:59.760\nIf one of them,\nin fact they've got it unchecked here,\n\n314\n00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.730\nautomatically detect intranet network.\n\n315\n00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:05.330\nI could go ahead and check that,\nit should automatically.\n\n316\n00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:09.210\nOtherwise, I'm gonna have to come in here\nand manually add sites to this zone,\n\n317\n00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:11.290\nall right?\n\n318\n00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:13.520\nThen you've got your trusted sites.\n\n319\n00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.170\nThese are sites that you trust\n\n320\n00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:18.380\nthat are not going to do\nanything bad to your computer.\n\n321\n00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.377\nNothing gets put in here automatically.\n\n322\n00:17:20.377 --> 00:17:26.043\nWe're gonna go to our sites button and\nthis is where we would adds thing like.\n\n323\n00:17:26.043 --> 00:17:34.330\nLet's see here, So\nwe can add URLs in here.\n\n324\n00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.165\nNow it does require,\nthere's a check mark here Here this says\n\n325\n00:17:37.165 --> 00:17:41.025\nrequire server verification (https:) for\nall sites in this zone.\n\n326\n00:17:41.025 --> 00:17:42.725\nAnd that's probably a good idea.\n\n327\n00:17:42.725 --> 00:17:46.755\nYou can uncheck that if you want, and\n\n328\n00:17:46.755 --> 00:17:52.735\nyou can add a site that doesn't\nhave SSL if you want to.\n\n329\n00:17:52.735 --> 00:17:58.470\nAnd then you can turn this back on so\nthat other sites that you had require SSL.\n\n330\n00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:02.169\nBut remember if you add it to your trusted\nsites the default there is medium.\n\n331\n00:18:02.169 --> 00:18:05.791\nIt's gonna prompt before downloading\npotentially unsafe content,\n\n332\n00:18:05.791 --> 00:18:08.500\nunsigned ActiveX controls\nwill not be downloaded.\n\n333\n00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:13.951\nSo the security on the trusted\nsites is relatively light, right?\n\n334\n00:18:13.951 --> 00:18:15.855\nBecause you're saying hey I trust them.\n\n335\n00:18:15.855 --> 00:18:21.005\nI know this site it's my, a partner that\nwe have to do a lot of business with,\n\n336\n00:18:21.005 --> 00:18:23.780\nand I need everything to function.\n\n337\n00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.300\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and add him there.\n\n338\n00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:30.210\nAnd again trust that site, they're not\ngonna do anything bad to my computer.\n\n339\n00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:34.030\nThe last one is my restricted sites and\n\n340\n00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:36.900\nyou see the slider by\ndefault is set to high.\n\n341\n00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:40.649\nThese are sites that might or\nare known to cause problems.\n\n342\n00:18:40.649 --> 00:18:44.333\nA lot of times, these'll come out\nthrough bulletins at the company level.\n\n343\n00:18:44.333 --> 00:18:48.850\nThey'll say hey, and they'll typically\ndo it for you in a company environment.\n\n344\n00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:52.204\nThey're gonna add somebody,\nbut maybe you're in a SOHO and\n\n345\n00:18:52.204 --> 00:18:55.707\nyour computer got infected the last\ntime you went to this site.\n\n346\n00:18:55.707 --> 00:18:58.691\nWell, you wanna dump them\nin your restricted site.\n\n347\n00:18:58.691 --> 00:19:01.452\nSo that if you accidentally\ngo back there again, or\n\n348\n00:19:01.452 --> 00:19:05.500\nmaybe you need to go to this site,\nbut you know they're not.\n\n349\n00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.210\nI don't wanna say they're\nnot trust worthy.\n\n350\n00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:13.000\nBut I have dealt with sites where I really\nneeded to get some stuff off that site.\n\n351\n00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.330\nBut it was a little suspicious and\nI really didn't trust them.\n\n352\n00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:17.070\nI put them in here.\n\n353\n00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:19.170\nI don't need their other stuff working.\n\n354\n00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:20.880\nI don't want any ActiveX\ncontrols firing off.\n\n355\n00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:21.900\nNone of that, but\n\n356\n00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:26.053\nI still need to go to that site you can\ndump them in your restricted sites.\n\n357\n00:19:26.053 --> 00:19:29.397\nAgain, nothing happens manually or\nautomatically.\n\n358\n00:19:29.397 --> 00:19:31.417\nYou have to manually add those guys there.\n\n359\n00:19:31.417 --> 00:19:35.865\nKeep in mind restricted sites does not\nprevent you from going to the site,\n\n360\n00:19:35.865 --> 00:19:36.591\nall right.\n\n361\n00:19:36.591 --> 00:19:41.350\nSo it's not gonna stop your\nusers from visiting xyz.com.\n\n362\n00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:44.280\nIt is however,\nwhen they do visit that site,\n\n363\n00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.678\nit's going to prevent anything\nfrom running on that webpage.\n\n364\n00:19:47.678 --> 00:19:51.301\nSo those ActiveX controls and things\nlike that, those will all be blocked,\n\n365\n00:19:51.301 --> 00:19:53.633\nthat's the idea behind\nyour restricted sites.\n\n366\n00:19:53.633 --> 00:19:56.419\nEach one of these you saw has the slider.\n\n367\n00:19:56.419 --> 00:19:58.950\nThese are just my default settings.\n\n368\n00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:00.610\nSo as you go through here.\n\n369\n00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:04.140\nI can adjust any one of these\nsliders to whatever I need,\n\n370\n00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.070\nthey give you a great description.\n\n371\n00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:07.850\nYou can also do a custom level.\n\n372\n00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:11.680\nIf the slider doesn't give you enough\ncontrol, you can come in here and\n\n373\n00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:17.390\nyou can manually select what it is you\nwant to allow, block, or have prompt.\n\n374\n00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:19.370\nTypically, those are your three settings.\n\n375\n00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:22.640\nPrompt, let me decide\nwhether I wanna allow it.\n\n376\n00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.050\nAllow it automatically, or block it.\n\n377\n00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:29.028\nAll right, so we can come in here and\nwe can choose those types of settings.\n\n378\n00:20:29.028 --> 00:20:31.330\nI see a disable, enable, or prompt.\n\n379\n00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:34.640\nSome of them are just disable or\nenable right, but most of them are enable,\n\n380\n00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.570\ndisable, or prompt.\n\n381\n00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:40.770\nYou could also handy to reset if your user\nhas ever goofed with these settings and\n\n382\n00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:42.150\nyou want to reset it.\n\n383\n00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:45.620\nYou can click on that little button there.\n\n384\n00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:49.620\nMaybe they came in here and\nsaid oh, some site wasn't working.\n\n385\n00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:53.490\nI'm going to drag that\nslider all the way down, and\n\n386\n00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:55.470\nnow I don't know how to get back.\n\n387\n00:20:55.470 --> 00:21:00.160\nYou can just reset right, and go default\nlevel, and it'll reset that slider.\n\n388\n00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.606\nOr from that custom level,\nI can choose that reset button down here.\n\n389\n00:21:03.606 --> 00:21:07.463\nAnd you can even say oh, you know what,\nreset it to medium-low if you want.\n\n390\n00:21:07.463 --> 00:21:12.040\nSo, plenty of options in there\nif things get goofed up.\n\n391\n00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:16.120\nSo again, big thing to just see there is\nhow Internet Explorer divides everything\n\n392\n00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:20.280\nup into zones, and the security\nis handled in a per zone basis.\n\n393\n00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.870\nSo you have to come in here, and decide\nhow do you wanna treat the Internet?\n\n394\n00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:28.010\nHow do you wanna treat local intranet\nsites, trusted sites, restricted sites?\n\n395\n00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:30.930\nKeep in mind,\nthe Internet means means anything\n\n396\n00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:33.660\nthat doesn't fall in the other three,\nit's the catch all.\n\n397\n00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.731\nSo if it's not in one of the other three,\nit's part of that Internet site.\n\n398\n00:21:36.731 --> 00:21:38.502\nSo don't drop that one down too low,\n\n399\n00:21:38.502 --> 00:21:41.372\ncuz those are sites that you\ndon't know about yet, right.\n\n400\n00:21:41.372 --> 00:21:44.233\n>> Yeah.\nNow, Mike, there obviously have to be\n\n401\n00:21:44.233 --> 00:21:48.805\nsites out there that are inherently\nsecure by nature, because well heck.\n\n402\n00:21:48.805 --> 00:21:50.708\nWe do our business online nowadays.\n\n403\n00:21:50.708 --> 00:21:53.321\nMy banking is done there,\nI buy stuff online.\n\n404\n00:21:53.321 --> 00:21:55.363\nI guarantee my credit card and\n\n405\n00:21:55.363 --> 00:22:00.280\npersonal information goes\nthrough about ten servers a day.\n\n406\n00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.170\nSo how do they do that?\n\n407\n00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:04.830\nHow do we maintain a level of\nsecurity while we're out in\n\n408\n00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:06.050\nthe wilds of the Internet?\n\n409\n00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:07.940\n>> That's a great question,\nlet's take a look at it.\n\n410\n00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:13.530\nWhat he's talking about there is something\nknown as SSL or Secure Socket Layer.\n\n411\n00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:17.575\nAlthough it is being replaced\nwith something called TLS.\n\n412\n00:22:17.575 --> 00:22:19.151\nTransport layer of security.\n\n413\n00:22:19.151 --> 00:22:22.158\nSame concept,\nworks almost exactly the same.\n\n414\n00:22:22.158 --> 00:22:26.745\nLittle bit higher encryption levels, and\nthey're not compatible with each other.\n\n415\n00:22:26.745 --> 00:22:29.387\nSo we're gonna talk about SSL,\nthat's what they call it on this exam.\n\n416\n00:22:29.387 --> 00:22:33.440\nJust understand that SSL is kind\nof being replaced with TLS.\n\n417\n00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:38.207\nI shouldn't say kind of, it is being\nreplaced with TLS as we go, but\n\n418\n00:22:38.207 --> 00:22:41.320\nthe concepts are exactly the same.\n\n419\n00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:45.900\nSo SSL, Secure Socket Layer,\nwhat that means is we're gonna encrypt\n\n420\n00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:49.810\nthe traffic between me and\nthat web server, all right.\n\n421\n00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:53.530\nThat way when that data travels across\nthe network and it goes out through that\n\n422\n00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:57.670\npublic portion of the network,\ni.e., the Internet, all right.\n\n423\n00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:59.622\nIt's gonna be encrypted.\nBecause we know there are people out there\n\n424\n00:22:59.622 --> 00:23:01.098\ntrying to intercept that information.\n\n425\n00:23:01.098 --> 00:23:03.947\nAnd if they can intercept it,\nthey can read it,\n\n426\n00:23:03.947 --> 00:23:08.010\nthey can get my credit card number or\nmy login information.\n\n427\n00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:11.700\nWell, if we encrypt it, it doesn't stop\nthem from capturing the packets or\n\n428\n00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:14.640\nthe data, but\nit's unreadable because it's encrypted.\n\n429\n00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:18.785\nAnd as long as they don't have\nthe keys necessary to decrypt it,\n\n430\n00:23:18.785 --> 00:23:21.200\nit's gonna be useless to them, all right.\n\n431\n00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.001\nAnd that's the idea behind SSL.\n\n432\n00:23:23.001 --> 00:23:25.683\nWhen you look at your browsers,\nyou'll see.\n\n433\n00:23:25.683 --> 00:23:32.121\nIn fact we can take a look at mine here,\nGoogle now encrypts their connection.\n\n434\n00:23:32.121 --> 00:23:34.129\nSo you can see at the beginning\nof my line it says HTTPS.\n\n435\n00:23:34.129 --> 00:23:41.704\nThat S is for HTTP secure, which\nindicates I'm using either SSL or TLS.\n\n436\n00:23:41.704 --> 00:23:43.240\nSo you wanna look for that.\n\n437\n00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:44.990\nDifferent browsers,\nhave different ways of displaying it.\n\n438\n00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:50.500\nYou get the HTTPS, you might get a green\nbar if it's doing extended verification.\n\n439\n00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:55.262\nMost of them will show you some kind\nof little lock icon letting you know\n\n440\n00:23:55.262 --> 00:23:56.560\nthat it is secure.\n\n441\n00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.327\nAnd if I click on this,\n\n442\n00:23:58.327 --> 00:24:03.723\nI can see that the website has been\nidentified and that it is trusted.\n\n443\n00:24:03.723 --> 00:24:07.238\nThis connection to the server\nIs encrypted, now let's\n\n444\n00:24:07.238 --> 00:24:12.173\nbreak that process down, we need to\nunderstand how this is actually working,\n\n445\n00:24:12.173 --> 00:24:17.070\nso I've got a drawing I've whipped up for\nus here and let's walk through it.\n\n446\n00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:19.630\nIf when I go to connect\nto say Bank of America,\n\n447\n00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:25.150\nBank of America has a certificate\nthat was issued to their web server.\n\n448\n00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:29.680\nThat certificate is an electronic\ndocument that ties the identity of that\n\n449\n00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:33.590\nserver to a set of keys or a pair of keys.\n\n450\n00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:37.130\nAnd we're not gonna dive really deep\ninto the encryption process here.\n\n451\n00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:40.200\nWe've got other episodes in our\ncourse library that covers that.\n\n452\n00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:43.550\nHere we just need to get the basics\nof what's happening with SSL.\n\n453\n00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:48.080\nSo Bank of America went out and\napplied for a certificate from\n\n454\n00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:53.640\na third-party company like Versign or\nThwate or GTE or Equifax or whomever.\n\n455\n00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:58.630\nNow, they have a certificate that says,\nhey, I am Bank of America's web server.\n\n456\n00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:05.000\nWhen I go to connect to Bank of America,\nI type in HTTPS up there in that URL.\n\n457\n00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.740\nWhat my computer does is it\nreaches out and says hey,\n\n458\n00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:12.260\nBank of America, I wanna connect,\nbut prove to me who you are first.\n\n459\n00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:15.370\nLet me make sure that you're\nthe real Bank of America, right?\n\n460\n00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:18.720\nWill the real Bank of\nAmerica please stand up?\n\n461\n00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:22.870\nAnd what Bank of America does is it sends\nback this certificate that says yes,\n\n462\n00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:24.520\nI'll prove to you who I am.\n\n463\n00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:28.870\nHere's my certificate,\nincluded is my public key.\n\n464\n00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:31.810\nMy private key is stored\nsecurely back over here.\n\n465\n00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:32.895\nYou don't get access to that.\n\n466\n00:25:32.895 --> 00:25:35.980\nSo here's my certificate,\nhere's my public key.\n\n467\n00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:43.400\nWhat my computer then does is it checks to\nsee if the issuer, not Bank of America,\n\n468\n00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:48.250\nwhoever issued this certificate to\nBank of America, do I trust them?\n\n469\n00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:51.260\nWho did Bank of America\nget that certificate from?\n\n470\n00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:53.316\nAnd let's take a peak back over here.\n\n471\n00:25:53.316 --> 00:26:01.067\nIn fact let's just go to\nhttps://www.bankofamerica.com.\n\n472\n00:26:01.067 --> 00:26:04.475\nLet's see if I can get their\ncertificate without logging in and\n\n473\n00:26:04.475 --> 00:26:08.540\nshowing you guys all of my good stuff and\nmy $15 I have in my bank account.\n\n474\n00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:13.400\nAll right, so there's another example, you\nsee the entire bar turn green on this one\n\n475\n00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:17.240\ncuz they're doing what we call extended\nverification, like click on this little\n\n476\n00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:22.100\nlock, VeriSign has identified\nthis site as Bank of America.\n\n477\n00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.980\nSo they bought their certificate, and\n\n478\n00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:28.270\nhere's the certificate itself,\nensure the identity of a remote computer.\n\n479\n00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:30.780\nIssued to, Bank of America.\n\n480\n00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:35.690\nIssued by Symantec Class 3 ev SSL CA.G3.\n\n481\n00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:37.850\nWho the heck is that?\n\n482\n00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:40.120\nHow do I know that this is any good?\n\n483\n00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.210\nWho says Bank of America didn't\ngo down to the corner and\n\n484\n00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:44.680\nsay, hey, psst,\ncan you give me a certificate?\n\n485\n00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.240\nSomebody opens up his trench coat and\nsays, yeah, here's a certificate.\n\n486\n00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.080\nThat's not what's going on.\n\n487\n00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.530\nBut how do we know we\ntrust can trust them?\n\n488\n00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:53.314\nWell my computer has a list of, and\n\n489\n00:26:53.314 --> 00:26:58.210\nlet's go back over here to Settings and\nInternet options and\n\n490\n00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:03.682\nthen Content, and then Certificates,\nif I can get that to open up,\n\n491\n00:27:03.682 --> 00:27:08.290\nit's thinking about it it's\nlike no you can't show me.\n\n492\n00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:10.819\n>> There's so many certificates\n[CROSSTALK] trouble processing them all.\n\n493\n00:27:10.819 --> 00:27:13.845\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] There we go and then I'm going\n\n494\n00:27:13.845 --> 00:27:18.274\nto go over this trusted root certificate\nauthorities and if we take a look at\n\n495\n00:27:18.274 --> 00:27:22.960\nthis list, these are all the public\nCAs that my computer knows to trust.\n\n496\n00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:26.910\nThese are what we call root CAs,\nthere's also intermediate CAs\n\n497\n00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:31.110\nthat we can trust as well,\nand trusted publishers.\n\n498\n00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:34.565\nAnd so if we take a look\nagain at the certificate,\n\n499\n00:27:34.565 --> 00:27:39.245\nfrom Bank of America and and\nyou can see it was issued by Symantec.\n\n500\n00:27:39.245 --> 00:27:44.710\nBut if I look at the certification path,\nnotice it gets chained back up.\n\n501\n00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:46.030\nThis is known as a trust chain, and\n\n502\n00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:47.940\nwe're gonna talk much more\nabout that in another episode.\n\n503\n00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.210\nBut the very top one is Verisign.\n\n504\n00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:56.890\nAll right, in my list of trusted\nroot certificate authorities\n\n505\n00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:03.570\nand again, now we gotta wait, you can take\nmy word for it, Verisign is in that list.\n\n506\n00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:07.080\nSo my computer says, hey I trust Verisign,\n\n507\n00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:12.720\nI trust that they did their job and before\nthey issued that certificate to Bank of\n\n508\n00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:16.080\nAmerica they said alright,we're\ngonna prove who you are,\n\n509\n00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:20.080\nmake sure you're not some person\ntrying to fake being Bank of America.\n\n510\n00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:24.300\nSo my computer says all\nright,well I trust Verisign, so\n\n511\n00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:27.450\nI'm gonna trust this certificate\nthat you're presenting me.\n\n512\n00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:30.810\nNext thing it does, is it checks\nwith something called the CRL, or\n\n513\n00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:32.500\nthe certificate revocation list.\n\n514\n00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.410\nYes, I trust the certificate.\n\n515\n00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:36.340\nIs the certificate still good?\n\n516\n00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.860\nThink about your driver's\nlicense here in the US.\n\n517\n00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:41.170\nYour license might get suspended.\n\n518\n00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:44.620\nWhen it does, they don't come to your\nhouse and take your license away from you.\n\n519\n00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:45.880\nYou still have it.\n\n520\n00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:49.800\nAnd if the police officer asks you for\na license, you can still pull it out and\n\n521\n00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.030\nhand it to him, right.\n\n522\n00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:53.190\nHow does he know that your\nlicense is suspended?\n\n523\n00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:57.400\nIt doesn't say it on there, it still\nlooks like a valid drivers license.\n\n524\n00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.770\nHe goes to his computer in his car and\n\n525\n00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:01.210\npunches in your number and\nchecks the database.\n\n526\n00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:04.410\nWell that's what I'm doing here,\nthey've presented me the certificate.\n\n527\n00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:08.030\nI trust the certificate is good\nI trust who signed it, but\n\n528\n00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:11.550\nI still need to make sure it hasn't\nbeen revoked for some reason.\n\n529\n00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:15.980\nAnd that's what the certificate\nrevocation list is for Verisign,\n\n530\n00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:20.590\nthe company that issues the certificate,\npublishes this list, makes it available so\n\n531\n00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:21.870\nI can check it.\n\n532\n00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:24.400\nOnce I've validated the certificate and\n\n533\n00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:29.200\nit's not revoked, I now have a copy of\ntheir certificate and their public key.\n\n534\n00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:33.250\nMy computer then generates\na session key and says,\n\n535\n00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:37.830\nhey, I trust your certificate and it's\nvalid, here's a copy of the session key.\n\n536\n00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:42.110\nAnd it encrypts the session key\nwith the server's public key.\n\n537\n00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:46.210\nSo the only key that can decrypt\nthis is the private key.\n\n538\n00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:49.000\nAnd Bank of America is the only\none with the private key.\n\n539\n00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.980\nSo nobody can intercept this and\nget that session key.\n\n540\n00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:56.110\nOnce Bank of America has\na copy of that session key,\n\n541\n00:29:56.110 --> 00:30:00.300\nI already have a copy of it because I\ngenerated it, we now have the same key on\n\n542\n00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:04.240\neither side and we've done it in a secure\nway that nobody else can intercept it.\n\n543\n00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:07.270\nWe can now use that key to encrypt\nthe traffic that's travelling back and\n\n544\n00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:10.560\nforth between me and Bank of America.\n\n545\n00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.020\nThat's how SSO works.\n\n546\n00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:14.310\nThat's a high level overview.\n\n547\n00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:17.920\nAgain, we will talk much more about\nit in future episodes but, and\n\n548\n00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:22.250\nthat's how we make sure that\nthat data we're transmitting\n\n549\n00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:24.730\nisn't gonna be intercepted\nby the bad guys.\n\n550\n00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:26.200\nAny time you go to a site, and\n\n551\n00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.760\nyou want to put in your credit card\nnumber, you want to order product,\n\n552\n00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:33.850\nyou best make sure that up there\nin that URL there's an S in there.\n\n553\n00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:38.580\nAnd that you got that little locked icon,\nthat's your indication that it's safe and\n\n554\n00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.610\nthat as long as you trust that other end,\n\n555\n00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:42.940\nyour data's gonna be safe\ntravelling across the Internet.\n\n556\n00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:47.540\n>> Yeah, and I've heard crazy stories\nabout them creating those certificates and\n\n557\n00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:50.750\nthey have to take them from where they\ncreate them to where they store them\n\n558\n00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:52.160\nunder armed guards.\n\n559\n00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:58.070\nThese things are highly secure because\nif I got ahold of Amazon's certificate,\n\n560\n00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:01.280\nI could throw up a web server, and use\nthat certificate, and issue it out, and\n\n561\n00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:03.410\nyou could come to me and\nyou would think I was Amazon.\n\n562\n00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:05.660\nI'll just be collecting\npayments all day long.\n\n563\n00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:07.250\nAmazon's going, where's all my money at?\n\n564\n00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:08.130\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] And David's\n\n565\n00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:09.813\ndriving around in his Tesla.\n\n566\n00:31:09.813 --> 00:31:11.270\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right,\n\n567\n00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:13.020\nmy new Bentley is showing up.\n\n568\n00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:14.184\nDon't do that.\n\n569\n00:31:14.184 --> 00:31:14.966\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n570\n00:31:14.966 --> 00:31:15.470\n>> That's bad.\n\n571\n00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:17.550\n[LAUGH] But, Mike, it's a great way for\n\n572\n00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:19.390\nus to know that we are secure.\n\n573\n00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:22.970\nMake sure that lock is there, make\nsure that S is there, that way we have\n\n574\n00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:28.980\nencrypted secured data, even though it\nis traveling across unsecure means.\n\n575\n00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:31.150\n>> You're basically guarding the shoes.\n\n576\n00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:35.200\nYou're putting armed guards around your\ndata as it walks through that war zone\n\n577\n00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.760\ngetting to where it needs to go.\n\n578\n00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:38.510\nSo that's really cool that we have that.\n\n579\n00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:41.120\nMike, is there anything else that we\nneed to cover when it comes to security?\n\n580\n00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:44.140\n>> As far as the Internet security goes,\nI think we covered it all.\n\n581\n00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:44.870\nBest thing you can do for\n\n582\n00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:49.430\nthis exam is to open up your settings on\nyour browser and click through there.\n\n583\n00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:50.160\n>> Yeah.\n>> Play with them,\n\n584\n00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.830\nsee what the heck you've got.\n\n585\n00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:53.410\n>> Very smart, so that's a good idea.\n\n586\n00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:55.190\nNever be afraid to click on something,\n\n587\n00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:56.910\nsee what it'll do when it\ncomes to your computer.\n\n588\n00:31:56.910 --> 00:31:58.280\nIt's how we got into this business.\n\n589\n00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:59.960\n>> That's right. [LAUGH] >> All right,\nMike, great episode,\n\n590\n00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.160\nthank you guys for watching.\n\n591\n00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:03.420\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for today.\n\n592\n00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:05.940\nFor ITPro TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n593\n00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:06.980\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n594\n00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:08.964\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n595\n00:32:08.964 --> 00:32:14.410\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.260\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.550\nJoining me in the studio today on\nthis lovely show is Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.300\nHow's it going, Mike?\n\n7\n00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.620\n>> Oh, it's going great, Daniel.\n\n8\n00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.129\nI'm excited as always that we're\ndoing [LAUGH] our MTA content.\n\n9\n00:00:28.129 --> 00:00:31.715\nIn this one, we're gonna be taking\na look at wireless security.\n\n10\n00:00:31.715 --> 00:00:35.239\nIt's another one of those things that's\nkind of like Internet security and\n\n11\n00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.212\nwireless security,\nthey don't seem to go together very well,\n\n12\n00:00:38.212 --> 00:00:39.879\nwe gotta kinda force it sometimes.\n\n13\n00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.380\nBut in all honesty wireless\nsecurity has come a long way.\n\n14\n00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.670\nAnd with the proper setup and\n\n15\n00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.780\nthe proper care you can make\na pretty secure wireless network.\n\n16\n00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.190\nI'm not gonna say it's bulletproof, but\n\n17\n00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.290\nthen again most of my LANs\nare not bulletproof, right?\n\n18\n00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.379\nI mean, there's always a way for\nthat bad guy to get in.\n\n19\n00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.170\nBut what we've gotta understand is those\nbasic settings that we can configure to\n\n20\n00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.430\nhelp improve our wireless security.\n\n21\n00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.560\nAnd it just depends on how much money\nwe've got, what kind of system we wanna\n\n22\n00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.310\nimplement, is gonna determine how secure\nthat system's going to be, all right.\n\n23\n00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.566\nSo we gotta be familiar\nwith our options and\n\n24\n00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:17.086\nwhat some of these configurations mean,\nwhat they're gonna do.\n\n25\n00:01:17.086 --> 00:01:20.921\nAnd more importantly, what level of\nsecurity they're really gonna provide.\n\n26\n00:01:20.921 --> 00:01:25.261\nCuz I will tell you, a couple of these are\nkinda, oh, what's the term I'm looking for\n\n27\n00:01:25.261 --> 00:01:26.046\nthere Daniel?\n\n28\n00:01:26.046 --> 00:01:26.671\n>> Worthless?\n\n29\n00:01:26.671 --> 00:01:30.105\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well, I didn't want to say worthless,\n\n30\n00:01:30.105 --> 00:01:32.330\nbut, close, I mean it really is.\n\n31\n00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.080\n>> Not much better, huh?\n\n32\n00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.410\n>> They make you feel good, but\nthey might not do a lot for\n\n33\n00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.688\nyou in the end when it comes to security.\n\n34\n00:01:38.688 --> 00:01:41.990\nBut, we gotta know they're there, we've\ngotta be able to implement them because\n\n35\n00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.520\nthey're one of those better\nthan nothing type scenarios.\n\n36\n00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.240\nSo let's start with a couple of those.\n\n37\n00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.780\nThe first thing we wanna talk about is\na SSID, or a security set identifier.\n\n38\n00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.990\nAnd this is basically a name you\ngive to your wireless network.\n\n39\n00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.190\nYou could really think of it as\nlike a work group name, right?\n\n40\n00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.790\nThis is what shows up when\nyou go to your computer and\n\n41\n00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.800\nyou click on that little icon for your\nnetworks and it gives you a list of all of\n\n42\n00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.220\nthose wireless networks that it's in range\nof, that it can see or it can detect.\n\n43\n00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.260\nWell, that name that it's showing there,\n\n44\n00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.280\nthat's the service set identifier,\nthat is the SSID.\n\n45\n00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.330\nWireless access points, by default,\nsend out what's called a beacon.\n\n46\n00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.801\nThey send this beacon in a packet\nout every few milliseconds and\n\n47\n00:02:24.801 --> 00:02:29.126\nthe computers that have wireless antenna\nthat are tuned to the right frequency\n\n48\n00:02:29.126 --> 00:02:31.962\nthere can detect that and\nthey'll put it in a list.\n\n49\n00:02:31.962 --> 00:02:37.250\nAnd the list is how you get to pick\nwhich network you wanna connect to.\n\n50\n00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.550\nCouple things we wanna do with\nthese SSIDs to help us keep\n\n51\n00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.830\nour wireless network a little more secure.\n\n52\n00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.560\nFirst of all,\nwe should really change the default.\n\n53\n00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.100\nAlthough this is one of\nthe those cases where\n\n54\n00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.450\nthe security that you get from\nchanging the default, I don't know.\n\n55\n00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.730\nSometimes if I'm in an apartment\ncomplex and there's five Linksys,\n\n56\n00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.680\nwell hey I'm kinda, security through\nobscurity type thing, right?\n\n57\n00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.350\nWhich one is it?\n\n58\n00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.980\nBut they're always going to recommend\nchanging the defaults, and we should.\n\n59\n00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.900\nWe should give it a new name.\n\n60\n00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.592\n>> I think they do that for the purposes\nof, if I know what type of wireless device\n\n61\n00:03:14.592 --> 00:03:21.250\nthat you have, if the SSID by default\nthe LinksysWTRG50 or whatever it is.\n\n62\n00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.629\nNow I know that's exactly\nwhat you're using.\n\n63\n00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.665\nI might not know it is yours,\nbut I'll know what it is,\n\n64\n00:03:25.665 --> 00:03:30.000\nand if there's an exploit, I can look\nthat up and I can try to exploit it.\n\n65\n00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.010\nSo I guess when they do things like that,\nMike, that would be where I say it's good.\n\n66\n00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.754\nBut otherwise it just says Linksys-\n>> Yeah.\n\n67\n00:03:36.754 --> 00:03:38.133\n>> Yeah, that's very-\n>> So\n\n68\n00:03:38.133 --> 00:03:40.590\nthe question then is\nwhat do we change it to?\n\n69\n00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.822\nAnd that's another area for debate.\n\n70\n00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:46.340\nThere a common thing to do is\nwhatever like your company's name.\n\n71\n00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.850\nRight, you go to Starbucks, there's\na wireless access point called Starbucks.\n\n72\n00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.180\nYou go the hotel, a Hilton and\nthere's a wireless access point, Hilton.\n\n73\n00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.490\nAnd that definitely makes it easy for\npeople to recognize it.\n\n74\n00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.490\nBut the problem is it's also very easy for\nthe bad guys to fake or\n\n75\n00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.420\nset up a rogue access point and\ncall it Starbucks.\n\n76\n00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.590\nAnd so\nyou'd see two Starbucks listed there.\n\n77\n00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.040\nWhich one do you connect to?\n\n78\n00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.827\nWell, there's a 50/50 chance that you're\nconnecting to the bad guy's access\n\n79\n00:04:11.827 --> 00:04:12.379\npoint, right?\n\n80\n00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:14.560\nSame thing in your corporate environment.\n\n81\n00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.180\nIf I've got a wireless SSID being\nbroadcast out that's saying ITProTV,\n\n82\n00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.020\nyou assume that it's my corporate network.\n\n83\n00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.700\nWhat if it's a bad guy setting one up\nthat looks just like my wireless network,\n\n84\n00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.840\ntrying to get some of these\nemployees to connect to it,\n\n85\n00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.960\nthink it's their secure network, put\nin passwords, whatever the case may be?\n\n86\n00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.630\nSo there's a downside to that.\n\n87\n00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.610\nThe other thing is kinda like\nDaniel said with the default thing.\n\n88\n00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.000\nIf you see ITProTV, you could be pretty\nsure that it is my network right,\n\n89\n00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.830\nunless somebody's setting up a rogue one.\n\n90\n00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.130\nSo I'm saying hey,\nhere's my wireless network, come see it.\n\n91\n00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.160\nBut I also want to make it easy for\nmy employees to connect to, so\n\n92\n00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:56.780\nnaming it something like 34AC544\nmight not be all that good as well.\n\n93\n00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.770\nIt would definitely make it harder to\nfigure out if that's my network or not.\n\n94\n00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.360\nBut it's also gonna make\nit very difficult for\n\n95\n00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.240\nmy employees to remember which network\nthey're supposed to connect to.\n\n96\n00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.950\nSo you want to try to come up with\nsomething descriptive, easy for\n\n97\n00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.030\nyour employees to remember, but\nmaybe doesn't give away the whole farm.\n\n98\n00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.400\nLike saying, hey, this is us,\ncome visit our wireless network.\n\n99\n00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.760\nUnless it's meant for public consumption,\nand that's like places like Starbucks or\n\n100\n00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.010\nthe airport do that,\n\n101\n00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.620\nbecause they know they're gonna have\nrandom anonymous people connecting to it.\n\n102\n00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.380\nAnd they don't wanna have to tell\neverybody that comes up to the counter,\n\n103\n00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.355\noh, by the way, the wireless network\nyou wanna connect to is 54QRTYVC7D,\n\n104\n00:05:33.355 --> 00:05:35.240\nright, or something like that.\n\n105\n00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.990\nSo pick something meaningful,\neasy to remember, but\n\n106\n00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.180\nagain, it's not a super security\nfeature so don't kill yourself.\n\n107\n00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.700\nDon't make some 64-character\ncomplex pass phrase for your SSID.\n\n108\n00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.720\nAll right, so that's one.\n\n109\n00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.710\nTwo, we can disable\nthe broadcast of the SSID.\n\n110\n00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.240\nRemember I said those access\npoints are gonna beacon and\n\n111\n00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.810\nthat's how come they show up in that list\nthat you can pick from to connect to.\n\n112\n00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.160\nWell, we can turn that feature off.\n\n113\n00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.750\nI'll show you here on this access\npoint that I'm connected to.\n\n114\n00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.360\nIf I go over to my,\n\n115\n00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.150\nlet's see if I could remember\nwhere they hide that setting here.\n\n116\n00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.950\nMy Wireless Basic Settings, Wireless\nSSID Broadcast, I can turn that off.\n\n117\n00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.200\nAnd now it won't show\nup in anybody's list.\n\n118\n00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.590\nIt'll no longer beacon.\n\n119\n00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.500\nSo that's what they're gonna recommend for\n\n120\n00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.270\nsecurity reasons,\nis turn off that beaconing.\n\n121\n00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:33.220\nIt's one of those, again, that's\na little bit, it's good and it's bad.\n\n122\n00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.212\nLet's just say we turn it off and we wanna\nlook at the positives of turning it off.\n\n123\n00:06:36.212 --> 00:06:41.294\nWell, it's no longer gonna\nshow up in anybody's list.\n\n124\n00:06:41.294 --> 00:06:42.894\nPasual casserby, pasual casserbies?\n\n125\n00:06:42.894 --> 00:06:44.700\nCasual passerbies aren't gonna see it.\n\n126\n00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.090\nThey pick out their phone,\nthey go to their wireless settings,\n\n127\n00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.480\nthey're not gonna see my\naccess point listed there.\n\n128\n00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.230\nThey might not even know there is\na wireless network in the area.\n\n129\n00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:57.770\nSo that's a good thing, right,\nthat's security through obscurity.\n\n130\n00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.780\nBut the downsides, my users are gonna\nhave to know the exact name, right?\n\n131\n00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.600\nIt's not going to show up\nin their list anymore.\n\n132\n00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.671\nSo they're gonna have to know the name of\nthe access point they wanna connect to,\n\n133\n00:07:07.671 --> 00:07:10.712\nthey're gonna have to click Manual,\nthey're gonna have to type that name in.\n\n134\n00:07:10.712 --> 00:07:15.006\nNow in a corporate environment I can\nprobably deploy most of that out using\n\n135\n00:07:15.006 --> 00:07:18.200\na centralized policy system\nwhich would be a big help.\n\n136\n00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.644\nBut in a smaller environment,\nwhere we don't have that ability,\n\n137\n00:07:20.644 --> 00:07:24.820\nnow it's another step the user's\ngonna have to go through.\n\n138\n00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.120\nThey mistype it they're not gonna be\nable to find it or connect to it.\n\n139\n00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:28.870\nThat can be an issue.\n\n140\n00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:34.380\nThe other thing that happens when we\ndisable that broadcast of the SSID is,\n\n141\n00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:39.000\nif we're gonna do that as a security\nmeasure, I've gotta tell my users,\n\n142\n00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.250\ndon't connect automatically, right?\n\n143\n00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.340\nBecause of the way the system works.\n\n144\n00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.100\nIf they choose to remember the network and\ndon't connect automatically, well now\n\n145\n00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:51.930\ntheir computer's gonna connect every time\nthey're in range of that access point.\n\n146\n00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.992\nThey used to be able to tell they were\nin range when they got the beacon\n\n147\n00:07:54.992 --> 00:07:56.129\nfrom your access point.\n\n148\n00:07:56.129 --> 00:07:57.521\nWell you turned that off.\n\n149\n00:07:57.521 --> 00:07:59.599\nSo how do they know they're in range?\n\n150\n00:07:59.599 --> 00:08:03.649\nYour computer is now gonna send out a\nlittle beacon looking to see if the access\n\n151\n00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:06.947\npoint Point is in the area, so\nthat when you get to work it says,\n\n152\n00:08:06.947 --> 00:08:10.860\nhey I think I found this network,\nand it can allow you to connect.\n\n153\n00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.050\nSo now, all of a sudden, your computer,\n\n154\n00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:16.395\nwhen you're at Starbucks,\nthat network is no where to be found.\n\n155\n00:08:16.395 --> 00:08:19.485\nBut your computer's still looking, to see\nit doesn't know that you're at Starbucks,\n\n156\n00:08:19.485 --> 00:08:24.415\nso it's now beaconing out the name of your\nSSID, to try to find that access point to\n\n157\n00:08:24.415 --> 00:08:27.675\nsee if it's in range, so\nif it should connect automatically.\n\n158\n00:08:27.675 --> 00:08:29.490\nSo what Microsoft is gonna tell you,\n\n159\n00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:31.612\nif you're gonna disable\nthe broadcast of the SSID,\n\n160\n00:08:31.612 --> 00:08:35.210\nthey're gonna need to make sure that they\ndo no choose to connect automatically.\n\n161\n00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.680\nWell if they don't connect automatically,\nguess what?\n\n162\n00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.320\nNow they've got to manually\nconnect every time and\n\n163\n00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.810\nthey've got to type in the name of it.\n\n164\n00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:43.140\nSo you see where I'm going with this?\n\n165\n00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:46.990\n>> Mike, it really sounds like the old\nmetaphor that we used to use about the IT\n\n166\n00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:48.540\nsecurity scales.\n\n167\n00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.210\nEase of usability on one side,\nand security on the other.\n\n168\n00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.160\nAs one goes down, the other goes up.\n\n169\n00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.590\nIf we increase security,\nease of usability goes out of the window.\n\n170\n00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:02.380\nBut if we tip down that ease of usability,\nsecurity tends to go out the window.\n\n171\n00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.290\nIt's hard to find that equilibrium.\n\n172\n00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:05.210\n>> It really is.\n\n173\n00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:09.900\nSo you gotta kinda weigh your options and\nfigure out, is this worth it?\n\n174\n00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.740\nBecause in the end right,\nwhat we're trying to do,\n\n175\n00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:16.800\nwhat we're trying to accomplish is keep\nmy network hidden from the bad guys.\n\n176\n00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.650\nWell here's the problem.\n\n177\n00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:20.690\nAll the bad guy has to\ndo is start sniffing.\n\n178\n00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.510\nAnd he knows there's a wireless network,\nor\n\n179\n00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.540\nshe knows there's a wireless\nnetwork in the area.\n\n180\n00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.543\nRight?\nBecause maybe they've seen people, or\n\n181\n00:09:26.543 --> 00:09:28.840\nthey've been through the building\nbefore or what have you.\n\n182\n00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.400\nThey probably have a good idea\nthere's a wireless network there, so\n\n183\n00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.410\nall they have to do is start\ncapturing wireless traffic.\n\n184\n00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:37.525\nCuz you have actual employees and\nlegitimate users connected to your access\n\n185\n00:09:37.525 --> 00:09:41.128\npoint, even though you're not broadcasting\nthe SIV, they've already connected and\n\n186\n00:09:41.128 --> 00:09:44.400\neverything's good and their sending\nwireless data back and forth.\n\n187\n00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.840\nWell the bad guy is gonna\nsimply capture that traffic.\n\n188\n00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:48.910\nAnd guess what?\n\n189\n00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:51.780\nEven if the packet is encrypted, and\n\n190\n00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:56.370\nthe header of the packet is the SSID\nof your wireless access point.\n\n191\n00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:00.340\nSo with a simple program, doing some\nnetwork sniffing of that wireless traffic,\n\n192\n00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:05.510\nthey can determine what your SSID is, and\nthat's what you were trying to prevent.\n\n193\n00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:06.690\nSo all the extra work,\n\n194\n00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:10.370\ndisabling the SSID, making sure that\nthey're not connecting automatically.\n\n195\n00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:13.210\nMake sure there typing it\nin properly every time,\n\n196\n00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:17.770\nto hide the SSID, they can figure it out\nin a matter of minutes with a simple tool.\n\n197\n00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:20.520\nSo is it worth it, or is it not?\n\n198\n00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:26.080\nI'll be honest with you,\nmost places say no it's not worth it.\n\n199\n00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.430\nBut again, that's something that you as\nan organization are gonna have to decide.\n\n200\n00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.450\nSo you can enable or\ndisable that broadcast via SSID.\n\n201\n00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.430\nAnother step that we can do to\nsecure our wireless network\n\n202\n00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:40.370\nis called MAC Filtering, right.\n\n203\n00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:42.870\nMAC Filtering we know that\nevery network adapter,\n\n204\n00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:46.200\nhas a unique global unique\nnumber assigned to it.\n\n205\n00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.720\nThat's that media access control\naddress or that MAC address.\n\n206\n00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.380\nRight.\n\n207\n00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.700\nWell, what I can do with MAC Filtering,\n\n208\n00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:57.150\nis I can either create a whitelist or\na blacklist.\n\n209\n00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:00.650\nAnd we are gonna use the MAC\naddress to determine whether or\n\n210\n00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:06.010\nnot that wireless client is allowed to\nconnect to that wireless access point.\n\n211\n00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:08.900\nWe just have to start listing\nin those MAC addresses.\n\n212\n00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.910\nAnd should be more secure, right?\n\n213\n00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:15.500\nIf I set up an enable list,\nand I start adding clients,\n\n214\n00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.850\nprevent clients listed from\naccessing the wireless network, or\n\n215\n00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:21.790\npermit only clients listed to\naccess the wireless network.\n\n216\n00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:24.130\nThat's to my black or my whitelist there.\n\n217\n00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.480\nI could say permit only client's listed.\n\n218\n00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.430\nAnd now I'm gonna have to list every\nMAC address that I want to allow\n\n219\n00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:32.196\nto connect to my wireless network.\n\n220\n00:11:32.196 --> 00:11:37.530\nIn a SOHO or a home network or something\nlike that, that might be very feasible.\n\n221\n00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.940\nI've got five, ten, 15 different clients.\n\n222\n00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.560\nI can go get all their MAC addresses, and\n\n223\n00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.100\nI can list them here, and\nnow they'll be allowed to connect.\n\n224\n00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:49.190\nAnybody else finds my access point,\ntries to connect,\n\n225\n00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:52.440\nthey're MAC address isn't on the list,\nit's not gonna allow them to connect.\n\n226\n00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:56.740\nAnd it's pretty effective in that respect,\nthey won't be able to connect to it.\n\n227\n00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:59.290\nThe downside.\n\n228\n00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:02.730\nSo that's the upside is we can\nallow just certain machines or\n\n229\n00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:05.900\ncertain network adapters in particular,\nto connect to this wireless access point,\n\n230\n00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.190\neverybody else gets blocked.\n\n231\n00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:08.230\nThat's good right?\n\n232\n00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:10.490\nThat's keeping my network secure.\n\n233\n00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:12.152\nBut of course there's a downside.\n\n234\n00:12:12.152 --> 00:12:15.554\nAnd the downside is,\nthat it's a pain in the butt.\n\n235\n00:12:15.554 --> 00:12:19.316\n[LAUGH] You know let's say you're in\na corporate environment and if you've got\n\n236\n00:12:19.316 --> 00:12:22.914\nhundreds of clients, I've gotta list\nall those MAC addresses out there.\n\n237\n00:12:22.914 --> 00:12:27.120\nI replace a network adapter in a laptop or\na computer.\n\n238\n00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.720\nGuess what it probably has\na different MAC address.\n\n239\n00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.440\nI'm gonna have to go adjust that.\n\n240\n00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.840\nRunning more than one access point,\n\n241\n00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.360\nyou're gonna have to make\nthis list on both of them.\n\n242\n00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.010\nMost of them don't have, until you\nget into high end enterprise level,\n\n243\n00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:42.120\nyou're probably not gonna have\na centralized list of MAC addresses.\n\n244\n00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.640\nSo updating, making changes.\n\n245\n00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.470\nHey that person has left the organization.\n\n246\n00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:49.550\nThey took their laptop with them,\nit was a BYOD situation.\n\n247\n00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:52.620\nI need to remove them from the list,\nso they can no longer connect.\n\n248\n00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:56.230\nGotta remember to do that,\ngotta do that on all of my access points.\n\n249\n00:12:56.230 --> 00:13:01.610\nSo logistically and administratively,\nit becomes a little bit of a challenge.\n\n250\n00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:05.400\nI can do a prevent clients from accessing\nthe wireless network, which would be\n\n251\n00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:10.020\na blacklist, but how do I know the bad\nguys MAC address before he connects?\n\n252\n00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:14.710\nIf I had logs of people that have\nconnected and they shouldn't have,\n\n253\n00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:17.360\nI can surely add those\nMAC addresses to my list.\n\n254\n00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.240\nWhat about the ones I don't\nknow about yet, right?\n\n255\n00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:25.850\nSo that becomes really not all\nthat effective either, right?\n\n256\n00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:30.520\nAnd then, to make matters worse, remember\nhow I said that the bad guy could do some\n\n257\n00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:34.900\nsimple packet capture, and\nthe SSID was in the header of the packet?\n\n258\n00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:36.510\nSo it's not encrypted.\n\n259\n00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:40.100\nWell guess what else is in the header of\nthe packet right, I've got the source and\n\n260\n00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.780\ndestination address.\n\n261\n00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:45.260\nIP wise and the source and\ndestination MAC address,\n\n262\n00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.980\nare out in the header of\nthe packet unencrypted.\n\n263\n00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:53.570\nSo you can MAC filter if you want, but\nI can just simply capture some traffic,\n\n264\n00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:56.540\nget a MAC address that's already\nestablished a connection, so\n\n265\n00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.540\nI know they're on the allowed list.\n\n266\n00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:02.880\nUse a simple program to change\nmy MAC address on my system, and\n\n267\n00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.140\nnow I appear to be on\nthe whitelist as well.\n\n268\n00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:08.330\nAnd I'll be able to connect to\nthat wireless access point.\n\n269\n00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:12.990\nso it's another one of those systems that\nyes, it will add a layer of security.\n\n270\n00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:16.490\nIt adds a lot of complexity\nto the administration of it.\n\n271\n00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:20.550\nAnd it's really not all that\nstrong of a security method.\n\n272\n00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:23.390\nSo as Daniel said,\nwe're playing with those scales again.\n\n273\n00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:27.120\nAnd we're finding that yeah,\nthat I can make it more secure.\n\n274\n00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:31.940\nBut it's gonna make it a lot more work,\na lot more difficult to actually use.\n\n275\n00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:35.019\n>> It's like building a fence that\nonly goes up to about waist high.\n\n276\n00:14:35.019 --> 00:14:39.681\nI can step over it if I want to, but for\nthe common passerby they're gonna go, oh,\n\n277\n00:14:39.681 --> 00:14:41.922\nI guess I'm not going over that fence.\n\n278\n00:14:41.922 --> 00:14:45.405\nIt's obviously de-marked off for a reason,\nI'm just gonna continue on my way.\n\n279\n00:14:45.405 --> 00:14:48.743\nBut for anybody with a wherewithal and\n\n280\n00:14:48.743 --> 00:14:53.660\nthe want to do it,\nit's not too difficultly bypassed.\n\n281\n00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:54.180\n>> Exactly.\n\n282\n00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:55.400\nAnd that's the key, Woody.\n\n283\n00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.110\nJust the the casual passerby, right?\n\n284\n00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:00.920\nAnd that's really what you're securing\nagainst with these two methods,\n\n285\n00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:05.770\nis you're keeping that casual\npasserby from, seeing your network,\n\n286\n00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:07.750\nor being able to connect to your network.\n\n287\n00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:10.500\nBut if they're determined,\nthey're gonna find a way in.\n\n288\n00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.420\nIf they are a hacker,\nif they've got the tools,\n\n289\n00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:16.500\nthe expertise, those two methods\nare barley gonna slow them down.\n\n290\n00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:17.320\nSo, do we implement them?\n\n291\n00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:20.060\nTypically yes, right?\n\n292\n00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.790\nI mean maybe not the MAC\nfiltering because, to me,\n\n293\n00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:25.120\nthat's an administrative nightmare but\nthe other methods, maybe we do.\n\n294\n00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.420\nIt's something that your\nnetwork has to decide.\n\n295\n00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:28.370\nIf it's worth that effort.\n\n296\n00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:31.010\nIf you're a small shop and just have\na limited number of MAC addresses,\n\n297\n00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:34.980\nthey don't change all of that often,\nheck, use that MAC Filtering.\n\n298\n00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.710\nIt's one more layer, right?\n\n299\n00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:39.100\nThink back to other episodes we've done.\n\n300\n00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:40.530\nDefense in depth.\n\n301\n00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:44.850\nThese are extra layers that I can put out\nthere, that might slow somebody down,\n\n302\n00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:45.810\nmight prevent somebody.\n\n303\n00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:48.210\nI might have a person that's\ntrying to get in my network.\n\n304\n00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:50.090\nThey've never heard of how\nto change their MAC address.\n\n305\n00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:53.500\nSo they don't have any idea, how to get\npast that simple layer of security.\n\n306\n00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.980\nSo it might be very beneficial for\nthat casual passerby.\n\n307\n00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:58.625\nThey're going to look for the easy target.\n\n308\n00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:01.925\nI've always used the example,\nof that kitchen window, or\n\n309\n00:16:01.925 --> 00:16:06.157\nthat bathroom window that has that\nsilly little lock, that you kinda turn.\n\n310\n00:16:06.157 --> 00:16:09.457\nAnd everybody that knows, they can take\na butter knife and jam it up in there and\n\n311\n00:16:09.457 --> 00:16:10.558\nand turn that thing over.\n\n312\n00:16:10.558 --> 00:16:12.115\nRight and unlock that window.\n\n313\n00:16:12.115 --> 00:16:13.113\n>> Where do you spend your nights?\n\n314\n00:16:13.113 --> 00:16:15.840\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'm old,\n\n315\n00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.408\nI remember these old metal locks.\n\n316\n00:16:17.408 --> 00:16:20.870\n[LAUGH]\n>> Got experience with that, do you?\n\n317\n00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:23.450\n>> I don't like sleeping outside.\n\n318\n00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:25.890\nSo those things are weak.\n\n319\n00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:27.280\nWe all know we can take a knife or\n\n320\n00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.710\na credit card and\npop those things open really easy.\n\n321\n00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:31.230\nDo I leave it unlocked?\n\n322\n00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:33.100\nAbsolutely not, all right?\n\n323\n00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.670\nSo it just comes down to how much\neffort you need to spend and\n\n324\n00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:39.710\nwhether these are worth it to\nyour particular organization.\n\n325\n00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:42.780\n>> My mom use to say,\nlocks just keepin an honest man honest.\n\n326\n00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:46.030\n>> That's right.\n>> That's, don't make it appealing for\n\n327\n00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:49.890\nsomeone to go hey, well,\nI can just waltz into this thing, why not?\n\n328\n00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:51.240\nWhy shouldn't I do that?\n\n329\n00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:55.420\nJust hang that fruit a little bit higher\nand every inch that you hang it higher\n\n330\n00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:59.400\nmakes it a less likely target, and\nthat's really what security boils down to.\n\n331\n00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:03.160\nMaking it as least likely\nof a target as you can be,\n\n332\n00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.530\njust trying to be that gray\nman lost in the crowd.\n\n333\n00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:09.240\nGo for those lower hanging fruit,\nthat's much sweeter.\n\n334\n00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:13.680\n>> Absolutely, if you're in a strip\nmall and you're blocking SSID and\n\n335\n00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:17.570\nyou're doing Mac filtering, and the office\nnext to you, the business next to you\n\n336\n00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:21.090\nisn't, that's probably the one\nthey're gonna go hit, right?\n\n337\n00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:23.270\nSo, definitely a good point.\n\n338\n00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:26.040\nAll right, so other things we\ncan do that are a little more\n\n339\n00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.438\nmeaningful when it comes to securing your\nwireless network is, just turn it off.\n\n340\n00:17:29.438 --> 00:17:31.540\n[LAUGH] No, I'm kidding.\n\n341\n00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:35.600\nNo, we can choose the level of encryption\nand security that we want to do.\n\n342\n00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:39.320\nAnd this is absolutely a must do.\n\n343\n00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.870\nThose first two, I'll let you guys\ndecide whether or not you wanna do them.\n\n344\n00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:44.880\nThis one you have to do it.\n\n345\n00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.590\nUnless there's a reason that it's\njust a wide open access point and\n\n346\n00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:50.990\nit's out there for\nthe public and you don't care,\n\n347\n00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:53.890\nit's not connected to any of your\nnetworks, your internal networks or\n\n348\n00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:58.330\nsomething like that, which isn't all that\noften, although it is done sometimes.\n\n349\n00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:00.300\nWe put a wireless network for guests and\n\n350\n00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:04.450\nthings like that that has no tie\nback to our corporate network.\n\n351\n00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:08.710\nEven then, we typically at least put\na basic password on there, right?\n\n352\n00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:14.300\nBut you gotta, if it's your wireless serve\nfor your company these are must dos.\n\n353\n00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:18.520\nSo let's flip over here and\ntake a look at wireless security.\n\n354\n00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.477\nSo depending on your access point,\n\n355\n00:18:20.477 --> 00:18:24.793\nit'll support different levels of\nwireless security that we can implement.\n\n356\n00:18:24.793 --> 00:18:28.659\nWe've got WEP,\nwhich was the wired equivalency privacy or\n\n357\n00:18:28.659 --> 00:18:32.456\nwired equivalent privacy,\nif I remember that one right.\n\n358\n00:18:32.456 --> 00:18:36.310\nThere's WPA, WiFi protected alliance.\n\n359\n00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:40.100\nAnd then there is WPA2,\nWiFi protected alliance two.\n\n360\n00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.310\nThree different choices.\n\n361\n00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:46.950\nWPA and WPA2 can actually break\ndown into personal and enterprise.\n\n362\n00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:48.230\nLet's talk about them.\n\n363\n00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:49.900\nThe first one WEP.\n\n364\n00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:54.600\nThis is the original\n802.11 security measure,\n\n365\n00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.900\nway back when wireless\nwas first coming out.\n\n366\n00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:01.850\nThey knew that we had to have some\nway to secure this traffic, so\n\n367\n00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:05.340\nthey implemented a system called\nWired Equivalent Privacy.\n\n368\n00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:06.130\nAnd that was the goal,\n\n369\n00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:09.890\nwas to make it about the same as\nit would be on a wired network.\n\n370\n00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:12.760\nThey weren't trying to make\nit extremely bulletproof,\n\n371\n00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.110\njust a level of security\nthat we could deal with.\n\n372\n00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:17.830\nBecause now we're talking\nabout unbound media.\n\n373\n00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:20.760\nMeaning my packets are floating\nout there in space and\n\n374\n00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.810\nanybody with a sniffer could capture them.\n\n375\n00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:25.610\nWell, on a wired network at\nleast I've got a cable, right?\n\n376\n00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:29.240\nAnd somehow you've gotta get into\nthat cable and cut it, splice it, or\n\n377\n00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.450\nget somehow connected to\nthe network to get that.\n\n378\n00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:33.820\nWireless, it's just out there, right?\n\n379\n00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:38.150\nSo WEP gave us a level of encryption so\nthat that traffic that was floating out\n\n380\n00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:43.260\nthere, that was being radiated\nout is protected some way, right?\n\n381\n00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.820\nIt was encrypted.\n\n382\n00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:47.400\nNow the problem with it, and it was good.\n\n383\n00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.750\nI mean, in its day when it first came out,\n\n384\n00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:53.430\nthere wasn't too much wrong with WEP,\nright?\n\n385\n00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:57.290\nBut eventually, they found that it\nhad some vulnerabilities in it,\n\n386\n00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:58.560\nlike anything, right?\n\n387\n00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.130\nIt starts out really good,\nenough pounding on it,\n\n388\n00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:05.800\nenough hacking on it, we're gonna find\na flaw in there and the bad guys did.\n\n389\n00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:10.080\nThey found a couple flaws that they\nwere able to take advantage of, and\n\n390\n00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:13.470\nwe don't have to go into the details\nof the initialization vectors,\n\n391\n00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:17.460\nhow often to reuse them or\nevery 5000 packets, things like that.\n\n392\n00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.420\nFor this exam,\nI'm not all that worried about it.\n\n393\n00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:23.100\nWe've other episodes in our library\nif you wanna dive in deeper.\n\n394\n00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:26.130\nFor now, we just have to\nunderstand that the WEP had flaws.\n\n395\n00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:28.050\nThere were some serious\nflaws in it that came out.\n\n396\n00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:30.510\nThey were discovered,\nthey were publicized.\n\n397\n00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:34.890\nTools were made available and\nrelatively easy to crack at this point.\n\n398\n00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:37.040\nIn fact it's now depreciated.\n\n399\n00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:41.700\nThey tell you you shouldn't use\nit unless it's your only method.\n\n400\n00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:42.660\nIf that access point is so\n\n401\n00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:46.880\nold that that's all you get, you should go\nbuy another access point, gosh darn it.\n\n402\n00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.100\nBut use it.\n\n403\n00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.360\nIf that's all you got,\ndefinitely turn it on, right?\n\n404\n00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:53.980\nJust understand that it's kind of\ngoing the way of the MAC filtering and\n\n405\n00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:55.402\nthe SSID broadcast.\n\n406\n00:20:55.402 --> 00:20:58.550\nIt's gonna keep the honest people\nhonest and that's about it.\n\n407\n00:20:58.550 --> 00:20:59.970\nAnybody can go download a tool,\n\n408\n00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:04.240\nthey can crack WEP in a matter of minutes,\nall right?\n\n409\n00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.860\nThat was our first option\nwhen it comes to security.\n\n410\n00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:12.450\nLong story short, the vendors,\nthe manufacturers that were making this\n\n411\n00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:15.360\nwireless stuff weren't selling enough,\nyou know, they knew there was a flaw.\n\n412\n00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.255\nWe needed to do something about it.\n\n413\n00:21:17.255 --> 00:21:20.250\nIEEE, Is who makes these standards.\n\n414\n00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:23.260\nThey take a little while\nto ratify new standards, so\n\n415\n00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.730\nthis Wi-Fi Protected Alliance popped up,\nand\n\n416\n00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:28.590\nthey said here's what we're\ngonna do to change this up.\n\n417\n00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:31.550\nWe're gonna come out with this\nnew protocol that has some better\n\n418\n00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:32.310\nsecurity methods.\n\n419\n00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:35.640\nWe're gonna use something called TKIP,\nTemporal Key Integrity Protocol.\n\n420\n00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.040\nYou don't have to memorize\nthat I don't think.\n\n421\n00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:40.570\nAnd we're gonna increase some of the,\nwe're gonna fix some of those\n\n422\n00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:44.210\nflaws that we found by using methods\nthat don't have those same weaknesses.\n\n423\n00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:46.860\nA little bit stronger encryption,\n\n424\n00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:50.960\nwhich is now possible because my\nrouters had bigger processors in them.\n\n425\n00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:54.550\nClients had bigger, better processors,\nbetter network adaptors.\n\n426\n00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:57.190\nSo we could increase that\nencryption level, and\n\n427\n00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:02.870\nchange those keys more often with a little\nless repetition and predictability.\n\n428\n00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:05.210\nAnd it worked, WPA was really good.\n\n429\n00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:09.800\nIt actually, before we go there,\nwe'll keep going.\n\n430\n00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.760\nAt WPA there was kind\nof a stop gap measure.\n\n431\n00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.879\nWhat happened eventually,\n\n432\n00:22:14.879 --> 00:22:20.096\nthe IEEE came out with the 802.11i,\nwhich was their standard.\n\n433\n00:22:20.096 --> 00:22:22.908\nAnd everybody just\nstarted calling it WPA2.\n\n434\n00:22:22.908 --> 00:22:27.628\nWPA2 is the full implementation\nof the IEEE's new\n\n435\n00:22:27.628 --> 00:22:32.920\nsecurity standard for\nwireless, that 802.11i.\n\n436\n00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.670\nFor us, for everybody out there though,\n\n437\n00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:39.670\nit was much easier just to call it the new\nand improved WPA, so they called it WPA2.\n\n438\n00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:45.210\nWhen you look at WPA and WPA2, you'll see\nthat I have a couple of options here.\n\n439\n00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:48.630\nI have WPA personal, and\nif I select that and\n\n440\n00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:52.090\ngive it a second,\nI can see that I get a shared key.\n\n441\n00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:54.180\nThis is just a passphrase, right?\n\n442\n00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:58.260\nSame thing we did in WEP,\nwas just use a passphrase to protect it.\n\n443\n00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:01.290\nAnd anybody that wants to connect is\ngonna have to know that passphrase.\n\n444\n00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:04.550\nSo we wanna make sure this is good,\nlong, and strong, and we really want\n\n445\n00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:08.390\nto change it every so often,\njust like any other password, all right?\n\n446\n00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:12.080\nBut in a corporate environment, that's\nnot gonna be enough to keep my data safe.\n\n447\n00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.840\nPasswords are inherently weak.\n\n448\n00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.260\nWe don't change them often enough.\n\n449\n00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:16.532\nThey're crackable.\n\n450\n00:23:16.532 --> 00:23:19.202\nSo we have WPA Enterprise.\n\n451\n00:23:19.202 --> 00:23:23.014\nAnd with WPA Enterprise,\nyou can see all these new options,\n\n452\n00:23:23.014 --> 00:23:26.700\nthis Radius Authentication Server Address.\n\n453\n00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:30.010\nWe're gonna take the authentication\ncompletely off of the access point, and\n\n454\n00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:32.680\nwe're gonna move it back\nto a separate server.\n\n455\n00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.390\nSo that's known as a radius server.\n\n456\n00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:38.930\nRemote authentication\ndial-in user service.\n\n457\n00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:40.260\nWhy dial-in's in the title?\n\n458\n00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:43.300\nI don't know, it's there.\n\n459\n00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:47.170\nIt's been around for a little while,\ndial-in used to be a very common method.\n\n460\n00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:49.780\nSo we're gonna take the authentication\noff the access point.\n\n461\n00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:51.768\nAnd we're gonna put it somewhere else,\n\n462\n00:23:51.768 --> 00:23:55.930\nbecause we know this access point isn't\nreally the best authentication solution.\n\n463\n00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:59.635\nSo now what happens, when you try to\nauthenticate to that access point,\n\n464\n00:23:59.635 --> 00:24:00.376\nit says wait.\n\n465\n00:24:00.376 --> 00:24:03.231\nAnd it doesn't allow you to\nactually establish a connection.\n\n466\n00:24:03.231 --> 00:24:06.656\nExcept for a couple of protocols,\nthat authentication protocol.\n\n467\n00:24:06.656 --> 00:24:10.949\nAnd it's gonna then forward that\nauthentication over to the RADIUS server,\n\n468\n00:24:10.949 --> 00:24:15.505\nwhich is most likely behind my DMZ, inside\nmy secured network where nobody can get\n\n469\n00:24:15.505 --> 00:24:18.695\nto and try to hack on and\nbreak the authentication there.\n\n470\n00:24:18.695 --> 00:24:22.202\nAnd then it tells the wireless access\npoint, yes, allow that connection, or no,\n\n471\n00:24:22.202 --> 00:24:24.620\ndon't allow that connection, right?\n\n472\n00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:28.410\nSo we completely remove the authentication\nprocess from that wireless access point.\n\n473\n00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:33.200\nIt's now just the middleman passing that\nauthentication through and waiting for\n\n474\n00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.120\nthe acknowledgement of\nthe NAC to come back.\n\n475\n00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:41.660\nMuch more secure solution, but at home,\nI don't have a RADIUS server, all right?\n\n476\n00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:44.510\nIn a soho, I probably don't\nhave a RADIUS server set up,\n\n477\n00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:47.000\nI don't have an extra server to use for\nthat.\n\n478\n00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.830\nSo, that's why they give\nus the two choices.\n\n479\n00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:51.410\nPersonal, if you don't have\nthat infrastructure, but\n\n480\n00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:54.700\nyou still wanna take advantage\nof good wireless security.\n\n481\n00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.270\nEnterprise, if you wanna\nmove up to that next level.\n\n482\n00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:59.027\nAnd then the same options with WPA2.\n\n483\n00:24:59.027 --> 00:25:01.140\nI have WPA2 personal.\n\n484\n00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:05.020\nI was just gonna change back to\nthe pre shared key or the pass phrase.\n\n485\n00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:10.776\nAnd I've got WPA enterprise,\nwhich is gonna go back to using RADIUS.\n\n486\n00:25:10.776 --> 00:25:12.921\nNow this particular access\npoint has a couple of others,\n\n487\n00:25:12.921 --> 00:25:14.227\ndon't think I'm skipping them.\n\n488\n00:25:14.227 --> 00:25:17.200\nThey've got personal mixed and\nenterprise mixed.\n\n489\n00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.580\nThat's a custom software that's been\nloaded up on this access point,\n\n490\n00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:23.530\nnot anything we need to worry about for\nthis particular exam, so.\n\n491\n00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:27.260\nFocus on the big three,\nWEP, which has been,\n\n492\n00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:30.480\nwhat's the term I'm looking for-\n>> Depreciated?\n\n493\n00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:31.290\n>> Depreciated, thank you.\n\n494\n00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:32.710\nIt wouldn't come to my mind.\n\n495\n00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:33.580\nHas been depreciated.\n\n496\n00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:36.738\nIt's there, we can still use it,\nit's better than nothing,\n\n497\n00:25:36.738 --> 00:25:40.265\nbut it's only keeping the honest\npeople honest and that's about it.\n\n498\n00:25:40.265 --> 00:25:45.180\nWPA and WPA2, much more secure options.\n\n499\n00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:50.300\nWPA actually went out as a update for\na lot of these access points.\n\n500\n00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:55.330\nWPA2 used a little bit stronger\nauthentication encryption, or\n\n501\n00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:56.520\nI should say encryption method.\n\n502\n00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.992\nIt needed a better processor,\na little more processing power, so\n\n503\n00:25:59.992 --> 00:26:03.221\nit typically meant an actual\nphysical upgrade to the device.\n\n504\n00:26:03.221 --> 00:26:08.330\nWPA and WPA2 have a personal mode\nwhere we use a preshared key.\n\n505\n00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:14.103\nThey have a RADIUS mode, or an enterprise\nmode, where we're gonna be using RADIUS,\n\n506\n00:26:14.103 --> 00:26:18.191\nwe're moving the authentication\noff of the access point and\n\n507\n00:26:18.191 --> 00:26:20.939\nback into my secure corporate network.\n\n508\n00:26:20.939 --> 00:26:24.511\n>> And Mike, I just realized\nyou were saying WPA stands for\n\n509\n00:26:24.511 --> 00:26:26.266\nWifi Protected Alliance.\n\n510\n00:26:26.266 --> 00:26:30.479\nIt's the Wifi Alliance,\nthey created the Wifi Protected Access.\n\n511\n00:26:30.479 --> 00:26:31.638\n>> Oh!\n[LAUGH]\n\n512\n00:26:31.638 --> 00:26:33.366\n>> That was a, I, easy slip-up,\n\n513\n00:26:33.366 --> 00:26:36.520\nwe just wanna make sure we get\neverything straight there.\n\n514\n00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:37.420\n>> Very good,\nsay that one more time for me.\n\n515\n00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:41.970\n>> Wifi Protected Access was\ncreated by the Wifi Alliance.\n\n516\n00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:43.522\n>> There we go.\n>> That's not confusing.\n\n517\n00:26:43.522 --> 00:26:46.424\n>> [LAUGH] So\nmake sure you get those straight.\n\n518\n00:26:46.424 --> 00:26:50.910\nAll right, so several different ways\nwe can go about securing our wireless\n\n519\n00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:54.262\nnetworks, and the important thing is\nthat you're familiar with these options.\n\n520\n00:26:54.262 --> 00:26:56.690\nRight, you'd have to know they're\navailable so that you can go and\n\n521\n00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:59.270\ndecide whether or not you wanna use them.\n\n522\n00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:03.110\nLike MAC filtering or\ndisabling that broadcast to the SSID.\n\n523\n00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:05.960\nOr understanding what those\noptions are in that drop down list\n\n524\n00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.930\nwhen you pick your authentication\nencryption method.\n\n525\n00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:09.060\nAre you gonna use WEP?\n\n526\n00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:14.570\nWhat's the difference between WPA and\nWPA2 and enterprise and personal?\n\n527\n00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:17.810\nSo those are your choices.\n\n528\n00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:22.300\nIt's something that we've gotta do to\nkeep these wireless networks secure.\n\n529\n00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:23.540\n>> Yeah, I mean, lets just face it,\n\n530\n00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:26.620\nwireless is here to stay,\nit's not going anywhere anytime soon.\n\n531\n00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:31.400\nSo being able to discern what is\nthe best security practice for\n\n532\n00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:34.180\nour wireless networks is something\nwe need to be able to do.\n\n533\n00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:36.679\nAnd that's not just for\npeople that are in IT, that's for\n\n534\n00:27:36.679 --> 00:27:39.450\nanyone that wants to implement\na wireless network at all.\n\n535\n00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:43.610\nMike, you've done a great job of helping\nus wade through the options that we have.\n\n536\n00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:46.997\nNow we know what we can do with our SSID,\nshould we broadcast now,\n\n537\n00:27:46.997 --> 00:27:48.855\nwe've got MAC filtering enabled.\n\n538\n00:27:48.855 --> 00:27:53.470\nAnd then obviously the different types of\nencryption options that are available.\n\n539\n00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:55.111\nI get users all the time.\n\n540\n00:27:55.111 --> 00:27:56.187\nWhat's the difference between this?\n\n541\n00:27:56.187 --> 00:27:58.200\nWhy should I use this over that?\n\n542\n00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.520\nAnd that's exactly what\nyou should've stated.\n\n543\n00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:04.120\nSo now we know, go with the most and\nsecure encryption type possible.\n\n544\n00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:08.270\nThey're just as easy to set up and\nuse as any of the previous versions,\n\n545\n00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:11.590\nso don't be afraid just cuz it's new,\nlike it's gonna be difficult.\n\n546\n00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:12.330\nIt's not that hard.\n\n547\n00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:15.950\n[LAUGH] Add your little key,\nand you're off to the races.\n\n548\n00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:17.510\n>> We have confidence, you can do it.\n\n549\n00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:18.160\n>> That's right.\n\n550\n00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.210\nYou can do that.\n\n551\n00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:22.440\nAnd if you need a little help,\nyou know what, watch this show over again.\n\n552\n00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:26.700\nGet those terms built into your head so\nyou know exactly what each one of them do.\n\n553\n00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:29.320\nMike, is there anything else that\nwe need to cover on wireless\n\n554\n00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:30.880\nsecurity as far as this show goes?\n\n555\n00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:31.740\n>> I don't think so.\n\n556\n00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:35.390\nJust make sure you at least go in and\nconfigure those basic options.\n\n557\n00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:36.570\nAnd keep yourself secure.\n\n558\n00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:37.910\n>> That's right.\nAll right, everyone,\n\n559\n00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:39.608\nwe're gonna go ahead and\nwrap up this episode.\n\n560\n00:28:39.608 --> 00:28:40.860\nThanks for watching.\n\n561\n00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:44.060\nSigning off for ITpro.tv,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n562\n00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:44.770\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n563\n00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:46.687\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n564\n00:28:46.687 --> 00:28:52.970\n[SOUND]\n\n",

exciting episode of\nitpro.tv I'm your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n4\n00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:21.240\nJoining me today in the studio,\nwell it's none other than Mike Roderick.\n\n5\n00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.100\nHow's it going, Mike?\n\n6\n00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.340\n>> It's going great Daniel.\n\n7\n00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.940\nI'm excited as always to be here.\n\n8\n00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.710\nWe've got your MTA content\ncoming your way and\n\n9\n00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.980\nin this one we're going to be\nlooking at user authentication.\n\n10\n00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.180\nHow do we verify the identity.\n\n11\n00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.680\nOf who's setting at that computer.\n\n12\n00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.290\nSo, we're gonna talk about some of\nthe different methods that we have to\n\n13\n00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.730\nperform that user authentication.\n\n14\n00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.720\nI guess before we go there Danny, we\nshould probable talk about the importance\n\n15\n00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.930\nof authentication and\nwhy we even bother, right?\n\n16\n00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.880\nI know a lot of you have\na computer sitting at home that\n\n17\n00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.950\nhas one account on it.\n\n18\n00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.860\nYou set that computer up,\nyou took it out of the box,\n\n19\n00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.960\nyou put it in your office and it's logged\nin as an administrator account and\n\n20\n00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.640\neverybody in the family just comes and\nuses that computer.\n\n21\n00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.830\nWell the problem with that and\n\n22\n00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.490\nthe reason we don't do that in a corporate\nenvironment is I have not way to control\n\n23\n00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.490\nwho has access to what as well as\nno way to track who is doing what.\n\n24\n00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.990\nThere is no auditing capabilities\n\n25\n00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.860\nwith that kind of system because I don't\nknow who it is right where as, if you\n\n26\n00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.700\nare logging in if your using your user\naccount that has been assigned to you.\n\n27\n00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.070\nI can control your access.\n\n28\n00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.470\nDaniel has an account, I have an account.\n\n29\n00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.240\nI can give Daniel's account read and\nwrite permissions over this folder.\n\n30\n00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.740\nI can give my account\njust read permission.\n\n31\n00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.110\nSo I can control what\nlevel of access you have.\n\n32\n00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.430\nI can also see that Daniel is\nthe one that modified that file.\n\n33\n00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.300\nAt 8:30 this morning, whereas if\nwe're all using the same account,\n\n34\n00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.990\nthere's no way to tell who\ndid what on that system.\n\n35\n00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.060\nSo authentication, a very important\npart of setting up a network,\n\n36\n00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.460\nusing good strong authentication method.\n\n37\n00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.100\nSo then the question is, well,\nHow do we authenticate somebody?\n\n38\n00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.630\nHow do we verify the identity of\nwho's sitting behind that keyboard?\n\n39\n00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.880\nWell, we've got three different\nthings we can base authentication on.\n\n40\n00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.270\nSomething you know, something you have,\nor something you are.\n\n41\n00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.090\nSomething you know is one\nof the most common methods\n\n42\n00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.810\nof authentication that we use.\n\n43\n00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.120\nIn today's networks.\n\n44\n00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.390\nThese are things like passwords, or pins.\n\n45\n00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.950\nWe give you a password or\nyou create your own password.\n\n46\n00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.110\nWhen you sit down at that keyboard you\ntype in your password, that password is\n\n47\n00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.100\nverified, now it knows who you are and\nyou're allowed to use that computer.\n\n48\n00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.030\nIf you have those permissions, right?\n\n49\n00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.720\nSo it's a very easy system to setup, it's\nbuilt into our operating systems, doesn't\n\n50\n00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.170\nrequire any additional infrastructure or\nequipment, very easy to manage and\n\n51\n00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.690\nmaintain, which is why we see\nit being used in so many places.\n\n52\n00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.160\nThe problem is it's not\na very secure method.\n\n53\n00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.663\nIt's, what's a good way\nto say that Danial?\n\n54\n00:02:48.663 --> 00:02:52.652\nIt's not that it's insecure but\nit's not the most secure solution we\n\n55\n00:02:52.652 --> 00:02:57.000\ncan use because there are some\ninherent weaknesses in that system.\n\n56\n00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.250\nTypically, we let the user come\nup wit their own password so\n\n57\n00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.640\nwe have to try to train them\nto create strong passwords.\n\n58\n00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.300\nAnd they don't always do that.\n\n59\n00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.660\nSo they're using passwords that can\nbe guessed easily or broken easily.\n\n60\n00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.100\nIf I can guess your password or\n\n61\n00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.810\nworst if you share your password with me,\nthere is a problem with that.\n\n62\n00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.130\nThe way this system is set up,\nit has no way of knowing that is not you.\n\n63\n00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.850\nIf Daniel lets me have his password, and\nI log on as Daniel with his password.\n\n64\n00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.130\nHow does that system know it's not Daniel?\n\n65\n00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.080\nIt doesn't, right?\n\n66\n00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.450\nThere's no way for it to know.\n\n67\n00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.810\nSo, we have problems with passwords.\n\n68\n00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.660\nWeak passwords and sharing passwords.\n\n69\n00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.440\nAnd Daniel,\nI know we try to teach our users, but\n\n70\n00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.640\nthey don't always follow\nour best practices.\n\n71\n00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.950\n>> No, they're like that petulant\nchild that doesn't wanna listen to\n\n72\n00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:46.840\ntheir parents.\n\n73\n00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.140\nWe know what's best for you as a user.\n\n74\n00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.240\nAnd I know it can be difficult but\nit is the best practice while we\n\n75\n00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.190\ntry to implement that just\nto keep you safe, right?\n\n76\n00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.500\nIf Mike is sharing his password to\neverybody and their brother and\n\n77\n00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.400\nMike's an admin, if something goes\nwrong we're gonna blame Mike.\n\n78\n00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.940\nMike's gonna get in trouble,\nbecause he's Is A,\n\n79\n00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.920\nsharing out very sensitive information,\nand allowing people to log in and\n\n80\n00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.860\nmake changes to that information,\nbecause he's not following the procedure\n\n81\n00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.860\nthat we need to put in place,\nwhich is don't share your passwords.\n\n82\n00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.410\nThat's the only I have to really show that\nit was Mike that logged in and did this,\n\n83\n00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.260\nand not Nate or Ronny or somebody else Joe\non the street that Mike's passing out,\n\n84\n00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.155\nyeah I'll give you my password for\na candy bar.\n\n85\n00:04:28.155 --> 00:04:29.716\n[LAUGH]\n>> It came for a dollar [CROSSTALK].\n\n86\n00:04:29.716 --> 00:04:30.965\n>> He's been known to do.\n\n87\n00:04:30.965 --> 00:04:33.400\nAlright ladies and\ngentlemen it's a sad thing.\n\n88\n00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.290\n>> He is exactly right though, if I log\non as Daniel with Daniel's password\n\n89\n00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.840\neverything I do is gonna be recorded\nas Daniel performing that action,\n\n90\n00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.590\nright when you look at the audit logs.\n\n91\n00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.050\nI have now all the permission at Daniel.\n\n92\n00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.760\nShould have.\n\n93\n00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.550\nBecause I'm logging on with his account.\n\n94\n00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.610\nSo still very commonly used.\n\n95\n00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.490\nPasswords are easy like I said to set up.\n\n96\n00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.000\nNo extra infrastructure.\n\n97\n00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.260\nBut we're slowly seeing them go away.\n\n98\n00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.970\nA stronger method, one of the other\nfactors we can use is something you have\n\n99\n00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.780\nright these are things like\ncertificates or smart cards or tokens.\n\n100\n00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.530\nNow you have to physically\nhave this device or\n\n101\n00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:16.190\nthis whatever it is a card or certificate\nand you have to have that to authenticate.\n\n102\n00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.060\nIt's becoming more common that\nthe equipment to set this up is a little\n\n103\n00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.920\nless expensive now,\nbecause it's being more mass produced and\n\n104\n00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.660\nwe're seeing things like spark card\nreaders pop up on desktops, or\n\n105\n00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.440\nin doorways where I can take my card and\nswipe it And that smart\n\n106\n00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.130\ncard has a chip on it that stores my\nidentification information in there.\n\n107\n00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.400\nAnd so now all I have to do is have this\ncard, and I swipe it and I can get in.\n\n108\n00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.100\nOr that RFID, I know Daniel,\nwe use RFIDs here, right?\n\n109\n00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.070\n>> Yep, this is exactly what we use to\nget inside of our building right here.\n\n110\n00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.140\nI just Swipe that near the panel by\nthe door and it'll unlock the door it\n\n111\n00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:55.020\nchecks to see am I who I am and that let's\nit know that if I'm carrying this it's\n\n112\n00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.260\nsomething I have on me it's the system\nknow who I am checks my authorization.\n\n113\n00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.120\nSays oh, you're allowed to come to\nthe store and unlock the door for me.\n\n114\n00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.460\nThese are very,\nvery nice handy items to have.\n\n115\n00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.940\n>> They really are and as I said, they're\nbecoming more and more popular because, or\n\n116\n00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.690\nyou're seeing it more and more, because\nthe technology's getting less expensive.\n\n117\n00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.010\nIt's been around for a little while,\nit's starting to be mass produced.\n\n118\n00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:19.510\nSo it's in reach of even some\nof our smaller organizations.\n\n119\n00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.440\nThere is a weakness with that though.\n\n120\n00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.500\nAs something you have,\nwhat if I steal Daniel's keys?\n\n121\n00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.970\nWhat if he leaves them laying on his table\nand I grab his RFID, his token there.\n\n122\n00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.370\nNow I can go to a doorway that maybe\nI shouldn't have access to But\n\n123\n00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.050\nit doesn't know it's not Daniel, right.\n\n124\n00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.250\nI hit that thing up against that reader,\nand it's gonna open up that door.\n\n125\n00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.410\nBecause that key FOB that\nwas assigned to Daniel\n\n126\n00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.800\nhas been given that level of access.\n\n127\n00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.160\nSo again, we see an issue there.\n\n128\n00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:45.820\nRight?\n\n129\n00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.260\nAnother method we could use for\nauthentication is something you are.\n\n130\n00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.180\nThis is where we start\ngetting into biometrics.\n\n131\n00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.420\nFingerprint scans, facial recognition,\n\n132\n00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.860\nvoice recognition,\niris scans, things like that.\n\n133\n00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.470\nThese are gonna be much more difficult for\nthe bad guy to impersonate.\n\n134\n00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.890\nI can't steal Daniel's finger.\n\n135\n00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:07.690\nWell, I guess I could.\n\n136\n00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:08.705\n>> Good luck with that, Mike.\n\n137\n00:07:08.705 --> 00:07:10.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Good luck with that.\n\n138\n00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.010\n>> You see the difference here, right?\n\n139\n00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.460\nI'm gonna have a hard time getting\na hold of Daniel's finger, but\n\n140\n00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.110\nbased on something you are.\n\n141\n00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.530\nSo much easier for a user.\n\n142\n00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.870\nI don't have to worry about\nremembering my key fob,\n\n143\n00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.830\nI don't have to change my\npassword every 30 days.\n\n144\n00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:29.150\nIt's my fingerprint, I keep it with\nme all the time, it's there, right?\n\n145\n00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.990\nAnd as that technology gets better and\nbetter, and less easy to fake.\n\n146\n00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.520\nCuz some of those technologies\nwhen they first came out\n\n147\n00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.700\nPeople were finding easy ways around them.\n\n148\n00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.350\nHolding up a picture of somebody\nin front of that camera\n\n149\n00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:44.810\nmight have allowed me to\nauthenticate as them.\n\n150\n00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:47.340\nNow the technology is getting much,\nmuch better.\n\n151\n00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:51.290\nThey're doing things like vascular\nrecognition, fingerprint scanners.\n\n152\n00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:54.590\nFacial recognition is starting\nnow to look for signs of life.\n\n153\n00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.280\nMovement, heat, things like that.\n\n154\n00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.694\nSo, as these get better and better.\n\n155\n00:07:58.694 --> 00:08:01.770\nAnd as the cost of this goes down.\n\n156\n00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:06.274\nYou're going to see this more and\nmore in our corporate environment.\n\n157\n00:08:06.274 --> 00:08:10.047\nSo three things I can base this on,\nwe can base authentication on.\n\n158\n00:08:10.047 --> 00:08:14.090\nSomething you know,\nsomething you have, something you are.\n\n159\n00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:18.070\nThen we can step it up a notch and\nwe can start combing things.\n\n160\n00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.700\nThis is known as multi\nfactor authentication.\n\n161\n00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.190\nIf it's more than one factor,\nit's multi factor.\n\n162\n00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:25.760\nSo let's say you've got a smart card.\n\n163\n00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.180\nBut I set up the system so\n\n164\n00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:30.570\nthat when you swipe the card,\nyou then have to punch in a PIN.\n\n165\n00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:32.340\nA personal identification number.\n\n166\n00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.650\nRight?\nThat's something you know.\n\n167\n00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.410\nThe card is something you have.\n\n168\n00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:37.130\nThat's multi-factor authentication.\n\n169\n00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:39.940\nSame thing with biometrics.\n\n170\n00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.730\nI might have you swipe a fingerprint and\n\n171\n00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:46.450\nthen swipe a card or\npunch in a PIN or a password.\n\n172\n00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:47.268\nRight?\nKeep in mind,\n\n173\n00:08:47.268 --> 00:08:49.843\nwhen they talk about\nmulti-factor authentication.\n\n174\n00:08:49.843 --> 00:08:52.931\nIf you have to punch in a pin and\nthen type in a password,\n\n175\n00:08:52.931 --> 00:08:56.140\nthat's not multi-factor authentication.\n\n176\n00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.080\nYes, you're authenticating twice.\n\n177\n00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.470\nBut it's all based on the same factor,\nsomething you know.\n\n178\n00:09:01.488 --> 00:09:03.420\nIf you have to swipe a card and\n\n179\n00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.890\nthen hold up a key fob,\nboth of those are something you have.\n\n180\n00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:10.395\nSo that would not be considered\nmulti-factor authentication.\n\n181\n00:09:10.395 --> 00:09:13.390\nMulti-factor means more than\none factor of authentication.\n\n182\n00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:17.130\nSomething you know,\nsomething you have or something you are.\n\n183\n00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:21.400\n>> Now Mike it's very cool stuff that\nmulti-factors have definitely become in\n\n184\n00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.970\nthe name of the game anymore because\nof it's heightened security.\n\n185\n00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:26.520\nIt's a whole lot more difficult.\n\n186\n00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.526\nLike even if Mike stole my key fob, right?\n\n187\n00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:32.106\nHe could get in, but if I have a key\nfob and I gotta type in that pin,\n\n188\n00:09:32.106 --> 00:09:34.663\nnow he's gotta know my pin and\nhave my key fob.\n\n189\n00:09:34.663 --> 00:09:37.440\nMakes it a whole lot more difficult for\nyou to get passed that line of security.\n\n190\n00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.560\n>> Exactly right, and\nthat's the big advantage of multi-factor.\n\n191\n00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.670\nI might be able to steal his card,\nbut I don't know his pin.\n\n192\n00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:45.780\nI might find where he wrote his pin down,\nbut\n\n193\n00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.380\nI don't have access to his card\nbecause he keeps that in his wallet,\n\n194\n00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.710\nand he's a lot bigger than I am, and\nhe never takes that thing out, right?\n\n195\n00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:54.000\nSo, that's the idea behind multi-factor.\n\n196\n00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.690\nBy combining methods, we can make it\nmuch more difficult for those bad\n\n197\n00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:03.490\nguys to find to try to impersonate, or to\ntry to break that authentication method.\n\n198\n00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:06.150\n>> That's right, now we're talking\nabout authentication right?\n\n199\n00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.900\nWe're saying okay I'm typing in\na password, I'm swiping a card,\n\n200\n00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.420\nI've got a file but biometrics,\nand then it's authenticating me.\n\n201\n00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.400\nBut where exactly is that\nauthentication occurring?\n\n202\n00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.590\nNow Mike,\nyou were gonna help us out with this.\n\n203\n00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:19.440\nYou know where the magic happens.\n\n204\n00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:19.940\n>> I do.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n205\n00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:20.620\n>> Right now\n\n206\n00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.340\nI'm gonna tell you guys as well.\n\n207\n00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.760\nBut when, it depends on what we're doing.\n\n208\n00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.970\nIf we're logging on with a local account,\n\n209\n00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:29.700\nevery Windows system\nhas a SAM account file.\n\n210\n00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.840\nOr a secure, we call it a SAM file\nIt's a security account manager.\n\n211\n00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.980\nSo little database that\nstores those accounts.\n\n212\n00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.180\nSo if I want to create an account for\nsomebody on this machine, or\n\n213\n00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.870\nthat machine you have sitting at home.\n\n214\n00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:44.060\nIf you want to create an account for\neach one of your kids so\n\n215\n00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:47.760\nthat you can give one access and\ndeny the other access.\n\n216\n00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.890\nOr control when they can log on,\n\n217\n00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:51.980\nor when they should be do,\ndoing their homework, right.\n\n218\n00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.210\nYou create accounts for them,\n\n219\n00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:56.640\nand those are stored on that\nmachine in that SAM file.\n\n220\n00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:00.000\nAnd then when your child sits down at\nthe machine, they type in their name and\n\n221\n00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.250\ntheir password.\n\n222\n00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:04.920\nThe system then looks in that SAM file\nto see if they've typed in the right\n\n223\n00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:05.860\npassword.\n\n224\n00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.900\nAnd if they did,\nit allows them to access that machine\n\n225\n00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.400\nif it's not past their bedtime and\nyou've set up your parental controls.\n\n226\n00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.350\nIn a domain environment,\nwe centralize this.\n\n227\n00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:16.210\nRight.\nIt's all\n\n228\n00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:19.000\ngoing to take place on what's\nknown as a domain controller.\n\n229\n00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.450\nInstead of each machine having its\nindependent security database.\n\n230\n00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.940\nBecause with that system if I wanted\nto access more than one machine\n\n231\n00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:30.420\nI would need an account on each and\nevery machine.\n\n232\n00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:34.370\nAnd that's not gonna be very\nefficient in a large environment.\n\n233\n00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:38.636\nSo we centralize it, we put all the\naccounts in one database on a server that\n\n234\n00:11:38.636 --> 00:11:40.413\nthe whole network can access.\n\n235\n00:11:40.413 --> 00:11:42.302\nAnd so when I go to log onto my machine,\n\n236\n00:11:42.302 --> 00:11:44.673\nit doesn't check that\nlocal SAM file anymore.\n\n237\n00:11:44.673 --> 00:11:49.433\nIt sends my credentials across the network\nover to the domain controller, and\n\n238\n00:11:49.433 --> 00:11:52.640\nit has my account and\nknows what my password is.\n\n239\n00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.310\nAnd it can now decide whether or\nnot I should be allowed to logon.\n\n240\n00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:58.640\nAnd then, what access I should have.\n\n241\n00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.880\nAnd it doesn't matter\nwhat machine I go to.\n\n242\n00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.070\nRight?\nBecause the accounts are now centralized\n\n243\n00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.560\nin one location, I can go to any machine.\n\n244\n00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.860\nAn attempt to authenticate.\n\n245\n00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.610\nSo that's our domain authentication.\n\n246\n00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:13.430\nNow in a domain, there are a couple of\nsettings that they're gonna call out on\n\n247\n00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:15.860\nthe exam that we need to be familiar with.\n\n248\n00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:19.110\nSo I'm gonna take a look over\nhere at my Domain Controller.\n\n249\n00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:23.230\nAnd we're gonna open up something\nknown as Group Policy Management.\n\n250\n00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:27.110\nWhen we log on, again,\nwe're using a protocol called Kerberos and\n\n251\n00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:29.710\ntha's the protocol we use\nto send that username and\n\n252\n00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:34.410\npassword to that domain controller for\nverification.\n\n253\n00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:38.220\nOne of the things we might run\ninto is that if the clocks are off\n\n254\n00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.820\nbetween the machine you're sitting at and\n\n255\n00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:44.210\nthe main controller,\nif they don't agree on what time it is.\n\n256\n00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:46.070\nWe can have a problem authenticating.\n\n257\n00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:47.530\nThat's a security measure.\n\n258\n00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:52.020\nI don't want somebody trying to\nroll the clock back on a system.\n\n259\n00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:57.070\nIt thinks, the domain controller's\ngoing to detect that the difference\n\n260\n00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:01.910\nbetween the times is too great, and it's\nnot going to allow that authentication.\n\n261\n00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:05.530\nI could, one of the attacks that I\ncould use against authentication is\n\n262\n00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:06.880\nI don't know Daniel's password.\n\n263\n00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.090\nI haven't been able to guess it.\n\n264\n00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:13.130\nHe uses the sixty character password\nwith asky characters in there.\n\n265\n00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:13.920\nI can't break it.\n\n266\n00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.786\n>> Don't be hating.\n\n267\n00:13:14.786 --> 00:13:15.923\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n268\n00:13:15.923 --> 00:13:17.550\nI try to teach the users to do that.\n\n269\n00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:18.664\n>> Yeah, that's a so funny.\n\n270\n00:13:18.664 --> 00:13:21.190\n>> But.\n[LAUGH] What I could have tried to do is\n\n271\n00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:22.740\nwait until Daniel authenticates, right.\n\n272\n00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.830\nI know he's gonna log in\nat 8:00 this morning.\n\n273\n00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:26.350\nI see him walking into his desk.\n\n274\n00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:28.090\nHe's getting ready to authenticate.\n\n275\n00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:31.950\nHis credentials are gonna be sent across\nthe network to that domain controller.\n\n276\n00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:33.500\nWhat if I intercept those.\n\n277\n00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.050\nRight?\n\n278\n00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:36.010\nAnd now I don't have to\nknow Daniel's password.\n\n279\n00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:38.980\nI've got his credentials in this packet.\n\n280\n00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:43.288\nNow I could attempt to resend those\ncredentials later on to that domain\n\n281\n00:13:43.288 --> 00:13:46.656\ncontroller and\nsee if I could authenticate as Daniel.\n\n282\n00:13:46.656 --> 00:13:49.911\nWell, the domain controller's\ngonna say right.\n\n283\n00:13:49.911 --> 00:13:51.947\nBecause of the time stamp.\n\n284\n00:13:51.947 --> 00:13:55.587\nBecause that packet was sent at eight\no'clock in the morning, I'm trying to\n\n285\n00:13:55.587 --> 00:14:00.120\nreplay it at 10:30 in the morning,\nit's gonna say no, something is wrong.\n\n286\n00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.150\nThat's actually controlled\nthrough a policy.\n\n287\n00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:05.520\nIf we take a look at\nComputer Configuration Policies.\n\n288\n00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.340\nWhat am I in?\n\n289\n00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.260\nMy Default at Main Policies,\nSecurity, Account Polities,\n\n290\n00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.920\nand then Kerberos Policies.\n\n291\n00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.140\nMaximum tolerance for\ncomputer clock synchronization.\n\n292\n00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.131\nFive minutes.\n\n293\n00:14:16.131 --> 00:14:20.322\nSo if the client clock, or any packets\nif there's a time stamp in there,\n\n294\n00:14:20.322 --> 00:14:23.141\nif those packets are off\nby more than five minutes\n\n295\n00:14:23.141 --> 00:14:26.324\nfrom what the domain controller\nsays what the time is.\n\n296\n00:14:26.324 --> 00:14:27.351\nIt's not gonna allow it.\n\n297\n00:14:27.351 --> 00:14:28.568\nIt's gonna drop those packets.\n\n298\n00:14:28.568 --> 00:14:29.570\nIt's gonna ignore them.\n\n299\n00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:30.990\nSo if you're having trouble.\n\n300\n00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:33.764\nIf you've got a machine that hasn't been\nconnected to the network in a while,\n\n301\n00:14:33.764 --> 00:14:35.430\nit's trying to authenticate.\n\n302\n00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.970\nIt could be that he's not been\nable to synchronize his time.\n\n303\n00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:39.740\nThey do this in the background.\n\n304\n00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:44.760\nAll the machines on my network synchronize\ntheir time with the domain controller.\n\n305\n00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:48.320\nThat's what keeps everything in sync and\nwhy everybody can log on.\n\n306\n00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.510\nIf for\nsome reason that service isn't working or\n\n307\n00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:51.980\ntime synchronization isn't occurring.\n\n308\n00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.380\nThat's when we can start\nrunning into a problem or\n\n309\n00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:57.150\nsomebody is doing\nsomething malicious right.\n\n310\n00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:00.980\nCapturing packets and\ntrying to replay them at a later time.\n\n311\n00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:04.430\nSo five minutes by default\nis what kerbrose will allow.\n\n312\n00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:07.450\nI could change that\ntypically we don't want to.\n\n313\n00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:12.310\nAnother thing we need to be familiar\nwith is resetting those passwords.\n\n314\n00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:16.380\nWhat if somebody has\ncompromised Daniel's password?\n\n315\n00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.590\nHe thinks somebody's\nbeen logging in as him.\n\n316\n00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:19.730\nOr I can look at the log files.\n\n317\n00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:21.300\nDaniel was out today.\n\n318\n00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:24.920\nYet I can see that Daniel logged\nin at nine o'clock in the morning.\n\n319\n00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.760\nOr somebody,\nDaniel logged in at 2:30 in the morning\n\n320\n00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.040\nwhen nobody's suppose\nto be in the building.\n\n321\n00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.870\nSomebody must have Daniel's password.\n\n322\n00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:33.646\nHe swears it wasn't him.\n\n323\n00:15:33.646 --> 00:15:34.700\nSo what do I need to do?\n\n324\n00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.190\nI need to reset that password.\n\n325\n00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:38.240\nI need to change that password.\n\n326\n00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.360\nAnd to do that, we're gonna open up\nwhat we call Active Directory Users and\n\n327\n00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.300\nComputers.\n\n328\n00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.070\nThis is where all of those\naccounts are stored.\n\n329\n00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:49.175\nAnd I can find Daniel's account,\nand I can come in here,\n\n330\n00:15:49.175 --> 00:15:53.012\nif I have the appropriate permissions,\nand I can reset his password.\n\n331\n00:15:53.012 --> 00:15:56.774\nAnd I can assign a new password to that\naccount, and then I can tell Daniel hey,\n\n332\n00:15:56.774 --> 00:15:58.492\nhere's your temporary password.\n\n333\n00:15:58.492 --> 00:16:01.254\nAs soon as you log in,\nchange it to something only you know.\n\n334\n00:16:01.254 --> 00:16:03.580\nI don't even want to know your password.\n\n335\n00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.800\nSo resetting your password,\npretty easy for an admin.\n\n336\n00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:10.850\nAs a user, you can always go to\nyour ctrl-alt-del screen and\n\n337\n00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:13.240\nreset a password there, right?\n\n338\n00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:17.260\nIf you think somebody saw you\ntype in your password, or\n\n339\n00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.050\nsomething like that, you can reset it.\n\n340\n00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:22.760\nChange it to something else so that\nthey can't try to authenticate as you.\n\n341\n00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.000\nSo different places that have\nthe authentications occurring there.\n\n342\n00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.140\nYou've got the local and\n\n343\n00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:32.440\nthen you've got the domain accounts that\nare being checked by active directory.\n\n344\n00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:38.470\nAnother place we see authentication\noccurring is on our VPN servers.\n\n345\n00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.047\nAnd our wireless access points, all right.\n\n346\n00:16:40.047 --> 00:16:42.700\nWe've talked about that in other episodes.\n\n347\n00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.860\nIf I've got a user that's\noutside my network and\n\n348\n00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.540\nthey want to make that\nremote connection or\n\n349\n00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:51.330\nconnect to my wireless access point, well\nthey're going to have to authenticate.\n\n350\n00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:55.450\nAnd normally the VPN server, that remote\naccess server is going to say hey,\n\n351\n00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:58.290\ngive me your information and\nit's gonna turn around and\n\n352\n00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:02.540\npass it onto the domain controller for\nverification and then decide whether or\n\n353\n00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:06.230\nnot I should be allowed\nto make that connection.\n\n354\n00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:08.070\nSame thing with our wireless\naccess points, right?\n\n355\n00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:09.880\nWe type in that pass phrase and\n\n356\n00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.620\nwe should be able to make a connection\nto that wireless access point.\n\n357\n00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:17.690\nThe problem is, those devices\ntypically sit out my DMZ, right?\n\n358\n00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:19.300\nRemember that screen subnet.\n\n359\n00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.200\nIn fact I've got a drawing\nhere I can show you guys.\n\n360\n00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:27.020\nOut here, I've got my corporate network,\nwhere all my important servers and\n\n361\n00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:28.380\ndata resides.\n\n362\n00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:31.810\nI've got my Internet out here\nwhere you are at the hotel, or\n\n363\n00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:33.390\nif you're traveling or working from home.\n\n364\n00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:37.996\nThen I've got this perimeter network that\nlies in between my corporate network and\n\n365\n00:17:37.996 --> 00:17:38.862\nthe internet.\n\n366\n00:17:38.862 --> 00:17:42.998\nI've got a couple firewalls\nto create this perimeter,\n\n367\n00:17:42.998 --> 00:17:47.670\nthis screen subnet, this DMZ,\nseveral names that it goes by.\n\n368\n00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:52.020\nThe problem is these devices out here\nare gonna allow public access, right?\n\n369\n00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:56.150\nI have to before you make your connection,\nbefore you authenticate I have to allow\n\n370\n00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:59.730\nthat connection to come through here, so\nyou can talk to my wireless access point.\n\n371\n00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:02.140\nOr you can talk to my VPN server.\n\n372\n00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.130\nAnd they're gonna authenticate and\ndecided whether or\n\n373\n00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:06.050\nnot you should be allowed\nto make that connection.\n\n374\n00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:11.220\nAnd the problem is, again, because\nof that access, that public access,\n\n375\n00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:15.860\nthat front firewall allows certain\nanonymous connections to come through.\n\n376\n00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:19.700\nThat means the bad guy could\nattempt to hack on my VPN server.\n\n377\n00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:21.690\nOr my wireless access point.\n\n378\n00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:24.570\nSo what we can do is we can\nmove the authentication back\n\n379\n00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:25.850\nto my corporate network.\n\n380\n00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:28.600\nWe can tell these guys out here,\nhey, don't worry about it.\n\n381\n00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.300\nJust accept that authentication\nthat's coming in and\n\n382\n00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:36.410\npass it back to this guy back here who's\nin my nice, secure corporate network.\n\n383\n00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:38.480\nLet him deal with the authentication.\n\n384\n00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:43.690\nThat's known as RADIUS, remote\nauthentication dial in user service and\n\n385\n00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.050\nit again,\n\n386\n00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:49.560\nwhat's gonna happen is my authentication\ncomes through to my VPN server.\n\n387\n00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.380\nThe VPN server just says,\nhold on a second, and\n\n388\n00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:56.650\nhe takes my authentication traffic and\njust sends it back to that RADIUS server\n\n389\n00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:58.980\nand that RADIUS server can\nthen decide whether or\n\n390\n00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:03.180\nnot I should be allowed access,\nand you can tell the VPN server.\n\n391\n00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.300\nSame thing with my wireless access point,\nright?\n\n392\n00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:10.520\nThat wireless client attempts to\nconnect to the wireless access point,\n\n393\n00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:14.580\nthe access point says nope, wait a second,\nI'm gonna forward that request back here\n\n394\n00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:19.120\nto the radius server, let them decide,\nor let the radius server decide and\n\n395\n00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:22.320\nthen I'll let you know if you're\nallowed to connect or not.\n\n396\n00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.230\nNow, terminology-wise,\nthis is my RADIUS server in\n\n397\n00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:30.820\na Microsoft world that's known as MPS and\na Cisco environment,\n\n398\n00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:36.437\nthey've got their set up which is TAG ACS\nor TAC if I can remember how that goes.\n\n399\n00:19:36.437 --> 00:19:42.580\nTACACS or\nTACACS+ is their implementation of radius.\n\n400\n00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.390\nRadius is a platform independent term,\n\n401\n00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:49.820\neach vendor has their own way of\nimplementing a radius solution.\n\n402\n00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:53.780\nAlso another term that you should\nbe familiar with, radius clients.\n\n403\n00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:57.370\nEasy to think that this guy is the radius\nclient because we think client and\n\n404\n00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:00.090\nthis is the first thing\nthat pops into our head but\n\n405\n00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:04.760\nthis computer is not dealing with\nthe radius server directly, right?\n\n406\n00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:10.460\nThis is a remote access client who ends\nup talking to my remote access server.\n\n407\n00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:16.350\nThe remote access server is the radius\nclient who talks to the radius server.\n\n408\n00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:16.900\nRight?\n\n409\n00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.090\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n410\n00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:21.420\nThe wireless access point would\nbe considered a radius client.\n\n411\n00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:25.690\nHe's going to forward that authentication\nback to that RADIUS server.\n\n412\n00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:28.580\nSo that's our different methods for\nauthentication.\n\n413\n00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.740\nYou've got local authentication,\nwe've got domain authentication,\n\n414\n00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.020\nand then we've got our\nremote authentication.\n\n415\n00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.974\nNot talking about remote users,\nper se, but\n\n416\n00:20:36.974 --> 00:20:42.273\nmoving that authentication process off\nof these guys back to a remote solution.\n\n417\n00:20:43.655 --> 00:20:44.330\nAll right.\n\n418\n00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:47.550\nSo Daniel, I guess then the next thing we\nwanna talk about there is good old public\n\n419\n00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:48.790\nkey infrastructure.\n\n420\n00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:50.670\nWe've mentioned certificates\na couple of times,\n\n421\n00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:53.652\nand we need to understand\nwhere we get those.\n\n422\n00:20:53.652 --> 00:20:57.690\nAnd that the hierarchy that exists, and\nhow these things works, why they're so\n\n423\n00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.940\nmuch stronger than say,\nusing a user name and password.\n\n424\n00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:07.220\nCertificates are issued by what's\nknown as a certificate authority.\n\n425\n00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:11.900\nA certificate authority is responsible for\ngenerating these certificates.\n\n426\n00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:16.020\nA certificate ties an identity to a set of\n\n427\n00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:20.260\nkeys that we can use for\nauthentication and encryption.\n\n428\n00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:22.950\nSo a CA is what we call it.\n\n429\n00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:27.260\nA CA, or certification authority,\nis what generates these certificates.\n\n430\n00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:34.200\nThere's also another term we need to be\nfamiliar with is registration authority.\n\n431\n00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.010\nIf you're gonna request a certificate,\nall right?\n\n432\n00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:38.920\nYou have to prove your identity.\n\n433\n00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.570\nI can't just call up that certificate\nauthority and say hey, I'm Daniel.\n\n434\n00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:44.310\nIssue me a certificate.\n\n435\n00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:48.630\nI've gotta prove my identity somehow.\n\n436\n00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:51.170\nThe registration authority\nis what does that.\n\n437\n00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:52.490\nThe registration authority says wait,\n\n438\n00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:56.760\nbefore you can get a certificate,\nfill out all this information.\n\n439\n00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.840\nOr provide me this information.\n\n440\n00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.680\nIn a Microsoft world,\nregistration authority and\n\n441\n00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:05.900\na certification authority\nare typically the same machine.\n\n442\n00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:08.980\nBut in other solutions,\nthose might be separate servers.\n\n443\n00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:12.250\nSo it's important we understand\nthat term and what they're doing.\n\n444\n00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:15.840\nThe registration authority is the one\nthat's verifying the identity.\n\n445\n00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.630\nOnce it's done that,\nit can pass that information over to\n\n446\n00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:23.160\nthe certificate authority, and he can\ngenerate the certificate and the key pair.\n\n447\n00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.140\nAll right, so two separate processes.\n\n448\n00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:28.198\nIn a Microsoft world though,\nthey're on the same server.\n\n449\n00:22:28.198 --> 00:22:30.580\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n450\n00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:34.310\nAnother thing we have to be\nfamiliar with is a revocation list.\n\n451\n00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:38.200\nWhen we look at certificates, certificates\nare a lot like drivers license, right?\n\n452\n00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.550\nAt least here in the U.S.,\nI use this analogy all the time.\n\n453\n00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:45.030\nYou get issued a certificate,\nyou now that certificate and\n\n454\n00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.940\nmaybe it's loaded up onto a smart card,\nor what have you.\n\n455\n00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:51.510\nYou can use that to authenticate or\nwhatever you need to do.\n\n456\n00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:55.280\nMaybe you use your certificate for\nencryption purposes.\n\n457\n00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.140\nWell at some point I might need\nto revoke that certificate.\n\n458\n00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:59.780\nWhat if you leave the company?\n\n459\n00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.650\nYou're no longer allowed to make\nthat remote access connection and\n\n460\n00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:04.990\nuse that certificate to authenticate,\nright?\n\n461\n00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:07.730\nWell, I revoke the certificate.\n\n462\n00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:10.720\nJust like I would suspend\na driver's license if you\n\n463\n00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.330\ndidn't pay your speeding ticket.\n\n464\n00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:16.340\nBut the problem is I can't reach out and\ngrab that certificate.\n\n465\n00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:17.900\nHow do I get it back from you?\n\n466\n00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:20.710\nYou could have copied it,\nput it anywhere you wanted,\n\n467\n00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:23.620\nand you could attempt to\nuse that certificate again.\n\n468\n00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:26.140\nJust like with my driver's license,\nif it gets suspended.\n\n469\n00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.980\nThey don't come to my house and\ncut up my driver's license, right?\n\n470\n00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:30.580\nThey suspend it.\n\n471\n00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:34.260\nSo if I get pulled over,\nI hand that officer my driver's license,\n\n472\n00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.740\nhow does he know if it's been suspended or\nnot?\n\n473\n00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:38.280\nBecause he looks it up in that database.\n\n474\n00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.450\nHe goes back to the computer\nin his car and he says,\n\n475\n00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:42.470\noh this is showing it's suspended.\n\n476\n00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:45.580\nThat's the same thing the certificate\nrevocation list does.\n\n477\n00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:48.770\nEvery time my computer gets\npresented a certificate.\n\n478\n00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:53.000\nThe first thing it's gonna do is verify\nthat the certificate hasn't been revoked.\n\n479\n00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.050\nCertificate authorities maintain a list of\nall the certificates they've ever revoked.\n\n480\n00:23:57.050 --> 00:24:00.376\nSo if I go to a sever and say,\nhey, show me your certificate,\n\n481\n00:24:00.376 --> 00:24:02.610\nthat server presents the certificate.\n\n482\n00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:05.014\nI look at it and I say, let me check.\n\n483\n00:24:05.014 --> 00:24:07.760\nI go check the certificate\nratification list.\n\n484\n00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.790\nOh, you're not the list,\nyour certificate is still valid.\n\n485\n00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:12.790\nI'll go ahead and accept it, right.\n\n486\n00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:16.170\nSo that's the way that the certificate\nratification list works,\n\n487\n00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:18.350\nis it's just a place that I can publish.\n\n488\n00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:22.530\nOnce certificates have been revoked\nbecause I can't reach out and\n\n489\n00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:25.290\npull those certificates back\nonce they've been issued.\n\n490\n00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:28.580\nAnd I might revoke them because\nthe employees left the company, or\n\n491\n00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:33.360\nbecause they no longer need that level of\naccess, or I feel like their certificate\n\n492\n00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.579\nwas compromised,\nI don't want anybody using it.\n\n493\n00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:38.070\nOr whatever the case, so\n\n494\n00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:41.720\nseveral different reasons we might\nend up revoking that certificate.\n\n495\n00:24:43.442 --> 00:24:45.110\nAll right, the other thing\nwe need to be familiar with,\n\n496\n00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:51.830\nwith certificates is what's known as the\nchain of trust, or a certification chain.\n\n497\n00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:56.210\nWhen we set up a certificate authority,\nit's set up as a hierarchy.\n\n498\n00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:58.790\nAnd I've got a drawing\nhere I can show you.\n\n499\n00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:02.060\nLet me open up this drawing here.\n\n500\n00:25:05.582 --> 00:25:08.130\nAll right, and\nthis is what we would call a PKI, or\n\n501\n00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:12.650\na public key infrastructure,\nand my certificate hierarchy.\n\n502\n00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:16.730\nThat first server that we set up, that we\ninstalled this certification authority\n\n503\n00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:19.590\nrole on, that becomes my root CA.\n\n504\n00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:24.947\nHe is the very top of the infrastructure,\n\n505\n00:25:24.947 --> 00:25:28.320\nbut we don't stop there.\n\n506\n00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.890\nIf I just have that one\ncertificate authority and\n\n507\n00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:35.840\nhe issues out all of my certificates\nto all my users of computers.\n\n508\n00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.470\nIf this guy ever get compromised,\n\n509\n00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:41.280\nevery certificate I've ever\nissued has to be redone.\n\n510\n00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.030\nThe entire thing is out the window.\n\n511\n00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:43.630\nRight?\n\n512\n00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:45.360\nSo we don't keep that.\n\n513\n00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.390\nWe typically don't even\nkeep this guy online.\n\n514\n00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:50.560\nThat first CA we set up,\nwe go through the set-up process.\n\n515\n00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:51.950\nWe take it offline.\n\n516\n00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:57.040\nBut before we take him offline,\nwe issue certificates from the root\n\n517\n00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:00.640\nto a second level in our hierarchy.\n\n518\n00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.230\nNow when you set this up,\n\n519\n00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:05.710\ndepending on how big you are,\nyou might just have two levels.\n\n520\n00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:08.890\nYou might have your root and\nthen your subordinates and\n\n521\n00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:12.130\nnot have this intermediate\nlevel that I have here.\n\n522\n00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:14.710\nIt's the subordinates that do the work.\n\n523\n00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:19.860\nThey're the ones that issue certificates\nto users, to computers, to routers,\n\n524\n00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:22.420\nwhatever we're trying to\nissue those certificates to.\n\n525\n00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:26.240\nLarger environments might have this\nintermediate in their hierarchy,\n\n526\n00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.765\nand these are known as policy CAs.\n\n527\n00:26:29.765 --> 00:26:33.975\nThese would control what it\ntakes to get a certificate.\n\n528\n00:26:33.975 --> 00:26:39.275\nI might issue certificates to my\nemployees as well as my contractors.\n\n529\n00:26:39.275 --> 00:26:40.575\nI have different policies in place.\n\n530\n00:26:40.575 --> 00:26:43.850\nEmployees just have to have\nan account in Active Directory, and\n\n531\n00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:45.690\nthey can request a certificate.\n\n532\n00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:47.370\nContractors, however,\n\n533\n00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:51.540\nthey need to go through some additional\nsteps in order to request a certificate.\n\n534\n00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:54.630\nSo I've got a separate policy CA for\nthem, and\n\n535\n00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:57.220\nthey can get their certificates\nmaybe from over here.\n\n536\n00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:02.330\n>> Now Mike, what is the purpose really\nof having all these different CA servers.\n\n537\n00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:04.970\nWhy not just have one CA server and\nthat be it?\n\n538\n00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:08.270\n>> That's a great question, and it comes\nback again to the whole security thing.\n\n539\n00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:12.115\nIf this server is compromised,\nall I have to do is worry about\n\n540\n00:27:12.115 --> 00:27:16.880\nre-issuing the certificates that\nthis one issuing CA issued.\n\n541\n00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:19.110\nThe rest of them are still good, right?\n\n542\n00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:20.550\nIf I just had the root and\n\n543\n00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:25.310\nnothing else, then if one gets\ncompromised, they're all compromised.\n\n544\n00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:27.220\nAnd I have to start all over.\n\n545\n00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:30.570\nSo we're really splitting the risk up,\nright?\n\n546\n00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:35.570\nWe're increasing our, I don't want to say\nincreasing our fault tolerance but we're-\n\n547\n00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:36.330\n>> Kind of though, right?\n\n548\n00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:37.090\n>> We kind of are.\n>> So yeah,\n\n549\n00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:38.620\nyou got multiple points of failure, and\n\n550\n00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.110\nthat gives you the redundancy\nwe're looking for.\n\n551\n00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:40.940\n>> Yes, exactly!\n\n552\n00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:43.370\nI have to start over with my\nentire infrastructure there.\n\n553\n00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:47.950\nAll right, now there is a trust\nthat goes on in this hierarchy.\n\n554\n00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:52.380\nThe root Is the very first one we set up,\nso there's nobody higher than him.\n\n555\n00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.940\nThere's nobody to issue\nthe root a certificate.\n\n556\n00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:57.590\nHe issues himself a certificate.\n\n557\n00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:01.520\nHe generates a certificate for himself,\nsigns it himself, and says here we go,\n\n558\n00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.520\nI'm gonna start the hierarchy.\n\n559\n00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:08.030\nThen, the root is used to issue\ncertificates, if you have this level,\n\n560\n00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:10.030\nto the intermediate or the policy CAs.\n\n561\n00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:15.480\nAnd that gives them the authority\nto work on the root CA's behalf.\n\n562\n00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:21.080\nAnd then the intermediate CAs issues\ncertificates to the subordinate CAs,\n\n563\n00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:26.020\nwhich again gives them the ability to do\nwork on behalf of that intermediate CA.\n\n564\n00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:29.950\nAnd then the users are issued\ncertificates by the subordinate CA.\n\n565\n00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:32.100\nBut there's a chain that occurs here.\n\n566\n00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:34.180\nIf I look at that user certificate,\n\n567\n00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.690\nI'll see that it was issued\nby the subordinate CA.\n\n568\n00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:40.620\nBut I can also see in that\ncertificate that its certificate\n\n569\n00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:44.290\nwas issued by Intermediate CA, and\nits certificate was issued by Root CA.\n\n570\n00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:48.210\nAnd then the question is,\ndo I trust the Root?\n\n571\n00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:52.700\nIf I trust the Root CA, then I trust the\ncertificate that was issued to that user.\n\n572\n00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:57.380\nBut I have to be able to chain it back\nup to that trusted root, all right.\n\n573\n00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.640\nAnd I'll show you an example here.\n\n574\n00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:04.020\nI have a user here and\nI've issued them a certificate.\n\n575\n00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:08.322\nAnd if I take a look at this certificate,\nAll right,\n\n576\n00:29:08.322 --> 00:29:10.350\nI don't want the properties silly Mike.\n\n577\n00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:12.770\nThere we go,\ntake a look at this certificate,\n\n578\n00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:16.890\nI can see it was issues to\nan administrator, issued by issuing CA,\n\n579\n00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:20.580\nthat's just the name I gave my\nsubordinates certificate of authority.\n\n580\n00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:23.010\nBut if I take a look at\nthe certification path,\n\n581\n00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:28.080\nI'll see that my certificate was issued by\nissuing CA, which was issued by Root CA.\n\n582\n00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.100\nAll right.\n\n583\n00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.800\nThat's that chain of trust that occurs.\n\n584\n00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:34.850\nAnd the question,\nif I try to use my certificate.\n\n585\n00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:40.310\nThen they're gonna look at it and\nsay, okay do I trust Root CA?\n\n586\n00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:41.460\nAnd I'll show you.\n\n587\n00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:42.830\nLet's take a look here.\n\n588\n00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:45.810\nIf I open up Internet Explorer\non this guy.\n\n589\n00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:51.640\nThis computer,\nI've got to find my options here.\n\n590\n00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:56.260\nI go to content and\ncertificates and trusted root.\n\n591\n00:29:57.795 --> 00:29:58.625\nThere's root CA.\n\n592\n00:29:58.625 --> 00:30:03.985\nSo you see root CA is in the list of\ntrusted root certification authorities.\n\n593\n00:30:03.985 --> 00:30:06.705\nSo if I try to use this certificate\non this machine, this machine says,\n\n594\n00:30:06.705 --> 00:30:12.820\noh your certificate was issued by\nissuing CA, which was issued by root CA.\n\n595\n00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:16.270\nI trust root CA so\nI'm gonna trust your certificate.\n\n596\n00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:18.560\nTo take it back to\nthe driver's license thing,\n\n597\n00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:22.120\nwhen that police officer pulls\nme over I hand him my license.\n\n598\n00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.950\nHe trusts all the information\non that license is valid, right?\n\n599\n00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:26.850\nMy address, my age, my weight.\n\n600\n00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:28.750\nThings like that, why does he trust that?\n\n601\n00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:31.290\nWhy doesn't he have to\nverify the information?\n\n602\n00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:35.430\nBecause, the issuing party, the State\nof Florida, put their stamp on it.\n\n603\n00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:39.330\nThey say, we've already verified all that,\nso we're gonna stamp it and\n\n604\n00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:42.340\nseal it up, and\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n605\n00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:45.600\nThat's what's going on here,\nis that chain of trust.\n\n606\n00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:51.570\nNow, when we work with certificates, we've\ngot private CAs, and we've got public CAs.\n\n607\n00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:53.310\nThis an example of a private CA.\n\n608\n00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:57.400\nI installed that root CA\non one of my own servers.\n\n609\n00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:00.990\nAnd then I installed the intermediate\nCA on another one of my servers.\n\n610\n00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:03.700\nAnd I'm now issuing certificates\nout to all my users.\n\n611\n00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:07.810\nAnd all of my computers had been\nconfigured to trust root CA.\n\n612\n00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:11.890\nI used group policy to say, hey, here's\nthe root server certificate, add it to\n\n613\n00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:16.710\nyour trusted roots, trust any certificates\nthat are issued by this hierarchy.\n\n614\n00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:21.090\nSo it works great internally when we\nuse these private CA's that I set up.\n\n615\n00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:23.420\nIt doesn't cost me any money.\n\n616\n00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:25.960\nWell I have the license for\nthe operating system, right.\n\n617\n00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:27.130\nBut I've installed it.\n\n618\n00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:30.330\nI can issue all the certificates\nI want all day long.\n\n619\n00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:31.240\nDoesn't cost me anything.\n\n620\n00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.270\nRight?\n\n621\n00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:33.620\nAnd here's the problem.\n\n622\n00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:36.380\nWhat if I issue a certificate\nto my web server?\n\n623\n00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:38.785\nSo that my customers can\ncome to my website and\n\n624\n00:31:38.785 --> 00:31:41.910\nsetup secure socket layer,\nand encrypt that traffic.\n\n625\n00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:44.430\nThey don't want to put their credit card\nnumber in there until they have that\n\n626\n00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:45.880\nsecure connection.\n\n627\n00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:49.340\nWell their computer is gonna ask my web\nserver, hey show me your certificate,\n\n628\n00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:52.360\nsend me your key so\nwe can start encrypting traffic.\n\n629\n00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:54.960\nMy server's gonna say, sure,\nhere's my certificate.\n\n630\n00:31:54.960 --> 00:32:00.336\nTheir computer looks at it and says,\nroot CA, who the heck is root CA?\n\n631\n00:32:00.336 --> 00:32:01.592\nDon't think that's gonna work, right?\n\n632\n00:32:01.592 --> 00:32:05.552\n>> Yeah, that's not one of those\nlovely trusted entities out there and\n\n633\n00:32:05.552 --> 00:32:08.214\nthat's It's really a good\nlesson on where and\n\n634\n00:32:08.214 --> 00:32:12.360\nwhen creating your own certificate\nauthority is appropriate.\n\n635\n00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:14.210\nIf we're having a website,\nwe want people to attach to it,\n\n636\n00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:17.640\nwe're probably going to want to go with a\nknown entity that does this for a living.\n\n637\n00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:19.172\nIt's going to cost us\na little bit of money.\n\n638\n00:32:19.172 --> 00:32:20.625\nNow, can we do it?\n\n639\n00:32:20.625 --> 00:32:21.585\nMike, we sure can.\n\n640\n00:32:21.585 --> 00:32:25.250\n>> Absolutely, there are third parties\nout there, this is what they do,\n\n641\n00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:31.835\nthey run certificate authorities, like\nVerisign or Thought or GTE or Equifax.\n\n642\n00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:34.190\nI'm trying to think.\n\n643\n00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.700\nThere's dozens.\n\n644\n00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:37.800\nIn fact, if we can look on my computer,\nI can show you the list.\n\n645\n00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:41.300\nThese others, the ones beside Root,\njust make that a little bit bigger here.\n\n646\n00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:47.840\nAll right, we can see things like, let\nme sort that, Baltimore, GTE, Microsoft,\n\n647\n00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:54.520\nThought, Verisign,\nthese are all third-party companies.\n\n648\n00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.910\nAnd I didn't have to add\nthese to my trusted roots,\n\n649\n00:32:56.910 --> 00:33:00.730\nmy operating system already\nknows to trust them.\n\n650\n00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:04.780\nSo if I'm setting up a website that's\ngonna be accessed by the public,\n\n651\n00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:07.320\nmost likely what I'm gonna do\nis go to one of these companies,\n\n652\n00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:10.600\nlike Verisign, and\nsay I wanna buy a certificate from you.\n\n653\n00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:14.900\nHave your public key infrastructure\nissue my server a certificate.\n\n654\n00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:19.090\nThat way when that customer comes to\nmy website and my server presents\n\n655\n00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:23.650\nthe certificate to that computer that\nthey're using, it says Verisign, Verisign.\n\n656\n00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:25.730\nOh, I trust Verisign.\n\n657\n00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:29.330\nI know they did their job and verified all\nthat information first before they ever\n\n658\n00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:32.770\nissued the certificate, so I'm just gonna\ngo ahead and trust the certificate.\n\n659\n00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:35.450\nThey get the nice green\nbar across their browser.\n\n660\n00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:37.790\nThey know their data is safe.\n\n661\n00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:41.160\nSo you got public CAs that I\ncan use that are much easier to\n\n662\n00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:45.130\nuse because they're already trusted by all\nthe Windows operating systems out there.\n\n663\n00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:47.390\nSo if I'm dealing with the public,\nthat's the way to go.\n\n664\n00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:49.620\nThere is a downside to that though.\n\n665\n00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:50.910\nIt costs money.\n\n666\n00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:53.670\nThey can be from hundreds to\nthousands of dollars, and\n\n667\n00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:56.060\nthey have to be renewed every year or\nevery two years.\n\n668\n00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:58.230\nSo this is a recurring\ncost associated with it.\n\n669\n00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:59.940\n>> Good way to get on\nthat revocation list.\n\n670\n00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:02.290\nIt has expired,\nyou're not getting anywhere.\n\n671\n00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:02.985\n>> That's right.\n\n672\n00:34:02.985 --> 00:34:03.620\n[LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n673\n00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:07.910\nif I've got to deal with the public,\nI don't want them coming to my website and\n\n674\n00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:10.750\ngetting a warning that says hey,\nI don't know who Mike CA is.\n\n675\n00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:12.670\nAre you sure you want to connect?\n\n676\n00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:14.680\nThey're most likely going\nto close that webpage and\n\n677\n00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:16.880\ngo to some other site and\nbuy their product.\n\n678\n00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:19.430\nSo I might need to.\n\n679\n00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:21.770\nThe expense is worth it.\n\n680\n00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:26.090\nInternally however, I'm not buying\ncertificates for every one of my users,\n\n681\n00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:27.690\nit's only used in-house.\n\n682\n00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:29.860\nSo I don't care if the public trusts it or\nnot.\n\n683\n00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:31.420\nSo I'll set up my own\ncertificate authority,\n\n684\n00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:36.120\nmy own public fee infrastructure to issue\ncertificates that are used internally.\n\n685\n00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:38.050\nSo, in most environments,\nwe see that we use both.\n\n686\n00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:41.220\nWe've got an internal,\nprivate certificate authority, or\n\n687\n00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:44.960\npublic key infrastructure, for\ncertificates that are used in-house.\n\n688\n00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:48.630\nBut then I also have a few certificates\nthat I've bought from a public CA,\n\n689\n00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:54.430\nthat use their public key infrastructure\nto issue certificates to my web server,\n\n690\n00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:56.210\nthe front end of my mail server.\n\n691\n00:34:56.210 --> 00:35:01.290\nAnything that has to be accessed by people\nthat aren't gonna trust my internal CA.\n\n692\n00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:05.140\nSo again, the key there though is,\nit's all about the trust.\n\n693\n00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:08.840\nSo we take a look at that chain of trust\non that's been issued by a public CA,\n\n694\n00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:13.150\nI've got my browser open up here, and\nyou see Google secures their connection.\n\n695\n00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:16.905\nSo if I click on this lock,\nI can click on Connection.\n\n696\n00:35:16.905 --> 00:35:20.169\nI can see the identity of this\nwebsite has been verified by\n\n697\n00:35:20.169 --> 00:35:22.080\nGoogle Internet Authority G2.\n\n698\n00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:25.910\nWell, that doesn't sound all that secure.\n\n699\n00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:27.650\nGoogle is identifying themselves?\n\n700\n00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:29.067\n>> They know who they are, Mike [LAUGH].\n\n701\n00:35:29.067 --> 00:35:29.988\n>> They do.\n\n702\n00:35:29.988 --> 00:35:31.660\nI'm supposed to just trust that.\n\n703\n00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:34.950\nWell, let's see what happens if\nI click Certificate Information.\n\n704\n00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:35.616\nHere I can see,\n\n705\n00:35:35.616 --> 00:35:38.550\nthere's Google's certificate that\nwas issued to the web server.\n\n706\n00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:41.205\nBut above that,\nI can see that certificate for\n\n707\n00:35:41.205 --> 00:35:44.380\nGoogle was issued by\nGoogle Internet Authority G2.\n\n708\n00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:47.170\nThat's that intermediate,\nor I should say that's that\n\n709\n00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:51.350\nissuing C at the bottom of that\nhierarchy I was showing you earlier.\n\n710\n00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:57.040\nWell, that certificate was issued by\nsomebody known as GeoTrust Global.\n\n711\n00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:04.410\nOh, so Google went and bought from a\nthird-party CA, a certificate for theirs.\n\n712\n00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:05.430\nAnd we can chain that back up.\n\n713\n00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:10.612\nIf I go over here to my Settings or\nthis browser, and\n\n714\n00:36:10.612 --> 00:36:16.157\nlet's go to Settings and\nthen Advanced Settings, and\n\n715\n00:36:16.157 --> 00:36:23.050\ndown here I'll find my HTTPS and\nSSL managed certificates.\n\n716\n00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:27.967\nAnd I can go into my system root,\nand I can scroll down through here,\n\n717\n00:36:27.967 --> 00:36:32.801\nand I can see there's GeoTrust Global,\nso that's why my computer\n\n718\n00:36:32.801 --> 00:36:37.494\ntrusts the certificate that\nGoogle's website is presenting.\n\n719\n00:36:37.494 --> 00:36:41.446\nI'm trying to connect to Google, their\nservers saying, here's my certificate,\n\n720\n00:36:41.446 --> 00:36:42.234\nsee I am Google.\n\n721\n00:36:42.234 --> 00:36:46.130\nMy computer says, well wait,\nwho issued you the certificate?\n\n722\n00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:51.485\nOh, it was that Google Internet Authority.\n\n723\n00:36:51.485 --> 00:36:53.320\nWell, who issued them the certificate?\n\n724\n00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.515\nOh, GeoTrust.\n\n725\n00:36:55.515 --> 00:36:59.630\nI trust GeoTrust, therefore I trust\nthat entire public key infrastructure,\n\n726\n00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:03.385\nI'll trust your certificate, but\nlet's set up a secure connection.\n\n727\n00:37:03.385 --> 00:37:06.820\nSo that's really what PKI is all about.\n\n728\n00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:09.173\nIt's being able to issue certificates and\n\n729\n00:37:09.173 --> 00:37:12.321\nthen chain those certificates\nback up to a trusted root.\n\n730\n00:37:12.321 --> 00:37:17.160\n>> Very, very cool and it's basically\nhow we do things like secure browsing.\n\n731\n00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.650\nThat is one of the greatest\nbuilt-in functions.\n\n732\n00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:23.626\nNow I can go to my bank, I can go\nto Amazon, I can go to wherever and\n\n733\n00:37:23.626 --> 00:37:26.135\nplug in that credit card information and\n\n734\n00:37:26.135 --> 00:37:29.702\nfeel fairly secure that it's\nnot gonna be compromised.\n\n735\n00:37:29.702 --> 00:37:31.806\nThere are some pretty\nsmart guys out there.\n\n736\n00:37:31.806 --> 00:37:35.391\nBut I know this PKI stuff can kinda\nfeel like you're drinking from a fire\n\n737\n00:37:35.391 --> 00:37:36.010\nhose a lot.\n\n738\n00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:39.240\nBut the great thing about it is,\nyou can just watch this episode over and\n\n739\n00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:42.040\nover again until it starts to make\nsense if it doesn't all ready.\n\n740\n00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:44.900\nMike, you've done a really good\njob of explaining, I do believe,\n\n741\n00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:48.490\nand I'm sure our audience out\nthere is appreciating it as well.\n\n742\n00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:52.080\nBecause it can feel pretty cryptic and\ndifficult to handle, but\n\n743\n00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.450\nI think you laid it out very nicely.\n\n744\n00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:57.244\n>> Good, good, it's complex, remember for\nthis exam just understand the difference\n\n745\n00:37:57.244 --> 00:38:01.104\nbetween a public certificate of authority\nand private, where I would see those used.\n\n746\n00:38:01.104 --> 00:38:04.638\nRemember about that certificate\nreification list, that I have to be able\n\n747\n00:38:04.638 --> 00:38:08.500\nto verify that a certificate's being\npresented to me, has not been revoked.\n\n748\n00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:10.300\nAnd remember that concept of trust.\n\n749\n00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:11.290\n>> That's right.\n\n750\n00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:13.914\nMike is there anything else we need\nto cover before we close this show?\n\n751\n00:38:13.914 --> 00:38:14.760\n>> I think that's it.\n\n752\n00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:15.420\n>> All right.\n\n753\n00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:16.390\nWell, hopefully you enjoyed it.\n\n754\n00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:17.930\nWe had a great time making it for you.\n\n755\n00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:18.790\nThanks for watching.\n\n756\n00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:20.330\nSigning off for ITProTV.\n\n757\n00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:21.800\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n758\n00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:22.760\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n759\n00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.410\n>> And we'll see you next

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.763 --> 00:00:19.980\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, joining\nme today in the studio, well again,\n\n4\n00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.920\nit's none other than Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:22.590\nHow's it going, Mike?\n\n6\n00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.750\n>> Oh, it's going great, Daniel.\n\n7\n00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.940\nWe've got some good stuff coming\nyour way with our MTA content.\n\n8\n00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.710\nThis one we're going to be looking at.\n\n9\n00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.290\nPermission.\n\n10\n00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.960\nSomething that we've got to be able to do.\n\n11\n00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.347\nWe've got to understand the way\nthese permissions work.\n\n12\n00:00:33.347 --> 00:00:36.961\nHow we apply them, how they combine,\nhow they interact, cuz there are actually\n\n13\n00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:40.004\ndifferent types of permissions that\nwe have to be able to work with.\n\n14\n00:00:40.004 --> 00:00:44.540\nAnd one of our primary jobs as IT is to\nmake sure my users have the appropriate\n\n15\n00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.623\nlevel of access.\n\n16\n00:00:45.623 --> 00:00:49.280\nNot too much, not too little,\nand we do that with permissions.\n\n17\n00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.540\nSo lots of different ones that we're\ngonna go over today here Daniel.\n\n18\n00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.540\n>> Yeah.\nPermissions are, they're a lot of fun.\n\n19\n00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.780\nRight?\nCuz you gotta get it just right.\n\n20\n00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.470\nLike Mike said it's not too much,\nnot too little.\n\n21\n00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.180\nI want to get that just\nright like old Goldilocks.\n\n22\n00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.900\nShe loved that stuff.\n\n23\n00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.580\nDidn't she?\n\n24\n00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.880\nAnd she had it right when\nit comes to permissions.\n\n25\n00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.780\nMike, as admin, you don't want your\nusers being able to log in and\n\n26\n00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.470\nchecking things that maybe they\ndon't need to be looking at.\n\n27\n00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.920\nI don't know, things like financial\ninformation, things of that nature.\n\n28\n00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.030\nHow do I stop that?\n\n29\n00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.550\nThat's what we're gonna cover\ntoday is those permissions.\n\n30\n00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.160\nMaybe I'm coming through a share.\n\n31\n00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.090\nMaybe I'm accessing files locally.\n\n32\n00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.380\nWe gotta know the difference between all\nthese different things, specifically for\n\n33\n00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.220\nthe exam, but as you get into IT this\nis really some of our bread and butter.\n\n34\n00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.400\n>> It is.\nLike I said it's one of our primary\n\n35\n00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.420\nfunctions in IT is to, we talked about\nthe CIA triad in other episodes.\n\n36\n00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.012\nConfidentiality, integrity, availability.\n\n37\n00:01:39.012 --> 00:01:42.239\nIf permissions aren't set properly,\nthe availability could be too much.\n\n38\n00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:45.400\nIt could be too little, so we've got\nto understand the way these work.\n\n39\n00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.988\nSo the first thing I wanna to look\nat is just simply file permissions.\n\n40\n00:01:47.988 --> 00:01:53.360\nI'm gonna pop-up on my screen here and\ntake a look at a simple file.\n\n41\n00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.530\nSo I'm gonna navigate over here, and I'll\njust make a new file for this example.\n\n42\n00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.874\nSo I'll say New > Text Document, and\nI'll call it test cuz I'm so creative.\n\n43\n00:02:03.874 --> 00:02:07.024\nAnd I'm gonna right-click on it and\nchoose Properties.\n\n44\n00:02:07.024 --> 00:02:09.457\nAnd then I'm gonna go to the Security tab,\n\n45\n00:02:09.457 --> 00:02:12.914\nand this is where I can control\nmy file permissions, right?\n\n46\n00:02:12.914 --> 00:02:17.880\nOne of the big benefits of NTFS over say,\nan older file system like FAT32,\n\n47\n00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.632\nis this right here.\n\n48\n00:02:19.632 --> 00:02:23.610\nWith FAT32, we didn't have that\nfile allocation table file system.\n\n49\n00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.280\nWe didn't have the ability to set file and\nfolder level permissions.\n\n50\n00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.756\nNTFS gives us that, gives us the file and\nfolder level permissions.\n\n51\n00:02:31.756 --> 00:02:34.177\nSo let's just take a look,\nI wanna go through this,\n\n52\n00:02:34.177 --> 00:02:36.113\nwe're not gonna dive too deep into this.\n\n53\n00:02:36.113 --> 00:02:38.338\nBut we need to be familiar with\nthe different permissions that\n\n54\n00:02:38.338 --> 00:02:39.118\nare available here.\n\n55\n00:02:39.118 --> 00:02:42.059\nWhen we look at NTFS permissions for\na file,\n\n56\n00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:47.240\nwe've got read, write, read and\nexecute, modify, full control.\n\n57\n00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.460\nIf I look at a folder.\n\n58\n00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.030\nNow let me just make a new folder here.\n\n59\n00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.615\nI'll call it New Folder.\n\n60\n00:02:54.615 --> 00:02:55.690\n>> Also very creative.\n\n61\n00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.240\n>> [LAUGH] Okay, one more permission,\nknown as list folder contents.\n\n62\n00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.917\nRight?\nWe don't get that on a file because a file\n\n63\n00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:04.730\nis not a folder.\n\n64\n00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:05.760\nIt doesn't have contents.\n\n65\n00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.300\nOr it doesn't have,\nit's not a container object, right?\n\n66\n00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.530\nSo that's the only difference\nthere between a folder.\n\n67\n00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.780\nAnd I'll go back over to this file here,\npull up those permissions.\n\n68\n00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.910\nLet's take a look at what\npermissions I have available.\n\n69\n00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.149\nWhat can I assign to a user or to a group?\n\n70\n00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:22.493\nAnd I'll go ahead and\nclick edit, and click add, and\n\n71\n00:03:22.493 --> 00:03:25.773\nI'll find we'll use Daniel\nas our guinea pig here.\n\n72\n00:03:25.773 --> 00:03:27.531\nI'm gonna add Daniel Lowrie and\n\n73\n00:03:27.531 --> 00:03:31.510\nI need to figure out what\npermissions I want to assign him.\n\n74\n00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.280\nWell, I've got by default it's gonna\ngive me read, read and execute.\n\n75\n00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.113\nRead lets you read a file.\n\n76\n00:03:37.113 --> 00:03:41.145\nSo if you've got read permission,\nyou can double-click on that file, and\n\n77\n00:03:41.145 --> 00:03:43.166\nyou can see the contents of that file.\n\n78\n00:03:43.166 --> 00:03:46.124\nIf you have read and execute,\nthat means you can run it.\n\n79\n00:03:46.124 --> 00:03:49.129\nWhat if it was an executable or\na batch file or a script?\n\n80\n00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:52.751\nRead, I can't double-click on it and\nhave it run that script.\n\n81\n00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:56.930\nRead and execute gives me that ability,\nto run something.\n\n82\n00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.199\nWrite lets you make\nchanges to the document.\n\n83\n00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:04.086\nNow, not only can you open it up and\nread it, but you can add stuff to it.\n\n84\n00:04:04.086 --> 00:04:08.451\nYou could remove stuff from it and then\nyou could save it and you can close it.\n\n85\n00:04:08.451 --> 00:04:10.850\nYou can't delete the file itself.\n\n86\n00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.820\nBut you can open up the file and\n\n87\n00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.490\nchange the contents of the file\nwith write permission.\n\n88\n00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.267\nThen we've got Modify.\n\n89\n00:04:18.267 --> 00:04:22.780\nModify does give me the ability to\nactually delete the file itself so\n\n90\n00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.970\nit expands upon the write permission,\nright?\n\n91\n00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.610\nIt builds upon write.\n\n92\n00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.612\nWith Modify I can read it, I can write,\nin fact you'll see if I uncheck these and\n\n93\n00:04:32.612 --> 00:04:37.037\nI check Modify, notice it gives you read,\nwrite, read and execute.\n\n94\n00:04:37.037 --> 00:04:39.391\nSo this is building on those permissions.\n\n95\n00:04:39.391 --> 00:04:42.070\nIt's another layer of permissions\nthat you're gonna get.\n\n96\n00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.437\nIf I give you Modify, you can read\nthe file, you can write to the file.\n\n97\n00:04:45.437 --> 00:04:48.534\nNow you can also delete the file,\nall right?\n\n98\n00:04:48.534 --> 00:04:51.783\nFull control is another one that builds.\n\n99\n00:04:51.783 --> 00:04:57.515\nI uncheck everything and I give Daniel\nfull control, he gets everything else.\n\n100\n00:04:57.515 --> 00:04:59.040\nWith full control, you can do everything.\n\n101\n00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.880\nYou can read, you can write,\nyou can modify, delete the file, and\n\n102\n00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.070\nnow you can actually,\nchange the permissions themselves.\n\n103\n00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.460\nThat's what full control gives you.\n\n104\n00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.090\nThe ability to come in here and\n\n105\n00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.780\nmodify who else has whatever\npermissions over that object.\n\n106\n00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.906\n>> Basically the definition of\nself-explanatory on that one.\n\n107\n00:05:16.906 --> 00:05:17.730\n[LAUGH] Full control.\n\n108\n00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.290\n>> [LAUGH].\nExactly right.\n\n109\n00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.190\nAll right.\n\n110\n00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.730\nSo we'll assign.\n\n111\n00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.290\nI'll go ahead and click okay and we'll\nclick okay to assign those permissions.\n\n112\n00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:29.166\nSo those are my NTFS permissions or\nmy file level permissions.\n\n113\n00:05:29.166 --> 00:05:32.144\nI also have something known\nas share permissions.\n\n114\n00:05:32.144 --> 00:05:35.917\nShare permissions are when I wanna make\nsomething available to the network.\n\n115\n00:05:35.917 --> 00:05:39.251\nThis folder on my computer that\nI've got here, anybody that can\n\n116\n00:05:39.251 --> 00:05:42.845\nlog into this machine could potentially\nhave access to this folder.\n\n117\n00:05:42.845 --> 00:05:46.216\nSo if I went to the properties of this\nfolder, and I assign Daniel read and\n\n118\n00:05:46.216 --> 00:05:49.423\nwrite permission over this folder,\nhe could log on to this machine,\n\n119\n00:05:49.423 --> 00:05:50.716\nhe can read and write to it.\n\n120\n00:05:50.716 --> 00:05:54.137\nBut if he's sitting at his computer,\nhe can't reach out to my computer and\n\n121\n00:05:54.137 --> 00:05:56.020\nget access to this folder.\n\n122\n00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.990\nThat's when we need to share it out.\n\n123\n00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.110\nSharing makes it available to the network,\nand I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n124\n00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.220\npull up the properties here and\nI'm gonna go to the Sharing tab.\n\n125\n00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.000\nThere's a couple of different\nways I can share it, and\n\n126\n00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.320\nI'll show you the easy way for this one.\n\n127\n00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.626\nI'm gonna click share, and\ndecide who I wanna share it with.\n\n128\n00:06:15.626 --> 00:06:19.394\nAnd I'll find Daniel's account again.\n\n129\n00:06:19.394 --> 00:06:23.640\nAll right, and then I can either\ndo read or read and write.\n\n130\n00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.290\nSo these are the only two permissions I\nget when it comes to share permissions.\n\n131\n00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:28.850\nEither you can just read it.\n\n132\n00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.845\nOr you can read and write to it.\n\n133\n00:06:30.845 --> 00:06:33.269\nI'll go ahead and share that out.\n\n134\n00:06:33.269 --> 00:06:39.060\nAnd I'll click done and now Daniel can go\nacross the network and get to this folder.\n\n135\n00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.300\nAnd he'll have read and\nwrite share permission.\n\n136\n00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.570\nBut that might not be the permission\nthat he actually ends up with.\n\n137\n00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:46.672\nAnd let's talk about why.\n\n138\n00:06:46.672 --> 00:06:48.028\nI've got a drawing here.\n\n139\n00:06:48.028 --> 00:06:51.650\nWe've gotta understand when\npermissions are checked.\n\n140\n00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.297\nNTFS permissions are always checked.\n\n141\n00:06:54.297 --> 00:06:58.092\nAny time you go to a resource\nthat's on an NTFS formatted volume,\n\n142\n00:06:58.092 --> 00:07:00.920\nNTFS permissions are gonna be checked.\n\n143\n00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.259\nI don't I don't care if you're\naccessing it locally or\n\n144\n00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:05.319\nif you're going across\nthe network to get to it.\n\n145\n00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:07.435\nNTSF always checked.\n\n146\n00:07:07.435 --> 00:07:11.675\nShared permissions however, are only\nchecked when you go across the network.\n\n147\n00:07:11.675 --> 00:07:14.360\nRight?\nBecause you're accessing a share.\n\n148\n00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.960\nIf you come over to this\nmachine physically and\n\n149\n00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.550\nlog on, well you're not accessing it as\na share, you're accessing it locally.\n\n150\n00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:26.250\nOnly NTFS is gonna be checked, but\nif you go across the network to get to it,\n\n151\n00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:31.750\nwell now you're using a UNC path or\na map drive, you're accessing a share and\n\n152\n00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.390\nboth are going to be checked,\nboth NTFS and share permissions.\n\n153\n00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.780\n>> Now Mike, that begs the question\nof if we're always checking NTFS,\n\n154\n00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.890\nwhat's the point of having\nshare permissions at all?\n\n155\n00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:41.960\nJust check NTFS and be done with it.\n\n156\n00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.268\n>> You know, it might be going\naway actually Daniel [LAUGH].\n\n157\n00:07:44.268 --> 00:07:47.176\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's just something that is changing,\n\n158\n00:07:47.176 --> 00:07:51.872\nthe sharing is what makes it available,\nso we do need some way to decide, do we\n\n159\n00:07:51.872 --> 00:07:56.671\nwanna make it available to the network,\nor is it only if you have local access?\n\n160\n00:07:56.671 --> 00:07:57.646\nNow the permissions,\n\n161\n00:07:57.646 --> 00:08:00.900\nMicrosoft has actually changed\ntheir tune over the last few years.\n\n162\n00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:04.180\nBefore they would of said,\nprincipal of least privilege.\n\n163\n00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.500\nIf you want them to be able to read,\nyou're gonna give them NTFS read,\n\n164\n00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.620\nand you're gonna give them share read.\n\n165\n00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.700\nIn fact, let's stop there for\na second, cuz before before I\n\n166\n00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:18.060\nexplain the rest of that, we to understand\nthe way these permissions interact.\n\n167\n00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:23.880\nBecause I said both are going to be\nchecked, NTFS and shared permission.\n\n168\n00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.620\nWell, what if they're not the same?\n\n169\n00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:29.870\nWhat if you had NTFS full control,\nbut you only have share read?\n\n170\n00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:34.710\nYou go across the network to get to it,\nwhat do you get?\n\n171\n00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:37.440\nYou actually get the most\nrestrictive of the two.\n\n172\n00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.900\nWhichever one is going to\ngive you less permissions.\n\n173\n00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.510\nSo when you combine NTFS and\n\n174\n00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:46.550\nshare permissions,\nit's the most restrictive of the two.\n\n175\n00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:51.040\nSo let's say I give you NTFS full control.\n\n176\n00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.840\nLet's do that a little differently there.\n\n177\n00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:02.130\nLet's say we give you, NTFS, full control.\n\n178\n00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:08.420\nAll right, something happened to my full.\n\n179\n00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:08.980\nWe lost it.\n\n180\n00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.010\nThere we go.\n\n181\n00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:14.620\nAnd let's say I give\nyou share permissions.\n\n182\n00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.270\nI'll put that over here.\n\n183\n00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:21.730\nAs a share, I'm just going\nto give you read permission.\n\n184\n00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:24.950\nWow, I cannot type today, Daniel.\n\n185\n00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:26.702\n>> Is there Ronnie Juan school of typing.\n\n186\n00:09:26.702 --> 00:09:27.530\n[LAUGH]\n>> I know right?\n\n187\n00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:28.575\n>> Seeing you people fall today.\n\n188\n00:09:28.575 --> 00:09:30.740\n[LAUGH]\n>> I have a little of NTFS\n\n189\n00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:35.310\nfull control and you have share read.\n\n190\n00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.310\nWell, think about what I just said.\n\n191\n00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:41.080\nIf you access it locally,\nonly NTFS permissions are checked.\n\n192\n00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.240\nYou get full control.\n\n193\n00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.960\nIf you go across the network,\nboth are gonna be checked.\n\n194\n00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.660\nWhich one is more restrictive?\n\n195\n00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:54.240\nRead, so that's all you're gonna get,\nread permission, all right.\n\n196\n00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.280\nAnd that's the way they combine.\n\n197\n00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.730\nThat's the important thing to get\nout of this, not my typing skills.\n\n198\n00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:02.680\nIs, it's the most restrictive of the two,\nwhen they are combined.\n\n199\n00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.650\nNow, what Microsoft is\nrecommending at this point though,\n\n200\n00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:08.640\nis that we give share\neveryone full control.\n\n201\n00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.312\nAnd just use your NTFS.\n\n202\n00:10:11.312 --> 00:10:13.169\nBecause NTFS is always checked.\n\n203\n00:10:13.169 --> 00:10:17.837\nSo if you only have NTFS read and you have\nshare full control or share read write,\n\n204\n00:10:17.837 --> 00:10:23.480\nyou're still only gonna get read, because\nthat's the most restrictive of the two.\n\n205\n00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.910\nSo by giving everybody full\ncontrol share permissions,\n\n206\n00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:29.330\nI can eliminate those\nas a source of trouble.\n\n207\n00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.160\nIf Daniel calls me up and says hey, I'm\nhaving trouble I'm supposed to be able to\n\n208\n00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.180\nwrite to this folder, but I can only read.\n\n209\n00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.420\nWell, now I've gotta go troubleshoot.\n\n210\n00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.320\nWhy doesn't Daniel have those permissions?\n\n211\n00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.640\nWhich permissions do I troubleshoot?\n\n212\n00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.100\nShare NTFS, he's going across the network.\n\n213\n00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.770\nI gotta troubleshoot both.\n\n214\n00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:46.170\nIf I gave him, everyone full control, so\n\n215\n00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:49.890\nhe has full control share, I don't have\nto worry about troubleshooting that.\n\n216\n00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:52.280\nThe problem must lie in\nthe NTFS permissions.\n\n217\n00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.450\nSo old school guys and\ngirls, you'll be with me.\n\n218\n00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:57.520\nI hate doing that.\n\n219\n00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.870\nI can't stand giving\neveryone full control.\n\n220\n00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:03.515\nBut it does seem to be\nthe way things are headed.\n\n221\n00:11:03.515 --> 00:11:05.365\nSo, those are important\nthings to understand.\n\n222\n00:11:05.365 --> 00:11:07.675\nNTFS permissions, what permissions we get.\n\n223\n00:11:07.675 --> 00:11:11.045\nThat they're a part of the NTFS file\nsystem, they're always checked.\n\n224\n00:11:11.045 --> 00:11:14.780\nShared permissions, that's how we\nmake things available to the network.\n\n225\n00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:18.550\nThey're only checked when you go across\nthe network to get to the resource,\n\n226\n00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:21.710\nwhen you combine the two,\nbecause NTFS is always checked,\n\n227\n00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.590\nwhen you combine the two it's\nthe most restrictive of the two.\n\n228\n00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:25.780\n>> But wait, there's more.\n\n229\n00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:27.480\nRight Mike?\nIf you act now you'll\n\n230\n00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.880\nget to set permissions on\nyour registry as well.\n\n231\n00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.550\nNow Mike and I were actually kind\nof joking about this before.\n\n232\n00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:35.120\nI was like, when have you ever\nset permissions on the registry?\n\n233\n00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.990\nNever, I've never done it.\n\n234\n00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:41.120\nBut, maybe it is an area which\nare completely under-utilizing\n\n235\n00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.540\nbecause you can do it.\n\n236\n00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.330\nAnd, actually, it might even save you,\nknow that I am thinking about it,\n\n237\n00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.136\nit might be a good idea.\n\n238\n00:11:46.136 --> 00:11:47.290\n[LAUGH]\n>> You know, when somebody for\n\n239\n00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:51.550\nsome reason needs to write to the registry\nor make changes to it, then we can do it.\n\n240\n00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:52.480\n>> All right, let's just see how.\n\n241\n00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:59.037\nI am going to open up Regedit, and I can\nnavigate into anyone of my keys here,\n\n242\n00:11:59.037 --> 00:12:04.050\nI could right-click on that guy and\nchoose permissions.\n\n243\n00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:07.690\nAnd same thing as what I was looking\nat with NTFS, not the same permissions.\n\n244\n00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:11.600\nBut I get full control, and read,\nand then my special permissions.\n\n245\n00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.150\nFull control would give them read, write,\n\n246\n00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:16.270\nthe ability to delete,\nmodify, all of that, right?\n\n247\n00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:18.000\nRead is what they get by default.\n\n248\n00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.540\nLike if we look at system,\nyou get full control.\n\n249\n00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.340\nAdministrator gets full control there.\n\n250\n00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:27.640\nAnybody in the administrators\ngroup gets full control.\n\n251\n00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:32.270\nSo if you ever need to adjust permissions\nin the registry, this is how you do it.\n\n252\n00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:33.920\nYou go into your registry editor,\n\n253\n00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.190\nyou right click on the key you need\nto modify the permissions for,\n\n254\n00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:41.630\nyou choose Permissions, and you work\nit like any other access control list.\n\n255\n00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:44.990\n>> Now, Mike,\nI'm guessing because the registry can\n\n256\n00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:49.550\ncompletely hose your system if you do it\nwrongly, is why they're suggesting, or\n\n257\n00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:52.850\nat least give you the option to go in and\nset permissions on that.\n\n258\n00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:57.250\nIf I can't hose the registry up and make\nmy computer stop working because I don't\n\n259\n00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:00.390\nhave permissions to it, well then that's\neffectively stopped that from happening.\n\n260\n00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:02.340\n>> Yeah, you've gotta think\nabout driver installation.\n\n261\n00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.060\nWhy can't a standard\nuser install a driver?\n\n262\n00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.600\nBecause it has to write\ninformation to the registry and\n\n263\n00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.050\nstandard users don't have write\npermission in the registry.\n\n264\n00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:16.360\nI don't know why I would ever want to give\nthem that but maybe we've got a reason to.\n\n265\n00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.900\nSo, at least we know that we can\ncontrol permissions in the registry.\n\n266\n00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:24.103\nAnother place, Daniel, we can work\nwith permissions is active directory.\n\n267\n00:13:24.103 --> 00:13:28.263\nIf I go over to my domain controller here\nand open up active directory users and\n\n268\n00:13:28.263 --> 00:13:31.911\ncomputers, this is where all my\naccounts are stored for my domain,\n\n269\n00:13:31.911 --> 00:13:36.263\nmy computer accounts, my user accounts,\nmy groups, some of the group policies\n\n270\n00:13:36.263 --> 00:13:39.840\nare stored in here, old news,\nall kinds of stuff in here.\n\n271\n00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:44.820\nAnd, I can assign permissions in here\nas well, they're a little bit different\n\n272\n00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:49.510\nthan NTFS permissions, if I pull up\nthe properties for Daniel's account, and\n\n273\n00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:53.645\nI take a look at my permissions to see\nthat I don't have a permissions tab.\n\n274\n00:13:53.645 --> 00:13:56.070\nIts not there, there's no security tab.\n\n275\n00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:57.060\nSo I'm going to cancel that.\n\n276\n00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.140\nIf you want to work with\npermissions in active directory,\n\n277\n00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.060\nyou have to turn on\nyour advanced features.\n\n278\n00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:07.160\nOnce I click that, and\nI go back down to to your\n\n279\n00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:12.680\nemployees and hosts, and\nfind Daniel again, and pull up properties.\n\n280\n00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.900\nNow I should have a security tab and\nthere's my access control list.\n\n281\n00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.800\nBut notice the permissions\nare completely different.\n\n282\n00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:20.890\nAnd there's a lot of them.\n\n283\n00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:23.920\nThat's a really cool thing\nabout active directory.\n\n284\n00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.070\nI can be very specific with permissions.\n\n285\n00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:29.590\nLike I want my help desk to be able to\nreset passwords, because it happens all\n\n286\n00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:32.460\nthe time, users forget their password,\nthey lock their account.\n\n287\n00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.510\nThey need to be able to\nreset those passwords.\n\n288\n00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.450\nBut if I give them, what am I gonna do,\n\n289\n00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:38.410\ngive them full control\nover the user account?\n\n290\n00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:42.280\nAnd then what if they got mad at that\nperson and wanted to delete their account?\n\n291\n00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.710\nThey could do that, right?\n\n292\n00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:45.570\nSo when it comes to Active Directory,\n\n293\n00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:49.060\nwe can assign permissions over individual\nattributes, like phone number.\n\n294\n00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:52.310\nI can let you modify the phone number,\nbut not the fax number.\n\n295\n00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:56.230\nWe can get very granular in here.\n\n296\n00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.940\nWe can also delegate permissions.\n\n297\n00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.770\nFor example, let's say I've got a group,\nlet's make a group.\n\n298\n00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:04.260\nLet's create a group called help desk.\n\n299\n00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:11.310\nAll right, and I want the help desk to to\nbe able to reset passwords for my hosts.\n\n300\n00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:15.440\nWell, I can right click on this host OU\nbecause that's where my accounts are.\n\n301\n00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.870\nAnd I can choose delegate control.\n\n302\n00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.220\nLaunches a wizard, I'll click next.\n\n303\n00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:21.890\nSays who do you want to delegate to?\n\n304\n00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:24.490\nWell, I want to give the help\ndesk some permissions.\n\n305\n00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:29.560\nSo I find my help desk group,\nand I click okay, and next.\n\n306\n00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.570\nAnd it says well what do you\nwant to give to the help desk?\n\n307\n00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:35.600\nThe ability to reset user passwords.\n\n308\n00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.230\nAnd i'll click next and finish.\n\n309\n00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:41.000\nAnd it's that easy,\nI just delegated permissions.\n\n310\n00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.259\nIf we go take a look at the properties\nof this and I go to my security tab,\n\n311\n00:15:45.259 --> 00:15:50.263\nI'll see help desk listed in there,\nbecause I just delegated them permissions.\n\n312\n00:15:50.263 --> 00:15:53.208\nI did it through a wizard instead\nof doing it manually here.\n\n313\n00:15:53.208 --> 00:15:56.376\nNotice it gave them special permissions,\nI don't even know what those are.\n\n314\n00:15:56.376 --> 00:15:58.392\nI'd have to click advanced, and\n\n315\n00:15:58.392 --> 00:16:02.640\nthen come find those help desk\nspecial permissions, and click edit.\n\n316\n00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:07.700\nAnd I can see, oh, it was the reset\npassword option that was given them.\n\n317\n00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.290\nNow they have allow reset passwords.\n\n318\n00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:13.780\nSo very easy to delegate permissions\nwithin Active Directory.\n\n319\n00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:18.430\nAnd a really cool thing about it is,\none that was easy, two it's very specific.\n\n320\n00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:21.640\nAnybody in the help desk can\nnow reset host passwords,\n\n321\n00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:25.680\nbecause I right-clicked on hosts and\nran that delegation wizard.\n\n322\n00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:29.710\nIf we look at the development OU,\nwe're not gonna see those permissions.\n\n323\n00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:34.460\nThere's no help desk listed here\nbecause it's very specific.\n\n324\n00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:39.200\nI right-clicked on host, and\nshows delegate permissions, all right?\n\n325\n00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.100\nAnd this is an important thing.\n\n326\n00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:45.090\nI need my help desk to be able to reset\nthe passwords for all my users, but\n\n327\n00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:46.880\nnot my CEOs, right?\n\n328\n00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.030\nNot my C level, not my executives.\n\n329\n00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:52.850\nBecause they could reset that person's\npassword to something they know, and\n\n330\n00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:54.600\nthen log in as them, and\n\n331\n00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:58.060\nthen gain access to things they\nwould never normally have access to.\n\n332\n00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:00.940\nSo when you use that delegation\nto delegate permissions within\n\n333\n00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:04.820\nActive Directory, it's very specific\nwhat you're delegating over.\n\n334\n00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:06.032\nVery, very cool little wizard.\n\n335\n00:17:06.032 --> 00:17:09.200\nAll right, another thing, Daniel,\n\n336\n00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.900\nwe talked about the difference\nbetween FAT and NTFS.\n\n337\n00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:16.190\nAnother thing we got to\nthink about is inheritance.\n\n338\n00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:19.932\nAnd inheritance is a really cool\nfeature of NTFS permissions.\n\n339\n00:17:19.932 --> 00:17:23.474\nIt makes it so\nmuch easier to assign permissions.\n\n340\n00:17:23.474 --> 00:17:28.400\nImagine having, I don't know,\n500 documents, right?\n\n341\n00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:32.829\nAnd you need to give the sales people\nread write permissions over all those\n\n342\n00:17:32.829 --> 00:17:34.350\ndocuments.\n\n343\n00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:37.260\nWell, you could double-click or\nright-click on each one of those documents\n\n344\n00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:41.700\none at a time and you could assign\npermissions to that sales group.\n\n345\n00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.660\nNo, it's not gonna happen, right?\n\n346\n00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:44.920\nNot very efficient.\n\n347\n00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:48.190\nWhat I could do is put all those\ndocuments in a folder, and\n\n348\n00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:50.690\nthen assign the permissions to the folder,\nand\n\n349\n00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:54.180\nlet those permissions inherit\nto the objects inside there.\n\n350\n00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:58.120\nFor example,\nlet's go back over to my client here, and\n\n351\n00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:03.590\nI've got a folder called,\nI thought I had a folder.\n\n352\n00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:05.500\nI lied, you guys, on the C drive.\n\n353\n00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:06.968\n>> I can no longer trust you.\n\n354\n00:18:06.968 --> 00:18:09.102\n[LAUGH]\n>> I've got a folder called data,\n\n355\n00:18:09.102 --> 00:18:13.260\nall right, and data, I want to assign,\nthere's objects inside there,\n\n356\n00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.770\nthere's a couple folders.\n\n357\n00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:17.810\nI want to give that\nsales group permissions,\n\n358\n00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:20.610\nread write permissions\nover the sales folder.\n\n359\n00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:24.560\nBut there's hundreds\nof documents in there.\n\n360\n00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:25.570\nI'm lying to you again.\n\n361\n00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:26.330\nThere's only one.\n\n362\n00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.240\nBut, let's pretend that there's\nhundreds of documents in there.\n\n363\n00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.020\nWell, what I can do is I\ncan go to the data folder.\n\n364\n00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.090\nActually, you know what,\nlet's prove it first.\n\n365\n00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:36.300\nIf I go to the Sales folder,\npull up Properties,\n\n366\n00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:40.730\nand go to Security,\nnotice sales is not in this list.\n\n367\n00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:45.480\nSo I'm gonna cancel that,\ngo back out to this top level, and\n\n368\n00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.450\nI'm gonna go to the properties.\n\n369\n00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:51.210\nAnd I'm going to go to security, and\nI'm going to assign the sales group.\n\n370\n00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:56.780\nI'm going to give sales read and\n\n371\n00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:02.000\nwrite permission, and\nclick okay, and click okay.\n\n372\n00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.360\nNow I did that on\nthe property of this folder.\n\n373\n00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.540\nIf I go inside that folder,\nand inside this folder, and\n\n374\n00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:12.580\nall the way down to this document,\nand I go to Properties, and Security.\n\n375\n00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:15.790\nAnd look, there's Sales, and\nthey've got read write permission.\n\n376\n00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:19.570\nSo again, imagine there being hundreds or\nthousands of resources in there.\n\n377\n00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:21.610\nI assign the permission once.\n\n378\n00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:26.290\nNTFS inheritance took care of making sure\nthose permissions were propagated down\n\n379\n00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:29.320\nto all the child objects\nwithin that folder.\n\n380\n00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.950\nThat's what we mean by NTFS inheritance.\n\n381\n00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:34.625\n>> Trickle down permissions, right Mike?\n\n382\n00:19:34.625 --> 00:19:35.830\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly.\n\n383\n00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:39.720\nAnd it's a great thing,\nbut not always, right?\n\n384\n00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.800\nWhat about this marketing folder?\n\n385\n00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.060\nWell, if I take a look at\nthis marketing folder.\n\n386\n00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:46.770\nOr in fact, let's do this.\n\n387\n00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:48.974\nLet's make a new document\ninside marketing.\n\n388\n00:19:48.974 --> 00:19:54.104\nSay, new text document,\nand we'll call it ad.\n\n389\n00:19:54.104 --> 00:19:57.160\nThey're working on some new ad for\nus in marketing.\n\n390\n00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.880\nI look at the properties for\nthis document,\n\n391\n00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:03.970\ngo to security, sales,\nhas read and write permission.\n\n392\n00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:05.710\nAgain, inheritance is doing its thing.\n\n393\n00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:08.075\nIt's inheriting that permission\nto all the child objects.\n\n394\n00:20:08.075 --> 00:20:09.100\nAs Daniel said, that trickled down there.\n\n395\n00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.880\nBut I don't want that to happen.\n\n396\n00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.720\nThis is the marketing folder.\n\n397\n00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.450\nSales shouldn't have those permissions.\n\n398\n00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:17.770\nWell if I was smarter,\nI would have assigned the permission for\n\n399\n00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:20.470\nsales here instead of data, right?\n\n400\n00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:22.641\nBut let's say for\nsome reason I couldn't have done that.\n\n401\n00:20:22.641 --> 00:20:28.073\nI can go to marketing, pull up\nthe properties, go to that security tab,\n\n402\n00:20:28.073 --> 00:20:32.910\nand I can click advanced,\nand change permissions.\n\n403\n00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:36.030\nAnd then I can say, you know what,\ndon't include inheritable permissions.\n\n404\n00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:39.750\nI want you to stop inheriting\nstuff from the parent object.\n\n405\n00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:41.710\nNow when I do that,\nI can choose add or remove.\n\n406\n00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:43.255\nI'm gonna click add.\n\n407\n00:20:43.255 --> 00:20:44.922\nRemove wipes the slate and\n\n408\n00:20:44.922 --> 00:20:49.098\nstarts you with a clean access\ncontrol list where you can choose.\n\n409\n00:20:49.098 --> 00:20:51.700\nYou might have other things that\nyou don't want to wipe out.\n\n410\n00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.720\nSo I like to choose add.\n\n411\n00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:57.230\nThat leaves everything there, but\nnow I can take that sales group and\n\n412\n00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:03.710\nI can choose remove, and I can click OK,\nand OK, and OK to apply those changes.\n\n413\n00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:06.040\nNow if I go in to marketing and\nlook at this document here.\n\n414\n00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:08.730\nGo to security.\n\n415\n00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:10.990\nSales no longer has permission.\n\n416\n00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:13.460\nSo you can block inheritance,\ninheritance is great,\n\n417\n00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:17.240\nit makes our job a whole lot easier,\nand assign that permission once.\n\n418\n00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.620\nSometimes I don't want it to inherit.\n\n419\n00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.170\nWindows gives us the ability\nto stop that and\n\n420\n00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:24.980\ncontrol the behavior of that inheritance.\n\n421\n00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:27.590\nAnd you saw, relatively easy to do.\n\n422\n00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.470\nAll right, Daniel, where are we at?\n\n423\n00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:32.220\nLet's see.\n\n424\n00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:36.400\nLet's talk about moving files and\nfolders, and copying files and folders.\n\n425\n00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.860\n>> Yeah, that's a really good topic.\n\n426\n00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:39.790\nI mean,\nwe're talking about inheritance here.\n\n427\n00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:43.330\nI create a file or folder and\nit's got the permission set on it.\n\n428\n00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:47.350\nAnd then I move that into a different\narea, and there's different permissions.\n\n429\n00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:49.010\nDo I inherit those permissions?\n\n430\n00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:51.150\nDoes it keep the permissions\nthat are already on it?\n\n431\n00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:51.730\nWho knows?\n\n432\n00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:52.675\nMichael, I think you do.\n\n433\n00:21:52.675 --> 00:21:54.290\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Hopefully!\n\n434\n00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:55.992\n>> That's part of the show, hopefully.\n\n435\n00:21:55.992 --> 00:21:57.980\n>> Oh gosh,\nlet me look that up right quick.\n\n436\n00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:00.120\n>> Aw, that's a great question guys.\n\n437\n00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.190\n>> I do, and\n\n438\n00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:06.900\nI've got a little demo that will hopefully\nhelp explain it to you guys out there.\n\n439\n00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.760\nSo I've got a few different files and\nwhat Daniel's referring, you know when we\n\n440\n00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:15.040\nlook at the permissions, when we assign\npermissions to say, a document, right?\n\n441\n00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:19.075\nAnd when we move that document, or\nwe copy that document, what happens, and\n\n442\n00:22:19.075 --> 00:22:22.245\nwe're really talking about\nexplicit permissions here.\n\n443\n00:22:22.245 --> 00:22:25.395\nLet's clarify that,\nexplicit versus inherited.\n\n444\n00:22:25.395 --> 00:22:30.905\nWhen I went to that folder, where did\nI do that, went to data and I assigned\n\n445\n00:22:30.905 --> 00:22:36.430\nthat permission, so we'll go back over to\nsecurity, and we'll take a look at sales.\n\n446\n00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:38.270\nNotice those check marks are black.\n\n447\n00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:39.650\nThose are explicit permissions.\n\n448\n00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:43.330\nI went to that object,\nI opened up the security tab, and\n\n449\n00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:47.450\nI set the permissions on that object,\nall right?\n\n450\n00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:51.370\nBut when I go inside there, and\nI look at the properties of this folder,\n\n451\n00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:56.630\nsales is there, but\nnotice the checkmarks are gray.\n\n452\n00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:58.000\nThose are inherited permissions.\n\n453\n00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.600\nI didn't open this access control list and\nadd the permissions.\n\n454\n00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.620\nI did it to that parent folder, right?\n\n455\n00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:06.970\nSo I explicitly assigned the permissions\non that parent object, and\n\n456\n00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:09.600\nthey were inherited down\nall the child objects, so\n\n457\n00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.430\nthese are inherited permissions and\nthey're gray.\n\n458\n00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:17.280\nSo, the question is, when I explicitly\nassign a permission to a resource, and\n\n459\n00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.830\nthen I move that resource or\n\n460\n00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:22.540\ncopy that resource, what happens\nto those explicit permissions?\n\n461\n00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.080\nInheritance is always gonna work\nunless you've blocked it, so\n\n462\n00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.600\nif I move it somewhere.\n\n463\n00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.080\nWell let's go to inherit permissions\nof wherever I've moved it, right?\n\n464\n00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.640\nThat's a normal NTFS thing.\n\n465\n00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:32.900\nThe question is,\n\n466\n00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.680\nwhat about the explicit permissions\nthat I've signed in the object?\n\n467\n00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.910\nDo they go with it or\ndo they get lost in the transfer?\n\n468\n00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:42.600\nAnd that's what we're here to find out,\nor that's what we want to see.\n\n469\n00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.850\nSo I've got,\nthere's really four things you could do,\n\n470\n00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:49.080\nyou could copy something to somewhere\nelse on the same partition,\n\n471\n00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.120\nyou can copy something to\na different partition, right?\n\n472\n00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.750\nC: to D:.\n\n473\n00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:56.346\nYou can move something\non the same partition.\n\n474\n00:23:56.346 --> 00:23:59.013\nYou can move something to\na different partition.\n\n475\n00:23:59.013 --> 00:24:00.513\nC: to D:.\n\n476\n00:24:00.513 --> 00:24:03.117\nAnd we need to understand what\nhappens with all of those.\n\n477\n00:24:03.117 --> 00:24:06.977\nAnd I will tell you that most books you\nread make this incredibly complex and\n\n478\n00:24:06.977 --> 00:24:08.762\nthey draw these big diagrams out.\n\n479\n00:24:08.762 --> 00:24:10.774\nAnd I've even got one of\nthose diagrams just so\n\n480\n00:24:10.774 --> 00:24:12.860\nI can be like all those other people.\n\n481\n00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:16.800\nBut in the end,\nthere's one thing you have to remember.\n\n482\n00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.331\nWhen you move something\non the same partition,\n\n483\n00:24:20.331 --> 00:24:23.610\nit's gonna retain explicit permissions.\n\n484\n00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.790\nAnything else you do,\ncopy it to the same partition,\n\n485\n00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:31.520\nmove it to a different partition,\nmove/copy it to a different partition,\n\n486\n00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.390\nit's gonna inherit the permissions\nof the destination.\n\n487\n00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:38.820\nIn fact, let's see if I can show\nyou that in visual form as well.\n\n488\n00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:41.475\nWe'll just choose this guy here.\n\n489\n00:24:41.475 --> 00:24:44.650\nAnd we'll turn off that silly\ngrid they like to put on there.\n\n490\n00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:48.980\nSo if you copy something, this is supposed\nto be a hard drive right, or one volume.\n\n491\n00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.540\nIf you copy something\nwithin the same volume,\n\n492\n00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:54.590\nit's gonna inherit the permissions\nfrom its destination.\n\n493\n00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:56.511\nExplicit permissions are gonna be lost.\n\n494\n00:24:56.511 --> 00:24:58.430\nIf you move something within a volume,\n\n495\n00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:01.550\nit's gonna retain those\nexplicit permissions.\n\n496\n00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:06.450\nIf you copy it or move it across\npartition boundaries, it's gonna lose its\n\n497\n00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:11.420\nexplicit permissions and inherit any\npermissions from that destination.\n\n498\n00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:14.800\nAnd there's really a simple\nexplanation for this.\n\n499\n00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.230\nIt's the process that's\ngoing on in the background.\n\n500\n00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:20.120\nIf you copy something,\nwell the original is still there.\n\n501\n00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:23.145\nLet's say that's where, we're gonna say\nthat's where I assigned the explicit\n\n502\n00:25:23.145 --> 00:25:24.540\npermissions.\n\n503\n00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:26.570\nThe copy is a separate object.\n\n504\n00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:30.000\nI never assigned explicit permissions\non that separate object, so\n\n505\n00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.430\nit makes sense that I would lose\nany explicit permissions, right.\n\n506\n00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:38.740\nIf I jump down to this one,\nif I copy it across drives, well again,\n\n507\n00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:42.800\nthis is the original object over here\nthat has the explicit permissions.\n\n508\n00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.720\nThis is a copy of the original,\nit's a new object.\n\n509\n00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:48.140\nIt's going to inherit permissions\nfrom wherever we paste it to.\n\n510\n00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:51.150\nThe explicit permissions\nare gonna be lost.\n\n511\n00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:55.950\nIf I move it across volumes,\nit's actually a cut and paste.\n\n512\n00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:58.590\nIt's actually a copy and delete, right?\n\n513\n00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:01.640\nIf you move it you're\ngonna copy the original,\n\n514\n00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:05.280\ndelete the original,\npaste the copy over here.\n\n515\n00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.940\nIt's a new object,\ntherefore explicit permissions are gone.\n\n516\n00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:12.170\nIf you move it within the same volume,\n\n517\n00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.530\nthe object actually doesn't go anywhere,\nright?\n\n518\n00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:18.650\nIf you understand the way file systems\nwork, there's a pointer to that object.\n\n519\n00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:19.720\nWhen you click on it,\n\n520\n00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:24.340\nthe operating system can find that object\non the hard drive from that pointer.\n\n521\n00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:27.800\nWell, if I move it,\nall it does is adjust the pointer, says,\n\n522\n00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:30.510\noh, you're no longer located there,\nyou're now located here.\n\n523\n00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:31.930\nI'll just change the pointer.\n\n524\n00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:35.420\nThe object itself never got\nphysically moved on the hard drive.\n\n525\n00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:39.030\nIt's still residing on the same\nbits on the hard drive that it was\n\n526\n00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:40.350\nbefore you moved it.\n\n527\n00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:45.170\nSo since it's the same object, those\nexplicit permissions will still be there.\n\n528\n00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.250\nSo let's see,\nwe can do a quick demo of that,\n\n529\n00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:53.500\nI wont go through all of them, I'll\njust go through a couple of them here.\n\n530\n00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.960\nSo I've got, let's see,\nif we take this one and\n\n531\n00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.470\nwe explicitly assign a permission to it.\n\n532\n00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:05.010\nSo I'll go Properties > Security >\nEdit > Add and I'll find Daniel.\n\n533\n00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:10.089\nAnd I'll go ahead and\nexplicitly assign Daniel full control.\n\n534\n00:27:10.089 --> 00:27:13.710\nSo those are gray check mark,\noh I mean sorry, black check marks, right.\n\n535\n00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:16.536\nIf I click OK and we go find Daniel,\n\n536\n00:27:16.536 --> 00:27:21.123\nthose are explicit permissions\nassigned to copy same.\n\n537\n00:27:21.123 --> 00:27:26.505\nI'm gonna right-click on it and\nchoose Copy.\n\n538\n00:27:26.505 --> 00:27:28.593\nAnd I'm gonna paste it to the same volume.\n\n539\n00:27:30.874 --> 00:27:37.360\nIf I take a look at those permissions,\nNotice Daniel's not there.\n\n540\n00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.820\nMy explicit permissions are gone,\nall right?\n\n541\n00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:45.580\nIf I try the same with the Move operation,\nso here's my file and\n\n542\n00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:50.590\nI'm going to go to Properties >\nSecurity > Edit, and Add Daniel again.\n\n543\n00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:53.715\nAnd I'm gonna give Daniel full control.\n\n544\n00:27:53.715 --> 00:27:58.670\nSo those are explicit permissions,\nI can see they're black check marks there.\n\n545\n00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:02.830\nAnd now I'm gonna move it.\n\n546\n00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:07.760\nAll right, actually let's just drag and\ndrop this guy.\n\n547\n00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:12.390\nI'm gonna move it to this data folder,\nall right.\n\n548\n00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:15.905\nSo it's gone, it should now be in data,\nright, there it is.\n\n549\n00:28:15.905 --> 00:28:21.345\nI pull up the Properties,\ngo to Security, notice Daniel and\n\n550\n00:28:21.345 --> 00:28:25.304\nhis explicit permissions are still there.\n\n551\n00:28:25.304 --> 00:28:28.210\nNow, the other two at this point,\nhopefully you trust me.\n\n552\n00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:31.755\nIf we wanna take a peek at it though,\ncopy to a different, right-click Copy.\n\n553\n00:28:31.755 --> 00:28:33.466\nOh, I didn't assign the permissions.\n\n554\n00:28:33.466 --> 00:28:38.094\nWe'll go Properties > Security > Edit,\nand Daniel-san.\n\n555\n00:28:40.221 --> 00:28:44.137\nAnd we'll give him full control\nexplicit permissions over that object.\n\n556\n00:28:44.137 --> 00:28:45.509\nVerify that.\n\n557\n00:28:47.342 --> 00:28:48.831\nThere we go, they are black.\n\n558\n00:28:48.831 --> 00:28:52.847\nIf I copy this to a different partition,\n\n559\n00:28:57.216 --> 00:28:59.719\nI'll take a look at those permissions.\n\n560\n00:28:59.719 --> 00:29:01.334\nIf I can right-click successfully.\n\n561\n00:29:03.381 --> 00:29:05.900\nAnd notice Daniel is gone.\n\n562\n00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:09.330\nI go back over here and\nI take the move to a different partition.\n\n563\n00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:13.720\nI'll first explicitly\nassign those permissions.\n\n564\n00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:14.799\nSo we'll find Daniel again.\n\n565\n00:29:17.998 --> 00:29:21.450\nAnd we'll give him explicit full control.\n\n566\n00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:25.870\nVerify, they are black check marks.\n\n567\n00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:27.700\nAnd now I'm gonna move it\nto a different partition.\n\n568\n00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:30.255\nAll right, and oops,\nlet me do that a little different.\n\n569\n00:29:30.255 --> 00:29:36.130\nI'm gonna have to right-click and\ndrag, how can I do that here?\n\n570\n00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:38.962\nWe'll do a cut, that's a move right?\n\n571\n00:29:38.962 --> 00:29:44.094\nI'll delete and we'll cut and we'll paste\nit, which is the same thing as move.\n\n572\n00:29:44.094 --> 00:29:48.003\nAnd if we pull up\nthe properties of that guy,\n\n573\n00:29:48.003 --> 00:29:52.205\ngo Security, you'll see Daniel is gone.\n\n574\n00:29:52.205 --> 00:29:53.995\nSo again, if we go back to that drawing,\n\n575\n00:29:53.995 --> 00:29:58.015\nthe only one you really have\nto remember is this one.\n\n576\n00:29:58.015 --> 00:30:02.300\nSo no matter how complex all of that\nthat I just did was, just remember,\n\n577\n00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:06.260\nif you move it within a volume,\nit retains explicit permissions.\n\n578\n00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:10.490\nAnything else you do with,\nit's gonna lose the explicit permissions.\n\n579\n00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:15.030\nAnd that's what happens when you move\nfiles and folders and copy files and\n\n580\n00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:18.550\nfolders within and\nbetween different partitions.\n\n581\n00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:19.849\n>> Mystery solved, yes?\n\n582\n00:30:19.849 --> 00:30:21.830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We now know what to do.\n\n583\n00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:25.430\nNow, Mike, you got any other cool tricks\nin your bag of tricks over there for\n\n584\n00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:26.900\nsecurity and permissions?\n\n585\n00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:32.930\n>> I think the only thing we forgot or\ndidn't get to was taking ownership.\n\n586\n00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:37.191\nAnd rather than, and it's not really\nanything exciting to see, but\n\n587\n00:30:37.191 --> 00:30:41.161\njust understand that the owner of\nan object is a special person,\n\n588\n00:30:41.161 --> 00:30:43.090\nyou're special, all right?\n\n589\n00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:46.817\nIf you create something, you are\nconsidered the owner of that object, so\n\n590\n00:30:46.817 --> 00:30:50.380\nthose files that I created, right,\nI'm the owner of those objects.\n\n591\n00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:54.820\nWhich means I have full\ncontrol because I created it.\n\n592\n00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:56.050\nI'm the creator owner.\n\n593\n00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:59.350\nIn fact we can look, I'll show you,\nif we take a look here.\n\n594\n00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:07.770\nLet me go over to one of these guys, pull\nup those Properties and go to Security.\n\n595\n00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:11.811\nOh, and I'm logged on as an administrator\nso we're not really gonna see it there,\n\n596\n00:31:11.811 --> 00:31:13.383\nbut maybe if I go into Advanced.\n\n597\n00:31:13.383 --> 00:31:16.030\nYou're not gonna see it there either.\n\n598\n00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:19.020\nBut the creator owner gets full control,\nand\n\n599\n00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:21.400\nsometimes this can cause\na problem in an environment.\n\n600\n00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:26.540\nLet's say that I assign Daniel the job\nof creating a master phone list for\n\n601\n00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:27.520\nthe company.\n\n602\n00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:31.240\nSo Daniel does his job, he gets out his\nExcel spreadsheet or whatever he decides\n\n603\n00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:35.420\nto use, and creates this master phone\nlist, and puts it up on the network share.\n\n604\n00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:39.900\nWell now he's the creator\nowner of that file.\n\n605\n00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:41.490\nMeans he has full control.\n\n606\n00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:45.760\nFull control can change permissions on it,\nand delete the object.\n\n607\n00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:49.470\nAnd so if Daniel got mad, and\nsaid you know what, that Mike guy,\n\n608\n00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:51.140\nhe just drives me crazy.\n\n609\n00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:53.540\nI'm gonna take away his\npermissions on this phone list.\n\n610\n00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:55.820\nNow all of a sudden I can't\nget access to that phone list,\n\n611\n00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:59.470\nall because Daniel got mad cuz I\nparked in his parking spot, right?\n\n612\n00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:01.610\nAnd he really gets upset about that.\n\n613\n00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:04.260\nSo the creator can change\nthose permissions.\n\n614\n00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:05.810\nAnd it shouldn't be up to Daniel, right?\n\n615\n00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:09.042\nDaniel's not the boss, Daniel was just\ntasked with that responsibility of\n\n616\n00:32:09.042 --> 00:32:11.400\ncreating that document in the first place.\n\n617\n00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:15.060\nSo we can change who\nthe owner of the document is.\n\n618\n00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:19.960\nAs an administrator with full control,\nI can go in and change the owner.\n\n619\n00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:21.950\nUsually what we'll do,\n\n620\n00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:25.740\nis we assign ownership to\nthe administrators group, right?\n\n621\n00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:27.890\nThat way it's not tied to one individual.\n\n622\n00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:30.240\nWhat if Daniel leaves the company?\n\n623\n00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.650\nWho is the owner of that document now?\n\n624\n00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:36.081\nIt just becomes a little bit troublesome\nwhen working with those documents.\n\n625\n00:32:36.081 --> 00:32:39.833\nSo that's something you can do in NTFS.\n\n626\n00:32:39.833 --> 00:32:42.950\nJust understand that\nthe creator of a document or\n\n627\n00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:46.835\na folder is considered the owner and\nthey have full control.\n\n628\n00:32:46.835 --> 00:32:49.314\nSo sometimes we need to take\nthat away from them and\n\n629\n00:32:49.314 --> 00:32:52.430\nassign that ownership to\nthe administrators group.\n\n630\n00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:56.040\n>> That's right, super handy with those\norphaned files that somebody's gone,\n\n631\n00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.480\nthey no longer exist, or\nit's just kind of hanging out there.\n\n632\n00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:02.570\nAnd no one has the ability to do anything\nwith it because the owner does not\n\n633\n00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:03.490\nexist anymore [LAUGH].\n\n634\n00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:06.530\nSo it's very helpful for\nus to be able to take that ownership and\n\n635\n00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:08.618\nreclaim our power over it.\n\n636\n00:33:08.618 --> 00:33:11.118\nMike, [LAUGH]-\n>> I was just thinking, that's a great,\n\n637\n00:33:11.118 --> 00:33:12.790\nyou just made me think of something else.\n\n638\n00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:17.110\nWhat about that user that has documents\nstored up in folder redirection, right,\n\n639\n00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:17.800\nand they've left.\n\n640\n00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:21.760\nThey've important documents in\nthere that only they had access to.\n\n641\n00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:23.710\nHow do I get in there?\n\n642\n00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:25.220\nHow do I get access to those documents?\n\n643\n00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:27.910\nWell as an admin I can take\nownership of those documents and\n\n644\n00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:30.300\nreassign the permissions so\neverybody can get access to those.\n\n645\n00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:31.150\nSo great point Daniel.\n\n646\n00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:32.340\n>> Yeah very good stuff.\n\n647\n00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:35.680\nAll right, Mike, looks like we've come\nto the end of another excellent episode.\n\n648\n00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.423\nThank you so much for\nthose demonstrations.\n\n649\n00:33:37.423 --> 00:33:41.376\nExplaining this permissions business can\nbe a bit of a bear but you can watch this\n\n650\n00:33:41.376 --> 00:33:44.578\nepisode over and over again until\nit starts to make sense to you.\n\n651\n00:33:44.578 --> 00:33:46.631\nAnd one day, trust us, it will.\n\n652\n00:33:46.631 --> 00:33:50.852\nAnd then you'll be on the fast track\nto being a sys admin, just like us.\n\n653\n00:33:50.852 --> 00:33:54.345\n[LAUGH] All right, that being said,\nwe're gonna sign off for ITProTV.\n\n654\n00:33:54.345 --> 00:33:56.205\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n655\n00:33:56.205 --> 00:33:56.885\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n656\n00:33:56.885 --> 00:33:58.716\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n657\n00:33:58.716 --> 00:34:05.260\n>> [SOUND]\n\n",

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.584\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, joining me\non the show none other than Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:20.584 --> 00:00:21.685\nHow's it going today Mike?\n\n5\n00:00:21.685 --> 00:00:23.056\nIt's going great Daniel,\n\n6\n00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:26.992\nI'm excited to be here because we've got\nour MTA content coming your way, and\n\n7\n00:00:26.992 --> 00:00:31.124\nin this episode we're gonna be looking\nat password policies and audit policies.\n\n8\n00:00:31.124 --> 00:00:34.699\nTwo very important parts of\nkeeping our network secure.\n\n9\n00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:36.549\n>> That's right,\nwe gotta have passwords and\n\n10\n00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:39.760\nthen we gotta make sure everybody's\nactually using passwords correctly.\n\n11\n00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.110\nNow we have talked about passwords and\naudit policies in previous episodes or\n\n12\n00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.950\nother episodes should I say.\n\n13\n00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.500\nAnd you can probably have a good\nidea what's going on there but\n\n14\n00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.260\nthat's not what we're\nreally getting into today.\n\n15\n00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.010\nIt's all about the policies\nbehind those passwords.\n\n16\n00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.880\nWhat should we be doing?\n\n17\n00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.010\nWhat's the best practices?\n\n18\n00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.870\nHow should we implement\npasswords in our system?\n\n19\n00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.130\nAnd then, the audit policies.\n\n20\n00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.480\nHow should we be auditing?\n\n21\n00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.050\nWhat's the best practice behind that?\n\n22\n00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.850\nAnd Mike, that's what you're\ngonna help us with today, right?\n\n23\n00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:05.840\n>> I sure am gonna try.\n\n24\n00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.195\nSo, hopefully, I'll be successful.\n\n25\n00:01:07.195 --> 00:01:09.650\n[LAUGH] So let's start with\npassword policies, you know?\n\n26\n00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.150\nWe understand we have to have a password.\n\n27\n00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.710\nBut we let our users create\nthose passwords, right?\n\n28\n00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.280\nPart of the strength of\na password is the fact that\n\n29\n00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.830\nthe user is the only on that knows it.\n\n30\n00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.830\nAs an administrator, I typically don't\neven know what their password is.\n\n31\n00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.080\nNow, I might be able to reset it for\nthem to something I know,\n\n32\n00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.850\nbut that's another story, right?\n\n33\n00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.870\n>> Mike's so secure he doesn't\neven know his own password.\n\n34\n00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.600\n>> That's right.\nI don't know what it is.\n\n35\n00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.140\nSo we need some way to make sure our\nusers are creating strong passwords.\n\n36\n00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.370\nAnd that's where our password\npolicies come into play.\n\n37\n00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.820\nRather than just create their\nown password without any rules,\n\n38\n00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.500\nbecause we know what they come up with,\nright?\n\n39\n00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.930\nMy password is blue,\nor my password is July.\n\n40\n00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.122\nI mean, it's those kind of\nthings that are gonna get you.\n\n41\n00:01:51.122 --> 00:01:52.440\nWe've gotta prevent that.\n\n42\n00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.630\nWe wanna make sure that they're\nfollowing best practices.\n\n43\n00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.780\nAnd that means making a complex password,\nincluding a mix of characters, upper,\n\n44\n00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.400\nlower, number and special character as\nwell as making it long enough to satisfy\n\n45\n00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.120\nour company's security requirements,\nwhatever they may be.\n\n46\n00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.180\nSo let's see how we can enforce that.\n\n47\n00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.000\nWe take a look at my screen here,\n\n48\n00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.300\nevery Windows machine has\nwhat we call a Local Policy.\n\n49\n00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.570\nAnd I'm gonna open up my Local Policy\nEditor by typing in gpedit.msc.\n\n50\n00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.350\nAnd when I come into my local policy\nwe'll make that a little bit bigger.\n\n51\n00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.280\nAnd we're going to go down to Windows\nSettings, and then Security Settings.\n\n52\n00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.120\nAnd then underneath Account Policies I'll\nfind my Password Policies.\n\n53\n00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.550\nThese are the settings that I can use to\nensure that my users are following our\n\n54\n00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.360\nrecommendations.\n\n55\n00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.670\nAnd we'll just go through these.\n\n56\n00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.230\nThe first one there is\nenforce password history.\n\n57\n00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.890\nAnd you can see the default\nis 24 passwords remembered.\n\n58\n00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.460\nWhats that's going to do is its going to\nremember the last 24 passwords that you've\n\n59\n00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.780\nused to prevent you from using\nthe same password over and over again.\n\n60\n00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.420\nIf we didn't have this setting,\nlets say Daniel's password was blue.\n\n61\n00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.290\nAnd then it came time\nto change his password.\n\n62\n00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.950\nWell he could change it to blue right,\nand the system wouldn't care\n\n63\n00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.310\nas long as he went through the procedure\nof typing in the old password,\n\n64\n00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.530\ntyping in the new password twice and\nclicking OK, it would be perfectly happy.\n\n65\n00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.020\nWith this setting, I can say Daniel no,\nyou can't use blue again.\n\n66\n00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.630\nIn fact, you're going to have to\ncome up with 23 more passwords\n\n67\n00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.330\nbefore you ever get back to blue.\n\n68\n00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.267\n>> But I like blue.\n\n69\n00:03:25.267 --> 00:03:26.755\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Is that so wrong?\n\n70\n00:03:26.755 --> 00:03:28.290\n[LAUGH]\n>> He does like blue.\n\n71\n00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.190\nSo you know there are other\ncolors we want to make sure\n\n72\n00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.670\nget their share of\nthe time in the spotlight.\n\n73\n00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.430\nRemembering those passwords make sure\nmy users are actually changing it.\n\n74\n00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.340\nNot just going through\nthe formality of typing in the same\n\n75\n00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.760\npassword three times and clicking OK.\n\n76\n00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.860\nSo that's a very important one.\n\n77\n00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.090\nNext one down is my maximum password age.\n\n78\n00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.110\nThis decides how often I\nneed to change my password.\n\n79\n00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.110\nThe default is 42.\n\n80\n00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.690\nThat means every 42 days my\nsystem should prompt me and\n\n81\n00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.090\nsay hey, it's time to change your password\nand force me to change my password.\n\n82\n00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.230\nAnd since I can remember the last 24\npasswords, I can't use the same password.\n\n83\n00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.790\nI can't use the password that I\nused the previous password change.\n\n84\n00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.410\nI'll have to come up with something new.\n\n85\n00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.580\nOf course, we know in the end\nour users typically just\n\n86\n00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.460\nadd a couple of digits to the end of it to\nkeep cycling through the same password.\n\n87\n00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:20.810\nBut hey, at least it's different.\n\n88\n00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.940\nIt's a step in the right direction, right?\n\n89\n00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:23.830\n>> Right.\n\n90\n00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.700\n>> All right, next one down,\nminimum password age.\n\n91\n00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.250\nThis is how old the password has to\nbe before you can change it again.\n\n92\n00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.080\nIt's kind of a strange one.\n\n93\n00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.890\nWhy do I care if my user basically\nwhat this is say is if my user\n\n94\n00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.210\nchanges their password, they can't change\nit again for 24 hours for one day.\n\n95\n00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.180\nSeems kind of odd, right?\n\n96\n00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.290\nIt seems like it's going against security.\n\n97\n00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.990\nBut there's a reason for this.\n\n98\n00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.490\nOur users who can not figure out\nhow to print their spreadsheet\n\n99\n00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.290\nin landscape format will somehow\nbypass my security policy.\n\n100\n00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.980\nThey will figure it out.\n\n101\n00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.520\nWhat they will do if Daniel's\nfavorite password is blue.\n\n102\n00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.510\nSo when it comes time to change his\npassword, guess what he's gonna do?\n\n103\n00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.570\nHe can't use blue again because it's\nremembering the last 24, he's gonna\n\n104\n00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.460\nchange his password 25 times so that he\ncan get back to his favorite password.\n\n105\n00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.180\nHe will sit there for 20 minutes,\nchange it, change it, change it,\n\n106\n00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.370\nchange it, until he gets back to blue.\n\n107\n00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.502\n>> I like blue.\n\n108\n00:05:18.502 --> 00:05:19.014\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n109\n00:05:19.014 --> 00:05:19.958\n>> What's wrong with blue?\n\n110\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.904\n[LAUGH] Or like some sorta blue\n\n111\n00:05:21.904 --> 00:05:23.614\nbigotry going on over here.\n>> We\n\n112\n00:05:23.614 --> 00:05:26.160\nreally are seeing that\nDaniel loves the color blue.\n\n113\n00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.930\nSo this way, Daniel can't do that.\n\n114\n00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.910\nIf he changes his password,\n\n115\n00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.080\nhe's gotta wait 24 hours\nbefore he can change it again.\n\n116\n00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.310\nAnd then another 24 hours before he\ncan change it again, and so on and\n\n117\n00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.090\nso on, right?\n\n118\n00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.750\nSo it's gonna take him at least 24\ndays to get back to his favorite,\n\n119\n00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.050\n25 days,\nto get back to is favorite password.\n\n120\n00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.411\nIf we tweak these settings a little bit,\nif I say you know what?\n\n121\n00:05:48.411 --> 00:05:51.169\nYou gotta change your\npassword every 30 days, and\n\n122\n00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.250\nI am gonna remember the last\n30 passwords that you used.\n\n123\n00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.150\nThat means by the time, if you sit there\nand change your password every single day\n\n124\n00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.930\nfor 30 days, you'll get back\nthe original password, but guess what?\n\n125\n00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.870\nIt's time to change your password again.\n\n126\n00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.350\nSo you get to go through\nthe process all over again, which,\n\n127\n00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.230\nyou know now that I think about,\nmight be pretty secure,\n\n128\n00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.700\ncuz that means my user's using\na different password every day.\n\n129\n00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.260\n>> Every day.\n\n130\n00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.240\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n131\n00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.438\n>> This might be a good policy.\n\n132\n00:06:13.438 --> 00:06:15.943\n>> This is something we're\ngonna have to run by Microsoft.\n\n133\n00:06:15.943 --> 00:06:18.635\n>> Kind of a social engineering\nagainst their own users, right?\n\n134\n00:06:18.635 --> 00:06:21.577\nTo make them use a new password every day.\n\n135\n00:06:21.577 --> 00:06:22.730\n[LAUGH] Hey, change that bad boy.\n\n136\n00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.200\nGo for it.\n\n137\n00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.800\n>> Yeah.\n>> They won't change it once,\n\n138\n00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.560\nevery 30 days, but, by God,\nthey'll change it once, 30 times.\n\n139\n00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.310\n>> It is true, they really will.\n\n140\n00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.480\n>> It's amazing.\n\n141\n00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.180\n>> All right.\nSo, we'll keep on going down our list.\n\n142\n00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.300\nNext one, minimum password length.\n\n143\n00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.850\nThat's how long the password has to be.\n\n144\n00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.130\nThe default is gonna be seven characters.\n\n145\n00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.050\nThat's really short,\nin the scheme of things.\n\n146\n00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.040\nIt should be at least eight or more.\n\n147\n00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.110\nBut again, this is just the default.\n\n148\n00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.380\nThe next one, password must\nmeet complexity requirements.\n\n149\n00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.780\nWell, does the password\nhave to be complex?\n\n150\n00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.260\nNow let's make sure we understand\nwhat Microsoft considers complex.\n\n151\n00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.722\nThere's four character sets\nI can use in password.\n\n152\n00:06:58.722 --> 00:07:03.510\nUppercase letters, lowercase letters,\nnumbers, and special characters.\n\n153\n00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:06.010\nIf you enable this,\nwhich it is by default,\n\n154\n00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:09.950\nyou have to have three of the four\ncharacter sets in your password.\n\n155\n00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.120\nDoesn't matter which three.\n\n156\n00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.530\nSo it could be uppercase, lowercase,\nand numbers, or lowercase, numbers, and\n\n157\n00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:18.600\nspecial characters, or uppercase numbers,\nany combination of the three,\n\n158\n00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.610\nas long as three of the four character\nsets are present in your password,\n\n159\n00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.870\nit is gonna be considered complex,\nall right?\n\n160\n00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:31.580\nThe last one there is store passwords\nusing reversible encryption.\n\n161\n00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.090\nTypically a password is store\nusing a hashing algorithm.\n\n162\n00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:39.460\nSo that means once it's fed through\nthat algorithm, a hash of value, or\n\n163\n00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:43.230\na message digest is the output,\nand that's what gets stored.\n\n164\n00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.450\nAnd when you authenticate, your\npassword doesn't go across the network.\n\n165\n00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:51.290\nIt uses the same hashing algorithm, hashes\nwhat you typed into that password dialogue\n\n166\n00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:55.490\nbox, sends it over to the authentication,\nwhoever's doing the authentication,\n\n167\n00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:58.865\nlocal or domain, and\nit compares those hash values.\n\n168\n00:07:58.865 --> 00:08:01.046\nRemember what we learned\nabout hash values.\n\n169\n00:08:01.046 --> 00:08:04.711\nSame input is always gonna\ngenerate the same output.\n\n170\n00:08:04.711 --> 00:08:09.096\nSo, if I type in the right password,\nThose hash values should match exactly.\n\n171\n00:08:09.096 --> 00:08:12.790\nIf I type in anything different,\nthose values are not gonna match.\n\n172\n00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:15.770\nSo when it gets sent over and compared\nagainst the account database, it's\n\n173\n00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:19.010\ngonna say that wasn't the right password,\nand it's not gonna allow you to log in.\n\n174\n00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:20.480\nThat's the way it normally works.\n\n175\n00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:24.100\nThere are, however,\nsome authentication protocols\n\n176\n00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:28.230\nthat need to know what the plain\ntext version of your password is.\n\n177\n00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:33.469\nCHAP, Challenge-Handshake Authentication\nProtocol, needs to know what your plain\n\n178\n00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:38.496\ntext, what your password actually is\nbecause during that authentication method,\n\n179\n00:08:38.496 --> 00:08:42.550\nit ends up combining your plain text\npassword with a key or a secret.\n\n180\n00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:45.670\nAnd then hashing the whole thing and\nsending it to the other side.\n\n181\n00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.340\nAnd we can get into CHAP\nit some other time,\n\n182\n00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.440\nbut the point is the server\nneeds the plain text version.\n\n183\n00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:54.540\nWhich means I have to store it in\nthat account database in a way that\n\n184\n00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:59.050\nthe server at any time can reverse\nthe encryption that I've used and\n\n185\n00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.560\nget the plain-text version\nof the password back out.\n\n186\n00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.570\nThat's what this is saying.\n\n187\n00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:06.048\nHey, if you need to support one of\nthose older protocols like that,\n\n188\n00:09:06.048 --> 00:09:09.051\nyou can store the password\nusing reversible encryption.\n\n189\n00:09:09.051 --> 00:09:13.933\nThis is disabled by default, and you do\nnot want to turn it on unless you have\n\n190\n00:09:13.933 --> 00:09:16.980\nto support one of those older protocols.\n\n191\n00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.890\nIf you don't, don't turn that back on.\n\n192\n00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:24.050\nDon't enable that because that is actually\nreducing security on your network.\n\n193\n00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:26.520\nYou wanna use the one-way encryption.\n\n194\n00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.560\nYou do not want to use\nreversible encryption.\n\n195\n00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:33.990\nExcuse me, now, these settings, again you\nsaw me set these on my, the local machine,\n\n196\n00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:38.300\nI opened up Group Policy Management,\nI'm sorry, the GP Edit,\n\n197\n00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.600\nthe Group Policy Editor on\nthis local machine here.\n\n198\n00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.860\nIn an domain environment, we are not going\nto run around in every single machine and\n\n199\n00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:48.810\ntry to set policies or\nconfigure settings like this.\n\n200\n00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:53.370\nI wanna be able to do it in one place and\nonly have to do it once.\n\n201\n00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:55.880\nThe other thing I've got to think\nabout is what if that person's\n\n202\n00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.810\nan administrator on their machine?\n\n203\n00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:01.510\nWell they don't like using,\nremembering twenty-four passwords or\n\n204\n00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:02.330\nusing seven characters.\n\n205\n00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.028\nThey could come in here and change this.\n\n206\n00:10:04.028 --> 00:10:07.230\nYou know what, I'm just gonna\nchange this down to six or five,\n\n207\n00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.790\nsomething like that, right?\n\n208\n00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:12.688\nWell, in a domain environment,\nwe have what's called Group Policy in\n\n209\n00:10:12.688 --> 00:10:15.460\nActive Directory, and\nwe set those settings there,\n\n210\n00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:20.450\nand then the, all the machines on the\nnetwork are going to abide by that policy.\n\n211\n00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:23.297\nIn fact, you probably saw when\nI double-clicked on this,\n\n212\n00:10:23.297 --> 00:10:27.350\nnotice, I can't change it, all right,\nbecause this is pulling from the domain.\n\n213\n00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.370\nThis computer is part of my domain.\n\n214\n00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:31.870\nAnd on the domain controller,\n\n215\n00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:36.569\nI can open up Group Policy Management and\nI'll see those exact same settings.\n\n216\n00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.400\nI'll edit this default domain policy and\n\n217\n00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.900\nI'll go down into those Windows\nsettings and security settings and\n\n218\n00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.240\nin account policies and\npassword policy and there they are.\n\n219\n00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.530\nThis is where that machine\nwas getting those settings.\n\n220\n00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:52.860\nAnd again, these are the default\nsettings for active directory.\n\n221\n00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.660\nSo we set them here, and\nbecause of the way group policy applies\n\n222\n00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:00.870\nmy domain policy will override\nthose local policies.\n\n223\n00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:04.500\nSo my users are stuck with this,\nthey can't bypass this.\n\n224\n00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.340\nThey can't go to their machine and\n\n225\n00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:12.290\ntry to set their local policy to something\nless than what my domain policy is.\n\n226\n00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:14.470\nAnd the other way around,\nthey can't make it more secure either.\n\n227\n00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:15.880\nThey can't change it at all.\n\n228\n00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.670\nWhatever I set here is what all\nthe machines have to abide by.\n\n229\n00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:24.520\nEven if you log on with a local account,\nif that machine is part of the domain,\n\n230\n00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.310\nthese settings will be\nenforced on that machine.\n\n231\n00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:30.490\nEven if they try to create\nan account that's stored locally,\n\n232\n00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:31.770\nnot in active directory.\n\n233\n00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:36.670\nBecause these are machine settings, these\nget applied before the user ever logs on.\n\n234\n00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:37.830\nAll right.\n\n235\n00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:41.290\nSo this is how we're gonna\nenforce those password policies\n\n236\n00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:44.920\nin our domain environment, and for\nthis exam, be familiar with these options.\n\n237\n00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.530\nKnow what they are, what they mean,\nand where you would go to set them.\n\n238\n00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:50.640\n>> Pretty cool stuff.\n\n239\n00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.860\nWe see that setting password policy is\na very important part of the job of being\n\n240\n00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.600\nan administrator or working with\na computer system, because, well,\n\n241\n00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.030\nwe gotta maintain\nthe integrity of the system.\n\n242\n00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:05.360\nPasswords is a great way to\nmake sure that that happens.\n\n243\n00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.300\n>> It really is, Daniel.\n\n244\n00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:09.415\nNow, one of the things that we didn't\ntalk about was attack methods, right?\n\n245\n00:12:09.415 --> 00:12:10.820\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Because passwords,\n\n246\n00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.930\nI mean this was a bad\nguy's point of entry.\n\n247\n00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:18.050\nIf he can get your password somehow, he\ncan now authenticate to the system as you.\n\n248\n00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:21.910\nAnd try to gain access to the system,\nto resources on the network, or\n\n249\n00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:25.320\ntry to move on and\nescalate his credentials to somebody else,\n\n250\n00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.190\nseveral different things\nhe might try to do.\n\n251\n00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:30.770\nSo, we need to make sure we're familiar\nwith some of the different attack\n\n252\n00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:32.660\nmethods on passwords.\n\n253\n00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.840\nFrist one is just stealing the password.\n\n254\n00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:39.630\nThis is one where, maybe they're\nusing a packet capture utility,\n\n255\n00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:42.620\nsome kind of network monitor or Wireshark.\n\n256\n00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.960\nAnd, when you authenticate,\nwhen you authenticate with that domain,\n\n257\n00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.780\nyour credentials are sent\nacross the network.\n\n258\n00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:51.100\nNow they're encrypted, they're protected\nas they go across the network.\n\n259\n00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.730\nBut maybe he's trying to do\nsome type of replay attack,\n\n260\n00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:58.200\ncapture those,\npass them back at a future date.\n\n261\n00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.050\nOr maybe you're authenticating something\nother than active directory, right?\n\n262\n00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:05.050\nMaybe in your network, you've got your\naccount that you log onto the system with,\n\n263\n00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:07.880\nbut then there's this internal\nweb page that you go to, and\n\n264\n00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.830\nyou have to authenticate to get to that.\n\n265\n00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:14.120\nAnd it's not using active directory for\nauthentication, it's just forms based, but\n\n266\n00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:18.040\nmost of my users, what they end up\ndoing is using the same password for\n\n267\n00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:23.040\ntheir work account as well as\nthis unprotected website, or\n\n268\n00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.900\nthis weak authentication method\nwe're using on the website.\n\n269\n00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:29.560\nSo if I can capture that information,\nI can break that.\n\n270\n00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.908\nNow I've got your password and\nsince you use the same password for\n\n271\n00:13:31.908 --> 00:13:33.835\nyour domain account,\nI can now log in as you, right?\n\n272\n00:13:33.835 --> 00:13:40.670\nOther ways of stealing it are, our users\nlove to write their passwords down, right.\n\n273\n00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:43.300\nThey tape it to their monitor,\nthey put it under their keyboard,\n\n274\n00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.619\nin a desk drawer, and-\n>> Get a plane, skywrite it.\n\n275\n00:13:46.619 --> 00:13:47.235\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n276\n00:13:47.235 --> 00:13:49.630\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n277\n00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:50.402\n>> And they do,\n\n278\n00:13:50.402 --> 00:13:54.408\nthey tend to write them down, and\nif a bad guy obviously finds that,\n\n279\n00:13:54.408 --> 00:13:55.970\nI've got your password.\n\n280\n00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:59.090\nSo stealing, relatively easy.\n\n281\n00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:00.210\nOther ones they can try to do.\n\n282\n00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:02.180\nPassword guessing, right?\n\n283\n00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.740\nI can sit down at the computer, and\n\n284\n00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.030\nI can just type in what I\nthink might be your password.\n\n285\n00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:08.500\nIf it doesn't work, I'll try again.\n\n286\n00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:12.590\nAnd you might think that's crazy,\nthat could take you forever, and it could.\n\n287\n00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:16.650\nBut if I do a little research,\nI can get closer than you might think.\n\n288\n00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:19.010\nYeah, we can do some what\nwe call social engineering.\n\n289\n00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:23.220\nI can talk to Daniel, find out that\nhis favorite color is blue, and\n\n290\n00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:27.980\nthat his favorite sports team is so\nand so, and his children's birthday or\n\n291\n00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:30.550\nanniversary dates,\npets' names, things like this.\n\n292\n00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:32.810\nThese are common things people use for\npasswords.\n\n293\n00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:35.230\nSo if I can start gathering\nsome of that information,\n\n294\n00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:38.310\nI can make my password guessing\na whole lot more effective.\n\n295\n00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.920\nAll right?\n\n296\n00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.540\nAnd get a little bit closer\nto breaking that password.\n\n297\n00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:45.020\nOther methods we can use are what's\ncalled brute force attacks.\n\n298\n00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:51.000\nIn a brute force attack, we're going to\nthrow every possible combination at it.\n\n299\n00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.460\nBecause guess what?\n\n300\n00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.990\nYour password is some combination of\nletter, number, and special character.\n\n301\n00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:58.500\nSo if I go through every possibility,\n\n302\n00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.300\nI have to get your password at some point,\nright?\n\n303\n00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.130\nThe question is how long\nis that gonna take me?\n\n304\n00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:08.730\nBy using long passwords,\nby using complex passwords,\n\n305\n00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:13.650\nwe increase that time factor to the point\nwhere it's not gonna do them any good.\n\n306\n00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:17.970\nHopefully it will take them longer to\ncrack than my password change policy.\n\n307\n00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:21.880\nIf it takes me ten years to crack your\npassword or you're changing it every 30\n\n308\n00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.460\ndays, so by the time I get it,\nyou've already changed it, right.\n\n309\n00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.380\nAnd really it's something\nthat we should think about,\n\n310\n00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.520\nyour password doesn't\nhave to be bulletproof.\n\n311\n00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.970\nIt doesn't have to be\na thousand characters long.\n\n312\n00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:36.290\nWe don't need it to last an eternity.\n\n313\n00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:39.780\nWe just need our password\nto last 42 days by default.\n\n314\n00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:41.490\nRight, as long as I can get it.\n\n315\n00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:45.310\nNow, one thing we gotta keep in mind,\nwhen they do password guessing or\n\n316\n00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:47.590\nbrute forcing,\nthey might get it on the first try.\n\n317\n00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:49.380\nThere's always that chance, right?\n\n318\n00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:52.432\nSo we want to make our passwords\nas strong as possible.\n\n319\n00:15:52.432 --> 00:15:57.260\nBut, one of the things I like to tell my\nadministrators that I'm working with is\n\n320\n00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.014\ndon't go too far with\nyour password policy.\n\n321\n00:16:00.014 --> 00:16:03.050\nBecause you end up hurting security\nrather than helping security.\n\n322\n00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:07.183\nIf I tell my users that they have\nto use a 15 character password, and\n\n323\n00:16:07.183 --> 00:16:11.959\nthey have to change it every 5 days, and\nthey can't reuse the same password for\n\n324\n00:16:11.959 --> 00:16:15.190\nthe last 50 times,\nthat's a steep order, right?\n\n325\n00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:18.520\nI mean, what they're gonna end\nup doing is writing it down.\n\n326\n00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.540\nAnd now it becomes easy for\nsomebody else to find or steal.\n\n327\n00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:25.020\nSo I didn't help security,\nI actually hindered security.\n\n328\n00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:28.110\nSo you've gotta find that balance\nwhen you're setting these policies,\n\n329\n00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:32.910\nyou gotta think about what's practical and\nfigure out the best\n\n330\n00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:37.810\nsettings for your organization and\nyour security requirements.\n\n331\n00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:42.430\nAll right, Daniel, I think that's\nprobably enough about password policies.\n\n332\n00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:45.400\nThere's a lot of them, it's just\nimportant that you go in there and\n\n333\n00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.070\ntake a look at them.\n\n334\n00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:48.780\nRemember domain policies\noverride the local policies.\n\n335\n00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:49.580\n>> Awesome stuff.\n\n336\n00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:52.990\nWell that moves us into account,\nour audit policies should I say well,\n\n337\n00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:54.825\nwe'll get into account policies.\n\n338\n00:16:54.825 --> 00:16:57.760\nAudit policies, where we actually\ntake a look at what is going on.\n\n339\n00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.830\nHow do we set up the correct\nway to audit our systems, so\n\n340\n00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:06.340\nthat we are not inundated with\na flood of event logs and\n\n341\n00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:09.880\napplication logs, all the different\nlogs they we have built on our systems,\n\n342\n00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.320\nso that we get right to\nthe information that's necessary,\n\n343\n00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:15.110\npertinent to whatever it\nis we're trying to do.\n\n344\n00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:17.280\nNow, Mike, you've been through\na lot of these logs, I know,\n\n345\n00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.485\nI've seen you go through them before.\n\n346\n00:17:18.485 --> 00:17:20.460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They can be a little overwhelming.\n\n347\n00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:21.590\n>> They can, absolutely.\n\n348\n00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:25.140\nAnd that's why it's very important\nto come up with a good audit\n\n349\n00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.510\npolicy as an organization.\n\n350\n00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:30.880\nYou've got to decide what information I\nreally need to capture, because if you\n\n351\n00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:35.230\njust try to audit anything and everything,\nyou end up with log files that are very\n\n352\n00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:39.440\nlarge and it's gonna be difficult\nto find the pertinent information.\n\n353\n00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.130\nYou're scrolling through\na list of 50,000 entries and\n\n354\n00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:45.180\nyou miss the one entry\nthat meant something.\n\n355\n00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:48.160\nSo that was going one at 1 o'clock\nin the morning when nobody should've\n\n356\n00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.240\nbeen on the network.\n\n357\n00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.740\nThose are the kind of\nthings that can happen.\n\n358\n00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:54.800\nSo we want to develop\na policy that fits our needs.\n\n359\n00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:58.420\nIf you're HIPAA compliant, or\nSarbanes-Oxley, there's a lot of stuff\n\n360\n00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:02.470\nthat's gonna be predefined for you that\nsays, you have to audit all of this.\n\n361\n00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:06.980\nSo of course you need to follow that,\nthat's part of our plan.\n\n362\n00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:12.390\nSo come up with a policy that gets what\nyou need to satisfy any industry or\n\n363\n00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:16.460\ngovernmental regulations or if you don't\nhave any of those as an organization, so\n\n364\n00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.468\nthen decide what is it you might need.\n\n365\n00:18:18.468 --> 00:18:21.400\nDo you wanna be able to prosecute people\nin the event that somebody breaks into\n\n366\n00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.740\nsystems and gains access to data.\n\n367\n00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:26.040\nWell then,\nyou're gonna need to audit log-on events.\n\n368\n00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.610\nYou're gonna see when that person logs on.\n\n369\n00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:30.450\nI can't go into court and say, I'm pretty\nsure Daniel logged in at 1 o'clock\n\n370\n00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:34.550\nin the morning and\naccessed this database or these files.\n\n371\n00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:37.070\nJudges are gonna say,\nyou're pretty sure, right,\n\n372\n00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:40.820\nI need log files that show here's\nwhere Daniel logged on at 1:42am.\n\n373\n00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.665\nHere's where he reached out and\n\n374\n00:18:42.665 --> 00:18:46.180\ndouble-clicked on this folder,\nthen he double-clicked on this file, and\n\n375\n00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:49.190\nthen he may change this file or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n376\n00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:50.880\nThat's what auditing can do for me.\n\n377\n00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.860\nSo we just have to make\nsure we plan it out.\n\n378\n00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:54.980\nWe can do different types of auditing.\n\n379\n00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:58.440\nI'll go ahead and\nshow you here on my machine.\n\n380\n00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.343\nThis is group policy management and\n\n381\n00:19:01.343 --> 00:19:04.632\nI'm just gonna right-click on\nthis server's OU, create a GPO so\n\n382\n00:19:04.632 --> 00:19:07.936\nwe'll have something to look at and\nI'll call it my Audit Policy.\n\n383\n00:19:11.443 --> 00:19:13.889\nAnd then I'll go back in and\nedit this policy.\n\n384\n00:19:16.561 --> 00:19:17.620\nIf I can get that to expand out.\n\n385\n00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:21.398\nAnd then we'll go down to\nPolicies > Windows Settings, and\n\n386\n00:19:21.398 --> 00:19:24.990\nthen Security Settings > Account Policies.\n\n387\n00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:26.110\nI'm sorry, not account policies.\n\n388\n00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:29.650\nLocal policies and then my Audit Policy.\n\n389\n00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:31.400\nNow there's nine,\n\n390\n00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:35.190\nif I remember right, nine categories\nhere of things we can audit.\n\n391\n00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:40.740\nWe can audit account logon events, account\nmanagement, directory service access,\n\n392\n00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:46.510\nlogon, object policy change, privileges,\nprocess tracking and system events.\n\n393\n00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:47.900\nLet's talk about a couple of these.\n\n394\n00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.810\nAccount management, I'll skip\nthe account logon just for a second,\n\n395\n00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:54.120\nwe'll come back to that.\n\n396\n00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:58.210\nAccount management, well if I need to know\nanytime somebody goes in active directory\n\n397\n00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:01.950\nand makes changes to user accounts,\nsomebody's been resetting passwords,\n\n398\n00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:03.370\nI need to know who's doing that.\n\n399\n00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:05.370\nSomebody's been changing\ngroup membership for\n\n400\n00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:09.230\nusers, I need to know who's doing that,\naccount management can help me with that.\n\n401\n00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:13.070\nIf I'm auditing that, every time somebody\nmakes a change to a user account,\n\n402\n00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:15.170\nI'll see that information in my log files.\n\n403\n00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:18.250\nDirectory service access,\nanytime you access active directory or\n\n404\n00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:20.510\ndirectory services, I can audit that.\n\n405\n00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:22.660\nAgain, skipping logon for just a second.\n\n406\n00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:27.820\nObject access is one we use for files,\nfolders, databases, things like that.\n\n407\n00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:31.250\nIf I need to see anytime, whenever\nsomebody tries to access a file or\n\n408\n00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:36.340\nfolder, I can use my object access,\npolicy change.\n\n409\n00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.988\nRight now,\nI'm making a change to a group policy.\n\n410\n00:20:38.988 --> 00:20:42.720\nIf I wanna record when somebody does that,\nI can turn this category on and\n\n411\n00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.460\nthat way I'll know,\nhey Mike modified the group policy\n\n412\n00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.945\nat 2:13 pm on Tuesday morning,\nor Tuesday afternoon.\n\n413\n00:20:49.945 --> 00:20:56.250\nPrivilege Use, we can assign privileges\nand rights to user accounts and to groups.\n\n414\n00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:59.810\nI wanna see when they use those,\nI can audit that category.\n\n415\n00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:03.870\nProcess tracking is really more\nabout applications or processes and\n\n416\n00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:08.030\nseeing what they're reaching out and\ngaining access to so that I can either\n\n417\n00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:12.910\ncontrol security or maybe an application\nis not working properly, because\n\n418\n00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:17.120\na process it launches needs access to a\ncertain resource and it's getting denied.\n\n419\n00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:20.430\nI can find that and\nfix the problems using that.\n\n420\n00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:23.410\nSystem Events,\nevents that occur on my system, right.\n\n421\n00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:24.930\nSo a couple different\nthings we can audit there.\n\n422\n00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:27.860\nLet me go back now and\ndo logon and account logon.\n\n423\n00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.500\nThese two are a little bit\nconfusing cuz you're like,\n\n424\n00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:33.170\nwhat's the difference between\naccount logon and logon.\n\n425\n00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:39.765\nA logon, so this one right here,\nis when you authenticate to a machine.\n\n426\n00:21:39.765 --> 00:21:43.210\nSo if I sit at this laptop and\nI type in my username and\n\n427\n00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:48.230\npassword, I'm authenticating, right,\nI'm logging on to this machine.\n\n428\n00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:52.080\nIf I reach out to a file server and\nI double-click on a file,\n\n429\n00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:56.390\nit has to verify my identity and\ngive me access to that resource.\n\n430\n00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:58.480\nI'm logging on to that file server.\n\n431\n00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:06.010\nThe account logon event, is the machine\nthat's performing the authentication.\n\n432\n00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:08.850\nNot where I'm sitting,\nnot what I'm accessing, but\n\n433\n00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:11.770\nwho's doing the validation\nof the password.\n\n434\n00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:16.680\nIf it's a local account, then the account\nlogon event occurs here, on my machine.\n\n435\n00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:20.370\nBecause my account password is stored\nin the SAM file on this machine.\n\n436\n00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:24.420\nIf it's a domain based account,\nwell then the account logon event is\n\n437\n00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:28.790\ngonna occur on the domain controller, cuz\nthat's where my user account is stored.\n\n438\n00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:32.170\nHe's the one that is verifying that\nI typed in the right password.\n\n439\n00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:36.530\nSo if we wanna audit,\nif I wanna know when Daniel logs on,\n\n440\n00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:39.130\nlet's say Daniel is using a work account,\na domain account.\n\n441\n00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:44.070\nIf I need to know when he logs on,\nand where he logged on at,\n\n442\n00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:47.990\nI'm gonna audit logon events\non the client machines.\n\n443\n00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:50.730\nBecause that will show me which\nmachine he was sitting at when he\n\n444\n00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:52.350\ndid the authentication.\n\n445\n00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:56.100\nAnd I'm gonna audit account logon\nevents on the domain controller,\n\n446\n00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.490\nbecause that's where the authentication\nprocess is occurring.\n\n447\n00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:03.980\nIf Daniel's using a local account, then\nthe logon event would fire on the local\n\n448\n00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:08.530\nmachine, cuz that's where he's at and\nthe account logon event would fire on\n\n449\n00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:12.670\nthe local machine, cuz it's the one\nthat's doing the actual authentication.\n\n450\n00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:15.120\nSo a little bit confusing\nthere between the two and\n\n451\n00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.730\nyou gotta decide what you need to see.\n\n452\n00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:19.960\nIf you don't care where they were sitting\nwhen they logged on, and you just\n\n453\n00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:23.550\nneed to know when they logged on, account\nlogon events, if it's a domain account.\n\n454\n00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:32.490\nAll right so, enabling auditing can be a,\nwell, it's pretty easy.\n\n455\n00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:33.780\nI'll show you here.\n\n456\n00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:37.960\nIf I wanna audit account logon events,\nor let's say I wanna audit logon events.\n\n457\n00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:43.084\nI'll just double click on this guy, and\nwe have to turn it on to find these\n\n458\n00:23:43.084 --> 00:23:48.482\npolicy settings and then we can either\nchoose success or failure, or both.\n\n459\n00:23:48.482 --> 00:23:52.330\nNow, again, one of those things\nthat you gotta think about.\n\n460\n00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:53.423\nWhat do I wanna see?\n\n461\n00:23:53.423 --> 00:23:56.544\nYou might think to yourself, well, I don't\ncare about successful logons, that means\n\n462\n00:23:56.544 --> 00:23:59.260\nthey had a password, they were able to\nget into the system, it's all good.\n\n463\n00:23:59.260 --> 00:23:59.966\nAll right?\n\n464\n00:23:59.966 --> 00:24:01.886\nSo I just wanna audit failures.\n\n465\n00:24:01.886 --> 00:24:03.595\nBut here's the problem with that.\n\n466\n00:24:03.595 --> 00:24:08.590\nSo one 30 in the morning,\nyou're seeing failure, failure, failure.\n\n467\n00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:12.460\nA good indication that somebody's\ndoing some password guessing\n\n468\n00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.090\nat one 30 in the morning.\n\n469\n00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:16.350\nAt one 40, the failures stop.\n\n470\n00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:20.510\nDid that person run away, get scared?\n\n471\n00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:24.790\nSomebody walked up and they ran,\nor did they succeed and\n\n472\n00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:26.740\nactually log into the system?\n\n473\n00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:29.780\nWell, if you're not auditing success,\nyou'll never know.\n\n474\n00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:30.310\nRight.\n\n475\n00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:32.760\nSo you gotta think about things like that.\n\n476\n00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:33.780\nThink about files.\n\n477\n00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:38.230\nThis one can get you in a whole world\nof trouble as far as log files go.\n\n478\n00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:42.790\nLet's say we've got an employee handbook\nand everybody has read permission but\n\n479\n00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:46.300\nsomebody's been making changes\nto the handbook, Daniel.\n\n480\n00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:48.770\nI know this guy is trouble.\n\n481\n00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:51.010\nSo, I need to find out.\n\n482\n00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:52.860\nWell, I'm gonna audit.\n\n483\n00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:56.400\nBut when I go to set my auditing settings,\nwhat am I gonna audit?\n\n484\n00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.100\nRead?\n\n485\n00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:57.900\nWrite?\n\n486\n00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:58.550\nFull control?\n\n487\n00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:00.260\nDo I want to audit everything?\n\n488\n00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:04.320\nSince everybody has read permission,\nI might not audit read.\n\n489\n00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:07.770\nBecause all I'm gonna get is a bunch\nof success, success, success, success.\n\n490\n00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:08.480\nAnd I'm okay with that.\n\n491\n00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.972\nI want people to read it, right?\n\n492\n00:25:09.972 --> 00:25:12.805\nBut I might audit write information only,\nand\n\n493\n00:25:12.805 --> 00:25:17.540\nnow I an find out when somebody's making\nchanges to that employee handbook.\n\n494\n00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:21.440\nI don't care if Daniel reads it,\nI wanna know if he's making changes to it.\n\n495\n00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:25.820\nAlright, so you've got to decide do I\nwant to do success, failure, or both.\n\n496\n00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:29.850\nNow a lot of these are just done right\nhere, like I've been showing you.\n\n497\n00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:33.530\nExcept for object access, this one's\na little bit different, all right.\n\n498\n00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:36.330\nWith object access,\nI'm gonna come in here and turn it on.\n\n499\n00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:37.800\nI'm gonna double click on it.\n\n500\n00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.600\nI'll choose to find these settings.\n\n501\n00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:43.650\nSuccess and failure, and I'll click okay.\n\n502\n00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:48.180\nWhat this is doing, is it's, now I'm\ngonna link this policy to my server,\n\n503\n00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:52.190\nmy file server, alright,\nthe OU that my file server resides in, so\n\n504\n00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:57.160\nthis tells my file server I'm allowed\nto do object access auditing.\n\n505\n00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.570\nAnd I can audit success and or failure.\n\n506\n00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:02.270\nBut it doesn't enable the auditing.\n\n507\n00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:04.560\nThis just tells the server\nthat it can do it.\n\n508\n00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:09.660\nSo that's step one, you have to create a\npolicy that says hey you're now allowed to\n\n509\n00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:13.832\naudit object access and\nI want you to do success and or failure.\n\n510\n00:26:13.832 --> 00:26:14.780\nAll right?\n\n511\n00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.380\nThen we have to go to\nthe file server over here.\n\n512\n00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.550\nActually, let me refresh this policy.\n\n513\n00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:22.370\nJust let me close that since\nI made those changes to it.\n\n514\n00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:24.350\nAnd on this guy I'm gonna update policy,\n\n515\n00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:28.770\ndo a little GP update switch\nforce to enforce that policy.\n\n516\n00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:33.960\nThen what I'm gonna do Is I'm going to go\nto the actual object that I want to audit.\n\n517\n00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:36.820\nWhoops.\nWrong drive letter there, Michael.\n\n518\n00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:41.880\nAlright.\nSo I'm going to make a new folder, and\n\n519\n00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.980\nI'm going to call it docs.\n\n520\n00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.200\nAnd inside there I'm\ngoing to make a new file.\n\n521\n00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:51.581\nAnd I'm going to call this handbook.\n\n522\n00:26:51.581 --> 00:26:52.222\n[SOUND].\n\n523\n00:26:52.222 --> 00:26:59.080\nAlright and I want to know when anyone of\nmy hosts makes a change to this document.\n\n524\n00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:02.400\nAlright so I'm going to right click\non this guy and choose properties.\n\n525\n00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:08.520\nAnd I'll go to the security tab and\nI'm going to click advanced, and\n\n526\n00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.847\nthis is where I can find\nmy auditing settings.\n\n527\n00:27:11.847 --> 00:27:16.806\nSo if I want to audit this file\nI click edit and then add.\n\n528\n00:27:16.806 --> 00:27:18.510\nAnd then who do I want to audit?\n\n529\n00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:20.530\nAuthenticated users, everybody or\n\n530\n00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:24.070\nmaybe I don't care about my\nemployees it's just the contractors,\n\n531\n00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:27.030\nI'm thinking that one of them has\nbeen messing around with this right.\n\n532\n00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:28.770\nSo this is what you've gotta think about.\n\n533\n00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:32.389\nI'll do hosts just cause I\nknow it's a group that I have.\n\n534\n00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:33.013\n>> So you say.\n\n535\n00:27:33.013 --> 00:27:35.860\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well, so I thought, right.\n\n536\n00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:37.230\nEvidently I do not.\n\n537\n00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:37.730\nWow.\n\n538\n00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:44.500\nLet's do a little advanced and find out,\nsee what kinda groups I've got on here.\n\n539\n00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.722\nWe'll do help desk.\n\n540\n00:27:46.722 --> 00:27:48.930\nThat'll work.\n\n541\n00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:52.627\nAll right, so I wanna know when\nthen help desk does something, and\n\n542\n00:27:52.627 --> 00:27:55.430\nthen I've gotta decide\nwhat is that something.\n\n543\n00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:56.960\nWhat do I wanna audit?\n\n544\n00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:00.590\nI wanna know if they make right changes,\nright?\n\n545\n00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:04.130\nIf I do full control,\nthat means even if they read they will,\n\n546\n00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:07.460\nthat will generate\nan entry in my log file.\n\n547\n00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.280\nWell I'm gonna do just right.\n\n548\n00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:14.430\nSo I'm gonna clear all and I'm gonna\nsay anytime they write data or even if\n\n549\n00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:19.650\nthey're, and again this is one where would\nI wanna see if they failed to write data?\n\n550\n00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:23.390\nMaybe, because that would prove that\nmy NTFS settings were working properly.\n\n551\n00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:25.840\nMaybe I want to audit something like that.\n\n552\n00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.690\nIn this case,\nI just want to do success right.\n\n553\n00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:30.638\nAnd I'll go ahead and click OK.\n\n554\n00:28:30.638 --> 00:28:33.970\n>> I guess auditing\nthose failures as well,\n\n555\n00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:36.470\neven if they weren't getting into it\n>> At least you\n\n556\n00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:38.855\ncan see who the little\ntroublemaker is in the group.\n\n557\n00:28:38.855 --> 00:28:39.790\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> And walk over and\n\n558\n00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:41.900\nsay hey we need to have\nourselves a little talk buddy.\n\n559\n00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:46.150\nI've noticed in the logs here that you've\nbeen trying to write to this file and\n\n560\n00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:46.715\nthat's a no no.\n\n561\n00:28:46.715 --> 00:28:47.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Exactly right.\n\n562\n00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.900\nI mean that's a very good point.\n\n563\n00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:53.670\nIf your company says we want to know\nwho's even trying to make those changes,\n\n564\n00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:55.400\nthen you would need to do that.\n\n565\n00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.840\nAnd I'll click ok and I'll click ok and\nI'll click ok on that.\n\n566\n00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:00.631\nNow.\n[COUGH].\n\n567\n00:29:00.631 --> 00:29:01.320\nExcuse me.\n\n568\n00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:04.600\nWhere was I going with that.\n\n569\n00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.330\nRemember though there's two parts to this.\n\n570\n00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:11.450\nI can go to any server and do what I\njust did, but if I didn't make the group\n\n571\n00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:16.220\npolicy an active directory that enabled\nobject access auditing It wouldn't work.\n\n572\n00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:17.980\nIt wouldn't actually do anything.\n\n573\n00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:19.500\nYou have to do both parts.\n\n574\n00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:22.650\nIf in that group policy I\nhad only checked failure.\n\n575\n00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:25.240\nAnd then here I come and\nsay hey I wanna audit success and\n\n576\n00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:29.850\nfailure on this resource, it wouldn't\naudit the success only the failure.\n\n577\n00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:32.780\nSo you have to do both halves\nof that auditing policy.\n\n578\n00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:36.120\nNow you know what I've just thought Daniel\nlet's change that just a little bit so\n\n579\n00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:38.440\nwe can get an example\nof what happens here.\n\n580\n00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:42.650\nSo I'm gonna go back in here and\nclick advanced, and go back to auditing,\n\n581\n00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:44.620\nand I'm gonna click edit.\n\n582\n00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:49.300\nAnd I'm gonna add my authenticated\nusers cause that'd be everybody.\n\n583\n00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:53.710\nAnd I'm gonna audit a full control for\nthat one, all right?\n\n584\n00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:56.541\nJust so we can see some entries cause I\ndon't think I have anybody in that help\n\n585\n00:29:56.541 --> 00:29:57.772\ndesk that I can log on as.\n\n586\n00:29:57.772 --> 00:30:00.213\n>> Mm.\n>> So now that I've set that up,\n\n587\n00:30:00.213 --> 00:30:04.056\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\ndouble click on this guy.\n\n588\n00:30:04.056 --> 00:30:09.597\nAnd I'm gonna type in there [SOUND],\nand I'll save that.\n\n589\n00:30:12.681 --> 00:30:15.290\nAnd I'll close that file.\n\n590\n00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:18.020\nAnd let's go see what\nhappened to my auditing.\n\n591\n00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.140\nSo the next question is where\ndoes this stuff get stored?\n\n592\n00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:22.970\nWhen you do auditing,\nwhere do I go to find it?\n\n593\n00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:24.790\nWell, it's in your event logs system.\n\n594\n00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:29.690\nSo I'm gonna go over here\nto administrative tools and\n\n595\n00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:31.720\nI go up to event viewer.\n\n596\n00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:36.170\nAnd in the event viewer system,\nall auditing goes in to the security log,\n\n597\n00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:37.870\nall right?\n\n598\n00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:41.080\nAnd here's where I'm\ngonna find those events.\n\n599\n00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:44.096\nNow let's see if we can find\none that's pertinent here.\n\n600\n00:30:44.096 --> 00:30:48.013\nThere I got lab administrator,\nWindows Explorer and\n\n601\n00:30:48.013 --> 00:30:54.030\nthere's an entry right there where I see\nan attempt was made to access the object.\n\n602\n00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:54.720\nWho was it?\n\n603\n00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.710\nThe administrator.\n\n604\n00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.530\nWhat was it?\n\n605\n00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:01.930\nIt was a file called hand book dot txt.\n\n606\n00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:02.529\n>> He's fired.\n\n607\n00:31:02.529 --> 00:31:04.610\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly, right?\n\n608\n00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:06.380\nWhat permission did it request?\n\n609\n00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:10.380\nRead, all right, so this is the kinda\nthing that I can see in there.\n\n610\n00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:15.310\nNow, one of the, as I said, you wanna\nmake sure you define your policies well.\n\n611\n00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:19.490\nThink about it, because these can end\nup generating very large log files.\n\n612\n00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:20.660\nNot that I'm worried about the space.\n\n613\n00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:22.050\nThese are tiny entries.\n\n614\n00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:24.930\nThey're not gonna take up a lot of space,\nbut\n\n615\n00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:28.660\nfinding the important\ninformation can be difficult.\n\n616\n00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:32.620\nAlso the other thing that\nthey call out is saving and\n\n617\n00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:35.590\nclearing these logs, and\nlet's take a look at that.\n\n618\n00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:39.710\nWhen you go to clear this log, almost,\n\n619\n00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:41.960\nI can't think of a single\ntime I would ever clear it.\n\n620\n00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.050\nWithout saving it.\n\n621\n00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:44.220\nThis is your record.\n\n622\n00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.290\nIn fact, probably,\nyour regulations, industry and\n\n623\n00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:49.820\ngovernment regulations, are gonna say you\nneed to keep this stuff for ten years.\n\n624\n00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:53.600\nBut I don't want one big old long\nlist of two million entries [LAUGH],\n\n625\n00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.900\nafter five years or something.\n\n626\n00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:57.940\nSo we do need to clear it once in awhile.\n\n627\n00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:01.570\nSo I can choose save and clear,\nand I can go and store that.\n\n628\n00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:03.120\nI'll just leave in my documents here.\n\n629\n00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:06.460\nAnd I'll call it security log or\nsomething like that.\n\n630\n00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:09.290\nProbably come up with a good naming\nconvention with a date and time stamp.\n\n631\n00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:10.610\nSomething like that.\n\n632\n00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:12.630\nClick save.\nNotice that the first thing that happens\n\n633\n00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:17.210\nis that a new entry gets created saying\nhey, somebody cleared the log file, and\n\n634\n00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:18.870\ntells you who it was.\n\n635\n00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:19.450\nAlright?\n\n636\n00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:20.860\nThat's what the bad guys want to do.\n\n637\n00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:24.480\nThey want to clear the log\nfiles to erase any track.\n\n638\n00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.370\nOr any trace of them ever being there.\n\n639\n00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:29.930\nNow that I've cleared it, I want to\ngo back to that file one more time.\n\n640\n00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:32.781\nWhere did I create that guy here.\n\n641\n00:32:32.781 --> 00:32:38.200\nC colon docs handbook and\nI'm just gonna type in there\n\n642\n00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:47.180\nclose it, save it close it, go back\nover to my security log and refresh it.\n\n643\n00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:52.295\nAnd a few entries got created.\n\n644\n00:32:52.295 --> 00:32:55.390\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> That was one person\n\n645\n00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:58.210\nmaking one change to one document.\n\n646\n00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:02.120\nMultiply that by thousands of users,\ntens of thousands of resources\n\n647\n00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:05.040\nthat are occurring all day long,\nchanges occurring all day long, and\n\n648\n00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:10.290\nyou start to get the idea why it's so\nimportant to only audit [LAUGH] what\n\n649\n00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:13.200\nyou need, and\nnot just blanket audit everything.\n\n650\n00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.330\n>> Yeah, that is no doubt.\n\n651\n00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:16.734\nReminds me of you get\nthe email alerts right?\n\n652\n00:33:16.734 --> 00:33:18.171\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> Those automated things.\n\n653\n00:33:18.171 --> 00:33:19.842\n>> Yeah.\n>> You can set those up to send you\n\n654\n00:33:19.842 --> 00:33:23.681\nan email and a lot of administrators they\njust go oh delete that, delete that,\n\n655\n00:33:23.681 --> 00:33:25.634\ndelete, delete, delete.\n\n656\n00:33:25.634 --> 00:33:27.631\nDeletes all this stuff right?\n\n657\n00:33:27.631 --> 00:33:28.875\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> [LAUGH] Well what good is it if\n\n658\n00:33:28.875 --> 00:33:31.390\nyou're not paying attention to\nit because it's overwhelming.\n\n659\n00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:33.550\nYou're drinking from\na fire hose kind of thing.\n\n660\n00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:36.010\nSo you do want to be very specific.\n\n661\n00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:38.990\nNot that you don't set up auditing, but\n\n662\n00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:41.290\nmaybe what you're monitoring\nas far as the auditing goes.\n\n663\n00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:44.997\nAnd the cool things is is that the Windows\noperating system has great tools for\n\n664\n00:33:44.997 --> 00:33:47.806\nus to filter down,\nfind exactly what we're looking for.\n\n665\n00:33:47.806 --> 00:33:51.306\nSo that flood of audits\nisn't such a torrent.\n\n666\n00:33:51.306 --> 00:33:52.773\n[LAUGH].\n>> Absolutely, yeah, and\n\n667\n00:33:52.773 --> 00:33:54.380\nI think we show it in another episode.\n\n668\n00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:56.728\nIf not,\nthere's others in our course library.\n\n669\n00:33:56.728 --> 00:34:00.420\nIf then viewer has a great\nfiltering system built into it.\n\n670\n00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:04.681\nThat you can use to really fine tune\nwhat you're looking at rather than thumb\n\n671\n00:34:04.681 --> 00:34:06.222\nthrough them one at a time.\n\n672\n00:34:06.222 --> 00:34:06.765\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n673\n00:34:06.765 --> 00:34:07.556\nThat's for sure.\n>> That's right.\n\n674\n00:34:07.556 --> 00:34:11.439\nAll right, Mike, thanks so

ITProTV,\n\n3\n00:00:16.157 --> 00:00:17.940\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.920\nJoining me today in the studio today\nis none other than Mike Roderick.\n\n5\n00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.890\nWelcome to the show Mike.\n\n6\n00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.540\nHey, thanks for joining us.\n\n7\n00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.270\nHow are you today?\n\n8\n00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.410\n>> I'm doing great Daniel.\n\n9\n00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.660\nI'm excited to be here.\n\n10\n00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.360\nWe've got our MTA security fundamentals.\n\n11\n00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.100\nComing your way.\n\n12\n00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.110\nAnd in this one,\nwe're gonna be looking at encryption.\n\n13\n00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.910\nAlways a cool topic to talk about.\n\n14\n00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.470\n>> Oh yeah, we love the encryption, right?\n\n15\n00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.336\nIt takes me back to my grade school days,\nwhen you're writing notes and you and\n\n16\n00:00:40.336 --> 00:00:43.615\nyour friends come up with a way to\nmaybe add a little cypher code, so\n\n17\n00:00:43.615 --> 00:00:47.482\nthat you can write notes and pass them in\nclass and the teacher snatches it up and\n\n18\n00:00:47.482 --> 00:00:50.084\nyou're like, yeah,\ngo ahead and take that teach.\n\n19\n00:00:50.084 --> 00:00:51.461\nGood luck figuring that out.\n\n20\n00:00:51.461 --> 00:00:54.330\nAnd it was a lot of fun because\nyou know you kind of got her, but\n\n21\n00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.620\nthat's the basic idea right, that we're.\n\n22\n00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.640\nWe're moving things around,\nso there's a code.\n\n23\n00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.040\nAnd only the people that have the code\nare able to read the message, but\n\n24\n00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.270\nwe're doing it with computers.\n\n25\n00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.090\n>> Exactly right.\n\n26\n00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.440\nI mean, that's what encryption is\nall about is confidentiality, right?\n\n27\n00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.820\nWe've talked in other episodes about\nthe CIA triad, confidentiality.\n\n28\n00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.040\nIntegrity and availability.\n\n29\n00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.950\nConfidentiality is one of the big\nthings that encryption provides.\n\n30\n00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.580\nIt does give us a little bit of\nintegrity because if I can't read,\n\n31\n00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.600\nit understand what it is,\nit's very difficult to modify it and\n\n32\n00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.530\nhave it make sense,\nwhen somebody does decrypt it but the.\n\n33\n00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.290\nPrimary function of encryption is that\nconfidentiality, and what we need to\n\n34\n00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.410\nunderstand is the different methods\nwe could use to do the encryption.\n\n35\n00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.770\nThere are classes or types of encryption\nalgorithms that we could use and\n\n36\n00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.220\nthey have their strengths and\ntheir weaknesses.\n\n37\n00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.940\nAnd places that we're\ngonna see them used in.\n\n38\n00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.940\nAnd for this exam, we're just gonna have\na good foundational knowledge of the way\n\n39\n00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:50.810\nthese guys are working.\n\n40\n00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.160\nWe're not going to break it down in AES or\nTriple DES, or\n\n41\n00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.480\nanything like that and\nsee how it's working in the background.\n\n42\n00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.180\nWe do need to understand what it's doing,\nhow it's accomplishing it.\n\n43\n00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.610\nAnd again, the weaknesses and\n\n44\n00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.030\nthe strengths of these different types of\nencryption that we wanna show you guys.\n\n45\n00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.965\n>> So we don't need PhDs in\nAdvanced Math for this class?\n\n46\n00:02:09.965 --> 00:02:11.260\n[LAUGH]\n>> No Calculus today.\n\n47\n00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.770\n>> All right.\n\n48\n00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.450\nWe're good to go.\n\n49\n00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.020\nI'm with you now.\n\n50\n00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.580\nAll right.\n\n51\n00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.660\nGood, good, good.\n\n52\n00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.270\n>> All right.\n\n53\n00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.030\nSo the first one we wanna talk about\nis gonna be symmetric encryption.\n\n54\n00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.290\nAnd symmetric encryption, when we talk\nabout the word symmetric really means,\n\n55\n00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.160\nthe same on both sides.\n\n56\n00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.270\nAnd symmetric encryption, there's one key.\n\n57\n00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.820\nAnd let's define key and algorithm,\nI guess, before we go any further.\n\n58\n00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.180\nThe algorithm, when we talk about\nan encryption algorithm, that's\n\n59\n00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.840\nthe mathematical formula that's used to\ntake plain text, something that's human\n\n60\n00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.700\nreadable, and turn it into ciphertext,\nsomething that is not human readable,\n\n61\n00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.170\nsomething that I can't read, unless I\ncan decrypt it, remove the encryption.\n\n62\n00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.760\nRight?\nSo that's the algorithm,\n\n63\n00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.140\nand there are several\nalgorithms out there but\n\n64\n00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.360\nwhat you'll find is that we all\nend up using the same ones.\n\n65\n00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.950\nBecause we typically don't pick.\n\n66\n00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.515\nWe use an application and\nthat application is designed to use,\n\n67\n00:03:06.515 --> 00:03:10.025\nAES or Triple DES, or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n68\n00:03:10.025 --> 00:03:15.385\nSo the question then is, how can we all be\nusing the same encryption algorithm but\n\n69\n00:03:15.385 --> 00:03:19.590\nI can't decrypt Daniel's stuff,\nand Daniel can't decrypt my stuff?\n\n70\n00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.810\nAnd that's where the key comes in.\n\n71\n00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.370\nThe key is something that we\ncan plug in to that algorithm,\n\n72\n00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.042\nthat makes it unique to us.\n\n73\n00:03:28.042 --> 00:03:31.160\nI'm gonna use a different\nkey than Danny uses.\n\n74\n00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.960\nIt's just like the lock\non your front door.\n\n75\n00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.600\nYou and your neighbor might use\nthe same brand and model of lock.\n\n76\n00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.810\nLet's say,\nyou've got a Kwikset lock, right?\n\n77\n00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.390\nThey both have the round lock and\na place to put the key in there, and\n\n78\n00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.820\na deadbolt that pops out and tumblers,\nso they're the same algorithm.\n\n79\n00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.190\nBut each of you have a unique key, right?\n\n80\n00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.180\nMy key will open up my door.\n\n81\n00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.960\nBut it won't open up my neighbor's door,\n\n82\n00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.160\neven though they're both Kwikset locks,\nright?\n\n83\n00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.290\nMy neighbor can't come over to my house,\nput his key in my lock, and\n\n84\n00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.490\ntry to get into my house.\n\n85\n00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:02.760\nIt's not gonna work.\n\n86\n00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.050\nDifferent keys with the same algorithm,\nright.\n\n87\n00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.120\nThat's the thought process we're using\nhere when we talk about encryption.\n\n88\n00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.150\nSo now let's take a look at my screen and\n\n89\n00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.430\nsee the different types\nof encryption classes.\n\n90\n00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.730\nSymmetric again,\nbeing the first one and with symmetric,\n\n91\n00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.810\nthere's one key, and\nthat key does the encryption.\n\n92\n00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.080\nAs well as the decryption.\n\n93\n00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.830\nSo we take our plaintext, we plug our\nkey into our encryption algorithm,\n\n94\n00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.570\nwe run that plaintext through there,\nand the output is our ciphertext.\n\n95\n00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.235\nWhen we want to read that or\ndecrypt that information,\n\n96\n00:04:35.235 --> 00:04:39.070\nwe take that ciphertext,\nwe run it back through the same algorithm\n\n97\n00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.130\nusing the same key the we\nused to encrypt it.\n\n98\n00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.730\nAnd we're able to decrypt it and\nget that original text back out.\n\n99\n00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.140\nSo one key to rule them all, right.\n\n100\n00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.030\nThe same key that does the encryption\nalso does the decryption.\n\n101\n00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.010\nThen you've got asymmetric encryption.\n\n102\n00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.490\nAnd asymmetric encryption, asymmetric,\nnot the same on both sides, right?\n\n103\n00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.180\nSo we have two keys.\n\n104\n00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.410\nWe have one key.\n\n105\n00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.330\nWell, we have two keys, and\nthey're really known as a key pair.\n\n106\n00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.380\nThey're mathematically related.\n\n107\n00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.700\nBut what's really cool about them\nis if somebody has one of the keys,\n\n108\n00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.490\nit's mathematically impractical for\n\n109\n00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.730\nthem to figure out what the other key is,\nand that's gonna be important later on.\n\n110\n00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.300\nSo two different keys, a key pair.\n\n111\n00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.480\nAnd when we do our encryption,\nwe'll take our plaintext,\n\n112\n00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.790\nwe will feed it through the encryption\nalgorithm, we'll use one of those keys\n\n113\n00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.670\nalong with that encryption algorithm and\ngenerate our ciphertext.\n\n114\n00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.490\nThen when we wanna get\nthe information back out,\n\n115\n00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.230\nwe'll take that ciphertext, run it back\nthrough that encryption algorithm,\n\n116\n00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:47.450\nuse the other half of the key pair,\nand we end up with the plain text.\n\n117\n00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.760\nSo, the way this key pair works is,\n\n118\n00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:55.270\nwhichever key you use to encrypt it, the\nother key has to be used to decrypt it.\n\n119\n00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.740\nYou can use either key\nto do the encryption.\n\n120\n00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.500\nIf you wanted to call them key A and\nkey B,\n\n121\n00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.840\nwell, I could encrypt the data with key A.\n\n122\n00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.320\nThen I would have to have\nkey B to do the encryption.\n\n123\n00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.310\nI'm sorry, to do the decryption.\n\n124\n00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:14.190\nIf I encrypt it with key B, then I would\nhave to have key A to do the decryption.\n\n125\n00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.630\nNow when we see these in a computer\nenvironment, these keys get named.\n\n126\n00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.900\nWe call one of them our public key and\nwe call the other one the private key.\n\n127\n00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.050\nAgain, they're a key pair, they work\ntogether, one of them we're gonna call our\n\n128\n00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.990\npublic, the other one we're\ngonna call our private key.\n\n129\n00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.250\nAnd we typically get these keys\nin the form of a certificate.\n\n130\n00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:39.190\nA certificate, a digital document that\nties your identity to a key pair, right?\n\n131\n00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:43.090\nIn that certificate is going\nto be your public key.\n\n132\n00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.670\nAnd the other key is gonna be\nknown as your private key.\n\n133\n00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:47.640\nThe public key,\n\n134\n00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.240\nthe name public kinda tells you\neverything you need to know about it.\n\n135\n00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.990\nYou don't care who has your public key.\n\n136\n00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.700\nMy certificate can be loaded\nup in the active directory, so\n\n137\n00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:01.268\nthat any other user on my network can find\nmy certificate and get my public key.\n\n138\n00:07:01.268 --> 00:07:05.640\nI can email it out to anybody in the world\nand post it on websites, I don't care,\n\n139\n00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.920\nit's my public key,\nI want people to have my public key.\n\n140\n00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.395\nMy private key has to remain private.\n\n141\n00:07:13.395 --> 00:07:16.395\nIt's stored in a hidden location\nin my user profile, and\n\n142\n00:07:16.395 --> 00:07:17.885\nit has to remain private.\n\n143\n00:07:17.885 --> 00:07:20.267\nIf anybody gets that, it's shot.\n\n144\n00:07:20.267 --> 00:07:25.370\nI'm gonna have to get new set of key pair\nor a new key pair, and start all over.\n\n145\n00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:29.390\nSo public key, part of my certificate,\nI can give that to anybody.\n\n146\n00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:34.280\nPrivate key, stored my user profile,\nhas to remain private.\n\n147\n00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.700\nAll right?\n\n148\n00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:39.920\nThen there's one more class of\nalgorithms we should talk about, and\n\n149\n00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.750\nthat is hashing algorithms.\n\n150\n00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:46.287\nWe're gonna see where that plays in just\na little bit, but a hashing algorithm's\n\n151\n00:07:46.287 --> 00:07:50.777\na little bit different in the fact,\nthat it doesn't actually encrypt the data.\n\n152\n00:07:50.777 --> 00:07:57.530\nWhen you run plain text through a hash\nalgorithm, the output is a message digest.\n\n153\n00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:02.860\nIt's a fixed length string that\nbasically represents the data.\n\n154\n00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.810\nBut the data itself is still unencrypted.\n\n155\n00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.230\nIt's still plain text, all right.\n\n156\n00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.320\nAnd we'll see this used a lot\nof times in signatures.\n\n157\n00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.790\nWe're gonna talk about that.\n\n158\n00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:16.460\nAnd it's a way to verify integrity.\n\n159\n00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:17.890\nThe way these hashes work,\n\n160\n00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:23.150\nis if I feed data into this\nhashing algorithm, that message\n\n161\n00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:28.720\ndigest that gets spit out is gonna be the\nsame every time I feed that data through.\n\n162\n00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.980\nIf I take this document, feed it through\nthis hashing algorithm three times,\n\n163\n00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:37.290\nit's always gonna generate\nthat same fixed length string.\n\n164\n00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:41.170\nChange one thing in the data\nbefore I feed it through,\n\n165\n00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:44.550\nit's gonna generate a completely\ndifferent hash value.\n\n166\n00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:48.060\nAnd this is a way I can verify if\nsomething has changed, or not.\n\n167\n00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.990\nLike your system does this\nwith your system files.\n\n168\n00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:55.130\nIt runs those system files through a\nhashing algorithm and it saves the output,\n\n169\n00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:56.200\nthat hash value.\n\n170\n00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.050\nAnd every time your system starts up,\nit runs those files threw that hashing\n\n171\n00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:04.800\nalgorithm again, and it compares the\noutput with the one that it saved earlier.\n\n172\n00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.680\nIf those match, then it knows those\nsystem files haven't been modified.\n\n173\n00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:12.280\nIf they don't match anymore,\nthen something's changed.\n\n174\n00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:16.330\nEither corruption or malicious intent,\n\n175\n00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.340\nsomething has changed those file,\nand that's how it can detect those.\n\n176\n00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.520\nSo three different classes of encryption.\n\n177\n00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.970\nYour encryption algorithms,\n\n178\n00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:28.140\nyou've got your symmetric, one key does\nboth the encryption and the decryption.\n\n179\n00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.810\nYou've got your asymmetric where\nyou've got a key pair, your public and\n\n180\n00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.030\nprivate keys.\n\n181\n00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.600\nOne key does the encryption,\nthe other key does the decryption.\n\n182\n00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.800\nAnd then you've got your\nhashing algorithms,\n\n183\n00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:43.080\nwhich don't actually encrypt the data,\nbut they do spit out a hash value\n\n184\n00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.860\nthat can let me verify whether that\nfile has been modified or not.\n\n185\n00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:47.460\n>> Awesome.\n\n186\n00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.110\nNow Mike, you've showed us kind\nof the theory behind this.\n\n187\n00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:50.898\nIs there a better,\n\n188\n00:09:50.898 --> 00:09:53.820\nmore practical way in which we could\nexplain this to our good viewers?\n\n189\n00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:54.725\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n190\n00:09:54.725 --> 00:09:55.830\n>> Let's see how it plays out.\n\n191\n00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:59.082\nSo now that we understand what's going\non with those different classes,\n\n192\n00:09:59.082 --> 00:10:01.032\nlet's see what would\nhappen if we use them.\n\n193\n00:10:01.032 --> 00:10:06.906\nI've got my drawing here\nthat I can show you guys.\n\n194\n00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:08.253\nGet the right one open.\n\n195\n00:10:11.412 --> 00:10:14.920\nAll right, and let's start with\ngood old symmetric encryption.\n\n196\n00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.400\nI'll get rid of these ugly grid lines for\nyou.\n\n197\n00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.610\nSo, with symmetric encryption,\n\n198\n00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:23.260\nlet's say that Alice wants to send\nan encrypted document over to Bob.\n\n199\n00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:28.340\nAnd whatever applications she's using is\nusing a symmetric encryption algorithm.\n\n200\n00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:29.910\nWell, when she takes that document and\n\n201\n00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:33.530\ngoes to encrypt it,\nit's gonna generate a symmetric key.\n\n202\n00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:38.560\nAnd it's gonna use that key along with\nthat algorithm to encrypt that document.\n\n203\n00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:43.000\nAnd then Alice is going to send\nthe encrypted document over to Bob.\n\n204\n00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.940\nSo now Bob's got an encrypted\ncopy of this document.\n\n205\n00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.480\nBut Daniel,\nwhat does he need to decrypt it, then?\n\n206\n00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.740\n>> Well he's going to need the key, right?\n\n207\n00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.100\nThe key that goes along\nwith that document,\n\n208\n00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.780\nbecause of the encryption, and then.\n\n209\n00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.080\nKey will unencrypt it and\nhe will be able to read the document.\n\n210\n00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:56.890\n>> Exactly.\n\n211\n00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:59.820\nHe needs the key that she used\nto encrypt it the first place,\n\n212\n00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:04.470\nsymmetric encryption, the key that does\nthe encryption also does the decryption.\n\n213\n00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:07.030\nSo now that Bob's got the document,\nshe has to follow it up and\n\n214\n00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:11.370\nsend Bob the key she used to encrypt\nthe document in the first place.\n\n215\n00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:15.011\nWell, the problem with this is\nthat key distribution part.\n\n216\n00:11:15.011 --> 00:11:17.156\nAll right, because what if Mr.\n\n217\n00:11:17.156 --> 00:11:22.920\nBad Guy here intercepts a copy of that\ndocument as it's being sent over to Bob.\n\n218\n00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:26.600\nNow the attacker has a copy\nof that encrypted file.\n\n219\n00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.540\nThen Alice has to send the key to Bob, and\n\n220\n00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:32.780\nthe bad guy intercepts\na copy of the key as well.\n\n221\n00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.980\nSo can the bad guy now read that document?\n\n222\n00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.110\nAbsolutely, right?\n\n223\n00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:38.810\nHe's got the encrypted document.\n\n224\n00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:41.080\nHe's got the key that\nwas used to encrypt it.\n\n225\n00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.160\nHe can now decrypt the file as well.\n\n226\n00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.470\nSo that's a problem with\nsymmetric encryption.\n\n227\n00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:49.280\nSymmetric algorithms are very lightweight,\nthey don't take a lot of processing power\n\n228\n00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.390\nto do so they're good at\nencrypting bulk amounts of data.\n\n229\n00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:55.646\nBut key distribution\nbecomes a real problem.\n\n230\n00:11:55.646 --> 00:11:59.878\nI gotta figure out some way to get that\nkey to the other side where nobody\n\n231\n00:11:59.878 --> 00:12:01.090\ncan intercept it.\n\n232\n00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:02.858\nAnd that usually means separate channels.\n\n233\n00:12:02.858 --> 00:12:07.739\nLike if I email the document to Bob,\nthen I'm gonna have to call him up and\n\n234\n00:12:07.739 --> 00:12:09.820\ngive him the key that way.\n\n235\n00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:11.300\nAll right, or something like that.\n\n236\n00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:14.350\nCan't use the same method,\nbecause the bad guy could intercept them,\n\n237\n00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:16.380\nand then get access to that content.\n\n238\n00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:20.060\n>> Now Mike, where do we normally see\nthis symmetric type of encryption?\n\n239\n00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.760\n>> There's several algorithms out there.\n\n240\n00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.890\nTriple dez, AES,\n\n241\n00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:27.080\nthese will be some examples of some\nsymmetric encryption algorithms.\n\n242\n00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.460\nAnd they are used.\n\n243\n00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:32.740\nBut they're used in a way where\nwe can protect that key, and\n\n244\n00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:34.920\nI'll show you what I mean\nhere in just a little bit.\n\n245\n00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:36.940\nNow asymmetric,\n\n246\n00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:41.410\nif we take that same scenario, Alice wants\nto send Bob an encrypted document, but\n\n247\n00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:46.230\nthis time she's gonna use an application\nthat's using asymmetric encryption.\n\n248\n00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:47.930\nLet's see how that pans out.\n\n249\n00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:49.590\nAlice takes her document,\n\n250\n00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:54.340\nshe wants to encrypt it, what she's\ngonna do is not use her key pair, right.\n\n251\n00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:59.410\nRemember asymmetric key pair, gotta\na public key, and you got a private key.\n\n252\n00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:02.920\nWell instead of using her key pair,\nwhat Alice is gonna do is say,\n\n253\n00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.400\nhey Bob, send me you certificate.\n\n254\n00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.810\nRemember I said anybody can\nhave your certificate, in fact,\n\n255\n00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:11.620\nAlice can probably just browse Active\nDirectory if it's a domain environment,\n\n256\n00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:15.710\nand get a copy of Bob's certificate and\ntherefore get his public key.\n\n257\n00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:19.510\nWell, she's gonna use Bob's public\nkey that's in that certificate\n\n258\n00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:21.020\nto encrypt the document.\n\n259\n00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:23.980\nThen she's gonna send that\ndocument over to Bob.\n\n260\n00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:29.620\nWell if I used if Alice used\nBob's public key to encrypt it,\n\n261\n00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.560\nwhat key is needed to decrypt it?\n\n262\n00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.110\nBob's private key, right?\n\n263\n00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.480\nThe other half of the key pair.\n\n264\n00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.590\nAnd since Bob already has the private key,\nthat's in his profile,\n\n265\n00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:44.410\nnobody else gets a copy of that,\nI don't have to send a key to Bob at all.\n\n266\n00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:48.680\nSo even if the bad guy intercepts\na copy of that encrypted document, he's\n\n267\n00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:52.380\nnever gonna be able to decrypt it, because\nhe doesn't have access to Bob's key.\n\n268\n00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.150\nBob's key is already with Bob.\n\n269\n00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:57.390\nIt doesn't have to be sent,\ntransmitted, anything like that.\n\n270\n00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:02.770\nSo asymmetric encryption alleviates\nthat problem of key distribution.\n\n271\n00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:06.550\nWe can get that other person's public key,\nuse that to encrypt it.\n\n272\n00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:09.430\nAnd now I don't care who\nintercepts the document,\n\n273\n00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:13.000\nbecause as long as Bob's kept his\nprivate key private, we should say that.\n\n274\n00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.010\nIf he shared out or lost control of\nthat private key, now we're in trouble.\n\n275\n00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:21.080\nI said you have to keep the private\nkey private, or none of this works.\n\n276\n00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.850\nSo as long as he's done his job and kept\nthat private key private, doesn't matter\n\n277\n00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:28.500\nwho gets a copy of the document, only\nBob is going to be able to decrypt it.\n\n278\n00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.580\n>> Now, the public key,\nthat's a different story.\n\n279\n00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:34.630\nYou can post that bad boy on a website,\nget a billboard and slap it up.\n\n280\n00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:35.450\nThat is fine.\n\n281\n00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.080\nThat's the public key.\n\n282\n00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:40.270\nYou want people to have that key so\nthey can encrypt stuff and send it to you,\n\n283\n00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:42.080\nand then only you can read it.\n\n284\n00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.497\nAnd now obviously we're gonna have to,\nthere still is, I guess,\n\n285\n00:14:45.497 --> 00:14:46.725\na bit of a key exchange.\n\n286\n00:14:46.725 --> 00:14:49.279\nWell, a weird of saying it.\n\n287\n00:14:49.279 --> 00:14:51.394\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If Mike has a key pair and\n\n288\n00:14:51.394 --> 00:14:55.060\nI have a key pair,\nwhat do I need to encrypt stuff for Mike?\n\n289\n00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:59.660\nI need his public key, which he publishes\nand makes available widely for everyone.\n\n290\n00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:00.970\nI also need to do the same.\n\n291\n00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:04.480\nI need to create a key pair, so\nMike can encrypt stuff for me.\n\n292\n00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.980\nSo I've heard of having like key exchange\nparties and stuff like that, and\n\n293\n00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.700\nthere are servers out\nthere you can use as well.\n\n294\n00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.570\n>> Absolutely, and that's the thing,\nis we just have to share our public key.\n\n295\n00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:15.539\nIn fact, in a corporate environment,\n\n296\n00:15:15.539 --> 00:15:19.500\nwe're probably gonna issue key pairs\nto all of our users out of the box.\n\n297\n00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:23.840\nThat's just a part of the on-boarding\nprocess for new employees, right?\n\n298\n00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.580\nThey get issued a certificate and\na private key, and\n\n299\n00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.350\nthen their certificate gets\nstored in Active Directory so\n\n300\n00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:35.240\nthat any user can access any other user's\npublic key, and we can use this to\n\n301\n00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:40.790\nencrypt data and send data back and forth,\nor share encrypted files, or use EFS.\n\n302\n00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:42.938\nWhich is what we wanna talk about next,\nright?\n\n303\n00:15:42.938 --> 00:15:47.721\nEFS, or encrypting file system,\nis a property of NTFS.\n\n304\n00:15:47.721 --> 00:15:51.350\nIt's a way that I can encrypt\nfiles on an NTFS partition, or\n\n305\n00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:55.577\nan NTFS Formatted volume and\nlet's take a look at the way that works.\n\n306\n00:15:55.577 --> 00:15:59.584\nIt actually uses a combination\nof symmetric and asymmetric.\n\n307\n00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:02.998\nRemember, the big advantage to\nsymmetric is, it's really fast.\n\n308\n00:16:02.998 --> 00:16:05.910\nIt doesn't take a lot of\nprocessing power to do, so\n\n309\n00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:08.709\nit's great at encrypting\nbulk amounts of data.\n\n310\n00:16:08.709 --> 00:16:11.774\nDownside, it's got that\nkey distribution issue.\n\n311\n00:16:11.774 --> 00:16:15.937\nAsymmetric, typically a much more\ncomplex mathematical formula,\n\n312\n00:16:15.937 --> 00:16:18.890\ncuz it's go this key pair\nthat it's able to use.\n\n313\n00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:23.615\nIt's a little bit slower and it's a lot\nmore intensive on the processor, but\n\n314\n00:16:23.615 --> 00:16:26.610\nit doesn't have the issue\nof key distribution.\n\n315\n00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:29.269\nSo, advantages and disadvantages of both.\n\n316\n00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:34.074\nEFS, my Encrypting File System\nuses both of them in combination.\n\n317\n00:16:34.074 --> 00:16:38.510\nAnd by combining these two methods,\nwe get some pretty cool results.\n\n318\n00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.500\nLet's take a look at it here.\n\n319\n00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.180\nWhat we're gonna do is I'm gonna\nsay that Alice has a document\n\n320\n00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.320\nthat she wants to encrypt.\n\n321\n00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.965\nSo she can go to the properties\nof that file and\n\n322\n00:16:48.965 --> 00:16:52.795\nshe can right-click on it and\ngo to those advanced attributes and\n\n323\n00:16:52.795 --> 00:16:56.084\nchoose to encrypt the dot\ncontents to secure that data.\n\n324\n00:16:56.084 --> 00:17:00.373\nWhat's gonna happen in the background\nwhen she does this is Windows is gonna\n\n325\n00:17:00.373 --> 00:17:01.923\ngenerate a symmetric key.\n\n326\n00:17:01.923 --> 00:17:05.021\nThis blue one is gonna\nbe my symmetric key and\n\n327\n00:17:05.021 --> 00:17:09.879\nwe're gonna call that the File\nEncryption Key or the FEK for short and\n\n328\n00:17:09.879 --> 00:17:14.600\nit's gonna use that file encryption\nkey to encrypt the document.\n\n329\n00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.372\nSo it's using a nice,\n\n330\n00:17:16.372 --> 00:17:22.448\nfast encryption algorithm to encrypt\nthe entire contents of that document.\n\n331\n00:17:22.448 --> 00:17:27.587\nThat might be a 1 page document, it\nmight be a 100-page document and it uses\n\n332\n00:17:27.587 --> 00:17:33.600\nthat File Encryption Key that symmetric\nkey to do that part of the encryption.\n\n333\n00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:38.454\nThen what it's gonna do is,\nit's going to take a copy of that\n\n334\n00:17:38.454 --> 00:17:44.464\nFile Encryption Key and store it right\nthere in the header of the document.\n\n335\n00:17:44.464 --> 00:17:46.107\nRemember, how symmetric works,\n\n336\n00:17:46.107 --> 00:17:48.948\nthe key that does the encryption\nalso does the decryption.\n\n337\n00:17:48.948 --> 00:17:53.262\nSo it might seem strange, but wait, you're\ntelling me that the key that I need to\n\n338\n00:17:53.262 --> 00:17:56.066\ndecrypt it is stored right\nthere with the document?\n\n339\n00:17:56.066 --> 00:17:56.682\nIt is.\n\n340\n00:17:56.682 --> 00:18:00.546\nIt's put in the Data Decryption Field or\nthe DDF, which is a header for\n\n341\n00:18:00.546 --> 00:18:02.590\nthat document, but it's not done.\n\n342\n00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:04.312\nIt doesn't stop there,\n\n343\n00:18:04.312 --> 00:18:09.440\nthen what it's gonna do is check to\nsee if Alice has a key pair yet.\n\n344\n00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:13.165\nAs I said, most organizations are going\nto issue key pairs to all their users,\n\n345\n00:18:13.165 --> 00:18:15.210\nso they're already gonna have a key pair.\n\n346\n00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:16.731\nIf she does, great.\n\n347\n00:18:16.731 --> 00:18:20.134\nIf she doesn't,\nWindows will generate one on the fly.\n\n348\n00:18:20.134 --> 00:18:23.154\nIn the background when she right-clicks\nand encrypts that document,\n\n349\n00:18:23.154 --> 00:18:24.974\nit'll generate the file encryption key.\n\n350\n00:18:24.974 --> 00:18:29.630\nAnd if she doesn't have a key pair,\nit will make a key pair for her as well.\n\n351\n00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:34.155\nThen what it's gonna do is,\nit's gonna use her public key,\n\n352\n00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:39.305\nthat's part of her certificate to\nencrypt not the entire document,\n\n353\n00:18:39.305 --> 00:18:42.796\nbut just the Data Decryption Field,\nthe DDF.\n\n354\n00:18:42.796 --> 00:18:47.280\nAnd so now, the key that i need to\nencrypt the document is encrypted with\n\n355\n00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.716\nAlice's public key.\n\n356\n00:18:48.716 --> 00:18:51.015\nSo now you start to see,\noh, that makes sense.\n\n357\n00:18:51.015 --> 00:18:53.314\nThat is a little bit more\nsecure than I thought.\n\n358\n00:18:53.314 --> 00:18:56.517\nBecause when somebody tries to\ndouble-click on this document,\n\n359\n00:18:56.517 --> 00:18:57.457\nit's encrypted.\n\n360\n00:18:57.457 --> 00:19:01.400\nThey're gonna need the matching\nprivate key to decrypt.\n\n361\n00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:05.501\nSo when Alice double-clicks on it,\nshe can take her private key,\n\n362\n00:19:05.501 --> 00:19:10.044\ndecrypt the Data Decryption Field,\nretrieve the File Encryption Key and\n\n363\n00:19:10.044 --> 00:19:11.520\ndecrypt the document.\n\n364\n00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.355\nIf anybody else tries to\ndouble-click on this file, well,\n\n365\n00:19:14.355 --> 00:19:17.928\ntheir private key is not gonna be able\nto decrypt the Data Decryption Field.\n\n366\n00:19:17.928 --> 00:19:20.704\nRemember, these are key pairs,\nthey work together.\n\n367\n00:19:20.704 --> 00:19:25.467\nSo somebody else's private key cannot\ndecrypt something that was encrypted with\n\n368\n00:19:25.467 --> 00:19:26.786\nAlice's public key.\n\n369\n00:19:26.786 --> 00:19:27.378\nSee how that works?\n\n370\n00:19:27.378 --> 00:19:28.179\n>> Sound pretty safe.\n\n371\n00:19:28.179 --> 00:19:28.725\n>> It is.\n\n372\n00:19:28.725 --> 00:19:30.640\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And if you think about it,\n\n373\n00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:34.288\nwe are taking advantage of the features\nof each one of these algorithms using\n\n374\n00:19:34.288 --> 00:19:37.309\nthe symmetric encryption algorithm\nto do the bulk of the work,\n\n375\n00:19:37.309 --> 00:19:38.964\nencrypt all the document itself.\n\n376\n00:19:38.964 --> 00:19:43.145\nThe asymmetric encryption is only\nencrypting the file encryption key,\n\n377\n00:19:43.145 --> 00:19:44.385\nnot a symmetric key.\n\n378\n00:19:44.385 --> 00:19:46.497\nSo even though it's\na heavier process power or\n\n379\n00:19:46.497 --> 00:19:49.541\ntakes a little more processing power,\nit's not doing much work.\n\n380\n00:19:49.541 --> 00:19:52.174\nIt's just encrypting\nthe Data Decryption Field,\n\n381\n00:19:52.174 --> 00:19:54.079\nthat's one reason we do it this way.\n\n382\n00:19:54.079 --> 00:19:55.757\nIt's not the only reason though.\n\n383\n00:19:55.757 --> 00:20:02.077\nThe other reason is going to be for\nrecovery purposes and sharing purposes.\n\n384\n00:20:02.077 --> 00:20:07.494\nWhat do you think would happen\nif Alice lost her private key?\n\n385\n00:20:07.494 --> 00:20:10.706\nNow remember, the Data Decryption Field\nis encrypted with her public key, so\n\n386\n00:20:10.706 --> 00:20:12.908\nyou think she can still gain\naccess to that document?\n\n387\n00:20:12.908 --> 00:20:14.244\n>> Alice has lost some data at this point.\n\n388\n00:20:14.244 --> 00:20:16.567\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n389\n00:20:16.567 --> 00:20:18.981\nShe is not getting back\ninto that document,\n\n390\n00:20:18.981 --> 00:20:23.159\nbecause you can't use the public key\nto decrypt the Data Decryption Field,\n\n391\n00:20:23.159 --> 00:20:26.530\nbecause the public key encrypt\nit in the first place.\n\n392\n00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:28.170\nRemember, what we said about asymmetric?\n\n393\n00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:33.023\nWhichever key you use to encrypt it, the\nother key has to be used to decrypt it.\n\n394\n00:20:33.023 --> 00:20:37.886\nSo if she looses her private key, anything\nthat was encrypted with her public key is\n\n395\n00:20:37.886 --> 00:20:42.768\nlost, which is why it's very important to\nbe able to Ctrl+Z and get that key back.\n\n396\n00:20:42.768 --> 00:20:45.600\nUnfortunately, we can't do\nthat in the real world, so\n\n397\n00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.026\nwe need to make sure we're\nbacking up that key.\n\n398\n00:20:48.026 --> 00:20:50.853\nAnd we can do that through\nour certificate snap in,\n\n399\n00:20:50.853 --> 00:20:53.695\nwe can export our certificate and\nour private key.\n\n400\n00:20:53.695 --> 00:20:54.937\nHow do you lose your private key?\n\n401\n00:20:54.937 --> 00:20:58.780\nIt's not like you can leave it laying\non the table or at the restaurant, but\n\n402\n00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.005\nit's in your profile.\n\n403\n00:21:00.005 --> 00:21:03.144\nYou profile can become corrupt,\nsomebody can delete your profile.\n\n404\n00:21:03.144 --> 00:21:06.296\nHard drive can fail,\nthey reinstall the operating system and\n\n405\n00:21:06.296 --> 00:21:08.429\nthat takes out those existing profiles.\n\n406\n00:21:08.429 --> 00:21:11.615\nSo several ways I could end\nup losing that private key,\n\n407\n00:21:11.615 --> 00:21:15.163\ngotta have a backup of the private key,\nhave to keep it safe.\n\n408\n00:21:15.163 --> 00:21:19.064\nBut in a corporate environment,\nwe're not gonna rely on that.\n\n409\n00:21:19.064 --> 00:21:23.754\nI'm not gonna rely on my end users\nbacking up their keys, so we have another\n\n410\n00:21:23.754 --> 00:21:28.305\nmethod to keep this data safe and\nthat's known as a data recovery agent.\n\n411\n00:21:28.305 --> 00:21:32.182\nA data recovery agent\nhas his own key pair.\n\n412\n00:21:32.182 --> 00:21:36.709\nHe has a certificate assigned to him for\nthe purpose of data recovery.\n\n413\n00:21:36.709 --> 00:21:41.609\nAnd anytime anybody encrypts a document,\nit does this process we've just described,\n\n414\n00:21:41.609 --> 00:21:43.408\ncreates a file encryption key.\n\n415\n00:21:43.408 --> 00:21:46.087\nPuts in the data decryption field,\n\n416\n00:21:46.087 --> 00:21:51.180\nuses the user's public key to encrypt\nthe Data Decryption Field and\n\n417\n00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:56.026\nthen it's gonna take another copy\nof that file encryption key.\n\n418\n00:21:56.026 --> 00:22:00.888\nAnd put it in the Data Recovery Field and\nthen I'm going to use my recovery\n\n419\n00:22:00.888 --> 00:22:04.730\nagent's public key to encrypt\nthe Data Recovery Field.\n\n420\n00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:10.320\nSo now, either one of them can\nget access to the document.\n\n421\n00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.455\nAlice can use her private the key,\nthe decrypt the Data Decryption Field,\n\n422\n00:22:14.495 --> 00:22:17.815\nretrieve the File Encryption Key,\ndecrypt the document.\n\n423\n00:22:17.815 --> 00:22:19.975\nIf Alice loses her private key,\n\n424\n00:22:19.975 --> 00:22:25.264\nthe recovery agent can use his private\nkey to decrypt the Data Recovery Field.\n\n425\n00:22:25.264 --> 00:22:28.944\nRetrieve the file encryption key and\ndecrypt the document for hours.\n\n426\n00:22:28.944 --> 00:22:31.544\nSo now, we got a layer of protection.\n\n427\n00:22:31.544 --> 00:22:33.703\nWe got that recovery agent.\n\n428\n00:22:33.703 --> 00:22:38.188\nThis account right here, very few people\nshould know the password to log on as\n\n429\n00:22:38.188 --> 00:22:42.742\na recovery agent, because they will be\nable to decrypt every document that's\n\n430\n00:22:42.742 --> 00:22:46.896\nencrypted on your network as long\nas they've been the recovery agent.\n\n431\n00:22:46.896 --> 00:22:52.738\nSo you don't want that password\ngetting out to that many people.\n\n432\n00:22:52.738 --> 00:22:56.813\nAs I said, another big advantage\nof this is being able to share and\n\n433\n00:22:56.813 --> 00:23:00.161\nit's really the same concept\nof the recovery agent.\n\n434\n00:23:00.161 --> 00:23:04.634\nLet's say, I've got this document is\na secret project we're working on, but\n\n435\n00:23:04.634 --> 00:23:07.392\nAlice isn't the only one\nthat's working on it.\n\n436\n00:23:07.392 --> 00:23:10.762\nThere's other users in my company that\nare helping her with this project.\n\n437\n00:23:10.762 --> 00:23:14.415\nWell, if Alice doesn't come in one day,\nwhat are the other people supposed to do?\n\n438\n00:23:14.415 --> 00:23:18.796\nThey can't decrypt this document,\nit's protected with Alice's key pair.\n\n439\n00:23:18.796 --> 00:23:23.840\nSo we can share encrypted files and\nall Windows is gonna do when you\n\n440\n00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:28.976\ngo to share an encrypted file,\nwe'll move up second user here is,\n\n441\n00:23:28.976 --> 00:23:33.106\nit's gonna create a second\nData Decryption Field and\n\n442\n00:23:33.106 --> 00:23:39.096\nit's gonna take another copy of that\nfile encryption key and put it in there.\n\n443\n00:23:39.096 --> 00:23:43.959\nAnd it's using the second users\npublic key to encrypt the second DDF,\n\n444\n00:23:43.959 --> 00:23:48.341\nso now Alice can decrypt the first DDF and\nopen the document up.\n\n445\n00:23:48.341 --> 00:23:51.328\nThe second user can\ndecrypt the second DDF.\n\n446\n00:23:51.328 --> 00:23:52.852\nOpen up the document.\n\n447\n00:23:52.852 --> 00:23:57.750\nThe recovery agent can decrypt the DRF and\nopen up or recover that document.\n\n448\n00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:01.580\nSo, by using this combination\nof symmetric and asymmetric,\n\n449\n00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:06.640\nwe make it very easy to share\ndocuments amongst users on my network.\n\n450\n00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.450\nAs well as have that\nrecovery agent available,\n\n451\n00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:13.980\nall of which is very important when it\ncomes to EFS because we, as Daniel said,\n\n452\n00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.415\nif we lose that key we lose\naccess to all that information.\n\n453\n00:24:17.415 --> 00:24:19.379\nWe're going to a back up,\nI mean that's the only way.\n\n454\n00:24:19.379 --> 00:24:22.931\nWe're gonna have to try to find a copy\nof that data before it was encrypted.\n\n455\n00:24:22.931 --> 00:24:27.531\n>> Yeah, because if it is encrypted,\nif anybody out there has been bit by that\n\n456\n00:24:27.531 --> 00:24:32.000\ncryptolocker virus or whatever,\nthat is basically what is happening.\n\n457\n00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.200\nYou've basically cryptovirused yourself\nand locked yourself out of that file\n\n458\n00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:40.840\nbecause these algorithms they've used\nto encrypt this stuff is no joke.\n\n459\n00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.550\nYou are unlikely to crack them.\n\n460\n00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:46.120\nAnd when I say unlikely Mike,\nwhat are we talking here?\n\n461\n00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:49.670\nAstronomical type of odds\nto get into this stuff?\n\n462\n00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:53.583\n>> Yeah, I don't think it's been done, I'm\nnot sure but I don't think it's been done.\n\n463\n00:24:53.583 --> 00:24:57.027\n[LAUGH] All right, the next thing\nthey call out on the exam is\n\n464\n00:24:57.027 --> 00:25:01.117\nwhat happens with these encrypted\nfiles if I try to move them around.\n\n465\n00:25:01.117 --> 00:25:05.081\nIn another episode,\nwe talked about explicit permissions and\n\n466\n00:25:05.081 --> 00:25:09.590\nwhat happens to them when we copy and\nmove files on the same volume.\n\n467\n00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:13.640\nAs well as when we go across volumes,\nlike from D: to E:.\n\n468\n00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:17.000\nWe need to understand what happens\nto our encryption when we copy and\n\n469\n00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.640\nmove these files, as well.\n\n470\n00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:22.600\nBest practice from Microsoft says,\nwe don't encrypt documents themselves.\n\n471\n00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.590\nWe encrypt the folder that\ncontains the document.\n\n472\n00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.930\nNow the folder itself\ndoesn't become encrypted,\n\n473\n00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:32.200\ndoesn't get locked out to anybody else,\nbut it's marked as encrypted.\n\n474\n00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:36.420\nSo that any new documents that get out\nin there are automatically encrypted.\n\n475\n00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.130\nAnd it's not tied to a specific user.\n\n476\n00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:41.530\nIf I encrypt a folder, and\nthen Daniel creates a document and\n\n477\n00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:46.030\nthen puts it in that folder, it'll be\nencrypted with Daniel's keys, all right.\n\n478\n00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:48.410\nSo that only he can get access to it,\nnot me.\n\n479\n00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:51.610\nJust because I encrypted the folder\ndoesn't mean I get access to everything\n\n480\n00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:52.530\ninside there.\n\n481\n00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:56.560\nThe documents are still going to be\nencrypted with that users key pair.\n\n482\n00:25:57.650 --> 00:25:59.640\nBut it makes it easy.\n\n483\n00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.520\nThat way, if I dump a file in there\nI don't have to right-click on it and\n\n484\n00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.250\ntry to encrypt it.\n\n485\n00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:06.870\nAs soon as I put it in that encrypted\nfolder it's going to be encrypted.\n\n486\n00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:14.080\nSo when we copy and move these guys\naround, if you stay on the same volume,\n\n487\n00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:18.490\nright, if I copy an encrypted\nfile from one folder to another,\n\n488\n00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:23.210\nit's gonna inherit the destination\nencryption settings.\n\n489\n00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:26.270\nSo if the destination\nfolder is decrypted or\n\n490\n00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:31.290\nnot encrypted, then that copy of that\nfile will not be encrypted any longer.\n\n491\n00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:34.500\nIt's gonna inherit the encryption\nstate of the destination.\n\n492\n00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:41.710\nIf I move it within the same volume,\nthen it will retain its encryption state.\n\n493\n00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:44.600\nSo even if I take an encrypted file, and\n\n494\n00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:47.480\nmove it to somewhere else\non the same volume, and\n\n495\n00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:51.650\nthat somewhere else is not encrypted,\nthe document will remain encrypted.\n\n496\n00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:54.476\nIt will retain its encryption state.\n\n497\n00:26:54.476 --> 00:26:56.515\nAny time I cross volume boundaries,\n\n498\n00:26:56.515 --> 00:26:59.816\nit's going to inherit\nthe destination encryption state.\n\n499\n00:26:59.816 --> 00:27:03.390\nIt doesn't matter if I copy it or move it.\n\n500\n00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:07.960\nAnd the same thing we talked about with\nNTFS permissions is occurring here.\n\n501\n00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.750\nThe only one you have to remember,\n\n502\n00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:14.910\nis moving it within the same volume,\nit's gonna retain its encryption state.\n\n503\n00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:19.600\nAnything else you do, it's gonna inherit\nthe encryption state of the destination.\n\n504\n00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.570\nAnd that's because they're\ndifferent objects, all right,\n\n505\n00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:26.520\nif you copy a file, then the original's\nstill here, the copy is a new object.\n\n506\n00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.930\nSo it's going to inherit the encryption\nstate of its destination.\n\n507\n00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:32.960\nIf I copy it across volumes, same thing.\n\n508\n00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.650\nThe original's still there.\n\n509\n00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:36.340\nThe copy is a new object.\n\n510\n00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:39.290\nIt inherits the encryption\nstate of the destination.\n\n511\n00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:44.844\nIf I move it across volumes,\nit's actually a cut and delete.\n\n512\n00:27:44.844 --> 00:27:48.384\nRight, you're going to cut the original,\nmove it to your clip board,\n\n513\n00:27:48.384 --> 00:27:52.680\ndelete the original, and\nthen paste the original in a new location.\n\n514\n00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.477\nIt's basically a copy and delete.\n\n515\n00:27:54.477 --> 00:27:56.850\nSo it's a new object.\n\n516\n00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:59.490\nIt inherits the destination\nencryption state.\n\n517\n00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:00.590\nMoving it, however,\n\n518\n00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:04.930\nwithin the same volume, doesn't actually\nmess with the original document.\n\n519\n00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:07.950\nIt's just changing the pointer\nwithin the file allocation table\n\n520\n00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:09.720\nto where the document's located.\n\n521\n00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.955\nSo the encryption state stays the same.\n\n522\n00:28:11.955 --> 00:28:15.095\nSo that's the only one that\nyou really have to remember.\n\n523\n00:28:15.095 --> 00:28:17.035\nThe rest are going to be inherent.\n\n524\n00:28:18.467 --> 00:28:21.755\nAll right, let's take a look,\nDaniel, at one other place that we\n\n525\n00:28:21.755 --> 00:28:26.470\ncommonly see encryption used, and\nthey call this out on the exam, and\n\n526\n00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:32.170\nthat's gonna be digital signatures or\nemail signatures.\n\n527\n00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:38.090\nSo, what's happening when you decide\nto add a signature to an email?\n\n528\n00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:42.056\n>> That's where I put my little name, and\nit has my extension and all that, right?\n\n529\n00:28:42.056 --> 00:28:42.760\nMy contact info.\n\n530\n00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:43.499\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly,\n\n531\n00:28:43.499 --> 00:28:44.852\ngot you a little logo down there.\n\n532\n00:28:44.852 --> 00:28:45.432\n>> That's it.\n\n533\n00:28:45.432 --> 00:28:46.152\n>> And all that good stuff.\n\n534\n00:28:46.152 --> 00:28:49.175\n>> It's easy.\n>> [LAUGH] Now when we digitally sign\n\n535\n00:28:49.175 --> 00:28:55.380\nan email, what we're trying to do is\nprovide what we call non-repudiation.\n\n536\n00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:59.010\nMeaning that we can verify the sender,\nright?\n\n537\n00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:03.270\nJust like when you sign a form,\nyou're putting your signature on there and\n\n538\n00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:06.540\nyou've now signed it, you've agreed\nto whatever that form is, and\n\n539\n00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:09.820\nyou can't deny it anymore because\nit's got your signature on there.\n\n540\n00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:13.990\nThat's what signing an e-mail does for\nme, is it's tying my identity the email.\n\n541\n00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:17.830\nIt allows the receiver\nto verify the identity\n\n542\n00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:21.030\nof the originator of that data, right.\n\n543\n00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:25.935\nIt also give us the ability to figure\nout if the document has changed or not.\n\n544\n00:29:25.935 --> 00:29:27.391\nSo it does a couple of things for us.\n\n545\n00:29:27.391 --> 00:29:30.212\nAnd let's see the way that works.\n\n546\n00:29:30.212 --> 00:29:33.282\nIf Alice wants to digitally sign an email,\n\n547\n00:29:33.282 --> 00:29:37.887\nthen what she's going to do is\nshe's going to take that email and\n\n548\n00:29:37.887 --> 00:29:43.060\nrun it through a hashing algorithm and\ngenerate a hash value.\n\n549\n00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:44.630\nRemember how hashing algorithms work.\n\n550\n00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:46.610\nThey don't actually encrypt the data.\n\n551\n00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:48.580\nThey just spit out a hash value.\n\n552\n00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:52.320\nSo let's say we're using something\nlike MD5 or Message Digest 5.\n\n553\n00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.530\nWe take that email.\n\n554\n00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:59.440\nWe run it through this hashing\nalgorithm and we generate a hash value.\n\n555\n00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.900\nThen we're gonna take that hash value and\n\n556\n00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:05.610\nwe're gonna stick it in a little\nfield in the footer of that email.\n\n557\n00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:09.130\nSo you've still got the email,\nplain text, not encrypted.\n\n558\n00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:13.690\nBut then I've got this hash value that\nI tack onto the end of that email.\n\n559\n00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:20.550\nThen Alice is gonna use her private key,\nto encrypt the hash value.\n\n560\n00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:22.260\nNot the entire document.\n\n561\n00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:23.580\nJust that hash value.\n\n562\n00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:29.340\nAnd now she's applied a digital\nsignature to this email.\n\n563\n00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.150\nWhat the heck does that do for us?\n\n564\n00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:32.980\nWell let's check it out.\n\n565\n00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:39.350\nIf Bob receives this email,\nwhat he's gonna do is he's going to,\n\n566\n00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:42.240\nhe thinks it's from Alice but\nhe wants to verify that.\n\n567\n00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:48.260\nWell, Bob is gonna get Alice's certificate\nwhich contains her public key.\n\n568\n00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:50.760\nRemember the way asymmetric works.\n\n569\n00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.680\nIf I encrypt it with one key,\n\n570\n00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:56.470\nthe only key that can decrypt it\nis the other half of the key pair.\n\n571\n00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:59.940\nIf she encrypted this\nwith her private key,\n\n572\n00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:04.230\nthen the only key that can decrypt it,\nis Alice's public key.\n\n573\n00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:08.640\nSo if Bob can successfully\nuse Alice's public key\n\n574\n00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:13.860\nto decrypt that hash value,\nand get that hash value out,,\n\n575\n00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:18.260\nthen it had to be encrypted with\nAlice's private key in the first place.\n\n576\n00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:21.980\nAnd the only person that has\nAlice's private key is Alice.\n\n577\n00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:24.470\nWhich means that this email\nhad to come from Alice.\n\n578\n00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:27.210\nAll right, that's that non-repudiation.\n\n579\n00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:32.690\nNow Bob has this hash value, and what\nhe's going to do is take the email and\n\n580\n00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:36.360\nrun it through the same algorithm and\ngenerate his own hash value.\n\n581\n00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:40.850\nAnd then he is going to compare the one\nthat Alice sent with the email and\n\n582\n00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:42.600\nthe one that he just generated.\n\n583\n00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:47.870\nIf those match exactly, then he now knows\nthat the email has not been modified.\n\n584\n00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:51.220\nIt's exactly the same\nas when Alice sent it.\n\n585\n00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:55.920\nIf these two didn't match, then something\nhappened to that email during transit.\n\n586\n00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:56.730\nCould be malicious.\n\n587\n00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:59.680\nCould be just normal data corruption or\nsomething like that.\n\n588\n00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.742\nBut either way.\n\n589\n00:32:00.742 --> 00:32:01.745\n>> It.\n>> Yeah.\n\n590\n00:32:01.745 --> 00:32:03.940\n[LAUGH]\n>> He'll break an anvil, that boy.\n\n591\n00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.579\n[LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n592\n00:32:05.579 --> 00:32:08.643\neither way I know something has changed.\n\n593\n00:32:08.643 --> 00:32:12.195\nIt's just not what Alice intended for\nme to receive, and I can say hey Alice,\n\n594\n00:32:12.195 --> 00:32:14.200\nthat email didn't come through.\n\n595\n00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.240\nSend it to me again, all right?\n\n596\n00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.790\nSo email signatures give us two things.\n\n597\n00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:22.620\nThey give us that non-repudiation,\nI was able to validate or\n\n598\n00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:28.210\nverify the identity of the sender, it did\ncome from Alice, as well as integrity,\n\n599\n00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:33.490\nI was able to verify that that document\nhad not been modified during transit.\n\n600\n00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:38.560\nSo just another way we see a combination\nof these encryptions being used.\n\n601\n00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:42.700\nIn this case, we're using hashing and\nasymmetric encryption.\n\n602\n00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:43.660\n>> Awesome stuff.\n\n603\n00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:46.850\nObviously, encryption is a very handy,\ndandy thing to have sticking around,\n\n604\n00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:49.850\ncuz we want to be able to do\nthose things like nonrepudiation.\n\n605\n00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:51.780\nWe wanna verify that integrity.\n\n606\n00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:54.750\nAnd sometimes we just don't want people\nbeing able to see or look at data,\n\n607\n00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:57.090\nbecause it's sensitive information.\n\n608\n00:32:57.090 --> 00:32:59.090\nSo encryption is definitely here to stay,\nso\n\n609\n00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:01.900\nit does help us to\nunderstand how they work.\n\n610\n00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:04.390\nMike, you've done a great job so\nfar of showing us.\n\n611\n00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:06.574\nI'm seeing the light, it's making it easy,\n\n612\n00:33:06.574 --> 00:33:08.656\nI didn't need a math\ndegree to do it either.\n\n613\n00:33:08.656 --> 00:33:09.283\n>> I told you.\n\n614\n00:33:09.283 --> 00:33:10.537\n>> That's right.\n>> No calculators here.\n\n615\n00:33:10.537 --> 00:33:11.582\n>> It's been good so far.\n\n616\n00:33:11.582 --> 00:33:13.272\nNow I know we got plenty\nmore to go through, so\n\n617\n00:33:13.272 --> 00:33:16.040\nit looks like we're gonna have to\ndo a part two on this episode.\n\n618\n00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.387\nBut there's a lot more\nfun to come up ahead.\n\n619\n00:33:18.387 --> 00:33:19.513\nHopefully, we'll see you there.\n\n620\n00:33:19.513 --> 00:33:21.290\nThanks for those demonstrations, Mike.\n\n621\n00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:22.900\n>> You're welcome.\n>> We're gonna go ahead and sign off for\n\n622\n00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:23.830\nthis episode, though.\n\n623\n00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:26.680\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n624\n00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:27.330\n>> And

00:00:13.610\nGreetings everyone.\n\n5\n00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.840\nWelcome to another exciting\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.100\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.262\nJoining me on the show again today\nis none other than Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:21.262 --> 00:00:22.570\nHow's it going today Mike?\n\n9\n00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.980\n>> It's going great, Daniel.\n\n10\n00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.008\nI'm excited to be here as always.\n\n11\n00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:29.590\nWe've got our MTA content coming your way,\nour security fundamentals and\n\n12\n00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.670\nwe're continuing on\ntalking about encryption.\n\n13\n00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.320\nA fun filled topic that we love to\nspend time on here at IT Pro TV.\n\n14\n00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.860\n>> That's right.\n\n15\n00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.250\nWe went over in the previous episode.\n\n16\n00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.260\nIf you didn't see that.\n\n17\n00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.750\nHello, a lot of good topics there,\nsome foundational knowledge.\n\n18\n00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.650\nSo, if you're jumping in here, it might\nbe a good idea to watch that episode but\n\n19\n00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.980\nI'm sure we'll kick around some terms and\nterminology as well in this one.\n\n20\n00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.990\nSo, you might not be too lost but the good\nthing is we're moving on from there.\n\n21\n00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.270\nWe're moving into the more\npractical side of things.\n\n22\n00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.040\nWe understand what an encryption is and\nhow we implement this thing but actually,\n\n23\n00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.820\nMicrosoft has given us a lot\ncool ways to do it, and\n\n24\n00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.970\nMike your going to demonstrate that for\nus today right?\n\n25\n00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.730\n>> Exactly,\nI'm going to show you a little bit of EFS.\n\n26\n00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.810\nLike Daniel said in another\nepisode we Describe DFS,\n\n27\n00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.990\nwe've broke down how it works.\n\n28\n00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.700\nNow we're gonna take a look at actually\nimplementing it as well as something known\n\n29\n00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.830\nas full disk encryption, which in the\nMicrosoft world is known as Bitlocker and\n\n30\n00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.340\nthey're gonna call that\nout on the exams and\n\n31\n00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.190\nwe are definitely going to\ntake a look at that as well.\n\n32\n00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.300\nLet's start with EFS.\n\n33\n00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.590\nYou know again EFS my encrypting\nfile system is a part of NTFS.\n\n34\n00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.550\nSo, when you format a volume using the\nNTFS file system, that gives you access to\n\n35\n00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.420\nEFS the encrypting file system and\nit is really easy to do.\n\n36\n00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.070\nIn fact, it requires no configuration\nwhich is both a good thing and\n\n37\n00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.060\na bad thing.\n\n38\n00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.220\nSo, let's talk about why it's good and\n\n39\n00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.811\nthen I'll point out why it's\nbad [LAUGH] for you guys.\n\n40\n00:01:47.811 --> 00:01:50.150\nLet's take a look at my screen here.\n\n41\n00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.640\nNEFS is really simple to do, in fact,\nI'll just do it right here on my desktop.\n\n42\n00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.020\nI'm gonna create a New Text document and\nI'll call it our\n\n43\n00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.050\nEFS test and\nI'm simply going to right click on it and\n\n44\n00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.665\nchoose properties and then I'm going to\ngo over to the advanced attribute tabs.\n\n45\n00:02:08.665 --> 00:02:12.460\nSo, down here at the bottom I've got my\nstandard attributes, read only and hidden.\n\n46\n00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.940\nNext set I have got my advanced button,\nin here I can either compress or\n\n47\n00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.810\nencrypt the file and I am going to choose\nto encrypt contents to secure data.\n\n48\n00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.350\nNow a little bit of a goof in my\nopinion with this user interface here,\n\n49\n00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.530\nproper etiquette says radio buttons\nwhen you can only select one like VISA,\n\n50\n00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.160\nMasterCard, or Discover.\n\n51\n00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.040\nCheckmarks when you can\nchoose more than one.\n\n52\n00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.340\nThis is not the case here though.\n\n53\n00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.210\nYou can either encrypt a file or\ncompress a file.\n\n54\n00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.130\nBoth are properties of NTFS and\nyou can only do one.\n\n55\n00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.990\nSo, if you, it'll let you do it sort of or\nmake you think you can do it.\n\n56\n00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.780\nRight?\nIf you encrypt a file, like I'm going to.\n\n57\n00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.360\nWell, I'll show you.\nSure.\n\n58\n00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.420\nYeah, heck,\nlet's not talk about it let's do it.\n\n59\n00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.250\nI'm gonna encrypt contents\nto secure data and\n\n60\n00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.970\nI'm gonna click OK and I'll click OK\non the properties then it's gonna\n\n61\n00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.570\nask me if I wanna do the folder that\ncontains the file or the file only.\n\n62\n00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.890\nBest Practice is always encrypt\nthe folder itself, not the file.\n\n63\n00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.520\nThat way, the folder, remember,\nis just a container and\n\n64\n00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.010\nit doesn't actually get encrypted.\n\n65\n00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.570\nAnybody can still get into that folder but\nnow all I have to do is put a document in\n\n66\n00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.430\nthere and it'll pick up that attribute\nright, it inherits from the folder\n\n67\n00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.300\ndown to the files inside there and\nremember it'll use your keys so\n\n68\n00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.950\nif Daniel puts a file in that\nsame folder I can't get into it.\n\n69\n00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.680\nIt's encrypted to one of Daniel's keys,\n\n70\n00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.500\nif I put a file in there it\nwould be encrypted with my keys,\n\n71\n00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.770\nDaniel couldn't get it but this demo\nthough, I'm just gonna do the file.\n\n72\n00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.500\nNow Mike if you encrypt a folder that you\nalready have laying around, has documents\n\n73\n00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.580\ninside of it, does it encrypt those\ndocuments, or only new stuff?\n\n74\n00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.770\n>> Mm.\nNope it will, it'll go back and\n\n75\n00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.390\nencrypt all those documents in there.\n\n76\n00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.950\n>> Cool.\n\n77\n00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:43.870\n>> Yeah.\nAll right, so I'll encrypt that\n\n78\n00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.930\nfile only and I'll click okay and\nreally you know that's not probably\n\n79\n00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.750\nthe best example because unfortunately\nwe can't see that it turned green.\n\n80\n00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.680\nSo, let me do another one real quick.\n\n81\n00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.700\nI'm going to go over\nhere to me e-drive and\n\n82\n00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.620\nI'm just going to take one of\nthese files and do the same thing.\n\n83\n00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.590\nRight click properties,\nadvanced attributes,\n\n84\n00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.360\nencrypt contents, okay,\nand okay and there we go.\n\n85\n00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.960\nWe'll see that file turned green.\n\n86\n00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.130\nThat's the indication\nthat it is encrypted.\n\n87\n00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.140\nSo, now only I can double\nclick on that file and\n\n88\n00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.730\nopen up and it's transparent to me.\n\n89\n00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.570\nI don't have to do anything,\nI don't have to decrypt it first.\n\n90\n00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.950\nMy key is stored in my user profile and\nwhen I attempt to double click on it,\n\n91\n00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.100\nit checks to see if my key matches and\nif it's able to decrypt.\n\n92\n00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.570\nRemember we talked about the whole\npublic key and private key and\n\n93\n00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.210\nthe file encryption key.\n\n94\n00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.180\nSo, we've got my private key,\ndecrypted the DDF,\n\n95\n00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.730\nthe data decryption field, grabbed\nthe file encryption key out of there,\n\n96\n00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.900\ndecrypted the document,\npresented that document in notepad.\n\n97\n00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.180\nNotepad opens up, and here we go and\n\n98\n00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.950\nI can type data in here I\ncan close it I can save it.\n\n99\n00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.810\nI don't have to do anything right?\n\n100\n00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.590\nNotepad in fact is unaware of\nthe fact that this file is encrypted,\n\n101\n00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.330\nbecause it hands it back to the file\nsystem to be stored or saved.\n\n102\n00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.430\nThe filesystem then turns it around and\nencrypts it and\n\n103\n00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.120\nputs it back on the hard drive.\n\n104\n00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.380\nAll right, now if I just, I don't know\nif they would call this app but just so\n\n105\n00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.500\nyou guys are aware,\nif I got back to the properties here and\n\n106\n00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.460\nI choose advanced it'll let\nme choose compressed but\n\n107\n00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.170\nnotice it unchecks encrypted, so if you\ntry to compress and encrypted file what\n\n108\n00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.600\nit's going to do is decrypt the file\nfirst and then compress it.\n\n109\n00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.930\nIf you try to encrypt a compressed file,\nit'll uncompress the file first, and\n\n110\n00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.830\nencrypt it and\nif you're not the authorized user,\n\n111\n00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.910\nyou won't be able to compress\nthe encrypted file, right?\n\n112\n00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.635\nCuz it can't decrypt it first and\nthen compress it so it wouldn't let you.\n\n113\n00:05:34.635 --> 00:05:37.095\nAll right, and we also talked about and\nI'm gonna cancel that out so\n\n114\n00:05:37.095 --> 00:05:41.505\nI don't actually remove the encryption.\n\n115\n00:05:41.505 --> 00:05:44.647\nIf I go back in here and I click details,\nthis is where I can share.\n\n116\n00:05:44.647 --> 00:05:47.727\nRemember we talked about one of the cool\nthings about EFS is I can share\n\n117\n00:05:47.727 --> 00:05:49.357\nthe file with other users.\n\n118\n00:05:49.357 --> 00:05:51.137\nAll we have to do is click add and\n\n119\n00:05:51.137 --> 00:05:55.297\nif there were other users that had\ncertificates I could click find user.\n\n120\n00:05:55.297 --> 00:05:59.160\nI could browse through active directory\nI could grab their certificate and\n\n121\n00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.110\nadd them here, and then they would be\nable to decrypt that file as well.\n\n122\n00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.430\nSo, if we need to share encrypted files,\nvery easy to do because we published those\n\n123\n00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.640\ncertificates and active directory and\nthen remember, the public key is public.\n\n124\n00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.240\nAnybody could have it, so.\n\n125\n00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.650\nWe make them readily available,\nvery easy to do.\n\n126\n00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.160\nAll right so that's our EFS and again,\n\n127\n00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.800\nwith EFS, you know, we're using, we're\nencrypting a single file which is nice.\n\n128\n00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.930\nIf I need to protect that file,\nwe know we've got NTFS permissions,\n\n129\n00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:34.240\nwe can control who can or can't access\nthat but remember with NTFS permissions\n\n130\n00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.740\nit's based on users SID, security\nidentifier and the SID of a group.\n\n131\n00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.750\nSo, let's say I don't want\nDaniel to get access to it.\n\n132\n00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:47.100\nWell, NTFS doesn't have Daniel\nlisted there as an allow,\n\n133\n00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.660\nthere's no ACE,\naccess control entry for Daniel but\n\n134\n00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.350\nthere is an access control entry for\nsay a group called hosts.\n\n135\n00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.850\nWell if Daniel ever gets\nadded to that group,\n\n136\n00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.530\nall of a sudden he's gonna get\naccess to the file, all right.\n\n137\n00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:05.300\nSo, then DFS permissions, there's\na chance it goes on an implicit deny,\n\n138\n00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.390\nwhich means at some point somebody\nelse could give Daniel access.\n\n139\n00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.480\nWith encryption that is\nnot going to happen.\n\n140\n00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.980\nI don't care what groups Daniel belongs\nto he is not getting access to that file\n\n141\n00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.150\nunless I choose to share that\nencrypted file with him.\n\n142\n00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:23.810\nSo, that is why we have this right, that\nis why it is another layer of security as\n\n143\n00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:29.000\na way to add on top of the security\nwe already get through NTFS but\n\n144\n00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.970\nit is protecting an individual file and\nif we've got lots of files.\n\n145\n00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:37.649\nI'm trying to think of a good\nway to say it is good for\n\n146\n00:07:37.649 --> 00:07:42.616\nprotecting individual files but\nif somebody steals my hard drive and\n\n147\n00:07:42.616 --> 00:07:46.314\nthey try to slave that\ndrive into another machine.\n\n148\n00:07:46.314 --> 00:07:50.332\nAnything that's not encrypted they're\ngoing to be able to gain access to,\n\n149\n00:07:50.332 --> 00:07:54.474\nif it's encrypted they shouldn't be able\nto but sometimes we want to be able to\n\n150\n00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:58.806\nprotect the entire drive, especially on\nmobile devices where they can get lost or\n\n151\n00:07:58.806 --> 00:08:01.305\nstolen and\nthat's where BitLocker comes in.\n\n152\n00:08:01.305 --> 00:08:03.466\nBitLocker is a full drive encryption.\n\n153\n00:08:03.466 --> 00:08:06.450\nIt encrypts everything on the drive.\n\n154\n00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:10.760\nAnd that way if somebody tries to\nsteal it and put it in another machine\n\n155\n00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.360\nlike they walk into your server closet and\nthey grab a couple of those hard drives.\n\n156\n00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:19.220\nThey just pop them out of those removable\ncages and try to take them home or if they\n\n157\n00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.350\ncan't break into your laptop, they can't\nget your password, so they disassemble it.\n\n158\n00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:25.960\nThey take the hard drive out and\nthey try to slave into another machine.\n\n159\n00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.630\nBitLocker's gonna protect us\nagainst things like that.\n\n160\n00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:29.540\nAll right.\n\n161\n00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.390\n>> Actually I worked for a company\nthat that's exactly why we implemented\n\n162\n00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:34.390\nBitLocker, was somebody had a laptop.\n\n163\n00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.840\nThey were out at a coffee shop or\nwherever.\n\n164\n00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.920\nAnd somebody just snatched their laptop\nand ran off with it, and it was stolen.\n\n165\n00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:45.556\nAll the company data, guy was VPNed\nin from their wireless network, and\n\n166\n00:08:45.556 --> 00:08:46.860\nthat junk was gone.\n\n167\n00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.040\nWe had no way to stop them from\ndoing whatever they wanted.\n\n168\n00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:50.860\nThey had full access.\n\n169\n00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.650\nHe was logged in.\n\n170\n00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:53.970\nIt was sitting on his table and\nit was out of there.\n\n171\n00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.165\nWe thought,\nwe might need to do something about this.\n\n172\n00:08:56.165 --> 00:08:56.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So BitLocker\n\n173\n00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.210\ncame to the rescue on this one.\n\n174\n00:08:58.210 --> 00:08:58.860\n>> Absolutely.\n\n175\n00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.670\nIt really is a life saver\nin scenarios like that.\n\n176\n00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:05.840\nSo it is something that you're seeing\nimplemented just about everywhere.\n\n177\n00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.590\nIn Microsoft again,\nwe've got Bit Locker, and\n\n178\n00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.110\nthere's third party software\nthat can do this as well.\n\n179\n00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:14.120\nThat does that whole drive encryption,\nor full volume encryption,\n\n180\n00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.560\nis really what we should say.\n\n181\n00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.530\nAnd it's really easy to implement.\n\n182\n00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:21.940\nCouple things I wanted to mention about\nit though, when we talk about BitLocker,\n\n183\n00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:25.160\nfirst of all, there's BitLocker,\nand there's BitLocker to go.\n\n184\n00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:30.820\nBitlocker is for my operating system\ndrive, as well as my fixed data drives.\n\n185\n00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:35.210\nThese are hard drives that are located\nin my tower, or within my laptop or\n\n186\n00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.410\nwhat have you, drives that I can't remove.\n\n187\n00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:41.865\nBitLocker to Go is for\nremoval drives, like USB hard drives,\n\n188\n00:09:41.865 --> 00:09:46.245\nor flash drives, thumb drives,\nthings like that, we have BitLocker to go.\n\n189\n00:09:46.245 --> 00:09:48.455\nAnd that's one that I truly love Daniel,\n\n190\n00:09:48.455 --> 00:09:51.760\nbecause thumb drives\nare extremely easy to use and\n\n191\n00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.802\npeople put all kinds of stuff on there,\nthinking, hey this is my thumb drive.\n\n192\n00:09:54.802 --> 00:09:57.940\nI'm gonna copy stuff onto here,\nwork related data, take it home,\n\n193\n00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.280\nI can work with it and\nthen I bring it back.\n\n194\n00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.345\nBut how easy is it to leave one olf those\nthings laying on the table of a restaurant\n\n195\n00:10:03.345 --> 00:10:07.790\nin the backseat of a cab, or have it fall\nout of your pocket or something like that.\n\n196\n00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.910\nWell, BitLocker To Go can\nprotect us against that,\n\n197\n00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:12.590\nbecause it's going to encrypt\nthat entire thumb drive.\n\n198\n00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:15.640\nAnd unless you know how to get back\ninto it, if you know the password or\n\n199\n00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.790\nthe pin to get back into it, you're not\ngonna get access to that information.\n\n200\n00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:20.230\nSo it's very, very cool.\n\n201\n00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:21.577\n>> Yeah, BitLocker is a very nice feature.\n\n202\n00:10:21.577 --> 00:10:24.861\nAnd it's not too difficult to set up,\nvery simple and straightforward.\n\n203\n00:10:24.861 --> 00:10:29.400\nI remember when I first heard of it I\nthought this is gonna be a bear, right?\n\n204\n00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.580\nWe're talking about encryption,\nfull drives,\n\n205\n00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.080\nit's gonna be nothing but a headache.\n\n206\n00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:37.260\nBut I was pleasantly surprised how\neasy it was to set up BitLocker\n\n207\n00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.070\neven on a stand alone machine.\n\n208\n00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:41.110\nSo if you wanna use this\non your home systems,\n\n209\n00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:44.450\nit will work obviously in a corporate\nenvironment, that will work as well.\n\n210\n00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:45.880\nIt integrates with Active Directory.\n\n211\n00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.610\nIt's a very, very nice product.\n\n212\n00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.260\n>> And you know what, Daniel, I forgot,\nbefore we dive into the world of\n\n213\n00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.990\nBitLocker, I told you guys I was gonna\ntell you the downside of EFS, right?\n\n214\n00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:57.400\nI said, it didn't need any configuration.\n\n215\n00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.890\nYou saw me, I just right-clicked on\na file, and chose to encrypt it.\n\n216\n00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:02.360\nAnd it did its job, right?\n\n217\n00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.880\nWell, remember from the previous episode,\nI said that Windows will check and\n\n218\n00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.310\nsee if you've got keys issued\nto you by your corporation or\n\n219\n00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:12.170\nby your network for the purpose of EFS.\n\n220\n00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:16.220\nAnd if you don't, Windows will\ngenerate one for you on the fly.\n\n221\n00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.870\nThat's a great thing, but\nit's also a bad thing.\n\n222\n00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:22.530\nWe have to be really careful with\nthat because here is what can happen.\n\n223\n00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:26.230\nIf I am issuing keys to all my users,\nwe are issuing certificates, and\n\n224\n00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:27.430\nthat includes their public and\n\n225\n00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:32.560\ntheir private key, then as I issue them\nto my users, I can back them up for them.\n\n226\n00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.120\nI can create a copy of it and\n\n227\n00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:38.000\nI can make sure that if they ever lose\ntheir key, I can replace their key.\n\n228\n00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.930\nWe've got a recovery agent\nthat should be set up so\n\n229\n00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:46.280\nthat he can access any encrypted file in\ncase, again, that user loses their key.\n\n230\n00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:51.650\nBut in say, a Soho environment where we\ndon't have that data recovery agent and\n\n231\n00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.820\nwe're not issuing keys to everybody,\nWindows will just generate one for\n\n232\n00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.140\nyou on the fly.\n\n233\n00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.270\nBut now, who's managing that key, right?\n\n234\n00:11:58.270 --> 00:11:59.470\nWho's backing that key up?\n\n235\n00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:02.290\nYou could have a user\nencrypting all kinds of data\n\n236\n00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:04.980\nthinking they're keeping\ntheir data safe and they are.\n\n237\n00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:08.600\nBut if that profile ever gets corrupt,\nif they ever lose that key and\n\n238\n00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.870\nthey didn't back their key up,\n\n239\n00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:14.690\nwhich most of our end users are not gonna\nknow how to do, all that data's gone.\n\n240\n00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:17.500\nI'm not gonna get access to\nit unless I can find a backup\n\n241\n00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.320\nbefore that data was encrypted, all right?\n\n242\n00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.770\nAnd that could be days or months old,\nand how much work are we losing?\n\n243\n00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:27.070\nHow far back in time can we go on\nthese documents, so keep that in mind.\n\n244\n00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:30.020\nIn an enterprise environment,\nif you're not gonna use EFS, or\n\n245\n00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:33.120\nin a Soho environment,\nif you don't want your users using EFS,\n\n246\n00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:37.270\nyou can disable it, prevent them from\nbeing able to encrypt files like that.\n\n247\n00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:41.660\nAnd maybe that's a good idea unless you're\ntaking the time to go back up everybody's\n\n248\n00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:42.660\nkeys for them.\n\n249\n00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.820\nOr you're using a centralized\nservice like Certificate Services\n\n250\n00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.600\nto manage those keys for our end users.\n\n251\n00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.920\n>> You've just got to be very,\nvery careful with the power of encryption\n\n252\n00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.482\nbecause well, you'll encrypt\nyourself right out of your own data.\n\n253\n00:12:53.482 --> 00:12:54.400\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.\n\n254\n00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.310\nI've done it myself.\n\n255\n00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:56.370\nYou're goofing around at home.\n\n256\n00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:58.530\nI've got a spreadsheet that\nI keep my finances on.\n\n257\n00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:00.330\nI thought oh, I'm gonna encrypt it.\n\n258\n00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.030\nI got great physical security at my house.\n\n259\n00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:04.130\nI'm the only one that lives there, right?\n\n260\n00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:06.210\nSo, I really didn't have\nany business doing it, but\n\n261\n00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:08.330\nI encrypted it just for kicks and giggles.\n\n262\n00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.670\nAnd I know I exported that\nkey to something, right?\n\n263\n00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:16.280\nBut, then later on after a few re-installs\nand copying these files around and\n\n264\n00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.380\nI was like oh,\nI need to get back into that file.\n\n265\n00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:19.550\nOh, wow.\n\n266\n00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:22.650\nThat was like two operating systems ago,\nwhere's my key?\n\n267\n00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:23.850\nWhat did I export it to?\n\n268\n00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:25.220\nWhere the heck is it?\n\n269\n00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:27.800\nI to this day have not\ngotten back into that file.\n\n270\n00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.920\nI still have it,\njust in case I ever find that key, right?\n\n271\n00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.020\nBut you're not getting back into it.\n\n272\n00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.995\n>> I love how you hold on to hope,\nlike this.\n\n273\n00:13:34.995 --> 00:13:35.495\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's awesome.\n\n274\n00:13:35.495 --> 00:13:36.748\n>> You can't give up.\n\n275\n00:13:36.748 --> 00:13:37.793\n>> That's right, never give up,\n\n276\n00:13:37.793 --> 00:13:39.170\nnever surrender.\n\n277\n00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:39.750\n>> All right so.\n\n278\n00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:40.520\n>> Back to BitLocker.\n\n279\n00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.420\n>> Back to BitLocker.\n\n280\n00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.410\nSorry for that little loop around there.\n\n281\n00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:46.250\nSo BitLocker again, full drive encryption.\n\n282\n00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:49.480\nWe can do our operating system drive,\nwe can do our fixed data drives,\n\n283\n00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.860\nwe can use BitLocker to go\non our removable drives.\n\n284\n00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.490\nReally easy to set up.\n\n285\n00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:57.460\nCouple things, couple requirements for it.\n\n286\n00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:03.470\nOne is something called a TPM chip,\nwhich is a trusted platform module, right?\n\n287\n00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:06.470\nThis is a chip soldered\nonto your motherboard.\n\n288\n00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:09.520\nAnd this is where the key is,\nremember we talked about\n\n289\n00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.730\nkeys in our other episodes and\nhow that works with encryption.\n\n290\n00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:14.580\nFor BitLocker,\nwe're gonna encrypt the entire drive.\n\n291\n00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.862\nWhere are we gonna store the keys for\nthat?\n\n292\n00:14:16.862 --> 00:14:21.350\nWe're gonna put them in this TPM,\nthis Trusted Platform Module and\n\n293\n00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:23.625\nthat way it's separate\nfrom the hard drive,\n\n294\n00:14:23.625 --> 00:14:25.800\nall right, cuz I don't want\nsomeone taking my hard drive.\n\n295\n00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.480\nAnd if the key is somewhere\non that hardware, well,\n\n296\n00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.408\nthat's not going do me\na whole lot of good, right?\n\n297\n00:14:30.408 --> 00:14:33.370\nBecause they eventually could find\nthat key and decrypt that drive.\n\n298\n00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:37.590\nSo the keys are stored separate\nfrom the hard drive in a TPM.\n\n299\n00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:40.670\nMost of your modern computers\ntoday are going to have\n\n300\n00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:43.210\na TPM chip installed on them.\n\n301\n00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:45.470\nIf by chance it doesn't, and\n\n302\n00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:50.100\nyou want to use BitLocker, you can\nenable BitLocker without a TPM chip.\n\n303\n00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:53.600\nIt requires you to go into the bios and\nenable that option.\n\n304\n00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.420\nAnd then what will happen is you will need\nto store the key on a USB thumb drive.\n\n305\n00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:04.100\nAnd now that becomes almost like\na startup because that's the key.\n\n306\n00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.700\nOn that thumb drive is the key you\nneed to decrypt the drive, right?\n\n307\n00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.960\nAnd if that's your operating system drive,\nthen for it to start up,\n\n308\n00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.150\nit needs to decrypt the drive,\n\n309\n00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:14.970\nwhich means that thumb drive better be\npresent with that key on there, right?\n\n310\n00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:17.230\nYou lose that thumb drive,\nor you don't have it around,\n\n311\n00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:20.180\nyou're not gonna be able to\nstart that machine up, right?\n\n312\n00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.960\nSo it has to have access to it, and\n\n313\n00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:26.560\nyou have to make sure that your\nbios supports accessing USB.\n\n314\n00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:30.230\nThe most modern bios' do but\nif you've got an older bios,\n\n315\n00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:33.530\nlike I remember back when you\nknow you would boot up and\n\n316\n00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:35.870\nif you had to get in like a safe mode or\ndo anything like that,\n\n317\n00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:41.310\nyou had to find an old PS2 keyboard,\nbecause my bios didn't recognize USB.\n\n318\n00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:43.420\nSo I couldn't use my USB keyboard.\n\n319\n00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:47.060\nSo, make sure if you're gonna do that,\nand like I said, update your bios and\n\n320\n00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:48.015\nyou should be fine.\n\n321\n00:15:48.015 --> 00:15:51.508\nBut just make sure before you try it,\nright, that it does support that.\n\n322\n00:15:51.508 --> 00:15:55.126\n>> Yeah, otherwise you're scrumming\naround in old bargain bins.\n\n323\n00:15:55.126 --> 00:15:58.010\nLooking for\none of those PS2 to USB adapters.\n\n324\n00:15:58.010 --> 00:15:58.852\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n325\n00:15:58.852 --> 00:16:00.145\n>> Or something like that.\n\n326\n00:16:00.145 --> 00:16:04.410\nAnd Mike, let me commend you on being\na true IT Pro professional here, and\n\n327\n00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:08.035\nhe says TPM chip and not TPM module\nit's just a little recursive.\n\n328\n00:16:08.035 --> 00:16:08.570\n[LAUGH]\n>> It is.\n\n329\n00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:09.230\nYes, yes.\n\n330\n00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:11.750\nIt's like saying PIN number or\nATM machine.\n\n331\n00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:12.270\n>> Right.\n\n332\n00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:13.932\n>> My personal identification\nnumber number.\n\n333\n00:16:13.932 --> 00:16:14.445\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n334\n00:16:14.445 --> 00:16:15.645\n>> Cuz I know if I did\n\n335\n00:16:15.645 --> 00:16:17.565\nsome of our viewers out there-\n>> That's\n\n336\n00:16:17.565 --> 00:16:18.325\nright.\n>> Would let me\n\n337\n00:16:18.325 --> 00:16:18.895\nknow.\n>> That's right.\n\n338\n00:16:18.895 --> 00:16:19.445\n>> Hammer us\n\n339\n00:16:19.445 --> 00:16:20.505\nwhen we do that stuff.\n>> That's right.\n\n340\n00:16:20.505 --> 00:16:22.080\nLet us know when we make mistakes.\n\n341\n00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.960\nAll right.\nSo, BitLocker again.\n\n342\n00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.110\nEncrypt that entire drive.\n\n343\n00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:27.170\nYou get the TPM chips soldered\nonto the motherboard.\n\n344\n00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:28.600\nThat's where we want to store it.\n\n345\n00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:36.160\nWe can use USB to store that decryption\nkey if we wanna use it without a TPM chip.\n\n346\n00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.410\nNow, when we use TPM,\n\n347\n00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:41.282\nand we use BitLocker, we can\nactually do several different modes.\n\n348\n00:16:41.282 --> 00:16:45.250\nAll right?\nWhen we go to start that machine up and\n\n349\n00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:49.810\nit needs to decrypt that drive,\nwe can do what we call TPM only.\n\n350\n00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:52.650\nMeaning it goes to the TPM chip,\nit grabs that key,\n\n351\n00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:57.576\nand it decrypts the drive, and off we go,\nour operating system boots up.\n\n352\n00:16:57.576 --> 00:16:58.960\nAction from me, right?\n\n353\n00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.090\nWhich is pretty cool, very convenient.\n\n354\n00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:06.408\nBut if we need a little more security,\nwe can do TPM plus start up key.\n\n355\n00:17:06.408 --> 00:17:11.020\nNow it's gonna store the decryption\nkey in the TPM but it's gonna\n\n356\n00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:16.100\nto store a separate key, a start up key,\non a USB removal thumb drive.\n\n357\n00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:17.900\nAnd now you'd have to have both.\n\n358\n00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.150\nThe TPM would have to be present and\n\n359\n00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:24.560\nyou would have to plug in that USB\nthumb drive to get that start up key.\n\n360\n00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:28.670\nSo if somebody comes up to that machine,\nand they try to start it up but\n\n361\n00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:31.650\nthey don't have that thumb drive,\neven though that key is on that TPM chip,\n\n362\n00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:33.520\nthey won't be able to start it up, right?\n\n363\n00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.020\nSo a second layer of security there.\n\n364\n00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:38.720\nThis is probably not something that\nyou'd do to client machines or\n\n365\n00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:42.670\nanything like that, but on a high end\nserver, a server that required an extra\n\n366\n00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:46.690\nlevel of security,\nmaybe that's something you wanna do.\n\n367\n00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:51.820\nYou can also do TPM plus PIN,\nwhere I need the TPM to store my\n\n368\n00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:56.730\ndecryption keys, and I need a PIN to\nenter when that system starts up.\n\n369\n00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:01.610\nSo you boot it up, it's gonna retrieve\nthe decryption key from the TPM,\n\n370\n00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:06.550\nbut you're also gonna have to punch in\nthe PIN to complete that process and\n\n371\n00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:08.730\nstart that machine up and\ndecrypt that volume.\n\n372\n00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:10.250\nOr you can combine all three.\n\n373\n00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:13.200\nYou can actually to TPM,\nplus start up key, plus PIN.\n\n374\n00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.040\nAll right?\n\n375\n00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.660\nSo now you've got the decryption\nkey stored in the TPM.\n\n376\n00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:20.190\nYou're gonna have to have your thumb\ndrive present for the startup key, and\n\n377\n00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:21.519\nyou're gonna have to type in your PIN.\n\n378\n00:18:21.519 --> 00:18:22.290\nAll right?\n\n379\n00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:24.490\nSo, depends on what you wanna do.\n\n380\n00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:27.130\nYou can choose any combination thereof.\n\n381\n00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:30.931\nSo what level of security do you need?\n\n382\n00:18:30.931 --> 00:18:31.830\nAll right.\n\n383\n00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:34.120\nLet's take a look, Daniel,\nat actually setting this up.\n\n384\n00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.310\nLike I said, it's actually very easy.\n\n385\n00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:38.970\nYou might have go into your BIOS and\n\n386\n00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:42.590\nmake sure that the TPM's available and\nthat it's turned on.\n\n387\n00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:45.640\nMost of these are supported\nout of the box, though.\n\n388\n00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.070\nAnd all I have,\nthere's a couple of ways I can get to it.\n\n389\n00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:50.660\nI could go,\nI'm gonna do my fixed data drive here.\n\n390\n00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:55.320\nI could right click on E colon, and\nI can choose turn on BitLocker, and\n\n391\n00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.990\nthat's gonna launch this\nhandy dandy little wizard.\n\n392\n00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:02.833\nI can also go to the Control Panel and\n\n393\n00:19:02.833 --> 00:19:06.252\nI can come in here and\nchoose BitLocker Drive Encryption, and\n\n394\n00:19:06.252 --> 00:19:10.780\nnow I can work with all of my drives\non that system and encrypt them.\n\n395\n00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:14.230\nSo I'm gonna encrypt the E drive here,\nmy fixed data drives.\n\n396\n00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:18.190\nI'll choose Turn on Bitlocker,\nsame wizard pops up.\n\n397\n00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:20.990\nAnd I'm gonna use a password\nto unlock the drive.\n\n398\n00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:23.750\nNotice we could also use a smart\ncard to unlock the drive,\n\n399\n00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:27.050\nas long as you've got the card and\nthe readers available.\n\n400\n00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:30.131\nI'll put in my super secret password.\n\n401\n00:19:33.811 --> 00:19:37.010\nThen it wants to know where do I\nwant to save the recovery key.\n\n402\n00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:39.320\nThis is an important part here.\n\n403\n00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:44.260\nThe recovery key is for when you lose\nthat encryption and decryption key.\n\n404\n00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:45.740\nHow do I get back in there?\n\n405\n00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:46.960\nHere's the thing about Bitlocker.\n\n406\n00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.560\nBitlocker we said is really cool,\n\n407\n00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.156\nit protects you against\nsomebody stealing your drive.\n\n408\n00:19:51.156 --> 00:19:53.200\nHow's it doing that?\n\n409\n00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.150\nWell, it knows the machine that it's in.\n\n410\n00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.310\nIt's kind of like activation with Windows.\n\n411\n00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:00.320\nIt looks at some of\nthe hardware in there and\n\n412\n00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.610\ncreates a little signature and\nit recognizes the machine.\n\n413\n00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:07.680\nAnd so when it starts up, when this\ncomputer starts, and before that volume is\n\n414\n00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.760\ndecrypted, it's gonna say, wait,\nam I in the right computer?\n\n415\n00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.400\nIf it's the operating systems drive,\nright?\n\n416\n00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.460\nThe fixed data drives,\nactually don't do this.\n\n417\n00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.660\nYou just have that password or\nthe smart key to unlock them.\n\n418\n00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.290\nBut, those operating system drives,\n\n419\n00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:21.140\nthey can tell if they're in\nthe right machine or not.\n\n420\n00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.470\nAnd so if somebody steals that hard drive,\n\n421\n00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:26.705\ntakes it to another machine,\nit's not gonna decrypt it.\n\n422\n00:20:26.705 --> 00:20:27.210\nRight?\n\n423\n00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:29.200\nIt says, wait a second,\nI'm not in the right machine.\n\n424\n00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.900\nIt's not gonna have the chip anyway,\nright?\n\n425\n00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.100\nThat the key it needs to decrypt\nit is stored in that TPM.\n\n426\n00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:35.430\nBut what if you did it without TPM?\n\n427\n00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:38.425\nWhat if you decided you wanted\nto just store the key on USB.\n\n428\n00:20:38.425 --> 00:20:41.040\nWell, somebody could try\nto steal that drive and\n\n429\n00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.180\nmaybe steal that thumb drive,\nplug it into another system.\n\n430\n00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:45.100\nIt's not gonna let them.\n\n431\n00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.320\nIt's gonna say that's not\nthe machine I came from.\n\n432\n00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:47.820\nRight?\n\n433\n00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:48.640\nThat's good, right?\n\n434\n00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.810\nI don't want somebody doing\nwhat happened to Daniel,\n\n435\n00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:52.670\nwhat happened to David out\nthere in the chatroom.\n\n436\n00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:55.150\nIf somebody's stealing the laptop and\ntrying to steal steal or\n\n437\n00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:58.630\ntake that drive out of there and\nslave it into another machine.\n\n438\n00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:00.480\nBut what if I need to?\n\n439\n00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.770\nThere's gonna be times when\nit actually happens to us.\n\n440\n00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:05.410\nLet's say that hardware fails.\n\n441\n00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:06.840\nRight?\nMother board fails.\n\n442\n00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.390\nThe TPM's on that mother board.\n\n443\n00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:11.110\nNow, I've gotta take that drive,\nI've gotta rebuild that server.\n\n444\n00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:13.400\nI've gotta move those\ndrives to another machine.\n\n445\n00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.060\nAnd it's, again, gonna recognize\nit doesn't know that I'm doing it\n\n446\n00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.792\nintentionally, or\nif Daniel's stealing the drive.\n\n447\n00:21:18.792 --> 00:21:20.240\nAll right?\nSo it's gonna say,\n\n448\n00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.640\nI'm not in the right machine,\nI'm not gonna decrypt.\n\n449\n00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.650\nThat's when we need that recovery key.\n\n450\n00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:28.130\nOr in the case of a fixed data drive\nlike this, if I forget my password or\n\n451\n00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:31.070\nlose my password,\nI'm gonna need this recovery key.\n\n452\n00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:32.160\nAll right?\n\n453\n00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.290\nSo, best thing to do is to save it.\n\n454\n00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:36.670\nYou can do both.\n\n455\n00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:38.330\nYou can save it and you can print it.\n\n456\n00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:40.360\nNow, I'm gonna save it to this machine.\n\n457\n00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.720\nThat's probably not a good idea, right?\n\n458\n00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:45.600\nI don't want the recovery drive,\nor the recovery key on here.\n\n459\n00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.258\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and\ndo it just for giggles.\n\n460\n00:21:48.258 --> 00:21:49.490\nAnd it's gonna warn me, hey,\n\n461\n00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:52.640\nyou should put this somewhere other than\nthe computer that you're protecting.\n\n462\n00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.425\nBecause if somebody else gets this\nrecovery key, they can attempt, again,\n\n463\n00:21:55.425 --> 00:22:00.210\nto steal the drive and access that\ninformation with that recovery key.\n\n464\n00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:01.550\nI'm just gonna say yes.\n\n465\n00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:03.350\nYou could also print it out.\n\n466\n00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:05.120\nYou'd wanna protect that hard copy, right?\n\n467\n00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.850\nPut that file somewhere in a locked\nfiling cabinet or something like that.\n\n468\n00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:12.610\nBest bet is to save it to a thumb drive or\nburn it to removable media, and\n\n469\n00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:14.220\nthen throw that in a safe somewhere,\nright?\n\n470\n00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.620\nKeep that secure.\n\n471\n00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:18.790\nPut that in your locked desk drawer or\nthat locking file cabinet, or\n\n472\n00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:20.470\nsomething like that.\n\n473\n00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:21.550\nWe'll go ahead and click Next.\n\n474\n00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:23.880\nAnd then I'll choose Start Encrypting.\n\n475\n00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:24.630\nIt's a blank drive.\n\n476\n00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:27.040\nThere's not a lot on there so\nit shouldn't take too long.\n\n477\n00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.360\nBut keep this in mind.\n\n478\n00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.570\nIf you've got a drive that already\nhas a lot of data on there,\n\n479\n00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:35.300\nespecially if you've got a terabyte\ndrive or something crazy like that, and\n\n480\n00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:39.210\nyou've already got 800 Gigs of data,\nthis is gonna take a little while.\n\n481\n00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:42.970\nThis is something you're gonna start up\nin the evening before you leave work and\n\n482\n00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:45.670\ncome back tomorrow and\nhope it's finished, right?\n\n483\n00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:50.100\nSo depending on how much data and the size\nof that drive, could take a little while.\n\n484\n00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:51.590\nSo we'll let this run for a minute.\n\n485\n00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:56.170\nAnd while it's doing it, I'm gonna go\nahead and do it on my thumb drive as well.\n\n486\n00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:57.120\nSo BitLocker to go.\n\n487\n00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.690\nThis F drive,\nthis is a thumb drive I've got plugged in.\n\n488\n00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:03.010\nAnd I'm gonna choose turn on BitLocker.\n\n489\n00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:04.970\nAnd let's see if it will let\nme do it at the same time.\n\n490\n00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:06.640\nIt might get mad at me.\n\n491\n00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:07.660\nNope, there we go.\n\n492\n00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.289\nAnd I'll use a password\non this one as well.\n\n493\n00:23:13.234 --> 00:23:15.700\nType that guy in there,\nand I'll click next.\n\n494\n00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.700\nAnd I'll save the recovery key.\n\n495\n00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:21.560\nNotice there's a recovery key for\neach encrypted volume.\n\n496\n00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.160\nSo if you had eight volumes\nin this machine and\n\n497\n00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.785\nyou were using BitLocker on all of them,\nyou'd have eight separate recovery keys.\n\n498\n00:23:27.785 --> 00:23:31.680\nA recovery key is specific\nto that particular volume.\n\n499\n00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:35.480\nI'll go ahead and\nclick save and then next, and\n\n500\n00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.360\nthen start encrypting and\nwe'll let that run.\n\n501\n00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:41.000\nSo now I've got two of them going,\nshould, and I'll get this out of the way.\n\n502\n00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.980\nLet's see if it will let me move that\nover, so now I've got two of them going.\n\n503\n00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.940\n>> The computer's like,\nwhat are you doing to me, man?\n\n504\n00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:49.260\n>> I know.\nI'm really making it mad now.\n\n505\n00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.120\nThe thumb drive is only\nlike a couple gigs, so\n\n506\n00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.480\nit shouldn't take that too long either.\n\n507\n00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:57.313\nI guess I could pause one and see if\nit'll go any faster on the other one.\n\n508\n00:23:57.313 --> 00:24:00.320\nAlthough it's a pretty beefy machine,\nit should be all right.\n\n509\n00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:00.889\n>> It'll do okay.\n\n510\n00:24:00.889 --> 00:24:01.761\n>> Yeah.\n\n511\n00:24:01.761 --> 00:24:02.350\nAll right.\n\n512\n00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:06.164\nSo we'll get this running here and\nI can show you what it looks like.\n\n513\n00:24:06.164 --> 00:24:11.134\nAnother thing to keep in mind about\nBitLocker is that it's protecting my data\n\n514\n00:24:11.134 --> 00:24:12.590\nwhile it's offline.\n\n515\n00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:17.170\nWhen this operating system starts up,\nit decrypts the volume.\n\n516\n00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:20.535\nIf it's a data drive, when it starts up,\nit's decrypting that volume.\n\n517\n00:24:20.535 --> 00:24:23.260\nAnd so while it's running,\n\n518\n00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:27.230\nwhile this machine is running, BitLocker's\nreally not doing anything to protect me.\n\n519\n00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.780\nAll right?\n\n520\n00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:29.320\nThat's what EFS is for.\n\n521\n00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.210\nMy encrypting file system can be used.\n\n522\n00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:34.930\nThat protects me while my data's online,\nwhile my system's up and running.\n\n523\n00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:37.910\nThis decrypts everything when I\nstart the machine and log in.\n\n524\n00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:39.060\nAnd if I have to use a pin,\n\n525\n00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:42.960\nor what have you, I get that done,\nit decrypts the volume.\n\n526\n00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.100\nIt's when we shut it down that\nit encrypts it all again.\n\n527\n00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:47.440\nSo keep that in mind as well.\n\n528\n00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.972\nThis is for offline protection.\n\n529\n00:24:49.972 --> 00:24:51.380\nAll right.\n\n530\n00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:55.890\nSo this volume is just about done here,\ngetting up to 87%.\n\n531\n00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:59.740\n>> Now, Mike, I've seen BitLocker\nsometimes, at least in my environment,\n\n532\n00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:03.370\nwe had a lot of users, they would call and\nsay I need my recovery key.\n\n533\n00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:06.970\nI'm trying to get into my laptop and\nit's asking for this recovery key.\n\n534\n00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:11.180\nAnd all they did was lose power to\ntheir PC, they let the battery die or\n\n535\n00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:12.070\nsomething like that.\n\n536\n00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:13.770\nAnd that would cause a BitLocker to say,\n\n537\n00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:16.640\nhey, somebody's trying to do\nsomething crazy to this thing.\n\n538\n00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.230\n>> Right.\n>> And they need to log in.\n\n539\n00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:21.900\nSo it's common, you might just wanna be\naware of that if this is something you're\n\n540\n00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.670\nimplementing in your corporate\nenvironment, there are little weird things\n\n541\n00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:29.350\nthat can occur with BitLocker that you'll\nhave to support if that does occur.\n\n542\n00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:30.210\nThen you just call.\n\n543\n00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:33.150\nThe good thing was we had the active\ndirectory integrated version of it.\n\n544\n00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:34.635\nAnd I just went to active directories.\n\n545\n00:25:34.635 --> 00:25:36.080\nThere's a nice little BitLocker tab.\n\n546\n00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.180\nI clicked on that.\n\n547\n00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:39.719\nI go get out a pen and\npaper buddy, cuz this [CROSSTALK]\n\n548\n00:25:39.719 --> 00:25:40.750\n>> There's forty-eight digits-\n\n549\n00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.439\n>> It's a super long characters\n\n550\n00:25:42.439 --> 00:25:43.760\nrecovery keys.\n\n551\n00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.375\nNo joke.\n\n552\n00:25:44.375 --> 00:25:45.048\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n553\n00:25:45.048 --> 00:25:47.531\n[LAUGH]\n>> There's forty-eight characters long if\n\n554\n00:25:47.531 --> 00:25:48.500\nI'm not mistaken.\n\n555\n00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:49.910\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's a chunky little thing.\n\n556\n00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:50.490\nBut, yeah.\n\n557\n00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:51.310\nThat's a good point.\n\n558\n00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:55.120\nAnd that's another reason to make\nsure we have those recovery keys, and\n\n559\n00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.250\na great point talking about\nstoring an active directory.\n\n560\n00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:58.360\nIn a corporate environment,\n\n561\n00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.790\nI don't want every user printing out their\nrecovery keys or anything like that.\n\n562\n00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:04.650\nI'd much rather store them up there\nin the active directory database.\n\n563\n00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:08.710\nThat way anybody, an IT person can\nget to them when they need them.\n\n564\n00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:11.250\nMy drive finished, I went ahead and\nclosed that first window.\n\n565\n00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:13.358\nThe thumb drive is still going.\n\n566\n00:26:13.358 --> 00:26:16.360\nIn the meantime,\nwe can take a look over here and\n\n567\n00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:21.710\nwe'll see that my data drive over here\nE: now has a little lock symbol on it.\n\n568\n00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:24.600\nBut if I double click on it I\ncan still see my files in there.\n\n569\n00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.160\nNotice I'm using both now,\n\n570\n00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.370\nBitLocker drive encryption as well\nas EFS on this particular file.\n\n571\n00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:34.094\nNow, I can make new files,\nI can do whatever I need,\n\n572\n00:26:34.094 --> 00:26:36.820\nnothing stopping me from that right?\n\n573\n00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:41.140\nBecause, again, it decrypts that drive\nwhen my operating system starts.\n\n574\n00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.150\nSo we'll let this finish.\n\n575\n00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:44.890\nAnd this one's taking a lot\nlonger than I thought it would.\n\n576\n00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:45.990\nMy little thumb drive there.\n\n577\n00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:49.510\n>> Basically the same idea though.\n\n578\n00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:52.080\nI mean it's just one drive versus another,\nand\n\n579\n00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.070\none of them's portable and\nthe other one isn't.\n\n580\n00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:56.100\n>> It is.\nSo we'll just go ahead and pause that, and\n\n581\n00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.080\nit'll probably balk at me.\n\n582\n00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.680\nIt might get mad.\n\n583\n00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.810\n>> How dare you Michael?\n\n584\n00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:01.530\n>> I know.\nWe don't need to see that.\n\n585\n00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:04.390\nSo now what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna restart this machine.\n\n586\n00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:07.655\nSo let's go down here and\nrestart this guy.\n\n587\n00:27:07.655 --> 00:27:11.240\nBitLokcer's really gonna cry now.\n\n588\n00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:13.720\nNever tried to restart it in\nthe middle of an encryption process.\n\n589\n00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:16.200\nSo we'll see what happens\nto that thumb drive.\n\n590\n00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.095\n>> We'll see if it's usable.\n\n591\n00:27:17.095 --> 00:27:17.640\nIt's toast now.\n\n592\n00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:18.300\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n593\n00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:20.090\n>> If you need a quick way to destroy\n\n594\n00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:23.050\nthe USB key, we'll show you that, too.\n[LAUGH]\n\n595\n00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:24.280\n>> So Windows is going to boot up.\n\n596\n00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:25.810\nNow, I did the fix data drive so\n\n597\n00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:28.750\nmy operating system boots up just fine.\n\n598\n00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:33.028\nI'm losing a little power there,\nbut we'll go ahead and\n\n599\n00:27:33.028 --> 00:27:38.380\nlog back in All right.\n\n600\n00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.220\nAnd I'll go ahead and\nopen up file explorer.\n\n601\n00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:45.830\nAnd take a look, and\nwe'll see that it is locked.\n\n602\n00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:49.650\nAnd even my one that I didn't finish\nencrypting is currently locked.\n\n603\n00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:52.530\nAnd if I try to double click on it,\nit's not gonna give me access.\n\n604\n00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:57.650\nIt's gonna say, well, you can access\nit if you know the password, right?\n\n605\n00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:02.260\nSo if I type in my password\nif I remember what it was.\n\n606\n00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:07.680\nNotice I can also say automatically\nunlock on this computer from now on.\n\n607\n00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:10.180\nThat's kind of a convenient thing.\n\n608\n00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:12.190\nReduces security a little bit, obviously.\n\n609\n00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:15.270\nBecause if somebody steals the laptop and\nthey boot it up and\n\n610\n00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:17.920\nthey're able to login as somebody,\nthey break a password,\n\n611\n00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:21.700\nor something like that, well,\nnow it's gonna automatically unlock.\n\n612\n00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.140\nWe'll go ahead and unlock it.\n\n613\n00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:24.280\nAnd there we go.\n\n614\n00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:28.950\nNow have my drive that I can gain\naccess to, and there's all my files.\n\n615\n00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:36.050\nOn my thumb drive, let's show you\nwhat if I forgot my password, right?\n\n616\n00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:38.610\nWell, I'm gonna have to\ntype in that recovery key.\n\n617\n00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:41.330\nSo if I click that,\nthere's my recovery key.\n\n618\n00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:44.150\nMy recovery key is saved over here.\n\n619\n00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:45.100\nNow, do be careful.\n\n620\n00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:46.190\nI see this a lot.\n\n621\n00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:48.370\nPeople think this is the recovery key.\n\n622\n00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:49.850\n>> I've seen the same thing.\n\n623\n00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:51.000\n>> Right?\nIt's a common mistake.\n\n624\n00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.920\nYou're thinking, oh,\nthat's gotta be the key right there.\n\n625\n00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:54.880\nThat's a big old long, nasty number.\n\n626\n00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:59.250\nThat's actually the ID for what this\nparticular recovery key goes to, right?\n\n627\n00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:03.620\nRemember, I said it's specific to\na particular volume in that encryption.\n\n628\n00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:06.150\nSo that's the ID for\nthat volume and that encryption.\n\n629\n00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:09.886\nHere is my recovery key.\n\n630\n00:29:09.886 --> 00:29:14.370\n>> Now imagine trying to tell that\nto someone over the telephone.\n\n631\n00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:16.780\nNo, no, v-\n>> Yeah.\n\n632\n00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:17.575\n>> As in victor.\n\n633\n00:29:17.575 --> 00:29:19.693\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's not gonna be easy.\n\n634\n00:29:19.693 --> 00:29:20.410\n>> It's not fun.\n\n635\n00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:21.470\n>> No.\nNot at all.\n\n636\n00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:25.190\nI am not even sure if it'll let me-\n>> Actually, it's all numbers isn't it?\n\n637\n00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.716\n>> It is.\n>> Yeah.\n\n638\n00:29:25.716 --> 00:29:26.600\n>> It's all numbers.\n\n639\n00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:30.375\nLuckily, instead of doing like Hex and\nhaving letters and numbers, and then we\n\n640\n00:29:30.375 --> 00:29:34.855\ngotta break out our military lingo to\ntry to get it to them, and they go, huh?\n\n641\n00:29:34.855 --> 00:29:38.613\nAnd you have to use things like Allan.\n\n642\n00:29:38.613 --> 00:29:39.345\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n>> Niner.\n\n643\n00:29:39.345 --> 00:29:41.855\n>> Yeah, fiver niner.\n\n644\n00:29:41.855 --> 00:29:42.580\n>> So there we go.\n\n645\n00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:43.760\nThere's my recovery key.\n\n646\n00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:44.690\nI'll go ahead and click next.\n\n647\n00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:48.600\nAnd it's gonna see if that matches up.\n\n648\n00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:55.320\nAnd we'll try.\nIt doesn't actually want me to click next.\n\n649\n00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.100\nThere we go.\n\n650\n00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:56.870\nError recovering disk.\n\n651\n00:29:56.870 --> 00:30:00.650\nSo because my,\nthe recovery key I typed is not correct?\n\n652\n00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:01.970\nYou lie to me.\n\n653\n00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:03.600\nI copied and pasted it.\n\n654\n00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.190\nOh, you know what?\n\n655\n00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:05.400\nI might have picked the wrong one.\n\n656\n00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I picked the second one thinking, okay,\n\n657\n00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.190\nit was the second one I did.\n\n658\n00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:10.518\n>> It could've just been\nin alphabetical order.\n\n659\n00:30:10.518 --> 00:30:11.390\n[LAUGH]\n>> It sorted it.\n\n660\n00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:13.200\nRight.\nAnd so the number was different there.\n\n661\n00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:17.030\nSo let's try, and let me make sure I don't\nget that trailing space this time as well.\n\n662\n00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:18.120\nSo we'll copy that one.\n\n663\n00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:21.990\n>> We'll flip back over to\nthis recovery key option.\n\n664\n00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.950\nWe'll wipe that out.\n\n665\n00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:24.530\nPlease don't.\n\n666\n00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:26.790\nYou really are gonna make me-\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n667\n00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:27.860\n>> It is.\n\n668\n00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:29.260\nIt doesn't make it easy for us, does it?\n\n669\n00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:32.270\nAnd we'll click next.\n\n670\n00:30:34.295 --> 00:30:35.065\nWe'll let it go.\n\n671\n00:30:35.065 --> 00:30:38.275\nAnd there we go,\nI have temporary access to this drive.\n\n672\n00:30:38.275 --> 00:30:41.335\nAnd so now I can go back in and\nmanage BitLocker.\n\n673\n00:30:41.335 --> 00:30:44.855\nIf I wanted to remove\nBitLocker from this drive, or\n\n674\n00:30:44.855 --> 00:30:47.065\nif I wanted to change the password\nto something I know, right?\n\n675\n00:30:47.065 --> 00:30:49.580\nCuz that's what I clicked,\nit said I forgot the password.\n\n676\n00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:54.050\nSo at this point I would change\nthe password to something else so\n\n677\n00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:58.110\nthat I wouldn't have to type in\nthat big old long key every time.\n\n678\n00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:58.890\nSo, really cool.\n\n679\n00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:01.640\nThe other thing that I love\nBitLocker to go is you\n\n680\n00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.320\ncan set it to recognize this machine.\n\n681\n00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.190\nAnd more than one machine, actually.\n\n682\n00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:08.570\nI use BitLocker on most\nof my thumb drives.\n\n683\n00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:11.660\nAnd when I come in to work and\nplug it into my computer, it says, oh,\n\n684\n00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.480\nthat's the computer I\nnormally get plugged into.\n\n685\n00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:14.850\nI don't type anything in it.\n\n686\n00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:16.370\nI just decrypts, right?\n\n687\n00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:19.160\nWhen I get home, I plug it into my\ncomputer at home, I don't type anything.\n\n688\n00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.250\nIt just decrypts.\n\n689\n00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:23.050\nBut if Daniel finds my thumb drive and\nplugs it into his computer,\n\n690\n00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:26.100\nit's gonna say, wait a second,\nI don't recognize this computer.\n\n691\n00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:29.920\nType in that pin for me or\ntype in that password before I decrypt.\n\n692\n00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.620\nSo people think, oh,\ngosh, that's such a pain,\n\n693\n00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:34.975\nI'm gonna have to type in this password\nevery time I plug in my thumb drive?\n\n694\n00:31:34.975 --> 00:31:35.650\nNo.\n\n695\n00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:39.470\nThey actually make it pretty darn\nconvenient with the ability to say, okay,\n\n696\n00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:43.220\nthis is a known computer,\nyou can automatically decrypt on that one.\n\n697\n00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:47.060\n>> Now, David in our chat room\nis asking about the IDs, right?\n\n698\n00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:51.230\nThose IDs are letting you know that\nthis ID goes with this specific volume.\n\n699\n00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:51.830\nIs that correct?\n\n700\n00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:52.508\n>> Exactly.\n\n701\n00:31:52.508 --> 00:31:55.109\nNow how you match that up can be tricky.\n\n702\n00:31:55.109 --> 00:31:57.506\nI'm not exactly sure\nwhere I'm gonna see that.\n\n703\n00:31:57.506 --> 00:32:00.928\nIn active directory it shows you So,\nif you're going in there, and\n\n704\n00:32:00.928 --> 00:32:03.931\nyou're looking at those keys\nyou'll see that drive ID, or\n\n705\n00:32:03.931 --> 00:32:07.290\nthat encryption ID on\nthe properties in there.\n\n706\n00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:10.010\nThis guy chose not to integrate\nit into Active Directory for\n\n707\n00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:12.130\nthis particular demo, so\nI can't show you that.\n\n708\n00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:13.090\nBut you would see it.\n\n709\n00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:15.830\nSo if you went into, and\nthen at the Properties in our computer in\n\n710\n00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:18.700\nActive Directory, you got\nthe BitLocker Drive Encryption tab.\n\n711\n00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:21.530\nYou can see the different volumes,\nand their IDs so\n\n712\n00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:25.692\nyou can map up which key went to which\nrecovery key, went to which volume.\n\n713\n00:32:25.692 --> 00:32:27.590\nSo it is gonna show you in there.\n\n714\n00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:30.680\n>> Yeah, I also know that if\nyou're getting this at boot time.\n\n715\n00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:34.730\n>> It will show you that volume ID there\nas well, so you can say here's my volume\n\n716\n00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:37.910\nID, and then the person that is\ntrying to get that recovery key for\n\n717\n00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:39.490\nyou can match that up right there.\n\n718\n00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:42.100\n>> In fact, let me see if we can go in\nhere Danny because I would think it would\n\n719\n00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:43.240\nshow you as well.\n\n720\n00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:48.430\nLet's pull up the Properties and just\nfind out if I've got that option here.\n\n721\n00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:54.680\nIt does not look like I do have\na way to see the Recovery,\n\n722\n00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:59.060\nor not the recovery key, but\nthe ID, yeah, from here.\n\n723\n00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:05.200\nWe go into manage BitLocker,\nthere's that option for automatically\n\n724\n00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:08.270\nunlock drive on this computer,\nthat's on our thumb drives as well.\n\n725\n00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:10.510\nDoesn't look like I have a way\nto go back and see that.\n\n726\n00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:14.380\nI'm sure it's buried in there somewhere,\nbut and most of the time, again,\n\n727\n00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:17.000\nwe're gonna be storing that\ninformation on Active Directory, or\n\n728\n00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.890\nas Daniel said, that when it boots\nup it shows you that volume ID.\n\n729\n00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:25.070\nAll right, so\nthat's pretty much BitLocker, good stuff.\n\n730\n00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:29.360\nAgain, it's another layer of security,\ngives me that full volume encryption.\n\n731\n00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:32.510\nI do like to differentiate\nbetween volume and disk, and\n\n732\n00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:34.340\nyou've probably heard me\nsay full disk encryption,\n\n733\n00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:39.385\nbecause that's what Microsoft calls it and\nthat's what most people refer to it as.\n\n734\n00:33:39.385 --> 00:33:40.405\nIt's a little misleading though.\n\n735\n00:33:40.405 --> 00:33:42.510\n>> Yeah\n>> Because if you have a physical drive\n\n736\n00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:45.030\nthat's divided up into\nthree different volumes,\n\n737\n00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:47.570\nyou encrypt each volume individually.\n\n738\n00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:49.400\nRight.\nWhen I go into Windows Explorer,\n\n739\n00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.300\nI'm clicking on the volume here.\n\n740\n00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:53.830\nIt doesn't know if that's on\nthe same physical drive or not, so\n\n741\n00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:54.780\nyou are doing it.\n\n742\n00:33:54.780 --> 00:34:00.660\nIt's really more accurate, I think, to say\nfull volume encryption than full disk but.\n\n743\n00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:02.300\nSix of one, half dozen of the other.\n\n744\n00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:03.632\n>> Whatever floats your boat.\n\n745\n00:34:03.632 --> 00:34:04.230\nAll right, Mikey,\n\n746\n00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:08.760\nis there anything else that we need to\ntalk about when it comes to this subject?\n\n747\n00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.360\nI think the only thing we've\ngot left really is VPNs, and\n\n748\n00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:13.200\nwe've covered that in other episodes.\n\n749\n00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:16.180\nI do just wanna,\nfrom an encryption standpoint,\n\n750\n00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:19.890\nlet's make sure to remember that\na VPN is a virtual private network.\n\n751\n00:34:19.890 --> 00:34:24.190\nAnd it's used when I need to traverse\nan unsecure portion of a network.\n\n752\n00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:26.680\nSo especially for\nwhen I'm home or travelling, and\n\n753\n00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:30.480\nI wanna connect back to the work network,\nand access resources I create that VPN\n\n754\n00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:35.330\ntunnel that encapsulates my packets and\nprotects them as they travel across that\n\n755\n00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:40.180\ninternet, or\nany unsecure portion of a network, right?.\n\n756\n00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:43.282\nThere's several protocols I can\nuse to tunnel, there's that PPTP,\n\n757\n00:34:43.282 --> 00:34:48.960\nPoint-to-Point Tunneling Protocol,\nL2TP, my Layer Two Tunneling Protocol.\n\n758\n00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:52.720\nSSTP, my Secure Sockets Tunneling\nProtocol, as well as IKEV2.\n\n759\n00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:58.310\nOne thing that I just wanna point out,\nPPTP is encryption.\n\n760\n00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:00.450\nIt's got built-in encryption capabilities.\n\n761\n00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:02.830\nIt's considered very weak at this point.\n\n762\n00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:03.610\nIt shouldn't be used.\n\n763\n00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:07.070\nIt used to be the default in\nWindows several versions ago.\n\n764\n00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:10.520\nBut at this point, it's not work,\nyou really shouldn't use it.\n\n765\n00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.580\nYou shouldn't rely on\nit to provide security.\n\n766\n00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:14.240\nIt's another one of those things.\n\n767\n00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:16.300\nKeep the honest person honest, maybe?\n\n768\n00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:19.610\nBut, if it's sensitive data,\nyou don't want to rely on that.\n\n769\n00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:21.350\n>> Definitely deprecate it at this point.\n\n770\n00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:22.590\n>> Yes, it absolutely is.\n\n771\n00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:23.325\nThank you NSA.\n\n772\n00:35:23.325 --> 00:35:25.210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So yeah.\n\n773\n00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:29.730\nL2TP (Layer Two Tunneling Protocol)\nactually doesn't have anything built-in\n\n774\n00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:32.700\nfor encryption, so\nwe bring along something else, and\n\n775\n00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:36.390\nthat's almost always IPSEC or\nInternet Protocol Security.\n\n776\n00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:39.450\nTo help us encrypt those L2TP tunnels.\n\n777\n00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:43.620\nAnother one, unfortunately,\nthat's not deprecated just yet, but\n\n778\n00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:47.650\nit's, IPSEC has got its issues as well,\nbut\n\n779\n00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:53.390\nthanks again NSA, but SSTP is using\nsecure socket telling protocol.\n\n780\n00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:55.370\nSo that's going over port 443.\n\n781\n00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:57.980\nWe have to set up certificates to do that.\n\n782\n00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:00.840\nIKEV2 also requires certificates.\n\n783\n00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.200\nUses very strong encryption.\n\n784\n00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.060\nThose are going to be your best options.\n\n785\n00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:08.240\nIf security is a concern, SSTP,\nSecure Socket Tunneling Protocol.\n\n786\n00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.650\nRelatively easy to set up.\n\n787\n00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:13.800\nHave to issue out certificates, but\nonce you get that done, pretty easy.\n\n788\n00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.790\nAnd it's convenient because\nit's using port 443,\n\n789\n00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:19.940\nwhich most firewalls\nare already set to allow.\n\n790\n00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:25.760\nWhereas if I'm using PPTP on 1723,\nor L2TP on 1701.\n\n791\n00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:29.200\nIf I go approve any firewalls\nthat aren't under my control,\n\n792\n00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:30.460\nI might have an issue with that, right?\n\n793\n00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:33.420\nBecause I can't open those ports up\nto allow that tunnel to come through.\n\n794\n00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:39.740\nSSTP uses a very common port, so\nit's considered easier to set up.\n\n795\n00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:43.080\nAnd SSL and TLS,\nthey're very secure protocol.\n\n796\n00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.580\nSo, should we get there?\n\n797\n00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:51.230\nAnd IKEv2, also a very secure as\nfar as our tunneling protocols.\n\n798\n00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:54.460\nSo, use one of those,\nunless you just have to use, for\n\n799\n00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:57.700\nbackwards compatibility, L2TP or PPTP.\n\n800\n00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:00.930\nAnd, of course, there's other tunneling\nprotocols outside of the Windows\n\n801\n00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:04.238\nenvironment, but this is a Microsoft\ntest so let's just focus on those.\n\n802\n00:37:04.238 --> 00:37:05.280\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n803\n00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.110\nAwesome stuff, Mike.\n\n804\n00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:06.730\nThank you so much.\n\n805\n00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:09.190\nI'll look forward to seeing you\nin the secret underground courts.\n\n806\n00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.837\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n807\n00:37:09.837 --> 00:37:10.926\n>> Looking forward to Gitmo.\n\n808\n00:37:10.926 --> 00:37:11.705\nSo that'll be fun.\n\n809\n00:37:11.705 --> 00:37:14.144\n>> I think I hear the black vans\npulling up outside right now.\n\n810\n00:37:14.144 --> 00:37:16.490\n[LAUGH]\n>> I was just kidding NSA.\n\n811\n00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:18.015\nI was kidding, no.\n\n812\n00:37:18.015 --> 00:37:19.510\n[LAUGH]\n>> Thank you it's a good thing.\n\n813\n00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:20.210\n>> Think.\n[LAUGH]\n\n814\n00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:21.010\n>> All right.\n\n815\n00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:23.880\nMike, we do thank you though for\nthese great demonstrations.\n\n816\n00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:27.940\nA lot of good information when it comes to\nencrypting our file systems, our files,\n\n817\n00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:31.160\nand things that are in the wild,\nand how we can do that.\n\n818\n00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:34.660\nWe got to use those protocols, got to\nkeep ourselves safe from the bad guys.\n\n819\n00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:35.950\nThat's what security is all about.\n\n820\n00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:37.440\nWe are going to go ahead and\nclose this show down.\n\n821\n00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:40.080\nNow, thank you so much for watching,\nsigning off for IT PRO TV.\n\n822\n00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.920\nI have been your host Daniel Howry.\n\n823\n00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:42.910\n>> And I am Mike Roderick.\n\n824\n00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:44.603\n>> And we will see you next time.\n\n825\n00:37:44.603 --> 00:37:51.280\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.860\nI'm your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n4\n00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.750\nJoining me today in the studio,\nwell, it's Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:21.650\nHow's it going, Mike?\n\n6\n00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:22.760\n>> Oh, it's going great Daniel.\n\n7\n00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.900\nI'm excited to be here.\n\n8\n00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.830\nWe've got more that great MTA\ncontent coming your way with\n\n9\n00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.360\nour security fundamentals.\n\n10\n00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.320\nAnd in this one, we're gonna be taking\na look at email protection and malware.\n\n11\n00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.760\n>> That's right,\nthe malware's out there, the baddies.\n\n12\n00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.270\nYou've probably heard of all\nthe different terms terminologies for it.\n\n13\n00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.240\nWe like to just use that umbrella\nterm nowadays, the malware.\n\n14\n00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.970\nWe've got crazy computer programs\nthat wanna get on your computer,\n\n15\n00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.830\ndestroy things, wreak all sorts of havoc,\nmake your life a misery.\n\n16\n00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.200\nAnd we've got to protect\nourselves against it.\n\n17\n00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.325\nWell, first thing we gotta do is, what are\nthese stinking things that are out there\n\n18\n00:00:54.325 --> 00:00:57.745\ntrying to thwart us in our,\nwe just wanna work on a computer.\n\n19\n00:00:57.745 --> 00:00:59.765\nI just want to get on the Internet,\nI wanna do some banking,\n\n20\n00:00:59.765 --> 00:01:04.540\nI wanna check websites, I don't wanna be\nconfronted with all these dirty little\n\n21\n00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.300\nprograms created by these\nnefarious people out there.\n\n22\n00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.440\nBut Mike,\nyou're gonna help us walk through this.\n\n23\n00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.350\nYou're gonna help explain\nto us what we can expect\n\n24\n00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.535\nwhen it comes to these vile little beasts.\n\n25\n00:01:14.535 --> 00:01:16.400\n>> Yep.\n>> And how we can recognize them.\n\n26\n00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.980\nAnd then we're gonna move in\nto what we can do about it.\n\n27\n00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.475\n>> Absolutely, the first thing,\nas Daniel said, is we've gotta recognize,\n\n28\n00:01:21.475 --> 00:01:24.400\nwe gotta understand what these\ndifferent types of attacks are.\n\n29\n00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.745\nThis isn't security plus,\n\n30\n00:01:25.745 --> 00:01:29.840\nwe're not diving super deep into every\nsingle type of malware that's out there.\n\n31\n00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.066\nBut there are a few that they specifically\ncall out in the objectives for\n\n32\n00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:35.610\nthis exam that I want\nyou to be familiar with.\n\n33\n00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.220\nAnd that first one, Daniel,\nis gonna be buffer overflow.\n\n34\n00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.920\nAnd this is one that we\ndon't hear about a lot or\n\n35\n00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.570\nit's not one that you see in the news.\n\n36\n00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.680\nIt might be a term that\nyou've never heard before.\n\n37\n00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.960\n>> Not common terminology.\n\n38\n00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.980\n>> It really isn't.\n\n39\n00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.820\nBut it is a very dangerous one,\n\n40\n00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.990\nand it's really one of the most\ndifficult ones to protect against.\n\n41\n00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.930\nA buffer overflow,\nlet's define what it is first.\n\n42\n00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.280\nApplications get assigned memory.\n\n43\n00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.310\nSo when that application is running,\n\n44\n00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.590\nit gets a spot in memory where it can\nstore data that it's working with or\n\n45\n00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.520\nmanipulating and\nit's assigned a certain range of memory.\n\n46\n00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.220\nAnd the idea behind a buffer\noverflow is I can feed into that\n\n47\n00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.480\nprogram extra data, start making it use\nup that buffer that it's been given or\n\n48\n00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.280\nthat memory allocation that that\napplication has been given.\n\n49\n00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.220\nAnd what's going to happen, one of two\nthings can happen as we fill that up.\n\n50\n00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.830\nYou can almost think of it like a cup,\nright.\n\n51\n00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.180\nAnd we start pouring just\nrandom bits into this buffer or\n\n52\n00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.440\nthis memory allocation for\nthe application.\n\n53\n00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.810\nWhen that gets full,\nit does one of two things.\n\n54\n00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.910\nIt could end up overwriting some of its\nown code because there's no room left so\n\n55\n00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.170\nit starts back at the beginning and\n\n56\n00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.750\nstarts writing some of its own code\nthat's been loaded up into memory,\n\n57\n00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.650\ncauses the application to crash, possibly\ncauses your operating system to crash.\n\n58\n00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.940\nThat's probably the best case scenario.\n\n59\n00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.640\nWorst case scenario is, instead of\nrewriting it into that same as it\n\n60\n00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.990\nfills up and just starting to rewrite over\nexisting data in that memory allocation,\n\n61\n00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.030\nit spills into the next block of memory.\n\n62\n00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.960\nAnd now the bad guy has the potential\nto call that next address and\n\n63\n00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.940\nmemory and execute code.\n\n64\n00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.250\nThese guys get really good.\n\n65\n00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.820\nWhat they do is they know\nexactly how much data\n\n66\n00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.220\nit's gonna take to fill up that buffer.\n\n67\n00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.230\nAnd so they'll just put ones or\nzeroes, random bits in there,\n\n68\n00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.670\nand as soon it gets to the top,\nthe code that they need to execute\n\n69\n00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.910\nis what gets spilled over\ninto the next memory address.\n\n70\n00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.170\nAnd then they call that memory address,\nand\n\n71\n00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.790\nthey can get their code executed,\npotentially with system level access.\n\n72\n00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.070\nNow the reason I say it's so\ndifficult to protect against\n\n73\n00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.110\nis because it's typically a vulnerability\nfound in the application.\n\n74\n00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.190\nSo if we're buying software, we don't\nhave any control over that, right.\n\n75\n00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.620\nI can't get into the code and\nsee how it's written.\n\n76\n00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.500\nIf we're writing our own software,\nthen I've gotta be aware of this, and\n\n77\n00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.045\nI've gotta be able to\ndeal with that situation.\n\n78\n00:03:57.045 --> 00:04:00.590\nAnd what happens when that\nbuffer starts getting full,\n\n79\n00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.030\nwhat does that application do?\n\n80\n00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.530\nThis has affected applications.\n\n81\n00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.535\nI know IE had an issue with\nbuffer overflow for a while.\n\n82\n00:04:06.535 --> 00:04:08.370\nThey've patched it.\n\n83\n00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.540\nSo lots of different applications.\n\n84\n00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.310\nEven operating systems can have\nissues with buffer overflow.\n\n85\n00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.325\nSo, something that we've\ngotta be aware of.\n\n86\n00:04:16.325 --> 00:04:17.760\nAnd honestly, Daniel, like you said,\n\n87\n00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.290\nthere's not a lot you can do about it\nother than making sure that the code, or\n\n88\n00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.490\nthe application, is patched, right, making\nsure we're getting all of our updates.\n\n89\n00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.190\nBecause these don't take too\nlong to detect typically, and\n\n90\n00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.630\nthe vendors will put out patches for\nthat, say, oh gosh, we've got this issue.\n\n91\n00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.290\nHere we go, we put out this patch,\nit's no longer a vulnerability.\n\n92\n00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.940\nIf we don't get that patch,\nwe could be vulnerable.\n\n93\n00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:38.520\n>> That's right.\n\n94\n00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.920\nNow, that is a very complex\ntype of attack even though,\n\n95\n00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.375\nas Mike kinda said, it is common,\nbut you don't hear about it so\n\n96\n00:04:45.375 --> 00:04:51.385\nmuch in the way you do more common things\nlike viruses and trojans and stuff.\n\n97\n00:04:51.385 --> 00:04:53.018\nAnd that's what we need to get into now,\n\n98\n00:04:53.018 --> 00:04:55.478\ncuz that is the really the calmest\nof it we gotta worry about.\n\n99\n00:04:55.478 --> 00:04:58.100\nBuffer overflows, they're gonna\nhandle that with system patches.\n\n100\n00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.770\n>> Exactly.\nSo when we talk about worms and viruses,\n\n101\n00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:01.930\nthat'd be the next thing.\n\n102\n00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.520\nAnd as Daniel said,\nthese are ones you hear about,\n\n103\n00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.780\nyou might've even dealt\nwith on your own systems.\n\n104\n00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.000\nThey do call out worms.\n\n105\n00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.340\nI'm gonna go ahead and mention viruses as\nwell because it kinda fits right in there.\n\n106\n00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.840\nAnd what I want to you to understand here\n\n107\n00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.250\nis the difference between a virus and\na worm.\n\n108\n00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.420\nA virus is a bit of code, malicious code,\nthat attaches itself to files.\n\n109\n00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.430\nSo what happens is, you download an\ninfected file and you open up that file.\n\n110\n00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.070\nWell, that file is now residing in\nmemory so your system can work with it.\n\n111\n00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.200\nSo is that virus, right.\n\n112\n00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.720\nIt's now in memory.\n\n113\n00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.420\nAnd what it does is it\ntries to attach itself to\n\n114\n00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.220\nanything else it can find in memory,\nother files that you might have open.\n\n115\n00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.610\nAnd now those files are infected as well.\n\n116\n00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.200\nWhen you save them, close them, save them,\nsend them over to your friends,\n\n117\n00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.130\nshare them out, what have you,\nnow all of sudden, they open up that file,\n\n118\n00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.850\nand that virus is residing\nin their memory and\n\n119\n00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.250\nanything that they have open can\npotentially become infected.\n\n120\n00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.700\nSo viruses need our help to spread.\n\n121\n00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.700\nSo they don't spread as fast as worms do,\nbut\n\n122\n00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.660\nthey're also a little more difficult\nto get rid of than a worm is.\n\n123\n00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.650\nBecause of the fact they attach\nthemselves to a file, I might\n\n124\n00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.670\nthink I've got everything, and there\nwas one file I missed that's infected.\n\n125\n00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:17.460\nI open up that one file and\nboom, there it goes,\n\n126\n00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.340\nmy infection is spreading again across\nanything that I've got open on my machine.\n\n127\n00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.420\nSo sometimes they can be a little\nmore difficult to eradicate\n\n128\n00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.130\nonce we've been infected.\n\n129\n00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.460\nBut their spread, it needs our help.\n\n130\n00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.400\nWithout us, sharing files,\n\n131\n00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.940\nthings like that, they have much\nmore difficult time spreading.\n\n132\n00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.170\nNow granted, there are some really\ncool ones that start diving into our\n\n133\n00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:42.580\nemail clients and things like that and\ntrying to attach themselves there.\n\n134\n00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.410\nBut for the most part,\nviruses need our help to spread.\n\n135\n00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.808\nWhereas a worm is a standalone program,\n\n136\n00:06:47.808 --> 00:06:51.560\na little block of code that\ndoesn't need our help, all right.\n\n137\n00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.497\nOnce a worm gets launched,\nit generates its own replication traffic,\n\n138\n00:06:56.497 --> 00:06:59.060\nand it goes from machine to machine.\n\n139\n00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.571\nAny machine that it can\nfind that's vulnerable,\n\n140\n00:07:01.571 --> 00:07:05.380\nit'll get on to that machine and\nthen start replicating from there.\n\n141\n00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.862\nAnd these guys can spread lightning fast.\n\n142\n00:07:08.862 --> 00:07:15.370\nIn fact, we had SQL Slammer at a place\nthat I worked at years ago, and\n\n143\n00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:20.300\none of the biggest Impacts was the network\ntraffic that it was generating, right.\n\n144\n00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.400\nI mean, we needed to find the worm and\nget rid of the worm.\n\n145\n00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.900\nThe problem was our network was saturated.\n\n146\n00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.680\nWe couldn't do anything, we had to\nstart pulling machines off the network\n\n147\n00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.080\nbecause of the replication traffic\nthat these guys were generating,\n\n148\n00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.360\nthat that SQL Slammer worm was generating,\nwas saturating everything.\n\n149\n00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.900\nI mean, you couldn't connect to a server.\n\n150\n00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.540\nYou couldn't do anything.\n\n151\n00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.370\nI've got a couple of diagrams here that\nI can show you to give you an idea.\n\n152\n00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.740\nThis was a Code Red.\n\n153\n00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:51.936\nAnd this is from the, and I never\ncan say their name right, caida.org.\n\n154\n00:07:51.936 --> 00:07:57.165\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH] If I said the name\nwrong, I apologize to to that company but\n\n155\n00:07:57.165 --> 00:08:01.398\nand they price a good information\nabout worms and viruses and\n\n156\n00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:04.476\nsome technical articles about these guys.\n\n157\n00:08:04.476 --> 00:08:06.620\nBut they've got this little animated gif.\n\n158\n00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.600\nAnd if you watch my timestamp,\nit's getting ready to start over.\n\n159\n00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:13.200\nSo there it's zero, and\nthis is a 24 hour period.\n\n160\n00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.630\nAnd you'll see that the number down here,\n\n161\n00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.960\nthe number of victims,\nis gonna grow exponentially.\n\n162\n00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.920\nYou can kinda see the last digits turning,\n\n163\n00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.080\nand now it's almost too fast\nto see the last digit turning.\n\n164\n00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:27.297\nAnd as we get up into 13 hours,\n14 hours, all of sudden,\n\n165\n00:08:27.297 --> 00:08:30.360\nit's just starts going crazy right.\n\n166\n00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.890\nAnd look where it went.\n\n167\n00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:35.470\nI mean just about everywhere you\nthink there's probably computers and\n\n168\n00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:36.650\nnetworks, is covered.\n\n169\n00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.850\nGreenland's safe, Siberia's safe.\n\n170\n00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:41.270\nIt's about it.\n\n171\n00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:44.340\nSo amazing how that thing\nspread in 24 hours.\n\n172\n00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.360\nAnd that's not the fastest one.\n\n173\n00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.420\nThere was another one called\nSapphire that came out 2003.\n\n174\n00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:53.440\nAnd this is a 30 minute window.\n\n175\n00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.810\nSo they're showing you zero.\n\n176\n00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:56.076\nYou can see the time stamp.\n\n177\n00:08:56.076 --> 00:08:58.900\n5:29 to six o'clock.\n\n178\n00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:04.740\nIn thirty minutes it almost went as far\nas Code Red did in twenty four hours.\n\n179\n00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:05.930\nMind boggling, Daniel.\n\n180\n00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:07.360\n>> Yeah, that is quick.\n\n181\n00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.900\nSo obviously worms are the more\nnefarious of the two even though\n\n182\n00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.580\nthey're kind of related.\n\n183\n00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.430\nJust gotta remember\nthe difference between a virus and\n\n184\n00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:17.370\na worm is a virus needs our\nhelp to propagate, the worm,\n\n185\n00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:20.057\nwell it's smart it can do it\nall by it's little lonesome.\n\n186\n00:09:20.057 --> 00:09:21.151\nAnd that's the devil.\n\n187\n00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:22.384\n[LAUGH]\n>> That it is, but\n\n188\n00:09:22.384 --> 00:09:25.067\nit also makes it a little bit\neasier to eradicate if I can get to\n\n189\n00:09:25.067 --> 00:09:28.300\nthe system it's a standalone thing\nit's not attached to a file.\n\n190\n00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.930\nSo if I can find it I can get rid of it.\n\n191\n00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.190\nAnd usually pretty cleanly so\nthat the upside of it.\n\n192\n00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:37.007\nThe problem is I've got to do every\ncomputer in the entire world,\n\n193\n00:09:37.007 --> 00:09:38.247\ncuz they're all infected.\n\n194\n00:09:38.247 --> 00:09:40.030\n[LAUGH] Every one within thirty minutes.\n\n195\n00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:40.665\nRight.\n\n196\n00:09:40.665 --> 00:09:42.930\n[LAUGH]\n>> Now Mike there's also spyware.\n\n197\n00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:45.540\nThat's a term we're all\nfamiliar with as well.\n\n198\n00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.650\nWhat the heck is actually spyware?\n\n199\n00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.560\nI mean is it, are they spying on us?\n\n200\n00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.340\n>> They are.\nYou know the idea behind spyware is that\n\n201\n00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.280\nit's gonna gather information\nwithout your knowledge.\n\n202\n00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.130\nThat's the key to spyware, right?\n\n203\n00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:00.530\nIf they ask you and you give it to them,\nwell, that's your own silly fault, or\n\n204\n00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.150\nmaybe they needed that information and\nyou're okay with that.\n\n205\n00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.090\nSpyware, however,\ntries to gather it without your knowledge.\n\n206\n00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:07.590\nThis is malware.\n\n207\n00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:10.210\nIt still falls under\nthat malware umbrella.\n\n208\n00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.840\nBut it gets onto your system and\nit starts monitoring.\n\n209\n00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.380\nIt could be designed to do anything.\n\n210\n00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:18.360\nMaybe it's just capturing your\nsurfing habits, right, and\n\n211\n00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.710\nsending it back to somebody.\n\n212\n00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:24.370\nThey wanna know what website you went\nto after you visited their site, so\n\n213\n00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:27.760\nthat they can spend their\nadvertising dollars properly.\n\n214\n00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.370\nThings like that.\n\n215\n00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:33.300\nSo they might have, I don't wanna say\ngood intentions but they're doing it for\n\n216\n00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.300\na reason but\nthey're doing it without your knowledge.\n\n217\n00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:39.610\nAnd that's just a mild one right,\ngathering your surfing habits.\n\n218\n00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:44.320\nThey could start gathering personal\ninformation, try to capture keystrokes and\n\n219\n00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.460\nthings like that that you're\ntyping in on your machine.\n\n220\n00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.870\nThat means they could get passwords,\naccount numbers, who knows what.\n\n221\n00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:54.630\nSo spyware is bad and\nthe key to remember about spyware is it's\n\n222\n00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:58.690\nmalicious software that's\ngathering information about you.\n\n223\n00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.470\nThey can be designed\nto FTP that stuff out.\n\n224\n00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:05.720\nThey might have to connect in to\nretrieve some of that information.\n\n225\n00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:10.200\nBut it can be nasty, but the good thing\nabout spyware is it's, if you got a good\n\n226\n00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.700\nantivirus running and you're keeping those\ndefinitions up to date, you're pretty safe\n\n227\n00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.590\nright, you still might fall victim to\na what's called a zero day attack.\n\n228\n00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:21.560\nWhen something new comes out,\nnobody's seen it before.\n\n229\n00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:26.340\nThere are no definitions from my\nanti-virus company because it's brand new.\n\n230\n00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:29.940\nSo there are some things you\nmight find yourself a victim of\n\n231\n00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.520\neven though you're keeping\nyour anti-virus up to date.\n\n232\n00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.910\nBut usually the numbers of that are pretty\nsmall because once an organization gets\n\n233\n00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:39.510\nhit with something like that, they have\nagreements with these began anti-virus\n\n234\n00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:43.170\ncompanies that they buy their product\nfrom, so they'll box up that machine.\n\n235\n00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:45.130\nThey'll send it off, and those and\n\n236\n00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:49.500\na virus companies will reverse engineer\nthat stuff, develop a new definition,\n\n237\n00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.950\nput it out for the rest of the public\nto have and then we're safe from that.\n\n238\n00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:56.775\nSo, unless it spreads within 30 minutes,\nyou're kind of SOL.\n\n239\n00:11:56.775 --> 00:11:59.340\n[LAUGH]\n>> You gotta have a whole lot of luck when\n\n240\n00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:03.110\nit comes to the 30-minute window\nto stop things from happening.\n\n241\n00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:04.690\nNow Mike, I've seen the light.\n\n242\n00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:06.450\nObviously malware bad.\n\n243\n00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:07.300\nWe don't want it.\n\n244\n00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.990\nI wanna stay away from it.\n\n245\n00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.670\nWhat can I do?\n\n246\n00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:10.670\nWhat can we do,\n\n247\n00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:14.100\nreally, to stop ourselves from getting\ninfected with different things?\n\n248\n00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.570\n>> You know that there's lots of things\nwe can do to protect ourself, Daniel.\n\n249\n00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:20.350\nI do want to mention one\nmore thing with the malware.\n\n250\n00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:21.650\nAnd that's Trojans.\n\n251\n00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:23.150\nWhen we talk about Trojans,\n\n252\n00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:28.115\nwe gotta remember they have to get these\nitems to our machine somehow and a Trojan,\n\n253\n00:12:28.115 --> 00:12:31.370\nand you guys are familiar with the story\nof the Greeks and the Trojans, right?\n\n254\n00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:32.760\nAnd they used that big horse.\n\n255\n00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.850\nThey said, oh, looks like something we\nwant and they gave us this pretty horse.\n\n256\n00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:37.320\nWe're going to bring it in.\n\n257\n00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:41.040\nAnd in the middle of the night,\nthe belly opens up and bad things happen.\n\n258\n00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.640\nThat's the idea, a Trojan in a computer\nworld is a delivery mechanism.\n\n259\n00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.350\nIt's going to look like something\nthat you want, turns out,\n\n260\n00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.710\nit probably wasn't, right?\n\n261\n00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:53.860\nBad guys are you going to use these?\n\n262\n00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:59.220\nThey wrap their malware up inside\nsomething else like a free game of Tetris,\n\n263\n00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:03.200\na link in an email that's promising\nyou money, things like this.\n\n264\n00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.920\nThat's their delivery mechanism.\n\n265\n00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.850\nAnd you think you're\ngetting what you want.\n\n266\n00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:08.170\nRight?\nYou're downloading this program.\n\n267\n00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:11.400\nHeck, the program might install and\nyou can play your game of Tetris and\n\n268\n00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.510\neverything works.\n\n269\n00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:15.740\nBut in the background that Trojan\nis delivering its payload,\n\n270\n00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:19.610\nit's setting up a little server that's now\nlistening on some port that you're not\n\n271\n00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:24.230\naware of and the bad guy's able to call\nin and get access to your machine.\n\n272\n00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:27.310\nAnd the reason these are so effective,\nI mean the reason we use these so much, or\n\n273\n00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:31.070\nthe bad guys use these so much,\nthey need to get into your system somehow.\n\n274\n00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:33.160\nAnd with today's security,\n\n275\n00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.300\nour networks can be pretty secure\nif they're set up properly.\n\n276\n00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:41.010\nIt's difficult for a bad guy to get\nin through both of my firewalls, my\n\n277\n00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:45.670\nscreen subnet, right, and make it all the\nway into those machines inside my network.\n\n278\n00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:49.440\nBut if I can get you to click on\nsomething and install it yourself and\n\n279\n00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.060\nhave it call out.\n\n280\n00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:52.520\nThat's a whole different ballgame.\n\n281\n00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.250\nNow I don't have to break through\nall that stuff because your\n\n282\n00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:56.803\nreturn traffic is going to be allowed.\n\n283\n00:13:56.803 --> 00:13:59.360\nRight?\nSo if you're requesting it unbeknownst to\n\n284\n00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.820\nyou but your system is requesting it, that\nreturn traffic's going to be allowed, and\n\n285\n00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:07.200\nthe bad guy's in and now he can try to\ntake over your machine or work on and\n\n286\n00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.490\ngetting access to other\nmachines on your network.\n\n287\n00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:14.110\nSo Trojan Horses are a primary\na delivery method for the malware.\n\n288\n00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.410\nIt gets a little confusing there\nbecause when you read about Malware and\n\n289\n00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:20.090\nyou're studying up on it, they talk\nabout trojans and worms and viruses.\n\n290\n00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:22.240\nUnderstand the Trojan is\nreally not the malware.\n\n291\n00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:26.110\nI wouldn't say it's not malware,\nbecause it is malware, but\n\n292\n00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:28.040\nit's not doing the dirty work, right.\n\n293\n00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.070\nIt's the payload in the Trojan\nthat's doing the dirty work.\n\n294\n00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:33.110\nAll right and then back to Dan.\n\n295\n00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:34.450\nYou do your thing so what do we do?\n\n296\n00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:35.140\nHow do we protect this?\n\n297\n00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.220\nYou know the most common way,\nas I was just saying,\n\n298\n00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.180\nto get these machines infected\non a network is email.\n\n299\n00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.520\nEverybody uses email.\n\n300\n00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.700\nWe open up our email,\n\n301\n00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:47.480\nwe click on links in those emails or\npictures that open up inside those emails.\n\n302\n00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.600\nThese are ways the bad guy\ncan get into our system.\n\n303\n00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:54.990\nSo besides running antivirus, antivirus\nis probably the biggest thing you can do,\n\n304\n00:14:54.990 --> 00:15:00.270\nmaking sure we're safe with our email is\nprobably the next best thing we can do.\n\n305\n00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:02.075\nSo to protect ourselves?\n\n306\n00:15:02.075 --> 00:15:06.675\nWell first thing is we run anti-spam\nbecause the spam is again a big\n\n307\n00:15:06.675 --> 00:15:10.025\ndelivery method for malware.\n\n308\n00:15:10.025 --> 00:15:14.505\nWe get these advertisements,\nwe click on links that say that my,\n\n309\n00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:20.280\nmy password needs to be updated on my\nPay Pal account or something like that.\n\n310\n00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:23.310\nThis kind of thing that they\ncan deliver through email.\n\n311\n00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:24.550\nAnd as soon as you click on it,\n\n312\n00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:28.990\nyou click on one of those links,\nyou download an attachment.\n\n313\n00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:32.040\nNow you run the risk of\ninfecting your machine.\n\n314\n00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:35.400\nSo if I can prevent that email\nfrom ever making it to your inbox.\n\n315\n00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.780\nThat's a good thing, right?\n\n316\n00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:39.070\nAnd we can run hardware devices that,\n\n317\n00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:43.920\nlike we have a Barracuda device here on\nour network that scans all this email.\n\n318\n00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.710\nAnd it has rules on it that say hey,\nif this is what's in the subject or\n\n319\n00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:50.690\nthis is found in the body\nthis is considered spam.\n\n320\n00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:52.900\nI'm not even to let it\nthrough to the user's inbox.\n\n321\n00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.237\nThat way they have no\nchance on clicking on it.\n\n322\n00:15:55.237 --> 00:15:57.472\n>> But, Mike,\nthey said I won a Vegas vacation.\n\n323\n00:15:57.472 --> 00:15:59.337\nHow could that not be true?\n\n324\n00:15:59.337 --> 00:16:00.179\nThey lied?\n\n325\n00:16:00.179 --> 00:16:02.042\n>> They might have, they might have.\n\n326\n00:16:02.042 --> 00:16:04.051\n[LAUGH]\n>> Liars.\n\n327\n00:16:04.051 --> 00:16:08.680\n>> So we run anti-spam to keep those from,\nthat way our users.\n\n328\n00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.580\nAgain, user education has\nto fall in here somewhere.\n\n329\n00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:15.040\nI've got to teach them, you didn't\nreally win that trip to Vegas, right?\n\n330\n00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.333\nThat's just a ploy to\nget you to click on it.\n\n331\n00:16:17.333 --> 00:16:17.850\n>> I'm writing a letter.\n\n332\n00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:19.531\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's\n\n333\n00:16:19.531 --> 00:16:20.458\nprobably gonna get flagged as Spam.\n\n334\n00:16:20.458 --> 00:16:23.760\n[LAUGH]\n>> So we do have to teach our users.\n\n335\n00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:30.070\nBut running some type of anti-spam device\nor setting up rules on the email server.\n\n336\n00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:31.460\nAs well as your own inbox.\n\n337\n00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.620\nYou can do the same thing for\nthings that are.\n\n338\n00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.998\nIf you're not running a hardware device,\nyour company's small and\n\n339\n00:16:35.998 --> 00:16:40.480\nyou can't afford something like that,\nyou can still set up rules on your inbox,\n\n340\n00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:44.480\nwhen it says free in the subject line\njust send it to your deleted folder.\n\n341\n00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.180\nDon't even bother looking at that email.\n\n342\n00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:53.520\nDevelop rules that help you\nfilter down those those spams,\n\n343\n00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.788\nget them out of your inbox, send them\nright over to your deleted folders.\n\n344\n00:16:56.788 --> 00:16:58.750\nOr again, at an enterprise level,\n\n345\n00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:02.040\nwe run hardware-based devices that\ndo that that help us with that.\n\n346\n00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:06.260\nLike here,\nI get hardly any spam on my email account.\n\n347\n00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:10.060\nNow occasionally, I have to go into that\nBarracuda and look at what's been flagged\n\n348\n00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:14.170\nas spam, because there might be something\nthat got flagged as spam that I needed.\n\n349\n00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:17.860\nFor some reason,\nthey sent me over a quarterly report and\n\n350\n00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:20.610\nit had the word free in the subject or\nsomething like that.\n\n351\n00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:24.280\nAnd now all of a sudden, it got flagged\nas spam, so we do have to watch that.\n\n352\n00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:28.110\nHave to be careful with the rules and make\nsure we're not getting too aggressive or\n\n353\n00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:32.160\nsometimes we can add senders to our\ntrusted senders that way if they\n\n354\n00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.850\nuse those kind of words\nin their subject or\n\n355\n00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:37.360\nin their body, we can still allow\nthose emails to come through.\n\n356\n00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:42.835\nAnd anti-virus I mentioned, I think we're\npretty familiar with what anti-virus is,\n\n357\n00:17:42.835 --> 00:17:46.173\nthe biggest thing there is make\nsure you're running some anti-virus\n\n358\n00:17:46.173 --> 00:17:47.520\nsoftware, right.\n\n359\n00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.300\nAnd make sure you're keeping up to date.\n\n360\n00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:50.450\nOut of date anti-virus software,\n\n361\n00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:53.460\nDaniel as about as good as not\nrunning anti-virus software.\n\n362\n00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.870\n>> That's right, Mike was talking\nearlier about those zero day exploits.\n\n363\n00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:59.740\nWe saw the how fast that\nworm traveled in 30 minutes.\n\n364\n00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:02.160\nWe need to be keeping our\nanti-virus systems up to date.\n\n365\n00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.400\nAnd the great thing is the companies\nthat provide anti-virus solutions,\n\n366\n00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:11.500\nthey're updating sometimes two and three\ntimes a day with new definitions, right.\n\n367\n00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.070\nSo you can set your anti-virus\nsoftware to say you know what,\n\n368\n00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:16.920\nupdate this software every\ntime new definitions come out.\n\n369\n00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.480\nWhen the company delivers them,\nI want them on my computer.\n\n370\n00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.440\nNow, that can cause a little bit\na network traffic, that's understandable.\n\n371\n00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.110\nSo if you've got a lot of computers,\nmaybe you wanna stagger that out.\n\n372\n00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:30.210\nBut, Mike, it's basically like having\na gate and knocking one of the walls down,\n\n373\n00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:33.980\nif you're not running antivirus with\nup-to-date antivirus definitions.\n\n374\n00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.230\n>> Absolutely.\n\n375\n00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:37.020\nAll right.\nSo let's take a look at a couple of\n\n376\n00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:40.390\nthe different attacks that\nwe can deal with with email.\n\n377\n00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:43.700\nThe first one, they call it on\nour objectives is spoofing.\n\n378\n00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:46.290\nAnd this can affect us\nin a couple of ways.\n\n379\n00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:48.990\nWith spoofing, we're really talking about.\n\n380\n00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:53.180\nTrying to send an email that looks\nlike it's from somebody else.\n\n381\n00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:57.940\nOr the bad guys, when they send their\nspam, they want to look like it came from\n\n382\n00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:01.620\nBank of America or\nfrom PayPal or what have you.\n\n383\n00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:06.650\nSo they can spoof either the senders\ninformation, the name, or\n\n384\n00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:08.710\nthe IP address in these emails.\n\n385\n00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:13.050\nAnd maybe try to get through some of\nthose filters or get that user to go,\n\n386\n00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:14.370\noh, that's Bank of America.\n\n387\n00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:15.500\nI bank there.\n\n388\n00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:19.780\nThis must be something that I need to\nlook at and I need to open it up and and\n\n389\n00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:23.040\npossibly even click on one of\nthose links in that email, so\n\n390\n00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:27.510\nspoofing is a big issue that we\nhave to deal with, with emails.\n\n391\n00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:30.490\n>> So spoofing is basically\nlike masquerading as or\n\n392\n00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:31.640\nimpersonating something.\n\n393\n00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:32.570\n>> Exactly right.\n\n394\n00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:35.150\nYeah.\nAnd it's easy for the bad guys to do.\n\n395\n00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:37.200\nSo we have to be careful with that.\n\n396\n00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.410\nAgain teaching your users that your,\n\n397\n00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:45.540\nyou know your bank is not gonna send you\nan email asking for your password or\n\n398\n00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:47.520\ntelling you it's time\nto reset your password.\n\n399\n00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:53.260\nI see people getting emails from banks\nthat they don't have accounts with.\n\n400\n00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:54.330\n>> That's my favorite.\n\n401\n00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:56.740\nThat is literally my favorite thing.\n\n402\n00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.700\nWorked on a help desk and\nwould people call and say,\n\n403\n00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:02.490\nI got this email from From TD Bank,\nor Bank of America, or whatever.\n\n404\n00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:05.460\nAnd they said there's some issue with\nmy account, or transferring funds,\n\n405\n00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:06.820\nthere was a problem.\n\n406\n00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:07.580\nShould I call them?\n\n407\n00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.490\nWell do you have an account with TD Bank?\n\n408\n00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:10.510\nNo.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n409\n00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:11.490\n>> Well, then you're probably\n\n410\n00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:14.840\nnot sending any funds to them and\nyou don't have an account with them.\n\n411\n00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:15.912\nThey're not gonna email you.\n\n412\n00:20:15.912 --> 00:20:16.412\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n413\n00:20:16.412 --> 00:20:17.950\n>> It just makes sense.\n\n414\n00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:19.320\n>> You would think.\n\n415\n00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:23.930\nWe do know that common sense is\nnot all that common sometimes.\n\n416\n00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:27.230\nAll right so we got spoofing and\nthen we got phishing.\n\n417\n00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:30.790\nAll right, phishing with a ph,\nnot the old fly reel or\n\n418\n00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:35.720\nanything like that, and the idea behind\nphishing is, we send out emails trying to\n\n419\n00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:40.660\nget people to click on links and\nlead them to fraudulent sites.\n\n420\n00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:44.220\nLike the PayPal example, you know\nthat was a very big one for a while.\n\n421\n00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:47.390\nThese emails would come out and say, hey,\nyour PayPal account information is out of\n\n422\n00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:52.050\ndate, we need you to log in and set your\npassword, or update your information.\n\n423\n00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:57.100\nYou click on that link, and you go to a\nsite that looks just like PayPal, and you\n\n424\n00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:01.350\nstart updating your information and you\nclick submit, and nothing happens, right?\n\n425\n00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:03.770\nOr they make it look like\nsomething happened, but\n\n426\n00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:07.590\nyou're not dealing with PayPal,\nit's not really updating your information.\n\n427\n00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:11.530\nOr if they're really good, they'll\nhave you submit the information and\n\n428\n00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:14.600\nnothing happens, and what most users do if\nthey click it once and nothing happens?\n\n429\n00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:15.370\nWhat do they do, Daniel?\n\n430\n00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:17.095\n>> They click it again.\n\n431\n00:21:17.095 --> 00:21:19.330\n>> They click it again.\nRight and that second time.\n\n432\n00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:21.690\n>> Obviously they didn't\nclick it hard enough, Mike.\n\n433\n00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:22.621\n>> Yeah.\n[CROSSTALK] So\n\n434\n00:21:22.621 --> 00:21:25.944\nthey click it a third time or\na fourth time and And then I go ahead and\n\n435\n00:21:25.944 --> 00:21:29.953\nlet them redirect to the actual PayPal\nsite and it updates their information.\n\n436\n00:21:29.953 --> 00:21:32.640\nAnd most people are gonna blow\nthat off like, temporary glitch.\n\n437\n00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.930\nDon't know what happened but,\nhey, it seems to be working now.\n\n438\n00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:39.840\nIn the meantime, that fraudulent site\ncaptured everything you were submitting.\n\n439\n00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.950\nSo they know what you updated your\npassword to, or whatever the case may be,\n\n440\n00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:45.870\nand now they're connecting\nto PayPal as you.\n\n441\n00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.760\nSo that's phishing.\n\n442\n00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.710\nThere's also farming.\n\n443\n00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:53.220\nAnd farming, they'll describe\nfarming as phishing without a lure.\n\n444\n00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.490\nIt's kind of an interesting\nway of looking at it.\n\n445\n00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:59.100\nBut phishing, we're sending out\nemails to our intended victims, so\n\n446\n00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.280\nwe're trying to pick.\n\n447\n00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:03.210\nMaybe we pick all of the people\nin a certain organization.\n\n448\n00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:08.760\nOr I've got a list of email addresses\nthat I purchased from some black site or\n\n449\n00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:13.300\nsomething, where I've got a list of\nemails that I've bought from somebody.\n\n450\n00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:16.540\nSo it's kind of what's\ncalled a targeted attack.\n\n451\n00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:18.900\nWith farming, we don't have the targeting.\n\n452\n00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.560\nWe're not using a lure.\n\n453\n00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:24.390\nWhat we do is we try to do,\ndifferent ways of getting you to,\n\n454\n00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:26.770\nyou're still trying to get\nthem to a fraudulent site.\n\n455\n00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:30.960\nBut instead of directing\nan email out to pick my victims,\n\n456\n00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.040\nI might just modify some DNS records and\n\n457\n00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:38.885\ntry to say, anybody that tries to go\nto this site, redirect them to my site.\n\n458\n00:22:38.885 --> 00:22:41.650\nSo farming,\nit's kinda like phishing without a lure.\n\n459\n00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:45.050\n>> So Mike now that we understand\nwhat phishing and farming is,\n\n460\n00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:46.630\nwhat is it that we can do about that?\n\n461\n00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:48.810\nI mean, I've got a link in an email.\n\n462\n00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:52.420\nThey say it looks like PayPal,\nI'm gonna click on that obviously.\n\n463\n00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:55.250\nHow do I know that that's\nnot the real link to PayPal?\n\n464\n00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:56.330\nAnd I'm getting that kind of stuff.\n\n465\n00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:58.770\nWhat can we do in our\nemail system to stop that?\n\n466\n00:22:58.770 --> 00:22:59.990\n>> There's a couple things we could do,\nand\n\n467\n00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:04.700\nagain it goes back to user education is\nyour primary defense against this, right.\n\n468\n00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:07.300\nTeaching them,\nhey if you get an email from PayPal, and\n\n469\n00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:11.170\nit says your information\nneeds to be updated, fine.\n\n470\n00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:13.450\nOpen up a separate window, a browser.\n\n471\n00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:15.050\nGo to PayPal.\n\n472\n00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:17.230\nLog in.\nThey're gonna have a message there.\n\n473\n00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:19.430\nRight.\nIf they took the time to send you an email\n\n474\n00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:23.050\nthat said, hey, you need to come to update\nyour information, rather than clicking on\n\n475\n00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:28.070\nthe link in the email to get to PayPal,\nI'm gonna navigate to PayPal myself.\n\n476\n00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:32.030\nAnd I'll log in and I'll see and again\nthe same information should be there.\n\n477\n00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:33.970\nHey we need you to\nupdate your information.\n\n478\n00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:37.000\nWhat you don't do is use the link in\nthe email because you don't know if that's\n\n479\n00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.720\nsending you to the actual PayPal or\n\n480\n00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:43.010\nto some fraudulent site that's\ntrying to mimic PayPal.\n\n481\n00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:46.370\nSo on the client end of things,\nrunning spam filters,\n\n482\n00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:48.670\nmaking sure that I'm\nblocking most of that spam.\n\n483\n00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:51.170\nAdding people to blocklist,\n\n484\n00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:54.220\nif you're getting spam, blocking those\nemails from even coming through.\n\n485\n00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:56.111\nAnd then, not clicking on links,\n\n486\n00:23:56.111 --> 00:24:00.560\nnot opening up attachments from places\nthat you don't know or you don't trust.\n\n487\n00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:05.317\nIf you get an email from some random\nperson and there's an attachment on there,\n\n488\n00:24:05.317 --> 00:24:06.457\ndon't open it up.\n\n489\n00:24:06.457 --> 00:24:07.758\nDelete the email.\n\n490\n00:24:07.758 --> 00:24:08.462\nAll right.\n\n491\n00:24:08.462 --> 00:24:10.188\n>> Paranoia pays in this business,\ndoesn't it.\n\n492\n00:24:10.188 --> 00:24:11.728\n>> It really does.\n\n493\n00:24:11.728 --> 00:24:14.660\nAnd don't click on those links.\n\n494\n00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:17.710\nIt's too easy to make a link that\nlooks like it's going to PayPal but\n\n495\n00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:22.480\nwe've hidden the actual data,\nthe URL that that link is sending you to.\n\n496\n00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:27.320\nSo use your education,\nteaching them not to click on links.\n\n497\n00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.710\nUsing your spam filters to try\nto block some of that email\n\n498\n00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:32.680\nfrom getting in in the first place.\n\n499\n00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:36.600\nOn the server side of things, there\nare some things we can do as IT admins.\n\n500\n00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.610\nWe're managing those email servers.\n\n501\n00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:41.000\nWe can try to do some of\nthe protection there.\n\n502\n00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.780\nOne of the things I'll talk about\nis the sender policy framework.\n\n503\n00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:49.290\nAnd what this is a way that we can, we\nknow spam's bad, and we know it's a huge\n\n504\n00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:54.210\nproblem out there for organizations\njust dealing with the volumes of spam.\n\n505\n00:24:55.950 --> 00:25:00.090\nGosh I think, I remember reading\nthe percentage of spam versus actual email\n\n506\n00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:00.980\nis mind boggling.\n\n507\n00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:04.750\nThere's more spam than actual email,\nthat's out there floating around.\n\n508\n00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:07.980\n>> Be awesome to spin up a server and\nturn off all spam protection, and\n\n509\n00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:09.635\nsee how much you get in one day.\n\n510\n00:25:09.635 --> 00:25:10.210\n[LAUGH]\n>> Absolutely.\n\n511\n00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:12.380\nAnd you think, what's the big deal?\n\n512\n00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:14.760\nIt's just a couple of extra emails.\n\n513\n00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.900\nThe problem is my users\nare losing productivity,\n\n514\n00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.090\nthey're spending time going\nthrough these emails.\n\n515\n00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:22.090\nAnd if I want, I don't even want\nto get them to their inbox.\n\n516\n00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:25.830\nBut I've got to buy equipment, I've got\nto manage these lists to try to prevent\n\n517\n00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:27.990\nthat from getting to their\nsystem in the first place.\n\n518\n00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:30.760\nSo it is, it's a lot of\nadministrative effort that goes into\n\n519\n00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:31.930\ntrying to keep us safe.\n\n520\n00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:36.520\nThat center policy framework that I\nmentioned, this is a system designed where\n\n521\n00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:43.110\nI can go in and I can specify what hosts\nare allowed to send email using my domain.\n\n522\n00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:43.750\nAll right.\n\n523\n00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:46.370\nSo I can say, look,\nthis is my mail server.\n\n524\n00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:50.405\nAnything that comes from,\nany email that has a source of\n\n525\n00:25:50.405 --> 00:25:53.860\nITPro.TV should be\ncoming from these hosts.\n\n526\n00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:55.840\nMaybe have more than one email server.\n\n527\n00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.560\nThese are the hosts that\nare allowed to send out email\n\n528\n00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.150\nwith my domain attached to it.\n\n529\n00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:04.710\nThat prevents the bad guy, the bad guy\ncannot now host his own e-mail server,\n\n530\n00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:08.860\nforge those source addresses, or\nthose senders' information, and\n\n531\n00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:10.390\nsend out email in my name.\n\n532\n00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:13.730\nBecause that sender policy framework\nis going to say, wait a second, this is\n\n533\n00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:19.370\na from ITPro.TV, but it didn't come from\none of the known hosts for ITPro.TV.\n\n534\n00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:20.920\nWe're going to flag it.\n\n535\n00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.100\nWe're going to mark it as spam.\n\n536\n00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:27.610\nThat helps us as an organization say these\nare the legitimate email servers for\n\n537\n00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:28.770\nthis domain.\n\n538\n00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:32.625\nThese are the only ones that should\nbe sending email from this domain.\n\n539\n00:26:32.625 --> 00:26:38.020\n[COUGH] Other thing we can do is we\ncan set up what we call PTR records.\n\n540\n00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.320\nThis is, kind of it goes back to DNS,\n\n541\n00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:44.400\nand within DNS we have what's\nknown as a reverse lookup zone.\n\n542\n00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.490\nNormally DNS works with forward look ups.\n\n543\n00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:51.890\nMeaning I know the name, and\nI want to resolve the IP address, so\n\n544\n00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:54.200\nthat I can connect to that resource.\n\n545\n00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.680\nReverse lookup is when you\nknow the IP address and\n\n546\n00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:59.840\nyou need to turn that back into a name.\n\n547\n00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:02.430\nYou guys can all relate to this when\nyou think about your phone calls.\n\n548\n00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:04.960\nEver get a phone call and\nall you see is the number,\n\n549\n00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.920\nit doesn't show you the caller ID or\nanything like that?\n\n550\n00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.640\nYou want to know who it comes from,\nwell, you can do reverse lookup.\n\n551\n00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:15.160\nNormally, you want to call Bob,\nyou look up Bob and you get the number.\n\n552\n00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.670\nIn this case you've got\nthe phone number and\n\n553\n00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:18.730\nyou want to know what name\nis associated with it.\n\n554\n00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:20.650\nThat would be a reverse lookup.\n\n555\n00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:24.420\nDNS supports the same thing so\nthat we can look at an IP address and\n\n556\n00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:27.110\nfigure out what name goes\nwith that IP address.\n\n557\n00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:30.920\nWhen it comes to email in these\nPTR records, I can register,\n\n558\n00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.850\nrecreate records from my mail servers so\n\n559\n00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:37.920\nthat that IP address maps back\nto the name of my mail server.\n\n560\n00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.930\nAnd in that way when the spam\nengines are looking at that,\n\n561\n00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:45.130\nthey can see the IP\naddress of the the sender.\n\n562\n00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:47.100\nAnd they can do a reverse look up.\n\n563\n00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.480\nAnd if that doesn't map back to the name,\nthe proper name,\n\n564\n00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:55.400\nis says it's coming from ITProTV, I go\ninto reverse look up in this IP address.\n\n565\n00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:58.920\nAnd it maps to XYZ.ru right?\n\n566\n00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.160\nWait, that's not ITProTV.\n\n567\n00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.650\nThat doesn't seem right.\n\n568\n00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:06.840\nThe sender's name is ITProTV, but the IP\naddress maps back to a different name.\n\n569\n00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.580\nAll of a sudden, something's funny.\n\n570\n00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:10.030\nAnd we can try to block that.\n\n571\n00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:12.510\nSo that's what those PTR\nrecords are gonna do.\n\n572\n00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:14.670\nThey're going to allow us to.\n\n573\n00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:17.550\nDo that reverse look up to verify that,\nthat name and\n\n574\n00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:21.800\nthat IP address are matching like they\nshould, when we receive those emails.\n\n575\n00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:25.190\nSo a few things we can do on\nthe server side of things\n\n576\n00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:28.090\nto try to help protect our\nusers from this malware.\n\n577\n00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:28.770\n>> Awesome.\n\n578\n00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:31.930\nWell that's good to know that even though\nthere are bad things out there trying to\n\n579\n00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:33.820\ntake over our systems, do bad things for\n\n580\n00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:36.060\nour systems,\nwe're not left without recourse.\n\n581\n00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:38.020\nWe have things that we can implement.\n\n582\n00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:41.610\nAntivirus systems obviously are going to\nbe a one of our best lines of defense.\n\n583\n00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:44.790\nAnd user, man, user education,\nthat is a huge one.\n\n584\n00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:47.240\nYou understanding what\nan attack looks like and\n\n585\n00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.020\nthat's what the show is about today.\n\n586\n00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:50.500\nTrying to help you do that.\n\n587\n00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:51.590\nWe're going to educate you so\n\n588\n00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:54.330\nwhen you see those attacks you go oh,\nthat's a phishing attack.\n\n589\n00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:56.320\nI saw that on Mike and Daniel's show.\n\n590\n00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.170\nIt was awesome.\n\n591\n00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:59.260\nNow I know that I'm not\ngoing to click on that link.\n\n592\n00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:01.720\nThat's completely not what I want to do.\n\n593\n00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:04.730\nNow you're going to see and\nyou can educate your users and\n\n594\n00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:07.100\ndown the line they go and\npeople can stay out of it.\n\n595\n00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:09.560\nWe could,\nnot get their systems taken over.\n\n596\n00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:12.240\nMike, is there anything else we\nneed to cover for today's show?\n\n597\n00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:12.780\n>> I don't think so.\n\n598\n00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:16.190\nI think we hit all the big points we need\nto be familiar for this exam anyway.\n\n599\n00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:17.260\n>> Awesome.\nExcellent.\n\n600\n00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:18.800\nWell, hopefully you guys\nget a lot out of this.\n\n601\n00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.380\nThis is a great episode to\nrewatch over and over again and\n\n602\n00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:23.210\nmake sure you understand these concepts.\n\n603\n00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:25.190\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off though, for ITProTV.\n\n604\n00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:27.140\nI've been you're host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n605\n00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:27.770\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n606\n00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:30.346\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n607\n00:29:30.346 --> 00:29:30.990\n[SOUND]\n\n",

another fantastic\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:18.230\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.120\nAnd joining me on the show today is\nnone other than my good friend, Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.820\nMike Rodrick.\n\n7\n00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.690\nHow's it going today, Mike?\n\n8\n00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.040\n>> Oh, it's going great Daniel.\n\n9\n00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.160\nI'm excited as always.\n\n10\n00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.169\nWe got our MTA content coming your way.\n\n11\n00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.233\nAnd in this one we're gonna be\ntaking a look at firewalls and\n\n12\n00:00:30.233 --> 00:00:32.695\nsomething called\nNetwork Access Protection.\n\n13\n00:00:32.695 --> 00:00:34.862\nSo there's good exciting\nstuff in the show I think.\n\n14\n00:00:34.862 --> 00:00:36.023\n>> Yes, we do love-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n15\n00:00:36.023 --> 00:00:37.009\n>> The security around here.\n\n16\n00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:39.166\nAnd especially when it comes to\ntopics like, oh, I don't know,\n\n17\n00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:40.039\nsecurity fundamentals.\n\n18\n00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:41.823\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You might be studying for\n\n19\n00:00:41.823 --> 00:00:43.280\nan exam along those lines.\n\n20\n00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.262\nSo that's where we're at today.\n\n21\n00:00:44.262 --> 00:00:48.640\nWe gotta take a look at some of the ways\nwhich we can control our networks.\n\n22\n00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.650\nMake them more secure.\n\n23\n00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.750\nWe've got a lot of cool\nstuff to show you today.\n\n24\n00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.950\nMichael, where do we even begin?\n\n25\n00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.040\nWe have quite a myriad\nof things to go through.\n\n26\n00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.576\n>> We really do.\nAnd\n\n27\n00:00:55.576 --> 00:00:59.376\nsome of them are not maybe as\nrelated as we typically do.\n\n28\n00:00:59.376 --> 00:01:01.860\nBut, the first thing we're\ngonna start with is firewalls.\n\n29\n00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.050\nAnd we've got other episodes\nin this particular class or\n\n30\n00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.640\nset of videos that we\ntalk about firewalls.\n\n31\n00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.330\nAnd we contrast and compare software\nfirewalls versus hardware firewalls.\n\n32\n00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.090\nBut they do call out again in\nthis particular objective,\n\n33\n00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.770\nwe're talking about understanding\ndedicated firewalls.\n\n34\n00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.114\nThese are going to be\nhardware based firewalls and\n\n35\n00:01:23.114 --> 00:01:27.449\nthey have a dedicated purpose, right?\n\n36\n00:01:27.449 --> 00:01:28.622\nAnd that's where we're\nheading with this one.\n\n37\n00:01:28.622 --> 00:01:33.486\nAnd the two that they call out are gonna\nbe a unified threat management and\n\n38\n00:01:33.486 --> 00:01:36.370\nthen a secure content management device.\n\n39\n00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.120\nThese are both gonna be hardware devices,\nkinda separate purposes though.\n\n40\n00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.020\nBut they are really specialized firewalls,\n\n41\n00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.152\nthey kind of go above and\nbeyond what a normal firewall might do.\n\n42\n00:01:47.152 --> 00:01:50.730\nAnd let's review, just to make sure\nwe remember what a firewall is.\n\n43\n00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.120\nRemember a firewall is a device that\ntraffic is going to pass through.\n\n44\n00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.710\nAnd it gives us a chance to block or\n\n45\n00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.160\nallow that traffic depending on what\nthat firewall's capabilities are.\n\n46\n00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.870\nAnd we can look at protocol numbers,\nor port numbers.\n\n47\n00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.490\nWe can look at IP address ranges or\n\n48\n00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.740\neven content, depending on what type\nof firewall we're working with.\n\n49\n00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.410\nWe can decide whether or\nnot to allow that traffic through or not.\n\n50\n00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.130\nAnd we put firewalls in different places.\n\n51\n00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.010\nAgain, check out that other episode\nwhere we kind of break down\n\n52\n00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.600\nthe basics of the firewalls.\n\n53\n00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.820\nHere, they do wanna call out again, that\nunified threat management type device.\n\n54\n00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.030\nAnd this is a hardware device\nthat does firewalls, but\n\n55\n00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.690\nit does a whole lot more than firewalls.\n\n56\n00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.910\nIt's like a multifunction device.\n\n57\n00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.670\nSo, when we look at this\nit's a way to kinda make,\n\n58\n00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.440\nwhat's a good way to say it, Daniel?\n\n59\n00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.730\nIt centralizes everything.\n\n60\n00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.880\n>> Mm.\n>> In our networks,\n\n61\n00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.540\nwe're gonna wanna run firewalls, right?\n\n62\n00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.740\nWe've gotta have those.\n\n63\n00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.110\nWe've gotta have IPSs or\nintrusion prevention systems.\n\n64\n00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.153\nWe're gonna want to have antivirus,\nan anti-malware, and\n\n65\n00:02:53.153 --> 00:02:57.420\nanti-spyware, anti all\nthe other bad stuff, right?\n\n66\n00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.050\nThat could be all separate devices or\nseparate applications that are doing this.\n\n67\n00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.470\nA unified thread management right?\n\n68\n00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.643\nThe name kind of tells\nyou what it's gonna do.\n\n69\n00:03:06.643 --> 00:03:09.100\nWe're gonna bring it\nall under one umbrella,\n\n70\n00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.384\nwe're gonna have this one device that can\ndo all of that, that can do antivirus,\n\n71\n00:03:13.384 --> 00:03:15.730\nanti-spam, it can do content filtering.\n\n72\n00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.240\nIt does its firewall capabilities.\n\n73\n00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.050\nIt can even report back on what\nits blocked or what its allowed,\n\n74\n00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.850\nand things like that.\n\n75\n00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.030\nSo it really does just\nbring it all together.\n\n76\n00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.570\n>> Yeah Mike,\nthese devices are super awesome.\n\n77\n00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.280\nAnd it's kind of the way of things.\n\n78\n00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.056\nIt's how things are going nowadays.\n\n79\n00:03:30.056 --> 00:03:34.265\nThey're saying, you know what, why go out\nand purchase this separate device and\n\n80\n00:03:34.265 --> 00:03:37.130\nthis separate device and\nthis separate software.\n\n81\n00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.289\nWell, I have to go into this\nportal to manage this one.\n\n82\n00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:41.516\nAnd this other device has its own portal.\n\n83\n00:03:41.516 --> 00:03:44.140\nAnd I've gotta SSH into this thing,\nand do that and the other.\n\n84\n00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.406\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Put it all under one house,\n\n85\n00:03:46.406 --> 00:03:47.333\nunder one roof.\n\n86\n00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:49.817\nMake it do all those things very,\nvery well.\n\n87\n00:03:49.817 --> 00:03:53.590\nBecause normally that's why we would\ngo for separate devices, right, Mike?\n\n88\n00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.740\nBecause this device is the top dog,\nand that's why I want this.\n\n89\n00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.851\nAnd this hot device does antivirus, but\nit's better than all the other ones, so\n\n90\n00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:02.010\nI gotta grab that one.\n\n91\n00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.480\nUTM tries to take all that and\nconglomerate it,\n\n92\n00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.960\nmake it all the best in one world,\nunder one roof, one management system, so\n\n93\n00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.980\nyou're not everywhere trying to\nadministrate this nightmare.\n\n94\n00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.470\n>> Exactly, and so from that\ndescription that Daniel just gave you,\n\n95\n00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.750\nyou can probably see both the cons and\nthe pros\n\n96\n00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.760\nto running something like a unified\nthread management interface or device.\n\n97\n00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.680\nAnd, let's start with the pro's.\n\n98\n00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.250\nAs Daniel eloquently put,\na single management interface, right?\n\n99\n00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.260\nBecause I know here,\n\n100\n00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.270\nto get into my spam filter I've got to\nconnect to this barracuda device and\n\n101\n00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.340\nfigure out how to connect, figure out\nits interface, and work with that.\n\n102\n00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.153\nTo work with my antivirus, we've got our\nantivirus console that I've got to figure\n\n103\n00:04:40.153 --> 00:04:41.789\nout, oh wait,\nwhat server's that running on?\n\n104\n00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:43.354\nWhat's my password for that one?\n\n105\n00:04:43.354 --> 00:04:45.940\nHow's this user interface laid out?\n\n106\n00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:46.980\nHow is it organized?\n\n107\n00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.240\nHow do I work with it?\n\n108\n00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.238\nAnd on down the line.\n\n109\n00:04:49.238 --> 00:04:54.100\nBy bringing it all together, single\nconnection point to do all the management.\n\n110\n00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.190\nSingle interface to learn.\n\n111\n00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.920\nSo ease of administration is pretty high\nwith these unified threat management.\n\n112\n00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.870\nI mean, granted,\nthey can still be complex.\n\n113\n00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.260\nDon't get me wrong,\nbecause you are doing a lot, right?\n\n114\n00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.532\nDepending on that device, it might be\ndoing intrusion prevention, and antivirus,\n\n115\n00:05:09.532 --> 00:05:12.873\nand anti-spamware, and firewall,\nand all of this other stuff.\n\n116\n00:05:12.873 --> 00:05:18.039\nSo, it's not that its simple but it is\nnice if I take the time to learn this\n\n117\n00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:23.056\none interface, I'll be able to\nmanage all that stuff through there.\n\n118\n00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:24.112\nSo that's a good thing.\n\n119\n00:05:24.112 --> 00:05:29.800\nThe down side is,\nit's all on one device, right?\n\n120\n00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.030\nSo, if it ever fails, well guess what?\n\n121\n00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.528\nIf my firewall fails, we can get another\nfirewall put back up, and in the meantime.\n\n122\n00:05:37.528 --> 00:05:39.188\nI still had antivirus running.\n\n123\n00:05:39.188 --> 00:05:40.558\nI still had antispam running.\n\n124\n00:05:40.558 --> 00:05:42.996\nI still had intrusion prevention,\nthings like that.\n\n125\n00:05:42.996 --> 00:05:45.777\nAnd now that I've put\nit all on one device,\n\n126\n00:05:45.777 --> 00:05:48.800\nwhen it fails, I've lost everything.\n\n127\n00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.079\nI mean I'm completely vulnerable at this\npoint, well, depending on how we set it\n\n128\n00:05:52.079 --> 00:05:54.469\nup, I'd probably just lose\nnetwork access all together.\n\n129\n00:05:54.469 --> 00:06:00.180\nSo it's not like my network is suddenly\nexposed to everything, but, any external\n\n130\n00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.250\nusers are gonna lose access to\nthe network, and it's gonna be a problem.\n\n131\n00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.290\nSo, that's the downside of these guys.\n\n132\n00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:12.290\nBy bringing it all together, we're really\ncreating a single point of failure and\n\n133\n00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.960\nthat can become a little bit of a problem.\n\n134\n00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.412\nAlso, is it kept up to date?\n\n135\n00:06:17.412 --> 00:06:22.480\nIf you have a dedicated antivirus\nsolution, that's all those people do.\n\n136\n00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.700\nThey're pumping out new\ndefinitions all the time.\n\n137\n00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.570\nIf this is a combo device, do they\nspend as much time on antivirus, but\n\n138\n00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.005\nthey've also gotta send you updates for\nthis, that, and the other.\n\n139\n00:06:32.005 --> 00:06:37.110\nSo, is that organization large\nenough to give you that type of\n\n140\n00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.480\ndedicated service for antivirus as well as\nintrusion prevention and things like that.\n\n141\n00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.738\nSo, those are just some of\nthe things you've gotta think about.\n\n142\n00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:48.270\nIf you're gonna run\nunified threat management,\n\n143\n00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.140\nyou really need to think\nabout fault tolerance.\n\n144\n00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.920\nYou should have more than\none of those devices.\n\n145\n00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.430\nBecause, like I said, if that one fails,\neverything goes down.\n\n146\n00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.050\n>> Yeah, and\nthat's just kind of the way it is.\n\n147\n00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.526\nIf you want that ease of administration,\nyou're gonna have to pay the piper,\n\n148\n00:07:02.526 --> 00:07:04.959\nand make sure that you have\nanother one sitting there.\n\n149\n00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:09.335\nMaybe a hot spare that's just sitting in a\nrack somewhere waiting to have the switch\n\n150\n00:07:09.335 --> 00:07:10.158\nflipped to it.\n\n151\n00:07:10.158 --> 00:07:13.636\nSo that if, no, I should say when,\nthe other device,\n\n152\n00:07:13.636 --> 00:07:17.810\nyour main device finally does go down,\nit just rolls right over.\n\n153\n00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:21.270\nNow that's gonna cost you a little bit\nmore money, but, that security and\n\n154\n00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.540\nthat ease of management\nmight work itself out.\n\n155\n00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.967\nThis is something you're gonna have\nto figure out in the support world.\n\n156\n00:07:26.967 --> 00:07:29.205\nYou just kinda have to figure out,\nwhat is my best solution?\n\n157\n00:07:29.205 --> 00:07:32.088\nUTMs, especially with\nsmaller shops can do that,\n\n158\n00:07:32.088 --> 00:07:35.450\nbecause they're not having\nto support multiple vendors.\n\n159\n00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:38.936\nThey're not having to, oh now I've got\nto go to Symantec, and I've gotta go to\n\n160\n00:07:38.936 --> 00:07:42.331\nWebsense, and I've gotta to go whatever\nfire, maybe Cisco for a firewall.\n\n161\n00:07:42.331 --> 00:07:45.709\nAnd I've got all these different\nlicences and things to keep up with.\n\n162\n00:07:45.709 --> 00:07:48.845\nUTM kinda takes care of that,\ncuz you got one person to deal with.\n\n163\n00:07:48.845 --> 00:07:50.041\nOne vendor to deal with.\n\n164\n00:07:50.041 --> 00:07:53.629\nAnd it makes that ease of\nadministration happen for you,\n\n165\n00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:55.660\nso that could be a good way to go.\n\n166\n00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.145\nAnd as they get better at what they do,\n\n167\n00:07:58.145 --> 00:08:02.573\nnow they're starting to dip into\nthe big boys' pockets, and say,\n\n168\n00:08:02.573 --> 00:08:06.710\nhey now, I'm gonna be just as good\nas you are and easier to use.\n\n169\n00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:08.830\nSo I'm gonna have people\ncome over to my side.\n\n170\n00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:11.040\nBut the UTMs are not the only thing\non the market though, right Mike,\n\n171\n00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:11.730\nwe also have SCMs.\n\n172\n00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:15.980\n>> We have SCMs,\nour good old secure content management.\n\n173\n00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:21.540\nAnd this is CMS or content\nmanagement systems are designed to,\n\n174\n00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.810\nit can be a hardware device but\nit can also be an application.\n\n175\n00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:29.450\nBut it's a place where,\nit's content management, right?\n\n176\n00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:33.600\nUsers are generating files and they're\nsharing files with their co-workers, and\n\n177\n00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.070\nthey're downloading copies,\nof these documents,\n\n178\n00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.290\nand editing them or what have you.\n\n179\n00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:41.040\nSo content management is a big\npart of what we have to do.\n\n180\n00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.000\nAnd we've got to keep that secure.\n\n181\n00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.550\nAnd when I say keep it secure, I mean\nmaking sure that authorized people have\n\n182\n00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:48.340\naccess to what they should have access to.\n\n183\n00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.230\nIf you're not authorized,\nyou shouldn't have access to it.\n\n184\n00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.920\nIf you do have access,\nwhat level of access do you have?\n\n185\n00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.830\nAre we gonna give you read capabilities or\nread and write and modify?\n\n186\n00:08:58.830 --> 00:08:59.720\nHow do I control that?\n\n187\n00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.520\nWhat about if you're uploading\na document that's infected?\n\n188\n00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.640\nThat's the last thing I want,\n\n189\n00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:08.010\nis to upload an infected document\ninto my content management system\n\n190\n00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:12.890\nwhere it could potentially infect\nall of those other files out there.\n\n191\n00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:16.280\nSo a good secure content\nmanagement system is a must.\n\n192\n00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.982\nThese are things like Joomla!,\nor what was it, Drupal.\n\n193\n00:09:20.982 --> 00:09:21.841\n>> Drupal, yeah.\n\n194\n00:09:21.841 --> 00:09:25.940\n>> Or there's a few of them out there\nthat are gonna do this for you.\n\n195\n00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:30.680\nAnd again, they're typically a combination\nof antivirus, anti-malware, and\n\n196\n00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.730\ncontent filtering.\n\n197\n00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:35.610\nMaking sure I can control what\ntypes of content is being\n\n198\n00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.110\nstored up there in my\ncontent management systems.\n\n199\n00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:40.150\nSo a couple things that\nwe gotta think about,\n\n200\n00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:44.010\nthese are, again, as we were talking\nabout before the show, right?\n\n201\n00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:48.590\nWe've got NTFS, we know we can use\nthat to control access to resources.\n\n202\n00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.656\nThis steps it up a notch,\nit gives us another level of control.\n\n203\n00:09:51.656 --> 00:09:56.287\nTypically allows us to make\nit available to the intranet,\n\n204\n00:09:56.287 --> 00:10:01.680\ninternally, kind of like\na collaboration software, if you will.\n\n205\n00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.116\nSo a couple things we need to be\nfamiliar with, think about those.\n\n206\n00:10:05.116 --> 00:10:08.066\nAgain, for\nthis exam they don't want you to go in and\n\n207\n00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:11.030\nset up a secure content management system.\n\n208\n00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:14.220\nWhat they're gonna wanna make sure you\nunderstand is, where would I use this,\n\n209\n00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.550\nwhen would I use this,\nor why would I use this.\n\n210\n00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:19.380\nAnd if I need to provide,\nI need to do content management,\n\n211\n00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:23.280\nI need to control all the documents\nthat these users are creating.\n\n212\n00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.290\nAnd here we have a need for that.\n\n213\n00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:29.160\nWe have offices in different locations and\nI don't want them to be isolated.\n\n214\n00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.610\nI want a nice centralized\ncontent management system.\n\n215\n00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:35.750\nAnd so now all my different branches\ncan work with these same documents.\n\n216\n00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:39.580\nI don't have multiple copies of the same\ndocuments that get changed, and\n\n217\n00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.750\nwhich one's the latest version,\nand things like that.\n\n218\n00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:46.610\nAnd being able to do that securely because\nlike in our case we do expose it to\n\n219\n00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:47.810\nthe Internet.\n\n220\n00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.550\nI mean it's still private,\nwe make a VPN connection to get to it,\n\n221\n00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:54.450\nbut technically it is\naccessible from the outside.\n\n222\n00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:58.530\nSo a couple devices there, UTM,\nunified threat management, and\n\n223\n00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:01.510\nsecure content management.\n\n224\n00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:04.580\nThe other thing we got to think\nabout with firewalls is going\n\n225\n00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.720\nto be the type of firewall, or\nI don't want to say the class or\n\n226\n00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.920\nthe level of the firewall, but\nthey can do different things.\n\n227\n00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:15.960\nOne, there's a stateful and\nthere's stateless type inspections\n\n228\n00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:20.560\nthat these firewalls can do on\nthe traffic as it flows back and forth.\n\n229\n00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:24.975\nThe simpler one is the stateless,\nand in a stateless firewall,\n\n230\n00:11:24.975 --> 00:11:29.580\neach packet that comes through\nis analyzed independently.\n\n231\n00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:34.850\nThat means it doesn't know about\nwhat we would call a conversation or\n\n232\n00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:37.740\na state, hence the name stateless.\n\n233\n00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:42.110\nEvery individual packet that comes through\nis looked at, compared against the rules,\n\n234\n00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:45.490\nand decided whether or\nnot I should allow or deny that packet.\n\n235\n00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:48.900\nAnd then it does that,\nit either drops it or allows it through.\n\n236\n00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.160\nThe next packet that comes through,\nit starts all over.\n\n237\n00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.022\nIt says all right, here's what I gotta do,\nthese are my rules,\n\n238\n00:11:54.022 --> 00:11:55.570\ndoes it match, yes or no?\n\n239\n00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:57.800\nThat's gonna be a stateless firewall.\n\n240\n00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.701\nA firewall that does a stateful\ninspection, remembers state or\n\n241\n00:12:03.701 --> 00:12:06.169\nit understands conversations.\n\n242\n00:12:06.169 --> 00:12:08.744\nIn other words,\nif I'm going through a firewall and\n\n243\n00:12:08.744 --> 00:12:12.910\nI connect to a file server and I'm sending\ndata back and forth with that file server.\n\n244\n00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:17.370\nit is going to see those packets and\ngo, oh wait, the first packet comes\n\n245\n00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:21.730\nthrough and it says all right is this\nallowed to go through to that file server?\n\n246\n00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:22.760\nYes it is.\n\n247\n00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.490\nWell that return traffic\nfrom that file server goes,\n\n248\n00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:27.880\noh, that's part of that conversation.\n\n249\n00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:32.560\nI don't have to do an inspection on that,\nI'm just gonna go ahead and allow it.\n\n250\n00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:36.350\nMy return traffic, when I go back to\nthat file server is conversation that my\n\n251\n00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:41.120\ncomputer and that file server are having,\nis seen just as that, as a conversation.\n\n252\n00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.420\nSo once it's matched the rules,\n\n253\n00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:46.590\nonce it's allowed, it doesn't have to\ndo that same inspection on each one.\n\n254\n00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:49.990\nNow, it can still look at\ncontent if it needs to,\n\n255\n00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:52.770\nif we wanna do content inspection\non the packets themselves.\n\n256\n00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:57.528\nBut it makes it much simpler on\nthe firewall because he doesn't\n\n257\n00:12:57.528 --> 00:13:00.592\nhave to have such a complex set of rules.\n\n258\n00:13:00.592 --> 00:13:04.070\nOr have a, like I said,\nonce it sees that conversation is allowed,\n\n259\n00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:08.020\nit doesn't have to look at every\nsingle packet in that conversation.\n\n260\n00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:10.555\nIt just says, oh yeah,\nI've okayed that conversation,\n\n261\n00:13:10.555 --> 00:13:12.117\nI'm gonna allow that to continue.\n\n262\n00:13:12.117 --> 00:13:15.275\nAnd it makes it a lot\neasier on these firewalls.\n\n263\n00:13:15.275 --> 00:13:17.870\nSo that's the difference there.\n\n264\n00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:23.962\nWith stateless, all you're really\ndoing is looking at source and\n\n265\n00:13:23.962 --> 00:13:30.076\ndestination IP address, protocol,\nand port, with stateless.\n\n266\n00:13:30.076 --> 00:13:33.425\nAnd it has to that for\nevery single packet that comes through.\n\n267\n00:13:33.425 --> 00:13:37.790\nWith stateful we can start\nlooking at content within there,\n\n268\n00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:40.600\ncertain key words that\nare in those packets.\n\n269\n00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.870\nAnd much less overhead,\nagain, on the firewall,\n\n270\n00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:47.740\nwhich gives me better performance,\nespecially in a busy environment.\n\n271\n00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:50.200\n>> Yeah, and\nthe statefuls are actually pretty awesome.\n\n272\n00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:54.200\nThey have a whole lot more ability\nbecause they can look into the packet.\n\n273\n00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.570\nThese next gen firewalls are insane.\n\n274\n00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:00.860\nYou can actually give them your\nencryption keys, your private keys, and\n\n275\n00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:04.760\nas encrypted data comes in it can\ndecrypt it, check it for a problem.\n\n276\n00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.670\nMake sure it's actually\nwhat you're looking for,\n\n277\n00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:08.870\nthen re-encrypt it back up and\nsend it on its way.\n\n278\n00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:12.680\nSo it can actually look at encrypted\nfiles as they cross the network,\n\n279\n00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.202\nmaking sure that there's nothing bad or\nnefarious going on.\n\n280\n00:14:16.202 --> 00:14:19.510\nAs where those stateless ones\nare basically just a rule set.\n\n281\n00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:24.470\nACLs, does it meet this condition,\nif it does then do this.\n\n282\n00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:26.825\nIf it doesn't, move to the next one\nuntil you hit the end of the list.\n\n283\n00:14:26.825 --> 00:14:29.241\nAnd that's really the simple\nway of how they work.\n\n284\n00:14:29.241 --> 00:14:32.577\n>> Yeah, and that's a great point with\nthe encryption because if it's encrypted,\n\n285\n00:14:32.577 --> 00:14:35.780\ntraffic on one of those stateless\nfirewalls, it can't look inside there.\n\n286\n00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:39.283\nSo this is a way that bad guys or\nmalicious users can try to get content\n\n287\n00:14:39.283 --> 00:14:42.360\nthat shouldn't be allowed\nthrough that firewall.\n\n288\n00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.790\nLet's encrypt it because it can't see\ninside the packet, it can't look at\n\n289\n00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:50.020\nanything else other than that source and\ndestination IP port and protocol.\n\n290\n00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:53.260\nAll right, so\nthat's a little bit about firewalls again.\n\n291\n00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.000\nWatch the other episode where\nwe talked more about hardware\n\n292\n00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.060\nversus software firewalls and\nwhere we might place these firewalls.\n\n293\n00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:04.804\nThe next thing we're going to talk about,\nDaniel, is gonna be NAP.\n\n294\n00:15:04.804 --> 00:15:06.337\n>> Oh, I can't wait to take a nap,\nnaps are awesome.\n\n295\n00:15:06.337 --> 00:15:08.286\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is the part\n\n296\n00:15:08.286 --> 00:15:09.193\nof the show where we sleep.\n\n297\n00:15:09.193 --> 00:15:09.895\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes,\n\n298\n00:15:09.895 --> 00:15:11.190\nwhere is our warm milk and cookies?\n\n299\n00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:14.394\n>> A little siesta for\nthe ITProTV crew and audience.\n\n300\n00:15:14.394 --> 00:15:15.579\n>> It is, it's good times, yes.\n\n301\n00:15:15.579 --> 00:15:16.809\nAll right, we'll see you in five.\n\n302\n00:15:16.809 --> 00:15:19.319\n[LAUGH] When we talk about NAP here,\n\n303\n00:15:19.319 --> 00:15:24.130\nwe're talking about good old\nnetwork access protection.\n\n304\n00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:28.180\nAnd network access protection is\na fantastic solution from Microsoft\n\n305\n00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:31.000\nthat allows me to examine clients.\n\n306\n00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.550\nRun them through a series of checks before\nI allow them access to the network.\n\n307\n00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:40.240\nAnd that's key,\nespecially in today's environments.\n\n308\n00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.590\nIt used to be, way back in the day like,\na year ago in computer speak,\n\n309\n00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:48.860\nbut way back in the day, I mean,\nall we had were desktops, right?\n\n310\n00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.940\nEverybody had a desktop, they came in\nto work, they sat at that desktop,\n\n311\n00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:54.380\nthey did their work, and\nthey went home, right?\n\n312\n00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:57.460\nWell those computers,\nthey were always under my control.\n\n313\n00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.323\nThey were in my network, they never left.\n\n314\n00:15:59.323 --> 00:16:02.622\nSo I can control what\nsoftware's installed on there.\n\n315\n00:16:02.622 --> 00:16:06.943\n>> I can control their settings via group\npolicy and all my security configurations,\n\n316\n00:16:06.943 --> 00:16:07.693\neverything.\n\n317\n00:16:07.693 --> 00:16:13.777\nI can keep those guys in a good secure\nconfiguration using my existing tools.\n\n318\n00:16:13.777 --> 00:16:15.994\nWell, the networks have changed, though.\n\n319\n00:16:15.994 --> 00:16:20.700\nAs we've gotten more and more mobile\ndevices and the whole BYOD idea,\n\n320\n00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:25.407\nbring your own device, allowing users\nfrom home to use their personal\n\n321\n00:16:25.407 --> 00:16:30.214\ncomputers to connect back to work and\naccess network resources there.\n\n322\n00:16:30.214 --> 00:16:32.270\nThese are computers that\nare not under my control.\n\n323\n00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:36.374\nEither never under my control,\nlike in the case of that home PC or\n\n324\n00:16:36.374 --> 00:16:38.888\nmobile devices that leave my control.\n\n325\n00:16:38.888 --> 00:16:41.852\nI always like to say,\nleave my trusted environment and\n\n326\n00:16:41.852 --> 00:16:43.986\nthey go out to these strange networks.\n\n327\n00:16:43.986 --> 00:16:48.084\nAnd by that, I mean, like Starbucks and\nthe hotel or other companies.\n\n328\n00:16:48.084 --> 00:16:51.983\nIf I've got a roaming salesperson that's\nout that there doing sales calls.\n\n329\n00:16:51.983 --> 00:16:54.283\nWell, I don't know those networks,\nthey're not under my control.\n\n330\n00:16:54.283 --> 00:16:57.664\nWho knows what those devices could\npick up and then they come back and\n\n331\n00:16:57.664 --> 00:17:00.527\nI'm just supposed to allow\nthem to plug in to my network.\n\n332\n00:17:00.527 --> 00:17:02.327\nThink about that user's home computer.\n\n333\n00:17:02.327 --> 00:17:06.681\nIt's that one PC that sits in the office\nthat everybody in the family shares.\n\n334\n00:17:06.681 --> 00:17:08.145\nIt's got one account on there,\n\n335\n00:17:08.145 --> 00:17:11.685\nthat's that built in administrator\naccount that nobody, everybody uses.\n\n336\n00:17:11.685 --> 00:17:14.377\nThey don't have individual accounts,\nso everybody in the family.\n\n337\n00:17:14.377 --> 00:17:18.777\nAll the surfing they do, who knows\nwhat they're doing on that home PC.\n\n338\n00:17:18.777 --> 00:17:20.344\nAre they even running antivirus?\n\n339\n00:17:20.344 --> 00:17:22.040\nDo they know what a firewall is?\n\n340\n00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.442\nI have no idea, it's not under my control.\n\n341\n00:17:24.442 --> 00:17:26.990\nYet, I'm gonna allow it\nto VPN back into work and\n\n342\n00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:29.179\nstart connecting to file servers there?\n\n343\n00:17:29.179 --> 00:17:30.561\nYeah, I don't think so.\n\n344\n00:17:30.561 --> 00:17:33.498\n>> I dealt with this a lot in\nthe corporate environment.\n\n345\n00:17:33.498 --> 00:17:36.342\nI have people that,\neven just as much as a flash drive.\n\n346\n00:17:36.342 --> 00:17:39.361\nThey would take their flash drives\nfrom work with work data on it.\n\n347\n00:17:39.361 --> 00:17:42.210\nTake it home, plug it into that\nhome computer that everybody and\n\n348\n00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:44.921\ntheir brother has access to and\nthen they'd come into work.\n\n349\n00:17:44.921 --> 00:17:48.704\nAnd all of a sudden, my antivirus system\nstarts sending me emails, so and so\n\n350\n00:17:48.704 --> 00:17:50.018\ncomputers are infected.\n\n351\n00:17:50.018 --> 00:17:53.347\nSo I go to their on and we do a virus\nscan, make sure we clean them up,\n\n352\n00:17:53.347 --> 00:17:55.136\nmake sure everything is good to go.\n\n353\n00:17:55.136 --> 00:17:58.341\nAnd give them the talk about, hey,\nnow you don't want to and what do they do?\n\n354\n00:17:58.341 --> 00:18:01.116\nThey take that thing home, they plug\nit back into their home computer.\n\n355\n00:18:01.116 --> 00:18:03.322\nThey bring it back and the next day,\nthey're infected again.\n\n356\n00:18:03.322 --> 00:18:05.947\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I'd have to smack their hand and\n\n357\n00:18:05.947 --> 00:18:07.883\nsay, now, now What are you doing?\n\n358\n00:18:07.883 --> 00:18:08.975\nWhat sites are you going to?\n\n359\n00:18:08.975 --> 00:18:10.124\nWell, I'm not doing anything.\n\n360\n00:18:10.124 --> 00:18:11.460\nAre you taking anything home?\n\n361\n00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.641\nWell, I take my USB key home.\n\n362\n00:18:13.641 --> 00:18:15.035\nWell, that's where\nthe infection is coming from.\n\n363\n00:18:15.035 --> 00:18:18.598\nCuz every time you plug that thing in,\nyour computer gets infected.\n\n364\n00:18:18.598 --> 00:18:21.594\nWe have to segregate\nthose environments or.\n\n365\n00:18:21.594 --> 00:18:26.074\nWe need to be able to control what\nthe outside user is doing before they\n\n366\n00:18:26.074 --> 00:18:28.560\nare allowed to attach to our network.\n\n367\n00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.798\n>> Exactly right and\nNAP gives us that ability.\n\n368\n00:18:31.798 --> 00:18:34.147\nWe can now, hey,\nbefore you're allowed to and\n\n369\n00:18:34.147 --> 00:18:36.337\nI'll tell you where we\ncan do these checks.\n\n370\n00:18:36.337 --> 00:18:40.012\nBut before you're allowed to connect, I'm\ngonna run you through some checks here and\n\n371\n00:18:40.012 --> 00:18:43.152\nI'm gonna make sure that you're\ncompliant with our company's policy.\n\n372\n00:18:43.152 --> 00:18:44.510\nAnd if you are, great.\n\n373\n00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:46.658\nAnd if you're not, not so good for you.\n\n374\n00:18:46.658 --> 00:18:48.516\nI'm not gonna let you connect.\n\n375\n00:18:48.516 --> 00:18:53.496\nSo let's talk about that first, when we\ntalk about Network Access Protection.\n\n376\n00:18:53.496 --> 00:18:56.757\nWe'll get into what we can check for\nhere in just a second.\n\n377\n00:18:56.757 --> 00:19:01.317\nBut first, the general concept of it is\nwe're gonna have machines that are gonna\n\n378\n00:19:01.317 --> 00:19:03.340\nattempt to connect to our network.\n\n379\n00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:06.981\nAnd before they're allowed to connect,\nwe're gonna run them through a series of\n\n380\n00:19:06.981 --> 00:19:09.631\nhealth checks and\nwe're gonna see if they're compliant.\n\n381\n00:19:09.631 --> 00:19:13.289\nAnd we can control what we're checking for\nand if they are compliant,\n\n382\n00:19:13.289 --> 00:19:16.575\nI will give them full network access and\nthey will be good to go,\n\n383\n00:19:16.575 --> 00:19:18.873\njust like any other\nmachine on the network.\n\n384\n00:19:18.873 --> 00:19:22.692\nIf they're not compliant,\nthen I've got a couple of options.\n\n385\n00:19:22.692 --> 00:19:27.417\nIf they're not compliant,\nI can turn on auto remediation.\n\n386\n00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:30.911\nWe can setup what's called\na remediation portion of our network.\n\n387\n00:19:30.911 --> 00:19:33.267\nA little quarantine zone, if you will.\n\n388\n00:19:33.267 --> 00:19:37.192\nAnd when they go to connect, we can say,\noh, wait a second, you're not compliant.\n\n389\n00:19:37.192 --> 00:19:41.072\nSo I'm going to let you access this\nquarantined part of my network, but\n\n390\n00:19:41.072 --> 00:19:41.978\nnothing else and\n\n391\n00:19:41.978 --> 00:19:45.875\nyou're gonna stay in there until you\ncan prove that you are compliant.\n\n392\n00:19:45.875 --> 00:19:49.875\nAnd then in that remediation area,\nI can do auto-remediation,\n\n393\n00:19:49.875 --> 00:19:52.725\nlike if it's simply\nturning the firewall on.\n\n394\n00:19:52.725 --> 00:19:56.917\nWell, I can have a policy that reaches\nout to that client machine goes in their\n\n395\n00:19:56.917 --> 00:19:59.771\nsecurity center and\nturns the firewall on for them.\n\n396\n00:19:59.771 --> 00:20:03.336\nIf they're missing Windows updates or\nthey're not running an antivirus,\n\n397\n00:20:03.336 --> 00:20:06.066\nmaybe I've got a file service\nsitting in a remediation and\n\n398\n00:20:06.066 --> 00:20:09.742\nthey can install the company antivirus\nsoftware and they can get it up to date or\n\n399\n00:20:09.742 --> 00:20:13.726\nthey can connect to my WSUS server and do\ntheir Windows updates to become compliant.\n\n400\n00:20:13.726 --> 00:20:17.471\nAnd then as soon as they are compliant,\nwhether it was done automatically or\n\n401\n00:20:17.471 --> 00:20:21.390\nthey had to do it manually, I'll let them\nout of the quarantine and they can have\n\n402\n00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:24.928\naccess to the rest of the network or\nI can choose not to remediate at all.\n\n403\n00:20:24.928 --> 00:20:25.625\nI can say, you know what?\n\n404\n00:20:25.625 --> 00:20:28.086\nYou're not compliant,\nyou don't get access.\n\n405\n00:20:28.086 --> 00:20:31.522\nTypically, we don't wanna do that,\nbecause we want them to be able to access.\n\n406\n00:20:31.522 --> 00:20:34.981\nWe want them to do the work when they're\non the road or from home or what have you.\n\n407\n00:20:34.981 --> 00:20:39.099\nSo we set up that remediation portion of\nour network, that little quarantine area\n\n408\n00:20:39.099 --> 00:20:42.263\nthat we can put them off into until\nthey can become compliant and\n\n409\n00:20:42.263 --> 00:20:43.769\nthen it doesn't stop there.\n\n410\n00:20:43.769 --> 00:20:47.566\nThe processors gonna continually\nmonitor these machines.\n\n411\n00:20:47.566 --> 00:20:49.712\nAnd if they ever become noncompliant,\n\n412\n00:20:49.712 --> 00:20:53.103\nwe'll kick them right back out\nto that remediation portion.\n\n413\n00:20:53.103 --> 00:20:56.382\nYou might think, oh, oh, oh, I'm gonna\nturn on my firewall just to get past your\n\n414\n00:20:56.382 --> 00:20:58.107\nlittle network access protection check.\n\n415\n00:20:58.107 --> 00:21:00.046\nAnd as soon as get in,\nI'm gonna turn it off.\n\n416\n00:21:00.046 --> 00:21:04.189\nNot gonna work,\ncuz it's gonna kick them right back out.\n\n417\n00:21:04.189 --> 00:21:08.926\nSo that's kind of the overall of of what\nwe do with with network access protection.\n\n418\n00:21:08.926 --> 00:21:10.725\nLet's take a look at at how it works here.\n\n419\n00:21:10.725 --> 00:21:14.488\nI'm gonna flip over to my, let's see\nif I can find the right machine and\n\n420\n00:21:14.488 --> 00:21:16.960\nthis guy is running my\nnetwork policy server.\n\n421\n00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.076\nSo in a Windows world, NPS or\n\n422\n00:21:19.076 --> 00:21:25.179\nNetwork Policy Server is what we install\nto work with Network Access Protection.\n\n423\n00:21:25.179 --> 00:21:28.127\nSo here I can expand on\nNetwork Access Protection and\n\n424\n00:21:28.127 --> 00:21:30.879\nthen I can expand out\nSystem Health Validators.\n\n425\n00:21:30.879 --> 00:21:35.218\nAnd underneath there, you'll see I\nhave one security health validator and\n\n426\n00:21:35.218 --> 00:21:37.879\nit is\nthe Windows Security Health Validator.\n\n427\n00:21:37.879 --> 00:21:40.803\nThis is the only one\nyou get out of the box.\n\n428\n00:21:40.803 --> 00:21:42.305\nI'll go down to Settings and\n\n429\n00:21:42.305 --> 00:21:45.190\nI'll double-click on this\nDefault Configuration.\n\n430\n00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:50.054\nAnd here,\nI can see the things that I can check for.\n\n431\n00:21:50.054 --> 00:21:50.901\nFirewall.\n\n432\n00:21:50.901 --> 00:21:54.615\nIs the firewall turned on for\nall network connections?\n\n433\n00:21:54.615 --> 00:21:56.995\nAre they running antivirus applications?\n\n434\n00:21:56.995 --> 00:21:58.260\nIs it up to date?\n\n435\n00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:01.117\nSo not only are they running it,\nbut is it current?\n\n436\n00:22:01.117 --> 00:22:03.694\nAnti-spyware, is it up to date?\n\n437\n00:22:03.694 --> 00:22:07.154\nAutomatic updates, is that turned on?\n\n438\n00:22:07.154 --> 00:22:09.116\nDown below here, Security Update Settings.\n\n439\n00:22:09.116 --> 00:22:12.517\nRestrict access for clients who do not\nhave all security options installed.\n\n440\n00:22:12.517 --> 00:22:15.535\nSo these are the kinds of\nthings that I can check for.\n\n441\n00:22:15.535 --> 00:22:17.718\nNow this is one system held value.\n\n442\n00:22:17.718 --> 00:22:22.580\nThere's really two parts to this, you've\ngot your health validator or your SHV,\n\n443\n00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:25.716\nknow these terms,\nMicrosoft loves these acronyms.\n\n444\n00:22:25.716 --> 00:22:27.887\nSHV, System Health Validator.\n\n445\n00:22:27.887 --> 00:22:34.354\nThis is where you create the rule when you\ndecide what is it that I wanna check for.\n\n446\n00:22:34.354 --> 00:22:35.735\nThere's a counterpart to that.\n\n447\n00:22:35.735 --> 00:22:39.872\nThat's gonna be the System Health Agent,\nthat's gonna run on the client and\n\n448\n00:22:39.872 --> 00:22:43.827\nit's gonna do the checks and report\nback to the System Health Validator.\n\n449\n00:22:43.827 --> 00:22:46.477\nSo you've got the SHA's\nthat run on the client,\n\n450\n00:22:46.477 --> 00:22:49.730\nyou've got the SHV's that\nare located on the server.\n\n451\n00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:52.660\nThey're the ones that are communicating\nwith each other when that machine attempts\n\n452\n00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:53.550\nto connect.\n\n453\n00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:56.253\nAnd its saying, hey, this is what I got,\nthese are my current settings.\n\n454\n00:22:56.253 --> 00:22:58.132\nThe agent reports that to the validator.\n\n455\n00:22:58.132 --> 00:22:59.898\nThe validator runs its little script.\n\n456\n00:22:59.898 --> 00:23:05.410\nCheck, check, check, not check,\noop and sends back a quarantine or\n\n457\n00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:11.495\na non compliant or if everything checks\nit sends back a compliant statement.\n\n458\n00:23:11.495 --> 00:23:14.792\nNow this one you can see is for Windows 7,\nWindows Vista, there's a different one.\n\n459\n00:23:14.792 --> 00:23:18.560\nFor Windows XP, a couple of\ndifferent things that I can check.\n\n460\n00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:21.010\nXP, remember,\ndidn't have that security center.\n\n461\n00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:22.853\nSo we don't have all of the same ones.\n\n462\n00:23:22.853 --> 00:23:26.255\nOther vendors can create these too.\n\n463\n00:23:26.255 --> 00:23:29.790\nLike you might go out to Symantec and\nfind a validator for them,\n\n464\n00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:32.259\nyou could download that and\nrun that here and\n\n465\n00:23:32.259 --> 00:23:36.076\nit might give you the ability to\ncheck different semantic options.\n\n466\n00:23:36.076 --> 00:23:37.862\nSo you can go out there and\n\n467\n00:23:37.862 --> 00:23:43.139\nget other validators from vendors that\nare specific for their product and\n\n468\n00:23:43.139 --> 00:23:48.161\nnow you can use these to verify\nconfigurations on those products, but\n\n469\n00:23:48.161 --> 00:23:53.292\nthat's the only one we get out of\nthe box for now is this one for Windows.\n\n470\n00:23:53.292 --> 00:23:56.913\nNow you notice on mine,\nI'm only checking for a firewall.\n\n471\n00:23:56.913 --> 00:23:58.713\nThat's because this is a lab environment.\n\n472\n00:23:58.713 --> 00:24:01.527\nI'm not running antivirus,\nI'm not running anything like that.\n\n473\n00:24:01.527 --> 00:24:03.474\nI'm not doing Windows updates and\n\n474\n00:24:03.474 --> 00:24:07.378\nI wanna show you the difference\nfrom compliance and noncompliance.\n\n475\n00:24:07.378 --> 00:24:10.905\nSo the only thing I'm checking for\nhere is the firewall.\n\n476\n00:24:10.905 --> 00:24:12.533\nAll right?\n\n477\n00:24:12.533 --> 00:24:19.279\nNow if we go over to my client,\nand I do a little IP config.\n\n478\n00:24:19.279 --> 00:24:23.479\nOops, if I could spell that.\n\n479\n00:24:23.479 --> 00:24:26.239\nLittle ipconfig /all.\n\n480\n00:24:26.239 --> 00:24:30.619\nWe'll see that I've got an IP address,\nall right, I've got my,\n\n481\n00:24:30.619 --> 00:24:34.390\nwhere are we at here,\nquarantine state not restricted.\n\n482\n00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:40.225\nIn fact, before I show you any more,\nlet's talk about the enforcement modes,\n\n483\n00:24:40.225 --> 00:24:44.269\nI guess would be a good place to go\nto next before I show you this one.\n\n484\n00:24:44.269 --> 00:24:48.180\nBecause remember I said you could\ndecide where you want to do the check.\n\n485\n00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:51.250\nReally, when do you want to do the check.\n\n486\n00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:52.530\nThere's a few different options.\n\n487\n00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:53.990\nOne is IPsec.\n\n488\n00:24:55.050 --> 00:25:00.310\nAnd what we'll do is any time a client\ntries to make an IPsec connection,\n\n489\n00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:03.360\nwe're gonna verify that it is compliant.\n\n490\n00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.795\nSo if it's not compliant,\n\n491\n00:25:04.795 --> 00:25:08.110\nit's not going to be allowed to\ncreate that IPsec connection.\n\n492\n00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:11.860\nYou might do this, we used IP sec within\nour corporate environments to set up\n\n493\n00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:15.050\nserver isolation and domain isolation.\n\n494\n00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:17.410\nWell we can use this in\nconjunction with that.\n\n495\n00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:19.890\nAnd if the client has said I've\ngot an IPsec policy that says,\n\n496\n00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:23.380\nin order to communicate with any of\nthese other machines on the network,\n\n497\n00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.420\nyou have to use IPsec.\n\n498\n00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:30.460\nAnd if I set the NAP to say you can't do\nIPsec unless you're compliant, well then,\n\n499\n00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:31.440\nif you're not compliant,\n\n500\n00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:35.640\nyou're not gonna be able to connect to\nany of the resources on my network.\n\n501\n00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.770\nRight, so you have to prove\nyour compliant to do IPsec and\n\n502\n00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:41.840\nthen you can use IPsec to connect to\nthe rest of the machines on the network.\n\n503\n00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:46.230\nYou can also do radius authentication.\n\n504\n00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.799\nOr you can do IPsec\nenforcement through radius.\n\n505\n00:25:48.799 --> 00:25:53.951\nRemember what radius is 802.1x,\nwhere that remote authentication\n\n506\n00:25:53.951 --> 00:25:57.939\ndial-in user service,\ncommonly used with VPN access,\n\n507\n00:25:57.939 --> 00:26:02.690\nas well as 802.1x enabled\naccess points and switches.\n\n508\n00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:04.750\nWell, I can throw another\nlevel of protection in here.\n\n509\n00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:08.490\nI can say, before you can connect\nto that wireless access point,\n\n510\n00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:12.800\nyes I'm using radius to move the\nauthentication into my internal network.\n\n511\n00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.700\nbut I'm also gonna run you\nthrough a health check.\n\n512\n00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:17.180\nAnd if you can't prove compliance,\n\n513\n00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.900\nthen I'm not gonna allow you to\nconnect to this wireless access point.\n\n514\n00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:24.270\nOr I'm not gonna allow you to connect\nto this 802.1x enabled switch.\n\n515\n00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:26.107\nWe can also enforce it with VPNs.\n\n516\n00:26:26.107 --> 00:26:31.140\nI mean, 802.1x, if we're using radius with\nour VPN connection, but even if we're not.\n\n517\n00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:34.640\nIf we're doing stand alone\nauthentication on that VPN server,\n\n518\n00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:38.780\nI can enforce SNAP every time you\ntry to make a VPN connection.\n\n519\n00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:41.470\nThis'll help me protect from those\ncomputers at home, all right?\n\n520\n00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:44.720\nThat computer that's out of my control,\nthat I don't have any idea what\n\n521\n00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:48.580\ntheir kids are doing on that machine,\nand when they attempt to connect\n\n522\n00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:51.120\nback to that work network,\nI'm gonna run and do a health check.\n\n523\n00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:54.030\nAnd if they're compliant, great,\nif they're not, I kick them out\n\n524\n00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:56.990\nto the remediation network, and they're\nnot allowed to make that VPN connection.\n\n525\n00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:00.810\nWe can also do DHCP enforcement.\n\n526\n00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:04.490\nBefore you can get an IP\naddress from my DHCP server,\n\n527\n00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:06.520\nyou need to prove your compliance.\n\n528\n00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.910\nIf you can, great,\nyou'll get an IP address.\n\n529\n00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:11.410\nIf you can't,\nthen you don't get an IP address, and\n\n530\n00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:13.360\nyou can't communicate with my network.\n\n531\n00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:16.790\nOr I can give you an IP\naddress that's only valid\n\n532\n00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:20.300\non that restricted network to\nallow you to do your remediation,\n\n533\n00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:23.420\nand then I could let you go\ninto the rest of the network.\n\n534\n00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:25.740\nSo four different places I can\nreally do the enforcement here.\n\n535\n00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:32.250\nWe got IPsec, we got VPN, we have\n802.1x for radius, and we have DHCP.\n\n536\n00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:35.220\nAll of which maintain compliance,\nare actively monitored.\n\n537\n00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:39.370\nIn other words, if I'm out of compliance,\n\n538\n00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:43.010\nif I ever become out of compliance,\nit's gonna detect that,\n\n539\n00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:46.390\nand it's gonna immediately kick me\nback out to that remediation network.\n\n540\n00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:50.240\nNow all of them are,\nwhat's a good way to say this.\n\n541\n00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.410\nThey're all equally strong.\n\n542\n00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:56.300\nI mean NAP is NAP is NAP, so once\nyou're restricted to the quarantine or\n\n543\n00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:59.780\nthe remediation network, you're stuck\nthere until you can prove your health.\n\n544\n00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:05.190\nBut we'll tell you there's a little bit of\na weakness to the DHCP enforcement option.\n\n545\n00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:09.250\nAnd it's not because NAP is insecure,\nbut think about this.\n\n546\n00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:14.200\nIf I tell you that before you\ncan get an IP address from DHTP,\n\n547\n00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:18.340\nI'm going to require you to\nprove your computer's healthy.\n\n548\n00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.180\nIf you don't want to do that,\nhow do you get around it?\n\n549\n00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:23.330\nStaticly map your IP address, right?\n\n550\n00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:25.200\nNow you're not talking to my DHTP server,\nand\n\n551\n00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.970\nyou don't care if you get\nan IP address from DHTP.\n\n552\n00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:29.380\nSo that's what I mean.\n\n553\n00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:34.400\nIt's not that NAP is any less\nefficient if you use DHCP enforcement,\n\n554\n00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.540\nI'm saying there's a way to get\naround the check in the first place.\n\n555\n00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.700\nWhereas if it's VPN,\nyou can't create VPN connection,\n\n556\n00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:41.730\nunless you can prove compliance.\n\n557\n00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:43.795\nThere's no way around it, right?\n\n558\n00:28:43.795 --> 00:28:46.360\nAnd we can also use combinations.\n\n559\n00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:48.230\nWe don't have to use just one.\n\n560\n00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:52.390\nWe can definitely use\nmore than one solution.\n\n561\n00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:53.209\nAll right, let's take a peek here.\n\n562\n00:28:53.209 --> 00:28:57.001\nSo again on my machine,\nhe's currently compliant, and\n\n563\n00:28:57.001 --> 00:28:59.849\nall I'm going to do is\nopen up my firewall.\n\n564\n00:29:03.809 --> 00:29:06.309\nAnd I'm gonna turn it off.\n\n565\n00:29:06.309 --> 00:29:09.889\nSo we'll just say turn off firewall and\nclick OK.\n\n566\n00:29:09.889 --> 00:29:14.489\nAnd notice almost immediately, I get a\nlittle pop-up down here in my system tray.\n\n567\n00:29:14.489 --> 00:29:16.909\nIf I click on that, oops,\nI just turned it back on, sorry.\n\n568\n00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:18.136\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let me turn that back off,\n\n569\n00:29:18.136 --> 00:29:18.787\nlet's turn it off.\n\n570\n00:29:18.787 --> 00:29:20.367\n>> [CROSSTALK] compliance for that.\n\n571\n00:29:20.367 --> 00:29:21.606\n[LAUGH]\n>> And click OK.\n\n572\n00:29:21.606 --> 00:29:22.386\n>> Rule follower.\n\n573\n00:29:22.386 --> 00:29:23.120\n>> And there we go.\n\n574\n00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.380\nThis is the one we one we want.\n\n575\n00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:27.830\nHere's the message, this is what\nthe users are going to get on their end.\n\n576\n00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:31.040\nComputer does not meet security standards\ndefined by your network administrator,\n\n577\n00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.220\nyou might have limited access.\n\n578\n00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:36.180\nAnd it even tells me,\nit should down here, let's see.\n\n579\n00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:42.425\nAn administrator must enable a firewall\nprogram that is compatible with\n\n580\n00:29:42.425 --> 00:29:44.039\nthe Windows Security Center.\n\n581\n00:29:44.039 --> 00:29:45.900\nAll right, and I think that's fantastic.\n\n582\n00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.480\nRather than the user\njust lost connectivity.\n\n583\n00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:51.530\nI can't connect to any resources,\nwhat the heck is going on?\n\n584\n00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:54.360\nRight, and then they call the help\ndesk and blah, blah, blah.\n\n585\n00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.306\nHey, this is telling them,\nyou need a firewall.\n\n586\n00:29:56.306 --> 00:30:00.491\nSo if your user's at home, and they\ncan't figure out why they can't connect,\n\n587\n00:30:00.491 --> 00:30:01.980\nthis is gonna tell them.\n\n588\n00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.270\nAnd notice it was almost immediate.\n\n589\n00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:05.970\nAnd if I go back over\nhere to my IP config now,\n\n590\n00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:12.380\nwe're gonna say quarantine\nstate restricted.\n\n591\n00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:16.470\nAnd notice that I've got an IP address,\nbut my subnet mask is all ones.\n\n592\n00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:19.300\nSo I want a network of one\nbasically all by myself.\n\n593\n00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:23.380\nNow I didn't setup a,\na remediation network for this demo, but\n\n594\n00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:24.220\nyou can see I'm restricted.\n\n595\n00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.150\nI'm not gonna get access to anything.\n\n596\n00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:31.469\nAnd you can see my DNS suffix\nis now restricted.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n597\n00:30:31.469 --> 00:30:35.943\nThese are things that I can use to control\nwhat they have access to when they\n\n598\n00:30:35.943 --> 00:30:37.829\nare quarantined, all right?\n\n599\n00:30:37.829 --> 00:30:41.189\nAnd now if I just go back over here and\nturn my firewall back on.\n\n600\n00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:47.749\nAll right, we're good to go there.\n\n601\n00:30:47.749 --> 00:30:49.208\nAnd now I do a little ipconfig.\n\n602\n00:30:49.208 --> 00:30:54.748\nOh, let's see, I might have to release and\nrenew to get that guy to pop back out.\n\n603\n00:30:54.748 --> 00:30:58.341\nIt'll happen automatically,\nbut if I do this,\n\n604\n00:30:58.341 --> 00:31:01.768\nit will speed the process\nup just a little bit.\n\n605\n00:31:05.648 --> 00:31:06.715\nWe'll let that renew.\n\n606\n00:31:06.715 --> 00:31:09.615\nAnd now I should get an IP address\nwith a valid subnet mask and\n\n607\n00:31:09.615 --> 00:31:11.595\nI should no longer be restricted.\n\n608\n00:31:12.805 --> 00:31:13.685\nAnd there we go.\n\n609\n00:31:13.685 --> 00:31:18.003\nI'm back to lab.itpro.tv instead\nof restricted.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n610\n00:31:18.003 --> 00:31:21.377\n>> You know what I like about this Mike is\nthat even though it gives them that nice\n\n611\n00:31:21.377 --> 00:31:24.751\nwarning message, this is exactly why\nyou're being put into remediation,\n\n612\n00:31:24.751 --> 00:31:27.089\nbecause you're not following\na proper procedure.\n\n613\n00:31:27.089 --> 00:31:29.589\nAnd even though that's gonna\ngenerate a help desk call.\n\n614\n00:31:29.589 --> 00:31:31.601\nI mean it'd be nice if there\nwere no help desk calls that go,\n\n615\n00:31:31.601 --> 00:31:33.029\noh well I've just done something wrong.\n\n616\n00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:36.420\nI'll have to fix this but\nthat's probably not gonna happen.\n\n617\n00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:37.600\nThey're gonna call a help desk and\n\n618\n00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:41.940\nsay, I'm getting this error message saying\nthat I'm out of compliance in some way.\n\n619\n00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:44.810\nIt says something about\na firewall being turned off.\n\n620\n00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:47.650\nThe help desk now knows exactly\nwhat the problem is, right?\n\n621\n00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:51.560\nIt points them right to the issue,\nwhereas if it didn't do that,\n\n622\n00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:55.020\nthey would call the help desk anyway and\nsay I don't know what's going on.\n\n623\n00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:56.650\nThere's something wrong with my computer.\n\n624\n00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:59.220\nAnd now we've gotta walk through\ntroubleshooting stuff trying to figure out\n\n625\n00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:01.450\nwhy they're not getting access and\nthen go, oh, lo and\n\n626\n00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:05.810\nbehold, you're not meeting the criteria\nthat we've set up for network access.\n\n627\n00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:06.830\nYou've gotta fix that.\n\n628\n00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:07.353\n>> Exactly.\nSo\n\n629\n00:32:07.353 --> 00:32:10.803\nit saves you a lot of time doing\nthat troubleshooting process.\n\n630\n00:32:10.803 --> 00:32:15.132\nAnd again, that auto remediation can be\nset up to where, like the firewall for\n\n631\n00:32:15.132 --> 00:32:19.066\nexample, like I said, I intentionally\nunchecked auto remediation so\n\n632\n00:32:19.066 --> 00:32:22.310\nthat I could show you\na restricted machine.\n\n633\n00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:25.610\nIf I didn't do that, it would have\njust turned the firewall back on and\n\n634\n00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:27.590\nthe user might not have ever even noticed.\n\n635\n00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:29.700\nAnd I would have said all right,\nI'm going to turn that on for you, and\n\n636\n00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:31.990\nnow you can have access to\nthe rest of the network.\n\n637\n00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:36.000\nIf I have WSUS set up for\nmy updates, and things like that,\n\n638\n00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.370\nI can automate that as well, right?\n\n639\n00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:40.510\nSo you get kicked over to\nthe remediation portion,\n\n640\n00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:43.860\nit automatically downloads updates for\nour corporate anti-virus software and for\n\n641\n00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:46.190\nWindows updates, and\nthen kicks them back out.\n\n642\n00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:49.860\nSo a lot of this can be\nautomated to fix that.\n\n643\n00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:51.640\nIt's a really handy thing.\n\n644\n00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.990\nLike I said, it really helps us protect.\n\n645\n00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:57.410\nIn today's world we got strange\ncomputers connecting to our network, and\n\n646\n00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:59.040\nwe've gotta make sure\nwe're keeping that safe.\n\n647\n00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:01.670\n>> That's right, very transient\nenvironment sending more, so\n\n648\n00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:04.260\nwe gotta take all\nthe necessary precautions and\n\n649\n00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:07.710\nactions that we can, like Mike said,\nto keep that network safe.\n\n650\n00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:08.550\nThanks so much for that, Mike,\n\n651\n00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:11.440\nis there anything else that we need\nto go over before we call it a day?\n\n652\n00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.400\n>> I think we're good to go.\n\n653\n00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.110\n>> All right.\n\n654\n00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:15.380\nWell everyone, we're gonna go ahead and\ncall it a day, then.\n\n655\n00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:18.167\nThanks for watching the show,\nwe're signing off for ITProTV,\n\n656\n00:33:18.167 --> 00:33:19.879\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n657\n00:33:19.879 --> 00:33:20.659\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n658\n00:33:20.659 --> 00:33:22.878\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n659\n00:33:22.878 --> 00:33:28.690\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.600\nI'm your host Daniel Lowry,\njoining me in the studio today, well,\n\n4\n00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.107\nit's none other than Mike Roderick.\n\n5\n00:00:21.107 --> 00:00:22.663\nWelcome to the show, Mike,\nhow are you doing today?\n\n6\n00:00:22.663 --> 00:00:24.103\n>> I'm doing great, Daniel.\n\n7\n00:00:24.103 --> 00:00:26.838\nWe've got more of our MTA\ncontent coming your way, and\n\n8\n00:00:26.838 --> 00:00:28.398\nyou know what that does for me?\n\n9\n00:00:28.398 --> 00:00:31.560\nIt gets me all excited and\nbubbly cuz we get to talk about security.\n\n10\n00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.360\nThis one, we're talking about network\nisolation which is one of those things.\n\n11\n00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.050\nWait, I don't want my\nnetwork to be isolated.\n\n12\n00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.252\nI wanna connect to other networks.\n\n13\n00:00:39.252 --> 00:00:42.530\nI wanna get access to resources\nall over the place, and we do, but\n\n14\n00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.812\nwe wanna protect our network.\n\n15\n00:00:43.812 --> 00:00:45.230\nWe've gotta keep it safe.\n\n16\n00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.860\nAnd when we talk about network isolation,\nwe're really kinda talking about making\n\n17\n00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.120\nsure that only the right people can get\nonto our network, isolating it from all of\n\n18\n00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.740\nthe other baddies out there, things\nthat shouldn't exist on our network.\n\n19\n00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.500\n>> That's right.\nIt just makes sense\n\n20\n00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.980\nthat even though you\nhave one large network,\n\n21\n00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.970\nthere's no reason that the HR department\ndives into the research department.\n\n22\n00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.260\nWhat's the point of crossing\nthat traffic together?\n\n23\n00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.630\nIt doesn't make any sense, so\nsometimes we wanna isolate that.\n\n24\n00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.520\nObviously, for security reasons we also\nwanna isolate certain things like,\n\n25\n00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.815\nI don't know, maybe our servers and\nthe data that's on them.\n\n26\n00:01:17.815 --> 00:01:19.410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That might be a good idea to\n\n27\n00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.280\nisolate that network as well.\n\n28\n00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.010\nSo we're gonna show you a few tricks and\ntips to be able to do that, some common\n\n29\n00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.528\nways in which we employ network\nisolation for those specific purposes.\n\n30\n00:01:28.528 --> 00:01:31.460\nAnd Mike, you got a lot of cool\nstuff lined up for us today.\n\n31\n00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.490\nSo where do we begin, good Sir?\n\n32\n00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.790\n>> I think we'll start with virtual LANs.\n\n33\n00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.870\nAnd before we can talk about virtual LANs,\nwe need to do a little refresher and\n\n34\n00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.980\njust make sure we're\nfamiliar with the LAN.\n\n35\n00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.710\nA LAN is a local area network,\ntypically isolated to a building or\n\n36\n00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.930\neven a floor of a multi-storey building,\nor\n\n37\n00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.370\nit could be a group of buildings,\nbut a local area network.\n\n38\n00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.950\nIt usually implies physically\nthings that are tied together,\n\n39\n00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.520\nall connected to the same little network.\n\n40\n00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.840\nWe have a soho, for example,\nwe might have a single LAN environment.\n\n41\n00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.690\nWe've only got four or five computers.\n\n42\n00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.220\nAs we move up in size to our larger and\n\n43\n00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.350\nlarger networks, that LAN starts\ngrowing and growing and growing.\n\n44\n00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.730\nAnd remember how Ethernet works,\nit's a contention-based protocol.\n\n45\n00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.490\nIn other words, you gotta fight for\ntime on the network.\n\n46\n00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.000\nSo if I have ten nodes on\na little local area network,\n\n47\n00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.360\na little subnet,\nthen they're all competing for time.\n\n48\n00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.859\nBut with only ten other people,\nimagine being in a room with ten people.\n\n49\n00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:32.426\nIt's pretty easy to talk, right?\n\n50\n00:02:32.426 --> 00:02:36.320\nIf you've got something to say, you just\nspeak up and everybody hears you talking.\n\n51\n00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.150\nThey all hush and you continue to speak.\n\n52\n00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.575\nBut now increase the number of people\nin that room to 20, 50, a hundred,\n\n53\n00:02:44.575 --> 00:02:49.585\n200, now how easy is it to get\neverybody's attention and say hey,\n\n54\n00:02:49.585 --> 00:02:52.570\nI've got something to say, and\ntry to speak so everybody can hear you.\n\n55\n00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.260\nOr at least the person you're trying\nto talk can hear you, cuz you got 100,\n\n56\n00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.730\n50 different conversations going on.\n\n57\n00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.500\nIt becomes very difficult.\n\n58\n00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.534\nIt's the same thing that's\nhappening with our computers.\n\n59\n00:03:02.534 --> 00:03:06.259\nIf I've got five or ten nodes on there,\nnot that big of a deal.\n\n60\n00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:10.297\nIf I get up to a hundred, 200 nodes,\nthere's a lot of nodes fighting for\n\n61\n00:03:10.297 --> 00:03:14.589\ntime on the network that they need to\nspeak, they need to connect to a resource,\n\n62\n00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:16.150\nand think about broadcast.\n\n63\n00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.715\nThere's a lot of broadcast\ntraffic that goes on.\n\n64\n00:03:18.715 --> 00:03:21.894\nIf you've ever run a packet capture\nutility on your home network,\n\n65\n00:03:21.894 --> 00:03:23.610\nwhere you're not doing anything.\n\n66\n00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.120\nYou're not connected to the Internet.\n\n67\n00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.250\nYou're just sitting there\nwatching Wireshark.\n\n68\n00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.140\nAnd yet packets are just scrolling and\nscrolling by, right?\n\n69\n00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.283\nThere's broadcast going.\n\n70\n00:03:31.283 --> 00:03:32.781\nThere's ARP resolution requests.\n\n71\n00:03:32.781 --> 00:03:35.030\nThere's DNS resolution requests.\n\n72\n00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.637\nAll kinds of things are happening.\n\n73\n00:03:36.637 --> 00:03:39.689\nTwo or three or five, ten nodes,\nnot that big of deal.\n\n74\n00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:43.868\n200 nodes all doing those broadcasts\nat the same time on the same LAN,\n\n75\n00:03:43.868 --> 00:03:46.830\neverybody gets to hear it,\nit becomes very noisy.\n\n76\n00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.480\nWe saturate our network, our local area\nnetwork, with this broadcast traffic.\n\n77\n00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.650\nSo what do we do?\n\n78\n00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.760\nWell, we divide it up.\n\n79\n00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.570\nWe break that LAN up into\nsmaller little chunks, right?\n\n80\n00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.710\nWe take that room of 200 people and\nsay hey,\n\n81\n00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.730\nyou 20 people that are dealing with this,\ngo over here in this room, right?\n\n82\n00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.880\nYou guys, go over to this room.\n\n83\n00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.970\nSame thing we can do with\nour local area networks.\n\n84\n00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.840\nWe can divide them up\ninto smaller chunks so\n\n85\n00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.310\nthat you're only competing with the fewer\nnumber of nodes instead of everybody.\n\n86\n00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.430\nLike what Daniel said in\nthe beginning was a great example.\n\n87\n00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.770\nYou got your sales department, let's make\nthem their own little subnet, right?\n\n88\n00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.330\nLet's take that RND and\nmake it a different subnet.\n\n89\n00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.810\nSo it helps reduce that\nbroadcast traffic and,\n\n90\n00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.570\nas Daniel said,\nit's a security thing, right?\n\n91\n00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.270\nBecause now, if I've got two different\nsubnets there, I can control access.\n\n92\n00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.590\nI can say no, this computer's\nwith this range of IP addresses,\n\n93\n00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.850\nit's not allowed to go\nover to this subnet.\n\n94\n00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:44.630\nThere's no need for\n\n95\n00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.180\nthem to connect them to those file servers\nover there on the RND network, all right?\n\n96\n00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.740\nSo, that's the issue we have with LANs and\nhow we deal with it, we break it up.\n\n97\n00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.710\nHow do we do that?\n\n98\n00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.260\nHow do we break it up into\nthose smaller chunks?\n\n99\n00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.410\nWell, we can use routers, right?\n\n100\n00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.040\nRouters route between networks.\n\n101\n00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.010\nSo I can create multiple subnets\non my local area network\n\n102\n00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.200\nI put routers in between them, and\n\n103\n00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.720\nnow they can control the traffic that's\nflowing between those different subnets.\n\n104\n00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.610\nIf I wanna allow access, I can.\n\n105\n00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.790\nLike Daniel said,\nhave a subnet just for your servers and\n\n106\n00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.160\nall your data, another subnet for\nthe sales department,\n\n107\n00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.470\nanother subnet for RND or HR or\naccounting or what have you.\n\n108\n00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.410\nWe can divide it all up.\n\n109\n00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.460\nBut when we do it that way,\nwe've got routers to deal with now.\n\n110\n00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.140\nSo we have to start plopping routers down\nin between all these different subnets.\n\n111\n00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.630\nAnd routers can generate a little bit\nof an issue as well when it comes to\n\n112\n00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:43.910\nmanagement, right?\n\n113\n00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.080\nI've gotta have somebody familiar\nwith setting up a router,\n\n114\n00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.030\nsetting up those access control list and\ncontrolling that traffic.\n\n115\n00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.800\nRouters have routing tables that\nthey keep track of so they know\n\n116\n00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.950\nwhere the different networks are, so\nthey can route the packets accordingly.\n\n117\n00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.010\nWell, they have to share that information,\nso\n\n118\n00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:07.490\nwe have routing protocols now on our\nnetwork that's taking up bandwidth.\n\n119\n00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.900\nAnd depending on what routing protocol\nyou're using, like some of those internal\n\n120\n00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.402\nprotocols, they periodically just\nbroadcast out their routing tables.\n\n121\n00:06:14.402 --> 00:06:16.670\nSo we end up generating more traffic.\n\n122\n00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.680\nWe're putting overhead on there,\n\n123\n00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:24.110\nwhen we're trying to simplify them and\nease that administration.\n\n124\n00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.815\nAnd if you start moving computers between\nsubnets with routers, that might involve\n\n125\n00:06:28.815 --> 00:06:33.586\nupdating routing tables, updating rules,\naccess control lists on those routers,\n\n126\n00:06:33.586 --> 00:06:37.387\nto make sure that they still have\naccess to the resources they need.\n\n127\n00:06:37.387 --> 00:06:39.048\nAnd that's where VLANs come in.\n\n128\n00:06:39.048 --> 00:06:41.540\nVLAN is a virtual LAN.\n\n129\n00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:47.550\nWe can take our LAN,\ndivide it up virtually, right?\n\n130\n00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.753\nWe do this with what we call VLAN\nswitches or Layer 3 switches.\n\n131\n00:06:51.753 --> 00:06:55.757\nAnd what happens is we assign VLAN ID.\n\n132\n00:06:55.757 --> 00:06:59.347\nWell there's a couple of different ways we\ncan do it, but we take all those machines\n\n133\n00:06:59.347 --> 00:07:02.397\nthat are in sales, and we give them,\nlet's say we put them on VLAN 1.\n\n134\n00:07:02.397 --> 00:07:06.009\nAnd then we take all those guys on RND and\nput them on VLAN 2.\n\n135\n00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:09.676\nAnd then all my data center,\nall that stuff's on VLAN 3.\n\n136\n00:07:09.676 --> 00:07:13.333\nWell now I can segregate that\ntraffic out and I can control.\n\n137\n00:07:13.333 --> 00:07:16.374\nAll the guys in VLAN 1,\nthey can talk to each other no problem.\n\n138\n00:07:16.374 --> 00:07:20.860\nVLAN 1 can talk to VLAN 2,\nif I allow it, right?\n\n139\n00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.530\nBut I can control that now.\n\n140\n00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.796\nAnd if there's a broadcast\ngoing on on VLAN 2,\n\n141\n00:07:25.796 --> 00:07:29.646\nonly the nodes on VLAN 2\nare gonna hear that broadcast.\n\n142\n00:07:29.646 --> 00:07:34.155\nSo we're kinda making these\nsmaller broadcast domains,\n\n143\n00:07:34.155 --> 00:07:36.739\ntaking our LAN, dividing it up.\n\n144\n00:07:36.739 --> 00:07:39.100\nAnd we're doing it with a switch.\n\n145\n00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.400\nSo there's no routing protocol.\n\n146\n00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.070\nThere's no extra overhead.\n\n147\n00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.347\nThere's no latency involved.\n\n148\n00:07:43.347 --> 00:07:47.899\nThat switch doesn't have to worry about\nrouting tables and things like that.\n\n149\n00:07:47.899 --> 00:07:51.540\nSo he's doing routing sort of, right?\n\n150\n00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.140\nBut he's not doing it\nbased on the IP address.\n\n151\n00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.060\nHe's doing it on this VLAN ID.\n\n152\n00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.069\nSo, it's still occurring At layer two.\n\n153\n00:07:59.069 --> 00:08:02.474\nNow you can look at layer three because we\ncan make some decisions based on the IP\n\n154\n00:08:02.474 --> 00:08:05.160\naddress but\njust understand he's not routing.\n\n155\n00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.250\nAll right, it's not a router.\n\n156\n00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.890\nIt's still a switch that can\nread information at layer three\n\n157\n00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:11.740\nwhere that IP address resides.\n\n158\n00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.990\nSo now, that's where you get that\nterm VLAN switch or Layer 3 switch.\n\n159\n00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.520\nCuz normally switches\nare down at layer two.\n\n160\n00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.400\nThey don't have access to that IP\naddressing information in those packets.\n\n161\n00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.570\nA VLAN switch or a Layer 3 switch would.\n\n162\n00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:29.360\nAnd they used to be a lot more expensive,\nbut they've come down in price.\n\n163\n00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.760\nBecause it's a very common\ntechnology nowadays.\n\n164\n00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:37.310\nSo it's very affordable,\nin reach of even the smallest networks.\n\n165\n00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:38.000\nAll right.\n\n166\n00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.910\nNow, how do we decide,\nhow do we define these VLANs?\n\n167\n00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:44.250\nReally there's four\nmajor ways we can do it.\n\n168\n00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.340\nThere's port number.\n\n169\n00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:50.290\nAnd when I say port, I'm not talking\nabout the protocol ports like Port 80 for\n\n170\n00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:51.330\nweb or anything like that.\n\n171\n00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.290\nI'm talking about ports on the switch.\n\n172\n00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:55.580\nProbably one of the more\ncommon ways of doing this.\n\n173\n00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.460\nYou get that 48 port switch,\nand I can say, all right,\n\n174\n00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.840\nthe first 12 ports on here, that's VLAN1.\n\n175\n00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:06.670\nThe next 24 ports, that's VLAN2,\nthe last 12, that's VLAN3.\n\n176\n00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:12.550\nAnd then simply by patching that system\ndown to that port on that switch,\n\n177\n00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.980\nthat's controlling what\nVLAN they're a part of.\n\n178\n00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:20.560\nNow, the downside of the port,\nusing the port system like that.\n\n179\n00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.820\nI mean it's convenient, and if I need to\nchange somebody from one VLAN to another\n\n180\n00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.820\nI simply go into the closet and\nmove their patch cable, right?\n\n181\n00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:32.590\nMove them from a port that's on\nVLAN1 to a port that's on VLAN2.\n\n182\n00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:35.720\nThat does require a little\na bit of administration, right?\n\n183\n00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.770\nI've got to get up and\ngo to that server closet.\n\n184\n00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.860\nAnd make that adjustment.\n\n185\n00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.490\nIf computers move,\nthis can also be a real pain, right,\n\n186\n00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:46.340\nbecause I'm saying that\nthis port is part of VLAN1.\n\n187\n00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:50.980\nSo that a guy in the sales department,\nall those ports in the wall map back to\n\n188\n00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:54.510\nports on my switch,\nthat's VLAN1 for sales.\n\n189\n00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:56.730\nBut what if they move those cubicles\nto the other side of the building?\n\n190\n00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.740\nThey say, hey, you know what,\nsales is now gonna go over here.\n\n191\n00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:03.240\nWell those ports over there are not\nmapped down to VLAN1, right?\n\n192\n00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.830\nSo now I've got to go back in and\nremap all that stuff and\n\n193\n00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:09.540\nI can typically do this through\na management interface on the switch.\n\n194\n00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.670\nLike say all right those ports all map\nback to ports 37 through 48 on that\n\n195\n00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.090\nswitch.\n\n196\n00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:18.700\nSo I'm just gonna go in there and\nconfigure that now to be VLAN1..\n\n197\n00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.650\nBut it is a little more\nadministrative overhead if\n\n198\n00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:22.970\nyou have a dynamic environment.\n\n199\n00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:27.230\nIf things are moving around all the time,\nlike we do here.\n\n200\n00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:29.830\nYou've gotta love it when they so, okay,\nthis is where we're gonna put the host,\n\n201\n00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:33.240\nthis is where we're gonna put the dev\nteam, and it's gonna be like that.\n\n202\n00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.005\nUntil next week.\n\n203\n00:10:34.005 --> 00:10:35.760\n[LAUGH].\n>> And then it's just like,\n\n204\n00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.550\nwe're gonna change this up a little bit.\n\n205\n00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:41.980\nSo something like doing it based on ports,\nfor our environment being so\n\n206\n00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.790\ndynamic, might not be as efficient.\n\n207\n00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.080\nSo what I can do,\nI can do MAC addresses, right?\n\n208\n00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.090\nBut you know what a MAC address is,\nand media access control.\n\n209\n00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:53.950\nI can say this MAC\naddress is part of VLAN1.\n\n210\n00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:56.760\nThis MAC address is part of VLAN2.\n\n211\n00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.970\nSo now it's not tied to\nthe ports on the switch.\n\n212\n00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:01.800\nAnd if I take that sales\nmachine that's part of VLAN1,\n\n213\n00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.620\nmove it to the other side of the building\nand plug it in, it's still part of VLAN1.\n\n214\n00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.740\nBecause it's still got\nthe same network adapter,\n\n215\n00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.460\nstill got the same MAC\naddress,nothing has changed.\n\n216\n00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:14.070\nSo, administratively a little more\ndifficult to set up initially because I've\n\n217\n00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:18.190\ngot to go out and get the MAC address from\nall those devices and set it up, that way.\n\n218\n00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:19.990\nBut once I've got that set up,\nI'm good to go.\n\n219\n00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:24.840\nUntil I start bringing in new computers,\nwe don't have any administration to do, so\n\n220\n00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.700\ngood to go there.\n\n221\n00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.100\nSo a little bit easier that way.\n\n222\n00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.630\nAgain, dynamic environments.\n\n223\n00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.100\nThat's really where you're\ngoing to see that used most,\n\n224\n00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.670\nbecause now computers can move around,\n\n225\n00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:37.118\nand they can remain attached to the VLAN\nthat they were supposed to be on.\n\n226\n00:11:37.118 --> 00:11:40.150\nOther ways we can set up VLAN membership,\nIP sub-nets, of course.\n\n227\n00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:42.430\nWe're familiar with\nsub-nets at this point.\n\n228\n00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:49.520\nSo I can base it on a 192.168.1.0\nis VLAN ID1 .2.0 is VLAN ID2.\n\n229\n00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:54.150\nYou gotta remember these\nlayer three switches,\n\n230\n00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.190\nthey do have a little bit\nof routing capabilities.\n\n231\n00:11:56.190 --> 00:12:00.550\nI mean, they can read that\ninformation out of that packet so\n\n232\n00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:02.030\nthey can see that IP address.\n\n233\n00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:06.100\nThey understand what a sub-net is and\na sub-net mask is.\n\n234\n00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.770\nWe can also base it on protocol.\n\n235\n00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:11.630\nAlthough this is one that you\nrarely see implemented, but\n\n236\n00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:15.780\nyou could say this particular\nprotocol is associated with a VLAN.\n\n237\n00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.690\nTo segregate out traffic like that.\n\n238\n00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:21.410\nYou might see this where you have\na particular file server that is\n\n239\n00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:24.410\nmaybe running, I don't know,\nNFS or some other protocol.\n\n240\n00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:27.000\nYou want to eliminate all of that traffic,\nyou want to\n\n241\n00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.280\nisolate it from everything else, you can\nset up a VLAN based on that protocol.\n\n242\n00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:36.360\nAlright, so there's your VLANs,\nagain, Virtual Local Area Networks.\n\n243\n00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.960\nReally do, you're going to see that\non just about every network nowadays.\n\n244\n00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.810\nThere are some security issues\nwith that though, keep in mind,\n\n245\n00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:46.550\nI mean I said it's good for security\nbecause it does isolate traffic, but\n\n246\n00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:50.250\nthere's also some techniques bad\nguys can try to use VLAN hopping\n\n247\n00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:54.250\nwhere they can try to jump from one VLAN\nto another, even though it's not allowed.\n\n248\n00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:57.520\nAnd so\nit's not a bulletproof security thing.\n\n249\n00:12:58.892 --> 00:13:01.220\nAll right next thing Daniel we're\ngoing to talk about is routing, and\n\n250\n00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:04.930\nI know in some other episodes we've\ntaken a look at routing already and\n\n251\n00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:06.530\nwhat it means to route.\n\n252\n00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:08.210\nHere I really just wanna\nkind of compare and\n\n253\n00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:12.460\ncontrast software based routers\nversus hardware based routers.\n\n254\n00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.370\nTalk about where I might see those\nguys and what the advantages and\n\n255\n00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:17.030\ndisadvantages are.\n\n256\n00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:18.920\nLet's start with software based routers.\n\n257\n00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.380\nSoftware based routers\nare obviously an application,\n\n258\n00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.880\nsomething I would install on a machine.\n\n259\n00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.123\nNow this could be a client machine,\nwe can go down and\n\n260\n00:13:28.123 --> 00:13:33.010\nwe can download some little routing\napplication that would allow us to route.\n\n261\n00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:36.946\n>> Some Windows operating systems\nthemselves have routing abilities built\n\n262\n00:13:36.946 --> 00:13:37.650\nin, right?\n\n263\n00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:41.532\n>> Yes, absolutely, and I know\nWindows server 2008 R2, I can install,\n\n264\n00:13:41.532 --> 00:13:43.250\nI can multi-home that machine.\n\n265\n00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:46.040\nI can install more than one\nnetwork adapter in there, and\n\n266\n00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:52.290\nI can install routing remote access, and I\ncan set it up as a software based router.\n\n267\n00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:55.250\nAdvantage of that,\nI've already got the hardware.\n\n268\n00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:57.440\nI might have to buy some\nmore network adapters.\n\n269\n00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.260\nBut, it's all common interface.\n\n270\n00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.470\nIt's something that I'm used to\nworking with, Server 2008 R2.\n\n271\n00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:05.650\nIt's integrated tightly with\nthe operating system and\n\n272\n00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:10.750\nthe applications that are running there,\nso that can be advantageous as well.\n\n273\n00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.080\nTypically lower cost,\n\n274\n00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.890\nit's not costing me anything other\nthan some additional network adapters.\n\n275\n00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:19.010\nAlready got the license for my server\noperating system, so I'm good to go there.\n\n276\n00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.530\nProblem is going to be, or down sides\nof software based, scalability, right.\n\n277\n00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.800\nDifficult to scale it up.\n\n278\n00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.070\nYou start running into issues where\nyou know it's still a computer\n\n279\n00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:30.880\nit's still a server.\n\n280\n00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:31.990\nIt's got its operating system.\n\n281\n00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:36.380\nIt's got other applications that might be\nworking on there, so performance wise and\n\n282\n00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:40.720\nscalability becomes an issue\ntrying to set up multiple.\n\n283\n00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:45.550\nAnd tying more than one\nR2 box that's running,\n\n284\n00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.780\nrouting and remote access,\nnot nearly as scalable.\n\n285\n00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:52.970\nAnd as I said the reliability\nbecomes an issue because now\n\n286\n00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:57.340\nan operating system crash affects my\nrouting, an application that hangs and\n\n287\n00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:00.420\nsucks up all the resources on\nthat server affects my routing.\n\n288\n00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.080\nAnd like I said, scalability-wise.\n\n289\n00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.180\nI can put one or two or\nthree network adapters in there.\n\n290\n00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:11.190\nYou start going large number of network\nadapters and doing routing between many,\n\n291\n00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:12.780\nmany different networks, and\n\n292\n00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:15.910\nthat machine is just,\nit's not a dedicated device, right?\n\n293\n00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:17.940\nIt's got other things that it has to do.\n\n294\n00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:21.100\nIt can't send all of its\nresources to routing.\n\n295\n00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.930\nSo as we try to grow and grow with it,\nit's gonna become an issue.\n\n296\n00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:29.590\nWhereas a hardware based router\ndoesn't have those limitations, right?\n\n297\n00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:31.920\nThat's all it does,\nit's designed to route.\n\n298\n00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:37.920\nEverything that it does is designed to be\na efficient, scalable routing solution.\n\n299\n00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:41.220\nSo much better performance that\nwe're going to get out of there,\n\n300\n00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:45.490\nmuch better scalability that we're gonna\nget out of hardware based solutions.\n\n301\n00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:48.430\nBut then again we've got\nthe issue of cost, right?\n\n302\n00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:52.202\nNow all of sudden I've got to\nbuy these routing devices.\n\n303\n00:15:52.202 --> 00:15:55.221\nThat's in addition to my servers and\neverything else that I have.\n\n304\n00:15:55.221 --> 00:16:00.291\nFor management-wise, I might be\ngreat at managing a 2008 R2 machine,\n\n305\n00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:02.402\ndon't know my Cisco commands.\n\n306\n00:16:02.402 --> 00:16:02.972\nSo now,\n\n307\n00:16:02.972 --> 00:16:07.951\nI've got another level of complexity\nwhen it comes to Administration.\n\n308\n00:16:07.951 --> 00:16:11.318\nSo really, it depends on what you're\ntrying to do with these guys.\n\n309\n00:16:11.318 --> 00:16:15.123\nIf you need a simple firewall to sit\nbetween your corporate network and\n\n310\n00:16:15.123 --> 00:16:17.251\nR&D, cuz you wanna isolate them out,\n\n311\n00:16:17.251 --> 00:16:20.362\na software router is probably\na great solution for that.\n\n312\n00:16:20.362 --> 00:16:22.603\nNot a lot of traffic going through there,\nanyway.\n\n313\n00:16:22.603 --> 00:16:27.656\nIt's just one LAN or one little subnet\nthat you're trying to segregate out,\n\n314\n00:16:27.656 --> 00:16:31.930\nsoftware router might be ideal for\nthat, but setting up our DMZ or\n\n315\n00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:37.160\nour firewall out to the internet where I\nknow I'm going to have a lot of traffic.\n\n316\n00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:41.050\nI mean, every user on my network,all my\nservers, all that traffic's going through\n\n317\n00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:43.656\nthere, a hardware based firewall\nmight be the way to go.\n\n318\n00:16:43.656 --> 00:16:46.528\n>> Yeah, they're definitely\nthe cat's pajamas as they say,\n\n319\n00:16:46.528 --> 00:16:48.114\nbecause that is their function.\n\n320\n00:16:48.114 --> 00:16:49.832\nAnd that is what they do,\nthat's what they're designed to do.\n\n321\n00:16:49.832 --> 00:16:55.880\nThe processors and the hardware that is\nin it is so super fast at this stuff,\n\n322\n00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:01.836\nit will smoke any server that you build\nup to try to take care of this issue.\n\n323\n00:17:01.836 --> 00:17:05.620\nIt is always the better way to go is\nto jump in with a hardware firewall.\n\n324\n00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:08.232\nNow, a couple of other things when you're\ntalking about firewalls, right, Mike?\n\n325\n00:17:08.232 --> 00:17:11.543\nAnd that's kinda their routing protocols,\nisn't that right?\n\n326\n00:17:11.543 --> 00:17:13.505\n>> Yeah,\nthink of a protocol again as a language.\n\n327\n00:17:13.505 --> 00:17:16.709\nRouters have to share their\ninformation with other routers.\n\n328\n00:17:16.709 --> 00:17:20.784\nA router automatically knows about\nthe network that it's connected to, so\n\n329\n00:17:20.784 --> 00:17:23.663\nyou get three different sub\nnets tied in that router.\n\n330\n00:17:23.663 --> 00:17:25.288\nHe knows about all three of those.\n\n331\n00:17:25.288 --> 00:17:27.976\nAnd if a packet comes from one and\nneeds to go to the other,\n\n332\n00:17:27.976 --> 00:17:29.548\nhe can route it right over there.\n\n333\n00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:33.751\nBut what if I got a second router that's\nconnected to three other networks?\n\n334\n00:17:33.751 --> 00:17:37.514\nWell, that first router doesn't know\nanything about those other three and\n\n335\n00:17:37.514 --> 00:17:40.821\nthat second router doesn't know\nanything about the first three.\n\n336\n00:17:40.821 --> 00:17:43.004\nSo routers share their information.\n\n337\n00:17:43.004 --> 00:17:47.281\nHey, buddy, if you ever need to get\nanything to subnet one two or three,\n\n338\n00:17:47.281 --> 00:17:49.540\nsend it over to me, I can get it there.\n\n339\n00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.501\nHe says, oh, great thanks for the info.\n\n340\n00:17:51.501 --> 00:17:55.846\nBy the way, if you ever need to get\nanything to subnet four, five or six,\n\n341\n00:17:55.846 --> 00:17:57.004\nsend it over to me.\n\n342\n00:17:57.004 --> 00:17:58.959\nI know where they're at,\nI can get them there.\n\n343\n00:17:58.959 --> 00:18:00.502\nThat's what routing protocols do.\n\n344\n00:18:00.502 --> 00:18:04.696\nThey allow me to share that routing\ninformation between these routers, so\n\n345\n00:18:04.696 --> 00:18:09.169\nwe can start routing packets beyond what\nthat router is connected to directly.\n\n346\n00:18:09.169 --> 00:18:12.679\n>> Yeah, otherwise,\nwe'd have to be setting up static routes,\n\n347\n00:18:12.679 --> 00:18:14.346\nwhich would be not fun at all.\n\n348\n00:18:14.346 --> 00:18:17.949\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You would have to know where every\n\n349\n00:18:17.949 --> 00:18:21.837\nroute goes or at least,\nhow to get to someone that does and\n\n350\n00:18:21.837 --> 00:18:23.784\nthat would be not feasible.\n\n351\n00:18:23.784 --> 00:18:24.806\n>> No, definitely not.\n\n352\n00:18:24.806 --> 00:18:26.580\nSo routing protocols are a good thing,\n\n353\n00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.962\nwe have a choice when it\ncomes to routing protocols.\n\n354\n00:18:28.962 --> 00:18:34.184\nThe two classes they call out here,\nwe're gonna keep it pretty simple is\n\n355\n00:18:34.184 --> 00:18:41.090\na link state or I should say, yeah, a link\nstate and then there's distance vector.\n\n356\n00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:45.386\nLink state is based on a hop count and\nthere's a problem with it.\n\n357\n00:18:45.386 --> 00:18:47.672\nIt's limited to 15 hops.\n\n358\n00:18:47.672 --> 00:18:53.718\nSo internally, link state usually works\npretty good if it's a small environment.\n\n359\n00:18:53.718 --> 00:18:56.702\n15 hops meaning that every router\nI go through is another hop.\n\n360\n00:18:56.702 --> 00:18:59.426\nSo if I'm on a network and\nto get to that other network,\n\n361\n00:18:59.426 --> 00:19:01.218\nI have to go through three routers.\n\n362\n00:19:01.218 --> 00:19:06.360\nWell, that's one, two, three hops and\nI make it, but think about the internet.\n\n363\n00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.997\nYou're gonna go through a lot of routers.\n\n364\n00:19:07.997 --> 00:19:10.585\nAlmost most likely more\nthan 15 routers to get\n\n365\n00:19:10.585 --> 00:19:13.244\nto just about any\ndestination you're going to.\n\n366\n00:19:13.244 --> 00:19:14.719\nIt's gonna run out.\n\n367\n00:19:14.719 --> 00:19:16.820\nIt has no more hops, the packet dies.\n\n368\n00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.718\nBasically, it has a little\ncounter inside the packet,\n\n369\n00:19:19.718 --> 00:19:23.807\nand every time it goes through the router,\nit decrements that counter by one.\n\n370\n00:19:23.807 --> 00:19:25.967\nIt gets to zero, the packet gets dropped.\n\n371\n00:19:25.967 --> 00:19:27.880\nThey can't do anything else with it.\n\n372\n00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.723\nSo it's not gonna work in large,\nlarge routed environments or\n\n373\n00:19:30.723 --> 00:19:31.967\nthings like the Internet.\n\n374\n00:19:31.967 --> 00:19:36.601\nThis is where our distance vector\nprotocols like open shortest pass\n\n375\n00:19:36.601 --> 00:19:38.723\nfirst is gonna come into play.\n\n376\n00:19:38.723 --> 00:19:41.068\nThese guys are much more scalable.\n\n377\n00:19:41.068 --> 00:19:44.586\nThe way they share their routing\ninformation is more efficient, as well.\n\n378\n00:19:44.586 --> 00:19:47.400\nThose first ones we talked about,\nthe link state,\n\n379\n00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.681\nthey periodically broadcast\ntheir entire routing table.\n\n380\n00:19:50.681 --> 00:19:51.956\nAll the stuff that they know about,\n\n381\n00:19:51.956 --> 00:19:53.966\nall the stuff that they've\nlearned from anybody else.\n\n382\n00:19:53.966 --> 00:19:56.856\nThey broadcast it back\nout to other routers, so\n\n383\n00:19:56.856 --> 00:20:00.989\nyou have this constant broadcast\nof these routing tables going on.\n\n384\n00:20:00.989 --> 00:20:06.277\nWhereas with my distance vector, like open\nshortest path first, these only always\n\n385\n00:20:06.277 --> 00:20:11.571\nsend out their changes to their neighbors\nand they only do it when there's a change.\n\n386\n00:20:11.571 --> 00:20:14.323\nNothing's changed, there's no\nreason to share their information.\n\n387\n00:20:14.323 --> 00:20:16.982\nSo, a lot more efficient in that respect.\n\n388\n00:20:16.982 --> 00:20:20.374\nSo we got our routers,\nyou gotta know software based routers,\n\n389\n00:20:20.374 --> 00:20:21.788\nhardware based routers.\n\n390\n00:20:21.788 --> 00:20:25.218\nWe gotta know those protocols or\na little bit about the protocols,\n\n391\n00:20:25.218 --> 00:20:26.884\nthe languages that they speak.\n\n392\n00:20:26.884 --> 00:20:30.443\nOther thing they mentioned in this\ntopic is going to be honeypots and\n\n393\n00:20:30.443 --> 00:20:32.387\na honeypot is an interesting thing.\n\n394\n00:20:32.387 --> 00:20:33.489\n>> Yeah.\nIt's one of my favorites.\n\n395\n00:20:33.489 --> 00:20:34.221\n>> Right.\n\n396\n00:20:34.221 --> 00:20:35.684\n>> I love the idea, it's just fantastic.\n\n397\n00:20:35.684 --> 00:20:37.588\nBasically, setting up the bait car.\n\n398\n00:20:37.588 --> 00:20:38.784\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n399\n00:20:38.784 --> 00:20:40.667\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You're opening that jar of honey,\n\n400\n00:20:40.667 --> 00:20:42.382\nwaiting to see what you're going to catch.\n\n401\n00:20:42.382 --> 00:20:46.387\nAnd there's a couple of different places,\nwe'll implement honeypots or reasons,\n\n402\n00:20:46.387 --> 00:20:49.380\nI should say that we would\nimplement that honeypot.\n\n403\n00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:53.105\nIn a corporate environment,\nI might setup a honeypot as a distraction.\n\n404\n00:20:53.105 --> 00:20:56.785\nThis is a way to pull the bad guys in.\n\n405\n00:20:56.785 --> 00:21:01.104\nThey break into my network and\nfirst thing they see is this honeypot.\n\n406\n00:21:01.104 --> 00:21:06.650\nThe honeypot is setup to look\nappetizing to entice them.\n\n407\n00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:09.869\nLet me be careful with that word,\nI don't want to use the word entice,\n\n408\n00:21:09.869 --> 00:21:13.363\nbecause then we start getting into\nentrapment rules and things like that and\n\n409\n00:21:13.363 --> 00:21:14.692\nit's really not enticing.\n\n410\n00:21:14.692 --> 00:21:15.969\n>> It's more misdirection, right?\n\n411\n00:21:15.969 --> 00:21:16.527\n>> Yes.\n\n412\n00:21:16.527 --> 00:21:19.406\n>> To misdirect them somewhere\nelse other than the good stuff.\n\n413\n00:21:19.406 --> 00:21:21.926\n>> Yes and they've already\nbroken into your network, so\n\n414\n00:21:21.926 --> 00:21:24.080\nyou're not enticing\nthem into your network.\n\n415\n00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:27.595\nBut that honeypot, when they get in there,\nthey see that honeypot and\n\n416\n00:21:27.595 --> 00:21:28.979\nthey go, oh, there we go.\n\n417\n00:21:28.979 --> 00:21:31.034\nThere's all the data,\nthat's what I need to attack.\n\n418\n00:21:31.034 --> 00:21:33.181\nThat's where they're gonna\nspend their time on.\n\n419\n00:21:33.181 --> 00:21:36.815\nMeanwhile, the rest of your\nnetwork is maybe it was safe.\n\n420\n00:21:36.815 --> 00:21:39.257\nAnd it gives you a chance\nto detect the attack,\n\n421\n00:21:39.257 --> 00:21:42.017\nstop the attack before they\nget to meaningful data.\n\n422\n00:21:42.017 --> 00:21:46.654\nThey honeypot will be loaded up with data\nthat looks like valid corporate data, but\n\n423\n00:21:46.654 --> 00:21:49.720\nit's not, it's nothing important.\n\n424\n00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.519\nSo that's one reason and\nthose are really easy to setup.\n\n425\n00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:54.701\nThere's several software-based\nhoneypots you can go out and\n\n426\n00:21:54.701 --> 00:21:57.470\nget and you can set those up and\nthat's the whole idea.\n\n427\n00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:00.303\nDistract them long enough to\ndetect them and stop the attack.\n\n428\n00:22:00.303 --> 00:22:04.226\nHoneypots can also be setup for\nresearch purposes and\n\n429\n00:22:04.226 --> 00:22:09.381\nthese are a little more complex to\nsetup and then have tons of logging.\n\n430\n00:22:09.381 --> 00:22:12.469\nThey are monitoring and logging,\neverything that's going on.\n\n431\n00:22:12.469 --> 00:22:16.293\nBecause the idea is I want to, I'm not\ntrying to distract them from anything\n\n432\n00:22:16.293 --> 00:22:20.538\nelse, I'm trying to gather information\nabout the attack methods they're using,\n\n433\n00:22:20.538 --> 00:22:22.830\nthe techniques that they're using.\n\n434\n00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:28.349\nSo these guys a lot more complex to setup,\nthe research ones, but they do nothing but\n\n435\n00:22:28.349 --> 00:22:32.654\naggregate data about these different\nattacks that are going on.\n\n436\n00:22:32.654 --> 00:22:34.918\nNext thing we wanna talk about,\ngood old perimeter networks.\n\n437\n00:22:34.918 --> 00:22:38.643\nAnd we've kind of hinted\naround this a couple of times,\n\n438\n00:22:38.643 --> 00:22:44.490\ncuz we've talked about firewalls and let's\ntalk about the perimeter network next.\n\n439\n00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:46.266\nBack in the day, a year ago,\n\n440\n00:22:46.266 --> 00:22:50.337\nwe would set up one layer of defense\nat the outside of our network.\n\n441\n00:22:50.337 --> 00:22:55.121\nWe'd have our firewall sitting out\nthere and that was the only thing in\n\n442\n00:22:55.121 --> 00:23:00.069\nbetween us and the internet and\noutside world, so everything was behind\n\n443\n00:23:00.069 --> 00:23:05.100\nthat firewall including things like\nmy web server and my mail server.\n\n444\n00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.707\nThese are things that need to be\naccessible from the outside, but the most\n\n445\n00:23:08.707 --> 00:23:12.489\nof my corporate network does not need to\nbe accessible by the general public or\n\n446\n00:23:12.489 --> 00:23:13.674\npeople outside there.\n\n447\n00:23:13.674 --> 00:23:19.595\nSo that's when we started\nsetting up perimeter networks.\n\n448\n00:23:19.595 --> 00:23:24.478\nIt's like a layer around our\ncorporate network in between us and\n\n449\n00:23:24.478 --> 00:23:27.559\nthe internet or any untrusted network.\n\n450\n00:23:27.559 --> 00:23:30.055\nIt doesn't really have to be the internet,\nbut generally it is.\n\n451\n00:23:30.055 --> 00:23:36.010\nThere are several names you'll hear\nthis called DMZ, Demilitarized Zone.\n\n452\n00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:41.400\nYou hear it called screen subnet,\nyou ever hear it called perimeter network.\n\n453\n00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.824\nIt is again, same concept.\n\n454\n00:23:43.824 --> 00:23:48.749\nJust a layer of protection around our\ncorporate network and let's take a look at\n\n455\n00:23:48.749 --> 00:23:53.820\nmy screen here, I'll show you one of the\nmore co Common implementations of a DMZ or\n\n456\n00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:58.451\na perimeter network is to set up what\nthey call a sandwiched screen subnet or\n\n457\n00:23:58.451 --> 00:24:02.230\na sandwich perimeter where we\nactually have two firewalls.\n\n458\n00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:07.720\nI've got one firewall that's protecting\nmy corporate network back here.\n\n459\n00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:11.350\nAnd then I've got my,\nin between these two guys, is my DMZ, or\n\n460\n00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:15.730\nmy perimeter network, and then I have\nanother firewall sitting out in front\n\n461\n00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:18.830\nbetween that perimeter network and\nthe Internet.\n\n462\n00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:20.310\nAnd the idea is,\n\n463\n00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:24.200\nI can allow certain types of traffic\nto come through this front firewall.\n\n464\n00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:28.910\nIt's a little more relaxed as\nto what it's going to allow.\n\n465\n00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:32.180\nThis back firewall,\nvery restricted, right?\n\n466\n00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:36.510\nOnly certain nodes are going to be\nable to communicate through that\n\n467\n00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:39.180\nrear facing firewall.\n\n468\n00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:42.200\nAnd what you would put\nout here in the DMZ,\n\n469\n00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:44.850\nthings that need to be\naccessed from the outside.\n\n470\n00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:47.150\nThis is going to be my VPN server.\n\n471\n00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:48.830\nThis is going to be my web server.\n\n472\n00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:52.750\nThis is going to be my mail proxy or\nthe front end of my mail solution.\n\n473\n00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:57.410\nMy wireless access point, if we're using\nradius to push that authentication off.\n\n474\n00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:58.990\nThose would sit out here.\n\n475\n00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:03.920\nAnd so I'm gonna allow that VPN request\nto come through this front firewall and\n\n476\n00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.420\nhit this VPN server.\n\n477\n00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:09.560\nBut only the VPN server then is allowed to\ncommunicate through that back firewall.\n\n478\n00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:14.145\nI could not establish a VPN connection\nfrom the outside back to one of these.\n\n479\n00:25:14.145 --> 00:25:17.190\nCuz this firewall is not gonna allow that,\nright?\n\n480\n00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:22.018\nYou can also do it in a, what we would\ncall a single firewall, where I've got\n\n481\n00:25:22.018 --> 00:25:26.413\na firewall and one of the ports on\nthe firewall is configured for DMZ.\n\n482\n00:25:26.413 --> 00:25:29.394\nSo basically, all traffic would\nbe forced through here, and\n\n483\n00:25:29.394 --> 00:25:33.370\nthen it would decide if it should allow\nthat traffic back to the intranet, right?\n\n484\n00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:38.778\nA little cheaper solution doing it\nthis way cuz I got a one firewall,\n\n485\n00:25:38.778 --> 00:25:40.444\nalthough not quite as secure.\n\n486\n00:25:40.444 --> 00:25:42.681\nBecause if this guy gets compromised,\n\n487\n00:25:42.681 --> 00:25:45.745\nthat can open up my internal\nnetwork to the Internet.\n\n488\n00:25:45.745 --> 00:25:53.250\nSo, less configuration, less cost,\nnot as secure of a solution.\n\n489\n00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:54.910\n>> Always that sliding scale, right Mike?\n\n490\n00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:57.730\nThe ease of use versus security.\n\n491\n00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:59.550\nYou put on one,\nthe other's gonna go down, so\n\n492\n00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:01.560\nit's just kinda the nature of that beast.\n\n493\n00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.615\n>> Exactly right.\n\n494\n00:26:02.615 --> 00:26:06.880\nAll right, next thing we wanna talk about,\nis good old network address translations.\n\n495\n00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:10.760\nLet's take a look, I've got a little\ndrawing, oet me find that one here.\n\n496\n00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:11.780\nGood old NAT.\n\n497\n00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:18.440\nNAT or network address translation is\na way that we can do a couple of things.\n\n498\n00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:23.930\nWe can obfuscate or\nhide my internal IP addressing scheme.\n\n499\n00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:26.686\nI guess before we get\ninto what it does though,\n\n500\n00:26:26.686 --> 00:26:29.200\nwe should figure out why we even have it.\n\n501\n00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.985\nAnd with IPv4,\nwe're not gonna go into Network+, but\n\n502\n00:26:31.985 --> 00:26:35.991\nIPv4 had a limited number of addresses,\n4 billion 200 and some odd million,\n\n503\n00:26:35.991 --> 00:26:38.330\nsomething like that,\nand we're running out.\n\n504\n00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:42.750\nThere's more nodes than that out\nthere that need Internet access.\n\n505\n00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:48.130\nSo what they did was the IEEE came\nup with the private address ranges.\n\n506\n00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:52.127\nEach one of our classes has a range\nof private addresses that can be used\n\n507\n00:26:52.127 --> 00:26:55.196\ninternally but\ncannot be routed out to the Internet.\n\n508\n00:26:55.196 --> 00:26:59.420\nLike your 192.168 address range for\nthe class C,\n\n509\n00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:03.820\n172.16 through 172.31 for\nyour class Bs, and\n\n510\n00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:08.925\nyour 10-dot addresses for\nyour class As, these are all private.\n\n511\n00:27:08.925 --> 00:27:10.457\nIt means you can use them internally and\n\n512\n00:27:10.457 --> 00:27:13.524\nyou don't have to worry about duplicating\naddresses with another business or\n\n513\n00:27:13.524 --> 00:27:16.288\nanything like that because they're\nnever gonna leave your network.\n\n514\n00:27:16.288 --> 00:27:20.170\nThey're never gonna be routed, they're not\nallowed to go past your border routers and\n\n515\n00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:21.860\nout there to the Internet.\n\n516\n00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:27.020\nBut, that sounds great until this guy\nover here with this private address\n\n517\n00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:30.640\nwants to get access to a server\nout there on the Internet.\n\n518\n00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.360\nHow the heck's he gonna do that?\n\n519\n00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:36.110\nWell we use a device that's running NAT,\nor network address translation.\n\n520\n00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:39.380\nAnd so\nthis guy has an IP address of 10.1.1.50.\n\n521\n00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:43.309\nThis has an IP address of\n10.1.1.100 on one side, but\n\n522\n00:27:43.309 --> 00:27:46.015\nhe has a public IP address\non the other side.\n\n523\n00:27:46.015 --> 00:27:51.430\nAnd then he's got the server out here is\nan 8.8.8.8 out there on the Internet.\n\n524\n00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:55.883\nSo what's gonna happen is I\nam going to send a packet.\n\n525\n00:27:55.883 --> 00:27:58.440\nI'm gonna try to reach that\nserver out there on the Internet.\n\n526\n00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:03.650\nWell initially the source is going\nto be my private IP address.\n\n527\n00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:08.640\nThe destination then is going to be\nthat server out there on the Internet.\n\n528\n00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:13.408\nWell as that packet travels, it's gonna\nhit my gateway which is running NAT here.\n\n529\n00:28:13.408 --> 00:28:19.650\nAnd my NAT device is gonna say, you can't\ngo out to the Internet with that address.\n\n530\n00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:25.483\nSo I'm gonna remove your address from\nthat packet and I'm gonna set it aside.\n\n531\n00:28:25.483 --> 00:28:29.730\nAnd I'm gonna replace it with that\npublic IP address that I have.\n\n532\n00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:35.379\nSo now as that packet travels along,\nwe're just gonna modify that address.\n\n533\n00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:39.100\nThat is routable,\nthat'll be allowed to go out.\n\n534\n00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:43.070\nThe other thing he's gonna do is\nhe's gonna assign a port number\n\n535\n00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:43.960\nto this guy up here.\n\n536\n00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:50.210\nAnd I'm just gonna put something like,\nI don't know, 12345.\n\n537\n00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:52.260\nRight, he picks a random port number.\n\n538\n00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:55.110\nIt's not actually used to\ndeliver traffic or anything so\n\n539\n00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:57.830\nhe just assigns a random number to that.\n\n540\n00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:00.360\nAnd now this packet is allowed to go out,\n\n541\n00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:03.500\noops, let's make sure we\ninclude those addresses.\n\n542\n00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:07.380\nThis packet's allowed out go out,\nhit the server.\n\n543\n00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:11.317\nNow, when this server responds,\n\n544\n00:29:11.317 --> 00:29:15.267\nall right, let's do it this way.\n\n545\n00:29:15.267 --> 00:29:19.077\nWe're just gonna swap these guys around,\nif I can.\n\n546\n00:29:19.077 --> 00:29:22.354\nWhen he responds, well now the source\naddress is his IP address,\n\n547\n00:29:22.354 --> 00:29:23.910\nbut what's the destination?\n\n548\n00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:27.150\nIt's not this guy back here.\n\n549\n00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:30.540\nIt's not this little client computer's\nIP address, he has no idea about that.\n\n550\n00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:34.670\nWhen it came in,\nit was coming from 12.2.4.50.\n\n551\n00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:37.510\nSo he puts that as the destination.\n\n552\n00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:43.020\nAnd now that packet is traveling\nback across the Internet,\n\n553\n00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:46.340\nusing those public, routable IP addresses.\n\n554\n00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:50.850\nOnce it gets over to here, this guy, the\nNAT device, says wait, I didn't ask for\n\n555\n00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:53.410\nanything from this IP address.\n\n556\n00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:55.510\nOh, you did up here, that's right.\n\n557\n00:29:55.510 --> 00:30:01.352\nSo let me take my IP address off of there\nand put your IP address back on there.\n\n558\n00:30:01.352 --> 00:30:07.670\nAnd he uses that port number,\nI forgot to actually show you that.\n\n559\n00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:10.390\nLet me back up just one second here.\n\n560\n00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:16.300\nWhen this packet went out,\nlet's go back all the way back here.\n\n561\n00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:20.000\nRight, he actually put\nthat port number here,\n\n562\n00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.960\nas well as here, and I'm just gonna\ntry to tuck it up under there.\n\n563\n00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.090\nSo as this, again, and\n\n564\n00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:27.960\nthat's not gonna make a difference\nto the web server that's responding.\n\n565\n00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:32.050\nSo as this pack, wow,\nif I can get all that together.\n\n566\n00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:36.200\nAs this packet made it out here, he sees\nthe packet as coming from 12.2.4.50 and\n\n567\n00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:40.950\nit's got this port number attached to\nit but he's not worried about that.\n\n568\n00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:46.850\nAnd the destination was 8.8.8.8:80,\nright, so I still get my webpage there.\n\n569\n00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:52.000\nAnd then on the way back,\nwe'll move this guy out of the way.\n\n570\n00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.780\nSo now the source is coming\nfrom that web server.\n\n571\n00:30:55.780 --> 00:31:00.662\nThe destination, again, is that\npublic IP address on my NAT device,\n\n572\n00:31:00.662 --> 00:31:03.415\nand attached to it is that port number.\n\n573\n00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:12.670\nSo when that packet gets back,\nwe'll do that again.\n\n574\n00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:15.050\nHe says, and\nmy port number didn't hang with me.\n\n575\n00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:17.921\nHe says well wait,\nwhat's this coming from 8.8.8.8?\n\n576\n00:31:17.921 --> 00:31:19.340\nI didn't ask for that.\n\n577\n00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:23.130\nOh wait, 12345,\nthat's this guy right here.\n\n578\n00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:29.040\nSo now I can take my IP address off of\nthere, I can your IP address back on.\n\n579\n00:31:31.995 --> 00:31:36.985\nAnd now the packet can successfully\ntravel back over here to the requester\n\n580\n00:31:36.985 --> 00:31:38.570\nof that data.\n\n581\n00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:40.859\nSo that is network address translation.\n\n582\n00:31:40.859 --> 00:31:45.745\nWe're temporarily translating that address\nfrom a internal non-routable private\n\n583\n00:31:45.745 --> 00:31:50.506\nIP address into a public address that can\nbe Transmitted out there on the Internet.\n\n584\n00:31:50.506 --> 00:31:51.552\nAnd then, when it comes back,\n\n585\n00:31:51.552 --> 00:31:54.740\nwe're swapping them back around, and\nputting that private IP address on.\n\n586\n00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:58.430\nAnd we get back to the destination,\nto that original center.\n\n587\n00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:01.220\nNow, there's two different\nways we can do NAT.\n\n588\n00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:04.080\nThere's the dynamic NAT and\nthere's static NAT.\n\n589\n00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.330\nIn this case,\n\n590\n00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:10.000\nI'm doing what's called dynamic NAT and\nI only had one IP address to choose from.\n\n591\n00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.940\nDynamic NAT means that the NAT\ndevice has a pool of addresses and\n\n592\n00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:15.750\nit doesn't matter which one it uses.\n\n593\n00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:21.520\nThis computer didn't care that he changed\nit to 12.2.4.50 on the way out and\n\n594\n00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:22.150\non the way back.\n\n595\n00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:25.430\nAs long as he gets his packet he's okay,\nall right?\n\n596\n00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:28.072\nSo, the NAT device can use this.\n\n597\n00:32:28.072 --> 00:32:31.670\nAnd this NAT device,\nif I've got a busy network, he might\n\n598\n00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:36.670\nhave more than one public IP address\nthat he's allowed to use, all right?\n\n599\n00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:39.420\nHe might have a stack of\naddresses that he can use.\n\n600\n00:32:42.994 --> 00:32:44.730\nAnd he just picks one from the pool.\n\n601\n00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:46.530\nThat's dynamic NAT.\n\n602\n00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:50.790\nStatic NAT, for every internal device\nthat has a private IP address,\n\n603\n00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:54.230\nthere's gonna be a public\naddress out here.\n\n604\n00:32:54.230 --> 00:33:00.280\nSo, when this guy comes through,\nit only uses this one IP address.\n\n605\n00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:04.221\nYou don't see it as often, because in that\ncase I would have to have a public IP\n\n606\n00:33:04.221 --> 00:33:08.118\naddress for every single machine that\nI had in my internal network, right?\n\n607\n00:33:08.118 --> 00:33:12.308\nAnd that's one of the beauties of this\nNAT is, instead of having to go out and\n\n608\n00:33:12.308 --> 00:33:16.890\npurchase public IP addresses for\nevery single machine, I can have three.\n\n609\n00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:21.000\nEven though I've got 3,000 clients,\nI only have 3 public IP addresses.\n\n610\n00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.700\nAnd I can just use them temporarily\nas that traffic goes out.\n\n611\n00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:27.360\nThe static NAT, you got addresses\nthat are assigned to those internal.\n\n612\n00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:31.150\nA lot of times what you'll see with\nstatic NAT is out in your DMZ.\n\n613\n00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:35.090\nThe web server might be statically\nNATed for when it needs to go out and\n\n614\n00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:39.480\ntalk to the Internet and\nit always uses the same public IP address.\n\n615\n00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:44.402\nAll right, so that's NAT, and Daniel I'll\ntell you that, that's probably good.\n\n616\n00:33:44.402 --> 00:33:47.340\nI know some other isolation\ntechniques that they mentioned,\n\n617\n00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:51.490\nwe've already talked about in\nother episodes in this series.\n\n618\n00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:53.398\nVPNs would be one, right?\n\n619\n00:33:53.398 --> 00:33:54.724\nA virtual private network,\n\n620\n00:33:54.724 --> 00:33:59.555\nyou're isolating your VPN traffic from the\nInternet by using that tunneling protocol.\n\n621\n00:33:59.555 --> 00:34:02.595\nIPsec is another way you\ncan isolate traffic.\n\n622\n00:34:02.595 --> 00:34:07.666\nIt encrypts the traffic, I can isolate\nit from the rest of my network outside.\n\n623\n00:34:07.666 --> 00:34:13.660\nWe can do IPsec VPN tunnels or we can do\nsite to site IPsec tunnels to isolate it.\n\n624\n00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:15.540\nWe can also do that internally, right?\n\n625\n00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:20.550\nWe can do server isolation and\ndomain isolation with IPsec.\n\n626\n00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:22.900\nIf I set up an IPsec policy that says,\nhey,\n\n627\n00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:28.150\nyou have to have a certificate issued by\nmy company's certificate of authority\n\n628\n00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:31.170\nin order to communicate with these guys,\nthen if you're from the outside and\n\n629\n00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:33.570\nyou don't have one of those certificates,\nyou don't talk.\n\n630\n00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:35.100\nYou're isolated.\n\n631\n00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:37.985\nWe can use isolation with\ncertificates like that,\n\n632\n00:34:37.985 --> 00:34:39.740\ncuz also do it with [INAUDIBLE].\n\n633\n00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:42.923\nIf you're not a member of my domain,\nif your computer doesn't have an account\n\n634\n00:34:42.923 --> 00:34:46.410\nactive directory, you don't get to talk to\nany of the servers in my network, right?\n\n635\n00:34:46.410 --> 00:34:48.620\nWe're doing that domain isolation.\n\n636\n00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:52.682\nSo, may different isolation techniques\nDaniel we can end up using to try to keep\n\n637\n00:34:52.682 --> 00:34:55.785\nour traffic and\nour network safe from unauthorized access.\n\n638\n00:34:55.785 --> 00:34:56.370\n>> And that's right.\n\n639\n00:34:56.370 --> 00:34:58.420\nAnd a little bit of\noptimization in there as well.\n\n640\n00:34:58.420 --> 00:34:59.589\nThrow that on as a kicker, right Mike?\n\n641\n00:34:59.589 --> 00:35:00.671\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n642\n00:35:00.671 --> 00:35:01.430\n>> All right, Mike.\n\n643\n00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:03.865\nThank you so much for\nthose cool demonstrations and\n\n644\n00:35:03.865 --> 00:35:05.232\ntechniques that we can use.\n\n645\n00:35:05.232 --> 00:35:07.866\nSegregate our traffic, gain that security,\n\n646\n00:35:07.866 --> 00:35:10.970\ngain that optimization\nthroughout our network.\n\n647\n00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:13.830\nThat being said, looks like we've come to\nthe end of yet another awesome episode.\n\n648\n00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:15.390\nHopefully, you guys have enjoyed it.\n\n649\n00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:16.570\nThank you so much for watching.\n\n650\n00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:19.920\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n651\n00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:20.780\n>> And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n652\n00:35:20.780

great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.398 --> 00:00:18.004\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\n\n5\n00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:21.285\njoining me in the studio today\nis none other than Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:22.600\nHow's it going today Mike?\n\n7\n00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.770\n>> Oh, it's going great Daniel.\n\n8\n00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:24.830\nI'm excited as always.\n\n9\n00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.390\nWe're doing more of our MTA content and\nour security fundamentals.\n\n10\n00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.600\nIn this episode we're gonna be\nlooking at protocol security.\n\n11\n00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.130\nProtocols being those languages or\n\n12\n00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.740\nthose set of rules that we use to\ncommunicate across our network.\n\n13\n00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.950\nAnd sometimes those can be abused,\nmisused, and\n\n14\n00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.920\ncan lead to some vulnerabilities.\n\n15\n00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.085\n>> That's right.\nSo we've gotta take some countermeasures.\n\n16\n00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:47.260\nWe gotta do what we can\nto secure them up so\n\n17\n00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.220\nthat people cannot continue to abuse or\nmisuse those set protocols.\n\n18\n00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.324\nNow Mike, I know there are many ways in\nwhich these things can be done because\n\n19\n00:00:55.324 --> 00:00:57.378\nthere's so\nmany different protocols out there.\n\n20\n00:00:57.378 --> 00:00:58.190\n>> Yeah.\n\n21\n00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.305\n>> So there's a lot of different\nattack venues in which they can come\n\n22\n00:01:00.305 --> 00:01:00.848\nat you, right?\n\n23\n00:01:00.848 --> 00:01:02.056\n>> There really are.\n\n24\n00:01:02.056 --> 00:01:06.919\nProbably one of the first ones we should\nstart with or the one that you've heard of\n\n25\n00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:10.137\nout there in TV land,\nis gonna be a denial of service or\n\n26\n00:01:10.137 --> 00:01:14.094\nwhat's called a distributed\ndenial of service, DOS, or DDOS.\n\n27\n00:01:14.094 --> 00:01:17.650\nAnd what that means is we're going\nto try to overload a protocol.\n\n28\n00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.640\nWe're gonna try to make it so busy that it\ncan't do what it's supposed to do, right?\n\n29\n00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.303\nSo if I say I want to do a denial of\nservice, say, on a web server, well,\n\n30\n00:01:27.303 --> 00:01:28.600\nwhat's a web server do?\n\n31\n00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.140\nA web server listens on port 80 and\nit waits for HTTP get request.\n\n32\n00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.580\nPeople wanting a web page to be\ndelivered to their browser on their end.\n\n33\n00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.935\nSo what I can do, is I can send request\nafter request after request after request\n\n34\n00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:46.302\nand try to send so many that that web\nserver just says, I can't keep up, right?\n\n35\n00:01:46.302 --> 00:01:51.283\nAnd all of a sudden, I got people that\nare legitimate customers trying to get to\n\n36\n00:01:51.283 --> 00:01:53.246\nmy webpage to buy my product and\n\n37\n00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:57.200\nthey can't because my web\nserver's too darnn busy, right?\n\n38\n00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.662\nNow, that's a denial of service attack and\nit can be done on other protocols as well.\n\n39\n00:02:01.662 --> 00:02:02.710\nThat was just one example.\n\n40\n00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.960\nA distributive denial of\nservice just means I'm going to\n\n41\n00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.090\nstep it up a notch, right?\n\n42\n00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.390\nWe're gonna throw in more attackers.\n\n43\n00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.200\nWhen if I was trying to attack a website,\nright?\n\n44\n00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.160\nThese websites nowadays it's not like,\ndepending, if it's a large organization,\n\n45\n00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.470\nthey're got many web servers.\n\n46\n00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.610\nThey've got a farm that's\nhosting this website,\n\n47\n00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.530\nso if one of their servers fails,\npeople can still get to their webpage.\n\n48\n00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.440\nSo, now all of the sudden,\n\n49\n00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.560\nmy one little attack computer can't\ndo a denial of service against them.\n\n50\n00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.040\nThey've got more resources than I've got\navailable to try to launch this attack,\n\n51\n00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.550\nso what do I do?\n\n52\n00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.200\nI distribute the attack, right?\n\n53\n00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.320\nI take 100 machines,\nI take 1,000 machines, and\n\n54\n00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.070\nI launch the attack from there.\n\n55\n00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.700\nNow all of a sudden I've got enough power\nto do an effective denial of service.\n\n56\n00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.151\nSo denial of service,\ndistributive denial of service,\n\n57\n00:02:49.151 --> 00:02:51.610\njust means that I'm going to\ndistribute the attack out.\n\n58\n00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.229\nThis is where you hear terms like zombies,\nor bot farms, or botnets.\n\n59\n00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:58.440\nThese are all machines that I can control.\n\n60\n00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.120\nI've infected them already somehow.\n\n61\n00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.400\nI've taken them over.\n\n62\n00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.100\nAnd when I click launch on my computer,\nit's not launching the attack.\n\n63\n00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.490\nIt's sending out the attack\nsignal to all those bots and\n\n64\n00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.170\nthen they all attack at once.\n\n65\n00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.077\nSo you've got denial of service,\nyou've got distributed denial of service.\n\n66\n00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.240\nSome other types of attacks\nare spoofing attacks.\n\n67\n00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.720\nAnd these can be done at\ndifferent protocols as well.\n\n68\n00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.898\nWe've got IP spoofing, we've got ARP\nspoofing, we've got DNS spoofing.\n\n69\n00:03:23.898 --> 00:03:28.109\nAnd spoofing, Daniel,\nas we've said earlier,\n\n70\n00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:32.431\nit's just pretending to\nbe something else right?\n\n71\n00:03:32.431 --> 00:03:35.080\n>> Yeah,\nyou're blocking these IP addresses right?\n\n72\n00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.462\nWell, I know that those IP\naddresses are being blocked.\n\n73\n00:03:37.462 --> 00:03:40.170\nI'm gonna find a range of IP addresses\nthat aren't being blocked, and\n\n74\n00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.810\nI'm gonna pretend that\nthat's my IP address.\n\n75\n00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.630\nThe same with a lot of different\nprotocols, basically the same idea.\n\n76\n00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.860\nI'm going to wrap around my real\n\n77\n00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.220\nIP address with a fake one that says,\noh, I'm trusted.\n\n78\n00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.950\nYou can trust me.\n\n79\n00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.420\nI'm something you wanna allow through.\n\n80\n00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.460\nThe firewalls, take a look at that.\n\n81\n00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.906\nAll the security measures\nwe take a look at.\n\n82\n00:04:01.906 --> 00:04:06.195\nWe'll look at that and go, oh yeah,\nyeah, that 1.2.5 address or\n\n83\n00:04:06.195 --> 00:04:08.490\nwhatever it is, is allowed through.\n\n84\n00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.740\nSo go ahead, come on in.\n\n85\n00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.245\nYou're on the list sir.\n\n86\n00:04:11.245 --> 00:04:13.850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And they allow that traffic.\n\n87\n00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.040\nSo that's a common way spoofing is done.\n\n88\n00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.920\n>> It is, and a lot of times it\nleads to other types of attacks.\n\n89\n00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.040\nSo what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna\nopen up a command prompt here and\n\n90\n00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.200\ntake a look at my ARP cache.\n\n91\n00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.858\nI'll do a little arp -a.\n\n92\n00:04:25.858 --> 00:04:30.074\nAnd what's happening here is,\nmy machine is trying to deliver a packet,\n\n93\n00:04:30.074 --> 00:04:34.089\nsay trying to connect to 201, and\nit needs that physical address.\n\n94\n00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:39.812\nSo again, IP calls ARP, ARP resolves\nthat IP address into a MAC address.\n\n95\n00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:44.050\nNow my machine can connect or\ndeliver that data.\n\n96\n00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.930\nFor example, you don't see 101 in here.\n\n97\n00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.027\nBy pinging svr01,\nit'll ping that IP address.\n\n98\n00:04:51.027 --> 00:04:55.258\nIf I now look at my cache,\nI'll see that 101\n\n99\n00:04:55.258 --> 00:04:59.910\nhas now been turned into a MAC address,\nright?\n\n100\n00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.150\nSo in order to deliver that packet,\nthat ping packet,\n\n101\n00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.690\nmy computer knows the IP address that\nhe wants to send that packet to.\n\n102\n00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.528\nBut in order to finish the process, it has\nto turn the IP address into a MAC address.\n\n103\n00:05:10.528 --> 00:05:15.370\nSo, IP calls ARP, ARP resolves it\ninto a MAC address and now it can go.\n\n104\n00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.323\nBut notice I cache the response and\nthat's really what I wanted to show you,\n\n105\n00:05:18.323 --> 00:05:19.719\nwas that I've got this cache here.\n\n106\n00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:23.988\nSo the next time my computer\nneeds to talk to 101, 10.1.1.101,\n\n107\n00:05:23.988 --> 00:05:26.140\nhe already knows the MAC address.\n\n108\n00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.360\nIt doesn't even have to bother.\n\n109\n00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.560\nAnd this is a type of attack we can do.\n\n110\n00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.430\nI can insert bad data into your ARP cache.\n\n111\n00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.870\nI can attempt to do that.\n\n112\n00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.760\nAnd I can redirect traffic, right?\n\n113\n00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.573\nYour computer says, oh,\nI need to connect to 101.\n\n114\n00:05:39.573 --> 00:05:42.510\nBut what if this was\nthe bad guy's MAC address?\n\n115\n00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.560\nWhat if he put bad information in there?\n\n116\n00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.878\nYour computer wouldn't know any better.\n\n117\n00:05:45.878 --> 00:05:50.547\nIt would say I already know the MAC\naddress for 10.1.1.101, here it is,\n\n118\n00:05:50.547 --> 00:05:54.562\nI'll go ahead and put that in my\npacket and send it on it's way, right?\n\n119\n00:05:54.562 --> 00:05:58.696\nThat would be what's called ARP poisoning,\nif I can say that.\n\n120\n00:05:58.696 --> 00:06:03.290\nAnd now this is the first step in what\nwe call a man in the middle attack.\n\n121\n00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:04.730\n>> Yeah, very, very common and\n\n122\n00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.420\ndangerous type of attack, because what\nit does is it says, well, guess what?\n\n123\n00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.360\nThat ARP you were looking for?\n\n124\n00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.030\nThat's me.\n\n125\n00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.770\nSo, if you need to send packets to that IP\naddress, I'm the ARP you're looking for.\n\n126\n00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.630\nAnd then it tells the machine\nthat it actually was looking for,\n\n127\n00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.010\nyou know that guy that's\ntrying to send you?\n\n128\n00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.860\nWell, that's actually me, and poisons his\nARP table like what Mike's showing you.\n\n129\n00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.330\nSo, both of those devices start\nsending all the data that's meant for\n\n130\n00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.990\neach other to that guy in the middle.\n\n131\n00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.790\nAnd then he sends it on the way.\n\n132\n00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.200\nBut, while he sits in the middle, he can\ntake a look, oh, that's nice information.\n\n133\n00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.650\nOh, what's on this sheet of paper?\n\n134\n00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:37.858\nAs he passes it along.\n\n135\n00:06:37.858 --> 00:06:39.530\nHe sits in the middle and\nhe can capture data.\n\n136\n00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.330\nIt's a very dangerous attack.\n\n137\n00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.030\n>> It is and\n\n138\n00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.670\nsometimes it can be really difficult\nto detect that it's even going on.\n\n139\n00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.330\nDNS spoofing is another one we can do.\n\n140\n00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.620\nDNS being our name resolution protocol.\n\n141\n00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.703\nYour computer, when you type in a name,\nlike I did just a minute ago.\n\n142\n00:06:54.703 --> 00:06:57.470\nI typed in srv01, I tried to ping that.\n\n143\n00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.930\nWell computers can't connect to names,\nthey can only connect to IP addresses.\n\n144\n00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.650\nSo my computer called up DNS and\n\n145\n00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:08.150\nsaid hey, my user wants to send a packet\nto svr01, what's its IP address?\n\n146\n00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.550\nDNS responded with that IP address.\n\n147\n00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:15.170\nThat information gets cached as well,\nboth on the client end and the server end.\n\n148\n00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:19.332\nAnd I can spoof that information\nbecause then your computer again,\n\n149\n00:07:19.332 --> 00:07:22.848\nwill use that cache before it\ntries to look it up, right?\n\n150\n00:07:22.848 --> 00:07:24.555\nThink about your phone.\n\n151\n00:07:24.555 --> 00:07:26.853\nYou've got your recently called list,\nright?\n\n152\n00:07:26.853 --> 00:07:28.711\nInstead of going to my contacts and\n\n153\n00:07:28.711 --> 00:07:31.400\nlooking a name up to try\nto find that phone number,\n\n154\n00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.514\nI can go to my recently called and go,\nI just called Daniel a few minutes ago.\n\n155\n00:07:35.514 --> 00:07:38.369\nI can go to recently called and hit it\nright there and I can call him again.\n\n156\n00:07:38.369 --> 00:07:40.792\nThat's what your computer is\nusing using that cache for.\n\n157\n00:07:40.792 --> 00:07:43.952\nWhy go look it up all over again if\nI've already looked it up once and\n\n158\n00:07:43.952 --> 00:07:45.562\nI cached the response?\n\n159\n00:07:45.562 --> 00:07:46.951\nBad guys take advantage of that.\n\n160\n00:07:46.951 --> 00:07:49.780\nWe can get in there and\npoison those caches, and\n\n161\n00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.990\nwe can put bad information in there.\n\n162\n00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:53.839\nAnd your computer doesn't\nknow any different, right.\n\n163\n00:07:53.839 --> 00:07:55.383\nThat's the problem with that.\n\n164\n00:07:55.383 --> 00:07:58.309\nIP spoofing, I think Daniel mentioned\nthat towards the beginning there.\n\n165\n00:07:58.309 --> 00:08:03.400\nThat's another one that they can\ntry to do IPBR Internet protocol,\n\n166\n00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.287\nour addressing scheme.\n\n167\n00:08:05.287 --> 00:08:07.841\nAnd he gave a great example.\n\n168\n00:08:07.841 --> 00:08:11.874\nOn firewalls, a lot of times we'll say\nwe only want to allow traffic from this\n\n169\n00:08:11.874 --> 00:08:16.420\nparticular subnet, that way other traffic\nis just gonna get dropped at the firewall.\n\n170\n00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.370\nIt's never even gonna make it in there.\n\n171\n00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.410\nWell, what a bad guy's gonna do,\n\n172\n00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:24.780\nis try to find out what your IP address\nrange is on the inside of your network.\n\n173\n00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:29.610\nAnd then they can spoof that, they can\nforge a packet using these utilities\n\n174\n00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.170\nwhere I can manually create the packet,\nright?\n\n175\n00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:34.750\nAnd I can specify what\nthe source address is.\n\n176\n00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.740\nAnd I can use one of your\ninternal private IP addresses.\n\n177\n00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.890\nAnd even though I'm on the outside, I can\ntry to send that packet to your network.\n\n178\n00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:43.611\nAnd hopefully, your firewall says, oh.\n\n179\n00:08:43.611 --> 00:08:46.571\nYeah, that's the right subnet address,\nI'll allow that through.\n\n180\n00:08:46.571 --> 00:08:50.623\nSo that'd be right behind IP spoofing.\n\n181\n00:08:50.623 --> 00:08:54.512\nOther attack methods, well you know\nwe mentioned man in the middle.\n\n182\n00:08:54.512 --> 00:08:59.320\nBack door attacks, another common one\nthat these bad guys are trying to do.\n\n183\n00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.143\nAnd that's just leaving a way in.\n\n184\n00:09:01.143 --> 00:09:06.150\nWhen we talk about a back door, we're\ntalking about a way to get around our\n\n185\n00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:10.200\nprimary entry,\nwhich means rather than authenticating,\n\n186\n00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.300\nor going through that main door if you\nwill, I'm gonna come around the back door.\n\n187\n00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.990\nI've got a secret account.\n\n188\n00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:20.510\nI've got a way to get in, or\nI can bypass your authentication.\n\n189\n00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:22.980\nA lot of times this is what\nwe do with Trojan horses.\n\n190\n00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.450\nWe talked about those in another episode.\n\n191\n00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:28.460\nThat Trojan horse delivers my backdoor.\n\n192\n00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:31.930\nIt now calls home from inside and\nI can get in.\n\n193\n00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.240\nI'm bypassing all of your security.\n\n194\n00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.350\nAdministrators like to\ndo this intentionally.\n\n195\n00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:40.150\nThey'll leave accounts that they know of\nthat nobody else knows of that they can\n\n196\n00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.290\nuse to try to get into those networks.\n\n197\n00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:43.743\nAnd sometimes you fire an admin and\n\n198\n00:09:43.743 --> 00:09:46.409\nall of a sudden strange things\nstart to happen on your network.\n\n199\n00:09:46.409 --> 00:09:48.001\nHe might have done that very thing.\n\n200\n00:09:48.001 --> 00:09:49.023\n>> Ghost in the machine.\n\n201\n00:09:49.023 --> 00:09:50.002\nRight, Mike?\n[LAUGH]\n\n202\n00:09:50.002 --> 00:09:50.757\n>> Yeah.\n\n203\n00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:52.910\nYou gotta watch that.\n\n204\n00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:55.280\nWe talked about DNS poisoning.\n\n205\n00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.740\nReplay attacks are another one.\n\n206\n00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:01.660\nI'm gonna show you in a minute about\ncapturing traffic using a packet\n\n207\n00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:05.585\ncapture utility, that allows me to capture\ndata that's traveling across a network.\n\n208\n00:10:05.585 --> 00:10:09.285\nWell, what if I sit here and I know\nDaniel's getting ready to log in, so\n\n209\n00:10:09.285 --> 00:10:11.830\nI go ahead and\nfire up my packet capture utility.\n\n210\n00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:17.019\nAnd as his login traffic goes across\nthe network, I grab a copy of it, right.\n\n211\n00:10:17.019 --> 00:10:20.955\nAnd then later on in the day, I decide I\nwant to login as Daniel, I just get that\n\n212\n00:10:20.955 --> 00:10:24.610\ntraffic that I captured, and\nI spit it back out on the network, right?\n\n213\n00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:27.410\nI try to authenticate as Daniel.\n\n214\n00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:29.790\nThat would be an example\nof a replay attack.\n\n215\n00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:34.795\nSocial engineering, I know we've talked\nabout that in a couple of episodes,\n\n216\n00:10:34.795 --> 00:10:37.518\nthat's taking advantage of,\nlet me not use that word.\n\n217\n00:10:37.518 --> 00:10:39.949\n[LAUGH]\n>> Doesn't start with s and\n\n218\n00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:41.726\nend in tupidity, does it Mike?\n\n219\n00:10:41.726 --> 00:10:44.164\n>> [LAUGH] It might have.\n\n220\n00:10:44.164 --> 00:10:51.010\nSocial engineering is taking advantage of\nthe human element in our networks, right?\n\n221\n00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:54.940\nMuch more difficult to patch\nthat part of our network.\n\n222\n00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:59.800\nSo it's easy to talk people into giving\ninformation that they shouldn't give.\n\n223\n00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.840\nPeople wanna be helpful.\n\n224\n00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.110\nPeople wanna be liked.\n\n225\n00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:04.600\nPeople wanna be thought of as smart.\n\n226\n00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:10.260\nAnd so with a few words and tricks, we\ncan convince people to do strange things,\n\n227\n00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.870\nor things that they really should know\nbetter, and that's social engineering.\n\n228\n00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:15.830\n>> You know it's really funny\nwith the social engineering.\n\n229\n00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.560\nWe were making a joke about it being\nstupidity but it's not really.\n\n230\n00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:23.160\nIt's just the idea that well, we have\npeople that are ignorant about topics,\n\n231\n00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.600\nit's not pejorative,\nit's not a bad thing, it\n\n232\n00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.000\njust means you don't know about something\n>> And the hackers or\n\n233\n00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.010\nwhoever the bad guys are, they're going\nto start taking advantage of that.\n\n234\n00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:33.280\nBecause you don't know.\n\n235\n00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.910\nAnd because they speak with authority\nyou tend to trust them, right?\n\n236\n00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:38.490\nThey sound like they know\nwhat they're talking about,\n\n237\n00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.760\ntherefore they must know\nwhat they're talking about.\n\n238\n00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.970\nAnd they'll use that to their advantage.\n\n239\n00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:47.310\n>> There's a lot of different things we\ncan try to do to protect against these,\n\n240\n00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:51.690\nand in this one we're specifically\nlooking at that protocol security.\n\n241\n00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:54.390\nA couple of things we can do,\none is tunneling.\n\n242\n00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:57.720\nTunneling is, we're not digging a tunnel\nto China or anything like that.\n\n243\n00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.930\nTunneling means we're\ngoing to do encapsulation.\n\n244\n00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:05.730\nAnd we do tunneling for two different\nreasons, one to secure traffic or\n\n245\n00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:08.900\nto support an unsupported protocol, right?\n\n246\n00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:13.270\nWhen we talk about securing traffic,\na VPN is a great example,\n\n247\n00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:14.760\nvirtual private network.\n\n248\n00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.430\nWhen my users at home,\n\n249\n00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:20.280\nI want them to be able to create a VPN\nconnection back to the corporate network.\n\n250\n00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.930\nSo that they can work from home, right?\n\n251\n00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:25.590\nAnd they can connect to all those\nresources on my corporate network.\n\n252\n00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:29.785\nThe problem is, they're sending\nthat data across the Internet,\n\n253\n00:12:29.785 --> 00:12:31.905\nwhich is an unsecured network, right.\n\n254\n00:12:31.905 --> 00:12:34.015\nThat's a public infrastructure.\n\n255\n00:12:34.015 --> 00:12:37.435\nAnd so somehow gotta keep that\ndata safe from prying eyes.\n\n256\n00:12:37.435 --> 00:12:39.165\nWell, we tunnel, right.\n\n257\n00:12:39.165 --> 00:12:44.133\nWe take a VPN protocol like SSTP or IKEV2,\n\n258\n00:12:44.133 --> 00:12:47.310\nor L2TP, or SS, or PPTP.\n\n259\n00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:52.180\nAnd we take your normal traffic that\nyou're sending, and we encapsulate it.\n\n260\n00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:55.810\nWe wrap it up inside this other protocol.\n\n261\n00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:58.160\nAnd that protocol encrypts that data.\n\n262\n00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.785\nWhen it gets to the other end of that\ntunnel, like the corporate network,\n\n263\n00:13:01.785 --> 00:13:03.665\nwe can just peel that outer layer off.\n\n264\n00:13:03.665 --> 00:13:05.831\nAnd as it gets onto the corporate network,\n\n265\n00:13:05.831 --> 00:13:09.020\nit's right back to a normal LAN packet,\nright?\n\n266\n00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:12.460\nSo that's tunneling or encapsulation.\n\n267\n00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.228\nAs I say if we can do\nit to secure traffic,\n\n268\n00:13:14.228 --> 00:13:16.984\nanother one would be would be used for\nunsupported protocols.\n\n269\n00:13:16.984 --> 00:13:21.131\nWhat if I've got an IPv4\nportion on my network and\n\n270\n00:13:21.131 --> 00:13:24.690\nI need to send IPv6 traffic across it?\n\n271\n00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:26.110\nWell, I can encapsulate that.\n\n272\n00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:30.237\nI can create a tunnel to\npass that traffic through.\n\n273\n00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:32.717\nWhat else we got?\n\n274\n00:13:32.717 --> 00:13:33.693\nWe got IPsec.\n\n275\n00:13:33.693 --> 00:13:40.650\nIPsec is a tool, IP Security is a protocol\nthat we can use to protect our traffic.\n\n276\n00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:45.730\nWe can do what we call authentication\nheader, which means it's going to\n\n277\n00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:50.150\nprotect the header of that packet, or the\nsource and destination information it is.\n\n278\n00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:53.210\nThat doesn't do anything for\nthe payload, the actual data.\n\n279\n00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:55.760\nOr we can do what we call an ESP, or\n\n280\n00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.870\nencapsulating security payload,\nwhere we encapsulate the payload, right?\n\n281\n00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:02.740\nEncapsulating security\npayload kind of says it all.\n\n282\n00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:07.490\nWe're going to encrypt the traffic,\nthe body of that packet.\n\n283\n00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:11.212\nWe could also do transport mode and\ntunnel mode with IPsec.\n\n284\n00:14:11.212 --> 00:14:15.948\nThis is a very common thing to set up an\nIPsec tunnel between my corporate office\n\n285\n00:14:15.948 --> 00:14:17.890\nand my branch office.\n\n286\n00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:22.080\nI've got my routers as endpoints, and\nI create an IPsec tunnel between them.\n\n287\n00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.780\nSo that my users out there at the branch\noffice, I don't have to have every single\n\n288\n00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:29.980\nuser out there, create individual\ntunnels back to the corporate office.\n\n289\n00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.780\nI create one tunnel between\nmy two routers, and\n\n290\n00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.120\nnow all traffic flowing between\nthe corporate office and\n\n291\n00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:39.070\nthe branch office is gonna\nbe protected in there.\n\n292\n00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:44.870\nTransport mode is used when we're doing\nfrom a particular source to a destination,\n\n293\n00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:48.070\nlike from this server to this server.\n\n294\n00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:50.170\nTunnel mode is used between endpoints,\n\n295\n00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:52.730\nlike two routers,\nto protect all the traffic.\n\n296\n00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:57.580\nYou might use transport mode to protect,\nlet's say you're doing DNS standard zones\n\n297\n00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:00.960\nwhich is not encrypted as\nthat replication occurs.\n\n298\n00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:05.240\nYou might set an IPs tunnel and transport\nmode between those two DNS servers to\n\n299\n00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:11.565\nprotect just that DNS replication,\nnot their other normal traffic, all right?\n\n300\n00:15:11.565 --> 00:15:15.820\nDNSSEC, this is a new an addition to DNS.\n\n301\n00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:19.050\nI say new, it's been around for\na little while now, but\n\n302\n00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:21.770\nit's relatively new in computer speak.\n\n303\n00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.390\nIn its way to help secure DNS.\n\n304\n00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:28.150\nAnd we talked about DNS spoofing,\nDNS poisoning.\n\n305\n00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:32.330\nI need to make sure that those\nclients are getting responses\n\n306\n00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.250\nfrom the appropriate DNS server.\n\n307\n00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:37.005\nWhat if somebody could redirect\nme to their DNS server, and\n\n308\n00:15:37.005 --> 00:15:39.276\nthen they could control\nwhat I'm getting back?\n\n309\n00:15:39.276 --> 00:15:42.167\nSo when I query for bankofamerica.com,\n\n310\n00:15:42.167 --> 00:15:47.708\nthey send me back the wrong IP address for\ntheir Bank of America server, right?\n\n311\n00:15:47.708 --> 00:15:52.920\n>> Well, DNS sec says let's digitally,\nlet's sign these responses.\n\n312\n00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:56.540\nLet's allow our DNS server to add\na digital signature to the response.\n\n313\n00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.820\nAnd then when a client\ngets that response he can\n\n314\n00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:03.240\nverify the identity of\nthe originating DNS server.\n\n315\n00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:07.680\nHe can say, all right, I've got the, we'll\ntry not to get too deep into this, but\n\n316\n00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:12.770\nI've got the public key for that DNS\nserver, if I can use it's public key to\n\n317\n00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:18.670\ndecrypt this signature, then I know\nit came from the, my DNS server.\n\n318\n00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:19.170\nRight?\n\n319\n00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:22.320\nAnd not some rogue DNS server.\n\n320\n00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:27.440\nSo DNS Sec allows me to make sure that I'm\ngetting these responses from a legitimate\n\n321\n00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:33.810\nDNS server and not being spoofed into\ntalking to a different DNS server.\n\n322\n00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:36.554\nSo, let's take a look at\na couple of these things here.\n\n323\n00:16:36.554 --> 00:16:40.890\nI wanna show you IP sec first of all, and\n\n324\n00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:42.880\nwe'll take a look at\ncapturing traffic as well.\n\n325\n00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.760\nSomething else they call out in the exam.\n\n326\n00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:47.920\nCuz when it comes to protocol security,\nthe best way to do it\n\n327\n00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.740\nis to look at the protocols, look at the\ndata that's traveling across the network.\n\n328\n00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:55.200\nAnd we've got freely available tools,\nwe've got some we can get from Microsoft,\n\n329\n00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:00.010\nwe've got others out there that we can get\nthat'll allow us to capture that data.\n\n330\n00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:01.120\nSo let's take a peek here.\n\n331\n00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:05.030\nThe first thing I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna set up IPSec and we're gonna do it\n\n332\n00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:10.380\nin the authentication mode to where\nwe're gonna require authentication.\n\n333\n00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:17.960\nSo, on my server here, I've got\na shared folder somewhere called data.\n\n334\n00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.520\nAll right, there.\n\n335\n00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:24.270\nAnd then on my client, I should be\nable to connect to that folder.\n\n336\n00:17:27.858 --> 00:17:28.613\nAll right.\n\n337\n00:17:28.613 --> 00:17:29.420\nSo there we go.\n\n338\n00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.410\nI can see those two files there.\n\n339\n00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:34.950\nNow what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\ngo back over to the server here, and\n\n340\n00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:36.075\nwe're gonna enable IPSec.\n\n341\n00:17:36.075 --> 00:17:39.910\nSo I'm gonna open up my firewall\nwith advanced security.\n\n342\n00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:43.660\nAnd I'm gonna go to my\nconnection security rules.\n\n343\n00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:47.510\nAnd I've already created one, but you know\nwhat, let's just do it again real quick so\n\n344\n00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:48.250\nI can show you.\n\n345\n00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:51.490\nI'll make a new rule.\n\n346\n00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:55.820\nAnd I'm gonna do a custom rule so\nwe get to see all of the options.\n\n347\n00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:01.260\nAnd I'll go from any IP address\nto any IP address, and for\n\n348\n00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.390\nthe server I'm gonna require\nauthentication for inbound connections,\n\n349\n00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:08.720\nrequest authentication for\noutbound connections, I'll click next.\n\n350\n00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.630\nAnd I wanna authenticate the computer.\n\n351\n00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:12.140\nI'll click next.\n\n352\n00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:13.440\nAnd I'll say any protocol.\n\n353\n00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.101\nBut I could chose a specific protocol\nif that's all I needed to protect.\n\n354\n00:18:17.101 --> 00:18:18.224\nI'll click next.\n\n355\n00:18:18.224 --> 00:18:21.514\nAnd I'll do it on all three profiles,\nthat's fine.\n\n356\n00:18:21.514 --> 00:18:23.180\nI'll click next.\n\n357\n00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.580\nAnd I'll give it a name.\n\n358\n00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.980\nI call it my famous ASDF, and finish.\n\n359\n00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:30.525\nAnd now I've got this rule.\n\n360\n00:18:30.525 --> 00:18:35.592\nand if I go back over to my client and\ntry to connect to that share\n\n361\n00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:42.730\nit's not gonna allow me, because now\nthat server is requiring authentication.\n\n362\n00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:46.240\nIt wants to verify the identity of\nthe computer that's attempting to make\n\n363\n00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.320\nthat connection.\n\n364\n00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.690\nAnd if they can't,\nit's not gonna allow me to connect.\n\n365\n00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:54.710\nSo what I'll do on this guy\nis set up a matching policy.\n\n366\n00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:57.460\nI'll open up my firewall\nagain with advanced security.\n\n367\n00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.650\nAnd I go to my Connection Security Rules.\n\n368\n00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:04.130\nAnd I've already got a policy\nthere that's set up.\n\n369\n00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:07.580\nOn a client,\nI set it to Request Authentication\n\n370\n00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:11.070\nbecause my client typically does things\nthat are unsecure as well as secure.\n\n371\n00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:13.900\nThe server, I want every\nconnection to be authenticated.\n\n372\n00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:15.260\nSo I've already created a policy.\n\n373\n00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.380\nAll I'm gonna do is go ahead and\nenable that policy.\n\n374\n00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:25.200\nClose that, and\nI will start this connection over again.\n\n375\n00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:32.204\nSo we'll try to connect over that server,\nand we'll give it a second.\n\n376\n00:19:34.526 --> 00:19:37.568\nAnd then we'll let this guy connect,\nor we won't.\n\n377\n00:19:37.568 --> 00:19:38.970\nLet's try that again.\n\n378\n00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:41.620\nLet's open up my services.\n\n379\n00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:44.217\nSometimes when you change\na policy like that,\n\n380\n00:19:44.217 --> 00:19:48.811\nyou gotta make sure that the service, it\nloads up your policy at the very beginning\n\n381\n00:19:48.811 --> 00:19:51.260\nwhen you first start that machine.\n\n382\n00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:54.960\nThere is a service called\nIPSec policy agent.\n\n383\n00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.150\nAnd so\nsince I've already started the machine and\n\n384\n00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:00.360\nchanged the policy, sometimes it takes\na minute for those settings to kick in.\n\n385\n00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.840\nIf you wanted to speed that up,\n\n386\n00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:05.760\nyou could just restart that\nIPSec policy agent service.\n\n387\n00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.830\nSo I see that it is started.\n\n388\n00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:08.890\nThat should be good to go.\n\n389\n00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:09.990\nNow we'll try this again.\n\n390\n00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:13.500\nAnd there we go.\n\n391\n00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:14.146\nI'm in.\n\n392\n00:20:14.146 --> 00:20:15.070\nAll right?\n\n393\n00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:16.470\nAnd let's see what's going on.\n\n394\n00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:20.940\nIf we open up this console,\nI've got a IP security monitor.\n\n395\n00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:22.530\nThere's my client.\n\n396\n00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:28.040\nAnd I will see underneath main mode and\n\n397\n00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:33.235\nsecurity associations there is my\nconnection that I have over to\n\n398\n00:20:33.235 --> 00:20:38.560\n10.1.1.75, which is that server.\n\n399\n00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.736\nI don't know why I'm showing\nthat side of it, but anyway.\n\n400\n00:20:40.736 --> 00:20:42.423\nOh, there's my peer.\n10.1., that's me.\n\n401\n00:20:42.423 --> 00:20:47.508\nI'm the client at 75 and\nthen there's my server address 10.11.101.\n\n402\n00:20:47.508 --> 00:20:50.115\nSo I've got this here, at this point,\n\n403\n00:20:50.115 --> 00:20:54.940\nthis authenticated connection going\non between me and that server.\n\n404\n00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:56.840\nAnd this is the way I can protect.\n\n405\n00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.490\nThink about this, if a vendor comes in or\n\n406\n00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:01.810\na bad guy's in your network, they're not\ngonna be able to authenticate, right?\n\n407\n00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:04.330\nThey don't have an account\nin active directory\n\n408\n00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:07.260\nthat they can use to verify\ntheir identity with that server.\n\n409\n00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.710\nThat server's not gonna\nallow them to connect.\n\n410\n00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:11.940\nSo we're keeping that server safe.\n\n411\n00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:15.330\nAnd in this case,\nwith all protocols we're using SMB, or\n\n412\n00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:18.610\nmy server message block\nin this particular case.\n\n413\n00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.970\nBut just a way I can help\nprotect that security.\n\n414\n00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:23.490\n>> Yeah.\nI know it seems like a lot of\n\n415\n00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:24.480\nadministration, right?\n\n416\n00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.570\nA lot of work to get this set up.\n\n417\n00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:27.720\nIt really isn't.\n\n418\n00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.550\nMike's trying to show this to you so\nit takes a little longer than normally.\n\n419\n00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:34.880\nIt'd probably take him five minutes to get\nthis set up in just a normal environment.\n\n420\n00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.680\nBut it does take a little bit of work,\nand that work might seem like, oh,\n\n421\n00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.890\nman I don't wanna go through all that.\n\n422\n00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:42.930\nBut if you have data that is mission\ncritical it needs to be secured,\n\n423\n00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:44.200\nit needs to be safe.\n\n424\n00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.700\nI mean, and this is talking about\nthings like credit card numbers, right?\n\n425\n00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:50.760\nThat's probably an interesting\nitem that we don't want\n\n426\n00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.020\nbeing grabbed by some bad guy.\n\n427\n00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.980\nSo using methods like\nthis to secure that up so\n\n428\n00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:00.520\nthat if they do somehow get on our\nnetwork, or start capturing packets that\n\n429\n00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:04.700\nare crossing the line somewhere,\nthey're gonna see a whole lot of garbage.\n\n430\n00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:08.830\nThey're just gonna get encrypted output\ncuz you put that security on that.\n\n431\n00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:10.370\nPlus there's tunneling going on.\n\n432\n00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:12.450\nSo it's really kind of a point\nto point thing that's,\n\n433\n00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:16.170\nthey'd really have to go through\na lot of work to even get the data.\n\n434\n00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:18.920\nAnd then when they do, well,\nit's basically useless for\n\n435\n00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.470\nthem because they're not\ngonna be able to decrypt it.\n\n436\n00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:22.340\n>> Exactly.\nWell, let's take a look.\n\n437\n00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:26.200\nI've got a protocol analyzer, or\na packet capture utility loaded up, and\n\n438\n00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.800\nI'll show you what Daniel's talking about,\nand how easy it is for\n\n439\n00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:34.120\nanybody that can get in between you and\nwhatever it is you're talking to,\n\n440\n00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:36.570\nhow easy it is for\nthem to capture that information.\n\n441\n00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:37.720\nSo this is Wireshark.\n\n442\n00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.460\nFreely available.\n\n443\n00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:39.960\nYou can download it on the Internet.\n\n444\n00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:43.710\nMicrosoft has their network\nmonitor that you can get as well.\n\n445\n00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:46.600\nI'm gonna choose the interface\nthat I wanna capture traffic on.\n\n446\n00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.120\nAnd I'll go ahead and start it up.\n\n447\n00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.140\nAnd then what I'll do is I will\ngo ahead and ping svr01, so\n\n448\n00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:56.710\nI have a couple ping\npackets going by there.\n\n449\n00:22:56.710 --> 00:23:00.700\nI'll fire up file explorer, and\nI'm gonna connect to that share again.\n\n450\n00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:04.920\nAnd I've turned off my IPSec policies for\nthis demo.\n\n451\n00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:09.470\nAnd I'm gonna open up that file there,\nand I can see some data in that file.\n\n452\n00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:11.310\nAll right.\nSo here we can see all the packets that\n\n453\n00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:12.010\nwere captured.\n\n454\n00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:15.960\nThis thing was grabbing all the data\nthat's traveling across the network.\n\n455\n00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:20.160\nThose ping packets that I sent out,\nthere's my different request and replies.\n\n456\n00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:25.360\nWe see the protocol, that ICMP,\nmy Internet Control Message Protocol.\n\n457\n00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:29.105\nWe scroll down a little bit further, we're\ngonna start seeing those SMB packets.\n\n458\n00:23:29.105 --> 00:23:31.820\nThat's those server message block packets.\n\n459\n00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:35.973\nThis is where I connected to that\nfile share and copied that file over.\n\n460\n00:23:35.973 --> 00:23:40.370\nAnd if we want to take a look,\nwe scroll down far enough here,\n\n461\n00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:43.490\nwe are gonna find my Read response packet.\n\n462\n00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:46.720\nThis is me double clicking on that file.\n\n463\n00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:50.500\nThat was my read request,\nand then the read response,\n\n464\n00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:54.850\nyou see the request was from\nme to the server, 75 to 101.\n\n465\n00:23:54.850 --> 00:24:00.030\nAnd then the response,iIs from 101,\nthe server back to me.\n\n466\n00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:01.340\nAnd there's the data.\n\n467\n00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:05.830\nThat is the actual information\nthat's in that file, right?\n\n468\n00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:08.410\nHere are the sales numbers for\nthe quarter.\n\n469\n00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:14.330\nI go take a look at that file real quick,\nconnect back over there, and open that up.\n\n470\n00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:19.490\nYep, there's that data, so the point\nof this is, anybody with a packet\n\n471\n00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:23.620\ncapture utility, they can see those files\nthat are being transmitted back across.\n\n472\n00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:27.710\nYou just opening a file up on a share,\nit has to transmit that data to you, so\n\n473\n00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.390\nyou can see it on your screen, right?\n\n474\n00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:32.100\nThey can capture it,\nthey can read it as well.\n\n475\n00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:36.880\nThis is why tunneling and using encryption\nand things like that are so important.\n\n476\n00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.880\nWe want to make sure we're protecting\nthat data while it's at rest.\n\n477\n00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.538\nThat's things like EFS,\nmy encrypting file system.\n\n478\n00:24:42.538 --> 00:24:45.635\nWe also wanna make sure we're protecting\nthat data while it's in motion,\n\n479\n00:24:45.635 --> 00:24:47.950\nas it's traveling across the network.\n\n480\n00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:52.550\nThis is using things like IPsec tunneling,\nor any of our other tunneling protocols.\n\n481\n00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:53.940\nSo very, very important.\n\n482\n00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:57.960\nThose packet capture utilities, great to\nuse to study, really good to see what's\n\n483\n00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.789\ngoing on in your network,\ngreat to do your protocol analysis.\n\n484\n00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:04.140\nBut also very dangerous\nin the wrong hands.\n\n485\n00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:05.858\n>> Obviously the internet\nis a scary place.\n\n486\n00:25:05.858 --> 00:25:07.190\n[LAUGH] Right,\n\n487\n00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:11.800\nthese networks you have to take every\nmeasure you can to secure them up.\n\n488\n00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.150\nBecause if that file that Mike\nwas looking at was, I don't know,\n\n489\n00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:18.802\nmaybe the secret formula to your\nfavorite recipe of chicken, right?\n\n490\n00:25:18.802 --> 00:25:20.860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So think of it like this,\n\n491\n00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:21.900\nthat costs money, right?\n\n492\n00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:25.690\nThat is a secret to their business,\nand if it gets out,\n\n493\n00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:29.230\nwell then everybody's got it and\nit's no longer as valuable as it once was.\n\n494\n00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:30.640\nMaybe it's a list of credit card numbers.\n\n495\n00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.230\nMaybe it's a list of account numbers.\n\n496\n00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:33.720\nWho knows what it can be?\n\n497\n00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:37.830\nSo taking some of these steps, using\nsome of these methodologies that we've\n\n498\n00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:41.300\nshown you today is what it's gonna take\nto make sure that stuff is safe and\n\n499\n00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:44.520\nsecure, and\nyou can peruse with confidence.\n\n500\n00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:47.210\n>> Yeah, and\neven not just from the outside.\n\n501\n00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:49.810\nObviously, very important,\nbut think about internally.\n\n502\n00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:53.620\nI've got employees that should have\naccess to those credit card numbers.\n\n503\n00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:57.010\nI've got some employees that\nshouldn't have access to that, right?\n\n504\n00:25:57.010 --> 00:26:00.040\nWell, if I'm not encrypting that data,\nI think, oh, it's inside my network.\n\n505\n00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.400\nEverything's safe,\nI don't have to worry about it.\n\n506\n00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.380\nWell, what if that employee decides\nto fire up Wire Shark, right?\n\n507\n00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:07.670\nI've got to find ways\nto protect that data.\n\n508\n00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:10.340\nOr a vendor comes in, and he says, hey,\n\n509\n00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:15.260\nyou mind if I connect to your network real\nquick, cuz I gotta go check my email.\n\n510\n00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:18.400\nWhat if he's firing up a packet\ncapture utility and capturing data and\n\n511\n00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:23.120\nyou've got employees that are transmitting\nsensitive information across the network,\n\n512\n00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:26.760\nassuming everything's safe because\nwe're inside our network, right?\n\n513\n00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:31.150\nThis is why you've got to make sure\nthat you're protecting that information.\n\n514\n00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:31.950\n>> That's right.\n\n515\n00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:34.810\nWell Mike, thanks for\nshowing us how we can protect those,\n\n516\n00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:36.450\nnow we have a few measures\nthat we can take.\n\n517\n00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:39.250\nIs there anything else that\nwe could cover for this show?\n\n518\n00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:40.190\n>> I think we're good to go.\n\n519\n00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:42.177\n>> All right.\nWell hopefully you guys got a lot out of\n\n520\n00:26:42.177 --> 00:26:45.889\nthat, obviously security is a wonderful\ntopic, it's a lot of fun to explore as for\n\n521\n00:26:45.889 --> 00:26:48.661\nthis episode though we're going\nto go ahead and call it a day.\n\n522\n00:26:48.661 --> 00:26:51.905\nSigning off for\nITProTV I've ben your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n523\n00:26:51.905 --> 00:26:52.700\n>> And I am Mike Roderick.\n\n524\n00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:54.448\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n525\n00:26:54.448 --> 00:27:00.330\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.240\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.170\nJoining me yet again in the studio today\nis none other than Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.140\nHow's it going there, Mikey?\n\n6\n00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.520\n>> Oh, it's going great, Daniel.\n\n7\n00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.520\nI'm excited as always.\n\n8\n00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.660\nWe've got our MTA content coming your way\nand we're doing our security fundamentals.\n\n9\n00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.420\nAnd in this one,\n\n10\n00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.760\nwe're gonna take a look at keeping\nour clients and our servers secure.\n\n11\n00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.600\nMaking sure we keep them protected\nfrom all those bad things that\n\n12\n00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.020\nare destined to happen to us if we don't.\n\n13\n00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.500\n>> No, I'm sure this security\nthing's just a big old fad.\n\n14\n00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.020\nIt'll never catch on, so all this stuff\nwill be irrelevant in the next two or\n\n15\n00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.990\nthree hours.\n\n16\n00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.995\nOh wait, that's not this, [LAUGH] this is\nthe probably the most relevant thing that\n\n17\n00:00:49.995 --> 00:00:52.885\nnever goes away is that of security.\n\n18\n00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:54.822\nAnd when it comes basically down to it,\n\n19\n00:00:54.822 --> 00:00:58.181\nyou've got two types of devices\nthat you need to secure up, right?\n\n20\n00:00:58.181 --> 00:01:00.910\nThat's gonna be your clients and\nthat's gonna be your servers.\n\n21\n00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.030\nAnd each of them have their own specific\nway in which you need to approach\n\n22\n00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.240\nsecuring that device up.\n\n23\n00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.170\nAnd Mike,\nthat's what we're gonna talk about today.\n\n24\n00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.170\nI mean, we've got a lot of cool\nexplanations for us lined up.\n\n25\n00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.472\n>> I think they're cool\n[LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n\n26\n00:01:14.472 --> 00:01:15.928\n>> I enjoyed what I saw [LAUGH] and so\n\n27\n00:01:15.928 --> 00:01:19.800\nlet's hope these good people enjoy it as\nwell, where do we gonna start with this?\n\n28\n00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.311\n>> Well we're gonna start\nwith the [INAUDIBLE],\n\n29\n00:01:21.311 --> 00:01:22.749\nwe're gonna start if I can start talking.\n\n30\n00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:26.719\n>> It's live TV here so- [LAUGH]\n>> We're gonna start with the client ends\n\n31\n00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.046\nof things, and each one of these,\nwe're gonna kinda,\n\n32\n00:01:29.046 --> 00:01:31.090\nwe're doing that 30,000 foot overview.\n\n33\n00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.140\nWe're talking about major concepts or\n\n34\n00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.000\nbig concepts that we can use\nto keep that client secure.\n\n35\n00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.410\nKeep that server secure, most of these\nwill be broken down in more detail\n\n36\n00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.540\nin other episodes, so\nmake sure you check those out.\n\n37\n00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.380\nSo, but as Daniel said, when we look at\nour networks, we've got our clients, and\n\n38\n00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.400\nwe've got our servers.\n\n39\n00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.630\nOur clients are what we sit at everyday,\nthat we use,\n\n40\n00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.110\nwe run applications,\nwe connect to all kinds of resources.\n\n41\n00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.370\nWe reach out to the Internet\nto untrusted networks,\n\n42\n00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.240\nwe do all kinds of funky things on those.\n\n43\n00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.230\nSo, we've got one level of protection\nwe've got to apply to them.\n\n44\n00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.990\nServers, typically we're\nnot surfing the Internet,\n\n45\n00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.650\nwe're not browsing different\nsites from our servers.\n\n46\n00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.650\nBut our servers can be exposed,\ndepending what they're serving up, right?\n\n47\n00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.870\nIf they're internal servers, they've\ngot lots of clients attaching to them.\n\n48\n00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.980\nIf they're external, if they're front or\nweb phase, or not web, but\n\n49\n00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:22.913\nInternet phasing.\n\n50\n00:02:22.913 --> 00:02:26.280\nNow they've got some level of\nanonymous access coming in,\n\n51\n00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.630\nor little bit less security to allow,\nI shouldn't say less security.\n\n52\n00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.080\nWe've got to open them up to\nunauthenticated users potentially,\n\n53\n00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.030\nlike a website.\n\n54\n00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.322\nI can't authenticate everybody\nthat comes into my website.\n\n55\n00:02:40.322 --> 00:02:41.257\nThey don't have accounts yet.\n\n56\n00:02:41.257 --> 00:02:42.660\nThey haven't bought product yet.\n\n57\n00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.140\nSo I've got to allow those\ntypes of connections, but\n\n58\n00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.760\nI can still secure the server.\n\n59\n00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.990\nSo that's really what we're\ngonna talk about here.\n\n60\n00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.290\nAnd starting with that client,\none of our main things that we've\n\n61\n00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.550\ngotta do on these clients\nis run antivirus software.\n\n62\n00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.040\nI mean it's just a, it's a must.\n\n63\n00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.040\nI remember years ago,\n\n64\n00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.260\nDaniel, I would tell people that you\nreally should run antivirus software.\n\n65\n00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.810\nPersonally, I don't,\nbecause I have good safe practices.\n\n66\n00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.175\nI don't go to sites that I don't trust,\nI don't click on links in emails.\n\n67\n00:03:10.175 --> 00:03:13.230\nI trust people when I download something,\nI trust them.\n\n68\n00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.600\nAnd I really don't need to run\nan antivirus and I've been fine.\n\n69\n00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.060\nBut I wouldn't recommend that\nto anybody because you've gotta\n\n70\n00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.960\nhave some really good practices and\nyou've gotta stick to them.\n\n71\n00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.730\nNowadays, that is not the case.\n\n72\n00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.580\nSo then you do not wanna run\nwithout antivirus software.\n\n73\n00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.330\nThere's too many things, too many ways\nthese bad guys can get into your system,\n\n74\n00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.130\nget things onto your system,\ninfect your machine.\n\n75\n00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.000\nThere's drive-bys where you just open\nup a website and all of a sudden,\n\n76\n00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.561\nit used to be you had to click on\nsomething to really get it started.\n\n77\n00:03:42.561 --> 00:03:46.190\nNow just opening up a website or a certain\nbanner ad can load things onto your\n\n78\n00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.220\ncomputer and start all kinds of trouble.\n\n79\n00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.760\nSo antivirus software is a must,\n\n80\n00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.670\nyou've gotta run this and\nwe've gotta keep it up to date.\n\n81\n00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.460\nOut of date antivirus software isn't much\nbetter than no antivirus software at all\n\n82\n00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.740\nbecause new viruses are being\ndetected every day.\n\n83\n00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.722\nNew updates for your antivirus\nsoftware is being put out every day.\n\n84\n00:04:06.722 --> 00:04:09.131\nAnd when I say updates,\nI mean new definitions, so\n\n85\n00:04:09.131 --> 00:04:12.213\nthat our antivirus will recognize\nthe latest types of attacks and\n\n86\n00:04:12.213 --> 00:04:15.580\nthe latest malware that these\nbad guys are putting out there.\n\n87\n00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.880\nSo you got to keep it up to date.\n\n88\n00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.773\nIf you're updating it once a week,\nthat's not enough.\n\n89\n00:04:19.773 --> 00:04:22.290\nNow twice a week, not enough.\n\n90\n00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.280\nOnce a day is probably\nwhere you should start.\n\n91\n00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.182\n[LAUGH] And I know Daniel, you mentioned\nin some corporate environments you were\n\n92\n00:04:28.182 --> 00:04:29.146\nin, more than once a day.\n\n93\n00:04:29.146 --> 00:04:30.370\n>> Oh yeah, totally.\n\n94\n00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.050\nEvery time that they would release\nan update, we would take it,\n\n95\n00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.330\nbecause when you have that many\ncomputers on your network.\n\n96\n00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.120\nWell, what happens to your security\nfootprint becomes a whole lot larger.\n\n97\n00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.490\nYou have a larger attack surface in which\nfor the bad guys to go after, right?\n\n98\n00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.970\nYou become a bigger target.\n\n99\n00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.010\nSo that being said, you have to\ntake every precaution possible,\n\n100\n00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.300\nyou have to take every proactive\nmeasure that you can to\n\n101\n00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.110\nbasically mitigate that down to become\nas small of a target as you can.\n\n102\n00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.870\nYou're always fighting that attack\nsurface area, and trying to bring it down\n\n103\n00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.270\nto as small as possible and one of the\nways you can do that is just through this.\n\n104\n00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.590\nMaking sure those antiviruses installed\non all of your clan operating systems,\n\n105\n00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:12.870\nit does not matter what it is.\n\n106\n00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.940\nIf it is attached to your network,\nhas antivirus running, and\n\n107\n00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.240\nit is current with the latest definition,\nso if they come out with something new,\n\n108\n00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.060\nit is getting downloaded,\nit is getting installed.\n\n109\n00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.530\nNow you stagger that out because\nyou wanna have a large network.\n\n110\n00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:25.100\n>> Right.\n>> But\n\n111\n00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.850\nother than that,\nit is get it as soon as possible.\n\n112\n00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.280\n>> And you made a great point in there,\nDaniel, that it is making sure that all of\n\n113\n00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.700\nthem are running antivirus and up to date,\nbecause it just takes one, all right.\n\n114\n00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.750\nI was dealing with a help desk the other\nday, they called me up for some advice.\n\n115\n00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.840\nAnd they had a machine,\n\n116\n00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.660\nwell it was a remote side that they\nwere supporting, and these people had,\n\n117\n00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.180\nthe machine was having trouble connecting\nback to the corporate network.\n\n118\n00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.220\nSo it wasn't getting its definition\nupdates in a timely fashion for\n\n119\n00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.980\ntheir antivirus, and\ndecided they weren't worried about it.\n\n120\n00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:59.100\nIt was a month gone by until they\nbother to tell anybody about it,\n\n121\n00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.620\nand is that a bad thing?\n\n122\n00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.050\nAbsolutely, because that means\nif they're using this machine,\n\n123\n00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.350\nthey could still use it to connect to\nlocal resources and things like that.\n\n124\n00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.850\nIt wasn't reaching out and\ngetting its updates.\n\n125\n00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.710\nIt just takes one machine to be\nvulnerable to that virus, or\n\n126\n00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.520\nwhatever that malware is,\nto get it inside the network.\n\n127\n00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.180\nAnd from there, it can really start\nto spread, or open up a back door and\n\n128\n00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.000\nallow other types of\nattacks to come through.\n\n129\n00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.920\nSo, we've gotta make sure that all of\nthose machines are getting those updates.\n\n130\n00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.060\nAnd that goes along with the operating\nsystem, as well as software, right.\n\n131\n00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.076\nWe've gotta get those updates,\nnot just antivirus.\n\n132\n00:06:31.076 --> 00:06:32.610\nAntivirus has to be updated.\n\n133\n00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.396\nOur operating system, it gets updates.\n\n134\n00:06:34.396 --> 00:06:37.910\nWe know, like in Windows, we go out\nto a Microsoft update services or\n\n135\n00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.100\nwe run update services locally using WSUS.\n\n136\n00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.410\nBut we've gotta keep\nthose updates applied.\n\n137\n00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.540\nBecause, same concept,\nthese are known vulnerabilities.\n\n138\n00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.450\nSomebody's figured out a weakness in our\noperating system, and the bad guys are out\n\n139\n00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:56.430\nthere trying to write malware that's gonna\ntake advantage of those vulnerabilities.\n\n140\n00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.580\nMicrosoft finds the vulnerabilities,\nthey put out patches.\n\n141\n00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.130\nThey say, here, download this, install it.\n\n142\n00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.616\nYou'll no longer be vulnerable\nto that issue, right.\n\n143\n00:07:05.616 --> 00:07:09.790\nWell, if I don't download it, don't\ninstall it, right, it's my own fault.\n\n144\n00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.710\nI'm sitting here, there's a patch for\nsomething and I don't have it.\n\n145\n00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.570\nSo I've got to keep that up to date.\n\n146\n00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:18.630\nApplications that we run on top of\nthe operating system, just important.\n\n147\n00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:23.330\nWord, Office products, Adobe,\nthings like that, Java,\n\n148\n00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.920\nthe services that we run,\nthose all have to be kept up to date.\n\n149\n00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:31.450\nSo if we're not checking it automatically,\nwe need to have some method in place to\n\n150\n00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:34.630\nwhere we are, then ensuring that\nwe get the latest updates out.\n\n151\n00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.510\nWe probably have a way to test them\nbefore we roll them out to the rest of\n\n152\n00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.880\nthe network like WSUS\nwith our Windows updates.\n\n153\n00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.263\nWe gotta get them, we gotta test them,\nwe gotta see if they're what we need and\n\n154\n00:07:44.263 --> 00:07:45.866\nthen, we gotta get them pushed out.\n\n155\n00:07:45.866 --> 00:07:49.097\nOther ways we can keep our clients safe,\nUser Account Control.\n\n156\n00:07:49.097 --> 00:07:52.831\nI know we've dealt with that before and\nwe'll talk about it in other episodes.\n\n157\n00:07:52.831 --> 00:07:54.917\nBut remember What UAC is.\n\n158\n00:07:54.917 --> 00:07:56.878\nUAC, user account control,\n\n159\n00:07:56.878 --> 00:08:01.437\nis a way to make sure we're running\nour system with least privilege.\n\n160\n00:08:01.437 --> 00:08:05.305\nIf I log on as an administrator,\nI get a standard user token.\n\n161\n00:08:05.305 --> 00:08:07.575\nEven though I've got\nan administrative account,\n\n162\n00:08:07.575 --> 00:08:09.750\nI'm gonna get a standard user token.\n\n163\n00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.900\nAnd everything I do is gonna\nrun as a standard user.\n\n164\n00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.741\nNow, if I try to do something that\nrequires administrative credentials,\n\n165\n00:08:15.741 --> 00:08:17.150\nit's gonna give me a little prompt.\n\n166\n00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:20.710\nIt's gonna say, click yes or\nno, did you mean to do this?\n\n167\n00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:24.310\nYes, I'll go ahead and\nescalate your credentials temporarily for\n\n168\n00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:28.541\nthis one task to have administrative\naccess, or no, I didn't mean to do that,\n\n169\n00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:30.641\ncancel it and don't run that process.\n\n170\n00:08:30.641 --> 00:08:34.710\nIf I log on as a standard user,\nI also get a standard user token.\n\n171\n00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:37.006\nBut now it can't just escalate\nmy credentials, right?\n\n172\n00:08:37.006 --> 00:08:39.200\nBecause I'm not logged\non as administrator.\n\n173\n00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.061\nSo when I try to do something that\nrequires administrative access,\n\n174\n00:08:42.061 --> 00:08:44.232\nit's gonna give me\nan authentication dialog box.\n\n175\n00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:47.410\nHey if you wanna run this,\nyou need to have administrative access.\n\n176\n00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:51.233\nType in the username and\npassword of an administrative account and\n\n177\n00:08:51.233 --> 00:08:54.246\nI'll let you run this one\ntask as an administrator.\n\n178\n00:08:54.246 --> 00:08:57.130\nBut if not, you don't get to run it.\n\n179\n00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:00.233\nSo that way, even if you log on\nas an administrative account,\n\n180\n00:09:00.233 --> 00:09:02.870\nmost things are running\nwith standard user access.\n\n181\n00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:06.350\nAnd that's a good thing, because I\ndon't log in on as an administrator and\n\n182\n00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:08.839\neverything I'm doing has\nadministrative access and\n\n183\n00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:11.120\nI am surfing the internet and\nclicking on links.\n\n184\n00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.515\nIf I click on something\nthat has malware in it,\n\n185\n00:09:14.515 --> 00:09:17.629\nit potentially runs as an administrator\nnow and I don't need that.\n\n186\n00:09:17.629 --> 00:09:21.010\nSo ,the UAC designed to keep you safe.\n\n187\n00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:22.940\nHelping us really follow a best practice.\n\n188\n00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:27.872\nMicrosoft for years has said don't log\non as an administrator all the time.\n\n189\n00:09:27.872 --> 00:09:32.032\nLog on as a standard user have a second\naccount that you can do your good old run\n\n190\n00:09:32.032 --> 00:09:34.569\nas and\nprovide those alternate credentials.\n\n191\n00:09:34.569 --> 00:09:36.510\nWell now it does it for you, right?\n\n192\n00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.633\nIt just says,\nI'm gonna limit you to a standard user and\n\n193\n00:09:39.633 --> 00:09:43.229\nI'll escalate your credentials\nonly when needed, all right?\n\n194\n00:09:43.229 --> 00:09:47.075\nSo that's the good old UAC,\nUser Account Control Control.\n\n195\n00:09:47.075 --> 00:09:50.087\nWe've also got offline files to deal with.\n\n196\n00:09:50.087 --> 00:09:51.895\nRemember what offline files are?\n\n197\n00:09:51.895 --> 00:09:56.813\nIf we've got a shared folder out there,\nlet's say we're at work,\n\n198\n00:09:56.813 --> 00:10:02.500\nwe can connect to that shared folder and\nwe can access those resources.\n\n199\n00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.631\nWell what about when I go home.\n\n200\n00:10:03.631 --> 00:10:06.540\nI want to be able to work\nwith those resources as well.\n\n201\n00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:10.970\nI can cache a copy locally, I can pull\na copy of those down onto my system,\n\n202\n00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:12.860\nthey get stored locally.\n\n203\n00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.196\nNow when I go home I'm working\nwith this offline copy,\n\n204\n00:10:16.196 --> 00:10:18.166\nit's a cached temporary copy.\n\n205\n00:10:18.166 --> 00:10:19.976\nThen when I get back to work the next day,\n\n206\n00:10:19.976 --> 00:10:24.300\nthose changes will be synchronized with\nthe original and I'll be good to go.\n\n207\n00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.860\nWhat about those offline files though?\n\n208\n00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.400\nWhat about that cached copy?\n\n209\n00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.905\nThose are on my local machine,\nand I'm taking my laptop home.\n\n210\n00:10:30.905 --> 00:10:33.200\nWhat if I lose my laptop, right?\n\n211\n00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.077\nSomebody could steal that laptop and\n\n212\n00:10:35.077 --> 00:10:37.627\npotentially gain access\nto those cached copies.\n\n213\n00:10:37.627 --> 00:10:40.430\nSo we can encrypt offline files.\n\n214\n00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:43.691\nThat way if they do steal my machine,\nand try to get access to them,\n\n215\n00:10:43.691 --> 00:10:45.220\nthey're gonna be encrypted.\n\n216\n00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.910\nNow I can show you how to do that.\n\n217\n00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:48.715\nI've got a shared folder over here.\n\n218\n00:10:48.715 --> 00:10:49.724\nFrom my client,\n\n219\n00:10:49.724 --> 00:10:54.670\nI'm gonna connect to backslash\nbackslash server one backslash data.\n\n220\n00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:57.313\nAnd we can see here there's\na couple files in there and\n\n221\n00:10:57.313 --> 00:10:59.560\nwhat I could do is I could\nright click on this.\n\n222\n00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:03.075\nAnd depending on how your admin has\nthis set up, it might be automatic, or\n\n223\n00:11:03.075 --> 00:11:05.514\neverything you open is\nmade available offline, or\n\n224\n00:11:05.514 --> 00:11:09.031\nyou might have to specify which items\nyou want to make available offline,\n\n225\n00:11:09.031 --> 00:11:10.760\nwhich is what I've got set up here.\n\n226\n00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.280\nI'm gonna say always available offline.\n\n227\n00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.089\nSo it's gonna sync a copy of that\nfile down to my local machine, and\n\n228\n00:11:17.089 --> 00:11:20.980\nnow I can see that little sync center,\nactive sync icon.\n\n229\n00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:27.140\nSo now if I disconnect my network,\nlet's turn that bad boy off for a second.\n\n230\n00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:33.263\nPretend like I've unplugged\nfrom the network and gone home.\n\n231\n00:11:33.263 --> 00:11:34.952\nNotice the other file disappeared.\n\n232\n00:11:34.952 --> 00:11:38.455\nQuarter two is gone, because I'm no\nlonger connected to that share, but\n\n233\n00:11:38.455 --> 00:11:41.460\nquarter one is still here because\nI made it available offline.\n\n234\n00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:42.530\nI can double-click on it.\n\n235\n00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:46.734\nIt doesn't look like it wants me to,\noh, nice,\n\n236\n00:11:46.734 --> 00:11:50.439\nmaybe I can save and close it, we'll see.\n\n237\n00:11:50.439 --> 00:11:55.466\nI have to give it another name, there.\n\n238\n00:11:57.605 --> 00:12:01.110\nIt was trying to reach out and put it in\nthe share that's not available right now.\n\n239\n00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:04.351\nSo once I had made those changes I\ngo back into work the next day and\n\n240\n00:12:04.351 --> 00:12:06.286\nthey'll synchronize back up there.\n\n241\n00:12:06.286 --> 00:12:08.880\nAnd again,\nit's that temporary copy that gets made.\n\n242\n00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.985\nThat's cached locally on my machine,\nthat I'm worried about.\n\n243\n00:12:11.985 --> 00:12:16.551\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nreconnect to the network here first,\n\n244\n00:12:16.551 --> 00:12:19.230\njust because I like to be connected.\n\n245\n00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:25.998\nAnd what you would want to do is\nyou'd open up your control panel,\n\n246\n00:12:25.998 --> 00:12:29.463\nand it's actually in the Sync Center.\n\n247\n00:12:29.463 --> 00:12:31.940\nAnd down here I've got\nmanage offline files.\n\n248\n00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:39.823\nAnd over here I've got my encryption tab,\nand I can choose to encrypt offline files.\n\n249\n00:12:39.823 --> 00:12:41.430\nSo all that's gonna do.\n\n250\n00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:44.907\nIt actually stores them in a hidden\nlocation on your hard drive, but\n\n251\n00:12:44.907 --> 00:12:46.803\nnow they're going to be encrypted.\n\n252\n00:12:46.803 --> 00:12:50.317\nSo if somebody was able to try to find\nthose, or was able to steal my laptop, and\n\n253\n00:12:50.317 --> 00:12:53.640\ntry to search for those offline files,\ncause people know where they are.\n\n254\n00:12:56.090 --> 00:13:00.730\nCRC I think is the same of the folder,\nbut you can figure out where that is, and\n\n255\n00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:02.040\nsomebody could try to browse to there.\n\n256\n00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.510\nSo, encrypting those keeps it safe.\n\n257\n00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:06.140\nVery important on those mobile devices.\n\n258\n00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.941\n>> Probably a quick Google\nsearch would take you right to,\n\n259\n00:13:08.941 --> 00:13:10.917\nwhere are those offline files stored?\n\n260\n00:13:10.917 --> 00:13:12.300\nWhere is that hidden location?\n\n261\n00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.311\nTell you exactly where to go and how to\nget there, and then all you have to do is\n\n262\n00:13:15.311 --> 00:13:18.438\nget your hands on that stinking laptop or\nthat mobile device or whatever it is.\n\n263\n00:13:18.438 --> 00:13:23.380\nAnd oh, now I have these lovely business\nfiles that this young person has so\n\n264\n00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:27.520\neloquently left out for\nme to steal and enjoy for myself.\n\n265\n00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.706\nNot what we wanna do so\nanytime you can get away with encryption,\n\n266\n00:13:30.706 --> 00:13:32.717\nyou definitely wanna go down that road.\n\n267\n00:13:32.717 --> 00:13:36.496\nIt's not as difficult as, I know a lot\nof people hear the word encryption and\n\n268\n00:13:36.496 --> 00:13:37.569\nyou're like [SOUND].\n\n269\n00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:41.543\nYeah, that sounds difficult well it's not,\n\n270\n00:13:41.543 --> 00:13:43.320\nI mean Mike, you hit a button\n>> Yeah.\n\n271\n00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.372\n>> And said encrypt these files and\nnow you're encrypted.\n\n272\n00:13:46.372 --> 00:13:48.072\n>> The computer takes\ncare of everything right?\n\n273\n00:13:48.072 --> 00:13:49.765\nSo and that's the whole point,\n\n274\n00:13:49.765 --> 00:13:53.640\nif somebody steals that laptop\nthose files are protected.\n\n275\n00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:57.142\nOther things we can do on the client\nside of things although not really from\n\n276\n00:13:57.142 --> 00:13:59.698\nthe client would be software\nrestriction policies.\n\n277\n00:13:59.698 --> 00:14:03.634\nThese are things that admin can set up\nusing group policy at the server level and\n\n278\n00:14:03.634 --> 00:14:06.200\napply those settings out\nto the client machines and\n\n279\n00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.664\ncontrol which applications\nare allowed to run.\n\n280\n00:14:08.664 --> 00:14:12.570\nSo if I've got applications that\nI know have vulnerabilities, or\n\n281\n00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:17.172\ndo not want run on my work computers,\nI can create a policy that says you're not\n\n282\n00:14:17.172 --> 00:14:19.920\nallowed to install iTunes\non these machines.\n\n283\n00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.506\nOr you're not allowed to play World\nof Warcraft on these work computers.\n\n284\n00:14:23.506 --> 00:14:27.390\nYou can create those software\nrestriction policies to prevent that.\n\n285\n00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.898\nThen if we move over to\nthe server side of things,\n\n286\n00:14:30.898 --> 00:14:35.090\nwe've gotta make sure sure those guys are\nsecured as well, gotta apply protection.\n\n287\n00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:39.720\nAnd this is a term, we'll hear\nthe term hardening your servers,\n\n288\n00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:45.820\nbasically applying good best practices\nto try to secure those servers.\n\n289\n00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:49.810\nFirst thing we wanna think about is\nsimply separation of services okay?\n\n290\n00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:52.372\nDifferent services have\ndifferent levels of access and\n\n291\n00:14:52.372 --> 00:14:55.240\ndifferent levels of security\nassociated with them.\n\n292\n00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:59.334\nAnd we wanna make sure that we're not\ncombining those on the same server.\n\n293\n00:14:59.334 --> 00:15:00.690\nI mean, don't get me wrong.\n\n294\n00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:02.946\nWe're not setting up\na separate physical server for\n\n295\n00:15:02.946 --> 00:15:04.851\nevery single service that we're running.\n\n296\n00:15:04.851 --> 00:15:07.499\nBut we should use a little common sense.\n\n297\n00:15:07.499 --> 00:15:09.260\nMy domain controllers, for example.\n\n298\n00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.404\nThey're in charge of security for\nmy network.\n\n299\n00:15:11.404 --> 00:15:14.824\nThey host all of the user accounts,\nand computer accounts,\n\n300\n00:15:14.824 --> 00:15:17.450\nit's where password verification, right?\n\n301\n00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:22.863\nThey're running Cerberus and LDAP,\nso high level of security there.\n\n302\n00:15:22.863 --> 00:15:25.418\nMy website that I want\nto sell my product from,\n\n303\n00:15:25.418 --> 00:15:29.040\nthe public can access that from\nthe outside, from the Internet.\n\n304\n00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.408\nIt's got port 80 wide open.\n\n305\n00:15:31.408 --> 00:15:33.173\nSo, not the same levels of security.\n\n306\n00:15:33.173 --> 00:15:38.005\nI would not want to run IIS on\nmy domain controller right?\n\n307\n00:15:38.005 --> 00:15:39.465\nThose are the kinds of\nthings we wanna think about.\n\n308\n00:15:39.465 --> 00:15:42.870\nWhen we talk about separation of\nservices is group your services.\n\n309\n00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:46.584\nIf you can combine services to\nuse that server efficiently But,\n\n310\n00:15:46.584 --> 00:15:51.744\nthink about what level of access, and what\nsecurity requirements those services have,\n\n311\n00:15:51.744 --> 00:15:55.330\nand try to put ones that\nare similar on the same server.\n\n312\n00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:58.130\nDon't start taking stuff that's\navailable to the public, and\n\n313\n00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:01.980\nputting it on servers that should\nonly be accessed from the inside.\n\n314\n00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:05.390\nIt's gonna make it much more\ndifficult to keep secure.\n\n315\n00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:06.950\nSo separate out your services.\n\n316\n00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:11.800\nAs I said, hardening is really just\nthe process of following best practices,\n\n317\n00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:15.440\ngoing through and\nchanging your default settings, right.\n\n318\n00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.870\nThat's the first thing we do.\n\n319\n00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:20.220\nWe're gonna disable any\nunnecessary services.\n\n320\n00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:24.740\nIf I'm not running an FTP site, I don't\nneed the FTP server service running in\n\n321\n00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:28.620\nthe background, because I'm not monitoring\nit, I'm not patching it, it's just\n\n322\n00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:32.610\na vulnerability sitting there waiting for\nsomebody to take advantage of it.\n\n323\n00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:34.790\nSo if you don't need the service,\ndon't run it.\n\n324\n00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:35.980\nLike on a web browser.\n\n325\n00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:39.570\nIf you're not planning to use\nInternet Printing Protocol or IPP.\n\n326\n00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:40.590\nTurn that off.\n\n327\n00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:41.160\nDisable it.\n\n328\n00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.990\nThere's lots of vulnerabilities\nassociated with it.\n\n329\n00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:45.220\nIf you need it, okay.\n\n330\n00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.610\nYou're gonna have to patch it up and\nmake sure you protect it.\n\n331\n00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:50.160\nBut if you don't need it,\njust turn it off.\n\n332\n00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.270\nSo reducing that, as Daniel used\nthat term, that attack surface.\n\n333\n00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:59.010\nThe more services I can eliminate,\nthe smaller attack surface I have.\n\n334\n00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:03.090\nSo again, hardening means changing\nyour default settings and\n\n335\n00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:10.140\nremoving any unnecessary services,\nand applying all of your patches.\n\n336\n00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.120\nJust like we talked about with the client.\n\n337\n00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:15.660\nMy server operating system gets updates so\nI have to go out to Windows and\n\n338\n00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:20.100\nmake sure that I'm getting those\nupdates or from local WS US server.\n\n339\n00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:24.060\nAnd if I've got applications running\non there I've got to get those updates.\n\n340\n00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:29.160\nEvery time I install a new roll, the first\nthing I should do is go check for updates.\n\n341\n00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.540\nBecause it only gets updates for\nwhat you need,\n\n342\n00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:33.070\nwhat it sees running on that machine.\n\n343\n00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:37.600\nAnd you didn't have DHTP running last\ntime, it didn't bother looking for\n\n344\n00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.320\nany updates for DHTP.\n\n345\n00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.120\nNow you've installed DHTP.\n\n346\n00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.500\nNeed to go and check to see if there's\nany updates for that service so\n\n347\n00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.470\nthat you can apply those accordingly.\n\n348\n00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:50.230\nSo keeping it updated,\nboth the operating system and\n\n349\n00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:54.040\nthe applications that are running on\nthere, anti-virus software if you're\n\n350\n00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:59.370\nrunning that on your servers,\nyou've got to keep that updated as well.\n\n351\n00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:04.430\nAnother thing we can do Daniel is secure\ndynamic updates for good old DNS.\n\n352\n00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:07.052\nDNS being a protocol that\nwe're going to be running,\n\n353\n00:18:07.052 --> 00:18:11.208\nall right that's our domain name system,\nthat's how we resolve names.\n\n354\n00:18:11.208 --> 00:18:14.100\nIn other episodes we've talked about some\nof the different types of attacks that\n\n355\n00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.110\nDNS can be vulnerable to.\n\n356\n00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:22.440\nDNS spoofing and things like that where\nsomebody tries to intercept the responses\n\n357\n00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:28.260\nand provides you with a, point you\ntowards malicious sites, for example.\n\n358\n00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:32.290\nWell part of that is gonna involve them\ngetting in and creating new records.\n\n359\n00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:34.210\nDepending on what attack\nthey're trying to do.\n\n360\n00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:40.520\nWith secure dynamic updates we can go\nto our DNS zone and we can only allow\n\n361\n00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:45.220\nsecure dynamic updates if it's active\ndirectory integrated, we can do this.\n\n362\n00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:48.670\nAnd what that means is there's\nonly authenticated computers.\n\n363\n00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:50.890\nBy default, authenticated users or\n\n364\n00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:53.880\ncomputers will be allowed\nto create new records.\n\n365\n00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.630\nSo that means if Daniel comes and\nvisits, let's say Daniel\n\n366\n00:18:56.630 --> 00:19:01.150\ncame over here to my shop and tried to\nplug his laptop in, his laptop would\n\n367\n00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:06.520\nnot be able to create a record in DNS\nif he's not an authenticated user.\n\n368\n00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:10.230\nAll those vendors that come by, the\npasser-bys outside, the bad guys sitting\n\n369\n00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:14.070\nin their creepy van trying to attack your\nnetwork, he can't create new records.\n\n370\n00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.320\nBecause his machine is not authenticated.\n\n371\n00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.530\nAnd you can take it further than that,\n\n372\n00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:22.720\nin fact I can show you over here, I've got\na DNS server up and running I believe.\n\n373\n00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:29.700\nWe'll pop up DNS, now remember this is\nonly active directory integrated zones.\n\n374\n00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:34.110\nWhich means standard DNS zones\ndon't support this option.\n\n375\n00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:37.130\nHas to be stored in\nthe Active Directory database.\n\n376\n00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:39.780\nBut if I pull up\nthe properties of this zone,\n\n377\n00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:44.420\nall right, I can go to my Security tab.\n\n378\n00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:44.960\nWell first of all,\n\n379\n00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:48.840\nright here on the General, I can see I\nhave it set to secure only, which means it\n\n380\n00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:54.450\nwill not accept the dynamic update, unless\nit's an authenticated user or computer.\n\n381\n00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:56.630\nI go to the security tab, I'll see why.\n\n382\n00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:00.330\nAuthenticated users have\ncreate child objects.\n\n383\n00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:02.520\nA computer is also an authenticated user.\n\n384\n00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:06.030\nA computer authenticates so\nit is part of that group.\n\n385\n00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:09.170\nLet's say I wanted to setup\nanother zone just for RND.\n\n386\n00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:13.260\nWell what I could do is make an active\ndirectory integrated zone, all right,\n\n387\n00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:17.440\nenable secure dynamic updates on it,\nremove authenticated users,\n\n388\n00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:22.000\ncreate a group that just contain\nthe computers from RND, and\n\n389\n00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.550\nthen add that group to this list and\ngive them Create Child Objects.\n\n390\n00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:29.850\nThat way only RND computers will\nbe allowed to make new records\n\n391\n00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:31.430\nin that RND zone.\n\n392\n00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:35.070\nSo we can control who's allowed\nto make those secure updates\n\n393\n00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:39.050\nusing the access control list itself,\nfor the zone file.\n\n394\n00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:42.530\n>> And Mike, is there any good reason\nnot to use this type of technology\n\n395\n00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:44.400\ninside of an Active Directory domain?\n\n396\n00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.570\n>> I can't think of one, honestly.\n\n397\n00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:46.990\nIt really is a best practice.\n\n398\n00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:51.090\nYou're gonna see that unless the zone\nis outside, like you've gotta have\n\n399\n00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:55.680\na DNS zone out in your DMZ to\nsupport public name resolution.\n\n400\n00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:57.930\nThat's not gonna be\nActive Directory integrated.\n\n401\n00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:00.800\nSo you are not going to be able to\nset that on that zone out there, but\n\n402\n00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.350\nthat is okay.\n\n403\n00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:05.100\nYou are probably not going to\nallow any updates except for\n\n404\n00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.420\nmanually created updates in that zone.\n\n405\n00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:10.370\nInternally you are going\nto see that 90 percent\n\n406\n00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:13.520\nof the zones nowadays are active\ndirectory integrated.\n\n407\n00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.010\nAnd you're going to set\nthat option secure only,\n\n408\n00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:19.390\nbecause not only does it help keep secure,\nit keeps the zone clean.\n\n409\n00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:22.400\nWe have vendors coming in and\nout of our business every day, and\n\n410\n00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.230\nas soon as their laptop connects to my\nnetwork, they get an IP address from DHCP,\n\n411\n00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:30.910\nand then the next thing their\nclient tries to do is update DNS.\n\n412\n00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:34.330\nAnd tell everybody hey here's my name,\nhere's my IP address,\n\n413\n00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:36.910\nif anybody's trying to\nfind me here you go.\n\n414\n00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:40.370\nWell, do my users need to be able to\nconnect to this vendors laptop, all right,\n\n415\n00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:41.900\nthere's no reason anybody\nshould be looking for\n\n416\n00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.090\nhis laptop,\nI don't need that record in there.\n\n417\n00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:47.050\nWhen he leaves that\nrecord is still in there.\n\n418\n00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:48.380\nAnd over time, that just makes more and\n\n419\n00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:51.750\nmore records that I have to worry about\ngetting out, makes replication bigger.\n\n420\n00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:55.280\nAnd there's other things that can help\nclean those up, aging and scavenging.\n\n421\n00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.200\nBut if I don't allow them to\nbe created in the first place,\n\n422\n00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.780\nI don't have anything to clean up.\n\n423\n00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:00.850\n>> Nothing to worry about, right?\n\n424\n00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:01.990\nIt's all done.\n\n425\n00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:04.010\nJust take care of it from\nthe very beginning and\n\n426\n00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:05.650\nthen you don't have to worry about it.\n\n427\n00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:08.510\n>> Yeah.\nPlus keep that nice lovely I don't\n\n428\n00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:09.630\nhave to touch it.\n\n429\n00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:14.050\nAll my active directory computers that\nI know and trust can create records.\n\n430\n00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:16.870\nI don't have to do all that\nadministration headache with DNS.\n\n431\n00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:22.040\nI can allow that dynamic system to work as\nnecessary, also keeping me safe, though.\n\n432\n00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.310\n>> Absolutely.\n\n433\n00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:26.960\nOther things we can do on our servers is,\nand especially our domain controllers,\n\n434\n00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.320\nor anywhere we're doing authentication,\n\n435\n00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:34.440\nremove any unsecure\nauthentication protocols, right?\n\n436\n00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.670\nWhen we use authentication,\n\n437\n00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:39.080\nwe're trying to verify the identity\nof someone or something,\n\n438\n00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.650\nwhich means they're gonna most likely be\nsending credentials across the network.\n\n439\n00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:47.620\nIf it's username and password, or whatever\nit is we're using for authentication.\n\n440\n00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:50.950\nI wanna use the best, the strongest\navailable authentication that I can,\n\n441\n00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:54.620\nand there are some older protocols\nthat are out there that they aren't so\n\n442\n00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:56.620\nstrong, so we want to eliminate those.\n\n443\n00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:58.890\nWe only want to use the latest and\ngreatest.\n\n444\n00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:04.480\nIt's like in a Windows environment,\nwe're talking about NTLM,\n\n445\n00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:08.350\nright, using Kerberos for\nauthentication methods.\n\n446\n00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:10.270\nWhat else?\n\n447\n00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:12.650\nRead only domain controllers\nis another thing.\n\n448\n00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:16.370\nDomain controllers, again, those\nare the ones that host Active Directory.\n\n449\n00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:20.730\nThat's that security database where\nall of my users accounts reside, and\n\n450\n00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:22.950\nthe passwords that are associated\nwith those accounts.\n\n451\n00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:27.760\nAnd you need to connect to the main\ncontroller in order to authenticate.\n\n452\n00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.463\nWell let's say we've got a branch office.\n\n453\n00:23:29.463 --> 00:23:34.292\nThat branch office out there in Bell,\nFlorida, I've got ten users out there and\n\n454\n00:23:34.292 --> 00:23:38.127\nwhen they go to log on, their traffic\nhas to go across the WAN link\n\n455\n00:23:38.127 --> 00:23:42.984\nhere to my office in Gainesville to be\nauthenticated by that domain controller.\n\n456\n00:23:42.984 --> 00:23:47.029\nAnd then the response sent back and\nif that WAN is slow or unreliable,\n\n457\n00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:51.773\nthat means those users out there at the\nbranch office sometimes can't log on or it\n\n458\n00:23:51.773 --> 00:23:57.030\ntakes forever to log on, very frustrating,\nand I get a lack of productivity.\n\n459\n00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:59.240\nOkay, great,\nwe'll put a domain controller out there.\n\n460\n00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.980\nWe can have more than\none domain controller,\n\n461\n00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.470\nwe should have more than\none domain controller.\n\n462\n00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:04.970\nSo, put one out there.\n\n463\n00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:07.500\nThe problem is,\nit's a little tiny branch office.\n\n464\n00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.590\nThere is no server closet, right?\n\n465\n00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:14.070\nSo, where do I put this server, so\nthat I have good physical security.\n\n466\n00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:15.740\nI can't put it under Bob's desk, right?\n\n467\n00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:17.360\nThat's probably not\ngonna work out too well.\n\n468\n00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.554\n>> In the bathroom.\n\n469\n00:24:18.554 --> 00:24:19.180\n>> [LAUGH] In the bathroom.\n\n470\n00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:21.630\n>> Which I've\n>> Seems, oddly enough [LAUGH]\n\n471\n00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:23.180\n>> Well, it's a strange place but\n\n472\n00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:24.250\nI have seen it as well.\n\n473\n00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:27.350\nIt is odd but yeah,\nI've got to find somewhere to.\n\n474\n00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:30.240\nRemember, physical security trumps\njust about everything else.\n\n475\n00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.750\nSo, I've gotta have that.\n\n476\n00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:33.160\nSo, where do I put this server out there?\n\n477\n00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:37.530\nI don't want somebody to just grab hard\ndrives and walk out with them and now have\n\n478\n00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:42.270\nmy active directory in and try to find\npasswords for my administrative accounts.\n\n479\n00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:44.160\nWho's going to administer\nthat server out there?\n\n480\n00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.490\nThere's no IT people out there.\n\n481\n00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:48.000\nWho's going to log on to it?\n\n482\n00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.810\nIt's probably the only server they have,\nso who's going to be able to log on to it\n\n483\n00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:57.430\nand install print drivers or\nyou know do whatever,\n\n484\n00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:01.380\ncreate shares because only domain\nadmin can log on to main control.\n\n485\n00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:04.030\nWell domain admin, account operators and\na couple of others but\n\n486\n00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:05.680\nnobody in the branch\noffice is any of those.\n\n487\n00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.669\nThey are just standard users.\n\n488\n00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:11.250\nSo, I'm not gonna make one of those people\nout there the main admin just so they can\n\n489\n00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:16.370\nlog on and create a share or update,\nclear a print queue when they need to.\n\n490\n00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:18.890\nThat's where read only domain\ncontrollers come into play.\n\n491\n00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:23.170\nA read only to main controller has\na copy of the Active Directory database,\n\n492\n00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:26.330\njust like any other domain controller,\nbut it's read only.\n\n493\n00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:27.850\nSo, no changes can be made.\n\n494\n00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:33.380\nSo, nobody out there can attempt to access\nthat machine and create backdoor accounts.\n\n495\n00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:34.280\nAll right?\n\n496\n00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:35.800\nIt's read-only in that respect.\n\n497\n00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:39.550\nNo changes and\nno passwords are stored on there.\n\n498\n00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:43.160\nSo, it's a copy of the active directory\ndatabase without the secrets and\n\n499\n00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.340\nthen you might say to yourself Mike,\n\n500\n00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:49.070\nif it doesn't have any passwords, how\nare your branch office users logging on?\n\n501\n00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:50.670\nWell it starts out with none.\n\n502\n00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:53.470\nWe're going to allow it to\ncache certain passwords but\n\n503\n00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:56.040\nonly the passwords for those people\nout there in the branch office.\n\n504\n00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.440\nNot my domain admins.\n\n505\n00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:58.920\nNot my enterprise admins.\n\n506\n00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.160\nNone of those sensitive accounts.\n\n507\n00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:03.190\nThose passwords are not located\non that domain controller.\n\n508\n00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:05.950\nSo, that way if somebody was\nto steal those hard drives,\n\n509\n00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:07.700\nthey got a copy of my\nactive director database.\n\n510\n00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:10.100\nThey are going to see all\nthose user accounts, but\n\n511\n00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:11.705\nthey are not going to see\nany of the passwords.\n\n512\n00:26:11.705 --> 00:26:15.475\nSo, now what they do to try to hack,\nthey're not going to get those passwords.\n\n513\n00:26:15.475 --> 00:26:19.215\nRead only domain controllers are what\nwe would use where we need a domain\n\n514\n00:26:19.215 --> 00:26:23.965\ncontroller but we don't have\nthe physical security and we don't have\n\n515\n00:26:23.965 --> 00:26:29.140\nthe administrative access, or we don't\nhave administrators to take care of it,\n\n516\n00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:33.550\nread only demand controls because they're\nread only, they don't store any passwords\n\n517\n00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:38.220\nexcept for the ones we explicitly\nassign and I can make a local admin, so\n\n518\n00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:41.570\nthat one of those people out there\nat the branch office can log on and\n\n519\n00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:46.570\ndo Windows updates, or fix the print queue\nbut they won't have administrative access\n\n520\n00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:49.840\nover active directory,\nthey're just gonna be a local admin.\n\n521\n00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:54.910\nWhat I'll separate VLANs from\nmanagement is another big thing.\n\n522\n00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:58.960\nWe want to keep that management\ntraffic separate from\n\n523\n00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.180\nour normal traffic on our LANs.\n\n524\n00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:02.810\nWe're doing important things.\n\n525\n00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:04.140\nWe're remoting into servers.\n\n526\n00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:08.470\nWe're sending administrative credentials\nback and forth, and yes we should be using\n\n527\n00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:12.100\nsecure protocols to make sure that\nstuff is protected as it travels across\n\n528\n00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:16.560\nthe network but one step further,\nsegregate it out from everything else.\n\n529\n00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.380\nThat way, if Daniel's in a bad mood,\nhe can't fire up his network sniffer and\n\n530\n00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:24.410\nstart sniffing traffic and try to grab\nsome of those administrative credentials.\n\n531\n00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:26.060\nSegregate it out to its own VLAN.\n\n532\n00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:29.550\nWe've seen Seen in other episodes\nwhat a VLAN allows me to do.\n\n533\n00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:34.750\nThat way I can keep that traffic, so that\nit's just management traffic on that VLAN,\n\n534\n00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:39.550\nnobody else is going to be trying to\ncapture or intercept any of that data.\n\n535\n00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:43.080\nThen the last thing they call out on\nsecuring our servers Daniel is going to be\n\n536\n00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:46.260\nThe Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer.\n\n537\n00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:47.480\nFantastic little tool.\n\n538\n00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:48.700\nLet me show you what it is.\n\n539\n00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:50.750\n>> The good old MBSA.\n\n540\n00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:51.680\n>> The MBSA.\n\n541\n00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.250\nBeen around for a long time.\n\n542\n00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:58.030\nIt's updated, obviously, every time\na new operating system comes out and\n\n543\n00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:02.810\nit allows me to scan a machine or\nmachines, nice improvement.\n\n544\n00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:06.900\nThey've actually let you scan\nmultiple computers now but it allows\n\n545\n00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:11.670\nme to scan these machines and it compares\nthem against a database of best practices.\n\n546\n00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:17.380\nUnless we look at it, it says look,\nyou need to change this or Recommends,\n\n547\n00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:18.670\nI should say.\n\n548\n00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:22.250\nIt's going to find things like\nyour administrator account\n\n549\n00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:24.150\nis set to password never expires.\n\n550\n00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:25.000\nThat's a bad thing.\n\n551\n00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.920\nIn fact, let me scan this guy while\nwe're sitting here talking about it.\n\n552\n00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:32.215\nI'll scan the local machine here,\nand I'm just going to do,\n\n553\n00:28:32.215 --> 00:28:36.250\nno, we're not doing IIS, we're not doing\nSQL, and I'm not doing updates because I\n\n554\n00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:40.570\nhaven't updated this machine and it would\nsend off quite a few bells and whistles.\n\n555\n00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:42.070\nWe'll go ahead and let that run.\n\n556\n00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:44.370\nJust something quick so\nwe can see it and here we go.\n\n557\n00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:46.150\nAll right.\n\n558\n00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:52.040\nSo, I can see my Severe Risk,\none or more critical checks failed.\n\n559\n00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:55.780\nSo, it shows me down here,\nautomatic updates is turned off.\n\n560\n00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:57.460\nThat's a bad thing.\n\n561\n00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:00.520\nSome of my accounts have\nnon expiring passwords.\n\n562\n00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.280\nWell, that's not a great thing.\n\n563\n00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.470\nIt's not a super bad thing.\n\n564\n00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:04.700\nYou see the difference in the icon.\n\n565\n00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.885\nThere's some updates\nthat haven't been done.\n\n566\n00:29:06.885 --> 00:29:11.170\nThe Firewall has some exceptions\nthat maybe I should check out.\n\n567\n00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:11.730\nSome other things,\n\n568\n00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:15.220\nlooks like I passed okay and you can see\njust kind of scrolling through here,\n\n569\n00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:18.350\nmy results are not important, I mean\nthat's not what we're here to learn.\n\n570\n00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:22.935\nIt's the fact that I now have a tool,\nthat I can use to scan a server and\n\n571\n00:29:22.935 --> 00:29:25.025\nspot vulnerabilities like that.\n\n572\n00:29:25.025 --> 00:29:29.265\nMaybe I forgot that I set up an account\nwith a password never expires when\n\n573\n00:29:29.265 --> 00:29:32.905\nI first set the server up, for\nsome testing purposes, and\n\n574\n00:29:32.905 --> 00:29:34.535\nI forgot to disable that account.\n\n575\n00:29:34.535 --> 00:29:37.090\nWell, this thing is gonna\nfind things like that.\n\n576\n00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:40.100\nSo, this goes out it updates\nthe database from Microsoft so\n\n577\n00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:43.670\nit's where the latest and\ngreatest best practices.\n\n578\n00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:45.850\nYou saw how it can scan multiple machines.\n\n579\n00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:49.470\nI can scan a whole bank of servers at\nonce and then come back the next day and\n\n580\n00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:53.770\nhave a nice report on what's\nwrong with that server and\n\n581\n00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:56.770\nyou see how it categorizes them so\n\n582\n00:29:56.770 --> 00:30:01.340\nI can focus on the really important\nones first, get all those done, and\n\n583\n00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:06.940\nthen I can maybe move on to the next\nlevel of severity and it's a free tool.\n\n584\n00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:09.720\nYou just have to download it\nfrom Microsoft and run it.\n\n585\n00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.330\nSo, no reason not to keep\nthose service secured.\n\n586\n00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:15.160\n>> That's right and\nlet the NBSA do all the legwork for ya.\n\n587\n00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.190\nYou only gotta run this thing every so\noften.\n\n588\n00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:21.130\nIt's not like you gotta do it every day\nbut once a month, fire off the NBSA.\n\n589\n00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:22.890\nLet us see if we can find anything,\nlike Mike said.\n\n590\n00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:27.080\nA lot of times because we do so\nmany different tasks in an administrative\n\n591\n00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:30.840\ncapacity, especially on servers, we\nforget some of the stuff that we've done.\n\n592\n00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:34.590\nWe've made changes so that we can\nallow that to work for us real quick.\n\n593\n00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:35.770\n>> Open up that firewall.\n\n594\n00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:37.510\nLet's go turn that firewall off for\na second and\n\n595\n00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:39.880\nsee if this works and\nthen you forget to turn it back on, right?\n\n596\n00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And you forgot

--> 00:30:53.430\nat least you're taking measures.\n\n602\n00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:56.890\nIt's better to be open for\na month than for a year.\n\n603\n00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:00.430\nRight?\nCuz the more time that you give a bad guy\n\n604\n00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:05.500\nat your system, a better of a chance he\nhas of getting in and compromising data.\n\n605\n00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:06.655\nMike,
