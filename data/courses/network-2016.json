certification exam.\n\n3\n00:00:09.572 --> 00:00:13.172\nNow this exam centers around\nnetworking technologies,\n\n4\n00:00:13.172 --> 00:00:17.070\nwireless technologies as\nwell as wired technologies.\n\n5\n00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.840\nAnd when you are through with\ntaking this certification exam,\n\n6\n00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.290\nit does demonstrate competencies in things\nlike network design, basic connectivity.\n\n7\n00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.350\nWe'll look at things like an understanding\nof maintaining network documentation,\n\n8\n00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.070\nas well as the limitations,\nthe weaknesses and\n\n9\n00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.500\nimplementation of security standards and\nprotocols.\n\n10\n00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.190\nOne of the things to keep in mind\nis that the candidate will have\n\n11\n00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.590\na basic understanding of\nthe emerging technologies,\n\n12\n00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.400\nlike things like cloud-based\ntechnologies and unified communication.\n\n13\n00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.330\nLet's go ahead and took a look at what the\nbreakdown of what this exam will be, so\n\n14\n00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.550\nyou can kinda get an idea as to what you\ncan expect when you look at the series.\n\n15\n00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.300\nYou'll see that in 1.0, we're gonna be\ntalking about, well, network architecture.\n\n16\n00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.090\nYou could see that that is\n22% of the overall exam.\n\n17\n00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.840\nYou could see here that in Domain 2.0,\n\n18\n00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.680\nwe're gonna be looking\nat network operations.\n\n19\n00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.480\nYou could see that that is pretty\nhefty portion of the exam as well,\n\n20\n00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.240\nyou can see that it is 20% of your exam.\n\n21\n00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.260\nWe'll also be looking at network security,\n\n22\n00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.590\nvery important to keep your network\nsecure cuz when you bring them online,\n\n23\n00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.960\nwe gotta make sure that they stay online\nand they don't get attacked or hacked.\n\n24\n00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.970\nWe're also gonna look\nat troubleshooting and\n\n25\n00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.130\nyou can see that out of everything\nwithin the exam breakdown here, 24%,\n\n26\n00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.080\ntroubleshooting does constitute\nthe majority of this entire exam.\n\n27\n00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.876\nFinally, we're gonna talk a little about\nthese industry-wide standards inside of\n\n28\n00:01:38.876 --> 00:01:40.950\nnetworking communications today.\n\n29\n00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.380\nGoing a little bit farther than that,\nif we break down some of the things that\n\n30\n00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.480\nyou can see when we look\nat network architecture,\n\n31\n00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.730\nwe'll be looking at the various\nconnectivity devices that are in our\n\n32\n00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.780\nnetworks that move communications\nfrom source to destination.\n\n33\n00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.530\nWe'll also be looking at\nthe different various services\n\n34\n00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.660\nthat allow our networks to communicate.\n\n35\n00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.720\nWe'll be looking at services like DHCP.\n\n36\n00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.880\nYou can see DNS as well.\n\n37\n00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.830\nWe'll be looking at different forms\nof things like network translation\n\n38\n00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:06.970\ntechnologies.\n\n39\n00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.730\nWe will be looking at copper media, fiber\nmedia, wireless communications and more.\n\n40\n00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.710\nSo you can say that there is a lot of\ninformation that is going to be in this\n\n41\n00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.230\ncertification exam.\n\n42\n00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.060\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's bump on over the CompTIA's website.\n\n43\n00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.160\nNow, if you want more information\nabout what you can expect,\n\n44\n00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.990\nthe objective as well as the exam details,\n\n45\n00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.510\nyou can always go to www.comptia.org and\nyou could find this information.\n\n46\n00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.928\nYou can see that the current\nExam Code is N10-006.\n\n47\n00:02:36.928 --> 00:02:41.573\nAnd you can see here too, Network+ covers\nthe configuration, management, and\n\n48\n00:02:41.573 --> 00:02:45.620\ntroubleshooting of common wireless and\nwired network devices.\n\n49\n00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.640\nThe number of questions that you can see\ninside of this exam is going to be, well,\n\n50\n00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.660\n90 questions, maximum of 90 questions.\n\n51\n00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.500\nNow the type of questions,\nthey're multiple choice, right?\n\n52\n00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.830\nMultiple choice questions, right,\nthe fact that you're gonna pick A,\n\n53\n00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.580\nB, C, or D, you'll also see things\nlike multiple answers, right?\n\n54\n00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.190\nYou see single and multiple responses.\n\n55\n00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.390\nFor instance, if you have a question and\nit requires multiple responses,\n\n56\n00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.580\nit might say something like,\nwell choose two, maybe A and B.\n\n57\n00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.950\nYou will also have things\nlike drag-and-drops.\n\n58\n00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.230\nA list of potential answers on one side\nthat you have to drag them and enter and\n\n59\n00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.440\nfill out boxes on the right side.\n\n60\n00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.820\nThey also talk about\nperformance based questions.\n\n61\n00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.760\nPerformance based questions means you\ndo have the potential to see some\n\n62\n00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.950\nsimulations on the CompTIA Net+ exam.\n\n63\n00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.850\nYou can see that the length\nof the test is 90 minutes.\n\n64\n00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.796\nYou see that the passing score\nis 720 on a scale of 100-900.\n\n65\n00:03:41.796 --> 00:03:45.900\nThe experiment, or experience,\nexcuse me, recommended experiences,\n\n66\n00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.936\nwell they rather recommend having the A+\ncertification, taking the 901 and\n\n67\n00:03:50.936 --> 00:03:56.950\nthe 902 currently in those exams, and also\nto have nine months of network experience.\n\n68\n00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.030\nWe do have a few different language types\nif that is something that you need.\n\n69\n00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.670\nKeep in mind that the series is\ngoing to be based in English,\n\n70\n00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.740\nbut there is a Japanese version and\na German version as well.\n\n71\n00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.932\nLast but not least,\nyou can see that the overall price for\n\n72\n00:04:14.932 --> 00:04:20.448\nthe Network+ (N10-006) exam\nis going to be $294.00.\n\n73\n00:04:20.448 --> 00:04:24.446\nSo if network is something that you\nbelieve you want to accomplish,\n\n74\n00:04:24.446 --> 00:04:27.602\nwhether it is a certification exam or\nwhether it is for\n\n75\n00:04:27.602 --> 00:04:31.462\nself experience in a real world to\nmaybe give you a better position\n\n76\n00:04:31.462 --> 00:04:34.926\nwithin your company,\nthen this is what you've gotta be.\n\n77\n00:04:34.926 --> 00:04:41.790\nSo stick around as we got a lot more at\nCompTIA Network+ (N10-006) coming up.\n\n78\n00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.642\n[SOUND]\n\n",
